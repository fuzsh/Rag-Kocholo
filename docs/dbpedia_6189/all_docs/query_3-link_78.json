        "text": "Acupuncture is well-known for inducing a relaxation response- hence the “acu-nap” many clients take on the treatment table! The insertion of extremely fine needles into the skin at specific acupuncture points releases endorphins, the body’s natural pain-killing chemicals. It also affects the part of the brain that governs serotonin, a brain chemical involved with mood.\n\nThis is a very stressful and challenging time for many of us. If acupuncture isn’t accessible to you right now, give acupressure a try! A simple acupressure routine may help to manage some of the effects of stress and anxiety on the body.\n\nApplying pressure to acupuncture points mobilizes energy in the channels and communicates with the nervous system to stimulate the release of those feel-good chemicals. In Chinese Medicine theory, emotions and mental functions are viewed as components of qi (the body’s vital energy) and blood. Correcting the movement of qi and blood in the meridians brings balance back to the mind, body, and spirit.\n\nMost acupuncture points calm the nervous system, but here are a few favorites for reducing stress and easing anxiety: Du 20, Yin Tang, Ren 17, GB-21, Ht-7, Sp-6, and Lr-3.\n\nIn Chinese Medicine, all emotions have a special directionality. The “qi” of anxiety and stress is generally concentrated upwards, settling into the mind, shoulders, heart, and chest. Acupressure can help redistribute this energy through the meridians so you can ground again.\n\nTo do this, we recommend starting with Du-20, the point at the top of your head, and ending with Lr-3 on the feet for a grounding treatment. You can press the point on each side of the body to feel which one is more tender/sensitive. If you notice a difference, spend more time on the tender side. If you’re still feeling unsettled, press into the bottom of your feet, which your thumb or a tennis ball, to anchor that energy.\n\nWhen locating points, feel for a tender spot or a place when your finger seems to dip slightly. Most acupuncture points are noticeable once you find them! Spend 30 seconds on each point with firm pressure, while taking nice deep breaths into your abdomen.\n\nTip: Try using relaxing essential oils like lavender, neroli, clary sage, sandalwood, bergamot, or vetiver to enhance your acupressure session.\n\n(See related posts: “Essential Oils for Stress + Anxiety Relief”)"
