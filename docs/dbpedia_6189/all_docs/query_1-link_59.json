In 2000-2013, sporadic imported cases of dengue fever (DF) were reported almost annually in Yunnan Province. During 2013-2015, we confirmed that a large-scale indigenous DF outbreak emerged in cities of Yunnan Province near the China-Myanmar-Laos border. Epidemiological characteristics of DF in Yunnan Province during 2013-2015 were evaluated by retrospective analysis. A total of 232 dengue virus (DENV)-positive sera were randomly collected for sequence analysis of the capsid/premembrane region of DENV from patients with DF in Yunnan Province. The envelope gene of DENV isolates was also amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the neighbor-joining method with the Tajima-Nei model. Phylogenetically, all DENV-positive samples could be classified into DENV-1 genotype I and DENV-2 Asian I genotype during 2013-2015 and DENV-4 genotype I in 2015 from Ruili City; and DENV-3 genotype II in 2013 and DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype in 2015 from Xishuangbanna Prefecture. Our results indicated that imported DF from patients from Laos and Myanmar was the primary cause of the DF epidemic in Yunnan Province. Additionally, DENV strains of all four serotypes were identified in indigenous cases in Yunnan Province during the same time period, while the dengue epidemic pattern observed in southwestern Yunnan showed characteristics of a hypoendemic nature: circulation of DENV-1 and DENV-2 over consecutive years.\n\nEvaluation of ecosystem service based on scenario simulation of land use in Yunnan Province\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Hong; Liao, Xiaoli; Zhai, Tianlin\n\n2018-04-01\n\ndifferences. Under the BAU scenario, the construction land is mainly in the south of Lijiang City and the northeastern part of Kunming. Under the FP scenario, the new construction land is concentrated near the Lashi dam in northern Yunnan Province, and the high-quality arable land in the valley will be better protected. The research results can provide reference for the optimization of land use pattern in Yunnan Province, and provide scientific basis for land use management and planning. Based on the value of ecosystem services, we should implement the policy of strict protection of arable land, both to ensure food supply and promote the healthy development of ecological environment.\n\nRural Health Care Workers and Local Residents Health Status in Yulong County of Yunnan Province China and Hat Yai City of Songkhla Mansion Thailand.\n\nPubMed\n\nFanwei, Q U; Yanling, J; Chongsuvivatwong, V; Liabsuetrakul, T; Yan, L; Le, C; Runsheng, J\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo compare health status between Hat Yai city of Songkhla Province in Thailand and Yulong county of Yunnan province in China about rural health care workers and local residents, analyzing of both differences, learning from the advanced experience and practice of Thailand, adjusting policy, especially for the implementation of measures to improve the lack of human resources construction of Yulong County rural health, promote the level of rural health service of Lijiang. A qualitative study consisting of focus group discussions and individual in-depth interviews were conducted in Rural Health Care Workers and Local Residents Health Status in Yulong County of Yunnan Province China and Hat Yai City of Songkhla Mansion Thailand from. Compared to 41(100%) bachelor's degree of medical staffs in Hat Yai, this accounted only 94 (42%) bachelor's degree of medical staffs in Yulong county hospital, and 31 (12%)in townships hospitals. For medical workers in Hat Yai, they have at least one time on-job training per year, but for Yulong county, only 144 (29%)of the medical personnel participated in the training per year. Health expenditures of Yulong county was mainly borne by the local government, and medical insurance coverage rate is 217,107 (99%). Insurance average awareness of Hat Yai is 4449 (66.4%), Yulong County is 62,501 (28.5%), P<0.001, there are statistically significant differences between two cities. Thailand has good experience in training, well-paid, motivating and retaining talent for rural health human resources; multi-pronged, mechanism innovation, establish and perfect the system of human resources for health, is the essential way to solve the problem.\n\nExpansion of HIV/AIDS in China: Lessons from Yunnan Province\n\nPubMed Central\n\nXiao, Yan; Kristensen, Sibylle; Sun, Jiangping; Lu, Lin; Vermund, Sten H.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn this article we systematically and critically review the Chinese and English language literature on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related studies in Yunnan Province, Southwestern China. Yunnan Province had the first Chinese HIV outbreak and is still the worst affected area in the nation. Since 1989, HIV infection has extended from injecting drug users into the general population through sexual transmission. Since the economic reform of the 1980s, changed social norms and increased migration have spawned increases in HIV-related risk behaviors such as drug use and commercial sex work. A smaller size of âbridgeâ populations and lower sexual contact rates between persons in âbridgeâ and general populations may explain the slower expansion of the HIV epidemic in Yunnan compared to nearby Southeast Asian nations. In 2004, women in antenatal care had a 0.38% HIV prevalence province wide, although >1% infection rates are seen in those counties with high injection drug rates. Patterns of drug trafficking have spread the unusual recombinant HIV subtypes first seen in Yunnan to far-flung regions of China. Increased efforts of Yunnanâs HIV control program are correlated with an improved general HIV awareness, but risk behaviors continue at worrisome rates. Future efforts should focus on changing risk behaviors, including harm reduction and condom promotion, especially among the âbridgeâ groups. The resurgence of commercial sex work in Yunnan, and the high frequency of workers migrating into provinces far from home and family are all sociocultural factors of considerable importance for future HIV and sexually transmitted disease control in China. PMID:17107739\n\nHIV-infected female sex workers' high risk behavior and attitude changes in Kaiyuan City, Yunnan Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nDing, Guo Wei; Hsi, Jenny H; Liu, Hui Xin; Su, Ying Ying; Wang, Jun Jie; Bai, Jun; Wang, Gui Xiang; Wang, Hai Bo; Dong, Rui Ling; Wang, Ning\n\n2014-06-01\n\nTo investigate the attitude and sexual behavior status and change among HIV positive female workers in entertainment sites in Kaiyuan city, Yunnan province, China. The key information should be applied in the integrated intervention program in future. A cohort survey among HIV positive female workers was conducted during 12 months, between 2010 and 2012. All the risk sexual behavior and attitude were collected for assessment for the potential secondary transmission to sexual partners. Of 99 HIV positive women who sell sex in Kaiyuan city, 99 participated in the survey at baseline, 80, 80, 75, and 75 at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. The percentage of participants who reported consistently used condoms in the last one month ranged between 94.5% and 95.5%. The client volume in the last one month, income per sex and age group were significant related with non-insistent condom use with their clients. It was suggested that integrated intervention program package should include 100 percent condom use promotion for the HIV positive FSW with all sexual partners, and also, include socially support involved.

Development of sustainable mountain agriculture will require an increased understanding of the effects of environmental factors on grain and climatic yields. The objective of this study was to explore the relationships between actual grain yield, climatic yield, and environmental factors in a mountainous region in China. We collected data on the average grain yield per unit area in 119 counties in Yunnan province from 1985 to 2012, and chose 17 environmental factors for the same period. Our results showed that actual grain yield ranged from 1.43 to 6.92 tÂ·ha-1, and the climatic yield ranged from -0.15 to -0.01 tÂ·ha-1. Lower climatic yield but higher grain yield was generally found in central areas and at lower slopes and elevations in the western and southwestern counties of Yunnan province. Higher climatic yield but lower grain yield were found in northwestern parts of Yunnan province on steep slopes. Annual precipation and temperature had a weak influence on the climatic yield. Slope explained 44.62 and 26.29% of the variation in grain yield and climatic yield. The effects of topography on grain and climatic yields were greater than climatic factors. Slope was the most important environmental variable for the variability in climatic and grain yields in the mountainous Yunnan province due to the highly heterogeneous topographic conditions. Conversion of slopes to terraces in areas with higher climatic yields is an effective way to maintain grain production in response to climate variability. Additionally, soil amendments and soil and water conservation measures should be considered to maintain soil fertility and aid in sustainable development in central areas, and in counties at lower slopes and elevations in western and southwestern Yunnan province.\n\nContribution to knowledge of the genus Chydaeus in Xizang Autonomous Region [Tibet] and Yunnan Province, China (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Harpalini)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKataev, Boris M.; Liang, Hongbin; Kavanaugh, David H.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAbstract Five new species of the genus Chydaeus Chaudoir, 1854 are described from China: Chydaeus fugongensis sp. n.

Hence, the suitable harvesting time of D. officinale in Yunnan province is from December to February of the coming year,according to the experimental results and the request of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.\n\nApplication of Multi-Source Remote Sensing Image in Yunnan Province Grassland Resources Investigation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, J.; Wen, G.; Li, D.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nTrough mastering background information of Yunnan province grassland resources utilization and ecological conditions to improves grassland elaborating management capacity, it carried out grassland resource investigation work by Yunnan province agriculture department in 2017. The traditional grassland resource investigation method is ground based investigation, which is time-consuming and inefficient, especially not suitable for large scale and hard-to-reach areas. While remote sensing is low cost, wide range and efficient, which can reflect grassland resources present situation objectively. It has become indispensable grassland monitoring technology and data sources and it has got more and more recognition and application in grassland resources monitoring research. This paper researches application of multi-source remote sensing image in Yunnan province grassland resources investigation. First of all, it extracts grassland resources thematic information and conducts field investigation through BJ-2 high space resolution image segmentation. Secondly, it classifies grassland types and evaluates grassland degradation degree through high resolution characteristics of Landsat 8 image. Thirdly, it obtained grass yield model and quality classification through high resolution and wide scanning width characteristics of MODIS images and sample investigate data. Finally, it performs grassland field qualitative analysis through UAV remote sensing image. According to project area implementation, it proves that multi-source remote sensing data can be applied to the grassland resources investigation in Yunnan province and it is indispensable method.\n\nStudy of heavy metal concentrations in wild edible mushrooms in Yunnan Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Borui; Huang, Qing; Cai, Huajie; Guo, Xiang; Wang, Tingting; Gui, Mingying\n\n2015-12-01\n\nContamination with heavy metals in several species of edible mushrooms from the Yunnan Province in China was determined. Samples were collected from 16 locations in the Yunnan Province, and the contamination levels of Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the concentrations of essential elements (Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn) in the mushrooms were at typical levels. The concentrations of potentially toxic metals (As, Pb and Cd) were higher than the national standard values of China (1.0 mg/kg for As, 0.2 mg/kg for Cd, and 2.0 mg/kg for Pb) in most cases. Bio-concentration factors suggested that it was easier for As and Cd to be accumulated in mushrooms than Pb, and a Health Risk Index assessment also suggested that As and Cd are greater risks to health than Pb. In conclusion, heavy metal pollution in wild edible mushrooms is a serious problem in the Yunnan Province. Among the toxic metals, As and Cd in the edible mushrooms in the area are the main sources of risk, as they may cause severe health problems. The local government needs to take measures in the form of concrete policies to protect the wild edible mushroom resources in the Yunnan Province. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Mycobacterium Tuberculosis isolates were collected from 6 prefectures of Yunnan province in 2014 and their Genetypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were obtained using spoligotyping and multiple locus variable numbers of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA). The results of spoligotyping were entered into the SITVITWEB database to obtain the Spoligotyping International Type (SIT) patterns and the sublineages of MTB isolates. The genoyping patterns were clustered with BioNumerics (version 5.0). Results: A total of 271 MTB isolates represented patients were collected from six prefectures in Yunnan province. Out of these patients, 196 (72.3%) were male. The mean age of the patients was (41.9Â±15.1) years. The most MTB isolates were from Puer, totally 94 iusolates(34.69%). Spoligotyping analysis revealed that 151 (55.72%) MTB isolates belonged to the Beijing genotype, while the other 120 (44.28%) were from non-Beijing genotype; 40 genotypes were consisted of 24 unique genotypes and 16 clusters. The 271 isolates were differentiated into 30 clusters (2 to 17 isolates per cluster) and 177 unique genotypes, showing a clustering rate of 23.62%. Beijing genotype strains showed higher clustering rate than non-Beijing genotype strains (29.14% vs 16.67%). The HGI of 12-locus VNTR in total MTB strains, Beijing genotype strains and non-Beijing genotype was 0.993, 0.982 and 0.995 respectively. Conclusion: The Beijing genotype was the predominant genotype in Yunnan Province, the characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis showed high genetic diversity. The genotyping data reflect the potential recent ongoing transmission in some area, which highlights the urgent need for early diagnosis and treatment of the infectious TB cases, to cut off the\n\nCarbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae in Yunnan Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nRui, Zheng; Dehua, Liu; Hua, Niu; Yue, Feng; Yunmin, Xu; Jianhua, Li; Xueshan, Xia\n\n2016-11-22\n\nAmong 144 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from 4 hospitals in Yunnan province, 113 were identified as carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). Bla KPC-2 (99/113, 87.6%) was the most common carbapenemase gene and Klebsiella pneumoniae (100/113, 88.5%) was the most common species. Bla NDM-1 (11/113, 9.7%), bla IMP-4 (10/113, 8.8%), and bla IMP-1 (1/113, 0.9%) genes were also detected. Extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase genes were common in CPE, and the SHV- and CTX-M-types were predominant.\n\nAn updated distribution and hosts: trombiculid mites (Acari: Trombidiformes) associated with small mammals in Yunnan Province, southwest China.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeng, Pei-Ying; Guo, Xian-Guo; Ren, Tian-Guang; Dong, Wen-Ge; Song, Wen-Yu\n\n2016-05-01\n\nTrombiculid mites (or chigger mites) are a large group of arthropods, and some of these species are vectors of Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of tsutsugamushi disease (scrub typhus). Yunnan Province is situated in the southwest of China, and its complicated topography, special altitude gradients, and high biodiversity have aroused the interest of many scientists to study the fauna and species diversity of plants and animals. To replenish our former faunal study, this paper listed all the scientific names of trombiculid mites in Yunnan Province, together with their hosts and collection sites (geographical distribution). A total of 120,138 individuals of trombiculid mites were collected from the body surface of 13,760 small mammal hosts (89.06Â % of them are rodents) in 29 collection sites (counties) of Yunnan Province from 2001 to 2013. The 120,138 mites were identified as comprising 2 families (Trombiculidae and Leeuwenhoekiidae), 26 genera, and 274 species. The genus Leptotrombidium had the most abundant species (109 species) of 26 genera. Of the six main vectors of scrub typhus in China, five of them were found in Yunnan. Of the 274 chigger mite species, 23 were determined as the newly recorded species (new records), which were found in Yunnan Province for the first time. The identified 274 species of trombiculid mites in the present paper are much more than those from other provinces in China and even largely exceeded the species of trombiculid mites recorded from some other regions and countries in the world. Based on the formula of Chao 1, the total number of chigger mite species in Yunnan was approximately estimated to be 346 species, and about 72 species might have been missed in our sampling process.\n\nA new species of the genus Kurixalus from Yunnan, China (Anura, Rhacophoridae)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYu, Guohua; Wang, Jishan; Hou, Mian; Rao, Dingqi; Yang, Junxing\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract A new species of the genus Kurixalus (Anura: Rhacophoridae) is described from Yunnan, China based on morphological and molecular evidence. The new species, Kurixalus lenquanensis sp. n., is distinguished from other congeneric species by a combination of (1) smaller body size (SVL in males ranges from 25.0 to 28.9 mm), (2) obtusely pointed snout with no prominence on tip, (3) rough and brown dorsum with darker mark, (4) absence of large dark spots on ventral surface, (5) brownish clouded chin, (6) granular throat, chest, and belly, (7) presence of vomerine teeth, (8) serrated dermal fringes along outer edge of limbs, (9) slight nuptial pad, (10) golden brown iris, and (11) single internal vocal sac. The new species is known only from montane scrub vegetation at the type locality (Lenquan Village, Mengzi City, Yunnan Province) and Yangjiatian Village, Gejiu City, Yunnan Province. Genetically, the new species is nested within a clade of Taiwanese Kurixalus and recovered as the sister taxon to Kurixalus idiootocus with strong support values, indicating that the ancestor of this new species might have come from Taiwan Island or the ancestor of this new species may have been widespread in southern China and the descendent species in between Taiwan and Yunnan has become extinct.

The mutations located in exons 2-12 and in parts of introns of G6PD gene were analyzed by amplification refractory mutation system(ARMS), natural and mis-match primer PCR/restrict enzyme, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism(PCR-SSCP ) analysis and automatic DNA sequencing. Among these 23 samples, 5 different point mutations in G6PD gene were identified, and they constituted 5 genotypes. There were 7 Han and 3 Dai patients with G487A mutation, 7 cases with both intron 11 T93C and C1311T mutations, 4 cases with intron 5 636 or 637 T-->del mutation, 1 case with G871A mutation, and 1 case with G487A/T93C/C1311T mutation. Two haplotypes, 93C/1311T and 93C/1311T/487A were identified in Yunnan. A strong association was observed between C1311T and the Nla III restriction site produced by intron 11 T93C. The findings of the investigators on IVS-5 636 or 637T-->del in Chinese, on G871A in mainland of China, and on G487A in the Han people of Yunnan have not been reported previously. G6PD deficiency is very heterogenous in Yunnan; G487A is one of the common mutations in that province and may be of different origins. Possibly IVS-11 T93C mutation is of non-African origin. IVS-11 T93C and C1311T might jointly result in G6PD deficiency. The above data on G6PD gene mutation types could be useful for clinical diagnosis, prevention of G6PD deficiency, and researches in the origin and migration of minorities in Yunnan or other regions.\n\nTypical Geo-Hazards and Countermeasures of Mines in Yunnan Province, Southwest China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCheng, Xianfeng; Qi, Wufu; Huang, Qianrui; Zhao, Xueqiong; Fang, Rong; Xu, Jun\n\n2016-10-01\n\nMining-induced geo-hazards have caused enormous destruction and threat to mines. Known as the \"kingdom of nonferrous metals\" and located in Southwest China, Yunnan Province developed mining-induced geo-hazards well with characteristics of multiple types, widespread distribution and serious damage. Landslides and debris flows are two common sub-types of geohazards causing most serious damage in Yunnan, and some of them were very representative in the world. Two landslides and two debris flows were chosen to analyze deeply. Both Laojinshan Landslide and Sunjiaqing Landslide possess the characteristic of rock avalanches. The high sliding speed and long distance made the landslides translate into clastic flows with impact force and caused enormous destruction. Rainstorm and mining waste rock were two main factors to induce debris flows in Yunnan mines. Heishan valley debris flow of Dongchuan copper mine was a super large rainstorm type viscose debris flow with very low frequency, which brought a good caution to utilize valleys which looked an unlikely debris flow. Nandagou Valley of Jinding lead-zinc mine in Lanping County was a rainstorm stimulating, gully-type, high frequency and large scale debris flow, which was induced by mining activities. Many countermeasures have been used for Yunnan mines, including engineering treatment technology and ecological remediation, monitoring and forecasting, relocation and public administration.\n\nTwo new species of Indonemoura (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) from Yunnan Province of southwestern China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Weihai; Wu, Limin; Yang, Ding\n\n2017-02-09\n\nTwo new species of the nemourid genus Indonemoura are described, Indonemoura curvispina sp. nov. and I. spirocornua sp. nov., from the Gaoligong Mountains of Yunnan Province of southwestern China.

The experimental field was established at Sanying Village of Eryuan County, Yunnan Province, where the \"Flourishing Forest and Controlling Snails Project\" was implemented. Different drought crops (alfalfa, vegetables, broad bean, garlic, lettuce, celery, green onions, and wheat) were intercropped under walnut forest in experimental groups, and the crops were not intercropped under walnut forest in a control group. The growth of forest, the change of snails and short-term income of residents were investigated. Agroforestry models promoted the forestry growth and effectively inhibited the growth of snails. There was a little snail in one of the experimental group that forest was intercropped with alfalfa (the occurrence rate of frames with living snails was 3.33%, the average density of living snails was 0.004/0.1 m2, and the declining rates were both 50.00%). The snails were not found in other intercropped models. The income of residents in the experimental groups increased (900-6 800 Yuan per year) compared with that in the control group. The model of walnut forest intercropped with crops not only has the obvious effect on inhibition of snails, but also has good economic and ecological benefits in the plateau mountainous area of Yunnan Province.\n\n[Cohort study of HIV infection among drug users in Ruili City and Longchuan County, Yunnan Province, China].\n\nPubMed\n\nZheng, X\n\n1993-02-01\n\nIn March 1992, KAP investigation and HIV blood test were carried out for 860 drug users and 82 spouses in Ruili, Luxi, Longchuan of Yunnan Province, China. The results show that there were 285 IDUs (33.1%) among 860 drug users. Among 282 blood samples of IDUs, the HIV infection rate was 49.0%, highest in Ruili (81.8%, 63/77), then Longchuan (44.6%, 77/166), lowest in Luxi County (5.1%, 2/36). Twelve new HIV+ were found from 75 persons, who had been tested as HIV- in recent two years. Sixty-two blood samples were collected among 82 spouses of IDUs with HIV+, 6 were HIV+ (9.8%), with an increase of 6.7% comparing with results of the investigation two-years ago (3.1%, 2/64).\n\nImpact of climate variability on Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Yunnan Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nBi, Yan; Yu, Weiwei; Hu, Wenbiao; Lin, Hualiang; Guo, Yuming; Zhou, Xiao-Nong; Tong, Shilu\n\n2013-12-17\n\nMalaria remains a public health problem in the remote and poor area of Yunnan Province, China. Yunnan faces an increasing risk of imported malaria infections from Mekong river neighboring countries. This study aimed to identify the high risk area of malaria transmission in Yunnan Province, and to estimate the effects of climatic variability on the transmission of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum in the identified area. We identified spatial clusters of malaria cases using spatial cluster analysis at a county level in Yunnan Province, 2005-2010, and estimated the weekly effects of climatic factors on P. vivax and P. falciparum based on a dataset of daily malaria cases and climatic variables. A distributed lag nonlinear model was used to estimate the impact of temperature, relative humidity and rainfall up to 10-week lags on both types of malaria parasite after adjusting for seasonal and long-term effects. The primary cluster area was identified along the China-Myanmar border in western Yunnan. A 1Â°C increase in minimum temperature was associated with a lag 4 to 9 weeks relative risk (RR), with the highest effect at lag 7 weeks for P. vivax (RR = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01, 1.05) and 6 weeks for P. falciparum (RR = 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04, 1.11); a 10-mm increment in rainfall was associated with RRs of lags 2-4 weeks and 9-10 weeks, with the highest effect at 3 weeks for both P. vivax (RR = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01, 1.04) and P. falciparum (RR = 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01, 1.06); and the RRs with a 10% rise in relative humidity were significant from lag 3 to 8 weeks with the highest RR of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.10, 1.41) for P. vivax at 5-week lag. Our findings suggest that the China-Myanmar border is a high risk area for malaria transmission. Climatic factors appeared to be among major determinants of malaria transmission in this area. The estimated lag effects for the association between temperature and malaria are consistent with the life cycles of both mosquito vector and malaria\n\nSeroprevalence survey of avian influenza A (H5) in wild migratory birds in Yunnan Province, Southwestern China.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Hua; Dai, Feiyan; Liu, Zili; Yuan, Feizhou; Zhao, Siyue; Xiang, Xun; Zou, Fengcai; Zeng, Bangquan; Fan, Yating; Duan, Gang\n\n2014-02-03\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) is a highly contagious disease which is a zoonotic pathogen of significant economic and public health concern. The outbreaks caused by HPAIV H5N1 of Asian origin have caused animal and human disease and mortality in several countries of Southeast Asia, such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam. For the first time since 1961, this HPAIV has also caused extensive mortality in wild birds and has sparked debate of the role wild birds have played in the spread of this virus. Other than confirmed mortality events, little is known of this virus in wild birds. There is no report on the seroprevalence of avian influenza H5 infection in wild migratory birds in Yunnan Province. In this study we examined live wild birds in Yunnan Province for H5 specific antibody to better understand the occurrence of this disease in free living birds. Sera from 440 wild birds were collected from in Kunming and Northern Ailaoshan of Yunnan Province, Southwestern China, and assayed for H5 antibodies using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. The investigation revealed that the seroprevalence of avian influenza H5 was as following: Ciconiiformes 2.6%, Strigiformes 13.04%, Passeriformes 20%, Cuculiformes 21.74%, Gruiformes 0%, Columbiformes 0%, Charadriiformes 0% and Coraciiformes 0%. Statistical analyses showed that there was a significant difference of prevalence between the orders (Pâ<â0.01). Specific avian influenza H5 antibodies were detected in 23 of 440 (5.23%) sera. Mean HI titer 23 positive sera against H5 were 5.4 logâ. The results of the present survey indicated that the proportion of wild birds had previously infected AIV H5 at other times of the year. To our knowledge, this is the first seroprevalence report of avian influenza H5 infection in wild migratory birds in China' s southwestern Yunnan Province. The results of the present survey have significant public health\n\nCharacterization of Fasciola samples by ITS of rDNA sequences revealed the existence of Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica in Yunnan Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nShu, Fan-Fan; Lv, Rui-Qing; Zhang, Yi-Fang; Duan, Gang; Wu, Ding-Yu; Li, Bi-Feng; Yang, Jian-Fa; Zou, Feng-Cai\n\n2012-08-01\n\nOn mainland China, liver flukes of Fasciola spp. (Digenea: Fasciolidae) can cause serious acute and chronic morbidity in numerous species of mammals such as sheep, goats, cattle, and humans. The objective of the present study was to examine the taxonomic identity of Fasciola species in Yunnan province by sequences of the first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1 and ITS-2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA). The ITS rDNA was amplified from 10 samples representing Fasciola species in cattle from 2 geographical locations in Yunnan Province, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the products were sequenced directly. The lengths of the ITS-1 and ITS-2 sequences were 422 and 361-362 base pairs, respectively, for all samples sequenced. Using ITS sequences, 2 Fasciola species were revealed, namely Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. This is the first demonstration of F. gigantica in cattle in Yunnan Province, China using a molecular approach; our findings have implications for studying the population genetic characterization of the Chinese Fasciola species and for the prevention and control of Fasciola spp. in this province.\n\nHuman paleodiet and animal utilization strategies during the Bronze Age in northwest Yunnan Province, southwest China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRen, Lele; Li, Xin; Kang, Lihong; Brunson, Katherine; Liu, Honggao; Dong, Weimiao; Li, Haiming; Min, Rui; Liu, Xu\n\n2017-01-01\n\nReconstructing ancient diets and the use of animals and plants augment our understanding of how humans adapted to different environments. Yunnan Province in southwest China is ecologically and environmentally diverse. During the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, this region was occupied by a variety of local culture groups with diverse subsistence systems and material culture. In this paper, we obtained carbon (Î´13C) and nitrogen (Î´15N) isotopic ratios from human and faunal remains in order to reconstruct human paleodiets and strategies for animal exploitation at the Bronze Age site of Shilinggang (ca. 2500 Cal BP) in northwest Yunnan Province. The Î´13C results for human samples from Shilinggang demonstrate that peopleâs diets were mainly dominated by C3-based foodstuffs, probably due to both direct consumption of C3 food and as a result of C3 foddering of consumed animals. Auxiliary C4 food signals can also be detected. High Î´15N values indicate that meat was an important component of the diet. Analysis of faunal samples indicates that people primarily fed pigs and dogs with human food waste, while sheep/goats and cattle were foddered with other food sources. We compare stable isotope and archaeobotanical data from Shilinggang with data from other Bronze Age sites in Yunnan to explore potential regional variation in subsistence strategies. Our work suggests that people adopted different animal utilization and subsistence strategies in different parts of Yunnan during the Bronze Age period, probably as local adaptations to the highly diversified and isolated environments in the region.

Methods: Based on the incidence data of scrub typhus reported in Yunnan from 2006 to 2013, the epidemiological characteristics of scrub typhus were analyzed and related environmental factors were identified with panel negative binomial regression model. Results: A total of 8 980 scrub typhus cases were reported during 2006-2013 in Yunnan. The average annual incidence was 2.46/100 000, with an uptrend observed. Natural focus expansion was found, affecting 71.3% of the counties in 2013. The epidemic mainly occurred in summer and autumn with the incidence peak during July-October. The annual incidence was higher in females than in males. More cases occurred in children and farmers, the proportions of cases in farmers and pre-school aged children showed an obvious increase. Panel negative binomial regression model indicated that the transmission risk of scrub typhus was positive associated with monthly temperature and monthly relative humidity. Furthermore, an \"U\" pattern between the risk and the increased coverage of cropland and grassland as well as an \"inverted-U\" pattern between the risk and increased coverage of shrub were observed. Conclusion: It is necessary to strengthen the scrub typhus surveillance in warm and moist areas as well as the areas with high coverage of cropland and grassland in Yunnan, and the health education in children and farmers who are at high risk.\n\nAnalysis on temporal and spatial distribution of reference evapotranspiration and its possible influencing factors in Yunnan Province\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Yashan; Nan, Lijun; Wang, Yanjun; Xu, Chengdong; Yang, Yunyuan; Cui, Changwei; Yang, Junmei; Guo, Yuan; Li, Miaorong\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThis article was based on the climate data of 125 meteorological stations from 1982 to 2011 in Yunnan Province, the daily basis ET0 was calculated with Penman-Monteith equation recommended by FAO in 1998. Then the Kriging interpolation method and related methods of climate statistical diagnosis analysis were used to analyze the features. The main results showed that the highest value of annual ET0 of Yunnan Province was the joint parts of Dali, Lijiang and Chuxiong, and also the north of Chuxiong and Kunming, while the least value was the northeast and northwest of Yunnan Province. The ET0 was showed rising trend, the speed was about 5.9mm/10a, but the rising trend was not significant. The ET0 of spring was highest, and the ET0 of summer and autumn was taken the second place, the ET0 of winter was last. The ET0 of spring, summer, autumn, winter was account for 33.35 per cent, 28.91 per cent, 20.36, per cent, 17.39 per cent of annual ET0 respectively. The ET0 of May was highest and December was least in annual. ET0 was closely related to wind speed, relative humidity, hours of sunshine and the daily maximum temperature. The correlation between wind speed, hours of sunshine, the daily maximum temperature and ET0 was very significantly positive, while the correlation between relative humidity and ET0 was very significantly negative.\n\nSpecies diversity of ectoparasitic chigger mites (Acari: Prostigmata) on small mammals in Yunnan Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeng, Pei-Ying; Guo, Xian-Guo; Ren, Tian-Guang; Song, Wen-Yu; Dong, Wen-Ge; Fan, Rong\n\n2016-09-01\n\nChigger mites are a large group of arthropods and the larvae of mites are ectoparasites. Some species of ectoparasitic mites (larvae) can be the transmitting vectors of tsutsugamushi disease (scrub typhus). Yunnan Province is located in the southwest of China with complicated topographic landform and high biodiversity, where there are five zoogeographical subregions. Rodents and some other small mammals were trapped and examined for ectoparasitic chigger mites in 29 investigation sites in Yunnan during 2001-2013. From 13,760 individuals and 76 species of small mammal hosts, we collected 274 species of mites, which were identified as comprising 26 genera in two families. The species diversity of chigger mites (274 species) in the present study were not only much higher than that from other provinces of China but also largely exceeded that recorded from other regions and countries in the world. Of the five zoogeographical subregions, both the species diversity and Shannon-Weiner's diversity of mites were the highest in subregion II (southern subregion of Hengduan Mountains) with middle altitudes and middle latitude. Both the species diversity of mites and Shannon-Wiener diversity index showed a parabolic tendency from the low altitude (<500Â m) to the high altitude (>3500Â m) along the vertical gradients with the peak occurring in the middle-altitude regions (2000-2500Â m). Of four dominant hosts, the species richness of mites was highest on Eothenomys miletus (Sâ=â165) and Shannon-Wiener diversity index was highest on Rattus norvegicus (Hâ=â3.13). Along latitude gradients, species richness of chigger mites increased first and then decreased, peaking at 25Â° to 26Â° N with 193 mite species. The geographical location, complex topography, and landscape with diverse small mammal hosts in Yunnan Province have contributed to the extremely high species diversity of mites in the province. The large sampling size of small mammal hosts in a wide geographical scope\n\nStudy on Optimal Spatial Allocation between Tourism Industry and Subject--The Case of Yunnan Province\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWang, Qi; Zhang, Mu; Luo, Jing\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThere exists mutual improvement and restriction between regional tourism industry and the development of the tourism subject.

According to the distribution of Oncomelania hupensis snails and characteristics of human and animal activities in recent five years, 6 schistosomiasis endemic villages in Weishan, Nanjian and Midu counties (2 villages each county) were selected as the investigated areas and. more than 4 hm2 area with snails around each village were investigated for the types and densities of wild feces. The schistosome infested feces was detected with the hatching method. Totally 63 hm2 were investigated and 420 wild feces were found in all kinds of environments. The densities of wild feces were 0.066 7 piles/100 nm2, and the densities of wild feces of the road and the hillside were the highest (0.098 7 piles/100 m2 and 0.088 0 piles/100 m2 respectively). Totally 260 fresh wild feces were collected, including the feces of human being, cattle, horse, dog, sheep and pig, and the feces of cattle and dog was the most (37.38% and 30.71%, respectively). No schistosome positive feces was found. There are a lot of wild feces in snail areas in Yunnan Province, and the risk of schistosomiasis transmission is still high. Therefore, we should strengthen the banning grazing measures and the investigation of dogs.\n\nHemlock woolly adelgid and its natural enemies in Yunnan Province, China: first-year (2005) results\n\nTreesearch\n\nLi Li; Wenhua Lu; Michael Montgomery; Roy Van Driesche; Scott Salom\n\n2007-01-01\n\nChinese and American institutions formed a partnership in 2005 for the purpose of studying and obtaining natural enemies for biological control of Adelges tsugae Annand, the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), in the eastern United States.

Since 2000, a new epidemic wave of rabies has emerged in Yunnan Province, southwestern China, which borders three countries in Southeast Asia. We estimated gene-specific evolutionary rates for rabies virus using available data in GenBank, then used this information to calibrate the timescale of rabies virus (RABV) spread in Asia. We used 452 publicly available geo-referenced complete nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences, including 52 RABV sequences that were recently generated from samples collected in Yunnan between 2008 and 2012. The RABV N gene evolutionary rate was estimated to be 1.88âÃâ10 -4 (1.37-2.41âÃâ10 -4 , 95% Bayesian credible interval, BCI) substitutions per site per year. Phylogenetic reconstructions show that the currently circulating RABV lineages in Yunnan result from at least seven independent introductions (95% BCI: 6-9 introductions) and represent each of the three main Asian RABV lineages, SEA-1, -2 and -3. We find that Yunnan is a sink location for the domestic spread of RABV and connects RABV epidemics in North China, South China, and Southeast Asia. Cross-border spread from southeast Asia (SEA) into South China, and intermixing of the North and South China epidemics is also well supported. The influx of RABV into Yunnan from SEA was not well-supported, likely due to the poor sampling of SEA RABV diversity. We found evidence for a lineage displacement of the Yunnan SEA-2 and -3 lineages by Yunnan SEA-1 strains, and considered whether this could be attributed to fitness differences. Overall, our study contributes to a better understanding of the spread of RABV that could facilitate future rabies virus control and prevention efforts.\n\nRediscovery of the sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) in Yingjiang County,Yunnan Province,China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Fei; Zheng, Xi; Jiang, Xue-Long; Chan, Bosco Pui Lok\n\n2017-07-18\n\nThe sun bear, Helarctos malayanus (Raffles, 1821), is a forest-dependent bear species distributed in tropical Southeast Asia.

Here we present the rediscovery of this species in Yingjiang County, western Yunnan Province, China, near the international border with Myanmar's Kachin State.\n\nDental caries status of Dai preschool children in Yunnan Province, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground The Dai people, one of the ethnic minorities in China, have a population of 1,260,000. They have the same origin as one of the main ethnic groups of Laos and Thailand. Most of the Dai live in Yunnan province, which is located in the less-developed southwestern part of China. This study aimed to describe the oral health status of Dai preschool children in China and the factors that influence their oral health status. Methods An oral health survey was performed between 2011 and 2012 to select Dai five-year-old children using multi-stage stratified sampling in Yunnan. Their dental caries experience was measured using the âdmftâ index, and severe caries was assessed using the âpaâ index, which is modified from the âpufaâ index. Oral hygiene status was assessed using the visual plaque index (VPI). A questionnaire to study the childrenâs socio-demographic background and oral health-related behaviours was completed by the childrenâs parents. Results A total of 833 children were examined. Their caries prevalence was 89% and 49% of the children had carious tooth with pulp involvement. The mean (SD) dmft score was 7.0 (5.3). Higher dmft scores were found among children who were girls, were currently bottle-fed, took daily sweet snacks, had higher VPI scores, and had visited a dentist within the last year. Conclusions The caries prevalence and experience of the five-year-old Dai children in Yunnan, China was high, and almost half had severe caries. The caries experience was associated with gender, snack habits, dental visit habits, and oral hygiene status.

A total of 261 serum samples were collected from rodents in Jingha district, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan province, and examined for T. gondii antibodies by modified agglutination test (MAT) at a 1:20 cut-off, with titers of 1:20 in 24, 1:40 in 10, 1:80 in 10, 1:160 in 4. Thirty-two of 261 (12.26%) serum samples were positive for T. gondii by MAT. A total of 751 rodent brain samples were examined by semi-nested-PCR, 46 (6.13%) were positive for the T. gondii B1 gene, 2 of them showed complete genotyping results for all 11 polymorphic loci (SAG1, SAG2, alt.SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, L358, PK1, C22-8, C29-2 and Apico). The two samples were characterized to represent ToxoDB Genotype #137 (http://toxodb.org/toxo/). These findings enriched the epidemiological and genetic diversity of T. gondii in China, and implications for the better prevention and control of T. gondii infection in humans and animals.\n\nSpatiotemporal dynamics of LUCC from 2001 to 2010 in Yunnan Province, China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Z. J.; Yu, J. S.; Yao, X. L.; Chen, X.; Li, Z. L.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nLUCC (Land use and land cover change) is increasingly regarded as an important component of global environmental change and sustainable development. In this study, regional land cover type maps were drawn using the MODIS products from 2001 and 2010 based on the modified classification scheme embodied by the characteristics of land cover in Yunnan. Dynamic change in each type of land cover was investigated by classification statistics, dynamic transfer matrices, and landscape pattern metrics. In addition, the driving factors of LUCC were discussed. The results showed that the land cover types of the Yunnan province, especially woodland (WL), cropland (CL) and grassland (GL), had experienced noticeable changes with an area of about 30% of land during the study period. And there was an obvious vertical distribution pattern for land cover types. The average altitude of different land cover types from the highest to the lowest were unused land (UUT), WL, GL, water (WT), urban and built-up areas (UB) and CL. The average slope for most of the land-cover types did not vary over the past 10 years. Stabilization and homogenization will be the direction of land cover in the future according to landscape metrics analysis. The regional differences of land use structure in the area are strongly influenced by such factors as the geographical position, level of economic development and land use policy. The new policy of land use, Construction of Mountainous Town, would be provided to achieve the economical and intensive utilization of land resources during the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization in Yunnan.\n\nIsolation of Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus from Febrile Patient, Yunnan, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Jinglin; Zhang, Hailin; Fu, Shihong; Wang, Huanyu; Ni, Daxin; Nasci, Roger; Tang, Qing\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe recently determined that Nanjianyin virus, isolated from serum of a patient in Yunnan Province, China, in 1989, is a type of Kyasanur Forest disease virus. Results of a 1987â1990 seroepidemiologic investigation in Yunnan Province had shown that residents of the Hengduan Mountain region had been infected with Nanjianyin virus.

We studied the local occurrence of S.Â stercoralis in a village in Yunnan province, China, and comparatively assessed the performance of different diagnostic methods. Methodology/Principal Findings Multiple stool samples from a random population sample were subjected to the Kato-Katz method, an ether-concentration technique, the Koga agar plate method, and the Baermann technique. Among 180 participants who submitted at least 2 stool samples, we found a S.Â stercoralis prevalence of 11.7%. Males had a significantly higher prevalence than females (18.3% versus 6.1%, pâ=â0.011), and infections were absent in individuals <15 years of age. Infections were only detected by the Baermann (highest sensitivity) and the Koga agar plate method, but neither with the Kato-Katz nor an ether-concentration technique. The examination of 3 stool samples rather than a single one resulted in the detection of 62% and 100% more infections when employing the Koga agar plate and the Baermann technique, respectively. The use of a mathematical model revealed a âtrueâ S.Â stercoralis prevalence in the current setting of up to 16.3%. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that S.Â stercoralis is endemic in the southern part of Yunnan province and that differential diagnosis and integrated control of intestinal helminth infections needs more pointed emphasis in rural China.

It has been a great challenge to realize the sustainable development of land resources. Based on a computable general equilibrium model of land use change with a social accounting matrix dataset, this study implemented an equilibrium analysis of the land use structure in the Yunnan Province during the period of 2008-2020 under three scenarios, the baseline scenario, low TFP (total factor productivity) scenario, and high TFP scenario. The results indicated that under all three scenarios, area of cultivated land declined significantly along with a remarkable expansion of built-up area, while areas of forest, grassland, and unused land increased slightly. The growth rate of TFP had first negative and then positive effects on the expansion of built-up area and decline of cultivated land as it increased. Moreover, the simulated changes of both cultivated land and built-up area were the biggest under the low TFP scenario, and far exceeded the limit in the Overall Plan for Land Utilization in the Yunnan Province in 2020. The scenario-based simulation results are of important reference value for policy-makers in making land use decisions, balancing the fierce competition between the protection of cultivated land and the increasing demand for built-up area, and guaranteeing food security, ecological security, and the sustainable development of land resources.\n\nAn equilibrium analysis of the land use structure in the Yunnan Province, China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLuo, Jiao; Zhan, Jinyan; Lin, Yingzhi; Zhao, Chunhong\n\n2014-09-01\n\nGlobal land use structure is changing rapidly due to unceasing population growth and accelerated urbanization, which leads to fierce competition between the rigid demand for built-up area and the protection of cultivated land, forest, and grassland.

Profiling the levels of metal elements in Puerh tea is very important since its presence is related to human health. In this study, 41 elements in 98 Puerh tea samples from Yunnan province, China including Puerh raw tea and Puerh ripe tea were evaluated by microwave digestion combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry . The content of toxic elements, essential elements and rare earth elements of Puerh tea from different regions was discussed in detail. The concentrations of Ba, Cr, As, Pb, Bi, Fe, Zn, V, Mn, Be, Ag and Tl showed significant differences (pÂ <Â 0.05) by ANOVA analysis. Principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis were used to describe the relationship of Puerh tea from different regions. This study provided a comprehensive database for Puerh tea quality control and intake risk assessment.\n\nAbundances and host relationships of chigger mites in Yunnan Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhan, Y-Z; Guo, X-G; Speakman, J R; Zuo, X-H; Wu, D; Wang, Q-H; Yang, Z-H\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThis paper reports on ectoparasitic chigger mites found on small mammals in Yunnan Province, southwest China. Data were accumulated from 19 investigation sites (counties) between 2001 and 2009. A total of 10 222 small mammal hosts were captured and identified; these represented 62 species, 34 genera and 11 families in five orders. From the body surfaces of these 10 222 hosts, a total of 92 990 chigger mites were collected and identified microscopically. These represented 224 species, 22 genera and three subfamilies in the family Trombiculidae (Trombidiformes). Small mammals were commonly found to be infested by chigger mites and most host species harboured several species of mite. The species diversity of chigger mites in Yunnan was much higher than diversities reported previously in other provinces of China and in other countries. A single species of rodent, Eothenomys miletus (Rodentia: Cricetidae), carried 111 species of chigger mite, thus demonstrating the highest species diversity and heaviest mite infestation of all recorded hosts. This diversity is exceptional compared with that of other ectoparasites. Of the total 224 mite species, 21 species accounted for 82.2% of all mites counted. Two species acting as major vectors for scrub typhus (tsutsugamushi disease), Leptotrombidium scutellare and Leptotrombidium deliense, were identified as the dominant mite species in this sample. In addition to these two major vectors, 12 potential or suspected vector species were found. Most species of chigger mite had a wide range of hosts and low host specificity. For example, L. scutellare parasitized 30 species of host. The low host specificity of chigger mites may increase their probability of encountering humans, as well as their transmission of scrub typhus among different hosts. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that similarities between different chigger mite communities on the 18 main species of small mammal host did not accord with the taxonomic affinity of\n\nFaunal analysis of chigger mites (Acari: Prostigmata) on small mammals in Yunnan province, southwest China.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeng, Pei-Ying; Guo, Xian-Guo; Ren, Tian-Guang; Song, Wen-Yu\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThis paper studied the species diversity and fauna distribution of chigger mites on small mammals in Yunnan province, southwest Yunnan. In total, 120,138 individuals of chigger mites were collected from 13,760 individual small mammals, and these mites were identified as comprising two families, 26 genera, and 274 species. Of the five zoogeographical subregions, the mite species diversity in subregions I and II was higher than that in subregions III, IV, and V. Four mite species (Leptotrombidium scutellare, Leptotrombidium sinicum, Leptotrombidium deliense, and Helenicula simena) were the most dominant species in the whole province. Several vector species of chigger mites co-existed in Yunnan, and L. deliense (a main vector of scrub typhus in China) was mainly distributed in subregions IV and V with lower latitude and average altitude whereas L. scutellare (also a main vector in China) was mainly distributed in subregions I, II, and III with higher latitude and average altitude. Some geographically widely distributed mite species were also the mites with wide host ranges and low host specificity. The dominant mite species and their clustering tendency in the dendrogram of hierarchical clustering analysis were highly in accordance with the zoogeographical divisions. The species diversity of chigger mites showed a parabolic tendency from the low altitude (<500 m) to the high altitude (>3,500 m) along the vertical gradients and reached the highest value in the middle altitude regions in 2,000-2,500 m. The highest species diversity of the mites and their small mammal hosts happened in the regions around the Hengduan Mountains, which is a hotspot of biodiversity in Asia continent. The host and its sample size, geographical scope, landscape, topography, and some other factors comprehensively influence the species diversity and faunal distribution of chigger mites. A systematic field investigation with a wide geographical scope and large host sample is strongly recommended\n\n[Checklist of fishes of Yunnan].\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Xiao-Yong\n\n2013-08-01\n\nBased on extant literatures and taking into accounts updated results of taxonomy and phylogeny, we have updated this checklist of fishes present in Yunnan, including the number of taxa and drainage areas. As of 2013, there were 13 orders, 42 families, 198 genera and 620 valid species recorded in Yunnan Province, of which 586 were native species, 34 alien species, 254 species endemic to Yunnan, and 152 species only occuring in Yunnan within China. The number of species in Yunnan accounts for 39.17% of China's total fish species (of which there are 1 583 recorded freshwater fish species according to data present in Fishbase), and of these 6 families and 66 genera only occur in Yunnan. The number of fish species of the six major drainages in Yunnan were as follows: 202 in Pearl River, 183 in Lancangjiang River (upper Mekong), 142 in Jinshajiang River (upper Yangtze), 120 in Red River, 84 in Irrawaddy Drainage, 77 in Nujiang-Salween Drainage. There are also 99 endangered species of fish occurring in Yunnan, among them 23 species protected by the national and/or the provincial government, including 2 species of national key protected animal class one, 4 species of national key protected animal class two, 17 species of Yunnan provincial protected animal. Totally, 43 species were listed in China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals, Pisces; 73 species were listed in China Species Red List Vol. 1; 50 species were listed in endangered categories of IUCN Red List; and 3 species were listed in the Appendix 2 of CITES. The Chinese name, Latin name, synomyns, distribution and literatures of the 620 species of fishes in Yunnan are listed.\n\nDistribution of mosquitoes and mosquito-borne arboviruses in Yunnan Province near the China-Myanmar-Laos border.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Jinglin; Zhang, Hailin; Sun, Xiaohong; Fu, Shihong; Wang, Huanqin; Feng, Yun; Wang, Huanyu; Tang, Qing; Liang, Guo-Dong\n\n2011-05-01\n\nEconomic development and increased tourism in the southern region of Yunnan Province in China, adjacent to several countries in Southeast Asia, has increased the likelihood of import and export of vectors and vector-borne diseases. We report the results of surveillance of mosquitoes and mosquito-borne arboviruses along the border of China-Myanmar-Laos in 2005 and 2006, and information associating several arboviruses with infections and possibly disease in local human populations. Seventeen mosquito species representing four genera were obtained, and 14 strains of mosquito-borne viruses representing six viruses in five genera were isolated from Culex tritaeniorhynchus. In addition, IgM against Japanese encephalitis virus, Sindbis virus, Yunnan orbivirus and novel Banna virus was detected in acute-phase serum samples obtained from hospitalized patients with fever and encephalitis near the areas where the viruses were isolated. This investigation suggests that Japanese encephalitis virus, Sindbis virus, and lesser-known arboviruses circulate and may be infecting humans in the China-Myanmar-Laos border region.\n\n[Influencing factors of malnutrition of the children within 6 years in pour rural areas of Yunnan Province].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Jiang; Wan, Rong; Wan, Qingqing; Li, Juanjuan\n\n2012-07-01\n\nTo analyze the status of malnutrition for the children within 6 years in pour rural areas of Yunnan during 2006 - 2009 and to study it's influencing factors. By the random cluster sampling and stratified sampling methods, 4873 children within 6 years in rural areas were selected from four poverty-stricken counties in Yunnan Province. The questionnaire survey including questionnaire, anthropometric measurement and dietary survey such as body height and weight were used respectively for the survey. Z scores were calculated to evaluate the nutritional status. The prevalence of malnutrition was calculated by statistics software. Multiple factors analysis were finished by non condition logistic regression in software. During 2006 - 2009, of all children under the age of 6 years, the underweight rate is 15.2%, stunted growth rate is 11.5% and emaciation rate is 7.1% in impoverished rural area of Yunnan Province. Removing other variables, the result indicated: (1) The children with breastfeeding in first six months are less possible to get malnutrition than the children with formula feeding or mixed breastfeeding and formula feeding. (2) The children who are complemented grains, eggs, fruits and zinc supplement are less possible to get malnutrition than those children who are not. (3) Comparing these children who are provided with calcium supplement, the children who are not are more possible to get malnutrition. (4) Supplying supplementary such as animal liver and blood in earlier period can decrease the possibility to get malnutrition among 2-5 years old children. The main influencing factors of Children malnutrition include feeding ways in first six months, increasing supplementary food in recent one month among the children younger than 2 years old, month age when supplementary food were introduced in 2-5 years old children, and the types and frequency of introducing supplementary food among 2-5 years old children.\n\nThe Impact of Precipitation Regimes on Forest Fires in Yunnan Province, Southwest China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Feng; Niu, Shukui; Tong, Xiaojuan; Zhao, Jinlong; Sun, Yu; He, Tengfei\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe amount, frequency, and duration of precipitation have important impact on the occurrence and severity of forest fires. To fully understand the effects of precipitation regimes on forest fires, a drought index was developed with number of consecutive dry days (daily precipitation less than 2âmm) and total precipitation, and the relationships of drought and precipitation with fire activities were investigated over two periods (i.e., 1982â1988 and 1989â2008) in five ecoregions of Yunnan Province. The results showed that precipitation regime had a significant relationship with fire activities during the two periods. However, the influence of the drought on fire activities varied by ecoregions, with more impacts in drier ecoregions IV-V and less impacts in the more humid ecoregions IâIII. The drought was more closely related to fire activities than precipitation during the two study periods, especially in the drier ecoregions, indicating that the frequency and the duration of precipitation had significant influences on forest fires in the drier areas. Drought appears to offer a better explanation than total precipitation on temporal changes in fire regimes across the five ecoregions in Yunnan. Our findings have significant implications for forecasting the local fire dangers under the future climate change.

There were 83 threatened species living in the Province, belonging to 5 orders, 13 families, and 47 genera. Cypriniformes was absolutely dominant, with 64 species, followed by Siluriformes, with 16 species. Cyprinidae fishes had 51 species, accounting for 79.7% of Cypriniformes. The most species of Cyprinid fishes were of Barbinae (14 species), Cyprininae (10 species), and Cultrinae (10 species). The threatened fishes could be divided into two zoogeographical regions, i. e., Tibetan Plateau region and Oriental region, and their species composition and geographical distribution were resulted from the historical evolution adapted to the related environments. Whatever in rivers and in lakes, the Cyprinid fishes were both absolutely dominant, occupying 36.1% and 31.3% of the total, respectively. The Cyprinid fishes in rivers were mostly of endangered species, while those in lakes were mostly of vulnerable species. The factors affecting the threatened fishes in the Province were discussed from the two aspects of geodynamic evolution and present situation.\n\nMolecular typing and epidemiology of non-polio enteroviruses isolated from Yunnan Province, the People's Republic of China.\n\nPubMed\n\nBingjun, Tian; Yoshida, Hiromu; Yan, Wu; Lin, Lu; Tsuji, Takao; Shimizu, Hiroyuki; Miyamura, Tatsuo\n\n2008-04-01\n\nThis report presents an overview of human enteroviruses in Yunnan Province, the People's Republic of China. A total of 210 non-polioviruses isolated under acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance during a total study period of 5 years--1997 to 2000 and 2004--were examined. Of the 210 non-poliovirus isolates, 12 adenoviruses were serologically identified, and the remaining 198 isolates were used for molecular typing. The viral genomes of 195 non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs) on VP1 partial region of virus capsid were translated to the corresponding amino acid sequences; these were compared with those of prototype strains. Based on molecular typing, 5 isolates were classified into 5 serotypes of the human enterovirus A species, 158 isolates, into 35 serotypes of the human enterovirus B species; and 32 isolates, into 6 serotypes of the human enterovirus C species. Viruses belonging to the human enterovirus D species were not isolated. Thus, under AFP surveillance, the human enterovirus B species accounted for 75.2% of the 210 isolates, and it was considered the predominant species. This was followed by human enterovirus C (12.2%), adenovirus (5.7%), and human enterovirus A (2.4%). Further, molecular analysis suggested that several serotypes of human enteroviruses B and C that exhibited genetic polymorphism were indigenous. Molecular typing methods may aid in understanding the epidemiology of NPEVs in Yunnan Province.\n\nCrustal structure of Yunnan province, People's Republic of China, from seismic refraction profiles\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nKan, R.-J.; Hu, H.-X.; Zeng, R.-S.; Mooney, W.D.; McEvilly, T.V.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nSeismic refraction, profiles in Yunnan Province, southwestern China, define the crustal structure in an area of active tectonics, on the southern end of the Himalaya-Burma arc. The crustal thickness ranges from 38 to 46 kilometers, and the relatively low mean crustal velocity indicates a crustal composition compatible with normal continental crust and consisting mainly of meta-sedimentary and silicic intrusive rocks, with little mafic or ultramafic component. This composition suggests a crustal evolution involving sedimentary processes on the flank of the Yangtze platform rather than the accretion of oceanic island arcs, as has been proposed. An anomalously low upper-mantle velocity observed on one profile, but not on another at right angles to it may indicate active tectonic processes in the mantle or seismic anisotropy.\n\nCrustal Structure of Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China, from Seismic Refraction Profiles.\n\nPubMed\n\nKan, R J; Hu, H X; Zeng, R S; Mooney, W D; McEvilly, T V\n\n1986-10-24\n\nSeismic refraction, profiles in Yunnan Province, southwestern China, define the crustal structure in an area of active tectonics on the southern end of the Himalaya-Burma arc.

A comparison was made on radiocesium as well as the natural gamma ray-emitting radionuclide ((40)K) activity concentrations in the fruiting bodies of several valued edible Boletus mushrooms collected from the region of Europe and Yunnan Province in China. Data available for the first time for Boletus edulis collected in Yunnan, China, showed a very weak contamination with (137)Cs. Radiocesium concentration activity of B. edulis samples that were collected between 2011 and 2014 in Yunnan ranged from 5.2âÂ±â1.7 to 10âÂ±â1 Bq kg(-1) dry matter for caps and from 4.7âÂ±â1.3 to 5.5âÂ±â1.0 Bq kg(-1) dry matter for stipes. The mushrooms Boletus badius, B. edulis, Boletus impolitus, Boletus luridus, Boletus pinophilus, and Boletus reticulatus collected from the European locations between 1995 and 2010 showed two to four orders of magnitude greater radioactivity from (137)Cs compared to B. edulis from Yunnan. The nuclide (40)K in B. badius was equally distributed between the caps and stipes, while for B. edulis, B. impolitus, B. luridus, B. pinophilus, and B. reticulatus, the caps were richer, and for each mushroom, activity concentration seemed to be more or less species-specific.\n\nAnalysis on Heavy Metal Distribution in Overlying Deposit and Pollution Characteristics in Rivers around Dahongshan Fe&Cu Mine in Yunnan Province, China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuang, Qianrui; Cheng, Xianfeng; Qi, Wufu; Xu, Jun; Yang, Shuran\n\n2017-12-01\n\nDahongshan Fe&Cu mine in Yunnan Province was endowed with the title of âNational Green Mine Pilotsâ by Chinese Ministry of Land and Resources in April 2013. In order to verify the implementation effects of the green mine and better drive the construction of the green mine by other mine enterprises in Yunnan, the project team investigated overlying deposit in rivers around the Dahongshan mine in the wet season (August) of 2016, investigated mine enterprises, and applied the Potential Ecological Risk Index to evaluate potential ecological hazards of heavy metal pollution in overlying deposit. The results showed that all sampling points were less than 105, indicating the lower ecological hazard degree.\n\n[Constructing ecological security patterns in mountain areas based on geological disaster sensitivity: A case study in Yuxi City, Yunnan Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeng, Jian; Guo, Xiao Nan; Hu, Yi Na; Liu, Yan Xu\n\n2017-02-01\n\nAs one of the key topics in the research of landscape ecology, regional ecological security patterns can effectively promote regional sustainable development and terrestrial ecological barriers construction. It is extremely important for middle Yunnan, with frequent disasters and fragile ecolo-gical environment, to construct ecological security patterns so as to effectively avoid the geological disasters, maintain ecosystem health, and promote the coordinated development of regional ecological system and social economic system. Taking Yuxi City as a case study area, this study firstly estimated the ecosystem services importance of water conservation, carbon fixation and oxygen release, soil conservation, and biodiversity according to the basal characteristics of regional ecological environment, and then identified ecological sources in consideration of the quality of integrated ecosystem services and single types. Secondly, the resistance surface based on land use types was modified by the sensitivity of regional geological disasters. Lastly, the ecological corridors were identified using minimum cumulative resistance model, and as a result, the ecological security pattern of Yuxi City was constructed. The results showed that there were 81 patches for ecological sources in Yuxi City, accounting for 38.4% of the total area, and overlaying 75.2% of nature protection areas. The ecological sources were mainly distributed in the western mountainous areas as well as eastern water areas of the city. The length of ecological corridors was 1642.04 km, presenting a spatial pattern of one vertical and three horizontals, and extending along river valleys and fault basins with high vegetation coverage. This paper constructed ecological security patterns in mountainous areas aiming at the characteristics of geological disasters, providing spatial guidance for development and conservation decision-making in mountain areas.\n\nWide Distribution and Genetic Diversity of Babesia microti in Small Mammals from Yunnan Province, Southwestern China.\n\nPubMed\n\nGao, Zi-Hou; Huang, Tao-Hua; Jiang, Bao-Gui; Jia, Na; Liu, Zheng-Xiang; Shao, Zong-Ti; Jiang, Rui-Ruo; Liu, Hong-Bo; Wei, Ran; Li, Yu-Qiong; Yao, Hong-Wu; von Fricken, Michael E; Jiang, Jia-Fu; Du, Chun-Hong; Cao, Wu-Chun\n\n2017-10-01\n\nBabesia, usually found in wild and domestic mammals worldwide, have recently been responsible for emerging malaria-like zoonosis in infected patients. Human B. microti infection has been identified in China, primarily in the Southwest along the Myanmar border but little direct surveillance of B. microti infection in rodents has been carried out here (Yunnan province). In this region, a diverse topographic range combined with tropical moisture sustains a high biodiversity of small mammals, which might play important role on Babesia transmission. Small mammals were captured in 141 sample locations from 18 counties located Yunnan Province, and screened for B. microti-like parasites infection by a nested PCR to target 18S rRNA gene of Babesia, plus directly sequencing for positive samples. Univariate and multivariate forward stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to access the association between infections and some related risk factors. Infection with Babesia microti was confirmed in 2.4% (53/ 2204) of small mammals. Significant differences in prevalence rates of B. microti were observed based on variations in forest, agricultural, and residential landscapes. Furthermore, adult small mammals had higher prevalence rates than younger, pubertal mammals. The near full-length 18S rRNA gene revealed that there were two types of B. microti, Kobe and Otsu, which demonstrate the genetic diversity and regional distribution. There exists a wide distribution and genetic diversity of endemic B. microti in Southwestern China, warranting further investigations and monitoring of clinical disease in individuals presenting with Babesia like symptoms in these areas.\n\nDEFORESTATION AND LANDSLIDES IN YUNNAN, CHINA.\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nWieczorek, Gerald F.; Wu, Jishan; Li, Tianchi\n\n1987-01-01\n\nLandslides historically have caused severe erosion problems in the Xiao River drainage region of northeastern Yunnan Province, China, that hence resulted in serious economic and social consequences. Owing to monsoonal storms of high rainfall intensity, the erosion potential is high in this mountainous, seismically active region. Landslides transported large quantities of materials into the ravines. During intense storms, high runoff from the deforested areas has mobilized this material into debris flows. Where these flows emerged onto flatter slopes in the lower parts of the watersheds, the channels were too small to hold them, so farmland and villages were inundated. Debris flows in this region during June-August 1985 killed 12 people, damaged roads and the main rail line to Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, inundated farmland, and overflowed debris-retention structures. To mitigate these severe erosion problems, several different methods have been used.\n\nAbundance and diversity of archaeal accA gene in hot springs in Yunnan Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nSong, Zhao-Qi; Wang, Li; Wang, Feng-Ping; Jiang, Hong-Chen; Chen, Jin-Quan; Zhou, En-Min; Liang, Feng; Xiao, Xiang; Li, Wen-Jun\n\n2013-09-01\n\nIt has been suggested that archaea carrying the accA gene, encoding the alpha subunit of the acetyl CoA carboxylase, autotrophically fix CO2 using the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway in low-temperature environments (e.g., soils, oceans). However, little new information has come to light regarding the occurrence of archaeal accA genes in high-temperature ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the abundance and diversity of archaeal accA gene in hot springs in Yunnan Province, China, using DNA- and RNA-based phylogenetic analyses and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that archaeal accA genes were present and expressed in the investigated Yunnan hot springs with a wide range of temperatures (66-96 Â°C) and pH (4.3-9.0). The majority of the amplified archaeal accA gene sequences were affiliated with the ThAOA/HWCG III [thermophilic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA)/hot water crenarchaeotic group III]. The archaeal accA gene abundance was very close to that of AOA amoA gene, encoding the alpha subunit of ammonia monooxygenase. These data suggest that AOA in terrestrial hot springs might acquire energy from ammonia oxidation coupled with CO2 fixation using the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway.\n\n[Study on malnutrition status among Wa ethnicity children and adolescents in Lingcang prefecture, Yunnan province].\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Yunjuan; Chang, Litao; Chen, Lu; Wei, Xijing\n\n2015-12-01\n\nTo analyze the malnutrition status among children and adolescents of Wa ethnicity in Lincang prefecture, Yunnan province from 2005 to 2014, and to provide evidence for the improvement of the situation. From 2005 to 2014, children and adolescents aged 7 to 18, from 19 primary and secondary schools in Cangyuan county of Lincang prefecture, Yunnan province, were chosen, using the multistage-stratified-random cluster sampling method, to receive physic examination. WHO-2006 standard was used. Situation related to the rate of growth retardation and malnutrition among students was analyzed, from 2005 to 2014. Data was from the National Student Physical Health Research Project. From 2000 to 2014, trends on nutrition development among these students were also studied. The rates related to growth retardation among 7-18 years-old Wa boys in 2005, 2010 and 2014 were 45.61%, 52.36% and 35.85%, with the rates of thinness as 1.44%, 0.76% and 1.36% , respectively. Rates on malnutrition were 52.35% , 56.01% and 41.13% , respectively. Rates related to growth retardation among 7-18 years-old Wa girls were 42.03%, 47.41% and 33.06%, respectively, with rates of thinness as 0.91%, 0.68% and 0.83%, respectively. The rates on malnutrition were 46.13%, 49.77% and 35.56%, respectively. From year 2005 to 2014, spurt on height growth of boys and girls were among the 13-14 years-old and 9-10 years-old, respectively. Girls were 4 years earlier, entering the sudden increase in the peak age than boys. Sex difference on height among the 18 years-old Wa youngsters were 11.99, 9.34 and 11.38 cm in 2005, 2010 and 2014, respectively. Malnutrition status of retardation on growth among Wa children and adolescents remained quite serious.\n\nEmergence of novel clade 2.3.4 influenza A (H5N1) virus subgroups in Yunnan Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nHu, Tingsong; Song, Jianling; Zhang, Wendong; Zhao, Huanyun; Duan, Bofang; Liu, Qingliang; Zeng, Wei; Qiu, Wei; Chen, Gang; Zhang, Yingguo; Fan, Quanshui; Zhang, Fuqiang\n\n2015-07-01\n\nFrom December 2013 to March 2014, a major wave of highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak occurred in poultry in Yunnan Province, China. We isolated and characterized eight highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses from poultry. Full genome influenza sequences and analyses have been performed. Sequence analyses revealed that they belonged to clade 2.3.4 but did not fit within the three defined subclades. The isolated viruses were provisional subclade 2.3.4.4e. The provisional subclade 2.3.4.4e viruses with six internal genes from avian influenza A (H5N2) viruses in 2013 were the novel reassortant influenza A (H5N1) viruses which were associated with the outbreak of H5N1 occurred in egg chicken farms in Yunnan Province.
