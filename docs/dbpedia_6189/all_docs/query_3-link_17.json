        "text": "While some often call it bitter sweet there is really no flavor that precisely describes the feeling of ending a journey that lasted for 14 years. Today was my official first day of taking my first steps towards my next journey after 14 years of my loving, celebrating, sometimes crying, always learning journey with Meetup. It goes without saying the company's mission was truly one to make a dent in the universe (thanks Scott Heiferman) and I believe it did for millions of people. There have been so many ups and downs in those 14 years, but the one thing that comes to my mind of what made it special to me is the resilient perseverance of the people that made it possible. Everyone that passed through the company over those years as left and undeniable impact on me and my growth with their passions and I think and hope I've left the same on them with my own passion for creating something larger than themselves in the company of others. A special thank you goes out to Rajib Ahmed, Annyce Davis, Eujin Measson, Jameson Edwards and the amazing most recent engineering leadership team who have kept it real in the last few years and to Rui C., Ken Shih, and a dozens of other engineers for challenging me to with alternative perspectives on important engineering problems and to Brian Guthrie, Brian Gruber, Richard Hsieh, Nathan Hamblen, Chris Lewis and all my other long before now Meetup mentors for sharing your time with with me. I'm better for having had the privilege. Also, thank you for whoever produced this Meetup marketing video some 15 years ago https://lnkd.in/dgqvzBUf. It infused within me the importance of Meetup in the world moment I saw it before I started my journey with Meetup. I still believe it's as relevant today as it was then. I now have 14 years worth of reflecting on my experiences which is more than can fit into one post in one day, but I like think this space for reflection and learning as the one parting gift I'm ultimately most thankful for. If there's one thing I'll take away, it's that while technology assists you, it's people that guide you. After 14 years of influencing and observing technology shifts it was an amazing ride and I see this over and over again with the Meetup engineering community, the GitHub community, the Scala community (so proud https://lnkd.in/d5ZgzEkR continues on after all these years), the Rust language community, and now the Zig language community. However it's the people I learned to value most. I love technology and solving hard engineering problems but I love people more. As I take my next step towards my next journey with a new pair of shoes I look forward to meeting new people and new classes of engineering challenges that help challenge me to become a better person and better engineer. We're all forever students of learning in life, as long as we remain open to it. Thanks everyone at Meetup for being on that journey with me ðŸ«¶ #opentowork"
