        "text": "CAPITOL OBSERVATIONS\n\nLoyalty Day In America\n\nPresident Joe Biden designated May 1 as “Loyalty Day” in America. But this wasn’t a new designation. President Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaimed that May 1, 1955, be observed as Loyalty Day. The U.S. Congress in 1958 made it an official recurring holiday. For 66 years, every President has proclaimed May 1 as Loyalty Day.\n\nThe goal of Loyalty Day was to shine a light on historic events that led to the forming of our great nation and to recognize the freedoms all Americans enjoy. The problem is that most people don’t know about Loyalty Day, and few observe it. I don’t know of a more critical time in history when Americans need to reflect on what it means to be an American and discuss and look for ways for people to express our loyalty to our country. Sadly, our nation is more divided today than ever, and that must change and soon.\n\nA celebration of Loyalty Day took place at the Greater Peace Baptist Church in Opelika, Alabama, on May 1. The cities of Opelika and Auburn joined together to celebrate on that day. I believe this was the first time in history that two cities combined for such an observance! Both mayors issued proclamations.\n\nMy good friend Toby Warren set up the event. He invited eight Generals, the Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, the Lee County Sheriff, several key people in education and four pastors to speak for four minutes each on aspects of loyalty to America. For example, John Ed Mathison spoke on the importance of promoting the common good. General Ronald L. Burgess gave the opening challenge to start the meeting, and I gave the closing argument at the conclusion. As a follow-up to the event, John Ed wrote the following about Loyalty Day:\n\nWe need to spend more time studying how this nation came to be, what our forefathers had in mind when they developed our Constitution and set forth principles for leadership.\n\nRecently, Pew Research reported that over two-thirds of Americans feel like you don’t need religion in order to have morality. That’s because so many people define morality as whatever they want it to be. That was not true with our forefathers. George Washington said on September 19, 1796, “It is impossible to govern the world without God and the Bible. Let us, with caution, indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that our national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.”\n\nJohn Quincy Adams, our sixth President, said on July 4, 1821, “The highest glory of the American Revolution was this: It connected in one indissoluble bond the principles of civil government and the principles of Christianity.”\n\nOur fourth President, James Madison, who was extremely influential in the forming of our Constitution, said, “We have staked the whole future of our new nation, not upon the power of government; far from it. We have staked the future of all our political constitutions upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments.”\n\nThe event in Opelika was inspirational and had a tremendous effect on me. The speakers – and there were 17 in total – made a strong case for the extreme importance of loyalty to America by its citizens. The future of America depends on our people honoring and obeying God and being loyal to a nation founded upon a belief in God and with a protection based upon a strong reliance on the protection of divine providence.\n\nSo how many of you knew May 1 was Loyalty Day? How many of you believe the future of our Republic depends upon its citizens being loyal to America?\n\nWe all have an obligation to help unify our country and to make the statement that America is the “land of the free and the home of the brave” a reality for all citizens. Make our loyalty to America a daily event. God bless America!\n\nTHE TALC LITIGATION\n\nU.S. Trustee’s Office Opposes J&J’s Second Bankruptcy Attempt\n\nAndrew R. Vara, the U.S. Trustee involved in Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J’s) bankruptcy scheme, has filed a motion to dismiss the fraudulent Chapter 11 reorganization case. The court appoints the bankruptcy trustee to oversee the debtor’s estate in a bankruptcy proceeding. The trustee can evaluate and make recommendations about various debtor demands but cannot act without the court’s approval. Vara’s preliminary statement echoes arguments made by the Talc Claimant’s Committee.\n\nVara notes, “LTL’s bankruptcy petition appears to reflect a mistaken belief that the best cure for bad faith is more bad faith.” The fact that LTL is acting in bad faith should come as a surprise to no one. This is not a new sentiment. While Judge Michael Kaplan ignored this argument at the initial bankruptcy dismissal hearing, he was quickly overruled by the Third Circuit, stating that LTL failed to meet an “ordinary requirement for bankruptcy – financial distress.” Further, the court ruled that LTL’s en banc rehearing petition misunderstands the bankruptcy code and congressional intent.\n\nDespite a history of loss after loss, J&J continues in its shameful charade. The giant company has made no attempt to disagree with the bad faith argument because no other legitimate argument can be made. Vara points out that J&J “engaged in a series of transactions that LTL admits were designed for no purpose other than creating artificial “financial distress” to sidestep the Third Circuit’s decision.” It did not end there. “These transfers were either substantially or fully consummated when LTL was still a debtor in possession in its first case, subject to broad fiduciary duties to its creditors and the supervision of this court. But despite being under a statutory obligation to do so, LTL never disclosed these transactions to its creditors and never sought or obtained approval from this court for either its termination of the funding agreement or its decision to file a second bankruptcy petition.”\n\nVara’s motion points out the obvious, that “LTL is nothing more than J&J’s captive and this case is but a part of J&J’s scheme to discharge tort obligations at cents on the dollar – without itself filing for bankruptcy.” He further notes that “[LTL] exists solely to get J&J out of a jam as cheaply as possible.”\n\nThis has been pointed out by Linda J. Richenderfer, who represents the Office of the United States Trustee on more than one occasion. She stated, “the first case included more than $60 billion of support from J&J, but in the hours after the first case was ended and the second case began, a new funding agreement materialized with significantly less in financial commitments.” She further noted LTL did so despite the Third Circuit’s previous ruling and warning. In a filing supporting its motion to dismiss, the U.S. trustee said the second bankruptcy filing represents continued bad faith from LTL and that the company’s defiance of the Third Circuit’s previous ruling is enough to justify immediate dismissal of the Chapter 11. “LTL is nothing more than J&J’s captive, and this case is but a part of J&J’s scheme to discharge its tort obligations at cents on the dollar – without itself filing for bankruptcy,” the trustee further argued in its motion to dismiss.\n\nIn allowing the case to continue, despite the many objections against it, Judge Kaplan has said, “the bankruptcy case would go forward, for now, to allow the parties to develop the record necessary for him to make a ruling on a potential dismissal.”\n\nBeasley Allen is in this battle to the end. The public would be shocked and outraged if folks knew how J&J was attempting to use the bankruptcy court to punish and cheat victims. But in the end, “right will prevail,” and “wrong” will go down in flames.\n\nThe case is In re: LTL Management LLC, case number 3:23-bk-12825, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey.\n\nBeasley Allen Talc Litigation Team\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers Ted Meadows and Leigh O’Dell head the Beasley Allen Talc Ovarian Cancer Litigation Team. Andy Birchfield, who heads our Mass Torts Section, has been directly involved in all phases of the talc litigation. The team handles claims of ovarian cancer linked to talcum powder and mesothelioma cases. Several key team members are focused on J&J’s abuse of the bankruptcy system. The following Beasley Allen lawyers are members of the Talc Litigation Team:\n\nLeigh ODell, Ted Meadows, Kelli Alfreds, Ryan Beattie, Beau Darley, David Dearing, Liz Achtemeier, Jennifer Emmel, Lauren James, James Lampkin, Caty OQuinn, Cristina Rodriguez, Brittany Scott, Charlie Stern, William Sutton and Matt Teague.\n\nWhile Charlie Stern and Will Sutton are on the team, they exclusively handle mesothelioma claims. Charlie and Will are looking at industrial, occupational, and secondary asbestos exposure resulting in lung cancer or mesothelioma and claims of asbestos-related talc products linked to mesothelioma.\n\nTHE ASBESTOS LITIGATION\n\nAdding New Defendants Based On New Evidence Of Exposures\n\nLike with any lawsuit, in a mesothelioma case, Beasley Allen only files claims after they have a good understanding of the facts and legal arguments. This can take time and effort to conduct the necessary pre-filing investigation. Unlike most cases, though, mesothelioma cases present unique challenges related to this. The most challenging and common is the balancing act between this pre-file investigation and moving with enough urgency and speed to get the case filed. Moving with urgency is crucial because our most vital source of evidence, the client with mesothelioma, often only has months to live. The goal is always to get that client deposed before they are unable to sit for a deposition.\n\nSo, what happens when we file our complaint and new evidence comes out at deposition or in the form of documents implicating an entirely new defendant? This is not an uncommon occurrence because mesothelioma cases can involve 20-30 defendants.\n\nIt is essential to weigh the pros and cons of adding the newly discovered defendant. Are the exposures substantial? Is there jurisdiction over the potential defendant? Can the client give another deposition to talk about this new exposure once the new defendant is added? Do you want to force your client to sit through another deposition? These are all things we must consider.\n\nIn a recent case, Beasley Allen lawyers faced this situation. Evidence of new defendants was discovered after a key witness’ deposition. There were numerous potential new defendants, and the firm’s lawyers carefully weighed the actual exposures related to these new possible defendants, along with applicable law, and made decisions on a defendant-by-defendant basis. With this knowledge, the strength of the client’s claims was maximized while ensuring that all potential scenarios were evaluated before officially adding the new defendants. This thorough approach is crucial and utilized in all aspects of our mesothelioma litigation.\n\nThe Beasley Allen Asbestos Litigation Team\n\nThere has been no slowdown in the asbestos litigation. Case filings continue to increase nationwide. The Beasley Allen Asbestos Litigation Team is headed by Charlie Stern in our Dallas, Texas, office. Charlie has years of experience in asbestos litigation and was a perfect fit to lead the team. Other team members are Will Sutton and Cindy Lopez. Rhon Jones, who heads our Toxic Torts Section, works with the team. If you need assistance with cases involving asbestos products, contact one of the team members by phone at 800-898-2034 contact us below.\n\nTHE CAMP LEJEUNE LITIGATION\n\nCamp Lejeune Litigation Update\n\nMajor advances are occurring in the very important Camp Lejeune litigation. As I predicted, the number of administrative claims filed with the Department of the Navy (Navy) continues to rise. It is estimated that more than 60,000 administrative claims have been filed with the Navy. However, the Navy is backlogged in processing the administrative claims and as such, many claims are being pushed into the court system. As far as we can tell, no settlement offers have been made in the administrative process. This means law firms nationwide are gearing up to file thousands of suits in the Eastern District of North Carolina. The lawsuit filing process is more complicated and expensive than simply filing an administrative claim.\n\nWe believe the Eastern District of North Carolina (EDNC) is preparing for this massive influx of cases and putting structures in place to deal with this unprecedented volume of cases. More than a thousand cases have already been filed at this point – with more being filed. We have confidence that the EDNC will require lawyers filing to work and present their cases efficiently and thoroughly.\n\nBeasley Allen continues to work hard to properly represent the many veterans and their families that have been harmed by decades of exposure. We take this responsibility seriously and have, in fact, been endorsed by at least two service groups, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) of the U.S. and the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA). The VFW is the nation’s largest and oldest major war veterans’ organization, comprised entirely of eligible veterans and military service members from the active, Guard and Reserve forces. It was founded in 1899 and has more than 1.5 million VFW and Auxiliary members. The VVA is dedicated to Vietnam-era veterans and their families and has more than 89,000 members. It is with great humility and pride that we represent our service men and women and receive endorsements from groups like VFW and VVA.\n\nBeasley Allen Camp Lejeune Litigation Team\n\nIf you need help with a potential claim or more information on the Camp Lejeune litigation, contact one of the Camp Lejeune Litigation Team lawyers at 800-898-2034 or by email. The team is comprised of the following:\n\nJulia Merritt and Leslie LaMacchia, who co-lead the team. Other members are Matt Pettit, Trisha Green, William Sutton, Elizabeth Weyerman. Ken Wilson, Ryan Kral and Tucker Osborne. Rhon Jones Rhon Jones works closely with the team. Additional lawyers are added to the team as needed.\n\nTHE JUUL LITIGATION\n\nJUUL Trial Update: The Altria Settlement\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers Joseph VanZandt, Soo Seok Yang, and Davis Vaughn were hard at work as part of the trial team representing the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) in a federal multidistrict litigation (MDL) against Altria Group Inc. The trial began on April 24, and the plaintiff’s case in chief ended on May 9 after crucial evidence was presented to the jury for 11 court days. After the plaintiffs concluded their case, the parties reached a historic $235 million global settlement.\n\nThe Altria settlement is certainly a tremendous result for our deserving clients. It will provide extraordinary and meaningful relief for all those affected by JUUL. This comprehensive resolution will avoid the delay of further trial and possible appeals, bringing a close to litigation on behalf of children, teens, young adults, parents, schools, and health departments.\n\nThe settlement brings a final resolution to the personal injury, consumer class action, and government entity cases in the MDL and the JCCP, including over 8,500 personal injury cases, over 1,400 government entity cases, and a massive class of consumers.\n\nThe court will hold a hearing soon to review the proposed class settlement. If the settlement receives preliminary approval, the court will appoint a Class Settlement Administrator to structure and initiate a formal claims process. At that time, the Class Settlement Administrator will notify class members about their rights under the settlement. Concurrently, a claims process will begin for the personal injury and government entity settlements.\n\nThe cases are In re: Juul Labs Inc., Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation, case number 3:19-md-02913, and San Francisco Unified School District. v. Juul Labs Inc. et al., case number 3:19-cv-08177, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\nIf you need more information about the JUUL litigation, including the Altria settlement, contact any of the lawyers on the JUUL Litigation Team at 800-898-2034 or by email. The team is led by Joseph VanZandt and it is comprised of Sydney Everett, Beau Darley, Davis Vaughn, Soo Seok Yang and Seth Harding. Andy Birchfield heads the firm’s Mass Torts Section and has worked closely with the team on the JUUL litigation.\n\nSource: Law360\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA LITIGATION\n\nThe Surgeon General’s Report On Social Media And Youth Mental Health Is A Wakeup Call For America\n\nOn May 23, 2023, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek H. Murthy issued a public advisory warning of the risks of social media use to young people. In a 19-page report, Dr. Murthy noted, “there are ample indicators that social media can … have a profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.”\n\nThe advisory warned that social media platforms are often designed to maximize user engagement, encouraging “excessive use and behavioral dysregulation.” As of 2021, eighth and 10th graders now spend an average of 3.5 hours per day on social media, with 1-in-4 spending five or more hours per day and 1-in-7 spending seven or more hours per day.\n\nThe advisory cited research that found adolescents who spent more than three hours per day on social media faced double the risk of experiencing poor mental health outcomes, including symptoms of depression and anxiety. This amount of social media exposure can “perpetuate body dissatisfaction, disordered eating behaviors, social comparison, and low self-esteem, especially amongst adolescent girls.”\n\nExcessive and problematic social media use, such as compulsive or uncontrollable use, has also been linked to sleep problems, attention problems, and feelings of exclusion among adolescents. On a typical weekday, nearly 1-in-3 adolescents report using screen media until midnight or later. And nearly 3-in-4 teenagers believe that technology companies manipulate users to spend more time on their devices. The advisory warned that this frequent and problematic social media use can result in changes to adolescents’ brain structure, similar to changes seen in individuals with substance use or gambling addiction.\n\nThe surgeon general cautioned, “At a moment when we are experiencing a national youth mental health crisis, now is the time to act swiftly and decisively to protect children and adolescents from risk of harm.” He called on policymakers, tech companies, researchers, and parents to “urgently take action” to protect youth against these potential risks.\n\nThe surgeon general’s advisory marks an important step in raising awareness of the harms social media poses to youth and the urgency to seek solutions to the problem. It also tracks the legal theories Beasley Allen and other firms use to hold social media companies accountable. In the advisory, the surgeon general noted:\n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission requires toy manufacturers to undergo third-party testing and … the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires manufacturers to fit new motor vehicles with standard airbags and seat belts … Medications must demonstrate safety to the [U.S.] Food and Drug Administration … Given the mounting evidence for the risk of harm to some children and adolescents from social media use, a safety-first approach should be applied in the context of social media products.\n\nBeasley Allen has been investigating social media companies since former Facebook product manager France Haugen first spotlighted the issue in 2021. Since then, our lawyers have initiated federal multidistrict litigation and California state court consolidated litigation against the market-leading social media companies: Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Google (YouTube), TikTok, and Snapchat. Beasley Allen and a national team of law firms seek to hold these companies accountable for the harm they have caused youth. The harm has unfortunately bled into school districts nationwide as they seek to combat the mental health problems of their young students.\n\nWe represent thousands of individuals harmed by social media, including adolescents suffering from addiction, anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, attention problems, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide. Our firm also represents dozens of school districts that have suffered losses in time, resources, and damages to the learning environment because of social media companies’ targeted actions against our youth.\n\nIf you have a potential claim or need more information on our social media litigation, contact one of the lawyers on the Social Media Litigation Team at 800-898-2034 or by email. Joseph VanZandt leads the team and is co-lead counsel for the Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding (JCCP) for the plaintiffs in California state court. He is also a member of the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee, helping lead the federal social media multidistrict litigation (MDL). Other team members include Jennifer Emmel, Suzanne Clark, Clinton Richardson, Sydney Everett, Davis Vaughn, and Seth Harding. Andy Birchfield, who heads our Mass Torts Section, also works with the team.\n\nSource: U.S. Surgeon General\n\nSocial Media Litigation Update\n\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently co-wrote an article in The Atlantic on May 5, 2023, regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and social media. Schmidt made this observation:\n\nRecent research shows that the greatest damage from social media seems to occur during the rapid brain rewiring of early puberty, around ages 11 to 13 for girls and slightly later for boys.\n\nSchmidt cautioned that “[w]e must protect children from predation and addiction most vigorously during this time, and we must hold companies responsible for recruiting or even just admitting underage users, as we do for bars and casinos.” Schmidt called for social media to “authenticate all users, including bots,” and “clarify that platforms can sometimes be liable for the choices they make and the content they promote.” He also suggested that social media companies “raise the age of ‘internet adulthood’ to 16 and enforce it.”\n\nWe agree with the assessment by Schmidt, and our lawyers continue to work to hold social media companies accountable for the harm they have caused to our youth and communities. Currently, our firm represents hundreds of young people who have suffered devastating injuries related to social media usage, including eating disorders, body dysmorphia, suicidality, self-harm, and severe mental health issues.\n\nBeasley Allen also represents school districts from around the country joining the fight to protect children, seeking to hold social media companies accountable for creating a youth mental health crisis and leaving schools to deal with the fallout. The ongoing youth mental health crisis places severe burdens on school administrators as they work to find ways to educate students on the dangers of social media addiction, mitigate disruptions in the learning environment, and provide counseling and resources to students dealing with mental health issues.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers hold key leadership positions in the Social Media Addiction/Personal Injury Product Liability multidistrict litigation (MDL) and California state court action (JCCP).\n\nIf you have a potential claim or need more information on our Meta litigation, contact one of the lawyers on the Meta Litigation Team at 800-898-2034 or by email.

The brief states, “[t]he district court inserted a judicially created privity requirement into BIPA, holding that BIPA only protects those who have a preexisting relationship with an offender and excluding all other persons from protection under the statute,” arguing that requiring privity is contrary to BIPA’s explicit language, which applies to a person’s biometric data.\n\nZellmer alleges that from 2013 and 2016, Facebook users uploaded images with him in them to Facebook, and Facebook used facial scanning to analyze Zellmer’s face to extract biometric data and create a digital template of his face. Zellmer also argued in his brief that the “Illinois BIPA doesn’t have any requirement that he have a prior relationship with Facebook because the section of the law that Judge Donato cited in his ruling applies to people generally, not just customers.”\n\nZellmer contends that “any person aggrieved” by a BIPA violation has a right of action. His brief also claims the Illinois Supreme Court would disagree with the trial court’s findings in his case, pointing to the Rosenbach v. Six Flags Entertainment Corp. case, in which the court rejected the position that a party had to have an actual injury to be “aggrieved.” The only privity requirement, according to Zellmer, is that the party collecting biometric information must inform users of the activity. The brief argues:\n\nBy imposing a privity requirement on the person whose biometric information is taken without authorization, the district court got it backwards.\n\nAccording to Zellmer, BIPA’s legislative intent further supports reversal. The Illinois legislature aimed to promote the consensual use of biometric data when passing BIPA. In brief, Zellmer asserted that the district court had misconstrued the legislative intent to say it was to promote the consensual use of biometric data only in existing relationships. It was argued further that the trial court erroneously found Zellmer lacked standing to sue for failing to identify a specific injury.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers in our Consumer Fraud & Commercial Litigation Section are ready to review potential BIPA violations. Contact Michelle Fulmer, Section Director, if you know your biometric information is collected or disclosed without your consent. Michelle will have one of the lawyers in the section contact you.

The regulatory agency’s order gives Meta Ireland, the defendant’s EU entity, six months to implement the decision’s data transfer requirement.\n\nThe regulatory agency reached the decision after deliberating with other data protection authorities. It found that Meta Ireland violated GDPR by continuing to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S. after a 2020 judgment overturned the Privacy Shield or trans-Atlantic data transfer agreement. The DCP held that Meta “did not address the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects that were identified by the CJEU [(Court of Justice of the European Union)] in its judgment,” according to the decision.\n\nObservers say the decision was important because of the fine’s amount and for imposing “both a suspension order and an order to bring Facebook’s data processing into compliance.” They say that these two orders have not been used so far in that context, and that is said to be highly significant.\n\nMax Schrems, an activist from Austria, established a European privacy enforcement nonprofit, None of Your Business (NYOB) and began challenging Meta’s business practices in court more than 10 years ago over data privacy concerns.\n\nFacebook’s use of standard contractual clauses was central to the proceedings that resulted in last month’s order. The practice became increasingly prevalent after the CJEU overturned the Privacy Shield in 2020 due to concerns about U.S. surveillance practices. These preapproved model clauses were included in contractual agreements by companies that send and receive data from European customers.\n\nThe practice was implemented to fulfill the GDPR’s protection requirements. Simultaneously, companies were encouraged by a Luxembourg court to investigate, research and understand what is included in these standard contractual clauses in each instance before signing them. The court noted that it is the companies’ responsibility to determine, before exporting users’ personal data to a non-EU country, if the laws of that country provide enough protection under the EU law.\n\nEuropean Data Protection Board unites the EU’s 27 national privacy oversight groups. Its chair, Andrea Jelinek, said Meta’s infringement of the bloc’s privacy rulebook is “very serious” because it concerned data transfers of a “systematic, repetitive and continuous” nature. Jelinek said in a press release:\n\nFacebook has millions of users in Europe, so the volume of personal data transferred is massive. The unprecedented fine is a strong signal to organizations that serious infringements have far-reaching consequences.\n\nA new EU-U.S. data transfer agreement known as the Data Privacy Framework–the third one to be agreed upon by EU and U.S. authorities after the European court struck down the previous two-is expected to be finalized soon.\n\nSource: Law.com\n\nNHTSA: Dangerous Airbags Put Millions Of Unwitting U.S. Drivers At Risk\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has demanded the recall of 67 million ARC Automotive-made airbag inflators. ARC, a Knoxville, Tennessee-based company, refuses, potentially forcing the agency to take the battle to court. ARC refutes the allegations, saying there is no defect in its inflators. The Associated Press reports that more than 33 million U.S. drivers could unknowingly be at risk.\n\nThe ARC inflator is a pressurized metal canister that contains different components or pieces. Like other airbag inflators, ARC inflators use highly compressed gas and a secondary propellant, a fuel that undergoes a chemical reaction to create a forceful movement such as an explosion. NHTSA says that the explosive force of the ARC inflators could splinter the canister, shooting shrapnel and posing a significant and lethal risk to passengers of vehicles equipped with the defective inflators.\n\nThe agency launched an investigation into the defective inflators in 2015. It said the explosions began in 2009, and two deaths and seven injuries have been reported. The agency’s documents show that the inflators date from 2002 to January 2018, “when ARC installed equipment on its manufacturing lines that could detect potential safety problems,” the Associated Press reported.\n\nMarlene Beaudoin from Michigan was killed in 2021 when her 2015 Chevrolet Traverse was involved in a minor crash. When the collision occurred, Ms. Beaudoin was driving with four of her 10 children, and flying shrapnel from the ARC airbag inflator killed her.\n\nIn resisting NHTSA’s recall efforts, ARC told the agency in a letter that no root cause of the explosions has been determined, and no automaker has identified a common defect in the 67 million inflators NHTSA wants to recall. The company’s letter said:\n\nARC believes they resulted from random ‘one-off’ manufacturing anomalies that were properly addressed by vehicle manufacturers through lot-specific recalls.\n\nNHTSA has noted that the automakers incorporating the defective inflators in their vehicles are also responsible for a recall. The ARC inflators have been included in Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Ford, Toyota, Stellantis, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Hyundai and Kia vehicles. Automakers are investigating to determine how many vehicles have an ARC airbag inflator. Automakers issued seven small recalls between 2017 and 2022 due to problems with ARC airbag inflators.\n\nThe latest automaker recall due to ARC inflators was announced last month when NHTSA said it would take action against ARC. General Motors issued a recall of certain 2014 through 2017 GMC Acadia, Chevy Traverse and Buick Enclave SUVs because the ARC inflators can explode. The company learned this year that an ARC airbag inflator ruptured in a 2017 GM Traverse and is investigating the cause. The GM recall issued last month involves 1 million vehicles.\n\nThe agency said it has the authority to demand a recall of a company supplying the parts. If NHTSA finds the inflators are defective, it can seek a court order requiring ARC to recall the faulty parts.\n\nMichael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, has asked the government and automakers to share a list of affected vehicles with the public. He encourages customers to continue filing complaints to increase pressure on ARC to recall defective inflators.\n\nIn response to the Associated Press’ request for information, Ford and Kia’s spokespeople said they are still investigating what vehicles may include an ARC inflator. Ford noted that it has not “had any ARC airbag inflators rupture in the field.” Toyota confirmed some of its vehicles include ARC airbag inflators but did not provide further details.\n\nWhen the ARC airbag inflator is activated, the cushion fills with air during a crash. ARC inflators suffer from a two-part problem – a manufacturing design defect and a volatile secondary fuel. The design process is flawed because it fails to join the airbag inflator parts and creates excess weld flash that may block the ventilation holes. Once the inflators explode, broken pieces of the inflator, or shrapnel, are thrust forcefully throughout the vehicle cabin, potentially injuring or killing those in the vehicle.\n\nFurther, the secondary fuel used in ARC inflators is ammonium nitrate, a volatile chemical compound that was also used in defective Takata airbags. It explodes violently when exposed to changing temperature phases and moisture. While the ARC inflators attempt to prevent exposure to moisture, experts question if the extreme pressure made worse by the excess weld flash could enhance the power of the explosion.\n\nSource: Associated Press\n\nColorado Class Certified In GM Oil Consumption Lawsuit\n\nA new class of General Motors (GM) customers was certified by U.S. District Judge Charlotte N. Sweeney in Colorado last month. Judge Sweeney approved the class after determining that the Colorado residents owning or leasing certain vehicles made by General Motors presented adequate evidence showing their vehicles share a common engine defect. The GM vehicles at issue feature a defective Generation IV 5.3 Liter V8 Vortec 5300 LC9 engine. It first incorporated the Generation IV engine in its 2007 vehicles, but the Colorado class action involves updated GM vehicles from 2011 to 2014.\n\nThe latest GM oil consumption class action comes after lawyers from Beasley Allen DiCello Levitt and local counsel Jennie Anderson of Andrus Anderson secured a $102.6 million verdict from a San Francisco, California, federal jury last fall for consumers pursuing compensation for the same defect in their GM vehicles. California class members included nearly 38,000 consumers from California, Idaho and North Carolina, each receiving $2,700 in compensation for the faulty engine.\n\nIn the Colorado class action, lead plaintiff Roy White filed a lawsuit in February 2021. He and other class members claim that GM concealed faulty piston rings in the engines, with the rings wearing prematurely and causing excessive oil consumption and serious internal engine wear. The plaintiffs say that GM continued to sell the defective vehicles for years after learning of the costly engine defect. The class includes consumers that bought or leased one of the estimated 10,100 vehicles in Colorado with faulty engines, including Chevrolet Avalanche, Silverado, Suburban or Tahoe, or GMC’s Sierra, Yukon or Yukon XL for model years 2011 to 2014.\n\nThe defect forced Mr. White to replace the engine in his GMC Sierra. Beasley Allen lawyer Clay Barnett said:\n\nWhile consumers have expected GM to roll out an extended warranty or recall, GM has not. So, we’re compelled to step up on behalf of consumers. Colorado consumers should get the same $2,700 to cover the cost of replacing the pistons that cause the Generation IV engine to burn oil at an abnormally high rate.\n\nThe automaker asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit arguing that it changed the design of the engines in varying ways that “effectively addressed the root cause of oil consumption” in vehicles made before 2011. It claimed that class members never experienced the defect or alleged injuries resulting from the defect. Judge Sweeney rejected GM’s arguments and will allow the class action lawsuit to proceed.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers from the firm’s Consumer Fraud & Commercial Litigation Section also represent the Colorado class members. They include Section Head Dee Miles, Clay Barnett, Rebecca Gilliland, Mitch Williams and Dylan Martin and co-counsel, including Adam Levitt, John Tangren, Daniel Ferri and Blake Stubbs of Dicello Levitt LLC and Jennie Anderson of Andrus Anderson.\n\nThe case is Roy White v. General Motors LLC, case number 1:21-cv-00410, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado.\n\nBeasley Allen Seeks Justice For The Family Of Woman Killed In An Interstate Accident Caused By A Trailer’s Faulty Tire\n\nBeasley Allen lawyer Ben Locklar recently filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, on behalf of the son of a woman tragically killed when the wheel of a food service trailer fell off and struck her car on the interstate.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2022, Margaret Greenwood drove her 2019 KIA Optima LX west on Interstate 20 in Jefferson County. At the same time, Hector Vidal Cosme was driving a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado 2500, towing a trailer east on I-20 in the general vicinity of the Greenwood vehicle. Cosme’s employer, Eliel Jimenez Aviles, of Aviles Food Service, LLC, owned both the Silverado and the trailer. Suddenly and unexpectedly, the trailer’s front driver-side tire and rim broke off the wheel hub.\n\nThe wheel and rim crossed over multiple lanes of I-20 Eastbound, over the concrete barrier, and into I-20 West. At least one witness swerved to miss the tire as it bounced into the roadway before colliding with the rooftop of the Greenwood vehicle. The car then left the interstate and collided with a metal light pole before coming to a stop. Ms. Greenwood suffered several broken bones in the crash, including a fatal head injury from the tire crashing onto the roof of her car.\n\nMs. Greenwood’s son, Philip Michael Greenwood, a Calhoun County, Alabama resident, hired Ben to investigate the accident. Ben had this to say about his findings:\n\nThe wheel, hub, lugs, and assembly on the trailer failed and resulted in the wheel coming off of the trailer. While the investigation is ongoing, it is apparent that the owner of the trailer failed to properly inspect the wheel assembly. Had he done so, Margaret Greenwood would still be alive today.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages from Cosme, Aviles, Aviles Food Service, and Ms. Greenwood’s insurance provider, ALFA Mutual Insurance Company.\n\nIf you need more information, contact Ben Locklar at 800-898-2034 or by email us using the contact form below.\n\nThe case is Philip Michael Greenwood v. Hector Vidal Cosme, et. al., case number 01-CV-2023-900734.00.\n\nRuling In Mustang Seat Belt Case Appealed\n\nMark Henderson’s son was killed in April 2016 when he lost control of the 2003 Ford Mustang he was driving, causing him to leave the roadway and resulting in the vehicle rolling onto its driver’s side at 19 mph. During the rollover event, Mr. Henderson’s son was partially ejected from the driver’s side window and sustained fatal head injuries. Beasley Allen lawyers Tom Willingham, Mary Leah Miller and Ben Baker, members of the firm’s Personal Injury & Products Liability Section, are appealing the case for Mr. Henderson after a federal jury ruled for Ford in August 2021.\n\nMary Leah argued before an Eleventh Circuit Court panel last month that the trial court “substantially prejudiced” our client by refusing to allow evidence of 28,000 warranty claims and customer complaints about seat belts in the Mustang for model years 2001 to 2004. The court also blocked Kathy Lawhon, the plaintiff’s witness, from testifying about complaints she made to Ford about her Mustang’s driver’s seat belt not retracting when worn – the same defect exhibited in the driver’s seat belt of the Henderson vehicle.\n\nOur legal team also argued that the lower court rejected Mr. Henderson’s request to allow an expert to explain the warranty claims to the jurors and did not allow Beasley Allen lawyers to cross-examine the defendant’s design safety engineer on the warranty claims and its corporate representative.\n\nMary Leah had this to say about the basis for the appeal:\n\nThese warranty claims involve the exact vehicle at issue in this case. Our expert proved substantial similarity that these vehicles exhibited similar issues.\n\nAt trial, our legal team argued that the seat belt system Ford designed for the vehicle at issue in the case “barely meet[s] its internal standard for stowage retractions.” Although the system met the safety requirement when it was made, it would subsequently fail often within a year. The defective design allows excess webbing to remain in the seat belt and doesn’t correctly retract and restrain occupants. This increases the likelihood of injuries like the fatal injuries Mr. Henderson’s son suffered.\n\nThe case is Henderson v. Ford Motor Co., case number 22-10348, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. We will keep our readers updated about further developments in the case. If you have questions about this case, contact the lawyers on the case at 800-898-2034 or by email us using the form below.\n\nJudge Approves $326 Million Hyundai, Kia Deal\n\nCalifornia federal judge Stanley Blumenfeld Jr. granted final approval to a $326 million deal, resolving three consolidated class action lawsuits accusing Hyundai and Kia of selling millions of vehicles with an anti-lock (ABS) brake system defect that can trigger fires.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Hyundai and Kia will reimburse class members for extended warranties covering all expenses class members incur related to the faulty ABS module, a free inspection of the ABS module in the affected vehicles, and reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, such as car rentals and towing. Class members whose vehicles were destroyed by a fire stemming from the defect will receive the full Black Book value for their vehicles plus $140 in goodwill payments.\n\nMore than a dozen Hyundai and Kia drivers filed class action lawsuits in 2020. The complaints alleged that about 3.1 million Hyundai and Kia vehicles have the faulty ABS modules, which can short circuit and ignite an engine fire. A communication from the automakers to owners of the affected vehicles underscored the severity of the problem. It advised them to park their vehicles outdoors and away from any structures until the proper repairs could be made.\n\nWhile the deal comes with a minimum price tag of $326 million, the automakers could potentially pay double that amount — $652 million – depending on the number of class members who file claims for reimbursement and take their vehicles for the free inspection.\n\nLaw360 reports that the order approved incentive payment requests for the named plaintiffs totaling $67,500, with the judge agreeing to payment requests ranging from $2,500 to $5,000 for each of the 18 named plaintiffs.\n\nThe Hyundai class vehicles in the litigation include model years 2014-2021 Tucson; 2007 and 2017-2018 Santa Fe; 2013-2015 and 2017-2018 Santa Fe Sport; 2019 Santa Fe XL; 2006-2011 Azera; 2017-2020 Genesis G80 sedans; 2019-2021 Genesis G70 sedans; 2015-2016 Genesis; 2007-2010 Elantra; 2009-2011 Elantra Touring; 2006 Sonata; and 2007-2008 Entourage.\n\nThe Kia class vehicles include model years 2008-2009 and 2014-2021 Sportage; 2007-2009 and 2014-2015 Sorento; 2013-2015 Optima; 2018-2021 Stinger; 2006- 2010 Sedona; 2017-2019 Cadenza; and 2016-2018 K900 vehicles — which were also the subject of recalls by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nNHTSA’s recall notices said Hyundai and Kia strongly urged the owners of affected vehicles to park their cars outside and away from homes and other structures until their vehicles could be repaired. NHTSA said the anti-lock brake system module could malfunction and cause an electrical short, leading to an engine compartment fire while parked or driving. The HECU, or hydraulic electronic control unit, is a component of the ABS module that was blamed for the fires.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by Elizabeth A. Fegan and Jonathan D. Lindenfeld of Fegan Scott LLC, Steve W. Berman, Thomas E. Loeser and Rachel E. Fitzpatrick of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, Jonathan M. Jagher of Freed Kanner London and Millen LLC, Katrina Carroll and Todd D. Carpenter of Lynch Carpenter LLC, Jennifer A. Lenze of Lenze Lawyers PLC, J. Barton Goplerud of Shindler Anderson Goplerud and Weese PC, and Rosemary M. Rivas, David Stein and Rosanne L. Mah of Gibbs Law Group LLP.\n\nThe case is Ramtin Zakikhani et al. v. Hyundai Motor Co. et al., case number 8:20-cv-01584, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nSource: Law360\n\nHyundai, Kia Car Thefts Soar Despite Security Upgrade\n\nTheft rates for Hyundai and Kia vehicles are soaring across the U.S. despite the automakers’ recently released security fixes.\n\nThe problem stems from the automakers’ refusal to implement industry-standard anti-theft technology in most of their vehicles. It is compounded by a proliferation of videos on Tik Tok and other social media demonstrating how simple it is to steal the vehicles using just a screwdriver and a USB cable.\n\nSeveral major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, have seen alarming annual increases in Hyundai and Kia thefts, despite the companies’ efforts to fix the problem. In Minneapolis, for example, police have received 1,899 Hyundai and Kia theft reports so far this year – almost 18 times the number of reported stolen in the same period last year.\n\nThe theft problem has been so bad that it’s driving up the grand larceny auto rate (GLA) and overall crime rate in many cities, forcing several major cities to sue the automakers over the burden it has put on city services.\n\nThe predicament is equally dire or worse for Hyundai and Kia drivers throughout the U.S. Not only must they deal with their vehicles being sitting ducks for theft, but some insurance companies have started refusing coverage for the 8.3 million vehicles affected by the problem. That leaves many drivers vulnerable to theft and dire financial hardship.\n\nThe industry standard anti-theft device is a computer chip in the key that matches a chip in the steering column. These theft immobilizers were standard in 96% of vehicles made by other manufacturers in 2015 yet present in little over one-quarter of Hyundai and Kia models from 2011-2022.\n\nThe lack of a recall is another part of the problem. If NHTSA had compelled an official recall, drivers could have been alerted to the problem more effectively. As it is, most drivers of the affected vehicles aren’t aware of the problem unless they saw something about it on the news or heard it from another second-hand source.\n\nSo far, just 210,000 of the 4.5 million affected Kia vehicles have been fixed with the new software upgrades – less than 5%. The rate of repair isn’t much better for Hyundai. Only 225,000 of the 3.8 million Hyundai vehicles, about 6%, have been fixed.\n\nSources: Associated Press and National Public Radio\n\nFord Recalls 310,000 Trucks To Fix Problem With Driver’s Front Airbag\n\nFord has recalled 310,000 trucks to fix drivers’ front airbag problems. The recall covers certain F-250, F-350, F-450, and F-550 Super Duty trucks from the 2016 model year. The company says dust can accumulate in a cable inside the steering wheel, interrupting the electrical connection. Ford says it’s unaware of any crashes or injuries caused by the problem. Dealers will replace the steering wheel wiring assembly at no cost to owners, who will be notified starting July 5. Owners may hear popping or clicking noises inside the steering wheel or steering wheel switches, and the horn might not work. They may also see an airbag warning light notifying them of the problem.\n\nStellantis Recalls 220,000 Jeep Cherokees Due To Fire Risk\n\nStellantis is recalling nearly 220,000 Jeep Cherokee SUVs worldwide due to an electrical defect that can spark a fire. As a precaution, the automotive manufacturer advised owners of affected models from 2014 to 2016 to park their SUVs outside and away from other vehicles.\n\nWater can enter the liftgate control computer and cause an electrical short that can trigger a fire. These fires can occur even with the engine turned off. The company discovered the issue during a routine review of customer data. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports 50 customer assistance records, 23 warranty claims, and 21 field reports related to the issue. Stellantis says it is not aware of any injuries related to the defect.\n\nThe company has not yet determined how to repair the problem. It will notify owners by letter beginning June 30.\n\nIn 2015 and 2017, Stellantis recalled many of the same vehicles to fix a similar problem. Vehicles affected by previous recalls will still need the latest repair.\n\nJeep Cherokee owners can check their vehicle identification number (VIN) to see if their vehicles are affected by visiting the NHTSA website at www.nhtsa.gov. Owners with questions can contact Stellantis at 800-853-1403 and reference recall number 49A.\n\nSources: Associated Press and Cars.com\n\nRear-View Camera Display Prompts Ford To Recall 422,000 SUVs\n\nFord Motor Co. has expanded a recall it issued in 2021 over a defect in several models’ rear-view cameras. The latest recall includes 422,000 SUVs in addition to the 620,246 Ford recalled in 2020 over another problem with its vehicles’ rear-view cameras.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched an investigation in 2021 following the first recall. The ongoing investigation will determine if the vehicles were recalled promptly and if it included an adequate number of vehicles. The agency said the defect could increase the risk of an accident because a driver’s rear visibility decreases without the image a rear-view camera provides.\n\nWhile it is “working together with suppliers to identify root cause and provide the correct remedy as quickly as possible,” Ford says the claims of vehicles experiencing loss of rear-view camera functionality are increasing. In 2022, the automaker had 17 reports of minor crashes due to the defect and over 2,100 warranty reports. According to Reuters, in April, Ford confirmed 29 claims of vehicles reporting malfunctioning screens after receiving the 2023 recall repair. The company said there were 250 warranty reports and a minor crash related to faulty rear-view camera images despite the vehicles involved in the reports having the 2023 recall repair.\n\nFord plans to mail notification letters on June 26.\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nTRUCKING LITIGATION\n\nWrongful Death Lawsuit Against Tractor-Trailer Driver, Employer And Others\n\nMike Andrews, a lawyer in our Personal Injury & Products Liability Section, represents the widow, Gabrielle Celeste Reaves, whose husband was killed in a crash with a Conway Courier Service tractor-trailer truck driven by its employee Roy Earl Jackson. Mike is working with co-counsel Jeffrey L. Edwards, PA., in Oklahoma.\n\nDuring the fatal crash, Steven Hunter Reaves was traveling northbound on Oklahoma State Highway 351 in Muskogee County on April 16, 2021, in a 2004 Dodge 1500 pickup truck. One of the defendants in the case, Mr. Jackson, was driving the Conway Courier Service tractor-trailer southbound on the highway. Mr. Jackson lost control of his vehicle as he approached the portion of the highway Mr. Reaves was traveling. Mr. Jackson’s tractor departed from the roadway to the left, striking the cable barrier, crossing the center median and entering the highway’s northbound lanes. His tractor-trailer crashed into Mr. Reaves’ passenger vehicle with tremendous force, killing Mr. Reaves.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to hold Mr. Jackson accountable for failing to operate his tractor-trailer safely and Conway Courier Services for hiring a negligent driver and failing to train Mr. Jackson to operate its commercial vehicle properly and safely. The plaintiffs are also seeking to hold PACCAR, the maker of the Peterbilt tractor-trailer involved and defendants Dana Incorporated and Nucor Incorporated, makers of the tractor-trailer’s components, including the front axle assembly and bolts to the front axle assembly. The lawsuit claims the truck and its components were defective and/or unreasonably dangerous in their design, manufacture, warnings and/or marketing. They failed to protect those involved in the crash.\n\nIn fact, PACCAR recalled 18,000 Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks, including the one involved in this case, a year after Mr. Reaves’ fatal crash due to a defect in the tractor-trailer and its components’ design. The notice explains that “[t]he Dana D-Series axle steer arm fasteners that attach the steering arm to the steering knuckle may fail. Fastener failure can result in a loss of steering control, increasing the risk of a crash or injury.” However, according to the recall notice, the defendant became aware of the defect as early as August 2020. The defendants failed to issue the recall in a timely manner before the defect contributed to Mr. Reaves’ death.\n\nThe case is Reaves v. Conway Courier Service, Inc., et al., filed in the Circuit Court of Faulkner County, Arkansas Civil Division, case number 23CV-21-775.\n\nWe will keep our readers updated on this case.

The plaintiffs in the case say that their loved ones experienced pain and suffering in the last six minutes of their lives and deserve justice through compensation to their families.\n\nCourt documents filed by Boeing lawyers earlier this year, and obtained by media outlets, question whether the victims experienced “enough” pain and suffering to result in receiving compensation. Boeing argues that human nature to hold on to hope even in terrifying circumstances, combined with the aircraft’s speed at impact, means those on board experienced a painless death.\n\nMike Andrews, a member of our Personal Injury & Products Liabilities Section who represents some relatives of family members killed in the crash, says:\n\nWithout question, the final moments of the lives on board Flight 302 were spent in sheer terror, all because of Boeing’s horrendous behavior. The company negligently designed a faulty aircraft, lied to federal inspectors, and ruthlessly sentenced those on board to death. There is not enough compensation for this blatant disregard for human life.\n\nPassengers of Flight 302 were on a four-month-old Boeing 737MAX when it crashed on March 10, 2019. The jet created a crater about 90 feet wide and 120 feet long, and the wreckage was driven up to 30 feet deep into the soil in Tulu Fara village near Bishoftu, Ethiopia.\n\nJonathan French, an expert testifying for Boeing, said:\n\nWhile passengers undoubtedly perceived the flight as scary, humans have a tendency to hold on to hope and not expect the worst. Ultimately, it is impossible to know the subjective experience of each occupant.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that pain and suffering damages are in order as their loved ones “undeniably suffered horrific emotional distress, pain and suffering, and physical impact/injury while they endured extreme G-forces, braced for impact, knew the airplane was malfunctioning, and ultimately plummeted nose-down to the ground at terrifying speed.”\n\nUnder Illinois law, where the case is being tried, there is some legal precedent for Boeing’s callous arguments. An American Airlines DC-10 passenger jet crashed outside Chicago in 1979. The court limited damages the plaintiffs, in that case, were seeking for mental distress due to the crash.\n\nWe will keep our readers updated on this ongoing Boeing litigation.

When industrial machinery is involved in the incident, a thorough investigation is necessary to determine if more than a worker’s compensation claim is available and should be pursued. While pursuing a worker’s compensation claim, our lawyers quite often will discover that faulty industrial machinery actually caused or contributed to the injury or death. A defective product claim should be considered when the injury is serious and disabling.\n\nAnother consideration involves the working conditions in which the client was injured. Many of these injuries take place in factories and plants, and it is essential to ascertain whether these facilities were compliant with OSHA regulations. Workplace safety regulations, though only applicable to employers, are relevant to product liability claims against machine manufacturers because the regulations require the proper guarding of recognized machine hazards.\n\nKendall Dunson and Ben Keen in our Atlanta office are currently handling a claim against the manufacturer and lessor of a machine used in tuna production. Our client worked for Chicken of the Sea in Chatham County, Georgia. She was performing a process known as recovery when she was injured. During recovery, the machine is shut off, and excess tuna is gathered from around and under parts of the equipment to be reused or discarded. While retrieving leftover tuna, the machine was activated, causing our client’s dominant hand to become entrapped in the machine for more than thirty minutes. She sustained a catastrophic injury resulting in the amputation of several fingers and nerve damage that causes constant pain and restricts her ability to use her dominant hand.\n\nOur client has been unable to obtain and maintain employment since her injury. She is essentially one-handed for the remainder of her life. In addition to preventing her from working, this injury prevents her from caring for her family as she did before her injury.\n\nDuring discovery, our lawyers obtained engineering documents from the manufacturer/lessor of the machine, wherein the company safety engineer recommended placing guarding around the area where our client was injured. The lawyers also determined that while the area was guarded for machines sold or leased in Europe, but not for machines sold or leased in the U.S. Essentially, the defendant protected European workers but left American workers exposed to the risk of injury. The case is set for trial in August.\n\nUnguarded industrial machines are always a possible factor in on-the-job injuries. In this field of law, it is recognized that effective guarding can eliminate a hazard to keep employees safe. Because this defendant recognized the hazard and proposed a solution that would have prevented our client’s injury, we will ask a jury to levy a verdict including compensatory and punitive damages to our client. Compensatory damages will make her whole for her pain, suffering, lost access to income and lost enjoyment of life. Punitive damages punish the defendant for knowingly exposing our client to a hazard it knew how to eliminate. We will update you on this matter after the trial.\n\nWe have a number of lawyers in our Personal Injury & Products Liability Section who specialize in on-the-job injury litigation. If you or someone you know has suffered an injury at the workplace, you can contact Sloan Downes, Section Director, and she will have one of these lawyers contact you. Sloan can be reached at 800-898-2034 or by email us using the form below.\n\nBeasley Allen Lawyers In Our Mobile Office File Workplace Injury Lawsuit Implicating Third-Party & Co-Employee Liability\n\nWyatt Montgomery, a lawyer in our Personal Injury & Products Liability Section based in our Mobile office, represents a young woman who had several toes amputated in an on-the-job accident while employed at Fortune Gulf States, LLC in Mobile County, Alabama. The young woman was searching for merchandise on the shelves of a warehouse when a co-worker backed over her foot with a forklift. Because the injury occurred while she was on the job, any legal action related to those injuries will be governed partly by Alabama’s Workers’ Compensation Act.\n\nAlabama Workers’ Compensation Act immunity laws prevent direct action against the employer and co-employees based on negligence. The law, however, does allow an injured employee to bring a claim against co-employees who removed safety devices from machinery. For this reason, when someone sustains a catastrophic injury or is killed while on the job, the facts surrounding the injury or death need to be thoroughly investigated to determine whether there is the potential for a third-party or co-employee case.\n\nFor instance, further investigation into the forklift incident revealed the backup alarm on the forklift had been disabled before the injury. Therefore, our lawyers filed suit against the co-employees who allegedly took part in removing that safety device. The lawsuit also alleges the forklift manufacturer remained responsible for its maintenance and upkeep and may also have played a role in removing the backup alarm from the forklift.\n\nWorkers’ compensation laws provide for medical care, a percentage of the injured worker’s weekly wage, and death benefits to a deceased worker’s dependents in case of death; however, the compensation provided under Alabama’s Workers’ Compensation Act falls drastically short of the amount often needed to compensate the injured worker or their family fully. Workers’ compensation laws typically do not account for damages such as mental anguish, pain and suffering, loss of consortium, loss of value of life, the full amount of lost wages, or punitive damages against those responsible for causing the injury. Fully investigating the facts surrounding an on-the-job injury for potential third-party or co-employee claims is essential to obtain full compensation for the client or their family.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers who handle workplace litigation have lots of experience in cases involving removing safety devices. Despite the difficulties of prosecuting these claims, they have obtained substantial recoveries for our clients. If you know of someone who has been catastrophically injured or killed while on the job, contact our Personal Injury & Products Liability Section Director Sloan Downes. She will have one of the lawyers in the section who handles workplace litigation get in touch with you. We would be honored to work with you.\n\nIf you have any questions about Wyatt’s case, contact him at 800-898-2034 or by email us using the form below.\n\nPREMISES LIABILITY LITIGATION\n\nShattered Hip While At The Atlanta Airport: Negligence In A Premises Case For The Direct Actions Of An Agent Or Employee\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers have handled many premises liability cases over the years. They have included cases occurring on the premises of an owner/occupier where the direct actions of an agent or employee of the owner/occupier injured the victim.\n\nIn one such case Beasley Allen lawyer Houston Kessler is handling, a client shattered his hip due to the direct actions of a wheelchair service provider while the client was at the Atlanta airport with his spouse. The victim was walking through the concourse when the attendant carelessly pushed a wheelchair into the victim as he was passing by, knocking him to the ground and breaking his hip.\n\nCases such as these often involve multiple theories of liability. While traditional premises liability actions based on the physical conditions of the property are indeed still at issue, theories of traditional or ordinary negligence based on the employee’s direct actions are also at play. Regardless of the theory of liability, however, the duty to act reasonably remains the same, and defendants are liable for any injuries sustained due to their failure to do so.\n\nParker Miller and Houston Kessler, lawyers in our Atlanta office, handle these types of cases, and numerous other premises liability and negligent security cases, across Georgia and in other states. If you have any questions about these cases, you can contact them at 800-898-2034 or by email us using the form below.\n\nClass Action Litigation\n\nNew F150, Expedition And Navigator Brake Defect Class Action Lawsuit Filed\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers in our Consumer Fraud & Commercial Litigation Section, have filed a new class action lawsuit that expands a very important existing class action lawsuit against Ford Motor Company (Ford) filed in the Eastern District of Michigan. This new class action follows Ford’s March 21, 2022, 22V-150 Safety Recall of the brake system in 2016-2018 F-150s and 2016-2017 Ford Expeditions and Lincoln Navigators. Ford has now issued three sequential and incomplete recalls for a brake system that it installed in these trucks and SUVs since 2012.\n\nFord limited all three recalls to trucks and SUVs equipped with one specific engine, the 3.5L GTDI Ecoboost when it should have recalled all engine packages paired with the defective brake system. This is particularly troubling because roughly half of all 2013-2019 F-150s that Ford sold were equipped with the 5.0L V8 engine package. Yet, these 5.0L V8-powered trucks feature the same brake system that loses hydraulic pressure in the front brakes but are not recalled.\n\nAnother troubling aspect of Ford’s deficient rolling recall scheme is that the company released the defective brake system in its Expeditions and Lincoln Navigators in calendar year 2015 but did not recall the SUVs until May 2022. These belatedly recalled SUVs contained the same brake system Ford recalled in May 2016 due to the system’s high failure rates in the F-150 truck platform. Meaning Ford has known since well before 2016 that this brake system was defective and dangerous. Yet, it waited seven years to warn purchasers of the oldest affected Ford and Lincoln SUVs. Ford’s serious and calculated delay put peoples’ safety at risk.\n\nThe new complaint details the Texas plaintiff’s 2019 F150 master cylinder failure and the resulting harrowing crash in his non-recalled V8-equipped truck. These trucks and SUVs, no matter the engine package, are at risk for either external brake fluid escape or internal brake fluid bypass, both of which cause loss of the front brakes and shift the responsibility of braking to the rear brakes.\n\nBoth brake pressure failure modes create a sudden hazard for occupants in the disabled trucks and SUVs and other vehicles on the road around them. Ford contends these serious safety hazards should be handled with underinclusive and slow-rolling serial recall campaigns.\n\nFor those vehicles affected but not recalled, Ford apparently expects those customers to learn of the defect through personal experience or word of mouth. Likewise, the automaker expects them to seek dealership repair at their own expense. Ford is wrong and is putting people in danger.\n\nOn April 8, 2022, U.S. District Court Judge Gershwin A. Drain held that the plaintiffs’ defect claims in Weidman, et. al. v. Ford Motor Co. were right for a consolidated jury trial by certifying a Rule 23(c)(4) issues class for all persons who purchased or leased in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas a 2013-2018 Ford F-150 equipped with a Hitachi made step-bore master cylinder not included in Ford 2020 safety recall. Judge Drain held that common questions of fact exist and warrant a jury’s decision—namely, whether there is a brake system defect in the class vehicles, whether Ford had pre-sale knowledge of the brake system defect, and whether the brake system defect is material.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers and their co-counsel with Miller Law Firm PC, Dicello Levitt and Lieff Cabraser Heimann Bernstein, LLP, notified owners and lessees of all 2013-2018 F150 trucks in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia and Texas of the pending class action trial.\n\nDee Miles, who heads our Consumer Fraud & Commercial Litigation Section, was appointed by the court as Co-Lead Class Counsel and class representative according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g). Other Beasley Allen lawyers working on this case are Clay Barnett, who leads the trial team, and Mitch Williams, Dylan Martin, and Rebecca Gilliland.\n\nTesla Hit With Privacy Class Action\n\nA proposed class action has been filed against Tesla, highlighting several vehicle privacy concerns. Specifically, the lawsuit alleges the cameras on Tesla vehicles, outfitted with advanced driver-assistance systems, captured “highly invasive” videos and images of vehicle owners, their homes, and their private activities.\n\nThe cameras are used for the vehicles’ Autopilot systems, which rely on the cameras and other sensors to perform certain driving functions, such as steering, navigating, turning, changing lanes, accelerating, and braking. However, a human driver still has to be behind the wheel. Some recordings captured by the cameras appear to have been made when cars were parked and turned off.\n\nIt asserts in the complaint that Tesla has repeatedly assured its customers that their “privacy is and will always be enormously important to us,” that the cameras in its vehicles are “designed from the ground up to protect your privacy,” and that “camera recordings remain anonymous” and are not linked to a specific customer or vehicle. However, from 2019 to 2022, Tesla employees allegedly viewed and shared these sensitive videos and images collected from customers’ cars for their own “tasteless and tortious entertainment” rather than for legitimate business purposes.\n\nIn particular, Tesla employees accessed and circulated recordings of Tesla customers in private and embarrassing situations without their consent. Employees also captured images of family pets, embellished them with captions or commentary, and posted them in group chats. While some private videos and images were only shared between a few employees, others were viewed by “scores” of Tesla employees. And, according to the complaint, many of these videos and images were very likely shared, “as is common with internet culture,” with persons outside the company.\n\nThe complaint seeks a nationwide class and a California subclass and includes counts for intrusion upon seclusion; violations of California’s Constitutional right to privacy; violation of the California Unfair Competition Law; violation of the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act; negligence; breach of contract; negligent misrepresentation; intentional misrepresentation; and unjust enrichment. We will keep our readers posted on any new developments in this case.\n\nSource: Reuters and The Guardian\n\n$20 Million Settlement For Robinhood’s Data Breach Gets Final Approval\n\nA $20 million settlement agreement between class plaintiffs and Robinhood Financial LLC, a stock-trading app platform, received final approval last month. The plaintiffs alleged that Robinhood failed to protect approximately 40,0000 customer accounts from a significant data breach.\n\nU.S. District Judge Susan van Keulen gave final approval to the agreement saying the settlement “balances the strength of plaintiffs’ claims against the risk, expense, complexity and likely duration of further litigation, including the possibility of protracted appeals.” Judge van Keulen also had this to say:\n\nEven after this court ruled on two motions to dismiss, there are still a wide range of issues left to be decided regarding liability. The parties have avoided the risk by agreeing to an aggregate claims amount of $500,000, which the court finds to be in the best interest of the settlement class.\n\nThe settlement concludes two years of “vigorous” litigation that began when plaintiff Siddharth Mehta filed a lawsuit in January 2021. Mr. Mehta said the trading platform did not use industry-standard security measures to block third parties’ improper access to the app’s customers’ accounts.\n\nJudge van Keulen reduced the number of claims by half in the class action lawsuit in May 2021 for deficient claims for breach of contract and of the Customer Records Act, the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, the False Advertising Law and the fraud-related portion of the California Unfair Competition Law – findings by a magistrate judge. Those removed from the class action were allowed to replead with amended claims. The litigation began discovery, and the court rejected another motion to dismiss. The class members and defendant began mediation and reached a settlement agreement in May 2022, with Judge van Keulen giving preliminary approval to the deal in August 2022.\n\nClass members include Robinhood users in the U.S. whose accounts unauthorized users were able to access between Jan.1, 2020, and April 27, 2022. The defendant agreed to pay class members certain out-of-pocket costs up to $260 each up to a $500,000 cap and provide two years of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to class members, which could be worth approximately $19.5 million. The trading platform also agreed to several data security improvements. Court documents show 3,075 valid claims filed, and 400 class members opted for credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. No written objections to the settlement were entered. Judge van Keulen approved $5,000 service awards for class representatives Kevin Kian and Michael Furtado. Mr. Mehta opted for individual arbitration.\n\nThe case does not affect claims in separate ongoing litigation against Robinhood for a data security incident the company confirmed publicly on Nov. 8, 2021. The plaintiffs in that litigation claim that the incident exposed millions of customers’ personal information.\n\nThe plaintiffs and settlement class are represented by Julie Erickson, Elizabeth Kramer and Kevin Osborne of Erickson Kramer Osborne LLP.\n\nThe case is Siddharth Mehta et al. v. Robinhood Financial LLC et al., case number 5:21-cv-01013, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\nSource: Law360\n\nClass Action Lawyers At Beasley Allen\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers remain heavily involved in class action litigation around the country.

This ruling goes as far as to refuse to view valuable actions not directly related to billing as possible kickbacks. There is currently a circuit split about what evidence is needed to prove that a kickback caused a false claim to be made. This ruling undercut the Anti-Kickback Statute’s provision that discusses prohibited remuneration as “anything-of-value.”\n\nOther appellate court circuits, including the Third and Eighth Circuits, have weighed in on this issue. The Third Circuit requires a connection between the kickback and then the reimbursement claim. The Eighth Circuit took a different approach requiring plaintiffs to prove that the defendant would not have done the service without receiving the illegal kickbacks, which is most closely related to the Sixth Circuit’s recent decision.\n\nThe increase in cases that widen this circuit split also enhances the likelihood that a petition will be filed with the U.S. Supreme Court to address the split. In this term, the Court is already reviewing the FCA’s scienter standard, so it may address both issues at this time.\n\nBeasley Allen’s Qui Tam Team monitors issues related to this circuit split.

While Eli Lilly said then that it would fight the verdict, last month, U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber tripled the damages to nearly $187 million as required by the False Claims Act (FCA).\n\nWhistleblower Ronald Streck filed the lawsuit against Eli Lilly in 2014, accusing the company of deliberately miscalculating drug rebates owed to the Medicaid program by omitting retroactive drug price increases from its rebate calculations.\n\nMr. Streck filed the FCA suit on behalf of the U.S. government in 2014. He and his lawyers chose to move forward with the case after the U.S. Department of Justice declined to intervene. The FCA requires that anyone who knowingly submits or causes to submit false claims to the government is liable for three times the damages.\n\nIn his 2014 lawsuit, Mr. Streck claimed the drugmaker failed to give the government its full cut of more than $500 million it received in clawbacks from pharmaceutical wholesalers. According to the suit, the alleged scheme violated the FCA and 26 states’ laws.\n\nJudge Leneinweber noted that Eli Lilly had stopped the practices at the center of the FCA lawsuit years before the trial. Ultimately, however, that did not factor in his decision to impose “minimal, if any, penalties,” as Eli Lilly’s lawyers had requested.\n\nThe jury found that Eli Lilly shorted the federal and state governments $61,229,217. That amount tripled comes to $183.687.651, Judge Leinenweber confirmed.\n\nEli Lily is represented by Daniel Miller, Derek Cohen and Jonathan DeSantis of Walden Macht & Haran LLP, Michael Behn of Behn & Wyetzner Chtd. and Robert Jackson Martin IV of Martin Law PC.\n\nThe case is U.S. et al. v.

The ophthalmology distributor had argued that the verdict was unconstitutionally excessive. U.S. District Judge M. Wilhelmina Wright disagreed, finding the jury had correctly calculated liability and that the defendant was early in its argument that the verdict was unconstitutionally excessive.\n\nThe judge explained that other arguments the defendants made, including the judgment amount allegedly being unconstitutionally excessive, should have been filed after the judgment was entered in post-trial motions. Judge Wright cautioned that “the parties should be mindful that it is highly unlikely that the Court will revisit any of the legal conclusions made prior to or during trial.” For the upcoming briefing, she advised the defendants to focus on issues the court hasn’t resolved, such as the unconstitutionally excessive judgment or requesting a greater settlement offset.\n\nThe jury hit Cameron-Ehlen, dba Precision Lens, and its founder Paul Ehlen with just over $489.5 million in combined damages and penalties under the FCA ruling. “The [c]ourt concludes independently that this amount is an accurate calculation,” Judge Wright said. However, she also slightly reduced the verdict to about $487.05 million to offset a previous settlement related to the case.\n\nFormer Precision Labs executive Kip Fesenmaier blew the whistle on his employer in 2013. He accused Precision Labs of paying kickbacks to doctors in the form of luxury travel and sports and theater tickets to entice them into buying medical supplies from the company. The government stepped into the suit in 2018.\n\nThe jury found that Precision Labs violated the FCA, resulting in just shy of $43.7 million in damages to Medicare. Under FCA’s treble damages provision, this amount tripled to about $131.1 million. The jury also determined that the distributor made more than 64,575 false claims to Medicare as part of the kickback scheme, resulting in nearly $358.45 in penalties.\n\nThe government is represented by Ann M. Bildtsen, Chad A. Blumenfield, Bahram Samie and Andrew Tweeten of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota.\n\nFesenmaier is represented by Jennifer Verkamp, Sonya A. Rao and Chandra Napora of Morgan Verkamp LLC.\n\nThe case is U.S. ex rel. Fesenmaier v.

Woods of the Southern District of New York granted preliminary approval to a $1 billion settlement by Wells Fargo. The deal resolves securities fraud claims brought by shareholders. Named plaintiffs include the Swedish pension fund Handelsbanken Fonder AB, the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, and the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi.\n\nThe class action suit, filed in June 2020, accused former Wells Fargo executives and a director of making false and misleading statements about the bank’s progress in consent orders imposed by regulators in 2018. The consent orders resulted from the fallout of the bank’s fake accounts scandal. It is believed that the securities class action settlement will be among the 20 largest of its kind if finalized.\n\nThe lawsuit stemmed from a significant price drop in Wells Fargo stock in March 2020, just as congressional hearings on Wells Fargo’s consent order compliance were wrapping up. One issue with the lawsuit was the “disentangling” of the stock price drop from the overall market volatility that erupted just as COVID-19 lockdowns occurred.\n\nA Wells Fargo representative said the bank disagrees with the accusations but is pleased to have the matter resolved. The case took less than three years to resolve the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ lawyers said the settlement will help compensate hundreds of thousands of investors, such as state employees, nurses, teachers, police and firefighters. The bank’s fraudulent business practices impacted these investors’ retirement savings.\n\nWells Fargo continues operating under the asset cap by the Federal Reserve, which prohibits the bank from growing beyond $1.95 trillion. It continues facing other regulatory and litigation matters, including a shareholder derivative suit against the bank in California state court over the same compliance with consent order issues at the heart of the federal settlement.\n\nThe case is Fulton County et al. v. Wells Fargo & Co. et al., case number 1:21-cv-01800, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nSource: Law360\n\nJury Awards Investors $95 Million Against Deutsche Bank For Fraud\n\nA federal district court jury in Florida has returned a $95 million verdict against Deutsche Bank. The jury found the bank negligent for turning a blind eye to warning signs of fraud in accounts maintained at the bank by perpetrators of a Ponzi scheme who stole $155 million from unwary investors.\n\nSix men operated the Ponzi scheme through an investment advisory firm, Biscayne Capital International LLC, and a supposed real estate development company, South Bay Holdings. The fraudsters raised money by convincing investors to buy securities backed by the assets of South Bay Holdings, which they falsely told investors were building real estate in South Florida. In reality, the men used the funds to pay other investors, cover their expenses and pay themselves millions of dollars until the Ponzi scheme went bust, as all Ponzi schemes do.\n\nThe fraudsters established a company called Madison Asset LLC and, operating under that name, set up four companies in the Cayman Islands which were used to issue the securities sold to investors. Madison Asset opened an account at Deutsche Bank and later opened sub-accounts at the bank in the name of the Cayman Island entities, which held the securities and investors’ funds used to purchase the securities. Instead of using this money to develop real estate as promised, the fraudsters wired the money to hundreds of beneficiaries worldwide.\n\nThe Ponzi scheme was perpetrated by Frank Chatburn, Juan Carlos Cortes, Roberto Cortes, Ernesto Weisson, Fernando Haberer and Gustavo Trujillo—all men other than Juan Carlos Cortes were indicted. Chatburn, Weisson and Trujillo pled guilty, and Chatburn was sentenced to 42 months in prison in December 2019.\n\nThe plaintiffs are the liquidators of the four Cayman Island companies which went bankrupt when the Ponzi scheme collapsed. The plaintiffs sued Deutsche Bank in 2021, alleging that the bank ignored warning signs of fraud and asserted claims for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent trading and aiding and abetting the perpetrators of the Ponzi scheme. Among other wrongdoing, plaintiffs alleged the following in their complaint:\n\nThat Deutsche Bank allowed Madison Asset to open accounts in the name of the Cayman Island companies without documentation of authority to act on the investors’ behalf,\n\nThat the bank knew the funds in the account were supposed to be used to develop real estate yet were constantly being wired out to hundreds of beneficiaries all over the world for over two years,\n\nThat bank employees were expressing concern about the large number of wire transfers and beneficiaries, and\n\nThat bank employees even went to Deutsche Bank’s compliance department to inform the compliance group that the accounts may be being used to engage in money laundering.\n\nThe bank ultimately threatened to freeze assets of Madison Asset after a large number of multi-million dollar overdrafts but did not.\n\nThe case finally went to trial on April 10, 2023. After the plaintiffs rested their case, Deutsche Bank moved for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that it owed no fiduciary duties to the Cayman Island companies and that its customer agreements limited the bank’s responsibility. The motion was denied.\n\nAfter a three-week trial, the Florida jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs on the negligence count and awarded damages of $95 million.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers are involved in prosecuting at least two Ponzi scheme class action cases, and there will be more. Financial scams are rising, and our law firm is committed to rectifying these wrongs.\n\nOur Financial Fraud Litigation Team includes these lawyers: Dee Miles, Demet Basar and James Eubank .

He said the parties satisfied each element required for approving class settlements he is likely to give it his final approval in September.\n\nLead plaintiff Union Asset Management Holding AG and other investors filed the lawsuit in 2019, days after Kraft Heinz disclosed that the SEC had subpoenaed it for its accounting records. The company also announced at the time that it had written down the value of its iconic Kraft and Oscar Meyer brands by $15.4 billion. The announcement led to a $12 billion drop in the company’s stock market value.\n\nThe SEC charged Kraft and its executives with improperly managing expenses and engaging in deceptive accounting practices over several years. The practices included “misleading transactions, millions in bogus cost savings, and a pervasive breakdown in accounting controls,” the agency reported, noting that the fraudulent activity harmed the company’s stockholders.\n\nAfter the 2015 merger of H.J. Heinz Co. and Kraft Foods Group Inc, company execs found far fewer cost-saving “synergies” between the companies than expected. Investors alleged that the company and 3G then implemented several cost-cutting measures that eroded its supply chain, alienated vendors, tarnished solid brand names, and drove off customers.\n\nInvestors accused Kraft-Heinz and Brazilian private equity firm 3G of implementing widespread and deceptive accounting practices to mask its substantial losses. The agreement provides pro rata shares of the settlement fund after deductions for attorney fees and other related costs, no matter how many claims are filed in the case. Many of the thousands of class members are large retail institutions. If any institutional investors disagree with the settlement, they will have time for Judge Alonso to hear and consider their objections.\n\nThe class is co-led by Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check LLP and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP.\n\nThe case is Hedick v.

These toxic particles and fumes can cause asthma, irritation to the respiratory tract, and cancer-causing effects on organs like the lungs and kidneys.\n\nSince this voluntary recall, Philips asked users to register their devices on its website to facilitate device replacement. Philips reported on its website that 2,460,000 “new replacement devices and repair kits” have been shipped to the U.S. The FDA is now clarifying that this number is inaccurate. The actual number is considerably less since Philips included manufactured repair kits shipped internally to its facilities. The FDA further stated its concern that this inaccurate estimation will impact the wait time for users to receive new devices.\n\nTo further complicate Philips’ remediation attempts, the FDA has issued a Class 1 recall, the most serious type of recall, for certain reworked DreamStation machines. This recall was issued because machines were assigned “inaccurate or duplicate serial numbers during initial programming.” This error causes devices to deliver the wrong prescription or factory settings or to deliver therapy to the user at all. Errors of this kind can lead to respiratory failure, heart failure, serious injury, and even death.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers are investigating claims for the users of the recalled CPAP machines who have suffered from the adverse effects of the recalled Philips Respironics machines.

A number of lawsuits against formula manufacturers are currently pending in federal court and have been centralized in a multidistrict litigation (MDL), pending before Judge Rebecca R. Pallmeyer.\n\nJudge Pallmeyer recently entered a discovery protocol for potential bellwether and trial selection. The protocol limits the type and scope of discovery so that the parties can obtain adequate information to determine if a case should move forward to the bellwether trial without taking on the burden of full discovery. The order also allows for more in-depth discovery of the cases selected to proceed to trial. Judge Pallmeyer’s ruling did not outline a protocol for expert discovery but promised to address the topic in a future order. At this time, we anticipate trials for these cases will begin in Spring 2024.\n\nLawsuits filed against formula manufacturers in state courts, including many handled by Beasley Allen, also continue to move through the discovery process. In late March, Judge Dennis Ruth denied several of the defendant’s motions to dismiss and transfer venue motions. We hope these orders will allow these pending cases to begin moving toward a trial date.\n\nDavid Dearing and Brittany Scott, lawyers in our firm’s Mass Torts Section, are aggressively investigating and filing these cases.

The invitation asks the FDA, on behalf of the U.S., to submit its views on two questions.\n\nShould the Plaintiff’s Proposed Warning be added to the acetaminophen labels?\n\nAs of today, does science warrant the addition to acetaminophen labels of any warning or advice regarding in-utero exposure to acetaminophen and the risk of ASD or ADHD?\n\nAcetaminophen has been touted as safe for use in pregnant women for years. Yet, acetaminophen manufacturers and retailers know the risk of prenatal exposure to acetaminophen causes autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There are now over 100 lawsuits pending against the manufacturers and major retailers who sell generic versions of Tylenol.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers are investigating these claims.
