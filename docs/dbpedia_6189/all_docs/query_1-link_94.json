        "text": "The Columbia History of Chinese Literature, edited by Victor H. Mair. New York: Columbia University Press, 2001. Pp. xx + 1342. $78 (hardbound). It is difficult enough to write the history of a national literature where this history is relatively short, as in Russian or American literature. The problem becomes exponentially larger with a national literature that spans three millennia, and, measured by sheer volume of text, might well be larger than all other national literatures combined. Yet writing a history of Chinese literature is not impossible. Over the last century, a number of efforts have been made in various languages: many in Chinese, a good number in Japanese, and about twenty in European languages, including a few in English (none of which are mentioned in the book under review). Writing yet another history of Chinese literature has to take this fact into account because each new such history is built-not always consciously-on previous efforts. To a greater extent than is sometimes acknowledged, our own limitations are inherited. In some particular instances we might be successful in transcending this heritage; but for the larger part, we remain confined to it. Each new history of literature inevitably joins the process of canonizing, anthologizing, and tradition-making that is, to no small extent, the very subject under study. Thus, the conventional version of Chinese literary history that matches particular genres with particular dynasties-Han fu ,i, Tang shi * , Song ci *I-J, Yuan quiP , Ming-Qing xiaoshuo KAV /J\\TR-is the direct result of such history-cum-canonization. This scheme simultaneously mirrors and confirms the prevalent research interests in Chinese literature, perpetuating the limitations of past inquiry as expectations for future work. Once accepted in a scholarly community, the reproduction of the conventional version reigns as a matter of convenience for all. As the editor of The Columbia History of Chinese Literature (hereafter: CHCL), Victor H. Mair submits that his volume transcends such limitations. In his own characteristic words, offered in the \"Prolegomenon\" (pp. xi-xiii) and \"Preface\" (xv-xviii), he declares that his history includes \"the latest findings of critical scholarship\" (p. xii). It is a work where \"the history of Chinese literature is seen through entirely new prisms that transcend both time and genre\" (p. xii). It is a volume packed \"with as much basic information as possible\" (p.xv) and built upon \"rigorous marshalling of evidence\" (p. xvi). It is also a history that \"touches on such matters as the fuzzy interface between ?Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 26 (2004)\n\nBetween the 17th and 18th century the European ‘Republic of Letters’ was characterised by a great interest in the ‘Other’ and the fascination with different, ‘exotic’ cultures. In this cultural environment, the Jesuit missionaries in China acted as a ‘bridge’ between the two continents exchanging information and books from each side. This paper discusses the use of the concept of ‘agency’ as applied to Chinese books, analysing how they were subjected to actions and, in turn, were capable of action, in this specific European context. The aim of this paper is to reflect how the agency of these texts conflicts and coincides with the agency of other actors connected with this trans-cultural process.\n\nAmazon: https://amzn.to/3gLOt5l ; Routledge: https://bit.ly/3uTf0Wo What is a detail? How is it different from xijie, its Chinese counterpart? Is \"reading for the details\" fundamentally different from \"reading for the plot\"? Did xijie xiaoshuo, the Chinese novel of details, give the world its earliest form of modern fiction? Inspired by studies of vision and modernity as well as cinema, this book gazes out on the larger world through the small aperture of the detail, highlighting how concrete literary minutiae become \"telling\" as they reveal the dynamics of seeing and hearing, the vibrations of the mind, the complexity of the everyday, and the imperative to recognize the minute, the humble, and the hidden. In a strain of masterpieces of xijie xiaoshuo, such details play a key role in pivoting the novel from didacticism towards a capacious modern form. Examining the Chinese detail as both a common idiom and a unique concept, and extrapolating it from individual works to the culture at large, reveals underexplored areas of the Chinese novel: its psychological depths, its connections with other genres and forms, its partaking in Chinese material life and capitalist modernity, as well as repressions and difficulties surrounding its reception in national and international contexts. With carefully chosen case studies, Xiao's book not only exemplifies the value of deep reading in approaching complex works of Chinese fiction as world literature, it also throws light on the aesthetics and politics of \"the unseen,\" which has become central to a humanist tradition that flows across literature, cinema, and other art forms."
