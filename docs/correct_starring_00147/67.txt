Edward Scissorhands (1990) is a fantasy romance starring Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder and Dianne Wiest.

A scientist builds an animated human being -- the gentle Edward, played by Depp. However, the scientist dies before he can finish assembling Edward leaving the young man with scissor blades instead of hands. Loving suburban saleswoman Peg, played by Wiest, discovers Edward and takes him home, where he falls for Peg's teen daughter, played by Ryder. Though at first accepted for his kindness and artistic talent, Edward's hands eventually make him an outcast.

According to the critics: The first collaboration between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands is a magical modern fairy tale with gothic overtones and a sweet center.
