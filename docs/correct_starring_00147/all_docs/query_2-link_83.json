        "text": "EDWARD Scissorhands was released in 1990 and has now become a fan favourite film.\n\nTim Burton directed the movie which starred Winona Ryder.\n\nWho were the cast of Edward Scissorhands?\n\nJohnny Depp played the lead Edward Scissorhands and was nominated for a Golden Globe in the Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical category.\n\nThis is just one of Depp's starring roles as she has gone on to have quite the career starring in the likes of Pirates of the Caribbean, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Sleepy Hollow.\n\nWinona Ryder played Edward's love interest Kim Boggs in the movie.\n\nShe went on to receive a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress for her role.\n\nShe's also had a big career, landing roles in Friends and Gone in the Night.\n\nOscar winner Dianne Wiest played the role of Peg Boggs, the kind lady who took Edward in after the passing of his inventor.\n\nOther cast members include:\n\nJim - played by Anthony Michael Hall\n\nKevin Boggs - played by Robert Oliveri\n\nBill Boggs - played by Oscar winner Alan Arkin\n\nJoyce - played Kathy Baker\n\nOfficer Allen - played by Dick Anthony Williams\n\nYou may even spot Nick Carter from Backstreet Boys who appeared as a neighbourhood extra in the movie.\n\nHow old was Winona Ryder in Edward Scissorhands?\n\nWinona was just 19 years old when she filmed Edward Scissorhands.\n\nHer character, Kim, was 17.\n\nShe had previously starred in Beetlejuice and Frankenweenie, both directed by Burton.\n\nHow old was Johnny Depp in Edward Scissorhands?\n\nDepp was 26 years old when he was cast as the main character of Edward in the movie.\n\nEdward is an ageless being but his appearance is that of a teenager.\n\nHe too, worked on other films directed by Burton, most famously, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street.\n\nDepp and Burton have a friendship which spans decades after first working together on Edward Scissorhands.\n\nThe Los Angeles TImes reported that Johnny said of their friendship: \"Most of the times we’ve worked together he’s had to go into great big battles to get them to hire me. I feel so lucky to be along for the ride, more than a couple few times.\n\n\"For a lot of reasons. No. 1, Tim is a filmmaker I admire, but he’s much, much more than that.\n\n\"Without embarrassing him, he’s a true artist, which is something I wasn’t sure was possible in today’s cinema.\n\n\"But he’s the real thing. He’s a visionary, an auteur, totally uncompromising.\"\n\nIs Edward Scissorhands a Christmas movie?\n\nFans of the cult-classic love to put the film on during the festive period.\n\nBut can Edward Scissorhands be classed as a Christmas movie?\n\nMost would say yes. Despite the movie starting in the summer, it changes into a more wintery theme and does include Christmas later on.\n\nWho can forget Kim dancing whimsically in the ice shavings as Edward carves an angel out of ice?\n\nMost big movie reviewers believe that it should be considered a Christmas film.\n\nOne reviewer said: \"If 1984's Gremlins and 1988's Die Hard are considered Christmas films, then so is Edward Scissorhands. They're all filed under the unconventional Christmas movie category.\"\n\nHowever, some disagree and say that it is a all-rounder film which can be watched any time of year.\n\nWhere to watch and stream Edward Scissorhands\n\nYou can stream the movie on Disney+ with your subscription.\n\nIt is also available to rent or buy on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nYou can watch it on terrestrial TV on December 23, 2022, on BBC Two at 4.50pm and on BBC Three on December 28, 2022 at 8.40pm."
