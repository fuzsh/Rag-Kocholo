        "text": "Edward Scissorhands was never meant to exist.\n\nHowever his father-or known as 'The Inventor' thought not and one day taking notice of a dicing machine that he had once created he began to experiment. However because this is a very tragic movie things don't just go from A to B, instead the inventor is struck down by a illness. Oh and how ironically on the very day he planned to finish his grandest project... The first ever artificial person called (you guessed it) Edward Scissorhands.\n\nAs a product of a project gone wrong Edward spends his time hiding in 'The Inventor's' run down mansion, speed-trimming hedges with his Scissor-Hands and pondering about some deep philosophy undisturbed until Peg Boggs ventures in one day. Being the friendly and sociable type of person she takes pity on him and decides takes him home unaware of the commotion and trouble he would later cause and helps Edward settle down to his new life. Edward manages to fit in but things get ugly when Kim Boggs comes home from a camping trip and her boyfriend Jim and he has some plans too.\n\nI think that Tim Burton has done a great job in creating suspense and the props look very real for a 1990 film. I also felt very sympathetic for Edward because he was always misunderstood and kindhearted but many people thought he was the Devil or a monster from Hell. I also find it important to point out that it is important to have your own opinion and not to just believe in other people which is a moral clearly highlighted in Edward's case.\n\nOverall I found the movie entertaining and often melancholy but one flaw I can recall is that Burton stereotypes the people who live in the little village for example ALL the husbands go out to work in their cars and ALL the married women-there are no single women apart from possibly the christian lady-stay at home to do their thing. What I am trying to say is that this is a bit stereotypical and not everyone is like that. However apart from that I liked the whole movie though it made me feel quite sad, very sad at the end but I shall not give any spoilers away as I am meant to be encouraging people to watch this film so if you wan't my genuine advice?\n\nThen watch this 4 Star classical.\n\nPrint this review"
