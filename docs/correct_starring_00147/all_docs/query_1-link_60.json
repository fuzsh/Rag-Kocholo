Johnny Depp, Wynona Ryder, Dianne Wiest and Vincent Price star in this unforgettable fairy tale from Tim Burton. Once upon a time, a kindly inventor created a charming young man named Edward. But the inventor died before he finished Edward, who had sharp metal shears for hands. Edward was sad and alone until a kind Avon lady invited him to live with her family in the fantastical land of Suburbia.",

        "text": "This is one of Burton’s best and it’s one of aesthetic power and emotional resonance. It’s a magical odyssey of invention and human emotion, with a distinguishable tone and look. This one is for the weirdos.\n\nAugust 31, 2023\n\nTim Burton's most iconic film is a fairy tale about the way art is used to reflect on both traditional society and the artist's inability to fit into it.\n\nJune 26, 2023\n\n... this paean to misfit outcasts and misunderstood artists is ultimately a magical and melancholy fairy tale for the modern world.\n\nJanuary 7, 2023\n\nBurton was clearly in line with a poetic atmosphere but it escapes him in the end. [Full review in Spanish]\n\nNovember 2, 2022\n\nIt looks and feels original and new; startling, yet at the same time comforting.\n\nSeptember 22, 2022\n\nEdward Scissorhands is a flashy and entertaining apologia from an artist who has not accumulated enough work to justify such self-concern.\n\nMay 24, 2022\n\nThe highest praise must be reserved for Mr. Depp, who, as the hero, manages to evince a gentle charm in spite of being encrusted with several ounces of make-up.\n\nApril 6, 2022"
