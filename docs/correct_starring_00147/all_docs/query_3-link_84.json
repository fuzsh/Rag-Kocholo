        "text": "Hi! This guest post by Sha-Myra is a fantastic treatise on how the film Edward Scissorhands starring Johnny Depp showed how able-bodied people were perceived to have treated the disabled.\n\nEdward Scissorhands is a classic film.\n\nReleased December 7, 1990\n\nThe film depicts a young Johnny Depp as a scientist creation companion. However, his creator suddenly dies and he is left unfinished. As an actor, I found this film relatable.\n\nPoints that no one notices-In the film he has scissors for hands and there are many things that Edward can’t do, however despite his “handicap” he does amazing things for the fictional town and is the most genuine character out of everyone in the entire film.\n\nThis film was also one of the first times the main character carried a major mainstream film with a handicap.\n\nThe film shows many common stereotypes as well as major things that other people often ignore when interacting with someone who is disabled. Edward learns feelings of empathy, anger, love, resentment, remorse and confusion throughout the film despite his “deformity”.\n\nAs in real life, people focus on what’s in it for them instead of just appreciating simple qualities when befriending a person with disabilities.\n\nI also noticed that just like in real life everyone had their specific biased attitude toward Edward and were never concerned with what he wanted.\n\nHe was only cared for when he was useful or a spectacle. Once he became a nuisance everyone ignored him except the love interest depicted as a wide-eyed blonde played by Winona Ryder.\n\nThe film shows you as a whole why people with disabilities are treated badly and end up isolated often.\n\nDisabled people deserve the same chances to live and act as much as anyone else.\n\nDisabled people are not burdens or tragedies.\n\nDisabled people have a right to be treated with dignity and respect that we give others.\n\nDisabled people are not charity cases or inspirations.\n\nDisabled people deserve the human right to be themselves without needing to be useful.\n\nDisabled people are not children and do not need ableist people making their decisions and assuming superiority.\n\nThe Guest Blogger, Sha-Myra is a disability activist and huge film buff from DeKalb, Illinois. Sha-Myra believes in accurate media representation. She also performed in the theatre for six years."
