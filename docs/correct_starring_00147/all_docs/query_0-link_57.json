        "text": "Since it's arguably one of Johnny Depp's best movie roles, it's hard to imagine anyone else but the iconic actor in the title role in the 1990 film classic \"Edward Scissorhands.\" Perhaps more amazing, though, is that Depp went into his audition for the role thinking he had zero chance of being cast.\n\nSpeaking with Interview Magazine in 1998, Depp admitted that he experienced trepidation over the prospect of meeting with director Tim Burton since Edward Scissorhands was a role that the actor was desperately hoping to score. First thinking to himself that he didn't want to meet Burton, Depp eventually came around and recalled for Interview, \"I wanted to [meet with him], but I thought it was pointless. Tracey [Jacobs, Depp's agent] forced me to. I just said, 'No way, it's embarrassing.' You know, something you want so badly and he's never gonna see me as that, never.\"\n\nOne of the reasons why Depp was so afraid to meet Burton was because his biggest achievement before the film was starring as a co-lead in Fox's hit crime drama series \"21 Jump Street.\" As such, Depp told Interview, he imagined Burton was going to think, \"'Aaw, f***in' TV actor s***.' Everybody wanted that f***in' role, so I just thought, 'Hell, why would he give it to me?'\"\n\nUltimately, Tim Burton cast Johnny Depp in \"Edward Scissorhands,\" which marked the first of eight films together in Burton's and Depp's decades long working relationship. In his chat with Interview Magazine, Depp revealed how much he personally identified with Edward Scissorhands, which led him to feeling crushed as filming began to wrap.\n\n\"I remember it was the 89th day [of filming] â€” right before I did my last shot on the movie, which was doing the ice sculpture with Kim, Winona [Ryder]'s character,\" Depp told Interview. \"And I remember getting the makeup on, and everything, and looking in the mirror right before I went to set, and I'm thinking, 'F***, this is the last time I'm gonna see this guy,' you know, this is it, this is the last time. It was like saying goodbye.\"\n\nDepp told the publication that the moment was \"weird\" and \"bizarre,\" but it made him cry, nonetheless. \"I really, really, really miss him,\" Depp confessed to Interview.\n\nThe actor wasn't the only person to cry over \"Edward Scissorhands.\" On top of being a fantasy filled with humor, the film also has its share of heartbreak, which includes a scene that had fans in tears."
