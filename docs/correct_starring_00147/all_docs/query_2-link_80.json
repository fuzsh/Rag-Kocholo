        "text": "What was your favorite movie growing up? I was born in the mid 80s (I know I’m old lol) so anything made from 1990-2000 has a special place in my heart. That was an incredible decade for film. Rom-Com’s had reached their highest (You’ve Got Mail, My Best Friend’s Wedding), horror films were at their scariest (Silence of the Lambs, Scream) comedies were TRULY hysterical (Home Alone, Dumb and Dumber), even teen comedies were fabulous (10 Things I Hate About You, She’s All That - classics). Out of all of the many great movies throughout that decade, there is one that changed my life and the way I viewed the art of filmmaking: Edward Scissorhands .\n\nConceived by the brilliant Tim Burton and played by the legendary actor, Johnny Depp, this American fantasy romance film follows an artificial human named Edward who is created flawed by having scissors for hands. I won’t go too much into the summary of the film because many of you have already seen it (if not, what are you doing? Stop reading. Go rent it). I will admit there are a few spoiler alerts so proceed with caution. I knew filming for the movie had taken place near Tampa (the city north of me by an hour). I was determined to pay a visit to the filming locations and try to understand how 30 years later, this movie is still loved and adored by fans and critics around the world.\n\nThe Boggs Home\n\nIn the movie, Edward moves from his castle into The Boggs residence. The home where it was filmed is located just north of Tampa in a town called Lutz. This movie came out 31 years ago so much of the neighborhood has changed since then. I pulled up to the residence and the friendly owner, Joe, came outside to greet us with a big smile. He actually informed us that he was a dishwasher on the set of the movie so he got to witness a lot of the action. A die-hard fan like I am, Joe was nice enough to show us around the property.\n\nIn the movie, all of the homes were painted in pastel colors but as soon as the movie was finished shooting, they were painted back to their original colors. Those years in between, the home was pretty ordinary. When Joe bought the house less than a year ago, he painted the house back to a pastel lavender to pay homage to the movie. He took us into the backyard where the iconic ice sculpture scene was filmed. In this scene Kim Boggs, played by Winona Ryder, dances underneath Edward and realizes her love for him. Joe had turned the backyard into a beautiful garden where the cutest little nooks and crannies hung around and decorated the yard nicely. He even set up an area that will be used for movie nights, planning to rent out the space to fans like me. How amazing is that! We continued our tour into the house and saw that he had put back in the original kitchen wallpaper from the movie (the wallpaper with mushrooms on it - very groovy). What a treat to revert back to my childhood and walk around the same house where my favorite movie was filmed.\n\nThe streets look much different now too. During the movie, the houses were newly constructed and not many people lived in the development. There were no trees lining the streets. Joe informed me that the movie company had planted the trees once production was finished. Joe has a wealth of knowledge about the movie and loves Scissorhands fans, so hop in your car, go see the house and say hello to Joe! If you can’t make it all the way there, you can also check out his IG @official_scissorland (1774 Tinsmith Circle - Lutz, Florida). In regards to other filming locations, I ventured over to Lakeland, Florida where the salon scenes were filmed in the Southgate Shopping Center. Continued below…\n\nThe SouthGate Shopping Center\n\nWhen Edward becomes the hair stylist to everyone in town with his magical scissors, the townspeople want to give him his own salon. The salon scene where he gets seduced by the flirty red-headed neighbor Peg, was shot at The Southgate Shopping Center. I don’t know about you but looking at the majestic sign alone, I immediately recognized it from the movie. I will let you know what the drive here from Lutz took me about an hour to get to; the locations are not close together. That being said, it was definitely worth the drive! If you are visiting Southwest Florida and you are a fan of the movie, you definitely should make a visit to these stops! My inner 90s film geek came out and I had such a blast :)"
