        "text": "Edward Scissorhands| 1990\n\nThe strange little pastel neighbourhood into which Avon lady Peg (Dianne Wiest) brings Edward Scissorhands (Johnny Depp), is Tinsmith Circle, Carpenters Run in Lutz, about five miles north of Tampa on Route 54, Florida.\n\nYou might be a tad disappointed to find that the neighbourhood is not actually painted in candy colours. And there’s none of Edward’s quirky topiary – no fewer than 44 of the houses here were given a temporary makeover for the movie.\n\nThe dinosaur-, elephant-, Elvis- and penguin-shaped bushes were nothing more than metal and chickenwire frames covered with greenery.\n\nThe entrance gates to the Gothic mansion were built at the west end of the Tinsmith Circle cul-de-sac."
