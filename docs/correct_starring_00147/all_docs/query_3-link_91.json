        "text": "NICK KILLMAN | CUB REPORTER\n\nI am reviewing the classic movie Edward Scissorhands. This movie was filmed and produced in the 1990’s. The director is Tim Burton, screenwriter is Caroline Thompson and some of the main actors include Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder. The movie is about a machine that has almost all the traits of a human except one thing, he has razor sharp scissors for hands. These scissors are not removable so it is something he has to live with. Edward lives in a castle until a friendly Avon lady discovers him and brings him to her very bland neighborhood. Needless to say his stay starts off very well and is accepted until certain events makes the neighborhood believe he is evil and the whole neighborhood turns against him.\n\nIn the beginning all the neighbors enjoy Edward because he is different. He entertains the neighborhood by doing things like cutting their bushes into crazy things, giving their dogs haircuts and even cutting the neighbor’s hair into very different hairstyles. Before he gets there the whole neighborhood is boring, but while he’s there he turns the neighborhood into a very divergent crowd. When Edward meets Kim and her friends, that is when things start going bad for Edward. He gets blamed for things he didn’t do and is falsely accused of many bad things.\n\nWhile watching this movie I saw many signs and hints to greater ideas than just a Gothic robot with hands. The lighting, camera views, and colors used in the movie help to support the idea that Edward has many Gothic details, but inside he just wants to be nice and loved. This movie also shows how the teen crowd are such judgmental people and are rude to people that are different, which is exactly what is shown in this movie.\n\nThe colors used in this movie are symbolic of that character’s mood and heart, such as Edward always wearing black which symbolizes sadness, Peg always wears pink which symbolizes good heart and kindness. The evil Peg always wears red, which symbolized judgement and rudeness. Things like this really change how I look at the movie because it gives the movie a completely different vibe. Another sign is when Kim and Edward first gaze upon each other, Kim sees Edward in a reflection of a mirror, which I think symbolizes that Edward isn’t real in the sense of being human.\n\nOverall I believe this movie is very well written and played with many hidden details that you have to find yourself. When you find these details it changes your whole perspective of the movie in a very good and mysterious way. I would recommend this movie to anyone and any age. It has so many lessons and is also just a really good fairy tale/Gothic story."
