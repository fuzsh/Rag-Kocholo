        "text": "\"Says the lawyer for the man who convinced the world he had scissors for fingers?\" Heard responded in reference to \"Edward Scissorhands,\" the Tim Burton film in which Depp stars as a man who has scissors for fingers.\n\n\"I had listened to weeks of testimony — insinuating that, or saying quite directly that, you know, I'm a terrible actress. So I'm a bit confused how I could be both,\" Heard added.\n\nHeard's discussion with Guthrie is the first sitdown interview she has conducted since the conclusion of her defamation trial with her ex-husband Johnny Depp on June 1. After six weeks of testimony in Fairfax County, Virginia, jurors found both Johnny Depp and Amber Heard liable for defamation against each other.\n\nRelated stories\n\nDepp was awarded $15 million in damages after a jury found that Heard defamed him in a Washington Post op-ed. Depp was also found liable for defamation against Heard with the jury awarding the \"Aquaman\" star $2 million in damages.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Heard said she behaved in unrecognizable ways during her relationship with Depp.\n\n\"I did say and do regrettable things throughout my relationship. I behaved in horrible, unrecognizable to myself, ways — so much regret,\" Heard said.\n\nHeard also said that she will continue to stand by her testimony that Depp was physically abusive during their relationship.\n\n\"Of course, until my dying days, I will stand by every word of my testimony,\" she said."
