Sweeney Todd is largely a retelling of a Sondheim musical (itself based on a fictional character from a \"penny dreadful\") whereas Edward Scissorhands was largely based on Burton's own experiences as a child and his feelings of isolation. He did, however envision Edward Scissorhands as a possible musical film so there's some match there."
