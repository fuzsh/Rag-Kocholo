She said, 'Are you fucking nuts?'\"\n\nDepp said he \"finally gave in\" and agreed to meet Burton, and the rest is history: they started a collaboration that continued for decades with films like 1994's \"Ed Wood,\" 1999's \"Sleepy Hallow,\" the 2005 \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" remake,\" and 2010's \"Alice in Wonderland.\""
