        "text": "In Cadillac’s 2021 Super Bowl commercial, Edward Scissorhands returns to the screen without Edward, Johnny Depp. Instead, it features Timothée Chalamet as Edagar, the son of Edward, and Winona Ryder as Kim, Edagar’s mother. Anyway, for me, no one would say no to Johnny Depp. He will always be my favorite actor since I watched Pirates of the Caribbean in primary school.\n\nNow, so does Timothée Chalamet. His excellent acting and clever eyes in Call Me by Your Name made me immediately satisfied with the casting of this commercial. I still remember when I first saw this advertisement on social media. I immediately shared it with my best friend because we are both fans of Johnny Depp and Timothée Chalamet. Although we may not be the target customers of Cadillac’s electric car LYRIQ right now, for me, who do not know cars at all, Cadillac’s advertisement has impressed me deeply and made me become a potential customer.\n\nA Ture Sequel\n\nThe entire commercial restores the film’s texture, color matching, and background music. Bright movie colors with some sad stories. This commercial just pulled me in the whole original movie in 1990. Edagar, like his father before him, cannot live an everyday life because he has scissor hands. Edagar was refused bus rides, and no friends wanted to play with him. Instead of driving a real car, he can only enjoy driving at home by playing VR video games. Finally, his mother bought an LYRIQ Cadillac car for him. Even his scissor hands could quickly press the button of fully automatic driving by using Super Cruise, which solved the problem of going to make him happier than ever.\n\nThe funny thing is that Cadillac’s product placement is truly successful that I didn’t even realize it was a car commercial until the end of the advertisement. The success of this commercial lies in the fact that it is not just a car commercial. It integrates the feelings of some movie fans and gives them the ending they expect. Edward and Kim get married, have their child, Edagar, and live a happy life.\n\nThe power of product placement\n\nOur hands-on steering wheel is significant when we think about cars. Cadillac’s advertising breaks through that. With the development of technology, more and more cars have begun to offer fully automatic driving without a steering wheel, but do people dare to use it? My parents have a Lexus car and auto-driving system, but I’ve never seen my parents use it. They know the car has auto driving, but they can’t trust that. Also, they cared about their customers’ safety and wrote notes while Edagar drove the “Available feature. Always pay attention while driving and when using Super Cruise. Do not use a hand-held device.” Cadillac’s LYRIQ was confident enough that Edagar, who had Scissorhands, could drive, giving the audience and us enough confidence that the car’s autopilot was safe and reliable. Instead of telling the customer directly, “We’re safe,” Cadillac is engaging with the audience through ads like this, through themes like this.\n\nThe imagination, the plot, and most importantly, the car all made this advertising brilliant. But what sticks in my mind about this commercial is that both Johnny Depp and his daughter Lily-Rose Depp were watching this from their couch at home and thought, “wow, that’s my ex.”\n\nInteresting…"
