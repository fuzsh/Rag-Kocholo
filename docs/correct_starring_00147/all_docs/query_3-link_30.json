        "text": "Tim Burton is one of the most unusual and unique directors of our time. He brings characters to life by putting them in a habitat they don’t belong. His movies “Alice in Wonderland”, “The Corpse Bride”, “Charlie and the chocolate factory”, and “Edward Scissorhands” all demonstrate how one of a kind his movies are. Using cinematic techniques, Tim Burton points out the misfit character and shows how different they are then everyone else. His use of camera angles, lighting, and sound give the viewers a different perspective on the movies, and help pick out the individual character.\n\nThe camera focuses on Edward’s face; it shows how pale and sad he is. The gothic horror feature used here is the physical appearance of the “monster”. Edward is a large, dark figure with objects (his scissor hands) that can cause harm. This is very stereotypical of the gothic monster as this has been used in Frankenstein (1931) and Nosferatu (1922), and is imprinted in viewers’ minds. But what makes us question how monstrous Edward truly is, is his facial expression and the way he talks. Unlike most gothic horror monsters, he does not have a scary personality. He is shy and is not the antagonist. As the story continues, all the bad deeds he does, are actually the result of someone else taking advantage of him. As viewers, we see this, and we are led to believe that it is not Edward who is the monster, but rather the community Peg has brought him into. By manipulating common features of gothic horror films, Edward Scissorhands is able to influence the audience into believing the “monster” of the film is Edward, but when the tradition is changed, it makes us think that not everything is black and white, and that to get the correct judgement, we must wait until all evidence is presented.\n\nTim Burton created Edward Scissor hands out of his own experiences in Collage. It is Modern Fantasy which uses narrative and Film conventions to create the mixture of Horror and Fantasy. Fantasy films have their own charatestics and those are how we can determine what genre the movie belongs to. A fantasy Film will normally be in an enclosed space, the setting oF Edward scisoor hand is way that Tim Burton makes the film aFantesy film. Like most movies there is a clsh between a villan and the main Charater changes during the film aswel. Many other things make a film what it is like the Charaters the plot and even the sound.\n\nThe film Edward Scissorhands is a contemporary archetype of the gothic genre exploring themes such as unrequited love, social rejection and human creation as defined by Tim Burton. Feature films explore different ideals that can be categorized into different genres that create expectations among audiences about characters, settings, plots and themes. Edward Scisscorhands directed by Tim Burton in the year 1990 is described as both a dark romantic fantasy and a gothic horror film. The film tells a story about Edward Scissorhands, the creation of an elderly inventor who dies before he can give Edward his normal hands in place of his scissor hands. Edward is taken from the mansion he lives in by a suburban family in an attempt to live a\n\nIn usual fairytale movies, filmmakers intend to make films that give happy endings with simple miraculous entertainments. However, in the fable movie, Edward Scissorhand, the director, Tim Burton, positions the viewers to understand the significant meaning of particular issues. “E.S” is can be seen as a story of stereotypical suburbia with social criticism. In this essay, starting from analysing this film and providing dominant discourse, the use of characters will be discussed followed by debate of technical and symbolic codes which help to put up the discourse. In particular, this essay will consider the technical code of camera angle and symbolic codes of colour which emphasize the dominant discourse.\n\nThe movie Edward Scissorhands starts off with an unusual character named Edward who was very different to the others. At the start, everyone seems to like Edward because he is able to do things others can’t, which means he has something different to give. The film shows that people who are different are treated differently for example when Edward was deemed interesting by the town but as soon he's done something wrong he is not liked.\n\nIn Edward Scissorhands, the neighborhood at the base of the hill is shown as a bright and vibrant place to be. The characters are introduced with very distinct and unique personalities. They all have big hair and big charisma whereas Edward is introduced to the movie hiding and afraid. The symbolism of this establishing shot of Edward gives the viewer a grasp on his quiet introverted demeanor in contrast to Peg’s cheery, helpful approach. During the scene where Peg is driving Edward into the neighborhood, it is clearly shown that Edward sticks out like a sore thumb. With his dark leather clothes, disheveled hair and of course, scissors for hands many are warded off by his appearance. Those who give him a chance, such as Peg’s family and some of her friends, have their eyes opened to his very different walk of life. As with Edward Scissorhands, Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children also uses contrast to create a fine line between the two settings in the film. When Jacob first arrives in Wales, the mood is set to match his father’s attitude. Everything is dreary and dull. The appearance of the children’s home is meant to reinforce everything that was being told to Jacob before he left, that he would only be disappointed, that the house wasn’t there anymore, that everyone was dead. This was in stark contrast to what Jacob found inside the loop, the perfect day, filled with very much alive peculiar children. The mood inside the loop is set to match Jacob’s attitude, positive and full of hope. Everything is buzzing with life and excitement. Once again, Burton uses Jacob’s resoluteness to push young people to walk off the beaten path."
