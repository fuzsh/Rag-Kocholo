        "text": "Marilyn Baxter Martin\n\n79 years old, died Saturday, May 9, 2015 due to COPD and Pneumonia. She was married to Ron Martin for 54 years and had 2 children, Kimberly Martin Rocke and Brian Martin. Marilyn and Ron raised their family in the Gray Meadows neighborhood on the West side of Indy and continue to be friends with many of their former neighbors. Ron's job at Borg Warner Automotive took them to upstate New York and upon retiring, they moved to Avon. Marilyn was the ultimate planner and social director. She was a member of many organizations including Welcome Wagon, Tuesdays with Friends, the Red Hat Society and was always up for a game of Eucher, dominoes, and lunch with her friends. Marilyn also loved reading novels, gardening, and researching her genealogy.\n\nA Celebration of Life Luncheon will be held at Charbonos restaurant in Avon at 12:00 Noon on Tuesday. Online condolences may be shared at: conklefuneralhome.com"
