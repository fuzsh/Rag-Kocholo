Warner's father died on September 16, 1889, and so not only was he an only child, but he was also raised by his mother and various other members of his family. He was married twice: first to Viola Caldwell from 1911 to 1913 when they divorced, and then to Winifred Bryson from 1918 until his death in 1951. Based on available information, he and his two wives never had any children together.\n\nHe won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1930 while starring as the The Cisco Kid in Old Arizona (1929). He was the first American to win the award.\n\nHe died in 1951 due to complications from pneumonia at the age of 62. He is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Baxter\n\n\"Ohio Births and Christenings, 1821-1962,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XD1C-3ZQ : 8 December 2014), Warner Baxter, 30 Mar 1889; citing Columbus, Franklin, Ohio, reference v 1 p 22; FHL microfilm 2,026,908.\n\n\"Ohio, County Births, 1841-2003,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VRS4-QHQ : 24 May 2016), Warner Baxter, 30 Mar 1889; citing Birth, Columbus, Franklin, Ohio, United States, county courthouses, Ohio; FHL microfilm 2,026,908.\n\n\"United States Census, 1900,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MMZB-PRD : 22 January 2015), Warner Baxter in household of John Radebaugh, Montgomery Township, Precinct A Columbus City Ward 16, Franklin, Ohio, United States; citing sheet 15B, family 333, NARA microfilm publication T623 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.); FHL microfilm 1,241,269.\n\n\"United States Census, 1910,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MLX1-68M : 29 October 2015), Warner L Baxter in household of Warren L Barritt, Columbus Ward 10, Franklin, Ohio, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) ED 150, sheet 13B, NARA microfilm publication T624 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.); FHL microfilm 1,375,195.\n\n\"United States World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KZVF-KKP : 12 December 2014), Warner Leroy Baxter, 1917-1918; citing Los Angeles City no 17, California, United States, NARA microfilm publication M1509 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.); FHL microfilm 1,530,898.\n\n\"New York, New York City Marriage Records, 1829-1940,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/244F-9SR : accessed 2 August 2015), Warner Leroy Baxter and Winifred M.
