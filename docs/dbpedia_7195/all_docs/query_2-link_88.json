        "text": "More: Pola Negri (1897–1987)\n\nPola Negri was a Polish stage and screen actress. Born Barbara Apolonia Chałupec on 3 December 1897 in Lipno, Poland, she began her career as a stage actress in Poland before moving on to film. Negri rose to prominence in German cinema during the silent era, starring in such notable films as \"Madame DuBarry\" (1919) and \"Sumurun\" (1920). She moved to Hollywood in the mid-1920s and became one of the most popular and highly paid actresses of the time. Some of her Hollywood films include \"A Woman of the World\" (1925) and \"The Spanish Dancer\" (1923). Known for her dramatic and exotic persona, both on and off screen, she was romantically linked to several high-profile figures, including Charlie Chaplin and Rudolph Valentino. With the decline of her Hollywood career in the 1930s, Negri returned to Europe and continued to work in European films. However, her popularity waned over time. She continued to make occasional film and television appearances and wrote her autobiography, Memoirs of a Star (1970). Pola Negri died on 1 August 1987 in San Antonio, Texas, USA, at the age of 90. She is remembered as one of the first international film stars and a pioneer for women in the film industry, with contributions to both European and Hollywood cinema."
