Felgenhauer, age 96, formerly of Sherrodsville, Ohio, died Wednesday afternoon, June 21, 2017 in the New Dawn Health Care Center at Dover after a long illness.\n\nShe was born January 5, 1921 in Bowerston, Ohio and was the daughter of the late Charles B. and Grace B. Warner Poe, and was raised by her grandparents, the late James H. and Elda O. Livingston Warner. She would have been married to her husband David Richard Felgenhauer for 74 years on February 18 of this year, but he passed away on January 3, 2017.\n\nShe retired as the Head Clerk from the former Hart's Family Center after 20 years of service. She had also worked at the former Montgomery Wards Store and Garver Brothers Store. She was the valedictorian of her 1940 graduating class at the former Bowerston High School. Mildred was an active and faithful member of the New Cumberland United Methodist Church, a member of the Royal Neighbors, and enjoyed playing euchre. She and her late husband David welcomed any opportunity to go square dancing together. They were fixtures for many years at the food court in the New Towne Mall.\n\nShe is survived by a son David R. (Diana L.) Felgenhauer of New Philadelphia, O., and a daughter Mrs.Virginia (Otis) Walker of Sherrodsville, and her five grandchildren Mrs. April (Richard) Anderson of New Philadelphia, Mrs. Bonita (Kenny) Smith of Dennison, O., Erica Fields of Canton, O., Jason T. (Susie) Walker of Hardy, Virginia, and David R. Walker and his fiancée Christy Page of New Philadelphia, and eight great-grandchildren.\n\nFuneral services will be conducted at 11:00 A.M. Wednesday, June 28, 2017 in the Baxter-Gardner Funeral Home at Sherrodsville with Rev. Ted Knapp officiating. Interment will follow in the New Cumberland Cemetery. Following the committal service, a luncheon will be held in the New Cumberland United Methodist Church adjacent to the cemetery. Calling hours will be held Tuesday from 6:00 until 9:00 P.M. in the funeral home.
