He was 58.,\n\nHe had suffered from arth-\n\nritis for years, and doctors\n\nperformed a head operation\n\non him on April 20 to relieve,\n\nthe pain.\n\nThe pain had made eating\n\ndifficult and had induced mal-\n\nnutrition. Recently he de-\n\nveloped bronchial pneumonia,\n\nand this hastened his death.\n\nIN 1916 FILM\n\nWarner Baxter began his\n\nacting career as a vaudeville\n\ndancer in 1910. His first film\n\nrole was with Ethel Clayton\n\nin \"Her Own Money\" in 1916.\n\nand he became a film favourite\n\nfor most of his life.\n\nAmong his later better\n\nknown pictures were \"Daddy\n\nLonglegs,\" \"The 'Cisco Kid,\"\n\n\"Forty-second Street,\" \"Broad-\n\nway Bill,\" and \"Under the\n\nPampas Moon.\"\n\nHe was married twice. His\n\nfirst marriage, to Viola Cald-\n\nwell in 1911, was short-lived.\n\nHe later married a stage\n\nactress, Winifred Bryson, and\n\nthey celebrated their thirty\n\nthird wedding anniversary last\n\nJanuary."
