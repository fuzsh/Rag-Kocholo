        "text": "Memories of Columbus-born actor Warner Baxter have dimmed through the years.\n\nBut in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Baxter was a Hollywood leading man and an Oscar winner.\n\nOne of his more-famous films can be seen when the Wexner Center for the Arts screens 42nd Street, part of the \"Cinema 614: A Bicentennial Celebration\" series.\n\nBaxter was born in Columbus in 1889 (a few online biographies list the year as 1891). In 1898, according to his biography at the Hollywood Walk of Fame website, 9-year-old Warner and his widowed mother moved to San Francisco, a city that was ravaged by the 1906 earthquake and subsequent fires. She and young Warner lived in a tent for several weeks until finding shelter.\n\nBy 1910, Baxter had found work as a vaudeville actor - and a salesman - before turning to stage roles. His film debut was as an extra in the 1914 movie Her Own Money, but his first starring performance didn't come until 1921, in the movie Sheltered Daughters.\n\nWorking steadily, Baxter's big break came in 1928, according to his Associated Press obituary. During filming of In Old Arizona, director Raoul Walsh, who was also playing the lead role of the Cisco Kid, was driving home from a shoot one night, and a jumping rabbit crashed through the windshield. The accident left Walsh blind in his right eye.\n\nBaxter stepped in. His portrayal of the Cisco Kid in the first Western \"talkie\" earned him the best-actor Oscar at the second Academy Awards ceremony.\n\nOne of Baxter's most-notable roles came in 1933 as director Julian Marsh in 42nd Street. Bebe Daniels, Ruby Keeler, Ginger Rogers and Dick Powell co-star in the story of a struggling director who is forced to put a chorus girl in the spotlight after the star injures her ankle the night before the premiere.\n\nThe original review in The New York Times said: \"Warner Baxter delivers one of the outstanding portrayals of his screen career as Julian Marsh.\"\n\nHis fame and good fortune, however, were short-lived. Baxter worked steadily until the early 1940s, when he left 20th Century Fox and suffered a nervous breakdown, according to Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies. In 1943, he began working in the Crime Doctor series of B-pictures, reportedly because they were easy to make.\n\nHis health failed, and Baxter died in 1951 of pneumonia contracted after undergoing a lobotomy to relieve arthritis pain so severe that he couldn't eat, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHis star was installed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.\n\nFilmed before the Production Code rules were in force, the sassy 42nd Street features plenty of music (including Lullaby of Broadway, Shuffle Off to Buffalo and You're Getting To Be a Habit With Me) and dance productions choreographed by Busby Berkeley.\n\nGateway lineup\n\nIn a busy week at the Gateway Film Center:\n\nTwilight actor Robert Pattinson continues to stretch his chops in Bel Ami (2012), a drama set in the 1890s about a Parisian who rises from poverty by seducing wealthy women.
