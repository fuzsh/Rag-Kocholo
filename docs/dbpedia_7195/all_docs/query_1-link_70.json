        "text": "1928-29 – Warner Baxter\n\nIn Old Arizona\n\nThis wasn’t a bad movie. In fact, the film was actually nominated for Outstanding Picture at the 2nd Academy Awards. But how much of that was due to its leading man, Warner Baxter? I’d have to say, not much. At this point, I’ve not watched any of the other films that had Best Actor nominations, so I’ll admit that I might be mistaken. But I didn’t think the role demanded much of Baxter. And yet, he took home the Oscar for his performance, so I must really be missing something.\n\nIn the whole movie the character of the Cisco Kid had two, maybe three expressions on his face. There was the happy rogue who thought very highly of himself. There was the suspicious lover who questioned the fidelity of his woman. And then there was the angry bandit who was betrayed by that same woman. There wasn’t much else to the part.\n\nThe character wasn’t terribly deep, and there was very little character development. He was a conscientious bandit who only stole from wealthy corporations, and not innocent individuals. He was a happy-go-lucky guy who chuckled at his own escapades as a bandito. That only really changed at the end of the film when he learned that the woman he loves has happily betrayed him for the reward money. He gets angry. And after he tricks her lover into shooting her, he becomes sad, rides away into the night, and the movie ends.\n\nThe part just wasn’t that complicated, and that was reflected in the range of his acting. In other words, his acting was just fine. It was the role that was lackluster. Maybe if the script had given the Cisco Kid a bit more internal conflict when he turns the tables on Tonia, and she is killed. Maybe if he showed the least bit of fear, trepidation, or even remorse about his own criminal behavior. But he seemed just as jolly and carefree when shooting the vigilantes that tracked him down as when he was slyly shaking hands with the cavalry sergeant who was ordered to bring him in, dead or alive. It was all the same to the character, and that was the fault of the script. Well, the Academy voters apparently disagreed with me."
