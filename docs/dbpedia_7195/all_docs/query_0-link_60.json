        "text": ".\n\n.\n\nThe actress Valentina Zimina had an unusual but also hard lifecourse which is not common for an actress.\n\nShe was born in Russia as the daughter of a famous stage actress.\n\nDuring the Russian revolution in 1917 she lost her whole family who were murdered.\n\nShe herself served for a Bataillon for Women in Russia for three years which was known under the name \"Women's Bataillon of Death\".\n\nFinally she got in imprisonment and was brought to Sibira. There she was able to flee and came via Asia to the USA and finally to Hollywood.\n\nThis could have been the happy end of a till then fateful live but the drama did not reach its end so far.\n\nValentina Zimina was able to gain a foothold in the film business in 1925 and she made her film debut in the role of Dolores for \"A Son of His Father\" (25) at Bessie Love's and Warner Baxter's side. The director was Victor Fleming.\n\nIn the next years she asserted herself in Hollywood and took part in other silent movies like \"La Bohème\" (26) directed by King Vidor with Lillian Gish, John Gilbert and Renée Adorée, \"Rose of the Tenements\" (26) impersonating the role of Emma Goldstein, \"Many Scrappy Returns\" (27) - a short movie with Charley Chase and Eugene Pallette and \"The Woman on Trial\" (27) directed by Regisseur Mauritz Stiller with Pola Negri and Einar Hanson.\n\nHer last movie was \"The Scarlet Lady\" (28) where she ironcally played a Russian revolutionist.\n\nIt nearly seems that the life cycle had been closed with it because shortly after the movie she fell ill with the then raging influenza and died at the age of only 29. She was not able to witness first night of her last movie."
