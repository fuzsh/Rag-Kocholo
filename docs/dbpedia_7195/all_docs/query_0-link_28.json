        "text": "Warner Baxter (March 29, 1889 - May 7, 1951) was an American actor. Born in Columbus, Ohio, he moved to San Francisco, California when he was nine. Following the 1906 earthquake, he and his family lived in a tent for two weeks. By 1910 Baxter was in vaudeville, and from there began acting on the stage.\n\nHis first starring role was as the Cisco Kid in In Old Arizona (1929), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. By 1936, his was the highest salary for an actor in Hollywood, but by 1943, he had slipped to B movie roles, and he began to star in a series of Crime Doctor films.\n\nSuffering the pain of arthritis, Baxter had a lobotomy to ease the pain. He died shortly after of pneumonia."
