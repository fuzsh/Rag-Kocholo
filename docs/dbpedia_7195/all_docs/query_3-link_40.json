        "text": "Ameren employees participated in a landmark cancer study at their downtown headquarters in September. In just one day, more than 120 adults from diverse backgrounds joined the American Cancer Society’s long-term Cancer Prevention Study-3 (CPS-3) to help researchers better understand the lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors that cause or prevent cancer.\n\nA St. Louis CPS-3 enrollment blitz will take place starting April 23rd, 2013 when CEOs Against Cancer companies UMB Bank and KPMG will host enrollments. Other companies currently scheduled to host during the 10 day enrollment period include: Barnes-Jewish Hospital, Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University, Centene, Maritz, Monsanto, and Edward Jones.\n\n“Currently, there are no other studies of this magnitude in the US that enable researchers to look at various racial and ethnic populations and cancer risk,” stated Mark Clanton, MD, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, High Plains Division. “We commend our partners for taking the lead to host this enrollment for their employees and the community to join this critically important study.”\n\nFor more information about CPS-3 and how your company can participate, please visit cancerstudymo.org or call Jason McClelland at (314) 286-8157.\n\nFiled under: Event | Tagged: Ameren, CPS-3, Warner Baxter | Comments Off on Warner Baxter, CEO of Ameren Missouri and Chair of CEOs Against Cancer, enrolls in CPS-3\n\nOn September 25th, employees of Ameren were given the opportunity to participate in a landmark cancer study at their headquarters site in downtown St. Louis. Through a one-day enrollment period, 121 adults from diverse backgrounds joined the American Cancer Society’s long-term Cancer Prevention Study-3 (CPS-3) to help researchers better understand the lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors that cause or prevent cancer.\n\n“We couldn’t let this opportunity pass us by,” said Warner Baxter, CEO of Ameren Missouri and Chair of the CEOs Against Cancer of Missouri St. Louis Chapter. “All of our lives have been affected by this disease. Too many of us have lost a beloved friend or family member. As a corporate community, this is something proactive we can do. We can help make a difference in our lives, the lives of our children, and all the lives of those who come after us.”\n\n“Currently, there are no other studies of this magnitude in the US that enable researchers to look at various racial and ethnic populations and cancer risk,” stated Mark Clanton, MD, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, High Plains Division. “We commend our partner, Ameren for taking the lead to host this enrollment for their employees to join this critically important study.”\n\nCPS-3 participants completed a comprehensive survey online that collected information on their lifestyle, environment, and other factors related to their health. The in-person enrollment process at Ameren took 20-30 minutes and included participants completing a brief survey, having their waist measured and providing a small blood sample drawn by a phlebotomist. The Society will send periodic follow-up surveys every few years over a 20-30 year period to individuals to update their information. The American Cancer Society’s Hammond-Horn Study and previous Cancer Prevention Studies (CPS-I, and CPS-II) have played a major role in understanding cancer prevention and risk, and have contributed significantly to the scientific basis and development of public health guidelines and recommendations. The voluntary, long-term commitment by CPS-3 participants is what will produce benefits for decades to come.\n\nAll men and women, age 30-65, who have never been diagnosed with cancer (except for basal and squamous cell skin cancer), and willing to make a long-term to the study are eligible to participate. More details will be shared with the St. Louis metro area on our Corporate CPS 3 Enrollment Week beginning on April 23rd, 2013 and beginning with UMB Bank hosting the first enrollment site for the downtown area.\n\nFor more information about CPS-3, visit cancer.org/cps3, email cps3@cancer.org, or call toll-free 1-888-604-5888.\n\nTo speak to someone directly about CPS-3 contact Jackie Bayly-Bryant, VP Communications, American Cancer Society at 512-919-1809 or Jackie.bayly-bryant@cancer.org or Jason McClelland, Director of Corporate Relations at 314-286-8157 or jason.mcclelland@cancer.org\n\nFiled under: Uncategorized | Tagged: Ameren, Ameren Missouri, American Cancer Society, CEOs, CEOS Against Cancer of Missouri, Corporate, CPS-3, CPS3, Enrollment Site, research, St. Louis, Warner Baxter | Leave a comment »\n\nOn June 22nd, the American Cancer Society brought together 35 local companies at the second Annual Meeting of the CEOs Against Cancer of Missouri- St. Louis Chapter. Approximately 50 CEOs and corporate executives gathered at the meeting hosted by Bill DeWitt III at the St. Louis Cardinals Busch Stadium to discuss their collective effort to work with the American Cancer Society to raise awareness of local cancer issues, increase cancer prevention and early detection, and decrease the local toll of the disease. They were joined by guest speaker Fran McCaffery, head men’s basketball coach at the University of Iowa, who has been involved with the Society’s Coaches vs. Cancer program and Relay For Life events for years.\n\nCEO and President of Ameren Missouri Warner Baxter, Chair of the local CEOs Against Cancer chapter, praised the group for the progress made in just one year on their lofty goals. Discussion throughout the meeting focused on sharing best practices in corporate health and wellness, the potential collective impact on cancer in their workplaces and the St. Louis community, and corporate and community involvement in the Society’s current research project, Cancer Prevention Study-3. The purpose of Cancer Prevention Study-3 (CPS-3) is to better understand ways to prevent cancer. This multi-year survey will study lifestyle, behavioral, environmental and genetic factors that may cause or prevent cancer with the ultimate goal of eliminating cancer as a major health problem for this and future generations. Ameren Missouri will be the first to host an enrollment with more sites to follow in the spring of 2013.\n\nThe CEOs Against Cancer of Missouri- St. Louis Chapter launched last June with 24 founding members. George Paz, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of Express Scripts Inc., and Rick Navarre, President – Americas of Peabody Energy are Co-Chairmen of the Chapter, with Warner Baxter of Ameren Missouri serving as Chairman. New members this month include: Hugh Grant, Chairman, President and CEO, Monsanto; Rodney Kinzinger, Managing Partner, St. Louis, Deloitte; Rich Liekweg, President & CEO, Barnes Jewish Hospital; Steve Maritz, Chairman & CEO, Maritz; Pat McGinnis, President & CEO, Nestle Purina; Ken Steinback, Chairman, CSI Leasing; Mark Wrighton, Chancellor, Washington University; Lynn Britton, President & CEO, Mercy; and honorary member Norm Stewart, former University of Missouri head men’s basketball coach and founder of Coaches vs. Cancer.\n\nThe American Cancer Society’s CEOs Against Cancer is the premier partnership of world leading CEOs dedicated to eliminating unnecessary deaths and suffering from cancer nationally and globally in the 21st century. Founded in 2003 in Chicago, Illinois the CEOs Against Cancer initiative now has twelve state chapters and is growing. This distinguished group, representing millions of working professionals from diverse industries across the country, helps improve the health of employees, organizations, and surrounding communities by raising awareness about how to stay well, get well, find cures, and fight back against cancer.\n\nFor more information on CEOs Against Cancer, contact Jason McClelland, American Cancer Society Corporate Relations Director at 314-286-8157 or Jason.McClelland@cancer.org.\n\nFiled under: Uncategorized | Tagged: Ameren Missouri, American Cancer Society, Annual Meeting, Barnes Jewish Hospital, BJH, Busch Stadium, cancer, Cardinals, CEOs, CEOS Against Cancer of Missouri, CSI Leasing, Deloitte, Express Scripts, George Paz, Hugh Grant, Maritz, McGinnis, Mercy, Mizzou, Monsanto, Nestle, Nestle Purina, Norm Stewart, Peabody Energy, Rick Navarre, St. Louis, Warner Baxter, Washington University, Wrighton | Leave a comment »"
