        "text": "Actor Robbie Coltrane, who played Hagrid in the Harry Potter films, has died aged 72.\n\nHe also appeared in ITV detective drama Cracker and the James Bond films Goldeneye and The World Is Not Enough.\n\nIn a statement, his agent Belinda Wright confirmed the actor died in hospital near Falkirk in Scotland.\n\nShe described Coltrane as a \"unique talent\", adding his role as Hagrid \"brought joy to children and adults alike all over the world\".\n\n\"For me personally I shall remember him as an abidingly loyal client. As well as being a wonderful actor, he was forensically intelligent, brilliantly witty and after 40 years of being proud to be called his agent, I shall miss him.\n\n\"He is survived by his sister Annie Rae, his children Spencer and Alice and their mother Rhona Gemmell. They would like to thank the medical staff at Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert for their care and diplomacy.\n\n\"Please respect Robbie's family's privacy at this distressing time.\"\n\nColtrane was made an OBE in the 2006 New Year's honours list for his services to drama and he was awarded the Bafta Scotland Award for outstanding contribution to film in 2011.\n\nHarry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe paid tribute to Coltrane in a statement, saying: \"Robbie was one of the funniest people I've met and used to keep us laughing constantly as kids on that set.\n\n\"I've especially fond memories of him keeping our spirits up on Prisoner of Azkaban, when we were all hiding from the torrential rain for hours in Hagrid's hut and he was telling stories and cracking jokes to keep morale up.\n\n\"I feel incredibly lucky that I got to meet and work with him and very sad that he's passed. He was an incredible actor and a lovely man.\"\n\nFellow Harry Potter star Emma Watson said: \"Robbie, if I ever get to be so kind as you were to me on a film set I promise I'll do it in your name and memory.\"\n\nShe paid tribute to Coltrane on Instagram saying there was \"no better Hagrid\" and he \"made it a joy to be Hermione\".\n\n\"I'll really miss your sweetness, your nicknames, your warmth, your laughs and your hugs.\"\n\nWriting on Twitter, Harry Potter author JK Rowling described Coltrane as an \"incredible talent\" and \"a complete one-off\".\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

Farewell, old fellow, you'll be so dreadfully missed.\"\n\nFellow Alfesco actor Hugh Laurie, who also starred alongside Coltrane in Blackadder, recalled their time spent sharing car rides between Manchester and London. \"I don't think I've ever laughed or learned so much in my life\", he tweeted.\n\nAnd Blackadder star Tony Robinson described Coltrane as \"such a sweet man... so talented as a comic and as a straight actor\". Posting on Twitter about his favourite episode from the period sitcom, he said: \"It was all down to you mate.\"\n\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described Coltrane's death as \"very sad news\".\n\n\"He had such range and depth as an actor, from brilliant comedy to hard-edged drama. I think my favourite of all his roles was Fitz in Cracker,\" she said. \"Robbie Coltrane, Scottish entertainment legend - you will be hugely missed. RIP.\"\n\nThe official James Bond Twitter account called him an \"exceptional actor whose talent knew no bounds\".\n\nBroadcaster Richard Coles added: \"Very sorry to hear Robbie Coltrane has died. We shared a dressing room once and he had the biggest pants I have ever seen, which he wore with tremendous flair. We were friends from then on.\"\n\nThe Scottish star, whose real name is Anthony Robert McMillan, was born in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, in 1950.\n\nColtrane was the son of teacher and pianist Jean Ross and GP Ian Baxter McMillan, and was educated at independent school Glenalmond College in Perth and Kinross.\n\nThe actor's career began in 1979 in the TV series Play for Today, but he came to prominence in A Kick Up the Eighties, a BBC TV comedy series which also starred Tracey Ullman, Miriam Margolyes and Rik Mayall.\n\nHe also appeared in the 1983 ITV comedy Alfresco, with Fry, Emma Thompson, Siobhan Redmond and Hugh Laurie.\n\nBy 1987 he had a leading role in Tutti Frutti, about Scottish rock and roll band The Majestics, which also starred Emma Thompson and Richard Wilson. The year before he was in British crime film Mona Lisa, starring Bob Hoskins.\n\nColtrane gained further fame starring as criminal psychologist Dr Eddie \"Fitz\" Fitzgerald in the ITV series Cracker from 1993 to 1995 and in a special return episode in 2006.\n\nThe role secured him the Bafta award for best actor for three consecutive years from 1994 to 1996."
