NEW YORK, May 8

(A.A.P.).-Film actor War-

ner Baxter died at his home

in Hollywood last night after

a long illness. He was 58.,

He had suffered from arth-

ritis for years, and doctors

performed a head operation

on him on April 20 to relieve,

the pain.

The pain had made eating

difficult and had induced mal-

nutrition. Recently he de-

veloped bronchial pneumonia,

and this hastened his death.
