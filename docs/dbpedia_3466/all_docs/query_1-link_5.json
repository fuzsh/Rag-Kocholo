        "text": "The Chaco War arguably remains one of the most obscure and understudied armed conflicts of the twentieth century. Fought over a supposedly ‘empty’ stretch of ‘wilderness’, it affected military and civilian groups from different ethnic backgrounds. This chapter is an introduction to the Chaco region, the people involved in the war and the history of the conflict. I first outline the geography, climate and flora and fauna of the region. I then introduce the Chaco’s indigenous inhabitants, who have inhabited the region for centuries, and discuss their role in the conflict. Following this, I turn my attention to the Mennonites, a religious group that immigrated to Paraguay in the years prior to the outbreak of the war. The Mennonites’ background and reasons for moving to the Chaco are reviewed and their involvement in the conflict examined. The chapter also introduces the Bolivian and Paraguayan soldiers and explores their characteristics and attitude towards the Chaco bush. In a final section, I outline the history of the war by reviewing its antecedents as well as summarising its major battles.\n\nThe Chaco\n\nThe Gran Chaco is an extensive alluvial lowland plain stretching approximately 250,000 square miles west to east from the foothills of the Andes to the shores of the Río Paraguay (Paraguay River) and north to south from the Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil to the Argentinian provinces of Formosa and Chaco. The Gran Chaco can be divided into three main areas: the Chaco Bajo (Low Chaco), the Alto Chaco (Upper Chaco) and the Chaco Central (Central Chaco) or Chaco Boreal, with the latter being at the heart of this investigation. Today, the Chaco comprises around 60 per cent of Paraguay’s total area whilst also constituting the republic’s least populated region (Renshaw 2002, 31). It is also the country’s hottest and most inhospitable place, in which it is almost impossible to find relief from the sizzling daytime temperatures that often exceed 40˚C. Described by British exploratory journalist Julian Duguid as a ‘Green Hell’ and a ‘colossal block of forest, so vast that the mind refuses to grasp the full immensity of its range’ (Duguid 1950 [1931], 19), the Chaco is both frightening and mesmerising at the same time. It is covered largely in dry forest, palm trees, cacti and patches of high grass and shrub savannah; the thought of getting lost in a labyrinth of thorns and dust is indeed a terrifying one. Duguid furthermore states that at first sight, this ‘Green Hell’ seems ‘motionless in the sunlight’ and ‘just a wood, silent, empty […]’ (Duguid 1950 [1931], 20). Closer inspection reveals, however, that under its monotonous greenish-brown coat, the Chaco bush is surprisingly beautiful and very much alive.\n\nSecond only to the Amazon in its extent, the Gran Chaco’s ecosystem is teeming with a myriad of insects, spiders and scorpions, many of which are poisonous. It is also home to a multitude of mammals including the tapir, giant anteater, capybara, peccary, armadillo and maned wolf. Reptiles such as caimans, iguanas, tortoises and snakes are also common. Two of the region’s shyest and most enigmatic inhabitants are the jaguar and the puma. Rarely sighted, they roam the Chaco underbrush and the human imagination. Like many of the animals that are native to the bush, these big cats are primarily nocturnal creatures that seek refuge from the sweltering midday heat and only become active once the sun has set. The Chaco can indeed appear eerily quiet during the day when only colonies of busy ants seem to be going about their daily business, unfazed by the burning sun. It is not until late afternoon that the creaking and rasping in the underwood begins and the bush slowly comes to life.\n\nWhereas thermometers can fall below zero, and frost is not uncommon during the night in the dry and short winter months, nightfall rarely brings relief from the stifling atmosphere during the summer months of October to April. Summer also brings a short but heavy rainy season, which briefly leaves the Chaco in colourful bloom before turning large desert areas into muddy swamps and infesting the bush with swarms of mosquitoes. July finally sees the start of the much-dreaded dry season, which is characterised by months of severe drought that drain the Chaco of all colour and transform the bush into a ‘waterless hellhole’ (English 2007, 17).\n\nThe indigenous populations\n\n‘Had it not been penetrated by the “White Man”, the Chaco would have been inhabited by around ten different indigenous communities totalling almost 50,000 people at the time of the outbreak of the war’, write Luc Capdevila et al. (2010, 8). According to René Harder Horst the Chaco was populated by indigenous peoples from four linguistic families in 1930:\n\nExcept for the two Guaraní peoples, tribes in the Chaco shared linguistic ties. The Ayoreode (also Ayoreo) and Ïshïro (Ishir) were members of the Zamuco linguistic group who had traditionally inhabited the northern Chaco, the first closer to Bolivia and the second nearer the Paraguay River. The Enlhit – whom Paraguayans pejoratively referred to as Lengua – as well as the Angaité, Sanapaná, Guan’a and Enenlhit, belonged to the Lengua-Maskoy linguistic group and lived in the central and eastern areas of the Chaco nearer the Paraguay River. The Yofuaxa, Nivaclé, and Mak’a shared Mataco-Mataguayo linguistic ties and had in historical times lived in the central and southern areas. Finally, the Toba-Qom, of Guaicurú linguistic ancestry, had traditionally resided in the south-eastern Chaco (Harder Horst 2006, 15).\n\nThe struggle of the Chaco’s indigenous populations over their ancestral lands did not, however, begin with the invasion of the Paraguayan and Bolivian armies. Since the end of the nineteenth century they had been subjected to conversion attempts by various religious groups. More significantly, perhaps, Paraguay’s, Bolivia’s and Argentina’s expansion of farming cash crops such as sugar and cotton had resulted in the contraction of their territory and restricted access to resources (Harder Horst 2006, 15).\n\nIn 1930, most of the Gran Chaco’s indigenous peoples lived at the foot of the Andes, where rivers could supply them with enough water and also separated them from steadily encroaching modernity. Feeling pressured by their ever-shrinking territories, various groups believed that stepping into the ‘white world’ was their only chance of survival. This resulted in whole families moving to the Argentinian Chaco to work on sugar plantations, only to succumb to alcoholism and disease (see Gordillo 2004). Others migrated to Alto Paraguay to become farmhands on Paraguayan estancias (Harder Horst 2006, 15). During the pre-war years, interaction with the Paraguayan and Bolivian militaries also became a continuous occurrence. In an attempt to flee violence at the hands of plantation owners and soldiers, several indigenous communities decided to take refuge further inland in the Central Chaco, which was home to groups of mobile hunter-gatherers. Despite the latter’s best efforts to avoid contact with non-indigenous settlers, they could not escape the consequences of western expansion. The sudden contraction of their ancestral land coupled with the influx of immigrating indigenous groups to the area resulted in warfare between the different indigenous populations (Capdevila et al. 2010, 9).\n\nThe indigenous populations and the Chaco War\n\nDespite the predominant indigenous occupation of the Chaco at the outbreak of the war, neither Paraguay nor Bolivia acknowledged indigenous peoples’ exploitation of the land and its resources. The region was never considered indigenous territory, nor were the native populations recognised as citizens of either nation state. Instead, the latter saw the Chaco as an empty geographic entity, a ‘wilderness’ that, nonetheless, formed an integral (if slightly neglected) part of their respective civilised patria. Indigenous people just happened to live there. In fact, according to the general public and military perception of the time, these ‘barbarians’ simply formed part of the Chaco flora and fauna (Capdevila 2010, 22). Even more disturbingly, indigenous people were regarded as menacing ‘creatures without a soul’ and as such could be shot like wild prey (Heinz Wiebe, pers. comm.). Even those Bolivian soldiers who were native to the Andes and of indigenous origin saw themselves as superior to the indigenous people of the Chaco lowlands. During the war, both armies would frequently evoke fear in newer and younger recruits by relating gruesome stories of bloodthirsty ‘savages’ attacking military outposts. In his memoir, Paraguayan soldier Ladislao Bustamante Rodríguez claims that ‘not even the tigers or the lions are as dangerous as the Moro Indian’ (Bustamante Rodríguez 1987, 36).1\n\nDespite their prejudices and fears, both armies recognised at an early stage that indigenous knowledge of the disputed territory was indispensable to a successful military operation. While the bush was an alien place for the soldiers, it was home for the Chaco’s indigenous inhabitants. They knew how to survive months of drought and identify the forest fruits and medicinal herbs. The acquisition of an insider’s understanding of the Chaco flora and fauna could mean the difference between life and death during the war. The locating of natural water sources, such as pozos indios (indigenous wells), was a necessity that required indigenous guidance and occasionally created a friendly bond between indigenous people and military personnel (Belaieff 1934).\n\nOne of the most famous friendships between a member of the Paraguayan military and the Chaco’s indigenous populations is that of Russian-born General Juan Belaieff and the Chamacoco (now Ishir) and Maká indigenous groups. An ex-official of Tsar Nicholas’s Imperial Guard, Belaieff had moved to Paraguay after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. Upon his arrival, he was immediately employed by the Paraguayan military for his cartographic skills. He became known as an explorer of the Chaco, and his personal interest in anthropology and his host country’s indigenous populations led to the formation of close relationships with Ishir and Maká men. Although he was appointed the Paraguayan army’s chief cartographer, Belaieff can be considered an early anthropologist of the Chaco, with his written observations focusing on both the region’s geographical features and its indigenous populations (see Belaieff 1941). His interest in and support of the Chaco’s indigenous people did not end with the war. During the agricultural expansion and the contraction of indigenous territories in the Chaco in the 1940s, Belaieff became an advocate for Maká land rights, securing the group land for a reserve (Chesterton and Isaenko 2014).\n\nAlthough friendly collaborations between indigenous people and soldiers existed, the belligerent parties soon realised that the former were also easily exploitable workforces (Riester 2008, 193). Indigenous men were made to take on the role of sappers, hacking dirt roads and digging trenches in the bush, while indigenous women frequently became victims of sexual abuse (Paniagua 1994, 105; Harder Horst 2006, 16–17). Indigenous people were furthermore used as guides and spies, which often resulted in their execution owing to fears or allegations of espionage and betrayal of a nation state – a concept that they most likely did not understand and were not considered part of. Others fell victim to various diseases spread by the soldiers, while thousands more were uprooted by the militarisation of their ancestral lands and forced to move to unfamiliar territory (Harder Horst 2006, 15, 16–17; Capdevila et al. 2008, 48–56).\n\nMost significantly perhaps from the perspective of the belligerent states, the hitherto largely ignored indigenous presence in the Chaco suddenly proved essential to the national cause. In fact, indigenous people were seen as living proof that survival in the bush was possible and that the latter was worth fighting over (Capdevila et al. 2008, 20). In addition, their indigenous status was now being used by both countries to legitimate their ownership of the Chaco. On their part, the Paraguayans claimed that the Guaraní indigenous people and their various sub-groups, and not the people of the Bolivian Altiplano, were the first and, hence, rightful occupiers of the Chaco. As mestizos of both Spanish and Guaraní descent, sharing language and customs with their Guaraní ancestors, the Paraguayans believed they were entitled to the Chaco as far up as the Bolivian lowlands (Capdevila 2010, 30). Bolivia, which as a nation was predominantly made up of mestizos and Quechua and Aymara indigenous people, concluded that their own country’s indigenous heritage justified Bolivian ownership of an indigenous Chaco. Similar to the use of the Choctaw language by Navajo ‘code talkers’ in the Second World War (Santella 2004), the Paraguayan and Bolivian armies both adopted their respective indigenous languages in an effort to disguise military communications. The indigenous code talking proved less successful for the Bolivians as their military officials were of mainly white European and mestizo origins and did not have any knowledge of the Quechua or Aymara language. This language barrier constituted a further major problem within the Bolivian army, as the majority of the Quechua and Aymara soldiers did not speak any Spanish. The Paraguayans, on the other hand, mastered the Guaraní language and were able to successfully employ it in the communication of secret information during the war. While Paraguay adopted a colonial attitude towards the Chaco’s indigenous populations, Bolivia failed at ‘nationalising’ them and only managed to conscript a small number of Chulupí and Enlhet men to join their Quechua and Aymara brothers in the defence of ‘their’ Bolivian patria (Capdevila et al. 2008, 24; Capdevila 2010, 32).\n\nThe Mennonites\n\nThe Mennonites, named after their religion’s founder Menno Simons (1496–1561), are an evangelical free church that arose from the radical Anabaptist movement during the Reformation in the sixteenth-century Low Countries. Traditionally, Mennonites practise adult baptism and aim to lead what they perceive to be a simple and peaceful yet hard-working life, secluded from the technological and social progress of modern society. They believe in pacifism and therefore oppose any involvement in armed confrontation. However, throughout history, persecution and the restriction of religious freedom continuously forced them to emigrate, and in 1926 the first group of Mennonites arrived in the Chaco, with a second wave following in 1930, and a third in 1947.2\n\nWhen the first Russian-Canadian Mennonite families set out on their voyage to Paraguay – and what they believed at the time to be a Paraguayan-owned Chaco region – they carried little more than the clothes on their backs and a profound trust in God. Only 60 years earlier the parents of those packing up their lives to move to South America had arrived in Canada from Russia as the latter country no longer granted them the privileges that the community thought essential to their faith and culture. Leaving and uprooting whole communities was again deemed a necessary but by no means easy step. The Mennonites had come to cherish Canada, where they lived a secluded and simple farming lifestyle undisturbed by the outside world.\n\nAfter the First World War, however, their situation suddenly started to change. The standardisation process taking place in the English-speaking part of Canada meant that English was to be the only language used in classrooms. This new regulation, however, was not reconcilable with the Mennonite faith, as the Mennonites were adamant that the Bible be preached, and their children be taught, in German. As a result, a group of more traditional ‘Old Mennonites’ decided to emigrate to Mexico. Having come to love their home country, the remaining communities decided to accept English in their schools. When the Canadian government then decided to employ its own teachers within Mennonite schools and to drop religious education, more Mennonites felt the need to leave Canada. There was also a general anti-German feeling in the Canadian population at the time and this was often directed at the German-speaking Mennonite communities. Yet it was the intensification of military conscription and the country’s advocacy of a stronger national defence that most clearly contradicted the Mennonite pacifist belief system, as compulsory military service could not be reconciled with their worldviews (Friesen 2004, 10–12).\n\nReligious faith is one of the pillars of the Mennonite doctrine and people strongly believed that the only possible explanation for why God would lead them into such an inhospitable jungle as the Chaco was that he wanted them to ‘show the indigenous people how to lead a humane life through a sedentary lifestyle and hard work’ (Heinz Wiebe, pers. comm.). Unity and solidarity are further key tenets of the Mennonite community. In other words, the common good should always come before self-interest. This belief is also reflected in people’s attitude towards physical labour. Mennonites are hard-working individuals who consider the labour and diligence, commitment and perseverance of each member essential for the survival and success of the community as a whole.\n\nOnce the decision to leave Canada was made, the Mennonites started looking for a new place that they could call home. They contacted Samuel McRoberts, a wealthy and well-travelled financier in New York, who agreed to help. During a journey by ship to Buenos Aires in 1920, McRoberts happened to meet Manuel Gondra, the newly elected President of the Republic of Paraguay, who showed a keen interest in the Mennonite cause. Shortly after their chance meeting McRoberts sent his emissary, Fred Engen, to explore the Chaco for suitable farmland. Engen was a Norwegian-born pacifist who dreamed of founding a ‘state of peace’ and was sympathetic to the Mennonites’ situation. In his quest to find a place appropriate for colonisation he had just returned from a pioneering trip into the Chaco. He was accompanied by a handful of local Toba indigenous people, who knew both the bush and the Enlhet communities that inhabited the area they were going to inspect, and three packed mules. A few months prior to the expedition, heavy rain had inundated large parts of the Chaco, so when Engen and his small delegation arrived, they found much of the bush under water. Setting out right after the wet season meant that the Chaco was green and in bloom, and the lagoons carried abundant water. After two arduous weeks of cutting through the thick and swampy underbrush the men finally got to a dry elevated area that would later become known to the Mennonites as Kamp.3 The Kamp was covered in lush high grass, which Engen concluded would make excellent pasture for cattle to roam on and feed from. Little did he know that the cows would not eat this particular type of grass and that heavy rain in the Chaco would be followed by months of intensive drought, which cracks open the earth and would later continually threaten the existence of both livestock and men. One year later and unaware of the challenges that any potential coloniser would inescapably face, Engen guided a group of Mennonite delegates to the elevated area that had showed so much promise on his previous visit (Friesen 1997, 79–97).\n\nPrior to the Mennonite immigration, the Paraguayan government worried that Mennonite settlement efforts in the Central Chaco would fail as previous colonisation attempts of the region had done so. The Mennonites were, however, known for successfully settling remote and difficult-to-farm areas in Prussia, Russia and Canada in the past (Friesen 1997). To encourage and facilitate their move to Paraguay they received financial and logistical aid from the North American-based Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) in the setting up of their villages. Ahead of the group’s move, a small delegation of Mennonites accompanied by indigenous guides was sent to the Chaco to examine this potential new home. As it happened, the members arrived after heavy rainfall had turned much of the region into marshland. The muddy ground coupled with the lack of roads made progress painfully slow. Moods were lifted, however, when the group finally reached an elevated dry region. The sight of Kamp areas covered in high grass delighted the experienced Mennonite farmers, who were blissfully unaware of the fact that it was not suitable for cattle consumption. Their hopes were raised further when they spotted the small vegetable and fruit patches that the welcoming indigenous people maintained. They had already noted potatoes and cotton growing abundantly around the town of Puerto Casado (Quiring 2013, 168). Could this really be the ‘promised land’ as it had previously been described by Engen (Friesen 1997, 79–97)?\n\nSituated 678 km north of Asunción on the west bank of the Río Paraguay, Puerto Casado was a bustling and booming place that was largely owned and controlled by Carlos Casado, a wealthy Argentinian businessman whose family had bought large parts of the Chaco from the Paraguayan government after the War of the Triple Alliance. Casado had established the very successful Carlos Casado Company, which specialised in the production of tannin. This was gained from the hardwood quebracho tree that is native to the Chaco. In order to transport the tree trunks Casado had built a railway running from his factory in the centre of town 60 km into the bush, and this was eventually extended for Mennonite and later military use.\n\nNegotiations with government officials and Casado started upon the group’s return from the Chaco. The delegation expressed their positive impression of the Chaco’s agricultural potential and their keenness to relocate their people into this ‘wilderness’. Official consent was given by Paraguayan authorities and soon after the Mennonite communities in Canada received an invitation for immigration to Paraguay (Friesen 1997, 158–61). Much to the regret of the hopeful Mennonite families, the move to South America had to be put on hold for a four-year period due to an economic crisis in Canada. Negotiations with Casado were eventually reinstated in 1925 and McRoberts’ US-based Intercontinental Company proceeded to buy 179,200 hectares of land in the Central Chaco, 53,760 of which were at the Canadian Mennonites’ disposal (Friesen 1997, 532).\n\nIntercontinental Company Limited, owned by McRoberts and various US business partners, was a Winnipeg-based company dealing specifically with the Canadian Mennonite emigration to Paraguay. In return for their land in Canada, the company offered the Mennonites land that it had bought from the Casado family in the Chaco. The Corporación Paraguaya, its sister company, was later established in Paraguay to manage the land purchases and allocations in situ (Friesen 1997, 193–204; Quiring 1934b, 36). Of the 179,200 hectares that the company bought in the Chaco only 30,760 were given to the establishment of a Mennonite colony as McRoberts was hoping to sell the remaining land to other Mennonite and non-Mennonite communities interested in settling the Central Chaco (Friesen 1997, 532).\n\nIn 1926, the first group of Mennonite immigrants finally arrived in Puerto Casado by boat from Manitoba, Canada, via Argentina. More Mennonite families made their way over in 1927 and not long after their arrival the hopeful group boarded the train headed west into the unfamiliar Chaco scrubland. As they travelled into the depths of the bush, they felt more and more disheartened. They were expecting lush open grassland but instead had to fight their way through thorny forests. After arriving at the terminus they continued their arduous journey on foot and with the help of oxcarts for a further 220 km before finally getting to their designated plots of land (Friesen 2004, 10). Colonia Menno, with its administrative town of Loma Plata and its members commonly known as Menno, became the first ever Mennonite settlement in the Chaco and Paraguay as a whole (Klassen 2012, 13).\n\nFrom 1930 to 1932 the Menno were joined by a total of 2,000 Russian Mennonite refugees who had managed to flee the Soviet regime in Russia. Pressured by Germany, which had granted them temporary residence, to find a different home, and enticed by the privileges offered by Paraguay, the Russian refugees were now hoping to start a new life in the Paraguayan outback (Friesen 1997, 535–42; Quiring 1934a, 62–4). Having arrived in Puerto Casado, they boarded the train, whose tracks by now extended 145 km into the bush. A group of Mennos was awaiting them at the terminus with oxcarts to take them 110 km to their allocated plots of land northwest of Colonia Menno (Abercrombie 1933, 1174; Friesen 1997, 549). Like the Canadian Mennonites before them, they looked in awe at the alien wilderness they were crossing with such difficulty, wondering how they were going to build an existence in this stunted forest (Quiring 1934a, 65). Dedication, endurance, solidarity and an unshakeable trust in God ultimately resulted in the establishment of Colonia Fernheim with its administrative centre of Filadelfia and a tight-knit community of Fernheimers.\n\nEstablished between 1947 and 1948, Colonia Neuland with its centre of Neu-Halbstadt is the third and final Mennonite colony founded in the Central Chaco. Like the Fernheimers, they had fled the Soviet regime in Russia and had arrived in Paraguay via Germany.4 The new settlement was founded approximately 450 km northwest of Asunción and south of Colonia Fernheim. Although at that point the newly denominated Neuländer constituted the largest group of Mennonite immigrants to the Chaco, they now form the smallest colony.\n\nFrom the start, all three colonies relied on help from Enlhet indigenous people, and later the Ayoreo, to survive in their new environment. Today the Mennonites claim that, attracted by the fact that the Mennonites always had food, the Enlhet ‘left the bush’ of their own free will to become workhands on Mennonite farms (male Fernheimer, pers. comm.). Relationships were generally amicable, and the Mennonites soon started to convert and baptise the first indigenous people. Conversion efforts temporarily came to a halt when the military started to encroach on the area. Frightened by the soldiers, most Enlhet retreated into the depths of the bush where they were hiding out until the end of the war (see Stahl 2007).\n\nThe Mennonites and the Chaco War\n\nReferring to the fighting in the Chaco in a 1933 issue of the Christian Century, a contemporary observer notes that the Mennonite immigrants, ‘although a peaceful noncombatant people, seem to be the immediate cause of all trouble’ (Abercrombie 1933, 1173). Yet according to Mennonite author Gerhard Ratzlaff (and a general belief amongst the modern-day Chaco Mennonites), Paraguayan officials lured the oblivious immigrants into the bush with all sorts of privileges such as freedom of religion, control over their own education system and exemption from military service, so as to use them as a ‘political weapon’ against Bolivia (Ratzlaff 2009, 20). The Mennonites’ arrival in Paraguay was evidently met with suspicion from local politicians and the general population, who feared that all these concessions could lead to the creation of a Mennonite state within the Paraguayan state (Ratzlaff 2009, 14–21; Chesterton 2013, 98–9). Even so, Paraguay hoped to ‘civilise’ the Chaco by establishing a permanent human presence in its centre (Chesterton 2013, 99). In fact, the Paraguayans believed that because they turned the Chaco ‘wilderness’ into arable farmland and permanent villages, they were entitled to it (Ratzlaff 2009, 20–1). The Mennonites were thus recruited not as soldiers armed with rifles but as an ‘army of freedom, which carries the plough as a weapon of attack and presents the cross of Christ as a weapon of defense’ (Genaro Romero, President of Bureau of Immigration Services as quoted in Friesen 2004, 7). Addressing the President of the Republic during a congress meeting a few years earlier about a possible Mennonite emigration to Paraguay, Senator F. C. Chaves stated that:\n\nNowadays, President, one does not defend one’s homeland solely with a rifle on one’s shoulder; one defends it by solving the problem of subsistence; while the military forces are fighting, it is essential that others are working the land with the noblest duty of supplying provisions … One has to bear in mind that the privilege, exemption from military service, to be given to the Mennonites, will be compensated with other services, while they are staying in our country … They are going to settle and become land holders, an action which will constitute the strongest bond; so that while they will not serve us in the trenches, they are going to serve us there, they will cultivate the land, where we have never even visited let alone worked. Because this is the truth, the Chaco is a desert, unpopulated … The Mennonites are going to represent an army, which is capable of effectively defending our sovereign rights … (quoted in Ratzlaff 2009, 17–18).\n\nPrior to their move, the Russian-Canadian Mennonites had received a letter from the Bolivian Embassy in Washington stating that the Central Chaco was Bolivian territory and that the entering Mennonites would in fact need a Bolivian visa. Upon enquiry, they were assured that the area in question was Paraguayan as it lay east of the status quo line defined in 1907 (Klassen 1993, 55–7; Ratzlaff 2009, 21). Although the Mennonites encountered various manned Paraguayan military posts upon penetrating the Chaco, they did not seem worried as they were convinced that it was impossible to stage a war in such a ‘wilderness’ (Ratzlaff 2009, 24).\n\nIt was thus in a strange twist of fate that the Mennonites, who as a Christian denomination reject all armed violence and strive for a peaceful isolated existence, settled in close proximity to military outposts. In the case of the Russian-Canadian Mennonites, they had ‘escaped the claws of Communism’ in the Soviet Union only to move into the heart of another conflict zone that would eventually claim thousands of lives (Friesen 1997, 546). Instead of the peace and quiet they were hoping to encounter in the Paraguayan hinterland, the Mennonites found themselves surrounded by the distant sound of artillery fire and the threatening hum of aeroplanes. As their villages became passage routes for Paraguayan soldiers on their way to the front, trade between the two groups soon emerged (see Chapter 4). Mennonite community buildings were converted into military hospitals and the already meagrely filled village wells became invaluable lifelines for thirsty soldiers (Klassen 1993, 2009, 2010). Remembering the Mennonites’ escape from the Bolshevik regime, Martin W. Friesen states that ‘The “world”, which we fled with such big sacrifices, was now frighteningly close again’ (quoted in Ratzlaff 2009, 24).\n\nThe Bolivian soldier\n\nPrior to the war, Bolivia and Paraguay had been largely pre-industrial and ‘pre-modern’ nations, in the western understanding of the term. As neither country operated a domestic arms industry, all weaponry and heavy equipment had to be imported from Europe and the US (Hughes 2005, 416). Most weapons consisted of old and often faulty leftover matériel from the First World War (Pendle 1967, 26). The same weapons, which had already claimed countless lives on the battlefields of the Great War almost two decades earlier, were now about to be unleashed on men thousands of miles away in the remoteness of the Chaco. The horrors of European industrialised warfare were now imposed on armies composed of largely non-literate indigenous and Spanish-mestizo Amerindian peoples to fight in a conflict created and dictated by a Hispanic elite (Breithoff 2012, 148; 2013, 67).\n\nAt first sight Bolivia appeared far better prepared for war. With around 60,000 recruits, its military forces were almost three times the size of its enemy’s and its experienced German-trained officers promised a prompt victory. In preparation for conflict, Bolivia had signed a deal worth £3 million with British arms manufacturer Armstrong-Vickers, which, due to Bolivia’s financial restrictions, was eventually reduced to £1.25 million. With Chile and Argentina denying Bolivia passage through their ports, the landlocked nation had to turn to the port of Mollendo in southern Peru. A third of the military equipment ordered never arrived in sufficient quantity or quality and a substantial part of the freight simply ‘vanished’ upon arrival in Peru (Hughes 2005, 318).\n\nGetting the equipment to the front line constituted a further challenge at the start of the war. Unlike the Paraguayan capital, which was situated relatively close to the centre of operations, Bolivia’s main cities were all located at a considerable distance from the initial battle zone. In addition, the dirt roads hacked into the Chaco bush were rudimentary at the best of times and often became impassable after heavy rain. The long supply lines coupled with the extreme weather conditions of the region resulted in frequent delays in getting water, food and weapons as well as soldiers to the front line.\n\nThe real disadvantage for Bolivia was its military’s unfamiliarity with the Chaco region. As with every war, intimate knowledge of the terrain is crucial and the soldiers’ ability to read, understand and use the landscape they are fighting in to their advantage is key to military success (Woodward 2004). The Bolivian forces were primarily made up of Aymara and Quechua indigenous people from the Andean Altiplano, which rises majestically hundreds of kilometres away from the theatre of operations. Used to the cold conditions of the mountains where they had primarily worked as miners and farmhands, the Aymara and Quechua soldiers felt uprooted and disorientated in the Chaco scrub. According to Querejazu Calvo, the indigenous men were accustomed to the vast open spaces of the Andean highlands where transpiration is limited. The density and heat of the Chaco thicket, on the other hand, made them feel claustrophobic and lost (Querejazu Calvo 1975, 128). Their lack of knowledge of the Chaco flora and fauna ultimately led to thousands of soldiers dying from thirst and to generally low morale among the troops (see Chapter 3).\n\nIn contrast to the indigenous recruits, most army officers were of Spanish ancestry, while the commander-in-chief, General Hans Kundt, was a German who had served on the Eastern Front in the First World War. Prior to that, Kundt had served in the Bolivian army as a trainer and counsellor, and enjoyed a great reputation amongst national politicians. Bolivia therefore hoped that his expertise in modern warfare and experience in the trenches of Europe would ensure a victorious counter-offensive after the Bolivian defeat in the Battle of Boquerón in 1932. It was, however, Kundt’s frontal assault military tactics, which he had acquired on the battlefields of the First World War, that would repeatedly bring defeat and great human loss to the Bolivian army (Zook 1960, 126; Farcau 1996, 87–9). Consequently, Bolivia soon realised that his ignorance of the Chaco terrain had catastrophic consequences for the soldiers and the outcome of the conflict as a whole. In addition, communication between the higher and lower military ranks was often a challenge as the common foot soldier did not speak Spanish and the generals were not familiar with the indigenous languages used by their subordinates.\n\nEquipped with German-style heavy green-grey woollen uniforms, heavy boots and steel helmets, the Bolivian forces were also inappropriately dressed for combat in the Chaco scrubland. Bolivian soldier and writer Emilio Sarmiento remembers that although he was made familiar with the use of modern weapons such as the German Mauser rifle and the light machine gun (both of which were used during the Chaco campaign), his military education followed the manual for war in the mountains, ignoring the possibility for armed conflict on Chaco territory (Sarmiento 1978, 42). The extreme heat in the Chaco and the country’s precarious economic situation eventually led to the use of lighter khaki cloth uniforms and leather-brimmed hats during the war (Farcau 1996, 230; De Quesada with Jowett 2011, 11). Still, many of the regiments remained inappropriately geared up for the Chaco scrubland, presenting a picture of an incongruous troop ‘equipped for fighting in the mountains with designs from the First World War’ (Sarmiento 1978, 68). The Bolivians’ ignorance of the terrain was further illustrated by their employment of tanks. Although this seemed like a smart strategic move, it proved to be a catastrophic decision in the field. The terrain was treacherous and the risk of suffocation inside the tanks forced the soldiers to open the hatch, which inevitably made them an easy target for enemy gunfire.\n\nThe fate of the Bolivian soldiers was ultimately nothing short of a tragedy. Separated from their families by hundreds of kilometres of unfamiliar and impenetrable forest, the Quechua and Aymara ‘served as cannon fodder in the errors of inept commanders’ (Querejazu Calvo 1975, 131). Even so, they showed a great amount of courage. Despite the heat, hunger and thirst that tortured them in the Chaco, they kept defending a stretch of land that ultimately meant nothing to them (Querejazu Calvo 1975, 131).\n\nThe Paraguayan soldier\n\nAt the start of the war Paraguay was an agricultural nation primarily made up of Guaraní-Spanish mestizo farmers. The country’s economy was weak and its infrastructure limited. Like its Bolivian counterpart, the Paraguayan army was equipped with outdated weaponry from the First World War (Hughes 2005, 418; De Quesada with Jowett 2011, 6–7). Although Paraguay’s forces were a lot smaller than the enemy’s, they not only profited from the unofficial support of neighbouring Argentina but also enjoyed logistical advantages at the start of the war. Unlike Bolivia they had the use of Puerto Casado’s train line to transport soldiers and equipment into the Central Chaco. Paraguay also had a better senior command under Lt Col. (later General, and finally Marshal, upon his death in 1940) José Félix Estigarribia, who, in contrast to the Bolivian general, had a superior knowledge of the Chaco landscape.\n\nAlthough the common Paraguayan soldier had generally never set foot into the Chaco bush before the war, he had internalised strong emotional ties with the region. In fact, the defence of the Chaco was an opportunity for the Paraguayan nation to redeem itself after its defeat in the War of the Triple Alliance almost eighty years before (Chesterton 2013, 6). In the Paraguayan rationale, the conflict against the merged powers of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay was nonetheless considered a national victory achieved by rural heroes. Paraguay, a nation of simple peasants, had taken up arms ready to sacrifice men and children against its neighbouring powers, and against all odds managed to save the country from extinction (Kraay and Whigham 2004). At the dawn of the Chaco War, the Paraguayan farmhands were once again ready to swap their ploughs for rifles in the defence of the patria (Chesterton 2013, 103). They did not care what their and Bolivia’s politicians were agreeing or disagreeing about in international meeting rooms. The only thing that mattered to them was the restoration of their national honour (Chesterton 2013, 104). As a result, the Chaco War helped shape Paraguayan identity as ‘the event was a powerful catalyst for national sentiment’ (Capdevila et al. 2010, 11). The ‘mobilised farmer’ from the slopes of eastern Paraguay was once more elevated to the status of national hero as he ‘was not [a]soldier, but a warrior’ who was proud of his mixed Spanish and Guaraní indigenous heritage (Benítez 1976, 58). Bridget María Chesterton encapsulates the essence of the Paraguayan Chaco War recruit when she writes that:\n\nA combination soldier and agriculturalist was the idealized version of the Paraguayan citizen during the years preceding the Chaco War. This individual – whose racial identity was mestizo, but who often was called ‘Guaraní’, as learned men and soldiers called the citizens of Paraguay – was the man whom the Paraguayan Liberal regime would call upon to fight the Bolivians in the Chaco. Paraguayans based their ideas about the ideal citizen in the early decades of the twentieth century on the assertion that Paraguayan men must work to farm the land and fight to defend the same land from foreign invaders (Chesterton 2013, 105).\n\nKnown to the Bolivians as pila (short for pata pelada or ‘unshod’), the Paraguayan soldier generally went barefoot. To anyone who has ever visited the thorny Chaco thicket this might seem a risky and rather foolish undertaking. Although Paraguay’s precarious financial situation at the time would explain a shortage of boots, the soldiers’ absence of footwear appears to stem from a long-standing provincial tradition rather than economic shortcomings. Writing in the context of the War of the Triple Alliance, Jerry W. Cooney states that despite fears of a cold winter in 1867, women did not need to waste their labour and meagre resources on the fabrication of boots as ‘all common Paraguayans – soldiers and civilians alike – went barefoot’ (Cooney 2004, 28).\n\nHis simple uniform, home-made cow-horn canteen and all-important machete for cutting through the shrub stood in stark contrast to the European Mauser rifle which he carried. Arming indigenous and mestizo farmhands with industrial weaponry inevitably resulted in the clashing of two completely opposing worlds. Like the Bolivian indigenous soldier, the Paraguayan infantryman had left his crops and livestock behind, swapping his wooden ploughs for Madsen automatic rifles and Stokes Brandt mortars to fight an enemy he did not even know in a landscape he was unfamiliar with. Although he was used to the tropical climate of eastern Paraguay and Bolivian soldiers frequently described him as moving through the bush with ‘feline speed and agility’ (Querejazu Calvo 1975, 129) and ‘like fallow deer’ (Sarmiento 1978, 69), the Paraguayan soldier also struggled to survive in the Chaco. Like his Bolivian counterpart he was at the mercy of the natural elements and the Chaco landscape, in which thousands of men lost their lives.\n\nA concise history of the Chaco War\n\nIf one were to define colonialism in its most basic form as ‘the conquest and control of other people’s lands and goods’ (Loomba 2005, 8), the Chaco War could be interpreted as a colonial war fought between two nation states over the annexation of an indigenous territory. In contrast to other so-called colonial wars, such as the American Indian Wars (1607–1890) with their Indian Removal Act of 1830, which sought to remove indigenous populations from their ancestral lands by force (Pierpaoli Jr 2011, 381–3), the conflict in the Chaco was not a war fought against the ‘Indian’, nor was the Mennonite settlement of the Chaco Boreal a deliberate attempt from Paraguay to convert and dominate indigenous people. It was neither the Bolivian nor the Paraguayan state’s aim to occupy indigenous territory or to combat, subject, expel or exterminate its indigenous inhabitants (Capdevila 2010, 16–17). In fact, both sides largely ignored the indigenous presence in the area and their exploitation of the Chaco’s natural resources. Each nation state saw the Chaco as an ‘empty’ stretch of land as it was not being exploited in a way which they recognised (Capdevila 2010, 22). In their eyes it was the respective armies’ honourable duty to ‘civilise’ this forgotten part of the nation and bring it into line with the rest of the patria (Capdevila 2010: 27). Although the concept of colonialism evidently goes far beyond military action, I agree with Luc Capdevila that in its essence, the Chaco War was not a war of conquest but a ‘defence’ of the patria against an invading neighbour (Capdevila 2010, 15, 27–8).\n\nThe causes of the Chaco War remain disputed amongst scholars. Although rumours of possible oil sources were sparked in the 1920s, oil does not seem to have played a decisive factor in the outbreak of the war (Zook 1960, 72). In the case of Bolivia, possession of the Chaco was of strategic and economic importance. Having lost its coastal province to Chile in the War of the Pacific (1879–83), Bolivia was struggling with its new status as a landlocked country. It therefore sought access to the Atlantic Ocean via the Chaco and the Paraguay River to secure a fluvial output for the export of the tin produced in the mines of Potosí and Oruro (Cote 2013, 741). Moreover, in order to satisfy the increasing demand for petroleum to fuel the mining industry, Bolivia turned its attention towards the Chaco. During the 1920s the Standard Oil Company had secured concessions on a huge tract of oil lands in the Sub-Andean region on the western edge of the Central Chaco but was in constant conflict with Bolivian authorities over legal regulations. The only way for Bolivia to develop its oil sector was by developing the Chaco, the country’s much-dreaded region to the east which was ‘merely’ inhabited by Guaraní indigenous people (Cote 2013, 741–2). Considered a ‘desert wilderness’ and avoided by foreign investors due to its harsh climate and barren soils, the Bolivian east remained, at least from a western point of view, unexploited (Cote 2013, 741). Bolivia thereupon decided to base its legal rights over the region on territorial regulations dating back to Spanish colonial rule (Farcau 1996, 5–15).\n\nAcross the border, Paraguay was still in grave financial debt from the War of the Triple Alliance. The government therefore turned towards selling large plots of land west of the Paraguay River. A significant portion of this land was sold to Argentinian cattlemen, such as the influential Casado family, who then went on to establish their highly successful tannin industry and the associated train line in the area. Missionaries from various religious denominations, such as the Anglicans and the Salesians, also settled the region in an effort to convert the Chaco’s indigenous populations (Chesterton 2013). Paraguay consequently believed that it was entitled to the territory through its occupation and exploitation of the area, even though it never expanded into the heart of the Central Chaco due to the latter’s limited economic prospects (Farcau 1996, 5–15).\n\nThroughout the 1920s diplomats tried to resolve the border issues between the two nations. Yet while agreement on the matter diminished around official negotiating tables, both armies were busy establishing fortines (singular: fortín – military outpost) in the Chaco and confrontations between armed patrols increased in the disputed territory. On 5 December 1928 a small Paraguayan patrol seized a Bolivian outpost in the far northern corner of the Chaco, killing several Bolivian soldiers and triggering a number of armed attacks from both sides over the next few years (Farcau 1996, 12–15). In 1932, while the parties were negotiating possible troop withdrawals at a conference with the Commission of Neutrals in Washington, DC, both governments were busy sealing more or less successful international arms deals (Hughes 2005). It was, however, both countries’ general lack of organisation, logistics and equipment that momentarily halted the escalation of the skirmishes into a state of full-blown war (Scheina 2003, 86–7).\n\nWhile the belligerent nations were trying to organise their armed forces, the latter continued to build fortines and slowly advance in the Chaco whilst closely observing each other’s movements. The decisive factor in the building of fortines was access to potable water. The lack of proper roads and transport possibilities, and the sheer distance that both armies had to travel to reach the heart of the disputed territory, meant that a local water source was key to the troops’ survival. Whoever controlled a well or a lake controlled the surrounding area. The progression of the war was thus ultimately dictated by the respective armies’ access to and control of water sources in the area, meaning that ‘Water [was] more important to warfare in the Chaco than fuel’ (Klassen 1993, 71; and see Chapter 3). Whereas rising water levels often led to the evacuation of inadequately positioned outposts along the Pilcomayo River, the serious water scarcity in the Central Chaco turned the establishment of fortines into a challenging endeavour (Farcau 1996, 30).\n\nUnsurprisingly then, the discovery of a large freshwater lake by a Paraguayan patrol further exacerbated tensions between the two nations. It was with the help of the Chamacoco/Ishir indigenous people that soldiers led by General Belaieff reached the extensive water source in March 1931, and by July the Paraguayan army had constructed Fortín Carlos Antonio López, a small outpost on the shores of the lagoon, which came to be known as Lake Pitiantuta to the Paraguayans and, later, Lake Chuquisaca to the Bolivians. As control over a freshwater lake as big as Lake Pitiantuta/Chuquisaca in the centre of the arid Chaco scrubland was strategically vital for both sides, Bolivia soon seized what they supposedly believed to have been an abandoned Paraguayan outpost in June 1932 (Farcau 1996, 30–1). One month later, a successful counterattack by Paraguay was followed by a Bolivian seizure of various Paraguayan fortines and the partial mobilisation of the nation (Farcau 1996, 29–36; Querejazu Calvo 1975, 31–50). Paraguay reacted with a full mobilisation and with the appointment of Lt Col. José Félix Estigarribia, deputy chief of staff, as head of Paraguayan field operations. To this day, Estigarribia remains undoubtedly Paraguay’s most celebrated national hero from the Chaco War, after which he briefly served as President from 1939 to his sudden death in a plane crash in 1940. In the Chaco campaign he acted against official orders to stay on the defensive and launched what came to be known as the First Battle of Boquerón or the First Paraguayan Offensive (Scheina 2003, 93; and see Chapter 5).\n\nDavid Zook writes that in the morning hours of 9 September 1932, ‘the enthusiastic, inexperienced young Paraguayan army disturbed the silence of dawn with “¡Viva el Paraguay!” [Long live Paraguay!]’ (Zook 1960, 94). Although the Paraguayan attackers dramatically outnumbered the men stationed inside Fortín Boquerón, they ignored the additional defensive structures that the Bolivians had added to the original small Paraguayan fort. In the end, it took Estigarribia’s troops a further long and agonising 28 days before the Bolivian outpost and its close to 500 remaining exhausted defendants were finally under their control (Farcau 1996, 62).\n\nTheir defeat by South America’s smallest and poorest nation in the Battle of Boquerón knocked the confidence of the Bolivian army and nation. They had firmly believed that it would be relatively easy to emerge victorious from the war, as they were superior to their neighbour in both weaponry and manpower. Low morale and poor preparation, however, resulted in Bolivia also losing fortines Toledo, Arce and Alihuatá (Scheina 2003, 95). In December 1932, Kundt was made General-in-Chief of the Field Army by then-President Salamanca. Paraguayan Fortín Nanawa constituted Kundt’s chief target (see Chapter 5). Considered the ‘backbone’ of the Paraguayan defences (Scheina 2003, 96), the site was of great strategic importance to both sides. Nanawa constituted Bolivia’s gateway to the Paraguay River and, consequently, the ocean (Zook 1960, 127–8). A Bolivian advance to the river and, eventually, the port town of Concepción would have been a threat to Paraguay’s survival as a nation – a menace still all too present in people’s minds from the War of the Triple Alliance (Chesterton 2013). The attack on the Paraguayan fortín came to be known as the First Battle of Nanawa (20–26 January 1933). Failing to secure the outpost, the Bolivians dug themselves into a defensive line in front of the fortín while elsewhere in the Chaco various outposts kept changing hands during a number of attacks (Scheina 2003, 97; Zook 1960, 129). After a failed attempt to come to a border settlement with the help of the League of Nations and almost a year after the Lake Pitiantuta/Chuquisaca incident, Paraguay officially declared war on Bolivia on 10 May 1933 (Zook 1960, 139–42).\n\nFrom 4 to 9 July 1933, the Bolivians staged the Second Battle of Nanawa by launching a massive frontal attack on the fortín but despite the use of artillery, aeroplanes, tanks and flamethrowers, they were soon overthrown by the Paraguayan forces (Farcau 1996, 129–40). Throughout the war Kundt repeated the strategic mistake of going on the offensive – a tactic borrowed from the Germans on the Eastern Front in the First World War that proved equally ineffective in the Chaco bush. Kundt, often without any clear objectives and plans and without any knowledge of the terrain, had evidently failed to learn from his previous mistakes (Zook 1960, 148).\n\nThroughout 1933 Paraguay advanced further into the Chaco under the capable command of Estigarribia, who had now been promoted to the rank of general. The Bolivians experienced a devastating defeat at Campo Vía and their weakened forces were no longer able to hold their military headquarters at Muñoz. Finally, a 20-day Christmas ceasefire was agreed upon by the exhausted belligerents (Farcau 1996, 149–64). Not long after fighting had resumed in January 1934, the Bolivian President was forced to resign and, blamed by the nation for Bolivia’s high losses, Kundt was finally replaced by General Peñaranda (Zook 1960, 210–15).\n\nAfter a Paraguayan win at the Battle of El Carmen and the capture of Fortín Ballivián – a major Bolivian base on the Pilcomayo River – the tables suddenly seemed to turn. Having almost reached the foot of the Andes, the Paraguayan supply lines grew, and resources shrank (Farcau 1996, 162). Nonetheless, General Estigarribia made some further large advances in the north and finally entered undisputed Bolivian territory in January 1934. Faced with unfamiliar hilly terrain and a fully stretched supply line, the Paraguayan troops’ morale was low and advance towards the Bolivian oilfields petered out. Although the Bolivian forces were better equipped and trained for fighting in the Andes Mountains, their military leaders were incapable of staging a major offensive against the now disadvantaged enemy (Scheina 2003, 102–3). In reality, both sides were simply economically, physically and psychologically exhausted.\n\nAt last, a truce was arranged on 12 June 1935. A little over a month later generals Peñaranda and Estigarribia met up amidst the trenches of no man’s land to shake hands in a symbolic act of mutual respect and appreciation for the bravery of the opposing army (Querejazu Calvo 1975, 480–2). It was not until 21 June 1938, however, that a peace treaty was signed in Buenos Aires. Astonishingly, it would take an additional 71 years before a final report on the official demarcation of the international boundary between Bolivia and Paraguay was presented in a 2009 meeting – an event described by the Bolivian President Evo Morales as a ‘historic day for Bolivia and Paraguay, a time of friendship and peace, of solidarity between the peoples’ (quoted in Ziegler 2016, 175).\n\nA historiography of the Forgotten War\n\nWhilst I have earlier referred to the Chaco War as the ‘Forgotten War’, over the past 80 years significant Spanish-language publications on the Chaco War have been published in Paraguay and Bolivia. Nonetheless, these histories of the war are embedded in their own social, historical and political contexts. An exploration of these sources thus helps explain the need for an archaeological approach to the Chaco War and its material and discursive legacies.\n\nThe post-war years witnessed the birth of a literary movement known as la Generación del Chaco (the Chaco Generation), with its most famous contribution being the novel Hijo de hombre (Son of Man) by Paraguayan writer Augusto Roa Bastos, first published in 1960. Many of the books written in the decades following the war are personal accounts by men who fought on both sides. Surprisingly, the majority of these texts are of a technical rather than a sentimental nature. They also tend to be heavily biased and often express nationalist sentiments (e.g. Macias c. 1940; Olmedo 1959; Benítez 1976). There exist, however, a small number of books that yield insight into the Bolivian and Paraguayan soldiers’ intimate experience of the horrors of industrial wars. Often beautifully written, these narratives move beyond the practicalities and logistics of warfare. Indeed, these personal accounts are ‘riddled with sounds, whiffs, stenches, the feel of violence as well as the tender caresses’ (Smith 2015, 5) and thus represent a vivid image of the soldiers’ struggle to survive in the Chaco scrubland (e.g. Céspedes 1973, 1975; Sarmiento 1978; Zotti 1974; Florentín 1984; Bustamante Rodríguez 1987; Paniagua 1994).\n\nPatriotic tendencies are further reflected in the Paraguayan and Bolivian traditional military histories dealing with the organisation of the respective armies, the type of weaponry employed and the military strategies implemented in combat (e.g. Ríos 1950; Olmedo 1959; Espínola 1960; Machuca 1962; Adorno Benítez 1963; Mendoza 2013). One of the most famous Paraguayan military histories is the reproduction of Marshal Estigarribia’s field diary (Estigarribia 1950). Although Estigarribia focuses on a technical retelling of the Chaco campaign, personal reflections on the events nonetheless occur from time to time (see also Bray 1981). As many of the other authors of military histories were veterans like Estigarribia and not necessarily academics, their work often lacks proper referencing. Their historical accuracy is questionable at times, and I have been cautious in the interpretation of both military histories and personal accounts written by Paraguayan and Bolivian nationals.\n\nIn contrast, the more nuanced local sources seem to be those produced by historians of the two protagonist nations. In the case of Paraguay, the works of Alfredo Seiferheld, Luis Verón and Hugo Mendoza represent a more nuanced view on the events. While Seiferheld (1983) sheds light on the diplomatic and economic history of the war (see also Chiavenato 1989), Verón (2010) and Mendoza (2013) provide concise but informative military histories of the events. Although both publications show a deep knowledge of the topic, they remain very much in the diplomatic and military realm. Across the border, however, Roberto Querejazu Calvo (1975) manages to reveal a more intimate account of the Bolivian soldiers’ personal experiences without adopting a nationalistic undertone.\n\nBesides the military and diplomatic histories written about the war, there are a small number of specialised publications in Spanish, German and French that stand out. These include Gabriela Dalla-Corte Caballero’s work on photography, cinema and literature on the war (2012a), as well as her study on the Casado family and the railway in the Chaco (2012b). Silvio Gaona’s (1964) book on the chaplains of the Chaco War and Juan E. Melgarejo’s (1969) study, which highlights the communication methods used by both armies during the war, also add to the Chaco War literature. Further examples are General Belaieff’s (1934) short but thorough report on the Paraguayan fortifications and water situation and Estela Mary Sosa’s (2010) work on women’s role during the Chaco campaign (for an English-language source on women’s role during the war see Chesterton 2014). English-language sources dedicated to the study of specific aspects of the conflict include Hagedorn and Sapienza (1997), exploring the emergence of air warfare in a South American context, and Bridget María Chesterton and Anatoly V. Isaenko’s (2014) article on Belaieff’s perception of the Chaco landscape as a White Russian.\n\nIn Paraguay, a small number of books have been written in German and Spanish on the Mennonite experience of the war. As the authors are members of the Chaco Mennonite communities themselves, one has to be careful in evaluating the material. The brothers Peter and Paulhans Klassen have published extensively on the subject but these works repeatedly interweave fact with fiction and often lack proper referencing (Klassen 1993; Klassen 2008, 2009, 2010). This contrasts with Gerhard Ratzlaff’s (2009) scholarly book, in which he convincingly argues for the importance of minority religious communities in the unfolding of the events with documentary sources and photographs.\n\nPerhaps the most significant contributions dealing with a specific aspect of the war are those exposing the hidden voices of the indigenous populations affected by the conflict. Written by a group of historians, anthropologists and ethnographers, Richard (2008a) and Capdevila et al. (2010) examine the indigenous experience of the war and the relationships between the militaries and indigenous people of the region (see also Richard, Capdevila and Boidin 2007). They combine historical research with oral testimonies from members of the various indigenous communities. Topics addressed include indigenous exploitation, colonialism, cultural change and land struggles. Unfortunately, the books remain largely inaccessible to the English-speaking world (for concise English sources on the indigenous involvement in the war see Harder Horst 2006, 2010; Langer 2016).\n\nEnglish-language literature on the Chaco War is limited both in sources and in its focus, as it almost exclusively concentrates on the military, political and diplomatic history of the conflict (for a diplomatic history of the Chaco Peace Conference after the war in English see Rout 1970). Zook (1960) constitutes the earliest and one of the best-researched English sources on the war. It was only in 1996 that Bruce W. Farcau published The Chaco War: Bolivia and Paraguay, 1932–1935. While both books give a detailed synopsis of the events and their antecedents, Farcau also manages to periodically expose the humans holding the guns by referring to the demoralising state of the soldiers and the trenches they fought in. For those who seek a brief introduction to the war, Alejandro de Quesada and Philip Jowett’s (2011) illustrated volume is an adequate source. Filled with colourful images and black and white photographs, it gives a thin but nonetheless satisfactory overview of the armies, major battles and the war’s aftermath. Matthew Hughes’s (2005) article, which focuses solely on the logistics of the war, is a further useful contribution. There are also a number of general texts that dedicate chapters to the Chaco War. Two examples are Scheina (2003) and De La Pedraja (2006). Even though both books compress the conflict into one chapter, they nonetheless manage to give a good overview of the major battles. Yet whereas Scheina and De La Pedraja focus mainly on the military operations, Peter Lambert and Andrew Nickson compiled a number of texts that include poetry and personal anecdotes by veterans into one chapter in The Paraguay Reader (2013).\n\nTwo English-language texts that stand out are Bridget María Chesterton’s excellent The Grandchildren of Solano López: Frontier and Nation in Paraguay, 1904–1936 (2013) and her edited volume The Chaco War: Environment, Ethnicity, and Nationalism (2016). The former looks at the development of Paraguayan nationalism through the nation’s ideas of history, nationhood and mestizo identity and how all of this has shaped and has been shaped by the Chaco frontier. In her edited book Chesterton has managed to collect a large variety of papers on the Chaco War covering topics such as the impact of oil on Bolivia and the war (Cote 2016), the social differences amongst Bolivian prisoners in Paraguay (Shesko 2016), the Bolivian effort of national development through modern infrastructure (Nobbs-Thiessen 2016), the role of Asunción’s botanical garden in the creation of Paraguayan notions of space and national identity, indigenous resistance (Langer 2016) and the disclosure of the more fleeting and intimate moments of the war through the material culture that was created and left behind (Breithoff 2016).\n\n***\n\nA human tragedy for both sides, and for the indigenous people involved, the war – which supposedly ended sin vencedores ni vencidos (without winners or losers) – resulted nonetheless in a Paraguayan claim over a large part of the disputed area. The Paraguayan success in the Chaco War can be attributed to a multitude of factors. The newly arrived Mennonites had done their share by materialising their host country’s vision for the Chaco: establishing a firm human presence, exploiting the land in the western understanding of the term and reconnecting it with the rest of the patria. Whereas Bolivia suffered from international isolation, weak military leaders, tumultuous internal politics and long supply lines, Paraguay enjoyed support from neighbouring countries such as Argentina, excellent military command and a better infrastructure to get soldiers and supplies to a relatively close front line (Hughes 2005, 416).\n\nYet the logistical, political and economic aspects that make up the diplomatic and military histories of the conflict often overshadow the personal, human elements that helped shape the outcome of the war. Although thousands of men from both countries suffered and lost their lives in the bush, the Paraguayan soldiers’ attitude to the Chaco contrasted heavily with that of their Bolivian counterparts. Due to the patriotic sentiment instilled in them, the Paraguayans recognised the Chaco – at least mentally – as an intrinsic part of their homeland and its defence as an honourable duty. This was simplified by the Paraguayan familiarity with the local climate and, to a lesser extent, vegetation. To the Bolivians, on the other hand, the Chaco represented a completely alien landscape as they were unaccustomed to its oppressive heat and dense forests. Even though this resulted in low morale, the Bolivians kept fighting for what they were told was rightfully theirs.\n\nParaguayan writer Justo Pastor Benítez once claimed that ‘the Chaco is not a green hell but a beautiful region that is in need of human touch, contact with work instruments, without which all of earth’s territories would be uninhabitable deserts’ (Benítez 1976, 99). On the eve of war, the belligerent nations both saw their armies as carriers of modernity and ‘pioneers of civilization’ (Capdevila 2010, 28). In their eyes, the Chaco was a blank sheet, an empty place that was waiting to be bestowed with the gift of civilisation in the form of fenced pastures and military outposts. Paraguay and Bolivia ignored the fact that the Chaco had already been inhabited and exploited by various indigenous groups with their own complex societies and lifeworlds. Nonetheless, both nations made recourse to their own indigenous heritage in an effort to justify their territorial rights over the Chaco. They considered it national territory even though the place was completely alien to them. Still, they rushed to defend what they believed was a neglected but intrinsic part of their respective patria. However ‘exotic’ and ‘foreign’ it was in reality, the Chaco was ‘national’ in the Bolivian and Paraguayan minds. In the words of Luc Capdevila, the ‘Chaco War took place in a space that was simultaneously different and familiar, foreign and patrimonial … a territory that was both empty and roamed; inhabited and valued by ten thousands of indigenous people but not exploited in an apparent way’ (Capdevila 2010, 33).\n\nNotes\n\n1. In Paraguay people commonly refer to the jaguar as tigre (Spanish for tiger) or yaguareté (Guaraní for jaguar) and to the puma as león (Spanish for lion). During the war the Paraguayan soldiers referred to the Chamacoco (Ishir) Indian as Moro (Richard 2008c, 75–6).\n\n2. Although they were all of Mennonite faith and denomination, the three colonies differed – and still differ – significantly in cultural practices. The Menno, who were by far the most conservative group, were several generations removed from their Russian heritage and struggled to identify with both the Fernheimer and the Neuländer. Even though Colonia Fernheim and Colonia Neuland were both founded by refugees from Russia and Ukraine respectively and shared some of the hardships endured under Communist rule, they did not seem to bond over their common experiences. Marlene Epp suggests this is owing to the fact that by the time Neuland was founded, Menno and Fernheim had only just started to stand on their own two feet after years of challenges and hard work in the Paraguayan wilderness; they might therefore have been reluctant to engage with the newcomers (Epp 2002, 97–8).\n\n3. Kamp (German) or campo (Spanish) is a term used to describe a grassland plain – a large open area covered in high espartilla or bitter grass (Elionurus múticus) and the occasional large tree. Kamps were very common in the Central Chaco during the time of the Mennonite immigration and the Chaco War. As the lack of coverage meant high exposure to the enemy, traversing a Kamp was extremely risky for soldiers during the war. Today, Kamps are a rare sight as most of them have been turned into agricultural land."
