The recollection of the many debts accumulated on this journey cannot but begin in the Chaco. The people who are these pages’ protagonists are an indissoluble part of who I am today, hence it is diﬃcult to adequately convey the depth of my gratitude. Dionisio Díaz (deceased), Nicanor Jaime (Nedói), Secundino Lucas, Pedro Martínez, Marcelo Núñez, Emilio Rivero (Locohé),Toribio Sánchez, and Eusebio Solís (Lagachidí) have been crucial companions in my ethnographic forays, and in moments of confusion I always counted on their patient, illuminating comments. Their warmth and generosity have been directly proportional to the enjoyment I felt talking with them. Andrés Cardoso (DaríloGo), Miguel Jaime, Chicho Martín (Cadácho), Ramón Morales, and Esteban Moreno (Táico) have shared countless conversations and/or numerous hunting and ﬁshing trips with me. It is especially from them that I learned what I know about the experience of Toba men in the bush and the Pilcomayo marshes. It would be impossible to list here the rest of the Toba who in one way or another contributed with their voices and hospitality to the ﬁnal outcome of this book. Nonetheless, I must mention Rodolfo Setacain and his wife Marta Moreno (deceased), Mateo Alto, Adolfo Caín, Martín Carlos, Pedro Cuchi, Emilio Cuellar, Celestino Cuellar, Alberto Díaz, José Ernesto, Manuel Estrada, Victor Filemón, Nélida Florentín, Antonio García, Ramón Jaime, Juan Larrea, Nicolás Larrea, Gil Lazarte, Fabreciana Luis, Tita Luis, Mariano Méndez, Luis Mendoza (deceased), Osvaldo Molina, Benigno Morales, Hugo Morales, Susana Morales, Pedro Nagadí, Andrés Pérez, Humberto Pérez, Norma Pérez, Quico Pérez, Santa Pérez, Julio Reginaldo, Orquera Reginaldo, Basilio Roque (deceased), Juan Rosendo (deceased), Evencio Sánchez, Teodoro Segovia, Luisa Segundo, Asuzena Tenaiquín (deceased), Valeria Urquiza, Dionisia Yanqui, José Manuel Yanqui, and Mario Zacarías. Throughout this book, I refer to people currently alive with pseudonyms. In 1987, when I was an anthropology undergraduate at the Universi-\n\nxvi Acknowledgments\n\ndad de Buenos Aires anxious to learn what ﬁeldwork was all about, Marcela Mendoza took me to the Toba villages for the ﬁrst time, an experience that changed me forever. I cannot stop thanking her for that. Ever since then, Marcela has provided me with countless insights on Toba culture, memory, and history and shared with me invaluable information and documents. Our exchange of ideas became particularly intense and fruitful when I was completing my dissertation in 1998. Luis María de la Cruz has been my other crucial interlocutor on the Toba, and we had long conversations about some of the topics analyzed in this book. His work among the Toba on land claims and his commitment to indigenous rights have always been a source of inspiration. Additionally, Luis María enormously facilitated my ﬁeldwork by allowing me to use his house in one of the Toba villages. María Lia Bargalló was my companion in four trips to the Toba villages between 1988 and 1991. Our ﬁeldwork experience and her sensitivity shaped the contours of my future research in ways I could then not foresee. In the city of Formosa, Ana Mosquera was a generous host with whom I shared concerns and projects. José Alsina (deceased) guided me into piles of documents at the Formosa Historical Archives, an institution he rescued from oblivion. Bishops Humberto Axt and David Leake, of the Argentinean Anglican Church, kindly shared memories of their experiences among the Toba. I am especially grateful to David Leake for allowing me to reproduce photos from his family archive. Colleagues and friends in the Department of Anthropology at the Universidad de Buenos Aires contributed to this book in multiple, intricate ways. It was there—as an undergraduate student, teaching assistant, and graduate research fellow—that I learned what critical thinking is all about. Special thanks to Juan Martín Leguizamón, a brother in arms and a source of inspiration for his commitment to an anthropology grounded in people’s concerns. For their intellectual stimulation I am also grateful to Ricardo Abduca, Fernando Balbi, Claudia Briones, Diego Escolar, Valeria Hernández, Leda Kantor, Axel Lazzari, Patricia Monsalve, Carlos Prego, Alejandra Siﬀredi, Héctor Hugo Trinchero, and Marcelo Urquía. The Department of Anthropology at the University of Toronto provided the ferment to produce the dissertation that led to this book. I owe to Gavin Smith the motivation to ask the right questions. Richard B. Lee was a fundamental pillar of my subsequent work. It is hard to accurately express the strength of Gavin’s and Richard’s support as my dissertation coadvisors, how much I learned from them, and how much I\n\nAcknowledgments xvii\n\nadmire them. The 1997–98 dissertation-writing group in Toronto created a weekly space of insightful comments and criticism. Thanks to Andrew Martindale, Robin Oakley, Warren Olivo, Dee Rose, Celia Rothenberg, Heike Schimkat, and Andrew Walsh. John Comaroﬀ made the most detailed, thorough, and challenging comments I could have ever expected from an external thesis examiner. The richness and scope of his suggestions were critical to redeﬁne this book. The following people, some of them close friends, read parts of the manuscript in its various stages or enriched it with their observations: Arianne Dorval, Michael Lambek, Bill Levitt, Cynthia Milton, Juan Manuel Obarrio, Stuart Philpott, Natacha Pravaz,Valeria Procupez, Paula Pryce, Anke Schwittay, Gerald Sider, Renée Sylvain, Michael Taussig, Claudia Vicencio, and Pablo Wright. My dialogues with Elena Arengo on the intricate histories of the Chaco proved particularly inﬂuential. Kari Jones accompanied me through several stages of this manuscript’s development and contributed much to it. Tomás Eloy Martínez helped me solve the mystery of Juan Domingo Perón’s presence in San Martín del Tabacal, as the Toba currently remember it. In May 1998, my friend and colleague Hernán Julio Vidal passed away in a tragic accident while doing ﬁeldwork in Patagonia.The ﬁnal chapter owes much to my dialogues with Hernán on the cultural power of international borders. I wrote and rewrote the revisions during an intense three-year North American tour that took me through New Haven, Cambridge, Ithaca, and Vancouver. As a visiting fellow in the Program in Agrarian Studies at Yale University (1999–2000), I had the privilege of enjoying a remarkably stimulating and collegial context in which to rethink, reread, and rewrite. Jim Scott was the legend who made this environment possible. Kay Mansﬁeld’s warmth and unconditional support had a lot to do with my fabulous year in Agrarian Studies. My cofellows at Yale critically read several chapters: special thanks to Henry Bernstein, Richard Grove, Cindy Hahamovitch, Jeanette Keith, Joan Martínez-Alier, Scott Nelson, Gabriele RasulyPaleczek, and Paula Worby. Rohan D’Souza deserves a special mention for asking the unsettling question, for his faith in the revolution, and for his sense of humor and friendship. I turned around the manuscript, again and again, at Harvard University as a Visiting Scholar in the Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies (2000–2001), at Cornell University as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology (2001–2002), and ﬁnally in Vancouver as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology and Sociology at\n\nxviii Acknowledgments\n\nthe University of British Columbia. Colleagues and friends at these institutions further encouraged me to rethink some of the ideas presented in this book, especially Alexia Bloch, Rima Brusi, Felix Girón, Vince Brown, and Ajantha Subramanian. Valerie Millholland, my editor at Duke University Press, supported this manuscript from the time I ﬁrst contacted her. The two reviewers for the press provided me with a careful and thought-provoking reading that helped me tighten and improve the argument. Special thanks to Tania Li (‘‘reader number two,’’ as I learned later) for her challenging remarks on the conceptual, stylistic, and ethnographic knots I needed to untangle. LynnWalterick’s copy-editing skills saved me from those cryptic sentences and inconsistencies I thought I had left behind. My parents Teresa Ana Schiaﬃno and Agustín Gordillo, their partners Ricardo López Alfonsino and Mónica Merlín, and my siblings Hernán, Camila, and Bárbara are all an important part of these pages. Mariano Cerdá and Javier Iñón know better than anybody the personal circumstances in which, over the years, I set out for the Chaco. Their friendship was a crucial part of my experience in the ﬁeld. Florencia Esteverena was the immensely loving and patient light that helped me lead this manuscript through turbulent waters. Fieldwork for this research was funded by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research (Predoctoral grant no. 6503), the Universidad de Buenos Aires (Secretaría de Ciencia y Técnica), the University of Toronto (Connaught Foundation and School of Graduate Studies), and the Ministry of Education and Training of the Province of Ontario. My sincere gratitude to these institutions. There is someone I never met but to whom I am also indebted: Alfred Métraux, who did ﬁeldwork among the Toba in 1933 and 1939. Encapsulating the experience of many of us who love the Chaco intensely but often wish to ﬁnd relief from its implacable geography, he wrote in 1939 in two parts of his diary: Le Chaco est diﬃcile à décrire, mais j’en aime tous les aspects. . . . J’en veux à cette radio qui m’arrache du Chaco.—The Chaco is hard to describe, but I love everything about it. . . . I resent that radio that pulls me out of the Chaco.\n\nLandscapes of Devils\n\nIntroduction The dialectic . . . is a logical absurdity as long as there is talk of the change of one ‘‘thing’’ into another ‘‘thing.’’ . . . That is to say, its premise is that things should be shown to be aspects of processes. . . . Thus the knowledge that social facts are not objects but relations between men is intensiﬁed to the point where facts are wholly dissolved into processes. —Georg Lukács, History and Class Consciousness\n\nThe western Argentinean Chaco is dominated by a landscape that is ﬂat, monotonous, and often overwhelming: el monte, the bush. The dirt roads that cut through the region are surrounded by forest and often look like frail marks of human presence trying to prevent nature from fully taking over. Wherever one looks, the thick succession of hardwoods, cacti, and shrubs, six to twelve meters high, extends like a mantle over a dry, dusty soil. In the northwest of the province of Formosa, one of the hinterland roads ends near the border with Paraguay, where a dozenToba villages are scattered south of the marshlands formed by the Pilcomayo River. These hamlets momentarily break the dominance of the bush yet are also subordinated to its unyielding presence. From every household, while chatting next to a ﬁre, making handicrafts, or preparing food, women and men can see the mass of vegetation surrounding them. Most of them enter the bush often to gather honey, wild fruits, or ﬁrewood, to hunt, visit their ﬁelds, or go ﬁshing in the marshes. And many of their memories, anecdotes, and conversations hinge in one way or another on this place. Yet despite its sheer presence, people remember that the bush did not exist in the past.When they refer to their ancestors, who roamed those same lands in foraging bands prior to their defeat by the Argentinean army and the arrival of Criollo settlers in the 1910s, they emphasize that they inhabited a world of wide grasslands, free of forest. These memories remind many Toba that the bush is not simply a\n\n2 Introduction\n\n1. Bush trail in Toba lands. Photo by author.\n\nnatural component of the landscape but a historical product intrinsically linked to their incorporation within the Argentinean nation-state and their demise as a politically autonomous group. This history has constituted Toba subjectivity and produced the local geography, in a process in which the forces that made the Toba what they are today are the same that created the bush. This entanglement of space, history, and subjectivity involved not just the Chaco interior but also practices that connected the emerging bush with other geographies. In the early twentieth century, state violence, settler colonization, and the consolidation of a capitalist frontier 300 kilometers to the west drew the Toba and other indigenous groups into the orbit of sugar plantations as a seasonal labor force. This pattern of migration was a further and potent force in the making of the bush, as the place where people constructed a relative haven from labor exploitation yet also as the site deprived of commodities that fostered their annual return to the sugar cane ﬁelds. In the mid and late 1990s, Toba men and women had stopped working at the plantations but their memories of ‘‘the mountains’’—kahogonaGá, as they refer to the cane ﬁelds because of their location next to the ﬁrst Andean ranges—were a forceful presence in their lands.1 These memories remind most Toba that the spatial product of their immersion within a capitalist political economy, the bush, is also the place where they carved out relative shelter from it. The spatial sedimentation of this tension between exploitation and relative autonomy emerges in many aspects of Toba practice and subjectivity, among them the devil imageries that, in\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nMap 1. Relative location of the Toba\n\ncontrasting ways, impregnate the memory of the plantations and current experiences of the bush. As we shall see, the action of devils captures some of the major social contradictions constituting these geographies. In this book I unravel the historical experiences, tensions, and places that have produced the bush as a contested social process. My premise is that places are produced in tension with other geographies and that these tensions are made tangible through the spatialization of memory. These spatial connections turn places, as Doreen Massey has argued, into processes that are necessarily ‘‘extroverted’’: that is, open to ‘‘a constellation of social relations meeting and weaving together at a particular locus’’ (1994:154, 142, 155). The constellation of social relations meeting to conﬁgure the bush links it not only to the sugar plantations but also to other places through a complex network of practices and memories. Some of these sites had by the 1990s disappeared; others had emerged only recently. Yet all of them were tied to the memory of the mountains and the grasslands in the making of the bush. In this study, I examine how these places have been constituted by state terror, Anglican missionization, disease and labor exploitation, healing and shamanism, sexuality, commodity fetishism, state hegemony, and practices of accommodation and resistance. Devil imageries, and the contradictory forms of estrangement and reciprocity they evoke, are one of the main threads weaving through the spatialization of these experiences.\n\n4 Introduction\n\nThe Absolute Spatialization of Practice Inﬂuenced by the prioritization of time over space that has dominated Western philosophy since the Enlightenment, most anthropological studies of social memory have tended to focus on the temporal aspects of remembering: that is, on constructions of the past and their cultural, ideological, or political dimensions (e.g., Abercrombie 1998; Cole 2001; Lambek 1996; Rappaport 1990; Swedenburg 1991; Trouillot 1995).2 And those who have conceptually tackled the spatial components of memory, for their part, have usually done so from a phenomenological perspective that overlooks the role of power relations and history in the making of senses of place (see Basso 1996; Casey 1987, 1996; Feld 1996).3 In this book I merge the experiential dimensions of place making with the political economy that makes it possible by examining the materiality of memory, its embodiment in practice, and its constitution as a social force in the production of places. In his Prison Notebooks, Antonio Gramsci advocated a theory of practice grounded in what he called, in opposition to idealism and objectivist materialism, the ‘‘absolute secularization and earthliness of thought’’ (1971:465). Here I expand this earthliness to include what I would call the absolute spatialization of practice. My analytical point of departure is the fact that every memory is, in a fundamental way, the memory of a place. Faces, casual encounters, or collective struggles are remembered not in a vacuum but in a locale that makes them meaningful. And this spatiality is crucial for an anthropological understanding of memory. This process does not involve memories unfolding on an arrested spatial matrix but a dynamic process of place production. Henri Lefebvre (1991) has forcefully argued that our gaze should move away from ‘‘things in space’’ (space as a rigid template) and toward the production of space (space as the product of action). This means, ﬁrst, conceiving of memory as a component of practice involved in place making and, second, integrating Toba memories with the historical practices that have produced the bush physically, politically, and culturally. My analysis draws on recent scholarship in anthropology and geography that has examined how places are historically made and unmade through practice, ﬁelds of power and struggle, and networks of social relations (see Gupta and Ferguson 1997; Ferguson and Gupta 2002; Harvey 1989, 1996, 2000, 2001; Massey 1994; Mitchell 1996; Moore 1998; Raﬄes 1999, 2002; Rodman 1992; N. Smith 1984; Stewart 1996). Yet in these pages\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nI examine an often-overlooked aspect of place making: that places are the result of the social contradictions embedded in them. The study of these contradictions is crucial to dismantle the appearance of places as wellbounded entities, for it reveals, ﬁrst, the fractures and struggles that make them ongoing, unstable, and unﬁnished historical processes and, second, the relations that integrate them with other geographies. In Toba historical experience, the most recurrent tension shaping local landscapes is the one opposing wage labor to hunting, ﬁshing, and gathering. Henri Lefebvre (1991:365) argued that social contradictions create spatial contradictions. Likewise, the contradiction between what most Toba call marisca (foraging) and trabajo (work) expresses a tension between different social relations of production and experiences that have produced places of relative autonomy in the bush and places of exploitation on plantations and (more recently) farms.4 Even though this tension is central to my argument, I do not analyze it in a bipolar fashion (or as the expression of a ‘‘dual economy’’); rather, I examine it as the uneven spatial manifestation of a single social practice that involves further contradictions and multiple geographies and, for that reason, undermines a clear-cut distinction between neatly bounded places. As we shall see, the foundation of an Anglican station in Toba lands in 1930, where British missionaries banned dances and other practices regarded as immoral, turned the sugar plantations into places of sexual excess free of missionary discipline. Similarly, the nostalgia that in the mid-1990s manyToba expressed for the commodities earned at the plantations, as well as the availability of public-sector jobs in the nearby municipality, informed perceptions that the bush was a place of poverty, hardship, and unrewarding eﬀorts. These dimensions illustrate that places are processes riddled with tensions and anticipate some of the multisited practices examined in chapters to come. My approach to labor contradictions, rather than being based on an objectivist approach to production, fully immerses them in social subjectivity. This book draws on the work of a growing number of authors who, critical of reiﬁed and ahistorical notions of culture, have examined the dynamism of cultural production in particular historical and political settings (Comaroﬀ 1985; Comaroﬀ and Comaroﬀ 1991, 1997, 1999; Gupta and Ferguson 1997; Roseberry 1989; Sider 1986; Smith 1991, 1999). In these pages, I analyze cultural meanings as they are produced by historical experiences. My use of this concept follows the legacy of Edward Thompson (1966; 1978a; 1978b), who has examined collective experiences that are as subjective as they are the product of ﬁelds of domination and confron-\n\n6 Introduction\n\ntation. This historical notion of experience is critical to account for the cultural and spatial dimensions of practice, for it is through experience that history leaves a mark on memory and guides action in the production of places. Experience, in other words, is both a product and a creative force, in a process in which, as Raymond Williams put it, subjectivity is ‘‘under continual pressure from experience’’ (1961:101; see 1977:166).5 My reference to contradictions tearing through places and labor experiences requires a brief clariﬁcation of my understanding of the dialectic, which will nevertheless become clear only as my historical and ethnographic narrative progresses. One of the most widespread misconceptions about the dialectic is that it involves an ‘‘interaction’’ between separate entities in which they ‘‘shape each other.’’ 6 Being a practice that undermines reiﬁed dichotomies, the dialectic in fact dismantles the very idea of interplay between separate ‘‘things.’’ As Georg Lukács writes, the premise of the dialectic is that ‘‘things should be shown to be aspects of processes’’ and as a result ‘‘the knowledge that social facts are not objects but relations between men is intensiﬁed to the point where facts are wholly dissolved into processes’’ (1971:179–80, emphasis in original; see Adorno 1973:145). Similarly, I aim to show that places such as the bush, the plantations, or the mission station are eminently relations between social actors and that these relations dissolve these places’ appearance of ﬁxity.Yet my approach is not simply relational; it is dialectical in the sense that it takes these relations to unleash confrontations and oppositions. Among the Toba, such contradictions emerge in a spatialized habitus constituted by memory.\n\nOf Places, Embodied Memories, and Devils The people whose experiences, memories, and practices I examine in this book live in the west of the Gran Chaco region: a mostly semiarid plain that covers southeastern Bolivia, western Paraguay, and a good part of northern Argentina.7 Also known as Toba-Pilagá (Métraux 1937) and western Toba (Mendoza 2002),8 they form a group of 1,600 people historically and linguistically distinct from other Toba groups in Argentina, which live farther east and encompass a total population of about 30,000 (Arengo 1996; Cordeu and Siﬀredi 1971; Miller 1975, 1979, 1995, 1999; Wright 1992, 1997).9 Eastern and western Toba use the term Toba to refer to themselves (‘‘big forehead’’ in Guaraní, which refers to the now-abandoned practice of shaving their foreheads) and share the self-denomination Qom (people).\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nYet these groupings have been constituted as social subjects through different historical experiences (examined in chapter 2). Unless stated otherwise, all future mention of ‘‘the Toba’’ indicates the western Toba. During my ﬁeldwork, the memories of the sugar plantations, the mission, or the grasslands were recurrent occurrences in my conversations with people and in the daily interactions I observed in households, public places, farming camps, or bush trails. On numerous occasions I would hear elder men and women remembering past experiences as part of long monologues. Some children would listen next to them and adults would often pay attention from the distance and make comments or ask questions while conducting other activities. These moments of memory production were particularly important in the early morning hours around the household ﬁre, when family members gather to share a mate (a type of tea common in Argentina). At political meetings, it was also common to hear men insert memories within longer harangues about contemporary concerns. In addition to these everyday and relatively spontaneous sites of memory production, the Anglican services in local adobe churches provided more ritualized sites of commemoration. Sermons by Toba priests often hinged on the remembrance of the mission—destroyed by ﬂooding in 1975—and the un-Christian, violent landscapes that dominated the region prior to its foundation. While taping or making notes of memories in interviews or casual interactions, I repeatedly tried to locate the events being remembered in time. Yet dates were of little or no meaning to most people. It took me a while to realize that this responded not just to a cultural disregard for calendar time but to the weight of places in memory. As several chapters illustrate, what made these memories signiﬁcant were, rather than their temporal coordinates, the geographies they evoked.10 Places made these memories signiﬁcant in another way: through the fact that they were produced at particular sites—the villages, the bush, and the marshes—and at a particular moment in the conﬁguration of those sites: the mid and late 1990s.11 This location profoundly shaped the memories I registered in the ﬁeld and made them part of debates and concerns speciﬁc to that moment in their history, such as those triggered by the incipient social differentiation dividing the largest villages.12 The spatialization of memory was also apparent in people’s bodies. Memories were not only narrated or created ritually but also embodied in what Pierre Bourdieu (1977) has called ‘‘habitus’’: a set of dispositions for action. Diﬀerently constructed according to age, social status, and gender, the cultural sedimentation of\n\n8 Introduction\n\nToba historical experience has turned past memories into new values and patterns of behavior, in a process in which the marks memory leaves on the habitus remain when the remembrance of the experience that originated it may not (cf. Casey 1987; Connerton 1989). This embodiment is critical to place making, for as pointed out by Lefebvre (1991:162), ‘‘it is by means of the body that space is perceived, lived and produced.’’ The spirits the Toba call payák or diablos, devils, are probably the best illustration of the inscription of memory in their habitus and of the cultural and spatial signiﬁcance of labor contradictions; for this reason, they are one of the main themes articulating diﬀerent geographies throughout the book. For women and men, young and old, committed to the Anglican Church or critical of it, devils are a latent yet persistent presence in their lives. They are the dominant nonhuman presence in the places central to their practice and memories. Yet these spirits’ behavior, features, and type of interaction with humans are deeply contingent on their location. The term payák represents for most Toba the condition of potentially dangerous creatures or phenomena that cannot be fully explained or understood and therefore people often use the term as an adjective (see Métraux 1937:174; 1946a:16). For instance, creatures such as wosáq (‘‘rainbow’’ and the storms associated with it) or seemingly natural phenomena like kadáachi (whirlwinds) have or may have a payák nature.Yet this state is most graphically condensed in the beings—usually invisible but that can adopt changing physical shapes, like that of a hairy dwarf—which people also refer to by the term payák.13 In fact, most people use this term in this sense: as synonymous with evil spirit. Most Toba incorporated the term diablo as translation of payák through their experience of Anglican missionization. As part of a dualistic opposition between good and evil originally alien to local values, missionaries presented the Devil as the epitome of evil and emphasized that diabolical forces were behind practices at odds with the Gospels (as we shall see). Even though most Toba did not adopt the Christian idea of the Devil at face value, as a singular and distant entity, their interactions with the missionaries gradually enhanced the negative features associated with payák creatures, now seen as diablos. This merger between Christian imageries and ﬁgures prior to missionization was in turn reconﬁgured by the experience of labor migration and the contradictions it entailed. During the decades Toba men and women worked at the cane ﬁelds, they saw the plantations as places haunted by scores of devils that were\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nsources of terror, disease, and death, established no communication with humans, and made their alienation in those sites particularly apparent. The sedimentation of that memory of terror in their habitus, together with the articulation of diﬀerent practices and social relations in their lands, enhanced the reciprocity that links foragers to bush devils, which are seen by contrast (despite their often whimsical behavior) as sources of bush food and healing power. As a result of this contradictory experience of place, in diﬀerent sites the payák adopt heterogeneous features related to the labor practices, social relations, and tensions embedded in the landscape. The devils’ behavior informs how people relate to places, and this bodily predisposition is, I will show, inseparable from social memory. The diablos, in short, capture some of the spatial contrasts created by decades of labor migration, and this introductory outline anticipates some of the conceptual and ethnographic knots I tackle in chapters to come.\n\nOn Epistemology and Method When I set out to conduct the research that led to this study, my broadest aim was to overcome the dichotomy between objectivism and subjectivism by showing that the objectivity of places results from the historical and subjective forces that are behind it, a point inspired by Antonio Gramsci’s insistence that ‘‘objective’’ should be understood as humanly objective and ‘‘subjective’’ as historically subjective (1971:446). If I accomplished this goal in any way, I believe it was mostly possible because I began my Chaco journeys with an ‘‘objectivist moment’’ that examined the ﬁelds of force in which social action is immersed. I conducted ﬁeldwork among the Toba on numerous occasions, involving diﬀerent but closely interrelated research projects that span some ﬁfteen years. Between 1987 and 1993—ﬁrst as an anthropology undergraduate and then as a graduate research fellow at the Universidad de Buenos Aires—I spent a total of seven months in the Toba villages and worked on a perspective in political economy that examined the historical constraints imposed on people’s everyday forms of livelihood (see Gordillo 1992, 1994, 1995a, 1995b, 1996). Concerned as I was with issues of labor, domination, and history overlooked in Chaco ethnography, ‘‘culture’’ was at the time tangential to my research. Yet as I gradually became interested in subjectivity, memory, and place, my previous work proved\n\n10 Introduction\n\nvital for understanding these issues and, further, for trying to dissolve the very distinction between ‘‘political economy’’ and ‘‘culture’’ as separate analytical ﬁelds. In September 1993 I headed to the University of Toronto to pursue graduate work and process this epistemological transition. In August 1995 I returned for eighteen months to Argentina and the Toba villages to conduct the ﬁeldwork and the archival and library research for my dissertation. In June 1996 I visited other places central in Toba experiences and memories: a farm near Embarcación (Salta)—where I met a group of Toba men and women working as harvesters—and San Martín del Tabacal, the sugar plantation that absorbed most of their labor migrations in the twentieth century. When I was writing and revising the manuscript ﬁrst in Canada and then the United States, I returned to the Toba villages in August 1997, May 1999, and June–July 2000 (for a total of ten weeks) to wrap up ﬁnal aspects of the research. Most of my conversations and everyday interactions involved men but the dozen interviews I conducted with women allowed me to explore experiences, memories, and areas of contention shaped along gender lines. The three parts into which I divide the book can be considered moments in a movement that is simultaneously historical, spatial, and analytical. Because of the myriad relations I try to establish between diﬀerent geographies, my narrative opens up various levels of analysis and works on their manifold interpenetrations as the chapters unfold. This book is eminently historical in the sense that I accompany people’s memories on a journey that is as geographical as it is cultural and material. Believing that history is not just ‘‘the past’’ but the social forces that have produced the present, my narrative immerses the reader into the deep history that has created the memories I registered in the ﬁeld. But I do so through an approach that, while committed to a rigorous historiography, tries to break down an objectivist distinction between memory (what ‘‘they’’ think happened) and history (what ‘‘really’’ happened). Part I, ‘‘The Making of the Bush,’’ integrates processes old enough to escape Toba social memory with the more recent events that led to the Anglican evangelization, the end of ‘‘the time of the ancient ones,’’ and the emergence of the bush as a new geography. The making of Toba lands (as parts II and III show) is a process that continues in the present, yet these chapters examine how the bush was initially produced, physically and socially, by new experiences of confrontation. I begin by presenting\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nthe current layout of the places examined in the book and move on to analyze the historical forces that, from the Spanish colonial era to the early twentieth century, conﬁgured the Chaco and in particular Toba territory as places fractured by violence, subjugation, and resistance. After analyzing current memories of the ﬁrst migrations to the sugar plantations and the clashes with the Argentinean army, I examine how the foundation of the Anglican mission created a refuge from state terror but also a place subjected to a new type of discipline. Present-day memories, I argue, illustrate that missionization triggered a politicized spatiality that conﬁgured the bush and the mission in tension with each other and also in contrast with the plantations. Part II, ‘‘Bones in the Cane Fields,’’ takes the reader to the foot of the Andes and in particular to San Martín del Tabacal. I ﬁrst analyze the history of this plantation and the memories of the ethnic hierarchies and power relations that regulated Toba labor until mechanization put an end to their migrations in the late 1960s. Then I examine the death, disease, and terror many Toba project onto the cane ﬁelds, epitomized in devils and cannibals, and the simultaneous memories of money and commodities that turned San Martín del Tabacal into an alluring yet ultimately alienating place of wealth.The following two chapters focus on the ﬁelds of contention produced on the plantation, ﬁrst, through the evening dances that deﬁned this place in opposition to the mission, and second, through the forms of resistance that, even though challenging exploitation, ultimately reinforced people’s estrangement at the cane ﬁelds. In Part III, ‘‘Foraging until the End of the World,’’ I analyze how the memories presented in the previous two parts coalesce in the cultural and political geography of the bush. First, I examine how the health, resilience, local knowledge, poverty, and noncommodiﬁed abundance most Toba associate with the bush are produced in tension with the memory of the disease, estrangement, and wealth projected onto the sugar plantations. I also examine these features in conjunction with the legacy of Anglican missionization and the action of the bush devils, as they are deﬁned in contrast with the plantation devils. Second, I explore how recent labor migrations to farms and cattle ranches have aﬀected the social conﬁguration of the bush and how, in turn, work in these places is haunted by the memory of San Martín del Tabacal. I then analyze, intertwined with these practices and memories, the way in which people living in poverty have reproduced the collective use of the bush through struggles and negotia-\n\n12 Introduction\n\ntions with settlers, stage agencies, and their own leaders, a process that in the 1990s was creating new fractures in the local landscape. As part of my ﬁnal articulation of disparate geographies, the last chapter examines how the bush is also made in relation to lands that, located across the Pilcomayo marshes, evoke the memory of landscapes of freedom.\n\n1 Landmarks of Memory No space ever vanishes utterly, leaving no trace. —Henri Lefebvre, The Production of Space\n\nWhen I lived among the Toba, people conjured in their narratives, ﬁrst, the tangible places they experienced on a regular basis: their hamlets, the bush, the marshes, and the nearby village of Pozo de Maza. They also referred to places located farther away but regularly intertwined with their practices: the lands across the marshes, the town of Ingeniero Juárez (60 kilometers to the southwest), and the farms in Salta where many men and women migrate for work (over 300 kilometers away). Yet this mapping was permanently enmeshed in the memory of sites that have disappeared from their direct experience: to the west, the sugar plantations and in particular San Martín del Tabacal, and within their local geography the places that have been physically erased by history: the grasslands, the Pilcomayo River, and the Anglican mission. All these places, past and present, are tightly interwoven in local practices through memory. When Henri Lefebvre (1991:164) wrote that no space vanishes without leaving traces, he was thinking more about physical marks than about traces left in memory. In this chapter, I explore how both dimensions intersect: that is, ﬁrst, how the current layout of places such as the bush, the marshlands, or the farms are marked by the spatial sediment left on them by past geographies and, second, how these marks foster memories of landscape transformations. I examine these processes with the aim of showing the deep historicity of these places, exposing the history behind their current conﬁguration, and undermining their deceptive appearance of ﬁxity, sharing Hugh Raﬄes’s point: ‘‘It is the impression of stasis that beguiles. They may look secure, but landscapes are always in motion, always in process’’ (2002:34). I map these landscapes in motion by focusing on how their current layout has been transformed by labor and social relations, for, as Lefebvre argues, ‘‘social relations of production have a social existence to the extent that\n\n16 Landmarks of Memory\n\nthey have a spatial existence; they project themselves into a space, becoming inscribed there, and in the process producing that space itself ’’ (1991:129). This chapter is structured as a journey that begins in the Chaco interior and ends at the foot of the ﬁrst Andean ranges in San Martín del Tabacal. Since I concentrate on the major changes that aﬀected each place in the twentieth century, I temporarily leave aside the relations that produced these places in tension with each other. Those relationships are the object of the rest of the book, where I examine these locales in detail, dismember them, and then rearticulate them in their multiple interconnections. The villages are our starting point.\n\nThe Hamlets When entering a Toba village, usually arriving by bicycle from another village, I often felt it was hard to tell where the bush ended and the village outskirts began. I would ﬁrst see a rancho (adobe dwelling) partially hidden by vegetation, then another one equally obscured by trees and bushes, and the trail would gradually lead me to a clearing occupied by more visible and irregularly distributed clusters of adobes. In the late 1990s the Toba lived in twelve hamlets that congregated one, two, or more exogamous webs of extended families distributed in matrilocal households.1 Most villages comprised less than 100 people but one held about 600. In the largest villages, households are scattered around an adobe church, a dispensary, a primary school, and a building (usually used for storage) of the Instituto de Comunidades Aborígenes (ica), the provincial agency of indigenous aﬀairs. Reﬂecting the incipient class diﬀerentiation recently created by public-sector employment, brick houses with corrugated iron roofs, where leaders and state employees live, usually occupy the village core and the straw and adobe ranchos of those who lack a stable income are scattered around them. In casual conversations, many people point out that a few decades earlier those villages did not exist. Even though in the past people roamed those lands through hunting and gathering expeditions, they had their hamlets ten to twenty kilometers farther north, along the banks of the Pilcomayo River. Large ﬂoods produced this displacement early in 1975 by destroying those villages and forcing people to move to their current location. Many remember that the old villages by the river bore no marks\n\nLandmarks of Memory 17\n\nMap 2. Toba villages in the mid-1990s\n\nof government agencies: state schools, dispensaries, or ica buildings did not exist and people lived in relatively egalitarian places where everybody, even leaders, dwelled in ranchos. This conﬁguration was tightly connected with other places washed away by the ﬂoods: the Anglican mission station and Sombrero Negro, a Criollo village two kilometers upstream. Sombrero Negro was the main site of state presence in the area. Yet as part of the legacy of the violence I examine in chapter 3, the Anglican station immersed most Toba within a sphere of missionary inﬂuence that partially excluded state intervention. In 1996 Omar, a man in his late ﬁfties, remembered the diﬀerences between Sombrero Negro and the old mission: ‘‘In Sombrero Negro there was a store, a gendarmería post [military border police], a police post. There was also a school, a government school. But Toba kids didn’t go there. They didn’t go. They always went to the mission school. They didn’t know the state school. They didn’t know it. But now it seems no kid knows the mission school.’’ Omar shed light on the spatial diﬀerentiation marked in those days by missionary presence. Memories like this also deﬁne current villages, immersed within the\n\n18 Landmarks of Memory\n\n2. In a Toba village. Photo by author.\n\nsphere of inﬂuence of state agencies, by their contrast with the patterns that shaped local practices until the mid-1970s. The recent salience of trabajo (work) is another factor marking differences between current and past villages. Under the category ‘‘work,’’ people include agriculture, herding, craftsmanship, seasonal wage labor, and most prominently public-sector employment. People deﬁne trabajo in opposition to marisca, which refers to hunting, ﬁshing, and gathering of wild fruits and honey, to the point that most see ‘‘foraging’’ and ‘‘work’’ as mutually exclusive practices. Highly valued as a source of commodities, trabajo implies for most Toba a responsibility, regularity, and discipline relatively absent in marisca. This distinction is grounded in their experience of labor migration and has spatial dimensions equally informed by memory. People remember that in their old hamlets on the river everybody lived oﬀ marisca and that ‘‘work’’—especially jobs in state agencies—emerged as a deﬁning feature of their villages only in the late 1980s. The consolidation of villages as places of trabajo involves, ﬁrst, domestic practices conducted by women. Handicraft production—wool tapestry and handbags made of chaguar ﬁber (Bromelia hieronymi)—is the most visible female ‘‘work’’ within the household. Even though crafts have become meager and irregular sources of income, this practice is an important marker of female identity, to the point that women and men alike refer to it as ‘‘women’s work.’’ Women are also in charge of herding sheep and goats in the hamlets and their immediate surroundings. The soil ero-\n\nLandmarks of Memory 19\n\n3. ‘‘Women’s work.’’ Photo by author.\n\nsion caused by goats, which leave a barren soil devoid of grass and shrubs, is one of the villages’ distinctive spatial marks. For men, jobs granted by state agencies are the most highly valued type of trabajo. These jobs have turned the largest villages into places increasingly fractured by social hierarchies, which are spearheaded by elected representatives in the Pozo de Maza municipality and delegates to the ica and (less prominently) skilled public-sector employees such as teaching assistants, nurses, and midwives. These jobs are turning these households into an indigenous petite-bourgeoisie with distinctive interests and, in a few cases, entrepreneurial spirit. Some leaders have invested in hundreds of goats and sheep and, most important, cattle, a particularly controversial commodity because it is the symbol of settler identity. As a recent expression of this diﬀerentiation, some leaders have begun hiring relatives or settlers to look after their animals. This means that these leaders are creating a class cleavage not only through their jobs but also through the investment of their salaries in petty commodity production. Most Toba read the strains created by this diﬀerentiation through the language of reciprocity, for they see wealth accumulation as an infringement of the sharing values that deﬁne them as Aborígenes, a marker of identity that merges (as we shall see) ethnicity with conditions of poverty. Criticism of well-oﬀ leaders for their ‘‘stinginess’’ is often accompanied by memories of an egalitarian past near the river, when it was unthinkable that a leader owned cattle. Ordinary people often challenge this diﬀeren-\n\n20 Landmarks of Memory\n\ntiation by putting pressure on their leaders to redistribute part of their resources through patterns of generalized reciprocity (Gordillo 1994; see also Lee 1979, 1988, 2003). Thus, many submit their leaders’ behavior to permanent scrutiny and pay regular ‘‘visits’’ to their households to demand foodstuﬀs. This social pressure aﬀects the spatial conﬁguration of villages, turning better-oﬀ households into public places in which ordinary people partially contain the tendency to produce a more individualized and self-enclosed space.These forms of contention have spatial implications of a diﬀerent sort. Even though they are contested places, villages are the site of the leaders’ and public-sector employees’ power and resources. People living in poverty base their livelihood elsewhere, at a place they actively defend as a collectively owned space.\n\nThe Bush I left the village on a borrowed bicycle early in the morning, heading to a hamlet located ten kilometers away, where several men were waiting for me to begin a several-day hunting expedition. The bicycle ﬁrst took me to the narrow trail that starts winding down through the relatively open bush of the village surroundings. The ground was relatively free of vegetation, except for the cacti and algarrobo trees that were all around me. After a few minutes, the bush became thicker and the trail carved a path through a mass of vegetation. A cow, roaming freely in the bush as cattle do in the region, saw me coming and moved languidly to one side of the path. The trail was now full of bumps, many of them the product of footprints left by cattle on hardened mud. After navigating for twenty minutes through that extension of thick bush, I reached la picada, a perfectly straight trail opened for oil exploration in the 1980s by the then state-owned, now privatized, oil company ypf (Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales). Five to six meters wide and able to accommodate a pickup truck, la picada looks like a giant cut made in the heart of the bush, extending with exasperating precision toward its dissolution on the horizon. As I entered la picada and headed north toward the marshes, I felt immersed in a world primarily deﬁned by three colors: the whitish dust of the trail, the blue of the morning sky, and that presence in dark tones of green that engulfed everything on the sides: the bush. The trails that cut through the region and the encounters with cattle are permanent reminders that the Toba are not the only actors making\n\nLandmarks of Memory 21\n\nuse of the bush and that this place is deeply marked by the presence of Criollo settlers and state agencies. Toba memories often contrast this spatial conﬁguration with the times when those lands were grasslands, nónaGa or campo, where only Aborígenes lived.Those were the open landscapes roamed by the yagaikipí, the ancient ones (los antiguos), as most Toba call their non-Christian ancestors in contrast to themselves, the new ones (dalaGaikpí).2 In 1996, Enrique, a man in his ﬁfties, was remembering the times of the ancient ones and told me, pointing to the vegetation that began a few meters from his household: ‘‘This isn’t like it was before. All this is dense bush now. But they say that before, there was no bush. . . . Before, there were no cows, there were no Criollos, there were no roads. And all this was open country.There was thick bush only at the edge of the grasslands. If you wanted to eat ostrich [Rhea americana], you chased them galloping on horseback with boleadoras [throwing balls].’’ Like many other Toba, Enrique was deﬁning the savannas of yesteryear by the absence of some of the markers that characterize the bush today: cattle, Criollos, and roads. And he remembered the nónaGa by evoking a practice deﬁned by movement and velocity, ostrich hunting on horseback, which is currently impossible to re-create in the bush. In the early twentieth century, grasslands covered both banks of the Pilcomayo River and stretched, intertwined with patches of bush, ﬁfteen to twenty kilometers into the hinterland. The bush dominated the landscape only in the Chaco interior.3 According to old people, those grasslands had been created by a dóle aló (big ﬁre), a mythical ﬁre that forced the ﬁrst ancient ones to hide underground. At the turn of the century, the grasslands were indeed the product of ﬁres set by the Toba and other indigenous groups to send messages, hunt, and as a weapon in warfare. Those ﬁres reproduced wide areas of open country, halted the growth of trees, and pushed forests into the hinterland (Morello and Saravia Toledo 1959:18; Morello 1970:37). The ﬁrst Bolivian and Argentinean explorers in the area marveled at the sight of those grasslands, which they saw as full of potential for cattle herding. Looking for pastures for their cattle, the ﬁrst Criollo settlers arrived on the Pilcomayo in 1902 and founded Colonia Buenaventura, 150 kilometers upstream from Toba territory. The Criollo colonization brought decisive landscape transformations. Suﬀering land encroachment and military reprisals, indigenous groups stopped making ﬁres. Cattle depleted the grass and began eating wild fruits and spreading tree seeds (through their feces) over wide territories. As a result, in a few years trees\n\n22 Landmarks of Memory\n\n4. Grasslands near the Pilcomayo in the late 1920s. Photo by Enrique Palavecino. Archives of the Museo Etnográﬁco Juan Ambrosetti, Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, Universidad de Buenos Aires.\n\nwere growing in areas formerly covered with prairies (Morello and Saravia Toledo 1959:20, 76–77; Morello 1970:34, 39). By the 1920s, the social changes brought by the settlers and by the military defeat of indigenous groups were having profound spatial implications; they were creating a radically diﬀerent landscape of monte and overgrazed strips of sandy soil.4 As the Criollos moved with their cattle downstream, this landscape transformation reached Toba territory. By 1939, grasslands had mostly disappeared from their lands and had become part of a collective memory.That year the wife of an Anglican missionary living among the Toba wrote: ‘‘The old Indians remember when all this area was subtropical grassland without trees—they could see for miles across the ﬂat land’’ (D. Tebboth 1989:68). In the 1990s, memories of the grasslands regularly informed Toba experiences of the bush, yet in contradictory ways. During my ﬁrst ﬁeldwork\n\nLandmarks of Memory 23\n\nin 1987, I was surprised to hear many people refer to the landscape that surrounded us as nónaGa, ‘‘open country,’’ when all I could see around us was a pretty convincing bush.5 I soon learned why people used that term. The bush surrounding that particular village was not as thick as in other areas and this relative openness (hard to decipher for urban eyes) indicated that decades earlier those areas had indeed been open country. I also noticed that people often reserved the term ‘‘bush’’ (viáq, monte) to refer to the thickest and oldest sections of forest, which form a dense ensemble of trees and weeds and are also called ‘‘large bush,’’ viáq ádaik (see ﬁgures 5 and 6). It took me a while to train my gaze and be able to distinguish the viáq ádaik from the more open sections of bush and to understand how the distinction between the two is soaked in memory. Because of the burden of old geographies in their memory, many Toba use the term ‘‘bush’’ and ‘‘open country’’ as echoes that, reverberating from the past, project themselves onto the present as if unaware that the present is a diﬀerent place. And this particular fusion of language, space, and memory stresses the continuity of past landscapes into the present. Yet the memory of grasslands shapes perceptions of the bush in altogether diﬀerent ways, conﬁrming how dependent meanings are on the context in which they are produced. When people want to emphasize the profound transformations that have aﬀected their lands, they emphasize the contrast between the open spaces of the past and the forested landscape of the present. With this historical contrast in mind, people talk about ‘‘the bush’’ in a way that includes the relatively open areas of forest within it. This time, the bush represents for them the current conﬁguration of their lands as a whole and ‘‘open country’’ symbolizes a historically speciﬁc geography that has now disappeared. Segundo, a man in his late seventies, had referred several times to the landscape surrounding his village as nónaGa, open country. Yet he was once remembering the ancient ones and told me, while looking around us: ‘‘Before, all this used to be open country. Now, it’s dense bush.’’ Segundo’s memory of the spatial fracture that separates the past from the present turned those open sections of forest into ‘‘bush.’’ He reminded me, and himself, that as the yagaikipí’s was a world of grasslands, the world of the new ones is one dominated by the bush. These spatialized memories are anchored in the practices and social relations of production through which most Toba regularly re-create the bush as a collective place, a re-creation that in the 1990s had legal recognition through the granting of a collective land title to all villages. These\n\n24 Landmarks of Memory\n\n(top) 5. In the bush sections many Toba call ‘‘open country.’’ (above) 6. Hunting in the ‘‘big bush.’’ Photos by author.\n\nrelations of production are based on the unrestrained access to land and its resources and the immersion of foodstuﬀs within circuits of generalized reciprocity. In this regard, marisca is associated with values of sharing and autonomy from the cash economy that stand in tension with those of trabajo, the practice that symbolizes the villages. Marisca is also a crucial symbol of aboriginality for, unlike trabajo, it is what most readily distinguishes Aborígenes and settlers.6 This aboriginality is also a class marker and many people consider marisca as the practice that sets poor and welloﬀ Toba apart. Unlike trabajo, secluded within the villages and the ﬁelds and sub-\n\nLandmarks of Memory 25\n\njected to control by merchants and state institutions, marisca is deﬁned by widespread mobility in the bush and the marshes, ﬂexibility in the treks’ direction and length, and relative autonomy from direct relations of domination.7 Men conduct brief trips near the village surroundings to capture small animals—rabbit (Sylvilagus brasiliensis paraguarensis), viscacha (a rodent, Lagostomus maximus), and charata birds (Ortalis carnicollis)— and roam farther into the thickest sections of bush if they want to hunt large mammals like corzuela (Mazama, deer) or peccary (Tayassu tajacu and Catagonus wagneri). Some men set out with an axe with the explicit aim of searching for honey, but many hunters simply gather it any time they come across a beehive. Women, for their part, enter the relatively open sections of bush to gather algarroba pods and also enter the viáq ádaik to gather chaguar plants for their handicrafts. Marisca depends heavily on the changing availability of natural resources throughout the year, and this spatialized temporality is another feature that sets it apart from trabajo. Wild fruits, honey, and animals are particularly plentiful in the wet season, between November and May, when they cover between 50 and 70 percent of household consumption (Gordillo 1995b:119). In May, resources in the bush are scarce and large shoals migrate upstream the Pilcomayo, marking the peak of the ﬁshing season, when the marshes become the primary source of food. The decline of ﬁsh abundance by late July signals the beginning of the months of scarcity, August and September, when marisca’s productivity decreases substantially. Even though this seasonality constrains the frequency, direction, and duration of foraging trips, marisca is not simply an ‘‘ecological adaptation’’ to the Chaco environment; rather, it is a practice primarily guided by conditions of poverty, market constraints, and spatiopolitical strategies (as several chapters will show). Men living in poverty set out to the bush to hunt and gather honey on a regular basis, even during nakaviagá (winter), but women’s forays into the bush have a more markedly seasonal character. The ripening of chañar (Gourliea decorticans) in October and especially algarroba (Prosopis alba and, to a lesser degree, nigra) in November signal the beginning of ‘‘the fruit season,’’ when women enter the bush in groups and cover large areas. They also gather mistol (of the smaller variety, Zizyphus mistol), bola verde (Capparis speciosa), sachasandia (Capparis salicifolia), and poroto de monte (Capparis retusa), some of which are available until the end of summer.8 Through these gathering trips women produce most of the foodstuﬀs people consume at this time of the year.9\n\n26 Landmarks of Memory\n\nMarisca makes many people move between the bush and the villages and this oscillation contributes to deﬁning both places in contrast with each other. Yet these connections also make the bush a potent presence in the hamlets. The memory of San Martín del Tabacal and the more recent perception of the contrast between their lands and towns such as Ingeniero Juárez and Formosa accentuate this semantic expansion of the bush into the villages. These memories and experiences make many people deﬁne ‘‘the bush’’ as home: a place of their own that includes not only thick and open forests but also their hamlets. When people in the villages say, as they often do, ‘‘here in the bush’’ they produce this meaning that implicitly delimits their lands as a whole in relation to other geographies. This is why for many Toba ‘‘the bush’’ often overshadows the Pilcomayo marshlands, another place that evokes memories of vanished landscapes.\n\nThe Marshlands When I arrived at the hamlet I was heading to, my companions were sitting around a ﬁre ready to leave. A boy diligently put my bicycle inside a rancho and I sat down for a few minutes to drink from a warm mate gourd somebody put in my hands. My break did not last long. A few minutes later, as I was still soaked in sweat from the ride, we all set out on foot to the marshes. We marched on a narrow bush trail and each of my six companions carried a rolled blanket, a small bag, and a shotgun or riﬂe. As we got closer to the marshes, the vegetation gradually opened and we soon left the dry, hardened hinterland soil behind and began walking on grass. Bright shades of green, which contrasted with the darker, dustier colors of the hinterland bush, surrounded us. As the space gradually opened in front of us, we were immersed in a landscape I always found startling, beautiful, and uncanny. Standing twenty to thirty meters apart and towering over an intensely green veneer of grass and shrubs, countless dead trees extended in all directions. Many of them were partially covered in lush shrouds of weeds and stood over shallow water. As we proceeded toward our boats, dozens of birds ﬂew here and there, ﬁlling the air with lively sounds. That ghostly landscape of shallow water and dead trees was testimony of the bush that had once covered the area, drowned by the ﬂoods that, in this region, brought an end to the Pilcomayo River. In the early 1970s the Pilcomayo ﬂowed further north and those marshlands did not exist. According to old people, the river was originally dug up\n\nLandmarks of Memory 27\n\n7. The Pilcomayo marshes. Photo by author.\n\nby a huge water snake called lék.10 Ever since that moment, the Pilcomayo was for generations deeply embedded in Toba livelihood and identity and, for that reason, its disappearance had a profound impact on them. In the mid-1990s people over thirty remembered the river with deep nostalgia and gave me detailed accounts of those days and the landmarks that deﬁned them. The river, I learned, was at points over 100 meters wide and was delimited, as ﬁgure 8 shows, by steep banks and sandy beaches. More important, the river was within their immediate reach: men, women, and children took baths several times a day and men set out to ﬁsh day and night. Like the other groups of the Pilcomayo, men usually ﬁshed in teams using two types of nets, uanaganaGát (a depth net) and heélaGae (a surface net), either in groups or individually.11 Figure 8, a photo taken in the Pilcomayo in the 1930s, shows a ﬁsherman with a uanaganaGát net, used in this case on the margins of the river. People remember that the high productivity of ﬁshing allowed them to store large quantities of fat and roasted and sundried ﬁsh to be consumed in August and September. References to ﬁsh abundance permanently permeate memories of the river. In 1996 Pablo, a man in his early seventies, told me about the days prior to the ﬂooding: ‘‘It was nicer, much nicer. People didn’t suﬀer. We always ate ﬁsh. . . . When there was a river, all sorts of ﬁsh came out.’’ Because of the enormous amount of sediment carried from the Andes and the low gradient of the Chaco plains, the Pilcomayo River has always\n\n28 Landmarks of Memory\n\n8. The Pilcomayo River in the 1930s: Man ﬁshing with net. Archives of the Museo Etnográﬁco Juan Ambrosetti, Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, Universidad de Buenos Aires\n\nbeen prone to changing its course and forming marshes. Yet in the 1970s this process was probably accentuated by the deforestation of the Andean slopes and the increase in the pace of sedimentation. Early in 1975, the ﬁrst wave of annual ﬂoods saturated the riverbed with sediment and, in this area, the river literally turned into a mud bloc. When the last wave of ﬂoods arrived in March, the water overﬂowed the riverbanks and inundated a wide area. The ﬂood destroyed the villages, Misión El Toba, and Sombrero Negro and brought dramatic changes in the landscape. With the riverbed ﬁlled up with sediment, water formed new and wide networks of streams and swamps ﬁve to ten kilometers south of the old course. After losing everything, over a thousand people had to relocate in new hamlets built on the southern margins of the marshes. Twenty years later, the old villages, the mission, and the Pilcomayo riverbed were covered with thick layers of sediment, several meters deep, and located in areas where no Toba lived. Only some hunters who trek across the marshes are able to recognize the places once so central in their everyday life. Segundo once went on a marisca trip to what used to be the mission and remembered how enlame (sediment) and thick bush had covered it all: ‘‘It seems that it all changed. The house of the missionary was totally covered. . . . Right after the ﬂoods, you could only see the corrugated iron above the enlame. Now, all that’s thick bush. I once went there and got out with my pants torn to pieces. It’s really thick. It’s not like before.’’ Segundo’s account sheds light on the profound spatial changes\n\nLandmarks of Memory 29\n\n9. Fishing in the marshes. A settler’s cow observes from the distance. Photo by author.\n\nbrought on by the ﬂoods. After a few years, the bush took over the places that had once been carved out as socializing spaces by Toba, settlers, and missionaries. As a further and compelling sign of this landscape transformation, the bush imposed its presence over what remained of the river. In the years following the ﬂoods, most Toba had to adapt their livelihood to the new geography created by the marshes, over ﬁve kilometers wide in the summer and early fall. Men had to alter their ﬁshing techniques, for ﬁsh spread over a wide network of shallow streams and swamps that do not allow for the use of nets and the organization of ﬁshing teams. Fishing became an individual practice, less productive than in the past and conducted primarily with an iron-headed cane (chiquena) and hooks and nylon lines.12 Changes in the landscape also reformulated senses of place, for the river’s disappearance increased the semantic, spatial, and practical importance of the bush. The marshland is not as close to Toba everyday experience as the river was. Because of the expansion of the marshes during the annual ﬂooding, most people live at least a few kilometers away from them and drink fresh water from drilled wells. Owing to this distance, their ﬁshing expeditions require long walks or a bicycle ride. Yet the marshlands, like the river, are a central reference point and the most important source of food. Even though men ﬁsh all year, many households establish temporary camps in the marshes to take advantage of the relative abundance of ﬁsh between May and July.13 Many men also\n\n30 Landmarks of Memory\n\n10. Flood horticulture on the marshes’ edges. Photo by author.\n\nﬁsh while preparing small ﬁelds usually no bigger than one or two hectares, for ﬂood horticulture.14 Given the low rainfall (less than 600 millimeters a year), this farming technique, which many Toba have practiced for generations, is the most productive in the area.15 These ﬁelds have turned the marshes’ shores into places characterized by marks of trabajo, where men and women plant watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris), pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima), anco (Cucurbita moschata), melon (Cucumis melo), and corn (Zea mays). Most households cultivate for self-consumption, but a few households are developing a commercial agriculture and reinvesting in tools, seeds, and small amounts of pesticides. This capitalization is consolidating their status as petty commodity producers and remaking local spaces, for the most active farmers have formed separate hamlets near the marshes to take advantage of ﬂoods and also be farther away from the intense demand by people from other villages. Yet despite these marks of trabajo scattered along their shores, the marshes are primarily deﬁned by marisca and the patterns of mobility and seasonality examined above. In addition to ﬁsh, this place provides most Toba with an abundant source of beehives, wildlife, and wild fruits. As a result, marisca expeditions permanently cover both the bush and the marshes, and the annual expansion and retreat of water creates a wide transition zone between the two that is an important source of foodstuﬀs.16 When I accompanied Toba men into the marshes, laheGó (‘‘the other side’’) was a frequent topic of conversation. For years I was intrigued by\n\nLandmarks of Memory 31\n\nthe myriad stories and memories people told about that invisible place hidden behind that large mass of water and vegetation. In June 2000, with the six hunters with whom I had reached the marshes’ edge, I was ﬁnally about to set foot on laheGó.\n\nThe Other Side It took us about two hours to cross the marshes, slowly navigating the intricate network of streams, vegetation, and swamps. We left the two boats on one of the last strips of shallow water, loaded our gear, and began walking toward the hinterland. After a few hundred meters, the grass gave way to dry, hardened soil.We passed by the rancho of a Criollo and for a couple of hours followed a trail surrounded by thick bush yet wide enough to expose us to the intense Chaco sun. After walking through a dusty area eroded by cattle we reached the dry creek that was to be our camp for the next four days. While we were putting plastic sheeting and blankets on the ground, Roberto told me that the old Pilcomayo riverbed, and hence the border with Paraguay, was only a few kilometers to the northeast. Someone turned on a radio. When the time was announced, one of the men joked about the spatial liminality of those lands, caught in between the marshes and the international border: ‘‘It’s three o’clock in Argentina. I wonder what time is it in laheGó.’’ For most Toba, the other side (la banda in Spanish) is a contradictory place located in a no-man’s-land of sorts.The lands extending between the marshes and the old river are Argentinean territory but are relatively isolated from Argentinean villages, and the Criollos who live there maintain regular links with Paraguayan estancias (cattle ranches).17 More important, those lands were the Toba’s home and therefore memories of a past prior to the ﬂooding are memories of those same places. Yet the ﬂoods’ impact and the fact that no Toba inhabit those lands anymore turned laheGó into an unfamiliar landscape, where it is often hard to recognize old sites. Some women go to the other side in October and November, when the marshlands are shallow, to gather fruits from the chañar trees that abound in the area. Some men, for their part, trek through those lands to work in the estancias in Paraguay. Yet the abundance of wildlife, fostered by the fact that very few people live there, is the primary force that attracts hunters to laheGó. After resting at the camp for a couple of hours, we went to see the place\n\n32 Landmarks of Memory\n\n11. Grasslands on ‘‘the other side.’’ Photo by author.\n\nmy companions had told me so much about: the grasslands. In the villages, people referred to them often and evoked images of wide campos that were ‘‘like before,’’ full of animals hard to see on their lands. As we walked there I did not know what to expect. I almost anticipated being disappointed, for I found it hard to believe that grasslands of any signiﬁcant size could still exist in that part of the Chaco. As we left the last sections of bush behind, my curiosity became awe. There they were: grasslands as far as the eye could see, stretching for kilometers toward a minute line on the horizon that marked a distant bush strip. After a few minutes, my companions spotted the ﬁrst ostriches in the distance. They were invisible to me. As I relished that impossible landscape, I tried to imagine how those lands might have looked a hundred years earlier, with bands of ancient ones trekking a world free of trees, Criollos, cattle, and anthropologists. The ﬁrst times I accompanied foragers into the marshes, many years earlier, I often noticed large columns of smoke emerging from the other side. My companions would comment that Criollos were setting ﬁres to clear the ground for cattle. Only much later I made a connection between those ﬁres, which prior to the early twentieth century produced the grasslands, and the reemergence of extensions of open country on the other side. Paradoxically, the descendants of the settlers responsible for the grasslands’ demise were recreating in laheGó, the ancient ones’ home, a landscape reminiscent of the Toba’s past. Yet whereas laheGó, north of their villages, evokes a past of autonomy deﬁned by foraging, the south connects them to the places that led to the\n\nLandmarks of Memory 33\n\nancient ones’ demise. Those are also the places where the Toba learned the meaning of ‘‘work.’’\n\nPaths to Distant Places Pozo de Maza, a village of about 500 Wichí and Criollos located about twenty-ﬁve kilometers away from the marshes, is the southern limit of the area most Toba recognize as their familiar locality. Traversed by the dirt road that connects the area with Ingeniero Juárez, the village comprises a handful of brick houses, a couple of boliches (general stores), a school, the quarters of gendarmería, and the site of the municipality with jurisdiction over the Toba villages. A few hundred meters away, out of sight from the main road, is the Wichí hamlet. La comuna, as the municipality is locally known, is the main source of public-sector jobs in the Toba villages and the center of local relations of patronage, party factionalism, and political conﬂicts. When talking about the upheavals in Pozo de Maza, some men like to point out that at the time of the ancient ones this site was a hunting ground of the mañiGodipí, ‘‘the ostriches,’’ the Toba band that reached farther into the hinterland. This memory asserts that the place was originally Toba territory, implicitly contesting the current Wichí and Criollo presence in the area. Adults also remember that for decades Pozo de Maza was simply a Criollo post lost in the hinterland, where hundreds of Toba men, women, and children stopped for one night in their long walk to the railway line, on their way to the sugar plantations. In those days the current road, built in 1984, did not exist. Angélica, a woman in her late ﬁfties, told me while pointing to the road ﬁfty meters away from us: ‘‘In the past, this was just a trail. There was no road, just a trail for horses. When they came from the San Martín plantation to take the people out, people went on foot to Maza. If there was no truck there, we went on foot to Juárez.’’ Like many others, many Toba remember the past conﬁguration of the hinterland as the by-product of their experience of labor migration, which turned those vast extensions of bush into a place of passage to the ingenio (sugar plantation). Founded in 1931, Ingeniero Juárez is the political, administrative, and economic hub of western Formosa and the Toba’s most important regional point of reference. The town expanded in the mid-1980s following the discovery of oil in the region, and in a few years its population reached about 11,000, comprising mostly Criollos but also a large Wichí contin-\n\n34 Landmarks of Memory\n\ngent. A group of Toba displaced by the 1975 ﬂoods set up a Barrio Toba (a neighborhood of about 250 people) in the outskirts and this presence increased the connections between the hamlets and Ingeniero Juárez. In the 1990s some people went to town relatively often: to visit relatives, do paperwork at state agencies, take relatives to the hospital, or sell handicrafts or produce. This experience accentuated the contrast between ‘‘the bush’’ and ‘‘Juárez,’’ not only for the Toba. Every time I arrived in town after a long stay in the Toba villages I experienced culture shock, and the Criollos who would see me stepping out of a pickup truck, usually covered in dust, would marvel at my boldness for living ‘‘in the bush.’’ Yet many Toba remember that decades ago Ingeniero Juárez was a small train station equally lost, as it were, ‘‘in the bush.’’ Mariano described what the town looked like in those years: ‘‘Juárez was very small. There were no people, very few people. Only three merchants lived there.The merchants had little houses made of wood planks. No bricks. Nothing. Just wood planks.’’ I asked him whether the town had streets. ‘‘Just one street. But it was very short. Everything was bush.’’ Memories like this underscore the geographical transformations created by the town’s growth and how these changes reversed the predominance of the bush still apparent in most northwest Formosa. The railway connecting Formosa to Embarcación, inaugurated shortly after Ingeniero Juárez was founded, took several generations of Toba to the sugar plantations of Salta and Jujuy. Once a symbol of the forces of civilization and progress cutting through the wilderness, in the late twentieth century the railroad was almost in ruins, the result of widespread budget cuts.18 In 1965 a dirt road was built parallel to the railway. After Tabacal mechanized the harvest, farms located in eastern Formosa and Salta began recruiting Toba men and women directly from their villages by truck by way of this road. In the 1990s this road was the main means by which many Toba left ‘‘the bush’’ to work for wages in distant places. One of their most important destinations was tadéwo, the west.\n\nThe Bean Farms The contractor in charge of the farm agreed to take me to see the Toba working for him. He seemed ﬂattered by my interest in his work but also intrigued by the fact that I knew his harvesters. We were in Embarcación, a town located on the easternmost foothills of the Andes, at the end of\n\nLandmarks of Memory 35\n\n12. Toba camp at a bean farm north of Embarcación. Photo by author.\n\nthe old railway line coming from Ingeniero Juárez. The contractor was working for one of the farms that since the 1970s had transformed the landscape of the region, turning thousands of hectares of forests into bean ﬁelds.19 The following morning, before dawn, I met him again and we both got on his pickup truck to head to the ﬁnca (farm). While driving he explained the details of the harvest and repeatedly praised the Toba for being ‘‘hardworking’’ and ‘‘clean,’’ as opposed to the Wichí, whom he deﬁned as ‘‘useless for work.’’ It was daylight when we got oﬀ the main road and, a few minutes later, entered the ﬁnca. We parked near a rudimentary store where workers buy food and other staples. When I stepped out of the truck, some Toba men who were coming to talk with the contractor recognized me and smiled in surprise. In a few seconds, I was shaking dozens of hands. Some were people I had seen only a few times but others were friends. I was as excited as I was shocked to see them in a place so diﬀerent from the Chaco interior. I was ﬁnally in tadéwo, at one of the ﬁncas I had heard so much about. We were chatting near a forest strip, where they had erected their camps with poles, corrugated iron, and pieces of nylon sheeting. A few hundred meters to the west, across the road that connects Embarcación to the Bolivian border, I could see the foggy, densely forested hills that mark the end of the Chaco plains. About eighty Toba were working in that farm, looking for the trabajo\n\n36 Landmarks of Memory\n\nunavailable in their villages and the Chaco interior. They came from three diﬀerent hamlets and had formed several work teams, usually families or groups of friends. Most were single men and women or young couples with children. Yet a few were in their forties and ﬁfties and remembered that, when they were teenagers, thick forests covered that area. In those days Embarcación was not unfamiliar to them. Hundreds of Toba used to get oﬀ the train there on their way to San Martín del Tabacal, which is located only twenty kilometers to the west next to the town of Orán, at the gates of the San Francisco River Valley. In the 1990s, for many men and women working in that farm, the memory of Tabacal was, as we shall see, a spectral presence.\n\nSan Martín del Tabacal I arrived in Orán at night and the following morning the air was damp and foggy. A compact mass of mist and clouds crawled down the slopes of the hills west of the cane ﬁelds, which extended in all directions and surrounded Orán like a green sea. It was June of 1996, almost three decades after the Toba had worked in San Martín del Tabacal for the last time. The plantation had undergone major changes since those days. Once a thriving symbol of the power of the Salta sugar barons, San Martín del Tabacal had been for years in serious debt to public and private banks. When I was there, an American company was about to purchase 60 percent of the shares. The Patrón Costas family, the original owner of the ingenio, retained 4 percent of the shares.20 Thirty years earlier, the plantation had begun a mechanization scheme that ended the labor migrations which, every year for over seven decades, had taken several generations of Toba from the Pilcomayo to the San Francisco River Valley and back. Years after the mechanization, while working near Embarcación, some Toba went to the ingenio to visit the place where they had spent such a signiﬁcant portion of their lives. Some were struck by the changes that had erased the marks of their presence. Horacio, a man in his late ﬁfties, remembered: ‘‘I don’t know what year it was. I went to the San Martín plantation to see. I was watching. It’s not like before. It changed. Now, machinery does the work. The places where we used to live aren’t there anymore. Only cane ﬁelds. The lote [lot] where we lived is an orange grove now. . . . In the past, you could never see the dam at Vado Hondo. But now you can see it from the distance. That used to be bush.’’ Horacio was contrasting\n\nLandmarks of Memory 37\n\nthe ingenio’s new layout with his memories of their ﬁrst trips to Tabacal, when jungle covered most of the land, the plantation was small, and some ﬁelds were planted with tobacco. The ingenio, after all, was named after the tabacales (tobacco ﬁelds) of the area. I took the local bus to the town of Tabacal, the plantation headquarters and site of the sugar reﬁnery, a few kilometers from Orán. While I looked out the windows, I kept wondering about the mountains so many Toba had told me about. People depicted them as an imposing presence overlooking the cane ﬁelds from the west. To my frustration, all I was able to see that hazy morning were hills, obscured by clouds, that did not look particularly impressive. I got oﬀ near a large portico formed by four arches, where one could read engraved in stone ‘‘Patrón Costas’’ and, on another arch, ‘‘año 1920.’’ The architecture struck me as the remnant of another epoch resisting the ﬂow of time, the symbol of the vanity of an earlier era of bourgeois power. The town of Tabacal, built in a re-created Spanish colonial style, was behind. A few hundred meters away, the factory chimneys pumped huge columns of white smoke. As I walked below the arches and headed toward the factory, passing near trucks loaded with sugar cane, I felt I was going back in time to those days when hundreds of Toba men, women and children got oﬀ the train, stood near those arches, and waited to be distributed in their lotes (the plantation’s units of residence). A few weeks later, back in the Toba villages, I told several men about my visit to Tabacal and all of them compared my impressions with their memories of that same place. Tomás told me, remembering the arches: ‘‘They left the people there. People got oﬀ the train there, in front of the factory. . . . When we got oﬀ, we rested for one night. The following morning, they distributed the people. . . . The factory boss arrived. He ordered the capitán [indigenous leader] to take people to a lote, and other people to another lote, and other people to another lote. I remember, when I was young.’’ Yet that day of June 1996, with the harvest in full swing, there were few workers in sight: just trucks waiting to unload tons of sugar cane. The reﬁnery was more impressive than I had imagined: a dark, enormous building with several thick, tall chimneys saturating the air with smoke and industrial noise. Many Toba had told me they feared and avoided that place, especially because of the dangers that lurked in its basement. I stayed for a couple hours, observing the imposing, almost living machinery and taking notes. Later that morning, the clouds began dispersing. I had been in Tabacal for about three hours and decided to head\n\n38 Landmarks of Memory\n\n(top) 13. Sugar reﬁnery, San Martín del Tabacal. (above) 14. The mountains, San Martín del Tabacal. Photos by author.\n\nback to the road and explore the cane ﬁelds. As I walked away from the reﬁnery, I noticed that the sky was sunnier and I looked once again to the west. I remember shivering at the towering mountains that dominated a now-clear valley. Images cascaded into my mind: the scores of devils that came down from those ridges to spread disease among the Toba, the fabulous treasures hidden somewhere in those heights, the cannibal men who descended in search of human ﬂesh. I always believed, and still do, that the old notion of Verstehen (understanding) is based on the naïve assump-\n\nLandmarks of Memory 39\n\ntion that a supposed intersubjective communion can overcome diﬀerent cultural and class experiences. But that morning, as I looked at the mountains and at the factory pouring its breath into the sky, I could not help feeling that somehow I was closer to understanding what many Toba had been telling me for a long time.\n\n2 Heaven and Hell This is the face of the province called Chaco! which the Spanish soldiers look upon as a theatre of misery, and the savages as their Palestine and Elysium.—Martin Dobrizhoﬀer, An Account of the Abipones\n\nIn the 1670s the site where San Martín del Tabacal now stands was indigenous territory covered with jungle.The ruins of Santiago del Guadalcázar, founded in 1624 and abandoned eight years later, were the only remains of a brief attempt by the Spanish to control the region. Yet this was still a disputed territory. The juncture of the San Francisco and Bermejo rivers was an entry point into the Chaco for Spanish military expeditions coming from the highlands. In 1673, as they descended from the same mountains that centuries later would evoke terror among the Toba, Spanish troops from Jujuy could see the Chaco in front of them like a vast, dark ocean rolling toward the east. Those men formed one of the parties sent simultaneously from diﬀerent fronts by the governor of the Tucumán province, Angel de Peredo, against the indios inﬁeles (inﬁdel Indians) of the Chaco. The column led by Governor Peredo had departed from Esteco, on the Salado River, and approached the Bermejo from the south. On reaching this river, Peredo dispatched groups of soldiers ‘‘in order to take the inﬁdels out of the dens of thick forests, where they hide with their families under the protection of wild animals’’ (Lozano 1989:217).1 When the Jujuy troops arrived in the same area, various indigenous groups had managed to ﬂee across the river. The synchronized movement of military parties, however, cut oﬀ several escape routes. When the campaign was over, the Spanish had been able to capture 1,800 men, women, and children. The captives were taken to Esteco, where Governor Peredo distributed them as serfs among his troops. Father Pedro Lozano wrote about this event: ‘‘And all the soldiers and corporals were so anxious to have Indians serving them, that they judged that all the prisoners were not enough to award their merits’’ (1989:229).\n\nHeaven and Hell 41\n\n8=>FJ>IDH\n\nC\n\nIVE R\n\nL\n\nÓ 2\n\n4ARIJA\n\n4ROPICOF #APRICORN\n\nN CIS CO\n\n%STECO) n"
