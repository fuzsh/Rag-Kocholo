        "text": "The arrival of the Mennonites and militaries in the Chaco created new, parallel and conflicting lifeworlds. To the newcomers, the Chaco was a ‘wild’ and ultimately hostile place that was waiting to be subdued and ‘civilised’ with the tools of modernity. To its various indigenous inhabitants, the Chaco was not ‘wild’, but, despite its many challenges, a place of life and nurture. These conflicts were, however, not simply ideological. While the Mennonites came with ploughs, the armies marched in with rifles and machine guns, each of which simultaneously remade the Chaco in distinct and contrasting ways. The aim of this chapter is to examine the different worlds made and perceived by the Mennonites and the soldiers in the Chaco, and how these differed from indigenous worlds. In doing so, I engage directly with the notion of industrialised war as an Anthropocene hyperobject (Morton 2013) in and through which multiple worlds and futures are both made and unmade.\n\nI first assess the Mennonites’ efforts to adjust to the climatic and geographical conditions of their adopted homeland, and to turn the Chaco bush into arable farmland. I then focus on the soldiers’ experience of the Chaco. Aymara, Quechua and Guaraní mestizo perceptions of the bush will be explored, before the study moves on to discuss the soldiers’ struggle to not only survive a modern war but also stay alive in the Chaco bush. Food, and especially water, were scarce in the arid scrubland and the soldiers often depended on indigenous interlocutors’ knowledge of the landscape to survive. I examine what sources were available to them and the impact that hunger and thirst had on the soldiers’ bodies and minds. I then turn to the sensorial dimensions that thirst, the experience of mechanised war and the environment of the Chaco presented to the soldiers, and conclude with how the latter managed to deal with their reconfigured realities.\n\nDwelling place, promised land and green hell?\n\nAlthough the origins and meaning of the term remain disputed, it has been suggested that ‘Chaco’ derives from the Quechua chacu, which refers to the region’s indigenous populations and can be loosely translated as ‘hunting ground’. Where local indigenous groups perceived the landscape as a productive environment, Chaco denoted an infierno verde or ‘green hell’ to the newly arrived Mennonites and the encroaching armies (Bray 1981, 171; Friesen 1997, 548). As mentioned earlier, this discrepancy in the different worlds of the Chaco was not simply a case of ‘modern meets traditional’ as the boundaries of these worlds had already started to blur long before the war, resulting in a curious mix of Christian and indigenous cosmologies as well as sometimes contradictory racial ideologies. Whereas some Paraguayan veterans, for example, attributed Bolivian soldiers’ supposed lethargy and fearfulness to their indigenous heritage, they saw their own Guaraní roots as the reason for their self-proclaimed superior warrior nature (Macias c. 1940; Benítez 1976). Despite both the belligerent states and the Mennonites being considered ‘western’, their views were often fundamentally different, as reflected, for instance, in their stance on armed conflict. Nevertheless, they showed a similar colonial attitude towards the Chaco landscape, which they considered a ‘wilderness’ that needed to be subdued and domesticated by humans. This was, however, no easy task.\n\nThe Mennonites’ view on nature was founded on the idea that it was God’s will for humans to control nature. In short, God created earth for humans to use (Stahl 2007, 111–12). Deeply religious, the colonists believed that like the Israelites before them, they had been led into a ‘promised land’. The Mennonites saw it as their Christian duty to transform the dusty bush into a fertile ‘garden in the wilderness’ (Stoesz and Stackley 1999, 1) with permanent settlements and fenced pastures, reinforcing the clear divide between culture and nature. During his excursions into the heart of the thorny scrubland, Fred Engen, the Norwegian-born Chaco pioneer and Mennonite sympathiser, felt that the Chaco was in need of the ‘skilful and industrious man’ as:\n\nthere is not a place on earth except Paraguay that offers such attractions with so few obstacles to overcome. Beautiful nature in the Chaco seems to say to those endowed with vision and foresight: ‘I am yours; come and exploit me; take all that you are capable of taking, as I am inexhaustible in resources.’ Riches lie dormant awaiting men of energy, thrift, and skill to turn the immense, wild, uncultured prairies and meadows into a paradise. There are all resources for the creation of wealth, coupled with the most wonderful climate which can be found anywhere on the globe. The sacred silence in the Chaco inspires one to high and noble aims, and the solitude and the atmosphere purifies the soul, filling it with wonderful dreams of a life sublime and beautiful. I do not wish to convey that paradise is already there; it has to be made from the material which lies dormant awaiting men with brains and muscle (quoted in White 1927, 441).\n\nYet upon their arrival in the Chaco, the Mennonites were filled with despair. Where were all those inexhaustible resources and the wonderful climate that Engen had promised them? In the absence of any agricultural guidelines for what was perceived to be an ‘uncultivated’ region, the farmers were faced with major challenges and years of trial and error. Crops such as potato, corn and fruit that had thrived on Russian and Canadian soils did not survive in the heat of the Chaco. Like their produce, the Mennonites suffered from the devastating month-long droughts, in which pozos indios – wells dug and used by indigenous people – were often the only water sources available. Floods caused by the ensuing rainy season and swarms of grasshoppers repeatedly destroyed those things that did grow, most notably cotton and peanuts. The Chaco wildlife also posed a threat to people and livestock while termites were eating away at the wooden boards of the farmsteads (Abercrombie 1933, 1175).\n\nOver the years, the Mennonites had to learn how to survive in the Chaco bush. This would not have been possible without the help of local indigenous groups, especially the Enlhet and later the Ayoreo, who showed them the use of wood, how and when to plant local seeds and, most importantly, how and where to dig for potable water. Often they had to dig between two and ten metres under the constant threat of collapsing walls before reaching water (Stahl 2007, 311). The Chaco bush also taught the Mennonites how to survive in it. The colonisers quickly realised that adding an overhanging roof to their houses not only provided them protection from the Chaco elements but also allowed them to collect rainwater (Stoesz and Stackley 1999, 183–4). Devout and hardworking, the Mennonites persisted and eventually managed what no-one in eastern Paraguay thought possible: by the start of the Chaco War they had turned the ‘wild’ Chaco into the cultivated piece of patria thousands of men were now rushing to defend.\n\nMuch like the Mennonites, both armies struggled to survive in the Chaco. Leaving their homes in the Andean highlands, Bolivian soldiers often had to walk for weeks before reaching the Chaco front. ‘Through walking’, Tilley notes, ‘landscapes are woven into life, and lives are woven into the landscape, in a process that is continuous and never-ending’ (Tilley 1994, 29–30). The Aymara and Quechua recruits, however, felt disconnected from the Chaco landscape (Querejazu Calvo 1975, 131). Used to the rugged vastness of the Andes, they felt homesick and confined in the Chaco ‘prison made of plants’ (Sarmiento 1978, 76), as one soldier recounts:\n\nIn this eternally flat landscape, each time I come out of the scrubland and I see a bit of the horizon, my glance searches instinctively and longingly the silhouette of our mountains. How do we Andean inhabitants contain within ourselves the mountain! More than the culinary ambrosia, the warmth of the home or the affection of the fiancée, my nostalgia is today devoted to the mountains and ravines. It is a subtle and terrestrial longing. What would I give to set foot into the rocky slopes again or to rest my spirit and eyes on a horizon drawn with the beloved solemn and paternal humps! (Querejazu Calvo 1975, 133).\n\nThe Aymara and Quechua recruits’ lifeworlds were rooted in an Andean cosmology that has a profound respect for the almighty Pachamama (Mother Earth) and the powerful Apus – mountain deities that form part of her. Pachamama gives life to everything but also controls the malevolent elements such as thunder, earthquakes and floods. Apus act as protectors of humans and animals but can also cause gusting winds (Bolin 2002, 32). In order to appease these forces, people aspire to a ‘spiritual dialogue among humans, animals, and the powers of nature’ that does not ‘separate the natural from the spiritual environment’ but considers all things – animate and inanimate – as living entities (Bolin 2002, 32). As a result, the indigenous people of the Altiplano, like the indigenous people of the Chaco, inhabit worlds in which humans, animals, nature and objects share an entangled existence free from the nature–culture divide. Such attachments are embodied in specific landscapes, and the Chaco must have presented considerable challenges in which aspects of the environment were both similar to but also uncannily different from the Andes from which the majority of the Bolivian soldiers hailed.\n\nThese lifeworlds were significantly disrupted by the arrival of the Spanish and the introduction of a capitalist tin and silver mining industry that forced Aymara and Quechua men to exploit their sacred mountains, most famously Cerro Rico in Potosí (see Nash 1979). This resulted in a curious fusion of Christian and Andean beliefs and practices inside the dark and claustrophobic tunnels which, like entrails, were winding their way deep inside the mountains’ interior (see Miller 2001). By the outbreak of the Chaco War the mining identity was deeply engrained in Andean culture. This did not go unnoticed by the Paraguayans, who observed that ‘The Aymara soldier prefers to fight buried – the subterranean and the caves are his elements’ (Macias c. 1940, 63). Narrating his experience inside a tunnel dug by Bolivian sappers in Fortín Nanawa, Augusto Céspedes notes that:\n\nA tiny hole brought in light and air from outside! It was below the scrubland. Advancing a little, I encountered the complete vision of a naked man, shiny with sweat, crouched, perforating the bottom of the underground passage. He was the ghost worker, the sombre miner from the mountains who brought his subterranean skills to the tragic and tropical lands of the Chaco (Céspedes 1975, 67–8).\n\nHowever, the Chaco earth the Bolivian miner-sapper was now penetrating was not the Pachamama he was familiar with. It was an alien place, an ‘earth without sense’, that subjected him to a harsh climate and terrain ‘in whose thorns he left the threads of his Andean soul’ (Céspedes 1973, 163, 88).\n\nOn the Paraguayan side, the ‘soldier-agriculturist[s]’ (Chesterton 2013, 114) felt a close relationship with the arable red earth they had been cultivating for generations before the war in eastern Paraguay. This fondness for their native lands was however not naturally transferred to the dusty and arid plains of the Chaco, as the latter evoked fear of its supposedly aggressive indigenous inhabitants, exotic wildlife and impenetrable foliage (Bustamante Rodríguez 1987, 36). Aware of the fact that war with Bolivia was imminent in the 1920s, the Paraguayan government sent out scientists to study the region and its indigenous groups with the ultimate goal of nationalising the Chaco and instilling a sense of patriotism towards it in the general population (Chesterton 2013, 60–78). Although the Chaco might have looked like a self-evident part of the patria on maps, it felt unfamiliar to the soldiers in the field. Indeed, it stood in stark contrast to the lush vegetation of eastern Paraguay with its abundance of fresh water sources. Albeit used to high temperatures, the soldiers struggled with the oppressive heat and the lack of water in the inhospitable Chaco bush. Faced with unfamiliar flora and fauna, they quickly realised that the Bolivians did not pose the only threat, as one Paraguayan soldier recalls: ‘The resistance of the desert presented itself as almost insurmountable. Victory had to be achieved against the enemy and against nature’ (Bustamante Rodríguez 1987, 83).\n\nThe Paraguayans were, however, not completely defenceless against the Chaco ‘wilderness’. Due to survey missions conducted by General Belaieff for the military in the decade preceding the war, the army was aware – at least on paper – of some of the challenges posed by the region’s climate and topography (see Belaieff 1934). Unlike their Bolivian counterparts, Paraguayan foot soldiers were equipped with a weapon that in the first instance might seem inappropriate in a mechanised war but soon established itself as the key tool for survival (besides the water canteen) in the Chaco bush. ‘Sharp, curved like a cutlass, penetrating like a dagger, strong like a hand saw’, the machete cuts through thicket and even wood. Prior to the war it had been primarily used in agricultural activities such as ploughing the earth and cutting weeds that threatened to cover it (Benítez 1976, 56–7). In the Chaco it became the Paraguayan weapon of choice to try to beat the thorny bush into submission.\n\nAccording to Benítez the machete was useless in the hands of the Bolivians as they spent their lives below the earth’s surface working in tin mines instead of cultivating the soils above them. The machete was thus considered a component of Paraguayan identity – ‘a terrible extension of their skilled and confident arms with nerves made of steel’ (Bustamante Rodríguez 1987, 20). Most importantly, it was seen as ‘an instrument of civilisation’ (Benítez 1976, 56) and progress, used by the modern and advanced Guaraní mestizos in their quest to dominate nature. Benítez elaborates that in the hands of Paraguayans the machete is ‘an advanced cavalry of printing and electricity. It is the sharp extension of the arm. In this strong and fertile land, a farmer without a machete is a knight with a wooden sword’ (Benítez 1976, 57). In the Chaco, the machete did not only enable Paraguayan soldiers to cut and move freely through foliage. In fact, with every stroke an area was cleared in the bush and transformed into a ‘plot of his nationality’ (Benítez 1976, 56). Similar to the harsh alpine fighting experience during the First World War where ‘the mountains made the man’ (Keller 2009, 256), the Chaco turned simple farmhands and miners into national heroes, whilst they themselves remade the Chaco. This continuous interplay between human and non-human entities is an example of the ways in which such interactions create a reciprocal relationship in which ‘we touch the things and the things simultaneously touch us’ (Tilley 2006, 61). The soldiers and the Chaco made, unmade and remade each other in this process.\n\nContrarily to the Mennonites and militaries – who were convinced that the Chaco bush had to be exploited and controlled through the stroke of a plough or machete – the populations native to the region believed that appropriate ‘social’ relations with nature guaranteed access to natural resources and, ultimately, survival. Similar to pre-contact Andean indigenous populations, they adhered to ‘the mutual dependence of all that exists’ (Blaser 2009a, 13; see also Descola 2005; Ingold 1996; Viveiros de Castro 1998; Blaser 2009b, 2010). The Nivaclé and Ayoreo, for example, thought that everything – human, animal, nature or object – has a double, which Wilmar Stahl (2007) argues can be compared to a shadow that the physical shell casts. As a result, all things animate and inanimate have both a physical and a spiritual dimension. According to Stahl, indigenous people appease the spiritual energy of a plant, animal or rock (which can transform into a malevolent force that would bring bad luck or illness) by maintaining strict and attentive relations with the environment. This familiarity with the Chaco bush allows people an intimate knowledge of and access to its ‘physical shell’. Nature is thus considered a close and ‘generous relative’ with whom humans are intertwined in a symbiotic relationship of respect (Stahl 2007, 79–81, 97). Contrary to the practical and possessive views expressed by the Mennonite and military scouts such as Belaieff, indigenous understandings of the Chaco landscape are infused with stories that express actions and sentiments of gratitude and affection for the generosity of its non-human agents (Escobar 2007, 143). These acts of storying and ‘dwelling’ (Ingold 2000) are themselves world-making and generative.\n\nIn the eyes of the Mennonites and soldiers, the Chaco was a ‘colourless hell’ where everything merges into a grey-brownish green against which only the bright red of blood stands out (Céspedes 1975, 162). In contrast, to the Ishir indigenous people, red represents not only the colour of blood but also the striking beauty of the caraguatá plant (Aechmea distichantha), which is associated with women’s genitalia (Escobar 2007, 93–4). The spiky leaves of the plant were furthermore used in the weaving of baskets. Yet, to the Mennonites and soldiers the caraguatá was a painful nuisance, whose sharp thorns ripped both cloth and skin. Similarly, while the sun plays a significant role in Ishir mythology as a transmitter of human life skills such as hunting (Escobar 2007, 227), it was a source of great pain for the soldiers, who felt it like ‘a mask of fire’ on their face (Céspedes 1973, 123).\n\nWhen different ontologies collide, dominant worlds tend to enforce themselves upon others, making and remaking parallel lifeworlds in the process. Woodward argues that militarised landscapes (and the same could be said for ‘agriculturalised’ landscapes) are never detached landscapes as they always impose themselves onto already existing ones (Woodward 2004, 7). In the Chaco, this is perhaps best exemplified in people’s relationship with trees and wood. The palo santo or ‘holy wood’ tree (Bulnesia sarmientoi), for example, was of major importance to local indigenous communities. Valued for its many medicinal properties, it was also used in burial purification rites due to its intense smell and luminosity when set on fire (Escobar 2007, 287; Barbrooke Grubb 2011, 168). During the war, the same fragrance must have also filled the trenches and bunkers lined with its freshly cut timber, mixing with the stench of human faeces and decomposing bodies (see Saunders 2014, 24).\n\nWriting of Amazonian Indians, Philippe Descola has noted that indigenous people tend to treat ‘discontinuities between humans, animals and plants as mere differences of degrees and not of kind’ (Descola 2005, 22). The concept that humans and all things animate and inanimate are interlinked in the shaping of a single undivided world is also shared by indigenous peoples in the Chaco. To many of the different local indigenous groups, trees are of major cosmological importance. In some instances, they represent the ‘cosmic tree’ that is linked to the axis mundi (Escobar 2007, 80). In his ethnographic work on the Tomaraho (an Ishir sub-group), Ticio Escobar explains that:\n\nThe tree is an archetype of nature and its link to other dimensions. The image is enriched by the phallic connotations of a firm trunk that is deeply rooted in the earth, ascends vertically and opens its branches to the sky; it is laden with associations of a natural source that renovates itself cyclically, that produces food and flowers, shade and wood, and that shelters birds and beasts in its leaves. This exemplary model is linked to the concept of the pillar that sustains and retains the sky, the stairway that leads to its heights, and the channel that communicates with subterranean worlds (Escobar 2007, 80).\n\nThe devastating impact of industrial war, however, forcefully changes and reconfigures both the physical and discursive constitutions of arboreal landscapes. Before the First World War, for example, European ideas about trees and forests were embedded within a visual artistic tradition that favoured romanticised depictions of an idyllic and innocent natural world. However, when the mechanical forces of war were unleashed upon the fields and forests of Europe and beyond, trees were reduced to shell-splintered trunks and ‘natural and social worlds were forged anew, and sensibilities realigned’ (Saunders 2014, 22). In the Chaco, the use of a local tree from the Bombacaceae family generally called samu’û in Guaraní and palo borracho (drunken tree) or árbol botella (bottle tree) in Spanish serves as a poignant example for the destruction and reshaping of an indigenous landscape and lifeworld. This invokes the question of ontological politics (see e.g. De la Cadena and Blaser 2018) and the antagonisms that arise when conflicting worlding practices come into contact with the same object, in this case the tree.\n\nNamed after its shape, the bottle tree is typical of the Chaco and plays an important role in indigenous culture. Considered the ‘primal tree, from which the fish sprouted’ in Ishir culture, the fall or death of the samu’û represents the completion of the cycle (Escobar 2007, 80) and people are thus ‘as much bound up in the life of the tree as is the tree in the lives of the people’ (Ingold 2000, 204). Known as the ‘green cistern’ as rain accumulated inside naturally formed holes in its trunk without evaporating, the bottle tree was also valued by many indigenous groups for its practical function as a form of natural water storage (Klassen 2009, 232). The holes in the trunk further served as storage places for food and clay water jugs (Klassen 2009, 229). In times of extreme food scarcity, indigenous people would cook and eat the tree’s semi-ripe seeds (Stahl 2007, 315), and along the Paraguay River men would hollow out the soft inside of the trunk and use the remaining shell as a canoe (Fast 2004, 49).\n\nIn the early years of colonisation, the Mennonites recall hollowing out bottle tree trunks to use as coffins during the cholera epidemic in 1930 (Stoesz and Stackley 1999, 47). Whereas hollowed-out trunks were turned into cattle troughs during the rainy season, their soft interior was fed to starving cattle during times of drought (Heinz Wiebe, Mennonite guide from Colonia Neuland, pers. comm). During the Chaco War the soldiers also took advantage of the tree’s malleable properties by hollowing out its trunk and using it as a prison for punished soldiers (Boschmann 2012, 126) and as a sniper’s hideout. Similar to soldiers hiding inside artificial trees for camouflage during the First World War, the man positioned inside the bottle tree became ‘literally as well as figuratively embodied within the trunk’ (Saunders 2014, 24; Coutin 2012, 102). Here, modernity forcefully subverted and reconfigured indigenous moral and natural ontologies as the Ishir symbol of life had suddenly been turned into a bearer of death and a physical marker of war in the landscape.\n\nThe ‘white death’\n\nHunger and food\n\nFor the Chaco’s indigenous inhabitants, knowing the bush was key to survival. By contrast, Bolivian and – to a lesser extent – Paraguayan soldiers were not always familiar with the natural food sources that the Chaco had to offer. Although it might seem impossible to those who have not grown up there, the Chaco thicket provides everything humans need to survive, including wild fruits and vegetables, such as wild cucumber, prickly pear and wild palm heart; wild legumes, such as beans and roots; and a multitude of animals and insects safe for consumption. However, as a number of the Chaco’s wild food sources can be poisonous when not carefully prepared, an intimate knowledge of the food’s properties and people’s potential reactions to it was essential (see Stahl 2007, 303–24).\n\nParaguayan veteran Anibal Zotti recalls that by December the snails, which had been a welcome and necessary source of vitamins and protein for him and his comrades, became scarce. Famished, the men devoured anything they could get their hands on – fresh leather, roots, insects, the malleable flesh of the bottle tree and toxic fruits – ignoring any potential health hazards (Zotti 1974, 120–1). Hunger thus became the driving force behind people’s behaviour (see Butterly and Shepherd 2010, 158). Bustamante Rodríguez remembers greedily sucking ripe ñangapiry guazú, the colourful fruit of a small tree of the Myrtaceae family, and not caring about the formation of blisters on the tongue and lips that they caused (Bustamante Rodríguez 1987, 126).\n\nFood was scarce in the Chaco, especially during battles that could leave soldiers sitting inside their fortines and trenches, cut off from supply lines for weeks on end. Desperate for something to eat, the men had to slaughter their mules – and thus consume their means of transport – in order to maintain physical strength themselves (Farcau 1996, 55, 180–1). The Chaco heat and the lack of water to cook the meat meant, however, that it was soon covered with maggots. Starving, the men had no choice but to eat the rotten meat, even when infested by botflies that had previously feasted on the bodies of their dead comrades (Zotti 1974, 46). Hunger also pushed soldiers to trade their personal equipment, such as overshoes, for a handful of rice (Zotti 1974, 153). Although trading military supplies constituted a serious offence and demanded punishment, being subjected to unbearable hunger was overwhelming.\n\nSoldiers who had personal links to nurses used empty fuel canisters to smuggle food such as sugar, yerba (herbal tea), tinned beef and milk to the front. As the meagre rations given to the men were never enough to survive on, these illegal goods were received with great joy and generally shared with hungry comrades (Zotti 1974, 90). Another rare treat were the big galletas or biscuits baked by the nearby Mennonite communities. Although stale, dirty and covered in moss from humidity, they were a delight to the soldiers and gave them temporary relief from hunger (Zotti 1974, 121). When he lost his tin plate, an empty food can was often the only thing a Bolivian soldier owned to carry food and water (Céspedes 1975, 160). Those who still had their equipment spread out their trembling arms in the hope of receiving a spoonful of pitiful rations. One soldier recounts that food was so scarce that they could literally count every single grain of rice on their tin plate (Zotti 1974, 150). The soldiers’ empty tin plates and the suffering they represented must have left a lasting impression on the men, who would occasionally decorate their own piece of equipment to pass on as a souvenir at the end of the war.\n\nThe lack of food and the soldiers’ general unfamiliarity with the Chaco thus had a momentous impact on the troops. Countless men succumbed to diseases such as dysentery and scurvy, which prevented them from chewing the little food they had (Zotti 1974, 120). Others suffered from diarrhoea and fevers. Yet with hunger a soldier lost not only his physical health but also his sensibility and spirituality, and slowly his soul, to the point that ‘misery gradually consumed soldiers’ individuality’ (Zotti 1974, 121).\n\nThirst and water\n\nThirst is a powerful sensation. First felt as a mere discomfort in the throat, it keeps niggling away until satiated. If thirst is left unquenched, however, dehydration soon manifests itself as an all-encompassing presence that inevitably consumes the body and the mind, wreaking havoc on the senses. In conflict, the physical weakness and feelings of disorientation produced by the lack of water are intensified by the horrors of modern warfare. During the Chaco War, thirst weaved itself into the sensorial experience of war amidst thorny cacti and hissing bullets. Firmly in the grip of dehydration, thousands of men lost their lives to this invisible killer, which, without shedding a drop of blood, nonetheless created an often gruesome and manifold entanglement of people, nature and material culture.\n\nThirst was without a doubt the most tormenting sensation a soldier had to endure before he eventually succumbed to the ‘white death’ (Roa Bastos 2005, 194). Indeed, as Paraguayan writer and Chaco War veteran Augusto Roa Bastos once poetically wrote: ‘Thirst, white death, walks arm in arm with the other one, the red one, in dusty hoods’ (Roa Bastos 2005, 182–3). During the First World War, ‘white death’ signified death by avalanche or freezing to death on the alpine front, as opposed to a ‘red death’ by enemy artillery fire (Keller 2009, 265). With regard to the Chaco War, it is generally believed that more soldiers died a ‘white death’ (Céspedes 1973, 14) and of disease than from bloody bullet shots. Amongst the thorny plants, venomous snakes and disease-carrying mosquitoes of the Chaco, Paraguayan veteran Silvio Macias poignantly states that ‘The tragedy of the Chaco is the spectre of thirst’ (Macias c. 1940, 1). Similar to the situation in the Italian Alps, the enemy rifle or grenade did not pose the biggest and most immediate threat to a soldier stationed in the Chaco. Instead, it was the bush itself, or perhaps more appropriately the men’s unfamiliarity with the Chaco landscape and its resources, that represented the greatest challenge to survival. Yet whereas the men stationed in the European mountains had to endure freezing temperatures and snowstorms at extremely high altitudes (Keller 2009; see also Balbi 2009), the Paraguayan and Bolivian troops had to face the hostile thicket and heat of the Chaco, where ‘the juice of cacti replaces water’ (Zook 1960, 23).\n\nAccustomed to the colder conditions of the Altiplano, the Bolivian soldiers especially struggled in the desert-like temperatures and were plagued by an all-encompassing thirst. The agonising memory of thirst and its physical and psychological consequences continued to haunt many soldiers after the war and was repeatedly detailed in personal accounts of the conflict. Céspedes writes that:\n\nThirst, with its bitter incandescence, chapped our lips and swelled our tongues. No one sweated anymore. A demon licking my throat took control over my pharynx, and I felt my blood like gum. My mouth seemed strange, like a cardboard box covered in dried paint, something unusual and unpleasant. The act of swallowing was repeated mechanically, hitting my throat a painful blow at every instant (Céspedes 1973, 139).\n\nThirst is a primary biological function and as without water we would not be able to survive, drinking is a fundamental human need (De Garine 2001, 1). During the course of a day, a healthy adult loses about 1.5 litres of water as urine and faeces, and around 800 ml evaporates through the skin and the simple act of breathing. In order to compensate for this loss, humans need to drink and eat food with high water content. A person’s age, general health and exposure to high temperatures can greatly influence their body’s water loss (Vargas 2001, 14). During the Chaco War, the general scarcity of food and water coupled with high temperatures and lack of shade resulted in thirst being a constant companion. In addition, illnesses such as malaria and typhus caused ravaging fever, diarrhoea, vomiting and excessive sweating. Consequently, the men’s already ravaged bodies were losing even more water and, without the intake of sufficient liquid to recuperate the loss, slowly started to shut down.\n\nHowever, thirst and dehydration do not only affect the human body. The effects of water deprivation seize a person’s mind and control their entire existence. Men would leave their positions upon spotting an indigenous well in no man’s land and run towards it under enemy fire. Roa Bastos writes that piles of bodies would surround a well, with some of them having submerged their faces in the water ‘where they have remained drinking in all eternity’. Others, he continues, ‘are hugging each other closely, quietly and satisfied. Khaki and olive-green uniforms mixed up, joined together by coagulated crimson, sewn into an indestructible brotherhood’ (Roa Bastos 2005, 184). Sarmiento adds that men frequently went delirious with thirst, which caused ‘a feverish anxiety and the nerves created obsessive manifestations’ (Sarmiento 1978, 72).\n\nAs the human body is incapable of storing water, carrying a caramayola (also caramañola and caramagnola) or canteen was crucial in order to avoid dehydration. The water shortage also meant that the caramayola was often a soldier’s only life source and his most important piece of equipment. The canteen thus quickly became a símbolo vital, a symbol of life (Sarmiento 1978, 70). The aluminium container was always kept close to the body as the loss or theft of it could result in the death of its owner. As caramayolas were rarely filled up to the brim, every drop was precious and the container was not to be left out of sight. Besides their canteen, Paraguayan soldiers also carried hollowed-out bull horns or aluminium jugs for holding drinking water (Quesada with Jowett 2011, 7). On various occasions these jugs found alternative uses. After heavy downpours, for example, the clattering sound of jugs used to scoop out the accumulated rainwater that was a nuisance and brought colds to the already frozen stiff soldiers could be heard (Zotti 1974, 87). During times of rest, the smooth aluminium exterior of the caramayolas and mugs served as a surface for engravings and personal and artistic expression.\n\nFighting in a landscape where months pass without a single drop of rain and temperatures soar up to 50˚C, finding a potable water source is crucial. The number of lakes and indigenous and Mennonite wells was limited and often they did not carry enough water to sustain a whole battalion. Inside the fortified military posts the little water available was frequently contaminated by decaying corpses (Sarmiento 1978, 71). The scarcity of natural water sources and the armies’ general lack of local knowledge meant that most of the water for the troops had to be brought in from outside the Chaco. The isolated location of the Central Chaco, the lack of proper roads and the shortage of trucks turned the supply of water into one of the major challenges of the war. During times of drought, the Chaco’s earth consists of a fine dusty sand, which made the vehicles’ wheels spin under their heavy load. Traversing the Chaco during the rainy season was, however, an even greater challenge as many of the rudimentary roads became completely impassable, and the aguateros or water carriers got repeatedly stuck in the sand, which had now turned into a viscous sea of mud.\n\nDue to the precarious financial state of both Bolivia and Paraguay, only a small number of trucks were available for transport. Most of the time mules and oxen, as well as designated soldiers, carrying up to 30 caramayolas dangling from their body, acted as aguateros or water carriers. Aguateros lived in constant danger of being attacked and robbed by thirsty soldiers from both sides. On numerous occasions their vital cargo did not reach its final destination due to pillaging, bumpy roads or evaporation, leaving countless men fighting in the trenches without a drop of water (Roa Bastos 2005, 183). An anonymous source gives a heart-rending description of the tragic fate of the human water carrier:\n\nThe caramagnolas, hopeful anticipation of the thirsty, target of he who risks his life for a sip. And there marches the man with his thirty caramagnolas zigzagging, while the lead encloses his silhouette in a closing circle. He throws himself to the ground, crawls like a feline, seeks shelter behind immobile and naked tree trunks; he arrives or does not arrive, depending on his luck. When he arrives, he will have lost half of the caramagnolas perforated by bullets, riddled by the bursts of gunfire; or he never arrives, because when advancing with his precious load he is made to turn around with a gunshot to his forehead … THIRST. The aguatero almost always dies this way (Anonymous 1980).\n\nIt soon became clear that the armies could not solely rely on water being brought in from outside the Chaco. During his early military expeditions into the region, Belaieff had already realised that ‘the clue of the Chaco is in the hands of the Indians’ (quoted in Chesterton and Isaenko 2014, 632). In a pamphlet written for the Paraguayan military, he outlines local terrain, climatic and hydraulic conditions and notes what type of plants are indicative of potable water sources (Belaieff 1934, 25–8). Nonetheless, countless soldiers died of thirst because they did not know the local plants (Schuchard 2008, 175).\n\nAlthough it is scarce and often hidden out of direct sight, the centuries-old indigenous presence in the region was testament that potable water does exist in the Chaco. The water shortage, however, forced indigenous groups to lead a mostly nomadic and hunter-gatherer existence, which centred around permanent lakes during the dry season. When the militaries moved in and took control over those lakes, they forced indigenous communities out of their territories (Stahl 2007, 311). Both the Mennonite and military occupation of these water sources resulted in a change of living conditions for indigenous people (see Von Bremen 2008, 344–5). Often whole families had to move to faraway alien parts of the Chaco, reluctantly leaving behind a place with which they had shared a deep relationship over many generations (Gordillo 2004). In forcing such groups out of the Chaco, the Mennonites and militaries were also unknowingly expelling the very sources of knowledge that could make the landscape habitable. Indigenous people had learned many ways of finding water in this difficult environment. They knew that bottle trees store rainwater inside shafts in their trunk and that the precious liquid can be sucked out with a reed. They also knew that certain types of wild pineapple plants accumulate water between the leaves at the base and that the thick leaves of the prickly pear cactus also known as tuna (Opunita cactaceae) can be chewed for hydration (Stahl 2007, 311). They understood the bush and its natural resources; they knew what plants were poisonous, and which type of sand was hiding water underneath it (Chesterton and Isaenko 2014, 631–2). Although the soldiers drank drops of water accumulated on plant leaves (Sarmiento 1978, 76) and learned that sucking the moisture from the roots of plants such as the caraguatá and the bitter-tasting leaves of the gigantic prickly pear cactus (Bustamante Rodríguez 1987, 83), could appease their dry throats, they were often unaware of or could not identify other natural life-saving water sources in the bush.\n\nJohn Renshaw observes that in extreme droughts, entire indigenous groups are forced to survive on a tuber known locally as yvy’á (Jacaratia hassleriana), which – due to its high mineral content – causes stomach cramps if used for more than a couple of days (Renshaw 2002, 86). Local Mennonites assert that a person could die of thirst in the Chaco while unknowingly standing next to a natural water source (Heinz Wiebe, pers. comm.). The plant, which above ground reveals nothing but a fine leafy stem, hides an enormous turnip-shaped fruit 60–80 cm below the surface. The watery flesh can be chewed in little pieces or wrung into a container or straight into the mouth. Zotti (1974, 250–1) describes a fellow soldier carving a number of holes into the lid of an empty meat can, which he then used as a peeler to slowly grate thin slices of the tuber, while at the same time collecting its juice inside the can. This was a slow and unrewarding process as it took a whole hour to fill half the can with liquid. The remaining grated parts were turned into a type of starchy tortilla seasoned with grease and salt. Although this is mentioned in various memoirs as a water source that the Paraguayans could identify (see Zotti 1974, 37, 250–1; Sarmiento 1978, 760; Bustamante Rodríguez 1987, 83), one cannot help but wonder how many soldiers might have stamped on the little shrub, delirious with thirst, unaware of its buried treasure.\n\nDesperate for fluids, the soldiers would drink the water stored in the jackets of their water-cooled machine guns, which they then refilled with their own urine (Zotti 1974, 37; Céspedes 1975, 164). In many cases, however, even urine was too precious to be wasted and many a soldier – albeit reluctantly – filled his canteen with it (Céspedes 1973, 139; Sarmiento 1978, 73). In the Chaco, the myth of mechanised warfare as the ‘modernist super-artefact and the supreme signifier of universal progress and modernity’ (Buchli 2002, 4) was exposed as a perverted illusion that killed thousands of people without even pulling the trigger. Here, the ‘white death’ came to act as both a terrible manifestation of modernity gone wrong (González-Ruibal 2006a, 177) and a reflection of the absurdity of the Chaco War and industrial conflicts in general, as one anonymous source notes: ‘Water, sister of the Chaco, you who makes warriors beg, armed with all the weapons, they lack you, the most essential weapon, the indispensable one’ (Anonymous 1980).\n\nSensing the Chaco\n\n(Con)fusing the senses\n\nWar is a powerful multi-sensorial experience. In the context of the Chaco War, the excruciating effects of thirst on the human body and mind open up a uniquely Chacoan dimension of sensoriality amidst the horrors of industrial war within a landscape that was alien and thus full of new sensory impressions to most of the soldiers. The experience of armed conflict in the Chaco created an enmeshment of material realities and sensations that were often difficult to process and demanded new engagements with the landscapes and ‘sensescapes’ (Howes 2005c, 143–5) of the Chaco.\n\nIn his short story ‘El Pozo’ (The Well), which takes on the voice of an imaginary Bolivian official, Céspedes recounts the digging of a well, day after day, by a small detachment of Bolivian sappers in desperate need of water (Céspedes 1973, 17–36; see also Vera 2000, 26–8). Obsessed with finding the precious liquid, the soldiers keep digging for months – with thirst, silent yet omnipresent, always looming over them. The moist sensation of mud underneath the sappers’ feet awakens a flicker of hope, which is quickly crushed by more layers of dry earth, ‘Earth, earth, thick earth that tightens the lungs with the mute cohesion of asphyxiation’ (Céspedes 1973, 26). The well takes on a terrifying personality, torturing the men who continue their descent into the entrails of the planet (Céspedes 1973, 28). With every metre they become more wormlike and less human, and yet they keep ‘scratching the belly of the monster’ (Vera 2000, 27). Forty metres. The well keeps denying them water but opens up a new world away from the blood and cries of the battlefield. Inside the suffocating darkness of the well, the war does not exist. There is no sound but the banging of shovels and the men’s heavy breathing. The only thing that matters is finding water. Men faint, but thirst pushes them on. The lack of oxygen and their desperation make them hallucinate. After months of digging, the well remains dry. In the end, a group of thirsty Paraguayans attacks the detachment of sappers and after a short battle the dead are tossed into the hungry black hole in the ground. Instead of being a source of life, the well has turned into a grave, devouring men and hope alike.\n\nAbove ground, the immediacy of the horrors of war, thirst and the hostility of the bush further intensified the soldiers’ awareness of their surroundings. The habit of going barefoot, for example, opened up a strong sensorial dimension to the Chaco experience of the Paraguayan soldier. As Ingold notes, boots ‘imprison the foot, constricting its freedom of movement and blunting its sense of touch’ (Ingold 2004, 319). Walking over the hot Chaco surface which was cracking from the heat and lack of water, his feet covered in dust, the Paraguayan soldier was continuously exposed to ‘the thorns that do not respect leather, nor calico, injure our skin with every step and produce painful blisters’ (Bustamante Rodríguez 1987, 62). Less prosaically, perhaps, going barefoot might also have helped the men in their attempt to bond with the Chaco by physically creating a feeling of connectedness with the earth they were defending with their lives. As Ingold suggests, ‘it is surely through our feet, in contact with the ground that we are most fundamentally and continually “in touch” with our surroundings’ (Ingold 2011, 45).\n\nThis entanglement of humans and things – animate and inanimate, industrial and natural – is reflected in written accounts by veterans. Similar to the soldiers in the American Civil War (1861–5), who fought in and at times against an unfamiliar landscape and used ‘natural imagery to articulate their mental landscapes’ (Shively Meier 2010, 40), the Paraguayan and Bolivian soldiers frequently expressed their emotions through language referring to the Chaco’s flora and fauna, as well as its atmospheric conditions. At night, in the darkness of the trenches, the glow of cigarettes – a rare and savoured treat sent to the front from a faraway outside world – was likened to fireflies landing on soldiers’ mouths (Céspedes 1975, 114). Too thirsty to sleep, Zotti contemplated his surroundings, which cast human-like shadows in the semi-darkness of the Chaco night. Nature, just like humans, seemed to be struggling as ‘the erect foliage of the tuna cactus resembles arms, extended as if to plead with the star-filled sky for a little bit of water to appease the heat and thirst that reign during the day of the hot months’ (Zotti 1974, 122–3).\n\nDuring long and agonising marches under ‘the rain of sun pins that pierced through the foliage burned from the heat’ (Céspedes 1973, 138), the soldiers’ tongues became heavy and their vision blurred. As a result, their minds would frequently trick them into believing that they could hear the sound of running water or see the precious liquid shimmering in the shape of a lagoon or a small dirty puddle, but it generally revealed itself as a mirage in the landscape (Anonymous 1980). The bodies of men who had succumbed to thirst and dehydration were lining the dusty trails in the Chaco. The sight of dead comrades and gnarled enemy bodies had a strong effect on the survivors. The hollow cheeks, sunken eyes and open mouths that seemed to be desperately pleading for water were a constant and very real reminder to those who were passing that a similar fate would await them if they lost or emptied their water canteen.\n\nAfter days without a drop of liquid, every cell in the soldiers’ bodies was desperately craving water. Yet when it suddenly came in the form of a torrential rainfall, water often turned from a long-awaited saviour into a dreaded assassin. The emergence of large swamps and the flooding of trails made the terrain impassable, and the transport of much-needed medical supplies, food and military equipment was impossible. Like the fields of France and Belgium in the First World War, the grasslands of the Chaco were turned into a sea of mud, in which supply trucks and mules would sink (Farcau 1996, 102). Worse still, the trenches and battlefields became a deadly mix of mud, human body parts, metal splinters and diseases, inside which the soldiers and their equipment were literally drowning (see Das 2005, 39; Saunders and Cornish 2009, 5). Within the context of the First World War, Santanu Das tells us that mud’s ‘aggressive agency’ and ‘its leech-like suction on the skin’ blurred the categories of object and subject (Das 2005, 45). Mud thus merged both the physical and psychological into a constant threat of ‘dissolution into formless matter at a time when modern industrial weaponry was eviscerating human form: it brought the soldiers to the precipice of non-meaning in a world that was already ceasing to make sense’ (Das 2005, 37).\n\nMoreover, the men would get drenched, their soaking uniforms clinging to their haggard frames and giving them colds and even pneumonia (Farcau 1996, 100). Yet while the soldiers both eagerly anticipated and cursed the rainy summer months, they did not find relief during the short-lived winter weeks either. Many a soldier who lay dying of pneumonia or thirst somewhere in the impenetrable scrub must have wondered who they were actually fighting. In the struggle to survive, the boundaries between the natural and the industrial often became blurred. The intertwining cacti that cover large parts of the Chaco undergrowth and tortured the soldiers, for instance, resembled the lethal barbed wire entanglements positioned along the trenches. Addressing a Chaco in which the merging of nature and industrial war had generated hell on earth, Céspedes writes in his poem ‘Terciana Muda’ (Silent Fever): ‘You were ploughed by cries and cannons, they flowered, your roses: the wounds, they ripened, your fruits: the grenades, oh garden of torture!’ (Céspedes 1973, 15).\n\nDuring a long and agonising march under the scorching sun, Céspedes furthermore vividly describes the auditory experience of a sudden rain shower as ‘the rain that resonated crystal clear like a heavenly machine gun’ (Céspedes 1973, 146). On the battlefields, supermodernity and nature merged into a powerful olfactory impression when, according to Zotti, ‘The only thing that remains of the battle is the vague smell of gunpowder, dust clouds and death, mixed with the aroma of the Algarrobo tree and Esparto grass’ (Zotti 1974, 64).\n\nIn their constant struggle to stay alive in the deadly blend of natural and industrial forces, the soldiers had to be alert at all times. The troops thus had to get closely acquainted with both the Chaco’s natural environment and the enemy army, as the greatest instinct for the soldier body was to survive (see Winterton 2012). Sarmiento aptly describes his ears as ‘little antennae’ (1978, 70) that detected every sound and intrusion. In the Chaco certain animal noises also influenced the soldiers’ perception of a world in which war had interwoven the ‘industrial’ with the ‘natural’. A certain type of grenade, for example, became known as yacaveré as the noise it made was similar to the call of a local bird of that name (Zotti 1974, 35). The sounds of the Chaco also fused different indigenous and Latino Paraguayan ontologies. The distinct birdsong of the tove tojo or pájaro agorero (pessimistic bird, Herpetotheres cachinnans; also guaicurú in Guaraní) was considered a bad omen by the Ishir. In fact, tove tojo translates as ‘leave’ or ‘go far away’ and that is precisely what a person should do upon hearing the bird sing in the morning (Florentín 1984, 47; Escobar 2007, 226). During the war the tove tojo became well known among the Paraguayan soldiers, who believed that its song was a warning of the imminent appearance of enemy troops (Florentín 1984, 47; Paniagua 1994, 39). Others thought that the bird was lamenting the death of its female companion in one of the bloody battles fought by humans. Whereas other animals had long since withdrawn from the war-ravaged landscape, the mourning tove tojo had stayed and kept singing his sad melody while the soldiers groaned in pain on the ground below (Silva Lara 1979, 57–9).\n\nJust as with any war, it is difficult for those not directly involved to imagine the multi-sensorial experience of trying to survive during the Chaco War. The land these men were fighting over was killing them; therefore nature was often personified as a hostile adversary. Sarmiento clearly remembers the fear of becoming a victim to both the Paraguayans and the Chaco bush: ‘There existed an implicit and irrevocable commitment to not fall prisoner, but we were frightened by the notion of having already fallen into the trap of the scrub, identical [to the Paraguayan] in his hostile appearance’ (Sarmiento 1978, 76).\n\nComforting the senses\n\nBeing trapped inside the Chaco scrubland, this ‘prison of plants’ with its thorns and deadly diseases, instilled in the soldiers a dread of being ‘devoured by the jungle’ that mixed with the constant fear of being hit by enemy artillery (Sarmiento 1978, 76). This all-encompassing feeling of impotence and inescapability weighed hard on the homesick men who dreamed of being with their loved ones. Nonetheless, there were a few things that allowed the soldiers temporary respite from the sensorial intensity of the war and the Chaco bush.\n\nMen on both sides had the rural tradition of drinking mate, a type of tea made from yerba mate. The name yerba derives from the Spanish word hierba (herb) and the drink is made from the dried leaves of Ilex paraguariensis, a small tree native to subtropical South America. The leaves are harvested, dried and then crushed to a loose powder and placed into a guampa: a drinking vessel usually made from gourds, but bamboo and cattle hooves and horns are now also frequently used. The yerba is steeped in hot water and sipped through a metal bombilla (straw), which acts both as a straw and a sieve (Folch 2010, 9). Mate cocido or boiled mate is a blend of yerba and sugar, which caramelises when placed under a stack of embers. To finish, the whole mixture is added to boiling water and, depending on personal preference, topped off with a little milk (Folch 2010, 24). Yerba mate is high in vitamins and has medicinal properties. It is also believed to enhance mental clarity and ‘lift one’s spirits’ – properties that have earned it the name of ‘green gold’ (Benítez Alvarenga 1997, 24, 64).\n\nWhen water was available during the Chaco War, both mate and mate cocido constituted a valued part of the soldiers’ morning routine (Paniagua 1994, 44). The men would apparently filter the often foul-smelling water through the strong and bitter-tasting leaves in order to mask the stench. As the smoke from a fire inside the trenches would have given away their position to the enemy, the soldiers had no other choice but to have cold mate, also known as tereré (Benítez Alvarenga 1997, 52–3). Consumption of the tea (hot or cold) went far beyond the soldiers’ biological demands and the desire to satisfy thirst. In fact, mate and tereré are part of a ritual, with a serving and drinking etiquette that is vigorously respected by those who participate (Folch 2010, 9–10). Mate and tereré are about sharing, as according to Derlis Benítez Alvarenga:\n\nTereré creates a space for the peaceful and fraternal gathering amongst friends; a gathering with the other where time is a gift that allows the sharing of the good and bad, the joys and pains. It is the space where one listens and is being listened to. In short, it is the space that every human being needs, for his/her own eminent condition (Benítez Alvarenga 1997, 13–14; see also Benítez Alvarenga 2013).\n\nIn the trenches of the Chaco, preparing yerba mate was a comforting tradition that not only linked the soldiers with their distant pre-war lives but also synergised two radically different worlds. More poignantly perhaps, and in an effort to make the unfamiliar familiar, the ritual of passing around the guampa amongst comrades created a temporary safe haven in which they experienced collective solace from the disorientation and hardships they faced in the bush, and the absurdity and horrors of modern war.\n\nFaced with the excruciating effects of thirst, a soldier’s sense of comradeship was often tested. After hearing his superior’s words of caution to the squad about rationing the little water they had before a battle, Zotti remembers securing his canteen tightly to his belt on the eve of the Battle of Boquerón and although thirst was torturing him, he did not take a sip. He soon drifted off, listening to the water swishing inside the container, but he suddenly awoke, startled. His thoughts immediately turned to his caramayola and he only calmed down upon feeling it still securely attached to his belt. Yet to his great surprise it was empty. It was only later that he learned that one of his comrades had stealthily crawled over, opened the lid, inserted a bombilla and drained the canteen of its meagre contents (Zotti 1974, 36). The desperate water situation during the war had turned the bombilla, an instrument used to strengthen social relations during mate and tereré ceremonies, into a tool for survival.\n\nAlthough it is generally accepted that the indigenous populations were preparing mate long before the Spanish conquistadors discovered the drink and its properties (Folch 2010, 11), Paraguayans believe that the widespread national tradition of drinking tereré – which has also infiltrated into Mennonite life (see Stoesz and Stackley 1999, 183) – is rooted in the Chaco War (Benítez Alvarenga 1997, 52–3). In fact, today tereré is more than just a drink in Paraguay: it is a part of the nation’s identity and a source of national pride, linking Paraguayans with both their Guaraní roots and their mestizo forefathers who died as heroes in the defence of the patria (Benítez Alvarenga 1997, 43).\n\nOn the Bolivian side, mate also formed an integral part of Andean culture and the soldiers’ routine. For the Aymara and Quechua recruits, however, it was coca, the leaf from a small Andean shrub (Erythroxylon), which provided them the greatest relief from the hardships of industrial war (Bustamante Rodríguez 1987, 143). The coca leaf has been shown to provide vitamins, help with digestion and altitude sickness, and suppress hunger, cold and stress (Gootenberg 2008, 16). To benefit from its effects, a wad of leaves is stashed inside the hollow of the cheek and sucked for about an hour. A small portion of powdered alkaline ash is usually added to release and enhance the plant’s medicinal properties. According to the archaeological record, the chewing of coca leaves goes back at least 3,000 years in the region (Rivera et al. 2005). Although coca was briefly forbidden as ‘an invention of the devil’ by the Catholic Church in the sixteenth century, the Spanish soon realised that indigenous miners could subsist on a minimum of food and drink and work longer hours when sucking on coca leaves (Gagliano 1994, 49–51). When war broke out between Paraguay and Bolivia in 1932, Céspedes notes that ‘With his bag of coca and stoicism, the Indian does not need anything else to work. Now, during the war, he also needs a light machine gun or a rifle, the first instruments of mechanical precision that civilisation put into his hands’ (Céspedes 1975, 113). As the ration of coca leaves was limited in the Chaco, the men were often forced to go weeks without the familiar bulge in their cheeks (Céspedes 1975, 114). Left without the calming numbness, the soldiers now had to face the physical and psychological effects of war with heightened senses.\n\nThe significance of the coca leaf transcends the suppression or numbing of bodily urges. Indeed, much like the drinking of mate and tereré, the chewing of coca leaves is a ritual that follows a strict etiquette that is integral to Andean indigenous identity and ‘is used to mediate between man and the environment, and to appease the anger of the spirits of the ancestors living in the hills and mountains’ (Morales 1989, 24). The coca leaf erases the modern division between mind and matter (Latour 1993) as it acts like a mediator blurring the boundaries between humans and the material and more-than-human world:\n\ncoca chewing provides the context par excellence in which communication takes place … The offering of coca leaves draws one into social interaction and participation in the activities at hand. This social interaction includes not only the other persons present, but entities immanent in the living Earth as well: Mother Earth, the Mountain Lords, the ancient dead. Understanding the nature of this communicative bond, forged by coca chewing, means exploring an attitude in which land is experienced as animate, powerful and imbued with consciousness – a parallel society of Earth Persons with whom one is in constant interaction (Allen 1988, 23–4).\n\nWhile the coca leaf intimately tied the Aymara and Quechua soldiers to Andean cosmologies and landscapes, it seems to have failed to connect them with the alien surroundings of the Chaco. In the flat and frightening scrubland, the coca leaf must have nonetheless been a comforting presence and a link with the much-missed Andean mountain range. In a world that was continuously changing and ceased to make sense to the soldiers, the coca leaf allowed them to temporarily escape their confusing realities and find solace in the deep-rooted constancy of the coca-chewing tradition. Thus, amidst the absurdity and horrors of modern industrialised warfare, the coca-chewing indigenous soldier embodied the transcendence of temporal realities by fusing an indigenous tradition going back more than three millennia with twentieth-century supermodernity.\n\n***\n\nThe Mennonite introduction of agriculture, with its permanent settlements, pastures and Christian values, and the arrival of industrial warfare with its belligerent armies imposed themselves on what had hitherto been a predominantly hunter-gatherer landscape, resulting in the making and unmaking of a series of simultaneously contrasting and conflicting worlds in and across the Chaco’s thorny forests (Breithoff 2012, 147). The Mennonites considered the taming of the Chaco a test of faith from God and proof of the creating force of the industrious and pious man. Condemning violent conflict, they decided to arm themselves with a plough to ‘launch a peaceful war with the wilderness’ (Anonymous 1933, 27). The armies, on the other hand, arrived with trucks and carts full of mechanised weapons, ready to take the Chaco by force. Yet, despite their modern tools, the soldiers and the Mennonites struggled to survive in the bush. The soldiers in particular soon realised that in the face of nature, modernity became useless.\n\nBoth the armies and the Mennonites were dependent on local indigenous knowledge of the terrain and its resources in order to stay alive. Understanding the Chaco and ‘seeing’ it through the eyes of its indigenous people was the key to unlocking its secrets. It is thus vital that the dominant discourses about the Chaco as wasteland in need of mechanised intervention are counterbalanced by alternative indigenous perspectives (see Kuletz 1998). Indeed, the latter should not be dismissed as romantic or mythical fairy-tales but rather taken seriously as ‘worlds and knowledges otherwise’ (Blaser 2010, 17).\n\nIn contrast to the region’s indigenous communities, the Mennonites and soldiers considered nature an enemy, a threatening ‘Other’. Despite their indigenous roots, which tied them to the physical and spiritual forces of the Andes, the Aymara and Quechua soldiers could not find ‘Mother Earth’ in the Chaco and felt detached from it. Even though the Paraguayan soldiers were used to the hot climate and had some knowledge of the local flora and fauna, they also struggled to connect with the Chaco beyond their purely patriotic duty.\n\nThis was, however, not a simple case of humans against nature but of humans in natures (see Winters et al. 2001a). Thirst and its powerful effects on body and mind operated in both a practical and symbolic dimension and, by doing so, brutally linked the soldiers to the Chaco – often for eternity. The lack of water forced the men to physically scavenge and get to know the bush in their desperate search for a natural water source. On a symbolic level, the ‘white death’ became representative of the futility of the conflict. Like the digging of the dry well in Céspedes’ story, the Chaco War made no sense. In a world that the soldiers could no longer comprehend, thirst exposed them to new sensorial realities, in which humans, nature and the material culture of conflict were enmeshed. In this sense, the Chaco War is emblematic of modern conflict as a form of Anthropocene hyperobject. Although the soldiers (and Mennonites) entered the bush determined to model it after their respective ideological beliefs, they came out of it with their own personal and social identities shattered and reshaped by the natural forces of the bush and the experience of modern war. The armed conflict both made and unmade the Chaco whilst it simultaneously made and unmade each of its participants in new and ultimately transformative ways."
