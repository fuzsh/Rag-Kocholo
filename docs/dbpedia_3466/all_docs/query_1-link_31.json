        "text": "The Chaco War with Paraguay represented the largest undertaking by the Bolivian state up to that point and proved to be a definitive turning point in the country's social and political history. This article exposes how little we know about the conflict and examines anew how many fought, who these soldiers were, and the mechanisms by which the state recruited and disciplined them. My examination of wartime mobilization and desertion shows that the central government adopted a multipronged approach, ceding power to local actors to enact mobilization orders, negotiating with interest groups to ensure continued production and protect particular men from recruitment, and relying on violence to enforce a documentary regime. Drawing on new archival sources, most importantly the testimony from wartime military justice proceedings, the article concludes that the oligarchic state was surprisingly successful in mobilizing and retaining soldiers as it faced the formidable challenges of modern mass warfare.\n\nStefano Agnoletto, Brian J Griffith, and Cristina Palmieri, eds. \"The Origins of the Welfare State: Global and Comparative Approaches\" Zapruder World: An International Journal for the History of Social Conflict 3 (2016) ISSN: 2385-1171 View Volume: http://www.zapruderworld.org/volume-3/ \"In 1930, Enrique Linares wrote in to the Municipal Judge of Corocoro, a small copper mining town 90 km southwest of La Paz: \"You, sir, are aware of the events in the middle of the night last 26 June, in this city and in the house inhabited by high ranking employees of the mining company Corocoro United Copper Mines, Ltd. (CUCM), which to the public has been given the name \"Attack of the Indian Miners on the Company.\" What a falsehood!\" The attack in question had nothing to do with the local Aymara communities who farmed and worked the mines, Linares insisted. Instead, he named several young white collar employees of the mine, both Bolivian and foreign, who were seen on that night by multiple witnesses dressed as Aymara peasants. These young men, he argued, armed with guns as well as homemade bombs made from jam jars and tea tins, attacked and set fire to their own living quarters, killing in the process a neighboring indigenous man named Mateo Chipana. Linares also suggested that this plan was premeditated, with high ranking officials spreading rumors of an attack prior to the 26th, and dismissing the guard who would normally patrol the grounds on the night in question.\""
