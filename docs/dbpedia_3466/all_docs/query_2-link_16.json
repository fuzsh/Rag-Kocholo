        "text": "This article investigates the use of coca by the Bolivian Army during the Chaco War of 1932–35. I present research that reveals the surprising extent to which the Bolivian Army provisioned coca to its soldiers as a substitute for adequate nutrition; as a morale booster; as a stimulant; and as a medicine. The article explores the social and cultural implications of mass coca consumption by Bolivian soldiers, many of whom were mestizos who had never before chewed the leaf. Ultimately, I argue that the pervasiveness of coca within the traumatic popular experience of the Chaco War sowed the seeds of a historic transformation of the politics of coca in Bolivia. The Chaco War initiated a process by which coca in Bolivia was transformed from a neo-colonial marker of the Indian caste to a material and symbolic element of an emergent interethnic working class. Through a comparative analysis of the Bolivian army's use of coca in the Chaco War with the German army's use of methamphetamine during World War II, this article concludes with a consideration of the ways in which the present case study expands our understanding of the crucial but under-studied historical relationship between drugs and warfare.\n\n10. Statement of M. Pinto-Escalier, “Preliminary Discussion on the Basis of Series of Measures Adopted by the Advisory Committee on the Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs.” Opium Advisory Committee (OAC), League of Nations documents C.760.M.260.1924.XI, 63. It should be kept in mind that in early twentieth-century Bolivia the ethnic categories of “Indian,” “half-caste” (Pinto-Escalier's English translation of mestizo), and even “white” were contested, unstable, and at times a function of the observer's social position. The mestizo category, encompassing a wide swath of Bolivia's population, was particularly ambiguous. As a political and cultural concept, mestizaje was frequently disparaged in the early twentieth century by Bolivian Liberals, such as luminaries Alcides Arguedas, Bautista Saavedra, and Manuel Rigoberto Paredes, who viewed mestizos as a corrupting influence on the indigenous laboring caste. See Brooke Larson, “Redeemed Indians, Barbarized Cholos: Crafting Neolcolonial Modernity in Liberal Bolivia,” in Political Cultures in the Andes, 1750–1950, Nils Jacobsen and Cristóbal Aljovín de Losada, eds. (Durham: Duke University Press, 2005). Yet, there was nuance to elite views on the question of mestizaje. Javier Sanjines has argued compellingly that pre-Chaco War liberals conceived of ethnic mixture as divided into two distinct subcategories: mestizos and cholos, the former referring to Hispanicized mixed-race people and the latter to “Indianized” urban mixed-race people “who follow indigenous cultural norms.” C., Javier Sanjines, Mestizaje Upside-Down: Aesthetic Politics in Modern Bolivia (Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2004), 194–195Google Scholar n5. The general acceptance of the former—and denigration of the latter—by politically and economically dominant criollos has led some scholars of Bolivian culture to view creoles and Hispanicized mestizos as a unified group: the mestizo-criollo. Sanjines, Mestizaje Upside-Down, 24. While the practice of pijchu was not limited to rural indigenous communities, it would have marked the chewer as either an Indian or a cholo, as opposed to a criollo or criolloized (Westernized) mestizo.\n\n33. In a provocative study, Silvia Rivera has documented the rise of a coca culture among middle-class and elite Argentines in the 1920s, a phenomenon she links to “the urban elite's romantic discovery of the gaucho.” Silvia, Rivera C., “Here, Even Legislators Chew Them,” in Illicit Flows and Criminal Things: States, Borders, and the Other Side of Globalization, William van Schendel and Itty Abraham, eds. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2010), 130–131Google Scholar. Rivera also notes that, as a result of the adoption of the habit by northern Argentine elites, the chewing of coca did not function as an ethnic or racial marker but rather had evolved into “a symbol of regional belonging.” Rivera C., “Here, Even Legislators Chew Them,” 131.\n\n59. This undated document is printed on the letterhead of the Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, which marks it as having been produced in 2009 or later. The document is a fascinating example of continuity between the elite nationalistic pro-cocaism of the early 1930s (which underlay the army's provision of coca to its troops during the Chaco War) and the “popular coca nationalism” of the early twenty-first century that underlies reports such as Cnl. Guido Cuentas Vargas Daen, “La hoja de coca en la Guerra del Chaco”(“The Coca Leaf in the Chaco War”), a government report commissioned by COSDEP, Secretaria General Permanente.\n\n65. “The single most common disease treated in the Villa Montes hospital in 1933 was avitaminosis (1,999 cases), which was technically the lack of certain vitamins, most commonly vitamin C, but actually caused by general, extreme malnutrition. . . . . Avitaminosis was a result of the inability of the army to provision its troops in the field and was exacerbated by Argentina's (unofficial) support for Paraguay, which meant food could not reach the Bolivian Army through Puerto Yrigoyen, an Argentine port on the Pilcomayo River.” Zulawski, Unequal Cures, 62."
