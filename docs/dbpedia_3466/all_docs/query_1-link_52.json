Start at the top and work your way down to our latest entry!\n\nAs many of you may have noticed, we kept this page up-to-date during the first year of our life on-the-road. Since then we've been keeping a journal and taking photographs, but haven't completed all the pages. They'll be posted early in 2001.\n\nWe recently took a trip to Hawaii (without HarveyRV) and have included our experiences."
