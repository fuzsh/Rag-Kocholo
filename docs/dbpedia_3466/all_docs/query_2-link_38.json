        "text": "The dissolution of the Mennonite Nam Cum mission in the province of Chaco has been approached by anthropological studies of religious change as a fundamental milestone in shaping the contemporary dynamics of the region. This literature has considered the episode in a strongly local setting. Using various archival sources such as personal diaries, letters, publications, administrative reports, and ethnographic work, this essay reintegrates the episode into the global context of paradigm shift in Mennonite missions in the mid-twentieth century. One of the central factors in this analysis is the profound influence of the discipline of anthropology on the indigenization of Mennonite missions, which was inscribed in the context of the \"anthropological turn\" of Christian missions and the growing awareness of the relevance of contextualization and the understanding of local cultures for a true evangelical mission. This essay argues that the decision to close the Nam Cum mission invites an exploration of how Mennonite missionaries experienced this new model of incarnating the gospel in local culture, while also permitting a fresh look at its significance for the constitution of anthropological studies in the Chaco region.\n\nThe Jesuits&#39; political, social, and economic régime had a profound impact on the Guaraní demographic system. In the relatively long period of peace and stability, between the early 1640s and the early 1730s, the population increased from 40,000 to more than 140,000. In spite of high mortality and recurrent epidemics introduced from abroad, the Jesuits&#39; emphasis on early and monogamous unions maintained the birth rate at the maximum level under normal conditions, generating a large enough surplus of births relative to deaths to compensate for deªcits during years of crisis. The expulsion and departure of the Jesuits in 1767/68, however, set in motion a process of irreversible decline, and led to the diaspora of the missions&#39; population.\n\nMigrations among the Mennonite people were historically undertaken in an attempt to secure religious freedom. Migrations are still being made by the most conservative Mennonite groups. This article briefly examines the process of migration in Mennonite history and emphasizes the role of migration among one particular group, the Old Colony: A Mennonite settlement in northern Alberta serves as a case study for this investigation, and demonstrates that the preservation of lifestyle is a fundamental objective of all Old Colony migrations. Between 1950 and 1970, families from this community moved, in succession, to another part of northern Alberta, to a new settlement in Belize, and finally in a remarkable exodus, to Bolivia."
