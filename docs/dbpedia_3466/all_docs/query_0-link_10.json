        "text": "Book Abstract Gender- Based Violence in Latin American and Iberian Cinemas rethinks the intersection between violence and its gendered representation. This is a groundbreaking contribution to the international debate on the cinematic construction of gender- based violence. With essays from diverse cultural backgrounds and institutions, this collection analyzes a wide range of films across Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula. Chapter Abstract It has been argued that in the recent era of Brazil’s reckoning with its dictatorial past, the perspective of women has remained largely on the margins. The films of Lúcia Murat, Emilia Silveira and Flávia Castro, among others, help to rectify this marginalization by placing women’s experiences at the centre of attention. Their films challenge dominant discourses that typically portray women as passive victims of masculine institutions (the police and the armed forces) to highlight, instead, new themes and perspectives, including the active participation of women as revolutionaries and their ongoing commitment to memory politics. Some of these films also shed light on the gendered nature of repression as they suggest how the forms of violence adopted by the state responded to wider anxieties and expectations concerning the place of women in society. By means of close textual readings and personal interviews with the directors, I address two main questions: What specific contributions have women film-makers made to reconstructing memories of the dictatorship in Brazil? How does the gender of the film-maker matter when addressing the way state violence is remembered? In order to do that I focus on five films: Que bom te ver viva and A memória que me contam (Lúcia Murat, 1989 and 2012), Diário de uma busca (Flávia Castro, 2010), Vou contar para os meus filhos (Tuca Siqueira, 2012) and Setenta (Emilia Silveira, 2013).\n\nAlthough Andrés di Tella is among the leading documentary filmmakers in South America, his work has received scant attention in the Anglophone world. Di Tella's essayistic films mix personal and intimate perspectives with public and historical concerns, crafting a tentative filmic voice that is articulated on the borders between the public and the private. In his subjective explorations of personal and collective pasts, di Tella calls on material objects to play a vital role. Subjective recollections are accompanied by the constitution of collections of objects, material items that are the remainders from and the keys to the past. Remembering is remembering with and through things and senses of self and identity are forged and questioned in dialogue with constellations of objects. This article examines the interaction between subjects and objects in di Tella's work with special attention to Fotografías (Photographs, 2007) and Hachazos (Ax Blows, 2011). When one thinks of Andrés di Tella's growing body of work, made-up primarily of first-person essay films, what first comes to mind are not material objects but rather subjects and subjectivity. Incorporating the filmmaker as\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to explore processes of intergenerational and family memory construction by focusing on Argentine and Chilean documentaries produced in the last fifteen years. Lattanzi analyzes documentaries by the biological children of victims of the most recent Chilean and Argentine dictatorships to show that their films have less to do with reconstructing a life as it was than with thinking about how subjects exist and persist in a postdictatorial moment characterized by the exhaustion of community and the end of utopia. Documentaries by filmmakers like Maria Ines Roque, Albertina Carri, Nicolas Prividera, Lorena Giachino Torrens, and Macarena Aguilo privilege daily life and the family as strategic arenas for reconfiguring identities torn asunder by dictatorial violence. More than attempting a fictitiously integral autobiographical gesture, the films stake their claim on questioning the very notion of autobiography.\n\nThis paper explores the relations between the film that ushered a new era of political documentary filmmaking in Argentina -- Fernando Birri and the Santa Fe Documentary School’s _Tire die ́_ [Throw me a dime] (1960)-- and development theories, which sought to produce ‘underdevelopment’ as an object of knowledge within the geopolitical context of the late 1950s. _Tire die ́_ draws its title from a sequence showing dozens of shantytown children shouting this phrase while running alongside a train. Instead of situating the conditions for the making of _Tire die ́_ strictly within the trajectory of Argentine cinema’s political radicalization, this article links them to development theories originating in the US and in supranational institutions. Although focused on development, these theories also defined underdevelopment by elaborating a series of premises, equivalencies and symbols. When adopted and modified by Argentine political discourse, these theories came to constitute a new prism through which to examine and show social and economic marginality, equating it with underdevelopment. This article demonstrates that _Tire die ́_ deploys a documentary gaze on social and economic marginality that, while taking up characteristic categories of development discourse, both subverts its original connotations and critiques the false promise embodied in capitalist development.\n\nOver 453 films have been made focusing on the topic of the last dictatorship in Argentina (1976-1983), otherwise known worldwide as the Dirty War. This time period is characterized by the vile human rights abuses committed by the military junta against those who opposed the government, leading to the disappearances of 30.000 people, many of whom left children behind. These children were often forced to grow up, giving up their childhood, due to their parents' militancy. In the national story of the dictatorship, these children's stories and experiences have often been forgotten. This thesis will investigate the portrayal of the last Argentine dictatorship through cinema, from the perspective of children who grew up during the dictatorship, often children of the disappeared. These films often focus on the recreation of identity, their disappeared parents, and the loss of childhood innocence. Through fiction and documentary film, these filmmakers are able to use a self-reflexive process to recreate their identity and self-represent their own stories, rather than fitting into the narratives forced upon them."
