It disclaims any other motive.\n\nEDITOR’S PREFACE\n\nThe importance of this publication for the military historian of the Chaco War (1932-1935), in which Paraguay and Bolivia were involved, can hardly be overrated. Marshal Estigarribia held in that armed conflict—one of the most sanguinary ever fought by two South-American republics—the unique position of being the top planner (perhaps the only one) and the commander in chief of the Paraguayan army in the field during the entire course of the campaign. The remarkable success of his leadership is a well-known fact. He emerged from the Chaco War as one of the outstanding masters of strategy in South-American history.\n\nThese memoirs, which he intended to publish under the title of The Epic of the Chaco, were written in Washington, D.C., where he discharged his duties as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary Paraguay between 1938 and 1939. The Editor was the counsellor of the Paraguayan legation in the same period and had the privilege of collaborating in drafting these recollections as they are set down in the present volume. The drafting was made simultaneously in Spanish and English, and, for the latter language, the intervention of the late Charles H. Moore, the English assistant of the legation, is especially recognized. This publication, therefore, is not, properly speaking, a rendering of any pre-existent Spanish original, for the English manuscript took shape at the same time as the Spanish version from the direct dictation and under the immediate supervision of Marshal Estigarribia himself, who by then possessed a fair knowledge of the English language. The two versions, of course, were checked carefully with each other, but neither had any precedence over its counterpart. This statement, however, does not cover the many documents transcribed throughout the text of the narrative since they were originally written in Spanish and translated into English for the present version.\n\nIn formulating these memoirs, Marshal Estigarribia relied on the records of his General Headquarters in the Chaco, of which records he had been presented by his clerical aides with a complete replica of the contents of all the files at the termination of the war, including a bulky set of maps (showing, day by day, the position of the armies), the official correspondence with the government in Asunción, and the reports of the army commanders at the front.{1} But, above all, he drew substantially from the two invaluable sources of his war diary and his own lucid memory. By the extensive use he made of both, The Epic of the Chaco is bound to be of exceptional interest for the military historian since he will find in them the inner motive power of the actions of this leader, the real psychological key to his decisions, and his personal style in approaching every problem that confronted him.\n\nOnly two typewritten copies were made of each version. One bilingual set was kept by the Marshal, and the other by this Editor. Shortly after the first draft was completed, Marshal Estigarribia went back home on account of his having been nominated presidential candidate in 1939, and there was no time to make a joint rereading of the manuscript with a view to polishing some passages for the sake of precision, fluency, or clarity. He indicated, however, that this Editor should undertake the revision task alone in order to suggest in due course any possible changes. Accordingly, the Editor went over the entire manuscript again and introduced in the context of both of the Spanish and the English versions some slight modifications, of a purely formal character. But, unfortunately, when the Editor returned to Paraguay, Marshal Estigarribia was so overcrowded with work that until his death no favorable moment was found to compare notes with him. The maps in this volume numbered 1 to 7 were roughly sketched by Marshal Estigarribia himself and then drawn in their present form by Mrs. Carmen G. de Ynsfran, under the guidance of the Marshal.\n\nIn the Editor’s opinion, The Epic of the Chaco requires only a minimum of explanatory notes. Some of these were contributed by Marshal Estigarribia at the time that the manuscript was prepared. All such notes contributed by the Marshal have been initialed. In addition, the Editor has seen fit to contribute, in the interest of clarity, some additional notes. None of the notes contributed by the Editor has been initialed.\n\nPABLO MAX YNSFRAN\n\nThe University of Texas\n\nFebruary, 1949\n\nEDITOR’S BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF MARSHAL ESTIGARRIBIA\n\nJosé Félix Estigarribia{2} was born in the town of Caraguatay, Paraguay, on February 21, 1888. Both of his parents were of Basque extraction, Don Mateo Estigarribia and Doña Casilda Insaurralde. Thus, this family belonged to the sturdy stock of the Vascons—a hard-working, tenacious lot, silent, profoundly religious, but not exactly brilliant—in contraposition to the real Spaniards, the gentlemanly Castilian or the light-hearted and gay Andalusian. The Estigarribias as well as the Insaurraldes had attained some distinction in the early history of independent Paraguay.\n\nDon Mateo, the father of the future Marshal, was a combination of farmer and village silversmith. A tall man—no shorter than six feet—blond, grey-eyed,{3} he became blind in the prime of his life on account of a head wound sustained during the war of the Triple Alliance. He died in 1909 surrounded by the affection and respect of family and friends. Doña Casilda is still alive. Strongly built, the mettle of her personality, in spite of her ninety years of age, seems to be kept intact. Her thoughts are clear and the expression of her piercing, dark-blue eyes reveals alertness of mind. She lives with one of her sons, José Domingo, on a farm of the latter in Northern Paraguay, on the banks of the Aquidabán River.\n\nDon Mateo and Doña Casilda had four sons. José Félix was the third. They moved to the village of Capiatá, a few miles from Asunción, the capital of Paraguay, when their children were in their early teens. While they were in Capiatá, the first School of Agriculture was inaugurated in the country under the direction of the Swiss naturalist, Dr. Moisés S. Bertoni, and Don Mateo expressed his desire that young José Félix attend the new institution. José Félix complied, and in 1903 enrolled in the school, where three years later he obtained his diploma as agronomist He proved to be an excellent student and made the highest marks.\n\nAfter finishing his agricultural training, José Félix did not display, however, much interest in his profession and decided rather to improve his academic standing by entering the Colegio Nacional to get the degree of bachiller, which is the prerequisite in the Latin-American scholastic system for admission to the professional colleges. Since he was very poor (he had been able to attend the School of Agriculture only through a scholarship), he worked as a court clerk to earn a living.\n\nOne morning in July, 1908, when he was going to work from Trinidad, a suburb of Asunción where he lived, José Félix noticed that something abnormal was going on in the city. As he entered the city proper, he learned that a revolution—the favorite and disastrous game of Spanish-American politics—was in full swing. Without much hesitation, he joined the revolutionary forces, which eventually became victorious. José Félix had found his vocation, almost by chance. He liked the army and in 1910 applied for a permanent position. He was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant of infantry, and thus started his military career.\n\nIn the army the young Lieutenant studied hard and grasped the essentials of his new profession with the insight of a mind naturally gifted for the military art. His retiring temperament did not help him much, but his efficiency and earnestness were amply recognized. In February, 1911, another revolution broke out, and the next month he saw action in the clash of Bonete, a bitter and decisive struggle where the revolutionists were smashed. He was badly wounded in the left arm which remained partly paralysed thenceforth.\n\nOnce recovered from his wound, Lieutenant Estigarribia was sent for further training to Chile, whose army enjoyed then the prestige of being the best in Spanish America. He studied in Chile two years and returned to Paraguay in 1913. In 1914 he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant; he reached the rank of captain in 1917.\n\nWhile stationed in the garrison of Concepción, in 1916 Estigarribia married Julia Miranda Cueto, a young girl of the best traditional families in the country. She proved to be an ideal companion for the young soldier, by her total devotion to him, her quiet charm, and the matron-like atmosphere with which she surrounded her home. The only child of that marriage, Graciela, later became the indispensable collaborator and secretary of her father, who adored her. Graciela has the outer vivacity that was lacking in both her parents, together with the beauty of her mother and the bright mind of her father. She married Dr. Horacio A. Fernández.\n\nDuring a new civil war in 1922 Captain Estigarribia definitely confirmed his exceptional talent as a military leader by conceiving and personally executing a daring maneuver which resulted in the victorious end for the government of a protracted insurrection. Promoted to the rank of major, he went to Europe two years later, as he explains with some details in the Preliminary Reminiscenses of The Epic of the Chaco.\n\nSeven months after the termination of the Chaco War in February, 1936, and while General Estigarribia was inspecting the military posts established in the recently reconquered territory, the army stationed in Asunción revolted against and overthrew the administration of President Eusebio Ayala. The General urgently was recalled to the capital by the revolutionists and thrown into prison. After six months in jail—for no reason other than his renown as the indisputable hero of the Chaco War—he went into exile. At the invitation of the Uruguayan government, he taught military strategy for one semester in the Superior School of War of that country. Later he made a tour through Brazil as the official guest of the Brazilian government. He returned to Uruguay where he stayed until—through another revolution, needless to say—a new government was inaugurated in Paraguay which permitted him to return home in February, 1938. On his arrival in Asunción, he was greeted by a tremendous popular demonstration. Shortly afterwards he was appointed to head the Paraguayan legation in Washington, D.C., which he accepted, and came to the United States.\n\nOn account of the unsettled political condition in Paraguay, General Estigarribia made two trips home during his tenure in Washington, and in the first of them he intervened decisively in the long negotiations which were then conducted in Buenos Aires under the sponsorship of some neutral American nations in order to work out a treaty of peace between Paraguay and Bolivia, since the fire in the Chaco had ceased through an armistice only. Using his personal influence lavishly and his undeniable diplomatic skill, he managed to overcome all the impasses, and, in that manner, the treaty sought for between the two countries was finally signed on July 21, 1938, putting an end to the century-old dispute over the Chaco.{4}\n\nAnarchy threatened to break loose once more in Paraguay, and, after many attempts at some remedies to prevent it, the only seeming solution was to elect General Estigarribia for the next presidential term. He was extremely reluctant to mix in politics, but in the end was unable to ignore the insistent appeals made to his patriotism. He accepted the nomination and was elected. His inauguration took place on August 15, 1939. But the restlessness of the armed forces as well as of some political factions made it impossible for him to govern through constitutional restrictions. Thereupon he assumed full powers on February 18, 1940, with the promise of making presently a constitutional revision to revert to normality. That he did with the Constitution of July 10, 1940—approved by a plebiscite on August 4 of the same year. Under his prudent leadership, a revival of hope appeared little by little to spread over the country, when suddenly a stroke of fate again hit Paraguay most cruelly. On the morning of September 7, 1940, while President Estigarribia and his wife were flying to a summer resort, the propeller of the plane broke in mid-air and the machine plummeted to the ground killing the president, Doña Julia, and the pilot. He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal posthumously the same day of this tragic end.\n\nPhysically, Marshal Estigarribia was a man of mid-stature, stocky, with white complexion, brown eyes, and dark, slightly curled hair. He was very sensitive to the possibility of being fat, and although he could, and did, enjoy good and generous eating, he had to impose a strict discipline upon himself in order to prevent being led too far by his appetite. He even devised unusual deterrents for this inclination to obesity. For instance, he used to read for hours standing up. During the Chaco campaign, he would have only one meal a day, about noon. At breakfast, he helped himself to a cup of maté—a native tea of the Plata region—and nothing more. For supper he limited his menu to one glass of milk and some cookies. In the same period, after his midday meal and before starting his afternoon work, he would walk for miles, in winter as well as in summer, to the exasperation of his aides. His dislike for the siesta—a deep-rooted habit in Spanish America—was paramount. Also during the Chaco war he would go to bed invariably at ten o’clock, with severe orders not to be disturbed under any circumstances. He was up at seven o’clock every morning. He was not a teetotaller, but made a point not to drink during the war, and never drank a glass of any wine or liquor. Normally an inveterate smoker, during the war he smoked one cigarette daily and no more.\n\nMarshal Estigarribia possessed an imperturbably well-balanced mind and reasoned along the lines of clear, simple, but forcible logic. He never let any harsh impulses take hold of his thoughts or influence his actions. The most impressive trait of his personality was his alert lucidity and cold command over his nerves. His authority over his subordinates derived from his quiet and natural self-reliance, together, of course, with his considerable technical knowledge and ability. Soft-spoken and amiable, he would not raise his voice or make any impatient retort, although he knew how to fling back a sharp remark, if necessary. In his demeanor he was the opposite of the traditional bursting, saber-rattling, military swashbuckler. He never tried to strike any martial chord for the show.\n\nHis psychological penetration was probably the real secret of Marshal Estigarribia’s most resounding military successes. In the final analysis, strategy consisted for him of letting the enemy fall in the pitfalls of his own temperament, by inducing him to make full use of his bad, or worst, judgment. Therefore, he would endeavor first to know the soul of his enemy, and, for accomplishing that aim, he was endowed with an uncommon insight and quick comprehension. Once he was sure of the type of foe he was dealing with, he would prime his weapons meticulously, and, at the opportune moment, would strike at the weak point with relentless obstinacy. He would not hesitate then to gamble everything in one stroke. He did that masterfully with his opponent in the Bolivian camp, General Hans Kundt, in the battle of Zenteno. General Kundt would not cede an inch of the terrain for sheer pride. Since Estigarribia knew that Kundt would not move, he began a wide encirclement noticeable for everyone except the haughty German leader. When Kundt understood what was happening, it was too late, and he lost two-thirds of his army.\n\nMarshal Estigarribia was a well-cultured man. He spoke French with perfect fluency. He was a consistent student of history, and was particularly fond of the biographical crop of books of the post-World War I era. In Washington he endeavored strenuously to learn English as quickly as possible to study American history and institutions.\n\nMarshal Estigarribia was not deprived of a sound and jovial sense of humor. Some of his witticisms were of genuine vintage. Once he agreed to write the preface of a book. But the writer of the book insisted, I may rest assured, then, that you will read the manuscript and write the preface, Estigarribia replied, Oh, no! After demanding of me the sacrifice of writing the preface, I hope you will be considerate enough to spare me the additional burden of reading the manuscript! One officer was dismissed from some position because of his proclivity to hard drinking. Someone did not know the reason of the dismissal, and asked Marshal Estigarribia why. The latter explained, He is an agitator. This is very surprising to me, said the inquirer, ‘T never would have imagined that he is an agitator. Yes, added Estigarribia, he agitates the cocktail shaker too often.\"\n\nMarshal Estigarribia’s admiration for the United States was deep and sincere. In international matters he was resolved to collaborate most closely with the United States, even if such might awaken some resentment on the part of Argentina, which, when he was inaugurated as president, was not friendly to that country. At the time of the fall of France and the seemingly imminent collapse of Great Britain in 1940, Marshal Estigarribia, alarmed by the possibility that the Germans might break the British blockade and land on South-American soil unchecked, suggested to President Roosevelt that air bases be built in Paraguay for the defense of that continent. That was probably the first offer made spontaneously to the United States by any South-American republic for immediate and unreserved collaboration during the past conflagration. President Roosevelt dispatched without delay a military commission to Asunción to talk over that matter with the Paraguayan president. Unhappily, while that commission was on its way to Paraguay, Marshal Estigarribia was killed in the accident of September 7th, and the American commissioners reached Asunción only to attend his funeral.\n\nAUTHOR’S PREFACE\n\nWith the publication of these memoirs, I do not intend to offer a military history of the Chaco War, but rather to organize my personal recollections of the campaign in a comprehensive whole, in the hope that they may shed some light on various aspects thereof.\n\nNeither do I purport to give a purely professional account. Since my real goal is to emphasize the titanic effort of the Paraguayan people in the defense of their honor and their homeland, I do not think that a technical description alone of the campaign will attain that goal. The greatness of the defense of the Chaco is more human than military. It cannot be compressed within the strict limitations of a professional specialty.\n\nThe experiences herein narrated are either personal or properly documented, with very few exceptions—one of these being the Bolivian plan for the invasion of the Chaco attributed to General Kundt. I cannot certify that it was exactly as outlined in Chapter I, but I based my sketch on some trustworthy information, gleaned by our intelligence service, which later seemed to be unmistakably confirmed by the behavior of the Bolivian army at the outset of the operations in the field.\n\nIn the chronological succession of events, some minute details more than once may strike the reader as unnecessary. By not sparing them, however, I wanted to introduce in the picture all the factors, no matter how apparently insignificant, which, in my opinion, have come to influence a given episode, and all the incidents that have handicapped the realization of a plan. Without those details some developments probably may impress the reader as obscure. On the other hand, I wanted to show the complexity of activities that the Commander-in-Chief had to attend to in order to keep the whole situation under control.\n\nUnfortunately, for lack of time, I have not surveyed in a special chapter the invaluable services rendered by the different branches of the Paraguayan army in the course of the campaign, each within its own sphere. Eventually, I will pay them this tribute. They will always deserve the national gratitude because, in spite of so many material limitations, they made possible the epic of the Chaco.\n\nJOSÉ FÉLIX ESTIGARRIBIA\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nFebruary 4, 1939\n\nPRELIMINARY REMINISCENCES\n\nThe Chaco problem sprang from the lack of precision in the jurisdictional deliminations of the different administrative divisions of the Spanish colonial Empire in America. When Paraguay secured her independence from Spain in 1811, and Bolivia in 1825, there was no Chaco problem between the two new republics. Paraguay was born to her independent life as a member of the geographical community tributary to the Río de la Plata, that is to say, as a part of the Atlantic system of southern South America. Bolivia, on the other hand, was constituted as a country belonging to the Andes, and, in consequence, tributary to the Pacific Ocean. The Chaco{5} is bounded entirely on the east by the Paraguay River, and because of this fact it falls completely within the Atlantic system. Asunción, the capital of Paraguay during the colonial period, and afterwards, capital of the republic of the same name, is located facing the Chaco with the Paraguay River in between. It was obvious that under such circumstances Asunción should exercise immediate jurisdiction over the Chaco. The administrative centers of Upper Perú (such was the name of Bolivia in the colonial period) were separated from the Chaco proper by gigantic mountains and vast deserts stretching over hundreds of miles. Therefore they could not—even from a physical point of view, if I may say so—exercise any influence over the Chaco, and actually they never did. So, when independence arrived there was not any question about the Paraguayan jurisdiction over the Chaco—a natural fact recognized for centuries, except by the Argentine republic, for reasons which are not here pertinent. Independent Paraguay accordingly occupied the Chaco, in the habitable sections, without any objection, because Paraguay and the Chaco practically form one indissoluble geographic unit.\n\nBut there still remained the precise definition of the boundaries in the hinterland of the Chaco, which was very little explored and little known during the Spanish dominion. This hinterland extends as far as the Republic of Bolivia. The problem was thus reduced to a delimitation of the line of separation between the two republics.. And upon these terms the first negotiations were conducted for a definite settlement of the common frontiers between Paraguay and Bolivia.\n\nIn 1879 an event occurred which was bound to give a different turn to the question. In the so-called War of the"
