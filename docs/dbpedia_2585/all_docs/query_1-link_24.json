        "text": "Our real power lies in our ability to make choices. Those in power tend to make us believe we don‚Äôt have a choice to make or convince us that we‚Äôre better off letting them make choices for us. The onus is on us to reclaim our sovereignty by owning our choices and making them with intent and presence. Check out more on my thoughts behind my #IOwnMyChoices in my clip below and chime in. Booya! ü§ôüèæ #ihealmytraumas #celestialstewardship\n\nCivil Rights are Protected Through Non Discrimination Acts Practiced in Corporate America. Created in an Attempt to Operate with Respect and Professionalism towards All Walks of Life as a Foundation to ensure a well rounded business model. Without a Moral Business Compass Accountability to Grow Wealth at All cost has turned Corporate America into the Devil's Playground. Lying, Stealing & Cheating quickly over shadow Non Discrimination Acts & Company Mission Statements become irrelevant when covering up the Cost of Heartless Success. If Your Mission Statement is Not Being Respected within Your Organization what does that say about your Business? How easy would it be to hold each Business Accountable for Breaking Its Own Internal Commitments. Pay Outs For All Who Have Been Wronged By the Greed of those living Life out of Alignment with Universal Law. A Universal Moral Compass for Those Who Have Lost Their Own. #lovelybychoice #divinefeminine #oneness #greed #accountability\n\nDispute Boards: what do you really think? How useful are they as a mechanism for dispute avoidance and resolution mechanism. We all think we know, but now is your chance to help us find out a little bit more. A new survey released by the Centre of Construction Law & Dispute Resolution, King's College London, has just gone live. You can find all the details you need & copies of the questionnaires here: https://lnkd.in/eysD-NEe This project, \"2024 Dispute Boards International Report: An Empirical Study on the Use of Dispute Boards,\" is led by Renato Nazzini & Raquel Macedo Moreira, who have been working tremendously hard over the past few months to prepare the survey questions. I know, as I am part of the Steering Group. We are very grateful for their time and effort. Our aim is a truly provide a wide-ranging report, gathering insights from across the globe; affording a 'voice' to all participants in all building and engineering industries on carefully designed questions. This is why there are separate surveys for commercial entities, individual practitioners, funders and nominating bodies. The survey aims to build on previous work carried out by the Dispute Resolution Board Foundation and will cover the period 2018-2023. Of course to do this, we need your help, so thanks in advance for your time and support. #disputeboards #constructionlaw #disputeavoidance"
