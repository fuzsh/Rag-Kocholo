        "text": "Favourite Emirati dish: I have so many because it has a lot of herbs and vegetables. Harees (oats with chicken) is one of them\n\nFavourite place to go to: Dubai Mall because it has lots of sports shops.\n\nHer motivation: My performance because I know that whatever I do, if I put the effort in, I’ll get results\n\nDuring her free time: I like to drink coffee - a latte no sugar and no flavours. I do not like cold drinks\n\nPet peeve: That with every meal they give you a fries and Pepsi. That is so unhealthy\n\nAdvice to anyone who wants to be an ironman: Go for the goal. If you are consistent, you will get there. With the first one, it might not be what they want but they should start and just do it\n\nThe flights\n\nEtihad and Emirates fly direct to Kolkata from Dh1,504 and Dh1,450 return including taxes, respectively. The flight takes four hours 30 minutes outbound and 5 hours 30 minute returning.\n\nThe trains\n\nNumerous trains link Kolkata and Murshidabad but the daily early morning Hazarduari Express (3’ 52”) is the fastest and most convenient; this service also stops in Plassey. The return train departs Murshidabad late afternoon. Though just about feasible as a day trip, staying overnight is recommended.\n\nThe hotels\n\nMursidabad’s hotels are less than modest but Berhampore, 11km south, offers more accommodation and facilities (and the Hazarduari Express also pauses here). Try Hotel The Fame, with an array of rooms from doubles at Rs1,596/Dh90 to a ‘grand presidential suite’ at Rs7,854/Dh443.\n\nWhat: The Al Burda Festival\n\nWhen: November 14 (from 10am)\n\nWhere: Warehouse421, Abu Dhabi\n\nThe Al Burda Festival is a celebration of Islamic art and culture, featuring talks, performances and exhibitions. Organised by the Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development, this one-day event opens with a session on the future of Islamic art. With this in mind, it is followed by a number of workshops and “masterclass” sessions in everything from calligraphy and typography to geometry and the origins of Islamic design. There will also be discussions on subjects including ‘Who is the Audience for Islamic Art?’ and ‘New Markets for Islamic Design.’ A live performance from Kuwaiti guitarist Yousif Yaseen should be one of the highlights of the day."
