The directive comes as the drug is yet to receive approval from the regulatory authority. As several manufacturers have been found producing and distributing this drug combination. Classified as a 'New Drug,' it has not secured the necessary regulatory approval. The drug is offered at a price of around ‚Çπ2,000 per dose. It is marketed with claims of inhibiting the formation of bacterial cell walls thus, used in the treatment of a variety of infections, including meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections. ü¶† #DCGI #Revoke #cdsco #Stopusing #India #Antibiotics #Meropenem #DisodiumEDTA #Infections #treatments\n\nAntibiotics are prevalent in how organisms deal with diseases via bacterial infections. Revolutionary. Antibiotic resistance is now ever relevant due to the overuse and abuse of these life saving drugs. I would love to delve more into this in the future, especially with the guarantee of new and emerging drugs and diseases.

Just in time for Winter After extensive deliberations, a panel of 16 advisors has delivered a unanimous verdict: Phenylephrine, a common ingredient in many over-the-counter cold medicines, is no more effective than a placebo. This decision has far-reaching implications for the pharmaceutical world. üö´ Is Phenylephrine's Reign Over? üö´ The FDA now faces a pivotal choice: Should products containing Phenylephrine, including well-known brands like BENADRYL, Mucinex, SUDAFED, and Tylenol Co, continue to grace our shelves, or is it time for a change? üîç A Closer Look at the Panel's Decision üîç The #FDA advisory panel's resounding vote has set the stage for potential reformulations and the removal of countless products from stores. However, it's important to note that agency decisions may take time, and popular products could temporarily vanish as companies adapt. üõí Your Medicine Cabinet and the Future üõí While this decision might leave you wondering about your trusty cold and flu remedies, experts advise against panic. Although Phenylephrine may not be the hero we thought it was, these medicines still contain other active ingredients to alleviate your symptoms. üåê Stay Informed and Connected! üåê #pharma #business #africa #middleeast #US #europe #pharmaceuticalindustry #healthcare #globalhealth #PharmaIndustry #PharmaCommunity #HealthcareProfessionals #Pharmaceuticals #GlobalHealth #PharmaIndustry #MedicalAdvancements #StayInformed #ConnectWithUs #fda #usa #cold #otc #drugsafety #drugs\n\n*FDCs under scanner* The central drug regulator has asked companies manufacturing two commonly prescribed cough and cold medications and available in fixed dose combinations (FDCs), which have been on sale for more than 30 years, to carry out trials to review their safety and efficacy. FDC refers to combining two or more drugs in a fixed ratio to develop a single dosage form. One of the cough and cold medications suggested for a fresh trial to assess safety includes drugs containing Paracetamol (antipyretic), Phenylephrine Hydrochloride (nasal decongestant) and Caffeine Anhydrous (processed caffeine)FDCs are justified when they demonstrate clear benefits in terms of potentiating the therapeutic efficacy, reducing the incidence of adverse effects of drugs, better compliance by reducing the pill burden and decreasing development of resistance among others.( Courtesy TOI) #fdcs #safety #efficacy #cough #cold #antipyretic #nasaldecongestant #caffeine #fixeddosecombinations\n\ncombination antibiotics .....there are many brands available e.g. amoxycillin + cloxacillin etc. one can search on Google easily... similarly, there are many other FDCs marketed in this country which are not available in stringent regulated countries......... combining two old drugs are defined as \"new drug\" and accordingly regulatory approvals were given under erstwhile schedule - Y of Drug Rule ......by DCGI. there are certain FDC s approved directly by some State Drugs control as well. ........ One of the recommendations of the 90th DTAB Sub - group was to take steps to ban inappropriate antibiotic combinations in the market. Let's see what exactly going to happen ???\n\nWhen antibiotic waste is released into rivers and waterways it can fuel #AntimicrobialResistance. To limit the impact of antibiotic manufacturing on #AMR, #pharma companies need to set limits on the concentration of antibiotic residue that can be present in manufacturing wastewater. Our 2021 AMR Benchmark found that 12 out of 17 companies in the scope apply discharge limits for #antibiotic waste at their own manufacturing sites. Additionally, of the 163 companies‚Äô own manufacturing sites, more than half were reported as compliant with discharge limits.
