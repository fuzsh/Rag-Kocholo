        "text": "Sir, more than kisses, letters mingle Soules;\n\nFor, thus friends absent speak.\n\nJohn Donne, To Sir Henry Wotton\n\nوکم من فراق کان قرباًحقیقة\n\nوکم من فراق کان للوصل جالباً\n\nShah Wali Allah to Muhammad Ashiq Phulati\n\nShortly after Ramazān in 1165 (August 1752), the great Islamic reformer of eighteenth-century Delhi, Shah Wali Allah (d. 1762), wrote to his closest disciple and brother-in-law Muhammad Ashiq Phulati (d. 1773) to inform him that he had nearly finished a draft of his Persian commentary on Hizb al-bahr, an apotropaic text written by the Maghribī Sufi, Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili (d. 1258).Footnote 1 The commentary had been written during the intense 40-day period of seclusion, fasting, and prayer that Wali Allah undertook every year. He wrote the text following a waking vision in which the face of Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili, pale and sparsely bearded, had appeared to him like a flash of lightning. In the vision, Wali Allah had been ‘placed in the spiritual station’ of al-Shadhili and was given access to knowledge previously disclosed only to him.Footnote 2 In the letter, Wali Allah mentions, almost in passing, that once the draft was finished, he would have another disciple produce a fair copy (mubayyaz sāzand) and that this would then be sent to Muhammad Ashiq (firistāda khwāhad shud) in Phulat, a village some 60 miles north-east of the imperial capital.Footnote 3\n\nGiven that historians of pre-modern Islamic learning in South Asia have long argued for the centrality of the oral transmission of texts, what is notable here is not Wali Allah's claim to rarefied spiritual states but that he considered it completely unexceptional to send a newly written book to his disciple without the need for a face-to-face meeting.Footnote 4 This was not a one-off: the practice of sending books to trusted disciples by means of privately hired messengers (qāsids) and other intermediaries, often over vast distances, is mentioned repeatedly in Wali Allah's letters and those of his circle but, perhaps because of the routine way it is discussed in primary sources, it has received little scholarly attention.Footnote 5 These remotely transmitted books included works of tasawwuf and metaphysics, as well as logic, philosophy, Quranic commentaries, and poetry.Footnote 6 Collections of letters of this time also reveal that multi-volume hadith works, the genre most commonly understood as reliant on various modes of oral/aural transmission, were sometimes sent by mail.Footnote 7 It should not surprise us, then, that one of the earliest extant manuscripts of Wali Allah's masterpiece on the ‘secrets of hadith’, Hujjat Allāh al-bāligha, was originally commissioned by his son Abd al-Aziz (d. 1822) and sent to the scion of an illustrious scholarly family in Lucknow in 1799 along with other books of various genres.Footnote 8 Although this article primarily focuses on Shah Wali Allah's inner circle, references to the remote exchanges of books of various genres are found in a range of late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Naqshbandi epistolographic sources.Footnote 9 The evidence that we have for these exchanges, primarily in the form of brief remarks in letters, is necessarily fragmentary and we cannot enumerate with any precision the scale of such practices. Nevertheless, in an environment where private, silent reading was a significant feature of intellectual life, the routine nature of these remote exchanges suggests the limitations of models of textual transmission in Islamicate South Asia that exclusively focus on questions of oral transmission in the context of extended periods of face-to-face companionship between teacher and student.Footnote 10\n\nThis willingness to transmit books remotely should be seen in a broader context in which we see an intensification of long-distance communication among South Asian Sufis affiliated with various Sufi ways (tarīqas).Footnote 11 Questioning the notion that the adoption of the lithographic press in the early decades of the nineteenth century represented a moment of profound intellectual rupture, Nile Green has argued that the eighteenth century witnessed a broad transition from an Islamic epistemology rooted in embodied practices towards one of private textual study.Footnote 12 He argues that the increased bureaucratisation and centralisation of the state in the late-Mughal period was a major catalyst for ‘the transformation of bodily into bookish knowledge, of corporeal and oral knowledge into the written record’.Footnote 13\n\nThis article accepts the idea that embodied intellectual practices began attenuating long before the widespread adoption of print. At the same time, it suggests that the Naqshbandi networks’ embrace of remote transmission of knowledge did not simply stem from imperial bureaucratisation.Footnote 14 On the one hand, the political volatility of the eighteenth century appears to have rendered remote transmission of knowledge more attractive. Letters from this period include numerous complaints about the dangers of travel as well as the declining availability of patronage that would have made possible lengthy sojourns in distant cities.Footnote 15 But, in addition, we must also take into account intellectual trends that played a central role in this transformation. While scholars in these networks were aware that their practices differed from idealised norms of face-to-face communication, they made sense of their practices by drawing on long-standing Sufi epistemological and psychological theories about the relationship between the material and non-material aspects of self.Footnote 16 These scholars would not, for example, have accepted the idea that the increasing willingness to send books by courier represented a shift from ‘anthropocentric’ to ‘bibliocentric’ modes of knowledge transmission.Footnote 17 Rather, their writings challenge the idea that person-to-person transmission relies on the physical proximity of two individuals because, in their view, a ‘person’ is not merely, or even primarily, a material entity bounded by a corporeal (living) body.Footnote 18\n\nIn decoupling personhood from bodily materiality, Wali Allah and others in his circle argued that companionship did not necessarily require the coming together of two gross material bodies but was, in its ideal form, the communion of two spirits.Footnote 19 As a result, face-to-face companionship and letter writing were not completely distinct modes of communication. Rather, both served as the means for creating and invigorating bonds between the spirits (arwāh, sing. rūh) of two individuals. As with their contemporaries in early modern Europe, they felt that letters could substitute for conversations and were thus, in Dena Goodman's memorable phrase, ‘an absence made present’.Footnote 20 Generally, these figures argued that bodily proximity was more efficacious—it was, after all, commonly said that ‘written correspondence is equal to half a meeting (al-mukātabāt nisf al-mulāqāt)’.Footnote 21 In certain cases, however, they claim epistolography to be superior to face-to-face companionship as an exchange of letters might make perceptible the spiritual traces of the writers while circumventing the sensuous materiality of bodies.Footnote 22 And while speech and writing were generally a necessary means for generating companionship between two spirits, two individuals whose spirits were predisposed to harmonious union could, in certain circumstances, commune over vast distances (and even times) without any external aids at all.\n\nTaking the small and close-knit circle of Shah Wali Allah as a case study, this article investigates the implications of this novel early modern theoretical framework on epistolographic practices. It shows that because scholars understood letters exchanged between trusted friends and disciples as a form of spiritual companionship, they were willing to circulate draft manuscripts as well as finished books, send one another authorisations to transmit texts, and even work on long-distance collaborative book projects. In so doing, it suggests that historians must consider the embedded and contextual nature of reading practices of particular socio-textual communities in pre-colonial India.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy focusing closely on the practices of a small group of scholars, albeit a highly important and influential one, we are able to see that older models of textual transmission that rely on a simple binary between oral and written cultures do not capture the complex particularities of knowledge circulation among Muslim intellectuals of pre-colonial eighteenth-century India. This article has shown that a prominent circle of eighteenth-century Naqshbandis was perfectly willing to engage in modes of textual transmission that seem to diverge from classical protocols of face-to-face oral transmission. The psychological and spiritual theoretical framework in which members of this circle operated explains their willingness to engage in these practices. Because spirits could commune across physical time and space, the need for face-to-face transmission became obsolete in certain cases.\n\nWe cannot, however, conflate the remote transmission of texts within these networks with the anonymity of print culture. The idea of person-to-person transmission remained important, and texts were circulated within close-knit networks of trust based on intellectual and spiritual attainment. In order to understand what changed in the transition to print cultures of the nineteenth century, it is crucial to recognise both the continuities and ruptures that this transition produced within the various and contextually specific manuscript cultures that flourished in Islamicate early modernity."
