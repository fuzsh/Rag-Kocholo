        "text": "Home / Sections / Islamic Movement\n\nSection: Islamic Movement\n\nShowing 1-20 of 247\n\nThe Role Of Ulama In Society: South Africa’s Case\n\nMohamed Ousman\n\nMuharram 26, 14462024-08-01\n\nThe ulama are supposed to be successors to the Prophet. They can only perform this role if they follow the teachings of the Qur’an and the Prophetic Sunnah and Seerah. If they follow taghuti powers for short-term worldly gains, they betray the trust of the masses.\n\nThe Islamic Movement: Rebuilding The Trust\n\nMohamed Ousman\n\nMuharram 26, 14462024-08-01\n\nThe Islamic movement is the natural platform to pursue and advance the Islamic agenda in all spheres of life: political, social and economic. It needs the building of trust but this will not be possible if Muslims play politics with Allah’s Deen.\n\nWomen’s Leadership\n\nImran Khan\n\nDhu al-Qa'dah 24, 14452024-06-01\n\nThere is a tendency among some Muslims to misinterpret the role of women in society. This is based on a misreading of a Prophetic hadith and ignoring the teachings of the Qur’an. Islam does not prohibit women in leadership roles.\n\nWhere Towing The Line Of Deviant Powers Ends Up\n\nImran Khan\n\nShawwal 22, 14452024-05-01\n\nWhen some Muslims mention power, they only think in terms of human beings having power on earth. Allah is not part of their thinking. This leads them to deviant behaviour and results in endless suffering here as well as the punishment of Allah in the hereafter.\n\nConfident Leadership Or Israeli Zig-zagging?\n\nImran Khan\n\nShawwal 22, 14452024-05-01\n\nMuslims today suffer from the “Israeli mentality” that the noble Qur’an describes (2:47). This has to do with the characteristics of a leader. Just like the Bani Israel, Muslims think of a person qualified to be leader who has wealth and the means. This explains the Muslims’ plight today.\n\nMuslim Leaders And Leadership Traits\n\nImran Khan\n\nRamadan 22, 14452024-04-01\n\nWhat qualifies a person to assume leadership position among Muslims? Knowledge is necessary but not sufficient. Qualities such as sense of justice, self-sacrifice, care for Muslims and the oppressed people around him are also required to fulfill the responsibilities of leadership.\n\nJurisprudence For Minority Communities Is Pastime\n\nImran Khan\n\nRamadan 22, 14452024-04-01\n\nGiven the domination of un-Islamic systems in the world, Muslims have fallen into an inferior complex syndrome trying to fit within it. Muslims must turn to the divine message (the Qur’an) and the Prophetic Sunnah and Seerah to establish our position in life.\n\nMuslims And Their Mother Teresa NGOs\n\nImran Khan\n\nSha'ban 20, 14452024-03-01\n\nSome of the leading charities in the world are run by Muslims. While Islam encourages giving charity, there must be a context. Mass suffering, death, destruction and displacement have increased. It is imperative to understand why and how to prevent these recurring disasters.\n\nElections: Avoiding The Lesser And Greater Evils\n\nImran Khan\n\nSha'ban 20, 14452024-03-01\n\nMuslims living as minorities in non-Muslim societies are caught on the horns of a dilemma. The choice is always between the lesser of the two evils. This is an illusion. Muslims should open a debate among themselves and non-Muslims that follow the scripture to chalk out a way forward based on Divine guidance.\n\nBeware Of False Scholars Promoting American Islam\n\nSalina Khan\n\nRajab 20, 14452024-02-01\n\nMuslims continue to be confused by Imams that promote American Islam. It is not by following this brand of Islam but by remaining faithful to teachings of the Qur’an and the Prophetic Sunnah that Muslims will make progress.\n\nCorrect Understanding Of The Role Of Ulul Amr Essential\n\nSalina Khan\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 17, 14452023-12-01\n\nUlul amr is an important Islamic concept. Its correct understanding is essential in order to understand who qualifies to be called ulul amr.\n\nLand Ownership: The Islamic Movement Perspective\n\nImran Khan\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 17, 14452023-12-01\n\nThe question of land ownership lies at the root of most conflicts in the world. In North America, the European settler colonialists were highly successful in decimating the indigenous population. In South Africa, Black racism is driving its policies disregarding the rights of other people.\n\nMuslims In South Africa: The Islamic Movement Perspective\n\nImran Khan\n\nRabi' al-Thani 17, 14452023-11-01\n\nMost Muslims in South Africa and around the world have a positive view of the African National Congress-led government. The reality is very different. It is time to have a more realistic assessment of the ANC and see its Black African nationalism for what it is: racism.\n\nDr. Kalim Siddiqui: His life And Thought\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRamadan 10, 14442023-04-01\n\nThe late Dr Kalim Siddiqui was an intellectual and activist. This month marks 27 years since he passed away on April 18, 1996. His legacy lives on in such institutions as the Institute of Contemporary Islamic Thought and Crescent International.\n\nNew, Distinctive Translation Of The Noble Qur’an (Re-print)\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 09, 14442023-03-01\n\nEvery Muslim has deep attachment to the noble Qur’an. In Ramadan, Muslims intensify their reading of the noble Book. It is, however, meant to be understood to implement its teachings in life. The new, contemporary translation by Imam Muhammad al Asi will help them achieve this objective.\n\nIslamic Movements and Elections in the Muslim World\n\nAyman Ahmed\n\nJumada' al-Akhirah 19, 14422021-02-01\n\nAmong many trouble spots in the world, two stand out: Kashmir and Palestine. People in both locales face a ruthless enemy hell-bent on wiping out their identity. The people of Kashmir have been struggling for their basic rights for more than 70 years. They need our support.\n\nUmrah: Journey in Time for Spiritual Elevation\n\nHayy Yaqzan\n\nSha'ban 07, 14412020-04-01\n\nFor most Muslims, Umrah is a ritual that they perform without realizing its broader significance. Our Editorial Board member narrates a very different experience that should give everyone food for thought.\n\nClarity of Thought Essential for Muslims\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Awwal 04, 14412019-11-01\n\nThat Muslims are undergoing much suffering is well known. How to change this grim reality is the real challenge. Unless Muslims begin to think within the framework of Islamic principles, they will not achieve the result they desire.\n\nWhat if Muslims Liberated the Haramayn?\n\nYusuf Dhia-Allah\n\nRabi' al-Awwal 04, 14412019-11-01\n\nMost Muslims are unhappy with the Saudi occupation of the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah but they do not know how to change the situation. We speculate on what could happen if three countries were to take action…"
