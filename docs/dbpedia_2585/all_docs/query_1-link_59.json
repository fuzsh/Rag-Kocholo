        "text": "Works\n\nOpinion\n\nIsrael Defeated in Gaza\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nMuharram 26, 14462024-08-01\n\nIsrael has not only been defeated militarily but also suffered political and geostrategic defeat in Gaza. The mass slaughter of Palestinian civilians merely reflects its frustration.\n\nOpinion\n\nAsserting The Political Power Of Islam\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Hijjah 24, 14452024-07-01\n\nDespite the indescribable suffering inflicted on the Palestinian people, Islam’s political power is re-emerging in the world. It is this rise that terrifies the zionists and imperialists. Committed Muslims are changing the political dynamics of the world.\n\nOpinion\n\nChallenges In Early Islamic History\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Qa'dah 24, 14452024-06-01\n\nMuslims faced two serious internal challenges in early Islamic history: one from the group called the munafiqeen and the other from the tulaqa (amnestied prisoners). They both caused immense damage to the body-politic of Islam. Muslims must understand this history properly.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nHajj And The Plight Of The Palestinian People\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Qa'dah 24, 14452024-06-01\n\nHajj is an important pillar of Islam and the largest assembly of the Ummah. Yet under the control of Bani Saud, it has been reduced to empty rituals. Discussion of burning issues like the plight of the Palestinians facing the zionist onslaught is strictly forbidden. Why?\n\nOpinion\n\nFrom Wahhabism To Hedonism: MbS’ Idea Of ‘Reforms’\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nShawwal 22, 14452024-05-01\n\nThe Bani Saud-occupied Arabian Peninsula was in the past known for its rigid Wahhabism creating much conflict in the Muslim world. Since MbS’ ascension to power, he has gone to the other extreme: vulgarity and nakedness.\n\nMain Stories\n\nLessons From The Liberation Of Makkah\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRamadan 22, 14452024-04-01\n\nMuslims liberated Makkah from the clutches of the mushrikeen in the 8th year of the Hijrah. The Ka‘aba was cleansed of its idols. What led to the Muslims’ march on Makkah that the Prophet (pbuh) led and what lessons we can draw today from this momentous event from Islamic history?\n\nOpinion\n\nDr Kalim Siddiqui: His Life, Thought And Legacy\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRamadan 22, 14452024-04-01\n\nDr Kalim Siddiqui was a towering figure in the eighties and nineties. He was far ahead of his time. The ideas he propounded as early as the 1970s are not only still relevant but also necessary to extricate the Muslim world from its present predicament.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nPakistan’s Unending Dilemma\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRamadan 22, 14452024-04-01\n\nThough seldom stable, Pakistan is currently undergoing a very serious crisis that is political, economic and ideological. The over-bearing military, especially a few generals at the top, have exacerbated these problems. The country’s very survival is at stake.\n\nOpinion\n\nRamadan & The Noble Qur’an\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 20, 14452024-03-01\n\nQur’an recital is common during Ramadan. Understanding the noble Book is even more important. Toward this end, the ICT has produced an ‘English only’ version with simplified expressions. Imam Muhammad al Asi is the translator. We urge readers to get a copy as well as gift it to non-Muslim friends. Join the caravan to promote Qur’anic understanding.\n\nOpinion\n\nFrom The Trench Of Al-Ahzab To The Tunnels Of Gaza\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 20, 14452024-02-01\n\nThe tunnels in Gaza have proved a very effective means of confronting the zionist invaders of Gaza. The Palestinian Islamic resistance has inflicted significant damage on the zionists. It has striking parallels with the trench the Muslims dug in Madinah as defence mechanism in the Battle of Ahzab.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nIran’s Assembly Of Experts Elections May Prove Crucial For Its future\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 20, 14452024-02-01\n\nThe Assembly of Experts is a very important institution in Iran. It will hold elections on March 1. This election is crucial because the new assembly may have to elect a new Rahbar (Leader) of the Islamic revolution.\n\nReflections\n\nPakistan’s Not So Honourable Judges\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Akhirah 19, 14452024-01-01\n\nFar from delivering justice, judges in Pakistan, taking their orders from the thuggish generals, are punishing innocent people. They have sunk to new a low. If there is no justice, there will be no peace in Pakistan.\n\nMain Stories\n\nMuslims’ Responsibility To Protect Masjid Al-Aqsa\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 17, 14452023-12-01\n\nMasjid al-Aqsa is the first qibla of Muslims. It is under serious threat of zionist zealots that want to demolish it build their mythical third temple. While the Palestinians are in the forefront of defending it, Muslims worldwide must also assume their responsibility for its defence.\n\nOpinion\n\nPalestine And The Administration Of The Haramayn\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 17, 14452023-12-01\n\nThe Saudis have not only occupied the Haramayn (Makkah and al-Madinah), their court preachers even prevent people from praying for the Palestinians subjected to zionist barbarism. Pilgrims have been arrested for wearing the kaffiyeh. The Haramayn must be liberated from the clutches of the Saudis.\n\nOpinion\n\nPakistan’s Army-led Political Farce Continues\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Thani 17, 14452023-11-01\n\nPakistani politics are a farce. Despite its immense potential, the country is on the verge of bankruptcy. The army refuses to allow a normal political process to continue. The men in khaki have messed up the country since its creation and are running it into the ground.\n\nOpinion\n\nSaudi-Israel Normalization Unlikely To Materialize\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Awwal 16, 14452023-10-01\n\nAmid the US-Israel generated hype about normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia, the plan does not seem to be heading for fruition any time soon. Whether the Saudis will be able hold out on their demands, however, is a caveat. Only time will tell whether it succeeds.\n\nOpinion\n\nBroader Dimensions Of the Seerah\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSafar 15, 14452023-09-01\n\nThat Muslims have deep love for the noble Messenger (pbuh) is not in doubt. How this is expressed varies greatly among Muslims. It is important to understand the broader dimensions of the Seerah, in particular his acquisition and use of power to establish justice in society.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nTrapped In Mental Slavery\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSafar 15, 14452023-09-01\n\nTrue freedom starts with breaking the chains of mental slavery. Unfortunately, most Muslim states, barring a few exceptions have not made that transition.\n\nOpinion\n\nImam Hussain’s Struggle And Martyrdom\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nMuharram 14, 14452023-08-01\n\nMuslims throughout the world commemorate the Day of Ashura when Imam Hussain and his entire family were martyred in the plains of Karbala. The struggle between Haqq and batil is waged daily in countless ways, big and small. Muslims must decide which side they are on.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nNew Mosque And Halal Food Industry In Cuba\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nMuharram 14, 14452023-08-01\n\nCuba, the tiny Caribbean country, has a population of only 11 million, of which about 10,000 are Muslim, mostly indigenous. Under US sanctions for 60 years, Cuba has helped other countries in the medical field. It is also opening a new mosque and Halaal food business to cater to Muslims, indigenous as well as visitors.\n\nMain Stories\n\nCan Aid-dependent Countries Claim To Be Independent?\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Hijjah 13, 14442023-07-01\n\nMost countries, especially Muslim countries, cannot be considered independent since their governments are unable to formulate policies independent of the predatory imperialist powers.\n\nOpinion\n\nIntellectual Challenges Facing Muslims\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Hijjah 13, 14442023-07-01\n\nMost Muslims respond positively to any call for establishing Islamic laws in society. While an average person does not have the capacity to do so, many Muslim intellectuals have also unfortunately fallen under the influence of western thought and are unable to offer direction.\n\nOpinion\n\nHajj: Some Forgotten Qur’anic Injunctions\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Qa'dah 12, 14442023-06-01\n\nHajj is one of the important obligations in Islam. Most Muslims perform it in a mechanical manner without realizing its true import based on the teachings of the Qur’an.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nChina-Russia Trade On Track To Surpass $200 Billion In 2023\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Qa'dah 12, 14442023-06-01\n\nWith the US going berserk by imposing sanctions on China, Russia and a host of other countries, it has led to Moscow and Beijing to deepen their economic and military ties. China-Russia trade has surpassed US-China trade in 2023.\n\nOpinion\n\nDeveloping Taqwa To Cultivate The Islamic Personality\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nShawwal 11, 14442023-05-01\n\nTaqwa is an important concept in Islam. It has much deeper meanings than mere ‘piety’. The just-concluded month of Ramadan was meant to build our taqwa. With Ramadan’s end, our quest for taqwa, however, does not end. There are other routes to achieving taqwa.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe Lessons of Badr\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRamadan 10, 14442023-04-01\n\nThe battle of Badr was an extremely important event in early Islamic history. It was a battle for the very survival of the nascent Muslim community. Because of their strong commitment, the Muslims were able to defeat an enemy force three times larger.\n\nIslamic Movement\n\nDr. Kalim Siddiqui: His life And Thought\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRamadan 10, 14442023-04-01\n\nThe late Dr Kalim Siddiqui was an intellectual and activist. This month marks 27 years since he passed away on April 18, 1996. His legacy lives on in such institutions as the Institute of Contemporary Islamic Thought and Crescent International.\n\nOpinion\n\nTime To Abandon Colonial Geography\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 09, 14442023-03-01\n\nWestern colonialism has inflicted immense damage on the lives of most people in Asia and Africa. Even geography has been colonized. Thus, meaningless labels like the ‘Middle East’ and ‘Far East’ have been coined to describe regions of the world to suit their purpose. Such distorted labels must be discarded.\n\nIslamic Movement\n\nNew, Distinctive Translation Of The Noble Qur’an (Re-print)\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 09, 14442023-03-01\n\nEvery Muslim has deep attachment to the noble Qur’an. In Ramadan, Muslims intensify their reading of the noble Book. It is, however, meant to be understood to implement its teachings in life. The new, contemporary translation by Imam Muhammad al Asi will help them achieve this objective.\n\nMain Stories\n\nIslamic Iran Resists Western Threats, Sabotage And Aggression\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 10, 14442023-02-01\n\nSince the victory of the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran has been subjected to incessant attacks, sabotage, bombings, assassination of its top leaders as well as a full-fledged war imposed through Iraq. Despite these challenges, Islamic Iran has survived and thrived. We explain how.\n\nOpinion\n\nAll The King’s Preachers\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 10, 14442023-02-01\n\nWhy do kings and other potentates whose rule is clearly un-Islamic insist on having court preachers on their payroll? The court preachers play an important in providing a veneer of Islamicity, and therefore, legitimacy where none exists, to these rulers.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nThe Significance of Al-Isra Wal Mi‘raj\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 10, 14442023-02-01\n\nThis year the event of Al-Isra wal Mi’raj falls on February 17-18. We look at the long struggle and suffering that culminated in this miraculous event in the life of the Prophet (pbuh).\n\nOpinion\n\nWill Pakistan Survive?\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Akhirah 08, 14442023-01-01\n\nPakistan has been in the grip of an unending political crisis that has badly damaged its economy. A syndicate of criminals and gangsters has taken the country hostage with no prospects in sight to resolve the crisis. It has put the very survival of the state at risk.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nTurkey’s Future In The Post-Erdogan Era\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Akhirah 08, 14442023-01-01\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan has been in power for more than 20 years. He assumes that Turkey cannot function without his wisdom guiding the country’s affairs. Empirical evidence proves otherwise. Erdogan’s foreign policy has been erratic and he has ruined the economy.\n\nOpinion\n\nChanging Patterns Of Warfare\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 07, 14442022-12-01\n\nThroughout history, human beings have been involved in wars. The last century was particularly brutal. The patterns of war, however, seem to be changing and those at a disadvantage are fast catching up with developments in latest technology.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nDecember 16, 1971: The Day Of Infamy In Pakistan’s History\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 07, 14442022-12-01\n\nMost people in Pakistan would rather not remember the humiliating surrender of 90,000 Pakistani troops to the invading Indian army in December 1971 but those terrible days need to be recalled to discuss how the country ended up in that terrible situation and who was responsible.\n\nOpinion\n\nStruggling For Justice In The Age Of Oppression\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Thani 06, 14442022-11-01\n\nJustice is an important concept in Islam. It is also often touted at the global level but regrettably, there is little justice in the world. The rich and powerful exploit the poor and weak. There is no system whereby people can seek redress for injustices inflicted on them.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nCan More Weapons Arrest America’s Decline In Global Politics?\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Thani 06, 14442022-11-01\n\nUS President Joe Biden’s National Security Strategy document identifies three principal enemies: China, Russia and Iran, in that order. His prescription: to acquire more weapons, to terrorize opponents into submission. This did not work in the past and is not likely to succeed in the future.\n\nMain Stories\n\nSCO Samarqand Summit Heralds Tectonic Shift In Global Politics\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Awwal 05, 14442022-10-01\n\nThe SCO summit held in Samarqand, Uzbekistan on September 15-16, was a major event that has ushered in major changes on the world stage. It served notice that the global economic and political balance of power has shifted to Eurasia, away from the unipolar US-led world order.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe Transformative Power Of The Seerah\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Awwal 05, 14442022-10-01\n\nSince the Seerah is central to the ethos of Muslim life, it must be properly understood beyond the aspects of rituals. There is need to look at in its broader context as a process of transformation.\n\nReflections\n\nFirst Anniversary of My Mother’s Departure from This Dunya\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSafar 05, 14442022-09-01\n\nEvery child, young or old, knows how special mothers are. Allah mentions their special place in the noble Qur’an (31:14). The Prophet (pbuh) has said that Paradise lies at the feet of the mothers. On the first anniversary of his mother’s passing away, ICIT director narrates some details about his mother’s life and the unusual events that have occurred since her departure.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nIs JCPOA’s Revival On The Cards?\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSafar 05, 14442022-09-01\n\nRecent media reports suggest that the parties to the JCPOA are moving toward its revival. The US had unilaterally walked out of the deal, repudiating its own signature, and even imposed additional sanctions on Iran. We look at the various options.\n\nMain Stories\n\nPakistan’s Unending Political Crisis\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nMuharram 03, 14442022-08-01\n\nAmong states, Pakistan seems to be particularly unfortunate. Each time it is on the verge of stabilizing politically and economically, vested interests disrupt the process bringing to power criminals and murderers. This is what is being witnessed today.\n\nOpinion\n\nA Tale of Two Summits\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nMuharram 03, 14442022-08-01\n\nLast month there were two summits: one in Jeddah on July 16 and the other in Tehran on July 19. In the first, Joe Bident tried to cajole Arabian regimes back into US subservience but failed. In the second, Iran, Russia and Turkey struck a bold new vision for the future.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nDisastrous Consequences of Military Rule in Pakistan\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nMuharram 03, 14442022-08-01\n\nOf all the institutions of state, the military is the most powerful in Pakistan. Regrettably, it has interfered in politics since the very beginning even though it played no part in the creation of Pakistan. We examine its disastrous role in civil affairs.\n\nMain Stories\n\nPakistan: How Not to Run the Affairs of State\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Hijjah 02, 14432022-07-01\n\nPakistan’s political crisis has led to a deep economic paralysis of the country. It is being pushed into default. For personal ambition and power, people are literally destroying the country. The only solution lies in changing the entire system that is thoroughly corrupt and has not served the interests of the people since Pakistan came into existence.\n\nOpinion\n\nSaudis Impose New Restrictions on Hajj\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Hijjah 02, 14432022-07-01\n\nWhile only a million pilgrims will be allowed to perform Hajj this year—an improvement on the last two years—the Saudis have sourced out the system to a Hindu fascist outfit. It will be a “lottery” system, akin to gambling. This is forbidden in Islam. Saudi policies clearly show they are unfit to administer the affairs of Hajj.\n\nOpinion\n\nMuslims Should Assert Their Position in The Multipolar World Order\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Qa'dah 01, 14432022-06-01\n\nThe demise of the US-led unipolar world order is crumbling before our eyes. A multipolar world order is emerging. Muslims must strive to find their rightful place in this emerging new order since it is largely through their sacrifices that America’s military machine has been defeated.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nPakistan’s Engineered Political Crisis\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Qa'dah 01, 14432022-06-01\n\nPakistan has been engulfed in a political crisis orchestrated from Washington DC, operating through their local collaborators. The Americans created this crisis because Imran Khan wanted to chart an independent foreign policy while US agents in Pakistan want to remain America’s slaves.\n\nOpinion\n\nPakistan’s ‘Dakoo’ Dynasties\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRamadan 30, 14432022-05-01\n\nPower has once again fallen into the hands of thieves and murderers in Pakistan. This is the direct result of American conspiracy carried out through the support of local collaborators among the politicians, media, judges and the military.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nMassive Rallies in Support of Imran Khan Reflect Pakistan’s New Reality\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRamadan 30, 14432022-05-01\n\nDespite his ouster from power, former prime minister Imran Khan continues to attract very large numbers of people to his rallies that support his call for true independence, free from American interference and the corrupt practices of various mafias in Pakistan.\n\nBook Review\n\nSenior Bureaucrat Offers Insights into State Institutions in Pakistan\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRamadan 30, 14432022-05-01\n\nA senior Pakistani bureaucrat, now retired from service, offers interesting insights into the workings of state institutions. While the book offers great insights, it also exposes the dysfunctional nature of the Pakistani political system.\n\nOpinion\n\nNew and Distinctive Translation of the Noble Qur’an\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 29, 14432022-04-01\n\nAs Muslims begin another month of fasting in Ramadan, they should turn to the noble Qur’an for guidance. A new, distinctive contemporary translation by Imam Muhammad al-Asi would help them understand its pristine message much better.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nThe Depressing State of Politics in Pakistan\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 29, 14432022-04-01\n\nPolitics is a dirty game but in Pakistan, politicians are in a class of their own. With no ideological commitment, they are in politics to make money and are willing to sell themselves for a shoulder of mutton. This is what is underway at present in an attempt to oust Prime Minister Imran Khan.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe Broader Dimensions of the Seerah\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 29, 14432022-04-01\n\nIt is important for Muslims to consider the totality of the Seerah of the noble Messenger (pbuh) and not look at it anecdotally. Establishing the Islamic State in Madinah was a very important part of the Prophetic Seerah. This is the goal that Muslims must strive for if they want to live the message of the Qur’an fully.\n\nOpinion\n\nAttempts to Secularize Islam Continue\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 28, 14432022-03-01\n\nThat the imperialists would want to undermine Islam and its pristine values is understandable even if unacceptable but what should one make of Muslims that deliberately distort Islam’s teachings. Their assault on the necessity of establishing the Islamic State is part of this dangerous project.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\n‘Civilized’ Barbarians\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 28, 14432022-03-01\n\nColonialism was of two kinds: one in which the European colonial powers occupied other peoples’ land for plunder and ultimately returned home. The second was permanent occupation such as in North America, Australia and New Zealand. This necessitated the genocide of indigenous people. We examine the Europeans’ genocide of Native peoples in North America.\n\nMain Stories\n\nIran, China, Russia in Strategic Alliance to Neutralize US\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Akhirah 29, 14432022-02-01\n\nAlmost back-to-back meetings between Iranian officials and their Chinese and Russian counterparts provide a solid foundation for confronting US and its allies’ belligerence, threats and sanctions. There is a convergence of views on neutralizing Washington’s destructive policies\n\nOpinion\n\nDealing with India’s Hindutva Problem\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Akhirah 29, 14432022-02-01\n\nHindutva ideology (not to be confused with Hindu religion) is based on hatred and violence. Its ideologues openly call for genocide of Muslims. To deal with this hate-filled ideology, India needs to undergo some geographical surgery. India is an artificial state and such changes would usher peace in the region.\n\nMain Stories\n\nSecond Martyrdom Anniversary of General Haj Qassem Soleimani\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 28, 14432022-01-01\n\nThe martyr, General Haj Qassem Soleimani was a brilliant strategist, an outstandingly daring general and the bane of terrorists and imperialists. He was the victim of Donald Trump’s terrorist attack which almost all legal experts agree was a war crime. Trump must be held accountable and tried as a war criminal.\n\nOpinion\n\nUS Starving Afghan Children to Deliver Democracy!\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 28, 14432022-01-01\n\nThat the US lost the war in Afghanistan is not in doubt. Unfortunately, it is not done yet and continues to inflict more harm on the Afghan people, this time through starving the most vulnerable: children and women. It reconfirms US rulers as mass murderers and war criminals.\n\nOpinion\n\nSaudi Regime’s Arbitrary Restrictions on Hajj and Umrah\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Thani 26, 14432021-12-01\n\nEvery Saudi policy relating to Hajj or Umrah is not only against the tenets of Islam but also a disaster for the Muslim Ummah. The Saudis’ latest restrictions allowing pilgrims of only 18-60 years age to perform Umrah is completely idiotic.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nDarwin’s Monkeys\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Thani 26, 14432021-12-01\n\nWas Darwin right about the origins of species? Are human beings the descendants of chimpanzees, as he claims?

Like all oppressors and terrorists, they attempt to deflect attention from their horrific crimes by conflating criticism of their conduct with that of Hinduism as a religion.

The latest escalation was the provocative visit of General Joseph Votel, head of US Central Command, to northern Syria without the permission of the Syrian government.\n\nIslamic Movement\n\nWhy Islam prohibits riba (usury) and encourages sadaqah\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 25, 14372016-06-01\n\nRiba (usury) has taken hold of global finance. Its purpose is to enrich the rich and impoverish the poor. This grand larceny, given legal cover, needs to be understood if humanity is to break free from modern-day slavery.\n\nIslamic Movement\n\nRamadan and the building of taqwa\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 25, 14372016-06-01\n\nRamadan must mean more than going hungry or thirsty for 15-17 hours a day. Muslims must strive to build taqwa, the real purpose of Ramadan. Understanding the true meaning of taqwa is the first step.\n\nEditorials\n\nZionist threats to al-Masjid al-Aqsa\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 25, 14372016-06-01\n\nZionists encroachments and attacks on Masjid al-Aqsa and indeed the entire Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem have become more frequent. Muslims cannot remain indifferent to this threat to the Muslims’ first qibla and third holiest site.\n\nOpinion\n\nSignificance of the Isra’ and Mi‘raj\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 24, 14372016-05-01\n\nIsra wal mi‘raj is an important event in Prophetic history. Muslims must study the events leading to the mi‘raj and what lessons they can derive from them today.\n\nEditorials\n\nWhy peace eludes Syria and Yemen\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 24, 14372016-05-01\n\nThe people of Syria and Yemen would want nothing better than peace but foreign powers are determined to continue the mayhem with tragic loss of life.\n\nEditorials\n\nPanama papers and the thieving rich\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 24, 14372016-05-01\n\nThe world is held hostage by oligarchs whose sole purpose in life is to further enrich themselves, as the Panama papers once again reveal. The big question is what can the rest of us do.\n\n1\n\nIslamic Movement\n\nIn memory of Dr. Kalim Siddiqui\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 24, 14372016-05-01\n\nDr. Kalim Siddiqui, the great Islamic scholar, visionary and, activist, joined heavenly company on April 18, 1996. This is an abridged version of the welcoming address delivered by ICIT Director Zafar Bangash at the Memorial Conference held for the late scholar in Toronto on April 23.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe language of imperialism - II\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Akhirah 23, 14372016-04-01\n\nThere are two wars going on simultaneously against Muslims: the military war and propaganda war. The imperialists and Zionists not only occupy Muslim lands but they also want to control their minds by manipulating the use of language.\n\nEditorials\n\nReclaiming Islam from the fanatics\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Akhirah 23, 14372016-04-01\n\nFanatics come in all shapes and sizes. There are religious fanatics and then there are secular fanatics. Neither is acceptable. Since Islam has been hijacked by both, it is time for committed Muslims to reclaim it from their clutches.\n\nEditorials\n\nPalestinians betrayed by their own leaders\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Akhirah 23, 14372016-04-01\n\nThere is hardly any sincere person in the world—Muslim or non-Muslim—that does not sympathize with the plight of the long-suffering Palestinians. Their tragedy is that their own leaders have let them down repeatedly.\n\nMain Stories\n\nDr. Kalim Siddiqui: Muslim intellectual and visionary\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Akhirah 23, 14372016-04-01\n\nApril 18 marks the twentieth anniversary of Dr Kalim Siddiqui’s passing away. He was one of the leading intellectuals of the last century blending intellectualism with political activism that created a unique personality.\n\nSpecial Reports\n\nNew global architecture emerges out of ME chaos\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Akhirah 23, 14372016-04-01\n\nMajor changes are underway in global politics as the US-led unipolar world comes to an end. A multipolar world is emerging in which new more robust players are active. Islamic Iran is a central component of this new arrangement.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe age of ignorance\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 21, 14372016-03-01\n\nIgnorance is deliberately bred by ruling elites in order to manipulate people’s emotions. This is especially true in countries that never tire of drum beating about free speech, democracy and the rule of law.\n\nEditorials\n\nMarch — a month of grim anniversaries\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 21, 14372016-03-01\n\nWhile associated with renewal and growth, the month of March brings grim reminder of how terribly movements for change in the Muslim world have been subverted. Leaders of Islamic movements need to pay close attention to their modus operandi.\n\nEditorials\n\nSyria’s five-year-long agony to end?\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 21, 14372016-03-01\n\nWill the February 22 agreement between Russia and the US outlining terms for cessation of hostilities bring peace to Syria?

This is part of a plan to undermine the aspirations of Muslims for legitimacy, justice and peace.\n\n1\n\nOpinion\n\nDangers of sectarianism\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Thani 22, 14372016-02-01\n\nAs if bad governance, gross inequalities and mismanagement were not enough, there are some regimes that are deliberately promoting sectarianism to divide the Muslims.\n\nEditorials\n\nHamas’ dilemma: resistance or surrender?\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Thani 22, 14372016-02-01\n\nIslamic resistance movements operate under very difficult conditions but they must be careful about who they choose as “friends”. Hamas seems to be drifting toward the Saudis that will certainly result in disaster.\n\nEditorials\n\nOIC: an irrelevant laughing stock\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Thani 22, 14372016-02-01\n\nMuch of the Muslim world is mired in serious problems. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is an accurate reflection of the pathetic state of the Ummah as was evident from an “emergency” meeting it held on January 21 at the behest of the Saudis.\n\nMain Stories\n\nThe dying gasps of Bani Saud\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Thani 22, 14372016-02-01\n\nLike Lemmings, the Bani Saud are rushing headlong into the sea toward collective suicide.

This one, however, may prove its undoing. Sheikh Nimr's execution reflects the regime's failures both internally and externally and will only hasten its downfall. The world would be a far better place without this bunch of savages from the backwaters of Najd.\n\nOpinion\n\nAlarming rise in Islamophobia\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Awwal 20, 14372016-01-01\n\nAttacks on Muslims and their institutions have risen alarmingly worldwide, especially in the US.

ICIT director provides some pointers and food for thought.\n\nOpinion\n\nMuslim unity and Unity Week\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSafar 19, 14372015-12-01\n\nThe Prophet’s (pbuh) Sunnah and Sirah are the two fundamental reference points after the noble Qur’an on which all Muslims agree. He is the best of exemplars (33:21) and obedience to him alongside that of Allah (swt) is obligatory upon every Muslim. It is for this reason that Muslims organize elaborate programs to celebrate the birthday of the noble Messenger (pbuh) that falls in the month of Rabi‘ al-Awwal.\n\nEditorials\n\nTurkey: terrorists’ air force and oil terminal\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSafar 19, 14372015-12-01\n\nBy its own actions, Turkey stands exposed as the terrorists’ air force and conduit for shipping their oil to the international market.\n\nEditorials\n\nParis, Saudi camel, and the Zionist monkey!\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSafar 19, 14372015-12-01\n\nAmid all the hype, tough talk and name calling following the Paris attacks, two names are conspicuous by their absence: Wahhabi Arabia and Zionist Israel. The role these two entities play is worth a closer look.\n\nIslamic Movement\n\nThe Apostle’s (pbuh) message and his method\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSafar 19, 14372015-12-01\n\nThe Qur’an is not a biography of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), but Allah (swt) describes His beloved Messenger (pbuh) in the most beautiful terms in the noble Book. He is the “best of exemplars” (33:21), with “the most lofty character” (68:04), and a “mercy to all the worlds” (21:107). He is the one who has “brought glad tidings inviting people to Allah” (33:45) “to bring them out of darkness and into light” (65:11).\n\nOpinion\n\nPalestine, Syria, Yemen and Bani Saud\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nMuharram 19, 14372015-11-01\n\nThe Zionists’ intensified attacks against innocent Palestinians at a time when Bani Saud are doing the same in Syria and Yemen should not surprise us. Palestinians have endured Zionist occupation for nearly 70 years.\n\nEditorials\n\nBani Saud and Bani Isra’il: colonial creations\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nMuharram 19, 14372015-11-01\n\nThe British colonialists have inflicted immense damage on the world of Islam. Nothing, however, compares in destructiveness to the imposition of the two illegiti-mate entities on the holiest places of Islam: the Najdi Bedouins (aka Bani Saud or the House of Saud) in the Arabian Peninsula, especially the Hijaz, and the Zionists in Palestine.\n\nEditorials\n\nThe nature of Western democracy\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nMuharram 19, 14372015-11-01\n\nAfter each election in the West — Barack Obama’s first election as president of the US in 2008, Jeremy Corbyn’s election as leader of the British Labour Party in Au-gust and the recent election of Justin Trudeau as Prime Minister of Canada — much euphoria is generated.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nUS backdoor attempts to sneak into Iran\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nMuharram 19, 14372015-11-01\n\nThe US and its allies in the P5+1 group of countries appear to be dragging their feet in fulfilling their part of the bargain while demanding Iran comply with all its conditions in the nuclear deal. On October 21, the Rahbar, Imam Seyyed Ali Khamenei sent a letter to President Hassan Rouhani pointing this out saying the Islamic Republic’s concessions on the nuclear file were conditional on the other side, especially the US, lifting all sanctions.\n\nAttempts to take down Assad are all about weakening Iran\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Hijjah 21, 14362015-10-05\n\nIn a reply to Abdul Latif Halimi’s recent article on 5Pillars, Zafar Bangash argues that Muslims need to stop deluding themselves and realise that the Syrian conflict is nothing more than an imperial war to take down the Resistance Axis.\n\nMain Stories\n\nHujjaj deaths due to Saudi incompetence\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Hijjah 17, 14362015-10-01\n\nThe Bani Saud have once again shown they are totally incompetent and callous. The horrific deaths of 4,173 pilgrims in Mina on September 24 is proof of their crimes.

The Bani Saud footprint is writ large in both locales...\n\nOpinion\n\nBani Saud unfit to manage Hajj affairs\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Hijjah 17, 14362015-10-01\n\nThe Saudis cannot be left to manage the affairs of Hajj. They are unfit physically and mentally to discharge this great responsibility. It should be taken over by a group of learned scholars backed by properly trained professionals.\n\nOpinion\n\nTerrorists, warmongers, and mules\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Qa'dah 17, 14362015-09-01\n\nThe takfiri terrorists rampaging through the Muslim East (aka the Middle East) and the neocon/Zionist warmongers are two faces of the same coin. They are in fact one and the same entity, only using different labels. True, the takfiris are junior partners in this unholy alliance and are used to provide justification for the warmongers’ end-less wars and mayhem.\n\nEditorials\n\nHajj according to the Qur’an and the Sunnah\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Qa'dah 17, 14362015-09-01\n\nAn estimated two million Muslims from all over the world will perform the annual pilgrimage of Hajj this year. The most challenging of all the ‘ibadat, the Muslims’ ordeal begins before they set foot in Makkah. Allah (swt) says in the noble Qur’an, “Pilgrimage to Allah’s House is a duty unto mankind, for those who have the means [physical and financial] to undertake the journey” (3:97).\n\nEditorials\n\nLies the American establishment tells\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Qa'dah 17, 14362015-09-01\n\nAmericans are so used to being lied to that when they are told the truth, they refuse to believe it. For more than three decades, the US establishment has been harping about Iran’s non-existent nuclear bomb. Now that the people are told that there is no such thing, most Americans find it hard to believe it. Perhaps, they can be forgiven. The dumbing down of America is so thorough that 38% of college students believe France shares a border with America. An equal number believes Uganda is a plant or an animal.\n\nSpecial Reports\n\nThe Iran nuclear file: perspectives from Tehran\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nDhu al-Qa'dah 17, 14362015-09-01\n\nWhen the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between the Islamic Re-public and the P5+1 group of countries (the US, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany) was agreed in Vienna on July 14, Western media outlets immediately re-ported that there were “celebrations” in Tehran. The BBC as usual led the pack. Conversely, opponents of the deal were dubbed as “hardliners” whose personal in-terests would be affected if it was approved and implemented.\n\nOpinion\n\nPosts, power, and legitimacy\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nShawwal 15, 14362015-08-01\n\nThere is a common misconception among people that leads them to assume that just because a person holds a certain position of authority or office, that he/she automatically has legitimacy.\n\nEditorials\n\nImplications of the Iran nuclear deal\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nShawwal 15, 14362015-08-01\n\nIt has been described as “breathtaking,” “game changer,” and a “new chapter in in-ternational relations.” It is all these and more. Some comments about the process and content of the agreement between Iran and the P5+1 group of countries are in order before we discuss its implementation procedure and the broader implications.\n\nEditorials\n\nZionist crimes against Palestinian children\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nShawwal 15, 14362015-08-01\n\nThe moment Zionist crimes against the Palestinians are mentioned, their apologists immediately trot out the anti-Semitism charge. It has become tedious to argue that it is not anti-Semitism but a reflection of the grim reality the Palestinians face on a daily basis.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nThe odd couple: Erdogan and Najdi Bedouins\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nShawwal 15, 14362015-08-01\n\nPolitics makes for strange bedfellows but the alliance between Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan and the Najdi Bedouins occupying the Arabian Peninsula is even stranger than fiction.

We expose the conspirators.\n\nEditorials\n\nInternational bodies as tools of imperialism\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 14, 14362015-06-01\n\nThere is nothing “international” about bodies like the UN, World Bank, IMF, IAEA etc. These are all tools in the hands of imperialist powers.\n\nEditorials\n\nOIC summit: theatre of the absurd\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 14, 14362015-06-01\n\nThe OIC is the butt of many jokes but it surpassed even its own absurd existence when the Kuwaitis host called for confronting the threat of terrorism and extremism while financing both in conjunction with their Bedouin cousins from Najd.\n\nOpinion\n\nEngaging the noble Book in Ramadan\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSha'ban 14, 14362015-06-01\n\nMuslims prepare to welcome Ramadan and engage the noble Qur’an.

The Islamic Republic’s success in withstanding the global conspiracy of kufr and nifaq for more than 36 years is testimony to its strong Islamic roots.\n\nEditorials\n\nThe axis of US, Banu Saud and Banu Isra’il\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 12, 14362015-05-01\n\nThe real axis of evil comprises the trio the US, Bani Saud and Bani Isra’il. In this caste pyramid, the Bani Isra’il sit on top, the US in the middle while the Bani Saud, as slaves, are at the bottom.\n\nEditorials\n\nDisappointing conduct of the Ikhwan and Hamas\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 12, 14362015-05-01\n\nBoth the Ikhwan al-Muslimoon in Egypt and Hamas in Palestine have suffered greatly but they continue to consort with unsavory characters tarnishing their own reputation.\n\nOpinion\n\nBani Saud’s crusade\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRajab 12, 14362015-05-01\n\nA thousand years ago, the pope diverted the energies of warring princes in Europe against the Muslims in Palestine.

There is a deliberate policy behind the demonization of Muslims.\n\nEditorials\n\nThe Najdi bedouins’ aggression in Yemen\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Akhirah 12, 14362015-04-01\n\nHas the Bani Saud made one mistake too many by attacking Yemen?

The average consumer of mainstream information, who has little behind-the-scenes knowledge, is unaware of the fact that such books are for the most part circulated by publishers that know the chosen class of rulers in Arabia are functionaries of the American imperium and camouflaged clients of the Zionist interest. The world is long overdue for a serious and honest deconstruction of the colonialist love child and imperialist darling otherwise known as Saudi Arabia.\n\n1\n\nLeader's Letter Warns about Rise of Extremism in Name of Islam\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 15, 14362015-03-06\n\nZafar Bangash, Director of Contemporary Islamic Thought Institute, says Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, adopts a light and kind tone in his letter to the youth in the West with the aim of promoting the Islamic moderation and warning against the rise of extremism in the name of Islam.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe language of imperialism\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 10, 14362015-03-01\n\nImperialism uses a large number of tools to maintain its hegemony over the rest of the world. None is more powerful than language and the mind of the colonized people. Freedom cannot be achieved without decolonizing the mind.\n\nEditorials\n\nThe Muslim world: challenges and prospects\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 10, 14362015-03-01\n\nThe Muslim world is beset by numerous problems and some countries may even undergo further disintegration but the silver lining is the Islamic Republic of Iran.

This should give hope to oppressed Muslims everywhere.\n\nEditorials\n\nCapital crimes of capitalism\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nJumada' al-Ula' 10, 14362015-03-01\n\nIf capitalism is such a great system why is there such widespread poverty in the world?

Washington just signed an agreement with Turkey to train “moderate” rebels to fight in Syria.

Muslims will continue to love him more than their own selves.\n\n1\n\nEditorials\n\nIslamic revolution at 36\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Thani 11, 14362015-02-01\n\nHow the Islamic revolution in Iran has survived for 36 years despite unrelenting aggression from imperialist and Zionist powers is inspirational. It is the commitment of the people of Iran to Islam and the taqwa of its muttaqi leadership.\n\nEditorials\n\nShelf life of the Bani Saud expires?\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Thani 11, 14362015-02-01\n\nWhile no individual is indispensable, the Saudi regime is facing serious internal and external challenges that point toward its demise sooner rather than later.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe takfiris’ allure\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Awwal 10, 14362015-01-01\n\nThe ISIS takfiris use Islamic rhetoric to attract gullible and frustrated Muslim youth to their ranks. Their fraud must be exposed to deal with them effectively.\n\nEditorials\n\nDecember 16: from Dhaka to Peshawar\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Awwal 10, 14362015-01-01\n\nBrute force is not the answer to every problem even if the temptation to use force has gained currency in Pakistan in the aftermath of the Peshawar school massacre. Lessons must be learned from the past in order not to repeat them.\n\nEditorials\n\nIslam’s view on slaying of innocents\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Awwal 10, 14362015-01-01\n\nSlaying innocent non-combatants violates every tenet of Islam. Those that indulge in such conduct are going against the teachings of the Qur’an and the Sunnah of the noble Messenger (saws).\n\nSpecial Reports\n\nChina’s Silk Road to riches, for many…\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Awwal 10, 14362015-01-01\n\nChina is reviving the old Silk Road idea that will integrate Central Asia, Russia and Europe in the west and, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia in the east into its rapidly growing economy.\n\nDaily News Analysis\n\nCharlie Hebdo, Islamophobia and ‘freedom of speech’\n\nCrescent International, Zafar Bangash\n\nRabi' al-Awwal 10, 14362015-01-01\n\nThe murderous attack on the Islamophobic French magazine Charlie Hebdo is being used to whip up anti-Muslim hysteria and make fascism respectable. Pity the marginalized Muslims of France, indeed anywhere else in the Western world.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe new emerging multi-polar world\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSafar 08, 14362014-12-01\n\nThe US-led ‘unipolar’ world is dead. A multi-polar world is emerging but what role will Muslims play in it?\n\nEditorials\n\nFrom al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa…\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSafar 08, 14362014-12-01\n\nThe occupiers of the two Harams appear determined to destroy both for their nefarious agendas. The House of Saud and the Zionists are two faces of the same coin.\n\nEditorials\n\nWhat ails the Muslim world?\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSafar 08, 14362014-12-01\n\nMuslim countries may have achieved nominal independence but they continue to suffer from the debilitating legacy of the colonial imposed order in their societies.\n\nIslamic Movement\n\nIslamic Awakening movements four years later\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nSafar 08, 14362014-12-01\n\nIslamic Awakening movements have been undermined by the corrupt regimes subverting the will of the people. Much greater effort based on clarity of thought will be needed to consign these oppressive regimes into the dustbin of history.\n\nMain Stories\n\nTakfiris, Saudis and the struggle for the soul of Islam\n\nZafar Bangash\n\nMuharram 08, 14362014-11-01\n\nDespite the hype about fighting them, the US and its allies have nurture"
