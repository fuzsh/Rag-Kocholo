        "text": "Jyotiba Phule, Rabindranath Tagore, and Gijubhai Badheka were Indian educators who established schools and conducted various experiments in education. For Tagore, the question of education was extremely important. He deeply considered not only the methods of education but also its content. During his time, Tagore constantly grappled with the indigenous concept of education that valued presenting unscientific and unverified ideas to students. Tagore was a naturalist in both senses- he emphasized learning and teaching close to nature and advocated for adopting natural methods in education. His story \"The Parrot's Training\" and various poems illustrate his naturalistic approach. Tagore stressed understanding natural and social phenomena through the scientific method, promoting scientific thinking and temper. His educational vision included freedom, creativity, holistic development, experiential learning, and an interdisciplinary approach. Tagore‚Äôs education system aimed at the overall development of the child, including intellectual, emotional, spiritual, and physical development. Tagore's ideas are more relevant today, offering guidance for a more humane and natural education system, making his contributions a milestone in global educational philosophy. #GrowthMindset #NaturalisticEducation #ProjectBasedLearning #Education #Pedagogy #Curriculum #Developer #Instructional #Designer\n\nEmpowering kids to speak up for themselves brings confidence and independence.

The Tonga Schools project is working towards building these brigdes so that families have a #senseofbelonging in the school and the school does not become an alien place for the families that may not have the language skills or the local cultural references. Always good to see projects that bring down the metaphorical (and sometimes very concrete) 'wall' and, in the words of the Tonga Project objectives, 'promote unity among diverse communities'. Also, the project description exists in 5 languages!
