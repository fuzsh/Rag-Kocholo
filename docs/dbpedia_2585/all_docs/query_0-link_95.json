We praise Him, ask him, and seek his forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from evils of ourselves and mischiefs of our deeds. Whomsoever Allah guides, cannot be misguided. Peace and blessings be upon the Final Messenger Muhammed , on his family and his noble companions , Ameen\n\nBelief in Doomsday is one of the fundamentals and pillars of faith. It is the day when everyone is to get recompense and punishment for one's work and has to go to heaven or hell according to one's deeds. This is the reason each and every Prophet warned his people of the Day of Judgement.\n\nAs for the knowledge of the time of Qiyamah (End of the World) , it has not been given to any angel or Prophet. Nobody besides Allah knows when the final hour is.\n\nThe Quran states, O Prophet the infidels ask you about the time of Qiyamah. So tell them that it's knowledge is with Allah only. (Surah Luqman)\n\nHowever certain events are going to take place prior to the coming of the final hour. These events are known as the Signs of Qiyamah. All the Prophets informed their people of the signs of the final hour. Our Prophet Muhammed being the last and the seal of Prophets, knowing that Doomsday is to come upon this very ummah, explained clearly and in considerable detail the signs of the final hour to the extent that sometimes he would lecture his companions all day on this subject.\n\nAbu Zaid (R.A.) says, 'The Holy Prophet sat down on the pulpit after Fajar Prayer and began a deliver a long sermon until the time for Zohr prayer came. After saying the Zohr prayer he again sat on the pulpit and began the sermon, which continued till Asr prayer. After the Asr prayer he resumed the sermon so much so that the sun set. he related whatever happened in the past and also related in detail whatever is to happen in the future. Those amongst us who had good memories retained many things.' (Muslim)\n\nThe signs of the final hour can be divided into two groups.\n\n1) Minor signs\n\nMinor signs are events of normal nature prophesised by our Prophet Muhammed to take place before Qiyamah like the consumption of alcohol, lifting of knowledge and prevalence of ignorance and immorality and signs of this nature. The majority of the minor signs have appeared while some are occurring and some will appear with major signs.\n\n2) Major signs\n\nMajor signs ae events of extraordinary nature prophesied by our Prophet to take place before Qiyamah like all the events mentioned in the following hadith narrated by Hudhaifa ibn Usayd that the Prophet said, 'The last hour will not arrive till you have seen ten signs. He then mentioned the Smoke, Dajjal, Beast, Rising of the Sun from the place of it's setting, the Descent of Isa, Ya'juj Ma'juj, Three Landslides, one in the East , one in the West and one in the Arabian Peninsula after that a Fire would spread from Yemen and drive the people to their place of gathering.' (Muslim)\n\nThis book written by the Ulama of the Institute is a concise summary of only the major events leading up to the Day of Judgement. Each of the following signs: Mahdi, Dajjal, Descension of Isa, Ya'juj Ma'juj, Landslides, Smoke, Rising of the Sun from the east, Beast and the Fire are explained in detail. The supporting evidences are written at the end of every section and have been taken from various authentic Hadith collections.\n\nAll Praises belong to Allah, Lord of all the world.\n\nBack to content\n\nTHE MAHDI\n\nThe Coming of Imaam Mahdi is one of the signs of Qiyamah as is the belief of the Ahlus-Sunnah and he has yet to appear.\n\nAbdullah-bin-Masood has reported that the Prophet said, \"The world will not pass away before the Arabs are ruled by a man (referring to Mahdi) of my family whose name will be the same as mine.\" (Abu Daud)\n\nHowever, many people in the past falsely claimed to be Imaam Mahdi. One of these false claimants was Mohd-bin-Tomart, a tyrant who spread corruption and even buried some of his companions because they didn't believe that he was the Mahdi described by the Ahadith of Prophet . Some believe it was Mohd-bin-al Askari who disappeared at the age of 5 and went into hiding and has been hiding for 10 centuries. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (The Cursed) was also one of those who claimed to be the Mahdi as well as many other people. Besides those mentioned there were many others who claimed the office of Mahdi, the most recent being somebody from Manchester who claimed the position for himself.\n\nIt should be noted that none of the above or anybody else who claimed to be the Mahdi in the past fulfilled the conditions laid down by the Prophet .\n\nA list of some of the signs which will precede Imaam Mahdi and some that describe him have been gathered in this book so that we Muslims are not misled to believe in somebody claiming to be the Mahdi who in reality is a blatant liar.\n\nBack to content\n\nSigns That Will Precede Him 1) A General Sign\n\nThere are many signs that will precede him; a general and very important sign is that he will come at a time when there is great confusion, intense disputes and violent death. When people are afflicted by disturbances and fear. Calamities will fall upon the people, so much so that a man shall not find shelter to shelter him from oppression. There will be many battles and fitnaas before his appearance. Every time a fitnaa has come to an end, another will start, spread and intensify. The people will be troubled to such extent that they will long for death. It is then that Imaam Mahdi will be sent.\n\nAbu Saeed al-Khudri has reported that the Messenger of Allah said:\n\n''He will be sent at a time of intense disputes and differences among people and earthquakes.'' (Ahmad)\n\nBack to content\n\n2) Note. The Double Eclipse In Ramadan statement quoted from Darequtni is NOT verified, indeed it's authenticity is questionable. It is NOT to be considered as authentic Hadith.\n\n3) The Battle in Mina\n\nBefore Imaam Mahdi emerges an inter-tribal fight will take place. In the same year Haji's will be looted and a battle will erupt in Mina in which many people will be killed.\n\nAmr-bin-Shuaib reported from his grandfather that the Messenger of Allah said, ''In Dhul-Qada (Islamic month) the tribes will fight, Hajis will be looted and there will be a battle in Mina in which many people will be slain and blood will flow until it runs over the Jamara-tul-aqba. Their companions (referring to Imaam Mahdi) will flee to a point between the Corner and the Maqaam and will be forced to accept people's allegiance.'' (Al-Fitan Nuaim-b-Hammad)\n\nBack to content\n\n4) The Euphrates Will Disclose Mountain of Gold\n\nThe final hour will not come until the river Euphrates (which flows through Syria and Iraq and finally opens in the Gulf) will disclose a mountain of gold over which people will fight and die. It should be noted that this is a sign, which will precede Imaam Mahdi only according to some Ulama. Abu Huraira (R.A.) reported that the Messenger of Allah said, ''The hour shall not occur until the Euphrates will disclose a mountain of gold over which people will fight . Ninety- nine out of which hundred shall be killed and every one of them will say' Perchance I shall be the one to succeed. ''(Muslim)\n\nIn another narration we have been told that whoever is present at the time when the Euphrates discloses a mountain of gold should not take the gold.\n\n5) Emergence of the Suffyani\n\nThe Suffyani (a descendant of Abu Sufyan) will emerge before Imam Mahdi from the depths of Damascus. According to some weak narration his name will be Urwa bin Muhammed and his Kuniya 'Abu-Utba'. The Ahadith regarding the Suffyani specify that he is a tyrant who will spread corruption and mischief on the earth before Imam Mahdi. He will be such a tyrant that he will kill the children and rip open the bellies of women. When he hears about the Mahdi, he will send an army to seize and kill him. However the Earth will swallow this army before it even reaches Imam Mahdi.\n\nAbu Huraira (R.A.) has narrated that the Prophet said, ''A man will emerge from the depth of Damascus. He will be called Suffyani. Most of those who follow him will be from the tribe of Kalb. He will kill by ripping the stomachs of women and even kill the children. A man from my family will appear in Haram, the news of his advent will reach the Suffyani and he will send forth one of his armies. He (referring to Imam Mahdi) will defeat them. They will then travel with whoever remains until they come to a desert and they will be swallowed . None will be saved except the one who had informed the others about them. '' (Mustadarak)\n\nBack to content\n\n6) The Emergence of Haris-Al-Harrath and Mansur\n\nHazrat Ali reported that the Prophet said, ''There will be a man from Transoxania who will be called Harith-Harrath and a man called Mansur will be at his vanguard. He will give abode to the family of Mohammad (referring to Imam Mahdi) just as the Quraish gave abode to the Prophet (Mishkat)\n\n7) An army will perish in Baidah\n\nOnce he has appeared an army that has come to fight him will perish in Baidah (a flat piece of land next to Madinah facing the direction of Makkah).\n\nUmme-Salama (R.A.) reported that the Prophet ''There shall be differences and intense dispute at the time of the death of a Khalifh. Then a man from the inhabitants of Madinah (referring to Imam Mahdi) will come out of the flee to Makkah (so that he does not get caught in the dispute and is not made the Khalifh). Some Makkans will come to him and take him out though he will be unwilling. They will then make him accept their Bayat between the Black Stone and the place of Ibrahim . An army will then be sent to fight him from Syria , however it will perish in Baidah, between Makkah and Madinah. When the people see and hear about this event ,the awliya (God fearing people) of Syria and Iraq will make Bayat with him.'' (Abu Daud)\n\n8) A star with a luminous tail will rise from the east before his emergence. (Al-Iza'ah).\n\n9) A voice in Ramadhan will awaken sleeps and alarm those that are awake (Ibid)\n\n10) The emergence of al-A'hraj al-Kindi, Abqa and Ashab before Imam Mahdi (Ibid)\n\n11) The earth will swallow a village near Damascus (Ibid)\n\n12) An army with black banners will come from the East (Ibid)\n\nThere are many other signs which will precede Imam Mahdi. For more information read the relevant Books\n\nBack to content\n\nThe Signs of Imaam Mahdi\n\n1) He will be from the progeny of the Prophet and descendent of Fatimah (R.A). Umme Salama (R.A) reported: I heard the Prophet of Allah ( ) saying, \"The Mahdi will appear from my progeny, from the descendants of Fatimah.\" (Abu Daud)\n\n2) His name will be Muhammad or Ahmad and his father's name will be Abdullah. Ibne Masood (R.A) reported that the Prophet said, \"If there remains in the world but a day, the mighty Allah will greatly prolong that day till he will send there in a man from me or from the members of my house. His name will be similar to my name and his father's name to my father's name.\" (Abu Daud)\n\n3) He will resemble the Prophet in character. Hadrat Ali (R.A) once looked at his son and remarked, \"This son of mine is Saiyid who was named by the Prophet and soon from his loins will come forth a man by the name of your Prophet and who will resemble him in conduct but not in appearance.\" (Abu Daud)\n\n4) He will have a shiny forehead and a high bridge nose. Abu Saeed reported that the Prophet said, \"The Mahdi will appear from me, shining of forehead, long of nose.\" (Abu Daud).\n\n5) Once Hadrat Ali (R.A) was asked regarding his description. He replied, \"He is a well built youth of average height and a handsome face, his hair reaches his shoulders and the light of his face is contrasted by the darkness of his hair and beard.\" (Al-Isha'ah)\n\n6) He will be slow of speech (a slight stutter) and when he is delayed, he will strike his left thigh with his right hand.\" (Al-Isha'ah)\n\n7) He will appear from the east. Thawban (R.A) reported that the Prophet said, \"Three men will be killed at the place where your treasure is. Each of them will be the son of a Khalifah but none of them will get hold of the treasure. Then the black banners will come out of the east, and they will slaughter you in a way that has never been seen before. If you see him give him your allegiance, even if you have to crawl over ice, because he is the Khalifah of Allah, the Mahdi.\" (Ibne Majah)\n\nOnly some of the signs that will precede Imaam Mahdi and of the Mahdi himself have been gathered in this book. The true Mahdi, the one referred to in the Ahadith of Prophet as one of the signs of Qiyamah, is the one in whom the pre-mentioned signs are found.\n\nBack to content\n\nHis Emergence and the People's Bayat\n\nAfter the death of a Khalifh there shall be intense dispute and difference of opinion in whom should become the next Khalifh. Fearing he may get caught up in the dispute and made the Khalifh, Imaam Mahdi will flee from Madinah to Makkah. However, to his surprise on reaching Makkah, some Makkans will bring him out of his house against his will and take him to Masjid Haraam and 313 as has been mentioned in the hadith reported by Imam Hakim in Al-Mustadrak will force him to accept their Bayat between the Rukn (corner of the Ka'aba containing the black stone) and the place of Ibrahim. The news of his allegiance will quickly spread and thus an army from Syria will be sent to fight him. However no harm will come to Imaam Mahdi nor his followers who will be supported by Allah. The earth will swallow up this army before it can get near to the Imaam in a place called Baidah (a flat piece of land between Makkah and Madinah). After seeing and hearing about this extraordinary event and sign, the Awliya (pious saints) of Syria and Iraq will come to Imaam Mahdi and swear allegiance to him between the black stone and the Maqam (the place of Ibrahim which is near the Ka'aba). (The above content can be found in the Hadith of Umme Salama/Abu Daud)\n\nBack to content\n\nThe First Battle\n\nHis first battle will be against the tribe of Kalb. A short period after the eminent saints of Syria and Iraq have sworn allegiance; a man from the Quraish will rise whose maternal uncle's belong to the Kalb tribe and he will send an army to fight Imaam Mahdi. However this army will be overcome and defeated. This will be his first victory.\n\nBack to content\n\nThe Great War\n\n(The author of al-Isha'ah has mentioned that this battle will take place in Imam Mahdi's time).\n\nImam Mahdi will have to fight many battles, the most important and difficult being the battle against the Christians in which a large number of Muslims will be martyred.\n\n' Yusayr bin Jabir said, \"A red sandstorm erupted in the city of Kufah. Afterwards, a man came shouting and repeating the same words, 'O Abdullah bin Mas'ud! The hour has come.' He (Yusayr) then said that he sat up after he was leaning (on his side) and said, ''The hour will not arrive until no inheritance will be divided and no war possessions will bring about satisfaction. ''He pointed with his hands towards Ash-Sham saying, ''An enemy will gather its forces against the followers of Islam.''I said, ''Do you mean Ar-Rum? He said ''Yes.''Then, during this war, fierce fighting will occur. Muslim will ask for a volunteer expedition that will vie to die or return victorious. They will fight until the night separates them. Both sides will return to their camps not yet victorious and the expedition will perish.\n\nMuslims will then (in the third day) ask for volunteer expedition that will vie to die or return victorious. They will fight until the night separates them. Both sides will return to their camp not yet victorious and the expedition will perish. In the fourth day, the rest of the Muslim forces will turn against them (the disbelieves) and Allah will defeat them (the disbelieves). They will suffer casualties never heard of before or he said, ''Never seen before, even birds flying near them will not pass without falling down dead.\n\nAfterwards, sons of the same fathers (from the Muslim side), who were near a hundred, will count the survivors and will find out only one of them survived. Therefore, what war possession will bring satisfaction and what inheritance will be divided? While they are doing this they will hear of an even bigger calamity; That is, a man will scream amongst them that the Dajjal has appeared among their families which they left behind. They will discard what they have in their hands and proceed. They will send ten horsemen as an expedition force.\n\nThe Messenger of Allah said, ''I know their names and their fathers name and the colours of their horses. They will be the best horsemen on the face of Earth, ''or (he said) ''(They) Will be amongst the best horsemen on the face of Earth.'' (Muslim)\n\nThe cause of this great battle will be the Christians. The Christians and Muslims as allies will conquer a third enemy. However, the Christians will act treacherously as they will claim the victory on the strength of their religion, thus the Muslims will be driven to arms and will fight them.\n\nDhu Makhbar said, ''I heard the Apostle of Allah ( ) say, ''You will make a secure peace with the Byzantines, then you will fight an enemy behind you, and you will be victorious, take the boot, and be safe you will the return and alight in a meadow with mounds and one of the Christians will raise the cross and say, 'The cross has conquered'. One of the Muslims will become angry and smash it, and the Byzantines will act treacherously and prepare for battle.''\n\nBack to content\n\nConquest of Constantinople\n\nThe great war between the Christians and Muslims will result in the Muslims conquering Constantinople (which is modern day Istanbul) without army by the sheer force of Takbeer (Allahu Akbar).\n\nAbu Hurairah reports that the Prophet said, ''Have you heard of a town of which a part is in the sea?''\n\n''Yes'' said they. He said: 'The last hour shall not occur till 70,000 of the children of Isaac shall attack it. When they come to it, they (Muslims) will not fight with arms, nor throw arrows. They will only say: There is no god but Allah, Allah is the greatest, and then on of its sides will fall down. They will recite for the second time : there is no god but Allah, Allah is the greatest, and then another of its side will fall down. After that they will say it for the third time: there is no god but Allah and Allah is the greatest, and then it will be opened for them and they will enter and acquire booty. While they will be dividing the booty, a proclaimer will come to them and proclaim: 'Verily Dajjal has come out. 'Then they will leave everything and return. ' (Muslim)\n\nIt should be noted that the conquests will take place a very short period. Abdullah-b-Busr has reported that the Messenger of Allah has said: 'Between the Great War and the conquest of the city (Constantinople) there will be six years, and the Dajjal shall appear in the seventh year,' (abided)\n\nBack to content\n\nBlessings at the time of Imam Mahdi\n\nOnce again the Quran and Sunnah will govern the people, this time by the rightly guided Khalifh, Imam Mahdi. Islam will gain an upper hand and will be firmly established in the land. The oppression, tyranny, and darkness that prevailed all over the globe will be replaced with justice, peace and equity. The smile, which was long forgotten, will be restored on the Muslim faces and the inhabitants of the Heaven and Earth will be pleased with him. Everybody will be happy to the extent that even birds an wild animals will rejoice in his rule. Heaven will end rain profusely, livestock will be in abundance, land will become fertile, the earth will become green and sprout with abundant fruit ad vegetation.\n\n(The above content has been taken from various hadith, which can be found in Abu-Daud and from the hadith narrated by Abu-Saeed al-Khudri in Musnad Ahmad.)\n\nDue to the booty gained from the various conquest everyone will have so much wealth that an eyebrow will not even be raised at somebody else's wealth. Callers will proclaim in the street, ''Is anybody in need of anything?'' Nobody will respond except one person. In the latter part of Abu-Saeed al-Khudri's hadith it is mentioned ''A caller will call 'Who is in need of wealth?' Only one person will stand (and response to the call and say I am in need of wealth) he will be told to go to the treasurer and tell him that the Mahdi orders you to give some wealth. 'Gather and take it', he will be told. (He will begin to put it in his lap, when he realized that nobody else has come and he was the only one) he will regret it and say 'I was the greediest from among the Ummah of Muhammed . The narrator says, he will return it but it will not be accepted and it will be said to him that we do not accept what we have given. (Ahmad)\n\nAbu-Saeed al-Khudri has also reported that the Prophet said regarding Mahdi; that a man will come to him and say, 'Give me, give me'. Then he will spread his cloth and put in it as much as he can carry.\n\nBack to content\n\nHis Reign as a Khalifh\n\nThere are different narration's regarding his reign as a Khalifh. Some traditions indicate that is reign will be seven years like the hadith of Umme Salama in Abu-Daud, ''He will remain seven years, then die, and Muslims will pray over him. '' (Abu-Daud)\n\nOther traditions indicate that his reign will last seven, eight or nine years like the Hadith of Abu Saeed in Mustadrak.\n\nDue to different traditions the period of Imaam Mahdi's reign is disputed. Many Scholars have taken seven years to be the period of his reign due to the fact that the Ahadith which indicate seven years are the most authentic. Other Scholars like Shah Rafiud-din, after careful analysis have concluded that the first seven years if his reign will pass without worry, he will spend the eight preparing to fight the Dajjal and spend the ninth with Prophet Isa (Jesus) He will thereafter die, Prophet Jesus will read his funeral prayer and bury him.\n\nBack to content\n\nDajjal\n\nThe emergence of the Dajjal is the most important sign as his trial and fitna will be the biggest ever seen on the Face of the earth and even those firm in faith will be shaken.\n\nThe Messenger of Allah said, \"Between the creation of Prophet Adam and the coming of the last hour, their will arise no matter more serious than the Dajjal.\" (Imran-b-Hussain/ Muslim)\n\nDue to the severity of this turmoil, every Prophet from the first to the last warned and informed his people about, the Dajjal and his turmoil. (Anas / Bukhari, Muslim)\n\nThe Dajjal will appear once the Muslim army, have conquered Constantinople and reached Syria. Emerging from the east, moving from city to city he will perform unusual feat and cause fitna wherever he goes. Before we move onto his trials many important questions need to be answered. 'Is he alive?' 'Which signs will precede him?' 'How will we recognise him?' and so forth.\n\nBack to content\n\nThe story of Hadrat Tamim Dari and the Dajjal\n\nThe story of Tamim Dari which follows, answers the first and most important question, is the Dajjal alive? and whether Hadrat Tamim Dari and his companions have seen him when they were thrown by the waves on to some remote Island.\n\nFatimah-bint-Qais reported, \"I heard the proclaimer of the Messenger of Allah proclaiming (for) 'Congregational Prayer'. I went to the mosque and prayed with the Prophet . When he finished his prayer, he sat upon the pulpit smiling and said, 'Let every man remain in his seat.' He then asked, 'Do you know why I have called you together?' They replied, 'Allah and his Messenger know best.' The Prophet said, 'By Allah, I have not called you together for hope or for fear, I have called you together because Tamim ad- Dari who was a Christian, came and embraced Islam.\n\nHe narrated a story to me, which agreed with the account I had given to you about the Dajjal. He informed me that he had embarked upon a sea-boat with thirty men of Lakhm and Jozam. Then the sea waves played with them for a month and threw them on to an island when the sun was about to set. They sat in a small side boat and landed on the Island. A beast with very coarse hair met them. They could not tell its front from its back due to its excessive hair. They asked, 'Woe to thee! Who art thou?\" It replied, 'I am a spy. Go to this man in the monastery, as he is eager to receive the information you bring.\n\n' Tamim Dari said, 'When it named a man for us, we fled away from it lest it might be the devil. Then we hurriedly went on until we entered the monastery and found a big-bodied man whom we had never seen before. He was firmly tied up, his hands tied to his neck, the place between his knees, and joints tied up with iron chains.' We asked, 'Woe to thee! What are thou?' He replied, 'You have the power to get my information. Inform me about yourselves.\n\n' They replied, 'We are people from Arabia, we embarked upon a sea boat, but the sea waves played with us for a month and threw us onto this island. A beast of coarse hairs met us and said, 'I am a spy. Go to the man in the monastery.' So we approached you hurriedly. He asked, 'Tell me about the trees of Baisan. Do they bear fruit?.' 'Yes' We replied. He said, 'Behold! Soon they will not yield fruit.' He asked, 'Inform me of the lake of Tiberias. Is there water in it?' We replied, 'It is full of water.' He informed us, 'Soon its water will disappear.' He then asked, 'Inform me of the fountain of Zugara. Is there water in it and do its inhabitants irrigate with the water of the fountain?' 'Yes, it is full of water and it's inhabitants irrigate from its water. He asked, 'Inform me of the Prophet of the illiterates. What does he do?' We said, 'He has just come out of Makkah and gone to Yathrib.' He asked, 'Have the Arabs fought with him?' 'Yes' We replied. He asked, 'How did he treat them' We informed him that he had got the upper hand of those of the Arabs who opposed him and they obeyed him. He said, 'Behold! It is better for them if they obey him. As for myself I am certainly the Anti-Christ and it is near that an order will be passed for me to come out. I shall then come out and travel the world. I shall leave no village at which I shall not land within 40 nights except Makkah and Taibah, which will be forbidden to me. Whenever I wish to enter one of the two, an angel with a sword in his hand will encounter me and prevent me therefrom. There will be angels on every side to guard it. The apostle of Allah struck his pulpit with his staff and said, 'This is Taibah meaning Madinah. Behold! Did I not tell you?' 'Yes' they replied. 'Behold, he is in the Syrian sea or sea of Yemen; no, rather he is from the eastern direction. He then pointed out with his hand to wards the East.' (Muslim)\n\nBack to content\n\nSigns that will precede him\n\nThe coming of Imaam Mahdi\n\nIn light of many Ahadith the Ulama of the Ahlus-Sunnah are of the opinion that Imaam Mahdi will come before the Dajjal and the Dajjal will appear in the later parts of Imaam Mahdi's reign.\n\nThe Great Famine\n\nThere will be a famine for three years before his appearance. In the first year of the famine the heaven will withhold one third of its rain and the earth one third of its crops. In the second year of the famine heaven will withhold two thirds of its rain and the earth will withhold two thirds of its crops. In the third year there will not be a single drop of rain and not a single thing will grow and thus all the animals with hoofs and biting teeth will die and the Tasbeeh will suffice the believers hunger. (Asma-b-Yauzeed-Mishkat)\n\nDajjal's parents\n\nHis father will be tall and thin and his nose will be pointed like a beak while his mother will be fat with two long hands. They will both remain thirty years without a child. After thirty years a one eyed son with biting teeth and of little benefit will be born to them whose heart will remain awake while his eyes will sleep. (Abu-Bakara-Tirmidhi)\n\nBack to content\n\nGeneral signs that will precede Dajjal\n\nFrom the hadith of Umme Shareek which can be found in Muslim we could conclude the Arabs will be less in numbers. At the same time we can conclude from the hadith of Jabir-b-Abdullah which can be found in An-Nihaya that religious learning will be at a low and very few people will be aquainted with religious principles and doctrines and thus ignorance will prevail.\n\nBack to content\n\nSigns in the Dajjal\n\nDajjal's Physical description\n\nThe Dajjal is a young1 fat 2 man, wheatish3 in complexion with a broad chest 4 and biting teeth. Resembling Abdul Uzzah bin Qatad from the tribe of Khuza'a his head is covered7 with curly hair8 with the letters \"Ka' \"Fa\" \"Ra''9 written between his eyes which every believer will be able to clearly see and read literate or illiterate, he has a shining forehead10 and defect in both eyes. His left eye has a swelling pupil11 while he is blind12 from the right.

While they are distributing the war posses- sions a proclaimer will proclaim that the Dajjal has appeared and causing fitna in your homes. On hearing this cry the Muslims will leave the booty and head towards Syria1. It will come to their knowledge that this was a false rumour. However after reaching Syria the Dajjal will truly emerge. He will come out from a road between Syria and Iraq2 and his emergence will become known in Isfahan3 at a place called Yahoodah. Riding a white ass4, the two ears of which will be forty hands apart, 70,000 Jew's of Isfahan will follow him with hoods on their heads. Also accompanied by Devils6 and Jewish magicians7 he will first claim Prophethood8 and then God hood. Travelling as fast as those clouds which are driven by the winds he will travel to east and west entering every country, carrying out murders, pillage, devastation and performing unusual feats wherever he goes9.\n\nFootnote:\n\n1) Abu Huraira / Muslim\n\n2) Nawwas-b-Samaan / Muslim\n\n3) Anas / Al-Fathur-Rabbani\n\n4) Abu Huraira / Baihaqi\n\n5) Anas / Muslim\n\n6) Jabir-b-Abdullah / An-Nihayah\n\n7) Ibne Abbas / Kanzul-Umaal\n\n8) Abu Umamah / lbn Majah\n\nBack to content\n\nDajjal's Turmoil\n\nDajjal's Deception\n\nTwo angels resembling two Prophets, one on either side will accompany him. This will be to test mankind. Hence Dajjal will ask, \"Am I not your lord? Do I not give life and death?\" One of the angels will reply, \"You are a liar.\" However nobody will be able to hear this reply besides the other angel. The second angel addressing the first angel will say, \"You are speaking the truth.\" Every body will hear what this second angel said and will think that an angel is testifying that the Dajjal is Allah though in reality this second angel was addressing the first and agreeing with his reply that you are speaking the truth that the Dajjal is certainly a liar. (Narrated by Safeena-Musnad Ahrnad)\n\nHe will come to a Bedouin whose parents have passed away and will say to him, \"Will you believe that I am your Lord if I bring your parents back to life.\" He will reply, \"Yes.\" The devils that are accompanying him will take the form of his parents and after resembling his parents will say to him, \"Oh child believe in him and follow him, he is your Lord.' The Bedouin will be deceived and forced into believing him. (Abu Umamah/Ibne Majah)\n\nHe will come to another Bedouin and say, \"Will you believe in me as your Lord if I bring your camel back to life?\" \"Yes\", he will reply. He will make a figure for him like his camel, which will have a beautiful odour and a big hump. (Asma-b-Yazeed /Mishkat)\n\nHe will have water and fire with him. As for that which the people will see as water, in reality will be fire, which will burn and as for that which people will see as fire, in reality will be cold, sweet water. The Prophet's advice is: \"Whoever meets the Dajjal and sees the water and the fire, he should fall in the fire and not the water, as the fire in reality is water and the water in reality is fire.'' (Hudaifah/Mishkat)\n\nBack to content\n\nBelievers in Allah will face hardship while The believers in Dajjal will temporarily rejoice\n\nHe will come to people and tell them he is Allah and they will believe him. The sky on his order will pour rain and the earth will grow crops for these people. Their animals will graze on his land and return to them in the evening with large udders and their flanks full. He will then proceed to some other people and call them but they will refuse to believe him. Without forcing them he will leave and carry on with his mission. However, when these true believers wake up in the morning they will find that they are penniless and all their properties have been destroyed. (Nawwas-b-Samaan/Muslim)\n\nThe Earth will disclose treasure at his command\n\nPassing by a place in ruins, he will order it to take out its hidden treasure. The earth will immediately take out its hidden treasure. The earth will immediately take out its treasure and the treasure will literally follow him wherever he goes like bees following the queen bee. (Nawwas-b-Samaan/Muslim)\n\nDajjal faces Opposition\n\nOn hearing about the Dajjal a true believer will head towards him. However, on the way he will be stopped by Dajjal's soldiers and asked where he is intending to go. Replying that he is going to meet the person who claims that he is Allah, the soldiers doubting him will ask, ''Do you not believe in our Lord (Dajjal)?'' He will reply there is nothing hidden about our Lord Allah so how can I take Dajjal as my Lord. Angry at his reply they will decide to kill him. But all of a sudden one of them will say, ''Hasn't our Lord (Dajjal) prohibited us from killing anyone without his permission?\" Thus they will take him to the Dajjal. On seeing the Dajjal he will shout, \"O people this is the Dajjal the Prophet mentioned and warned the believers of\". Dajjal will order to kill him. He will be placed on his belly and severely beaten. He will be asked, \"Do you still not believe in him?\" \"No! You are the lying Dajjal\" he will reply. The true believer will then be sawn into two pieces, the Dajjal will walk in between the two pieces and address him, \"Stand up.\" The true believer will become alive and stand up in one piece. Yet again he will be asked, \"Do you now believe in me?\" He will reply, \"It has only added to my insight concerning you that you are really the Dajjal.\" The believer will then proclaim, \"O people he will not be able to do anything to any man after me.\" The Dajjal angry at his refusal will grab hold of him and place a knife between his neck and throat to slaughter him but he will be unsuccessful as Allah will place copper in that area and the knife will find no way to penetrate. The Dajjal will grab hold of his hands and legs and throw him into the fire. However, the fire will turn into a pleasant garden for him. This person will be the greatest martyr in the eyes of Allah and achieve the highest position due to his first death, which was caused by severance of the body in two pieces.(Abu Saeed al-Khudri /Muslim)\n\nBack to content\n\nDajjal's Trickery\n\nDoctors and surgeons are not able to restore the eyesight of those born blind or cure the leper. Dajjal will be able to cure those born blind, restore their eyesight and cure the leper. (Abdullah-b-Mugaffal-Kanzul-Unimal)\n\nDajjal's Greed\n\nHe will have a mountain of bread with him but he will only give bread to those that believe and follow him. (Jabir-b-Abdullah-An-Nihaya)\n\nDajjal Lures the Women\n\nThe Dajjal will make a stop at a place called Markanat, near Taif. On hearing about his arrival the womenfolk will rush towards him, the men will be forced to tie their mothers, daughters, and sisters fearing they will believe in him and get caught up in fitna. (Ibne Umar-Musnad Ahmad)\n\nBack to content\n\nSafe Haven of Makkah and Madinah\n\nThe Dajjal will remain on earth for 40 days, the first of which will be a year long, second a month , the third a week, and the remaining 37 days like our normal days, moving from city to another causing fitna1. Finally he will proceed towards Makkah and Madina2 but he will be unable to enter these holy cities, Masjid Tur and Masjid al-Aqsa3. Every time he tries to enter these holy places, angels guarding these holy cities with swords in their hand will encounter him and chase him away, leaving Dajjal stationed behind Uhud4. Meanwhile, earthquakes will hit Madinah thrice and all the hypocrites will be forced to leave5.\n\nFootnote:\n\n1) Nawwas-b-Samaan / Muslim\n\n2) Fatimah-b-Qais / Muslim\n\n3) Junaid-b-umaiya / Al-Fathur-Rabbani\n\n4)Abu-Huraira / Bukhari\n\n5)Amr-b-Sufyan / Ad-Darrul-Manthur\n\nBack to content\n\nDeath\n\nLosing hope of entering these holy places, Dajjal will turn towards Syria. Imaam Mahdi will already have arranged a Muslim army and will be on the verge of leading the Muslims in morning prayer when Prophet Jesus will descend and Kill the Dajjal. (Usamah / Ibne Majah)\n\nBack to content\n\nProtection from Dajjal\n\nReciting of Surah - Kahf\n\nThe recitation of Surah Kahf is a safe guard from the Dajjal's turmoil. The Prophet (s) said, \"Whoever memorises the first ten verses of Surah Kahf will be safe from the Dajjal's Fitna.\" (Abu-Darda / Muslim)\n\nThe Prophet said, 'Whoever meets the Dajjal amongst you then he should recite the opening verse of Surah Kahf onto him.\" (Nawwas-b-Samaan / Muslim)\n\nSeeking refuge in Allah\n\nWhoever seeks Allah's refuge and protection from Dajjal's fitna especially in Salah, Inshallah will be protected.\n\nThe Prophet would pray in Salah, \"Oh Allah protect me from the punishment of the grave and protect me from Dajjal's fitna.\" (Aisha / Bukhari / Muslim)\n\nStaying miles apart\n\nWhen the Dajjal appears one should stay as far away from him as possible. The Prophet said, \"Those who hear about the Dajjal should stay far from him. By Allah! A person will approach him thinking him to be a believer, but on seeing his amazing feats he will become his follower.\" (Imran-b-Hussain / Abu Daud)\n\nBack to content\n\nSafe Haven of Makkah and Madinah\n\nOne should try to migrate to Makkah or Madinah, as he will not be able to enter these two holy cities. Thus one will be protected from his fitna. (Fatimah-b-Qais / Muslim)\n\nKnowledge of Allah's Attributes\n\nOne should seek Islamic knowledge especially knowledge of Allah's attributes. By possessing knowledge of Allah's attributes one will not be misled by the Dajjal. This knowledge teaches that Allah is perfect, can't be seen, and not in need of anything while the Dajjal is imperfect, can be seen by both believers and non-believers and in need of food and water.\n\nBack to content\n\nReturn Of Prophet Jesus\n\nBrief History of Prophet Jesus\n\nDue to the fact that the Jews had become deaf and blind to the words of God and deviated from the teachings of Moses and the right path, Allah honoured Jesus with Prophethood and sent him as a messenger to the children of Israel. Bearing all hardships Prophet Jesus spent all day and night conveying the message of Allah. Unfortunately, in spite of his tremendous effort the children of Israel did not respond and accept the message. Seeing that the poor and weak were becoming inclined towards him and fearing they would lose their leadership the Jews secretly tried to kill him. However Allah saved Prophet Jesus from their wicked scheme and gave him greater dignity by raising him alive to the heavens.\n\nAllah says in the Quran, \"They did not kill him and nor did they crucify him but the resemblance of him (Jesus ) was put over another man and those who differ there in, are in doubt. They have no certain knowledge. They are following nothing but conjecture for surely they did not kill him but Allah raised him up to him.\" (Surah Nisa)\n\nAllah says in the Quran \"When Allah says, Jesus; I will take thee to me and I will purify thee of the unbelievers\" (Surah A'li-Imran)\n\nThese verses clearly prove that the Jews did not kill Prophet Jesus and that he was raised alive to the heavens. It is due to verses like those mentioned above and many authentic Ahadith we Muslims believe that Prophet Jesus is alive in heaven at this moment in time. We further believe due to the following verses and authentic Ahadith that Prophet Jesus will return before Qiyamah and his return is a major sign of Qiyamah.\n\nAllah says in the Quran, \"And he (son of Mary) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the hour.\" (Surah Zukhruf)\n\nIbne Abbas has said that the meaning of this verse is that Prophet Jesus's descent before Qiyamah is a sign of Qiyamah. (Ibne Abbas/ Musnad)\n\nAllah says, \"There is not a single section of the people of the book that will certainly believe in Jesus before his death and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.\" (Surah Nisa) This verse clearly indicates that before the demise of Prophet Jesus everyone from the people of the book will believe in him. The Jews will disappear as Jews after his demise but at the present the Jews are very much there. The conclusion is clear that the Prophet Jesus has not died; if so all the Jews would have become believers, which they have not. He will return before Qiyamah and it is then that all the people of the book will believe in him.\n\nJabir (R.A) reported that the Messenger of Allah said, \"A party of my followers will not cease to fight for victory until the Day of Resurrection. He said, then Jesus, son of Mary, will come down. Their Imaam will say, \"Come and lead our prayer\" He will reply, \"Some of you are rulers over others on account of divine honour upon these people.\" (Muslim)\n\nAbu Huraira (R.A) reported that the Messenger of Allah said, \"By the one whose hands my life is in, surely the son of Maryam( ) will descend amongst you as a just ruler. He will destroy the cross, kill the swine and abolish the tax.\" (Bukhari)\n\nHadrat Hudaifah-b-Osaid reported: The Holy Prophet suddenly came to us while we were talking. He asked, \"What are you talking about?\" They replied \"We were talking about the last hour.\" Prophet (s) said, \"It will never come until you see ten signs before it,\" He then mentioned the Smoke, the Dajjal, the Beast, the Rising of the Sun in its place of setting, the Descent of Jesus son of Mary and Yajuj and Ma'juj. (Muslim)\n\nBack to content\n\nProphet Jesus's Tasks\n\nProphet Jesus will have three main tasks, when he descends on the Earth for the second time:\n\n1) The first and most important will be that he will destroy the Dajjal.\n\n2) Protect the Muslims from the barbarous tribes of Yajuj and Majuj by taking them to Mount Tur and then Praying for their (Yajuj and Majuj's) destruction.\n\n3) Reign as a Khalifh according to the Quran and Sunnah and elevate Islam.\n\nBack to content\n\nProphet Jesus's descent and\n\nthe killing of Dajjal\n\nThe Dajjal having failed to enter the holy city of Madinah will proceed to Syria gathering his forces on the way.\n\nImaam Mahdi will have arranged the Muslim army and will be on the verge of leading the Muslims in the morning prayer (Abu Umamah / Ibne-Majah) when Prophet Jesus will descend to the white Minaret (Nawwas-b-Samaan/Muslim) in the east of Damascus, wearing two garments died with saffron, placing his hands on the wings of two angels.\n\nAll those that are present will recognise him, as he will look exactly like the description of the Prophet . Resembling the Sahabi Urwa bin Masood (Abu- Huraira/ Muslim) the colour of his skin will be reddish white (Ibne Abbas/ Bukhari), he will be well built and his hair will be soft and reach his ears. When he lowers his head, beads of perspiration will fall from it and when he raises his head, beads like pearls will scatter from it. (Nawwas-b-Samaan/Muslim).\n\nEvery Kaafir who smells his sweet breath will die and his breath will reach as far as he can see. On seeing prophet Jesus . Imaam Mahdi will take a couple of steps backwards so Prophet Jesus can lead the prayer however Prophet Jesus will place his hands on the Imaam's shoulder and will say, ''Go forward and lead the prayer as the Iqamah was made for you'' thus Imaam Mahdi will lead the prayer. (Abu Umamah/ Ibne-Majah).\n\nAfter the prayer Prophet Jesus will say, ''Open the gate''. The gate will be opened and the Dajjal will be waiting behind it accompanied by an army of 70,000 Jews, each armed with a sword and shield. The Dajjal on seeing Prophet Jesus among the Muslims will begin to dissolve like salt in water and will begin to flee. Prophet Jesus will say to him, ''You will remain alive until I strike you with my spear, ''He will catch up with him at the Eastern gate of Ludd (Ludd is a mountain in Syria. Some say that it is a village in Jerusalem, and some say that it is a village in Palestine) and then Prophet Jesus will kill him with a small spear.\n\nThe Muslims will thereafter defeat and wipe out Dajjal's army. The Jews will not be able to hide behind anything on that day. Every time they try to hide behind a stone, a wall, a tree (except a boxthorn tree), or animal. Allah will make these things speak and they will say, ''O servant of Allah there is a Jew hiding behind me. come kill him.''\n\nBack to content\n\nThe Wisdom in the Descension of Prophet Jesus\n\nThe Ulama of the Ahlus - Sunnah have given many different reasons in the returning of Prophet Jesus to this world or the second time. A few are listed below:\n\n1) The Jews believe that they had killed Prophet Jesus , Allah will send him before the end of time to prove that they had not killed him and that he is alive. It is he who will kill the Jews and their leader Dajjal. (Fathul - Bari)\n\n2) Some Ulama have said that Prophet Jesus found many virtues of the followers of Prophet Muhammad in the bible and thus he prayed to Allah to make him amongst the Ummah of Prophet Muhammad . Allah answered his prayer and he will return for the second time as one of the followers of Prophet Muhammad . (Ibne-Khathir)\n\n3) It is the Law of Allah that anything that is created from the Earth has to be buried in the Earth and not the Heavens. Thus he will return to the Earth for the second time, kill the Dajjal, live for a period of time and then he will die a natural death and will be buried with the Prophet . (Ashratus-Sa'ah).\n\nBack to content\n\nProphet Jesus (as) and the Ya'juj Ma'juj (Gog Magog)\n\nA short period after Prophet Jesus has killed the Dajjal, the two mighty tribes of Yajuj and Ma'juj will appear, causing murder, pillage and devastation wherever they go. The emergence of Ya'juj and Ma'juj is also another major sign of Qiyamah. Through the invocation of Prophet Jesus they will be destroyed. (Nawwas-b-Samaan-Muslim).\n\nMore detail regarding them follows in the next sign.\n\nBack to content\n\nProphet Jesus as a Ruler\n\nThe Prophet said, \"By him whose hands my life is in, surely the son of Maryam will come down amongst you as a just ruler. He will break the cross, kill the pigs, and abolish the tax. Wealth will be in such abundance that none will care about it and a single prostration in a Prayer will be better than the world and all that is in it.\" (Abu Huraira/Bukhari, Muslim)\n\nThe above hadith clearly indicates that when Prophet Jesus returns to the world for the second time he will not reign as a Prophet no, will he bring a new Shariah or Deen, as Islam is the last religion, the Quran is the last book to be revealed and our Prophet Muhammad is the last Prophet. There is no Prophet to come after him and the Quran has made this fact very clear.\n\nAllah says in the Qur'an, \"Muhammad ( ) is not the father of any of you but is the Messenger of Allah and the last of the Prophets (Surah-Al-Ahzaab)\n\nWhen Prophet Jesus returns for the second time he will reign as a Khalifh and not a Prophet, follow the Qur'an and Sunnah and rule according to it. He will break the cross the Christians worship (indicating that he will bring Christianity to an end), elevate and spread Islam through out the world.\n\nHe will also kill the pig which the Christians consider Halaal to eat (and use) and abolish the Jizya (tax). In Prophet Jesus reign they will not pay this tax because he will not accept anything but Islam for the non believers and they will all believe in him. The Qur'an says, \"There is not a single section of the people of the book (Jews and Christians) but will believe in him and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.\" (Surah-An-Nisa)\n\nSecondly there will be an abundance in wealth, so much so that it will flow like water and there will not remain anybody who could be given this money, thus this tax will be abolished.\n\nBack to content\n\nBlessings at the time of Prophet\n\nJesus\n\nAll types of spiritual and worldly blessings will descend on Earth in his time. Wealth will flow like water, everyone will be independent and have surplus wealth and property to the extent that nobody will be in the need of Zakat and Sadaqa thus receiving of Zakat and Sadaqa will be discarded.\n\nAll hearts will be free from misery, envy, malice, and jealousy. Each harmful animal will be made harmless. Camels will graze with the lions and the cheetahs with cattle. A little girl will chase a lion and make it run away from her like children chasing a puppy and this lion will not harm her.\n\nVenom will be taken out from all venomous animals, a little boy will put his hand in a snake's mouth, but it will not harm him. The Jackal will live with the sheep and protect them as if it were a sheep dog. Peace, harmony and tranquillity will prevail in the world.\n\nPeople will be in complete agreement, wars will cease, the earth will be filled with peace like a silver basin and it will sprout with vegetation like at the time of Prophet Adam . The fertility of the land will increase to the extent that if a seed is planted in a rock, it will sprout. 700 mudd of wheat will sprout without ploughing the land. The earth will produce so much fruit that a large group of people will sit to eat a bunch of grapes or a pomegranate and they will be satisfied and use it's peel as an umbrella. There will also be blessing in milk. The milk of a single she camel will be sufficient to satisfy the hunger of a large group of people. A cow will produce what is sufficient for a tribe of people, and a sheep will produce milk, which is sufficient for a family of people. Horses will be cheap as they will be never ridden in war and bulls will be expensive, as they will be needed to plough the land.\n\nLife will be very pleasant and enjoyable after his descension and the Muslims will live in comfort in his reign as a Khalifh. (Nawwas-b-Sarnaan-Muslim/Abu Umamah-Ibne Majah)\n\nMarriage\n\nMany Ahadith specify that after his descension he will get married and have children and remain on the earth for a period of 19 years after his marriage. (Al-Fitan Nuaim bin Hammad).\n\nDeath\n\nProphet Jesus after his return to the Earth for a second time will live for a period of time (some scholars have mentioned 40 years in the light of a hadith which can be found in Abu Daud) and thereafter will die a natural death. The Muslims will perform his Janaza (funeral prayers) and according to the hadith narrated by Abdullah bin Amr in Mishkat he will be buried next to the Holy Prophet .\n\nSee also: The Prophet I'sa (Jesus) Comparative Analysis from an Islamic, Christian & Qadiani (Ahmadiyya) perspective by Shaykh Rashid Ali Seth\n\nBack to content\n\nWas Mirza Ghulam the Promised\n\nMessiah as he claimed?\n\nNourished by the British, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad the impostor from Qadiyan (Northern India) made many ridiculous claims in his lifetime. Besides claiming to be a Prophet and revivalist he also claimed to be the Mahdi and the Promised Messiah though he was nothing but a liar. Thus it was thought necessary to include a short summary which will act as a comparison between Mirza Ghulam and the real Messiah so that no Muslim is misled into believing him.\n\nBack to content\n\nMirza Ghulam and the True\n\nMessiah\n\nWe learn from the Hadith of Nawwas bin Sam'an (R.A), which can be found in Muslim and from the Hadith of Abu Umamah Al-Bahilee (R.A) which can be found in Ibne Maja the following regarding the Promised Messiah: -\n\n1) The Promised Messiah's name is Jesus and his mother's name was Maryam .\n\n2) The Mahdi and the Dajjal will already have appeared before his descension.\n\n3) He will descend from the heavens to the white minaret in the east of Damascus wearing two garments slightly dyed with Saffron and his hands will be placed on the wings of two angels.\n\n4) Every Kaafir who smells his breath will die and his breath will reach as far as he can see.\n\n5) He will kill the Dajjal at the Eastern gate of Ludd.\n\n6) The barbarous tribes of Yajuj and Ma'juj will appear in his time and the promised Messiah will take the believers to Mount Tur for their protection.\n\n7) He will elevate Islam by breaking the cross, bringing an end to Christianity.\n\n8) The Jews and Christians will believe in him before his death.\n\n9) He will kill the pig that the Christians consider halal to eat and the non- muslims will not have to pay tax.\n\n10) Wars will cease in his time, as everybody will be in complete agreement with one another.\n\n11) There will be so much wealth that the receiving of Sadaqa will be discarded as everybody will have enough wealth of his own.\n\n12) In his time all harmful animals will be made harmless and the venom will be taken out of all venomous animals. A child will put his hand in a snake's mouth and it will not harm him, a little girl will be able to chase a lion away and it will not harm her.\n\n13) The earth will sprout with vegetation and will produce fruit in such abundance that a large group of people will gather to eat a bunch of grapes or a pomegranate and it will suffice them.\n\n14) From the hadith of Abu Harith in Muslim we learn that the Promised Messiah will perform Hajj and Umrah from a place called Rawha.\n\n15) From the Hadith of Abdullah bin Amr we learn that he will he buried next to the Holy Prophet .\n\nMirza Ghulam fulfilled NONE of the above conditions. His name was Ghulam Ahmad and not Jesus; he was the son of Chiragh and not Maryam. The Mahdi and the Dajjal did not appear before him and thus there was no question about him killing the Dajjal. He did not descend from the heavens and nor did any Kaafir die from his breath. The tribes of Ya'juj and Ma'juj did not appear in his time nor did the Jews and Christians believe in him before his death. He did not elevate Islam but insulted it by claiming to be the Mahdi, the Messiah, and a Prophet. He did not kill the pig but enjoyed eating it. Wars did not cease in his time as the Muslims were fighting with the British in India. The receiving of Sadaqa was not discarded nor was the venom taken out of venomous animals in his time. He never performed Hajj or Umrah and he died in a toilet. I am sure by now you have easily come to the conclusion that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was not the Promised Messiah but an impostor and a liar, who's aim and purpose in life was to keep the British content.\n\nSee also: Who was the Imposter of Qadiyan? Qadiyanism-Ahmadiyya-Mirzaiyat\n\nBack to content\n\nYa'juj Ma'juj (Gog and Magog)\n\nThe emergence of the mighty tribes of Ya'juj and Ma'juj is also a major sign of Qiyamah.\n\nAllah says in the Qur'an, \"When Ya'juj and Ma'juj are let loose (from their Barrier) and they swiftly swarm from every mound\" (Surah Al-Anbiya)\n\nAllah says in the Qur'an, \" (Zulqarnain) said, 'This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the promise of my Lord comes, He shall level it down (the barrier) to the ground. And the promise of my Lord is ever true.\" (Surah Al-Kahf)\n\nZainab-b-Zahash says: \"Once the Prophet awoke from such a sleep that his face was red and these words were on his tongue, \"There is none worthy of worship but Allah. Destruction is upon the Arabs on account of that evil which has come close to them. Today a hole as big as this has opened in the wall of Yajuj and Ma'juj. (The Prophet indicated the size of the hole with his finger and thumb)\" (Bukhari/Muslim)\n\nIn the lengthy Hadith of Nawwas-b-Saman it has been mentioned, \"And Allah will send Yajuj and Ma'juj and they will come from every lofty place.\" (Muslim)\n\nBack to content\n\nYa'juj Ma'juj and Zulqarnain\n\nMany thousands of years ago the barbarous tribes of Yajuj and Ma'juj were imprisoned behind an iron wall built by Zulqarnayn. Referred to in the Qur'an in Surah Al-Kahf. Zulqarnayn was a Muslim Arab (fathul bari) who lived at the time of the Prophet Ibraheem and not Alexander the Great as it is commonly known. From amongst one of the four that ruled the entire world (the other three being Prophet Sulayman , Nimrod & Buktnasr) he was a pious and just king, provide with all forms of strength through which he was able to carry his conquests and missions.\n\nOnce he carried a mission in three directions, the far west, far east, and then in a northerly direction. Travelling first in the westerly direction, he conquered the lands he passed through establishing the laws of Allah therein until he reached the setting of the sun. There he met people that didn't believe in Allah. Given a choice of punishing them for their kufr or being lenient by inviting them first to Islam; he chose the latter and addressed them, ''Those evil-doers who do injustice to themselves by rejecting Allah will be punished by death in this world and the hereafter, the fire of hell is their abode. As for those who accept the invitation and believe in Allah they will be treated leniently and in the hereafter Jannah is their place of rest.''\n\nAfter the journey towards the west he made preparation for the journey towards the east. Conquering the lands he passed through, establishing he laws of Allah therein. He continued travelling in the easterly direction until he reached the rising of the sun. In this area of the east he saw a nation receiving the sunshine without any obstruction and they were dealt with like the previous people in the west.\n\nAfter the journey to the east he started his northern Journey, he kept on travelling until he reached the midst of two mountains, it was here he came across a tribe who complained to him about the tribes of Ya'juj and Ma'juj. Ya'juj and Ma'juj inhabited the land behind the mountains, plundered them, committed bloodshed, and then ran away. Observing Zulqarnain's power they asked to set a barrier in return for a wage for their protection from the disaster and bloodshed, which they often bore at the hands of Ya'juj Ma'juj. Refusing to accept any wealth he built an iron wall with their help which Ya'juj Ma'juj could not cross or pierce. (Qurtubi/ Ibne-Kathir)\n\nBack to content\n\nThe wall of Zulqarnain\n\nMany different opinions have been expressed as to the location of the iron wall of Zulqarnain. Having read many books, the best on the subject I came across was Sheikh Hifzur-Rahman's \"Stories of the Qur'an\" and thus have chosen to share a brief summary of what he has written.\n\nHe writes \"The Yajuj Ma'juj caused destruction and blood- shed in a vast area, and because of their oppression many barriers and walls were erected in different times and places by different kings. Four being the most famous:\n\n1) The Great Wall of China which was built by the Chinese King Fagfor 3460 years after Prophet Adam was put on the Earth.\n\n2) The wall in central Asia near Bukhara and Tirmidh in a place called Derbent.\n\n3) The wall in Dagistan Russia also known as Derbent near the Caspian sea.\n\n4) The wall which is in the westerly direction to the third in the region of the Caucasus.\n\nBecause these walls were built for one purpose and are all situated in the North, it has always been very difficult to determine exactly the wall built by Zulqarnain.\"\n\nHe further writes, \"The biggest out of the four is the great wall of China and nobody is of the opinion that this is the wall built by Zulqarnain as it is in the easterly direction while the Qur'an indicates the wall of Zulqarnain is in the Northerly direction.\"\n\nThus leaving walls 2, 3, and 4.\n\nHe writes, \"Historians like Masoodi, Istakhari and Hamawi are of the opinion that the wall of Zulqamain is wall number 3 or 4. Those that have said it is wall number two have confused the issue due to the location of Derbent which is near Bukhara and also in Degistan.''\n\nHe finally writes, ''Out of two, the historians are of the opinion that it is wall 3 or 4, the master of hadith Allama Anwar Shah Kashmiri in his book Aqeeda-tul-Islam holds the opinion that the wall of Zulqarnain is wall number 4, the one in the region of Caucasus.' (Stories of the Qu'ran)\n\nAfter this short summary I find myself inclined to Allama Aloosi's opinion I conclude with his words, ''We do not know the location of this wall and it is very probable that great seas and mountains stand between us and the wall, and between Ya'juj Ma'juj and the rest of the world.''\n\nBack to content\n\nTrying to break free\n\nAbu Huraira (R.A.) narrated that every day Ya'juj Ma'juj try to break free through the wall of Zulqarnain until they reach the end of it to the extent that they could actually see the light on the other side. They then return home saying, ''We will break through tomorrow. '' However, Allah causes the wall to revert to its original thickness and the next day they start all over again. This process continues each day as long as Allah wills for them to remain imprisoned. When Allah wishes for them to be released, then at the end of that day they will say, ''If Allah wills, we will break through tomorrow.'' The next day they will find the wall as they left it the previous day and after breaking through the rest they will escape. (Ahmed, Tirmidhi, Ibne Majah)\n\nNote: Some ulama have written that this hadith is weak and has been taken from the Jews as it contradicts with the verse from the Qur'an, ''They are not able to cross it or pierce it.'' ( Surah Al-Kahf)\n\nHowever, if found that it is a Marfoo hadith, it still does not contradict the Qur'an as the Qur'an is referring to the time Zulqarnain built the wall and secondly the word ''naqb'' means a complete hole through which they are able to break free.\n\nThe great master of Hadith Ibne Hajr al-Askalani giving reference of Ibne Hibban and Abd- b-Humaid has mentioned this Hadith and not raised any doubt or indicated that this hadith is not Marfoo but positively mentioned that Ibne Arabi has said three miracles are evident from this Hadith and then mentioned the three miracles:\n\n1) It never occurs to these tribes that they must continue work throughout the night. After all, they are in such large numbers that they can easily delegate the work amongst themselves and work in shifts. However, Allah does not allow this thought to occur to them.\n\n2) It does not occur to them that they can merely cross the mountain or scale the wall, which they can do through the aid of equipment they possess in large numbers. According to a narration by Wahb-b-Munabbah it is known that these tribes are agriculturists and artisans possessing various types of equipment.\n\n3) The thought of saying, \"Insha-allah (if Allah wills)\" never enters their minds and it will only occur to them when Allah wills that they be released.(Fathul-Bari)\n\nBack to content\n\nMyths\n\nMany myths surround Ya'juj and Ma'juj. One being that the common people believe that Ya'juj and Ma'juj are not human beings but some kind of third being. How interesting it may be to believe that they are a third being, the reality is that they are human beings just like yourself and I, constitute nine-tenths of mankind and are from the progeny of Prophet Nuh .\n\nThe Holy Prophet said, \"Ya'juj and Ma'juj are the children of Prophet Adam and not one will die until thousand are born to him.'' (Abdullah-b-Amr/Fathul-Bari).\n\nThe Messenger of Allah said, \"Allah divided mankind into ten parts. Nine tenths constitute Ya'juj and Ma'juj while the remaining one tenth constitutes the rest of mankind.\" (Abdullah-b-Amr/Fathul-Bari).\n\nHadrat Abu Saeed Khudri narrates that the Messenger of Allah said, \"On the Day of Judgement, Allah will tell Adam to pick out the Jahanamis from his progeny. Adam will ask, \"O Allah, who are they?\" Allah will say,\"999 out of 1000 are Jahanamis while the one is a Jannati.\" On hearing this the Sahaba over taken by fear asked, \"Who will the ONE Jannati be?\" The Prophet replied, \"Do not grieve the 999 will be Yajuj Ma'juj while you will be the one Jannati.\" (Bukhari/Muslim)\n\nA second myth is that people believe that Ya'juj and Ma'juj were created from Adam without Eve (Hawa) on the basis of Ka'ab's narration, \"They are from the children of Adam. That is Adam had a wet dream, the semen intermingled with the earth and they were created from that Earth.\" (Fathul-Bari)\n\nIt should be noted that this narration is very weak and objectionable as it is proven from many Ahadith that the Prophets of Allah do not have wet dreams because the wet dream is from the devil and the Prophets of Allah are protected from the devil.\n\nSecondly there is a hadith which can be found in Fathul-Bari that clearly states that they are from the progeny of Prophet Nuh . The Prophet Nuh was definitely from the children of Adam and Eve .\n\nBack to content\n\nPhysical Appearance of Ya'juj and Ma'juj\n\nThere are many different narration's regarding their appearance. These different narration's suggest that Yajuj and Ma'juj are of three types.\n\n1) Some are as tall as the tree Arz - that is 120 ft.\n\n2) Some are four arm lengths tall and four arm lengths wide.\n\n3) Some spread one ear to sleep on and cover themselves with the other. Some also state that they are two spans tall and the tallest amongst them are three spans. (Fathul-Bari)\n\nIt should be noted that all the narration's above are weak and should not be taken. The authentic Ahadith like the Hadith of Nawwas-b- Saman in Muslim suggests that they are very strong and powerful people whom nobody has the power to fight. It has also been narrated that they have wide faces, small eyes, grey hair and their faces are like shields covered with skin. (Musnad Ahmad)\n\nBack to content\n\nEmergence of Ya'juj Ma'juj before Qiyamah\n\nA short period after killing the Dajjal, Prophet Jesus will be informed of the release of Ya'juj and Ma'juj. Obeying Allah's command He will take the Muslims to Mount Tur for their protection as nobody will be able to kill the Ya'juj Ma'juj. Ya'juj and Ma'juj will come forth from every lofty place causing destruction and bloodshed wherever they go. Their first batch will come to lake Tiberias and drink all of its water. Their last batch will come to it and say, \"There was once water in this lake.\"\n\nMarching on, carrying out pillage and murder to their left and right they will come to mount of Khamr (a mountain in Jerusalem)\n\nand say, \"We have killed the inhbitant of the Earth, let us now kill the inhabitants of heaven.\" Thus they will shoot their arrows towards the sky. Allah will return the arrows covered with blood and these fools will think they have killed those in the heaven. Mean while Prophet Jesus and his companions will remain confined until the head of an ox becomes more valuable than 100 gold coins. Prophet Jesus and his companions will pray for their destruction. Allah, answering their prayer will send insects upon the necks of Ya'juj Ma'juj and in the morning they will be found dead like one dead man. In the narration of Abu Saeed al- Khudri which can be found in Tadkhira of Imam Qurtubi, it has been mentioned; the believers not being able to hear their noise that morning will say \"Will anybody sacrifice his life and see what the situation is.\" Volunteering, a believer will come down the mountain thinking that he will never return . However to his suprise he will find that they are all dead and he will shout, \"Good news! Your enemy has died,\"\n\nProphet Jesus and his companions will come down but will find that the earth is full with their stinking corpses. Yet again Prophet Jesus and his companions will turn to Allah and pray. Allah will send birds with necks like the necks of Bactarian camels which will carry the corpses and throw them where Allah wishes. Thereafter, Allah will send rain and the earth will be cleaned. (Nawwas-b-Samaan/Muslim)\n\nBack to content\n\nLandslides\n\nThere will be three landslides before Qiyamah like never seen before. One in the East, one in the West and one in Arabia. The Earth will swallow everything above it and as a result, many people will die. However, everybody will be raised according to his intentions. This will take place when evil prevails.\n\nHudhaifa-b-Usaid al-Ghifari reported: Allah's Messenger came to us all of a sudden as we were (busy in discussion) He said: \"What are you discussing?\" They (the companions) said: \"We are talking about the last hour.\" Thereupon he said: \"It will not come until you see ten signs before it, He made a mention of the Smoke, the Dajjal, the Beast, the Rising of the Sun from the West, the Descent of Jesus, Son of Mary , the emergence of Ya'juj and Ma'juj, and Landsliding will occur in three places, One in the East, one in the West and one in Arabia at the end of which a fire would burn forth from Yemen, which would drive people to the place of their assembly.\" (Muslim)\n\nUmme Salmah reported that I heard the Messenger of Allah saying, \"After me there will be a landslide in the East, a landslide in the West and a landslide in the Peninsula of Arabia.\" I asked, \"Oh Messenger of Allah will the Earth give way, though there are some pious people above it.\" The Prophet replied, \"When its inhabitants exceed doing bad and evil.\" (Tabrani Fil-Awsat)\n\nBack to content\n\nThe Smoke\n\nAllah says, ''So thou wait for the day when the heaven shall bring a smoke manifest surrounding the people this is a painful Chastisement.'' ( Surah-Dhukan)\n\nWasila-Bb-l-Asqa reported, ''I heard the Prophet saying, ''The final hour will not come until you see ten signs. '' (one of the ten mentioned was the smoke) (Muslim)\n\nIt is clearly evident from the above verse and Ahadith that the smoke is a major sign of Qiyamah. It will rise and cover the whole world. The smoke will affect both the believers and non-belivers alike remaining for a period of 40 days and night. The believers will be affected a little as if suffering from cold while the smoke will enter the brains of the non-belivers and make them unconscious1.\n\nFootnote:1) Hudaifa-b-al-Yaman/Tabari.\n\nBack to content\n\nIbne Masood's Opinion\n\nIbne Masood's (RA) opinion regarding the verse in which the smoke has been mentioned is that he strongly claims that this is not the smoke which is described as one of the signs of Qiyamah. On the other hand the Holy Prophet being disgusted with the vexation and rebellion of the Quraish had invoked a famine of 7 years for them like that which was set upon the Egyptians in the days of Prophet Yusuf and as such the famine befell them to the starvation of the Makkans, who were so much constrained that they were forced to eat off corpses, hides and skins of animals.\n\nIn short, the people of Makkah began to starve. As a rule in intense hunger and ceaseless drought, a kind of smoke is seen in the space between the heaven and the Earth, and also the dust, which rises into the sky from the Earth especially on long rainless days, looks like a smoke to the naked eyes. That thing is here described as a smoke. (Bukhari)\n\nIbne Masood reported, \"Five things have passed, the smoke, the defeat of the Romans, the splitting of the moon, the defeat of the infidels in the Battle of Badr and the punishment.\" (Bukhari)\n\nFirstly it should be noted that Ibne Kathir writes that from amongst the Sahaba Ibne Masood is the only one that holds this view. The majority of Ulama in the light of the above and many other Ahadith are of the opinion that the smoke referred to in the verse is the same which is to precede Qiyamah. This has also been related as being the opinion of Ibne Abbas and Hadrat Ali. (Ibne Kathir)\n\nAli (RA) said, \"The verse of Dukhan has not taken place\" (Ibne Abe Hatim)\n\nIbne Abbas, Ibne Umar, Hasan, and others said, ''The smoke referred to in the verses is the smoke before Qiyamah which will enter in the ears of the Kuffar and the hypocrites and will affect the Muslims like a cold. The whole world will be like a house on fire. It has not happened. It is to happen.'' (Lawami-ul-Anwaar)\n\nAbdullah-b-Abu-Mulaika narrated that I went one morning to Ibne Abbas. He said, ''I didn't sleep all night. ''I asked, ''Why?'' He replied, ''They informed me that a star with a tail appeared. I feared that the smoke may follow and thus I didn't sleep till it was morning.'' (Tabari / Ibne Kathir)\n\nIt is clear from the above narration, which is authentic, as Ibne Kathir has mentioned that Ibne Abbas was of the opinion that the smoke is from among the awaited signs. (Ibne Kathir)\n\nSecondly Ibne Kathir writes that Ibne Masood doesn't relate what he has said back to the Prophet while the opinion that the smoke is from among the awaited signs is related back to the Prophet and so the principal of the Hadith is quite clear, ''That which is related back to the Prophet is given priority over that which is not.'' (An-Nihaya)\n\nBack to content\n\nRising of the Sun from the West\n\nThe rising of the sun from the west is also a major sign of Qiyamah proven by the Qur'an and Sunnah.\n\nAllah says in the Qur'an, \"The day when some signs of your Lord will come, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his faith.\" (Surah Al-An'aam)\n\nThe verse is referring to the rising of the sun from the west, as is the opinion of the majority of the commentators. (Tabari/Ibne Kathir)\n\nImam Tabari, after mentioning the different opinions of the commentators writes, \"The most correct opinion in regards to the meaning of this verse is that what is apparent from the reports narrated from the Prophet that he said, \"(lmaan will be of no benefit) when the sun rises from the west.\" (Tabari)\n\nAbu Huraira reported that the Holy Prophet said, \"Hasten to do good deeds before six (things happen) :Rising of the sun from the west.\" (Mishkat)\n\nBack to content\n\nWhere the Sun goes\n\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abu Zar that the Messenger of Allah one day said, \"Do you know where the Sun goes?\" They replied, \"Allah and his apostle know best.\" He (The Holy Prophet ) observed, \"Verily it (the sun) glides till it reaches its resting place under the throne. Then it falls prostrate and remains there until it is told, 'Rise up and go to the place whence you came' and it goes back.\"\n\nThen it continues emerging out from its rising place and then glides till it reaches its place of rest under the throne where it falls prostrate and remains in that state until it is told, 'Rise up and return to the place whence you came.' And it returns and emerges out of it's rising place and then it glides (in such a normal way) that the people do not discern anything (unusual in it) till it reaches its resting place under the throne. Then it would be said to it, 'Rise up and emerge from the place of your setting,' and it will rise from the place of its setting.\" The Messenger of Allah said \"Do you know when it will happen? It will happen at the time when faith will not benefit anyone who has not previously believed or has derived no good from the faith.\" (Muslim)\n\nWorshippers during the night will remain till the sun rises from the West\n\nAbdullah-b-Abu-Owfa reported that I heard the Messenger of Allah say, \"Verily a night will come upon the people which is equivalent of three of your nights. When it comes those that engage themselves in worship during the night will recognise it. One of them will stand in prayer, read his Hizb (The normal amount he has made the habit of reading) and then go to sleep. Thereafter he will wake up (for the second time) read his Hizb in prayer and go to sleep. While this is the situation the people will begin to shout, scream and call one another. They will say, \"What's this?\" With fear they will run to the mosque. To their surprise they will see that the sun has risen from the west. When it reaches the middle of the sky it will return and set in the west.\" He said , \"That is when Imaan will not benefit anyone (who brings faith after seeing the sign).\" (An-Nihaya)\n\nBack to content\n\nEveryone will bring faith in seeing the sign\n\nNarrated by Abu Huraira (R.A), \"Allah's Messenger said, 'The hour will not come until the sun rises from the west; and when the people see it, then whoever will be living on the surface of the Earth will have faith, and that is (the time) when no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before.\" (Bukhari)\n\nThe real basis of faith is that man believes in the unseen realities on the authority of the Messenger of Allah . But when Allah manifests such startling and visible signs which herald the approach of the last hour and by which the veil of the unseen is rent asunder, then the belief becomes meaningless. The rising of the sun from the west will be of great disturbance to nature and will shake the mind of every man and awaken him to see for himself the great power of Allah. At this time the belief of the unseen will lose its importance.\n\nBack to content\n\nDoor of Repentance Closed\n\nOnce the sun has risen from the west the door of repentance will be closed and will remain closed until the Day of Judgement. If any infidel embraces Islam or any Muslim repents and seeks forgiveness for his sins any time after the rising of the sun from the west till the Day of Judgement, it will not be accepted.\n\nThe Messenger of Allah said, \"Verily Allah extends his hand at night so that the sinners of the day may repent and verily extends his hand during the day so that the sinners of the night may repent. (He will keep on doing this) as long as the sun does not rise from the west.\" (Abu-Musa al-Ashari/ Muslim)\n\nThe Prophet said, \"Allah has built a door of repentance in the west the breadth of which is seventy years and it will not close as long as the sun does not rise from the west.\" (Safwan-b-Assal / Tirmidhi)\n\nThe above Ahadith have clearly specified that the extreme limit of the acceptance of repentance is till the sun rises from the west. Once it has risen it will not be accepted.\n\nIbne Hajar has mentioned many Ahadith which prove that the door of repentance will remain closed till the Day of Judgement and thereafter writes, ''These narration's give strength to one another, agreeing completely in that when the sun rises from the west the door of repentance will be closed and will not be opened thereafter. And this is not specific with that day but will prolong till the Day of Judgement.'' (Fathul- Bari)\n\nBack to content\n\nThe Beast\n\nThe Beast is also a major sign of Qiyamah. Allah says in the Qur'an, \"And when the word is fulfilled concerning them. We shall bring forth a Beast of the Earth to speak unto them because mankind had no faith in our revelation.\" (Surah An-Naml)\n\nAbdullah-b-Umar said, \"I memorised a Hadith from the Messenger of Allah which I have not forgotten. I heard the Messenger of Allah saying, 'The first of the signs that will come is the rising of the sun from the place of its setting and the emergence of the Beast upon the people. Whichever of these two occurs before the other then the other is right behind it.\" (Muslim)\n\nCommentating on the above verse Ibne Kathir has said that the beast will appear very near the end of time. When disintegration, corruption, kufr and evil prevail, commands of Allah are ignored, the Deen changed and made a mockery of, it is then Allah will take out the Beast from the earth. (Ibne Kathir)\n\nImam Hakim in the light of the above Hadith has said that the rising of the sun from the west will take place before the emergence of the Beast. The Beast will appear on the same day the sun has risen from the west or very soon thereafter. Ibne Hajar after quoting Imam Hakim mentions, \"The wisdom in the Beast appearing after the sun has risen from the west is that the door of repentance will close at the time the sun rises from the west. Thus the Beast will emerge to distinguish the believers from the non-believers completing the aim of closing the door of repentance.\" (Fathul-Bari)\n\nTask\n\nThe task of the Beast will be to distinguish the believers from the non-believers, with Prophet Moosa's staff it will draw a line on the forehead of every believer whereby his face will become bright and luminous and with the ring of Sulaman it will seal the nose of every non-believer where by his whole face will become black. Thus there will be complete distinction between the Muslim and non-Muslirn, so that if many parties sit at a dinner table, the Muslim and non-Muslirn will be distinguished. (Abu Huraira-Musnad Ahmad/Tirmidhi)\n\nThe Beast will also talk to people. It will say, \"Mankind had no faith in our revelations.\" (Ibne Kathir)\n\nPlace of emergence\n\nMany opinions have been expressed as regards to the place the Beast will come out from. A few are listed:\n\n1) It will come out from Al-Masjid Al-Haraam in Makkah. This opinion is based on the hadith reported by Tabrani on the authority of Hudhaifa-b-Usaid.\n\n2) It will come out three times, from some desert and then go back into hiding, then from some village and finally from Al-Masjid Al-Haraam.\n\nThere are many other opinions most of them report that it will come out from the Haram of Makkah. (See Tadkirah and Al-Isha'ah)\n\nBack to content\n\nNature of the Beast\n\nMany different opinions have been expressed as to the nature of the Beast and the type of animal it is. A few are shared and explained.\n\n1) Some Ulama are of the opinion that the Beast to come before the end of time is the very animal which has been mentioned in the Hadith of Fatimah-b-Qais. Known as the Jassasa (spy) seen by Tamim Dari and his companions from the tribes of Lakhm and Juzaam on the same Island as the Dajjal. This is related of being the opinion of the Sahabi Abdullah-b-Amr-b-al-Aas. (Nawawee's commentary on Muslim)\n\nFatimah-bin-Qais reported, \"I heard the proclaimer of the Messenger of Allah proclaiming (for) 'Congregational Prayer'. I came out of the mosque and prayed with the Prophet . When he finished his prayer, he sat upon the pulpit smiling and said, 'Let every man remain in his seat.' Then he said, 'Do you know why I have called you together?' They replied, 'Allah and his Messenger know best.' He said, 'By Allah, I have not called you together for hope or for fear, but I have called you together because Tamim Dari a Christian came and embraced Islam. He narrated a story to me which agreed with the account I have given to you about the Dajjal (Anti-Christ). He informed me that he had embarked upon a sea-boat with thirty men of Lakhm and Jozam. Then the sea waves played with them for a month and threw them onto an island when the sun was about to set. They sat in a small side boat and entered the Island. A beast with very coarse hair met them. They could not tell its front from its back due to its excessive hair. They asked, 'Woe to thee! Who art thou?\" It replied, 'I am a spy. Go to the man in the monastery, as he is eager to have your information.' He said, 'When it named a man for us, we fled away from it lest it might be the devil.' We hurriedly went on till we entered the monastery and found a big-bodied man whom we did never see before. He was firmly tied up, his hands tied to his neck, the place between his knees, and joints tied up with iron chains.\" (Muslim)\n\nCamel\n\n2) Some scholars are of the opinion that it is the young of the she camel of the Prophet Salih . Imam Al-Qurtubi holds the same opinion, he writes in his commentary of the Qur'an, \"The first opinion (regarding the Beast) is that it is the young of the she-camel of the Prophet Salih . This is the most correct view and opinion. Allah knows best.\"\n\nBack to content\n\nOpinion Explained\n\nThe people of Thamud were Arabs who lived a couple of hundred years after the Prophet Noah in a place called Hijr which today is known as Madaain Salih in the North of Arabia near Tabuk. Blessed in provisions and livelihoods their land was fertile with green gardens and running springs and they skilfully carved spacious houses out of mountains. They were ungrateful to Allah as they worshiped the stone idols they carved with their very own hands. Thus Allah honoured Salih from amongst them with Prophethood and sent him as a Messenger to the people of Thamud to bring them out of darkness into light. Salih conveyed the message of Allah day and night and called them to the worship of Allah with wisdom and kind-heartedness but the people of Thamud decided to remain blind. Finally, they like the communities before them asked to see a miracle. They said, ' O Salih take out a ten month pregnant she-camel from a mountain which then gives birth to a young that has the same body and stature as the mother.' Having seen the miracle they refused to believe. The she-carnel was a sign of Allah, very large and unusual in form and the people were warned that they would be destroyed if they treated it with evil. All the other animals were afraid of Prophet Salih's camel and would run away whenever she and its young came to drink water. Thus bounds were arranged. However, after a very short period they broke the agreement and decided to kill the camel of Allah. A group hid waiting for the camel on its return from the well with its child. Shooting an arrow they injured it and finally killed it paving the way for the destruction of the entire community. On seeing its mother in trouble the child fled to the mountains and disappeared. This young is referred to in the second opinion.\n\nExtraordinary Animal\n\n3) Some are of the opinion that the Beast to come is an animal that has features of many different animals. The same is reported from Abu Zubair. Describing the Beast he has reported that, \"Its head is like that of a bull, eyes like that of a pig, ears like that of an elephant, horns like that of a stag, neck like that of an ostrich, chest like a lion, colour like that of a tiger, flanks like that of a cat, tail like that of a ram, feet and legs like that of a camel and a distance of 12 cubits between every two joints.\" (Tadhkirah)\n\nBack to content\n\nSnake\n\nSome scholars are of the opinion it is the Snake which guarded the Holy Ka'bah. Imam Al-Qurtubi relates this as being the opinion of Ibne Abbas. (Al-Qurtubi)\n\nObeying Allah's command the Prophet Ibraheem with the help of his son Ismail built the Holy Ka'bah. He dug a well inside the Holy Ka'bah which was to the right of who entered it and acted as a safe to all the gifts that were presented to the Ka'bah which were kept inside it. At the time of Jurhum the gold and silver were stolen many times from the Kabah thus the tribe of Jurhum decided to choose a man amongst them to keep guard. Unfortunately, one day the guard himself decided to steal the gifts of the Kabah. Taking the opportunity as it came he climbed down the well and began to gather what he could in a piece of cloth. While he was busy Allah sent a stone on him, which closed the well and thus he was unable to escape. From that day Allah sent a snake to guard the Ka'bah. The snake lived in the well guarding the gifts of the Ka'bah for over 500 years. Exposed to the wearing factors of nature the walls of the Ka'bah at the time of Quraish (slightly before the time Prophet received Prophethood) had become weak and part of the covering had also burnt, thus the Quraish decided to rebuild the Ka'bah. However, the snake prevented them from demolishing the Holy Ka'bah every time they tried. Finally they stood at the Place of Ibrahim and prayed, \"Oh Allah if you are happy in its rebuilding then make it possible and take care of this snake.\" Allah sent an eagle which took the snake towards Ajyaad. This snake is referred to in the forth opinion. (Tarikh-Makka)\n\nMany other opinions have been expressed as regards to the nature of the Beast. However, finding myself inclined towards Abu Amr Uthman Ibne Sa'd al-Mukri ad-Dani's opinion I conclude with his words, \"There are many narration's in regards to the physical description, length, and nature of the Beast but most of these are Mawqoof on the Sahaba or those after them. As for those that are Marfoo only a few are sound thus we cannot assert anything in regard of its description and nature except that which is proven from the authentic Marfoo narration's and that it is a huge creature that will come out from the Earth, a beast other than man, nobody will be able to escape it. It will stamp the Muslim by writing 'believer' between his eyes, and stamp the non-Muslim by writing Kafir between his eyes.\" (As-Sunan Al-Waridah Fil-Fitan)\n\nBack to content\n\nThe Fire\n\nThe last major sign to appear before the Day of Judgement is the fire which will come out from the Yemen and gather the people in the place of their assembly.\n\nIn the Hadith of Hudaifa-b-Usaid regarding the Major signs the Prophet said, \"At the end of which a fire would burn out from Yemen and would drive people to the place of their assembly.\" (Muslim)\n\nNarrated by Abu Huraira (R.A) the Prophet said, \"The people will be gathered in three ways:\n\n1.The first way will be of those who will wish or have a hope (for paradise) and will have a fear (of punishment).\n\n2.The second batch will be those who will gather riding, two on a camel or three on a camel or ten on a camel.\n\n3.The third batch will be the rest of the people who will be urged to gather by the fire which will accompany them at the time of their afternoon nap and stay with them where they will spend the night, and will be with them in the morning wherever they may be then, and will be with them in the afternoon wherever they may be then.
