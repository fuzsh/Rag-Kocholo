        "text": "The Story Differs from the Comic but Season 3 Ruined the Whole Thing**\n\nI'll give it a rating of 7 because of the interesting first season (not including season 2 and especially not season 3) and the good special effects. Otherwise, I would give it a rating of 5 for the storyline.\n\nSeason 1 of this series is quite similar to the comic, with a few new characters and changes in character details, but it's still interesting. The series doesn't explain in depth how human desires turn people into monsters, but it's still worth watching.\n\nSeason 2 starts off well but quickly gets filled with unnecessary scenes and characters. These new characters don't add much to the story and take away from the interesting development of the existing ones.\n\nHowever, Season 3 is where things go really wrong. Like many Korean sci-fi and mystery dramas, it fails to wrap up the story in a clear, logical way. The Main enemy monster died in unrealistic and silly ways. If it could be defeated so easily, why wasn't it done sooner? The idea of new Neo-humans is also confusing and not well explained.\n\nThe main theme of \"Sweet Home\" becomes unclear. The only somewhat developed relationship is between Cha and Eun Lee. Many characters from Season 1, whose relationships were built up nicely, are ignored or poorly developed in season 2 and 3, favor of new, less interesting characters with shallow backstories.\n\nIn summary, while the first season is promising, the next seasons, especially Season 3, fall short and end up ruining the series.\n\nIf you READ the comic, the movie is A BIG FAILURE!\n\nI don't understand why some people gave this movie good ratings because it's really that BAD. Even majority film reviewers on youtube also said this movie was good. The FACT is, the cast doesn't match the comic characters, and the jokes are flat. They even changed the character almost completely. A movie based on a popular Indonesian webtoon should be able to deliver a live-action adaptation that closely mirrors the comic, similar to existing adaptations like \"One Piece.\" The cast in those films closely resembles the comic characters.\n\nIn my opinion, the Indonesian webtoon movie \"TERLALU TAMPAN,\" which has already been released in theaters, is much better than \"Pasutri Gaje.\" The cast in \"TERLALU TAMPAN\" closely matches the comic characters, and the story is engaging despite not being covered in the comic. Conversely, \"Pasutri Gaje\" follows the comic's storyline but is ruined by an ill-fitting cast and characters that don't align with the original comic with cranky jokes. It's disappointing.\n\nA MORON photo journalist WANNABE\n\nI was hoping to see the civil war conflicts and how war photo journalistic works! But what I saw just an action movie with a stupid girl in the plot.\n\nThis girl makes the movie not make any sense at all. Where on earth there are script writers who STILL created these SILLY characters and story! NONE of senior journalists would take this wannabe photo journalist in the team even protect her during the battle combats in REALITY. The girl and NO meaningful story only pure action and stupidity definitely will make you nuts watching this movie. In the beginning was okay but in the middle to the end is getting more and more stupidity and worse! Even No message about journalistic at all...!!\n\nOVERRATED horror movie!!\n\nIt's said that this movie is based on a true story, but the exaggerations make it difficult to take seriously. The plot revolves around an old man who follows Mr. Hao to save a girl from a pocong (an Indonesian ghost). However, the pocong killed the old man, raising questions about the authenticity of the story. If this were true, why don't the police investigate Mr. Hao?\n\nThe story starts with promise, capturing the audience's interest. However, it quickly loses coherence midway. The jumpscares are excessive and rely on outdated horror tropes. For example, there's a scene where a car stops in the forest at night, the passengers find themselves alone, and the pocong suddenly appears, scaring them before the old man dies. This scene, like many others, feels cheesy and uninspired.\n\nA good true horror story but they made the story such a rubbish.\n\nThey should do MORE and MORE RESEARCH..!!\n\nThe idea of this movie is interesting and based on true event but many things are NOT accurate. The interpreter spoke really good english with American accent, the Afghan wife was look like American wife, they wanted to create a story about Afghan family but they turned it into American family! They should go to Afghanistan and see how Afghans live there! Thus, all the team members were dead while these 2 men were alive running here and there so ridiculous. They wanted to make this movie intense but it's just a JOKE! Especially this Afghan interpreter acted like an expert soldier, just like Rambo! In fact many interpreters there were just ordinary people. Even many Taliban soldiers are actually untrained, they just know how to use guns and ready to die! Have no idea why this movie got so manu good reviews, the reviewers definitely don't update themselves on what happened in Afghanistan.\n\nSeason 1 was so good but S2 and S3 were disappointment!!\n\nI do really loved this series when the first time I watched it, the idea was not that fresh anymore it's about switched at birth but how the story played out was so interesting with strong characters development. The acting of the characters and scripts were good and funny. I like the idea that the movie was about family and friendship. The ending of season 1 rose many questions and curiosity about what would happen next.\n\nSeason 2 brought new conflicts with very weak ending, not as funny as season 1, the ending was so absurd, not logic, and lost the identity of the movie. It continued to season 3, the story was not focus on the family again it all about the romantic relationship between Ana and Mariana that happened forcefully! Just like the script writers wanted to make them as a couple out of no where! And they broke the relationship between Mariana and another man with a rubbish reason just to make Ana and Mariana to be together! It was the most absurd ending that I have ever seen in a family series, it ruined a beautiful idea that the movie had in season 1 about family and friendship. The relationship between Ana and Mariana should remain as best friends and co parents for their 2 daughters because it's all the movie about since season 1 and they should have brought up more family issues rather than more focusing on romantic relationship between Ana and Mariana and how Ana questioned her sexual interest identity just like a teenager made me lost interest to watch the episode because the movie it should be about family not about sexual identity crisis! And because the writers spent to much episodes only for romantic story of Anna and Mariana so how they solve the problem at the end of the season was so terrible! They fasten the pace, shortened the problem solving, like everything good happened easily and smoothly in one last episode! It made the ending of season 3 was so cheap!\n\nYou expected MORE but you got \"Meh\"\n\nI am a fan of Knives Out first movie, it was witty, brilliant, and full of mystery. But the second movie was a garbage! The characters just acted silly, like it was in \"Scary Movie\" not \"Knives Out\" or other detective movies. In the beginning of the movie was okay, in the middle was okay but the climax and how they revealed everything was a completely a JOKE! Extremely ridiculous!\n\nHow on earth he had a red ketchup in his pocket?! How on earth she was supposed to be dead but she survived because of a notebook!!\n\nIf they didn't like her, how on earth that man even invited her to the party?!\n\nIf he was a stupid man, how on earth, she offered a partnership and he became a CEO?!\n\nAnd the ending was just like a copy paste of READY OR NOT's iconic ending!\n\nThe second movie is just a SILLY comedy detective story!\n\nStarted as a Masterpiece and Ended as a Failure!!\n\nAfter watching the entire series, I came to the conclusion that the series is actually not that good. It's overrated!\n\nThe first season deserved to get 10 out of 10, while the rest of the season is just okay, and the last season is the most ludicrous season ever and has an identity crisis.\n\nBreaking Bad began with a strong scenario, a lot of smart humor, great acting, and interesting stories, but as the season progressed, there were a lot of flaws here and there, especially in terms of the character's development and appearance.\n\nThe writers need to learn more about human psychology to make the plot make sense rather than just make it as intense and brutal as possible. They should learn how the situation would play out in the family in real life, and make the characters develop naturally.\n\nThe story's timeframe in Breaking Bad was also established at around a year, despite the fact that it took nearly five years to shoot the entire season. Thus, we can clearly see the drastic aging of the characters. Especially on Walt's son, Flynn ( Walter Jr.) and Jesse Pinkman, which is ridiculous.\n\nI know that many people want to make a series have a jaw-dropping ending, but it doesn't mean you can screw the story and characters up in order to end the series just like the writers of Breaking Bad did at the end of the season. Many scenes and plot in season 5 were not solid and logical. The plot of Breaking Bad used to build the ending has many irrational scenes, stories, and dialogue. At the end, the writers of Breaking Bad just wanted to make the main character into a badass hero, and the other characters blamed him for everything bad that happened and portrayed him as a supervillain, just like they had never known him in person, and it was only him who committed sins.\n\nInteresting story but worse execution\n\nThey created a new story which is quite different from the original Anime but it has strong potential to develop and is interesting.\n\nThe thing that I don't like is the way they execute the story and characters. The main leads are completely different from the Anime but they dressed them up exactly like the Anime. The plot twist was good but the flow was very rough and it didn't go smoothly and most of the time it didn't make sense. It just like they want to tell many things and finish all things in 2 hours. The film also didn't give Pokemon characters chance to develop, they were just like a cameo in this film while there are many interesting Pokemon characters in the film but they did nothing.\n\nMany of useless characters too like the Japanese detective, I even didn't know why this character was exist while had some useless scenes.\n\nThe Best story but not for kid!\n\nThis is the BEST story ever among all series, but yes this story is NOT for children. The children will not understand how the world works when the young replace the old and the old are supposed to give space and support the youth. This is the fact, how good the old but they cannot beat the youth in term of physical matter. Cars film tells about the athlete's life when the senior have to retire when they get old. It's normal but children cannot accept this easily of course. It will make them down! And Disney failed to bring this story more interesting for children. Even the new yellow car character is lack of charisma compared to McQueen.\n\nHowever, I'm impressed when Disney tried to capture modernization era and they called it as \"Future\". The fact that Disney brought McQueen to his old age it makes the movie more realistic. When the viewer watch this movie since the beginning and they grew up so the story won't be a huge problem. But yeah, this is not good at all for children who watch Cars in a raw, we can say \"Movie Marathon\" as these children haven't grown up yet.\n\nGood movie that has failed ending! (poor execution in the end)\n\nSince the opening till the climax, \"Bol\" nailed to play with the audience's emotion. The story is so complex, realistic and pathetic. All the prominent characters have very good acting and also looked so natural, except Mahira Khan. Mahira got a lot of scenes, but her acting wasn't natural. My salute for Manzai Sehbai, Zaib Rehman and Humaima Malik. I also impressed with the small roles that played nicely by Iman Ali and Amr Kashmiri.\n\nI would have given this movie 10 rating if the director stopped the ending when it reached the climax, which is also the ending of the main female character's story. Unfortunately, the director decided to continue the story by putting the happy ending small scene, which I think completely out of the main story's line and broke the audience's emotion.\n\nThe ending will be good for Pakistani audiences who want a happy ending story, but definitely is not good enough for the movie lover who expects surprising and emotional ending!"
