        "text": "Srinagar: Militants have shot dead Kashmiri actress Amrina Bhatt in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. The incident took place in the Chadoora area of the Union Territory, located in the Budgam district. When they were attacked, they were inside their house. She was shifted to a local hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead. Her 10-year-old nephew was also shot in the arm. He is injured and is undergoing treatment in the hospital.\n\nIt may be recalled that a day earlier, a policeman was killed by terrorists in the Soura area of Srinagar on Tuesday (May 24, 2022). He was identified as Saifullah Qadri (Abba's name as Mohammad Syed Qadri). The policeman's seven-year-old daughter was also injured in the attack. The terrorists opened fire on a policeman near Anchar Soura. He was admitted to a nearby hospital in a critical condition.\n\nAll this is happening at a time when terrorist Yasin Malik has been sentenced to life imprisonment. A huge crowd of radical Muslims had gathered outside Yasin's Srinagar home. The mob also pelted stones at the security forces. During this time, the police fired tear gas shells to control the crowd. Yasin Malik's house is located in the Maysuma area of Srinagar. This area is near Lal Chowk. In the video that is going viral, the Muslim women also raised religious slogans like 'We want freedom', and the slogan 'Ek Takbir Allahu Akbar'.\n\nYasin Malik gets life imprisonment, Kashmir on high alert\n\nPM Modi to inaugurate 1152 houses constructed under Lighthouse project in Chennai today"
