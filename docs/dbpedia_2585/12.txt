Israr Ahmed Butt

Realizing the terrible plight of the Kashmiri people, Israr Ahmed Butt asks Muslims and other justice-loving people to lend their support to them.

The people of Kashmir have suffered decades of Indian brutality and they continue to do so even today. Unfortunately little about their plight is reported in the Western corporate and Zionist-controlled media. We know the reason. Western governments want to maintain good relations with Delhi because they believe India is a huge market for Western goods. This may be true but the people of Kashmir should not be made to pay the price for such selfishness. Through your newsmagazine, I am appealing to all your readers to support the just and legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people. They deserve to live in dignity, and not under the boot of the brutal Indian army.
