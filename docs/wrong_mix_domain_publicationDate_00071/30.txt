The Philip K. Dick Award is an American science fiction honor given annually to one of the genre's most iconic and influential authors.

It is awarded to the best original paperback published each year in the U.S., and the competition has been tight over the past forty years. Some of the biggest names in sci-fi have been nominated for the award, and some of the most recognizable figures have lost!

If youâ€™re looking for a quick insight into the best and brightest novels in SFF publishing, then this list of every Philip K. Dick Award-winning book is an excellent place to start.
