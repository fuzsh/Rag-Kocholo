        "text": "After landing his first story in the July 1952 edition of Planet Stories, Philip K. Dick published over 121 pieces of short fiction in science fiction journals. He went on to publish 44 novels, which were translated into over 30 languages, as well as 14 short story collections. Much of his work focused on the nature of reality, identity, drug abuse, and mental health. These subjects, paired with other planets and beings, invited surreal and bizarre visual interpretations of his work. Here are 33 of them, sourced from all over the world, and ranked from weird to weirdest.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n33.\n\nAt first glance it looks like we may be embarking on a beautiful sunset stroll, but with a second look that trail looks a little strange. A little . . . brain-like?\n\nArticle continues below\n\n32.\n\nA bit literal, but very eye-catching.\n\n31.\n\nNot that strange in terms of science-fiction cover composition. But a baby in space is always a little concerning.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n30.\n\nA surreal interpretation of two nouns in the title. But a pretty one at that.\n\n29.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe slightest manipulation makes this cover more beautiful than strange.\n\n28.\n\nMany of the covers for The Man in the High Castle feature a map of the US and/or flags of Japan and Nazi Germany. But the Bard publishers decided to go with something a little different: a goblin.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n27.\n\nA little role-swap happening here. What do the sheep dream of?\n\n26.\n\nMany of the covers from the Polish publisher Rebis feature strangely photographed objects; but only one has an eyeball with toothpicks sticking out of it.\n\n25.\n\nA spray can emerging from an exposed brain, sure. But it’s those thoughtful eyes that get you.\n\n24.\n\nYou could treat this cover like an “I Spy” game: how many faces are hidden in this cover of Valis?\n\n23.\n\nA beautiful pastoral scene, with an amputated robot coming at you.\n\n22.\n\nThis might be a shocking reveal, except it’s a science-fiction novel.\n\n21.\n\nA fairly conservative guess at what aliens from another planet might look like, but with a mohawk.\n\n20.\n\nImagine if this were in your backyard.\n\n19.\n\nWhat else would you expect a man who repairs broken pottery to look like?\n\n18.\n\nA surreal interpretation of a visit to the dentist office.\n\n17.\n\nIt must be hard trying to sleep with faces staring up at you from the floorboards.\n\n16.\n\nNothing creepier than a smashed up doll in the face of earth’s destruction.\n\n15.\n\nAnd here’s Weird Al Yankovic coming up with one of his hilarious satirical songs. What will he skewer next?!\n\n14.\n\nA perfect blend of surreal and strange for a collection of the author’s letters.\n\n13.\n\nAn oddly compelling spin on the sci-fi collage cover.\n\n12.\n\nIf only fashion had gotten us this far in 2004.\n\n11.\n\nBeetle-eyes? Almond-eyes? Not quite sure what’s happening here, but that golden halo is doing something for me.\n\n10.\n\nThere was so much weird, it couldn’t be contained on the front cover.\n\n9.\n\nMind blown.\n\n8.\n\nA classic, hand-painted cover.\n\n7.\n\nGumm thought he lost his soda and that society had forgotten Marilyn Monroe, but they were really one in the same.\n\n6.\n\nA natural response to waking up and finding out that you now live in a police state.\n\n5.\n\nTFW your dad is pulled from the sky with a fork. Is he the chosen one? Is he someone’s dinner? Will he need that shoe?\n\n4.\n\nThis probably is what it would look like if you had to work as a narcotics agent while tripping.\n\n3.\n\nPlaying with a sense of space (foreground, middle ground, background) in space.\n\n2.\n\nI’m not sure what that television face is trying to do with a spray can, but she’s doing it convincingly.\n\n1.\n\nThis cover encapsulates so much of what makes the others bizarre: floating subject matter, aliens, disfigured figures, anthropomorphized objects. But the contrasting orange and blue make it pop in a garish way that separates it from the rest."
