        "text": "This is a list of Philip K. Dick Award winners, including ratings for those books that I've read and links to reviews where I've written one. This is a judged award awarded for the best original SF paperback published in the US. Only paperback and trade paperback originals are eligible, not books that were originally published in hardcover.\n\nThe date given on this page is the year that the award was given, since I standardize all awards to the year of the award. It will therefore be one year later than the official date on the award, which reflects publication date.\n\n2024 Bethany Jacobs These Burning Stars 2023 Kimberly Unger The Extractionist 2022 Kali Wallace Dead Space 2021 Alison Stine The Road Out of Winter 2020 Sarah Pinsker Sooner or Later Everything Falls Into the Sea 2019 Audrey Schulman Theory of Bastards 2018 Carrie Vaughn Bannerless 2017 Claudia Casper The Mercy Journals 2016 Ramez Naam Apex 2015 Meg Elison The Book of the Unnamed Midwife 2014 Ben H.
