        "text": "A talk written by Bruce Gillespie\n\nfor the October 1990 meeting of the Nova Mob\n\nFirst published in brg, No. 1, October 1990,\n\nfor ANZAPA (Australia and New\n\nZealand Amateur Publishing Assocation)\n\nThanks to Frank Bertrand for contibuting this essay.\n\nI\n\nWhat are the non-sf novels of Philip Dick? As happens often when\n\ndiscussing Dick’s life and career, it is not easy to give a simple\n\nanswer.\n\nThe books that I want to concentrate on during this talk comprise a series of novels that Philip Dick wrote during the 1950s with the aim of launching a career into the mainstream of American literature. For this reason, they might truly be called “mainstream” novels, much as I dislike the term. None of these novels were published during the 1950s or 1960s, and only one, Confessions of a Crap Artist, appeared during the author’s lifetime. In his biography of Philip Dick, Divine Invasions, Lawrence Sutin shows that this lack of success was a constant, inconsolable disappointment to Dick until he died. In 1960 he wrote that he was willing\n\nto “take twenty to thirty years to succeed as a literary writer”. This dream had virtually died by January 1963 when the Scott Meredith Literary Agency “returned all of Phil’s unsold mainstream novels in one big package that was dumped on his doorstep… These rejections coupled with the ray of hope of the Hugo [for The Man in the High Castle], made it official. After seven years, Phil’s mainstream breakthrough effort was formally at an end.” These 1950s manuscripts were later stored at the\n\nlibrary of the University of California at Fullerton, and remained largely\n\nunread, except by scholars like Kim Stanley Robinson, until after Dick’s\n\ndeath in 1982.\n\nBut Phil Dick’s dream of mainstream success never left him. He had fond\n\nhopes that The Man in the High Castle would be a general literary success\n\nas well as a Hugo winner. This has not happened. In his last years, he\n\nbegged Dave Hartwell at Timescape Books to market The Divine Invasion and\n\nThe Transmigration of Timothy Archer as general novels. This happened, but\n\nremoving these books from the science fiction category seems merely to\n\nhave deprived them of sales within the genre.\n\nOther novels of the 1970s and 1980s are so much based on Phil Dick’s\n\nday-to-day experience that they might also be counted as non-sf novels. A\n\nScanner Darkly is the most obvious example. Set slightly in the future of\n\nthe year in which Dick was writing it, and containing only one sf device,\n\nit tells in an almost documentary way the story of the young drug addicts\n\nwho shared Phil’s house during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n&nbsp In the Bibliography I also mention four novels as “closely related to the\n\n1950s non-sf novels”. These novels, which are Time out of Joint, The Man\n\nin the High Castle, Martian Time-Slip and We Can Build You, begin with highly realistic settings and characters that might just as well have been\n\nlifted from any one of the 1950s non-sf novels.\n\nII\n\nPhilip Dick, born in 1928, died in 1982 of a massive stroke. He spent most\n\nof his life in southern California, especially around Berkeley and San\n\nFrancisco. He appears to have held only two regular jobs in his life, and\n\nby 1950 was doing his best to become a full-time writer, especially as he\n\nwas no good at anything else. He had an early success in marketing science\n\nfiction short stories, and began to succeed with sf novels during the\n\n1950s and early 1960s. In 1963 he won the Hugo award for The Man in the\n\nHigh Castle. This boosted his reputation, which had grown slowly during\n\nthe 1960s, and slowly he gained fame, both within and without the sf\n\nfield, during the 1970s. Helped immensely by several film options and the\n\ncompletion of Blade Runner, loosely based on his novel Do Androids Dream\n\nof Electric Sheep, he was just beginning to gain his first real financial\n\nrewards when he died in 1982.\n\nPhilip Dick didn’t do as well from sf as Isaac Asimov or Arthur Clarke,\n\nbut he did better than most of his contemporaries. Given that Dick enjoyed\n\nan sf career that produced about 40 novels and about 80 short stories, why\n\nwas he not content with success within the science fiction genre? Why was\n\nhe so absolutely determined to become a mainstream literary writer, and\n\nwhy was this the one ambition of his life that was denied him absolutely?\n\nThe answers to these questions lie partly in the Sutin biography (I\n\nhaven’t seen the Rickmann biography yet) and other recent memoirs of the\n\nman, but much more obviously in the texts themselves.\n\nIII\n\nPart of the answer is undoubtedly that it was very easy for Philip Dick to\n\nwrite successful science fiction. He turned to it a bit too naturally.\n\nLike many of us, he began to read science fiction when he was twelve years\n\nold. Unlike many young sf readers, he was at the same time reading his way\n\nthrough the rest of world literature. By the time he began glimpsing a\n\ncareer for himself as a writer, his ambition was to become an American\n\nMaupassant or Balzac. His technique of interleaving chapters, each chapter\n\nbased on a different set of characters, was based more from the great\n\nnineteenth-century European novelists than the works of anyone in science\n\nfiction. But before he could have any success in literary fiction, he met\n\nAnthony Boucher, editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, who\n\npublished his first story — a science fiction story — in 1951. Phil Dick\n\nhad just been married for the second time, had no job, was highly\n\nambitious as a writer, and found himself with the need to find money fast.\n\nBetween that sale and the end of 1954 he wrote and sold 63 science fiction\n\nshort stories, and wrote two sf novels and sold one of them (Solar\n\nLottery).\n\nBut, as I’ve mentioned, during all this activity Dick did not see himself\n\nas an sf writer, except under protest. For a long time he ignored the sf\n\nfans entirely, and met very few other sf writers. At parties he would find\n\nways of avoiding telling people that he wrote science fiction for a\n\nliving. As the bibliography shows, he still put a lot of time into writing\n\nnon-sf novels, even while continuing to churn out torrents of sf short\n\nstories.\n\nOne fellow Berkeley SF writer with whom Phil formed a close bond was Poul\n\nAnderson… Together, they could talk over the facts of SF life:\n\neditors chopping stories, lousy royalties, no recognition outside of\n\nfandom. Recalls Anderson:\n\nI bitched, and so did everyone else. You have to remember that in those\n\ndays a science fiction writer — unless he was Robert Heinlein — was really\n\nat the bottom of the totempole. If you wanted to work in the field you had\n\nto make the best of what there was. But we didn’t feel put\n\nupon…\n\nOkay, you get shafted this time, but there was always more where that had\n\ncome from.\n\nBut when Dick’s second marriage, to Kleo, broke up in 1958, he found\n\nhimself living with Anne, a lady with expensive tastes. After they\n\nmarried, there was a child. During the mid-1950s Kleo had worked, helping\n\nto bolster Dick’s ambition to become a mainstream novelist. Married to\n\nAnne, Phil had to work flat out to make a living. The only way to\n\nguarantee this income was to write science fiction novels, which sold —\n\nbut never gained advances of more than $2000 each. Even The Man in the\n\nHigh Castle, which was a Hugo winner and Book of the Month choice, made\n\nonly $7000 at the time. By the early 1960s, sf was the only work that Phil\n\ncould sell, but writing it condemned him to a life just above poverty\n\nlevel. The later breakup of his third marriage didn’t help, either. No\n\nwonder that Philip Dick clung to his lifelong illusion: that those non-sf\n\nnovels of the 1950s would someday be discovered and published, or that one\n\nof his new novels would be recognised by critics for The New York Review\n\nof Books.\n\nIV\n\nSo much for why Phil wanted to write his non-sf books. Why should any of\n\nus read them? This is a difficult question, one I can’t answer to my own\n\nsatisfaction, let alone yours.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Kim Stanley Robinson read them in manuscript, well\n\nbefore Dick had died or anybody had shown an interest in publishing them.\n\nRobinson’s verdict, in his otherwise excellent book The Novels of Philip\n\nK. Dick, is uncompromising. Robinson’s charges are that:\n\n1 “All of the realist novels are prolix in a way that is utterly unlike Dick’s mature work. Every scene, no matter how important to the novel, is\n\ndramatized at equal length, in a profusion of unnecessary detail.”\n\n2 They are humourless: “A uniform tone of deadly seriousness is only\n\noccasionally replaced by attempts at black comedy that go awry.”\n\n3 There is “an uneasy mix of realism and the fantastic. Despite making a very serious commitment to writing realist works, Dick’s interest in the\n\narcane and the peculiar crops up everywhere in these works, without being\n\nfully integrated into them.”\n\n4 “They are dull.”\n\nThe result, as Robinson summarises his own argument,\n\nis “an artistic\n\npersonality split down the middle. On the one hand were long, serious,\n\nturgid realist novels, not one of which sold; on the other hand were short\n\nsatirical stories, which were very successful — within the bounds of the\n\nscience fiction community.”\n\nThese are strong words, guaranteed to raise the hackles of any true fan of all the works of Philip Dick. Also, they did not square with my impression of the few non-sf novels that I had read before this year. I volunteered to give this talk so that I could refute these foul accusations, and persuade you to read the recently published lost masterpieces. In doing the research for this talk, I destroyed my own thesis. Philip Dick’s 1950s non-sf novels are certainly nowhere near as interesting as his best sf novels, but not for the reasons given by Kim Stanley Robinson.\n\nV\n\nRobinson’s needling comments were not the only reason for wanting to\n\ninvestigate the non-sf novels. My other stimulus derives from the\n\nmid-1960s, when I persuaded a friend of mine to read some of my favourite\n\nPhil Dick sf novels. He had obviously not read any sf before, and still\n\nhad the rather sniffy attitude to sf which one usually finds among\n\notherwise well-educated Australian readers. His reaction was of cautious\n\nadmiration, but he also said: “If it were not for the sf gimmicks in these\n\nbooks, you would not be able to stand the view of reality that they show\n\nyou.” I’m paraphrasing, but that’s the gist of what he said. Since then\n\nI’ve often asked myself: what would Phil Dick’s books have been like\n\nwithout the science fiction superstructure? Could you bear to read them,\n\nregardless of their literary quality? Would you be so appalled that you\n\nwould never be able to finish such a novel?\n\nThis remained a theoretical question until, many years later I heard that\n\nDick had actually written and failed to publish several non-sf novels.\n\nNow, thanks to publishers like Ziesing, Morrow, Gollancz and Paladin, you\n\nand I have gained the chance to read them. Here, surely would be the\n\nanswer to my question. The trouble is that the answer does not answer the\n\nquestion.\n\nVI\n\nBack to Kim Stanley Robinson. It occurs to me that all works of fiction\n\nare much less interesting to read in manuscript form than they are on the\n\nprinted page. That’s the only reason I can see why he would think the\n\nnon-sf novels are humourless or that they contain too much realistic\n\ndetail. Perhaps, holed up in a university library reading manuscripts, Kim\n\nStanley Robinson’s eyes nodded over the odd page or three.\n\nLet me refute Robinson by looking at the novel that least resembles the\n\nscience fiction novels. According to both Robinson and Sutin, Mary and the\n\nGiant is one of the very first of Dick’s non-sf novels. To me it is the\n\nbest. Like all the non-sf novels and some of the best sf novels, it tells\n\nof ordinary people living in a small town that is big enough to feel like\n\na city, but which is basically only a commuter suburb of San Francisco.\n\nThe time is mid to late 1953. The main character is Mary Anne Reynolds,\n\ndescribed here in what is perhaps Phil Dick’s best paragraph:\n\nIn the tired brilliance of late afternoon she walked along Empory Avenue,\n\na small, rather thin girl with short-cropped brown hair, walking very\n\nstraight-backed, head up, her brown coat slung carelessly over her arm.\n\nShe walked because she hated to ride on buses, and because, on foot, she\n\ncould stop when and wherever she wished.\n\nHere is a girl with no special talent or features except she is\n\ngood-looking and has a spiky sense of humour. She has a certain\n\nindependence and flair, a need to run her own life in a small town where\n\neverybody else just obeys the rules. Mary Anne is young, restless, clever\n\nbut not very well educated. She is, in short, the first of the young\n\ndark-haired girls who became the main obsession, both of Dick’s fiction\n\nand his life, during later years.\n\nMary Anne Reynolds is jaunty in everything. She insists on hanging around\n\nthe local bar, although she is under age, because jazz music is played\n\nthere. Two of the performers, a white pianist named Paul Nitz, and a black\n\nsinger named Carleton Tweany, become involved in her life. At the same\n\ntime, the new man in town, a tall middle-aged urbane chap named Joseph\n\nSchilling, falls for her immediately when she applies for a job at his\n\nnewly opened classical music store. Into this small town also arrive\n\nSchilling’s ex-lover, Beth Coombs, and her husband Paul. In turn, they\n\nhave in tow a vapid chap named Chad Lemming. Beth and Danny are trying to\n\nget Schilling’s support to launch Lemming’s recording career.\n\nThe young man had now emerged. His hair was crew-cut; he wore horn-rimmed\n\nglasses; a bow tie dangled under his protruding Adam’s apple. Beaming at\n\nthe people, he picked up his guitar and began his monologue and song.\n\n“Well, folks,” he said cheerily, “I guess you read in the papers a while\n\nback about the President going to balance the budget. Well, here’s a\n\nlittle song about it I figured you might enjoy.” And, with a few strums at\n\nhis guitar, he was off.\n\nListening absently, Mary Anne roamed about the room, examining prints and\n\nfurnishings. The song, in a bright metallic way, glittered out over\n\neverything, spilling into everyone’s ears. A few phrases reached her, but\n\nthe main drift of the lyrics was lost. She did not particularly care; she\n\nwas uninterested in Congress and taxes.\n\nThe weird sense of the ludicrous is shown in an understated way. Chad\n\nLemming is an entirely new phenomenon, the 1950s folk singer, but he comes\n\nover as a nice dill. Mary Anne is mainly concerned about leaving the\n\nCoombses’ apartment to go over to Tweany’s. The other people in the room\n\nare promoting themselves in one way or another. Even Flaubert could not\n\ngive a more accurate portrait of small-time people trying to be big-time.\n\nFrom our point of view, the main interest is that Dick is writing about\n\npeople he knew well. Our other accounts of the 1950s in fiction tend\n\nto be in long hindsight. Phil Dick committed himself to putting on paper\n\nthe life of his own time — and nobody wanted to publish him.\n\nIn Mary and the Giant, Dick’s humour works on a number of levels: the\n\nstraightforward satire of people like the Coombses and Chad Lemming, but\n\nalso the humour that you get by pitching the viewpoint of a naive original\n\nsuch as Mary Anne against the viewpoint of people who think they are in\n\nthe intellectual swim.\n\nWhen all these unbalanced people go over to Carleton\n\nTweany’s grotty\n\napartment, at two o’clock in the morning, they find Carleton still awake:\n\nTweany, still wearing his pink shirt and hand-painted tie, was sitting at\n\nthe table eating a sardine sandwich and drinking a bottle of Rheingold\n\nbeer. In front of him, spread out among the litter of food, was a smeared\n\ncopy of Esquire, which he was reading.\n\nCarleton Tweany is a thorough original: cheeky, musical,\n\nsexy &#151 he goes\n\nagainst every clichéd view of black people held by whites at the time. He\n\nand Jim Briskin (a black character from several later novels, including\n\nThe Broken Bubble and The Crack in Space) must have been based on some\n\nvery impressive black person Dick must have met in Berkeley during the\n\n1940s. Sutin does not identify this person, but the power of his\n\npersonality is so impressive that some future biographer should find out\n\nwho he was. Certainly, by the 1950s Phil Dick scoffs at his fellows’\n\nracial prejudices.\n\nAt Tweany’s place, the group begins a party, which quickly degenerates\n\ninto one of the great party scenes in American fiction. It is entirely\n\ndifferent from anything in Dick’s other fiction because here the\n\ncharacters really interact. All of the characters in all of Dick’s other\n\nbooks are so fundamentally isolated that they can only interact in anger,\n\nalarm or despair. In Mary and the Giant, and to a lesser extent in the\n\nnext non-sf novel, The Broken Bubble, people actually enjoy being with\n\neach other:\n\nSuddenly Beth leaped from the piano. In ecstasy she seized Lemming by the\n\nhand and dragged him to his feet. “You too,” she cried in his astonished\n\near. “All of us; join in!”\n\nGratified to find himself noticed, Lemming began playing wildly. Beth\n\nhurried back to the piano and struck up the opening chords of a Chopin\n\nPolonaise. Lemming, over-powered, danced around the room; throwing his\n\nguitar onto the couch, he jumped high in the air, whacked the ceiling with\n\nthe palms of his hands, descended, caught hold of Mary Anne, and spun her\n\nabout…\n\n“They’re nuts,” Nitz said. “They’re hopped in another\n\ndimension.”\n\nThis spontaneous ecstasy degenerates quickly, as happens at so many\n\nparties, into a dark experience. Nitz, flaked out in the bathroom, falls\n\nand hits his head. Everybody else is going crazy. “The bull rumble of\n\nCarleton Tweany never abated, rising and falling, but contained within the\n\nfrenzy of the little old piano”. Dick spins his themes ever closer\n\ntogether. Beth Coombs sheds her clothes. Paul Coombs, who turns out to be\n\nthe only one of them who is really nuts, is suddenly outraged that Tweany,\n\na black, should see his wife naked. The police arrive; they’ve been called\n\nby the woman who lives downstairs. Mary Anne escapes before the police\n\narrest the lot of them. The last sentence of the chapter is “Outside, in\n\nthe darkness, a bird made a few dismal noises. In an hour or so it would\n\nbe dawn.”\n\nVII\n\nThis episode contains in it much that makes Philip Dick’s non-sf novels\n\nrefreshingly different from his sf novels.\n\n1 All the action springs from the personalities of the characters, not\n\nfrom exterior menacing forces. Only in Dick’s non-sf novels do we find\n\ncollections of interesting characters. In the science fiction novels there\n\nare isolated memorable people such as Tagomi and Robert Childan in The Man\n\nin the High Castle, Arnie Kott in Martian Time-Slip, and Joe Chip\n\nin Ubik,\n\nbut the non-sf novels are composed of nothing but people. There are, for\n\ninstance, the two couples, the Lindahls and the Bonners, in Puttering\n\nAbout in a Small Land; the memorable black characters, such as Tweany in\n\nMary and the Giant, Jim Briskin in The Broken Bubble, and Tootie Doolittle\n\nin Humpty Dumpty in Oakland. There is the wonderfully sad Milton Lumky the\n\nsalesman from In Milton Lumky Territory. There is the great Jim Fergesson\n\ngoing on his last pilgrimage in Humpty Dumpty in Oakland.\n\n2 Ordinary people, looked at with the steady and sardonic gaze of Philip\n\nDick, are funny most of the time. In other words, the non-sf novels are\n\ncontinually funny, not humourless, as Robinson asserts. But the humour\n\nsprings from the inconsistency between the way people see themselves and\n\nthe way they seem to other people and, of course, the much-amused author\n\nand reader. These novels contain very few ha-ha jokes.\n\nThe humour of incongruity can be seen most clearly in the novels where Dick puts up versions of himself, then shoots them down. Mary and the Giant includes an older idealised version of himself in Joe Schilling: obsessive about music and young, dark-haired girls. He gets the girl, but only for a few minutes and in circumstances that are equally humiliating to both of them. In the end he achieves dignity by leaving her to work out her own life. In Puttering About in a Small Land, Roger Lindahl finds himself drawn into an love affair, almost without meaning to, with Liz\n\nBonner, his sexy and over-demanding neighbour. Faced with his wife’s wrath, he can do nothing more decisive than hiding naked under the sheets of the bed. Since Phil Dick’s private life was in a particularly chaotic state when he was writing this novel, I suspect that much in Puttering About in a Small Land is drawn from memory.\n\n3 This is the truth of life in the 1950s in California as one person saw\n\nit. Dick is determined to be as truthful as possible. The urban landscape\n\nof the 1950s is often a major subject of the non-sf novels. For instance,\n\na quotation from the first page of Humpty Dumpty in Oakland:\n\nAs he drove, Jim Fergesson rolled down the window of his Pontiac, and,\n\npoking his elbow out, leaned to inhale lungfuls of early-morning summer\n\nair. He took in the sight of sunlight on stores and\n\npavement… All\n\nfresh. All new, clean. The night machine, the whirring city brush, had\n\ncome by, gathering up; the broom their taxes went to…\n\nNice sky, he thought. But won’t last. Haze later on. He looked at his\n\nwatch. Eight-thirty.\n\nStepping from his car he slammed the door and went down the sidewalk. On\n\nthe left, merchants rolled down their awnings with elaborate\n\narm-motions… By the entrance of the Metropolitan Oakland Savings and\n\nLoan Company a group of secretaries clustered. Coffee-cups, high heels,\n\nperfume and earrings and pink sweaters, coats tossed over\n\nshoulders.\n\nThis is not merely description, because the rhythm and chatter of the\n\nprose sweeps along the reader, convincing us that we are caught up in the\n\nbusy deliciousness of a new day. Since we know Phil Dick, we also guess\n\nthat he is setting up his character for a perfectly ghastly day.\n\nBut there is more. Notice that “nice sky”. I wonder how long it is since\n\nthere has been a clear sky in San Francisco in eight-thirty in the\n\nmorning? Readers could well drink up these novels in the same way that one\n\ndrinks up the details of a historical wide-angle photo of one’s own town.\n\n4 This telling the truth extends far beyond the details of buildings and\n\nfood and roads and hills. In Mary and the Giant we find a sub-political\n\nworld, largely untouched by Senator Joe McCarthy and the forces he was\n\nunleashing at the time, but in which people are fighting many of the\n\nbattles that would dominate American life during the 1960s. In trying to\n\nfind the reasons why the non-sf novels of Philip Dick remained unpublished\n\nin the 1950s, Kim Stanley Robinson fails to mention the obvious: their\n\nundisguised frankness on matters sexual and racial. In the 1950s there are\n\ntwo American battlegrounds, Dick seems to be saying: the bedroom, between\n\nmale and female; and the street, between black and white.\n\nAs Dick’s own emotional affairs became more chaotic during the 1950s, the\n\nbattles between men and women in his non-sf novels become more ferocious.\n\nIn Mary and the Giant, Mary Anne Reynolds likes to be involved with large,\n\npowerful men, but she is frigid. Sex was, to her “very like the time the\n\ndoctor had stuck his metal probe into her nose to break off a polyp”. But\n\nMary Anne herself, with her cheekiness and willingness to break the stuffy\n\nold rules, is the heroine of her novel. She achieves a kind of balance\n\nbetween sexual and emotional needs.\n\nBy Puttering About in a Small Land, written only four years later, the two\n\ncharacters who represent aspects of the author are in retreat before the\n\ndemands of vivid, purposeful female characters. A battle is raging. In one\n\nbrilliant scene, Dick describes what would now be called rape within\n\nmarriage. In a scene of quicksilver emotional parries, he shows the\n\nmixture of confusion and joy as the man achieves sexual ecstasy for the\n\nfirst time in months as he has his way, the fury of the woman as she\n\nrealises she has failed to put on her diaphragm and is likely to become\n\npregnant, and the seesawing emotions as both parties try to justify their\n\nactions, then berate themselves. There is even a strange and temporary\n\ntruce at the end of the scene. No American novel could have said so much,\n\nso clearly, with so little moralising, before the late 1960s or early\n\n1970s.\n\n5 In The Novels of Philip K. Dick, Kim Stanley Robinson concentrates on\n\nonly one major theme of the non-sf novels. Since he covers it well, I\n\nquote him:\n\nAnother abiding concern of [Dick’s is] the effect, in American postwar\n\ncapitalism, of business relations on the personal relations between\n\nemployer and employee, and indirectly on all personal relations. Dick\n\nbelieved this effect to be profoundly destructive… In The Man Whose\n\nTeeth Were All Exactly Alike, Dombrosio assaults his boss when his boss\n\nhires his wife. He becomes estranged from his wife after he is fired, and\n\neventually tries to hoax his neighbor, with whom he once was friendly. In\n\nMary and the Giant, Mary works in a record store for a disturbed owner and\n\nshe is forced to conduct a sordid affair with him to keep her job. And in\n\nIn Milton Lumky Territory this theme is expressed most fully. The\n\nprotagonist, Bruce Stevens, marries his fifth-grade teacher of years\n\nbefore and takes over her business, a typewriter sales and repair shop.\n\nBusiness difficulties make the marriage a perpetual battle, and as the\n\nbusiness nears bankruptcy Stevens becomes obsessed, and one by one\n\ndestroys all of his personal relationships.\n\nThese business relations give much of the special character to the non-sf\n\nnovels, since all are based on the very few jobs that Dick took before he\n\nbecame unemployable. These jobs were working in a small repair shop and\n\nthe music shop. Over and over again, in both the sf and the non-sf novels,\n\nDick introduces the employee who is highly dependent upon the whims of a\n\nfundamentally worthwhile but often capricious or even dictatorial\n\nemployer. As Robinson shows in another part of his book, Dick’s meagre\n\nexperience of paid work made him both admire the manual worker as the\n\nepitome of the American good guy, and pity him for being stuck in a lowly\n\njob.\n\nVIII\n\nI think I’ve proved that Kim Stanley Robinson is wrong in the reasons he\n\ngives for dismissing Philip Dick’s 1950s non-sf novels. These books are\n\nindeed funny, although you need a sense of the sardonic and ironic to get\n\nthe best out of them. They are not over-detailed: their detail is of the\n\nkind that the current breed of American writer — the so-called “dirty\n\nrealists” — have accustomed us to. Dick’s non-sf novels are certainly less\n\nromantic than those of, say, Larry McMurtry or Richard Ford or any of\n\nthose people, but he does not have the lyrical gifts of, say, Anne Tyler\n\nor Raymond Carver. Like other American realists, Dick assumes that\n\nso-called ordinary people are always extraordinary, even gothic, if looked\n\nat with any insight.\n\nHowever, if I have persuaded you that these novels have none of the faults pinned to them by Robinson, have I persuaded you that they are worth reading? Probably not. Yes, if you are interested in novels written about the 1950s where the viewpoint is not clouded by nostalgia or faulty memory. Yes, if you like novels about people being people. Yes, if you like well-written realist novels. All of these books are better written, in any formal sense, than most of the science fiction novels — hence, perhaps, Robinson’s impatience with them.\n\nBut would you — could you — ever prefer them to Dick’s best science\n\nfiction novels? This, if you remember, is the premise of Michael Bishop’s\n\ncheeky but unsuccessful recent novel Philip K. Dick is Dead, Alas, which\n\nappeared in America as The Secret Ascension. In an alternate world, Dick\n\nhas just died. He is known for the kind of novels I’ve been talking about.\n\nHe also wrote a small number of sf novels, known only to aficionados.\n\nEtcetera. I don’t believe it, as I don’t believe Bishop has grasped the\n\nfundamentals of Dick’s style or approach.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Philip Dick wrote three ambitious sf novels as well as\n\nsome potboilers. The first two sf novels that we still value are Solar\n\nLottery and Eye in the Sky. With Time Out of Joint, the third of them,\n\nDick became a master of the sf field — but he couldn’t have written that\n\nnovel without writing the non-sf novels we have just been discussing.\n\nThe beginning of Time out of Joint seems to be set in exactly the same\n\nsmall town that we enter in most of the non-sf novels. It has a downtown,\n\nand lots of shops and houses, and a public transport system, and lots of\n\npeople, but basically it is quiet. Everybody knows everybody else.\n\nBusiness chunters along.\n\nThe scene shifts to Ragle Gumm, who is a bachelor sharing an ordinary\n\nhouse with his sister Margo and brother-in-law Vic Nielsen. Their\n\nneighbours are the Blacks, Bill and Junie. You can predict already that\n\nRagle will have an affair with Junie. Ragle Gumm is the only bloke in town\n\nwho does not fit in: the only man who does not go out to work every\n\nmorning. Every day he sits and solves the Where Will the Little Green Man\n\nBe Next? contest. It comes in the paper every morning, and Ragle Gumm has\n\nbeen the national champion for three years running. Solving the puzzle\n\neach day obsesses him: “Spread out everywhere in the living room the\n\npapers and notes for his work formed a circle of which he was the centre.\n\nHe could not even get out; he was surrounded.”\n\nAt this point the book begins to diverge slightly from the pattern set in\n\nthe non-sf novels Dick was writing at the same time. Why is this man\n\nfilling in these puzzles every day, apart from the fact that his constant\n\nwins provide him with a modest income? More mysteries slip into the story.\n\nWhy, when Vic Nielsen reaches for the light switch, does he suddenly feel\n\nas if he should be reaching for an overhead light cord? Why, when walking\n\nup the two steps up to the front door, does he step up the third step,\n\nwhich isn’t there?\n\nThese puzzles aside, for several chapters Time out of\n\nJoint stays very\n\nmuch in the pattern of the non-sf novels. Compare it with, say, Humpty\n\nDumpty in Oakland, which features Al Miller, the most completely failed\n\nsmall-time character of all Dick’s small-time failed characters. “I’m a\n\nbum”, he says of himself. “He absolutely lacked the ability to see how\n\nthings really stood.” In The Man whose Teeth Were All Exactly Alike, much\n\nof the action takes place because one of the characters finds himself\n\nstuck at home while all worthwhile American males are out making a crust.\n\nThis also happens to Roger Lindahl towards the end of Puttering About in a\n\nSmall Land. And in Time Out of Joint, sure enough, here is Ragle Gumm:\n\n“Stunning desolation washed over him. What a waste his life had been. Here\n\nhe was, forty-six, fiddling around in the living room with a newspaper\n\ncontest. No gainful, legitimate employment. No kids. No wife. No home of\n\nhis own. Fooling around with a neighbour’s wife.”\n\nAs readers of the Sutin biography will realise, all you need to do is\n\nsubstitute the term “writing” for “newspaper contest” and you have the\n\nexact way in which Dick saw himself at the time. Not only was writing very\n\nbadly paid, but it somehow made him less of a redblooded American male\n\nthan anybody else. The consequences of this perception — “I’m a bum”\n\ncombined with an awareness of the quality of his writing — played havoc\n\nwith his third and fourth marriages.\n\nThe point I am making is that Time out of Joint is more autobiographical\n\nthan the obviously autobiographical non-sf novels. This is because Dick no\n\nlonger feels the need to stick to the surface facts of ordinary life.\n\nBehind ordinary life in an ordinary American town lies something else\n\naltogether.\n\nGumm has several extraordinary visions of his little town. In one of them,\n\nhe walks up to a soft-drink stand, which seems to dissolve before his\n\neyes.\n\nThe soft-drink stand fell into bits. Molecules. He saw the molecules,\n\ncolourless, without qualities, that made it up… In its place was a\n\nslip of paper… On it was printing, block\n\nletters.\n\nSOFT-DRINK STANDIn the second incident, he is sitting in a bus:\n\nThe sides of the bus became transparent. He saw out into the street, the\n\nsidewalk and stores. Thin support struts, the skeleton of the bus. Metal\n\ngirders, an empty hollow box. No other seats. Only a strip, a length of\n\nplanking, on which upright featureless shapes like scarecrows had been\n\npropped. They were not alive… Ahead of him he saw the driver; the\n\ndriver had not changed. The red neck. Strong, wide back. Driving a hollow\n\nbus… He was the only person on the bus, outside of the\n\ndriver.\n\nThe exact status of this vision is never made clear in the story. Is it\n\npurely hallucination, or some supernatural view of the town? But its\n\nstatus in Dick’s mind is made clear when we read in Sutin’s biography that\n\nDick actually had several such visions early in his life, long before he\n\nwrote this book. His distrust of his own perception of the world made him\n\na virtual prisoner in his own house at various times in his life.\n\nWhat we find in Time out of Joint is that the bits and pieces of a science\n\nfiction superstructure, which gradually invade Ragle Gumm’s consciousness,\n\nare actually more autobiographical, more real to the author than the\n\naccurately drawn worlds he presents in the non-sf novels. It is for this\n\nreason that the non-sf novels fail, not because of any intrinsic\n\ndemerits.\n\nIn Time out of Joint, Dick finds metaphors for the very real paranoia\n\nwhich afflicted him from time to time. The miracle is that he finds\n\ncoherent metaphors that he can use to construct an exciting story. Ragle\n\nGumm happens to hear a broadcast that makes him aware that the world\n\noutside this town is very different from what he had imagined, and that\n\nRagle Gumm himself is totally important to that world. When he tries to\n\nleave town, in what is one of Dick’s most brilliant pieces of action\n\nwriting, he is captured and sent home. On his second attempt, he travels\n\nfrom the world of 1959 to a totally alien and very frightening world of\n\nthe year 2000. A war is on, between the “lunatics”, colonists on the moon\n\nand throughout the solar system, and the One World Government. Ragle\n\nGumm’s job had been, through the contest, to predict each day’s strike\n\nfrom weapons sent from outer space. The town he had lived in was entirely\n\na fake, with only a few people around him also sharing the illusion.\n\nSo here at last is the truth that Dick could not allow himself to write in\n\nthe non-sf novels. In the end, they failed to sell because in them Dick\n\nwas constantly pulling back from what he really wanted to say. This\n\nconstraint improved his formal style, and the non-sf novels have little of\n\nthe melodramatic flourishes that threaten to destroy so many of the sf\n\nnovels. But having learned his craft, of showing the underlying reality of\n\nthings through surface appearances, Dick had trained himself to write the\n\nsf novels, in which he could tell his own truth. The penalty for that was\n\nfeeling that he had failed as a writer and as a man; yet, paradoxically,\n\nhe came to feel that he was the centre of the universe, that what he was\n\ntelling people was more important than truths they could find anywhere\n\nelse.\n\nIX\n\nWhen I first tried reading The Man Whose Teeth Were All Exactly Alike, I could not get past page 70. I was constantly reminded of that statement made by my friend more than twenty years before. Without the metaphors of science fiction, Dick’s intensely detailed account of the battle between two families, the Runcibles and the Dombrosios, seemed too painful to read. One feels that there should be a filter between such emotional reportage and the reader. It’s not a matter of entertainment merely; it’s the fact that no general truth can be derived from such painful separate\n\ntruths. In the science fiction novels, Philip Dick would put into his words his feeling that there is something generally wrong with the world. The non-sf novels have to take the ordinary world as a given. In the end, Dick felt this was untrue, and he was untrue to himself by portraying the world thus. During the 1950s and early 1960s, the so-called ordinary world became increasingly ghastly to Dick. He felt that we are all lonely stick figures out there on a plain, and vast distances separate us. Our only\n\nhope is to find out our individual realities and perhaps achieve some fragile fellow-feeling with some other human being. This feeling pervades the non-sf novels, but Dick cannot find an adequate way to express it. Give him a loony sf plot, plus the small-town setting that he uses in some of his best sf books, and the Phil Dick mind suddenly bursts into life. Paradoxes, ironies, and brilliant visions burst upon us. This is the real Philip Dick; the writer of Time out of Joint and Martian Time-Slip and The Man in the High Castle.\n\nWhat a terrible pity that he could never quite accept his greatness in the\n\nsf field, and never realised why the non-sf novels failed to establish him\n\nas a literary figure. The non-sf novels are enjoyable enough to read, and\n\noften brilliant, but they are important only because the point us to the\n\nreal talents of Philip Dick, who never quite saw his own strengths.\n\n— Bruce Gillespie, 1 October 1990\n\nA BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nThe non-science fiction novels written by Philip K.
