        "text": "The Philip K. Dick Memorial Award was created by admirers of the author shortly after Dick's death (in 1982) to honor the Best American Original SF Paperback Book of the year. The prize ($1,000 for 1st place, $500 for 2nd) is sponsored by the Philadelphia Science Fiction Society and awarded at Norwescon, held in the state of Washington each year in the Spring.\n\nThe Award was suggested initially by SF author Thomas M. Disch, who was for several years its administrator. An administrative team of Algis Budrys and David G. Hartwell succeeded him.\n\nThe prizes come with a certificate, featuring a gold logo for first place and a silver logo for second. A jury (of 3, 4, or 5 members) now comprises each year's panel, with most of the jurors naming their successors for the next year. Usually one judge is the previous year's winner. In addition to SF and fantasy authors, there is at least one academic and one editor on each panel.\n\nPrize moneys initially were obtained by solicitations from publishers of paperback books, and some authorities have contended that the $1,000 and $500 prizes were awarded only when funds were available. The Award currently is supported by the Philip K. Dick Trust.\n\nThe first winner of the Award was Rudy Rucker for his novel Software. Ray Nelson, a friend and one-time collaborator of Dick (The Ganymede Takeover) was a finalist for the first Award and received a Special Citation from the award administrators. Special Citations usually are given for books that take second place in the competition.\n\nRudy Rucker, Tim Powers, Stephen Baxter, and Richard Paul Russo all have won the Award more than once.\n\nAward 1983â€”"
