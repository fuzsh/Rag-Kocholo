        "text": "The novel follows Dorothy Yoshida, a telepath and an astronomer. She is sent to investigate the mystery of a small planet orbiting a red dwarf star. It appears to have been terraformed, yet its only advanced life-forms are creatures called herders. They seem to possess primitive intelligence, while the slug-like herbivores they shepherd have only a rudimentary nervous system. It seems unlikely that these life-forms might really be connected with The Enemy which fights a savage war with mankind in deep space? When Dorothy lands, her mind immediately detects a dazzling intellect, the intensity of which she had never before felt.\n\nWetware by Rudy Rucker\n\n\"In 2030, bopper robots in their lunar refuge have founds a way to infuse DNA wetware with their own software code. The result is a new lifeform -- the \"meatbop.\" Turnabout is fair play. After all, humans built the boppers, now bops are building near-humans. It's all part of an insidious plot that is about to ensnare Della Taze -- who doesn't think she killed her lover while in drug-induced ecstasy. But she isn't sure. And it's certainly catastrophic enough to call Cobb Anderson -- the pheezer who started it all -- out of cold-storage heaven.\"\n\n1988\n\nStrange Toys by Patricia Geary\n\n\"The story follows Pet throughout her life, starting at age nine and then jumping to thirty -- as she struggles to counteract the supernatural troubles of her older sister. How can you be sure what is real and unreal -- power, love, everyday trivia, or even the monsters you glimpse from the corner of your eye? And does it really matter after all?\"\n\n1987\n\nHomunculus by James P. Blaylock\n\n\"In 1870s London, a city of contradictions and improbabilities, a dead man pilots an airship and living men are willing to risk everything to steal a carp. Here, a night of bangers and ale at the local pub can result in an eternity at the Blood Pudding with the rest of the reanimated dead.\"\n\n1986\n\nDinner at Deviant's Palace by Tim Powers\n\n\"Gregorio Rivas is retired from the Redemptionist trade. At thirty-one, he's no longer willing to risk his life rescuing new recruits from the savage religion of the Messiah Norton Jaybush, no longer eager to track the caravans of the faithful through the mutated wildernesses of Los Angeles. Once he was the best Redemptionist for hire -- once he even tracked a victim right up to the walls of the Messiah's perilous Holy City in Irvine -- but that's all over now. Or it was, until he's approached to perform one last Redemption.\"\n\n1985\n\nNeuromancer by William Gibson\n\nRampant poverty and excessive affluence, unparalleled leisure and sophisticated crime -- it is a world that Case, a burnt-out, nerve-damaged computer geek, inhabits. Once he was at the top of his game, able to plug into the world of cyberspace where programs take on a visible form and can invade any system, no matter how well-protected. Now, unable to work, Case is living in Japan, on the slide to self-destruction. He is picked up by Molly, a street samurai and combat artist and her mysterious employer, Armitage. They give him a comeback chance but maybe even he can't cut it despite his restored abilities.\n\n1984\n\nThe Anubis Gates by Tim Powers\n\nWe are introduced to a motley crew of characters including an ancient Egyptian sorcerer, a body-witching werewolf who kills his victims to keep his identity a secret, a girl disguised as a boy who hunts her lover's killer, a brainwashed Lord Byron who has been programmed to kill King George, a sinister modern-day millionaire who travels back to early 1800s England, and Professor Brendan Doyle, an innocent, who agrees to give a lecture on Samuel Taylor Coleridge. They set the stage for a cabal of black magicians who plot a ritual through the ages to open the gates into the next world. Plans are disrupted in the early 1800s by a series of strange events. Meanwhile, back in our day, our millionaire is creating a way to move through time and a literary expert is whisked back to the 1800s. Now, things get really complicated...\n\n1983\n\nSoftware by Rudy Rucker\n\n\"Life was quiet for the septuagenarian hippies who lived in the Gray Area. But one of them, Cobb Anderson, had more exciting memories than most. Years before, he had built the first robots with free will, and these had evolved into boppers -- giant artificial intelligences who ran the moon.\""
