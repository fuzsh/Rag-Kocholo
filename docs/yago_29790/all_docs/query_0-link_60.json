His first love was always dance and by the young age of 16, he opened his own dance studio and was choreographing the Kansas City Chiefs half-time shows. But all of that would soon change when one night his cousin dared him to go on stage at the local comedy club Sanford and Sons where he was told to do 3 minutes. He performed off-the-cuff for 45 minutes successfully. It was then that Griffin purchased a one-way ticket to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming a stand up.\n\nStart of Stand-Up\n\nIn only one short month, he was a regular at the renowned Comedy Store, where he was compared with esteemed talents such as Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx, and Lenny Bruce.
