Like every comic, Griffin explores his own life onstage, and \"DysFunktional\" too infrequently intercuts his stand-up, shot in his hometown of Kansas City, Mo., with footage of Griffin with his family. From these brief glimpses--and his too few physical-comedy moments captured here--Griffin is much better than his tired \"What if Bill Cosby was a pimp?\" skits, Muslim jokes, and his backhanded props to homosexual men for being able to take it in the can with a smile on their face. In fact, though he did bring the funny to such broad comedies as \"The New Guy\" and \"Undercover Brother,\" Griffin has displayed better timing and wit on talk shows and Howard Stern. One last warning: From the director who brought you \"Double Take.\"\n\nWE LOVE OUR READERS!\n\nSince 1990, Orlando Weekly has served as the free, independent voice of Orlando, and we want to keep it that way.\n\nBecoming an Orlando Weekly Supporter for as little as $5 a month allows us to continue offering readers access to our coverage of local news, food, nightlife, events, and culture with no paywalls.\n\nJoin today because you love us, too."
