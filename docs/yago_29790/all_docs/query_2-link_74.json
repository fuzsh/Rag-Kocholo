        "text": "How many more times will we have to watch a movie about a dysfunctional, overprivileged family whose self-absorbed members are the cause of their own problems? Apparently at least “One More Time,” which is the title of a new film by Robert Edwards that plows this tedious ground yet again.\n\nMr. Edwards, also the screenwriter, at least has a somewhat novel plot variation and a big-name cast to tell his small story. Christopher Walken plays Paul Lombard, a faded crooner in the Frank Sinatra mold, who dreams of a comeback. Amber Heard is Jude, one of his daughters, who has a little musical talent but none of the ambition needed to capitalize on it. As the movie opens, she has lost her Brooklyn apartment and is moving back in with Dad in the Hamptons. (Yes, we get to hear Mr. Walken and Ms. Heard sing.)\n\nBecause these family members, like those in every movie of this stripe, hang around together constantly, although they don’t like one another, Jude’s far more successful sister, Corinne (Kelli Garner), is also on hand with her husband, Tim (Hamish Linklater). The usual dynamics are served up, along with the inevitable tense dinners — Jude and Tim once had a thing; Dad prefers Corinne to Jude; and so on.\n\nThis sort of boilerplate family drama distracts from the film’s only interesting thread, Paul’s comeback attempt, but maybe that’s just as well, since it isn’t all that credible, anyway. The movie banks a lot on the strained relationship between Paul and Jude, who seem not to recognize their similarities: Both are musical; both will sleep with practically any member of the opposite sex, no matter who gets hurt. But it does nothing with the comparison. This is a story full of people being miserable, humorless and selfish, despite having been given a lot in life, and they’re pretty much the same at the end of it as they were at the beginning."
