        "text": "“This is Where I Leave You”\n\nMining the dysfunctional family theme for dark comedy gold has become a favorite for the laurel wreath cadre of semi-independent filmmakers. The setup will be familiar to you: the now-adult children all come back to the family home to deal with some major event (death, wedding, release from hospital) and the infighting between siblings and flawed parents creates dramatic and comedic fodder.\n\nMost of the time this fails. The problems and deep emotional scarring of the children is too bleak for me, causing the humorous scenes to fall flat. While I realize many screenwriters and directors need to work through their problematic upbringings, asking an audience to attend their cinematic therapy session is inappropriate.\n\nWith that jaundiced view, I was prepared to be depressed when watching this strained family comedy written by Jonathan Tropper and based on his novel of the same name. And I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Tropper and director Shawn Levy had proved me wrong by skillfully navigating these treacherous waters and managing to make me laugh throughout this clever film.\n\nJason Bateman stars as Jane Fonda’s emotionally adrift middle-aged son who, along with his three siblings, reluctantly agrees to stay for a week at his mother’s home following the death of their father. Fonda is not your average, upper-middle-class mom. She’s famous for writing books about sex and borrowing liberally from her own family’s experience. Bateman has grown apart from his sister (Tina Fey) and brothers as all of them struggle with the universal challenge of trying to make messy lives function adequately.\n\nFonda, Fey, Bateman and the supporting cast all turn in strong performances, helping us see the humanity in their characters while being extremely funny. This is by no means a mainstream comedy, but if you like your humor with a little intellect, this movie will be up your alley.\n\nMature plot lines about relationships and a brief sex scene make this best for kids at least 13 years old. (R: Language and sex). 1 hour and 43 minutes.\n\nRatings (out of 4 stars):\n\nOverall: 3 stars\n\nKids: N/A\n\nTeens: 2 stars\n\nAdults: 3 stars\n\nSeniors: 3 stars\n\nShould you watch it? Yes — the “dysfunctional family” comedy finally done right.\n\n“The Skeleton Twins”\n\nThis, unfortunately, is a typical example of how films that revolve around maladjusted families usually wallow in the depths of misery.\n\nBill Hader and Kristen Wiig co-star as suicidal siblings who seem to compete with each other over which of them can be the most self-destructive. And because neither of the characters like themselves, it’s impossible for the viewers to care for them either.\n\nWhile Hader and Wiig unambiguously demonstrate their impressive acting talents, the depressing, hopeless nature of writer/director Craig Johnson’s vision is overwhelming. Miserable is not the same thing as moving or thought-provoking.\n\nThe persistent topic of suicide makes this best for mature teens 16 years old and up. (R: Language and mature themes). 1 hour and 33 minutes.\n\nRatings (out of 4 stars):\n\nOverall: 2 stars\n\nKids: N/A\n\nTeens: 1 stars\n\nAdults: 2 stars\n\nSeniors: 1 stars\n\nShould you watch it? No — the “dysfunctional family” comedy done wrong."
