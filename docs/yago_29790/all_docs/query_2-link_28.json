        "text": "Even when some of his material has a \"been there, heard that\" sense to it, Griffin's outbursts of charisma help elevate the overall presentation.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | May 25, 2004\n\nGriffin's paean to beating your children is more than a little disturbing.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Sep 6, 2003\n\nEddie notes he if had a gay son, he'd tie him to a bed and send in a whore every hour. \"How can any father be proud of a having a gay son?\" he asks bewilderedly.\n\nFull Review | Jun 3, 2003\n\nHaving really enjoyed \"Undercover Brother,\" I went out of my way to catch this film and ended up laughing so hard, I cried at times.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Apr 16, 2003\n\nOffensive is easy. Daring takes brains. And brains seem to be in short supply here -- almost in as short supply as laughs and audiences.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Apr 8, 2003\n\nInterminable going, not only because the forward momentum of Griffin's stand-up is routinely interrupted by annoying side trips to visit his porno-loving uncle or his cringing mom, but also because Griffin's material just isn't that funny.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/5 | Apr 7, 2003\n\nLike those proverbial million monkeys with their typewriters, Griffin manages to get off a halfway-funny line every now and again.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Apr 7, 2003\n\nA fun if not particularly revelatory slice of entertainment, Griffin's concert film seems largely designed only to shock with vulgarity without searching for the deeper 'why' behind the jokes.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: C+ | Apr 7, 2003"
