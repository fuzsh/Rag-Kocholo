        "text": "Bright and energetic comedian Eddie Griffin, at one time named \"the king of hip-hop stand-ups,\" won over a large audience with his straight-talking comedy routines, but reached even more people as an actor, excelling especially in comedic roles, but proving more than capable of dramatic fare as well. As star of \"Malcolm & Eddie,\" one of UPN's most successful and long-running sitcoms, Griffin was able to try his hand at other facets of the entertainment industry, serving as writer, producer and director of select episodes, as well as co-writing the theme song with co-star and former \"Cosby\" kid Malcolm-Jamal Warner. The series also occasionally showcased Griffin's choreography, harkening back to his pre-comedy dance career."
