        "text": "Here is the only selling point you need for The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected): Dustin Hoffman plays a thoroughly foul-mouthed grump. The legendary actor stars in the latest Noah Baumbach picture, playing a pissy dad who conveniently finds a way to complain about everything, including the prices at a fancy restaurant that his son treats him to.\n\n“$35 for a salmon? You get the salmon to blow you for that price?” he exclaims in the new trailer, debuting exclusively on Vanity Fair.\n\nIn the film, Hoffman plays Harold Meyerowitz, a retired Bard art professor reconnecting with his family, including his successful son Matthew (Ben Stiller), his less successful son Danny (Adam Sandler), and his daughter Jean (Elizabeth Marvel). Danny also brings his Bard-bound teen daughter Eliza (Grace Van Patten, a V.F. Vanities star) along for the ride.\n\nLike any Baumbach film, Meyerowitz focuses on the dramedy of everyday life, colored by dialogue that teeters on the absurd. Everyone in the family talks all over each other, but—in the trailer, anyway—none can quite outdo Maureen (Emma Thompson), Harold’s hippie-dippie wife, who can ramble about the oddest things.\n\n“In Italy, they take all of the little birds and deep fry ’em,” she says drunkenly during dinner, a perfect non sequitur. “It's very sad; there are no little birds left in Italy anymore.”\n\nSee all the offbeat familial chaos ensue in the trailer above, which is set to the Kinks’s rowdy classic “Where Have All the Good Times Gone?” The film premieres in theaters and on Netflix October 13.\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nGrace Van Patten Is a Real New York City Kid\n\nThe young actress spent her childhood on set, and now she’s getting the starring roles.\n\nOn la Croisette\n\n2017 Cannes Film Festival Portraits: The Stars Meet Vanity Fair\n\nIn celebration of the Cannes Film Festival’s 70th anniversary, Vanity Fair’s Justin Bishop captures the cast of characters making up 2017’s Cannes tableau vivant.\n\nCANNES FILM FESTIVAL\n\nAdam Sandler and Ben Stiller Bring Comedy to Cannes\n\nWho knew Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison would be talking points at Cannes?\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon Should End After Season Three\n\nHBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series had a mostly strong second season, but it’s time to start wrapping things up.\n\nPolitics\n\nHow Trumpworld Is Coping With the Kamala Harris Boom\n\nIn just days, the vice president has raked in more than $100 million, scored countless endorsements, started a social media phenomenon, and secured enough delegates for the nomination. “She has been totally dominating,” marveled one GOP strategist.\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocrats Are Having Fun?\n\nThey just had to listen to voters.\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump’s GOP Swings and Misses With Desperate Attacks on Kamala Harris\n\nRepublicans built a campaign around assailing Joe Biden. But now he’s out and Trumpworld can’t seem to figure out how to hit Harris besides warmed-over racist and sexist insults.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nNews\n\nWhat Kamala Harris Means for Democrats’ Chances in Battleground States\n\n“She’s been like a defibrillator to the Democratic Party in this race.”\n\nRoyals\n\nPrince Harry’s Calls to King Charles “Go Unanswered”\n\nThe monarch is reportedly no longer speaking to his younger son over Harry’s ongoing battle to secure enhanced security when he visits the UK."
