        "text": "I have been an inactive member of the imdb world for years now and haven't cast a single vote or posted my comments for public viewing, but the only review of Dysfunktional Family on this site does not shine a good light on a movie which cracked me up and gave me a great first date... In this movie, a black comic on tour hits his home town of Kansas City and does a one night show with his current material, mostly consisting of jokes about his family... What I liked to most about this movie are all the things reviews i read said to hate about it. For starters, you could look at Eddie Griffin's childhood as a depressing and upsetting way to grow up. With one uncle addicted to porn and the other addicted to heroin, no father, getting beat up all the time by his mother, no money, and on top of things, it gets really cold in the winter . Personally, I travel to Kansas City once a year for the only reason anyone would; I have family there also, and let me tell you, it's not an easy life. This movie showed nothing but love and laughter from the start. If you're going to make a movie that is basicly a recording of a live show, I think this movie couldn't of been done better - with little sidetracks of the family and how they really are makes the jokes about them 100 times funnier than they would of been already... And cutting to shots of the audience cracking up make you laugh even harder because Kansas city is a town where everyone tries to dress like a pimp. If you want to laugh, and can find humor in almost anything when the right spin is put on it - this is a movie for you."
