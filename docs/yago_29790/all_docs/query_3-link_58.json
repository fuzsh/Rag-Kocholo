        "text": "Buy Tickets HERE\n\nDoors: 7PM | Show: 8PM\n\nFunnyman Eddie Griffin is coming to the historic Kalamazoo State Theatre on October 5.\n\nA popular comedian turned actor who started his career on stage as a dare, Eddie Griffin has built an ever-growing fan base since jumping onto the comedy scene in 1990.\n\nBorn in Kansas City, Missouri, Eddie was voted class clown three years in a row in high school. His first love was always dance and by the young age of 16, he opened his own dance studio and was choreographing the Kansas City Chiefs half-time shows. But all of that would soon change when one night his cousin dared him to go on stage at the local comedy club Sanford and Sons where he was told to do 3 minutes. He performed off-the-cuff for 45 minutes successfully. It was then that Griffin purchased a one-way ticket to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming a stand up.\n\nHe played The Pastor opposite Dave Chappelle, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in 2018’s Academy Award Winning feature film A Star is Born.\n\nHis Showtime Comedy Special Eddie Griffin: Undeniable debuted on Showtime in February 2018 to rave reviews.\n\nTicket Information\n\nThis all ages event is reserved seating. A limit of eight (8) tickets per purchase applies.\n\nTicket Prices: $50-$85\n\nWhat To Know Before Attending The Show\n\nAll bags and purses must be under 8″ x 5″ x 2″ – Click for more details\n\nSKIP THE LINE:\n\nCLICK HERE TO PURCHASE\n\nWhy wait in the elements when you can skip the line?! This is a separate ticket that will grant you expedited entry into the venue. Skip The Line entry is located near the main entrance of the building. Look for VIP / Skip The Line signage or ask a staff member. Present your Skip The Line pass along with your event ticket for expedited entry and to avoid the public lines. THIS IS NOT AN EVENT TICKET."
