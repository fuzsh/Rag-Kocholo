        "text": "What religion does not believe in Jesus?\n\nOne example of a religion that does not believe in Jesus as the central figure is Judaism. In Judaism, Jesus is not recognized as the Messiah or divine figure, and he is not considered part of their religious beliefs or teachings.\n\nWhat people who practice the religion believe?\n\nPeople who practice a religion typically believe in a higher power or deity, follow certain teachings or moral guidelines, participate in rituals or ceremonies, and may seek spiritual fulfillment, guidance, or a sense of purpose in their lives through their faith. Each religion has its own unique beliefs and practices that shape the worldview of its followers.\n\nIs the Quaker religion a Christian religion?\n\nYes, the Quaker religion is considered a Christian religion. Quakers believe in the core principles of Christianity, such as the belief in Jesus Christ as their savior and the importance of living a life in accordance with Christian values.\n\nWhat do we call a person who believe in a power but not in a religion?\n\nA person who believes in a higher power but does not adhere to a specific religion may be called a spiritual person, a deist, or someone who is spiritual but not religious. These individuals may believe in a higher power or universal force without following the doctrines of organized religion.\n\nWhat is your religion?\n\nYou can have a religion like Christian faiths (Baptist Methodist, Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant). All that matters is that you make an effort to believe in God."
