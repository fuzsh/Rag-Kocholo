        "text": "The comedy concert film is a strange film genre. Even the best of them (like the seminal Richard Pryor Live in Concert) don't come close to capturing the dynamic energy of a live performance, and get old fast; the worst of them (anyone remember Andrew Dice Clay in Dice Rules?) are excruciating endurance tests.\n\nHappily, Eddie Griffin's aptly-named DysFunKtional Family is a good – if not perfect – concert film, mostly because of a very interesting choice made by director George Gallo (who previously teamed with Griffin on the film Double Take): Combining footage from two consecutive nights of sold-out Griffin shows with documentary clips that follow the comedian back to visit his family in his home town of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nThe concert stuff, hard-jabbing, deliriously profane comedy that's obsessed with race issues and sex, is pretty good, although Griffin's stated desire to use the inflamatory \"N word\" so much that it loses its meaning and power may be an admirable political gesture, but it doesn't really pay off as comedy (granted, it's not offensive, but it is boring). As with most stand-up comedy concert films, there's about a half-hour of really topnotch stuff (Griffin's funny and uncomfortable September 11 routine is as risky and fascinating as any comedy I've seen recently) and everything else is sort of a yawn.\n\nOn the other hand, the documentary material on Griffin and his family in Kansas City is absolutely priceless, so moving and weird and harrowing in its depiction of an unbringing that could have just as easily produced a sociopathic criminal as a comedy superstar. Gallo and Griffin really outdo themselves with the family stuff, and it could have literally been the whole movie and I would have been happy. So while DysFunKtional Family may only partially live up to its potential, the extent to which it does is a lot of fun and worth a look.\n\n3 out of 5 Stars, 6/10 Score"
