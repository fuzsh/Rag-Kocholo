Starring: Eddie Griffin Directed by: George Gallo Written by: Eddie Griffin Distributed by: Miramax Films Rated R: For extreme profanity and some nudity

Eddie Griffin returns to the big screen attempting to follow in the footsteps of classic comedian stand-up specials such as Live in Concert, Raw, You So Crazy and Himself with his own DysFUNKtional Family.

DysFUNKtional Family tries to combine the stand-up of Eddie Griffin with the outrageousness of his close family members. The problem, however, is that outside of a few jokes, it is terribly unfunny. The idea, while not wholly original, is creative and could have been channeled into a drastically better comedic vehicle.

DysFUNKtional introduces us to Eddie Griffins actual family through interviews while Eddie simultaneously describes his family members to a Kansas City audience. Eddie sets them up with his verbose, pop-eyed style as they then are supposed to outlive their descriptions. There is his crazy mother who tried to run him over with a car, an Uncle Bucky who has been in and out of prison most of his life as well as Uncle Curtis whose favorite pastime is not only watching pornography but starring in them as well. The films problem becomes evident after all the family members introductions; DyFUNKtional Family meanders around with very little bits of Eddies family and dissolves into an over-the top Eddie Griffin comedy hour. I longed for less of Eddie and more of the family interviews. Either the director, George Gallo and editor Michael Miller had a few drinks in the editing room or there was not enough footage because DysFUNKtional misses out on what should have been the actual comedic focus of the film.
