I am a graduate student at the Mathematics Department of Carnegie Mellon University. My advisor is professor Dmitry Kramkov. My area of research is Mathematical Finance and Stochastic Analysis, more specifically my interests are in

Optimal investment

Large investor problem

Liquidity

Here is my CV. Here are my publications:

On utility-based pricing and liquidity, Ph.D. Thesis, Carnegie Mellon University, expected in May 2008

Large traded problem and financial equlibrium in illiquid markets, in preparation

Here are some of my talks:

Equlibrium based model for a large trader, Probability and Mathematical Finance Seminar, Carnegie Mellon University, November 2007

Equlibrium based model for a large trader (poster presentation), 4th CCCP Mathematical Finance Workshop, Princeton University, December 2007

Here are the conferences that I attended.

Here is some basic personal information about me. I am originally from Moscow, Russia. I went to college at UT Austin and currently I am a graduate student at CMU. My wife Galina got her Masters degree in communication studies from Duquesne University and now communication is not a problem for us. Here are some of our family pictures.
