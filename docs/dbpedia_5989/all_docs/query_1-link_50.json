        "text": "Integration of molecular biology tools for identifying promoters and genes abundantly expressed in flowers of Oncidium Gower Ramsey\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTung Shu-Yun\n\n2011-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Background Orchids comprise one of the largest families of flowering plants and generate commercially important flowers. However, model plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana do not contain all plant genes, and agronomic and horticulturally important genera and species must be individually studied. Results Several molecular biology tools were used to isolate flower-specific gene promoters from Oncidium 'Gower Ramsey' (Onc. GR. A cDNA library of reproductive tissues was used to construct a microarray in order to compare gene expression in flowers and leaves. Five genes were highly expressed in flower tissues, and the subcellular locations of the corresponding proteins were identified using lip transient transformation with fluorescent protein-fusion constructs. BAC clones of the 5 genes, together with 7 previously published flower- and reproductive growth-specific genes in Onc. GR, were identified for cloning of their promoter regions. Interestingly, 3 of the 5 novel flower-abundant genes were putative trypsin inhibitor (TI genes (OnTI1, OnTI2 and OnTI3, which were tandemly duplicated in the same BAC clone. Their promoters were identified using transient GUS reporter gene transformation and stable A. thaliana transformation analyses. Conclusions By combining cDNA microarray, BAC library, and bombardment assay techniques, we successfully identified flower-directed orchid genes and promoters.\n\nMethylation effect on chalcone synthase gene expression determines anthocyanin pigmentation in floral tissues of two Oncidium orchid cultivars.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiu, Xiao-Jing; Chuang, Yao-Nung; Chiou, Chung-Yi; Chin, Dan-Chu; Shen, Fu-Quan; Yeh, Kai-Wun\n\n2012-08-01\n\nThe anthocyanin-biosynthetic pathway was studied in flowers of Oncidium Gower Ramsey with yellow floral color and mosaic red anthocyanin in lip crests, sepals and petals, and compared with the anthocyanin biosynthesis in flowers of Oncidium Honey Dollp, a natural somatoclone derived from tissue culture of Gower Ramsey, with a yellow perianth without red anthocyanins in floral tissues. HPLC analysis revealed that the red anthocyanin in lip crests of the Gower Ramsey cultivar comprised peonidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, whereas Honey Dollp was devoid of anthocyanin compounds. Among the five anthocyanin-biosynthetic genes, OgCHS was actively expressed in lip crests of Gower Ramsey flowers, but no transcripts of OgCHS were detected in Honey Dollp floral tissues. Transient expression of OgCHS by bombardment confirmed that recovery of the OgCHS gene expression completed the anthocyanin pathway and produced anthocyanin compounds in lip crests of Honey Dollp flowers. Transcription factor genes regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis showed no distinctive differences in the expression level of OgMYB1, OgbHLH and OgWD40 between the two cultivars. A methylation assay revealed that the promoter of OgCHS was not methylated in Gower Ramsey, while a positive methylation effect was present in the upstream promoter region of OgCHS in Honey Dollp. Overall, our results suggest that the failure of anthocyanin accumulation in Honey Dollp floral tissues may be attributed to inactivation of the OgCHS gene resulting from the epigenetic methylation of 5'-upstream promoter region.\n\nEfficient plant regeneration through somatic embryogenesis from callus cultures of Oncidium (Orchidaceae).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, J -T.; Chang, W -C.\n\n2000-12-07\n\nAn efficient method was established for high frequency somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration from callus cultures of a hybrid of sympodial orchid (Oncidium 'Gower Ramsey'). Compact and yellow-white embryogenic calli formed from root tips and cut ends of stem and leaf segments on 1/2 MS [11] basal medium supplemented with 1-phenyl-3-(1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-yl)-urea (TDZ, 0.1-3 mg/l), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D, 3-10 mg/l) and peptone (1 g/l) for 4-7 weeks. Embryogenic callus was maintained by subculture on the same medium for callus induction and proliferated 2-4 times (fresh weight) in 1 month. Initiation of somatic embryogenesis and development up to the protocorm-like-bodies (PLBs) from callus cultures was achieved on hormone-free basal medium. Regenerants were recovered from somatic embryos (SEs) after transfer to the same medium and showed normal development. The optimized protocol required about 12-14 weeks from the initiation of callus to the plantlet formation. Generally, the frequency of embryo formation of root-derived callus was higher than stem- and leaf-derived calli. Combinations of naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and TDZ significantly promoted embryo formation from callus cultures. The high-frequency (93.8%) somatic embryogenesis and an average of 29.1 SEs per callus (3x3 mm(2)) was found in root-derived callus on a basal medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/l NAA and 3 mg/l TDZ. Almost all the SEs converted and the plantlets grew well with an almost 100% survival rate when potted in sphagnum moss and acclimatized in the greenhouse.\n\nPost-harvest longevity of Oncidium varicosum (Orchidaceae flowers/ Longevidade pÃ³s-colheita de flores de Oncidium varicosum (Orchidaceae\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRicardo Tadeu Faria\n\n2006-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Oncidium varicosum from the Orchidaceae family has been widely used as pot flower, and, most recently, as cut flower. The objective of this work was to evaluate the longevity of the Oncidium varicosum, due to its low post-harvest resistance, after being conditioned in preservation solutions with different concentrations of sucrose. Oncidium varicosum stems grown in Holambra (SP were transported to Londrina (PR in climatized trucks at 5-7oC. Pre-treatment with pulsing (15% sucrose for 24 hours followed by conditioning in maintenance solution (1, 2, 3, and 4% of sucrose as well as conditioning in maintenance solution without pre-treatment were evaluated. Flower stems were distributed in an entirely casualized design, with ten treatments and five replications. Flowers were evaluated daily, using a score system developed to compare and verify the conservation of visual aspects. No treatment was superior to the control in maintaining the longevity of the flowers.A orquÃ­dea Oncidium varicosum Ã© bastante utilizada como flor de vaso e atualmente vem se destacando como flor de corte.

In its full generality, Ramsey theory is quite powerful, but can quickly become complicated. By limiting the focus of this book to Ramsey theory applied to the set of integers, the authors have produced a gentle, but meaningful, introduction to an important and enticing branch of modern mathematics. Ramsey Theory on the Integers offers students a glimpse into the world of mathematical research and the opportunity for them to begin pondering unsolved problems. For this new edition, several sections have been added and others have been significantly updated. Among the newly introduced topics are: rainbow Ramsey theory, an \"inequality\" version of Schur's theorem, monochromatic solutions of recurrence relations, Ramsey results involving both sums and products, monochromatic sets avoiding certain differences, Ramsey properties for polynomial progressions, generalizations of the ErdÅs-Ginzberg-Ziv theorem, and t...\n\nRamsey theory on the integers\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nLandman, Bruce M\n\n2003-01-01\n\nRamsey theory is the study of the structure of mathematical objects that is preserved under partitions. In its full generality, Ramsey theory is quite powerful, but can quickly become complicated. By limiting the focus of this book to Ramsey theory applied to the set of integers, the authors have produced a gentle, but meaningful, introduction to an important and enticing branch of modern mathematics. Ramsey Theory on the Integers offers students something quite rare for a book at this level: a glimpse into the world of mathematical research and the opportunity to begin pondering unsolved problems themselves. In addition to being the first truly accessible book on Ramsey theory, this innovative book also provides the first cohesive study of Ramsey theory on the integers. It contains perhaps the most substantial account of solved and unsolved problems in this blossoming subarea of Ramsey theory. The result is a breakthrough book that will engage students, teachers, and researchers alike.\n\nHydroponic cultivation of Oncidium baueri\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDaniele Brandstetter Rodrigues\n\n2017-08-01\n\nFull Text Available In Brazil, orchid cultivation has been increasing steadily over the last few years and contributing significantly to the economy. It has been reported that several vegetable crops and ornamentals have been successfully grown by soilless cultivation. The orchid Oncidium baueri Lindl. is grown on pot substrates. Nevertheless, hydroponics is an excellent alternative, especially for the production of cut flowers and bare root plants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the development of Oncidium baueri on two soilless systems: (a pots containing AmafibraÂ® coconut fiber, carbonized rice husk, and pine bark (1:1:1 irrigated with nutrient solution every 15 d; and (b a nutrient film technique (NFT hydroponic system irrigated with nutrient solution daily. Shoot height, pseudobulb diameter, and number of sprouts were evaluated monthly. The number of flowering plants, number of flowers, dry mass of shoots, and dry mass of roots were evaluated 11 months after onset of experiment. The pot cultivation system yielded more flowers and higher values for all vegetative parameters than the NFT hydroponic system.\n\nWilliam Gowers: the never completed third edition of the 'Bible of Neurology'.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEadie, Mervyn J; Scott, Ann E M; Lees, Andrew J; Woodward, Martin\n\n2012-10-01\n\nWilliam Gowers' classic single-authored two-volume A manual of diseases of the nervous system appeared in a first edition in 1886 and 1888, and in a second edition in 1892 and 1893, with a third edition of Volume 1 in 1899. No third edition of Volume 2 ever appeared. However, in 1949 Critchley stated that he had seen part of a revision of this volume. Subsequent writers could not find this material, but it recently came to light at Gowers' old hospital at Queen Square, London. The present paper describes the rediscovered material, containing Gowers' handwritten alterations for a further edition of Volume 2, and substantial new material, at least in relation to nystagmus and myasthenia. Gowers' declining health, or a conflict between his planned new text and his contributions to the neurology segments (1899) of Allbutt's System of medicine, may explain why a third edition of Volume 2 of the Manual of diseases of the nervous system never appeared.\n\nArmazenamento refrigerado de inflorescÃªncias cortadas de Oncidium varicosum 'Samurai' Cold storage of cut inflorescences of Oncidium varicosum 'Samurai'\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nClaudia Fabrino Machado Mattiuz\n\n2010-11-01\n\nFull Text Available A eficiÃªncia da baixa temperatura no prolongamento da vida de vaso de vÃ¡rias flores de corte tem sido bastante estudada. No entanto, o efeito da temperatura depende da duraÃ§Ã£o do armazenamento e da espÃ©cie floral. O experimento foi realizado objetivando avaliar a longevidade e as alteraÃ§Ãµes metabÃ³licas ocorridas durante o armazenamento refrigerado de inflorescÃªncias cortadas de Oncidium varicosum 'Samurai', armazenadas em diferentes temperaturas (5, 10 e 20Â°C. Foram avaliados os seguintes parÃ¢metros: conteÃºdo relativo de Ã¡gua, carboidratos solÃºveis e aÃ§Ãºcares redutores, conteÃºdo de carotenÃ³ides, coloraÃ§Ã£o e longevidade. Os resultados indicaram diferenÃ§as nos parÃ¢metros avaliados nas trÃªs temperaturas de armazenamento. As flores de Oncidium varicosum 'Samurai', armazenadas a 5Â°C, apresentaram melhor manutenÃ§Ã£o da qualidade do que nas outras temperaturas, o que foi evidenciado pela menor reduÃ§Ã£o do conteÃºdo relativo de Ã¡gua, melhor manutenÃ§Ã£o do conteÃºdo de carotenÃ³ides, dos carboidratos solÃºveis e aÃ§Ãºcares redutores, coloraÃ§Ã£o e maior longevidade.The effectiveness of low temperatures on extending vase life of several cut flowers has been largely investigated. However, the temperature effect depends on the length of the storage period and of the floral species. The experiment was accomplished to evaluate the longevity and the metabolic changes which occurred during the cold storage of cut inflorescences of Oncidium varicosum 'Samurai' kept under different temperatures (5, 10 and 20Â°C. The following parameters were analyzed: relative water content (RWC, soluble carbohydrates, reducing sugars, carotenoids contents, color and longevity. The results indicated differences among the measured parameters at the three storage temperatures. The inflorescences of Oncidium varicosum 'Samurai' stored at 5ÂºC presented better maintenance of flowers quality than at the other temperatures.

Spectroscopy of an atomic clock transition without compromising the clock's accuracy is accomplished by actively balancing the spectroscopic responses from phase-congruent Ramsey probe cycles of unequal durations. Our simple and universal approach eliminates a wide variety of interrogation-induced line shifts often encountered in high precision spectroscopy, among them, in particular, light shifts, phase chirps, and transient Zeeman shifts. We experimentally demonstrate autobalanced Ramsey spectroscopy on the light shift prone Yb+ 171 electric octupole optical clock transition and show that interrogation defects are not turned into clock errors. This opens up frequency accuracy perspectives below the 10-18 level for the Yb+ system and for other types of optical clocks.\n\nGrowth promotion-related miRNAs in Oncidium orchid roots colonized by the endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWei Ye\n\nFull Text Available Piriformospora indica, an endophytic fungus of Sebacinales, colonizes the roots of a wide range of host plants and establishes various benefits for the plants. In this work, we describe miRNAs which are upregulated in Oncidium orchid roots after colonization by the fungus. Growth promotion and vigorous root development were observed in Oncidium hybrid orchid, while seedlings were colonized by P. indica. We performed a genome-wide expression profiling of small RNAs in Oncidium orchid roots either colonized or not-colonized by P. indica. After sequencing, 24,570,250 and 24744,141 clean reads were obtained from two libraries. 13,736 from 17,036,953 unique sequences showed homology to either 86 miRNA families described in 41 plant species, or to 46 potential novel miRNAs, or to 51 corresponding miRNA precursors. The predicted target genes of these miRNAs are mainly involved in auxin signal perception and transduction, transcription, development and plant defense. The expression analysis of miRNAs and target genes demonstrated the regulatory functions they may participate in. This study revealed that growth stimulation of the Oncidium orchid after colonization by P. indica includes an intricate network of miRNAs and their targets. The symbiotic function of P. indica on Oncidium orchid resembles previous findings on Chinese cabbage. This is the first study on growth regulation and development of Oncidium orchid by miRNAs induced by the symbiotic fungus P. indica.\n\nRamsey theory for product spaces\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nDodos, Pandelis\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRamsey theory is a dynamic area of combinatorics that has various applications in analysis, ergodic theory, logic, number theory, probability theory, theoretical computer science, and topological dynamics. This book is devoted to one of the most important areas of Ramsey theory-the Ramsey theory of product spaces. It is a culmination of a series of recent breakthroughs by the two authors and their students who were able to lift this theory to the infinite-dimensional case. The book presents many major results and methods in the area, such as SzemerÃ©di's regularity method, the hypergraph removal lemma, and the density Hales-Jewett theorem. This book addresses researchers in combinatorics but also working mathematicians and advanced graduate students who are interested in Ramsey theory. The prerequisites for reading this book are rather minimal: it only requires familiarity, at the graduate level, with probability theory and real analysis. Some familiarity with the basics of Ramsey theory would be beneficial, ...\n\nRamsey numbers and adiabatic quantum computing.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGaitan, Frank; Clark, Lane\n\n2012-01-06\n\nThe graph-theoretic Ramsey numbers are notoriously difficult to calculate. In fact, for the two-color Ramsey numbers R(m,n) with m, nâ¥3, only nine are currently known. We present a quantum algorithm for the computation of the Ramsey numbers R(m,n). We show how the computation of R(m,n) can be mapped to a combinatorial optimization problem whose solution can be found using adiabatic quantum evolution. We numerically simulate this adiabatic quantum algorithm and show that it correctly determines the Ramsey numbers R(3,3) and R(2,s) for 5â¤sâ¤7. We then discuss the algorithm's experimental implementation, and close by showing that Ramsey number computation belongs to the quantum complexity class quantum Merlin Arthur.\n\nExperimental determination of Ramsey numbers.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBian, Zhengbing; Chudak, Fabian; Macready, William G; Clark, Lane; Gaitan, Frank\n\n2013-09-27\n\nRamsey theory is a highly active research area in mathematics that studies the emergence of order in large disordered structures. Ramsey numbers mark the threshold at which order first appears and are extremely difficult to calculate due to their explosive rate of growth. Recently, an algorithm that can be implemented using adiabatic quantum evolution has been proposed that calculates the two-color Ramsey numbers R(m,n). Here we present results of an experimental implementation of this algorithm and show that it correctly determines the Ramsey numbers R(3,3) and R(m,2) for 4â¤mâ¤8. The R(8,2) computation used 84 qubits of which 28 were computational qubits. This computation is the largest experimental implementation of a scientifically meaningful adiabatic evolution algorithm that has been done to date.\n\nPath-fan Ramsey numbers\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nSalman, M.; Broersma, Haitze J.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nFor two given graphs $G$ and $H$, the Ramsey number $R(G,H)$ is the smallest positive integer $p$ such that for every graph $F$ on $p$ vertices the following holds: either $F$ contains $G$ as a subgraph or the complement of $F$ contains $H$ as a subgraph.

Merr).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLv, LingLing; Duan, Jun; Xie, JiangHui; Wei, ChangBin; Liu, YuGe; Liu, ShengHui; Sun, GuangMing\n\n2012-09-01\n\nFLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)-like genes are crucial regulators of flowering in angiosperms. A homolog of FT, designated as AcFT (GenBank ID: HQ343233), was isolated from pineapple cultivar Comte de Paris by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA sequence of AcFT is 915 bp in length and contains an ORF of 534 bp, which encodes a protein of 177 aa. Molecular weight was 19.9 kDa and isoelectric point was 6.96. The deduced protein sequence of AcFT was 84% and 82% identical to homologs encoded by CgFT in Cymbidium goeringii and OgFT in Oncidium Gower Ramsey respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses showed that the expression of AcFT was high in flesh and none in leaves. qRT-PCR analyses in different stages indicated that the expression of AcFT reached the highest level on 40 d after flower inducing, when the multiple fruit and floral organs were forming. The 35S::AcFT transgenic Arabidopsis plants flowered earlier and had more inflorescences or branches than wild type plants. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

FrÃ¡polli\n\n2013-11-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper deals with RamseyÂ´s theory of truth and its aim is twofold: on the one hand, it will explain what position about truth Ramsey actually defended, and, on the other hand, we will pursue Ramseyâs insight in the XXth century. When the name of Frank Ramsey is mentioned, one of the things that comes to mind is the theory of truth as redundancy. In the following pages we will argue that Ramsey never supported such a theory, but rather an analysis of truth noticeably similar to the prosentential account. In fact, the very word âpro-sentenceâ appears for the first time in the XXth Century in RamseyÂ´s unfinished work âThe nature of truthâ, written around 1929. Besides, we will show that the prosentential account of truth is a neglected trend throughout the history of analytic philosophy, even though relevant analytic philosophers, such as Prior, Strawson, Williams, Grover and Brandom, have endorsed it.\n\nA hierarchy of Ramsey-like cardinals\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nHoly, Peter; Schlicht, Philipp\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe introduce a hierarchy of large cardinals between weakly compact and measurable cardinals, that is closely related to the Ramsey-like cardinals introduced by Victoria Gitman, and is based on certain infinite filter games, however also has a range of equivalent characterizations in terms of elementary embeddings. The aim of this paper is to locate the Ramsey-like cardinals studied by Gitman, and other well-known large cardinal notions, in this hierarchy.\n\nMonopoly, Pareto and Ramsey mark-ups\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nTen Raa, T.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nMonopoly prices are too high. It is a price level problem, in the sense that the relative mark-ups have Ramsey optimal proportions, at least for independent constant elasticity demands. I show that this feature of monopoly prices breaks down the moment one demand is replaced by the textbook linear demand or, even within the constant elasticity framework, dependence is introduced. The analysis provides a single Generalized Inverse Elasticity Rule for the problems of monopoly, Pareto and Ramsey.\n\nA Discrete Numerical Scheme of Modified Leslie-Gower With Harvesting Model\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRiski Nur Istiqomah Dinnullah\n\n2018-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Recently, exploitation of biological resources and the harvesting of two populations or more are widely practiced, such as fishery or foresty. The simplest way to describe the interaction of two species is by using predator prey model, that is one species feeds on another. The Leslie-Gower predator prey model has been studied in many works. In this paper, we use Euler method to discretisize the modified Leslie-Gower with harvesting model. The model consists of two simultanious predator prey equations. We show numerically that this discrete numerical scheme model is dynamically consistent with its continuous model only for relatively small step-size. By using computer simulation software, we show that equlibrium points can be stable, saddles, and unstable. It is shown that the numerical simulations not only illustrate the results, but also show the rich dynamics behaviors of the discrete system.\n\nThe Ramsey Numbers of Paths Versus Fans\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nSalman, M.; Broersma, Haitze J.; Faigle, U.; Hurink, Johann L.; Pickl, Stefan; Woeginger, Gerhard\n\n2003-01-01\n\nFor two given graphs G and H, the Ramsey number R(G,H) is the smallest positive integer p such that for every graph F on p vertices the following holds: either F contains G as a subgraph or the complement of F contains H as a subgraph.

The objective of this work was to evaluate different concentrations of growth regulator and alternative substrates for agar replacement in culture medium for in vitro multiplication and rooting of Oncidium baueri. In the explant multiplication phase, two experimental factors were evaluated- various concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP (0.0, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg L-1 and substrates (agar, vermiculite, and coconut fiber added to MS medium. In the rooting phase, different concentrations of indole butyric acid (IBA (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg L-1 were added to culture medium containing the same substrate. Six months after the experiments were initiated, the survival percentage, number of leaves, shoots, and roots and length of the aerial part and the major root were evaluated. The results suggested that addition of 1.0 mg L-1 BAP is necessary for the O. baueri in vitro multiplication phase, but IBA is not necessary in the rooting phase. For the substrate, vermiculite is not indicated as an agar replacement. In contrast, coconut fiber can be used in both multiplication and rooting phases of Oncidium baueri in vitro culture.\n\nEducating Richard : Incest, Marriage, and (Political) Consent in Gower's 'Tale of Apollonius'\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nSobecki, Sebastian I.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nGower's treatment of the incest motif in the \"Tale of Apollonius\" in Book VIII of the Confessio Amantis is embedded into the poet's discussion of kingship, which, like incest, emerges as being subject to legal discourses.

A Ramsey signal, which is a neutron spin rotation about a static magnetic field for a time interval between two separated oscillatory fields, is observed as a function of a neutron time of flight (TOF) in this method. The neutron spin rotation or the RF oscillation is used as a clock of the neutron velocity measurement which ranges from cold to epithermal neutron energies. This method together with the TOF measurement can be used for neutron inelastic scattering experiments. In addition, this method can be applied to the measurement of magnetic and pseudomagnetic fields in matter, and also to neutron spin manipulation for spin dependent scattering.\n\n[Sir William Richard Gowers: author of the \"bible of neurology\"].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHirose, Genjiro\n\n2014-11-01\n\nWilliam Richard Gowers is one of the great pioneers in neurology and the author of the well-known neurology textbook, \"A Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System.\" His concepts of neurology are based on meticulously and carefully accumulated knowledge of history, observations, and neurological examinations of patients with various neurological diseases.

The spectroscopic signal depends on these two quantities that covary with fluctuations in the probe-laser intensity. Introducing a simple model for the fluctuations, we find that the signature robustness of the hyper-Ramsey method can be compromised. Taking the Yb+ electric octupole clock transition as an example, we quantify the clock error under different levels of probe-laser-intensity fluctuations.\n\nNorman Ramsey.

This movement can be viewed as the internal development of protestant liberalism to its logical conclusion, and Paul Ramsey can be taken as one of the last great representatives of that tradition. By reducing the Christian message to the 'ethical upshot' of neighbour love, Ramsey did not have the resources to show how Christian practice might make a difference for understanding or forming the practice of medicine. Instead, medicine became the practice that exemplified the moral commitments of Christian civilization, and the goal of the ethicist was to identify the values that were constitutive of medicine. Ramsey thus prepared the way for the Christian ethicist to become a medical ethicist with a difference, and the difference simply involved vague theological presumptions that do no serious intellectual work other than explaining, perhaps, the motivations of the ethicist.\n\nOn-line Ramsey Numbers for Paths and Stars\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJaroslaw Grytczuk\n\n2008-08-01\n\nFull Text Available We study on-line version of size-Ramsey numbers of graphs defined via a game played between Builder and Painter: in one round Builder joins two vertices by an edge and Painter paints it red or blue.

The minimum number of rounds (assuming both players play perfectly is the on-line Ramsey number r(H of the graph H. We determine exact values of r(H for a few short paths and obtain a general upper bound r(Pn â¤ 4n-7.

We re-evaluate this type of frequency pulling in fountain clocks and pay particular attention to the effect of initial coherent atomic states. We find significantly enhanced frequency shifts caused by Ramsey pulling due to sublevel population imbalance and corresponding coherences within the state-selected hyperfine component of the initial atom ground state. Such shifts are experimentally investigated in an atomic fountain clock and quantitative agreement with the predictions of the model is demonstrated.\n\nCultivo de Oncidium baueri Lindley (Orchidaceae em substratos a base de coco Oncidium baueri Lindley (Orchidaceae cultivation in coconut-based substrates\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAdriane Marinho de Assis\n\n2008-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Entre os substratos utilizados no cultivo de orquÃ­deas, a fibra de coco vem se destacando como promissor substituto do xaxim, material utilizado por muitos produtores e colecionadores de orquÃ­deas, porÃ©m ameaÃ§ado de extinÃ§Ã£o.

In Italy, the hourly equilibrium price for all buyers is computed as a uniform average of supply zonal prices, resulting from market splitting due to line congestion. We model ex-ante individual bids expressed by heterogeneous consumers, which are distinguished by geographical zones. Using empirical estimations, we compute demand elasticity values and new zonal prices, according to a Ramsey optimal scheme. This is a new approach in the wholesale electricity market literature, as previous studies have discussed the relative merit of zonal prices, considering only the issue of line congestion. Our results show that the optimal pricing scheme can improve welfare in the day-ahead Italian electricity market, with respect to both the existing uniform price scheme and the proposal to charge the existing supply zonal prices to the demand side. - Highlights: â¢ We model and estimate the demand of heterogeneous buyers in the electricity market. â¢ Transmission line congestion creates welfare distortions in the market. â¢ We derive optimal Ramsey prices in the Italian day-ahead electricity market. â¢ We compare optimal prices with historical ones showing how to improve welfare.\n\nNorman Ramsey.

In the continuous-time Ramsey model [F. P. Ramsey, Econ. J. 38(152), 543-559 (1928)], the steady state is locally saddle-path stable with monotonic convergence. However, in the discrete-time version, the steady state may be unstable or saddle-path stable with monotonic or oscillatory convergence or periodic solutions [see R.-A. Dana et al., Handbook on Optimal Growth 1 (Springer, 2006) and G. Sorger, Working Paper No. 1505 (2015)]. When this occurs, the discrete-time counterpart of the continuous-time model is not consistent with the initial framework. In order to obtain a discrete-time Ramsey model preserving the main properties of the continuous-time counterpart, we use a general backward and forward discretisation as initially proposed by Bosi and Ragot [Theor. Econ. Lett. 2(1), 10-15 (2012)]. The main result of the study here presented is that, with this hybrid discretisation method, fixed points and local dynamics do not change. For what it concerns global dynamics, i.e., long-run behavior for initial conditions taken on the state space, we mainly perform numerical analysis with the main scope of comparing both qualitative and quantitative evolution of the two systems, also varying some parameters of interest.\n\n76 FR 20034 - Calvin Ramsey, M.D.; Revocation of Registration\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2011-04-11\n\n...

A frequency shift of the Ramsey fringes of several kHz has been measured which is proportional to the rotation frequency of the apparatus and to the distance between the laser beams. The results can be interpreted in three equivalent ways as the Sagnac effect in a calcium-atomic-beam interferometer: in the rotating frame of the laser beams either along straight paths or along the curved trajectories of the atoms, or in the inertial atomic frame\n\nThe complexity of proving that a graph is Ramsey\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nLauria, M.; PudlÃ¡k, Pavel; RÃ¶dl, V.; Thapen, Neil\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 37, Ä. 2 (2017), s. 253-268 ISSN 0209-9683 R&D Projects: GA AV ÄR IAA100190902; GA ÄR GBP202/12/G061 Institutional support: RVO:67985840 Keywords : complexity * c-Ramsey graphs Subject RIV: BA - General Mathematics OBOR OECD: Pure mathematics Impact factor: 1.048, year: 2016 http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00493-015-3193-9\n\nA note on Ramsey and Corlett-Hague rules\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLey, Eduardo\n\n1992-01-01\n\nRamsey-type results dictate that an optimal pattern of taxes must tax more heavily those goods which have a more inelastic(compensated)demand.

The dynamics of these models, bifurcations and pattern formations are so complex that studies are urgently needed. In this research, we transformed a continuous predator-prey model with Lesie-Gower functional response into a discrete model. Fixed points and stability analyses were studied. Around the stable fixed point, bifurcation analyses including: flip, Neimark-Sacker and Turing bifurcation were done and bifurcation conditions were obtained. Based on these bifurcation conditions, parameters values were selected to carry out numerical simulations on pattern formation. The simulation results showed that Neimark-Sacker bifurcation induced spots, spirals and transitional patterns from spots to spirals. Turing bifurcation induced labyrinth patterns and spirals coupled with mosaic patterns, while flip bifurcation induced many irregular complex patterns. Compared with former studies on continuous predator-prey model with Lesie-Gower functional response, our research on the discrete model demonstrated more complex dynamics and varieties of self-organized patterns.\n\nA modified Leslie-Gower predator-prey interaction model and parameter identifiability\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTripathi, Jai Prakash; Meghwani, Suraj S.; Thakur, Manoj; Abbas, Syed\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn this work, bifurcation and a systematic approach for estimation of identifiable parameters of a modified Leslie-Gower predator-prey system with Crowley-Martin functional response and prey refuge is discussed. Global asymptotic stability is discussed by applying fluctuation lemma. The system undergoes into Hopf bifurcation with respect to parameters intrinsic growth rate of predators (s) and prey reserve (m). The stability of Hopf bifurcation is also discussed by calculating Lyapunov number. The sensitivity analysis of the considered model system with respect to all variables is performed which also supports our theoretical study. To estimate the unknown parameter from the data, an optimization procedure (pseudo-random search algorithm) is adopted. System responses and phase plots for estimated parameters are also compared with true noise free data. It is found that the system dynamics with true set of parametric values is similar to the estimated parametric values. Numerical simulations are presented to substantiate the analytical findings.\n\nEffects of ion beam irradiation on Oncidium lanceanum\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZaiton Ahmad; Affrida Abu Hassan; Nurul Aliaa Idris; Mohd Nazir Basiran\n\n2006-01-01\n\nProtocorm-like bodies (PLBs) of an orchid (Oncidium lanceanum) were irradiated using 220 MeV 12 C 5+ ion, accelerated by AVF cyclotron at JAEA, Japan in 2005. Five different doses were applied to the PLBs; 0, 1.0, 2.0, 6.0 and 12.0 Gy. Following irradiation, these PLBs were maintained in cultures for germination and multiplication. Irradiation effects on growth and seedling regeneration patterns as well as morphological characteristics of the in vitro cultures were monitored and recorded. In general, average fresh weights of the irradiated PLBs increased progressively by irradiating the explants at 1.0, 2.0 and reached the maximum at 6.0 Gy. The figure however dropped when the explants were irradiated at 12 Gy. Surprisingly, although the highest average fresh weight was recorded on PLBs irradiated at 6.0 Gy, most of these PLBs were not able to regenerate into complete shoots. On average, only 21 seedlings were successfully regenerated from each gram of these PLBs. The highest shoot regeneration was recorded on cultures irradiated at 2.0 Gy in which 102 seedlings were obtained from one gram of the PLBs. Most of the regenerated seedlings have been transferred to glass house for morphological screening.

V.; Campo, A. del; Lizuain, I.; Muga, J. G.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe propose a solvable generalization of the Tonks-Girardeau model that describes a coherent one-dimensional (1D) gas of cold two-level bosons which interact with two external fields in a Ramsey interferometer. They also interact among themselves by idealized, infinitely strong contact potentials, with interchange of momentum and internal state. We study the corresponding Ramsey fringes and the quantum projection noise which, essentially unaffected by the interactions, remains that for ideal bosons. The dual system of this gas, an ideal gas of two-level fermions coupled by the interaction with the separated fields, produces the same fringes and noise fluctuations. The cases of time-separated and spatially separated fields are studied. For spatially separated fields the fringes may be broadened slightly by increasing the number of particles, but only for large particle numbers far from present experiments with Tonks-Girardeau gases. The uncertainty in the determination of the atomic transition frequency diminishes, essentially with the inverse root of the particle number. The difficulties to implement the model experimentally and possible shortcomings of strongly interacting 1D gases for frequency standards and atomic clocks are discussed\n\nComplex dynamics of a stochastic discrete modified Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with Michaelis-Menten type prey harvesting\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA.

The dynamical behavior of the proposed model was investigated. The existence and stability of the equilibria of the skeleton were studied. Numerical simulations were employed to show the model's complex dynamics by means of the largest Lyapunov exponents, bifurcations, time series diagrams and phase portraits. The effects of noise intensity on its dynamics and the intermittency phenomenon were also discussed via simulation.\n\nThe Ramsey method in high-precision mass spectrometry with Penning traps Experimental results\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGeorge, S; Herfurth, F; Herlert, A; Kretzschmar, M; Nagy, S; Schwarz, S; Schweikhard, L; Yazidjian, C\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe highest precision in direct mass measurements is obtained with Penning trap mass spectrometry. Most experiments use the interconversion of the magnetron and cyclotron motional modes of the stored ion due to excitation by external radiofrequency-quadrupole fields. In this work a new excitation scheme, Ramsey's method of time-separated oscillatory fields, has been successfully tested. It has been shown to reduce significantly the uncertainty in the determination of the cyclotron frequency and thus of the ion mass of interest. The theoretical description of the ion motion excited with Ramsey's method in a Penning trap and subsequently the calculation of the resonance line shapes for different excitation times, pulse structures, and detunings of the quadrupole field has been carried out in a quantum mechanical framework and is discussed in detail in the preceding article in this journal by M.

Here, the new excitation technique has been applied with the ISOLTRAP mass spectrometer at ISOLDE/CERN fo...\n\nEffects of ion beam irradiation on Oncidium lanceanum orchids\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZaiton Ahmad; Affrida Abu Hassan\n\n2006-01-01\n\nProtocorm-like bodies (PLBs) of an orchid (Oncidium lanceanum) were irradiated using 220 MeV 12 C 5+ ions, accelerated by AVF cyclotron at JAEA, Japan in 2005.

One laser beam has a cross-over resonant frequency on the {sup 85}Rb transition and the other beam has a 6.8 GHz shifted frequency. These two laser beams fulfill the two-photon Raman resonance condition, which involves a single-photon detuning of -2.6 GHz. By implementing these two lasers on cold {sup 87}Rb atoms, we demonstrate Ramsey spectroscopy with an interrogation time of the intermediate state by using Ï/2 Raman pulses. In our laser system, we can change the single-photon detuning to 1.2, 4.2 or -5.6 GHz by changing the {sup 85}Rb transition line used as a locking signal and an injected sideband. The laser system that directly uses resonant light on isotope atoms will be described in this paper.\n\nRamsey interferometry of Rydberg ensembles inside microwave cavities\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSommer, Christian; Genes, Claudiu\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe study ensembles of Rydberg atoms in a confined electromagnetic environment such as is provided by a microwave cavity. The competition between standard free space Ising type and cavity-mediated interactions leads to the emergence of different regimes where the particleâparticle couplings range from the typical van der Waals r â6 behavior to r â3 and to r-independence. We apply a Ramsey spectroscopic technique to map the two-body interactions into a characteristic signal such as intensity and contrast decay curves. As opposed to previous treatments requiring high-densities for considerable contrast and phase decay (Takei et al 2016 Nat. Comms. 7 13449; Sommer et al 2016 Phys. Rev. A 94 053607), the cavity scenario can exhibit similar behavior at much lower densities.\n\nHistorical overview of Ramsey spectroscopy and its relevance on Time and Frequency Metrology\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAmaral, M M; Tarelho, L V G; De Souza, M A; Baratto, A C; Garcia, G A; Muller, S T; De Martin, J Jr; Rodriguez, A S; Bebeachibuli, A; MagalhÃ£es, D V\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA brief overview of the historical evolution of the method of successive oscillatory fields developed by Norman Ramsey, and some different implementations of the decurrent methodology are presented.

I.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThis paper studies a modified of dynamics of Leslie-Gower predator-prey population model. The model is stated as a system of first order differential equations. The model consists of one predator and one prey. The Holling type II as a predation function is considered in this model. The predator and prey populations are assumed to be beneficial and then the two populations are harvested with constant efforts. Existence and stability of the interior equilibrium point are analysed. Linearization method is used to get the linearized model and the eigenvalue is used to justify the stability of the interior equilibrium point. From the analyses, we show that under a certain condition the interior equilibrium point exists and is locally asymptotically stable. For the model with constant efforts of harvesting, cost function, revenue function, and profit function are considered. The stable interior equilibrium point is then related to the maximum profit problem as well as net present value of revenues problem. We show that there exists a certain value of the efforts that maximizes the profit function and net present value of revenues while the interior equilibrium point remains stable. This means that the populations can live in coexistence for a long time and also maximize the benefit even though the populations are harvested with constant efforts.\n\nThe Variation of Oncidium Rosy Sunset Flower Volatiles with Daily Rhythm, Flowering Period, and Flower Parts\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYi-Tien Chiu\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Oncidium is an important ornamental crop worldwide, and in recent years, the characteristics of the flower aroma have become a concern for breeders. This study used headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS analysis of the volatile compounds to study the aroma characteristics of Onc. Rosy Sunset. A total of 45 compounds were identified, with the major compound being linalool. Onc. Rosy Sunset had the highest odor concentration from 10:00 to 12:00 and lowest from 20:00 to 24:00. The inflorescence emitted the highest quantities of volatile compounds during stages 3â6, which then decreased with the aging of the flowers. In Onc. Rosy Sunset, the sepals and petals were the major parts for the floral fragrance emission, in which linalool content was the highest, whereas the lip and column had a different composition of major volatile compounds, of which benzaldehyde, Î²-myrcene, and Î²-caryophyllene dominated.\n\nA remark on âStudy of a LeslieâGower-type tritrophic population modelâ [Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 14 (2002) 1275â1293\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nParshad, Rana D.; Kumari, Nitu; Kouachi, Said\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn Aziz-Alaoui (2002) a three species ODE model, based on a modified LeslieâGower scheme is investigated.

We show that this is not true. To the contrary, solutions to the model can blow up in finite time, even under the restrictions derived in Aziz-Alaoui (2002), if the initial data is large enough. We also prove similar results for the spatially extended system.

The target accuracy is 1 part per billion or better. We focus on two recent milestones: (i) The first realization of atom interferometers based on light-pulse beam splitters that transfer the momentum of up to 12 photon pairs, which increases the useful signal (matter wave phase shift) by a factor of 144 compared to the beam splitters used in the best present atom interferometers. Moreover, they lead to a cancellation of important systematic effects. (ii) The first realization of a simultaneous pair of conjugate Ramsey-Borde interferometers. In these, the relative sign of the inertial term is reversed so that it can be cancelled. Simultaneous operation means that this holds for a time-dependent inertial term (vibrations) too, which promises a substantial improvement in the signal to noise ratio\n\nRamsey-CPT spectrum with the Faraday effect and its application to atomic clocks\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTian Yuan; Gu Si-Hong; Tan Bo-Zhong; Yang Jing; Zhang Yi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA method that obtains the Ramsey-coherent population trapping (CPT) spectrum with the Faraday effect is investigated. An experiment is implemented to detect the light polarization components generated from the Faraday effect. The experimental results agree with the theoretical calculations based on the Liouville equation. By comparing with the method without using the Faraday effect, the potential of this method for a CPT-based atomic clock is assessed. The results indicate that this method should improve the short-term frequency stability by several times.

Here, a description is given of the structure of the floral elaiophores (oil glands) of four species formerly assigned to Oncidium Sw. Those of Vitekorchis excavata (Lindl.) Romowicz & Szlach., Cyrtochilum meirax (Rchb.f.) DalstrÃ¶m and a species of Oncidium displaying floral dimorphism, namely O. heteranthum Poepp. & Endl. var. album, are compared with that of Gomesa longipes (Lindl.) M.W. Chase & N.H. Williams, whose epithelial elaiophores are typical of many Oncidiinae, in order to extend our understanding of elaiophore diversity within this subtribe. Floral elaiophore structure was examined and compared at anthesis for all four species using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and histochemistry. In all species investigated, with the exception of C. meirax, the floral elaiophore occurs on the labellar callus and is of the intermediate type, possessing both glabrous and trichomatous regions. By contrast, although all four species produce lipid secretions, C. meirax lacks an obvious elaiophore. In each case, the secretory tissue is represented by a single-layered epidermis of cuboidal cells (trichomatous and/or atrichomatous). Palisade cells are absent. The secretion may be wax- or oil-like and is usually produced by smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). However, in C. meirax, where rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) predominates, oil accumulates as plastoglobuli within elaioplasts. These plastoglobuli are then discharged into the cytoplasm, forming oil bodies. In some species, oil usually accumulates within vesicles at the plasmalemma or in the periplasmic space before traversing the cell wall and accumulating beneath the cuticle, sometimes with distension of the latter. Gomesa longipes is unusual in its production of a heterogeneous secretion, whereas Vitekorchis\n\nThe value of urban tree cover: A hedonic property price model in Ramsey and Dakota Counties, Minnesota, USA\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHeather Sander; Stephen Polasky; Robert.

They were discovered by the observer Harry Ramsey in the late 1950s, and then published and publicized by the director Gail Moreton, both of the Lockheed Solar Observatory in the Hollywood Hills of Southern California. These efforts established the scientific reputation and secured continuing funding of the observatory, whose present-day successor is the Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Lab in Palo Alto. Moreton waves are rare, and there was limited interest in them until the EIT instrument on SOHO began seeing large numbers of similar waves in the corona in the late 1990s. The exact relation between the two observations is still a research topic today. This talk will describe some of the history of the observatory and the discovery and early interpretation of the waves.\n\nDynamics of infinite-dimensional groups the Ramsey-Dvoretzky-Milman phenomenon\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nPestov, Vladimir\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe \"infinite-dimensional groups\" in the title refer to unitary groups of Hilbert spaces, the infinite symmetric group, groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds, groups of transformations of measure spaces, etc. The book presents an approach to the study of such groups based on ideas from geometric functional analysis and from exploring the interplay between dynamical properties of those groups, combinatorial Ramsey-type theorems, and the phenomenon of concentration of measure. The dynamics of infinite-dimensional groups is very much unlike that of locally compact groups. For instance, every locally compact group acts freely on a suitable compact space (Veech). By contrast, a 1983 result by Gromov and Milman states that whenever the unitary group of a separable Hilbert space continuously acts on a compact space, it has a common fixed point. In the book, this new fast-growing theory is built strictly from well-understood examples up. The book has no close counterpart and is based on recent research articles.

Seeds inoculated with the M2 isolate of Ceratorhiza sp., originally isolated from the root system of wild O\n\nUn mÃ©todo algoritmo para el cÃ¡lculo del nÃºmero baricÃ©ntrico de ramsey para el grafo estrella\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFelicia Villarroel\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Let G be an abelian finite group and H be a graph. A sequence in G, with length al least two, is barycentric if it contains an âaverageâ element of its terms. Within the context of these sequences, one defines the barycentric Ramsey number, denoted by BR(H, G, as the smallest positive integer t such that any coloration of the edges of the complete graph Kt with elements of G produces a barycentric copy of the graph H. In this work we present a method based on the combinatorial theory and on the definition of barycentric Ramsey for calculating exact values of the above metioned constant, for some small graphs where the order is less than or equal to 8. We will exemplify the case where H is the star graph K1,k, and where G is the cyclical group Zn, with 3 â¤ n â¤ 11 and 3 â¤ k â¤ n.\n\nPropagaciÃ³n in vitro de Oncidium stramineum Lindl.

However, they are known to suffer on medium and long time scales from significant frequency instabilities, generally attributed to light-induced frequency-shift effects. In order to tackle this limitation, we investigate the application of the recently proposed autobalanced Ramsey (ABR) interrogation protocol onto a pulsed hot-vapor Cs vapor-cell clock based on coherent population trapping (CPT). We demonstrate that the ABR protocol, developed initially to probe the one-photon resonance of quantum optical clocks, can be successfully applied to a two-photon CPT resonance. The applied method, based on the alternation of two successive Ramsey-CPT sequences with unequal free-evolution times and the subsequent management of two interconnected phase and frequency servo loops, is found to allow a relevant reduction of the clock-frequency sensitivity to laser-power variations. This original ABR-CPT approach, combined with the implementation of advanced electronics laser-power stabilization systems, yields the demonstration of a CPT-based Cs vapor-cell clock with a short-term fractional frequency stability at the level of 3.1Ã10 -13Ï-1 /2 , averaging down to the level of 6 Ã10-15 at 2000-s integration time. These encouraging performances demonstrate that the use of the ABR interrogation protocol is a promising option towards the development of high-stability CPT-based frequency standards. Such clocks could be attractive candidates in numerous applications including next-generation satellite-based navigation systems, secure communications, instrumentation, or defense systems.\n\nTheological reflections on donation after circulatory death: the wisdom of Paul Ramsey and Moshe Feinstein.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJotkowitz, A\n\n2008-10-01\n\nDue to the worldwide shortage of organs for transplantation, there has been an increased use of organs obtained after circulatory death alone. A protocol for this procedure has recently been approved by a major transplant consortium. This development raises serious moral and ethical concerns. Two renowned theologians of the previous generation, Paul Ramsey and Moshe Feinstein, wrote extensively on the ethical issues relating to transplantation, and their work has much relevance to current moral dilemmas. Their writings relating to definition of death, organ transplantation and the care of the terminally ill are briefly presented, and their potential application to the moral problem of organ donation after circulatory death is discussed.\n\nInfluence of source and concentration of carbohydrate on shoot growth and rooting of Oncidium varicosum Lindl. (Orchidaceae / InfluÃªncia da fonte e concentraÃ§Ã£o de carboidrato no crescimento vegetativo e enraizamento in vitro de Oncidium varicosum Lindl. (Orchidaceae\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCharlen Saconato\n\n2003-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Oncidium varicosum is a native Brazilian orchid popularly known as âGolden ShowerÂ´ because of its very ramified inflorescence and many yellow flowers. The carboydrate type and concentration are important in promoting plantlet development of in vitro orchids. The present study was carried out to asses the effect of different carbohydrate sources and concentrations on the in vitro growth of O. varicosum plantlets. Murashige e Skoog culture medium was used modified with half concentration of the macronutrients. The plantlets, derived from seeds that were already established in vitro and 0.8 + 0.2 cm in height, were inoculated in the culture media containing the following carbohydrate sources: saccharine, maltose and glucose, at concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 g.L-1. The following variables were analyzed 8 months later: canopy height, number of roots, greatest root length, pseudobulb diameter and fresh weight. A completely randomized block experimental design was used with five replications per treatment. Analysis of variance and the Tukey test (5% were performed to compare the means. It was concluded that 60 g.L-1 saccharose was the best treatment for all the parameters assessed. The sugars 30 g.L-1 glucose and 60 g.L-1 maltose were also suitable, but presented lower pseudobulb diameter and lower fresh weight when compared to 60 g.L-1saccharose.Oncidium varicosum Ã© uma orquÃ­dea nativa do Brasil conhecida popularmente como âchuva de ouroâ, devido a sua inflorescÃªncia muito ramificada e com inÃºmeras flores amarelas.

Response of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; EC 4.1.1.39) to elevated CO{sub 2} was determined along with dry mass production, photosynthesis rate, chlorophyll content, total nitrogen and total soluble protein content. After 60 days of growth, there was a 80% and 150% increase in dry mass production in plants grown at 750 and 1100 {mu} l{sup -}1 CO{sub 2}, respectively, compared with those grown at ambient CO{sub 2} (about 370 {mu} l{sup -}1). A similar increase in photosynthesis rate was detected throughout the growth period when measured under growth CO{sub 2} conditions. Concomitantly, there was a decline in leaf Rubisco activity in plants in elevated CO{sub 2} after 10 days of growth. Over the growth period, leaf SPS and SS activities were up-regulated by an average of 20% and 40% for plants grown at 750 and 1100 {mu} l{sup -}1 CO{sub 2}, respectively. Leaf sucrose content and starch content were significantly higher throughout the growth period in plants grown at elevated CO{sub 2} than those at ambient CO{sub 2}. The partitioning of photosynthetically fixed carbon between sucrose and starch appeared to be unaffected by the 750 {mu} l{sup -}1 CO{sub 2} treatment, but it was favored into starch under the 1100 {mu} l{sup -}1 CO{sub 2} condition. The activities of SPS and SS in leaf extracts were closely associated with photosynthetic rates and with partitioning of carbon between starch and sucr"
