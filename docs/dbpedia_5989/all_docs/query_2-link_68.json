This business still goes well, because people need food. Food is a primary need that must be met and is not influenced by economic conditions in Indonesia. One food and beverage business is Warung Bu Kris, in Surabaya. This restaurant offers various choices. Most of the food served is pressed (penyet and blended with fresh chile sauce (sambal. Many people like this food and usually choose this kind of food as their first choice. The restaurant is usually full of people. Although there are not any seats, customers are willing to wait in order to eat their favorite food. The sample was chosen using non-random sampling. Data were collected in two steps, first to determine the favorite menu of Warung Bu Kris. The second step was to examine the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty, then to examine the relationship between both customer satisfaction and loyalty with sales at Warung Bu Kris. The weighted mean formula is used to analyze data in the beginning survey. For the second step, correlation is used. The results show that chicken penyet is the favorite dish at Warung Bu Kris. There is an association between satisfaction and loyalty and also between both customer satisfaction and loyalty with sales. These results suggest that Warung Bu Kris should improve product quality and service in order to maintain customer loyalty. The results can also give further information to other entrepreneurs who will open this type of business in the future.

Micromotors in the order of microns are realized by MEMS technology. Important applications in biomedicine include ultrasound probes for blood vessels, microrobots for colon intervention, smart pills and nanolitre pumps. Other uses include actuator for MOEMS and small variable capacitors. One exciting implication of micromotors is that they can be powered by rectifying mechanical vibrations. MEMS are playing an important role in our daily life as these systems are widely used in optics, communication and information systems, fluidics, biotechnology and medicine, scanning probe microscopes, automobiles and aerospace. There are a number technical challenges with micromotors, including the need to reduce stiction and increase torque. The precise geometry of the motor is usually tightly coupled to the stiction effect - the sticking of adjacent surfaces after release due to static friction. Piezoelectric, electrostatic and electromagnetic effects have been investigated to produce the electromotive force for the micromotor. However, we propose a micromotor design based on the Huber effect, as this will allow a new range of geometries and hence possibilities for managing stiction. To date, there have been no reported attempts at using the Huber effect, and this is possibly due to it being a poorly understood phenomenon. The reason for this is that large motors that utilize the Huber effect are self-destructive and hence have never been reliably characterized. Such motors are shown to be able to operate form a dc or ac source, and this property may be valuable in some MEMS applications.\n\nThe 2008 Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting: Robert Huber, Chemistry 1988. Interview by Klaus J. Korak.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHuber, Robert\n\n2008-11-25\n\nRobert Huber and his colleagues, Johann Deisenhofer and Hartmut Michel, elucidated the three-dimensional structure of the Rhodopseudomonas viridis photosynthetic reaction center. This membrane protein complex is a basic component of photosynthesis - a process fundamental to life on Earth - and for their work, Huber and his colleagues received the 1988 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Because structural information is central to understanding virtually any biological process, Huber likens their discovery to \"switching on the light\" for scientists trying to understand photosynthesis. Huber marvels at the growth of structural biology since the time he entered the field, when crystallographers worked with hand-made instruments and primitive computers, and only \"a handful\" of crystallographers would meet annually in the Bavarian Alps. In the \"explosion\" of structural biology since his early days of research, Huber looks to the rising generation of scientists to solve the remaining mysteries in the field - such as the mechanisms that underlie protein folding. A strong proponent of science mentorship, Huber delights in meeting young researchers at the annual Nobel Laureate Meetings in Lindau, Germany. He hopes that among these young scientists is an \"Einstein of biology\" who, he says with a twinkle in his eye, \"doesn't know it yet.\" The interview was conducted by JoVE co-founder Klaus J. Korak at the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting 2008 in Lindau, Germany.\n\nOutlier Detection in Regression Using an Iterated One-Step Approximation to the Huber-Skip Estimator\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nJohansen, SÃ¸ren; Nielsen, Bent\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn regression we can delete outliers based upon a preliminary estimator and reestimate the parameters by least squares based upon the retained observations.

We study the properties of an iteratively defined sequence of estimators based on this idea. We relate the sequence to the Huber...... that the normalized estimation errors are tight and are close to a linear function of the kernel, thus providing a stochastic expansion of the estimators, which is the same as for the Huber-skip. This implies that the iterated estimator is a close approximation of the Huber-skip...\n\nSynthesizing Huber's Problem Solving and Kolb's Learning Cycle: A Balanced Approach to Technical Problem Solving\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKamis, Arnold; Khan, Beverly K.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nHow do we model and improve technical problem solving, such as network subnetting?

This trip was intended to develop studies on the cultivation of Hevea brasiliensis in that region. Huber was commissioned with the task by the State of ParÃ¡ governor JoÃ£o Coelho, who wanted to find solutions to the downfall of the regional economy. The economy of Amazonia was primarily based on rubber extractivism and was seriously endangered due the market controlled by England from eastern plantations. Back to Brazil, Huber published a report with information about the society, economy and environment where the rubber trees were cultivated. The report compiles scientific observations and the topics that motivated the regional elites in that context. In addition to the brief analyses of the report, photographs took by Huber in the East of rubber trees plantations, tree tapping and local workers are published.\n\nLaget fÃ¶re jaget? : En kvalitativ studie om hur svenska sportorganisationer kommunicerar under en spelares individuella kris\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBjerkland, Albin; Edman, Benjamin\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIdrottsskandaler blir ofta uppmÃ¤rksammade i nyhetsmedier och aktÃ¶rerna i krisen behÃ¶ver dÃ¤rfÃ¶r uttala sig offentligt.

The position states are estimated using acoustic range measurements relative to the leader, in which some disadvantages such as weak observability, large initial error and contaminated measurements with outliers are inherent. By integrating both merits of iterated divided difference filtering (IDDF) and Huber's M-estimation methodology, the new filtering method could not only achieve more accurate estimation and faster convergence contrast to standard divided difference filtering (DDF) in conditions of weak observability and large initial error, but also exhibit robustness with respect to outlier measurements, for which the standard IDDF would exhibit severe degradation in estimation accuracy. The correctness as well as validity of the algorithm is demonstrated through experiment results.\n\nUlrik Huber and John Calvin: The Franeker Debate on Human Reason and the Bible (1686-1687)\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nGoudriaan, A.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn a doctoral dissertation De recta ratiocinatione (1686), Gisbert Wessel Duker claimed that \"the divinity of Scripture cannot be demonstrated except by reason.\" During the promotion session at the University of Franeker, the legal scholar Ulrik Huber (1636-1694) objected to this statement by\n\nAn application of Huber model on the effect of psychological empowerment of employees on organizational learning\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMahdie Mirzaiefar\n\n2014-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The purpose of this descriptiveâsurvey study is to determine the effect of psychological empowerment of employees on organizational learning based on Huber model. The study selects a sample of 54 people randomly from 499 regular employees of a Gas distribution firm located in province of Lorestan, Iran. For collecting data, two questionnaires of Huber organizational learning and psychological empowerment based on Spreitzer (1995 model [Spreitzer, G. M. (1995. Psychological empowerment in the workplace: Dimensions, measurement, and validation. Academy of management Journal, 38(5, 1442-1465.] are used. Cronbachâs alpha coefficients of organizational and psychological empowerment questionnaires are 0.706 and 0.92, respectively. SPSS software and linear regression test, binomial test, Pearson correlation test, and Friedman tests are used to analyze data and examine the hypotheses. The results of the data analysis show that psychological empowerment of employees could influence on organizational learning aspects in organization, significantly.\n\nA Robust Algorithm of Multiquadric Method Based on an Improved Huber Loss Function for Interpolating Remote-Sensing-Derived Elevation Data Sets\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChuanfa Chen\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Remote-sensing-derived elevation data sets often suffer from noise and outliers due to various reasons, such as the physical limitations of sensors, multiple reflectance, occlusions and low contrast of texture. Outliers generally have a seriously negative effect on DEM construction. Some interpolation methods like ordinary kriging (OK are capable of smoothing noise inherent in sample points, but are sensitive to outliers. In this paper, a robust algorithm of multiquadric method (MQ based on an Improved Huber loss function (MQ-IH has been developed to decrease the impact of outliers on DEM construction. Theoretically, the improved Huber loss function is null for outliers, quadratic for small errors, and linear for others. Simulated data sets drawn from a mathematical surface with different error distributions were employed to analyze the robustness of MQ-IH. Results indicate that MQ-IH obtains a good balance between efficiency and robustness. Namely, the performance of MQ-IH is comparative to those of the classical MQ and MQ based on the Classical Huber loss function (MQ-CH when sample points follow a normal distribution, and the former outperforms the latter two when sample points are subject to outliers. For example, for the Cauchy error distribution with the location parameter of 0 and scale parameter of 1, the root mean square errors (RMSEs of MQ-CH and the classical MQ are 0.3916 and 1.4591, respectively, whereas that of MQ-IH is 0.3698. The performance of MQ-IH is further evaluated by qualitative and quantitative analysis through a real-world example of DEM construction with the stereo-images-derived elevation points. Results demonstrate that compared with the classical interpolation methods, including natural neighbor (NN, OK and ANUDEM (a program that calculates regular grid digital elevation models (DEMs with sensible shape and drainage structure from arbitrarily large topographic data sets, and two versions of MQ, including the\n\nPlasticity in the Huber value contributes to homeostasis in leaf water relations of a mallee Eucalypt with variation to groundwater depth.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCarter, Jennifer L; White, Donald A\n\n2009-11-01\n\nInformation on how vegetation adapts to differences in water supply is critical for predicting vegetation survival, growth and water use, which, in turn, has important impacts on site hydrology. Many field studies assess adaptation to water stress by comparing between disparate sites, which makes it difficult to distinguish between physiological or morphological changes and long-term genetic adaptation. When planting trees into new environments, the phenotypic adaptations of a species to water stress will be of primary interest. This study examined the response to water availability of Eucalyptus kochii ssp. borealis (C. Gardner) D. Nicolle, commonly integrated with agriculture in south-western Australia for environmental and economic benefits. By choosing a site where the groundwater depth varied but where climate and soil type were the same, we were able to isolate tree response to water supply. Tree growth, leaf area and stand water use were much larger for trees over shallow groundwater than for trees over a deep water table below a silcrete hardpan. However, water use on a leaf area basis was similar in trees over deep and shallow groundwater, as were the minimum leaf water potential observed over different seasons and the turgor loss point. We conclude that homeostasis in leaf water use and water relations was maintained through a combination of stomatal control and adjustment of sapwood-to-leaf area ratios (Huber value). Differences in the Huber value with groundwater depth were associated with different sapwood-specific conductivity and water use on a sapwood area basis. Knowledge of the coordination between water supply, leaf area, sapwood area and leaf transpiration rate for different species will be important when predicting stand water use.\n\nPROPIEDADES TECNOLÃGICAS DE LA MADERA DE ALGARROBO (Hymenaea oblongifolia Huber., DE BAGADÃ-CHOCÃ, COLOMBIA\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYessica B.

The amount of 24 veneers was used with the dimensions 25 x 25 cm, that were compressed under different times (5, 10 and 15 minutes at 150Â°C and pressure at 1 N.mm-2, constituting three treatments and one untreated. Plywood were bonded with resorcinol-formaldehyde, glue consumption of 360 g.m-2 at ambient temperature and pressure of 1 N.mm-2 for 10 hours. The samples were evaluated by colorimetric analysis and physical and mechanical properties. Colorimetric analysis showed that there was a darkening of the wood toward the increase of treatment time. The treatment was not efficient in reducing swelling, only reducing absorption of water. The mechanical properties were not significantly affected by the treatment.\n\nScarification with sulphuric acid of Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke seeds - FABACEAE EscarificaÃ§Ã£o com Ã¡cido sulfÃºrico de sementes de Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke - FABACEAE\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEniel David Cruz\n\n2007-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Seed coat impermeability to water occurs in many species, including Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke. To promote germination in seeds with coat impermeability the use of sulphuric acid (H2SO4 is recommended. The objective of this study was to identify a better time for the scarification with sulphuric acid for S. amazonicum seeds. The effect of scarification with sulphuric acid for 20, 40 and 60 min on germination and speed germination was studied for seeds that were either sowed immediately after scarification or after a 24-hour period of immersion in water. Seeds were sown on a mix of sand and sawdust (1:1. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications of 50 seeds. The statistical analysis of germination was carried out at six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 days after sowing, in a factorial scheme. For speed germination the means were compared by the Tukey test. There was an interaction between treatments to overcome dormancy and immersion time after scarification in most evaluations. Immersion in water accelerated the beginning of germination. All treatments to overcome dormancy promoted seed germination. However, scarification for 60 min, showed better germination, 92% when immediately sown and 86.5% when sown after 24 hours. Speed germination index was highest for scarified seeds for 60 min followed by immersion in water. Scarification for 60 min was the most efficient treatment to promote germination in S. amazonicum seeds.Impermeabilidade do tegumento da semente Ã Ã¡gua ocorre em muitas espÃ©cies, inclusive em Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke.

Exercise therapy has been recognized as an effective method for low back pain treatment. In spite of this, it is not clear which of the various exercise therapy programs lead to better results. Therefore, the present analyze the efficacy of a HUBER study aims to exercise system mediated sensorimotor training protocol on proprioceptive system, lumbar movement control (LMC) and quality of life (QOL) in patients with chronic non-specific LBP. Quasi-experimental study. 53 patients with chronic non-specific LBP (mean age 37.55 Â± 6.67 years,and Body Mass Index (BMI) 22.4 Â± 3.33) were selected by using Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMQ) and were assigned into two experimental (N= 27) and control groups (N= 26) The experimental group underwent a five-week (10 sessions) Sensorimotor training by using the Human Body Equalizer (HUBER) spine force under the supervision of an investigator. The movement control battery tests, the HUBER machine testing option, goniometer and visual analogue scale used for movement control, neuromuscular coordination, proprioception and LBP assessment respectively. The assessments were completed in pre-test and after five weeks. The paired and sample T tests were used for data analysis in SPSS program version 18 (Significance level were set at a P value pain scores of subjects with chronic non-specific LBP in the sensorimotor group (P= 0.001). In this study, only the short term effects of the sensorimotor training were examined.

We specifically study the use of central statistical monitoring (CSM) to support RBM. Under an RBM paradigm, we claim that CSM has a key role to play in identifying the \"risks to the most critical data elements and processes\" that will drive targeted oversight. In order to support this claim, we first see how to characterize the risks that may affect clinical trials. We then discuss how CSM can be understood as a tool for providing a set of data-driven key risk indicators (KRIs), which help to organize adaptive targeted monitoring. Several case studies are provided where issues in a clinical trial have been identified thanks to targeted investigation after the identification of a risk using CSM. Using CSM to build data-driven KRIs helps to identify different kinds of issues in clinical trials. This ability is directly linked with the exhaustiveness of the CSM approach and its flexibility in the definition of the risks that are searched for when identifying the KRIs. In practice, a CSM assessment of the clinical database seems essential to ensure data quality. The atypical data patterns found in some centers and variables are seen as KRIs under a RBM approach. Targeted monitoring or data management queries can be used to confirm whether the KRIs point to an actual issue or not.\n\nAnÃ¡lise espacial da distribuiÃ§Ã£o de cigarras (Quesada gigas Oliver em povoamentos de paricÃ¡ (Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke na regiÃ£o de Dom Eliseu, PA Analysis of the spatial distribution of buzzers (Quesada gigas Oliver in parica stands(Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke in Dom Eliseu-PA\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVicente Paulo Soares\n\n2008-04-01\n\nFull Text Available O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar, atravÃ©s da anÃ¡lise espacial de dados geogrÃ¡ficos, a precisÃ£o de procedimentos de mapeamento das populaÃ§Ãµes de cigarras (Quesada gigas Oliver em povoamentos de paricÃ¡ (Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke, localizados no MunicÃ­pio de Dom Eliseu, PA, mediante a aplicaÃ§Ã£o de dois interpoladores (krigagem e inverso do quadrado da distÃ¢ncia.

P.; Antipin, A. M.; Verin, I. A.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nHuber-5042 diffractometer with a closed-cycle Displex DE-202 helium cryostat is a unique scientific instrument for carrying out X-ray diffraction experiments when studying the single crystal structure in the temperature range of 20-300 K. To make the service life longer and develop new experimental techniques, the diffractometer control is transferred to a new hardware and software platform. To this end, a modern computer; a new detector reader unit; and new control interfaces for stepper motors, temperature controller, and cryostat vacuum pumping system are used. The system for cooling the X-ray tube, the high-voltage generator, and the helium compressor and pump for maintaining the desired vacuum in the cryostat are replaced. The system for controlling the primary beam shutter is upgraded. A biological shielding is installed. The new program tools, which use the Linux Ubuntu operating system and SPEC constructor, include a set of drivers for control units through the aforementioned interfaces. A program for searching reflections from a sample using fast continuous scanning and a priori information about crystal is written. Thus, the software package for carrying out the complete cycle of precise diffraction experiment (from determining the crystal unit cell to calculating the integral reflection intensities) is upgraded. High quality of the experimental data obtained on this equipment is confirmed in a number of studies in the temperature range from 20 to 300 K.\n\nPostimehe Å¾Ã¼rii hindab vÃµistlusfilme\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2007-01-01\n\nToimetuse Å¾Ã¼rii koosseisus Peeter Simm, Karol Ansip, Sakarias Lepik, Jevgenia Tirdatova ja Kris Taska hindab PÃFFil nÃ¤idatavaid filme.

(2016)'s recent study on children solving the Tower of Hanoi (ToH) problem on a touchscreen app offers a clear counter example. Huber et al. (2016) reported that children transferred learning from media to the physical world. As this finding arguably differs from that of prior research in this area, the current study tests whether the Huber et al. (2016) results could be replicated. Additionally, we extended the scope of the Huber et al. (2016) work by testing a broader age range, including children as young as 3 years, and using a culturally distinct participant pool. The results of the current study verified Huber et al.'s (2016) conclusion that 4- to 6-year-old children are capable of transferring the ToH learning from touchscreen devices to the physical version of the puzzle. Children under 4 years of age, in contrast, showed little ability to improve at the ToH problem regardless of the practice modality-suggesting that a different problem-solving task is required to probe very young children's ability to learn from touchscreen apps.\n\nDual-Modality Prostate Imaging with PET and Transrectal Ultrasound\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2011-09-01\n\nDownloaded on April 07,2010 at 23:12:26 UTC from IEEE Xplore .

Previously, we have exclusively used a quadratic penalty in our restoration objective function. However, a quadratic penalty does not excel at preserving edges while reducing noise. Here, we derive a restoration update equation for nonquadratic penalties. Additionally, we perform a feasibility study to extend our sinogram restoration method to a helical cone-beam geometry and clinical data. Methods: A restoration update equation for nonquadratic penalties is derived using separable parabolic surrogates (SPS). A method for calculating sinogram degradation coefficients for a helical cone-beam geometry is proposed. Using simulated data, sinogram restorations are performed using both a quadratic penalty and the edge-preserving Huber penalty. After sinogram restoration, Fourier-based analytical methods are used to obtain reconstructions, and resolution-noise trade-offs are investigated. For the fan-beam geometry, a comparison is made to image-domain SPS reconstruction using the Huber penalty. The effects of varying object size and contrast are also investigated. For the helical cone-beam geometry, we investigate the effect of helical pitch (axial movement/rotation). Huber-penalty sinogram restoration is performed on 3D clinical data, and the reconstructed images are compared to those generated with no restoration. Results: We find that by applying the edge-preserving Huber penalty to our sinogram restoration methods, the reconstructed image has a better resolution-noise relationship than an image produced using a quadratic penalty in the sinogram restoration. However, we find that this relatively straightforward approach to edge preservation in the sinogram domain is affected by the physical size of imaged objects in addition\n\n76 FR 72389 - Pacific Fishery Management Council; Public Meetings/Workshop\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2011-11-23\n\n... languages other than English, go to https://nwfsc.webex.com/nwfsc/j.php?ED=164913422&UID=1227485477&ORT=MiM0... https://nwfsc.webex.com/nwfsc/j.php?ED=164913422&UID=1227485477&RT=MiM0 .

A. Gorodnichev\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Laser gas analysers are the most promising for the rapid quantitative analysis of gaseous air pollution. A laser gas analysis problem is that there are instable results in reconstruction of gas mixture components concentration under real noise in the recorded laser signal. This necessitates using the special processing algorithms. When reconstructing the quantitative composition of multi-component gas mixtures from the multispectral laser measurements are efficiently used methods such as Tikhonov regularization, quasi-solution search, and finding of Bayesian estimators. These methods enable using the single measurement results to determine the quantitative composition of gas mixtures under measurement noise. In remote sensing the stationary gas formations or in laboratory analysis of the previously selected (when the gas mixture is stationary air samples the reconstruction procedures under measurement noise of gas concentrations in multicomponent mixtures can be much simpler. The paper considers a problem of multispectral laser analysis of stationary gas mixtures for which it is possible to conduct a series of measurements. With noise overshoots in the recorded laser signal (and, consequently, overshoots of gas concentrations determined by a single measurement must be used stable (robust estimation techniques for substantial reducing an impact of the overshoots on the estimate of required parameters. The paper proposes the Huber method to determine gas concentrations in multicomponent mixtures under signal overshoot. To estimate the value of Huber parameter and the efficiency of Huber's method to find the stable estimates of gas concentrations in multicomponent stationary mixtures from the laser measurements the mathematical modelling was conducted. Science & Education of the Bauman MSTU 108 The mathematical modelling results show that despite the considerable difference among the errors of the mixture gas components themselves a character of\n\nA âInsularizaÃ§Ã£oâ dos Continentes e a Perda de Biodiversidade\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaira Smith\n\n2010-10-01\n\nFull Text Available RESENHA QUAMMEN, David.

Currently few organizations take the pain of verifying the efficacy of these policies. Different standards and procedures exist about methods of measuring efficacy of information security policies. Choosing and implementing them depends mainly on the key performance indicators (KPIs) and key risk indicators (KRIs) of any particular organization.

The following known GAs were identified by comparison of their Kovats retention indices (KRIs) and mass spectra with those of standards: GA1, GA8, GA9, GA19, GA20, 16 beta,17-dihydro-17-hydroxy GA20, GA23, GA28, GA29, GA34, GA44, and GA97. Several of these have not been previously reported from Populus. In addition, two new GAs were identified as 12 beta-hydroxy GA53 (GA127) and 16 beta,17-dihydro-17-hydroxy GA53 and their structures were confirmed by partial synthesis. Evidence was found of 16,17-dihydro-16,17-dihydroxy GA9, 16,17-dihydro-16,17-dihydroxy GA12, 12-hydroxy GA14, and GA34-catabolite by comparison of mass spectra and KRIs with published data. Several putative GAs (hydroxy- and dihydroxy-GA12-like) were also found. The catabolites of active GAs or of key precursors, hydroxylated at C-2 in stems and either C-2, C-12, C-17, or C-16,17 in capsules, were the major proportion of the GAs.\n\nDoD Civilian Training: Source, Content, Frequency and Cost\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1994-03-01\n\nstatistics.

The method is based on Chambolle and Pock primal-dual algorithm for solving general convex optimization problems. Diagonal preconditioning is used to ensure the convergence of the algorithm to the global minimum. We consider three robust regularizers liable to provide acceptable results in diffeomorphic registration: Huber, V-Huber and total generalized variation. The Huber norm is used in the image similarity term. The primal-dual equations are derived for the stationary and the non-stationary parameterizations of diffeomorphisms. The resulting algorithms have been implemented for running in the GPU using Cuda. For the most memory consuming methods, we have developed a multi-GPU implementation. The GPU implementations allowed us to perform an exhaustive evaluation study in NIREP and LPBA40 databases. The experiments showed that, for all the considered regularizers, the proposed method converges to diffeomorphic solutions while better preserving discontinuities at the boundaries of the objects compared to baseline diffeomorphic registration methods. In most cases, the evaluation showed a competitive performance for the robust regularizers, close to the performance of the baseline diffeomorphic registration methods.\n\nIMPLICATIONS OF CROSS DOMAIN FIRES IN MULTI-DOMAIN BATTLE\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2017-04-06\n\nmeeting the threats or defeating the challenges posed by todayâs enemy.

Why? Because that's the best way to service the customers that form the core of the bank's business, says vice chairman Dick Huber. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Continental participated heavily with Penn Square Bank in energy investments. When falling energy prices burst Penn Square's bubble in 1982, Continental was stuck with more than $1 billion in bad loans. Eight years later when Dick Huber came on board, Continental was working hard to restore its once solid reputation. Executives had made many tough decisions already, altering the bank's focus from retail to business banking and laying off thousands of employees. Yet management still needed to cut costs and improve services to stay afloat. Regulators, investors, and analysts were watching every step. Continental executives, eager to focus on the bank's core mission of serving business customers, decided to outsource one after another in-house service--from cafeteria services to information technology. While conventional wisdom holds that banks must retain complete internal control of IT, Continental bucked this argument when it entered into a ten-year, multimillion-dollar contract with Integrated Systems Solutions Corporation. Continental is already reaping benefits from outsourcing IT. Most important, Continental staffers today focus on their true core competencies: intimate knowledge of customers' needs and relationships with customers.\n\nDuane retraction syndrome: causes, effects and management strategies\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKekunnaya R\n\n2017-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Ramesh Kekunnaya, Mithila Negalur Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus Services, Child Sight Institute, Jasti V Ramannama Childrenâs Eye Care Center, KAR Campus, Hyderabad, India Abstract: Duane retraction syndrome (DRS is a congenital eye movement anomaly characterized by variable horizontal duction deficits, with narrowing of the palpebral fissure and globe retraction on attempted adduction, occasionally accompanied by upshoot or downshoot. The etiopathogenesis of this condition can be explained by a spectrum of mechanical, innervational, neurologic and genetic abnormalities occurring independently or which influence each other giving rise to patterns of clinical presentations along with a complex set of ocular and systemic anomalies. Huber type I DRS is the most common form of DRS with an earlier presentation, while Huber type II is the least common presentation. Usually, patients with unilateral type I Duane syndrome have esotropia more frequently than exotropia, those with type II have exotropia and those with type III have esotropia and exotropia occurring equally common. Cases of bilateral DRS may have variable presentation depending upon the type of presentation in each eye. As regards its management, DRS classification based on primary position deviation as esotropic, exotropic or orthotropic is more relevant than Huberâs classification before planning surgery. Surgical approach to these patients is challenging and must be individualized based on the amount of ocular deviation, abnormal head position, associated globe retraction and overshoots.

Die Kunstliteratur of 1924 became his fifth and final such handbook, and was published with the intention to elucidate the pre-history of the history of art as an academic discipline. It is natural that Giorgio Vasari has a place at the core of such a story. However, Schlosser possessed an unrivalled knowledge of the relevant written and theoretical sources, and his unusually consistent approach found Lorenzo Ghiberti to be the actual founder of the subject and Winckelmann to have finally overcome the relatively pernicious influence of Vasari. This chapter from the centre of his book therefore still today remains the best critical account of Vasariâs writings from a broader point of view.\n\nBranch age and light conditions determine leaf-area-specific conductivity in current shoots of Scots pine.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGrÃ¶nlund, Leila; HÃ¶lttÃ¤, Teemu; MÃ¤kelÃ¤, Annikki\n\n2016-08-01\n\nShoot size and other shoot properties more or less follow the availability of light, but there is also evidence that the topological position in a tree crown has an influence on shoot development. Whether the hydraulic properties of new shoots are more regulated by the light or the position affects the shoot acclimation to changing light conditions and thereby to changing evaporative demand. We investigated the leaf-area-specific conductivity (and its components sapwood-specific conductivity and Huber value) of the current-year shoots of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in relation to light environment and topological position in three different tree classes. The light environment was quantified in terms of simulated transpiration and the topological position was quantified by parent branch age. Sample shoot measurements included length, basal and tip diameter, hydraulic conductivity of the shoot, tracheid area and density, and specific leaf area. In our results, the leaf-area-specific conductivity of new shoots declined with parent branch age and increased with simulated transpiration rate of the shoot. The relation to transpiration demand seemed more decisive, since it gave higher R(2) values than branch age and explained the differences between the tree classes. The trend of leaf-area-specific conductivity with simulated transpiration was closely related to Huber value, whereas the trend of leaf-area-specific conductivity with parent branch age was related to a similar trend in sapwood-specific conductivity.

The relationships among the trichotomy signs associated with the codes represent the horizon of the Javanese society regarding the Keris culture. All the Keris signs establish the abstracts relationship model that never has any function before being associated with the code. Principally, people who become the message recipient can perform decoding act by associating the signs with certain conventions. The expression articulation through the Keris elements is a symbol in the typology of signs. The Javanese societyâs response or appreciation concerning the invented conventions needs to be investigated to conversely understand the system of signs production. The word kris, as an example, is semiotically classified into other words; keris, dhuhung, dhuwung, curiga, wangkingan, duwung, curiga, and katga, all of which refers to the same sign, which is the tipped stabbing weapons and covered in scabbard. This study found the cultural event of the ideological masking which represents certain period i.e. the deconstructive meanings on the luk of keris (kemba and rengkol illustrated the ideological transformation from Hinduism to Islamic era. Â Dalam mengartikulasikan unsur visual Keris kita dihadapkan dengan konsep simbol, di mana setiap simbol sesuai dengan tipologi tanda-tanda. Hubungan antara trikotomi tanda-tanda yang terkait dengan kode mewakili cakrawala masyarakat Jawa tentang budaya Keris.

Pada prinsipnya orang yang menjadi sasaran penyampaian pesan bisa melakukan decoding dengan cara mengaitkan tanda-tanda pada keris dengan konvensi-konvensi tertentu.

Image registration, an ill-posed optimization problem, is solved using a gradient-descent-based method and some fundamental theorems in calculus of variations. Euler-Lagrange equations with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are obtained. These equations are discretized by multigrid and finite difference numerical techniques. The method is applied to the registration of brain MR images of size 65Ã65. Computational results indicate that the presented method is quite fast and efficient in the registration of deformable medical images.\n\nModernizaciÃ³n ecolÃ³gica y polÃ­ticas ambientales: notas para un debate (Brasil).\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nOlivier, Alejandro Gabriel; DomÃ­nguez, Carlos Federico\n\n2011-01-01\n\nEl propÃ³sito del presente artÃ­culo es explorar conceptualmente la teorÃ­a de la modernizaciÃ³n ecolÃ³gica.

The scholarly approach and empirical evidence in âTeachers and Learningâ (Hutchings, Huber & Ciccone, 2011, Chapter 2 provided me with the scientific and social support I needed to publically challenge existing norms regarding teaching practices, reevaluate my data collection efforts, and advocate for change based on best practices, not on tradition, both inside my classroom and beyond.\n\nManlighet i kris?

As such, they predict that limiting the amount of time to make a decision should decrease rather than increase the size of contextual effects. This prediction was tested across four levels of time pressure on both the asymmetric dominance (Huber, Payne, and Puto, 1982 and compromise (Simonson, 1989 decoy effects in choice. Overall, results supported this prediction, with both types of decoy effects found to be larger as time pressure decreased.\n\nProjection Pursuit Through Ï-Divergence Minimisation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJacques Touboul\n\n2010-06-01\n\nFull Text Available In his 1985 article (âProjection pursuitâ, Huber demonstrates the interest of his method to estimate a density from a data set in a simple given case. He considers the factorization of density through a Gaussian component and some residual density. Huberâs work is based on maximizing KullbackâLeibler divergence. Our proposal leads to a new algorithm. Furthermore, we will also consider the case when the density to be factorized is estimated from an i.i.d. sample. We will then propose a test for the factorization of the estimated density. Applications include a new test of fit pertaining to the elliptical copulas.\n\nEFFECT OF THERMO-MECHANICAL TREATMENT ON PROPERTIES OF PARICA PLYWOODS (Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMÃ­rian de Almeida Costa\n\nFull Text Available ABSTRACT Thermo-mechanical treatment is a technique for wood modification in which samples are densified by means of heat and mechanical compression, applied perpendicularly to fibers, which under different combinations of time, temperature, and pressure increases wood density and thus improve some of its properties. This study aimed to treat thermo-mechanically parica plywood and observe the effects on its physical and mechanical properties. Specimens were submitted to two treatments, 120 and 150 ÂºC, remaining under pressure for seven minutes and, subsequently, under zero pressure for 15 minutes. Results showed a significant increase in specific mass from 0.48 g cm-3 to an average of 0.56 g cm-3, and a compression ratio of about 31.7% on average. Physical properties also varied significantly and results showed that treated samples swelled and absorbed more water than those untreated, leading to a greater thickness non-return rate. This indicates the proposed thermal treatments did not release the internal compressive stress generated during panel pressing, not improving its dimensional stability as a result. On the other hand, mechanical properties were positively affected, leading to an increase of 27.5% and 51.8% in modulus of rupture after treatments at 120 and 150 ÂºC, respectively. Modulus of elasticity and glue-line shear strength did not vary statistically and Janka hardness was 29.7% higher after treatment at 150 ÂºC.\n\nSELEÃÃO DE MARCADORES ISSR PARA Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum (Huber ex.

It is species considered of great potential, due its wide use. Aiming reproducing the species, in vitro, stem segments of plantlets established in vitro were excised and inoculated on solid MS supplemented with 0; 1,0; 1,5; 2,0; 2,5 and 3,0 mg.L-1 of BAP with 3% of sucrose, 0,1% of PVP and one control. The activities had been carried out in the Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Biotechnology of the Embrapa Oriental, Amazon, and Belem (PA. The cultures had been under sun photo period for 16 hours 25+ 1Â°C of temperature. After three weeks of cultivation the explants were evaluated, counting the number and length of explants shoots. The treatment with 3 mg.L-1 BAP presented greater number of shoot proliferation with 2,14 for explants. The shoots were transferred to MS medium in the same conditions of culture for rooting.\n\nPlasticity in vulnerability to cavitation of Pinus canariensis occurs only at the driest end of an aridity gradient\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRosana eLÃ³pez\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Water availability has been considered one of the crucial drivers of species distribution. However, the increasing of temperatures and more frequent water shortages could overcome the ability of long-lived species to cope with rapidly changing conditions. Growth and survival of natural populations adapted to a given site, transferred and tested in other environments as part of provenance trials, can be interpreted as a simulation of ambient changes at the original location. We compare the intraspecific variation and the relative contribution of plasticity to adaptation of key functional traits related to drought resistance: vulnerability to cavitation, efficiency of the xylem to conduct water and biomass allocation. We use six populations of Canary Island pine growing in three provenance trials (wet, dry and xeric. We found that the variability for hydraulic traits was largely due to phenotypic plasticity, whereas genetic variation was limited and almost restricted to hydraulic safety traits and survival. Trees responded to an increase in climate dryness by lowering growth, and increasing leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity by means of increasing the Huber value. Vulnerability to cavitation only showed a plastic response in the driest provenance trial located in the ecological limit of the species. This trait was more tightly correlated with annual precipitation, drought length and temperature oscillation at the origin of the populations than hydraulic efficiency or the Huber value. Vulnerability to cavitation was directly related to survival in the dry and the xeric provenance trials, illustrating its importance in determining drought resistance. In a new climatic scenario where more frequent and intense droughts are predicted, the magnitude of extreme events together with the fact that plasticity of cavitation resistance is only shown in the very dry limit of the species could hamper the capacity to adapt and buffer against environmental\n\nNO{sub 2} detection by DFWM and LITGS techniques\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nFantoni, Roberta; Giorgi, Mariano [ENEA, Centro Ricerche Frascati, Rome (Italy). Dipt. Innovazione; De Dominicis, Luigi\n\n1997-03-01\n\nLaser-induced grating techniques indicated as D.F.W.M. (Degenerate Four Wave Mixing) and L.I.T.G.S. (Laser Induced Thermal Grating Spectroscopy) have been developed in different geometries in order to detect small concentration of nitric oxide in a broad pressure and temperature range. NO{sub 2} spectra in the Douglas-Huber band originating from the {sup 2} B{sub 1} (k` = 0) - {sup 2} A{sub 1} (k` = 1) transition have been measured at low and high resolution. The role played by population and thermal gratings has been investigated in various experimental conditions upon addition of buffer gases in calibration cells at room temperature and on heated samples.\n\nSMART marine goals, targets and management - Is SDG 14 operational or aspirational, is 'Life Below Water' sinking or swimming?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCormier, Roland; Elliott, Michael\n\n2017-10-15\n\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), adopted in September 2015, are accompanied by targets which have to be met individually and collectively by the signatory states. SDG14 Life Below Water aims to lay the foundation for the integrated and sustainable management of the oceans. However, any environmental management has to be based around targets which are SMART - specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time bounded - otherwise it is not possible to determine whether management actions are successful and achieve the desired aims. The discussion here shows that many of the targets adopted for SDG14, and especially a detailed analysis of Target 1, are aspirational rather than fully quantified. In order to move towards making the targets operational, we advocate merging the language of environmental management with that used by industry for linking risks to the environment, management performance and ensuing controls. By adopting an approach which uses Key Performance Indicators ('KPIs'), Key Risk Indicators ('KRIs') and Key Control Indicators ('KCIs'), we advocate that a degree of rigour leading to defendable actions can be brought to marine management.
