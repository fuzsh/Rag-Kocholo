        "text": "Both the available huge amount of data and the urgent need of extracting a meaningful knowledge have increased the data mining’s importance. In the recent studies, the data mining healthcare applications have become more of an issue owing to the healthcare activities’ own vital significance such as immediate blood inventory requirements in hospitals. In this study, we investigated the hospitals’ blood bank demands in order to forecast the successor blood consumptions. According to this blood consumption prediction, we generated three and six months plans by using dynamic programming.\n\nThe purpose of this work is the food process design optimization for the production of African traditional hot-smoked products. Based on a methodology of interpretation and aggregation of multiple industrial constraints, a multi-objective decision tool is developed for improving the technological performances of productivity, energy efficiency and product quality. A genetic algorithm evaluates various design alternatives and converges to the most desirable solution. The optimized solution is then subjected to a sensitivity analysis to consider the lack of reliability of some field data.\n\nWe consider the classical optimal consumption and portfolio investment problem subject to a random inflation in the consumption good prices over time. Both the cases when the investor observes the consumption good prices and when he receives noisy observations on those are treated. We derive the optimal policy and show that a modified Mutual Fund Theorem consisting of three funds holds in both cases.\n\n10 Sessions Monday 10: 45am-12: 15pm Session MA01-Financial Engineering 1, Chair: Kou in CZ 4, see page 49 1.

They have been used to model, analyze and evaluate control system behavior. They have also been used in software engineering.\n\nIn a system of emergency care the minimization of ambulances response times and waiting in queues of patients are crucial variables. This paper presents a computer simulation model for sizing the fleet of ambulances from Fireman's Operational Command Group in meeting the demands of the Central Region of Rio de Janeiro served by Souza Aguiar Hospital where we use the software SIMUL8. Essays were performed with the gradual increase in demand to achieve optimum combinations for the quantity and types of ambulances. The model can be adapted to other scenarios and regions where in addition to diagnosing the efficiency of a system can support the decision making process of purchasing new vehicles."
