Abstract: We prove an analogue of Alexander's Theorem for holomorphic mappings of the unit ball in a complex Hilbert space: Every holomorphic mapping which takes a piece of the boundary of the unit ball into the boundary of the unit ball and whose differential at some point of this boundary is onto is the restriction of an automorphism of the ball. We also show that it is enough to assume that the mapping is only Gateaux-holomorphic.

Abstract: This paper deals with the interplay of the geometry of the norm and the weak topology in Banach spaces. Both dual and intrinsic connections between weak forms of rotundity and smoothness ared discussed. Weakly exposed points, weakly locally uniformly rotund spaces, smoothness, duality and the interplay of all the above are studied. An example of a Banach space, which is midpoint locally uniformly rotund but not weakly locally uniformly rotund is given.

Abstract: The lower dimensional Busemann-Petty problem asks, whether $n$-dimensional origin-symmetric convex bodies, having smaller $i$-dimensional sections, necessarily have smaller volumes. For $i=1$, the affirmative answer is obvious. For $i>3$, the answer is negative. For $i=2$ and $i=3$, the problem is still open, except when the body with smaller sections is a body of revolution. In this case the answer is affirmative. The paper contains a complete solution to the problem in the more general situation, when the body with smaller sections is invariant under orthogonal transformations preserving coordinate subspaces $R^{l}$ and $R^{n-l}$ of $R^{n}$ for arbitrary fixed $0<l<n$.

Can it be embedded into some Banach space $Z$ with a finite dimensional decomposition having property (P), or more generally, having a property related to (P)? Secondly, given a class of Banach spaces, does there exist a Banach space in this class, or in a closely related one, which is universal for this class?

Abstract: The ``multiple of the inclusion plus compact problem'' which was posed by T.W.~Gowers in 1996 and Th.~Schlumprecht in 2003, asks whether for every infinite dimensional Banach space $X$ there exists a closed subspace $Y$ of $X$ and a bounded linear operator from $Y$ to $X$ which is not a compact perturbation of a multiple of the inclusion map from $Y$ to $X$. We give sufficient conditions on the spreading models of seminormalized basic sequences of a Banach space $X$ which guarantee that the ``multiple of the inclusion plus compact'' problem has an affirmative answer for $X$. Our results strengthen a previous result of the first named author, E.~Odell, Th.~Schlumprecht and N.~Tomczak-Jaegermann as well as a result of Th.~Schlumprecht. We give an example of a Hereditarily Indecomposable Banach space where our results apply. For the proof of our main result we use an extension of E.~Odell's Schreier unconditionality result for arrays.

Abstract: In 1969 Lindenstrauss and Rosenthal showed that if a Banach space is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of an L_p-space, then it is either a script L_p-space or isomorphic to a Hilbert space. This is the motivation of this paper where we study non--Hilbertian complemented operator subspaces of non commutative L_p-spaces and show that this class is much richer than in the commutative case. We investigate the local properties of some new classes of operator spaces for every $2<p< \\infty$ which can be considered as operator space analogues of the Rosenthal sequence spaces from Banach space theory, constructed in 1970. Under the usual conditions on the defining sequence sigma we prove that most of these spaces are operator script L_p-spaces, not completely isomorphic to previously known such spaces. However it turns out that some column and row versions of our spaces are not operator script L_p-spaces and have a rather complicated local structure which implies that the Lindenstrauss--Rosenthal alternative does not carry over to the non-commutative case.

Koldobsky\" by Emanuel Milman. Abstract: In 2000, A. Koldobsky asked whether two types of generalizations of the notion of an intersection-body, are in fact equivalent. The structures of these two types of generalized intersection-bodies have been studied by the author in [http://www.arxiv.org/math.MG/0512058], providing substantial positive evidence for a positive answer to this question. The purpose of this note is to construct a counter-example, which provides a surprising negative answer to this question in a strong sense. This negative answer implies the existence of a non-trivial non-negative function in the range of the spherical Radon transform.

Abstract: Properties of Lipschitz and d.c. surfaces of finite codimension in a Banach space, and properties of generated $\\sigma$-ideals are studied. These $\\sigma$-ideals naturally appear in the differentiation theory and in the abstract approximation theory. Using these properties, we improve an unpublished result of M. Heisler which gives an alternative proof of a result of D. Preiss on singular points of convex functions.

B. Johnson and Bentuo Zheng Status: R\n\nThis is an announcement for the paper \"A characterization of subspaces and quotients of reflexive Banach spaces with unconditional basis\" by W. B. Johnson and Bentuo Zheng. Abstract: We prove that the dual or any quotient of a separable reflexive Banach space with the unconditional tree property has the unconditional tree property. Then we prove that a separable reflexive Banach space with the unconditional tree property embeds into a reflexive Banach space with an unconditional basis. This solves several long standing open problems. In particular, it yields that a quotient of a reflexive Banach space with an unconditional finite dimensional decomposition embeds into a reflexive Banach space with an unconditional basis.

Casazza, Gitta Kutyniok, Darrin Speegle and Janet C. Tremain. Abstract: In this paper we study the Feichtinger Conjecture in frame theory, which was recently shown to be equivalent to the 1959 Kadison-Singer Problem in $C^{*}$-Algebras. We will show that every bounded Bessel sequence can be decomposed into two subsets each of which is an arbitrarily small perturbation of a sequence with a finite orthogonal decomposition. This construction is then used to answer two open problems concerning the Feichtinger Conjecture: 1. The Feichtinger Conjecture is equivalent to the conjecture that every unit norm Bessel sequence is a finite union of frame sequences. 2. Every unit norm Bessel sequence is a finite union of sets each of which is $\\omega$-independent for $\\ell_2$-sequences.

Abstract: In this paper, we study minimality properties of partly modified mixed Tsirelson spaces. A Banach space with a normalized basis (e_k) is said to be subsequentially minimal if for every normalized block basis (x_k) of (e_k), there is a further block (y_k) of (x_k) such that (y_k) is equivalent to a subsequence of (e_k). Sufficient conditions are given for a partly modified mixed Tsirelson space to be subsequentially minimal and connections with Bourgain's \\ell^{1}-index are established. It is also shown that a large class of mixed Tsirelson spaces fails to be subsequentially minimal in a strong sense.

Abstract: We prove Lp Poincare inequalities for functions on the discrete cube and their discrete gradient. We thus recover an exponential inequality and the concentration phenomenon for the uniform probability on the cube first obtained by Bobkov and Gotze. Inequalities involving the discrete gradient and powers of the discrete Laplacian are also considered, for the Lp norm or more general ones. Similar results hold true, replacing functions on the cube by elements of the CAR algebra and considering the annihilation operators and the number operator.

Abstract: Let Lambda be a set of three integers and let C_Lambda be the space of 2pi-periodic functions with spectrum in Lambda endowed with the maximum modulus norm. We isolate the maximum modulus points x of trigonometric trinomials T in C_Lambda and prove that x is unique unless |T| has an axis of symmetry. This permits to compute the exposed and the extreme points of the unit ball of C_Lambda, to describe how the maximum modulus of T varies with respect to the arguments of its Fourier coefficients and to compute the norm of unimodular relative Fourier multipliers on C_Lambda. We obtain in particular the Sidon constant of Lambda.

Abstract: We prove two basic conjectures on the distribution of the smallest singular value of random n times n matrices with independent entries. Under minimal moment assumptions, we show that the smallest singular value is of order n^{-1/2}, which is optimal for Gaussian matrices. Moreover, we give a optimal estimate on the tail probability. This comes as a consequence of a new and essentially sharp estimate in the Littlewood-Offord problem: for i.i.d. random variables X_k and real numbers a_k, determine the probability P that the sum of a_k X_k lies near some number v. For arbitrary coefficients a_k of the same order of magnitude, we show that they essentially lie in an arithmetic progression of length 1/p.

Abstract: We prove that if $X,Y$ are Banach spaces, $\\Omega$ a compact Hausdorff space and $U\\hbox{\\rm :}\\ C(\\Omega,X)\\rightarrow Y$ is a bounded linear operator, and if $U$ is a Dunford--Pettis operator the range of the representing measure $G(\\Sigma) \\subseteq DP(X,Y)$ is an uniformly Dunford--Pettis family of operators and $\\|G\\|$ is continuous at $\\emptyset$. As applications of this result we give necessary and/or sufficient conditions that some bounded linear operators on the space $C([0,1],X)$ with values in $c_{0}$ or $l_{p}$, ($1\\leq p<\\infty$) be Dunford--Pettis and/or compact operators, in which, Khinchin's inequality plays an important role.

Abstract: Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objects associated with sections of star bodies and invoking Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourier analysis. We review some known facts and give them new proofs. The main focus is interrelation between generalized cosine transforms of different kinds and their application to investigation of certain family of intersection bodies, which we call lambda-intersection bodies. The latter include k-intersection bodies (in the sense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of $L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restriction of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine transforms onto lower dimensional subspaces preserves their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to the study of sections of lambda-intersection bodies. A number of new characterizations of this class of bodies and examples are given.

Abstract: We provide examples of nonseparable spaces $X$ for which $C(X)$ admits an isometric shift of type I, which solves in the negative a problem proposed by Gutek {\\em et al.} (J. Funct. Anal. {\\bf 101} (1991), 97-119). We also give two independent methods for obtaining separable examples. The first one allows us in particular to construct examples with infinitely many nonhomeomorphic components in a subset of the Hilbert space $\\ell^2$. The second one applies for instance to sequences adjoined to any $n$-dimensional compact manifold (for $n \\ge 2$) or to the Sierpi\\'nski curve. The combination of both techniques lead to different examples involving a convergent sequence adjoined to the Cantor set: one method for the case when the sequence converges to a point in the Cantor set, and the other one for the case when it converges outside.

Abstract: This article is a continuation of a paper of the first author \\cite{F} about complex structures on real Banach spaces. We define a notion of even infinite dimensional real Banach space, and prove that there exist even spaces, including HI or unconditional examples from \\cite{F} and $C(K)$ examples due to Plebanek \\cite{P}. We extend results of \\cite{F} relating the set of complex structures up to isomorphism on a real space to a group associated to inessential operators on that space, and give characterizations of even spaces in terms of this group. We also generalize results of \\cite{F} about totally incomparable complex structures to essentially incomparable complex structures, while showing that the complex version of a space defined by S. Argyros and A. Manoussakis \\cite{AM} provide examples of essentially incomparable complex structures which are not totally incomparable.

Abstract: We prove that a Banach space X is not super-reflexive if and only if the hyperbolic infinite tree embeds metrically into X. We improve one implication of J.Bourgain's result who gave a metrical characterization of super-reflexivity in Banach spaces in terms of uniforms embeddings of the finite trees. A characterization of the linear type for Banach spaces is given using the embedding of the infinite tree equipped with a suitable metric.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate real convex-transitive Banach spaces X, which admit a 1-dimensional bicontractive projection P on X. Various mild conditions regarding the weak topology and the geometry of the norm are provided, which guarantee that such an X is in fact isometrically a Hilbert space. The results obtained can be regarded as partial answers to the well-known Banach-Mazur rotation problem, as well as to a question posed by B. Randrianantoanina in 2002 about convex-transitive spaces.

Abstract: Let $C_b(K)$ be the set of all bounded continuous (real or complex) functions on a complete metric space $K$ and $A$ a closed subspace of $C_b(K)$. Using the variational method, it is shown that the set of all strong peak functions in $A$ is dense if and only if the set of all strong peak points is a norming subset of $A$. As a corollary we show that if $X$ is a locally uniformly convex, complex Banach space, then the set of all strong peak functions in $\\mathcal{A}(B_X)$ is a dense $G_\\delta$ subset. Moreover if $X$ is separable, smooth and locally uniformly convex, then the set of all norm and numerical strong peak functions in $\\mathcal{A}_u(B_X:X)$ is a dense $G_\\delta$ subset. In case that a set of uniformly strongly exposed points of a (real or complex) Banach space $X$ is a norming subset of $\\mathcal{P}({}^n X)$ for some $n\\ge 1$, then the set of all strongly norm attaining elements in $\\mathcal{P}({}^n X)$ is dense, in particular, the set of all points at which the norm of $\\mathcal{P}({}^n X)$ is Fr\\'echet differentiable is a dense $G_\\delta$ subset.

Abstract: Suppose that T_t is a symmetric diffusion semigroup on L^2(X). We show that the tensor extension of T_t to L^p(X;B), where B belongs to a certain class of UMD spaces, exhibits pointwise convergence almost everywhere as t approaches zero. Our principal tools are vector-valued versions of maximal theorems due to Hopf--Dunford--Schwartz and Stein. These are proved using subpositivity and estimates on the bounded imaginary powers of the generator of T_t. An extension of these results to analytic continuations of T_t is also given.

Abstract: We extend the Bipolar Theorem of Brannath and Schachermayer (1999) to the space of nonnegative cadlag supermartingales on a filtered probability space. We formulate the notion of fork-convexity as an analogue to convexity in this setting. As an intermediate step in the proof of our main result we establish a conditional version of the Bipolar theorem. In an application to mathematical finance we describe the structure of the set of dual processes of the utility maximization problem of Kramkov and Schachermayer (1999) and give a budget-constraint characterization of admissible consumption processes in an incomplete semimartingale market.

Abstract: We show that the cyclic lamplighter group $C_2 \\bwr C_n$ embeds into Hilbert space with distortion ${\\rm O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\log n}\\right)$. This matches the lower bound proved by Lee, Naor and Peres in~\\cite{LeeNaoPer}, answering a question posed in that paper. Thus the Euclidean distortion of $C_2 \\bwr C_n$ is $\\Theta\\left(\\sqrt{\\log n}\\right)$. Our embedding is constructed explicitly in terms of the irreducible representations of the group. Since the optimal Euclidean embedding of a finite group can always be chosen to be equivariant, as shown by Aharoni, Maurey and Mityagin~\\cite{AhaMauMit} and by Gromov (see~\\cite{deCTesVal}), such representation-theoretic considerations suggest a general tool for obtaining upper and lower bounds on Euclidean embeddings of finite groups.

(delta-convex) function on a normed linear space is a function representable as a difference of two continuous convex functions. We show that an infinite dimensional analogue of Hartman's theorem on stability of d.c. functions under compositions does not hold in general. However, we prove that it holds in some interesting particular cases. Our main results about compositions are proved in the more general context of d.c. mappings between normed linear spaces.

Kalenda, L. Vesely, and L. Zajicek. Abstract: On each nonreflexive Banach space X there exists a positive continuous convex function f such that 1/f is not a d.c. function (i.e., a difference of two continuous convex functions). This result together with known ones implies that X is reflexive if and only if each everywhere defined quotient of two continuous convex functions is a d.c. function. Our construction gives also a stronger version of Klee's result concerning renormings of nonreflexive spaces and non-norm-attaining functionals.

Abstract: We consider the following two-player game played on a separable, infinite-dimensional Banach space X. Player S chooses a positive integer k_1 and a finite-codimensional subspace X_1 of X. Then player P chooses x_1 in the unit sphere of X_1. Moves alternate thusly, forever. We study this game in the following setting. Certain normalized, 1-unconditional sequences (u_i) and (v_i) are fixed so that S has a winning strategy to force P to select x_i's so that if the moves are (k_1,X_1,x_1,k_2,X_2,x_2,...), then (x_i) is dominated by (u_{k_i}) and/or (x_i) dominates (v_{k_i}). In particular, we show that for suitable (u_i) and (v_i) if X is reflexive and S can win both of the games above, then X embeds into a reflexive space Z with an FDD which also satisfies analogous block upper (u_i) and lower (v_i) estimates. Certain universal space consequences ensue. Archive classification: math.FA Mathematics Subject Classification: 46B20 Remarks: 30 pages, us"
