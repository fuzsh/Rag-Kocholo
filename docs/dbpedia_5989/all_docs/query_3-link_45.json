Teresa Ortuño Transportation industry <strong>is</strong> forced to face more complex problems every day, making it necessary to introduce new hard constraints such as precedence and loading constraints into <strong>the</strong> classical vehicle routing problems. In most cases <strong>the</strong> search performed by heur<strong>is</strong>tics only considers feasible solutions, but for heavily constrained problems like <strong>the</strong> one considered here th<strong>is</strong> may restrict too much <strong>the</strong> search process. In our approach we permit <strong>the</strong> use of infeasible solutions that may violate <strong>the</strong> capacity or precedence constraints, expanding <strong>the</strong> search space and making <strong>the</strong> search process more flexible. 2 - On time dependent 2-path formulations for <strong>the</strong> (cumulative) TSP Maria Teresa Godinho, Departamento de Matemática, Instituto Politécnico de Beja - CIO, Rua Afonso III,1, 78<strong>00</strong>-050, Beja, Portugal, mtgodinho@estig.ipbeja.pt, Lu<strong>is</strong> Gouveia It <strong>is</strong> well known that <strong>the</strong> so-called 2-path multi commodity formulations for <strong>the</strong> TSP do not improve <strong>the</strong> linear programming (lp) bound of <strong>the</strong> corresponding 1-path formulations. We show that th<strong>is</strong> <strong>is</strong> not <strong>the</strong> case when we use time-dependent formulations. In particular, we d<strong>is</strong>cuss: i)A new 2-path time dependent model with an lp bound tighter than <strong>the</strong> corresponding 1-path model ii)Valid inequalities which enhance <strong>the</strong> lp bound of <strong>the</strong> new model iii)Computational results showing that <strong>the</strong> new model enhanced with <strong>the</strong> valid inequalities produces very tight lp bounds, especially for <strong>the</strong> cumulative TSP. 3 - Routing costs estimation in a multiperiod location routing problem Maria Albareda Sambola, Stat<strong>is</strong>tics and Operations Research, Technical University of Catalonia, C. Colom, 11, <strong>08</strong>222, Terrassa, Spain, maria.albareda@upc.edu, Elena Fernandez, Stefan Nickel We address a multiperiod location routing problem where, for a given planning horizon, a location plan and <strong>the</strong> associated routing patterns have to be designed. Two scales are considered in <strong>the</strong> planning horizon (short and long periods) to model situations where routes are modified more frequently than locational dec<strong>is</strong>ions: facilities fixed for a long period remain fixed during several short periods. Routing costs are approximated through trees rooted at <strong>the</strong> depots. Computational experiments show that <strong>the</strong> plant opening patterns obtained using th<strong>is</strong> approximation are close to optimal <strong>TECHNICAL</strong> <strong>SESSIONS</strong> 4 - Partial order approach to compute shortest paths in multimodal networks Felipe Lillo, School of Computing and Ma<strong>the</strong>matical Sciences, Auckland University of Technology, AUT Tower, WT406, cnr Wakelfield & Rutland Street, Auckland CBD, 1142, Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand, flillovi@aut.ac.nz Few network techniques have been developed specifically for modelling multimodal networks.In th<strong>is</strong> work weighted coloured edge graphs are used as modeling tool, where colours represent <strong>the</strong> transport choices.Optimal paths are gotten by a partial order relation that compares each colour weight, resulting in a Pareto set of paths.A modified Dijkstra’s algorithm <strong>is</strong> experimentally tested,yielding a prom<strong>is</strong>ing average case for <strong>the</strong> Pareto set.The algorithm <strong>is</strong> shown to be practical for networks at least as large as networks found in previous literature but still retains <strong>the</strong> multimodal traits. � MA-02 <strong>Monday</strong> <strong>08</strong>:<strong>00</strong>-<strong>09</strong>:<strong>20</strong> Schumann Driving time regulations in vehicle routing Stream: Transportation Planning Invited session Chair: Chr<strong>is</strong>toph Manuel Meyer, Department of Economics, Chair of Log<strong>is</strong>tics, University of Bremen, Wilhelm-Herbst-Straße 5, 28359, Bremen, Germany, meyer@wiwi.uni-bremen.de 1 - D<strong>is</strong>tributed dec<strong>is</strong>ion making in combined vehicle routing and rest period planning Chr<strong>is</strong>toph Manuel Meyer, Department of Economics, Chair of Log<strong>is</strong>tics, University of Bremen, Wilhelm-Herbst-Straße 5, 28359, Bremen, Germany, meyer@wiwi.uni-bremen.de, Herbert Kopfer In practice <strong>the</strong> problem of vehicle routing and scheduling under consideration of breaks and rest periods <strong>is</strong> d<strong>is</strong>tributed over two dec<strong>is</strong>ion making units. Usually, schedulers are responsible for <strong>the</strong> clustering and routing while drivers perform <strong>the</strong> rest period planning. In th<strong>is</strong> talk <strong>the</strong> problem of combined vehicle routing and rest period planning <strong>is</strong> embedded into <strong>the</strong> hierarchical planning framework presented by Schneewe<strong>is</strong>s (2<strong>00</strong>3). The effects of different anticipation functions of <strong>the</strong> drivers’ planning model on <strong>the</strong> resulting vehicle schedule are analyzed by computational experiments. 2 - Dynamic programming for <strong>the</strong> vehicle routing problem with <strong>the</strong> ec social leg<strong>is</strong>lation Leendert Kok, Operational Methods for Production and Log<strong>is</strong>tics, University of Twente, P.O. Box 217, 75<strong>00</strong>AE , Enschede, Ne<strong>the</strong>rlands, a.l.kok@utwente.nl, Marco Schutten, Erwin W. Hans We propose a restricted dynamic programming algorithm for <strong>the</strong> vehicle routing problem including <strong>the</strong> EC social leg<strong>is</strong>lation on driving and working hours. To comply with th<strong>is</strong> leg<strong>is</strong>lation, we propose a break scheduling algorithm which schedules necessary breaks and rest periods when customers are added to <strong>the</strong> end of partial vehicle routes. To <strong>the</strong> best of our knowledge, th<strong>is</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>the</strong> first method that sat<strong>is</strong>fies <strong>the</strong> leg<strong>is</strong>lation on both driving and working hours, and <strong>the</strong> first method that includes all optional rules in th<strong>is</strong> leg<strong>is</strong>lation. 3 - Evaluation of telematic data with respect to ecdriver regulations for reporting purposes Thomas Bousonville, Business and Admin<strong>is</strong>tration, Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft des Saarlandes, 1"
