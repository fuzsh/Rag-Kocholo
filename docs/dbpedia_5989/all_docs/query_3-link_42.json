The present study aims to investigate the antiproliferative activity on HEp 2 cells by the water extract of S. parvifolia leaves and to evaluate potential mechanisms. The plant extract was exposed to S. parvifolia for 24 hours and antiproliferative activity was quantified by Sulforhodamine B (SRB), 3-(4, 5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Morphological changes were observed after staining cells with ethidium bromide/acridine orange (EB/AO) and Giemsa dye. Comet assay was performed to evaluate the DNA damage. The toxicity of the plant extract was determined by brine shrimp lethality assay. S. parvifolia leaves reduced the cell proliferation in a dose and time dependent manner. A two fold increase in NO level was observed at higher concentrations. Morphological changes characteristic to apoptosis were observed in light microscopy, Giemsa and EB/AO stained cells. Fragmented DNA further confirmed its capacity to induce apoptosis. No lethality was observed with brine shrimps. The results suggest that Semecarpus parvifolia Thw induces apoptosis in HEp-2 cells through a NO dependent pathway.\n\nMorphological analyses suggest a new taxonomic circumscription for Hymenaea courbaril L. (Leguminosae, Caesalpinioideae).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSouza, Isys Mascarenhas; Funch, Ligia Silveira; de Queiroz, Luciano Paganucci\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHymenaea is a genus of the Resin-producing Clade of the tribe Detarieae (Leguminosae: Caesalpinioideae) with 14 species. Hymenaea courbaril is the most widespread species of the genus, ranging from southern Mexico to southeastern Brazil. As currently circumscribed, Hymenaea courbaril is a polytypic species with six varieties: var. altissima, var. courbaril, var. longifolia, var. stilbocarpa, var. subsessilis, and var. villosa. These varieties are distinguishable mostly by traits related to leaflet shape and indumentation, and calyx indumentation. We carried out morphometric analyses of 14 quantitative (continuous) leaf characters in order to assess the taxonomy of Hymenaea courbaril under the Unified Species Concept framework. Cluster analysis used the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) were carried out based on the same morphometric matrix. Two sets of Analyses of Similarity and Non Parametric Multivariate Analysis of Variance were carried out to evaluate statistical support (1) for the major groups recovered using UPGMA and PCA, and (2) for the varieties. All analyses recovered three major groups coincident with (1) var. altissima, (2) var. longifolia, and (3) all other varieties. These results, together with geographical and habitat information, were taken as evidence of three separate metapopulation lineages recognized here as three distinct species. Nomenclatural adjustments, including reclassifying formerly misapplied types, are proposed.\n\nResponse of the desert shrub Krameria parvifolia after ten years of chronic gamma irradiation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nVollmer, A.T.; Bamberg, S.A.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nA northern Mojave Desert shrub community was irradiated by a 137 Cs source for a ten-year period. Leaf and fruit production, cover, and percent live stem of Krameria parvifolia shrubs were found to respond significantly to a radiation gradient with exposure rates ranging from 0.1 to 10 R/day. Fruit and leaf production were greatly reduced at exposures over 6 R/day. Above 7 R/day 16% of the shrubs were dead compared to 1.2% in a non-irradiated area. Reduced cover, density and live stem values indicate a trend toward a lower status of Krameria in the community at cumulative exposures above 25 kR. Observations indicate that an equilibrium in response to irradiation has not yet occurred. Radiosensitivity of K. parvifolia is attributed in part to its phenology.

For this study, the authenticity of commercial samples of jatobÃ¡ was verified by the identification of the main compounds and multivariate analysis and contamination by microbial presence analysis. The acute toxicity of the authentic jatobÃ¡ sap was also evaluated. The metabolites composition and multivariate analysis revealed that none of the commercial samples were authentic. In the microbiological contamination analysis, five of the six commercial samples showed positive cultures within the range of 1,700â100,000âCFU/mL and the authentic sap produced no signs of toxicity, and from a histological point of view, there was the maintenance of tissue integrity. In brief, the commercial samples were deemed inappropriate for consumption and represent a danger to the population.\n\nHuber effect and its application to micromotors\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShen, Yullia; Tay, Boon K.; Thompson, Benjamin; Soong, Wen L.; Davis, Bruce R.; Abbott, Derek\n\n1999-09-01\n\nThe micromotor is an extremely small device a few millimeters or less in size. Micromotors in the order of microns are realized by MEMS technology. Important applications in biomedicine include ultrasound probes for blood vessels, microrobots for colon intervention, smart pills and nanolitre pumps. Other uses include actuator for MOEMS and small variable capacitors. One exciting implication of micromotors is that they can be powered by rectifying mechanical vibrations. MEMS are playing an important role in our daily life as these systems are widely used in optics, communication and information systems, fluidics, biotechnology and medicine, scanning probe microscopes, automobiles and aerospace. There are a number technical challenges with micromotors, including the need to reduce stiction and increase torque. The precise geometry of the motor is usually tightly coupled to the stiction effect - the sticking of adjacent surfaces after release due to static friction. Piezoelectric, electrostatic and electromagnetic effects have been investigated to produce the electromotive force for the micromotor. However, we propose a micromotor design based on the Huber effect, as this will allow a new range of geometries and hence possibilities for managing stiction. To date, there have been no reported attempts at using the Huber effect, and this is possibly due to it being a poorly understood phenomenon. The reason for this is that large motors that utilize the Huber effect are self-destructive and hence have never been reliably characterized. Such motors are shown to be able to operate form a dc or ac source, and this property may be valuable in some MEMS applications.\n\nThe 2008 Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting: Robert Huber, Chemistry 1988. Interview by Klaus J. Korak.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHuber, Robert\n\n2008-11-25\n\nRobert Huber and his colleagues, Johann Deisenhofer and Hartmut Michel, elucidated the three-dimensional structure of the Rhodopseudomonas viridis photosynthetic reaction center. This membrane protein complex is a basic component of photosynthesis - a process fundamental to life on Earth - and for their work, Huber and his colleagues received the 1988 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Because structural information is central to understanding virtually any biological process, Huber likens their discovery to \"switching on the light\" for scientists trying to understand photosynthesis. Huber marvels at the growth of structural biology since the time he entered the field, when crystallographers worked with hand-made instruments and primitive computers, and only \"a handful\" of crystallographers would meet annually in the Bavarian Alps. In the \"explosion\" of structural biology since his early days of research, Huber looks to the rising generation of scientists to solve the remaining mysteries in the field - such as the mechanisms that underlie protein folding. A strong proponent of science mentorship, Huber delights in meeting young researchers at the annual Nobel Laureate Meetings in Lindau, Germany. He hopes that among these young scientists is an \"Einstein of biology\" who, he says with a twinkle in his eye, \"doesn't know it yet.\" The interview was conducted by JoVE co-founder Klaus J. Korak at the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting 2008 in Lindau, Germany.\n\nOutlier Detection in Regression Using an Iterated One-Step Approximation to the Huber-Skip Estimator\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nJohansen, SÃ¸ren; Nielsen, Bent\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn regression we can delete outliers based upon a preliminary estimator and reestimate the parameters by least squares based upon the retained observations.

We study the properties of an iteratively defined sequence of estimators based on this idea. We relate the sequence to the Huber...... that the normalized estimation errors are tight and are close to a linear function of the kernel, thus providing a stochastic expansion of the estimators, which is the same as for the Huber-skip. This implies that the iterated estimator is a close approximation of the Huber-skip...\n\nSynthesizing Huber's Problem Solving and Kolb's Learning Cycle: A Balanced Approach to Technical Problem Solving\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKamis, Arnold; Khan, Beverly K.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nHow do we model and improve technical problem solving, such as network subnetting?

Several tropical tree species are observed to form regular growth bands that may or may not form annually. Such growth was observed in one stem disk of the tropical legume Hymenaea courbaril near the area of David, Panama. In comparison to annual reference {Delta}{sup 14}C values from wood and air, the {Delta}{sup 14}C values from the secondary growth rings formed by H. courbaril were determined to be annual in nature in this one stem disk specimen. During this study, H. courbaril was also observed to translocate recently produced photosynthate into older growth rings as sapwood is converted to heartwood. This process alters the overall {Delta}{sup 14}C values of these transitional growth rings as cellulose with a higher {Delta}{sup 14}C content is translocated into growth rings with a relatively lower {Delta}{sup 14}C content. Once the annual nature of these growth rings is established, further stable isotope analyses on H. courbaril material in other studies may help to complete gaps in the understanding of short and of long term global climate patterns.\n\nFrom rubber tree homeland to rubber tree plantation: Jacques Huber and his studies on the culture of heveas in the East (1911-1912\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnna Raquel de Matos Castro\n\n2009-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper deals with the trip of the Swiss botanist Jacques Huber (1867-1914 to the main eastern rubber producing countries between 1911 and 1912. This trip was intended to develop studies on the cultivation of Hevea brasiliensis in that region. Huber was commissioned with the task by the State of ParÃ¡ governor JoÃ£o Coelho, who wanted to find solutions to the downfall of the regional economy. The economy of Amazonia was primarily based on rubber extractivism and was seriously endangered due the market controlled by England from eastern plantations. Back to Brazil, Huber published a report with information about the society, economy and environment where the rubber trees were cultivated. The report compiles scientific observations and the topics that motivated the regional elites in that context. In addition to the brief analyses of the report, photographs took by Huber in the East of rubber trees plantations, tree tapping and local workers are published.\n\nElm Tree (Ulmus parvifolia) Bark Bioprocessed with Mycelia of Shiitake (Lentinus edodes) Mushrooms in Liquid Culture: Composition and Mechanism of Protection against Allergic Asthma in Mice.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKim, Sung Phil; Lee, Sang Jong; Nam, Seok Hyun; Friedman, Mendel\n\n2016-02-03\n\nMushrooms can break down complex plant materials into smaller, more digestible and bioactive compounds. The present study investigated the antiasthma effect of an Ulmus parvifolia bark extract bioprocessed in Lentinus edodes liquid mycelium culture (BPUBE) against allergic asthma in chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized/challenged mice. BPUBE suppressed total IgE release from U266B1 cells in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. Inhibitory activity of BPUBE against OVA-specific IgE secretion in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was observed in OVA-sensitized/challenged asthmatic mice. BPUBE also inhibited OVA-specific IgG and IgG1 secretion into serum from the allergic mice, suggesting the restoration of a Th2-biased immune reaction to a Th1/Th2-balanced status, as indicated by the Th1/Th2 as well as regulatory T cell (Treg) cytokine profile changes caused by BPUBE in serum or BALF. Inflammatory cell counts in BALF and lung histology showed that leukocytosis and eosinophilia induced by OVA-sensitization/challenge were inhibited by the oral administration of BPUBE. Amelioration of eosinophil infiltration near the trachea was associated with reduced eotaxin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) levels. Changes in proinflammatory mediator levels in BALF suggest that BPUBE decreased OVA-sensitization-induced elevation of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). The finding that asthma-associated biomarker levels of OVA-sensitized/challenged mice were much more inhibited with BPUBE treatment than NPUBE (not-bioprocessed Ulmus parvifolia extract) treatment suggested the production of new bioactive compounds by the mushroom mycelia that may be involved in enhancing the observed antiasthmatic properties. The possible relation of the composition determined by proximate analysis and GC/MS to observed bioactivity is discussed. The results suggest that the elm tree (Ulmus parvifolia) bark bioprocessed with mycelia of shiitake (Lentinus edodes\n\nOntogÃªnese, anatomia e ultra-estrutura dos nectÃ¡rios extraflorais de Hymenaea stigonocarpa Mart. ex Hayne (Fabaceae - Caesalpinioideae Ontogenesis, anatomy, and ultrastructure of Hymenaea stigonocarpa Mart. ex Hayne (Fabaceae - Caesalpinioideae extrafloral nectaries\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÃlder AntÃ´nio Sousa Paiva\n\n2006-06-01\n\nFull Text Available O jatobÃ¡-do-cerrado (Hymenaea stigonocarpa Mart. ex Hayne apresenta nectÃ¡rios extraflorais (NEFs, os quais sÃ£o descritos pela primeira vez no gÃªnero.

The position states are estimated using acoustic range measurements relative to the leader, in which some disadvantages such as weak observability, large initial error and contaminated measurements with outliers are inherent. By integrating both merits of iterated divided difference filtering (IDDF) and Huber's M-estimation methodology, the new filtering method could not only achieve more accurate estimation and faster convergence contrast to standard divided difference filtering (DDF) in conditions of weak observability and large initial error, but also exhibit robustness with respect to outlier measurements, for which the standard IDDF would exhibit severe degradation in estimation accuracy. The correctness as well as validity of the algorithm is demonstrated through experiment results.\n\nnfluÃªncia do uso de biorreguladores no crescimento de Hymenaea courbaril (Nota CientÃ­fica.

Because of this characteristic, the aim of this study was to evaluate different pre-germination treatments and control in H. stigonocarpa seeds, namely: immersion in fire, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, acetone, ether and hot water (100Â°C, and mechanical scarification of the seed coat by roughing with sandpaper or cutting with nail clippers and washing in running water for 2 hours. The parameters analyzed were percentage of germination, germination speed index (GSI and the percentage of hard and firm seeds and dead seeds. The final results were: a germination: boiling water and sulfuric acid were superior to the control; b GSI: boiling water, sulfuric acid, fire and sandpaper were superior to the control and c percentage of dead seeds was not statistically different between the different treatments and control. In conclusion, boiling water and sulfuric acid, were the best treatments, with regard to the parameters examined.\n\nUlrik Huber and John Calvin: The Franeker Debate on Human Reason and the Bible (1686-1687)\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nGoudriaan, A.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn a doctoral dissertation De recta ratiocinatione (1686), Gisbert Wessel Duker claimed that \"the divinity of Scripture cannot be demonstrated except by reason.\" During the promotion session at the University of Franeker, the legal scholar Ulrik Huber (1636-1694) objected to this statement by\n\nAn application of Huber model on the effect of psychological empowerment of employees on organizational learning\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMahdie Mirzaiefar\n\n2014-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The purpose of this descriptiveâsurvey study is to determine the effect of psychological empowerment of employees on organizational learning based on Huber model.

It were used the wood of jatobÃ¡ (Hymenaea courbaril) with reddish brown coloration, and tauari (Couratari oblongifolia) with yellowish olive coloration. Samples of these woods were subjected to four cycles of ultraviolet radiation (UV) amounting to a total of 168 hours of irradiation and at 350 nm of wave length. Changes of the woods natural color, indicative of the photodegradation process, was monitored by spectrocolorimetry. Both species underwent changes in color caused by photodegradation, since the irradiation caused darkening which was quantified by the intensity of reflected light. Tauari demonstrated greater resistance to UV radiation and jatobÃ¡ showed greater tendency to redden up.

Among the native vegetables is the jatobÃ¡-do-cerrado (Hymenaea stigonocarpa Mart., a legume with great potential for exploration for its content of dietary fiber. Legumes are an important source of nutrient compounds, such as phenolic compounds and vitamins that have antioxidant properties. This study aimed at determining the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of the jatobÃ¡ flour. The jatobÃ¡ flour showed high fiber content (insoluble and soluble fiber 47.8 and 12.8 g.100 g- 1, respectively, significant amounts of carotenoids such as beta-carotene and lutein, and some minerals such as calcium: 145 mg.100 g- 1, magnesium: 125 mg.100 g- 1, and potassium: 1352 mg.100 g- 1. The jatobÃ¡ flour extracted with different solvents (water, methanol, and acetone exhibited antioxidant activity by the DPPH, FRAP, and ORAC methods. The solvent used in the extraction affected the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Acetone extraction produced the best results. Therefore, the jatobÃ¡ flour is an ingredient that can be used to develop new products with properties that promote health.\n\nPhytochemical and Antibacterial Investigations of the Extracts and Fractions from the Stem Bark of Hymenaea stigonocarpa Mart. ex Hayne and Effect on Ultrastructure of Staphylococcus aureus Induced by Hydroalcoholic Extract\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGustavo Santiago Dimech\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of different extracts and fractions obtained from Hymenaea stigonocarpa stem barks. The cyclohexanic, ethyl acetate, ethanol, aqueous, and hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained by maceration. The hydroalcoholic extract was partitioned, which resulted in the ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions. All extracts and fractions were subjected to phytochemical screening and evaluation of total phenol and tannin contents. An HPLC-DAD and ultrastructural alterations analysis were performed. Terpenes and coumarins were detected in the cyclohexanic extract. Flavonoids and condensed tannins were present in the other extracts and fractions. The extracts with the highest contents of tannins, ethanol (EE, hydroalcoholic (HE, and aqueous fraction (AF showed also the highest antimicrobial activity. The MIC values ranged from 64 to 526âÂµg/mL. The chromatographic fingerprints suggest the presence of astilbin and other flavonoids in EE and HE. Presence of the thick cell wall, undulating outer layer, abnormal septa, and leakage of the cytoplasmic contents and absence of cell wall and cell lyses were the main alterations observed on Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 33591 after treatment with the Hymenaea stigonocarpa hydroalcoholic extract. The presence of phenolic compounds like flavonoids and tannins is possibly the reason for the antimicrobial activity.\n\nA xyloglucan from seeds of the native Brazilian species Hymenaea courbaril for micropropagation of Marubakaido and Jonagored apples.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLima-Nishimura, N; Quoirin, M; Naddaf, Y G; Wilhelm, H M; Ribas, L L F; Sierakowski, M-R\n\n2003-01-01\n\nXyloglucan was extracted from seeds of Hymenaea courbaril and mixed with agar to prepare a solid culture medium used for micropropagation of the Marubakaido apple rootstock (Malus prunifolia Borkh) and cv. Jonagored (Malus domestica). The performance on gels created from a blend of 0.4%agar and 0.2% xyloglucan (w/v) was compared with that on media gelled with a standard concentration 0.6% (w/v) of agar. The growth of shoots and the multiplication rate were higher on the modified culture medium than on the agar-gelled medium. The occurrence of hyperhydric shoots was lower on the modified medium. In the absence of auxin, shoot rooting reached 70% (Marubakaido) and 66% (Jonagored) on the agar-xyloglucan medium and 6.7% and 10.4%, respectively, on the agar medium. When 0.25 microM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) was added to both media, the modified medium gave better results in terms of rooting percentage and quality of roots than the agar-gelled medium.\n\nShort Communication Mendelian inheritance, linkage, and genotypic disequilibrium in microsatellite loci of Hymenaea stigonocarpa Mart. ex Hayne (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMoraes, M A; Kubota, T Y K; Silva, E C B; Silva, A M; Cambuim, J; Moraes, M L T; Furlani Junior, E; Sebbenn, A M\n\n2016-07-29\n\nHymenaea stigonocarpa is a deciduous and monoecious Neotropical tree species pollinated by bats. Due to overexploitation and habitat destruction, the population size has drastically diminished in nature. No previous study has investigated Mendelian inheritance, linkage, and genotypic disequilibrium in the available microsatellite markers in this species. So, our aim was to estimate these parameters using six microsatellite loci in a sample of 470 adults and 219 juveniles from two populations of H. stigonocarpa. In addition, 30 seeds per tree from 35 seed-trees were collected. Each seed was kept record of the seed-trees and fruit origin. Based on the six microsatellite loci, we found that only 10.6% of the cases showed significant deviations from Mendelian segregation and 15.3% showed linkage. We detected no evidence of genotypic disequilibrium between the loci in the adult trees or juveniles. Thus, our results suggest that these loci can be used with great accuracy in future genetic analyses of H. stigonocarpa populations.\n\nEstrutura espacial e deposiÃ§Ã£o de sementes de Hymenaea courbaril L. em um fragmento florestal no sudoeste goiano - doi: 10.4025/actascibiolsci.v33i1.5881 Spatial structure and seed deposition of Hymenaea courbaril L. in a forestal fragment in the southeast of the GoiÃ¡s State - doi: 10.4025/actascibiolsci.v33i1.5881\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWilson Pereira Bernasol\n\n2011-02-01\n\nFull Text Available O objetivo do presente trabalho Ã© identificar e descrever o padrÃ£o de distribuiÃ§Ã£o espacial de Hymenaea courbaril L.

Outliers generally have a seriously negative effect on DEM construction. Some interpolation methods like ordinary kriging (OK are capable of smoothing noise inherent in sample points, but are sensitive to outliers. In this paper, a robust algorithm of multiquadric method (MQ based on an Improved Huber loss function (MQ-IH has been developed to decrease the impact of outliers on DEM construction. Theoretically, the improved Huber loss function is null for outliers, quadratic for small errors, and linear for others. Simulated data sets drawn from a mathematical surface with different error distributions were employed to analyze the robustness of MQ-IH. Results indicate that MQ-IH obtains a good balance between efficiency and robustness. Namely, the performance of MQ-IH is comparative to those of the classical MQ and MQ based on the Classical Huber loss function (MQ-CH when sample points follow a normal distribution, and the former outperforms the latter two when sample points are subject to outliers. For example, for the Cauchy error distribution with the location parameter of 0 and scale parameter of 1, the root mean square errors (RMSEs of MQ-CH and the classical MQ are 0.3916 and 1.4591, respectively, whereas that of MQ-IH is 0.3698. The performance of MQ-IH is further evaluated by qualitative and quantitative analysis through a real-world example of DEM construction with the stereo-images-derived elevation points. Results demonstrate that compared with the classical interpolation methods, including natural neighbor (NN, OK and ANUDEM (a program that calculates regular grid digital elevation models (DEMs with sensible shape and drainage structure from arbitrarily large topographic data sets, and two versions of MQ, including the\n\nAnatomia dos Ã³rgÃ£os vegetativos de Hymenaea martiana Hayne (Caesalpinioideae-Fabaceae: espÃ©cie de uso medicinal em CaetitÃ©-BA Anatomy of vegetative organs of Hymenaea martiana Hayne (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae: a species of medicinal use in CaetitÃ©-Bahia State, Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nM.S.

Many field studies assess adaptation to water stress by comparing between disparate sites, which makes it difficult to distinguish between physiological or morphological changes and long-term genetic adaptation. When planting trees into new environments, the phenotypic adaptations of a species to water stress will be of primary interest. This study examined the response to water availability of Eucalyptus kochii ssp. borealis (C. Gardner) D. Nicolle, commonly integrated with agriculture in south-western Australia for environmental and economic benefits. By choosing a site where the groundwater depth varied but where climate and soil type were the same, we were able to isolate tree response to water supply. Tree growth, leaf area and stand water use were much larger for trees over shallow groundwater than for trees over a deep water table below a silcrete hardpan. However, water use on a leaf area basis was similar in trees over deep and shallow groundwater, as were the minimum leaf water potential observed over different seasons and the turgor loss point. We conclude that homeostasis in leaf water use and water relations was maintained through a combination of stomatal control and adjustment of sapwood-to-leaf area ratios (Huber value). Differences in the Huber value with groundwater depth were associated with different sapwood-specific conductivity and water use on a sapwood area basis. Knowledge of the coordination between water supply, leaf area, sapwood area and leaf transpiration rate for different species will be important when predicting stand water use.\n\nEstudio de diferentes activantes quÃ­micos en la obtenciÃ³n de carbÃ³n activado a partir de la cÃ¡scara de Hymenaea courbaril L. para la remociÃ³n de cadmio (II)\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nPoleo, Nelson; Oliveros, Solaida; Colina, Marinela; RincÃ³n, Nancy; Mesa, Johan; Colina, Gilberto\n\n2010-01-01\n\nEl uso de diferentes agentes quÃ­micos (ZnCl2, H3PO4, H2SO4, HNO3 y HCl) para la activaciÃ³n de la cÃ¡scara del fruto de algarrobo (Hymenaea courbaril L.) permitiÃ³ evaluar y comparar la capacidad adsortiva de los carbones preparados correspondientes.

To promote germination in seeds with coat impermeability the use of sulphuric acid (H2SO4 is recommended. The objective of this study was to identify a better time for the scarification with sulphuric acid for S. amazonicum seeds. The effect of scarification with sulphuric acid for 20, 40 and 60 min on germination and speed germination was studied for seeds that were either sowed immediately after scarification or after a 24-hour period of immersion in water. Seeds were sown on a mix of sand and sawdust (1:1. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications of 50 seeds. The statistical analysis of germination was carried out at six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 days after sowing, in a factorial scheme. For speed germination the means were compared by the Tukey test. There was an interaction between treatments to overcome dormancy and immersion time after scarification in most evaluations. Immersion in water accelerated the beginning of germination. All treatments to overcome dormancy promoted seed germination. However, scarification for 60 min, showed better germination, 92% when immediately sown and 86.5% when sown after 24 hours. Speed germination index was highest for scarified seeds for 60 min followed by immersion in water. Scarification for 60 min was the most efficient treatment to promote germination in S. amazonicum seeds.Impermeabilidade do tegumento da semente Ã Ã¡gua ocorre em muitas espÃ©cies, inclusive em Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke.

This study investigates the phylogeographic structure of H. stigonocarpa, in order to understand the processes that have led to its current spatial genetic pattern. Methods The polymorphism level and spatial distribution of variants of the plastid non-coding region between the genes psbC and trnS were investigated in 175 individuals from 17 populations, covering the greater part of the total distribution of the species. Molecular diversity indices were calculated and intra-specific relationships were inferred by the construction of haplotype networks using the median-joining method. Genetic differentiation among populations and main geographical groups was evaluated using spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA). Key Results Twenty-three different haplotypes were identified. The level of differentiation among the populations analysed was relatively high (FST = 0Â·692). Phylogeographic analyses showed a clear association between the haplotype network and geographic distribution of populations, revealing three main geographical groups: western, central and eastern. SAMOVA corroborated this finding, indicating that most of the variation can be attributed to differences among these three groups (58Â·8 %), with little difference among populations within groups (FSC = 0Â·252). Conclusions The subdivision of the geographic distribution of H. stigonocarpa populations into three genetically differentiated groups can be associated with Quaternary climatic changes. The data suggest that during glacial times H. stigonocarpa populations became extinct in most parts of the southern present-day cerrado area. Milder climatic conditions in the north and eastern portions of the cerrado resulted in maintenance of populations in these regions. Thus it is inferred that the most\n\nEustochomorpha Girault, Neotriadomerus gen. n., and Proarescon gen. n.

The quality of the liquor stored in these barrels depends on wood characteristics such as density, permeability, chemical composition, anatomy, besides the wood heat treatment used to fabricate the barrels. Brazil has a great diversity of forests, mainly in the north, in the Amazon. This region is home to thousands of tree species, but is limited to the use of only a few native species to store liquors. The objective of this study was to determine some of the physical and chemical characteristics for four Amazon wood species.

A.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nHuber-5042 diffractometer with a closed-cycle Displex DE-202 helium cryostat is a unique scientific instrument for carrying out X-ray diffraction experiments when studying the single crystal structure in the temperature range of 20-300 K. To make the service life longer and develop new experimental techniques, the diffractometer control is transferred to a new hardware and software platform. To this end, a modern computer; a new detector reader unit; and new control interfaces for stepper motors, temperature controller, and cryostat vacuum pumping system are used. The system for cooling the X-ray tube, the high-voltage generator, and the helium compressor and pump for maintaining the desired vacuum in the cryostat are replaced. The system for controlling the primary beam shutter is upgraded. A biological shielding is installed. The new program tools, which use the Linux Ubuntu operating system and SPEC constructor, include a set of drivers for control units through the aforementioned interfaces. A program for searching reflections from a sample using fast continuous scanning and a priori information about crystal is written. Thus, the software package for carrying out the complete cycle of precise diffraction experiment (from determining the crystal unit cell to calculating the integral reflection intensities) is upgraded. High quality of the experimental data obtained on this equipment is confirmed in a number of studies in the temperature range from 20 to 300 K.\n\nAVALIAÃÃO DE PROPRIEDADES FÃSICAS E MECÃNICAS DE MADEIRAS DE JATOBÃ (Hymenaea stilbocarpa Hayne COM DIFERENTES TEORES DE UMIDADE E EXTRAÃDAS DE REGIÃES DISTINTAS1\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFrancisco Antonio Rocco Lahr\n\n2016-02-01\n\nFull Text Available RESUMO Este trabalho objetivou investigar a influÃªncia das regiÃµes de extraÃ§Ã£o (MunicÃ­pios de CaracaraÃ­ e Bonfim, Sul de Roraima; MunicÃ­pio de Alta Floresta, Norte de Mato Grosso da madeira da espÃ©cie jatobÃ¡ (Hymenaea stilbocarpa.

(2016)'s recent study on children solving the Tower of Hanoi (ToH) problem on a touchscreen app offers a clear counter example. Huber et al. (2016) reported that children transferred learning from media to the physical world. As this finding arguably differs from that of prior research in this area, the current study tests whether the Huber et al. (2016) results could be replicated. Additionally, we extended the scope of the Huber et al. (2016) work by testing a broader age range, including children as young as 3 years, and using a culturally distinct participant pool. The results of the current study verified Huber et al.'s (2016) conclusion that 4- to 6-year-old children are capable of transferring the ToH learning from touchscreen devices to the physical version of the puzzle. Children under 4 years of age, in contrast, showed little ability to improve at the ToH problem regardless of the practice modality-suggesting that a different problem-solving task is required to probe very young children's ability to learn from touchscreen apps.\n\nOutlier detection algorithms for least squares time series regression\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nJohansen, SÃ¸ren; Nielsen, Bent\n\nWe review recent asymptotic results on some robust methods for multiple regression.

The mechanical part of the diffractometer consists of a monochromator part which allows an easy change of incident neutron wavelenght and a four-circle HUBER goniostate consisting of an Euler cradle (HUBER 512) and two horizontal goniometers (HUBER 440 and HUBER 430). The goniostate is computer controlled by a PDP-11/34 interfaced via CAMAC modules. The PDP-11/34 computer has a 128 k byte memory, two hard magnetic disc stations, a fast DEC-writer terminal and a screen terminal. The diffractometer can be operated remotely via modem and telephone line connections from remote stations such as the University of Aarhus and ILL, Grenoble. Minor parts of the software used to control the diffractometer were developed at Risoe while the major parts were a generous gift to Risoe from College 5, the diffraction group, at the Institute Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France.

The native species Acacia farnesiana, Acacia schaffneri, Bumelia celastrina, Cercidium macrun, Condalia hookeri, Ebenopsis ebano, Helietta parvifolia, and Prosopis laevigata and the exotic species Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Leucaena leucocephala were chosen due to their ecological and economic importance to the rural villages of northeastern Mexico. Measurements of different growth parameters and volume of trees were evaluated. The introduced species E. camaldulensis and L. leucocephala showed the best performance in wood volume production per tree and per hectare when compared to the native species. Likewise, among the native species, E. ebano, P. laevigata, C. hookeri, and A. farnesiana tended to show better characteristics in terms of wood volume production in comparison to H. parvifolia, A. schaffneri, C. macrum, and B. celastrina. Results showed a high diversity on the properties studied. The high biomass produced by most of the species considered in this study revealed their great energetic potential when used as wood and firewood or vegetal charcoal.\n\nGeographical origin and sexual-system evolution of the androdioecious plant Gynochthodes boninensis (Rubiaceae), endemic to the Bonin Islands, Japan.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOguri, Emiko; Sugawara, Takashi; Peng, Ching-I; Yang, T Y Aleck; Murakami, Noriaki\n\n2013-09-01\n\nGynochthodes boninensis is a woody climber endemic to the Bonin Islands, Japan. It is characterized by an androdioecious sexual system, which is rare in angiosperms. We conducted a molecular phylogenetic analysis of 29 taxa including 61 samples from the tribe Morindeae to elucidate the geographical origin of G. boninensis by determining its progenitor species. We also investigated evolutionary transitions among different sexual systems within this plant group. The combined ETS, ITS, and trnT-F sequence data showed that G. boninensis formed a monophyletic group, but it did not form a clade with G. umbellata, which was treated as the same species, whereas it formed a clade with G. parvifolia, which is distributed in southeastern Asia. This suggests that G. boninensis evolved independently from G. umbellata, and probably originated from a progenitor native to southeastern Asia. In the clade composed of the three species of G. boninensis, G. parvifolia, and G. umbellata, only G. boninensis is androdioecious, whereas the others are dioecious. Thus, the androdioecious sexual system of G. boninensis may have evolved from dioecy. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.
