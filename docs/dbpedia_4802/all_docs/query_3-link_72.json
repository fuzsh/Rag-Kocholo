        "text": "Among the various devices that conform a given writer's style (i.e. syntactic, semantic, and so on), we will ll analyse in this paper two of them, allusion and euphemism. And so, in order to illustrate how, by means of these stylistic devices, A. Machado gets cognitive effects and criticizes two given philosophical systems in two extremely short poems. Euphemisms and allusions do perform meanings in cognitive domains not merely aesthetic or rhetorical ones. And this function is related to previous knowledge and presuppositions of the speakers. For that reason several levels of readings are possible according to the different levels of presuppositions made by speakers.\n\nBaseball is the national sport in Cuba, not because of American imperialism or colonialism, but because criollos, nineteenth-century island elites, made deliberate efforts to equate the game with a nascent Cuban nationalism. The game represented one of a set of civilized practices that criollos used to distinguish themselves from the Spanish. As a distinctive practice, baseball provided a symbolic discourse for an independent Cuba, evident not only in its physical expression on the field but in other forms of expression as well. One particularly prominent form of expression that linked baseball to Cuban nationalism was poetry. As members of elite social clubs, the playing of the game and recital of poetry were two forms of expressive performance that expressed the desires, values and beliefs of Havana’s social elite. This essay examines the relationship between the emergence of Cuban identity, the nascent nation and its expression in the playing of a game by examining a late-nineteenth-century poem that makes these passionate linkages.\n\nTeaching English as a foreign language in the United States presents several new problems for the language learner. They encounter different social levels of language use, different dialects, and confusing English idioms. They encounter the heavy use of sports metaphors. This becomes a problem when they are not familiar with the sport referred to. In particular, the use of sports metaphors in American English presents a challenge to the language learner. This essay deals with the teaching of baseball metaphors for learners of American English.\n\nThis paper is an attempt to describe both the structure and function of punning wordplay (perhaps a more accurate term would be phraseplay) in English using a number of notions commonly employed in modern lexis-driven descriptions of the language, deriving from the theoretical work, principally, of Sinclair and Hoey. Sinclair demonstrates how the organisation of language at the phrase level relies on two basic underlying principles, the open-choice (or terminological) and the idiom (or phraseological) principles. Hearers/readers have certain predictions or expectations about how speakers/writers employ these principles. The contention put forward in this paper is that it is these organisational expectations which wordplay upsets and exploits. This is undertaken in two principal ways, by relexicalisation and reworking. Hoey's work on lexical priming, instead, provides a lexical–grammatical framework which sheds light on precisely what the linguistic expectations of hearers are and how they come about in the first place. I analyse a considerable number of naturally occurring instances of wordplay collected from a corpus of newspaper texts to examine how these theoretical frameworks apply in practice. In the meantime, having defined punning as the bisociative play between two sound sequences, we consider, again from the perspective of modern linguistics, the vexed question of wordplay motivation, that is, the relationship between the different meanings of the two sound sequences which will affect its quality, its success or failure.
