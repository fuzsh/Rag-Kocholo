        "text": "After a busy last 48 hours of the transfer window and the arrival of no fewer than three new players in that span (Mamadou Traor√©, Daijiro Chirino, and Julio Gracia), Castell√≥n gets back to business on the pitch against recently promoted Melilla on the African continent. Yesterday, the Albinegres also saw the exit of club veteran Carles Salvador, who moves to Atl√©tico Saguntino on loan. With the transfer window a thing of the past, the squad seems largely set and ready to get into the rhythm of the season.\n\nThe squad is at almost full strength, albeit with some notable absences. Ra√∫l S√°nchez misses out after receiving a heavy blow to the head in last week‚Äôs opener against M√°laga, while new signing Mamadou Traor√© is also unavailable due to paperwork issues. De Leon is still recovering from the injury that also kept him out last week‚Äôs game. However, Daijiro Chirino should be in the squad, and De Miguel should be ready to start in Ra√∫l S√°nchez‚Äôs absence. DeMi was the difference-maker last week, coming on to score the winning goal against M√°laga.\n\nMelilla drew their opening game 2-2 against Real Madrid Castilla in what was a lively encounter. They did not shy away from the challenge, although they looked uncertain dealing with set pieces, which is something Castell√≥n could look to exploit. Castilla even thought they had won it, but their header from the corner was ruled out.\n\nIn the pre-match press conference, Castell√≥n manager Dick Schreuder said he didn‚Äôt expect Melilla to play defensively at home, having watched their opener in Madrid.\n\nDespite the relatively long journey for the Albinegres to Melilla, fans are optimistic after last week‚Äôs success against M√°laga, and a win is most certainly the expectation."
