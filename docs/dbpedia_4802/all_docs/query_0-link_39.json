        "text": "La Traca was a weekly magazine published in Valencia between 1884 and 1892 and between 1909 and 1938, with periods during which it was not published because of governmental censorship. Because it was written in Valencian, the vernacular language of where it was published, it did not go beyond being a magazine of local, or at most regional, interest, circulation and importance. However, its editor, Vicente Miguel Carceller, made the decision in 1931 to edit the magazine in Spanish and he thus conquered the country's market, resulting in circulation figures that no other publication had ever reached. La Traca was the most loved and hated of all satirical publications. This article explores its characteristics and its ideology, it investigates how it resolved its conflicts and the terrible ending destiny afforded it. We work on the hypothesis that laughter helps dissolve cultural hegemony, since it balances on the edge between what is real and imagined; what is possible and dreamed.\n\nThe creation and interpretation of humour crucially depends on both emotional and cognitive factors, involving arousal-relief mechanisms, hostility, and incongruity-resolution processes (Freud 1905; Gruner 1978; Suls 1972). Linguistic theories have centered on the bisociation produced by two frames of reference, or the abrupt shift in scripts, triggered by ambiguity or contradiction (Raskin 1985; Attardo 1994). The present paper examines humour from the perspective of &#39;blending&#39; (Turner & Fauconnier 1995; Fauconnier & Turner 2002). The creation and interpretation of humour involves the construction of a blend which results in an incongruity or cognitive clash (Fauconnier 1997). We explore humour in political cartooning in Spain during the 1970s. The use of humour may be seen as a form of challenge of existing ideological and political structures (Mumby & Clair 1998).\n\n[Abstract] The aim of this paper is to compare the appreciation of humor that a sample of citizens in Spain has expressed about two different types of ethnic humor produced by two successful television programs from two autonomous communities in Spain: the Basque Country and Catalonia. Both regions are well-known in the Spanish society for their specific cultural and political features, which are seen as different from the rest of the country. To some extent, their particular character is fixed in the Spanish collective imaginary by some particular stereotypes, represented in stupidity and canniness jokes, following the model investigated by Christie Davies. In contrast to these jokes, the present study focuses on the ethnic humor circulated in these two regions, a kind of humor that is based on their specific identity and where it is possible to combine elements of self-deprecating humor and elements of aggressive humor towards Spain. More specifically, this work tries to test if the political background that these two regions represent in Spain-societies that dares the cohesion of the Spanish identity, even fighting for nationalist recognitions of political rights-could influence or not in the appreciation that the Spanish citizens as a whole have of this ethnic humor that Basques and Catalans produce. [Resumen] El objetivo del presente trabajo es comparar la apreciación que una muestra de ciudadanos de España ha dado respecto de dos tipos de humor étnico que se realiza en dos programas de éxito de las televisiones regionales de dos comunidades autónomas periféricas en España: País Vasco y Cataluña. Ambas comunidades son conocidas en la sociedad española por tener una serie de rasgos culturales y políticos propios que las diferencian del conjunto de España, y de alguna manera su posición particular en el imaginario colectivo español está fijada mediante estereotipos que se concretan en chistes estúpidos y astutos, siguiendo la clasificación propuesta por Christie Davies. El objeto de comparación de este trabajo es el específico estilo de humor étnico que se realiza de estas dos comunidades, humor que reflexiona sobre su identidad, mezclando elementos de humor autodespreciativo con elementos de humor agresivo hacia España. En concreto, se trataría de testar hasta qué punto las razones políticas de estas dos comunidades (sociedades que desafían la unidad identitaria española, incluso planteando reivindicaciones políticas de carácter nacionalista) puede influir o no en la apreciación de este tipo de humor en el conjunto de España.\n\nArticle published in: Irony and Humor: From pragmatics to discourse. Edited by L. Ruiz Gurillo and M. B. Alvarado. [Pragmatics & Beyond New Series 231] 2013. pp. 141–158 This chapter has as its main aim to reflect on humorous communication taking as a reference the graphic jokes (or cartoons) which appear in the press. Our reflection will start with an attempt to define what graphic jokes are as a particular genre within the so-called ‘humorous genres.’ This definition has a twofold objective: the first one is to delimit the study object for this paper; the second one, to check the way in which the characteristics of this genre or its components may influence our description of humorous communication. In this respect, the description of humor (and that of other related phenomena: irony, sarcasm and lie) in cartoons will incorporate a specific component, the one deriving from what is inherent to cartoons; and another general one which is common to any humorous communicative situation. There will obviously be communicating vessels between both. Secondly, we plan to describe the framework from which pragmatic analysis is going to be carried out. It is worth highlighting beforehand that our research will assume ideas and proposals of Grice (1975), Levinson (2000), Raskin (1985) and Attardo (1994, 1997, 2001, 2006), or Schank and Abelson (1977). The last section focuses on explaining how this all materializes in the specific analysis of cartoons. 300 graphic jokes which appeared in the Spanish press between 2007 and 2012 served as the starting point for our work. Some of these cartoons will help illustrate the phenomena analyzed here.\n\nThis article explores the use of photography and visual motifs as forms of political humour in contemporary media. By studying the representation of former Prime Minister of Spain Mariano Rajoy in the front pages of three Spanish newspapers (El Mundo, El País and La Vanguardia) between 2011 and 2017, the paper identifies and questions the liaisons between power and satire present in the so-called \"serious\" press, focusing on how different photographic traits concerning layout, composition and gestures reflect ideological choices. This photographic satire developed by printed media is then framed within a figurative tradition that goes back to Spanish royal portraiture, from Velázquez to Goya, which employs common strategies for the visual depiction of power, including satirical and humorous attributes to push specific political agendas. This examination, based on the quantified study and the visual analysis of more than 7,500 front pages, is part of the national research project MOVEP Visual Motifs in the Public Sphere: Production and Circulation of Images of Power in Spain, 2011-2017. In order to determine a useful procedural approach to satirical expressions in photographs, defining which front pages invoke a remarkable satirical content, this article also presents a comparative study and a categorisation based on formal (im)balances related to the concepts of visual motif and humour.\n\nThis paper presents a study of graphic humor in the Peronist magazine El Caudillo de la Tercera Posición. This magazine was published between 1973 and 1975 as a weekly political news publication and it became a flagship vehicle of the right‐wing Peronism. It fought and denounced the 'infiltration' of the left‐wing. Since the early issues it included a continuous humor section with caricatures and comic strips. By analyzing the humor section, it is possible to grasp the political culture of the Peronist right‐ wing and the stereotypes that it has built about its enemies."
