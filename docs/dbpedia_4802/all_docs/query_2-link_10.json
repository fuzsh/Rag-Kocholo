The restriction applies to vehicles over 7.5t on the road between Ramnicu-Valcea – Vestem on the following days:\n\nFriday – between 14h00 – 22h00 the following days: 17.07., 24.07., 31.07., 07.08., 14.08., 21.08., 28.08, 04.09., 11.09., 18.09, 25.09.\n\nSaturday – between 06h00 – 22h00 the following days: 18.07., 25.07, 01.08, 08.08, 15.08., 22.08., 29.08., 05.09, 12.09., 19.09., 26.09\n\nSunday – between 06h00 – 22h00 the following days: 19.07., 26.07, 02.08., 09.08., 16.08., 23.08., 30.08., 06.09, 13.09., 20.09., 27.09\n\nExceptions: transport of passengers, perishable and dangerous goods, first aid equipment and medicines in the event of a natural disaster, mail; vehicles with loading/unloading points on the restricted road sector.\n\nAlternative routes:\n\n– For vehicles with an authorised total weight of more than 7.5t, but less than 30.0t:\n\nRm.Vâlcea – DN 67 Tg-Jiu – DN 66 Bumbești Jiu – Petroșani – Deva\n\nFiliași – DN 66 Tg-Jiu – Bumbești Jiu – Petroșani – Deva\n\n– For vehicles with an authorised total weight of more than 7.5t, but less than 40.0t:\n\nPitești – București – A3 Ploiești – DN 1A – Brașov DN1 – Veștem – Sibiu\n\nCraiova – DN 6 Dr.Tr.-Severin – Caransebeș – DN 68 Hațeg – Deva\n\nThe alternative routes can be followed in both directions.\n\nInternational ports\n\nAll ships arriving from risk areas will be subjected to thorough checks inclusive of physical examination of crew, checking of ship’s medical logs as well as crew lists to verify travel history.\n\nIf no suspect cases, the ship will proceed to berth with crew members being forbidden to go ashore till expiry of the 14 days incubation period.\n\nRomanian authorities would bind any vessel calling Black Sea and Danube River ports to a 14 day quarantine period at roads prior to be allowed in port. While indeed legal text states that 14 days begin running as from vessel’s sailing out of the last port situated in a red or yellow risk zone, in practice Interservices SA has encountered situations where 14 days began running as from vessel’s call at Romanian ports. Exercise caution on how authorities would view running of 14 days.\n\nInternational rail traffic\n\nSuspension of direct rail transport services with border countries (18.03.2020)\n\nAll international passenger traffic is suspended as a result of measures taken by neighbouring states – Bulgaria, Hungary, Ukraine, Moldova, and Serbia.\n\nDocuments\n\nUpon entry to Romania they must present an employee certificate signed by the employer.

See below information for truck drivers coming from red zones.\n\n1) If a driver comes to Belgium as part of a professional journey (transporting goods):\n\na. If he/she stays in Belgium for less than 48 hours, the Passenger Locator Form does not need to be completed.\n\nb. If he/she stays in Belgium for more than 48 hours, the Passenger Locator Form must be completed.\n\nIn both cases, drivers are exempted from compulsory quarantine and testing, even if they come from a red zone. The text messages they receive on arrival to Belgium after filling in the Passenger Locator Form may be ignored.\n\nTherefore, if a driver transits through Belgium (which will almost always be less than 48 hours), he/she can pass freely, regardless of where he/she is coming from.\n\n2) If a driver comes to Belgium after spending his/her free time abroad (e.g. a driver goes to Romania for a week to visit his/her family and comes back to work in Belgium), then the quarantine measures apply.\n\na.

UK authorities also confirmed that annex 3 is acceptable proof.\n\nEven though they are exempt from quarantine, drivers will have to fill in an online locator form with their contact details and details of their journey. A recent update now allows drivers to complete the form for multiple journeys to the UK over a 48 hour period. UK authorities have confirmed that they are currently working to further improve the process for hauliers and freight workers, particularly for those travelling to and from the UK multiple times during a one-week period.\n\nNon-UK resident freight drivers who have travelled from or through Denmark in the last 14 days can no longer enter UK. UK residents who arrive in England after 4am 6 November after travelling from or through Denmark in the last 14 days – including HGV drivers – must self-isolate along with their household.\n\nThe ban is effective and there are no special conditions for road transport. Road transport from DK to UK via France can therefore be performed like this:\n\nDriver takes trailer from DK to DE. Another driver then takes the trailer from DE to UK (provided this driver has not been in Denmark the last 14 days and is not Danish resident).\n\nFor more information, please see here.\n\n09.11.2020\n\nPassengers\n\nOn 6 July, the UK Home Office published the list of travel corridors from which people arriving into the UK will not have to isolate for 14 days upon arrival, unless they have visited or stopped in any other country or territory in the preceding 14 days. Those arriving in the UK whose journey started from a country that is not on the list will still have to follow the isolation requirements. It is expected that the list will grow as time goes on. Rules on travel corridors will apply from 10 July onwards.\n\nInternational road transport\n\nDate: From 15th June\n\nPersons (tourists) permanently residing in Germany, Norway and Iceland will also be allowed entry if they can prove that they will stay a minimum of 6 nights in Denmark (outside Copenhagen).

Together with Frøslev/E45 and Sæd (both open 24 hours a day), the three can be used by trucks over 3.5 tonnes to cross the border. Members are advised that controls will be increased.\n\nThe “blue border” (ferry routes) can still be used and controls will be still carried out. The same applies for the Øresundsbridge between Denmark and Sweden.\n\nMembers are reminded that goods drivers are allowed to enter the country unless they show symptoms of Covid-19 virus.\n\nNon-national employers, posted workers and self-employed service providers will now be offered COVID-19 tests at the Danish border. Individuals are advised to take a test if they have travelled from a high-risk area (not mandatory). More information can be found here.\n\nDocuments\n\nConcerning ADR certificates for drivers, Denmark has signed the M324 multilateral agreement: driver training certificates expiring between 1 March and 1 November 2020 will remain valid until 30 November 2020.\n\nIn addition, despite section 6a (2), 1 of the Freight Forwarding Act, the exchange of drivers between companies with a Danish operating license for international freight transport is allowed, pursuant to section 1 (1) 1 of the Freight Transport Act. This applies until 28 April 2020.\n\nSTA-licenses (drivers of pilot cars for exceptional transport) that expire between 1 March and 30 April 2020 will have their validity extended until 31 August 2020. This will only apply to transport within the Danish borders.\n\nDrivers who carry out international road transport and have an expired driver’s certificate are advised by the Danish Road Authority to bring the certificate for international transport workers (Annex III from the Green Lane Guidelines).\n\nNational public transport\n\nFrom 22 August the use of face masks will be mandatory on public transport in Demark, including on ferries. A disposable face mask, good cloth face covering or face visor can be used.\n\nThe use of face masks is already mandatory in some Danish municipalities owing to higher infection rates.\n\nPassengers\n\nNon-national employers, posted workers and self-employed service providers will now be offered COVID-19 tests at the Danish border. Individuals are advised to take a test if they have travelled from a high-risk area (not mandatory). More information can be found here.\n\nInternational air traffic\n\nPassengers arriving from non-EU countries are not allowed to enter the country with the exception of residents and nationals of the EU, diplomats, and other international representatives.\n\nDocuments\n\nDate: From 22 May\n\nAnyone permitted to enter the territory of Bulgaria without quarantine (ie. truck drivers entering and transiting Bulgaria) will be required to present a new declaration to the border health control authorities.

The same measures apply.\n\nInternational goods transport drivers entering Bulgaria are reminded that they should still complete and sign a declaration, which is now available in Bulgarian and Romanian, English, Turkish and Czech.\n\nThe use of face masks is only mandatory on public transport, in pharmacies and medical institutions, and strongly recommended when physical distancing cannot be guaranteed.\n\nPassengers\n\nThe entry into the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria is prohibited to all third country (non-EU) nationals through all border crossing points by all means of transport.
