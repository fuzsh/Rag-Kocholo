I can assure them it is much more serious than that. —Bill Shankly\n\nFútbol, or soccer as it is called in the United States, is the most popular sport in the world. Millions schedule their lives and build identities around a relatively simple struggle between two teams for the control of a ball. The mechanics of the game have changed little over the past hundred years. Its audience, on the other hand, has expanded enormously. Market forces, globalization, and communications technology have fueled football’s transformation into a mass spectacle. Twentieth-century thinkers grappled with the significance of the popularity of sports. Many asked, “What do sports distract us from?” George Bernard Shaw concluded that sports served as an outlet for men’s resentment toward their wives. His contemporary George Orwell went further, arguing that sports were a form of modern warfare; Sigmund Freud suggested that they were a sublimated expression of sexuality; and still others have viewed sports as a detour from class struggle. These writers recognized sports as an important feature of modern society. However, they assumed that sports acted as a diversion from serious matters. This book takes the opposite tack, asking, “What do sports attract participants to?” By approaching football as “what really happens” rather than as a byproduct of something else, this study takes a fresh look at life in twentieth-century Chile. The commodification of football accompanied its growth in popularity and shaped its political significance. This commercialism is on display during the World Cup tournament. Every four years, the Cup encourages audience members to feel a common bond with one another. Spectators are surrounded by athletic prowess, nationalist rhetoric, and advertisements that appeal to supposedly universal values. More than a billion people follow the tournament on television, radio, computers, and mobile telephones as well as in stadiums. It is so uniquely popular that scientists\n\n2\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nand psychologists see the event as an opportunity to study human development.1 Furthermore, a barrage of documentaries, films, television series, and mainstream books have utilized football to comment on globalization. Despite the sport’s global appeal, this book uses a local case study of football and focuses on its less commercial subjects. Citizens and Sportsmen tells the story of amateur football players whose dedication to civic engagement had long-term political significance in Chile. The book traces the history of organizations formed by those who loved the “beautiful game.” It focuses on clubs, iconography, stories, and relationships that surround football rather than on the technical development of the sport. Given the ubiquity of football in much of Latin America, it may surprise readers that few academic histories of the sport exist. Even fewer focus on its relevance to politics in the region. In part, this stems from the assumption that football serves only nationalist and authoritarian interests. One important historian of the region claimed that its “chief significance has been its use by the elite to bolster official ideology and to channel social energy in ways compatible with prevailing social values.”2 Anthropologists and sociologists have been less dismissive, especially in their attention to different forms of spectatorship and consumption.3 While questioning the assumption that popular culture merely reproduces existing inequalities, this study demonstrates the conservative nature of professional football. The process of commercialization reinforced values that underpinned the stark disparities in Chile. Yet a historical approach provides a complex picture of football’s relationship to politics by explaining its context, contingency, and change over time. Citizens and Sportsmen argues that amateur football clubs integrated working-class men into urban politics, connected them to political parties, and served as venues of political critique.4 In the spaces of civic associations, working- and middle-class men debated the dominant paradigms of democracy and citizenship. They claimed that their labor and creativity entitled them to full political participation. Through their activities, they expanded the terms of political discourse. In challenging the limits of formal politics, civic associations energized the very institutions they criticized. Once firmly rooted in popular culture, the narrative of Chilean democracy created a unifying message that shaped a sense of involvement in the political process. Although many of the club directors in this book would not have characterized their work as political, it is the task of the historian to build such a case. As Michel Foucault described historical\n\nIntroduction\n\nanalysis, “People know what they do; they frequently know why they do what they do; but what they don’t know is what what they do does.”5 During much of the twentieth century, Chile’s political system maintained a high degree of stability and democratic representation in comparison to the rest of Latin America, making it possible to examine football and politics over a long period.6 Thus, Citizens and Sportsmen contributes to recent literature on civil society and democracy, an area of study reinvigorated by the transitions from authoritarian regimes in Latin America and Eastern Europe in the 1990s.7 Leading social scientists, including Robert Putnam and Charles Tilly, have argued for the importance of voluntary organizations in creating democratic societies that connect citizens to the state.8 However, many of the studies inspired by the democratic transitions of the early 1990s marginalize the role of popular culture.9 This is a notable absence, given that people frequently form civic associations to share their passion for theater, dance, and sports. In contrast to scholarship in the social sciences, culture and language figure prominently in the work of literary scholars. Yet the process by which cultural forms, icons, and representations influence formal politics remains murky. Much of the work in cultural studies or literary criticism in the Southern Cone (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay) analyzes popular culture during the authoritarian regimes and the transitions to democracy of the 1970s and 1980s. Yet without long-term historical analysis, authoritarianism appears as an anomaly, apart from society. In Citizens and Sportsmen, I approach football as a cultural practice as well as a set of relationships, or a “field.”10 This field served as a meeting point between individuals and institutions as well as between the material and symbolic. I define political participation broadly as the engagement of individuals and groups with the governing of their lives. Citizens and Sportsmen joins a small but expanding group of monographs in Latin American history that examine civic engagement through the study of voluntary associations.11 Their interest derives, at least in part, from contemporary dissatisfaction with the quality of democracy. Transitions to democracy in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil failed to alleviate social inequalities. Further, some argue that new democratic systems provide legitimacy for the neoliberal policies implemented during the dictatorships of the 1970s and 1980s. Finally, while current political systems allow for more participation than was possible under the authoritarian regimes, voter turnout and party membership have declined.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nIn the social sciences and the humanities, scholarship related to civic associations frequently analyzes formal political institutions at the macro level, bracketing local dynamics in the analyses of political change. Through attention to the circulation of ideas about citizenship at the local level, this book highlights the dynamic relationship between local and national politics. In Chile, working-class men and women were incorporated into municipal politics before they played a role at the national level. Although municipalities were strapped for cash and municipal posts did not offer a clear path to national political careers, candidates fiercely campaigned for local office.12 It is safe to assume that prestige and recognition attracted candidates. Furthermore, discourses that stressed an obligation to engage in community service encouraged citizens’ participation in local politics. Over the course of the twentieth century, an ideal of civic engagement became central to amateur sports organizations. For amateur sportsmen, political activity was rooted in the local context, at the neighborhood level. Football clubs took pride in the relationships they fostered with religious organizations, labor unions, and political parties. The capability of football clubs to express the concerns of citizens to authorities depended upon these relationships. The concept of a “public sphere” brought together research concerned with the role of civic associations in the expansion of citizenship and democratic practices. In The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, Jürgen Habermas argued that urban coffeehouses, newspapers, and salons created spaces for discussion that served as cornerstones of modern democracies.13 Historians have sought to identify the conditions that enabled the creation, expansion, and maintenance of the public sphere. Moreover, feminist scholarship has reworked the concept to account for the exclusionary nature of the public sphere.14 For example, women’s marginalization from football clubs was not incidental, but was a central component of their popularity and constitutive of the limits between public and private. The debates over these topics demonstrate that the correlation between democracy and civic associations is not a foregone conclusion. In certain contexts, civic associations have limited political discussions.15 Studies in Latin America have questioned the value of the public sphere for the region’s history. The pioneering works of Hilda Sábato and Carlos Forment illustrate that the model of liberal democracy has not been able to account for the types of democratic practices in Latin America.16 Sábato argued that a public sphere emerged in nineteenth-century Buenos Aires despite the lack of a stable liberal democracy. She traced the emergence of\n\nIntroduction\n\ndemocratic practices, though not through the ballot box, examining the effervescence of clubs, mutual aid societies, and immigrant organizations. Furthermore, she traced the development of skills necessary for democratic practices—for example, petition writing—within these organizations. In the Chilean case, football clubs provided similar opportunities and acted as intermediaries between local governments, state agencies, political parties, and citizens.17 In a similar vein, Forment demonstrated that in the nineteenth century, Latin Americans practiced a form of everyday democracy in guilds, religious associations, and mutual aid societies. Moreover, Forment concluded that in the case of Mexico and Peru, citizens formed democratic organizations apart from and often in opposition to formal political institutions. In Chile, a rich network of civic associations emerged among the traditional elites as well as among artisans and workers.18 Football clubs in Chile developed strong relations with political institutions. Members defined themselves as political subjects even when formally excluded from electoral participation.19 Scholars have noted the particularly strong connection between local politics and center-left political parties. One analysis concluded that “center and left parties were driven by a desire to control the state and its resources in order to realize their distinct ideological objectives. To achieve those objectives, they pursued primarily directive and clientelistic linkages with constituents in the local political arena.”20 Citizens and Sportsmen offers a bottom-up perspective that challenges the unidirectionality of this relationship. Clubs actively pursued relations with local politicians in order to shape policy and resource distribution. As in neighboring Peru and Argentina, direct action and organization, not only voting, were key forms of political expression. Relative to its neighbors, fewer obstacles existed to electoral participation in Chile. Yet the political system still excluded much of the population. Legislation rescinded property requirements for voting in 1874, although the literacy clause remained until the 1920s. Furthermore, corruption, especially the cohecho, or vote buying, was prevalent in the countryside and, to a lesser extent, in cities. Finally, women could not vote in municipal elections until 1935 and in national races until 1949. Although strikes, protests, and actions of voluntary organizations provided forums where marginalized citizens could express their political views, formal political channels also provided important benefits.21 Football clubs did not, however, adopt a unified political ideology. After the emergence of professionalism in the 1930s, divisions arose between professional and amateur clubs over their approaches to politics. The market for football created a strong incentive\n\n5\n\n6\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nfor professionals to adopt politically “neutral” positions. In the 1950s and 1960s, professional football clubs attacked their amateur counterparts for their ties to leftist parties. Amateurs, for their part, criticized the impact of market logic on football. Football clubs played an important role in the secularization of public life. The idealized public sphere is a secular space; however, this was never entirely true in Chile.22 Studies of Latin American associational life have argued that a strong notion of civic Catholicism emerged in the nineteenth century.23 Sports clubs had distant relations with religious organizations, and nearly all of their statutes prohibited religious discussion within clubs. While we cannot assume this prohibition was enforced, evidence shows that clubs rarely focused on the spiritual concerns of their members. Despite the attempts of Catholic leaders to organize leagues, they did not become a major force within football. It is unclear why, but by the 1920s, Church leaders had turned their focus away from football to promote what they termed “healthier sports,” such as basketball. In all probability, the secularism of sports clubs was part of their allure. The separation of sports clubs from religious organizations further segregated women’s and men’s social activities. Women took an active part in church-based groups, while men abandoned these groups beginning in the mid-1800s.24 Citizens and Sportsmen argues that Chileans’ belief in their democratic tradition shaped their popular culture. The notion that Chileans were exceptionally democratic became a cornerstone of their national identity in the first part of the twentieth century. The reality of this democracy sparked debate across disciplines and generations. Nevertheless, popular groups drew upon this belief to bolster their claims to public resources. This discourse reconciled the exclusive nature of the political system with efforts to build an inclusive national identity.25 Explanations of Chile’s democratic character emphasized the cultural traits of the upper and lower classes. Diplomats, scientists, and popular writers created the image of a democratic Chile both within and outside the country. Ángel Floro Costa, a Uruguayan scientist and lawyer, declared in 1899, “Chile is the only republican nation that has preserved itself . . . It is governed by an intelligent, renewable, and progressive aristocracy, similar to the English aristocracy.”26 British diplomat James Bryce compared Chileans to the English also because, in his view, they were both “intensely political.”27 In praising Chilean elections, Bryce observed, “Chile is also the only South American state which takes so enlightened an interest in its electoral machinery as\n\nIntroduction\n\nto have devised and applied a good while ago a system of proportional representation which seems to give satisfaction, and certainly deserves the study of scientific students in other countries.”28 International observers frequently noted the importance of political parties; for example, William Anderson Smith concluded, “The Chileno is nothing if not a politician, but mainly in the sense of being a violent partisan.”29 Although the rhetoric of Chile’s democracy obscured the enduring inequalities within the country, it also encouraged popular organizations to engage with the political system in order to resolve the problems of their communities.\n\napproaches, contributions, and sources The attempt to define politics and culture in a way that retains their analytical value reveals striking differences among academics. The “cultural turn” or “linguistic turn” in the social sciences involved an understanding of culture and language as productive of, rather than caused by, social, political, and economic structures.30 However, many within political science, sociology, and history continued to disagree about the constitutive role of culture. Scholars interested in change and agency often felt uncomfortable with criticism of normative values like liberty and justice and of the coherency of subjects, such as women.31 In conceptualizing this book, I have found Pierre Bourdieu’s approach to politics and culture, which emphasizes practice, useful.32 For Bourdieu, culture is expressive, performative, and productive of social relations. People practice culture when they express their worldviews through any number of actions, including speaking, writing, dancing, praying, and playing football. Clearly, social structures create limits to these expressions; however, literary theorists caution against the view of culture as a mirror of society. A more apt analogy may be to carnival mirrors that distort, change, and rearrange things “as they really are.”33 Bourdieu’s emphasis on practice and relations avoided traditional binary categorizations of culture such as high or low, resistant or dominant, or derivative or productive (of social class). Politics, though inseparable from culture, can be thought of as an overlapping set of practices intended to control power relations. Anthony Giddens, among others in political science, distinguishes between broad and narrow definitions of politics, the first being related to the governmental decisions of a state, and the latter to “any modes of decision-making which are concerned with settling debates or conflicts where opposing\n\n7\n\n8\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\ninterests or values clash.”34 These types of politics frequently intersect in civic associations and popular culture. An inherent problem with defining politics is that the project itself is a political one. As J. Peter Euben explained, writers often lapse into definitions of politics based on who is doing it (often elite men) and where it is being done (in Congress rather than the home).35 In this sense, feminist historiography has shown the inadequacy of a definition of politics that fails to account for the interconnectedness of the public and private, the distribution of power according to gender hierarchies, and the role of gender in the creation of social class and definitions of citizenship.36 Throughout the twentieth century, football clubs in Chile worked to include leisure and recreation in political agendas. In Citizens and Sportsmen, I have been especially interested in drawing out the connections among the daily practices of clubs, ideas about bodily habits, and broader political dispositions. It has revealed a fascinating process whereby club members’ utilization of institutional channels (petitions to agencies, parties, and legislators) politicized football in a way that did not occur in neighboring countries. This politicization of football became part of a struggle between leftists and conservatives, who accused the former of “making politics” everywhere. Conservative parties characterized their efforts to give the Church authority over culture as a moral rather than a political stance. This supposed “apoliticism” became a staple of conservative rhetoric. At times, the book paints an overly political picture of Chilean football clubs, in the sense that many players probably drifted in and out of clubs after playing a few pichangas, or pick-up games, and certainly did not always agree with the politics of the club leadership. The protagonists of this book, therefore, are those members that connected clubs to a broader political agenda. The history of the Chilean democratic tradition has generated controversy in part because of its mobilization in contemporary political debate. Coupled with the praise for neoliberalism, the rhetoric of Chilean “exceptionalism” has undermined the work of feminists and labor unions to address inequalities.37 Taking an opposite position, some have argued that the stability of the Chilean state depended upon the marginalization of women, indigenous groups, and agricultural workers.38 From the perspective of the Mapuche, Chile’s largest indigenous group, for example, the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet could be seen “less as a fundamental rupture of the democratic order than a resumption of a previous status quo.”39 Tomás Moulian, a prominent Chilean sociologist, argued that the integration of political parties representing the working class, the regularity\n\nIntroduction\n\nof elections, and the role of the state as the leader of economic modernization duped Chileans into believing they were democratically governed.40 At times, this view conceptualized politics as a zero-sum game, in which gains for one social group necessarily involve a loss for another. This book is sensitive to the importance of state violence and exclusivity throughout the twentieth century. However, this line of inquiry does not account for the significance of the discourse of democratic exceptionalism in Chilean history. Nor does it explore how people shaped, contested, and accepted this aspect of national identity. By the mid-twentieth century, the notion that Chileans were democratic had become widely accepted. This book traces how the discourse of democracy shaped the everyday interactions and self-presentation of football clubs. The argument, in its simplest form, is that this narrative of democracy engaged everyday people in politics, encouraged political tolerance, and was skillfully used by working-class organizations to make demands on elected officials. Certain interpretations of Antonio Gramsci’s concept of hegemony would characterize this integration as a way of cementing workers’ participation in their own domination.41 However, amateur criticisms of the ruling elite and political activities went beyond the “acceptable dissent” of successful hegemony, which is why the military dictatorships of Carlos Ibáñez in the 1920s and Augusto Pinochet in the 1970s and 1980s targeted these associations. Moreover, amateur football clubs created discourses that championed working-class players, civic commitments, and political militancy. The relationship between club members’ attitudes, capacities, and habits and the civil associations to which they belonged is a central preoccupation of this book. In recent years, historians have taken an interest in the exercise of power on bodies through habitual practices.42 Historians have developed a more nuanced view of gender, seeing it as an ever-changing process that undergirds the power of nation-states, economic relations, and patriarchal violence toward women. As Pierre Bourdieu explained, “The body believes in what it plays at: it weeps if it mimes grief. It does not represent what it performs, it does not memorize the past, it enacts the past, bringing it back to life.”43 For gender and citizenship, football was a key venue for the production of images of male power, the creation of an aesthetic archetype of the masculine body, and the reinforcement of men’s dominance as active political agents. This book outlines contesting versions of masculinity among football clubs and their change over time. It shows that the “crisis in masculinity”\n\n9\n\n10\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nperpetually expounded by politicians, doctors, state agencies, and journalists was not a dominant discourse among working-class men. This “crisis” of masculinity implied that femininity was an unproblematic and biologically stable category.44 In Chile, these crises portrayed middleand upper-class men as being in a vulnerable position despite their firm control of political, economic, and social power throughout the century. These “crises” were also connected with the efforts of corporate managers and the state to promote a disciplined, domesticated masculine ideal that would curb working-class men’s radicalism.45 While a preoccupation with heterosexuality and virility among working-class clubs was important to social relationships, it did not necessarily translate into further exclusion of women.46 Interest in gender history has inspired an impressive series of investigations in Latin American studies that question accepted colonial and national political narratives.47 Although the focus on football means that this study is primarily concerned with male actors, I have included a consideration of women and an analysis of femininity throughout. In this vein, Karin Rosemblatt’s book Gendered Compromises has provided an important template. Rosemblatt’s work showed the centrality of ideas about masculinity in shaping policies and also contributed to the historiography on the emergence of a mestizo identity, putatively a mix of Indian and European ancestry, which was central to the construction of Chilean national identity. The Chilean case has been virtually left out of the regional literature on race and ethnicity in the 1990s.48 Unlike Brazil and Argentina, for example, Chile never embraced the notion of a multiethnic nation. Instead, the model of Chile as a homogeneous mestizo nation with an ever-distant indigenous past became dominant. While perhaps they precluded certain forms of biological determinism, transnational racial ideologies intersected with local beliefs to shape the boundaries of political inclusion. The research for this study is based upon virtually unexamined records, chiefly club documents, neighborhood publications, and sports magazines. The creation of a narrative for this book was a process of interpreting these disparate records. Textual analysis is only a window on what type of information passed between actors in what must have been lively exchanges.49 Petitions from clubs to their representatives, as they appeared in newspapers or congressional records, enabled the investigation to explore the strategies of clubs and the language in which they couched their demands. I also relied upon histories commissioned by football clubs as well as the autobiographies of sportsmen, housed in the National\n\nIntroduction\n\nLibrary, in order to trace changes in clubs and the narratives of football. Clubs’ statutes, bylaws, and annual reports provided information about their structure over time, their practices, and the ways in which members defined the clubs’ purposes. The task of mapping relationships between football clubs and other civic associations, unions, political parties, and state agencies required a review of the records of other organizations. For example, newsletters of immigrant societies were useful in understanding the role of football clubs within immigrant communities and their relationship to volunteer firefighting units, charities, and dance clubs. To trace the ways in which political parties interacted with sports clubs, I examined the records of party congresses, newspapers, and pamphlets. Comic strips, songs, and commemorative books provided materials that helped me analyze the representation of social hierarchies and citizenship in sports literature. In many cases, I have interpreted silences as data. For example, clubs touted their inclusiveness; however, their practices precluded the participation of women. Images and textual representations circulated among footballers in the clubhouse, through media, and at games. As these images circulated, they took on an air of truthfulness and legitimacy. Oral histories provided insight into the significance of clubs for participants, although my efforts to conduct interviews were only marginally successful.50\n\nstructure Citizens and Sportsmen begins by drawing a sociohistorical map of early football clubs, shedding light on their political practices, their relationship to reform movements, and urban leisure in general. The efforts of industrialists and politicians to remake the habits of workers through strict control of time, space, and health reforms fueled the dissemination of football throughout the Southern Cone. Patrons who founded clubs sought opportunities to create class harmony. In Chapter One, I argue that the ways in which football clubs narrated historical events and petitioned government agencies supported the legitimacy of the Chilean state as an increasing presence in cultural life. Upper-class football directors created family allegories within football organizations that approximated the ones used to oppose labor organizations. Working-class players’ bodies became involved in a relationship conceived of as both voluntary and pleasurable to their patrons. Good performance on the field translated into economic benefits, social status, and travel opportunities. Alternative vehicles for\n\n11\n\n12\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nparticipation, such as the Workers’ Football Association, provided leadership opportunities for working-class players, connected them to the nascent leftist press, and challenged their political exclusion. In this way, football organizations shaped class identity in the urban milieu. The second chapter, “The Massive, Modern, and Marginalized in Football of the 1920s,” takes a fresh look at the populist military dictatorship of Carlos Ibáñez through the lens of football clubs. During his dictatorship, new practices of spectatorship in stadiums and clubs challenged the authority of the military government, which had promised to bring order and modernity to the cities. Certain clubs attempted to discredit the claims that the military had intervened to preserve democracy. Moreover, members utilized football clubs as a means to maintain party structure and continue union organization in the midst of increased repression. Throughout the decade, the relationship between football clubs and political parties intensified. With the birth of mass culture, technological and marketing developments meant that popular culture became more profit oriented, widespread, and accessible. Leisure activities defined the urban experience and created narratives that framed the way spectators understood their lives. Finally, new urban spaces, including stadiums, movie houses, dance halls, and restaurants, democratized entertainment. Chapter Three, “ ‘The White Elephant’: The National Stadium, Populism, and the Popular Front, 1933–1942,” analyzes the construction of the National Stadium, a turning point in the relationship between popular culture, civic associations, and politics. In previous studies of this period in Latin American history, popular culture was often portrayed as a handmaiden of populism. This chapter questions that characterization by examining football clubs in the 1930s and their efforts to shape the policies of the Popular Front. I argue that strong party identification and pluralism prevented football from becoming a populist tool. The mobilization of clubs against what they perceived to be President Arturo Alessandri’s attempt to gain their support through the stadium also contributed to the formation of an antipopulist discourse. A critical public, led by amateur clubs, accused state agencies of corruption and wasteful spending during the stadium-building project. Debates over how and for whose benefit the stadium was to be built took place in sports magazines, newspapers, cafés, and clubhouses across the country. Furthermore, the mobilization of amateur clubs in support of the center-left coalition, the Popular Front, challenged the notion of culture as an apolitical sphere. This affiliation reflected a deepening connection between amateur clubs, leftist parties, and unions.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe fourth chapter, “ ‘The Latin Lions and Dogs of Constantinople’: Immigrant Clubs, Ethnicity, and Racial Hierarchies in Football, 1920– 1953,” traces the racial discourses that circulated in the clubs themselves as well as in the popular literature and iconography surrounding football. It argues for the importance of these narratives in defining citizenship. Immigration and transnational flows of racial stereotypes intersected with local identities to shape notions of the body politic. Popular culture acted as one of the most fluid, quickly moving, and broadly disseminated media for the construction of political subjects. The distinct experiences of European and Middle Eastern immigrants in sports clubs shed light on how racial discourses shaped civic associations. Beginning in the 1920s, sports clubs acted as vehicles by which immigrant communities could maintain relations among themselves, promote positive images of their cultures, and gain access to political power. However, as the ideal of the urban mestizo became dominant by the 1950s, Arab Chileans found themselves permanently cast as “foreigners” in a way that excluded them from being considered full citizens in the political realm. Finally, this chapter demonstrates that an assumed racial homogeneity figured importantly in the discourse of democratic exceptionalism. By the 1950s, amateur football clubs were among the largest and most politicized civic associations in Chile, taking an active role in squatter movements, labor disputes, and political campaigns. In the process, they created a magnetic icon of the popular barrio, or neighborhood, football player. This figure became a charismatic symbol of working-class ingenuity and class injustice. The political nature of the Chilean barrio hero distinguished it from similar figures in other parts of Latin America. Chapter Five, “ ‘Because We Have Nothing . . .’: The Radicalization of Amateurs and the World Cup of 1962,” examines neighborhood football clubs’ roles in squatter movements, labor disputes, and political campaigns. I argue that amateur clubs contributed to the radicalization of working-class neighborhoods. Moreover, these clubs created an ideal of masculinity based on physical labor, creativity, class solidarity, and political militancy. Finally, the boom in barrio football clubs became a centerpiece of the Chilean bid to host the World Cup of 1962. Preparations for the event shed light on how the Cold War shaped the divisions between amateur and professional clubs. The political context of the 1960s created new opportunities and challenges for Chilean football clubs. Chapter Six, “The New Left, Popular Unity, and Football, 1963–1973,” examines how the emergence of the New\n\n13\n\n14\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nLeft and the youth culture in the 1960s related to the leftist Popular Unity (Unidad Popular, or UP) government of Salvador Allende (1970–1973). Despite the growth of the professional football industry, amateurs constituted an important base for political mobilization. Football clubs and other civic associations provided resources to working-class neighborhoods despite blockades, hoarding, and threats from paramilitaries. Moreover, they organized public support for Allende’s Popular Unity government. The study of football clubs illustrates the importance of civic associations in shaping and implementing the UP agenda. Enthusiasm for a new socialist culture that rejected materialism emerged among amateur clubs. At the same time, commercialization of the sport reached a new apogee. Despite the professionals’ embraces of technological innovations that made it easier for multinational corporations to reach consumers, they failed to co-opt youthful rebellion and convince audiences to reconcile with authority. The book ends with an epilogue that brings the story up to the present. On September 11, 1973, a group of military officers conducted a coup against Allende. The bombardment of the presidential palace prompted Allende’s suicide and resulted in the death of many of his closest advisors. Following the coup, the military launched a campaign of massive repression. This began an era of terror for leaders of the civic associations that are the subject of this study. Since football clubs constituted important public spaces, the junta sent police to make their presence felt in clubs and playing fields. The military used large stadiums, celebrated by sportsmen as monuments to progress, as places to torture and detain prisoners. The seventeen-year dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet dismantled civic associations, squashed public debate, and destroyed long-standing connections between civil society and the state. Finally, this epilogue argues that along with neoliberal economic reforms and mass consumerism, the lack of civic associations has limited political discourse and contributed to apathy among Chileans. I began the research for this book at the headquarters of the National Association of Amateur Football (Asociación Nacional de Fútbol Amateur, or ANFA), nestled in the bohemian barrio of República in Santiago. In the main social room, a group of older men stood conversing over tea. Young women and men walked in and out of the building. A large photograph of President Allende visiting the El Teniente mines hung over the room. When I arrived in search of records, the vice president of the association shrugged his shoulders and informed me that, sadly, the association had\n\nIntroduction\n\nnone. He explained that in 1973, ANFA had destroyed all membership rosters and meeting minutes.51 Many of the leaders had gone into hiding, ceased their activities, or been detained. While it is beyond the scope of this book to detail the history of football during the military dictatorship, it cannot ignore the events that began on September 11, 1973, including the torture and detention of prisoners in the National Stadium and the Estadio Chile, as well as the stories of young men and women sent from the barrio football fields to prison camps. No doubt, the Pinochet dictatorship, characterized by brutal violence, sought to destroy meaningful political participation. Much of what the protagonists of this book built was demolished, and they found themselves persecuted, often unsure which of their many civic affiliations had landed them in such trouble. Hopefully, this book can be of use to the futbolistas who seek to understand and shape the politics of the sport they love.\n\n15\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nRAYANDO LA CANCHA—marking\n\nChilean Football, 1893–1919\n\nthe field\n\n1 The photograph on the next page, taken in 1893 of the Santiago Club, has been cited as the earliest image of Chilean footballers. These eleven figures, stoically posed, have been reproduced countless times to evoke nostalgia among fans. A few years after the photograph was taken, these players gathered in an elite café in the port city of Valparaíso to form the first national organization of football clubs. Throughout the twentieth century, this event would be wistfully remembered as the inaugural moment of football’s “golden era,” a time when the game was supposedly free from commercial and political interests.1 The men in the photograph would likely have objected to such a harmonious characterization. They believed their generation desperately needed sports to alleviate the stress of class conflict, industrialization, and urbanization. Like many football clubs in the late 1800s, the Santiago Club was founded by British businessmen working in banking and mining. The British origins of football bolstered its reputation among Chileans who embraced “refined” European imports. Its rapid dissemination prompted one enthusiast in 1912 to declare, “The seeds planted by the Ramsays, Campbells, etc. have borne fruit. And our workers have founded sports institutions that have provided moments of solace . . . and moral regeneration.”2 Despite football’s remarkable popularity, scholars have shown little interest in it, leaving much of this early history unexamined. The relationship between popular culture and politics that emerged in this period shaped social struggles for decades. New forms of leisure, like football clubs, contributed to the organizational capacity of workingand middle-class men in the early 1900s.3 The appeal of football brought together men from distinct political and class backgrounds. In this chapter, I argue that through their participation in football clubs, members learned\n\n18\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nfigure 1.1. Santiago Club, c. 1893.

Largely excluded from the formal political system, members expressed their views in the language, iconography, and practices they developed within clubs. Moreover, football clubs helped a steady stream of migrants from mining and rural areas adapt to urban life and facilitated the transformation of regional cultural practices.\n\nthe “social question” and football Concern for how to resolve the “social question” connected football organizers, reform movements, and local politicians. The “social question” encompassed a series of debates about how to quell the demands of labor, control urban populations, and create a stable industrial workforce.4 As in much of Latin America, a small group of families had monopolized political posts and land ownership in Chile beginning in the independence period. Workers’ increased participation in labor unions and mutual aid societies worried traditional elites as well as foreign investors. In the football clubs they sponsored, upper-class patrons positioned themselves as benevolent\n\nChilean Football, 1893–1919\n\npatriarchs in relation to workers. Other employers characterized their company football clubs as horizontal fraternities. Both the paternal and fraternal narratives resembled those used to oppose labor unions. Workers who played for their employers became entangled in a relationship conceived of as voluntary and pleasurable. The desires of upper-class patrons to mold workers’ habits according to their labor needs dovetailed with those of the reform movements in Chile’s largest cities, Santiago and Valparaíso. Reformers blamed workers’ immorality for miserable urban conditions. They targeted alcoholism, gambling, indolence, and poor hygiene as the worst of these vices. Despite the disparaging image of workers put forward by reformers, a significant number of working- and middle-class people supported the movement. They hoped to alleviate common problems in their neighborhoods, including housing shortages and tainted food. Leaders of football clubs advocated the sport as a vehicle for the regeneration of workers. These ideas about working-class reform were not exclusive to Chile, but rather part of a broader, transnational current. Middle-class professionals, including physical-education teachers and “hygienists,” played an important role in reform movements. In the early 1900s, they created new fields for their specialties, replete with conferences, professional journals, and educational credentials. As in Lima, Buenos Aires, and other Latin American cities, reform organizations in Santiago and Valparaíso eagerly sought scientific solutions to social problems.5 British immigrants living in affluent neighborhoods of Valparaíso formed the first football clubs in the 1880s, expressing a profound nostalgia for England’s landscapes and social customs.6 While many clubs emerged from within bank and mining offices, others arose from foreignlanguage schools. Europeans and elite Chileans arranged matches between the English-, German-, and French-speaking schools that their children attended. Chileans who attended these schools distinguished themselves by their European tastes and habits. Participation in football, cricket, and rugby marked the European pedigree of Creoles, who often picked up the sports during their education abroad. In response to the popularity of football and other foreign cultural practices, salesmen imported sports equipment for specialty stores that catered to the urban elite. Several prominent founders of football clubs, such as Juan Ramsay, began businesses that imported such goods. No doubt the social relationships developed in clubs helped the owners of these businesses. The interest in foreign goods continued a long trend in which the\n\n19\n\n20\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nmarket share of local artisans was slowly eroded. Since the early nineteenth century, Europeans had constituted the majority of Santiago’s merchants.7 Their advertisements presented European goods as both superior to local wares and capable of conferring sophistication and elegance. British immigrants brought definite ideas of football’s social value, which had already received attention in England. The sociologist Norbert Elias described the adoption of football there as part of a “civilizing process” in the nineteenth century whereby popular habits reflected new forms of self-control and social life became less violent. Football was part of a series of cultural practices that fulfilled the demands of the emergent centralized state, whose inner circles sought to monopolize violence.8 Similarly, directors of state institutions in France, including schools and prisons, saw football as a way to instill time management in young workers and fill their unoccupied hours.9 The founders of Chile’s first clubs, who were quite aware of these processes, viewed such developments as positive. Despite the club founders’ efforts to attract governmental support for football, the Chilean state made little effort to incorporate or mobilize sports organizations. In the first decade of the twentieth century, the state controlled workers through direct violence and repression rather than cooptation or integration. The preservation of class privilege was important among the elite who founded football clubs. Notwithstanding their rivalries, Chile’s first generation of footballers shared a class status as well as a vision of themselves as civic men. Elite British and Chilean sportsmen cultivated innumerable hobbies and joined scores of social, professional, and political clubs.10 Sporting events provided them with important social forums. This clique of early footballers orchestrated participation in the London Olympics of 1896. The self-financed Chilean athletes were among the representatives from thirteen nations who competed in track and field events. Upon their return, members of this group concentrated their energy on mobilizing support for sports, particularly football, among politicians. They were convinced that class tensions in London had been significantly reduced as a result of frequent sports competitions among elite and popular teams.11 Chileans who founded the first football clubs typically belonged to one of the two dominant political parties, the Conservatives or the Liberals. In their discussions of the social question, both parties focused on workers’ habits. Conservatives rejected explanations that blamed economic inequality or government negligence for urban squalor. Furthermore,\n\nChilean Football, 1893–1919\n\nthey sought to empower the Catholic Church to oversee charity and relief projects in urban areas. Prominent Conservative bishop Rafael Edwards, who founded several football clubs, explained, “Discontent stems from more profound causes [than the price of goods], more serious ones that have their roots in the people’s own habits.”12 Edwards mildly criticized industrialists for their unbridled economic ambition. He suggested their support for sports organizations could help prevent migrants from falling victim to the corrosive influences of the city. As in most reform rhetoric, migrants from the countryside were portrayed as naïve and easily lured into drinking, gambling, and card playing. Liberal Party members placed greater responsibility on the government and on business owners to help workers reform their habits, advocating public education rather than religious instruction as the best means of accomplishing that. Football patrons claimed to be reaching out to workers, but their message of sobriety, time management, and physical discipline more likely spoke to fellow upper- and middle-class professionals. As one club director complained in 1907, “Outdoor sports appear to have widespread acceptance, judging by the publicity given to football matches in the daily press. . . . In reality they have [diffused] little, very little. A large percentage of the adult population does not practice sport of any type. And the rest are content with a football match that lasts a couple of hours each month or mounting a horse once every six months.”13 Commentary such as this highlights reformers’ limited understanding of workers’ lives and their leisure opportunities. Sports publications rarely considered the space, time, and economic constraints that workers faced. They decried physically idle workdays that were descriptive only of professional employment. Furthermore, their concerns with the deterioration of men’s bodies caused by innovations like electric lighting and train travel, which were assumed to disrupt natural rhythms, related more to their own experiences than those of workers. Working-class clubs showed particular disdain for the temperance movement. The Anti-Alcoholism League, which urged football clubs to encourage sobriety among their members, found middle-class sportsmen more receptive to their message than their working-class counterparts.14 Alongside reformers and upper-class patrons, journalists played a crucial role in the dissemination of football. Sports journalists founded football clubs, created channels of communication between clubs, and articulated the relationship between football and class identity. Sports journalists throughout the Americas were in the process of defining their\n\n21\n\n22\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\ntrade. Increased literacy and urbanization expanded the reading public. Enterprising writers raised public interest in football through the creation of rivalries. The earliest sports coverage was an extension of the society page, with long lists of the well-known families and politicians that could be seen at matches. El Diario Ilustrado’s description of the match between Santiago and Valparaíso in 1913 reads more like an account of a garden party. People arrived hours early to drink tea or have lunch with one another. Ladies showed off their latest fashions and arrived in automobiles with distinguished sportsmen. The writer described the beauty of the field in painstaking detail, its radiant green contrasted with the orderly white boundary lines. He claimed there could not have been less than seven thousand or eight thousand people, which “gave the sensation of a combat field in its glory day.”15 There were few opportunities to see so many people gathered in one place, apart from major protests and military parades. The increased attendance at matches, even if exaggerated, helped journalists persuade editors that sports news deserved its own section.16 Sportswriters also encouraged sports clubs to use newspapers as bulletin boards for communicating with one another and to declare particular papers to be their “official” press organs. These declarations reflected the political sympathies of the clubs’ members, or at least of those involved in deciding the clubs’ affiliations.\n\nrace and nationalism in football While the British origins of Chilean football contributed to its rapid dissemination, local dynamics and politics shaped its social significance. Club leaders’ preoccupation with class struggle became intertwined with anxieties over masculinity and la raza chilena, or the Chilean race. Sportsmen defined race in fluid and inconsistent ways, according to their perceptions of language, skin color, geography, and dress. However differently they understood la raza chilena, club founders agreed that it was in serious peril because of urbanization. As one club patron explained, “In modern times, more and more often men tend to live in the great urban centers. Industrialization and other conditions attract them to cities. In these [cities], man degenerates.”17 He blamed airborne germs, noxious fumes, tainted consumer goods, and artificial light as sources of general physical malaise, which he termed “racial degeneration.”18 Football club organizers drew upon fears of degeneration to argue for the urgency of promoting outdoor team sports.\n\nChilean Football, 1893–1919\n\nRivalries between Chile’s largest cities, Valparaíso and Santiago, a mere sixty miles apart, spurred interest in football matches between them. Footballers commonly framed the rivalry between Valparaíso and Santiago as a competition between Anglo-Saxons and mestizos, respectively. Positive views of racial mixing between Native Americans and Europeans were relatively rare in the Andes during the postindependence period.19 Although an affirmative discourse of mestizaje, or racial mixing, had not become dominant, sportsmen from Santiago selectively celebrated their indigenous heritage. They referred to themselves alternately as mestizo, Creole, American, or “half-Indian,” as opposed to players from Valparaíso, whom they described as European or white. According to these football players, the mestizo character of Santiago represented a more “authentic” Chilean-ness. They claimed to derive primal strength from their Indian heritage and decisiveness from the Spanish.20 The emergence of a more positive evaluation of Indians coincided with the conclusion of military campaigns against the Mapuche in southern Chile. Prominent founders of clubs depicted Indians as anachronistic and frequently referred to them as ancient ancestors. Physical-education pioneer and football club director Guillermo Martínez, for example, asked Chileans to be “better friends of our past, to revive many of the ancient indigenous exercises and games.”21 With their Indian heritage relegated safely to the past, Santiago clubs affirmed a mestizo identity as part of what legitimated their city’s claim to represent the nation. Footballers from Valparaíso boasted that their Anglo-Saxon “roots” distinguished them from mestizos as well as from Spaniards. They described their city as the most cosmopolitan in Chile and, at times, Latin America. In the pre–Panama Canal days, Valparaíso was an important international seaport along the route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Chileans treasured the city’s romantic aura, which was created by its chaotic streets, unique architecture, and nightlife. Despite Valparaíso’s lack of physical regularity, sportsmen pointed to the city’s newspapers, banks, and transportation system as evidence of its modernity. Chile did not experience the same influx of European immigrants as did Argentina, Brazil, or the United States in this period, but many public figures emphasized the port’s European character.22 A lawyer for British nitrate interests, Julio Zegers, compared the two cities in the following way: “Wealth in Santiago does not reflect the elegant simplicity of the serious and honest classes in Europe: it is a servile imitation of costumes and ornaments. In Valparaíso . . . the English spirit has prevailed, and the fashion is of a serious, distinguished,\n\n23\n\n24\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nand attractive character.”23 Football clubs in Valparaíso associated their city’s “English spirit” with their superior grasp of the game. For instance, clubs in Valparaíso wrote their rule books, constitutions, and hymns in English, which they claimed better preserved the qualities of football.24 Football clubs engaged in debates over race and national identity in the 1910s. As the national team became a widely recognized symbol, its performances sparked discussions of what constituted chilenidad, or Chileanness. Journalists publicized achievements in international competitions, such as the South American Cup, as benchmarks of Chile’s progress. Sportswriters claimed that compared with their Argentinian or Peruvian counterparts, Chilean sportsmen were homogenous (of mixed Indian and European heritage). They boasted that this homogeneity produced a selfless playing style, and they criticized players whose height or weight deviated from what they deemed “average.” Football club directors claimed that Chilean sportsmen were democratic as well as physically consistent. To establish this, football club directors drew upon historical examples from well-known democracies. For example, Guillermo Martínez stated, “In the matter of physical education, we are the Greeks of South America. Indeed, our Araucanians cultivated physical exercise with love.”25\n\nfigure 1.2.

For example, the Conservative Party promoted foreign immigration as a way to settle “uninhabited” areas of the South, which created conflict with the indigenous populations that lived there. They justified land concessions to European immigrants because of their supposed racial desirability. In opposition to such policies, Nicolás Palacios wrote La Raza Chilena, first published in 1904. A middle-class physician, Palacios set out to prove that the Chilean racial mixture exhibited characteristics superior to those of any of the “pure” European races or other mixes in Latin America. Palacios argued that the Chilean middle class deserved the land titles and job opportunities being given to European immigrants. According to Palacios, the Chilean mestizos descended from a group of German Visigoths who had migrated to Spain centuries before colonization. Palacios claimed that these Visigoths mixed with “Araucanians” to create an ideal combination.26 He used crime statistics and media reports to show that Chilean mestizos were less prone to violence than European immigrants. His ideas became important within the Radical and Liberal party circles as well as in popular discussions of race. In addition, La Raza Chilena influenced physical-education teachers, who drew upon Palacios’s theories when writing their curriculums.27 In response to their concerns for the race, physical-education teachers formed a civic association, which they named the National Society for the Protection and Promotion of the Chilean Race. This association sought to empower sports clubs, physical-education teachers, and temperance societies. Theories that viewed Chile’s mestizaje as a positive development, like those of Nicolás Palacios, were based on a belief in the special nature of the Araucanian Indians. The heroic image of the Araucanians who resisted Spanish colonization surfaced frequently in club songs and iconography. Contemporary indigenous communities, especially the Mapuche of the south-central regions, were depicted as degenerate versions of their valiant ancestors. The positive portrayal of Indians in the distant past contrasted sharply with the image of the provinces as barbaric outposts. Sports journalists worried about the influx of people from the provinces to urban centers, often conflating the categories of workers and Indians. In their descriptions, “the provinces” became a shorthand designation for “violence” and “primitivism.” Describing a brutal fight between a referee and\n\n25\n\n26\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nplayer, one writer asked, “Do you think that the earlier paragraphs refer to a game played in Coquimbo or in the nitrate fields? They are incidents between the first teams of La Cruz and América of Valparaíso.”28 Another observer complained, “With horror and shame, we read telegrams from the provinces that day in and day out [report] on numerous crimes against person and property, in particular in the south of the republic.”29 Aggressive behavior was often perceived as a sign of masculine prowess; however, workers (especially miners and port workers) and Indians were depicted as having trouble controlling their violent behavior. Caricatures of other nationalities served to create a unified image of Chileans within sports literature. Certain nations became emblematic of racial difference, especially those with large populations of African descent, such as Brazil and the United States. African American and Afro-Brazilian athletes were portrayed as grotesquely masculine, with exaggerated features. For example, the Chilean sporting press described boxer Jack Johnson as having a “bestial torso and a mouth glittering with gold,” an excessive masculinity, and an “inexplicable, incredible, and absurd” attraction for women.30 Sports literature attributed the talent of black athletes to the primal instincts they derived from their African heritage. One journalist referred to two separate “tribes” of black sportsmen: those who viewed Johnson’s audacious behavior with shame and those who approved.31 By describing Johnson and other African Americans as savage, Chilean sportsmen placed themselves in the categories of white and civilized. The historian Gail Bederman has argued that the fear of and hostility toward Jack Johnson signaled an important juncture in the process of remaking “manhood” in the early twentieth century. Across the Americas, the belief that men had become “overcivilized” prompted sportsmen to place a greater value on virility than on self-restraint. Thus, for white men to recapture the aggressive instincts they had lost in their adaptation to modern life, they had to adopt some of the primitiveness of the black man.32 Among Chilean sportsmen, the model of manly self-restraint coexisted with one of masculine dominance. Elite sportsmen championed the former more commonly, but neither held exclusive sway. Sports directors across the social spectrum shunned violence on the field as a showing of weakness and mobilized the model of the British gentleman as an icon of masculine self-restraint.33 At the same time, these clubs began excursion programs that encouraged members to reconnect with nature and cultivate the “savage within.”\n\nChilean Football, 1893–1919\n\nAt times, spontaneous events on the football field and respect for talent undermined racial stereotypes. The experiences of footballers who visited the provinces often contradicted the frightening media images of the hinterlands. As football gained a broader fan base and clubs became more organizationally savvy, teams toured outside Santiago regularly. Players sent lengthy updates that were printed in sports magazines and distributed in clubs. Through these reports and interviews, players created their own commentaries on the provinces. Often, players glowingly described the people and places they encountered. For instance, the northern port city of Coquimbo, stereotyped by mainstream media as a rugged frontier made dangerous by Indians, became known for its polite football players. Sports club leaders and journalists put forward wildly different ideas of race. At times, they defined the Chilean race as all people within the national political borders; in other instances, they applied the term exclusively to mestizos; and in other moments, they extended the term race to include humans in the broadest sense. Furthermore, class markers certainly exerted a significant influence on perceptions of race. Despite sportswriters’ claims that only talent mattered, they were determined to properly categorize players according to race. In the case of hurdle champion Juan Galvéz Rivas, writers described his face as “Japanese” and wondered why his friends called him “China man.”34 Although one article stated that Gálvez’s race was of minor importance, a large headshot of his face appeared with a caption that again questioned whether he was Chinese. In another instance, a journalist marveled at the good looks of boxer Benjamin Zárate, “despite” his indigenous heritage. He elaborated that Zárate’s features were “very agreeable,” adding that “he looks more European than Chilean-Araucanian.”35 In Zárate’s case, excellence in sports could “whiten” people’s perception of him. The separation of European and Araucanian from Chilean in the article demonstrated the writer’s assumption that Chileans were mestizo.\n\nworkers’ clubs According to newspaper accounts, football’s popularity among workers grew with surprising speed. In 1905, El Mercurio reported: Football has spread in truly gigantic proportions, primarily among the working class. All workers’ circles and societies count among them one or\n\n27\n\n28\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\ntwo teams that practice regularly. . . . Others, those more knowledgeable of the sport, have founded some clubs that at the same time serve as sports centers, mutual aid societies, and meeting places. In these clubs, an enviable harmony and camaraderie reigns. One of these clubs, “Chile-Argentina,” has 120 active members, all very enthusiastic and good players. As soon as a worker arrives to Santiago looking to join one factory or another, “ChileArgentina” offers him a place among players that arrived before him.36\n\nMutual aid societies were at the vanguard of working- and middle-class sports organizations. At the beginning of the twentieth century, mutual aid societies in urban Chile encompassed a wide range of ideologies, including anarchism and Social Christianity. Mutual aid societies across Latin America advocated the inclusion of working- and middle-class men in politics.37 Their members pooled resources in order to acquire insurance, death benefits, education courses, and recreational resources. While historians have regarded these societies as “an important force in increasing the organizational capacity of Chilean workers,” they have paid scant attention to the cultural activities of these associations.38 This neglect stems in part from skepticism toward the political significance of mutual aid societies. Some historians have argued that mutual aid societies were composed of artisans who wanted to protect their own privileges rather than empower workers. Others have described the societies’ quest for respectability as a disciplinary force that muted workers’ radicalism. In Chile, the pursuit of respectability and the embrace of radicalism often came together, as in the anarchist resistance societies. Football clubs were part of an emerging network of civic associations that shaped the creation of working-class identity in urban neighborhoods. The cultural activities of workers’ organizations, including football, theater, and dance, challenged the claims of working-class depravity that were used to justify the political exclusion of workers. They also created secular spaces where men could discuss issues of common interest, such as job opportunities and local politics. Despite the notable efforts of clergymen like Bishop Edwards, clubs with relationships to parishes were in the minority. More commonly, clubs sprouted from neighborhoods and workplaces. When working-class football clubs encountered difficulties finding space or resources, they began to seek the help of politicians. The Democratic and Radical parties, both ascendant parties of the middle class that hoped to incorporate workers, were most receptive to these requests.\n\nChilean Football, 1893–1919\n\nIn June 1906, for example, a group of boys contacted the Democratic Party to protest their treatment by a local military regiment. The boys had begun a pickup football game in Parque Cousiño, where they sold fruit. When the soldiers arrived, they demanded the boys abandon the field. After the boys refused, the soldiers proceeded to destroy their fruit, insult them, and beat them.39 The Democratic Party helped the boys publicize their story and report the soldiers to the police. Fights over access to public space broke out frequently and often resulted in police intervention. According to workers’ newspapers, the police unwaveringly supported the wealthier groups in these disputes. The notion that football ought to be democratic and representative of “the people” was a common theme of early sportswriting in the workingclass press. La Reforma, the official organ of the Democratic Party and later of the Socialist Workers’ Party (Partido Obrero Socialista, or POS), connected football to class conflict. Editors of the paper, such as Luis Recabarren, were labor organizers who recognized that football clubs constituted an important part of working-class sociability. In 1906, the paper accused the “bourgeois” directors of the Football Association of Santiago of selecting players to represent the city based on their social class. One writer complained that the selection process was undemocratic, since “the Football Association of Santiago is composed almost entirely of young workers’ clubs.”40 Regarding a match between the rival cities, one journalist commented, “Enthusiasm has not reached the worker sportsmen, because of the indifference with which they have been looked upon, while young men of social position have been placed on the team that will represent Santiago.”41 The paper also claimed that Santiago lost intercity matches to Valparaíso because of the association’s practice of favoring wealthier but less talented players. La Reforma reasoned that because of their more difficult lives, workers possessed greater resilience and strength than elite sportsmen. They did not share the Conservative and Liberal newspapers’ concern with the physical degeneration of the working class. Instead, La Reforma implied that luxurious tastes and easy lifestyles had feminized upper-class athletes. Working-class associations emerged as a collective response to the discrimination that clubs experienced. Baldomero Loyola, a journalist for La Reforma who cofounded the Socialist Workers’ Party with Luis Recabarren and Elías Lafertte, gathered twelve clubs to form the Asociación Obrera de Foot-Ball, or the Workers’ Football Association.42 This group consisted “exclusively of working-class clubs, to disaffiliate\n\n29\n\n30\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nthemselves with bourgeois ones.”43 Delegates held the association’s first meeting in the offices of La Reforma in 1906, during which they elected a provisional directorate and drafted statutes. At a party the following week, club delegates nominated officers for president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary. A variety of clubs joined the Workers’ Football Association, including printers’ clubs (Benjamin Franklin FC and the Britannia Club), neighborhood clubs (Independencia FC), and clubs of municipal workers (Chile-Arjentina). Small Chile FC, a Catholic workers’ club founded by Bishop Edwards, joined the association, but “ideological conflicts” resulted in the club’s withdrawal after two seasons.44 The Workers’ Football Association protested obstacles that workingclass footballers faced in accessing public spaces. Among its first actions, the directorate wrote a letter to local authorities in defense of the football field in Cousiño Park, which was threatened by development projects. The letter urged Santiago’s mayor to stop plans to transform the field “because this measure would harm a great number of football clubs, principally those composed of members of the working class.”45 The association condemned attempts of the Football Association of Santiago to deny popular clubs equal access to fields. They accused the elite directors of segregating the city along class lines. Citing the statutes of the Football Association of Santiago, which stipulated that matches be held in the most publicly accessible manner, workers’ clubs denounced the scheduling of games far from popular neighborhoods.46 The Workers’ Football Association tried to circumvent the Football Association of Santiago and arrange fields for matches between workers’ clubs. For example, many players for Club Chile-Arjentina worked for the municipality. These workers identified a number of uncultivated areas that could be transformed into football fields. The association appealed directly to the municipality, with occasional success, for permission to use these open spaces. The Workers’ Football Association drew upon the skills of its members in the printing industry to spread its ideas for democratically run organizations. They published an instructional pamphlet for workers who wanted to start clubs. The association also produced a short-lived sports magazine, El Sportman, in which it outlined football’s benefits for workers. Writers for El Sportman believed that football helped combat the fatigue brought about by manual labor. The running and jumping required of players “strengthen[ed] their lungs, weakened by the hard and constant work of six days.”47 This contrasted sharply with elite publications, which emphasized modern men’s lack of physical activity. El Sportman also advocated\n\nChilean Football, 1893–1919\n\nfootball for workers because it cost less to play than boxing or cycling, its closest competitors. And for spectators, football matches were much more affordable that the cinema or theater.48 In addition, women and children usually received free admission to matches. Given the benefits of membership, which included access to lectures, club libraries, and social salons, club dues were quite reasonable. The wave of labor agitation in 1906 and the fierce repression that followed, most brutally demonstrated in the Santa María de Iquique massacre in 1907, shaped the foundation of the Workers’ Football Association. Association leaders hoped to forge solidarity among workers. For example, they organized a benefit for victims of the 1906 earthquake in Valparaíso. In publicity for the event, organizers emphasized that workers suffered disproportionately from the resulting dislocation, lost wages, and injuries. The Workers’ Football Association planned the event at Cousiño Park, but just a few days before the tournament, leaders learned that another group had reserved the facilities. Association president José Flores grudgingly requested use of the fields at Club Hípico. Flores worried that club members would refuse to play at the club, which was known as an exclusive space for elite sportsmen. He appealed to their sense of solidarity with the victims in Valparaíso.49 Footballers designed clubs as cooperative, non-for-profit organizations governed by a general assembly and a board of directors. Umbrella organizations incorporated ten to twenty clubs and usually mirrored the basic club structure. A few notable differences distinguished the Workers’ Football Association from others. First, the association limited membership to clubs of manual laborers or those who “worked with their hands.”50 Second, its statutes stipulated that membership not be limited by nationality. Most associations required club members to be Chilean nationals. This restriction, which barred Peruvians and Bolivians from the largest associations, was an important exclusion in the context of state-sanctioned violence against these immigrants. In the early 1900s, the state waged campaigns to “chileanize” those northern provinces involved in border disputes after the War of the Pacific (1879-1883), fought between Chile, Bolivia, and Peru. The statutes of the Workers’ Football Association indicate that the members’ identification with class superseded any sympathies they may have had for nativism. The association’s statutes also differed from the norm in their detailed disciplinary measures, particularly regarding personal appearance. The association required players to be clean and dressed in laundered clothing that conformed to club colors. These\n\n31\n\n32\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nrules indicate that the association was concerned with respectability to an extent that similar organizations were not. Moreover, these regulations overlapped with the focus of reformers on the supposedly poor hygiene of workers. Among workers in mining, railroads, and new urban industries, football clubs formed quickly. In some cases, managers started clubs; in other instances, workers who had already started clubs sought patronage from bosses, although workers’ clubs more commonly opted to maintain their autonomy from management. Conflicts often arose between independent workers’ teams and those organized by companies. Company owners such as newspaper magnate Agustín Edwards hoped that sports would “smooth the rough relations between capital and labor, which are always provoked when guarding their respective interests.”51 Particular industries gained fame for the success of their football teams, especially print shops, paper mills, and butchers. The track champion Fernando Peralta was among the first “worker-sportsmen” to achieve distinction. Through word of mouth and newspaper reports, Peralta attracted hundreds of spectators to his competitions. Workers’ clubs struggled to keep popular athletes in their ranks, a difficult task when company clubs could offer resources ranging from a modest travel budget to lucrative employment opportunities. Despite businessmen’s dreams of creating a more pliable workforce through football, participation in company-sponsored teams often strengthened workers’ identification with one another. Rather than eradicating drinking, gambling, and fighting, football matches ritualized them. As the historian Thomas Klubock demonstrated in the case of the El Teniente copper mines, organized sports bolstered solidarity among workers and developed players’ leadership skills.52 In some cases, unions emerged from sports clubs, which served as a cover and as an organizing base.53 Elías Lafertte, a national labor organizer and founder of the Chilean Communist Party, advocated the creation of sports clubs among workers. He recalled that in the early 1900s, “football teams were at heart extensions of parties and political tendencies.”54 It was in a football club that Lafertte first gained public-speaking experience and ran for elected office. Later, he helped organize a workers’ philharmonic that served as a social center of sports, dance and theater.55 Lafertte believed that workers gained important skills by writing statutes and constitutions, holding regular elections, and building headquarters for football clubs. These social centers offered spaces where workers could congregate and afforded their members a degree of protection from police repression.\n\nChilean Football, 1893–1919\n\nNot all union and leftist party leaders shared Lafertte’s enthusiasm for football. His mentor and fellow Socialist Workers’ Party founder, Luis Recabarren, responded with ambivalence to the popularity of football among workers. Recabarren feared that sports promoted fanatical nationalism at worst, and at best aided in the dissemination of bourgeois values. During football matches held in honor of Chile’s national holiday, he castigated working-class revelers for expressing solidarity with the bourgeoisie and the oligarchy.56 British leftists of the era also scorned team sports as “bourgeois athletic competitions” and encouraged noncompetitive activities such as hiking.57 These nature excursions attracted some workers, but were expensive and time consuming compared with football. Labor leaders worried that football, and sports more generally, did not develop workers’ consciousnesses in the way that didactic theater did.58 Neighborhood football clubs, the most common type of working-class club, encouraged a connection between workplaces and communities. The International FC provides an example of how local, class, and gender identities intersected in barrio, or neighborhood, football teams. A group of railroad workers and their neighbors founded the International FC in the city of Concepción. Concepción was considered the gateway to Chile’s southern provinces, known for resilient indigenous communities and coal mining. In 1903, players for the International FC joined a solidarity strike in support of stevedores in Valparaíso.59 The wave of strike activity lasted throughout the year, and confrontations with state and company authorities left hundreds of workers dead or injured. The strikers’ militancy contributed to their reputation as tough footballers with a rebellious spirit. In 1904, the International FC changed its name to Fernández Víal in honor of the admiral who served as an arbiter between company managers and the strikers. Admiral Fernández recommended that the state stop using military violence against the workers. Thereafter, Fernández Víal FC would be one of the most popular Chilean teams, and one very much associated with a combative working-class tradition.60\n\nfootball, schoolteachers, and physical education Middle-class reformers and workers’ clubs forged enduring relationships within football organizations. Middle-class club founders often belonged to centrist political parties, especially the Radical Party. To a lesser extent, they joined the more conservative Liberal and more radical Democratic parties. These middle-class professionals connected their political and\n\n33\n\n34\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nsports activities. The middle class was a nebulous category in much of Latin America at the turn of the century. Its emergence in Chile stemmed from the expansion of the state and the growth of professional positions within it. Public-school teachers carved a role for themselves in reform movements as experts on working-class life. Their claim to understand workers reflected the thin line that separated them, geographically and economically, from the poor.61 This expertise became part of the teachers’ efforts to wrest control of the educational system from the Catholic Church. In this context, physical education arose as a secular response to the social question and a perceived urban health crisis. Middle- and working-class organizations shared a common belief in the ability of science and technology to overcome poverty. Writers for the leftist La Reforma complained, “Neither Congress nor the government has done anything for the poor classes. None of the methods of modern social progress that have been applied in European nations are yet known among us.”62 Physical-education teachers who set out to establish the discipline thought that scientific training could help condition workers’ bodies for work and encourage sobriety. Leading educators viewed football as a way to promote nationalism as well as improve the physical state of workers. In 1905, Domingo Villalobos, the director of the educational journal La Revista de Instrucción Primaria, put together standardized lesson plans for public schools. In the schemata he distributed to teachers, physical education fell under the category of natural sciences. As the introduction to the course material explained, “The gymnasium is like a second natural environment. It shapes and forms the bodies of the miners that go to the heart of the earth; of the sailors that carry our products to remote shores; of the soldiers that advance over the deserts and cordilleras.”63 Villalobos and his collaborators emphasized physical education’s role in producing future citizens. Their lesson plans connected the shaping of workers’ bodies with the protection of the nation, economically and militarily. The physical-education curriculum sought to strengthen Chileans’ connection to nature, which urbanization supposedly endangered. Educators viewed this relationship as essential to the development of their students’ patriotic impulses and moral fiber. Physical-education instructors involved in reform movements focused on the improvement of public health and urban life. Many of these teachers worked in night schools, temperance societies, and other community groups. They hoped team sports could address “character defects such\n\nChilean Football, 1893–1919\n\nas cowardice, lack of initiative, and violence.”64 Their experiences in the classroom and the sensational press coverage of juvenile delinquency influenced teachers. Articles on working-class youth frequently characterized mothers employed outside the home as negligent and responsible for the rise in crime.65 Physical-education teachers pointed out that team sports could provide supervision for children during the hours that parents worked. Many of these teachers lived in and around their students’ neighborhoods and experienced the conditions of urban squalor firsthand. Their schools lacked adequate infrastructure; many were dirty, without bathrooms, and were located next to bars.66 Reform-oriented teachers, less concerned with national defense, argued that sports could engage young people with community affairs.67 More broadly, they connected this civic engagement with the future of Chilean democracy.68 Public-health crises galvanized footballers to become involved in international forums that addressed rapid urbanization in Latin America.69 During the first Pan-American Scientific Congress, held in 1908 in Santiago, physical-education teachers sought to incorporate sports into plans to address cramped housing, epidemics, and other health hazards. The conference proceedings prompted the National Education Association to recommend that physical education be mandatory at each stage of schooling.70 They drew on findings of nutritionists, economists, and medical specialists to advocate a “scientific” physical-education program. At the conference, Guillermo Martínez warned against the use of physical education to achieve military goals. He did not believe that scientific physical training was compatible with military needs. Instead, he urged sportsmen to see football clubs as “collectivities with soul.”71 He recommended that physical-education teachers work in the community to address students’ malnutrition, alcohol and tobacco abuse, and illiteracy. Martínez was not the only physical-education instructor who wanted to connect the classroom with the community. For example, the Loma Blanca FC, a club of high school students, alumni, and teachers, organized a series of football matches in Santiago prisons in 1915. The club hoped these competitions would highlight football as an instrument of reform. The medical field strongly influenced physical-education curricula in the early 1900s. In 1912, a group of sports club directors, educators, and physicians formed the Chilean Physical Education League. Led by the Swedish doctor Henrik Ling, this group intended to promote the physical education of both sexes in schools, clubs, and factories. The league\n\n35\n\n36\n\nCitizens and Sportsmen\n\nbelieved that athletics could reduce outbreaks of contagious diseases and improve the health of urban youth.72 Ling became a celebrity in Chile for his advocacy of exercise among women and for his recommendation that sports clubs include them. The league advised women that they could discover ways to overcome the “weakness” of their sex through sports rather than “the vulgar practices of feminism.”73 League directors pointed out that women’s athletics were fashionable in “developed” countries, citing the growth of women’s boxing in the United States.74 Ling and his devotees traveled to northern Europe, promising to bring the most modern techniques to Chilean education. Physical-education teachers played a leading role in standardizing the rules and regulations of football matches. In their estimation, instructors and coaches lacked adequate teaching materials. In 1912, Chile and Argentina became the first countries in the Americas to join the International Federation of Association Football (Fédération Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA), which demanded adherence to European rules. Throughout the 1910s, groups published pamphlets to disseminate the game’s formal rules and proper playing etiquette. In 1917, referees Juan Livingstone and Alfred Betteley put together one of the most popular instructional books.75 They explained, “Thousands of Chilean aficionados practice football, from one extreme of the republic to the other, but sadly, we doubt that even a small fraction of them know the basis of the rules, not from a lack of interest or preparation, but from the complete absence of a manual.”76 Livingstone and Betteley organized the Chilean Association of Football Referees, which they hoped would standardize penalties, rules, and acceptable behavior. Physical-education instructors hoped that expanded public-school programs would help the process of standardization. According to teachers, Chile’s last-place finish in the South American Cup of 1916 further demonstrated the need for scientific training.77 A small but important minority of physical-education teachers felt that football should primarily complement the military training of young men. Many of these teachers and administrators came from a military background. This sector argued that physical education’s highest goal was to train young men to “successfully defend the motherland.”78 These military-oriented instructors saw exercise as necessary preparation for warding off threats to the nation rather than as a way to alleviate the physical stresses of urban life. Militarist educators conflated “racial threats” to the individual body with threats to the nation. They warned that unless\n\nChilean Football, 1893–1919\n\na young man exercised daily, “his blood would lose its purity and his muscles and organs in general would suffer the consequences.”79 Their descriptions characterized the male body as the defender of the nation. The nation, in turn, appeared vulnerable, passive, and female.\n\npolitics and football: the national sports federation The campaign to construct a national stadium illustrates the developing relationship between politics and football clubs. The National Sports Federation (FSN) represented one of the few organizations in Chile that boasted a multiclass membership. Its creation attests to the growth of clubs, the variety of political ideologies that circulated within them, and their connections to politicians. Although it is difficult to estimate the number of football club members, it is safe to assume that by 1910, membership numbered 3,000–4,000 in Santiago, 2,000–3,000 in Valparaíso, around 1,000 in the northern cities Iquique and Coquimbo, and around 500 in the southern cities Concepción and Temuco.80 Through their participation in the FSN, working-class clubs made demands upon the state for recreational resources. In 1908, the inspector general of primary education, Felipe Casas Espínola, called an open meeting of sportsmen to form a national organization. Casas hoped this organization could build a grand sports stadium. The attendees voted to create the National Sports Federation. The FSN represented sportsmen from across the socioeconomic spectrum; however, the leaders of the FSN had powerful ties to the political establishment. The FSN’s directors acted as lobbyists, meeting with sympathetic politicians and mobilizing various sports entities around the stadium project. The FSN was among the first civic associations to petition for state intervention in culture. In this way, sportsmen contributed to a growing sentiment that the state had an obligation to provide public resources for recreation and to regulate social life. On May 20, 1909, the FSN organized its first public protest. Marchers included workers from the Arturo Prat Football Association, representatives of the National Education Association, and the wealthy congressman Jorge Matte Gormaz. Protestors marched through the streets of Santiago, demanding that the government support a national stadium, suspend taxes on sporting goods, and invest in public parks.81 Approximately four thousand sportsmen began their demonstration at the office of the newspaper El Mercurio, where"
