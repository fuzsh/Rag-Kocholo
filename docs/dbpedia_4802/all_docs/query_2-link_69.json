        "text": "Although there have been significant advancements in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in general and specifically in field of special education in recent years, there are still difficulties in providing an inclusive and accessible environment of learning for all children.The foundation for an inclusive education model at all educational levels, is proposed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) (General, 2015). Goal 4 of the SDG outlines this: Make ensuring that each individual has access to high quality inclusive education, and encourage enduring opportunities of learning (General, 2015). This educational concept has been extensively explored in earlier research over the past few decades. Additionally, because of the lack of advancement and vigor in its administration, this topic is still contentious (Ainscow, 2019; Medina García, 2018; Echeita Sarrionandia, & Ainscow, 2011). Realizing the right to an education in a system that takes into account the requirements of all students, specifically considering students with special needs (disabilities), is known as inclusive education. All pupils are accepted in inclusive schools, irrespective of linguistic, intellectual, social, physical, or other limitations (Unesco, 2005). Diversity is so valued and recognized as a valuable component of education (UNESCO, 2017). As a result, it's critical to approach education in three distinct domains that could either promote or inhibit the complete inclusion of individuals with special needs in the educational system. Culture, Policies and Inclusive Actions are those domains (Gutiérrez-Ortega et al, 2018). These areas seek to support all students' attendance, involvement, and academic success, irrespective of their circumstances or backgrounds (UNESCO, 2017).\n\nSpecial education in the KSA began as a Braille reading training program in the year 1958.There were no services for any other categories except blindness and visual impairments, and the services were restricted to adults with visual impairments (Al-Wabli, 1996).\n\nAl-Kheraigi (1989) reports that by 1987, there were 27 Institutes of special education throughout KSA to cater to the needs of pupils who were blind, deaf, or have intellectual disabilities. An additional growth was noted in the year of 1987 to 2000, leading to the establishment of 54 special education schools nationwide. According to the ministry of Education there were more than 316 programs in the year 2000, for hearing impaired students, along with 171 programs for the students of visual impairments (Ministry of Education of Saudi Arabia, 2012). Additionally, since they have been fully integrated into regular classrooms in public schools, students with special needs have received education within 1417 programs in the special resource rooms (Al-Otaibi & Al-Sartawi, 2009). In Addition to these Special schools cater for students with a range of impairments and special needs (Alquraini, 2011).\n\nIn order to define the rights and regulations governing students with disabilities' access to special education programs, in the year 2001, KSA established the Rules and Regulations of Special Education Programs (RRSEP). Additionally, the regulations identify important student populations with a range of disabilities, including autism, learning difficulties, intellectual disabilities, blindness, deafness, and hearing impairments.\n\nThe government determines whether a pupil is eligible for combined or individual program based on the type of impairment. According to Ministry of Education of Saudi Arabia (2002) each and every student with special needs has the legal right to suitable and free special education, early individual educational programs, intervention programs, transition education and related services (Alquraini, 2010).\n\nThe Disability Law was another law that the Saudi Arabian government enacted in 2000. This law guarantees that all individuals with disabilities shall have equal access in public organization to mental health, educational, and rehabilitation services, without any expenses. According to Alquraini (2010), people with disabilities have the right to reserve and have access to special education and rehabilitation programs through these authorities.\n\nThe notion of universal design (UD), originating in the architectural domain, is becoming more prevalent when debating methods to improve educational accessibility for individuals with impairments (Mcguire et al., 2006).\n\nThis study explores the application of the seven principles of Universal Design (UD) in the context of special education in KSA. Scholars such as Alquraini and Gut (2012) have highlighted the progress made in special education in KSA, emphasizing the need for ongoing efforts to cater for the varied necessities of students with disabilities. Challenges, including limited resources and varying levels of teacher preparedness, underscore the importance of adopting frameworks like Universal Design.\n\nFor the past ten years, the KSA Special Education system has been working to create an integrated framework (Hadidi & Al Khateeb, 2015). The process was challenging and involved many factors, taking into account the students' transitional requirements, the main emphasis was on academics (Al-Zahrani, 2011). For years, Saudi Arabia's special education programs have been developed with the goal of raising, improving, and supporting the educational accomplishment of students with disabilities (Aldabas, 2015). The global vision for the inclusion of students with special needs has been based on the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) paradigm. To fill in the gaps in general school to successfully transition to inclusive educational programs, curriculum designs for instruction, student assessments as well as academic transition planning needs special attention (Mapolisa & Tshabalala, 2013). Although relatively new in Saudi Arabia, systems like universal design have been used for some years in the US and other western nations. Studies reveal that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia lacks transition courses for universal design, poorly implements transition, and lack familiarity universal design concept in the education for students with special needs.\n\nThe concept of Universal Design, originally developed for architecture, has been adapted for educational settings to create inclusive learning environments. The seven principles of Universal Design, as proposed by the Center for Universal Design at North Carolina State University (Center for Universal Design, 1997), provide a framework for designing curriculum, instruction, and assessments that cater to the needs of all learners.\n\nEquitable Use\n\nEquitable use, the first principle of Universal Design, emphasizes the importance of providing fair access to educational resources. In the context of special education in KSA, this principle calls for the development of instructional materials and technologies that accommodate diverse abilities (Rose & Meyer, 2002).\n\nFlexibility in Use\n\nFlexibility in use encourages educators to offer compound ways of demonstration, expression, and engagement. In KSA, this could involve adapting teaching methods to suit various learning styles and providing alternative assessments (CAST, 2011).\n\nSimple and Intuitive\n\nThe principle of simple and intuitive design underscores the importance of clarity in instructional materials. For students in special education in KSA, ensuring that instructions are straightforward and easy to understand is crucial for effective learning (Burgstahler, 2015).\n\nPerceptible Information\n\nPerceptible information calls for the presentation of content in multiple formats to cater to diverse sensory modalities. In the Saudi context, this principle promotes the use of visual, auditory, and tactile elements to make information accessible to all students (Burgstahler, 2015).\n\nTolerance for Error\n\nTolerance for error encourages the design of assessments that allow for mistakes and provide opportunities for feedback and improvement. This principle is particularly relevant in special education settings in KSA, where individualized learning pathways are essential (Rose & Meyer, 2002).\n\nLow Physical Effort\n\nLow physical effort emphasizes the importance of minimizing physical barriers in the learning environment. In KSA, this principle calls for infrastructure and classroom design that accommodates students with diverse physical abilities (CAST, 2011).\n\nSize and Space for Approach and Use\n\nEnsuring adequate size and space for approach and use in the physical environment is critical for students with mobility challenges. This principle advocates for accessible infrastructure in special education settings in KSA (Center for Universal Design, 1997).\n\nThe application of Universal Design principles in special education of KSA presents an opportunity to create more inclusive and accessible learning environments. By understanding and incorporating these principles, educators and policymakers can contribute to the ongoing progress of special education in KSA, ultimately fostering a more equitable educational system.\n\nThe primary obstacles preventing disabled students from participating fully in university life have been examined in a number of studies (Sandoval Mena et al, 2019) with particular focus given to issues pertaining to the existence of architectural barriers and the availability of communication and information resources.However, it is crucial to consider teacher preparation and student attitudes toward fellow students with disabilities as a crucial component of the learning process (Moriña Díez et al, 2019; Bars et al., 2014).\n\nThe closely knit curriculum, which is referred to be \"one size fits all\" (Cast, 2011) for all pupils, is another aspect that sticks out as an obstacle to achieving full inclusion. It is challenging to respond the educational demands that may result from situations of impairment in the classroom because of this curriculum rigidity (Moswela & Mukhopadhyay, 2011). Universal design for learning (UDL) is the paradigm that can ensure the removal of educational obstacles and the foundation that ensures all students have access to the curriculum (Mcguire, 2014). Teaching through universal design and training in universal design are two viewpoints that are taken into consideration when applying UDL in the academic setting in order to ensure the complete participation of all its members (Fuentes, 2013)\n\nUniversity professors should receive training in Universal Design for Learning (UDL), which is defined as “a research-based approach to curriculum design that enables everyone to develop knowledge, skills, motivation and involvement in the learning process” (Cast, 2011). This is evident from the second strand, which is connected to teaching from the perspective of UDL.\n\nMany ideas have emerged from this pedagogically grounded tool. Among these is the universal design for instruction (UDI), which is particularly applicable in higher education. In order to ensure that every student has access to the university curriculum, UDI attempts to foresee and prepare the learning process (Dalmau Montalà et al., 2015).\n\nThough, Special education programs in KSA were limited to blind pupils until the latter part of the 20th century, when Braille was introduced into the classroom (Aldabas, 2015; Battal, 2016).\n\nEducational authorities have recently directed their attention toward special education disciplines by offering equipment, transportation, grants, scholarships, and assistive educational technologies. In order to prepare for special education transitions, the General Administration of Special Education has also worked together for both urban and rural populations in regular schools (Battal, 2016).\n\nAccording to Battal (2016), Saudi Arabia's remarkable economic growth and modernization over the past few decades have been largely responsible for the faster learning advancements for students with disabilities. However, there are still issues with education administration, delivery, and training that make it difficult for students with varied impairments to integrate with mainstream pupils. Aldabas (2015) came to the conclusion that before implementing inclusive programs for children with disabilities, Saudi Arabia needed to introduce more modules for professional development for all educational personnel.\n\nBased on international rights and religious convictions, the government seeks to teach unique individuals in accordance with the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Therefore, by developing precise teaching methodologies for children with special educational needs, the Education Ministry has made an effort to grow and enhance the Education Division. Discrete measures were used to launch the initial stages of special education in 1956 (Al-Mousa, 2008). In 1968, the Saudi government began working with the UNESCO organization to train and prepare forty teachers (Al-Muslat, 1984). In Saudi Arabia, there were just two universities offering special education teacher preparation programs until 2002. As a result, there was a great need to establish these sectors in order to train and qualify teachers for children with special needs. The number of graduates has increased recently as current legislation mandates that tutors shall have a bachelor's degree in special education to teach in the institute of special education (Al-Musa et al., 1999).\n\nRegarding the professional experience and training of the instructors and teacher, there is enough evidence to substantiate the idea that improving inclusive educational practices greatly benefits from pre-service or in-service training. According to Avramidis and Kalyva (2007: p. 139), a large number of administrators and teachers lack professional education in inclusive education, which makes it difficult to integrate these students into general education classrooms.\n\nAccording to a few studies on this new framework, the needs of the great majority of special students can be successfully met when the UDT and UDL frameworks are used in tandem. To bridge the gap between perception and evidence—which could prevent UDT from being implemented—teachers must engage in ongoing training on this relatively new idea. A framework founded on research will benefit parents, teachers, and children equally. It will offer a logical structure for instructing and readying every student, regardless of needs, for life after school.\n\nResearchers, national legislators, and educational faculty have all looked into the creation of instructional models and frameworks that could explain how to give every student the chance to learn (Aslaksen et al., 1997). In order to serve the varied range of students universal design extends learning spaces, educational infrastructures, and instructional materials and support resources (Rose et al., 2006). Furthermore, according to Aslaksen et al. (1997), the idea of universal design includes the search for specific solutions as required for varied students without stigmatizing a certain student group.\n\nThe amount to which a design conveys essential information in a way that is independent of circumstances and sensory capacities is known as perceptible information. Error tolerance improves one's ability to reduce unfavorable or dangerous consequences. Additionally, its design boosts efficiency with little activity and requires less physical exertion. Its applications and methodology's dimensions and layout make it the most user-friendly. In addition, UDT has its roots in the literature on UDL integration because it borrows many of itstenets from UDL. The strategy used, according to the authors, encourages impaired students to succeed, especially in rural populations.\n\nA more recent paradigm known as Universal Design for Transition (UDT) utilizes the fundamental ideas of Universal Design, which calls for a physically accessible and egalitarian environment. Additionally, the idea includes Universally Designed education (equitable and accessible education) tailored specifically to the fields of Special Education Transition and Transition Planning, or Universal Design for Learning. The UD, UDI, and UDL concepts are recognized as crucial pillars for the environment and education in the United States. In education, these kinds of inclusive design are frequently afterthoughts and treated as combative efforts, like adding accommodations afterward as opposed to designing for everyone originally (Stolz, 2010). These notions are not always accepted or celebrated up front during planning. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) statute for students with disabilities has been practically adopted by KSA.\n\nThe inclusion approach has garnered more attention in Saudi Arabia in the past few years. The amount of students with hearing impairments enrolled in regular classrooms has increased as a result of this focus. Al-Mousa (2008) notes that in addition, it has quickly increased the overall number of special education curriculum. It is vital to examine the body of research and look into any gaps given the rapid expansion of specialized programs in schools of general education with a focus on inclusion. Difficulties encountered during transition may result in failure as transition services for students with disabilities are either very wide or overly focused on supporting a seamless transfer.\n\nUniversal Design for Transition (UDT) is a new paradigm for instructional design, evaluation, and educational planning that was developed by Thoma, Bartholomew, and Scott (2009). UDT is a concept for instructional design that can be used in KSA for a smooth transition for students with disabilities. In order to support students with disabilities in achieving their academic, social, and vocational goals as they transition from school-age to adulthood, this method incorporates a variety of tactics and concepts, mostly from UDL (Thoma, Bartholomew, & Scott, 2016). UDL equips educators with the knowledge and abilities to create an inclusive learning environment and instruction via purposeful planning and foresight.\n\nA greater chance of a smooth transition from school to life after graduation is evident when evaluation methods are combined, students are provided with a range of materials and viewpoints, and student autonomy is encouraged to assist academic advancement (Thoma et al., 2022; Thoma et al., 2016). The term (UDT) describes an open method of developing, delivering, and evaluating teaching that helps students with disabilities transition from academic to employment services. In addition to teaching in post-secondary education, teachers are in charge of assisting students in reaching their academic and transitional objectives (Thoma et al., 2016). The social and constructed environments are not typically made with all students' needs in mind, so it is crucial to create programs that meet the requirements of all students, including those with various disabilities.\n\nAccording to Cawthon et al. (2014), educators must acquire the prior of knowledge of UDT principles before use. Sadly, a lack of professional development opportunities has left many instructors without the knowledge, expertise necessary to assist students with disabilities in making the transition. According to Scott et al. (2011), UDT strategies for special education are useful and supported by research compared to conventional teaching, engagement, and assessment methods.\n\nWithin the same framework, Mayer (2008) contended that learning models—which in turn derive causal assertions about the efficacy of the instructional approach—should serve as the foundation for instructional practice. These models should be grounded in empirical evidence that is theoretically grounded. Teachers must have a thorough understanding of UDT concepts in for the program to be successful. The body of research on disabilities provides a thorough overview of professional development and transition planning for special education instructors, and teacher preparation. It also makes a strong case for the need for additional evidence based research (Scott et al., 2011).\n\nA 2015 research by Aldabas recommended national special education policies and comprehensive instructor training in the perspective of Saudi Arabian institutions."
