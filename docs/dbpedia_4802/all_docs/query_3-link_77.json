        "text": "What a difference a week makes. Under new interim manager Jaime Lozano, Mexico put on a show in a 4-0 demolition of lowly Honduras in their 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup opener.\n\nThe embarrassing 3-0 loss to the USA in the Nations League semifinal led to the firing of manager Diego Cocca, and the appointment of interim Jaime Lozano, who changed the attitude of the team ahead of this first Gold Cup match.\n\nIt was a new-look Mexico that came out on the attack, scoring after just 55 seconds from the start of the match. Midfielder Luis Romo smashed home a loose ball for the first goal, and then he scored Mexico's second in the 23rd minute by heading home on a set-piece play.\n\nIn the second half, an electric Orbelin Pineda went on a sensational run to make it 3-0, before Luis Chavez took advantage of a favorable deflection to poke home a fourth goal on a magical night for El Tri.\n\nThanks to the lopsided win, Mexico jump to the top spot in Group B ahead on goal difference over Haiti, who won their match over Gold Cup guest team Qatar, 2-1. Mexico and Haiti will face off on Thursday.\n\nHonduras looked every bit the team that finished in last place in 2022 World Cup qualifying, but they still have a chance to rebound in group play with matches against Qatar and Haiti coming up next.\n\nMORE: 2023 Gold Cup bracket and schedule\n\nMexico vs Honduras final score\n\nFinal Goal scorers Mexico 4 Luis Romo 1', 23'\n\nOrbelin Pineda 52' (Henry Martin)\n\nLuis Chavez 64' Honduras 0\n\nLineups:\n\nMexico (4-3-3, right to left): 13-Ochoa (GK) — 19-J. Sanchez, 4-Alvarez (21-Reyes 80'), 5-Vasquez, 23-Gallardo — 14-E. Sanchez (8-Charly, 69'), 7-Romo, 18-L. Chavez — 15-Antuna (9-Herrera, 69'), 20-Martin (11-Gimenez, 58'), 17-Pineda (10-Alvarado, 80')\n\nHonduras (4-2-3-1, right to left): 22-L. Lopez (GK) — 4-Santos, 2-D. Garcia, 15-Vega, 8-Rosales — 20-Flores, 14-J. Alvarez (6-Acosta, 69') — 7-Elis (9-Castillo, 76'), 10-A. Lopez (19-Elvir, 60'), 17-Pinto (21-Orellana, 60') — 12-Benguche (11-Bengtson, 60')\n\nHow Jaime Lozano transformed Mexico\n\nEven the most optimistic Mexico fans could not have imagined this type of turnaround under Jaime 'Jimmy' Lozano. Now there's talk of this Mexico side being a 'LamborJimmy' though there's also something to be said about how poor Honduras were on the night.\n\nOn a basic level, Lozano asked his team to be positive and attack, pushing numbers forward. It wasn't the defense-first approach of his predecessor Diego Cocca. Instead, he had players interchanging positions, seeking out quick combinations, crashing the Honduras box, and generally expressing themselves. The goal after just 50 seconds was a direct result of this approach.\n\nThe players responded to Lozano in a similar way to the 2021 Olympic team, which went all the way to a bronze medal. And this Mexico was missing several of its best players ('Chucky' Lozano, Alexis Vega, and Sebastian Cordova).\n\nJaime Lozano's biggest decisions in debut\n\nThe attitude and approach are one thing, but Lozano also made important tactical and personnel moves that led to the result.\n\nLozano benched center-back Israel Reyes, and was content to play a midfielder (Edson Alvarez) in his spot. And the new boss also showed faith in midfielder Luis Romo, who shined for Lozano during Mexico's 2021 Olympic bronze medal run.\n\nAnd in central midfield, Lozano opted for the two players who start together at Pachuca. And both Luis Chavez and Erick Sanchez played their best Mexico matches in some time. Both players pushed into the attack on multiple occasions, and Chavez scored a goal and nearly had another.\n\nLozano also stuck with Henry Martin at center forward despite all the criticism leveled at the Club America forward. And the new manager was rewarded for his decision, because the marauding midfielders played off Martin as they pushed forward. This was most evident on Orbelin Pineda's goal.\n\nDoes Mexico need a Mexican coach?\n\nThere's a third factor that will probably be the biggest talking point in the coming week: that Jaime Lozano was able to get the best out of the team because he is a Mexican coach. He's the first Mexican manager since Miguel Herrera back in 2015. Lozano himself highlighted it.\n\n\"The players know us [the coaching staff],\" Lozano said postgame. \"The players had a successful cycle [2021 Olympics] with this coaching staff. Despite having such little time, these players are great, and they can't forget it so easily.\n\n\"Confidence is something you have to draw it out [of the players]. You have to speak to them [the players] a lot,\" Lozano continued. \"I think it's also a cultural thing. I experienced it in at the Olympics in the sense that in the end we're Mexicans. And it's a good advantage to know us [Mexicans], and what we like, and what we don't like, and to know what we need.\"\n\nWhen Lozano was asked in a follow-up question whether he thought the permanent Mexican national team manager needed to be Mexican, he elaborated on his thoughts some more.\n\n\"I don't know that [the manager] needs to be Mexican. But what I've received since i've arrived is the affection from the fans. Not the players, the fans. They are happy and proud,\" Lozano said. \"I don't know if he [the manager] needs to be Mexican, but I think that if he's not going to be Mexican, he needs to understand how we are so that he can take advantage and capitalize on what we can achieve.That's how I think about it.\"\n\nMexico vs Honduras updates, highlights and commentary from Gold Cup 2023\n\nFinal: Mexico 4-0 Honduras\n\n80th min.: SUBS Mexico. Jaime 'Jimmy' Lozano makes his final two changes. Piojo Alvarado and Israel Reyes are in the match.\n\n73rd min.: Chance Mexico! Santi Gimenez scores, but it's clear that he was offside on the backheel touch from 'Charly' Rodriguez, who like the other Mexico midfielders was in the Honduras penalty area on the play!!!\n\n70th min.: Chance Honduras! A rare opportunity with an Omar Elvir cross from the left and Alberth Elis nearly gets to it in the box, but goalkeeper Guillermo 'Memo' Ochoa beats him to the ball. That was the most dangerous chance for Honduras, but this is Mexico's night.\n\n69th min.: SUBS for both teams. Charly and Ozziel are in for Mexico. Bryan Acosta replaces Jorge Alvarez in central midfield for Honduras.\n\n64th min.: Goal Mexico! It's another midfielder finding himself in the box. This time it's Luis Chavez taking advantage of a deflection and he's alone in the middle of the Honduras box to poke it home.\n\nAnd it's worth noting that it was fellow central midfielder Erick 'Chiquito' Sanchez who was challenging for the ball near the box. It's an all-out Mexico attack.\n\n60th min.: SUBS for both teams. Mexico forward Santi Gimenez is on for Henry Martin. Honduras make three subs in the attack. Honduras manager Diego Vazquez is either looking to shake things up, or he's resting his best players for the next game.\n\n53rd min.: Goal Mexico! What a solo play by Orbelin Pineda, who's been electric today. He went on a run, played a wall pass with Henry Martin, and then blasted the ball to make it 3-0.\n\n50th min.: Chance Honduras! But an offside flag against Honduras forward Jorge Benguche ruins the opportunity created by Alberth Elis.\n\n46th min.: The second half is underway. The same 22 players come out for the second 45 minutes. No changes.\n\nHalftime: Mexico 2-0 Honduras\n\nHalftime: Mexico looked like a different team compared to the Nations League debacle because El Tri wasn't trying to play conservative or on the counter. They were on the front foot, pushing players forward, and looking for quick combinations.\n\nIt looks like players had freedom to interchange positions, to express themselves and to pop up in different places. Honduras had a hard time keeping up with all the runs.\n\nHalftime: And so it's a new Mexico! And the memes are out! It's the Lamborjimmy (Jaime 'Jimmy' Lozano) and that dance that we'll be seeing plenty if El Tri can keep this up.\n\n43rd min.: Chance Mexico! Moments after Erick 'Chiquito' Sanchez wanted a penalty in the box (there was nothing in it), Uriel Antuna comes inside and his blast from a central position is blocked for a corner. Mexico are inspired tonight.\n\n40th min.: Chance Honduras! It's the first look for Honduras forward Jorge Benguche, but Mexico center-back Johan Vasquez comes sliding through with the excellent block. Vasquez is another player who looks energized tonight.\n\n33rd min.: YELLOW card to Alberth Elis for protests after he was brought down on the left flank. This time the Honduras set piece reaches the box, but Johan Vasquez and Luis Vega clash heads, and the chance is gone. Play resumes after a few minutes of treatment.\n\n29th min.: YELLOW card to Jorge Sanchez for another hard foul. Mexico are aggressive in this game. They're playing with bite, though it cost them a caution there. But on the ensuing set piece, Honduras playmaker Alex Lopez fails to deliver a dangerous ball in the box.\n\n23rd min.: Goal Mexico! Luis Romo again! On a set piece, Jesus Gallardo heads down a ball into the ground and Romo then heads it into the goal on the bounce. It's 2-0!\n\nIt looked like there could be an offside, but it counts.\n\n19th min.: Chance Mexico! Henry Martin and Luis Chavez miss connecting on a cross from right-back Jorge Sanchez.\n\nThere's movement, one-touch passing and there are numbers in the attack. Mexico look like they're close to a second goal.\n\n10th min.: Is it the Lozano-effect? There's a different energy and positivity about Mexico's play to start the match. And the fans are now behind them at NRG Stadium.\n\nHonduras have shaken off the blow and are trying to play. But there's a wave going around the stadium!\n\n1st min.: Goal Mexico! Dream start to Jaime Lozano's debut as manager. El Tri start on the front foot, and midfielder Luis Romo is the first to a Honduran clearance, and he blasts it past Buba Lopez.\n\nAccording to one media member, it's the second fastest goal in the history of the CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nKickoff\n\n2 mins to kickoff: That's a big crowd at NRG Stadium in Houston to watch these two teams:\n\n5 mins to kickoff: It's time for the anthems, with Mexico up first.\n\n15 mins to kickoff: Some places have been counting the days that a Mexican manager hasn't been at the helm of El Tri:\n\n20 mins to kickoff: Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa warming up close to the fans as he was waiting for the Haiti vs. Qatar match to wrap.\n\n45 mins to kickoff: The official lineups are out. No changes from the pregame projected lineup for Honduras.\n\n1 hour to kickoff: There's a change to the earlier leaked lineup with Edson Alvarez (a midfielder) at center-back and Erick Sanchez (not Charly Rodriguez) in midfield.\n\n2 hours to kickoff: Fox Sports personality Raul Orvananos shared what he reports to be the Mexico starting XI against Honduras. Henry Martin is at center-forward, and Israel Reyes at center-back.\n\n2 hours to kickoff: One player who's thrilled to be in Houston is former Houston Dynamo forward Alberth Elis. The Honduran star is on the books at Bordeaux, but he was on loan for six months with Brest where he failed to score a goal in 10 appearances.\n\nMexico vs Honduras lineups\n\nThe big news in the last 24 hours was the loss of playmaker Sebastian Cordova, who was replaced in the squad by his Tigres teammate Diego Lainez. Unavailable for the group stage due to a three-game suspension is center-back Cesar Montes.\n\nFor his first lineup with the senior team, Interim manager Jaime Lozano selects his 2021 Olympic forward Henry Martin at forward ahead of Santi 'Chaquito' Gimenez, and surprisingly gives another Olympic veteran, midfielder Edson Alvarez, a start at center-back.\n\nMexico starting lineup (4-3-3): 13-Guillermo Ochoa (GK) — 19-Jorge Sanchez, 4-Edson 'El Machin' Alvarez, 5-Johan Vasquez, 23-Jesus Gallardo — 14-Erick Sanchez, 7-Luis Romo, 18-Luis Chavez — 15-Uriel Antuna, 20-Henry Martin, 17-Orbelin Pineda\n\nMexico subs (10): 1-Jose Antonio Rodriguez (GK), 12-Luis Malagon (GK), 21-Israel Reyes, 22-Victor Guzman, 2-Julian Araujo, 8-Carlos 'Charly' Rodriguez, 10-Roberto 'Piojo' Alvarado, 9-Ozziel Herrera, 16-Diego Lainez, 11-Santi 'Chaquito' Gimenez\n\nHonduras line up with the experienced Devron Garcia in place of the injured Carlos Melendez at center-back. However, his defensive partner Luis Vega, is an up-and-comer to watch. Alex Lopez makes Honduras go at attacking midfield, while Deiby Flores and Jorge Alvarez will be the destroyers in the heart of midfield.\n\nHonduras starting lineup (4-2-3-1): 22-Luis 'Buba' Lopez (GK) — 4-Marcelo Santos, 2-Devron Garcia, 15-Luis Vega, 8-Josep Rosales — 20-Deiby Flores, 14-Jorge Alvarez — 7-Alberth Elis, 10-Alex Lopez, 17-Jose Mario Pinto — 12-Jorge Benguche\n\nHonduras subs (12): 1-Edrick Menjivar (GK), 3-Wesly Decas, 5-Christian Altamirano, 6-Bryan Acosta, 13-Maylor Nunez, 16-Edwin Solano, 18-Harold Fonseca, 19-Omar Elvir, 21-Alexy Orellana, 23-Franklin Flores, 9-Rubillo Castillo, 11-Jerry Bengtson\n\nMORE: How to watch the Gold Cup in the USA\n\nHow to watch Mexico vs Honduras\n\nDate: Sunday, June 25\n\nTime: 8:30 p.m. ET\n\nUSA TV and live streaming: FS1, Univision, TUDN, Fubo, TUDN site/app, Fox Sports site/app\n\nCanada TV and live streaming: Telus (Ch. 980), Fubo Canada, OneSoccer site/app\n\nUSA\n\nThe Mexico vs. Honduras match will be televised in the USA on FS1 (English), Univision and TUDN (Spanish), with all three channels streaming on Fubo, which offers a free trial for new users.\n\nFans who are subscribed to cable, satellite or telco packages can use their authenticated credentials to access the match on the Fox Sports and TUDN site and app.\n\nCanada\n\nFans in Canada can watch Mexico vs. Honduras on OneSoccer, which is televised on Telus Optik TV (Channel 980) and streamed on Fubo Canada."
