        "text": "Professional soccer will return to the Central Valley, with a possible stadium at the current parking lot in front of Selland Arena.\n\nFuego FC will play in the USL 1 league starting 2022 as an expansion franchise, team officials tell GV Wireâ . The team is eyeing two locations to build a soccer stadium — downtown Fresno or in Madera County near Valley Children’s Hospital.\n\n“We’re working diligently to get one of them across the finish line,” team president Chris Wilson said. “The goal would be to build a 5,000-seat stadium in the (Selland parking lot.”\n\nThe Fresno City Council is taking the first step allowing for the sale of Convention Center land at its meeting on Thursday. The council will vote on declaring Selland Arena, Valdez Hall and the adjacent surface parking lot as surplus property.\n\nThe action would not include Saroyan Theatre, the new convention center, the parking garage or the Cosmopolitan Tavern and Italian Grill — which is at the corner of the Selland lot.\n\n“We’re working diligently to get one of them across the finish line … The goal would be to build a 5,000-seat stadium in the (Selland) parking lot.” — Fuego FC president Chris Wilson\n\nNew Owners and Big Plans for Fuego Club\n\nThe Fuego, with roots dating back to 2003, are returning as a professional team.\n\nThe owners are the Ruelas family, who own several local businesses that cater toward the Hispanic market.\n\n“The Central Valley is rich in tradition and talent and is a region that deserves professional soccer,” owner Juan Ruelas said in a news release. “The Fuego represent not only a brand of futbol but also a way of life. The people in this valley are bold, hardworking, and have an unparalleled burning desire to be great. We are proud of our diversity and deep roots. Dale Fuego!”\n\nThe team will sign and develop its own players, who could later transfer (through the sale of their contracts) to other teams.\n\n“One of our our main goals is local player development. We feel like we can field the team made up of of largely local players and compete at a high level in this league,” Wilson said.\n\nUSL 1 is considered a third-division league, equivalent to the Double-A level in minor league baseball. It currently operates with 11 teams, with planned expansion over the next few seasons.\n\nThe Fuego will also develop a new logo.\n\n“We’re inclusive that this is a community developed project. We’ve been spending the last six months taking advice from those who who built Fuego from the very beginning with hopes to have them help us elevate this to a new place where the Fuego never been before,” Wilson said.\n\nPlans also include adding a women’s team, an amateur team (which would play in USL 2) and a soccer academy.\n\nTony and Francisco Alvarez, who owned the Fuego team in the past, are helping advise the new version of the franchise.\n\nHousing Development Has First Crack at Selland Site\n\nState law requires affordable housing builders and other public entities to have the first right to purchase the Selland site. A law that went into effect last January, AB 1486, requires the city to notify state and local agencies, along with affordable housing developers, about the sale.\n\n“The state law outlines that we must first consider a use for housing must first be prioritized and any applicant wishes to build housing on the property,” Fresno City Council President Miguel Arias said.\n\nOther public entities would have a second shot at the property, before it can go to the private sector. Arias said the Fuego are the only private group to express interest thus far.\n\nIf the city decides to sell to the private sector, it does not necessarily have to go to the highest bidder.\n\n“We’re allowed under the law to be award it to the best fit,” Arias said, “whoever is going to do the best use for the property, for the city’s interest.”\n\nDyer Prefers Soccer\n\nMayor-elect Jerry Dyer wants soccer on the Selland land.\n\n“My preference is obviously to turn that into a entertainment hub for soccer. I believe the demand throughout the Valley is for us to have a soccer team downtown,” Dyer said.\n\nDyer envisions the Fuego turning the area into a “soccer magnet” for tournaments and development.\n\nArias isn’t committing yet as to what he prefers to see, either a soccer stadium or housing. He wants to see the “best return on investment” and a project in the “best interest” of downtown revitalization.\n\nDyer thinks there is plenty of land for housing in and around downtown.\n\n“I anticipate downtown housing to go from 3,000 to 10,000 residents. We’ve been working with some developers and investors to ensure that that does happen as well as Blackstone Avenue,” Dyer said.\n\nKelli Furtado, an executive with the Fresno Housing Authority, said that agency is “not evaluating the Selland Arena site for an affordable housing development.”\n\nBuilding a New Facility While Keeping Selland/Valdez Intact\n\nWilson, the Fuego’s president, said the team plans to build a modular stadium, with the Selland parking lot offering just the right amount of space. He compared it to the stadium of Phoenix Rising of the USL Championship league.\n\n“It’ll be a very similar look to that. (It won’t be) identical because it’s on a different footprint, but similar style — modular seating with a tip-down seating, VIP space, a supporter section and kind of a general admission section on each of the sides,” Wilson said.\n\nHe had no estimation on a cost, but said Phoenix spent $7.5 million to build its facility.\n\nThe team would keep Selland Arena and Valdez Hall standing, with improvements.\n\n“The ideal scenario would be to turn that area into a soccer hub — futsal courts, nightly indoor soccer spaces and utilize it on on a daily basis, not just game day. So we want to create activity there on that 365 days a year situation,” Wilson said.\n\nChukchansi Park Not an Option\n\nFresno lost its professional soccer team — Fresno FC, also known as the Foxes —following the 2019 season. The team played in the USL Championship league, at the Division II level (one step below Major Soccer League).\n\nOwner Ray Beshoff announced he was moving the team to Monterey, partly because the team could not find a permanent home in Fresno. However, the team stayed dark for the 2020 USL season.\n\nWilson said leasing Chukchansi Park — primarily home of the Fresno Grizzlies baseball team — did not make sense.\n\n“It’s pretty clear the writing’s on the wall that a professional team renting a facility for 17 days a year, 1) that doesn’t make any business sense; and 2) it doesn’t provide any place for development. With our main goal being local player development, we need a place to to utilize 365 days a year for training, development, camps, clinics, field usage,” Wilson said.\n\nEven without the Selland site, the team plans to move forward with building a soccer facility at the Madera County location. The stadium could be built there as well.\n\nRelated Story: Owner: Fresno Foxes Pro Soccer Team Is Folding\n\nCity Losing Money on Selland Arena\n\nSelland Arena was built by the city in 1966 with the Fresno State Bulldogs basketball team as its main tenant. When the Save Mart Center opened in 2003, the Bulldogs and many top concerts and sports acts moved to the new arena.\n\nThe city pays management company ASM Global $145,000 a year to take care of the properties that make up the Fresno Convention Center (Selland Arena, Valdez Hall, along with the Saroyan Theatre and Convention Center).\n\nIt still costs at least $1 million annually to operate.\n\n“Every year we’re losing revenue in the (facilities’) operations. The area has become far more dire with a complete shutdown,” Arias said.\n\nA Brief History of the Fuego\n\nThe prior incarnation of the Fuego operated as an amateur development team playing at Chukchansi Park and other Central Valley locations.\n\nThe team’s owners — which included the Alvarez brothers, the Marquez brothers and Chris Cummings, then owner of the Fresno Grizzlies, sold to Beshoff.\n\nThe team operated in 2018 as Fresno FC U-23, an amateur team.\n\nThe new Fuego, along with the USL, bought the club’s name back from Beshoff.\n\nClick Here to see the Original Article.\n\nIt’s official! The Fresno area will once again have a pro soccer team, that team will play in its own, soccer-specific stadium (anticipated to open in time for its first season in 2022!), and it will be called “Fuego FC.” As astonishing as that news is all by itself, the new team and stadium are just two components of a much grander vision that’s the brainchild of a local entrepreneur who immigrated to the US from Mexico, attended Dinuba High and Fresno State, and developed several successful local businesses. That man, Juan Ruelas, and his wife, Alicia, are setting out to develop a pipeline through which young Valley soccer talent will be able to progress all the way from youth soccer to the United Soccer Leagues, and perhaps even beyond, without ever needing to leave the Fresno area. There’s a LOT to unpack, so let’s get started.\n\nThe Return Of The Fuego\n\nThe loss of professional soccer in 2019 was a devastating blow to the Central Valley’s soccer community. Not only did Fresno FC’s demise bring an end to two years of high-level soccer in the Valley, it also meant the end of the long-standing Fresno Fuego men’s team, as well as the Fresno Freeze women’s team. The Fuego, Fresno FC’s wildly successful predecessor, had been incorporated into Fresno FC’s structure as part of the deal to bring the USL to Fresno. The Foxes’ owner, Ray Beshoff, took the rights to the Fuego with him when he left the Valley. Alas, much of the soccer community will be excited to learn that the Fuego name will be making a comeback.\n\nA Grand Vision\n\nThe idea that led to the Fuego’s “reboot” actually had its genesis in youth soccer. Geographically, Fresno sits close to the center of California. So, it would stand to reason that the greater Fresno area would be the perfect location to hold state-wide events like youth sports tournaments. However, there are very few regional or statewide youth tournaments that actually take place the Fresno area. Even more frustratingly, talented youth soccer players generally must travel outside of Valley to get the type of training they need to compete at a high level.\n\nJuan Ruelas, like many Valley parents, discovered this problem as his children, who grew up playing soccer, needed to travel long distances to compete in soccer tournaments and to find quality, high-level training facilities. At one point, Ruelas drove one of his children to San Jose twice per week to attend a soccer academy, but that experience gave him an idea.\n\nJuan and Alicia knew that the Central Valley had (and still has) a giant pool of talented young soccer players. What if, he reasoned, there was a top-tier soccer academy located in a Central Valley, so that youth didn’t need to travel 2-3 hours by car to attend one (or, even worse, forego attending one entirely)? And, what if that academy was co-located with facilities that had the ability to host statewide tournaments, capitalizing on Fresno’s central location? Thus, Juan and Alicia began forming a vision for a sort of soccer player’s fantasyland, one with acres of regulation sized soccer fields, multiple futsal courts, an indoor field, and an academy that would rival the best in the state.\n\nHowever, their vision did not stop there. Ultimately, the two wanted to provide Central Valley youth with a pipeline through which they could progress all the way from their very first soccer team to the USL and even MLS. In order to do that, they wanted to make sure that there was a professional team located in the Fresno area. Initially, they planned to partner with Fresno FC, but after things didn’t work out and Fresno FC ultimately left, Juan got in touch with some of Fresno FC’s former staff, including Chris Wilson, the former VP of Operations for the Foxes, who I sat down with last week to discuss the project. Ultimately, they were able to work out a deal with the USL to re-acquire the Fuego name and the rights to the Fresno area for USL soccer.\n\nInfrastructure, Infrastructure, Infrastructure\n\nAfter years of searching around the Fresno area, Juan and Alicia settled on a plot of land that’s located in Madera County near Children’s Hospital Central California. The location is close to the 41 freeway, making it only about a 5 minutes’ drive from Riverpark (where many area hotels are located) and 15 minutes from downtown. It’s also less than 10 minutes east of the 99 freeway (side note: hopefully this project will be the catalyst that finally gets Madera County to sign off on improving Avenue 9, which is a narrow country road that can be almost as busy as Herndon Avenue at times).\n\nAfter purchasing the land and having it zoned for the soccer park and academy, they began drawing up their plans. Much of the legwork has already been completed, and Fuego FC is currently in the process of obtaining the final necessary permits and completing the remaining environmental studies. They anticipate breaking ground on the fields and academy next year.\n\nThe most exciting part of the project for Valley soccer fans – the new soccer stadium – is also slated to break ground in 2021. While exact details for the stadium have yet to be finalized, Wilson did share some general information about the venue. He emphasized that nearly every aspect of the stadium is being designed with fans in mind and as a direct result of fan feedback. Most of the stadium’s approximately 5,000 seats will be located along one of the two sidelines, with standard “flip-up” stadium seating on one side, and bleachers on the other. “We wanted to provide an affordable option” said Wilson of the bleacher seats.\n\nSupporter group seating will be behind the goals, and will be able to accommodate all four of the current groups. There will be a few premium suites with associated VIP amenities too. Wilson also hinted about partnerships with local breweries, pubs, and restaurants, both as concession options, as well as potential locations for pre- and post- match festivities.\n\nLate last week, news leaked that the Fuego and the City of Fresno were in negotiations for part of the Fresno Convention Center complex. According to its agenda, the city council is set to declare Selland Arena, Valdez Hall (the old “exhibit hall”), and the associated surface level parking lot as “surplus properties” during this week’s meeting. That would presumably clear the way for the Fuego to bid on the property.\n\nHowever, there’s been no indications that a deal is anywhere near finalized, and quite a few hurdles need to be cleared for Fuego FC to even acquire the land, should they ultimately choose to. There’s also no evidence that Selland Arena needs to be torn down to make way for a stadium (side note: both the Fresno Monsters hockey team and Fresno Fire basketball team have expressed interest in playing at least some of their games in Selland). As some might recall, Fresno FC attempted to build their stadium on that same piece of land, but ran into problems related to the Cosmopolitan’s parking lot. The Cosmopolitan is still open, so it’s unclear how that problem would be resolved. It does, however, appear that the City of Fresno is significantly more enthusiastic this time around about keeping soccer downtown.\n\nAnother possible option for the stadium would be building it in Madera County alongside the rest of the soccer academy facilities. Stay tuned for more information about the stadium’s location in the coming weeks and months as plans are finalized.\n\nUSL League One\n\nThe Central Valley Fuego, as the team will be known, will begin play in USL League One in 2022. League One is the third league of soccer in the United States, below MLS and USL Championship, but still fully professional. Fans of the original Fuego will likely recognize at least one team – FC Tucson – which also used to be in the “PDL” league and regularly faced the Fuego. It is likely that Tucson will (at least initially) be Fresno’s main rival in USL One, although there are rumors of other potential new California teams as well.\n\nOther teams in League One include Madison, a franchise that’s well known across the US soccer pyramid for their flashy social media presence and off the wall but popular promotions (ranging from a “pool party night” where they gave away hard seltzer and inflatable flamingos; to a “bro pack” that included a tank top, aviator sunglasses, and a can of natural light; to a Vatican-style release of “pink smoke” when they chose a new head coach), as well as Omaha, Richmond (Virginia), and Ft Lauderdale. “We’re going to be traveling more than some NFL teams” said Wilson of the spread-out league…aside from Fresno and Tucson, every other team is east of the Rockies.\n\nA Lofty Vision\n\nFrom all appearances, the new Fuego FC organization (which will officially be named the “Central Valley Fuego Fútbol Club”) are making all the right moves to ensure the long-term success of their soccer academy and their team. Already, their front office has organized multiple behind-the-scenes focus groups comprised of former Fresno Fuego and Fresno FC employees and organizers, supporter group leaders, and other Valley soccer enthusiasts. They’ve taken what they have learned from those interactions and their own experiences (remember, many of the people behind the new Fuego team had a hand in the original Fuego and/or the Foxes), and put together what they believe is a winning formula:\n\nFuego FC will be a continuation of the original Fresno Fuego, a popular and successful brand that still has major appeal around the Valley.\n\nThe organization will be “unapologetically bilingual,” with English and Spanish equally represented and interwoven together.\n\nThe organization will build a presence throughout the Valley, not just in the Fresno area. This will include everything from running clinics and player appearances, to offering academy scholarships and free tickets, to helping fund the construction of facilities like futsal courts.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, their process will be designed to take youth soccer players, give them a pipeline through which they can progress and grow their talents, and then use that pipeline to fill the Fuego’s roster. Eventually, the goal is for the majority of the Fuego’s professional players to be from the Valley.\n\nIncorporating the above components, Juan and Alicia Ruelas (and the rest of the organization) came up with a five-year plan comprised of four major goals that they believe are 100% attainable:\n\nTo have the best team in USL League One, with multiple local players on the roster.\n\nTo have a soccer academy that is recognized and competes on a national level.\n\nTo bring back a USL League Two team (formerly the PDL) as another stepping stone to the Fuego.\n\nTo bring back a women’s team.\n\nEventually, Juan and Alicia would like to bring USL Championship back to Fresno, and they believe that such a goal is attainable with enough fan support. “We need people to come to games,” said Wilson about the possibility of anything beyond USL League One. The Foxes averaged just over 4,100 fans per game in 2019, an attendance number that would have made them second among all USL League One teams, but put them just below half of their fellow Championship teams. In order to make advancing beyond League One practical, that number would likely need to grow.\n\nHowever, with enough support, anything is possible. While still a decade or more away, Ruelas is hopeful that his vision will help lay the groundwork for the Fresno area to one day be in the running for an MLS team, and he thinks such an opportunity could come along with enough support and should the region’s population grow fast enough.\n\nWrapping It All Up\n\nOne can’t help but be impressed with everything that the Ruelas family is doing to bring a first-rate youth soccer academy and professional soccer team and stadium to the Central Valley. Every aspect of the project, from the soccer complex and stadium to the team itself, is being 100% privately financed, mostly by he and his wife, with no public money going towards the academy or stadium.\n\nWhile the Ruelas family and Fuego FC are not asking for a single penny of public funding, they ARE asking the Valley for its support. That’s where everyone reading this article comes in. After news about the convention center land broke last week, I read dozens of comments online showing support for the new Fuego team, many asking “what can I do to help?” To that I say: buy tickets (you can already put down a deposit on season tickets) and merchandise, bring your friends and family, share your passion for soccer and for the Fuego with others, join a supporter group, get your kids involved in the academy, and, in general, show the world that the Valley is 100% behind this project.\n\nAfter a year without a local team to root for, the Valley’s supporter groups are definitely ready to get behind the Fuego. “Fire Squad is extremely excited about the announcement of the Fuego, the connection to the history of football in our area and the development of this franchise for all the valley, from youth to professional level. We can’t wait to join together as supporters and root for a team that truly represents us all. Dale Fuego!” said Ed Stewart, head of Fire Squad Fresno. Another member’s comment, while simple, may have put it best: “let’s gooooooooo!”\n\nClick Here to see the Original Article."
