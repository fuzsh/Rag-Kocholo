        "text": "Impact of global change on ground subsidence related to aquifer exploitation. The case of the Vega de Granada aquifer (SE Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPulido-Velazquez, David; MarÃ­a Mateos, Rosa; Rueda, Ramon; Pegalajar-Cuellar, Manuel; Ezquerro, Pablo; BÃ©jar, Marta; Herrera, Gerardo; Collados-Lara, Antonio-Juan\n\n2017-04-01\n\nbetter explains the relationship between subsidence, hydraulic changes and the remaining independent variables. This methodology has been applied to the Vega de Granada aquifer system (Granada, SE Spain). The Vega de Granada detrital aquifer (with an extension of 200 km2) is one of the largest groundwater reservoirs in Andalusia and it is considered as strategic for the economy of this semi-arid region. Ground motion was monitored by exploiting SAR images from ENVISAT (2003-2009), Cosmo-SkyMed (2011-2014) and Sentinel-1A (2015-2016). PSInSAR results show an inelastic deformation in the aquifer and land surface displacements values up to -55 mm. The most widespread land subsidence is detected for the ENVISAT period (2003-2009), which coincided with a dry, long period in the region. The highest recorded data accounts up to 10 mm/yr in surface displacement velocity, which were detected in the central part of the aquifer, where many villages are located. For this period, a good correlation between groundwater level depletion and the augmentation of the subsidence average velocity is obtained, and light hydraulic head changes (< 2 m) have a rapid ground motion response. This research will contribute to assess a sustainable management plan of this vital aquifer, taking into account critical levels of groundwater level depletion to avoid land subsidence on the identified vulnerable areas and during drought critical scenarios. This research has been supported by the CGL2013-48424-C2-2-R (MINECO) project.\n\nCategorical Indicator Kriging for assessing the risk of groundwater nitrate pollution: the case of Vega de Granada aquifer (SE Spain).\n\nPubMed\n\nChica-Olmo, Mario; Luque-Espinar, Juan Antonio; Rodriguez-Galiano, Victor; Pardo-IgÃºzquiza, Eulogio; Chica-Rivas, LucÃ­a\n\n2014-02-01\n\nGroundwater nitrate pollution associated with agricultural activity is an important environmental problem in the management of this natural resource, as acknowledged by the European Water Framework Directive. Therefore, specific measures aimed to control the risk of water pollution by nitrates must be implemented to minimise its impact on the environment and potential risk to human health. The spatial probability distribution of nitrate contents exceeding a threshold or limit value, established within the quality standard, will be helpful to managers and decision-makers. A methodology based on non-parametric and non-linear methods of Indicator Kriging was used in the elaboration of a nitrate pollution categorical map for the aquifer of Vega de Granada (SE Spain). The map has been obtained from the local estimation of the probability that a nitrate content in an unsampled location belongs to one of the three categories established by the European Water Framework Directive: CL. 1 good quality [Min - 37.5 ppm], CL. 2 intermediate quality [37.5-50 ppm] and CL. 3 poor quality [50 ppm - Max]. The obtained results show that the areas exceeding nitrate concentrations of 50 ppm, poor quality waters, occupy more than 50% of the aquifer area. A great proportion of the area's municipalities are located in these poor quality water areas. The intermediate quality and good quality areas correspond to 21% and 28%, respectively, but with the highest population density. These results are coherent with the experimental data, which show an average nitrate concentration value of 72 ppm, significantly higher than the quality standard limit of 50 ppm. Consequently, the results suggest the importance of planning actions in order to control and monitor aquifer nitrate pollution.

Up-to-date information about the epidemiology of this disorder is key to health care planning. The aim of our study is to report prevalence and correlates of current major depressive disorder (MDD) in the province of Granada, Southern Spain. The GranadÎ£p is a cross-sectional study based on a community-dwelling adult population living in the province of Granada, Southern Spain. Community-dwelling adults aged 18-80âyears ( nâ=â810) were interviewed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). A variety of exposure assessments were also undertaken. Point (2âweeks) prevalence of MDD in the Granada population was 5.6%. Positive family history of mental illness, high degree of neuroticism, high number of life threatening events (LTE), poor physical health status, cognitive impairment and cannabis use were independently associated with MDD in the multivariate regression model. Being female was also associated with MDD, but the significance disappeared after adjusting for neuroticism and physical health. Prevalence of MDD in the Granada population is higher than expected. The effects of the financial crisis could be partially accountable for this excess in prevalence. Six variables were found to be independently associated with MDD. Association between female sex and depression may be partially explained by the confounding effect of neuroticism.\n\nWord-initial rhotic clusters in Spanish-speaking preschoolers in Chile and Granada, Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nPerez, Denisse; Vivar, Pilar; Bernhardt, Barbara May; Mendoza, Elvira; Ãvila, Carmen; Carballo, Gloria; Fresneda, Dolores; MuÃ±oz, Juana; Vergara, Patricio\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe current paper describes Spanish acquisition of rhotic onset clusters. Data are also provided on related singleton taps/trills and /l/ as a singleton and in clusters. Participants included 9 typically developing (TD) toddlers and 30 TD preschoolers in Chile, and 30 TD preschoolers and 29 with protracted phonological development (PPD) in Granada, Spain. Results showed age and developmental group effects. Preservation of cluster timing units preceded segmental accuracy, especially in stressed syllables. Tap clusters versus singleton trills were variable in order of mastery, some children mastering clusters first, and others, the trill. Rhotics were acquired later than /l/. In early development, mismatches (errors) involved primarily deletion of taps; where substitutions occurred, [j] frequently replaced tap. In later development, [l] more frequently replaced tap; where taps did occur, vowel epenthesis sometimes occurred. The data serve as a criterion reference database for onset cluster acquisition in Chilean and Granada Spanish.\n\nEpidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease in the Province of Granada, Spain: a retrospective study from 1979 to 1988.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMartÃ­nez-Salmeron, J F; Rodrigo, M; de Teresa, J; Nogueras, F; GarcÃ­a-Montero, M; de Sola, C; Salmeron, J; Caballero, M\n\n1993-01-01\n\nAn epidemiological study of inflammatory bowel disease in the Province of Granada, Spain, was conducted between 1979 and 1988. Altogether, 257 cases were identified: 167 ulcerative colitis, 79 Crohn's disease, and 11 indeterminate colitis. The mean incidence of ulcerative colitis in the 10 year period was 2/10(5) and 0.9/10(5) for Crohn's disease. This is the first epidemiological study in Spain of the incidence of ulcerative colitis and corroborates the results of an earlier population based study on the incidence of Crohn's disease in Spain.

Ground motion was monitored by exploiting SAR images from the ENVISAT (2003-2009), Cosmo-SkyMed (2011-2014) and Sentinel-1A (2015-2016) satellites. PSInSAR results show an inelastic deformation in the aquifer and small land surface displacements (up to -55 mm). The most widespread land subsidence is detected during the ENVISAT period (2003-2009), which coincided with a long, dry period in the region. The highest displacement rates recorded during this period (up to 10 mm/yr) were detected in the central part of the aquifer, where many villages are located. For this period, there is a good correlation between groundwater level depletion and the augmentation of the average subsidence velocity and slight hydraulic head changes (<2 m) have a rapid ground motion response. The Cosmo-SkyMed period (2011-2014) coincided with a rainy period, and the land subsidence is only concentrated in some points. Rates of average subsidence up to 11.5 mm/yr are obtained for this period and are anthropogenic in origin, being related to earthmoving works. During the Sentinel-1A monitoring period (2015-2016) most of the region showed no deformation, except for some points of unknown origin in the NE sector. A general conclusion is that there is a clear lithological control in the spatial distribution of ground subsidence; all the subsiding areas detected are located where a higher clay content was identified. Although the SE sector of the aquifer had more intense groundwater exploitation, no land subsidence processes were detected, as coarse-grained sediments predominate in the substratum. This research will contribute to the drawing-up of a management plan for the sustainable use of this strategic aquifer, taking into account critical levels of\n\nDo \"gitano\" Students Feel Discriminated against in Their Social and Academic Surroundings?

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of hepatitis A virus in molluscs. Standard and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction procedures were used to monitor bivalve molluscs from the Granada fish markets (southern Spain) for this human enteric virus. Between February 2009 and October 2010, we collected a total of 329 samples of different types of bivalve molluscs (mussels, smooth clams, striped venus, and grooved clams). The results showed the presence of hepatitis A virus in 8.5% of the 329 samples analyzed. We can therefore confirm that conventional fecal indicators are unreliable for demonstrating the presence or absence of viruses. The presence of hepatitis A virus in molluscs destined for human consumption is a potential health risk in southern Spain.\n\nSeasonal occurrence and distribution of a group of ECs in the water resources of Granada city metropolitan areas (South of Spain): Pollution of raw drinking water\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLuque-Espinar, Juan Antonio; Navas, Natalia; Chica-Olmo, Mario; Cantarero-MalagÃ³n, Samuel; Chica-Rivas, LucÃ­a\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThis piece of research deals with the monitoring of a group of emerging contaminants (ECs) in the metropolitan area of Granada, a city representative of the South of Spain, in order to evaluate the environmental management of the wastewater system. With that aim, the spatial and seasonal occurrence and distribution of a group of ECs in groundwater, surface and irrigation water resources from the aquifer \"Vega de Granada\" (VG) have been investigated for the first time. A set of the most prescribed drugs in Spain (ibuprofen, loratadine, pantoprazole and paracetamol), a pesticide widely used in agriculture (atrazine) and a typical anthropogenic contaminant (caffeine) were included in the study. Water samples were taken from the metropolitan area of the city of Granada inside of the zone of the aquifer, from the downstream of two waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and from the two main irrigation channels where surface and wastewater are mixed before distribution for irrigation purposes in the crops of the study area. A total of 153 water samples were analyzed through liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) throughout the study that took place over a period of two years, from July 2011 to July 2013. Results demonstrated the occurrence of four of the six target pollutants. Ibuprofen was detected several times, always in both channels with concentration ranges from 5.3 to 20.8 Î¼g/L. The occurrence of paracetamol was detected in rivers and channels up to 34.3 Î¼g/L. Caffeine was detected in all the water resources up to 39.3 Î¼g/L. Pantoprazole was detected twice in the surface water source near to a WWPT ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 Î¼g/L. The pesticide atrazine and the drug loratadine were not detected in any of the water samples analyzed. These results show evidence of poor environmental management of the wastewater concerning the water quality of the aquifer studied. The groundwater sources seem to receive a very continuous input of wastewater\n\nImmunospecificity of albumin detected in 1.6 million-year-old fossils from Venta Micena in Orce, Granada, Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nBorja, C; GarcÃ­a-Pacheco, M; Olivares, E G; Scheuenstuhl, G; Lowenstein, J M\n\n1997-08-01\n\nThe Orce skull fragment from southern Spain, dated at 1.6 Myr, has been a subject of heated controversy since it was first discovered in 1982. If it is hominid, as its discoverers contend, it is by far the oldest fossil hominid yet found in western Europe and implies that human populations settled this region much earlier than was previously realized. Numerous stone artifacts found at the Orce sites provide evidence that hominids were indeed present there in the Lower Pleistocene. Some paleontologists maintain that the 8 cm diameter occipital fragment is from a horse, not a hominid. Two independent investigations of the residual proteins in the skull were undertaken, one at the University of Granada in Spain, the other at the University of California, San Francisco. Two immunological methods of comparable sensitivity were employed for detection and species attribution of protein extracted from fossil bone: the Granada team used an enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the UCSF team used a radioimmunoassay (RIA). Both teams obtained reactions characteristic of human albumin in the Orce skull and horse albumin in some of the horse fossils. These results support the lithic evidence that hominids were living in Andalusia 1.6 million years ago.\n\nAn index to quantify street cleanliness: the case of Granada (Spain).\n\nPubMed\n\nSevilla, Aitana; RodrÃ­guez, Miguel Luis; GarcÃ­a-Maraver, Angela; Zamorano, Montserrat\n\n2013-05-01\n\nUrban surfaces receive waste deposits from natural and human sources, which create a negative visual impact and are identified as potentially significant contributors to water and air pollution. Local councils are usually responsible for the sweep of roads and footpaths to keep the environment clean and free of litter. Quality controls are useful in order to check whether the services are being executed according to the quantity, quality and performance standards that are provided. In this sense, several factors might affect the efficiency of the management of cleaning and waste collection services; however, only a few contributions are available in the literature on the various aspects associated with the level of street cleanliness. In this paper, the suitability of a Cleanliness Index has been checked, for the case of Granada (South of Spain), in order to contribute to the proper management of public expenditure, improving the quality and cost of an essential service for any municipality. Results have concluded that the city exhibits a good level of cleanliness, although the standard of cleaning varied from one area of the city to another. The Cleaning Index fits well to the general situation of the different districts of Granada and thus, it could be considered a useful tool for measuring the level of cleanliness of the streets of the city and for evaluating the organization of the cleaning service, such that an outsourced company would not be responsible for controlling all the cleaning services.

During this period up to 210 collocated meteorological balloons, equipped with a radiosonde DFM-09 (GRAWMET), were launched. This study is carried out with a twofold goal. On one hand, a validation of the MWR products such as temperature and water vapor mixing ratio profiles and the IWV from MWR is carried out comparing with radiosonde measurements. The behavior of MWR retrievals under clear and cloudy conditions and for special situations such as inversions has been analyzed. On the other hand, the whole period with continuous measurements is used for a statistical evaluation of the meteorological variables derived from MWR in order to thermodynamically characterize the atmosphere over Granada.\n\n[Analysis of the nutritional state of school children in different districts of the province of Granada (Spain)].\n\nPubMed\n\nGonzÃ¡lez-JimÃ©nez, E; GarcÃ­a LÃ³pez, P A; Schmidt RÃ­o-Valle, J\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn Spain the prevalence of obesity shows a north-south distribution. In the province of Granada its distribution is unknown. (1) To study the prevalence of overweight and obesity in a sample population of school children and adolescents from different districts in the province of Granada. (2) To verify whether there are significant differences, depending on the district where the students reside. (3) To find a possible correlation between the nutritional state of the students and that of their parents. The population sample was composed of 977 school children and adolescents from 9 to 17 years of age, attending 13 public elementary schools and high schools in the city and province of Granada (Spain). In this analytical and multicentric study, the nutritional state of the subjects was evaluated by means of anthropometric measurements. Furthermore, data were collected by means of questionnaire to discover whether the respondents had a family history of overweight or obesity. We found a high prevalence of overweight and obesity among the studied population. In girls, the greater prevalence of both overweight and obesity ranged from 12 to 14 years of age. In boys, there was an increase in the prevalence of overweight at twelve years of age. Regarding obesity, their rates were significantly lower than those described among girls. There were statistically significant differences for weight (F = 4,154; p = 0,003) but not for height (F = 1,928; p =0,105). But for the variable BMI was statistically significant difference (F = 5.037; P < 0.001) between the studied geographical areas. The results showed that the nutritional state of students with a family history of obesity was significantly worse (p < 0.01). A high prevalence of obesity was found in the sample, especially among the girls. There exists a geographical distribution pattern, possibly derived from the socioeconomic characteristics of each area in the province. The existence of a family history of obesity is an\n\nSierra Nevada serpentinites. An important element in the architectonic heritage of Granada (Spain).\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNavarro, Rafael; Pereira, Dolores; RodrÃ­guez-Navarro, Carlos; SebastiÃ¡n-Pardo, Eduardo\n\n2013-04-01\n\nSerpentinites are widely used in historic buildings in the whole world, from Ancient Greek or Egypt to more recent colonial buildings in the USA. Serpentinites from Sierra Nevada (S of Spain) have been traditionally used as ornamental elements in historic buildings of Granada city, both indoors and outdoors. The Cathedral, Carlos V Palace, Royal Chancery and some others are good examples of their use. Some other important cases can be found outside Granada, like El Escorial monastery, Las Salesas Reales convent, etcâ¦ all of them part of Madrid architectonic heritage. There are two quarries located in Sierra Nevada that supplied all the material to make the different elements in the cited buildings. In this work, a thorough characterization of the main serpentinites from Sierra Nevada, their uses, and their state of conservation in selected buildings from Granada has been performed. Samples from the main original quarry and from one historical building (Real ChancillerÃ­a) have been analysed, determining the mineralogical and geochemical composition, texture, water parameters (absorption, porosity, density) and possible alteration by salt formation. It has been observed that the mineralogical and geochemical compositions are similar in both sets of samples, although the ones coming from the historical building show a highly advanced state of alteration. Regarding physical and mechanical parameters, samples from the quarry have very low water absorption values, while the porosity of serpentinites sampled from the Real ChancillerÃ­a is comparatively much higher. We explain this difference as due to the weathering of the emplaced serpentinites by salt crystallization processes (mainly gypsum or epsomite), that generate strong internal pressures causing the disintegration of the whole natural stone. In addition, the increase of the porosity can be caused by dissolution processes related to the presence of acid solutions related to oxidation and hydrolysis of iron\n\nThe Eastern delta-fan deposits on the Granada Basin as tectonic indicators of the Sierra Nevada uplift (Betic Cordillera, South Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoldÃ¡n, Francisco Javier; AzaÃ±on, Jose Miguel; Mateos, Rosa Maria\n\n2014-05-01\n\nA geological mapping in detail of the Eastern sector of the Granada Basin (South Spain) reveals two different groups of Gilbert delta-fans related to the Sierra Nevada uplift. The first group, in the southern part and with a surface of 6 km2, has three major coarsening-upward sequences. They are composed of very coarse deposits, those of conglomerates, sands and silts. Progradational strata units to the basin have been observed. The dominantly fluvial facies association has locally developed shallow marine foreset deposits (partially with reef colonization) as well as topset red soils (Dabrio, et al., 1978; Braga et a., 1990; GarcÃ­a-GarcÃ­a, et al., 1999) . All the sequences are discordant over marine facies (calcarenites) dated over 8,26 Ma (Late Tortonian). The second group, in the northern part and with an extension of 12 km2, has similar characteristics, but some of the boulders have ostreids and lamellibranchs species which reveal their former position in a previous marine environment. The Sierra Nevada uplift caused the remobilization of these boulders, being transported by debris-flow inside the delta-fan bodies (GarcÃ­a-GarcÃ­a, et al., 2006). The dating of ostreids shells with Sr techniques reveals ages over 7,13, 6,61 and 5,45 Ma, from the lower to the upper delta-fan deposits, which are related to the three main sequences observed and with three major tectonic pulses during the Late Miocene. These interpretations are in agreement with apatite fision-track studies carried out in some boulders of these coarse delta-fan deposits (Clark and Dempster, 2013). They reveal a detailed record of Neogene denudation from the Sierra Nevada basement and with uplift periods between 5,45Ma- 2 Ma. The latest pulses affected the delta-fan sediments given rise to new fan systems in the Granada Basin (Alhambra Formation).

The information was gathered through semi-structured open interviews of a total of 42 people, as a part of an in-deep ethnobiological research in 16 different municipalities within the study area. The use-value index was calculated for highlighting the most important species for the population. In this part of Granada, 26 different animals have been employed in the treatment of 26 conditions from 10 different pathological groups, amounting 150 total reports (7% of the total ones including plant and animal medicinal resources). Although some of the uses were included in several classical and anthropological works, most remain unpublished. Cultural and environmental implications are discussed. The traditional use of animals in medicine is low known for southern Europe. 26 species constitute a significant number of animals used, considering the socio-economic and cultural context in which the study area is situated, and its small size. Albeit the main part of the information presented in this paper can be more important in an historical or anthropological standpoint, most of the medicinal resources presented have not been deeply studied.

A.; Alados-Arboledas, L.; Wolfran, E.; Olmo, F. J.\n\n2012-11-01\n\nCloud cover usually attenuates the ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation but, under certain sky conditions, the clouds may produce an enhancement effect increasing the UV levels at surface. The main objective of this paper is to analyze an extreme UV enhancement episode recorded on 16 June 2009 at Granada (southeastern Spain). This phenomenon was characterized by a quick and intense increase in surface UV radiation under broken cloud fields (5-7 oktas) in which the Sun was surrounded by cumulus clouds (confirmed with sky images). Thus, the UV index (UVI) showed an enhancement of a factor 4 in the course of only 30 min around midday, varying from 2.6 to 10.4 (higher than the corresponding clear-sky UVI value). Additionally, the UVI presented values higher than 10 (extreme erythemal risk) for about 20 min running, with a maximum value around 11.5. The use of an empirical model and the total ozone column (TOC) derived from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) for the period 1995-2011 showed that the value of UVI ~ 11.5 is substantially larger than the highest index that could origin the natural TOC variations over Granada. Finally, the UV erythemal dose accumulated during the period of 20 min with the extreme UVI values under broken cloud fields was 350 J/m2 which surpass the energy required to produce sunburn of the most human skin types.\n\nGranada virus: a natural phlebovirus reassortant of the sandfly fever Naples serocomplex with low seroprevalence in humans.\n\nPubMed\n\nCollao, Ximena; Palacios, Gustavo; de Ory, Fernando; Sanbonmatsu, Sara; PÃ©rez-Ruiz, Mercedes; Navarro, JosÃ© MarÃ­a; Molina, Ricardo; Hutchison, Stephen K; Lipkin, W Ian; Tenorio, Antonio; SÃ¡nchez-Seco, MarÃ­a Paz\n\n2010-10-01\n\nA new member of the phlebovirus genus, tentatively named Granada virus, was detected in sandflies collected in Spain.

In order to properly manage and control waste production in industry, one must know the quantity, type, and composition of industrial wastes, as well as the management practices of the companies involved. In our study, questionnaires were used to collect data regarding methods of waste management used in 170 of the 230 businesses in the area of study. The majority of these companies in ASEGRA are small or medium-size, and belong to the service sector, transport, and distribution. This was naturally a conditioning factor in both themoreÂ Â» type and management of the wastes generated. It was observed that paper and cardboard, plastic, wood, and metals were the most common types of waste, mainly generated from packaging (49% of the total volume), as well as material used in containers and for wrapping products. Serious problems were observed in the management of these wastes. In most cases they were disposed of by dumping, and very rarely did businesses resort to reuse, recycling or valorization. Smaller companies encountered greater difficulties when it came to effective waste management. The most frequent solution for the disposal of wastes in the area was dumping.Â«Â less\n\nAtmospheric composition and micro-climate in the Alhambra monument, Granada (Spain), in the context of preventive conservation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoremans, B.; Schalm, O.; De Wael, K.; Cardell, C.; Van Grieken, R.\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThe world famous Alhambra monument in Granada, Southern Spain, listed as UNESCO world cultural heritage since 1984, represents probably the most beautiful example of Islamic art and architecture from the Middle Ages in Europe. It is visited by ca. 2 million people annually. Granada is situated in a natural basin, surrounded by mountains with altitudes up to 3500 m. Due to this topography and the prevailing low wind speeds, pollution-derived and especially traffic-derived particulate matter often accumulates in the urban air. In order to evaluate the potential conservation risks from the surrounding air, the atmospheric composition in the Alhambra monument was evaluated. Indoor temperature and relative humidity fluctuations were evaluated for their potential degenerative effects. Furthermore, the atmospheric composition in the Alhambra was analyzed in terms of inorganic gases (NO2, SO2, O3, and NH3) and black carbon. It was found that the open architecture protected the indoor environments from developing a potentially harmful microclimate, such as the build-up of humidity resulting from the huge number of daily tourists. On the downside, the strong ventilation made the indoor air hardly different from outdoor air, as characterized by strong diurnal temperature and relative humidity gradients and high traffic-derived pollutant levels.\n\nPalace of the Earl of Padul, Granada, Spain. A Milestone in a Crossroad\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLafuente-BolÃ­var, Francisco Javier; Santiago-Zaragoza, Juan Manuel; MarÃ­a Cruz-Valdivieso, Ana\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe Palace of the Counts of Padul is the most emblematic building of Padul, Province of Granada in Spain, being one of the most remarkable buildings of the region of the Valley of LecrÃ­n. It is a building of undoubted historical value. It is classified as one of Cultural Interest, which means maximum level of protection of the Spanish legislation in historical heritage. In spite of being a historical symbol of Padul, most of the citizens ignore its importance. It was built in the first part of the XVII century. D. Antonio de ArÃ³stegui y Zazo (knight of the Santiago order and a secretary of Felipe III) was its developer. He gave the building a noble character with an unusual design for this shire. The ground floor has an L shape. Besides, it has two floors and two squared towers, and standing out there is a third floor covered by a pitched roof. Also, it has load-bearing walls of masonry. Only the corners are built with carved stones. Deck is built with logs, and bricks, and wooden roof trusses. It looks like a solid simple house of civil architecture at the beginning of the Baroque style. Analyzing the urban morphology of Padul, the uniqueness of the plot is important related to the urban fabric. It is also remarkable its strategic position with respect to the historical roads that crossed there: The royal road that came from Granada heading to the Alpujarras, and leading to Motril and the road that starting in Malaga crossed through Alhama and arrived in Padul. It is clear the function of controlling the necessary passage towards the Lecrin Valley, the Alpujarras and the Mediterranean coast. Immediately after its declaration in 1981 as a National Monument, and despite this, it suffered an unfortunate intervention which has been maintained until today. The council of Padul would like to acquire it presenting a project for its recovery. This situation provoked the invitation of the council to the University of Granada to help with that. And this would allow the\n\nColorimetric and spectroradiometric characteristics of narrow-field-of-view clear skylight in Granada, Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nHernÃ¡ndez-AndrÃ©s, J; Romero, J; Lee, R L\n\n2001-02-01\n\nAs part of our ongoing research into the clear daytime sky's visible structure, we analyze over 1,500 skylight spectra measured during a seven-month period in Granada, Spain. We use spectral radiances measured within 3 degrees fields of view (FOV's) to define colorimetric characteristics along four sky meridians: the solar meridian and three meridians at azimuths of 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and 315 degrees relative to it. The resulting clear-sky chromaticities in 44 different view directions (1) are close to but do not coincide with the CIE daylight locus, (2) form V-shaped meridional chromaticity curves along it (as expected from theory), and (3) have correlated color temperatures (CCT's) ranging from 3,800 K to infinity K. We also routinely observe that sky color and luminance are asymmetric about the solar meridian, usually perceptibly so. A principal-components analysis shows that three vectors are required for accurate clear-sky colorimetry, whereas six are needed for spectral analyses.\n\nFatty acid and sn-2 fatty acid composition in human milk from Granada (Spain) and in infant formulas.\n\nPubMed\n\nLÃ³pez-LÃ³pez, A; LÃ³pez-Sabater, M C; Campoy-Folgoso, C; Rivero-Urgell, M; Castellote-BargallÃ³, A I\n\n2002-12-01\n\nTo investigate differences in fatty acid and sn-2 fatty acid composition in colostrum, transitional and mature human milk, and in term infant formulas. Departament de NutriciÃ³ i Bromatologia, University of Barcelona, Spain and University Hospital of Granada, Spain. One-hundred and twenty mothers and 11 available types of infant formulas for term infants. We analysed the fatty acid composition of colostrum (n=40), transitional milk (n=40), mature milk (n=40) and 11 infant formulas. We also analysed the fatty acid composition at sn-2 position in colostrum (n=12), transitional milk (n=12), mature milk (n=12), and the 11 infant formulas. Human milk in Spain had low saturated fatty acids, high monounsaturated fatty acids and high linolenic acid. Infant formulas and mature human milk had similar fatty acid composition. In mature milk, palmitic acid was preferentially esterified at the sn-2 position (86.25%), and oleic and linoleic acids were predominantly esterified at the sn-1,3 positions (12.22 and 22.27%, respectively, in the sn-2 position). In infant formulas, palmitic acid was preferentially esterified at the sn-1,3 positions and oleic and linoleic acids had higher percentages at the sn-2 position than they do in human milk. Fatty acid composition of human milk in Spain seems to reflect the Mediterranean dietary habits of mothers. Infant formulas resemble the fatty acid profile of human milk, but the distribution of fatty acids at the sn-2 position is markedly different.\n\nA principal component regression model to forecast airborne concentration of Cupressaceae pollen in the city of Granada (SE Spain), during 1995-2006.\n\nPubMed\n\nOcaÃ±a-Peinado, Francisco M; Valderrama, Mariano J; Bouzas, Paula R\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe problem of developing a 2-week-on ahead forecast of atmospheric cypress pollen levels is tackled in this paper by developing a principal component multiple regression model involving several climatic variables. The efficacy of the proposed model is validated by means of an application to real data of Cupressaceae pollen concentration in the city of Granada (southeast of Spain). The model was applied to data from 11 consecutive years (1995-2005), with 2006 being used to validate the forecasts. Based on the work of different authors, factors as temperature, humidity, hours of sun and wind speed were incorporated in the model. This methodology explains approximately 75-80% of the variability in the airborne Cupressaceae pollen concentration.\n\nSpain: NATO or Neutrality,\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1980-04-01\n\nhaving Spain as a member.

A total of 1,414 healthy schoolchildren were examined using modified DDE criteria for recording enamel defects. The prevalence of DDE of any type was 40.2% in primary dentition and 52% in permanent dentition (p<0.033). Of the 31,820 primary and permanent teeth examined in the study, 699 (4.1%) primary and 1,232 (8.3%) permanent teeth had some form of DDE. Diffuse opacity was the most common type of DDE observed in primary teeth, and demarcated opacity in the permanent teeth. Enamel hypoplasia was the least prevalent defect in both dentition types. The study population showed a high prevalence of DDE in primary as well as in permanent dentition, reflecting the current increasing trend of this condition, which should be considered as a significant public health problem.\n\nSocial Justice Practices on Gender, Race, and Environment within a School in Granada\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSoza Vergara, Ximena; Hartlep, Nicholas Daniel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this article we discuss the experience of the Institute IlÃ­beris, a public high school in a small town in Granada, Spain, that has been engaged in innovative ways of teaching.

A total of 984 faecal samples and 41 samples of blood were collected from Psittacidae, Cacatuidae, Phasianidae, and Anatidae. One or more intestinal parasites were identified in 51.6% of the samples. Blood parasites were found in 26.8% of the birds examined. The most frequent pathogenic endoparasites were coccidians, such as Cyclospora sp. (4.5%), Eimeria sp. (4.1%) and Isospora sp. (2%) and helminths such as Capillaria sp. (10. 1%), Ascaridia sp. (4.9%) and Heterakis gallinarum (4.9%). All the parasites varied with season but the most were found year round. Multiple parasitic infections by intestinal parasites were common, with 196 of 984 faecal samples having 2-5 intestinal parasites. The most frequent cases of multiple parasitism were Blastocystis plus Entamoeba sp. and Blastocystis plus Cyclospora sp. The haematic protozoa detected were Haemoproteus sp. (17%) and Plasmodium sp. (7.3%). Multiple parasitism by Haemoproteus sp. and Plasmodium sp. was detected in 1 sample of Gallus gallus. After each sampling, some of the affected animals were treated according to our results, and the corresponding programmes of prevention and control were designed.\n\nSimultaneous identification of natural dyes in the collection of drawings and maps from The Royal Chancellery Archives in Granada (Spain) by CE.\n\nPubMed\n\nLÃ³pez-Montes, Ana; Blanc GarcÃ­a, Rosario; Espejo, Teresa; Huertas-Perez, JosÃ© F; NavalÃ³n, Alberto; VÃ­lchez, JosÃ© Luis\n\n2007-04-01\n\nA simple and rapid capillary electrophoretic method with UV detection (CE-UV) has been developed for the identification of five natural dyes namely, carmine, indigo, saffron, gamboge and Rubia tinctoria root.

That model supposed a radical change for the methods of the Spanish teaching and it was the origin of the current educational system. AndrÃ©s ManjÃ³n y ManjÃ³n (1846-1923), priest, jurist and pedagogue, broke with traditional pedagogy and revolutionized the old-fashion model of education that was in vogue until that moment and universalized and socialized education. That pioneer model promoted an education based on aptitudes and faculties, using games and practice, addressed to all ages and social classes, in conjunction with nature. Outdoor education should be used wherever possible. In a historical context of profound social changes, this typology was the answer to the new educational needs using a âspearingâ architectural language based on a constructive system that was both efficient and economic: Spanish Regionalism. It was a new style from the first third of the 20th century that recreated historical forms. It was far from the breakthrough modern movement that, at that time, it took place in central Europe. However, the model of the Manjonian School runs away from historicist models and remains in the simplicity of brick-faced walls or brick-wrapping walls and masonry drawers, with no more decorative concession that window lintels, jambs and sill jut out. The faÃ§ades highlight made with simple semicircular arches and some glazed ceramics. Wooden rounded slabs supported on walls and simple wooden cover structures. The steel was barely used in metal structural slabs and brick, and even less on the roof.

However, in 2009 the disease returned in the form of small outbreaks. This study describes the measles outbreak that occurred in Granada from October 2010 to August 2011 and the measures imposed to control it. Information was sourced from the records of the Andalusian epidemiological surveillance system. A total of 308 cases were recorded, representing an incidence rate of 33.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The first wave of the epidemic took place in Granada city, with the majority of cases occurring among families who lived in the AlbaycÃ­n neighbourhood and were opposed to vaccination for ideological and/or religious reasons. The initial cases were in unvaccinated children aged 1 to 13 years. The outbreak later spread throughout the province. To control the outbreak, the vaccination schedule for the exposed children was brought up to date. The Regional Ministry of Health decided to take legal action in order to ensure vaccination of those in the initial nucleus of the outbreak.\n\n[Screening of scoliosis in a school population of 8 to 12 years in the province of Granada (Spain)].\n\nPubMed\n\nZurita Ortega, F; Moreno Lorenzo, C; Ruiz RodrÃ­guez, L; MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez, A; Zurita Ortega, A; Castro SÃ¡nchez, A M\n\n2008-10-01\n\nThe scoliosis is a disease that affects the three-dimensional shape of the spine, which may occur at any stage of life but mainly arises from 10 years of age, and it is everyone's job (doctors, physiotherapists and teachers) responsible for managing the schoolchild to detect this spinal deformity. Therefore, we included a number of objectives in our study; first to detect the spinal disorder (scoliosis) in the school population from 8 to 12 years of Granada province; to establish the relationships between age groups and gender in people with scoliosis in the province of Granada; and finally to determine whether the occurrence of such changes have a greater impact on certain geographical areas in Granada province. Thus, this is a descriptive and cross-sectional study of a school population (n=2,956) in the province of Granada analyzed the positive clinical signs using the Adams Test on individuals with scoliosis. Of the 16 % (n=472) of schoolchildren who had scoliosis, 57.6 % (n=272) were male. The distribution of children from 8 to 12 years is fairly homogeneous with no differences seen (p=0.62) and highlight areas of higher incidence of scoliosis in zone 5 (Alpujarra-Valle of LecrÃ­n). We conclude that there are no significant differences in scoliosis as regards age group (8 to 12 years), but there is an increasing trend towards the male gender. Differences can also be observed in the seven areas of study defined by work, environmental, genetic and consanguinity factors.\n\nLas Vegas\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2001-10-22\n\nThis image of Las Vegas, NV was acquired on August, 2000 and covers an area 42 km (25 miles) wide and 30 km (18 miles) long.

The sensitivity is studied both in relative terms by means of the Radiation Amplification Factor (RAF) and in absolute terms using the Ozone Efficiency (OE). These two variables are determined for diverse sky conditions characterized by the cloud cover information given by a sky camera (in oktas) and the cloud optical depth (COD) estimated from global solar radiation measurements. As expected, in absolute terms, the TOC variations cause substantially smaller UVER changes during completely overcast situations than during cloud-free cases. For instance, the OE (SZA = 30Â°, TOC = 290 DU) decreases from 0.68 mW m(-2) per unit of TOC (0 oktas) to 0.50 mW m(-2) per unit of TOC (8 oktas). However, the opposite is observed when the analysis is performed in relative terms. Thus, the RAF (determined for SZA cases below 80Â°) increases from 1.1 for cloud-free cases (0 oktas) to 1.4 for completely overcast situations (8 oktas). This opposite behavior is also found when both RAF and OE are analyzed as functions of COD. Thus, while the OE strongly decreases with increasing COD, the RAF increases as COD increases.

The image displays three bands of the reflected visible and infrared wavelength region, with a spatial resolution of 15 m. McCarran International Airport to the south and Nellis Air Force Base to the NE are the two major airports visible. Golf courses appear as bright red areas of worms. The first settlement in Las Vegas (which is Spanish for The Meadows) was recorded back in the early 1850s when the Mormon church, headed by Brigham Young, sent a mission of 30 men to construct a fort and teach agriculture to the Indians. Las Vegas became a city in 1905 when the railroad announced this city was to be a major division point. Prior to legalized gambling in 1931, Las Vegas was developing as an agricultural area. Las Vegas' fame as a resort area became prominent after World War II. The image is located at 36.1 degrees north latitude and 115.1 degrees west longitude.

These water are consumed by the population of the zone who live in villages. This is almost half of the population of the whole region. Mean values of activity concentrations found are 42.61 Â± 2.66; 49.55 Â± 3.03; 1.64 Â± 0.28 and 1.74 Â± 0.15 mBq L-1 for 238U, 234U, 235U and 210Po, respectively. Finally, the radiological impact of the analysed waters has been determined, in terms of the estimation of the committed annual effective dose due to the ingestion of the water. The assessment has been carried out for five age groups with the aim to cover all the population. The calculated annual effective doses are observed to be below the prescribed dose limit of 100 Î¼Sv y-1 recommended by WHO.\n\nOn the variability of Vega\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nButkovskaya, V. V.\n\n2014-06-01\n\nFor 60 years Vega has been accepted as a standard star in the near infrared, optical, and ultraviolet ranges. However, a 21-year spectral and spectrophotometric variability of Vega has been revealed. Vega also demonstrates short-term unexplained variability. Recent spectropolarimetric studies have revealed a weak magnetic field on Vega. We analyze the results of 15-year observations performed at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory and we hypothesize that the magnetic field variation is caused by stellar rotation. In the present work we summarize the results of investigations on the variability of Vega.\n\nMetabolic syndrome and nutrition in a Granada's tropical coast population.\n\nPubMed\n\nMillÃ¡n, S; Samaniego-SÃ¡nchez, C; Romero, A; Quesada-Granados, J J; LÃ³pez-GarcÃ­a de la Serrana, H\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe metabolic syndrome (MS) is described as an association of health problems that a given person may simultaneously or successively develop, and it is considered a serious condition because it is related to a significantly increased risk of suffering diabetes, coronary disease and brain damage. Nutrition, along with other factors such as physical activity and genetic inheritance, has an influence on preventing MS. The aim of this research is to demonstrate important aspects concerning the diagnosis, the prevalence, and the prevention of metabolic syndrome among the population of the tropical coast of Granada. 119 individuals from the tropical coast of Granada were studied to collect personal data such as their body mass index, body fat percentage, glycaemia, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and food intake (through nutritional survey). As a result of this research, a metabolic syndrome prevalence of 20,2% was obtained, 58,3% of which was related to women. The results obtained show significant statistical differences between individuals having metabolic syndrome and the control group. Particularly, these differences can be noted in parameters such as the BMI or the % of body fat. Nevertheless, there are no significant differences between the two groups concerning parameters related to nutrition such as % of fat, carbohydrates, proteins and kcal/day. As a conclusion from the research, we can state that the metabolic syndrome prevalence among the population of the tropical coast of Granada is similar to the figure obtained for the population in the US and in other areas of Spain. In addition, this research shows that metabolic syndrome is more frequent among individuals whose BMI and % of body fat is higher than 30. Copyright Â© AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2013.

Strain F-278,770(T) was oxidase- and catalase-positive, aerobic, with a respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor, non-spore-forming and motile by one polar flagellum, although some cells had two polar flagella. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and rpoD genes revealed that strain F-278,770(T) belongs to the Pseudomonas koreensis subgroup (Pseudomonas fluorescens lineage), with Pseudomonas moraviensis, P. koreensis, P. baetica and P. helmanticensis as its closest relatives. Chemotaxonomic traits such as polar lipid and fatty acid compositions and G+C content of genomic DNA corroborated the placement of strain F-278,770(T) in the genus Pseudomonas. DNA-DNA hybridization assays and phenotypic traits confirmed that this strain represents a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas granadensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is F-278,770(T) (â= DSM 28040(T)â= LMG 27940(T)).

However, the TCP congestion control may function poorly in high bandwidth-delay product networks because of its slow response with large congestion windows. In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of TCP Vegas called Quick Vegas, in which we present an efficient congestion window control algorithm for a TCP source. Our algorithm improves the slow-start and congestion avoidance techniques of original Vegas. Simulation results show that Quick Vegas significantly improves the performance of connections as well as remaining fair when the bandwidth-delay product increases.\n\n[Characteristics of tuberculosis in the immigrant population in South Granada Health Area].\n\nPubMed\n\nMorales-GarcÃ­a, ConcepciÃ³n; Parra-Ruiz, Jorge; Valero-Aguilera, Beatriz; Sanbonmatsu-GÃ¡mez, Sara; SÃ¡nchez-MartÃ­nez, JosÃ© Antonio; HernÃ¡ndez-Quero, JosÃ©\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThe incidence of tuberculosis (TB) among the native population in Spain continues to decrease, resulting in a higher proportion of foreign-born cases. The aim of this study was to identify the differential TB characteristics within the immigrant population with respect to the native population in the South Granada Health Area, Spain. This was a descriptive study, including all cases of TB diagnosed during the period 2003-2010. Cases were identified through a prospective database. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine differential characteristics. From 319 TB cases diagnosed, 247 were natives and 72 (22.6%) immigrants, and 272 were pulmonary tuberculosis. The following variables were significantly associated with immigrant TB cases: age<35 years (OR=4.75, CI: 2.72-8.31), higher percentage of cavitated chest X-ray (OR=2.26, CI: 1.20-4.20), higher percentage of smear-positive cases (OR=1.80, CI: 1.02-3.16), longer diagnostic delay in smear-positive pulmonary TB (median 32 days vs. 21 days P=.043), and lower total lethality (OR=0.12; CI: 0.01-0.89). The incidence of TB has remained constant in the South Granada Health Area due to the increase in cases among immigrants. Compared with native TB patients, immigrant patients were younger and had more advanced disease (higher percentage of smear-positive cases and higher percentage of cavitated chest X-ray) and longer diagnostic delay in smear-positive pulmonary TB, indicating poorer TB control. Strategies for earlier diagnosis of TB in immigrants are essential. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U. y Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de Enfermedades Infecciosas y MicrobiologÃ­a ClÃ­nica.

Non-fatal suicidal behaviour occurs in a greater proportion than such behaviour with a deadly outcome. There are many causes for this behaviour and it is important to become familiar with them if it is to be prevented. The aim of this article is to describe the characteristics of non-mortal suicidal behaviour in the province of Granada. A retrospective descriptive study of the characteristics of non-mortal suicidal behaviour in Granada during the years 2008 and 2009, according to the database of the Provincial 061 Service in Granada. The sample includes the demands made to this service in which the literal reason for the alert included the terms: suicide, self-harm or the threat of suicide. The statistical analysis was done with the SPSS 15.0 program. We analyzed the variable non-mortal suicidal behaviour with respect to the independent variables: sex, age, month, day of the week, time slot, health district, resolution of the demand (assigned priority) and further attempts. In total we analyzed 535 demands typified as intentional self-injury by unspecified means. Statistically significant differences were found when comparing the data for the two years with respect to the month chosen, and in the relationship between age range and time slot of the suicide attempts. Despite its limitations, the characterization of suicidal behaviour in our province offers essential information, and could be useful in designing and developing a program of psychosocial intervention for the prevention of suicidal behaviour adjusted to the specific profiles of our population.\n\nScheuermann's disease in a juvenile male from the late Roman necropolis of Torrenueva (3rd-4th century CE, Granada, Spain).\n\nPubMed\n\nViciano, Joan; LÃ³pez-LÃ¡zaro, Sandra; PÃ©rez-FernÃ¡ndez, Ãngela; Amores-Ampuero, Anabel; D'Anastasio, Ruggero; JimÃ©nez-Triguero, JosÃ© Miguel\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThis study details a severe case of Scheuermann's disease (SD) in a well-preserved skeleton of a juvenile male (designated TOR302), dated to 3rd-4th century CE, from the late Roman necropolis of Torrenueva (Granada, Spain). Individual TOR302 shows an evident kyphotic curve in the thoraco-lumbar spine, which is characterised by: (i) vertebral bodies of thoracic vertebra T2, thoracic segment T4-T9, and thoraco-lumbar segment T12-L2 wedged at >5Â°; (ii) slight anterior extensions of the epiphyseal ring; (iii) Schmorl's nodes on the superior and/or inferior plates; and (iv) a Cobb angle of 75Â°, derived from thoracic segments T4-T9. In addition, TOR302 shows other skeletal malformations as the secondary results of abnormal growth, due to altered biomechanical forces imposed by the spinal deformity, including: (i) lateral distortion of the spine that causes a slight secondary scoliotic curve; (ii) pelvic obliquity; and (iii) discrepancy in the length of the limbs. We argue that the secondary skeletal abnormalities allowed the individual to adapt to his spinal deformity meaning he was able to walk without the aid of a stick. Despite SD being a common modern clinical finding, few cases have been reported in ancient skeletal remains. This case therefore represents an important contribution to the palaeopathological literature. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Our aim was to examine risk of second primary cancers among women diagnosed with breast cancer. We studied two cohorts of female cancer patients identified in a population-based cancer registry in Granada (Spain): women first diagnosed with a primary breast cancer (n=5897) and those with a primary cancer in another site (n=22,814), followed during 1985-2007 for second cancers and breast cancer occurrence, respectively. We used Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) to estimate second cancer risk by age (<50y, â¥50y), time since diagnosis (â¤5y, >5y) and calendar periods (â¤1995, >1996). SIR for breast cancer was calculated in the second cohort. The risk of developing second cancers (n=314) was 39% higher (95% CI=1.23-1.54) among breast cancer patients, and particularly high among women under 50 (SIR=1.96, 95% CI=1.48-2.44). Excess risk for endometrial cancer (SIR=3.04, 95% CI=2.14-3.94) was statistically significant and remained so in women over 50. Younger women were at higher risk of second ovarian cancer (SIR=4.90, 95% CI=1.27-8.53). Increased SIRs were observed during the first five years after breast cancer diagnosis, whereas SIRs decreased thereafter. Breast cancer incidence (n=171) was not higher among women previously diagnosed with other cancer types (SIR=0.86, 95% CI=0.74-1.00). Women diagnosed with breast cancer have a higher incidence of second primary cancers, particularly of endometrial cancer in women over 50 at diagnosis, and ovarian cancer in younger women. These findings may be explained by treatment-related effects or shared risk factors. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 1109 athletes (650 men, 58.61%; 459 women, 41.39%). Nine diseases and 68 injuries were recorded. In total, the rate of injury was 6.13% (7.07% for men and 4.79% for women). The percentage of injury was highest in alpine skiing (10.34%) followed by freestyle skiing (8.62%). In relation to the time of exposure, freestyle skiing showed the shortest time of exposure (0.31âhours) before suffering an injury. Short track speed skating showed the longest exposure (9.80âhours), before suffering an injury. The most common anatomical areas of injury were the head, shoulder and knee (13.23%). Only nine diseases were suffered (four women and five men) of which six were infections, one was a friction burn, one was a lipothymy and one a cluster headache due to height. In general, 6.13% of the athletes sustained at least one injury and 0.81% a disease, which is a much lower percentage than that recorded in similar events.

These perched travertines are considered as a freshwater reef system with a facies zonation and stratigraphic architecture closely resembling that of marine reef terraces and prograding carbonate platforms. The travertine deposits have been dated by 230Th/ 234U and 14C methods. As in other Mediterranean areas, the travertine deposition occurred episodically during warm and wet interglacial periods coinciding with isotopic stages 9, 7 and 5, and with the transition between isotopic stages 2/1. During these periods, underground dissolution, large outflow in the springs and subsequent calcium carbonate precipitation occurred. In the same way that evolution of reef systems indicates sea level changes, the geomorphology, age and architecture of perched spring travertine systems may be used to interpret former climatically controlled changes in outflow, in base level marked by the altitude of springs and in the chemistry of spring waters. Thus, aggradation or climbing progradation may indicate an increase of outflow at the spring, progradation with toplap is due to a stable base level and, conversely, dowlapping progradation may signify that the base level was gradually dropping. Therefore, the travertines can be considered semiquantitative indicators of the paleohydrological evolution of karstic massifs and used as an important terrestrial proxy climate record.\n\nSports injuries and illnesses during the Granada Winter Universiade 2015\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGallo-Vallejo, Miguel Ãngel; de la Cruz-MÃ¡rquez, Juan Carlos; de la Cruz-Campos, AdriÃ¡n; de la Cruz-Campos, Juan Carlos; PestaÃ±a-Melero, Francisco Luis; Carmona-Ruiz, GinÃ©s; Gallo-GalÃ¡n, Luz MarÃ­a\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective To analyse the incidence of diseases and injuries suffered by athletes participating in the 27th Winter Sports Universiade held in Granada, Spain.

Some papers showed global stability of several network models, but those models are not a dual problem where dynamics both exist in sources and links such as TCP Vegas. Other papers studied TCP Vegas as a dual problem, but it did not fully derive an asymptotic stability region. Therefore we analyze TCP Vegas with Jury's criterion which is necessary and sufficient condition. So we use state space model in discrete time and by using Jury's criterion, we could find an asymptotic stability region of TCP Vegas network model. This result is verified by ns-2 simulation. And by comparing with other results, we could know our method performed well.\n\nThe Las Vegas Sustainability Atlas: Modeling Place-based Interactions and Implications in the Las Vegas Valley Bioregion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEgo, H.; McCown, K.; Saghafi, N.; Gross, E.; Hunter, W.; Zawarus, P.; Gann, A.; Piechota, T. C.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada, with 2 million residents and 40 million annual visitors, is one of the driest metropolitan environments of its size in the world. The metro imports nearly all of its resources, including energy, water and food. Rapid population increases, drought, and temperature increases due to climate change create challenges for planning resilient systems in the Las Vegas Valley. Because of its growth rate, aridity, Las Vegas, Nevada is a significant and relevant region for the study of the water, energy, food and climate nexus. Cities in the United States and the world are seeing increasing trends in urbanization and water scarcity. How does the water-energy-climate-food nexus affect each metropolitan area? How can this complex information be used for resiliency planning? How can it be related to the public, so they can understand the issues in a way that makes them meaningful participants in the planning process? The topic of our presentation is a 'resiliency atlas.' The atlas is a place-based model tested in Las Vegas to explore bioregional distinctiveness of the water-energy-climate-food nexus, including regional transportation systems. The atlas integrates the systems within a utilitarian organization of information. Systems in this place-based model demonstrate how infrastructure services are efficiently provided for the Las Vegas Valley population. This resiliency atlas can clarify how the nexus applies to place; and how it can be used to spur geographically germane adaption strategies. In the Las Vegas Valley, climate change (drought and high sustained temperatures) and population affect water, energy, and food systems. This clarity of a place based model can help educate the public about the resilience of their place, and facilitate and organize the planning process in the face of uncertainty.\n\nPlasma-tail activity at the time of the Vega encounters\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNiedner, Malcolm B., Jr.; Schwingensuch, Konrad\n\n1986-01-01\n\nPhysical associations are sought between Halley's plasma tail activity seen in ground-based imagery and near-comet, solar wind/IMF measurements obtained by the Vega spacecraft. Disconnection Events (DE's) and the sector boundary/frontside magnetic reconnection model (Niedner and Brandt, 1978) of their origin are discussed. Strong support for the model comes from 2 DE's: a major event whose onset, on March 7 to 8, is strongly correlated with a reversal of the comet's magnetic barrier observed by Vega-1 and Vega-2 and with an IMF sector boundary observed by Vega-1; and a minor event on March 7 which may be associated with the two-polarity (possibly reconnecting) magnetic barrier seen by Vega-1 on March 6, when the solar-wind density was low.\n\nLANDSCAPE CHANGE OF THE LAS VEGAS VALLEY, 1972 TO 1998\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nLas Vegas has become one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States.

For this purpose stone tablets were placed vertically at four sites with contrasting local pollution micro-environments and exposure conditions (rain-sheltered and unsheltered). The back (rain-sheltered) and the front (rain-unsheltered) faces of the stone tablets were studied for each site. The soiling process (surface blackening) was monitored through lightness (ÎL*) and chroma changes (ÎC*). Additionally atmospheric particles deposited on the stone surfaces and on PM10 filters during the exposure time were studied through a multianalytical approach including scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and micro-Raman spectroscopy. The identified atmospheric particles (responsible for stone soiling) were mainly soot and soil dust particles; also fly ash and aged salt particles were found. The soiling process was related to surface texture, exposure conditions and proximity to dense traffic streets. On the front faces of all stones, black soiling and surface roughness promoted by differential erosion between micritic and sparitic calcite were noticed. Moreover, it was found that surface roughness enhanced a feedback process that triggers further black soiling. The calculated effective area coverage (EAC) by light absorbing dust ranged from 10.2 to 20.4%, exceeding by far the established value of 2% EAC (limit perceptible to the human eye). Soiling coefficients (SC) were estimated based on square-root and bounded exponential fittings. Estimated black carbon (BC) concentration resulted in relatively similar SC for all studied sites and thus predicts the soiling process better than using particulate matter (PM10) concentration.

In Spain, the guidelines for school meals have been established by the NAOS strategy and the Perseus program, and are especially aimed at school children of 6-10 years. However, there is a lack of information on menus offered in pre-school education centres, which take in children of pre-school age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition and the food supplied in pre-schools of the province of Granada. A study was conducted on the menus offered in public pre-schools in Granada, with a population of 420 children aged 2-6 years old. A total of 20 menus were analysed, and details were collected including direct information on the ingredients used, the proportion of these in each dish, and the form of preparation. The daily intake of energy and nutrients, as well as the frequency of weekly supply of the different food groups were studied. The average energy content of the menus was 512.5kcal, distributed into protein (17.3%), carbohydrates (48.8%), and lipids (33.9%). A suitable supply of fibre (7.8g/day) was observed, but content of calcium and zinc did not reach recommended levels. The supply of vegetables was adequate, with a daily presence of salad, as well as vegetables, meat, fish and fruit. Menus evaluated represent an adequate content of energy, and proper supply of the different groups of foods, especially vegetables, fruits and salads. A great effort is observed in the centres to adapt meals to nutritional recommendations. Copyright Â© 2015 AsociaciÃ³n EspaÃ±ola de PediatrÃ­a. Publicado por Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U.

Anish; Werthimer, Dan; Whitehead, Mark\n\n2015-07-01\n\nThe VEGAS multi-beam spectrometer (VEGAS) was built for the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) through a partnership between the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and the University of California at Berkeley. VEGAS is based on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) frontend and a heterogeneous computing backend comprised of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and CPUs. This system provides processing power to analyze up to 8 dual-polarization or 16 single-polarization inputs at bandwidths of up to 1.25 GHz per input. VEGAS was released for \"shared-risk\" observing in March 2014 and it became the default GBT spectral line backend in August 2014. Some of the early VEGAS observations include the Radio Ammonia Mid-Plane Survey, mapping of HCN/HCO+ in nearby galaxies, and a variety of radio-recombination line and pulsar projects. We will present some of the latest VEGAS science highlights.\n\nPrevalence of the colonization of Helicobacter pylori among students of the school of dentistry, University of Granada, Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiÃ©bana, J; GarcÃ­a-Casas, V; LiÃ©bana-Cabanillas, F; Arias-Moliz, M-T\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe oral cavity is a reservoir for Helicobacter pylori, and occupations that involve close contact with it, like Dentistry, could entail a higher risk of colonization. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the length of stay at the School of Dentistry of the University of Granada could influence colonization by H. pylori, , and to furthermore correlate colonization by H. pylori, with the state of oral health and oral hygiene habits. The study groups were: Group 1, 35 students of Odontology in their first year of studies; Group 2, the same 35 students when they were in their fifth academic year; Group 3, 35 students from University study programs unrelated with Health and of the same age as the group 2 students.
