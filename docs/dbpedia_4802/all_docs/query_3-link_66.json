        "text": "[00:00:37] Very good morning and welcome to another edition of Supply Chain Now in Spanish Today I have a very special guest participating in the supply chain and logistics in a very, very particular area. The area of shows, events and international transport to put together all these great stages, shows and popular events. So I have it‚Äôs going to be a very interesting episode for sure and I thank you all for joining us. Before I introduce you to our guest today, I‚Äôd like to remind you to subscribe to Supli Chain Now. You can also visit us on our website at Supply Chain Now Dot Com. And you can visit us on any social network, or you can also visit us on any tool where you listen to your podcasts. Again, my name is Enrique Alvarez. This is Supply Chain Nagua in Spanish. And without further ado, let me welcome Jorge Cosac. Jorge. Good morning to you. Welcome to Supply Chain Nahua in English. How are you?\n\n[00:01:45] Very good, very good. How are you?\n\n[00:01:48] Very, very good. Jorge Cosep, director Shiho de Bronquio. Tell us briefly Jorge, how about you, how did it go, how was your week?\n\n[00:02:00] All right, we‚Äôre off to a good start. Yesterday was actually a holiday in Mexico, I took the opportunity to go to Cuernavaca. How nice! A business I have in clothing, regardless of logistics and freight. Excellent. Very hot, but tasty.\n\n[00:02:15] Here in the U.S. it‚Äôs hardly changing. Here is your home. Spring is changing a bit in Atlanta. Then the weather is just starting to change, which is already really good, we needed it forge before coming in. We want to talk a little about you, we want to talk a little about your company. We obviously want to know a bit of the anecdotes that you must have several, but something, some good news, something positive that has happened to you this week to start this program on a good note that we can share with everyone, eh?\n\n[00:02:47] I think they can, but first of all, thank you very much for the invitation. It is a pleasure to share this past experiences and future forecasts of our great medium of entertainment and good news. Well, first of all we are a company that specializes in transportation and logistics for the entertainment industry. We move concerts, theatres, music, sports and fairs, cinema, etcetera. I rate it everything that people pay a ticket to go see a show. That‚Äôs where we entered the challenge and the very good news that INE gave us last week was that they asked us to start putting together the logistics for a group, a European band. I can‚Äôt say the name, but it‚Äôs a very good project.\n\n[00:03:47] Are you going to leave us there with the doubt?\n\n[00:03:48] But doubt yes, but it is a good project, at least for September 2022. I know it‚Äôs a long way off, but there are 70 trucks, 70 trailers between production stages. Woww! So people are already starting to see what shows are in the future. I am Dr. Gonz√°lez Le√≥n for a couple of tours in the United States. Now in the summer. Girl stuff, but at least I‚Äôve. At least there is already a breakthrough. There is already a light at the end of the tunnel, unlike last year, when there was all this uncertainty about how long it was going to last and how the media was going to come back, etcetera. We‚Äôll talk to them if they have us, if they have us, pretty much relegated. The whole, the whole entertainment industry.\n\n[00:04:42] I can imagine. I can imagine. And well, that‚Äôs something that we‚Äôll be talking more about in the course of this interview, because I imagine that your industry, and in particular entertainment and entertainment logistics, has been one of the industries most affected by the pandemic. But we‚Äôll talk a little bit more about that in a moment, as you say. For now, good news already out of the light at the end of the tunnel and hopefully soon all those who are listening to us and all of us who are here, we can meet again, have a beer together, go to a concert, go to a sporting event and come back a little more. With some experience and hopefully some learning, I hope to return to this again to our more normal life. Before that, Jorge, tell us a little bit about yourself. Where did you grow up? Any anecdote from your childhood? Something that defines you?\n\n[00:05:37] It has been in Buenos Aires, Argentina, a couple of years ago, past fifty and long, almost almost reaching 60 and born in Argentina and uh, I must admit that my mom worked in a travel agency in Buenos Aires and this travel agency was dedicated to sell airline tickets to symphony orchestras. How did Argentina come to that in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs? It will be a mystery, who knows. I know the story, but let‚Äôs leave it as a mystery. But well, when I was very young we went to pick up my mom at Ezeiza, at the airport and the trip back was about two hours, two and a half hours by car and mom and mom telling stories of what had happened with such and such a director, what had happened with this, with the logic, with the plane and with the musicians and the banana. Eh? When I was fourteen years old the New York orchestra arrived in Buenos Aires and they entrusted me with a bus. Not to be responsible for a bus.\n\n[00:06:50] At the age of 14 you were already working with your mom in the agency.\n\n[00:06:53] Or at the agency? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I already was. Worked as a courier\n\n[00:06:59] From a very young age. So this is\n\n[00:07:01] Bullying? I have been with the New York Philharmonic since I was very young, and I am with the New York Philharmonic. I remember. You have the Teatro Col√≥n before the concert starts and. This one rings and the phone rings, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. And I remember being backstage backstage and watching. To the audience and me, being backstage, I said this feels like, this feels like.\n\n[00:07:31] That since I‚Äôm not like o\n\n[00:07:32] As a power concert. And from there I started my career in show business, first as a travel agent, working with the travel agency, not at 14, but this twenty three 24 years. In between I went to Switzerland to study hotel management and tourism. I have a degree, I have a degree in Hospitality and Tourism. So. I have some basic education, business education, and so on.\n\n[00:08:06] How nice! And tell us, the show used to call you. Do you play an instrument? Did you personally get involved in any part of what your mom was doing at the time? You touch something or\n\n[00:08:21] I play guitar for me? Vernet calls me an auto kantor, haha, crazy to me. I compare myself to the musicians I travel with. Sure, and obviously not!\n\n[00:08:33] Well, you‚Äôre using. If you‚Äôre using one. A very high mark, for sure.\n\n[00:08:38] Surely. Then I prefer to play for myself. It‚Äôs a hobby I‚Äôve had for a long time. I‚Äôve compared to someone who doesn‚Äôt play, I play and compared to someone who I play really isn‚Äôt more of a hobby.\n\n[00:08:54] Is there a particular type of music that you like, a better band, that you‚Äôve seen several live and you‚Äôve moved all their production aside, something that albums you? Are you a fan of someone?\n\n[00:09:04] I‚Äôm very much a Simon and Garfunkel, James Taylor Crosby, Stills kind of guy. Hey, some music in Spanish. But I‚Äôm leaning more towards the Genesis. I‚Äôm more inclined to English music, of course.\n\n[00:09:20] Very, very good and also a very good time. Not all those groups you mentioned. Well, I saw many of them\n\n[00:09:26] Live a lot, a lot. I got to see it live, even without being in the middle of the show yet. I got to see Simon and Garfunkel on. When I was studying in Switzerland they toured,\n\n[00:09:38] Which is why. What was your first concert that you remember?\n\n[00:09:41] My first concert\n\n[00:09:43] That you went and now we‚Äôre talking about you moved\n\n[00:09:45] That I was or that\n\n[00:09:47] You didn‚Äôt go. That you remember to participate as a mere spectator.\n\n[00:09:54] Phew, what a good question, eh? Son, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.. Eh? There is an Argentine band called Ser√∫ Gir√°n. Charly Garc√≠a. Viruses well, Qhuinn in eighty-one in Argentina.\n\n[00:10:15] To have been one of the first big bands that came along, which was\n\n[00:10:19] It has one of the first great stadiums that was Argentina. Kuina In ‚Äô81 I had the great good fortune to have gone to see him. I had been in a smaller group before, in theater, in stadiums. I‚Äôve never been dumped before. And I would say if the first big eighty-one, but as spectators, sure, sure.\n\n[00:10:41] Now, now we move on to your professional stage, which is also very interesting, especially from the point of view of Supli Chain Now and Supli Cheyne East. So you like it? Passionate about music? Your mom instills this culture in you through the travel agency. Are you going to Switzerland to study hotel management? How do you get back? Tell us a little more about what happens after several suicides? How do you get back?\n\n[00:11:04] I don‚Äôt really go back, I mean, I go back, but almost with work, because on one of those tours my mom went. Listen I need someone who speaks French for a French orchestra tour and my mom says are you interested? You go directly to work with Columbia Artist based in New York. So I talk, I make an appointment, an interview with the man who became my boss and then I start working as a freelance with Columbia Artiz, based in the United States and at the same time as a travel agent. So it kind of fulfilled both\n\n[00:11:47] Swiss functions. Did you go straight to New York or did you go to Argentina? Then my\n\n[00:11:51] Argentina almost to change my clothes\n\n[00:11:53] And change the suitcase and change\n\n[00:11:55] The suitcase and straight to start touring.\n\n[00:11:59] What do you get? What strikes you the most if you remember those days? Well, these are important decisions, aren‚Äôt they? Go live in Europe, go to the United States. I mean, what is it that caught your attention in this\n\n[00:12:10] Industry in the United States? I was based in Buenos Aires and flew. He talked about there being work. I really wanted to travel. And I said well, what do I do to travel and get paid to travel? So I think it was an excellent combination. And I was from January 87 to 95, almost climbing on a plane, practically getting to know the world.\n\n[00:12:43] How nice, how nice! Any teachings or lessons from your mom or your childhood? Any mentors? It‚Äôs something you remember that I see you successful.\n\n[00:12:52] Three mentors. One was my mom, who actually when I got to the first tour alone, uh. It was like I already knew, I had already heard, I already had that one. That basis of what had happened, of what of the stories my mom had told for the last ten years. Of course and that to the Confusam, the director such liked such a thing that he did not like the buses to arrive one by one. I mean, there were certain things that when I started touring it was like, I already know this, I already lived this, even though I didn‚Äôt live it. I had already heard that and it was like I had a competitive advantage. When I entered the milieu, relatively young because I started touring when I was 24 years old and there I was given full tours of 120, 150 musicians and unlike rock and roll, in classical music there was one person with the whole orchestra and that person is in charge. Really everything, from the negotiation with this, with the hotels, with the buses, with the transportation, with going to look for the tickets. I mean, I didn‚Äôt have to sell the show, but the rest was all there, all included.\n\n[00:14:22] And it all depended on you, I imagine.\n\n[00:14:24] It all depends on one person or one dependent person to keep an eye on everything, on all that movement. And then I entered a period where we went on tour with telexes. There were no cell phones. I came in just before, a couple of years before the fax came out. Then our confirmations with TORAN hotels, the yellow perforated woww e rolls. And that was the confirmation from the hotels via T.L.\n\n[00:14:55] A lot of confidence. You have to have in a system that‚Äôs based a little bit on word of mouth or the phone or what you were told. They told me that you move all these people and everything with confidence, that when you get there they are not going to tell you oh no, we don‚Äôt have a Jorge registered, thing.\n\n[00:15:11] That this is where it ends. Yes, where some passed by. And that‚Äôs where you take out your email today, and you say here, of course, Raul Guerra confirmed it to me there, the specific hotel roll. That is, I have so many single rooms, so many double rooms, a suite, etc‚Ä¶\n\n[00:15:30] Hey, we got a little sidetracked. So your first, your first mentor or the person who taught you your mom, you were telling us that you had some. Two more.\n\n[00:15:37] Two more. The second was the person who hires me at Columbia, Artiz, Ducks, Seldom e Tipazo e a majestic teaching.\n\n[00:15:49] What was your title? Be like you‚Äôre going to find me\n\n[00:15:52] Tucumanas of super manager. Your manager? Yes, but your manager. But as I went with the orchestras, I was a tour manager, stage manager, babysitter manager, a\n\n[00:16:04] Pick it up from whatever it was when you just\n\n[00:16:07] He sat on everything, everything.\n\n[00:16:08] Good preparation to then get into logistics, I imagine.\n\n[00:16:13] I think it‚Äôs all part of the logistics. I believe that not only moving loads, but moving people. It is also part of a logistical process, because buses have to be hired. We need to determine what time we arrive at the airport. You have to go to check in. You have to check in at the hotels, eh? I don‚Äôt know if it was me or not, but I remember when I made my first tour with the orchestra with orchestras. They gave me all the English rommies and me more. That‚Äôs what I was doing my planning. Until one day I proposed that we put a number to each of the people and with that number I identified much faster, of course. And there I make the famous Liggett Stacks with their numbers, instead of naming them. So, for me to check in and check out of a hotel was 15 minutes, wasn‚Äôt it?\n\n[00:17:04] Because you had already mounted the numbers today how many are there?\n\n[00:17:07] I was going by number. I toured with Russian orchestras.\n\n[00:17:11] And the seven base names. Well, you don‚Äôt end up knowing who the track is.\n\n[00:17:15] But I was grateful. The one goes to room four zero four, the two, the ATAL, right? And there we mark the labels. And the truth, the luggage distribution was very fast. I think that if one talks about logistics, even what to do to distribute, I don‚Äôt know, 250 suitcases to each of the rooms of the musicians with the hotel‚Äôs own people and that the musicians receive suitcases. I think it‚Äôs part, let‚Äôs say, of a logistical process that is perhaps very short, but it also requires some. Yeah, that‚Äôs right. I don‚Äôt say angry, but a certain dexterity for\n\n[00:17:55] That when I‚Äôm definitely, definitely I‚Äôm more reproachful to you than a science almost\n\n[00:18:00] It is said and the less it takes the pop suitcase, the less you get. I give the example of the suitcase in the less time the suitcase takes to get to the musician‚Äôs room, the less mair, the less criticism. Are you going to see where my suitcase is? No, of course not.\n\n[00:18:16] Well, then it‚Äôs the second one and I‚Äôd say to the second mix\n\n[00:18:20] And the third one is where I enter already into the environment of the load e. Through manager‚Äôs contacts. Since the tours I‚Äôve known the owner of a company called Rocket Cargo, who are based in Los Angeles, who are, shall we say, the founders, so to speak, of event cargo logistics. At the cargo transport level. Contact with the owner we become very close friends and eh! He offers me in the year 94. Have you come to open the Mexico office? How nice! Eh? And I accept the challenge. It was very good for me. There was no Rocket office in Mexico. 2 The totally virgin land, although there was a lot of show already happening, but there was one agent and there was no official office. And in ninety-four is when the devaluation took place in Mexico. In the same way, I come in February 95, after the Stones tour, which I had to do in South America and. And luckily it worked out and. And it grew. We did 90 percent of the events in Mexico, right?\n\n[00:19:56] Impressive. And besides something so dysfunctional and relevant to O‚ÄôShea without the support of companies like Roky, not yours or with or you in particular. For none of what so many people enjoy could. This could be done. That‚Äôs something very behind the scenes, something I don‚Äôt know. You can‚Äôt see it, but it‚Äôs critical.\n\n[00:20:22] No, we don‚Äôt do marketing. That‚Äôs all. It‚Äôs a lot of word of mouth, of recommendations between production managers, between bands, in, in, in, in delivering on time and foreseeing everything that can go wrong. There can‚Äôt be a day‚Äôs delay here,\n\n[00:20:42] If not the concert is up to date and they have to play that day. Tell me about it. I wouldn‚Äôt be, I wouldn‚Äôt be doing my job. If not, I wouldn‚Äôt ask you about the Rolling Stones. That tour counts. You couldn‚Äôt share any. One, two or three anecdotes of veiling in South America, both of their personalities and of the part, obviously logistical, which is what also attracts.\n\n[00:21:05] I was in charge of this show on the Stones tour. I was in charge of the Rolling Stones‚Äô passenger plane. Oh, wow. Then I had to do everything, including the arrival and departure from each country. Not only the musicians, there were the technicians, there was the band, and so on. And the idea was that we would arrive with the plane to? To the city. And we could do immigration and customs on the plane. We didn‚Äôt go directly to the buses to the vans and from there they went to the hotel and for the departure they came from the hotel directly to the plane. We would get on and leave. So I saw my role on that tour was to expedite the immigration and customs procedures so that we didn‚Äôt go through the terminals, through the airports, but we got off and went directly.\n\n[00:22:04] What was it? The most or the best? Rare or exotic? Although some people told me that they have to ask you for a million particular things from that group, the request calmed down a bit.\n\n[00:22:20] Actually, airplanes, unlike what they ask for in hotels, on airplanes, it‚Äôs their place where no one really bothers them. Where there is no press, where there are no fans, where there are no fans, then the truth becomes a very intimate place for them to smell a book or dedicate themselves to listening to their music, and they don‚Äôt have the fanaticism of the adrenaline of being there. Because as soon as they landed, if the door opened, it was crazy. My image was crazy because of all the people at the airport, the pictures and the fans. So, the truth is, they drink a lot. For example, I toured with what Ansem Roses and Yaks El Rock 3 have as two personalities the outsider personality of the plane and inside the plane a conversation totally like the one we are having. The guy drinking his tea, huh? No, one would imagine it to be so.\n\n[00:23:27] Of course that‚Äôs how Axel Ross is on stage, really. 24 hours a day is.\n\n[00:23:33] It is a closed place where there are no TV cameras, where they are the group and where there is no one outside to show them who the group is.\n\n[00:23:48] Hey, going back to you, what you were saying before, before you were in Rocket, in Mexico, about your three mentors, something that maybe helped you, something in particular that they told you or recommended you to be successful, that you later saw it applied when you were with Gonzalo rehurses or when you were with the Rolling Stones. What lessons did these three people who were so important to you in Chile leave you?\n\n[00:24:12] All three? Anticipate. Anticipate. Anticipate. So, have your vacation plans, because there aren‚Äôt any here. In other words, you don‚Äôt have to. Ah! It didn‚Äôt come and it didn‚Äôt come. No, no, no, no, no‚Ä¶ In other words,\n\n[00:24:29] Flat. Plan B.\n\n[00:24:30] Plan The new Flambeau planch√© plan zeta. Double plan speaking. Short term. Yeah, and it‚Äôs something to say. I think it also develops over time where you are presented with a project, for example now the 70 trucks of September 2022. It‚Äôs not all uncertainty because the truth is we don‚Äôt even know how we‚Äôre going to finish 2021, do we? But if you can, let‚Äôs say say well, I have 70 trucks today. What is the problem? Critical that can or will happen in a 70 truck movement between Laredo, Texas and Mexico City. There is no transverse at the border. There‚Äôs a shortage of drivers, I am, because they left. The United States gave visas to Mexican drivers because they lack drivers in the United States. So where do they come from? Of borders, of borders. Lower the number of transfers to cross the border. 12. Cross 70 trucks in one day. It‚Äôs just that it has its eh? It‚Äôs got its own set of flats. So I believe that the fact of prevention and having a flat amble Prancer is a lesson that the vulture mentors have taught me. So if you‚Äôre going to do something always have your plan B and if there is no plan B. Your client has to be very convinced that there is no clear plan B.\n\n[00:26:07] For the risk to be shared or rather for the government to be the risk taker. And about the decisions.\n\n[00:26:13] He thinks it was like two, three years ago we did the tour of Gloria Trevi and Alejandra Guzman and on a flight from Lima Peru to Guayaquil. We need three Lour of positions. And there was only one LAN Chile flight. Chi, chi chi. The load couldn‚Äôt fit in another one, no, because they are elevators used by bands and artists. So, with the Two Weeks of Digimon program, not only do you carry it, but you fly on that same flight. So. We will do everything we can to make sure that it will be grandfathered in without functions. What if it worked? No! But there was no no, but\n\n[00:26:56] I‚Äôd glamorous, you‚Äôd look, there was no night till the next day or so, I‚Äôd\n\n[00:26:59] I guess. There was bacon plan and apart from the flight with him with the Boeing on 7 6 7 I think he flew on Tuesdays. On Thursdays, he clarified then. There was, no, no, no, there was no plan. But that‚Äôs where you start talking to the production people, I mean, it‚Äôs either this or we chat. No, I mean, I can put you on a plane, it‚Äôs going to cost ten times as much. But of course, that‚Äôs where we get there. No? Of course.\n\n[00:27:30] So, well, the first thing to prevent. The other is to communicate, to communicate the expectations and important communications from the beginning.\n\n[00:27:37] If communication is fundamental. In fact there are many times that we get called into meetings to plan a tour and they say let‚Äôs see, we have so much equipment. These are the countries and cities we want to do it. Yousef. Recommendations because? What route do we do? Of course, it‚Äôs in our best interest to put together a set and set. B Do this first, do this. Then we also participate in the programming of the ideas.\n\n[00:28:10] Today that‚Äôs something more recent that we‚Äôre seeing, because it seems to me that lately I don‚Äôt know if you share this opinion, but logistics has become more important. Or at least people are starting to realize the importance of logistics. Before it was similar or have you seen any changes there, now they include you more in the planning. I used to do it before in my eyes as well.\n\n[00:28:31] None.\n\n[00:28:32] Always and always at events. Always, always keep in mind\n\n[00:28:36] Always show business. It works a lot of hand in hand coming up with more big tours. He touched me. I had the good fortune to attend a dinner with the owner Roky Cargo and the worldwide promoter of Michael Jackson‚Äôs Dangerous School tour in ‚Äô93. Wow! Y. I, obviously, as a listener. But how were four planes we used for that tour? Two passenger and two antono. And I had to be in the organization of the planning of the tour and that the promoter took after that dinner as a precondition that was required between city and city to move those four planes.\n\n[00:29:32] And these kinds of projects. I imagine they involve a lot of collaboration from many different parties and organizations. Normally it is given to a company, in this case Michael Jackson, it is given to Rocket Keigo and they are the ones who coordinate and then they see if they have a business partner in Argentina, or in Chile, or in Thailand, or they take everything and they have to do everything around the world.\n\n[00:29:56] Eh? How does our, our company work? Do we have agents or do we have our own offices? Because we don‚Äôt have offices in Miami, in Laredo, Texas and in Bogota, Colombia. Which are our own offices. What if there is no network of agents? E As own in, I would say ninety-nine percent of the roots. And in fact, we as our own, we are agents for several companies from other countries that require assistance in Mexico Cloud.\n\n[00:30:32] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Well, you mentioned right now pro-io, if you want to move on quickly, we were saying, you were telling us that you were given the opportunity to open Roky in Mexico. Take us away from there. What‚Äôs next in your career? You are now in charge of Rocking in Mexico? How? How do you transition to being your own supporter?\n\n[00:30:53] I did, I did several years of touring, including Michael Jackson INSEN tours, cancer tours, redness. Followed by the Bruce Springsteen orchestras and the Madonna Janet Jackson show. I mean, I have. I have a bit of a history of being. Practically touring, Michael Jackson‚Äôs tour was eleven months.\n\n[00:31:19] Well, you go with them everywhere.\n\n[00:31:21] We all like the north. That is, some parts of part\n\n[00:31:24] From the tour.\n\n[00:31:25] We are part of the group. We go to the same hotels and everything. And everyone has their own. Your specific activities. Michael Jackson‚Äôs tour It was 11 months without going back home and in fact, when we played in Buenos Aires, instead of going home, I stopped at the hotel where the club stopped. I mean, I didn‚Äôt even have Klout.\n\n[00:31:46] We had to\n\n[00:31:47] It was. It was part of the tour. In 1994 I was offered to open Rock de Mexico, in February 1995 I arrived in Mexico and the truth was very, very, very enriching to start getting customs agents, transportation, idiosyncrasy of how Mexico works, although I had already come on tour. It‚Äôs one thing to come and be welcomed and another to welcome the person who comes to do a show. I haven‚Äôt just done a tour of Argentina for Luis Miguel as your manager. Then I had a group of friends that I had made in Argentina, and here I started to greet them all and little by little one begins to generate a base, to give good service. We return to the theme of communication and keep on doing. Lits to see who‚Äôs coming? Who is not coming? Who goes on tour with the Caifanes tour. When I arrive in Mexico I get Ana Gabriel E.‚Äôs tour.\n\n[00:33:11] Well, you have an amazing experience. I imagine that everyone is starting to look for you too. Not at this point in your stage this. They already know you have the expertise they need to run. How well I go then, as if sorry, follow him and.\n\n[00:33:28] And the other is to dedicate time to it. That‚Äôs 24.\n\n[00:33:33] No, it‚Äôs not dedicating the time today is not working 40 hours a week. That‚Äôs not spending time.\n\n[00:33:39] And the truth is, our schedules are totally opposite to those of a freight forwarder. I was in general cargo where from 9 to 5 or 6 in the afternoon Los Jolson at night ends the show at 11 at night and from there we go to the airport to assemble pallets or to dispatch, or to load trucks or to go to the next city, eh? If a show ends at eleven o‚Äôclock at night, by eight or nine in the morning, they can be in Guadalajara to unload trucks and ride back. So, the truth.\n\n[00:34:15] 24 hours a day end 24.\n\n[00:34:18] Yes, yes, my doctor, if not\n\n[00:34:19] There are no weekends either, because you have to\n\n[00:34:21] To be full the\n\n[00:34:22] Friday. Where there are more events the\n\n[00:34:24] Weekend, weekends. Yes, my doctor one day recently told me well, before, just before the pandemic, he told me it would be good for you to take a month off. At what time?\n\n[00:34:36] I don‚Äôt have one hahaha\n\n[00:34:38] Shape. And I took a year off at the end.\n\n[00:34:41] What is it that we had no other choice? The truth this what? What‚Äôs the most? Let‚Äôs say the two aprontar 2 things met. 1 is what you appreciate the most? Do you value such a rigorous lifestyle in many things? And what is it that really at certain times in that stage of your life you say I‚Äôm really tired already, I‚Äôd like to have a little more of this than the good and the better and the\n\n[00:35:08] Bad of what to see today what goes. The good thing is that no two shows are the same. And so as ei probecho managers, I love them. There are people I‚Äôd rather have than 90. But it‚Äôs like everything is normal. You can‚Äôt be okay with everything. The good thing in both cases is that the show has a schedule, a limit and from there the show ends and they go to another country. And maybe for him to come back with another tour, that same production manager, it could be two or three, five years or he only came once. Eh? I don‚Äôt like routines, it doesn‚Äôt suit me. That is, me. I need to change from just doing a show at the forum, just at the Metropolitano, at the Auditorio Nacional, it already changes, but it already changes the rhythm. No, no, it‚Äôs not the same deliveries all the time in the same place. There are times when we move 500 kilos. There are times when we move 70 trucks. We do not make one of our customers. But let him go on, they‚Äôve already started drinking again. It‚Äôs Cirque du Soleil. The second Soley are between 70 and 100 containers, not 98 was the tour with more containers and the same thing happens. In other words, there is a delivery order. And a container is multiplied by ninety-eight. Sure, but there comes a point where I actually plan, for example, one of the planning, instead of having one person going through container numbers, I put in four because I know there‚Äôs no way to list 100 containers. There‚Äôs no way you can‚Äôt miss a number. After all that time, I didn‚Äôt\n\n[00:37:00] Everything that adds to your audience. I mean, this is you talking on the basis that at some point you probably already, it already happened to you that you didn‚Äôt feel like the right number.\n\n[00:37:09] Yes, with and especially with the Big Numbers on the trucks.\n\n[00:37:13] Well, if you tell me ok. And something that keygen you could save yourself. And well, I know you‚Äôre passionate about the industry and I know your career is impressive from any angle one looks at it. But if you were mine, if I could change anything about this industry, the best thing would be this or your life rhythm or your.\n\n[00:37:32] What I‚Äôm not doing so much anymore. It is to go in the evenings to? I mean, even though I go to concerts, of course. But I already stay doing public relations more than climbing on trucks.\n\n[00:37:47] Disassembling the disassembling, the scenarios and the\n\n[00:37:52] Perfect leaving my unless he is the next manager, he is a very good friend of mine. And now let‚Äôs help you load your V√°clav or lighting trucks or give me a couple of trucks. I‚Äôll help you in any way I can, of course, but I try not to go to the airports to do customs. I‚Äôm more aware of I‚Äôm more in the house.\n\n[00:38:19] Now tell me a little bit about your transition or well, you‚Äôve moved on to owning your own company. And well, with Temari tell me a little more blocking hours, who they are, what they do, and so on.\n\n[00:38:31] In 2009, what was it about influenza in Mexico? I was in a serious slump. We were. The truth is that we were doing very well. The flu came and I had to run. I had to kick several people out of the team because I didn‚Äôt bravia it, an uncertain future. And they make me an offer to buy my shares, the same people from rocking charges. So I said well, I‚Äôm going to take a break. My head didn‚Äôt explode, but it wasn‚Äôt far off. I imagine, because if it is, if there‚Äôs a lot of pressure,\n\n[00:39:13] I guess so\n\n[00:39:14] There‚Äôs a lot of pressure, so, well, I sell my shares and go do other things in other businesses. But it didn‚Äôt fill me up, I wasn‚Äôt lacking. Then, in the year two thousand and twelve, which was when my gift with Pitts expired. With the people of Rocking. And talking to a psychologist in therapy, I said well, I still can‚Äôt find what it is that I don‚Äôt? So what course is good, what do you like to do? I tell the truth, I like the entertainment, the logistics. Well, why don‚Äôt you come back with something small and come up with the idea of putting together a very small company, eh? Doing a couple of Salmes shows. With that, it‚Äôs like Jorge is left with peace of mind, right? And well, we started to grow. No more, we don‚Äôt stay here anymore.\n\n[00:40:14] And inevitably, knowing you, we couldn‚Äôt rest easy.\n\n[00:40:17] Inevitably you start to grow and well. Alas, alas! Haha We are already a big competitor in the market. I don‚Äôt say worldwide, but within Latin America. E. We do account as Solei, we do Luis Miguel, we have not seen and it is\n\n[00:40:38] Well there and now, before we go on with our own and if it‚Äôs okay with you, give me about 30 seconds, we‚Äôre going to do a commercial break quickly like this and now we‚Äôll come back for everybody who‚Äôs listening. This is Supply Chain Now in English. I hope you are enjoying this talk as much as I am. Many, many thanks to Jorge for sharing so many adventures and stories and experiences. Jorge Cosac Supply Chain Now in Spanish Thanks again for joining us. My name is Enrique Alvarez with Supli Chain Now in Spanish and today I have the great pleasure and honor of interviewing Jorge Cosac from PRO-PIO East. Jorge, thank you for joining us again.\n\n[00:41:25] A pleasure, you know.\n\n[00:41:27] Let‚Äôs go on, let‚Äôs talk about proco now. What do they do for the person who has just listened to us or for the person who has perhaps been living in the caves for the last few years? What do you do pro-poorly and how do you. How would you define your company?\n\n[00:41:43] Let‚Äôs see, we are a transport and logistics company specializing in the entertainment industry sports, music, theater, etc.. And I think our great virtue or our great and our great and our great axis of business are temporary imports. Ninety-nine percent of the imports we make are temporary e. Mexico entered in the year 2011 e to use the famous ATA carnet, which I since I arrived in Mexico, I am in communications or in talks with the Chamber of Commerce e. And it is a tool today that serves us a lot to do that importing.\n\n[00:42:34] What is it. What is the ATA carnet for people who are not in Mexico but are hosted in Latin America?\n\n[00:42:40] The ATA notebook is an eh. It is an instrument that protects the equipment. It‚Äôs like a passenger‚Äôs plane ticket. This. This is a list approved by the Chamber of Commerce and customs of each country so that this list can go from country to country. In temporary importation. Without receiving any change. The seiner use goes into instruments, they are used for a concert and the same instruments come out again. Then c, c, c. The fact that one can do the process without a customs broker, and I am not saying that customs brokers were not going to help us, it does not speed up, it speeds up the process a lot, eh? On tour in countries, sure, sure. Mexico of South America, Mexico. Well, the first one was Chile. Chile was the first country to start with the ATA notebook. Second, it was Mexico. Third, Brazil.\n\n[00:43:57] And now they told me everything. Everyone has it or\n\n[00:44:01] It is not sixty-odd countries. From South America, only Chile, Brazil and Mexico. The rest of us continue with temporary imports.\n\n[00:44:14] Hey, and you‚Äôve seen a lot of companies in your career? Participated in countless tours, with different styles, different artists, different ways of doing things. If you were to extrapolate something from your experience and say hey, I think the most important element for one of these tours to be successful or for the people who perceive it to think it‚Äôs successful. What would it be? What does a company have to have to be successful in the range of event logistics, in particular the company?\n\n[00:44:54] One is to be available 24 hours a day. Planning. E? A little bit of street, having gone out. Out on the road, eh? Knowing that everything you plan. It has, it has. It has moments where we see a trailer, it has a flat tire, of course, eh? And make plan for vacation plans. I think that‚Äôs a critical issue. For example, they give me a list of a tour and I number you the ten, twelve, fifteen moments where you have to pay more attention. Because something is going to happen. Something is going to happen. Michon a couple of years ago, something happened to me that in my career of almost thirty years had not happened to me, that a truck driver ran out of BISSELL.\n\n[00:45:58] It is that if there is no plan to\n\n[00:46:01] Plot, eh? Well, the C.U. plan. Yes we were able to buy this bezel on the road, but the truth I while we were waiting for the say this one to arrive. I‚Äôm usually on the big tours and this was a circuit. I go as the last vehicle pushing those who are lagging behind. Don‚Äôt be yes. If I separate a convoy to eat, I stand with them and I‚Äôm kind of pushing everyone, right? And I pull the last convoy on a climb. A truck pulls up and I said there was a basic malfunction, I start talking on the phone, we do this whole thing, our safety plan, our signage, etcetera that we have. And I tell the driver what happened to him? I was left without a saying.\n\n[00:46:50] Tell me there‚Äôs no light bulb. Didn‚Äôt you see the little bit that Hawker turned on?\n\n[00:46:55] I mean, in my 30 year career I mean it‚Äôs never happened to me before. I say good,\n\n[00:47:03] But that‚Äôs the way it is, isn‚Äôt it? And this gives us a very good start to the year. To the past year that we lived\n\n[00:47:09] As we have to check whether or not the operators have gasoline, the operators. Obviously from there I wrote it down and my people now get in the truck to see if they have gas. It has never happened to me anywhere in the world that a chauffeur, which is what he does.\n\n[00:47:31] He was probably too entertained listening to his Spanish platinum on his radio and probably didn‚Äôt notice. Surely there is no other option. Hey, Jorge, this then availability, planning, communication, experience, but planning, planning, planning. What did you mention?\n\n[00:47:48] Plan, plan? Yes, yes,\n\n[00:47:50] Tell us about last year. Changing the subject a bit, this one year caught us by surprise several this one. Tell us a little bit about the effects, what you learned, how you managed to get ahead with your industry and your company being so dependent on people‚Äôs events? Having fun together?\n\n[00:48:14] Basically, still. We are not out yet, we are still in the process of. But let‚Äôs see, the first thing we did eh was to go down. In other words, as soon as the pandemic started, we went downstairs, we closed the office physically, everyone went home and we did the zum. Obviously it was one of the great clear tools to be able to make meetings and everything. Eh? One of the first things we had to do was to return teams to their non-Firas hometowns, which were in process, and so on. That kind of gave us a first east. E. As common, as an end, an end pals pus of today aisles vain.\n\n[00:49:09] What they tell you that you have, that as they are imported temporarily, if you don‚Äôt pass the concert you have some regulation there that you have to take it out. You have to be\n\n[00:49:16] Right. If there is already\n\n[00:49:18] Certain time\n\n[00:49:19] Or a certain amount of time. Sins In Mexico a temporary import is 6 months, extend it to one year and then you could another six months. But you have to do everything a fool eh? No, but the tours that were on tour we had to return the teams to their home city. E. And I think that, well, we didn‚Äôt say well, what do we do? Because the music industry does not work and we set up temporarily until our business returns, a Sanitation company. We didn‚Äôt buy some equipment and say well, we have to at least keep people busy. We talked to the people, we said don‚Äôt despair. It has to happen, of course, one month domes in six months, in a year, two years, three years, whatever, like you said. I think it‚Äôs very accurate. People. It is, let‚Äôs say, we are. We are people who want to get together and face to face I think it‚Äôs\n\n[00:50:29] Of course, it‚Äôs part of being human,\n\n[00:50:30] As long as it‚Äôs mandatory, I mean, I remember. Well, here, when the restaurants opened, even if it‚Äôs only 30 percent, they were full because people want to go out, right? Eh? I think we learned or are going to learn to live with it. With COBIT, eh? While I think it will not be eternal, eh? I was reading that today is already in phase 2 Phase 1 medicine not the not the vaccine, but the medicine, eh? And I think that‚Äôs going to help a lot, eh? The great hope is that New Zealand is already doing concerts of 30,000 people without social distancing, without mouthpieces, because they have super controlled the COBIT and it will help a lot to the small bands and local bands. I think it‚Äôs going to take two years for a big band to come back, at least not the smaller bands. They are going to be, I think, the most benefited to do local shows.\n\n[00:51:39] And they can take advantage of this vacuum left for them. Right. Then you believe. Do you think we will see new talent in this in new local bands? I think so. They will become the new Soda Stereo or the new right order.\n\n[00:51:56] I think there‚Äôs going to be a lot of bands that are unknown today, but since there‚Äôs no one coming from somewhere else, they‚Äôre going to make the small bands, eh? It‚Äôs actually happening in New Zealand. I mean, the 30 thousand people shows are with local bands, local Klout bands, local bands, that I think that up on the Horny stage, the guys in the band thought that at some point in their life they were going to play in front of 30,000 people.\n\n[00:52:25] Wow, that‚Äôs that‚Äôs something positive about everything that‚Äôs happened. I think this is something, something that we can rescue from what is happening. You who have. You who have learned to leave to the real course of this year, something that you had in your team, or in your company or in yourself e\n\n[00:52:43] To be able to change from one minute to the next. That is, to say ok, this, let‚Äôs have it on stand by. In other words, let‚Äôs try to make a load. None of the team likes to be general cargo. I must admit, we are very bad used to that we like the show bisnes, we like to work at night and when they start to put us in routines we are not even competitive, no, eh? And we said well, let‚Äôs get together. We all said well, what do we do, eh? What does the medium need to return? Disinfection, time for us to start, make a base of everything we are looking for. So, if you go to the PRO-PIO website, we are lost. Now in two, in two parts. One is the transport company and the other is a company of that legislation that I expect. I wish the sooner we stop the annihilations it‚Äôs going to mean we get back to the show laughs.\n\n[00:53:44] In fact, I went to your site in preparation for this interview and looked at the machines a bit. Don‚Äôt they look a bit like a combination of metal detector and showers? Almost, almost not? And tell us a little bit more about that, because I think at the end of the day I think being an entrepreneur like you are, I think seeing an adversity like the coron√É virus and moving your business from something you were doing in a month to change something that‚Äôs radically different is admirable and I think there‚Äôs a lot of possible learnings from that. Then you can tell us a little bit about it. How? How do you see this part of Sanitas Sanitizacion? I think it would be interesting for the audience\n\n[00:54:27] What we wanted to do was to look for the best system for disinfection and we got some machines that are cabins that instead of watering you with disinfectant liquid and we did a whole study of which disinfectant is the best? Eh? More or less harmful, eh? Here we find a liquid called hypochlorite, which is a liquid that is produced by the human body precisely to attack viruses, bacteria and pathogens that enter the human body. It is used by surgeons to heal wounds. It is used in the disinfection of mouths. Dentists. Very, very good product, eh? And machines instead of spraying. It is an ultrasonic atomization system which means that although it is still water, the drop is broken into millions of particles and a fog is generated. That fog is enveloping. 360 degrees. Then you don‚Äôt have to walk around, it doesn‚Äôt get you wet anymore. No, no, but if a layer of disinfection is formed\n\n[00:55:49] That would be well alien to it, ports and obviously concerts. In other words, it is not only for Colona Virus Mexico can not treat other types of viruses or it is unique.\n\n[00:56:00] And exclusively how to wash your hands when they say wash your hand with soap and water. It‚Äôs the same thing. And we‚Äôre doing a lot of streaming. We are renting the booths for streaming. Not to do this one, since we‚Äôre in the middle of nowhere.\n\n[00:56:15] Sure, that‚Äôs not a good match. At the end of the day,\n\n[00:56:18] A good complement, because for movies the people who are making Netflix movies, movies of movies, Entrev√≠ concerts everything that are streamings today that rent a forum and do streaming, we put machines and sanitized. Now we also did the golf event in Cancun. There we had to move, charge the TV station. But they are already sporting events without people.\n\n[00:56:55] Sure, sure, you move the team, but you don‚Äôt,\n\n[00:56:58] We will no longer make the team. Yes. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre going to do the tournament purely without an audience. It is already being discussed. We are officials in Mexico of the NFL, because all the games, the NFL is up to us to do it where all the logistics of not only what they bring cargo, but the coordination of the teams, that the airport arriving and departing. So, already talking to the directors of NFL Mexico, they said I don‚Äôt want to advance anything, but we are moving forward. Let them see that the United States is doing very well with the vaccination issue and I believe that they are not going to transmit it if they are going to vaccinate us soon. And there is great hope that in November of this year we can have an NFL game.\n\n[00:57:48] It would be excellent and good Mary Bethlehem would be that they are good. I think you have a very good pulse on when these events are going to start up again, because obviously what you‚Äôre all about and it‚Äôs good news, this has been a very, very good interview on many sides, including the good news that you share with everybody.\n\n[00:58:07] Announcement America, I think it‚Äôs going to start. This is in the summer of this year with kids show,\n\n[00:58:15] But already congregate with spectators\n\n[00:58:17] And if I‚Äôm not, we already did, we already quoted several Mexican artist tours in the United States. Cabito for me is a very good, very good. Very good sign, well there are. While there are festivals that put them on and cancel them now of the new wave. In Europe they are falling back. Eh? I think the whole world wants to be vaccinated as soon as possible. Yes, it also requires a logistical issue. While so much can be produced, there are things that can‚Äôt happen so fast. But I think that the pace at which the world is going in some countries more or less, but I think it is quite advanced. And and. And the fact of having a light at the end of the tunnel. I think that pushes OK more. Ha ha. It‚Äôs getting closer and closer.\n\n[00:59:14] Okay Jorge, thank you very much. Two more questions for you. One. Today we have many young people who listen to us and follow Supply Chain Now. What would you say to a young person who has just graduated, who is interested in logistics, who is interested in Supply Chain? And after having listened to you, you will surely be interested in this particular branch of logistics for shows and events. What would you recommend to a young person who wants to get into our industry?\n\n[00:59:44] E? E. That to one is the subject of sleep. There are no timetables. If we are looking to work from 9am to 6pm,\n\n[01:00:00] It‚Äôs just that this isn‚Äôt your yes, it‚Äôs not bad.\n\n[01:00:02] On the contrary, I think the opposite. In fact, I know a lot of people, a lot of friends who want to join. That is, a lot of people. Friends, I mean, not children of friends, eh? And as soon as they start to see the dynamic, nothing. I prefer something a little more structured. While this is structured e. Let‚Äôs go from one. From one side to the other. Eh? I remember last year between January and March, which was March 14, when I returned to Mexico because of the Hotel Corona Virus E issue. I‚Äôd already done 60,000 miles on flights, waj. I mean, yeah, yeah. There comes a time when you wake up in a hotel at 3 o‚Äôclock in the morning and you wonder where am I?\n\n[01:00:57] So one is that, to have the. The desire to work hard and long hours\n\n[01:01:05] And long hours and long hours and no and you know when you wake up, but you never know what time you‚Äôre going to go to sleep. And if you have ten minutes to take a snooze at some point haddock bechara Jorge?\n\n[01:01:22] Well, thank you very much. And well, you heard him. That‚Äôs the advice from a person who has been very successful in this industry. Jorge this where they can contact you, where they can contact you. If there‚Äôs someone who would love you\n\n[01:01:36] Contact my mail are Jorge Jorge Arroba own dot MX.\n\n[01:01:42] You heard him, huh?
