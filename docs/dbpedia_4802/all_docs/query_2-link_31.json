After the group was banned and its mosque closed, at least 15 of the approximately 50 presumed group members left Germany to support jihadi terrorist organizations in Syria/Iraq.

From September 2011 to August 2012, Millatu Ibrahim published 420 videos on one of its core websites (Al-Ghurabaa), of which 270 were produced by the leading trio of the group: Hasan Keskin, Denis Cuspert, and Mohamed Mahmoud. Most of these videos were also posted on YouTube. Based on screenshots of the website at different points in time, we were able to quantify the group’s posting activities. Each post was then assigned to a specific category, allowing us to analyze the frequency of a posted topic across time.42 Figure 8.1 Page 196 →shows a timeline of events related to Millatu Ibrahim’s lifespan and the development of its online activism. The blue curve represents the number of video statements and lectures published on its website, Al-Ghurabaa, with blue dots indicating when screenshots for data collection were taken.\n\n1.

For instance, operating a radical organization and evading government surveillance (e.g., via the establishment of safe houses) ought to become less expensive when socioeconomic conditions are unfavorable. This is because popular support for terrorism is expected to increase when economic conditions are poor and more potential radicals start to radicalize, which ought to dilute counter-radicalism efforts.8"
