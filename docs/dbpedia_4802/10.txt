The president of the autonomous Spanish city of Melilla, Juan José Imbroda, has made a formal request to the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) for the World Cup 2018 qualifying game between Spain and Albania next October to be hosted in the North African exclave.

Speaking to reporters, Imbroda confirmed that he has submitted a formal written petition to the president of the RFEF, Angel María Villar, describing the “old aspiration” of the Spanish territory to host a Spain game, adding “and if it is in an official competition, so much the better.”

"Good chance" of game being staged in Melilla

Imbroda said Melilla has “a good chance” of being selected to host Albania and offered to “happily” send along all the technical reports and requirements that are necessary.

“It would be wonderful news for Melilla for the Spanish national team to play here and from our side we will do everything possible to make that happen,” Imbroda said.

Melilla’s largest stadium, the 12,000 seater Estadio Municipal Álvarez Claro, is the home ground of Segunda B side UD Melilla.
