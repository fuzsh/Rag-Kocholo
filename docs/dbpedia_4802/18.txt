Friday morning's Copa del Rey draw has given UD Melilla cause to celebrate after they were paired with Real Madrid for the what will be the first ever meeting between the sides at the Estadio Municipal Alvarez Claro.

The ground is expected to produce a monumental atmosphere for the home fixture, and the club are even looking at plans to construct temporary stands within the stadium to boost the overall capacity.

Melilla will also look to push the social boundaries that sport can improve, especially at a time when the city is at the centre of rather unfortunate headlines that aren't related to football.

Luis Carrion, the club's coach, made clear just how delighted he was to face the European Champions, and he feels as though the encounter will do wonders for the city.

"We're happy for the city, it was a dream to get to this round," he admitted.

"The best team in Europe last season are coming and we will show that we know how to compete."

These sentiments were echoed by club president, Luis Manuel Rincon, who described the feeling around the organisation as like being on cloud nine.

"We've got the big prize, we're on cloud nine at this moment," he confirmed.

"6000 fans is our capacity, and we're going to try and expand it.

"They are going to take away a different image than what they believe Melilla to be."
