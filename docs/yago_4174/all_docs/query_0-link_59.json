        "text": "Charpentier, who wrote his own libretto, was unusual among French opera composers of the time in focusing Louise exclusively on working-class people. That includes the seamstress protagonist, a heroine who has long attracted American sopranos. One of the early twentieth century’s greatest singing actresses, Mary Garden (Scottish-born American), who really put this opera on the map, has been succeeded by Grace Moore, Dorothy Kirsten, Arlene Saunders, Beverly Sills, Carol Neblett, and Renée Fleming.\n\nKirsten, a favorite diva in San Francisco for more than three decades, sang Louise’s 1947 company premiere and reprised the role seven years later. Following her in 1967 was the equally ravishing Saunders, leading soprano of the Hamburg State Opera. After waiting 32 years for another superb Louise, San Francisco Opera finally found her: Fleming (see sidebar below), whose role debut highlighted a burgeoning career that, a few seasons previously, had ascended from stardom to superstardom.\n\nThe unique warmth of Fleming’s vocalism is a joy from her very first entrance, shortly after the curtain rises. Later, in Act II, listen for one of many luminous examples of the soprano’s ease in floating softer phrases: Louise’s declaration to Julien, “Je serai ta femme” (“I will be your wife”). In that act’s final moments, note how a single word from Fleming—the spoken “Adieu!”—can convey both the anxiety and the excitement that Louise feels in leaving her job and her family to join Julien.\n\nFleming has everything for her role’s challenging second half. No doubt the entire audience was breathlessly awaiting Louise’s Act III aria “Depuis le jour,” already closely identified with Fleming in concerts, recitals, and on CD. Sopranos must negotiate the aria with the ultimate in musical and interpretive sensitivity, knowing exactly how to maintain a perfect balance between intimacy and grand-scale passion. Fleming accomplishes this ideally, letting every phrase radiate the ecstasy of the moment and crowning the performance with her resplendent leap to a sustained high B.\n\nMore thrills lie ahead with the “Libre! Vous êtes libre!” section of the extended love scene with Julien, where Louise is at her most vocally expansive. Here Fleming’s outpouring of glorious sound never becomes an end in itself, but rather delineates the character’s total capitulation to awakening love. Louise must throw caution to the winds in Act IV, as she explodes with a desperate longing to flee her overprotective parents and return to Julien. The finale gives us Fleming at her most powerfully dramatic, with both the technical security and the all-out abandon for what is certainly the most taxing portion of the role.\n\nLouise was the last of six operas sung in San Francisco since 1988 by the late Jerry Hadley (1952–2007). Prior to Julien, the company had showcased Hadley’s artistry in portrayals of two other French heroes—Des Grieux and Hoffmann—as well as three longtime signature roles: Tom Rakewell, Tamino, and Nemorino.\n\nMeaningful, crystal-clear text was always Hadley’s hallmark in any role, including Julien. As he vividly delivers that marvelous phrase, “le chant de victoire de notre amour triomphant” (“the song of the victory of our triumphant love”), the poet’s adoration of Louise becomes almost palpable. His ardent nature and natural high spirits register as strongly as his urgency when attempting to persuade Louise to run away with him. Of course, Julien’s devotion to his city indelibly colors the character. This proves especially memorable when the clarion-voiced Hadley—together with Fleming—sings ecstatically in unison, at the height of their Act III duet, “Paris! Paris! Cité de force et de lumière!” (“Paris! Paris! City of strength and light!”).\n\nLouise’s mother is the least vocally demonstrative of the four key roles, but she’s formidable nonetheless, and unsympathetic for much of the opera. This character profits immeasurably from the multi-hued mezzo-soprano of Dame Felicity Palmer (see Palmer Q&A in the Rabbit Hole), previously hailed in San Francisco for La fille du régiment (1993) and Rusalka (1995). Palmer also gives an astonishingly detailed, line-by-line response to the French text, shaping it so authentically that one can scarcely believe the singer isn’t a native Frenchwoman. Charpentier has set the first words of the Act III intervention a cappella – “Je ne viens pas en ennemie” (“I haven’t come as an enemy”); here Palmer is extraordinarily intense, yet never once pushing for effect. When the mother admits how she and her husband felt when Louise left them, the sadness coloring “Elle était morte pour nous” (“She was dead to us”) communicates a heartrending finality.\n\nLike Fleming, Hadley, and Palmer, Samuel Ramey was making a role debut. His portrayal of Louise’s father was something of a nod to San Francisco Opera’s history, if we remember that the legendary Ezio Pinza sang the role in the company’s first Louise. These two basses have often been compared, each possessing luxurious tone, flawless technique, and electrifying charisma. Prior to Louise, Ramey—who debuted as Colline in La bohème in 1978-79—had starred in San Francisco as the Hoffmann villains, Boris Godunov, and Attila.\n\nAs with the three other principals, Ramey’s distinctive timbre instantly attracts the listener’s attention. Charpentier doesn’t really allow the father to come fully into his own until Act IV, which he dominates throughout. While singing magnificently, Ramey also probes deeply in his lengthy aria, bringing affecting soulfulness to the lullaby-like passage the father sings to his beloved Louise. In the opera’s final ten minutes, with the vocal line turning much more baritonal, Ramey remains unfazed, as the father becomes increasingly enraged by his daughter’s defiance.\n\nLouise includes too many supporting roles to name here, but among them are numerous vendors, an urchin, a streetsweeper, and a songwriter, as well as a debonair charmer written for lyric tenor and mysteriously identified as “A Noctambulist.” That character has previously lured away the daughter of the ragman. The latter role, meant for an especially full-toned bass, recalls that sad event in the still point of Act II’s first scene: a brooding, pained lament, movingly sung in 1999 by Kevin Langan.\n\nOf all the episodes focused on supporting roles, especially exhilarating is the seamstresses’ workshop (Act II, Scene 3), where Louise’s eight colleagues chatter and gossip. Musically speaking, the heart of the scene belongs to Irma, one of opera’s most rewarding cameo roles for soprano. A truly blooming lyric voice is needed, one that can convincingly describe Paris as “the voice of pleasure and love” in her soaringly romantic ariette. Donita Vokwijn sings it radiantly in the San Francisco performance.\n\nWith so many other small but telling roles, major companies presenting Louise have always cast it in depth. San Francisco Opera certainly took this to heart in 1999—for example, by inviting a prominent leggero tenor from Belgium, Marc Laho, to make his U.S. operatic debut as the King of Fools in Act III. In addition to Langan and Volkwijn, among the other exceptionally gifted American artists here who went on to impressive careers were mezzos Catherine Cook and Judith Christin, tenors Jay Hunter Morris and Norman Shankle, and baritones James Westman and John Fanning.\n\nMorris, who sang the Noctambulist, remembers “[director] Lotfi Mansouri had me on a small platform, like a soapbox, and I remember being so nervous that I’d fall off.” The costume was “tails, cape, cane, top hat, and, I think, a fake mustache, like a carnival barker.” The tenor felt “terrified and intimidated” working with the starry leading quartet, but gratified to be onstage with Hadley, one of his most important mentors. “I also hadn’t sung much in French. [Conductor] Patrick Summers is a strict taskmaster, and when you’re the rookie, you’re also often the whipping boy, so I had to work very hard. Lotfi was my champion, and he was always so full of joy.”\n\nThe performance is anchored throughout by Summers, at the time just beginning his first season as the Company’s principal guest conductor. Louise, his sixteenth San Francisco Opera production, was also his fourth in French, following Faust, Carmen, and Guillaume Tell. He captures Charpentier’s elusive conversational style—especially in the “local color” vignettes—as persuasively as the most musically grandiose climaxes. In Act III, the gathering of Montmartre’s denizens to crown Louise as “Muse of the Sacred Hill” offers an irresistible exuberance perfectly fitting this raucous scene. Then, in the final act, as Louise and her father reach peaks of anger and resentment, Summers draws genuinely hair-raising playing from his orchestra, totally attuned to the scalding final confrontation between the father and daughter.\n\nStreaming San Francisco Opera’s Louise broadcast will surely delight everyone who loves French opera. If you were in the theater in 1999, savor this chance to relive the glories of that performance. And if Louise is new to you, prepare yourself for enchantment, Parisian style. Amusez-vous bien!\n\n******\n\nSinging Louise: A CLOSER LOOK\n\nWhen she starred at San Francisco Opera as Charpentier’s Louise, Renée Fleming was already a greatly acclaimed artist with the company. Beginning in 1990, she’d triumphed in Le nozze di Figaro, Hérodiade, The Dangerous Liaisons (world premiere), Rusalka, and A Streetcar Named Desire (world premiere).\n\nWhen I spoke with Fleming about Louise in the spring of 2022, she recalled finding the role (which, to date, she has performed only in San Francisco) heavier than other French heroines she’d sung previously: Gounod’s Marguerite and Massenet’s Salomé (Hérodiade), Manon, and Thaïs. “Louise is long, it’s more dramatic, the orchestration is bigger, and the opera’s final scene is very intense,” commented the soprano. Fleming also remembered, with some amusement, the dinner shared by Louise and her parents in the last act of San Francisco Opera’s production: “A restaurant was found that could create exactly the right dish—a cassoulet [stew with meat, pork skins, and white beans]. Cassoulet isn’t the best meal if you want to fit into your costumes!”\n\nSinging “Depuis le jour” onstage in context for the first time delighted Fleming (“Being in Montmartre, looking down on the city of Paris is quite romantic”). In Charpentier’s working-class heroine she found an appeal in the role similar to that of Puccini’s Mimì, another seamstress trying to survive. “At that time, there was this fascination and romance about the lower socio-economic strata—the ‘starving artist.’ Look at the paintings of the period, with so many milliners and women working in dress shops. Louise was also a young woman, so she didn’t have autonomy—not enough of a say in the choices that others were trying to make for her.”\n\nFleming cherished her Louise colleagues. She’d already been thrilled by Samuel Ramey, with whom she’d collaborated at other companies in Faust and Le nozze di Figaro. She was riveted by the stage presence of Felicity Palmer, and by the mezzo’s eloquent way with the French text. The soprano loved working with Jerry Hadley, whom she’d admired ever since hearing his Tom Rakewell years before: “What he could do with his voice—the refinement, the risk-taking—was spectacular. That was why he became a star.” Fleming remembers Lotfi Mansouri as a truly collaborative director, and conductor Patrick Summers (with whom Fleming developed a close, ongoing association), she found “smart, incredibly erudite, with tremendous historical knowledge of repertoire in general—really a pleasure.”\n\nThe fact that Louise turns up so rarely isn’t lost on Fleming. She confesses to disappointment that the repertoire is shrinking, “because people who love opera do want to hear other things, not just the top ten!”\n\nRoger Pines, who recently concluded a 23-year tenure as dramaturg of Lyric Opera of Chicago, is a contributing writer to Opera News, Opera (U.K.), and programs of opera companies and recordings internationally. He has been on the faculty of Northwestern University’s Bienen School of Music for the past three years.\n\nBy The Earl of Harewood\n\nIt's an odd thought that in the realm of opera, Boito, an Italian intellectual who wanted to reform Italian art and offended Verdi with his efforts, and Gustave Charpentier, an ardent socialist, should each be remembered for a single more-or-less repertory opera (Mefistofele in one case, Louise in the other) and virtually nothing else. Odd, too, that each composer wrote a second opera - Boito's Nerone was championed by Toscanini, and Charpentier's Julien had Caruso and Farrar in its Metropolitan premiere cast—but they have virtually disappeared. Boito lived to well over 70 years of age, but spent most of his life re-writing and polishing music he had already written, and Charpentier, who survived to 95, did much the same. Boito at least was an expert librettist, for others as well as for himself, but Charpentier claimed that his work was so autobiographical that he needed ten years between works in order to have lived sufficient new material to start again!\n\nAs a young man, Charpentier was out to shock—this was the period of Emile Zola—but after he joined Massenet's composition class, he subdued early instincts sufficiently to win in 1887 the Prix de Rome, the much sought-after prize whereby young French composers were allowed a free stay in the Eternal City. In Rome, he seems to have embarked on three works which became not so much central to his oeuvre as to have constituted the major part of it: the orchestral Impressions d'ltalie, which Debussy liked; the symphonic drama La Vie du Poete, which was some years later to form the basis of Julien; and Louise itself. These three works became a kind of musical quarry from which he hewed the material for everything else he wrote. Even here, a major hiccup nearly supervened. So enamored of his adopted Montmartre had he become (his family left the Moselle area to escape German occupation in 1870) that legend has it he three times fled from the station before finally catching the train to Italy!\n\nCharpentier was socially aware and nothing if not a believer in his own preaching. Within weeks of the premiere of Louise he was giving away 400 seats to dressmakers and in 1902 he founded the Conservatoire Mimi Pinson in order to provide free artistic education for the working girls of Paris. About women's emancipation and the poverty of the working classes he felt passionately and it was in Louise that he gave most effective voice to this commitment. The opera is centrally concerned with a realistic depiction of life in the Paris he adored, but he had already composed a large­scale Fete du Couronnement de la Muse for an open-air ceremony in Montmartre, and when he was urged to give his opera more variety, he incorporated it in the third act of his opera, and with it introduced an element of symbolism, or at least of unreality, into the realistic action. The mixture, which could have been an uneasy one, is worked with more than a little skill: realism dominating the outer acts and the atelier of Act II, symbolism taking over with the intertwined figures of the surreal Night-Prowler (the so-­called \"Noctambule\"), who stands for the evils of Paris, which Charpentier deplored, and for free love, which he endorsed, and the King of the Fools, who in the Couronnement presides over the city's glamour. \"When, in the second act, street criers and workers crawl like insects from the woodwork, the two ingredients mingle easily and the mixture they make emerges half-actual, half-allegorical, with a taste and scent all its own.\n\nAfter the first night of Louise, Paul Dukas, a composer five years younger than Charpentier (who was then forty), pronounced an elegant verdict: \"The first and last acts are those of a master; the other two are those of an artist; the whole is the work of a man.\" It is an interesting judgment and it suggests that the younger composer found a dichotomy in the work, preferring the out-and-out realism of Acts I and IV to the elements of fantasy to be found in parts (but only parts) of Acts II and III. We may agree, but also note in passing that Dukas's only opera, Ariane et Barbe-bleue, is itself the ultimate in symbolism. I find the contrasting elements Charpentier introduced into Louise are there for good reason and demonstrate architectural sense uncommon in a first opera though possibly not in a composer in his late thirties.\n\nThe fashion in between-the-wars France, and even earlier, was to decry the music of Louise. On the other hand, Richard Strauss seems to have enjoyed it when Romain Rolland took him to hear it more than his host did, and Mahler conducted it in Vienna within two years of the premiere: Schönberg's pupils stayed behind to applaud after others had gone home, and by 1914 it had been heard in 25 different centers. I was lucky that when I first heard it soon after the war and some time before it was recorded, I had heard no prejudice against it - though prejudice was around at that time even against so obvious a master as Puccini. It was easy then to be immediately struck by the bold arpeggiated figure of the opening and by Julien's appropriation of it in his evening serenade to Louise. Easy, too, to accept Charpentier's use of it as a motif throughout the opera. The lyricism of Julien's exposition to Louise of how he first fell in love has overtones of the operatic mastery of Charpentier's teacher Massenet, and the setting of text throughout is sure and communicative. Impressive as is the early part of Act I, true characterization in depth arrives with the cellos' suggestion of the weighty figure of the Father, with confidence in his own worth and his place—not only in the family, but in society. His opening words: \"Bon soir. La soupe est prête?\" [Good evening. Is the soup ready?] have become a kind of talisman of banality, but the situation is banal, and the Father is presented as a basically contented and resourceful figure. Conversation is convincing, and Charpentier's strength in narrative through music is as sure in its way as Puccini's (they were contemporaries and, for all of Puccini's greater genius, it is hard not to use the comparison). Similar to Wagner, the orchestra's role for Charpentier is much more than that of support; if the quarreling of mother and daughter is a matter of words, the affection between Louise and her father can be sensed from orchestral comment when they are silent.\n\nThe second act is in strong contrast. This is what Louise has been longing for—she says so at the end of Act I—this, as much as the reciprocated love of Julien. The ambivalent figure of the Night-Prowler (that is how we translated the \"Noctambule\" when we did the opera in English in London nearly twenty years ago) has about him an air of menace, and even the street cries are hardly reassuring at first. The scene of the atelier where Louise works represents another change of atmosphere, this time matter-of-fact, and with little suggestion about it of mystery, let alone fantasy. Irma's solo is well disguised at first in the chatter, but during its course comes a foreshadowing of the slow waltz which the aural memory of anyone familiar with Louise will recognize with something like a thrill. With it, the composer later catches the sheer intoxication of Paris which is of course the opera's constant sub-plot.\n\nLike Wagner, Charpentier enjoys introducing a motif which will enjoy greater prominence later, and Act III starts with a pianissimo foreshadowing of what will later become something like the opera's motto: \"Tout être a le droit d'être libre\" [All humans have the right to freedom], enunciated by Julien with the solemnity due to something he not only believes but has perhaps taught Louise by rote. It has the sovereign quality of being not only convincing as a statement (at that time, French law allowed people of either sex to be married only with permission of both parents)—but also musically memorable, though probably not as memorable as Louise's great aria which comes at the very beginning of the act. \"Depuis le jour\" has become as popular as all but the most famous of Puccini arias, and its soaring lyricism suggest a major lyrical invention, greater than what Charpentier achieved elsewhere; a truly glamorous solo. Only less memorable are the cries \"Libres! Libres!\" [We are free!] which represent the climax of the succeeding love duet. The episode of the Couronnement de la Muse is one of the opera's more curious ones, originating as it did as an open-air frolic and containing as it does the other-worldly figure of the Pape des Faus [King of Fools], whose contribution to the drama is at best neutral. Much more to the point at the end is the low-key intervention of the Mother begging Louise to come home in what is little less than a bid to save her dying Father. The original singer of the role of the Mother was the great Deschamps­Jéhin, who eight years earlier had been the first to sing Dalila in Paris and who apparently made a great thing of each of her interventions in this opera. The composer at the act's end allows the slow waltz to take over.\n\nBy the last act, there is little left in the Father of the confident figure of Act I. He has become a grumbler, who is not only sick but down on his luck—\"Les pauvres gens, peuvent-ils étre heureux?\"—[\"Can poor people be happy?\"]—and unable to cope. Nothing in the old man's life seems to give him pleasure any more, until his self­-pity recedes into the relaxed warmth to be found in his Berceuse. Nonetheless, he gets the last word when Louise has fled and he shakes his fist at the seductive city.\n\nIn the end, Charpentier's theme is Paris—his own love story both in the large and the smaller picture (he told Mary Garden he had once loved a seamstress called Louise). His achievement is to suggest a sense of freedom and pleasure against a background of struggle and even misery, a reflection in every detail of his own philosophy. That Louise was a success from the start is probably due as much to its emancipated story and message as to its music, but when in the last act we hear the swirl of the waltz with its call to the pleasures of Paris, it is easy—even a century later—to see how the theme caught the imagination of a whole generation. Here was the pull of the forbidden at its most persuasive, and it still holds today.\n\n* * *\n\nThe original Louise, Louise Rioton, was apparently a singer of charm and skill but without the stamina to stand up to the role's demands for very long. A couple of months after the first night, the Scottish-American soprano Mary Garden was called to replace her after Act II, thus making what was nothing less than her operatic debut singing the aria \"Depuis le jour.\" In her reminiscences, she could not resist gilding the lily and implying that she did it all without rehearsal; contemporary accounts suggest the reverse. Louise remains one of her most celebrated roles and she was the first to sing it in New York, at the Manhattan Opera, eight years later. It has remained a role for a prima donna to cherish, particularly if she was an actress as well—Emmy Destinn sang it in Berlin; Marie Gutheil­Schoder and Leo Slezak with Mahler in Vienna. Conductors have enjoyed it too, and the great Wagnerian Hans Knappertsbusch, notoriously reluctant to rehearse, conducted it in Munich in the 1950s with Leonie Rysanek and Hans Hotter, prepared according to local legend with infinite care and patience.\n\nAmerican sopranos have emulated Garden in the title role, starting with Geraldine Farrar, who was the first to sing it at the Met. Grace Moore sang it in Paris before reviving it at the Met, and even made a film, directed by the great Abel Gance. Judging from records, it was one of her finest roles. She has been followed by Dorothy Kirsten and Beverly Sills, and there is something appropriate that it is American singers more than the French who have made such a feature of a role which remains one of the twentieth century's greatest.\n\n(Lord Harewood had a career in arts administration over many years.

The work of artist Georges Rochegrosse, it depicts solitary young lovers embracing on the hill of Montmartre against a twilight sky and the city lights of Paris glistening below.\n\nThe opera in question is Gustave Charpentier's Louise, chosen as the new work to usher in a new century at the Opéra-Comique in Paris. Its premiere on February 2, 1900, aroused delirious public acclaim, and within a year Louise had achieved over 100 performances at that theater alone. Although that number had increased to nearly 1,000 by the time the composer died at age 96 in 1956, it had by then become something of a period piece—even in France. Louise remains, however, the sole representative of naturalisme—the French cousin of Italian verismo—to occupy a place, however marginal, in the international opera repertory.\n\nIt is a work for which Lotfi Mansouri feels a special affinity and affection. \"I'm very attached to it and I have a very nostalgic feeling for it,\" he states. \"When I directed it for the first time in Geneva in 1966, I had a wonderful cast. Suzanne Sarocca was Louise, Jean Brazzi was Julien, Nicola Rossi-Lemeni was the Father and one of the great French mezzos, Solange Michel, was the Mother. And my Ragpicker was José Van Dam! It was so incredibly, so quintessentially French,\" he adds with a smile. \"I loved doing it and I always wanted to do it again, but with the right cast.\"\n\nMansouri harbored his dream until he could put together just such an ensemble. \"First of all, I thought of Louise for Renée [Fleming]. Doing Louise without a good Louise is like doing Otello without a real Otello. You cannot do it with a very light, lyric voice. People underestimate Louise. Everybody sings 'Depuis le jour.' It's one of the easiest numbers in the opera, if you have the voice for it. But that's misleading. The last act is so dramatic. It's vocally so demanding, with the orchestra going full force. It borders on Elektra, it's so strong. You need a voice like Renée's. You need a soprano with her kind of power and, at the same time, her vulnerability, sweetness and lyricism. So, Renée is for me just ideal, and originally that was the raison d'étre for presenting Louise.\n\n\"Then I thought that Sam [Ramey] would be a wonderful Father. He took to the idea right away; I didn't have to convince him. Of course Jerry [Hadley] makes a charming poète—think of his Rodolfo in Bohème. And for the Mother, I thought of Felicity Palmer. She's such a brilliant actress. She can bring to the role all the colors it requires—the severity, but also the affection.”\n\nMansouri warms to the description of the opera's characters and the dramatic situations in which they find themselves. \"It's all so real and the characterizations are so delicious,\" he enthuses. \"Not only the principals, but also the secondary characters: the Ragpicker, who is kind of a mirror image of the Father; the Newspaper Girl, the Street Urchin, and all the seamstresses, who are all so different from each other . . . The man has written a novel [Charpentier called Louise actually a roman musical or musical novel]. You could do the first act as a play without music, and it would work, as I did once with the first act of Rosenkavalier.\"\n\nAs a director, Mansouri marvels at the incredibly minute details presented by the opera's action. It is all part of the aesthetic of naturalism that pervaded the arts in the late 19th century. \"It comes from Zola and his realistic creations, like Nana and Gervaise,\" states Mansouri. \"Even in the theater at that time things were so minutely detailed and realistic. It was a reaction against early 19th-century romanticism—Victor Hugo's overblown style and all that grand stuff. You no longer have the aristocrats or the bourgeoisie; it's the proletariat, the workers, the troisième classe. And it always stays in the same milieu; it doesn't shift to the bourgeoisie or the upper classes.\"\n\nTaking out a large folder, Mansouri displays its contents with the delight and protectiveness of a proud parent. \"For my opening-night gift in Geneva,\" he says, \"Solange Michel gave me one of the most wonderful gifts that anyone has ever given me—a copy of the original Louise production book. You name it, it's all there: the stage directions, the props, the lighting, the clothes, every character's age and description down to the color of their eyes. When you take a look at Charpentier's character descriptions—they're superb.\"\n\nHe proceeds to read a few examples from the list of secondary roles: Le Chansonnier [Song Writer]—baryton martin [high, light baritone], 25 years old, beardless, jovial, a comic bohemian; Le Gavroche—soprano, 14 years old, street urchin, wily and irreverent, but in no way a hooligan, with a look of suffering that would evoke pity were it not for the ironic smile of the precocious philosopher; Gertrude [one of the seamstresses]—mezzo-soprano, 35 years old, working-class woman, spinster, coquettish, sentimental, ridiculous . . . It's like a casting sheet! And when you look at the props, he's got every little prop listed. I've never seen a production book like this for any opera. [David] Belasco [the American playwright, author of Madame Butterfly and The Girl of the Golden West] used to do this. For his Butterfly, for example, he even has the gels for the lighting cues and where each projector should be placed. When I did Fanciulla, I got hold of Belasco's staging book; you'd be amazed at the details.\"\n\nIn addition to the wealth of useful information and staging indications that can be culled from the Louise production book, the director professes to have learned a lot from Solange Michel, who had worked with Charpentier. \"She told me, for example, details about the meal in Act I—how the Father blesses the dishes, how he serves the soup and then the stew, the lamb stew, mind you.\"\n\nThis \"slice-of-life\" realism runs throughout the opera, and it is clear that as director, Mansouri intends to be as true to Charpentier's conception as possible. When he staged the work in Geneva, he used the production by Maurice Utrillo that was done for the 50th-anniversary production of Louise at the Opéra-Comique. \"Because the Geneva stage is so big compared to the Opéra­Comique, I put the sets into a frame and started each act with a frozen tableau,\" he explains. \"This time, I went to Paris and got Utrillo's original sketches. Though he was a wonderful painter, he wasn't a set designer . . . \"\n\nThe comparison between Utrillo's sketches and the ones for the San Francisco Opera production by Thierry Bosquet immediately point up the difference between painter and set designer. In Utrillo's sketch for the interior of the apartment in Acts I and IV, for instance, there are three blank white walls, three doors and three plain upstage windows, and no furniture. Bosquet's sketch for the apartment, although painterly, is far more colorful, evocative and detailed, with all the furniture and props in place. His set design for the seamstresses' atelier features mannequins, bolts of material and a sewing machine, whose whirring noise forms a sonic background to the early part of the scene. Clearly inspired by the work of the celebrated Montmartre painter, Bosquet successfully attempts to convey an Utrillo-like atmosphere, especially in the Act III set for the Coronation of the Muse.\n\n\"Thierry is the designer,\" says Mansouri, \"and John [Coyne, who was responsible for the revised set designs for the 1999 San Francisco Opera Ring] then translated Thierry's images. John has done all the technical work for Louise and also created new sets for La Favorite, and is designing the Albert Herring sets for our Showcase 2000.\"\n\nBosquet designed not only the sets, but also the costumes for Louise. Like the set sketches, those for the costumes are strikingly realistic, vivid and detailed. \"Thierry discovered a book in Paris with real pictures of the working-class people of the period . . . the ragpicker, the coal gatherer, the milkwoman, the street sweeper, the artichoke vendor,\" Mansouri enumerates as he leafs through the costume sketches one by one. \"Such unbelievable detail . . . I wanted to put a little touch of Mephisto into the Noctambule. He is really a symbolic character, the spirit of Paris. 'Je suis le procureur,' he exclaims—the Seducer. That's why people are a little afraid of him. [The production book describes him as \"Prince Charming . . . symbol of the 'Pleasures of Paris,' a character both mod­ern and mythical, extremely attractive and seductive\"].\n\nLouise has a huge cast. More than 40 solo singing roles are listed, plus chorus and supers, representing various inhabitants of Montmartre: parents and children, young artists and their models, vagrants and prostitutes, strollers and street urchins, etc. \"For some of the smaller roles,\" explains the director, \"we have some wonderful people in the chorus. Then, for some of the secondary roles—Julien's friends, the poets and philosophers, and the girls in the atelier—there are the Adler Fellows. Some of the roles can even be doubled.\n\n\"It's not a small work; it's really a Grand Opéra. It's such a unique piece compared to its contemporaries. It comes just before Pelléas, Salome and Elektra, and was written at the same time as La Bohème.\"\n\nThe comparison and contrast between the Charpentier and Puccini works proves illuminating: both are set in the working-class and bohemian worlds of Paris; both are four-act operas with intimate interior scenes in Acts I and IV framing outdoor scenes in the other acts, one of which depicts communal rejoicing in a festival atmosphere; both deal with struggling young lovers and the forces pulling them apart; both contain passionate, lyrical music of poignant intensity; and both are, at least in part, semi-autobiographical. But there are important differences, as Mansouri points out. \"Bohème is one of the most accessible operas. It's also very economical in its length and characterizations. In many ways, it's a perfect piece. Louise is much more complicated. It has a very rich texture. It also has much more detail. The Bohème plot has lots of holes in it. For example, at the beginning of Act IV, you never know when and how Mimi left Rodolfo after their Act III reconciliation. In Louise, in the little recap between Father and Mother at the start of the last act, you get every little detail. Puccini is a kind of a musical painter with major brush strokes; Charpentier is a pointilliste like the Seurat of Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. It's all those little details that go into making the whole.\"\n\nAlthough the details may point to a specific time and place, Mansouri finds that the story of Louise has a universal appeal and resonance. \"When the opera had its premiere, it caused a scandale,\" he emotes, using the French pronunciation. \"It was the theme of l'amour libre and all that. But look at the 1960s with the flower children and free love and the fact of adolescents leaving their families and going out to live together without getting married. It's the desire of every normal child wanting to have the freedom to fly on his/her own. It's the essential yearning of every human being. The young lovers are real—there's Louise's insecurity and Julien's arrogance and condescending attitude toward the older generation. That's human nature in every society. Whether you're in Iran, or Switzerland, or Canada or the States, it's the same thing between parents and their children, and their children's lovers.\n\n\"The Father's plight and frustration are very moving. The Father must break your heart. On opening night in Geneva, Nicola [Rossi-Lemeni] made me cry when he took Louise in his arms . . . I have a daughter and I relate to the Father very much. It's very human, very real,\" he observes. \"And the Mother. You have to watch out that she doesn't come off as a bitch. She loves her daughter, but her first love is for her husband. She cares about him and the pain he's going through.\"\n\nMansouri appears to have given the opera's denouement much thought. \"There should be a question mark at the end, if you want to be realistic about it,\" he says. \"I don't think they live happily ever after. Julien may have changed his mind waiting for her; he may be with someone else already. Louise is ecstatic because she has her freedom. It's like a bird that flies out of its cage. But what is she flying to? It would be awful to have her rush into Julien's arms at the end. That's much too saccharine. The piece must have its dark side. She may well be headed for unhappiness. You should be ambivalent about it.\n\n\"I think Charpentier had given everything he had in Louise. When he tried to write a sequel in Julien, it didn't work. [The opera had its premiere at the Opéra-Comique in 1913; it was picked up by the Metropolitan Opera the following year with Geraldine Farrar as Louise and Enrico Caruso in the title role, but ran for only five performances.] We looked at it in Geneva to see if we really wanted to do it as a sort of a companion piece. I said 'no.' It would just take away from one's feelings about Louise. After all, there are a lot of composers who have done just one fabulous work and nothing more.\n\n\"Louise requires enormous resources,\" he concludes. \"It's very difficult to cast—there are dozens of roles—and it's expensive to produce. I can more easily put together 10 Rigolettos than I can one Louise. The French repertoire in general is very difficult to do,\" says Mansouri, who has previously directed eleven French works for the San Francisco Opera, including such rarities as Meyerbeer's L'Africaine, Massenet's Esclarmonde and Herodiade, and Rossini's Guillaume Tell. \"You can't throw it together the way you sometimes can with the Italian repertoire. It requires enormous care and detail. And the language is difficult, so it's hard to sound authentic.\n\n\"Some people are so damn condescending about the French repertoire. People misunderstand it and think it's pastel. Like hell it is! Manon and Werther are fabulous pieces of music. If you look at the scores and really do Massenet the way it's written—it's so full of life and unbelievably detailed.\"\n\nAnd Louise? \"It's an opera I just really enjoy. It's so French; it has that wonderful parfum,\" he says with a laugh. \"I hope through this production people will rediscover the opera. When I give a little introduction to it, I say I have only two requests: before you come, have a wonderful bottle of wine. And when you come, come with someone you love . . . or someone you want to love.\"\n\n(Arthur Kaplan, former co-editor of San Francisco Opera magazine, currently directs opera tours for Dailey-Thorp Travel, the Smithsonian Institution and the National Trust for Historic Preservation.)"
