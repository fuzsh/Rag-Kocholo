        "text": "Sunday, November 7, marks what would have been the 108th birthday of Nobel Prize winner, Albert Camus. During World War II, Camus joined the French Resistance, a movement dedicated to overthrowing the Germans. Camus lent his genius to the clandestine effort by working as a journalist and underground newspaper editor. More than a year before the end of the war, Camus began writing a series of letters to a hypothetical German friend. Like all great philosophers, much of what he wrote rings true today. In the current climate of misinformation and nationalistic cries for civil war, I found Camus’ letters to be strikingly relevant and I’ve posted the first one, as well as an English translation, below.\n\nThe Mind of a Humanitarian\n\nIn the speech that Camus gave upon accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, he said that a writer “cannot serve today those who make history; he must serve those who are subject to it.” His four Letters to a German Friend, which appeared in various clandestine publications, were intended to do just that. Camus had meant for the letters to inspire his countrymen and did not expect them to be read after the war.\n\nIn 1948, Camus agreed to their publication in Italy provided that readers understood the full context of his writing. He added a short preface in which he expressed concern for the now defeated German people. The tone of the letters, he felt, could be misinterpreted. To clarify his thinking, he added a caveat:\n\nWhen the author of these letters says “you”, he doesn’t mean “you Germans” but “you Nazis”. When he says “we”, this doesn’t always signify “we Frenchmen” but “we free Europeans”. It is two attitudes that I bring into opposition, not two nations, even if, at a certain moment of history, these two nations incarnated two enemy attitudes. To repeat a remark that is not mine, I love my country too much to be a nationalist.\n\nAlbert Camus, from the preface of Letters to a German Friend\n\nLa Première Lettre, The First Letter\n\nBelow you’ll find Camus’ first letter, written in July 1943. I took most of the English text from a book of Camus essays, titled Resistance, Rebellion, and Death, which contains translations by Justin O’Brien. In places, I’ve altered O’Brien’s words.\n\nA Sober Yet Hopeful Missive\n\nOne of the things I find striking about Camus’ letter is that he wrote it long before the end of the war. Allied forces would not land in France for another 13 months and it would take 9 more months before Germany surrendered. I find it heartening that in the midst of all the suffering, Camus was able to write with such confidence about Germany’s inevitable defeat. In recent times, lies have proven to be so maddeningly productive. Is the effectiveness of violence and falsehood ultimately doomed to failure? I’d like to think it is and I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nOther Resources\n\nLivres 1, Lettres à un ami allemand\n\nGoogle Books, Resistance, Rebellion, and Death"
