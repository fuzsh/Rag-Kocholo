        "text": "LA VIE EN SPIRALE\n\nRegie: Rama Thiaw Sénégal/Suisse Feature Fiction Language: Wolof Production Status: in development\n\n– Senegal, 1974\n\nThiaroye, situated in the dust of Dakar, an overcrowded suburb full of wooden barracks, noisy children, and adults dreaming they’re Clint Eastwood or Pam Grier. One of them, the solitary witch, Malicka, likes to capture the life of her peers in photo. And among these, is the Gang of 5, the weed smokers. The gang’s members are Mess; Jimmy the Dice, who’d sell his own mother for a hand of poker; DJ Soul, a massive fan of James Brown; Landing Sané, the Dandy; and lastly, the tomboy, Anita.\n\nTheir big muse and inspiration is Yamba, the sorcerers’ marijuana. From the first toke in the morning to the last note at the disco; their days pass like swirls of smoke, living in a spiral. But one day, the national football team is expelled for having sold weed during an international competition. A government decree is immediately published to prohibit the commerce and use of this special weed.\n\nThis is the beginning of a long journey for our friends, the “ joint developers”. The only solution their foggy brains can see is to go and fetch the magic weed themselves from its native soil in Casamance, 300 miles from Thiaroye.\n\nDirector Biography\n\nRama THIAW was born in 1978, in Nouakchott.
