        "text": "As well as creating some of the greatest novels in Western literature, French writers have also produced some of its finest poetry. Throughout the centuries, the universal themes of love, death, nature, and war have all been explored by French poets in their stanzas and rhymes. Our small selection of some of the finest French poems consists of those by Victor Hugo, Arthur Rimbaud, Jacques Prévert, Charles Baudelaire, and Pierre de Ronsard. These renowned poets span several centuries and various literary movements, including the Romantic, the Symbolist, and the Decadent.\n\nIt has been famously said that “poetry is what gets lost in translation”, and certainly no translation could capture the elegance and the subtly within these poems. Nevertheless, to help you understand their meanings, we’ve included a relatively direct English translation for each of these poems.\n\nIf this article sparks your interest, I’d personally recommend reading Introduction to French Poetry. This anthology contains some of the finest French poems, and provides clear and direct English translations that allow you to fully appreciate the original French texts.\n\nDemain, dès l’aube by Victor Hugo\n\nDemain, dès l’aube is one of the most famous poems by Victor Hugo, who is best-known in the English-speaking world for his novels Notre-Dame de Paris and Les Misérables. This particular poem was based on Hugo’s mourning for the death of his daughter Léopoldine, who accidentally drowned with her husband in September 1843. Hugo wrote it four years after the tragedy and it was later included in his poem collection Les Contemplations, which he divided into Autrefois (“In the Past”) and Aujourd’hui (“Today”). The mark between the two is the moment of Léopoldine’s death.\n\nDemain, dès l’aube\n\nDemain, dès l’aube, à l’heure où blanchit la campagne,\n\nJe partirai. Vois-tu, je sais que tu m’attends.\n\nJ’irai par la forêt, j’irai par la montagne.\n\nJe ne puis demeurer loin de toi plus longtemps.\n\nJe marcherai les yeux fixés sur mes pensées,\n\nSans rien voir au dehors, sans entendre aucun bruit,\n\nSeul, inconnu, le dos courbé, les mains croisées,\n\nTriste, et le jour pour moi sera comme la nuit.\n\nJe ne regarderai ni l’or du soir qui tombe,\n\nNi les voiles au loin descendant vers Harfleur,\n\nEt, quand j’arriverai, je mettrai sur ta tombe\n\nUn bouquet de houx vert et de bruyère en fleur.\n\nTomorrow at Dawn\n\nTomorrow, at dawn, when the countryside brightens,\n\nI will depart. You see, I know that you wait for me.\n\nI will go through the wood, I will go past the mountains.\n\nI cannot remain far from you any longer.\n\nI will walk, eyes set upon my thoughts,\n\nSeeing nothing around me and hearing no sound,\n\nAlone, unknown, back bent, hands crossed,\n\nSorrowful, and for me, day will be as night.\n\nI will not watch the evening gold fall,\n\nNor the distant sails going down to Harfleur,\n\nAnd, when I arrive, I will put on your grave\n\nA bouquet of green holly and heather in bloom.\n\nBuy a Copy of Victor Hugo, Selected Poems (Original French with English Notes)\n\nRelated Post: Six of the Most Famous Poems by Victor Hugo with English Translations\n\nLes Feuilles Mortes – Jacques Prévert\n\nLes Feuilles Mortes is a poem written by Jacques Prévert that was adapted into the famous song of the same name. The origins of the poem begin with an instrumental melody called Les Feuilles Mortes, composed by Joseph Kosma for the 1945 ballet Le Rendez-vous, the plot of which was written by Prévert. Based on this melody, Prévert wrote his poem, partly with the intention of it being made into a song, as the director Marcel Carné wanted to adapt Le Rendez-vous into a film.\n\nIn 1946, the song Les Feuilles Mortes was featured in Carné’s film adaptation of Le Rendez-vous, with lyrics attributed to Prévert, although portions of the poem were omitted. The film – Les Portes de la Nuit – was a flop, but the song became a hit and has since been sung in many languages. The most famous French renditions of Les Feuilles Mortes have been performed by Yves Montand and Édith Piaf, and the most famous English versions (titled “Autumn Leaves”) by Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole. Indeed, the song has also enjoyed enduring popularity in the English-speaking world.\n\nLes Feuilles Mortes\n\nOh, je voudrais tant que tu te souviennes,\n\nDes jours heureux quand nous étions amis,\n\nDans ce temps là, la vie était plus belle,\n\nEt le soleil plus brûlant qu’aujourd’hui.\n\nLes feuilles mortes se ramassent à la pelle,\n\nTu vois je n’ai pas oublié.\n\nLes feuilles mortes se ramassent à la pelle,\n\nLes souvenirs et les regrets aussi,\n\nEt le vent du nord les emporte,\n\nDans la nuit froide de l’oubli.\n\nTu vois, je n’ai pas oublié,\n\nLa chanson que tu me chantais.\n\nC’est une chanson, qui nous ressemble,\n\nToi qui m’aimais, moi qui t’aimais.\n\nNous vivions, tous les deux ensemble,\n\nToi qui m’aimais, moi qui t’aimais.\n\nEt la vie sépare ceux qui s’aiment,\n\nTout doucement, sans faire de bruit.\n\nEt la mer efface sur le sable,\n\nLes pas des amants désunis.\n\nThe Dead Leaves\n\nOh, how I would like for you to remember,\n\nThe happy days when we were friends,\n\nBack then, life was more beautiful,\n\nAnd the sun burned brighter than today.\n\nDead leaves are collected with a shovel,\n\nYou see, I have not forgotten.\n\nDead leaves gather in their hundreds,\n\nAs do memories and regrets.\n\nAnd the North Wind carries them away,\n\nThrough the cold night of oblivion.\n\nYou see, I have not forgotten,\n\nThe song that you would sing to me.\n\nIt’s a song that now reminds me of us,\n\nYou who loved me, me who loved you.\n\nWe were living, with one another,\n\nYou who loved me, me who loved you.\n\nBut life separates those who love each other,\n\nVery gently, without making a sound.\n\nAnd the sea washes away on the sand,\n\nThe footprints of lovers since separated.\n\nBuy a Copy of Paroles by Jacques Prévert (French Edition)\n\nLe Dormeur du Val\n\nLe Dormeur du Val is one of the most well-known poems of Arthur Rimbaud, and was surely inspired by the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871). The original manuscript of the poem is dated to October 1870, which was one month after the Battle of Sedan (Sept. 1, 1870). This particular battle was a decisive French defeat, and was followed by an uprising in Paris a few days later that resulted in the abdication of Napoleon III and the end of the Second French Empire.\n\nIt has been suggested that Rimbaud may have witnessed the scene that he described in the poem. He ran away from home on various occasions, and the Battle of Sedan itself was less than 20 miles from his home at the time.\n\nLe Dormeur du Val\n\nC’est un trou de verdure où chante une rivière,\n\nAccrochant follement aux herbes des haillons\n\nD’argent ; où le soleil, de la montagne fière,\n\nLuit : c’est un petit val qui mousse de rayons.\n\nUn soldat jeune, bouche ouverte, tête nue,\n\nEt la nuque baignant dans le frais cresson bleu,\n\nDort ; il est étendu dans l’herbe, sous la nue,\n\nPâle dans son lit vert où la lumière pleut.\n\nLes pieds dans les glaïeuls, il dort. Souriant comme\n\nSourirait un enfant malade, il fait un somme :\n\nNature, berce-le chaudement : il a froid.\n\nLes parfums ne font pas frissonner sa narine ;\n\nIl dort dans le soleil, la main sur sa poitrine,\n\nTranquille. Il a deux trous rouges au côté droit.\n\nThe Sleeper in the Valley\n\nIt’s a green hole where a river sings\n\nAs it madly hangs onto the grass its rags\n\nOf silver; where the sun, from the proud mountain,\n\nShines down: it’s a little valley bubbling with light.\n\nA young soldier, open mouth, bare head,\n\nAnd neck bathing in the sweet blue watercress,\n\nSleeps; he is stretched out among the grass, beneath the skies,\n\nPale in his green bed where the light rains down.\n\nFeet in the gladiolas, he sleeps. Smiling like\n\nAn ill child would smile, he takes a nap:\n\nNature, cradle him in warmth: he is cold.\n\nFragrances don’t make his nostrils quiver:\n\nHe sleeps in the sun, one hand on his chest,\n\nMotionless: he has two red holes in his right side.\n\nBuy a Copy of Rimbaud, Complete Works, Selected Letters (Original French with English Translations)\n\nMignonne, allons voir si la rose – Pierre de Ronsard\n\nPierre de Ronsard is probably the most famous poet of the French Renaissance. As well as his body of work, he is also remembered as the leading member of “La Pléiade”, a group of seven French writers that wanted to elevate the reputation of French poetry by drawing from the works of the ancient Roman and Greek poets.\n\nThis particular poem was devoted to Cassandre Salviat, the daughter of an Italian banker who Ronsard became enamoured with. It has since been set to music many times throughout the centuries, and has become very well-known among the French public.\n\nMignonne, allons voir si la rose\n\nA Cassandre\n\nMignonne, allons voir si la rose\n\nQui ce matin avoit desclose\n\nSa robe de pourpre au Soleil,\n\nA point perdu ceste vesprée\n\nLes plis de sa robe pourprée,\n\nEt son teint au vostre pareil.\n\nLas ! voyez comme en peu d’espace,\n\nMignonne, elle a dessus la place\n\nLas ! las ses beautez laissé cheoir !\n\nÔ vrayment marastre Nature,\n\nPuis qu’une telle fleur ne dure\n\nQue du matin jusques au soir !\n\nDonc, si vous me croyez, mignonne,\n\nTandis que vostre âge fleuronne\n\nEn sa plus verte nouveauté,\n\nCueillez, cueillez vostre jeunesse :\n\nComme à ceste fleur la vieillesse\n\nFera ternir vostre beauté.\n\nDarling, let us see if the rose\n\nFor Cassandre\n\nDarling, let us see if the rose\n\nWhich had this morning unfurled\n\nHer crimson dress to the Sun,\n\nHas this evening began to lose\n\nThe folds of her crimson dress,\n\nAnd its complexion akin to yours.\n\nAlas! See how in such short time\n\nDarling, she has from her lofty place,\n\nAlas! Alas dropped her beauty to the floor!\n\nOh truly cruel Mother Nature,\n\nFor such a flower lasts\n\nOnly from morning till evening!\n\nSo, if you believe me, darling,\n\nWhile your age is blossoming\n\nIn its most green freshness,\n\nGather, gather your youth:\n\nFor old age will fade your beauty\n\nAs it has the rose.\n\nBuy a Copy of Pierre de Ronsard, Selected Poems (Original French with English translations)\n\nL’Albatros – Charles Baudelaire\n\nL’Albatros appears in the 1861 second edition of Les Fleurs du mal, Baudelaire’s most well-known poem collection. It was inspired by a sea voyage to Bourbon Island (now Réunion) that Baudelaire took with his stepfather at the age of 20. The poet was forced to go on the trip as punishment for squandering his father’s inheritance and despised the experience. Nevertheless, the trip did influence much of his work.\n\nL’Albatros\n\nSouvent, pour s’amuser, les hommes d’équipage\n\nPrennent des albatros, vastes oiseaux des mers,\n\nQui suivent, indolents compagnons de voyage,\n\nLe navire glissant sur les gouffres amers.\n\nÀ peine les ont-ils déposés sur les planches,\n\nQue ces rois de l’azur, maladroits et honteux,\n\nLaissent piteusement leurs grandes ailes blanches\n\nComme des avirons traîner à côté d’eux.\n\nCe voyageur ailé, comme il est gauche et veule!\n\nLui, naguère si beau, qu’il est comique et laid!\n\nL’un agace son bec avec un brûle-gueule,\n\nL’autre mime, en boitant, l’infirme qui volait!\n\nLe Poète est semblable au prince des nuées\n\nQui hante la tempête et se rit de l’archer;\n\nExilé sur le sol au milieu des huées,\n\nSes ailes de géant l’empêchent de marcher.\n\nThe Albatross\n\nOften, for sport, the men of the crew\n\nCatch albatrosses, those immense seabirds\n\nThat trail, as fellow travellers,\n\nThe ship gliding along the briny depths.\n\nScarcely have they been put on the deck\n\nThan these kings of the sky, clumsy and ashamed,\n\nPathetically let their great white wings\n\nLike oars, drag beside them.\n\nThis winged explorer, how he is awkward and weak\n\nOnce so beautiful, that he is now laughable and ugly\n\nOne sailor teases his bill with a tobacco pipe,\n\nAnother limps around, mimicking the bird who used to fly!\n\nThe Poet is alike the prince of the clouds\n\nWho haunts the storm and laughs at the archer;\n\nExiled on the ground amidst jeers,\n\nHis gigantic wings prevent him from walking.\n\nBuy a Copy of Les Fleurs du Mal (Original French with English translations)"
