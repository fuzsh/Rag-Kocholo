        "text": "Vladimir Kornéev, born in Georgia in 1987, fled Georgia for Germany with his parents when he was just six years old. Following twelve years of dedicated training as a pianist and successful completion of his A-levels, he pursued his passion for acting and singing at the prestigious Bavarian State University of Theatre and Music in Munich, known as the August Everding Theatre Academy.\n\nToday, Vladimir Kornéev stands as a versatile actor and singer, incorporating all his artistic abilities to bring the richness of European chanson in its stylistic, linguistic, and diverse elements on stage. His commitment to this art form has been recognized through numerous accolades, notably three consecutive wins at the esteemed German National Singing Competition, Berlin.\n\nIn May 2014 Vladimir Kornéev released his first chanson album WEITERGEHN. In 2016 he released his second album RECITAL, which is the live recording of his premiere concert LIEDER at the acclaimed German chanson theatre Bar jeder Vernunft in Berlin. Vladimir Kornéev released his third album HERZ in 2019. It is the live recording of his winter concert at the Tipi am Kanzleramt theatre in Berlin. His first orchestral album was released in 2021 as ROMANCE with the WDR Funkhaus Orchestra, for which Vladimir Kornéev created the arrangements in collaboration with pianist Liviu Petcu.\n\nSucceeding Ute Lemper as the artist in residence of the Kurt Weill Fest 2020 in Dessau, Vladimir Kornéev premiered his Kurt Weill program YOUKALI, which tells the story of Kurt Weill’s extraordinary musical journey from Berlin and Paris to New York combined with his love for Lotte Lenya. Vladimir Kornéev further sang this recital at the Bar jeder Vernunft in Berlin, for the EU Parliament in Brussels, celebrated his London debut at the renowned cabaret theatre The Crazy Coqs in Soho and released this program as the live album YOUKALI.\n\nIn 2022 Vladimir Kornéev had his North American debut with his chanson program ROMANCE accompanied by the Orchestre Philharmonique du Québec and was acknowledged by the\n\nCanadian press as “One of the greatest voices of Europe”. During that period he recorded with Canadian superstar Ginette Reno in collaboration with Celine Dion's producer and songwriter Jacques Veneruso the duet „Le bon côté du ciel“, which achieved platinum status after its release and was honoured with the Prix Félix, Quebec's biggest music prize awarded by the ADISQ. This was followed by seven concerts with orchestra at the Montreal Symphony House and five concerts with French actor and pop star Patrick Bruel at the Salle Wilfrid Pelletier, Montreal's most prestigious venue.\n\nIn 2023, Vladimir Kornéev created his new concert titled LE DROIT D’AIMER (The right to love). This evening showcases his personal renditions of Edith Piaf's timeless songs, interwoven with the moving narrative of Piaf's extraordinary life journey. A symphonic version of this recital was arranged by Vladimir Kornéev in collaboration with pianist Markus Syperek. This concert made its debut under the direction of conductor Ernst Theis with the illustrious Munich Radio Orchestra at the renowned Prinzregenten Theatre in Munich and was broadcasted live on BR Klassik.\n\nIn early 2024 Vladimir Kornéev brings LA VIE EN PIAF, the new all French version of his Piaf concert evening, to the stage of Place des Arts, Montréal. Debuts in Basel and San Francisco will follow as well as further international performances with orchestras and his first Québec tour.\n\nIn addition to his singing career, Vladimir Kornéev is a renowned actor for movie and television. In 2022 he gained international recognition portraying the Russian Tzar Alexander Romanov II in the Netflix series “The Empress”, which won the 2023 international Emmy Award for best international series. Furthermore he worked with Oscar winner and LA LA LAND director Damien Chazelle, who chose Vladimir Kornéev as the lead role for his Hennessy short film LIFE IS THE GREATEST ODYSSEY."
