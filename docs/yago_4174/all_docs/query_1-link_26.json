        "text": "The City of Light never ceases to inspire and fascinate the 7th art. Take a trip through the history of Paris through the eyes of cinema, and rediscover our beautiful capital in spite of its reconfiguration. Paris will always be Paris…\n\n1° Ode to theater in Belle Époque Paris with “Edmond”\n\nDecember 1897, Paris. Edmond Rostand set about writing a play that no one believed in. Name? Cyrano de Bergerac. A veritable ode to French theater, “Edmond” is a masterpiece of the 7th art. Although this sublime feature was shot in the Czech Republic, notably in Prague, where Alexis Michalik and his team disguised the streets to recreate those of 19th-century Paris, the spectator finds himself transported to the Paris of the Belle Époque, in a marvellous, almost idealized, light-filled life, just like in Le Fabuleux destin d’Amélie Poulain. We love discovering the creative process behind a play that has become legendary, backstage at the theater or the former Parisian brothel “Aux belles poules”. Coup de coeur!\n\n2° Vidoq’s Paris in 1840 with “L’Empereur de Paris”\n\nFor once, after Gauguin and Mesrine, Vincent Cassel has taken on the role of a historical figure for the Emperor of Paris: Vidoq. Although there was talk of shooting in Prague for budget reasons, Jean-François Richet ‘s feature film was actually shot in the Paris region. To tell the Vidoq story, a large open-air studio was set up on the former Air Force Base 217, literally recreating the Paris of 1840. The result is breathtaking.\n\n3° Amélie’s fantasy Paris in “Le Fabuleux destin d’Amélie Poulain” (The Fabulous destiny of Amélie Poulain)\n\nHow could we dedicate an article to the finest films shot in Paris without mentioning that classic of the seventh art: Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amélie Poulain (The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain). With 8.6 million admissions at the box office, 13 Césars and 5 Oscars, 18 years on, the feature film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet continues to fascinate. In a phantasmagorical Paris, the modern heroine played by Audrey Tautou seems, again and again, to immerse us in the heart of a contemporary fable. Once we’ve learned a few moral lessons, we love rediscovering the film’s legendary locations, such as the Collignon grocery store, the Abesses metro station, the Café des 2 Moulins, the Place du Tertre and the Canal Saint-Martin , where our protagonist loves to ricochet. With Amélie, we love to rediscover again and again a Paris delightfully imbued with poetry…\n\n4° A Paris where life isn’t always rosy with “La Vie en Rose\n\nBafta, César and Oscar for Best Actress: Marion Cotillard took top honors for her poignant interpretation of Edith Piaf in “La Môme”. Shot between Paris, Los Angeles and Prague, this French masterpiece follows in the footsteps of Môme Piaf, in a Paris where life is not always rosy. The story of the frail, black-robed icon with the moving voice takes us back to the Paris of the 50s. To be seen again and again.\n\n5° Paris in the 19th century for the incredible destiny of the clown “Chocolat\n\nFrom circus to theater, from anonymity to fame, discover the incredible destiny of Chocolat, the first black artist on the French stage, wonderfully played by Omar Sy. The original duo he forms with Footit is a huge hit in Belle Epoque Paris, before fame, easy money, gambling and discrimination wear down their friendship and Chocolat’s career. From laughter to tears, Roschdy Zem ‘s film immerses us in 19th-century Paris, as we discover the true story – sometimes a little romanticized – of Chocolat. And when you know that the film was shot in Paris, you can’t get enough of this beautiful, emotionally-charged movie.\n\n6° “Ratatouille”: the capital’s 1st taste rat!\n\nDid you know that for Ratatouille, the Pixar team captured no fewer than 4,500 shots of the capital for reference? To do this, they have not hesitated to go into the sewers of Paris, to the banks of the Canal-Saint-Martin, to the top of the Samaritaine or the Eiffel Tower, and even to the streets of the capital by motorcycle. This totally unique and memorable event You’ve all heard of it: the splendid animated film Ratatouille, recounting the whimsical adventures of Remy as he realizes his dream of becoming the first taste rat… No matter how old we are, we can’t get enough of Ratatouille!\n\n7° The magic of a Christmas tale set in 1930s Paris with Scorsese’s “Hugo Cabret”!\n\nIn 1930s Paris, Hugo, an orphan just twelve years old, lives in a train station. In 2011, with Hugo Cabret, the great Martin Scorsese signed the great Christmas film of the year, taking us to a dreamy Paris. While part of the filming took place in London, it was also shot in Paris. For the purposes of the film, parts of the Sorbonne and the Sainte-Geneviève library in Paris’s 5th arrondissement were redecorated in 1930s style for the occasion. The same goes for Square Louis-Jouvet and Place Edouard VII, in the capital’s 9th arrondissement. Ready to ditch the darkness for the magic of a Christmas tale?\n\n8° “Une sirène à Paris” the French romantic comedy by Mathias Malzieu\n\nWhen the flooding Seine deposits Lula at the foot of the Flowerburger, the barge-cabaret where Gaspard sings, it’s a mini-tsunami that turns their lives upside down. He, the man who has suffered from loving too much, and she, the creature who has never known love, will get to know each other. And to sing with one voice… For director Mathias Malzieu, the 2016 flood in Paris was the trigger for his cinematic inspiration. In this Paris, where fish and ducks have washed up on the banks of the Seine, a magnified landscape has appeared to him. And what better backdrops for this French romantic comedy than the streets of the capital, the Trocadero or the Paris Aquarium? A thing of beauty!\n\n9° À la mode de Paris with “Coco avant Chanel” (Coco before Chanel)\n\nShe is the embodiment of the modern woman: Coco Chanel.
