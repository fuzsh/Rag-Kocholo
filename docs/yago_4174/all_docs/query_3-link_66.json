        "text": "The contest, which launched in December 2012, was inspired by movie producer Austin Chapman's personal hearing health story. Chapman was born profoundly deaf, but in August 2012, he was fitted with a Phonak hearing aid that allowed him to clearly hear and understand music for the first time in his life. This experience inspired Chapman to partner with Phonak to seek out others to tell similar stories about their own life-changing experience that came with hearing - for the first time or again.\n\n\"After personally experiencing something so life changing, I wanted to hear other people's hearing health stories,\" said Chapman. \"I was so inspired by all of the submissions, but Paige's story stood out because she has truly dedicated her life to the hearing health cause.\"\n\nStringer's entry was one of many inspiring stories, but her entry clearly stood out. \"Paige's story resonated with us because she has not only overcome challenges with her own hearing loss, but initiated this ambitious endeavor on a global scale that has already helped so many hearing-impaired children in developing countries.

The film will be featured on Phonak-us.com and ArtoftheStory.com later this year.\n\nMore than 38 million people in the U.S. are affected by some degree of hearing loss, and only 35 percent are above the age of 64. In fact, there are close to six million people in the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 44 with hearing loss. In short, hearing loss affects people of all age groups, including:"
