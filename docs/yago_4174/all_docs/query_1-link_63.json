        "text": "Interpretive & Presentational Activities\n\nMy packet of interpretive and presentational activities include a simple biography of Stromae with comprehension questions, adapted from the TV5 lessons about this song. I prefer to give interpretive tasks in English, as you will see, in order to get at students' best understanding of the text. There's also an interpretive activity with a hilarious video of Stromae and Jamel Debbouze that skewers the song's writing in a way that even my beginners could understand. Once they start to hear the song's sound effects as those of a thirsty dog and a sick duck, you've won them over! We watched an M6 interview with Stromae and completed an interpretive activity about it that introduces students (albeit fleetingly) to some of his other songs.\n\nI particularly like the conclusion of this mini-unit, which brings students into the presentational mode with some creative work.. Students first wrote an optimistic version of the song, which really pushed them to dig deep for lots of vocabulary. Next, students wrote their own versions of the song in which they described their own life stresses and how they seek release. Here's one example, warts and all:\n\nQui dit bus de l'école dit réveil\n\nQui dit études dit examen\n\nQui dit examen dit notes\n\nQui dit notes dit stresser\n\nQui dit stresser dit devoirs\n\nQui dit devoirs dit travail\n\nQui dit travail dit fatigue\n\nQui dit fatigue dit reveil\n\nAlors on achete\n\nQui dit amour dit les gosses (brother)\n\nDit toujours et dit problems\n\nQui dit problems dit fâché\n\nQui dit fâche dit cri\n\nQui dit cri dit lance\n\nQui dit lance dit les parents\n\n​Alors on achete"
