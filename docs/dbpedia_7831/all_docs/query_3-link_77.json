        "text": "Walter Bruce Willis (born 19 March 1955) is an American retired actor.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nYou can't undo the past but you can certainly not repeat it.\n\nUS Magazine. Issue 249.\n\nI'm staggered by the question of what it's like to be a multimillionaire. I always have to remind myself that I am.\n\nRS. Issue 858/859.\n\nThis is the war on terrorism; it's worth fighting for.\n\nBruce Willis during a visit to the 101st Airborne Division in northern Iraq, September 25, 2003. [1]\n\nI wanted to sign up and fight with you guys, but they told me I was too old.\n\nBruce Willis during a visit to the 101st Airborne Division in northern Iraq, September 25, 2003. [2]\n\nIf you catch him, just give me four seconds with Saddam Hussein.\n\nBruce Willis during a visit to the 101st Airborne Division in northern Iraq, September 25, 2003. [3]\n\nThis is the same fight the US fought 60 years ago\n\nReferring to the War on Terror. On Rita Cosby’s Sunday MSNBC program, November 14, 2005. [4]\n\nThe terrorists today are much the same as those we fought in WW II.\n\nOn Rita Cosby’s Sunday MSNBC program, November 14, 2005. [5]\n\nI'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of... every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican... I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down. I'm not a Republican.[6]\n\nQuoted by reporters at a promotional event for the film 16 Blocks[7] in early 2006\n\nIf you take one out or change one law, then why wouldn’t they take all your rights away from you?\n\n[8]\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nBruce Willis as David Addison Singing in Moonlighting]]"
