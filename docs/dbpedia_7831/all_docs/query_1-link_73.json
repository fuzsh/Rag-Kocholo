        "text": "Vertical Entertainment has released the trailer for a new action thriller titled American Siege, which is another of these crappy looking films that Bruce Willis has attached himself to. It seems like he’s made a ton of these kinds of films over the past few years. He’s pumping them out like a machine! They crazy thing is, they all look like the same damn film! Who is watching these movies!?\n\nWillis plays washed-up Sheriff Ben Watts as he “guards the secrets of the wealthy residents of a small Georgia town. When three outlaws take a prominent town doctor hostage in search of a missing woman, Sheriff Watts is called in to handle the situation before the FBI arrives. In a race against time, mayor Charles Routledge (Timothy V. Murphy) pressures Sheriff Watts to launch an assault on the hostage-takers and to eliminate all witnesses. When the Sheriff realizes he may be a pawn in a larger scheme, he must carve a bloody warpath to expose the truth of the town's dark secrets.”\n\nThe movie was directed by Edward Drake, director of the films Animals, Broil, Cosmic Sin, and it also stars Rob Gough, Anna Hindman, Johann Urb, Cullen G. Chambers, and Trevor Gretzky. The movie looks as bad as you’d expect.\n\nAmerican Siege will be released in select US theaters and on VOD starting on January 7th, 2022."
