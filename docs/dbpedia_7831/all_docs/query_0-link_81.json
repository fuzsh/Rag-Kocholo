WELCOME TO THE FINALE IN OUR SERIES OF CONTEMPORARY CIVILIZATION LECTURES FOR THIS ACADEMIC YEAR. I INITIALLY ASKED DR. BILL ARROWSMITH TO JOIN US TONIGHT ON THE PREMISE THAT HE WOULD SHARE WITH US SOME OF HIS UNIQUE WORK IN THE FIELD OF POETRY. HE VOLUNTEERED TO PRESENT AN EARTHY TRANSLATION OF ARISTOPHANES ? BUT SAID THAT WE'D HAVE TO GIVE IT AN X?RATING ? CHECK ID CARDS AT THE DOOR AND ALL THAT. WE COMPROMISED ON AN R?RATED MOVIE INSTEAD. I'M NOT SURE WHY HE NEEDS TO INTERPRET THE ANTONIONI WORK YOU WATCHED ? IT MUST HAVE BEEN CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE DIRECTOR HAD IN MIND--ABOUT AS CLEAR AS THUCYDIDES IN THE ORIGINAL GREEK. THE ONLY REASON I DIDN'T COMPREHEND IT ALL WAS THAT I HAD TO LEAVE BEFORE THE FINAL SCENE WHERE ALL WAS MADE CLEAR. SERIOUSLY, IT'S A PLEASURE TO WELCOME BILL TO THE NAVAL WAR COLLEGE. ALTHOUGH HE RESIDES IN THE PASTORAL SPLENDOR OF VERMONT, HE IS .A PROFESSOR OF CLASSICS AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY, AND HAS RECEIVED DEGREES FROM PRINCETON, OXFORD, AND LOYOLA. NOT ONLY HAS HE HELD VARIOUS TEACHING POSITIONS BUT HAS BEEN CONSULTANT TO SUCH ORGANIZATIONS AS THE FORD FOUNDATION, THE OFFICE OF EDUCATION, AND MEMBER AND COMMISSIONER OF THE NATIONAL STUDY COMMISSION ON EDUCATION. THE LIST OF HIS AWARDS FOR DISTINGUISHED TEACHING IS TOO LENGTHY FOR ME TO TACKLE. BILL HAS TRANSLATED MANY OF THE GREEK CLASSICS (THE ENGLISH NAMES OF WHICH MOST OF US HAVE TROUBLE PRONOUNCING) AND HAS ALSO PUBLISHED QUITE A NUMBER OF CRITICAL WORKS IN THE SAME FIELD. HE IS EDITOR OF A MAJOR NATIONAL LITERARY MAGAZINE, THE ARION. BILL, WELCOME TO THE WAR COLLEGE. WE AREWAITING ANXIOUSLY Approved For Release 2001/09/05 : CIA-RDP80B01554R00350012m01-4 TO FIND OUT WHO DID IT. Approved For Release 2001/09/05 : CIA-RDP80601554R003500120001-4 Proposed Introduction for Dr. Comfort Good evening. Age brings wisdom - or so said the philosophers of yore. But I'd be willing to bet that's not what most of 'youthought when you found that first gray hair or realized that your tiny son or adughter was graduating from high school. Most of us look upon the aging process with dread. We are more likely to resort to a modern fountain of youth - hair coloring, cream, and so forth - to camouflage our age. We diet, attend health spas and exercise classes, wear clothes styled for the young--anything to slow down aging. Or, rather, to pretend we are doing so. But can we, with the discoveries of modern science, actually slow down this process? And, if we can, do we want to? Here with us tonight is a distinguished gentleman who is an expert in the science of gerontology. Dr. Alexander Comfort received degrees from Trinity College, Cambridge, and University College, London. He recently served as Director of Research and Chief of the Medical Research Council on Aging at University College and has been a visiting lecturer in Psychiatry and Medical Microbiology at Stanford. At present, he is a senior fellow at the center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara.

His best known work, on a different subject, The Joys of Sex, has been such a success that he has promised a sequel. Dr. Comfort. Welcome to Newport and to the Naval War College.

General George Brown, a 1941 graduate of West Point, was a pilot in the first B-24 group in our European theatre during World War II and a leader in the famous bombing raid of the Ploesti Oil refineries. During the Korean War, he held various positions of responsibility, including Director of Operations for the air war. In 1968, General Brown assumed command of the Seventh Air Force and later became Deputy Commander for Air Operations in Vietnam, both exacting positons requiring tremendous professional ability. He was appointed Chief of Staff of the Air Force in August 1973. Our Navy P-3 swoops will appreciate his experience as an ASW patrol pilot. General Brown - Welcome to the Naval War College.

Admiral of the Fleet Sir Peter HILL-NORTON has just completed a tour as Chief of the Defence Staff -- similar to our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs -- and will become Chairman of the NATO Committee in April. He served ;7- in cruisers on the North. Atlantic convoy lanes during World War II commanded a destroyer during the 1956 Suez Crisis -- commanded the aircraft carrier ARK ROYAL for three years, and commanded the British Far East Forces in Singapore as an Admiral. On the Staff side Admiral of the Fleet Hill.:-Norton, before becoming CbTO -- or as it is known Chief of The Naval Staff and First Sea Lord -- served both as Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff, then as Lord Commissioner and Second Sea Lord.. One of the Admiral's best known traits is his practice of o ? y ? cyoniy[7, c 7.1?; ' 17117 TT; tee 3 ? ;,, , 1,L-P to a Royal Navy Lieutenant -- I should say LEFTENANT -- and his son Nicholas attends only the finest sehools culminating in his current' matriculation in.

I. liayaktheittoved F r Iee 2001/09/05 W at distingiiishesi the creative person ; WHAT DISTINGUISHES the creative person? By creative person I mean not only the great painter or poet or mu- sician. I also want to include the cre- ative housewife, teacher, warehouse- man, sales manager?anyone who is able to break thru habitual routines and invent new solutions to old prob- lems?solutions that strike people with their appropriateness as well as origi- nality, so that they say, \"Why didn't I think of that?\" Here is a little list of what I believe to be the characteristics of a creative person. First, he Lor she] is not limited in his thinking to \"what everyone knows.\" \"Everyone knows\" that tees are green. But the creative artist is able to see that in certain lights some trees look blue or purple or yellow. The creative person looks ? at the ,world with his own eyes, not with the eyes of others. ; THE CREATIVE individual also knows his own feelings better than the average person. Most people, I find, don't know the answer to the question,' 'Tow are you? How do you feel?\" The reason they don't know is that they are busy feeling what they are supposed to feel, thinking what they are supposed to think, that they never get down to examining their own deepest feelings. . \"How did yeti like the play?\" \"Oh, it was a fine play. It was well reviewed in The New Yorker.\" \"How .did you like that movie?\" \"It was awful. The Chicago Tribune said it was the worst of the season.\" With authority figures like drama critics and book reviewers and teach- ers and professors telling us what to think and how to feel, many of us are busy playing roles, fulfilling other peo- ple's expectations. As Republicans, we think what other Republicans think. Not many of us ask ourselves, \"How do I feel? What do I think\"?and wait for answers. Another characteristic of the creative person is that he is able to entertain and play with ideas that the average person may regard as silly, mistaken, or downright dangerous. All new ideas sound foolish at first, because they are new. an the early days of the railroad, it was argued that? speeds of 25 miles an hour or over would be impractical because people's brains would burst.] \" And because creativity means being willing to go out on a limb, the person who would be creative must be ?able to endure loneliness?even ridicule. If you? bave a great and original idea which others are not yet ready to accept, there will be long periods of loneliness. There will be times when your friends and relatives think you are era, zy, and you begin to wonder if they are right. A genuinely creative person, be- neving in his creation, is able to en- dur tihis loneliness?for years if neces- Another trait of the creative person idle curiosity. He asks questions, reads books, conducts investigations into matters apparently unrelated to his job ?or profession?just for the fun of knowing. It is from these apparently unrelated sources that brilliant ideas \\, often emerge to enrich one's ow held .,ofk.work. \\rinally, the creative pers plays his hunehes. \"Pure intellect,\" says Dr. Hans Selye, the great medical re- - searcher at the University of Montreal, - \"is largely a quality of the middle-class mind. The lowliest hooligan and the greatest creator, in the fields of science are activated mainly by imponderable instincts and emotions, especially faith. . Curiously, even scientific research, the most intellectual creative effort of . which man is capable, is no exception in this respect.\" The general semanticist Alfred Kor- zybski L1879-1950] also understood well the role of undefinable emotions in the creative life. He wrote, \"Creative scientists know very well from observation of them- selves that all creative work starts as a feeling, inclination, suspicion, intui- tion, hunch, or some other nonverbal affective state, which only at a later date, after a sort of nursing, takes the shape of verbal expression worked out later in a rationalized, coherent . . . theory,\" THE CREATIVE person therefore does not rely exclusively on his reason- ing power, altho he has plenty Of abili- ty in this respect. He uses also his eyes and ears and senses?and pays atten- tion to his emotions. The world is desperately in need of creative people, especially in the area of social relations and social invention.

Today we welcome home a Naval Officer who more than any other living man is respons01 or today's Naval War College. His first association with the Colleg came student 18 years ago. Chosen from the graduating class, then Captain Colbert remained in Newport to become the father of the Naval Command College, the first course offered for International Naval Officers. The success of NCC has been over-whelthing; 173 officers, over 1/3 of our graduates have been selected for Admiral. In 1968 Admiral Colbert returned to Newport and assumed the Presidency of the Naval War College.

Here is what he said: \"The U.S. propaganda machine has launched a campaign against the Soviet Navy. Washington sees a menace, if you please, in the fact that our ships appear in the Mediterranean, in tb,. Indian Occan, and in other seas. But at the same time American politicians consider it normal and natural that their 6th Fleet is constantly in the Mediterranean -- next door, as it were, to the Soviet Union -- and the 7th Fleet off the shores of China and Indochina. We have never considered, and do not now consider, that it is an ideal situation when the navies of the great powers are cruising about for long periods far from their shores, and we are prepared to solve this problem, but to solve it, as they say, on an equal basis On the basis of such principles, the Soviet Union is ready to discuss any proposals.\" Assuming, then, that the Soviet Union might feel that such U.S,? r6461fFroc46iellaie '2?) 61 /Wog- ClAtRb PIRAERA 554 R0C.C85 0 011:213041 -4 he Approved For Release 2001/09/05 : CIA-RDP80601554R003500120001-4 WE HAVE BEEN COLLECTING CONTEMPORARY CIVILIZATION LECTURERS FROM PLACES AS FAR OFF AS ENGLAND.
