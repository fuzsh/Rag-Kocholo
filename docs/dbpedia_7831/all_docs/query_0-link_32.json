        "text": "Willis History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nScotland\n\nIreland\n\nWillis is a name of ancient Norman origin. It arrived in England with the Norman Conquest of 1066. The Willis family lived in Berkshire. Their name is derived from the Old English word welle, meaning well, and indicates the original bearer's residence near such a facility.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Willis family\n\nThe surname Willis was first found in Berkshire where they held a family seat at Hungerford Park, a baronetcy granted by King Charles I. They are believed to be descended from Baron Welles, the Duke of Somerset, and the grandmother of Henry VII, a Norman Baron from Welles in Normandy who was granted Rockingham Castle but was beheaded. Not all of the family emigrated to England as Hugh and Robert de Wellis were listed in Normandy in 1198. Effric de Welles held the fief or Wellis, Normandy in 1180. 1\n\nJohannes Willeson was listed in the Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379 2 and Walter filius Wille held lands in Dumfries in 1214. 3 Walter Willys was listed in the Subsidy Rolls of Staffordshire in 1327 and Roger Wyllys was found in Kent in 1438. Years later, Richard Willys was listed in the Feet of Fines of Essex in 1517. 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Willis family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Willis research. Another 93 words (7 lines of text) covering the years 1207, 1214, 1279, 1576, 1590, 1614, 1621, 1642, 1643, 1645, 1656, 1659, 1660, 1664, 1665, 1666, 1675, 1690, 1701, 1734 and 1890 are included under the topic Early Willis History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nWillis Spelling Variations\n\nEndless spelling variations are a prevailing characteristic of Norman surnames. Old and Middle English lacked any definite spelling rules, and the introduction of Norman French added an unfamiliar ingredient to the English linguistic stew. French and Latin, the languages of the court, also influenced spellings. Finally, Medieval scribes generally spelled words according to how they sounded, so one person was often referred to by different spellings in different documents. The name has been spelled Willis, Wilis and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Willis family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nThomas Willis (1576-1656), a member of the English landed gentry and Clerk of the Crown in Chancery at the outbreak of the English Civil War, owing to which he suffered the loss of his position and so...\n\nThomas Willis (1621-1675), an English doctor who played an important part in the history of anatomy, neurology and psychiatry, founding member of the Royal Society\n\nSir Richard Willis, 1st Baronet (1614-1690), a Royalist officer during the English Civil War, and a double agent working for the Parliamentarians during the Interregnum, fortunately he was not execute...\n\nRichard Willis (1664-1734), an English bishop\n\nWillis World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Willis is the 172nd most popular surname with an estimated 136,785 people with that name. 5 However, in Canada, the name Willis is ranked the 869th most popular surname with an estimated 6,125 people with that name. 6 And in Australia, the name Willis is the 266th popular surname with an estimated 12,818 people with that name. 7 New Zealand ranks Willis as 286th with 2,126 people. 8 The United Kingdom ranks Willis as 236th with 24,919 people. 9\n\nMigration of the Willis family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Willis family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 61 words (4 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nWillis migration to the United States +\n\nTo escape the political and religious persecution within England at the time, many English families left for the various British colonies abroad. The voyage was extremely difficult, though, and the cramped, dank ships caused many to arrive in the New World diseased and starving. But for those who made it, the trip was most often worth it. Many of the families who arrived went on to make valuable contributions to the emerging nations of Canada and the United States. An inquiry into the early roots of North American families reveals a number of immigrants bearing the name Willis or a variant listed above:\n\nWillis Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nAnn Willis, who landed in Virginia in 1620 aboard the ship \"Falcon\" 10\n\nRichard Willis, who arrived in Virginia in 1622 aboard the ship \"Furtherance\", he died shortly after 11\n\nRichard Willis, who landed in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1630 10\n\nNathaniel Willis, who settled in Boston in 1630\n\nThomas Willis, who arrived in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1634 10\n\n...

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 23\n\nWillis Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nMr. William Willis, (b. 1618), aged 17, British settler travelling from London, England aboard the ship \"Alexander\" arriving in Barbados in 1635 24\n\nMr. John Willis, (b. 1606), aged 29, British settler traveling aboard the ship \"Paul of London\" arriving in St Christopher (Saint Kitts) in 1635 25\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Willis (post 1700) +\n\nBruce Willis (b. 1955), born Walter Bruce Willis, American two-time Emmy Award-winning, Golden Globe Award-winning and four-time Saturn Award-nominated actor and film producer perhaps best known for his \"Die Hard\" series of movies\n\nConstance Elaine Trimmer Willis (b. 1945), American science fiction writer with ten Hugo Awards and six Nebula Awards 26\n\nNorman David Willis (b. 1933), English trade union leader\n\nHenry Willis (1821-1901), English organ builder who built or restored many of the Cathedral organs of Britain\n\nBeverly Willis FAIA (1928-2023), American architect, her best-known built-work is the San Francisco Ballet Building\n\nFrederick F. \"Fed\" Willis III (1947-2023), American professional football player who was a running back for six seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for the Cincinnati Bengals and Houston Oilers\n\nMax Frederick Willis RFD, ED (1935-2021), Australian politician and senior Army Reserve officer, President of the New South Wales Legislative Council (1991-1998), Member of New South Wales Legislative Council (1970-1999)\n\nMr. Gavin Willis M.B.E., British recipient of Member of the Order of the British Empire on 8th June 2018, for services to British foreign policy 27\n\nProf. Katherine Jane Willis C.B.E., British Director of Science for the Royal Botanic Garden in Kew and Professor of Biodiversity for the University of Oxford, was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 8th June 2018, for services to Biodiversity and to Conservation 28\n\nMs. Veronica Jane Willis B.E.M., British recipient of Medallist of the British Empire Medal 29th December 2018 for services to the Handbell Ringing community in South West England 28\n\n...
