        "text": "Bruce Willis, one of the most iconic American movie stars, retired from acting following an announcement made by his family in March 2022 that he has been suffering from aphasia, a neurological disorder that affects language and often presents alongside a brain injury or illness. Originally a TV star on the 1985 hit series “Moonlighting,” for which he won a Golden Globe, Willis jumped to leading man status in one of his early film roles as John McClane in “Die Hard,” eventually becoming one of the biggest box-office draws in movie history. To date, Willis’ films have generated more than $5 billion worldwide.\n\nIn recent years, the star has made a series of video-on-demand action films, with a few still set to release, but he remains known for such career highlights as Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction,” M. Night Shyamalan’s “The Sixth Sense” and “Unbreakable,” and of course, the blockbuster Die Hard franchise.\n\nStacker compiled all IMDb data as of April 2022 on feature films starring Willis either as a lead or supporting actor and ranked these films according to their IMDb user rating, with ties broken by votes. Cameos, uncredited roles, and production credits without acting roles were not considered. Read on for quintessential Willis performances and some you might have missed.\n\nYou may also like: 100 best films of the 21st century, according to critics\n\n308 Ent\n\n#93.

Willis plays a disgraced ex-military man pulled out of retirement to fight parasitic aliens. “Cosmic Sin” was demolished by critics, holding just a 3% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Filmed in Tifton, Georgia, but set in Los Angeles, Gasoline Alley is the name of a tattoo parlor where the prime suspect, an ex-con named Jimmy (Devon Sawa) works. The film was disparaged by critics but well-liked by audiences with a 95% positive audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, likely because it’s one of the final films of Willis’ long career.\n\nYou may also like: 100 greatest movie quotes from 100 years of film\n\nEFO Films\n\n#83. 10 Minutes Gone (2019)\n\n– Director: Brian A.

Knocked unconscious during the getaway, Chiklis’ character comes to in an alley with “10 minutes gone” as the title suggests, unable to remember what went down or who sabotaged the heist. Here, Willis plays a criminal kingpin who can’t be trusted in this convoluted story of betrayal.\n\nEmmett/Furla/Oasis Films (EFO Films)\n\n#82. Extraction (2015)\n\n– Director: Steven C. Miller\n\n– IMDb user rating: 4.1\n\n– Metascore: 25\n\n– Runtime: 82 minutes\n\nWillis brings his characteristic black-ops action grit to this limited release flop that went straight to video. Kellan Lutz plays Willis’ son, and both of which depict CIA operatives, but the plot—extracting a briefcase computer called “The Condor” that can hack any global network—proves banal and uninspired, despite Willis’ star power.\n\nEFO Films\n\n#81.

The film features Zach Ward, the iconic red-headed bully from 1983’s “A Christmas Story,” as one of the gun-toting baddies in this video-on-demand retread of familiar action druggie stylings.\n\nHighland Film Group (HFG)\n\n#79. Reprisal (2018)\n\n– Director: Brian A.

In the 2010s, Willis’ roles often built on his familiar star persona, a tough guy routine still in rotation as the actor ages. Here, Willis plays the neighbor of a banker with a kidnapped wife who helps enact vengeance and reprisal.\n\nYou may also like: Best Meryl Streep movies\n\nEFO Films\n\n#78.

Steve Wakes, a seen-it-all cop whose partner is killed by unknown thugs. A woman (Nicky Whelan) witnesses the shooting and gets shot herself. Wakes takes her to a hospital where she’s the single patient on an abandoned floor for safety reasons. This plan backfires when the killers decide to finish her off in order to retrieve the one piece of evidence that implicates them—the bullet in her leg. This one was so ignored that it doesn’t even have a Tomatometer score.\n\nEmmett/Furla/Oasis Films (EFO Films)\n\n#77. Vice (2015)\n\n– Director: Brian A.

Willis plays Julian, the maniacal owner of “a better reality,” a resort called Vice populated with humanoids where anything goes—mostly violent crimes. Willis plays the antagonist, rather than the rogue cop investigating homicides. The cop role goes to Thomas Jane, who ends Vice, although a twisty final shot of Julian casts doubt.\n\nEFO Films\n\n#76. Midnight in the Switchgrass (2021)\n\n– Director: Randall Emmett\n\n– IMDb user rating: 4.4\n\n– Metascore: 24\n\n– Runtime: 99 minutes\n\nWillis and Megan Fox play an FBI detective team in this tawdry serial killer yarn in which young female prostitutes are the frequent victim. The film also stars Emile Hirsch as a cop on the killer’s trail, Lukas Haas as a creepy truck driver, and Colson Baker (aka Machine Gun Kelly) as a pimp. Fox and Baker, engaged in real life, made headlines for a brutal fight scene the two share in a seedy hotel room, which ensues due to Fox’s undercover investigation.\n\nGrindstone Entertainment Group\n\n#75.

In the low-budget “Setup,” Willis plays mobster Biggs, who teams up with a betrayed robber (50 Cent) to seek vengeance and retrieve heist money.\n\nSpite the Movie\n\n#74. A Day to Die (2022)\n\n– Director: Wes Miller\n\n– IMDb user rating: 4.5\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 105 minutes\n\nWillis stars alongside Frank Grillo and Kevin Dillon in this actioner about a kidnapping filled with clichéd mayhem. Dillon plays an ex-mercenary tasked with pulling off a series of heists in a single day to acquire a $2 million dollar ransom to save his wife. He enlists his military ops friend (Grillo) to help out.

Breakfast of Champions (1999)\n\n– Director: Alan Rudolph\n\n– IMDb user rating: 4.5\n\n– Metascore: 42\n\n– Runtime: 110 minutes\n\nThe runaway blockbuster “The Sixth Sense” came out in 1999, as did this disastrous flop that was pulled from theatrical release shortly after its premiere. Willis’ career often careens between megahits and bombs, with the actor making consistent recovery and remaining popular. In this black comedy based on the Kurt Vonnegut novel of the same name, he plays a suicidal car salesman, but the bizarre surrealist style falls flat. The ensemble cast also includes Nick Nolte, Barbara Hershey, Omar Epps, and Glenne Headly.\n\nCastle Rock Entertainment\n\n#72.

Willis both narrates and shows up as a series of wise mentors along the boy’s journey. Willis gets a softer role, but the action star’s bravado is still in place. At one point, he gives the kid sage advice (via macho wisecracks) while costumed in a pink bunny suit.\n\nEmmett/Furla/Oasis Films (EFO Films)\n\n#71. Precious Cargo (2016)\n\n– Director: Max Adams\n\n– IMDb user rating: 4.6\n\n– Metascore: 27\n\n– Runtime: 90 minutes\n\n“Precious Cargo” is another of Willis’ 2010s-era, straight-to-video action capers, this one garnering 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. Willis brings his signature smirk and whispery line delivery to yet another mob kingpin role. This time, after a botched heist, the mobster seeks vengeance against the thief who betrayed him and anyone else close by.\n\nEmmett/Furla/Oasis Films (EFO Films)\n\n#70.

Miller. Willis plays the unhinged mobster Omar, who kidnaps the daughter of the man who accidentally killed his own wife and child (Jason Patric). At one point, there’s mention that these kinds of mishaps are just a part of mob life.\n\nYou may also like: Worst movies from the last decade, according to critics\n\nTriStar Pictures\n\n#68.

Though Mikey’s now a toddler of speaking age, the child actor doesn’t move his mouth as Willis’ sarcastic riffs provide his voice.\n\nEmmett/Furla/Oasis Films (EFO Films)\n\n#67.

The all-star cast includes Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vince Vaughn.\n\nSummit Entertainment\n\n#66. The Cold Light of Day (2012)\n\n– Director: Mabrouk El Mechri\n\n– IMDb user rating: 4.9\n\n– Metascore: 22\n\n– Runtime: 93 minutes\n\nTaking on yet another secret CIA agent role, Willis plays Henry Cavill’s dad, which seems a conspicuous genetic improbability, except that both characters are adept at impromptu spycraft and brawling. Cavill’s businessman character brings his family to Spain for vacation, but they’re suddenly abducted due to his father’s previously undisclosed career as an operative. Sigourney Weaver plays an agency bigwig and the plot concerns the whereabouts of a briefcase.\n\nKirk Shaw Productions\n\n#65. First Kill (2017)\n\n– Director: Steven C. Miller\n\n– IMDb user rating: 5.0\n\n– Metascore: 39\n\n– Runtime: 97 minutes\n\n“First Kill” follows the heist formula common to many 2010s-era Willis flicks. Hayden Christensen plays a stockbroker vacationing in the remote backwoods—he wants to teach his son how to hunt and nail his “first kill,” but the youth gets kidnapped by robbers. Willis shows up as a double-dealing police chief investigating a heist gone wrong and a cop left dead. He performs with a country accent in this violent and incoherent production.\n\nCinergi Pictures Entertainment\n\n#64. Color of Night (1994)\n\n– Director: Richard Rush\n\n– IMDb user rating: 5.2\n\n– Metascore: 36\n\n– Runtime: 121 minutes\n\nWillis plays a psychologist, Bill, in a role that departs from his usual cop-thug action hero. Bill takes over the support group of his murdered colleague (Scott Bakula) and lands in a preposterous web of intrigue where the patients are murder suspects. The big reveal relies on an obvious and clumsy disguise that adds to the film’s over-the-top, noir style. This erotic thriller was mostly known for the racy love scenes between a vocally orgasmic Willis and his costar Jane March, following a pattern set by 1992’s “Basic Instinct” and the Madonna vehicle, “Body of Evidence.”\n\nYou may also like: 100 best John Wayne movies\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\n#63.

McClane’s quips seem more world-weary than wry, and his son is a serious grump, rather than a wisecracker. The two embark on international shenanigans involving a crucial file that can bring down a Russian bigwig. Explosions ensue.\n\nColecar Productions\n\n#62.

Spyder insists Martin endure a series of ridiculous, violent commissions to win back the dog. When Martin says, “We cool?” to Spyder to make sure his work is done, it recalls the same line Willis (as the boxer Butch) exchanged with Marsellus Wallace in “Pulp Fiction” before he was also released from further duty.\n\nNine Yards Two Productions\n\n#60. The Whole Ten Yards (2004)\n\n– Director: Howard Deutch\n\n– IMDb user rating: 5.4\n\n– Metascore: 24\n\n– Runtime: 98 minutes\n\nThis box-office bomb attempted to reprise the moderate success of the first comedy, “The Whole Nine Yards,” and brought back most of the first film’s cast of criminals. Willis reprises the role of hitman Jimmy “The Tulip” Tudeski, still matched with assassin girlfriend Jill (Amanda Peet).

The animated kid’s film is a crossover between the popular ’90s cartoon and “The Wild Thornberrys.” Willis voices Spike, a dog who’s interrupted marking his territory and, as he puts it, “can’t even smell his own butt.” Willis’ performance is energetic and filled with child-like gags.\n\nYou may also like: Can you answer these real ‘Jeopardy!’ questions about movies?\n\nCovert Media\n\n#58.

Director Steven C. Miller also made “First Kill” and “Extraction,” two more Willis action movies guided by heavy plotting, twisty turns, and brutal mayhem.

Violent and ridiculous, it was panned in reviews. Director Kevin Smith railed against critics, causing more controversy, though the real inside dope was just how difficult a production it was, with Smith and Willis apparently not getting along whatsoever.\n\nCecchi Gori Group Tiger Cinematografica\n\n#55.

First, the rom-com “Blind Date,” which had a decent box office, but was critically panned. The second was “Sunset,” a box-office failure and critical flop. Willis stars with James Garner in this story about the Western hero Wyatt Earp. Garner plays Earp, who’s an adviser on a movie set where Willis is cast as the famous cowboy. This early film is largely a forgotten part of Willis’ oeuvre.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#54. The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)\n\n– Director: Brian De Palma\n\n– IMDb user rating: 5.6\n\n– Metascore: 27\n\n– Runtime: 125 minutes\n\nAdapted from Tom Wolfe’s novel, “The Bonfire of the Vanities” is a notorious flop. Its off-key story centers on the hit-and-run killing of a Black youth, and the premise is treated insensitively. Willis plays a reporter who profits from the tragedy, but the film isn’t a scathing commentary of white privilege, it’s a blatantly racist depiction of Black communities that’s also forgiving toward the white people played by likable stars Willis and Tom Hanks.\n\nYou may also like: Best and worst Al Pacino movies\n\nGrindstone Entertainment Group\n\n#53.

The film begins with Leonardo da Vinci inventing a machine that turns lead into gold via a mirrored crystal gadget. Then the movie zips ahead 500 years to Hawk (Willis) getting out of prison. He’s quickly tasked by gangsters with lifting various da Vinci artifacts. Hawk and his partner (Danny Aiello) do their heists while singing, as if in a musical. The song “Swinging on a Star” accompanies the robbery of an auction house. The absurdist silliness of “Hudson Hawk” continues throughout. It has become something of a cult classic in the years since its release.\n\nYou may also like: Ranking the best years in movie history\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n#48. G.I.

He plays a general who steps in to help the “Joes” once they figure out a villain is impersonating the president and wreaking havoc. Willis’ character comes across as a trustworthy uncle figure (still with stealthy virtuoso soldier skills) in a film with childlike appeal despite its rambunctious violence that brought in nearly $400 million worldwide.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#47.

Willis gives an understated, sensitive performance while sporting a long mustache and a Kentucky accent. In a rare turn, he plays not the flashy lead character, but an ordinary man trying to move on from the after-effects of violence.\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\n#46. Striking Distance (1993)\n\n– Director: Rowdy Herrington\n\n– IMDb user rating: 5.8\n\n– Metascore: 36\n\n– Runtime: 102 minutes\n\nPlagued by production problems and rewrites, the convoluted “Striking Distance” was a box-office flop and critical failure. Willis plays an alcoholic cop on the Pittsburgh police force searching for a serial strangler. Sarah Jessica Parker plays Willis’ love interest; she’s also posing as his partner, but really investigating him.

Willis plays a melancholic child psychologist who works with a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) who claims, in the film’s timeless piece of dialogue, “I see dead people.” The film also dramatizes a tragic love story—one made more crushing when the final twist comes to light. It remains the biggest hit of Willis’ career, grossing more than $670 million worldwide.\n\nMiramax\n\n#1. Pulp Fiction (1994)\n\n– Director: Quentin Tarantino\n\n– IMDb user rating: 8.9\n\n– Metascore: 94\n\n– Runtime: 154 minutes\n\nIn Quentin Tarantino’s ode to pulp fiction storytelling tropes, Willis plays a prizefighter who skips out on a promise he made to gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) by not throwing a fight. In his attempt to collect on bets he himself made and skip town, Willis’ Butch finds himself in one of the most notorious sequences in the film: one involving “the Gimp” and threats of a “pair of pliers and a blowtorch.” Willis almost didn’t appear in the film at all; his part was originally intended for Matt Dillon, but when Dillon refused to give Tarantino a straight answer about whether he wanted the role, it was Willis’ for the taking."
