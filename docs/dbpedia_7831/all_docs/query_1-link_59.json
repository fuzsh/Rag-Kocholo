        "text": "Alzheimer’s Foundation of America Statement on Bruce Willis’ Diagnosis of Frontotemporal Dementia\n\nFebruary, 17, 2023 —“We are sending our prayers and support to Bruce Willis and his family on the announcement of his diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We are also grateful for the family’s transparency about the news. All forms of dementia deserve greater awareness and research support.\n\nFrontotemporal dementia is a group of brain disorders that cause progressive degeneration of the neurons in the brain and, as the name suggests, affects primarily the frontal and temporal areas of the brain. It has a relatively young age of onset, most diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 64 years. The disease gradually robs people of basic abilities such as speaking, walking, and thinking.\n\nThere is no cure for FTD, and we cannot slow down its process. It is unknown what causes FTD except in some rare inherited cases related to specific gene mutations. It is important to continue to push for legislation for increased funding for research.” – Charles J. Fuschillo, Jr., President and CEO, Alzheimer’s Foundation of America\n\nAbout Alzheimer’s Foundation of America (AFA)\n\nThe Alzheimer’s Foundation of America is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to provide support, services and education to individuals, families and caregivers affected by Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias nationwide and to fund research for better treatment and a cure.
