        "text": "\"Love to his soul gave eyes; he knew things are not as they seem. The dream is his real life; the world around him is the dream.\" —Michel de Montaigne, born February 28, 1533\n\nAn Overview of Sun Sign Characteristics for Pisces\n\nThe ruler of Pisces is Neptune. Its symbol represents a pair of sea horses or sea lions yoked together. They dwell in the innermost regions of the sea, which is symbolic of life after death or regeneration. The image also represents a duality, the struggle of the spiritual soul within the physical body. In Pisces, these two natures are joined, yet very much separate. This conflict is sometimes an inhibition to natural expression.\n\nPisces are . . . is a difficult sentence to finish. There are so many kinds of Pisces. Strange statement? Yes, because Pisceans are the most malleable of the twelve signs. They possess a gentle, patient nature, but one that is in want of molding. They can be impressed by and completely absorbed into their environment. They are in need of a container which will shape them, guide them. Without this guiding form, this rudder, they tend to drift.\n\nAnd gladdest hours for me did glide In silence at the rose-tree wall: A thrush made gladness musical Upon the other side. Nor he nor I did e'er incline To peck or pluck the blossoms white:— How should I know but that they might Lead lives as glad as mine? From: The Deserted Garden by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, born March 3, 1806\n\nPisces adapts to their surroundings, good or bad. They are generous, friendly, good natured people with a true sense of kindness and compassion. They are sensitive to everything around them including the feelings of others. They are popular folk because of their easygoing and likable manner, which tends to mirror people they are with. They have an uncanny sense of perceiving what a person is in need of, and delivering it. They are not initiators, but rather allow circumstances and events to motivate them, and then they respond. In this aspect, they tend to focus on other peoples problems rather than their own.\n\nWould you like to in an on-line study of Pisces?\n\nSun Sign Personality Traits for Pisces\n\nPisceans are not practical people. They are too ephemeral for normal day to day living in the 9-5 \"practical\" world. They are sensitive and instinctual rather than intellectual or mechanical. They lack decisiveness and are easily diverted from their purposes. They are apt to live an ambitionless sort of life, searching for some career or meaning in which to pour themselves. They discourage easily, and can become despondent, feel unappreciated and regularly move on to something or someone else.\n\nWhen, however, they do find the right container, they are capable of some incredible deeds. They will become completely absorbed in a chosen path, to the exclusion of everything else. The 'absent minded professor', such as Albert Einstein, is a classic Pisces character. They don't fare well in a controlled or fixed environment and generally rebel against convention. Unlike the Aquarian, however, who will fight the establishment, Pisces wages only a personal battle.\n\n\"It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.\"\n\n—Albert Einstein, born March 14, 1879\n\nPisceans do best in an environment where they can exercise their imaginations and intuitive nature. They are gifted artistically. They are versatile and tend to understand things by absorption rather than logic. They are receptive to new ideas and circumstances. They possess wonderful creativity which is demonstrated in music, literature, drama and art. They have an acute instinct for, and love of beauty in nature as well as the arts. They appreciate luxury and pleasure, and are ripe for new sensations. When they travel, Pisceans prefer remote, exotic places.\n\nPisceans rarely have an ego problem, and in their personal relationships and friendships tend to be very giving. In matters of the heart, they seek a soul mate rather than a bed mate. That is not to say they will not hop from bed to bed in search of this soul mate. Pisces is a spirit on a quest for Utopia, and Utopia does not exist on this earth. Pisces is easily misled because they want to believe. No matter how often they are led astray by vacant promises, they keep the faith and go on looking for their personal ideal. They are loyal, home-loving, kind and generous, but their dreamy and impractical natures are a source of distress to those close to them.\n\n\"Life's greatest happiness is to be convinced we are loved.\"\n\n—Victor Hugo, born February 26, 1802\n\nVocational Interests Suited to Pisces Tendencies\n\nIn the career department, they are better working by themselves than for someone else. Their empathy equips them for careers in charity, catering to the needy, as a nurse, looking after the sick, or as a veterinarian, caring for animals. They have a love of water, and can be found in work that keeps them near the sea. Pisces creativity includes a natural ability to imitate or mirror another person as well as enter into their feelings. These attributes make them wonderful character actors, and many Pisceans find great fulfillment on stage or in films.\n\nPisces sense of others, is an ability that makes them effective in civil service and the legal arena. Many in law enforcement and the judicial system are Pisceans. Their intuitive and spiritual qualities can lead them into careers in religion or to service as mediums and mystics. Still others are creative cooks and chefs. Because of their versatility and plasticity, Pisceans often follow several vocations during their lifetime.\n\nThe Lore of Pisces in Mythology\n\nMythology is closely interwoven with Astrology. Despite all that we do not know about the origins of either lore it is certain that starwatching began with passion on humanity's first night beneath the open sky. Somewhere in time, shapes were perceived, figures imagined, names given and stories were told about the densely populated tapestry of the heavens. All elder cultures throughout the world developed tales of the constellations which over time were imbued with meaning to explain various phenomena of our existence within the cosmos.\n\nMythology in general is far more than a collection of \"make believe\" fantasies created by primitive societies to explain away what they could not understand. The role of Myth in a society was to set the abstract complexities of Nature within a context of story that the human mind could comprehend. Wondering long on what keeps the world from falling through space or whether the dawn will follow night is a costly distraction when there is hunting to do and crops to tend. Story sets cosmic ideas in a scale we can relate to, human scale, which establishes a sense of accord and instills a faith that all is well with the universe.\n\nAstrology and Mythology serve a similar function in this regard. We benefit from Astrology not so much as a tool of fortune-telling but as a directional guide to understanding who we are individually and what our unique role ought to be in this life. As Carl Jung stated, Astrology claims only that we each possess the qualities of the year and of the season in which we were born. To discern just what those qualities are ... is as fascinating to each of us as the night sky.\n\nThe constellation of Pisces appears as a fish swimming in the waters that pour from Aquarius. In Babylonian times, this star formation was associated with the gods Oannes and Dagon. These were water deities in the form of fish. Also in this constellation is the Leash—upon which were tied the two fish goddesses, Anunitum and Simmah. In Islamic astronomy, this area of the sky was known as The Large Fish.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Pisces is associated with the great beast Typhon. This fearsome creature belonged to the earlier age of the Titans, and was a terrifying force even for the greatest of the gods. At one time Typhon attacked Mount Olympus, abode of the gods. To escape from his wrath, each deity took the form of an animal. Zeus himself, shifted into the likeness of a ram. Aphrodite, and her son Eros, escaped the beast by transforming into a pair of fish and swimming away into the Euphrates river. The goddess Minerva placed the image of the fishes in the heavens so that the event would not be forgotten.\n\nDiscover how compatible you are with others:\n\nDevelopment & Production Credits\n\nPrimary Text : Laura Laurance  Theme Editing : Louise Ogden\n\nStructural Design & Project Direction : Rhey Cedron\n\nArt Direction : Rhey Cedron  Art Production : Mark Nelson & Ash' Murti\n\nArtistic Consultant : Thierry Alberto\n\nArt Research : Malcolm Hurrell  Support Research : Walter McCrae\n\n(Life) Support Production : Henry Craig, Joan Flandrin, Clara Kelly and\n\na Patient Legion of Friends, Family & Angels\n\nContent Copyrights: ©1995-2018 - Reproduction Rights Reserved.\n\nIndividual use of enclosed material is encouraged for the purposes of education and enjoyment.\n\nThe republication of textual or graphic content, without license, is an infringement of Copyright laws."
