They moved to Carneys Point, New Jersey when he was discharged in 1957 and David went on to be a welder, master mechanic and factory worker while his German mother Marlene K. worked in a bank. Bruce attended Penns Grove High School and began to suffer from a stutter for which he was nicknamed Buck-Buck. However, he lost it through performing on stage and his extra-curricular activities included drama club and being the student council president. He went on be a security guard at Salem Nuclear Power Plant after high school before embarking on a career as a private investigator.

He has also had his fair share of box office failures including 'The Bonfire of the Vanities', 'Striking Distance' and 'Hudson Hawk' which he co-wrote. In 2000, he won an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series after appearing in 'Friends' and also appeared in 'The Whole Nine Yards' with Matthew Perry. In 2007, he worked with Robert Rodriguez for a second time following 'Sin City' with Grindhouse double feature half 'Planet Terror'.
