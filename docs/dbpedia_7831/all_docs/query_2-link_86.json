        "text": "Walter Bruce Willis, illustrious as Bruce Willis, is a retired American actor famous for portraying versatile roles. While he shot to fame with his portrayal of David Addison Jr. in the television series ‘Moonlighting,’ he is better known for his action and dramatic roles in films like ‘Die Hard’ and ‘The Sixth Sense.’ As a youngster, he had a stuttering problem and took to stage performances in order to overcome this issue. Coming from a family of blue-collar workers, he took up a number of menial jobs before venturing into professional acting. After going through a period as a struggling actor, he finally landed his first gig in an off-Broadway production of ‘Heaven and Earth.’ He made his entry into television by winning the role of David Addison Jr. in the series ‘Moonlighting’ after competing against 3000 other contenders. Soon, the ambitious actor got his lead role in ‘Blind Date.’ However, it was his portrayal of John McClane in ‘Die Hard’ that catapulted him to superstardom. The actor also tried his hand at singing and released a pop-blues album called ‘The Return of Bruno’ which enjoyed moderate success. In March 2022, the actor's family announced his retirement from showbiz after he was diagnosed with aphasia."
