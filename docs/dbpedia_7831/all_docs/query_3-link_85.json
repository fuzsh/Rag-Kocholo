        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Actor , Executive producer , Producer more\n\nBirth name Walter Bruce Willis\n\nNationality American\n\nBirth March 19, 1955 (Idar-Oberstein – ex-FRG)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBorn on an American base at Idar-Oberstein in West Germany where his father, an American soldier, was stationed, Bruce Willis spent the rest of his childhood in New Jersey. At Montclair State College, he devoted himself to music, playing the harmonica and taking courses in the theater section. From 1977, he performed on New York stages while earning his living as a bartender and as an extra ( Le Verdict , 1982).\n\nIt was thanks to the soap opera Clair de lune (1985-1989) that he achieved immediate notoriety (he won an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe for this series ) and that he acquired, alongside Kim Basinger , a first major role in the cinema, in Drinking and Troubles (1987) by Blake Edwards . The same year, Bruce found his most famous role, that of John McClane, the tenacious police officer in The Crystal Trap . During the following decade, the actor would restore his features to this character in two other episodes: 58 Minutes to Live (1990) by Renny Harlin and A Day in Hell (1995) by John McTiernan . His salary is now around fifteen million dollars, which does not prevent him from playing in more intimate works such as A Hero Like So Many Others (1989) by Norman Jewison .\n\nBut success only lasts for a while, and in the early 90s, Bruce Willis accumulated commercial failures: The Bonfire of the Vanities (1991), Hudson Hawk, Gentleman Burglar (id.), Death Suits You So Well (1992 ) or Trap in Troubled Waters (1993). At the bottom of the wave, the actor owes his salvation to Quentin Tarantino who offered him one of his finest roles, that of the boxer Butch, in the cult Pulp fiction (Palme d’Or 1994). Almost in spite of himself, he was soon labeled “savior of Humanity” by starring in three major productions where he had the destiny of our planet in his hands: Army of the 12 Monkeys (1996), The Fifth Element ( 1996). 1997), and Armageddon (1998). These successes more than compensate for some of his performances which did not win the public’s favor, such as Breakfast of Champions (1999). Tired of his action man\n\nimage , Bruce Willis embarked on the path of supernatural thrillers, filming twice under the direction of M. Night Shyamalan. For him, the actor takes on the costume of an enigmatic psychoanalyst ( Sixth Sense , 1999), before donning the panoply of a superhero in the midst of an identity crisis ( Unbreakable , 2000). After a few light comedies ( A Life for Two , My Neighbor the Killer , Bandits ), the actor distinguished himself in a more “warrior” register: American officer in a German prison camp for the purposes of Mission Escape (2002), he is the head of a secret commando in Tears of the Sun (2003).\n\nBruce Willis is also involved in the production with the desire to bring a dramatic dimension to his roles. Turning again towards action, he fully places his trust in three specialists of the genre: Florent Siri who imagines him as a negotiator in Hostage (2005), Robert Rodriguez who invites him to populate his very dark Sin City (id. ), and Richard Donner who makes him a cop on the run in 16 Blocks (2006). More surprisingly, still on the production side, Willis participates in The Hip Hop Project (id.), a musical documentary. If the 2000s did not allow him to reconnect with his colossal success of the 1990s, the actor took on other functions in the development of a film, which did not prevent him from taking on roles at a sustained pace. .\n\nIn 2006, Bruce Willis appeared in the cast of Richard Linklater ‘s disturbing Fast Food Nation where he starred alongside Ethan Hawke and Avril Lavigne before returning to more familiar roles. The following year, he played alongside Sharon Stone and Justin Timberlake in Alpha Dog by Nick Cassavetes , before joining the beautiful Halle Berry on the set of Dangerous Seduction by James Foley . But 2007 above all marks the return of John McClane… Twelve years after the last opus of the saga, A Day in Hell , Bruce Willis returns to service in Die Hard 4 – Return to Hell directed by Len Wiseman . After leading renegade military men in the science fiction feature Planet Terror , Bruce Fights Clones (2008) under the direction of Jonathan Mostow . The following year, the actor toured with Tracy Morgan\n\nthe muscular comedy Top Cops and made a cameo appearance in his friend Sylvester Stallone ‘s Expendables (2010) . 2010 marks the return of Bruce Willis to the pure action film, in the shoes of a retired CIA agent, forced to return to service to defend his life ( Red , which will lead to a sequel in 2013). Once an agent, always an agent, he once again becomes a secret agent on the run for the needs of Sans Issue (2012), directed by the Frenchman Mabrouk el Mechri . If Bruce Willis enlists in the muscular GI Joe 2 whose release is postponed to 2013 (he is Joseph Colton, the original GI Joe), he also plays a central character in the poetic Moonrise Kingdom by Wes Anderson . The year 2012 is once again placed under the sign of action. Bruce reprises his role as Church in the testosterone-boosted blockbuster Expendables 2 , again alongside Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger . The actor also plays an elderly Joseph Gordon-Levitt in Rian Johnson ‘s Looper , a science fiction film where Bruce is chased by his younger self. In 2013, the actor returned to the cult role that made him a star, that of John McClane for the 5th adventures of the vigilante in Die Hard: Beautiful Day to Die . This time around, McClane has a great teammate in his son, Jack, played by Jai Courtney . We find him the following year starring in another sequel: Sin City: I Killed for Her . In parallel with his roles in franchises, in the mid-2010s he began to release direct-to-DVD action films with an impressive pace. We see it in forgettable films like Vice , Extraction , Precious Cargo , Marauders , LA Rush and First Kill . In 2018, the remake of A Vigilante in the City , Death Wish , allowed him to return to the forefront. But it was especially his reunion with M. Night Shyamalan in 2019 that created the event. For Glass , the final part of a trilogy dedicated to the superhero myth, Bruce Willis reprises his role as Unbreakable, alongside Samuel L. Jackson and James McAvoy . He also appears in the first production of\n\nEdward Norton , Brooklyn Affairs , which marks his last major film role."
