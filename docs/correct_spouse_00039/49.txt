Just when the rumour mill went into overdrive about Hong Kong's celebrity couple Nicholas Tse and wife Cecilia Cheung's rollercoaster relationship, the news is that they may be happily married once again and not headed for a divorce after all.

Online buzz has it that the pair have already made up, and quoted a famous musician friend of Tse as the source of the news. Tse is currently filminga Dante Lam movie, The Viral Factor, with co-star Jay Chou, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, while his wife Cheung is based in Shenzhen, China, working on her own movie.

According to Sina.com, the unnamed musician said he only spoke up on the matter to stop the ongoing speculation. He was also quoted as saying that Tse had indeed been upset with the photo that Cheung took with former lover Edison Chen when they met by chance on a flight from Taiwan to Hong Kong on May 8. But the couple have since reconciled, and are in contact with each other everyday.

As for news that Cheung had withdrawn HK100million from the couple's joint account, that piece of news was shot down as well.

News that Tse's marriage was suffering from his extra-marital affair was also pooh-poohed as well. Hong Kong director Wong Jing and a close family friend of the Tse's spoke up in the 31-year-old actor-singer's defense, saying that he is "a very devoted person".
