        "text": "While May-December romances between grown adults may still raise eyebrows, couples that met after becoming of age are generally more accepted. This can be seen even with celebrities whose age-gap romances can become headline-worthy news.\n\nFamous Couple Defies 24-Year Age Gap And A Father’s Disapproval\n\nRecently, an actress’s son’s 29-year age gap with his alleged girlfriend turned heads because of his age — 17.\n\nBefore calling it quits in 2011, Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung and singer and actor Nicholas Tse‘s marriage produced two children, born in 2007 and 2010.\n\nThe elder son, Lucas Tse, was allegedly spotted with a 46-year-old woman, his girlfriend, recently. A blogger claimed that the two were seen shopping for living essentials, claiming they already lived together.\n\nAccording to the post, Cecilia Cheung did not handle the news well and had to be hospitalized from the shock.\n\nThe post also implied Lucas’ choice of partner stemmed from his father and grandfather. Nicholas Tse is currently dating singer Faye Wong, who is 11 years older than him, while his grandfather, Patrick Tse, had a relationship with model Coco, who was 49 years younger than him.\n\nThere’s been no response from either parent, though Cecilia Chung has reportedly been offline for several months due to a suspected pregnancy."
