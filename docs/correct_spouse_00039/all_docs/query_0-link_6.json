        "text": "Singapore-based news platform 8days cites a Chinese blogger claiming that Lucas was observed shopping for everyday items with the female instructor. It is also alleged that the pair has started living together.\n\nMalaysian media outlet Hype disclosed that Cheung was admitted to the hospital upon learning of the news, overwhelmed with shock.\n\nThere has been no response from Cheung or Tse concerning the speculation.\n\nThe purported relationship between Lucas and the instructor, who is older than his 43-year-old mother, has ignited discussions among netizens, with some pointing out a resemblance in his behavior to that of his father. Tse, 44, has reunited with 55-year-old Hong Kong singer Faye Wong following his divorce from Cheung.\n\nLucas is the older of the two sons of Cheung and Tse, who got married in 2006 and divorced five years later.\n\nCheung welcomed her third son in 2018 yet kept his father’s identity a secret, which led to widespread speculation. Media mogul Sun Donghai was rumored to be the father, but he denied such claims in September last year and threatened legal measures against the spread of these allegations."
