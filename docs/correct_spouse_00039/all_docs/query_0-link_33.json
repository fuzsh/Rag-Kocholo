        "text": "Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung. Photo from Cheung's Instagram\n\nAccording to Sohu, Cheung became the focus of attention in the Chinese entertainment industry last weekend when Yu targeted her by posting a song titled \"In the Name of the Dog\" on social media.\n\n\"I know well you are not innocent, everyone avoids you,\" the lyrics of the song express. \"I know you act well, dark past, yet still, I believed your promises.\"\n\nYu then explained his issues with Cheung, as well as the rationale behind the song’s title, on Yiyu. He recounted how Cheung’s career took a downturn and her public image worsened in 2011, following her divorce from Hong Kong actor Nicholas Tse. She then actively sought Yu’s assistance, promising him \"loyalty like a dog to its master,\" which touched him.\n\nYu alleged that he invested HK$40 million (US$5.1 million), which was a significant financial commitment for him at the time, in a contract with Cheung that year, stipulating that she would star in four films specified by his company.\n\nThe following year, they signed a new contract for two additional films, with Yu’s company paying Cheung an upfront sum of nearly HK$2.8 million.\n\nYu claimed that Cheung failed to honor the contracts, expressing his disappointment and criticizing her for being \"ungrateful and burning the bridge after crossing.\" He said he had also demanded that Cheung return the HK$40 million he invested and pay compensation for the contract breach, noting that this amount represented his hard-earned money.\n\nCheung issued a statement through her new management company on Sunday evening. She claimed that the song and Yu’s accusations had severely harmed her reputation. She alleged that in 2014, Yu falsified documents and misused his managerial position to sign contracts with other companies without her consent. She has since engaged lawyers to address the issue.\n\nBefore her disagreement with Yu, Cheung also had disputes with other managers—Hong Kong producer couple Tiffany Chen and Charles Heung, who publicly denounced the actress in 2015 for being unprofessional by taking payment but not adhering to the film crew’s schedule, and for not managing her temperament during production.\n\nThey declared they would never work with Cheung in their films again.\n\nCheung has not publicly responded to these allegations.\n\nCheung, 44, is known for her roles in movies like \"The Lion Roars,\" \"King of Comedy,\" and \"The Promise.\"\n\nShe married Tse, 44, in 2006, and the couple had two sons before parting ways in 2011.\n\nCheung gave birth to her third son in 2018 and has kept the father’s identity private, leading to widespread speculation. There were rumors that media mogul Sun Donghai was the father of Cheung’s son, but Sun denied these claims in September last year and threatened legal action against those spreading such rumors."
