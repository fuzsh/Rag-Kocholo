        "text": "Cecila Cheung social media\n\nHong Kong actors Nicholas Tse (43) and Cecilia Cheung (43) have been swept up in rumors that their eldest son, Lucas Tse (17), is living together with a 46-year-old female instructor.\n\nOn April 8, the foreign media outlet 8 Days reported that Lucas, the eldest son, is dating a woman 29 years his senior and that the two are living together.\n\nRumors of living together arose when Lucas and the female instructor were captured buying necessities at a supermarket. A source told the media, “Lucas and the instructor are living together,” and confirmed the rumors, adding, “Cecilia was outraged by the news of her son’s cohabitation. She even had to be hospitalized because of it.”\n\nThe age difference between Lucas and the female instructor has drawn attention and sparked much debate on social media. Viewers have responded with comments such as, “She’s older than his parents,” “It’s ridiculous that a minor is cohabitating,” and “His parents, Nicholas and Cecilia, need to intervene.”\n\nSome viewers mentioned Lucas’s father, Nicholas, expressing that they were not surprised. They claimed, “Nicholas is also dating Faye Wong, 11 years old and his senior. Like father, like son.”\n\nDespite the ongoing rumors, Lucas’s side has not made any statements.\n\nNicholas Tse and Cecilia married in 2006 but faced a divorce in 2011, five years into their marriage, when Cecilia was embroiled in a sex scandal with actor Edison Chen. After the divorce, Lucas followed his mother, Cecilia.\n\nNicholas Tse has been dating singer and actress Faye Wong, who is 11 years old and his senior, since 2014."
