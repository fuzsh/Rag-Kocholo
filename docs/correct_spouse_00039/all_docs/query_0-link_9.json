        "text": "Hong Kong musician and actor\n\nIn this Hong Kong name, the surname is Tse. In accordance with Hong Kong custom, the Western-style name is Nicholas and the Chinese-style name is Ting-fung.\n\nNicholas Tse Ting-fung (born 29 August 1980) is a Hong Kong actor, singer, songwriter, entrepreneur and TV chef.[5] Tse debuted as a singer in 1996 before shifting his career focus to acting. He is best known for starring in the films Metade Fumaca (1999), New Police Story (2004), Bodyguards and Assassins (2009), The Stool Pigeon (2010), The Viral Factor (2012), As the Light Goes Out (2014), and Raging Fire (2021), as well as the television series The Proud Twins (2005). For his role in The Stool Pigeon, Tse won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor, making him the first person to have won in the three major acting categories, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best New Performer, at the Hong Kong Film Awards.[6]\n\nTse is the founder of Post Production Office, a Hong Kong-based special effects company. The company was acquired by Digital Domain in 2016, with Tse becoming chairman of Digital Domain in Greater China.[7]\n\nTse was born at St.Teresa’s Hospital in Ma Tau Wai, Kowloon on 29 August 1980 to Hong Kong actor Patrick Tse (謝賢) and actress Deborah Lee (狄波拉). His younger sister is Jennifer Tse.[8] Tse moved to Vancouver, Canada at eight.[2][9] He attended St. George's School, Vancouver, where he was friends with Tablo. They were expelled together for fighting with a racist bully.[10][11] Tse moved back with his family to Hong Kong, where he attended Hong Kong International School for one year before dropping out in grade 10 due to excessive media attention. He moved to Phoenix, Arizona to finish his middle school, but was expelled after one year for his academic underperformance. He then moved to Vancouver before returning to Hong Kong.[9] In 1996, at 16, he studied at Tokyo Music Institute[12][note 1]. He held Hong Kong-Canadian dual citizenship until 2021, when he renounced his Canadian citizenship. [13]\n\nIn 1997, partly to help clear the debts incurred by his father, Tse signed a record deal with the Fitto label, which would become Emperor Entertainment Group, and released his first album, My Attitude, to runaway success.[9] He won the Most Popular New Artist Award at the 1997 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation.[14]\n\nIn 2000 and 2001, Tse released two popular albums, \"VIVA\" and \"玉蝴蝶\" (Jade Butterfly). In 2002, Tse received the World's Best Chinese Artist award at the 2002 World Music Award for the latter.\n\nTse's most notable films include Young and Dangerous: The Prequel (1998), Gen-X Cops (1999), New Police Story (2004) and Invisible Target (2007). Tse's performance in Bodyguards and Assassins (2009) earned him an Asian Film Award at the 4th Asian Film Awards for Best Supporting Actor, and in 2011, Tse received a Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor at the 30th Hong Kong Film Awards for The Stool Pigeon (2010).\n\nTse dubbed the character Flik in the Hong Kong version of A Bug's Life (1998). He also lent his voice to the Chinese animation film Lotus Lantern (1999).\n\nTse learned martial arts for the screen from Jackie Chan and Chung Chi Li for films such as Gen-X-Cops and Invisible Target. He also worked with Donnie Yen in the martial arts film Dragon Tiger Gate. Tse is a Wing Chun practitioner, trained by fellow actor and friend Philip Ng.\n\nTse has also starred in TV dramas, such as Aiming High (1998), The Monkey King: Quest for the Sutra (2002), and The Proud Twins (2004).\n\nTse became a TV chef in 2014, when he launched his food travelogue show Chef Nic.[15] In 2015, he opened a cookie bakery in Hong Kong. In 2016, he launched his own lifestyle and food brand Chef Nic (鋒味).[16]\n\nOn 28 October 2016, Tse was honoured as the first \"Friend of Michelin\" for his positive contribution to the gastronomic scene through his work.[17]\n\nOn 30 November 2017, Tse prepared the dessert course for A Night Among the Stars, a seven course gala dinner with Michelin-star chefs Alain Ducasse, Kwong Wai-keung, Tam Kwok-fung, Fabrice Vulin, Hidemichi Seki, and Noah Sandoval.[18][19]\n\nTse had an on-and-off relationship with singer Faye Wong from 2000 to 2003.[20]\n\nIn September 2006, Tse announced that he had married Cecilia Cheung in Pamalican, Philippines.[9] They have two sons: Lucas (謝振軒), born on 2 August 2007,[21] and Quintus (謝振南), born on 12 May 2010. The couple divorced in 2011.[22]\n\nIn 2014, Tse rekindled his relationship with Faye Wong.\n\nIn the early morning of 23 March 2002, Tse crashed his Ferrari 360 Modena in Hong Kong Central.[23] Initially, it was claimed that Tse's driver was responsible for the crash, but further investigation by the ICAC revealed that the story was fabricated, involving three other men and a police officer. Officer Lau Chi-Wai was sentenced to six months in prison. Tse spent two weeks in prison[24] and was sentenced to 240 hours of community service for obstruction of justice.[25]\n\nAfter the scandal, Tse moved away from music to acting and shifted his focus from Hong Kong to Mainland China.\n\nTse had his share of brush-ups with \"paparazzi\" in his early years. A photographer of Sudden Weekly magazine accused Tse of hitting him outside a restaurant in Taiwan, bruising his nose and elbow. Although Tse denied the assault charge, there was a settlement in July 2002.[26]\n\nIn 2002, Tse was fined HK$7,000 and had his driving license suspended for a year after he pleaded guilty to two separate charges of speeding. In 2003, Tse crashed his Toyota Camry into Wan Chai train station. He was banned from driving for six months and fined HK$4, 000 for reckless driving. [27] He had another accident in November 2005, where he collided with a Public Security Bureau Bus in an Audi RS4 in Lantau. He was banned from driving for another six months and fined HK$4,000 for reckless driving.\n\nMain article: Nicholas Tse discography\n\nYear English title Chinese title Role Notes 1998 Young and Dangerous: The Prequel 新古惑仔之少年激鬥篇 Chan Ho-nam Hong Kong Film Award for Best New Performer 1999 Gen-X Cops 特警新人類 Jack A Man Called Hero 中華英雄 Sword Hua Metade Fumaca 半支煙 Smokey Nominated – Hong Kong Film Award for Best Original Film Song Street Angels 少女党 The Mirror 怪談之魔鏡 Siu-ming 2000 Twelve Nights 十二夜 Kit Winner Takes All 大贏家 Ferrari Time and Tide 順流逆流 Tyler Yim 2001 Comic King 漫畫風雲 Knife Master Q 2001 老夫子2001 Fred/Howard Heroes in Love 戀愛起義 Writer/co-director only My Schoolmate, the Barbarian 我的野蠻同學 Stone 2002 Inspector Tide Yau 2002 Tiramisu 戀愛行星 Ko Fung Demi-Haunted 魂魄唔齊 Chang Ho-fung 2003 The Medallion 飛龍再生 Waiter Cameo 2004 Jade Goddess of Mercy 玉觀音 Maojie Enter the Phoenix 大佬愛美麗 Cock Head Cameo Moving Targets 2004新紮師兄 Cheung Wai-kit New Police Story 新警察故事 Frank Cheng Hundred Flowers Award for Best Supporting Actor 2005 A Chinese Tall Story 情癲大聖 Tripitaka The Promise 無極 Duke Wuhuan 2006 McDull, the Alumni 春田花花同學會 Old man in toilet Dragon Tiger Gate 龍虎門 Tiger Wong Rob-B-Hood 寶貝計劃 Nicholas Cameo The Heavenly Kings 四大天王 Himself Cameo 2007 Invisible Target 男兒本色 Detective Chan Chun 2008 Beast Stalker 證人 Sergeant Tong Fei Storm Rider Clash of the Evils 風雲決 Striding Cloud 2009 The Storm Warriors 風雲II Heartless Bodyguards and Assassins 十月圍城 Deng Sidi Asian Film Award for Best Supporting Actor\n\nHong Kong Film Award for Best Supporting Actor\n\nNominated – Golden Horse Award for Best Supporting Actor 2010 Hot Summer Days 全城熱戀熱辣辣 Wai The Stool Pigeon 綫人 Ghost Jr. Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor 2011 Shaolin 新少林寺 Tsao Man Nominated – Hong Kong Film Award for Best Supporting Actor Treasure Inn 財神客棧 Master Kung 2012 The Viral Factor 逆戰 Man Yeung Nominated – Golden Horse Award for Best Actor The Bullet Vanishes 消失的子彈 Captain Guo Zhui 2013 The Midas Touch 超級經理人 Himself Cameo 2014 As the Light Goes Out 救火英雄 Sam From Vegas to Macau 賭城風雲 Cool But Always 一生一世 Zhao Yongyuan 2015 12 Golden Ducks 12金鴨 The Spirit of the Swords 情劍 2016 I Love That Crazy Little Thing 那件瘋狂的小事叫愛情 Heartfall Arises 驚天破[28] 2017 Cook Up a Storm 決戰食神 Sky Ko 2018 Air Strike 大轟炸 Lei Tao Special appearance[29] 2019 Undercover Punch and Gun Officer He 2021 Raging Fire 怒火 Yau Kong-ngo [30] TBA Customs Frontline 海關戰線 Chow Ching-lai Also action director Raging Havoc 怒火漫延 Chow Also action director 無限任務 New Police Story 2 新警察故事2 Frank Cheng Also director\n\nYear English title Chinese title Role Notes 1998 Aiming High 撻出愛火花 Chiu Ka Chun TV debut 2002 The Monkey King: Quest for the Sutra 齊天大聖孫悟空 Chung Kwai cameo Secretly Loving You 偷偷愛上你 Himself cameo 2003 Hearts of Fencing 當四葉草碰上劍尖時 Himself cameo 2005 The Proud twins 小魚兒與花無缺 Hua Wu Que 2007 Wing Chun 詠春 Leung Bik Big Shot 大人物 Yang Fan The Spirit of Sword 浣花洗劍錄 Hu Yan Da Zang 2012 Jian Xia Qing Yuan 劍俠情緣 Ye Fan / Gu Lang America's Next Top Model, Cycle 18 a judge and also action director in one of the episodes[31] 2013 The Next Magic 下一個奇跡 Liang Hai En Super Boy (2013) 2013快樂男聲 one of the main judges in the Finale 2014 Chef Nic 12道鋒味 the show's on-camera chef[32] a Chinese food travelogue show 2015 Chef Nic 2 12道鋒味 2 the show's on-camera chef a Chinese food travelogue show 2016 Chef Nic 3 12道鋒味 3 the show's on-camera chef a Chinese food travelogue show Lady Bees 蜜蜂少女队 one of the 2 coaches a women's group music cultivation reality show 2017 Chef Nic 2017 鋒味 2017 the show's on-camera chef a Chinese food travelogue show 2018 Chef Nic 2018 鋒味 2018 the show's on-camera chef a Chinese food travelogue show Celebrity Chef: East vs West 名廚爭鋒 the show's on-camera chef a Chinese food competition show Sing!
