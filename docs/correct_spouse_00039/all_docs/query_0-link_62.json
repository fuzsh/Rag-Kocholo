The mom of two had actually posted a video with a little girl on her Instagram in February of this year with the caption: “She’s too cute. Before 2018 ends, I must have a baby. This is my goal!” Unfortunately her account is now private and no longer has any posts.\n\nCecilia Cheung Teases Picture of Baby Marcus in One Year Birthday Celebration Video\n\nEEG Addresses Discord Rumors between Nicholas Tse and Eldest Son, Lucas Tse\n\nCecilia Cheung was married to celebrity Nicholas Tse (謝霆鋒) until their divorce in 2011.

I haven’t seen her in so long. I’m not going to talk about it. Help me congratulate her.”\n\nEx-husband, Nicholas Tse, was first approached by Apple Daily at an event today. When asked about the pregnancy news, he smiled and said, “I won’t comment. Thank you.” Later on he was approached by Oriental Daily News when he was returning home. When asked about Cecilia Cheung giving birth, he responded, “I don’t know.” On whether he has seen her recently, Nicholas Tse shook his head and quickly went upstairs to his abode.\n\nCredit: hk.on.cc (1, 2), Apple Daily (1, 2, 3), Cecilia Cheung Weibo"
