        "text": "OH MY GOD!!! NIC is ready to be a FATHER!!!!\n\nNicholas Tse is Ready to Be a Father\n\nPassionately in love, Nicholas Tse and Cecilia Cheung have constantly been spotted together in public. When asked during an interview what time does he plan to have a child, Nicholas expressed that he has been ready to be a father since the age of 21. Unfortunately, his financial position back then did not allow this. Nicholas disclosed that at this time, he has enough money to raise a child.\n\nThe limited edition of Nicholas’ new album comes with a t-shirt, different styles for females and males. When asked if he and Cecilia will model the different styles, Nicholas replied by saying that they will not be wearing the t-shirts. It has been reported that Cecilia has already pre-ordered Nicholas’ album, when asked if this was true, Nicholas said that he did not know and that it is better to ask Cecilia. Nicholas then expressed that his company has not given him an album and so, Cecilia has also not been given one.\n\ncredit- nic tse forum\n\ncredit-nic tse forum.....\n\noh well, they've been together for sooo long....they should get marry...but still i felt nic is too young to get marry!!!\n\nCecilia Cheung Gave Birth to a 6.5 lb Baby Boy!\n\nCecilia Cheung Pak Chi gave birth to a 6.5 pound baby boy last night at 9PM! First time father, Nicholas Tse Ting Fung entered the delivery room and held onto Cecilia's hand throughout labor.\n\nWith an expected due date in August, Cecilia had secretely prepared for her delivery yesterday morning. However, Nic still had to film an advertisement at 2PM and did not finish work until 5:30 PM. Afterwards, he raced his car to the hospital to assist Cecilia in the labor room.\n\nWhen Nic witnessed their baby being born, he was extremely moved. Grandfather, Patrick Tse Yin said, \"The baby is very cute! He's well behaved and didn't cry very much. He resembles Nic!\"\n\nWhen the paparazzi heard that Cecilia entered the hospital ready to give birth, over a dozen reporters waited outside the hospital for the breaking news. When Patrick Tse and Deborah Dik Bo Lai arrived at the hospital at 3 PM, the scene was extremely chaotic. Over a dozen police officers, 3 security cars, 2 Porsches, and a Stanley Team arrived to control the mob scene.\n\nReporters rushed up to Patrick and Deborah. The police had to come over to control the overzealous paparazzi.\n\nCecilia and Nic's baby son was born under the Leo sign. Leo males have strong self-confidence and a distinct style and lifestyle preference. Leo's will not change their ways to submit to the elderly.\n\nCecilia is a Pisces and gets along well with others. She will be extremely compatible with Leo's. Cecilia will likely let her son have his way.\n\nNic is a Virgo and shares certain similarities with his son, who is a Leo. However father and son might have a deep misunderstanding. Leo's have a strong personality and leadership skills, which enable them to deal with others. Thus Nic and his son may have a good relationship with each other.\n\nAccording to metaphsyicist, So Man Fung, baby sons are best born between 9 to 11 PM. He may have an opportunity to work at a big corporation when he grows up.\n\nCredit: jaynestars.com & AF"
