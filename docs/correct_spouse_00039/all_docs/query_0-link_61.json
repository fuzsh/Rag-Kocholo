        "text": "Carina Lau Ka Ling, Louis Koo Tin Lok, Donnie Yen Chi Tan, Cecilia Cheung Pak Chi, Lynn Xiong (Hung Doi Lam), Wang Yuanyuan, Raymond Wong Pak Ming and others two nights ago attended the Lunar New Year film ALL'S WELL ENDS WELL 2011 (JUI KEUNG HEI SI) premiere. Tsang Chi Wai brought his Lunar New Year film I LOVE HONG KONG (NGOR OI HK HOI SUM MAN SHUI) actresses Koni Lui Wai Yi, Samantha Ko Hoi Ning and Mag Lam Yun Tung\n\nwhile the leads Cheung Pak Chi and Lau Ka Ling did not forget to brag about their relationships.\n\nThe cast shared their experience on stage. Koo Tin Lok and Yen Chi Tan also played make up artists. Pak Chi earlier was injured in Inner Mongolia but still rushed back to Hong Kong two nights ago to attend. She seemed to be hiding her wound under her hair. The host asked how Pak Chi felt about her first film after becoming a mother. Pak Chi said, \"At first I haven't made a movie for too long, I wasn't too sure of myself. I was mentally prepared for stage fright or not used to acting. If I made a lighter and happier Lunar New Year film I wouldn't put too much pressure on myself and I would be happier.\" Pak Chi said that although this was a comedy, when she got home she would cry because she had to very diligent directors who moved me very much. She even sacrificed her time with her sons to complete this film. As for Goo Jai, Pak Chi described this time as in love but unable to love. Goo Jai said, \"Actually in the end we are\n\nin love. Did you forget I interrupted the wedding?\" Pak Chi awkwardly laughed and said, \"I really forgot. I only remembered being married to (Nicholas) Tse Ting Fung. I forgot I wore a wedding gown with you, sorry.\" The audience applauded.\n\nGoo Jai said that Pak Chi was humorous and on the set would often mention and miss her sons. He said, \"You are no longer a girl, you are a mother, Pak Chi.\" Pak Chi instead asked would Goo Jai dislike girls and like mothers. Goo Jai said, \"That's pretty good.\" Pak Chi said praised her multiple time co-star Goo Jai as an actor with real emotions. He would not pretend, so working with him was very comfortable and pressure free for her.\n\nThe host asked Lau Ka Ling about working with Chi Tan for the first time. She said, \"It's like deja vu due to Ip Man. I always thought he (Chi Tan) was a tough guy, but actually he is a gentle man.\" Speaking of trading blows with Chi Tan in the film, Ka Ling was asked whether someone taught her at home. Ka Ling said, \"Right, my activity at home was fighting the wooden dummy. I always have to help someone with Wing Chun practice.\" Ka Ling said that she invited many friends, but her husband Tony Leung Chiu Wai was still working on the film. However she\n\ndefinitely will be in Hong Kong for the Lunar New Year. Would she be responsible for giving red pockets? Ka Ling said, \"He has his and I have mine, I don't need him to give me money for mine.\" Chi Tan said that his wife Cissy Wang would come to support him and that he will be in Hong Kong for the holiday with the family at home.\n\nAs for box office expectation, Ka Ling said that she did not know about that but it should certain pass 10 million. What would they promise to celebrate box office success? Ka Ling did not understand, Chi Tan said, \"Someone said skinny dipping.\" Ka Ling joked, \"You are the lead.\" Chi Tan honestly said, \"My rear has already been shown, Ka Ling you haven't shown anything.\" Ka Ling said, \"What do you want me to show?\" Chi Tan said, \"Show your hands.\" Ka Ling said, \"Great, in the movie I already showed my hands.\" Ka Ling said that if the movie was a hit she\n\nwould celebrate with dinner for anyone who heard. Her other film LET THE BULLETS FLY has already made over 700 million yuan RMB in the Mainland and became the highest grossing film in the Mainland. Ka Ling said that she knew and she was very happy, because it proved that film was thriving more and more. In the future 1 billion and 2 billion RMB marks will be seen.\n\nWith LET she was nominated for Asian Film Award Best Supporting Actress. She said that she was confident, actually she was already ahead of the game. However she would raise her salary due to any award because good roles were hard to find. Ka Ling's performance was comparable to her husband's. Ka Ling said, \"No way, I could sprint and still couldn't catch up to him. It's going to be awhile, not in this lifetime.\" Wai Jai held a high place in her heart. Ka Ling said, \"Too high, try again next life.\" Ka Ling said that LET director Jiang Wen must be very happy and joked that she would chase him down for a celebration.\n\nGoo Jai honestly said that he just saw a part of the film, when he saw the audience laughing heartily he was at ease. As for box office expectation, he said, \"Box office is very hard to control.\" Ka Ling joked that if the movie was a hit she would buy dinner and show her hands.\n\nGoo Jai said, \"I have to show something too, I will have to think of something then.\" Will he treat dinner? Goo Jai said definitely, everyone must celebrate. Goo Jai said that they could celebrate when the box office passes 10 million. If it passes 30 million boss Wong Pak Ming could treat him on a holiday. He would like to go to Dubai. Goo Jai also said that earlier when he promoted another film MR. AND MRS. INCREDIBLE (SUN KEI HUP NUI) he already agreed to swim in the buff. He said, \"If I have to for this one too, I would be very busy.\"\n\nHung Doi Lam rushed back from Taiwan for the premiere. She said her Taiwan series will shoot until March but she might have a few days off for the Lunar New Year. When asked whether she would pay Aaron Kwok Fu Sing a Lunar New Year visit, she avoided the subject. \"I haven't spend a Lunar New Year in Hong Kong, we will see.\" Hung Doi Lam was rumored to be engaged to Sing Sing secretly last November. Lynn said that last November she was working in Taiwan, of course it was not true. When asked whether she was married, she said, \"Right now I am absolutely single.\" She honestly said that she had no plan to marry Sing Sing as she would\n\nlike to make more movies in the next year or two."
