        "text": "The actor was quizzed on his ex-wife after bagging an award at the Federation of Hong Kong Filmmakers' Spring Dinner\n\nDespite their very public divorce, it seems that ex-power couple Nicholas Tse and Cecilia Cheung are still on good terms, as the actor spoke up for his ex-wife in front of reporters last night.\n\nThe 32-year-old graced the Federation of Hong Kong Filmmakers' Spring Dinner with his father Patrick Tse, where the younger Tse bagged the prestigious '˜2012 Most Charismatic Male Actor Award'. Thanking the behind-the-scenes crew for his award, he humbly added that directors and camera crew's contributions to making quality films were more important than his.\n\nHe is reportedly slated to start work on a Wong Jing film, which will also star Chow Yun Fat. Due to changes in the script, the crew is said to be waiting for the green light before filming begins.\n\nTaking the chance during the Lunar New Year period to spend time with his young sons, Lucas and Quintus, Nicholas joked that he put on weight due to his lack of a work schedule. On the other hand, Cecilia was blasted as having no film offers, resulting in her accepting more variety show gigs in order to maintain her popularity. He retorted, '(This is) crazy. I'm the one with nothing to do; she has plenty of work!'\n\nAs to whether he is looking to find love once again, the actor mused, 'If I say that I'm not, there really won't be any (opportunities), so I'll say that I'm open to (love) anytime.'\n\nSource"
