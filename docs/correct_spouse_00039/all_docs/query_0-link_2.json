        "text": "Here’s a recap and update on the enigmatic power couple’s modern fairy tale.\n\nThe beginning of Nicholas Tse and Faye Wong’s romance\n\nIn the early 2000s, whispers circulated that Wong, 53, and Tse, 42, had been taken with each other since they met at one of singer Anita Mui’s legendary parties, as reported by The Straits Times. Their undeniable connection was further evidenced when they were caught sharing a passionate kiss at a bar in Happy Valley, Hong Kong – but they continued to deny their romance.\n\nMonths later, the lovebirds went to a pub in Causeway Bay to attend the celebration soirée of actor Tony Leung Chiu-wai’s Cannes Film Festival win, per the same source. They confirmed their status as a couple when they left hand in hand, sparking a fan frenzy.\n\nHowever, their romantic tale took a detour when they separated after two years as Tse got closer to Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung after they shot several films together. In 2005, Wong married Chinese actor Li Yapeng and they welcomed a daughter into their lives. Similarly, Tse exchanged vows with Cheung at Amanpulo Resort in 2006, and together they became parents to two sons.\n\nDivorces, scandals and heartbreak\n\nDespite their respective marriages, fate appeared to have other plans in store. In 2008, Tse and Cheung experienced a marital crisis when explicit photos of Cheung, along with other female stars, were leaked online as part of a major scandal in Hong Kong’s show business, as reported by The Straits Times. Tse stood by his wife through the turmoil – but called it quits in August 2011. They shared custody of their beloved sons, Lucas and Quintus.\n\nThen, in 2013, Wong and Li revealed that their marriage was coming to an end after nine years. Li shared that he had obtained custody of their daughter Yan as they navigated the difficult process of moving forward separately. However, while the exact cause of Wong and Li’s divorce remains undisclosed, financial issues are rumoured to have caused major issues in their household, per Singapore’s 8 Days.\n\nPer the same source, a Chinese finance reporter referred to as “Zhang” said that after marrying Wong, Li embarked on various investment ventures including bars, properties and TV shows, but wasn’t successful in any of them. He accrued substantial debt instead, owing creditors US$5.6 million in debt, China Press reported in 2023.\n\nLi seemingly confirmed the speculation during a 2018 appearance on the Chinese interview show A Date with Luyu, revealing a six-year period where he struggled without any income. He then confessed, “That’s why I got divorced.”\n\nWhere are their exes now?\n\nSo what happened to Li and Cheung since their respective divorces?\n\nCheung maintained a cordial relationship with her ex-husband Tse and took on the primary responsibility of raising their sons. She reportedly received US$10 million alimony annually. In 2017, the starlet launched a successful bridal accessories line for her SeeCeciStreet brand, but faced financial losses due to the impact of Covid-19, per Singapore’s Her World.\n\nIn 2018, Cheung announced the birth of her third son via Weibo, sparking speculation about the father’s identity. However, neither Cheung nor her studio ever officially revealed his true identity.\n\nIn 2021, Cheung’s foray into live streaming on Douyin (China’s answer to TikTok) proved highly lucrative, with her first sales live stream attracting millions of viewers and generating substantial orders.\n\nMeanwhile, Li remarried his model girlfriend Haiha Jinxi in 2022 and became a father for the second time, per 8 Days. But he remains burdened with substantial debt and is reportedly selling tea in China to repay it, per Malaysia’s The Star.\n\nTheir love seemingly remains strong …\n\nIn 2014, Tse and Wong’s paths converged once more in France, kick-starting their past romance. Wong was there for Paris Fashion Week while Tse was filming his travel show, causing a stir among Hong Kong media who eagerly anticipated a reunion between the newly single stars.\n\nBy April 2017, Wong and Tse openly embraced their relationship, although they continued to maintain a low profile publicly. In a surprising revelation on a talk show, Tse disclosed in 2019 that he had secretly loved Wong for the past 20 years. Adding to the speculation, the Chinese pop queen was spotted wearing what appeared to be an engagement ring during that time, but neither confirmed any nuptials.\n\nWhile they are rumoured to have broken up yet again over the past years, the lovebirds appeared to quash that speculation by publicly holding hands at an airport in China in March, as reported by The Star.\n\nEarlier this January, netizens sparked another frenzy by delving into the possibility that Tse and Wong took a secret ski trip to Japan, fuelled by an intriguing clue found in a ski visor reflection that caught their attention, per 8 Days. In a photo posted to Weibo, Wong appeared to be reflected in Tse’s visor, although her face is rather difficult to make out clearly."
