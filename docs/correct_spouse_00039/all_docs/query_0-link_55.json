        "text": "SOME peopleâs lives come full circle.\n\nPop queen Faye Wong and Hong Kong actor/singer Nicholas Tse were spotted back together after their split 12 years ago and marriages to other people.\n\nSohu.com reported Saturday that Tse, 34, spent four days at Wongâs home in Beijing since Sept. 15, and video footage showed the pair kissing in the apartment.\n\nWhen domestic media contacted Tse for a comment Saturday, he said, âIâm on a plane now. I wonât respond. Thank you.â Mani Fok, Tseâs agent, however, didnât deny the rumor, saying Tseâs privacy should be respected. Katie Chan, Wongâs agent, confirmed the romance yesterday, sending her blessing to the two.\n\nBoth Hong Kong and mainland press have been keeping a close eye on the two stars since both are high-profile celebrities with complicated relationships.\n\nHailed as the best-selling Cantopop diva, Wong married Beijing rocker Dou Wei in 1996 and had a daughter, Dou Jingtong, with him. They divorced in late 1999 with Wong receiving primary custody and waiving child support.\n\nIn 2000, Wong was spotted dating Tse, who is 11 years her junior, but in 2002, Tse was rumored to be dating actress Cecilia Cheung. Cheung suffered from insomnia and anorexia nervosa during her relationship with Tse because of the overwhelming public and media scrutiny of Cheung being the third party in Wong and Tseâs relationship. She continued to suffer from eating disorders until late 2003.\n\nIn 2003, Wong was spotted dating mainland actor Li Yapeng. They got married in 2005, and their daughter, Li Yan, was born in 2006.\n\nLater that same year, Tse officially admitted to his relationship with Cheung in an interview with a Hong Kong commercial radio program. In September, he announced he and Cheung were married in a secret wedding ceremony in the Philippines. The coupleâs sons were born in 2007 and 2010.\n\nIn 2008, explicit photos of Cheung and Hong Kong actor Edison Chen taken during their fling in 2003 were circulated online. Cheung accused Chen of hypocrisy in a bid to win the publicâs forgiveness while hurting others caught up in the scandal. She denied rumors of a rift with her husband and in-laws. During the scandal, Tse told the media that he would never leave Cheung. However, in May 2011, Cheung was spotted taking a group selfie with Chen. Tse filed for divorce in June.\n\nAlso in 2011, appearing for the first time with husband Li Yapeng on a talk show, Wong said that the last five years of her married life had been âvery steady, very satisfying.â But in 2013, Wong and Li announced their divorce without stating any reasons.\n\nTseâs ex-wife Cheung, who has primary custody of their two boys while living in Singapore, has not commented on Tseâs news.(Cao Zhen)"
