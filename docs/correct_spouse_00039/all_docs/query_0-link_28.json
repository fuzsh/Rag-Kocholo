        "text": "hype.my\n\nAlthough Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung (张柏芝) has never shied away from the public eye, she has stayed mum about certain things. Such as her divorce with fellow actor Nicholas Tse (谢霆锋), and the identity of her youngest son’s father. But, there is always a possibility one may slip up about them.\n\nWell, some believe Cecilia Cheung has. Recently, the 43-year-old actress shared some thoughts about love on the variety show Twinkle Love (怦然心动20岁). Although it sounded wise, it did leave some netizens wondering if she was actually alluding to her previous marriage with Nicholas Tse.\n\n​\n\nSource: Weibo/张柏芝工作室\n\nCecilia Cheung recently appeared on variety show Twinkle Love as an observer on the panel. She, along with her fellow observers, watched as the 20-year-old youths interacted during a graduation trip, some using the opportunity to form close bond while others formed romantic relationships. However, one scene in particular left Cecilia unimpressed.\n\nTwo boys had apparently been competing to express their affection for a girl. While most would view it as romantic, Cecilia held a very different viewpoint. “They disappointed me,” she said seriously, which shocked the guys present. “If I put myself (in the girl’s shoes), I would suddenly realise that those two boys don’t like me at all, (based on) what they are doing.”\n\nCecilia clarified that as they were focused on winning against each other, it certain seemed like they didn’t care much for the girl. “Maybe I (just) don’t like boys who care about winning or losing, because when a person cares too much about winning or losing, I think being with them will (make you) miserable for the rest of my life and (you) will not be happy,” she said.\n\n​\n\nSource: YouTube/YOUKU\n\nAlthough Cecilia Cheung did not once mention Nicholas nor indicated her former marriage in any way, some netizens did wonder if she was speaking from experience. However, most netizens still agreed with Cecilia’s thoughts, with some adding that competing for affection was actually tiring for all involved.\n\nWatch the video here (33:25, 34:21 for Cecilia’s comment):\n\nSources: YouTube, China Press"
