The run with Illinois Bell, Ameritech, SBC, AT&T has come to an end. After 34-years of service, on 12/28/21, I retired. Way back in the 80's I could not have imagined what this day would feel like. It's a great accomplishment and I am proud to join all the other Retirees who have taken this step. What's next? Who knows? But I will enjoy the next ride just as I enjoyed this one. I also want to send out a very big Thank You to all who helped me during my career and to all I met on this journey. KLW Out, for now!!!!"
