This caused all of the operator companies to change corporate parents, with all of them becoming owned by one of the seven Baby Bells, depending on where they operated in the United States. Indiana Bell ended up in the hands of Ameritech, who continued to operate the brand under their own identity until 1993, when the Indiana Bell name was dissolved in favor of their parent company.[1]\n\nDefunct AT&T Brands / The Bell System\n\nA2B Music | Aio Wireless | AT&T Broadband | AT&T Digital Cable | AT&T Phone Center | Audience Network | Cingular Wireless | TCI | Vanguard Cellular Systems\n\nBell System\n\nBell System\n\nBell Phone Center Store | Western Electric\n\nRegional Bell Operating Companies / 'Baby Bells'\n\nAmeritech1 | Bell Atlantic | BellSouth | Nynex1 | Pacific Telesis1 | SBC Communications | US West\n\nAmeritech\n\nAmericast2 | Ameritech1 | Illinois Bell | Indiana Bell | Michigan Bell | Ohio Bell | Wisconsin Bell\n\nBell Atlantic\n\nBell Atlantic | Bell Of Pennsylvania | Diamond State Telephone | GTE | New Jersey Bell | Nynex1 | Tele-TV2 | The C&P Telephone Company | The C&P Telephone Company Of Maryland | The C&P Telephone Company Of Virginia | The C&P Telephone Company Of West Virginia\n\nBellSouth\n\nAmericast2 | BellSouth | Cingular Wireless2 | South Central Bell | Southern Bell\n\nNynex\n\nIBM Product Center | New England Telephone | New York Telephone | Nynex1 | NYNEX Business Centers | NYNEX CableComms | Tele-TV2\n\nPacific Telesis\n\nPacific Telesis1 | PacTel Cable UK | PacTel Cellular | Pacific Bell | Pacific Bell Digital TV | Nevada Bell | Tele-TV2\n\nSBC Communications\n\nAmericast2 | Ameritech1 | Cingular Wireless2 | Pacific Telesis1 | SBC Communications | SNET | Prodigy (Internet Service)\n\nUS West\n\nContinental Cablevision | MediaOne | Mountain Bell | Northwestern Bell | Pacific Northwest Bell | US West\n\n1Baby Bell company which was acquired by another Baby Bell company\n\n2Joint Venture"
