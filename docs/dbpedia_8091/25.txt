Indiana Bell is a former telecommunications brand.

History[]

The Bell System started the Indiana Bell company in 1920 as a way to have a main operating company to service the state of Indiana.

In 1984, the Bell System had a corporate breakup, and was divided into seven, separate, 'Baby Bell' companies. This caused all of the operator companies to change corporate parents, with all of them becoming owned by one of the seven Baby Bells, depending on where they operated in the United States. Indiana Bell ended up in the hands of Ameritech, who continued to operate the brand under their own identity until 1993, when the Indiana Bell name was dissolved in favor of their parent company.[1]
