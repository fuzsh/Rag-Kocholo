Indeed, I shd. have been still more ashamed, if I had not been conscious that I have not intentionally been so very inattentive to you as I have appeared; & if there were not reasons for my silence, wch. wd., I trust in part, excuse it. The truth is, that there is now at my own house a part of a letter wch. I had begun to write to you; but which I was at the time prevented from finishing by the unexpected occurrence of a very fatiguing & constantly pressing business.\n\nType\n\nCorrespondence\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Royal Historical Society 1941\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

You know my feelings of attachmt. & devotion to our best of masters. God knows, nothing but the sense of duty I owe to many dependants would have induced me to touch upon the subject in any shape, but now I think something should be done, & done soon. In liberal hands such as those I have named, my interest, & what is dearer to me, my feelings, will be safe.

Windham Quin, tory M.P. for Limerick County, who had been appointed custos rotulorum for the county in July 1818, had, shortly afterwards, announced his intention of removing Thomas William Grady from his £800 a year office of clerk of the peace, and of appointing Richard Smith, of Limerick, in his place. Grady, however, was to be allowed a pension of £200 a year from the emoluments of the office, on condition that he supported Quin at the Limerick County elections, with his own vote and those of his hundred tenants, who were registered freeholders. Carew Smith and Goold were the lawyers representing Grady and Quin respectively. See Parl. Deb., xxxix, passim. It was made a party question, and on 29 March the house acquitted Quin of corrupt motives in offering the pension, by 162 to 73, and, in another vote, by 154 to 81.\n\npage 15 note 1\n\npage 15 note 1 Queen Charlotte's death occasioned a reduction in the annual parliamentary grant for the Windsor establishment from £100,000 to £50,000.\n\npage 15 note 2\n\npage 15 note 2 Charles Bragge-Bathurst, chancellor of the duchy of lancaster, 1812–23.\n\npage 16 note 1\n\npage 16 note 1 In 1818 the national debt was about £50,000,000 less than in November 1815, an illusory reduction, however, since, in order to continue the policy of debt redemption, the unfunded debt had been increased by about £18,000,000. Vansittart then funded £27,000,000 of exchequer bills by converting the existing 3% stock into 3½% stock, the holders paying £11 in cash for every £100 of 3% stock, on account of the higher interest they were to receive.\n\npage 17 note 1\n\npage 17 note 1 Peel had resigned the Irish secretaryship in the summer of 1818.\n\npage 18 note 1\n\npage 18 note 1 On 3 February 1819 a secret committee of the house of commons was appointed to consider the possibility of the resumption of cash payments by the Bank of England.\n\npage 18 note 2\n\npage 18 note 2 Sir M. W. Ridley's motion to reduce the number of junior lords of the Admiralty was rejected on the 18th by 245 to 164. In 1810 the Perceval Ministry had been fiercely attacked for the mismanagement of the Walcheren expedition.\n\npage 18 note 3\n\npage 18 note 3 On 19 March Christopher Hely-Hutchinson, M.P. for Cork City, criticised various items of expenditure, including one of £22,510 for snuff-boxes as presents to foreign ministers between July 1816 and January 1819.\n\npage 18 note 4\n\npage 18 note 4 George IV expected a much larger civil list than he had enjoyed as prince regent, but his ministers considered that in view of the impoverished state of the ‘lower orders’, the house of commons would refuse to impose new burdens on the people. The king, said Eldon on 26 April, ‘has been pretty well disposed to part with us all, because we would not make additions to his revenue’. On 25 April he gave way, and the civil list, freed from the expenses of George III's establishment, was reduced from its 1816 level of £1,083,000 to £845,000.

On the 4th he had gone to Walmer with his closest friend, Charles Ellis, who was Liverpool's nephew, to discuss his situation. He communicated to his colleagues his letter to the king before it was sent.\n\npage 22 note 3\n\npage 22 note 3 On 5 December Castlereagh wrote a private and confidential circular letter to the government's parliamentary supporters, informing them of the line which Ministers intended to pursue with regard to the queen on the re-assembly of parliament, and inviting them to communicate their own and their friends’ views. Liverpool too wrote to a number of the independent members of the house of commons, and Stuart-Wortley's reply, dated the 18th, is in Yonge's Liverpool, iii. 114.Google Scholar\n\npage 22 note 4\n\npage 22 note 4 Printed in Stapleton's Canning and his times, p. 319Google Scholar (19 December). Castlereagh, his old rival, expressed his regret at his resignation.\n\npage 22 note 5\n\npage 22 note 5 Goulburn, the under-secretary of state for war and the colonies, had written to Littleton on the subject of the queen's affairs, on 19 December 1820, inquiring what were his views and those of other country gentlemen whom he knew. Littleton, who had been a member of Canning's ‘connexion’, represented Staffordshire.\n\npage 22 note 6\n\npage 22 note 6 Liverpool's letter to Wilberforce (29 November 1820), which was similar to the one he wrote to Stuart-Wortley, is in Yonge's Liverpool, iii. 111Google Scholar. His reply was limited to an acknowledgement of the receipt of the letter.\n\npage 23 note 1\n\npage 23 note 1 That of the 15th is in Yonge's Liverpool, iii. 146.Google Scholar\n\npage 23 note 2\n\npage 23 note 2 Castlereagh had succeeded his father as second marquess of Londonderry in April.\n\npage 23 note 3\n\npage 23 note 3 The death of his wife (12 June), to whom he had been much attached, had affected his health and spirits.\n\npage 23 note 4\n\npage 23 note 4 Liverpool was anxious to strengthen his government by securing the services of Canning, Peel and Charles Wynn, as the representative of the Grenville connexion in the house of commons. But on 4 June Peel declined the office of president of the board of control, which Bragge-Bathurst had held ad interim since Canning's resignation, and a few days later the King rejected Liverpool's advice to appoint Canning first lord of the admiralty. George IV had not forgiven Canning for siding with the queen, and believed, erroneously, that Canning's friends in the house of lords had voted against the Bill of Pains and Penalties on his advice.\n\npage 24 note 1\n\npage 24 note 1 The king was deeply offended with Liverpool for opposing Mr. Sumner's appointment to a canonry of Windsor, and for seeking to force Canning on him.\n\npage 24 note 2\n\npage 24 note 2 Wellington's views were recorded by Arbuthnot in a memorandum:\n\n‘We should support Lord Liverpool à toute outrance; we should do our utmost to persuade the King to admit Canning, but I cannot be a party to breaking up the Government for the sake of Canning. My conviction is that the country will be ruined, & all the foreign interests of the country destroyed if the Whigs come into power, therefore my first & main object is to keep the Whigs out. Acting upon this principle, altho' it will be my great effort to keep the Government together, I cannot say, if the King, upon the dissolution of our present union shd. endeavour to form another Administration in opposition to the Whigs, that I will refuse office. When I came into office I declared that I would not bind myself to be a party to anything which was to take place after our Government was dissolved, & I say the same now. I wish to see things remain as they are. I will do all that depends on me to keep them as they are; but if I fail in this, I am not, with the view which I take of the subject, to run the chance of ruining the country merely because I cannot persuade the King to take Mr. Canning.’ See, too, his letter to Bathurst, 24 June, in W.N.D., i. 176.\n\npage 25 note 1\n\npage 25 note 1 Lady Conyngham had superseded Lady Hertford as George IV's mistress, and on the 18th, the eve of the coronation, Lord Hertford had resigned the office of lord chamberlain. Because of Lady Conyngham's intrigues against the Government and her interference with ecclesiastical patronage, the ministers were determined not to acquiesce in the appointment of her husband to one of the highest household situations.\n\npage 25 note 2\n\npage 25 note 2 The king was on his way to Ireland, travelling by sea from Portsmouth.\n\npage 25 note 3\n\npage 25 note 3 On the 7th.\n\npage 26 note 1\n\npage 26 note 1 Peter Moore and Ralph Bernal then represented Coventry and Rochester respectively, and were opposition members. Bernal sat for Lincoln in the previous parliament.\n\npage 26 note 2\n\npage 26 note 2 The king. Sidmouth reported to Liverpool on the 29th from Phoenix Park: ‘The King is in a very uncomfortable state of mind. The circumstances attending the Queen's funeral he is perpetually recurring to in a manner which shows a degree of chagrin and irritation beyond what I have ever observed in him. These feelings have not affected his general behaviour and deportment so as to attract the observation, except of a very few, but the actual expression of them has not been so confined and limited as could be wished.’ The government had disregarded the king's orders to remove the queen's body privately by water from Brandenburg House, Hammersmith, to the warship which was to convey it to Germany; and the conveyance of her remains to Harwich by land resulted in a serious riot in London on the 14th.\n\npage 26 note 3\n\npage 26 note 3 General Sir Robert Wilson was dismissed from the army on the 15th for interfering with the military during the riot which attended the queen's funeral procession through London on 14 August. His object was to avert bloodshed.\n\npage 26 note 4\n\npage 26 note 4 George IV visited Hanover in October.\n\npage 27 note 1\n\npage 27 note 1 Robert Gordon, Lord Aberdeen's brother, was secretary of embassy at Vienna, 1815–26, and at this time minister plenipotentiary ad interim.\n\npage 27 note 2\n\npage 27 note 2 Lady Conyngham. She saw that she would be unable to accompany the king, and she was reluctant to allow him to go.\n\npage 27 note 3\n\npage 27 note 3 That is, that the home price of corn would not rise to 80 shillings per quarter, the price at which corn could be imported under the provisions of the 1815 Act. At the end of September the price was just over 70 shillings—the highest for the year.\n\npage 28 note 1\n\npage 28 note 1 Lady Conyngham.\n\npage 28 note 2\n\npage 28 note 2 Lord Clanwilliam, British minister at Berlin, 1823–8, was at this time acting undersecretary of state for foreign affairs.\n\npage 28 note 3\n\npage 28 note 3 Count Münster was the Hanoverian minister in London, and Baron Decken was one of the ministers of the electorate.\n\npage 28 note 4\n\npage 28 note 4 The Grenville connexion now joined the government. Wynn's letter of the 11th stated that he must reserve the right to originate, either in parliament or in the cabinet, any proposition relating to the Catholic question (Buckingham, , Memoirs of court of George IV, i. 249).Google Scholar\n\npage 28 note 5\n\npage 28 note 5 Wellesley now succeeded Lord Talbot as lord-lieutenant, and Goulburn, an anti-Catholic, replaced Charles Grant as Irish secretary.\n\npage 29 note 1\n\npage 29 note 1 The ‘Catholic’ William Plunket succeeded the ‘Protestant’ William Saurin as Irish attorney-general. William Downes, lord chief justice of Ireland since 1803, was succeeded by Charles Kendal Bushe, who had been Irish solicitor-general.\n\npage 29 note 2\n\npage 29 note 2 Liverpool's success in gaining the support of the Grenville party almost lost him the services of Huskisson, who, having held the minor office of the woods and forests since 1814, thought himself due for promotion. Instead he was passed over, and Charles Wynn was appointed to the office of president of the board of control to which Huskisson had aspired.\n\npage 30 note 1\n\npage 30 note 1 The agricultural depression which had set in in 1820 reached its lowest point in 1822. The country gentlemen compelled the government drastically to reduce expenditure; taxes amounting to £3,500,000 were remitted, and official salaries were cut down. They were restored to their old amount in 1824. (See Parl. Deb., vi. N.S., 1024.)\n\npage 30 note 2\n\npage 30 note 2 Alexander Arbuthnot (1768–1828), dean of Cloyne, 1816; bishop of Killaloe, 1823.

George IV was anxious that Canning's appointment as governor-general of Bengal should not be interfered with, and that Wellington should go to the foreign office. Liverpool, however, was determined to have Canning back in file cabinet, and Peel had no desire to stand in his way.\n\npage 31 note 1\n\npage 31 note 1 Melville hoped that the duke would be asked to take the foreign office, but said he would not oppose Canning's appointment ‘if others deemed it on the whole most desirable’ (Yonge's Liverpool, iii. 198).Google Scholar\n\npage 31 note 2\n\npage 31 note 2 Missing.\n\npage 32 note 1\n\npage 32 note 1 On the 8th he wrote to Liverpool consenting to Canning's readmission to the cabinet (Yonge's Liverpool, iii. 199Google Scholar).

John Backhouse was at this time a clerk, of ten years' standing, in the office of the board of control, and he was to have accompanied Canning to India. Later he was put in charge of the consular department of the F.O.; in April 1827 Canning appointed him permanent under-secretary for foreign Affairs.\n\npage 32 note 4\n\npage 32 note 4 Knighton was now appointed keeper of the king's privy purse, and Bloomfield became minister to Sweden.\n\npage 32 note 5\n\npage 32 note 5 ‘Canning has taken two days to settle what might have been settled in 5 minutes. The duke says, “Comme les gens d'esprit sont bites”.’ [Arbuthnot's endorsement.]\n\npage 33 note 1\n\npage 33 note 1 The whole family was incensed at Canning's appointment, and Castlereagh's halfbrother, now marquess of Londonderry, at once resigned the Vienna embassy.\n\npage 33 note 2\n\npage 33 note 2 As his military secretary.\n\npage 33 note 3\n\npage 33 note 3 He was now created K.G.

C. Henries became joint secretary of the treasury. It was Liverpool, not the king, who kept Huskisson out of the cabinet at this time, but promised that he should be brought in in twelve months' time, or earlier, in the event of a vacancy. To this Huskisson reluctantly agreed.\n\nVansittart wrote to Arbuthnot, apparently on the 27th: ‘You took so kind a part in the arrangement of the mode of my retirement that I owe it to you to let you know that it [is] likely to [be] settled in a satisfactory manner. Lord L. has consented (though I confess not very willingly) to propose to the King to call me up to the H[ouse] of Peers but decidedly objected to ask for any collateral remainders. Though this determination destroys its value as a family honor or at least greatly reduces it, yet as an honorable retreat from the H. of C. it fully answers the purposes of comfort, & I cannot be insensible of its value as a distinguished mark of the King's approbation of my services. It also offers a probability of my remaining connected with the Govt. longer than by any other arrangement. It remains however to be seen what H.M. will think of this proposition as well as of the plan in general. Ld.
