        "text": "John Vesey\n\nStyle and Scandal:\n\n“A status item in many of the best dressed rooms these days is at least one piece of furniture by John Vesey” wrote the newspaper fashion columnist Eugenia Sheppard in May 1968. Owned by tastemakers ranging from Nelson Rocke­feller to the Duchess of Windsor, Vesey’s chairs, sofas, tables, desks, and lamps, mostly crafted of metal, displayed clean lines and faultless proportions and were prominently featured in design publications and newspapers throughout the 1950s and ’60s. Today Vesey’s furniture is a cynosure among collectors of mid-twentieth-century design. As Gail Garlick of Good Design in Manhattan says, “Although Vesey designed his pieces to work well with antiques I think they are just as successful in contemporary interiors.” Garlick, who rediscovered Vesey’s furniture, has a selection of it ranging from aluminum and glass tables to aluminum benches and aluminum and leather chairs."
