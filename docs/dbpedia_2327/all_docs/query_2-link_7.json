John Thynne, Viscount Weymouth was killed in action in 1916. See Unofficial Royalty: February 1916 – Royalty and World War I\n\nLady Alice Thynne (1863–1942), married Sir Michael Shaw-Stewart, 8th Baronet , no children\n\nLady Katherine Thynne (1865–1933), second wife of Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer , had one son\n\nLord John Thynne (1867–1887), unmarried\n\nLady Beatrice Thynne (1867–1941), unmarried\n\nAlex joined the Wiltshire Yeomanry Territorials as a second lieutenant in 1897 and served in the Boer War (1899-1902). In 1910 , he was elected an Member of Parliament for Bath and held that position until his death. At the start of World War I, he was in camp with the Wiltshire Yeomanry Territorials as a Major in command of “A” Company and the second in command of the regiment. His first cousin Colonel Ulric Thynne was the commanding officer.\n\nAlex arrived in France in July 1916 during the Battle of the Somme and almost immediately became the commanding officer of the 8th Battalion Gloucester Regiment due to the previous commanding officer’s injury. On July 30, 1916, while urging his men on, Alex was shot in the chest, damaging his right lung and liver. He spent some time in an army hospital in Boulogne, France and returned in mid-August to England to recover. In mid-December, having been declared fit for duty and now attached to the 10th Battalion Worcester Regiment, he returned to France.\n\nIn January 1917, Alex received the Distinguished Service Order and the Croix de Guerre. He returned to the Wiltshire Regiment and became the commanding officer of the 6th (Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry) Battalion. The battalion was engaged in heavy fighting in Ypres and Cambrai. In March 1918, the battalion was in Baupaume and suffered heavy casualties. Alex was wounded by a piece of shrapnel that was embedded in his left arm. By the end of March 1918, he was back in England recovering. Despite suffering severe wounds twice, Alex was anxious to return to duty. On the same day he was deemed fit to return to duty, he wrote a letter requesting to return to his original battalion in France. He could have taken a position behind the lines or back in England or he could have returned to his duties in Parliament – Members of Parliament were exempt from military service – but that was not his style.\n\nAlex was back in France by the end of May 1918 and on September 14, 1918, he was killed at the age of 45. The following letter was written by an army chaplain to his next of kin, his brother Thomas Thynne, 5th Marquess of Bath:\n\n“It is with very great regret that I write to offer you my sincere sympathy on the death of your brother Lord Alex. Thynne, in command of this battalion. He was killed while on his way to take over some fresh Head-Quarters. A shell burst right on top of the party whilst they were trying to shelter in a ditch at the side of the road. The doctor was badly wounded, the Signal Officer was killed instantly, and your brother died from the effects of his wounds within a few minutes. The bodies were brought down to our transport lines this morning, and they were buried this evening at 6.00pm. The Senior Chaplain took the service and I helped him. The coffin was carried by four sergeant-majors and the bugler sounded the “Last Post” at the end of the service. The Divisional General was present and a good many others. Your brother’s death will be a great loss to the Battalion, to every man of which he endeared himself. Personally, although I have been only a few months with him, I shall miss him very much.” (Information from Led by Lions: MPs and Sons Who Fell in the First World War by Neil Thornton)\n\nLieutenant Colonel Lord Alexander Thynne was buried in the Bethune Town Cemetery in Pas de Calais, France.\n\n***************\n\nTimeline: September 1, 1918 – September 30, 1918\n\nSeptember 1–2 – Battle of Peronne, a phase of the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin, Mont Saint-Quentin, near Péronne, Picardy, France\n\nSeptember 2–3 – Battle of Drocourt-Queant Line, final phase of the Second Battle of the Somme, between the French towns of Drocourt and Quéant\n\nSeptember 10 – Battle of Savy-Dallon, a phase of the Hundred Days Offensive\n\nSeptember 12 – Battle of Havrincourt, a phase of the Hundred Days Offensive, in Havrincourt, France\n\nSeptember 12–19 – Battle of Saint-Mihiel, a phase of the Hundred Days Offensive, in Saint-Mihiel, France\n\nSeptember 14 – Battle of Vauxaillon, a phase of the Hundred Days Offensive\n\nSeptember 14–29 – Vardar Offensive, final offensive on the Balkan Front, in Vardar Macedonia (present day Republic of Macedonia)\n\nSeptember 15 – The Allies (French and Serbs) break through the Bulgarian lines at Dobro Polje, a phase of the Vardar Offensive, in Dobro Pole (present day Republic of Macedonia)\n\nSeptember 18 – Battle of Epehy, a phase of the Hundred Days Offensive in Épehy, France\n\nSeptember 18–19 – Third Battle of Doiran, a phase of the Vardar Offensive, in Dojran Lake, Kingdom of Serbia (present-day Republic of Macedonia)\n\nSeptember 18 – October 17 – Battle of the Hindenburg Line, a phase of the Hundred Days Offensive, the Allies break through the German lines, at the Hindenburg Line in France\n\nSeptember 19–25 – Battle of Megiddo, the British conquer Palestine in Tel Megiddo and surroundings, Ottoman Syria (now Israel)\n\nSeptember 19–25 – Battle of Nablus, a phase of the Battle of Meggido\n\nSeptember 19–25 – Third Transjordan Attack, a phase of the Battle of Nablus in the Jordan River valley\n\nSeptember 19–25 – Battle of Sharon, a phase of the Battle of Megiddo\n\nSeptember 19 – Battle of Tulkarm, a phase of the Battle of Sharon\n\nSeptember 19 – Battle of Arara, a phase of the Battle of Sharon\n\nSeptember 19–20 – Battle of Tabsor, a phase of the Battle of Sharon\n\nSeptember 20–21 – Battle of Nazareth, a phase of the Battle of Sharon\n\nSeptember 23 – Battle of Haifa, a phase of the Battle of Sharon\n\nSeptember 25 – Battle of Samakh, a phase of the Battle of Sharon\n\nSeptember 25 – Second Battle of Amman, a phase of the Third Transjordan Attack\n\nSeptember 26 – November 11 – Meuse-Argonne Offensive, the final phase of the Hundred Days Offensive and of World War I, in France\n\nSeptember 26 – Battle of Somme-Py, Initial phase of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, in France\n\nSeptember 27 – Battle of Jisr Benat Yakub, a phase of the Capture of Damascus\n\nSeptember 27 – October 1 – Battle of the Canal du Nord, a phase of the Battle of the Hindenburg Line, in Canal du Nord, France\n\nSeptember 28 – October 2 – Fifth Battle of Ypres (also known as Advance on Flanders), a phase of the Battle of the Hindenburg Line in Ypres, Belgium to Ghent, Belgium\n\nSeptember 29 – October 10 – Battle of St. Quentin Canal, a phase of the Hundred Days Offensive\n\nSeptember 30 – Bulgaria signs the Armistice of Salonica, an armistice with the Allies\n\nSeptember 30 – Battle of Saint-Thierry, initial phase of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive\n\nSeptember 30 – Charge at Kaukab, a phase of the Capture of Damascus\n\nSeptember 30 – Charge at Kiswe, a phase of the Capture of Damascus\n\n***************\n\nA Note About German Titles\n\nMany German royals and nobles died in World War I. The German Empire consisted of 27 constituent states, most of them ruled by royal families. Scroll down to German Empire here to see what constituent states made up the German Empire. The constituent states retained their own governments, but had limited sovereignty. Some had their own armies, but the military forces of the smaller ones were put under Prussian control. In wartime, armies of all the constituent states would be controlled by the Prussian Army and the combined forces were known as the Imperial German Army. German titles may be used in Royals Who Died In Action below. Refer to Unofficial Royalty: Glossary of German Noble and Royal Titles.\n\n24 British peers were also killed in World War I and they will be included in the list of those who died in action. In addition, more than 100 sons of peers also lost their lives, and those that can be verified will also be included.\n\n***************\n\nSeptember 1918 – Royals/Nobles/Peers/Sons of Peers Who Died In Action\n\nThe list is in chronological order and does contain some who would be considered noble instead of royal.

She was born in Langenburg, in the Principality of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, now in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, on August 11, 1763, to Christian Albrecht, 2nd Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and Princess Caroline of Stolberg-Gedern. Luise Eleonore had six siblings:\n\nKarl Ludwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1762-1825) – married Amalie of Solms-Baruth, had issue\n\nGustav Adolf (1764-1796) – unmarried\n\nChristine Caroline (1765-1768) – died in childhood\n\nLudwig Wilhelm (1767-1768) – died in infancy\n\nChristian August (1768-1796) – unmarried\n\nAuguste Karoline (1769-1803) – unmarried\n\nOn November 27, 1782, Luise Eleonore married Georg I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. After ten years of marriage, they began their family and had three children:\n\nPrincess Adelheid, Queen Adelaide of the United Kingdom (1792-1849) – married King William IV of the United Kingdom, no surviving issue\n\nPrincess Ida (1794-1852) – married Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, had issue\n\nBernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (1800-1882) – married Princess Marie Friederike of Hesse-Kassel, had issue\n\nIn December 1803, her husband died and her three-year-old son became the reigning Duke. Luise Eleonore became Regent and is credited with steering the duchy through some very difficult times. Forced to join the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 and provide troops, Luise arranged to import wheat into the duchy to help fight the great famine that was ravaging many of the Saxon states. Unlike several of the other rulers, Luise refused to leave Meiningen to flee the French and Russian forces. Having managed to maintain her authority, she joined with the Allies in 1813 having saved the duchy for her son. She instituted special taxes in the duchy, in order to provide the large dowry – 6,000 florins a year – for her daughter Adelheid upon her marriage to the future King William IV of the United Kingdom. Luise Eleonore continued to work to restore the duchy’s finances and economic position within Europe, leaving a well-managed government to her son upon his majority in 1821.\n\nFollowing her Regency, Luise Eleonore moved into the newly built Great Palace (link in German) in Meiningen, built by her son Bernhard for her to use as her dower home. While living there for the rest of her life, Luise Eleonore traveled extensively throughout Europe, including an extended visit to her daughter Adelheid in England, with whom she was very close.\n\nThe Dowager Duchess died in Meiningen, Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, now in Thuringia, Germany, on April 30, 1837, at the age of 73. She was buried in the Ducal Crypt Chapel (link in German) in the Meiningen municipal cemetery until 1977 when her remains were removed from the chapel, cremated, and buried elsewhere in the cemetery.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Initially, his seven sons collectively governed the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, as set out in their father’s will. On February 24, 1680, the seven brothers concluded a treaty of separation, with each brother getting a portion of the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha Altenburg and becoming a Duke. One of the seven new duchies was the Duchy of Saxe-Meinigen and Bernhard, one of the seven sons of Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg became the first Duke of Saxe-Meinigen.\n\nOn November 9, 1918, Wilhelm II abdicated as German Emperor and King of Prussia in the wake of the November Revolution. Bernhard III, the last Duke of Saxe-Meiningen abdicated the next day due to pressure from the Meininger Workers and Soldiers Council. His half-brother Ernst waived his succession rights on November 12, 1918, officially ending the monarchy of the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. Today the territory that encompassed the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen is in the German state of Thuringia.\n\n********************\n\nGeorg I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen\n\nGeorg I was Duke of Saxe-Meiningen from 1782 until 1803. He was born in the Imperial Free City of Frankfurt, now in Hesse, Germany, on February 4, 1761, the youngest son of Anton Ulrich, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Philippsthal. Georg had seven siblings:\n\nCharlotte (1751-1827) – married Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, had issue\n\nLuise (1752-1781) – married Landgrave Adolph of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld, had issue\n\nElisabeth (1753-1754-1782) – died in infancy\n\nKarl Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (1754) – married Princess Luise of Stolberg-Gedern, no issue\n\nFriedrich Franz (1756-1761) – died in childhood\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm (1757-1758) -died in infancy\n\nAmalie (1762-1798) – married Prince Carl Heinrich Erdmann of Carolath-Bytom\n\nGeorg also had ten elder half-siblings from his father’s first, morganatic, marriage to Philippine Elisabeth Caesar. Although all were given the title Prince/Princess, none were eligible to succeed to the ducal throne.\n\nGeorg became Duke of Saxe-Meiningen in July 1782, upon the death of his childless brother, Karl Wilhelm. Just four months later, he married Princess Luise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg on November 27, 1782, in Langenburg, Principality of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, now in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. Luise Eleonore was the daughter of Christian Albrecht, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and Caroline of Stolberg-Gedern. After ten years of marriage, Georg and Luise Eleonore started their family, having three children:\n\nPrincess Adelheid, Queen Adelaide of the United Kingdom (1792 – 1849) – married King William IV of the United Kingdom, no surviving issue\n\nPrincess Ida (1794 – 1852) – married Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, had issue\n\nBernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (1800 – 1882) – married Princess Marie Friederike of Hesse-Kassel, had issue\n\nOne of the first things Georg did upon becoming Duke was to open the Ducal library and art collections to the public. He also oversaw the design of the new English Garden in Meiningen on the site of the former municipal cemetery and began to transform Meiningen into a prestigious royal city. In neighboring Bad Liebenstein, he oversaw the redesign of the town, as well as Altenstein Castle and its surrounding parks. He also founded a Forestry Academy in neighboring Dreissigacker. Using his own funds, he established a new school to be built in honor of his son’s birth and also founded a school for the poor along with providing free medical care.\n\nHaving always been in poor health, Georg I died in Meiningen, Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, now in Thuringia, Germany on December 24, 1803, after developing a fever. He was buried in the Ducal Crypt Chapel (link in German) in the Meiningen municipal cemetery until 1977 when his remains were removed from the chapel, cremated, and buried elsewhere in the cemetery.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was born in the Imperial Free City of Frankfurt, now in the German state of Hesse, on November 19, 1754, to Anton Ulrich, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Philippsthal.

Because of his age, his mother served as Regent and was instrumental in bringing the duchy back from the brink of financial and economic disaster. Following his mother’s example, Karl Wilhelm worked to reduce the size of his court and help restore the finances of the duchy. He promoted education for the people of Saxe-Meiningen and founded one of the first teachers’ colleges.\n\nKarl Wilhelm married Princess Luise of Stolberg-Gedern on June 5, 1780, in Gedern, Principality of Stolberg-Gedern, now in the German state of Hesse. She was the daughter of Christian Karl, Prince of Stolberg-Gedern and Countess Eleonore of Reuss-Lobenstein.

She was born in Philippsthal, Landgraviate of Hesse-Philippsthal, now in the German state of Hesse, on August 11, 1730, to Carl I, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal and Princess Christina of Saxe-Eisenach.

He had previously contracted a morganatic marriage and had ten children, but they were not eligible to succeed to the ducal throne. This marriage was solely intended to provide an heir for Saxe-Meiningen. The couple had eight children:\n\nCharlotte (1751-1827) – married Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, had issue\n\nLuise (1752-1805) – married Landgrave Adolph of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld, had issue\n\nElisabeth (1753-1754) – died in infancy\n\nKarl Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (1754-1782) – married Princess Luise of Stolberg-Gedern, no issue\n\nFriedrich Franz (1756-1761) – died in childhood\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm (1757) -died in infancy\n\nGeorg I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (1761-1803) – married Princess Luise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, had issue\n\nAmalie (1762-1798) – married Prince Carl Heinrich Erdmann of Carolath-Bytom\n\nFollowing her husband’s death in 1763, Charlotte Amalie was appointed the sole guardian of their sons, and as such, served as Regent of Saxe-Meiningen. At the time, the duchy was in financial and economic ruin. Charlotte Amalie is credited with quickly restoring the duchy’s wealth through reforms, economic reconstruction, and strict austerity measures. Within a year, the government was again functioning effectively, for which she gained the nickname ‘Savior of the Duchy’. Her efforts were recognized by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, who appointed her as director of a commission to help the neighboring Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, which was financially in even more dire straits.\n\nIn 1782, when her younger son reached his majority, Charlotte Amalie ceased to serve as Regent. Several years earlier, she had taken possession of an estate in Sülzfeld, near Meiningen, in the Duchy of Saxe-Meinigen, now in the German state of Thuringia, previously owned by her sister-in-law Elisabeth Sophie of Brandenburg. She renamed the property Amalienruh and oversaw numerous expansions of the buildings and the grounds. Amalienruh became Charlotte Amalie’s primary residence after ceasing to serve as Regent.\n\nThe Dowager Duchess Charlotte Amalie died in Meiningen, Duchy of Saxe-Meinigen, now in the German state of Thuringia, on September 7, 1801. Per her wishes, she was not buried in the Castle Church at Elisabethenburg Palace – the traditional burial site of the Dukes of Saxe-Meiningen. Instead, she was interred in the Ducal Crypt Chapel (link in German) in the Meiningen municipal cemetery. In 1977, her remains were removed from the chapel, cremated, and buried elsewhere in the cemetery grounds.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He had four older siblings:\n\nElisabeth Ernestine (1681-1766) – unmarried\n\nEleonore Friederike (1683-1739) – unmarried\n\nAnton August (born and died 1684) – died in infancy\n\nWilhelmine Luise (1686-1753) – married Carl, Duke of Württemberg-Bernstadt, no issue\n\nHe also had seven half-siblings from his father’s first marriage to Marie Hedwig of Hesse-Darmstadt:\n\nErnst Ludwig I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (1672-1724) – married (1) Dorothea Maria of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, had issue; (2) Elisabeth Sophie of Brandenburg, no issue\n\nBernhard (1673-1694) – unmarried\n\nJohann Ernst (1674-1675) – died in infancy\n\nMarie Elisabeth (born and died 1676) – died in infancy\n\nJohann Georg (1677-1678) – died in infancy\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (1679-1746) – unmarried\n\nGeorg Ernst (1680-1699) – unmarried, died from smallpox\n\nIn Amsterdam on January 1711, Anton Ulrich secretly married Philippine Elisabeth Caesar, a lady-in-waiting to his elder sister Elisabeth Ernestine. The marriage was morganatic and was met with great disapproval from his family. Together they had ten children:\n\nPhilippine Antoinette (1712-1785)\n\nPhilippine Elisabeth (1713-1781)\n\nPhilippine Luise (1714-1771)\n\nPhilippine Wilhelmine (1715-1718)\n\nBernhard Ernst (1716-1778)\n\nAntonie Auguste (1717-1768)\n\nSophie Wilhelmine (1719-1723)\n\nKarl Ludwig (1721-1727)\n\nChristine Friederike (born and died 1723)\n\nFriedrich Ferdinand (born and died 1725)\n\nIn 1727, Anton Ulrich – through the benevolence of Holy Roman Emperor Karl VI – managed to have his wife and children raised to the rank of Prince/Princess of Saxe-Meiningen. However, they did not have any rights of succession. This was confirmed in 1744, just after Philippine Caesar’s death.\n\nWhen Anton Ulrich’s father, Bernhard, died in 1706, he decreed in his will that the duchy should not be divided and that his sons should rule jointly. This caused conflict between Anton Ulrich and his two elder half-brothers, Ernst Ludwig I and Friedrich Wilhelm, with Ernst Ludwig fighting to serve as sole ruler. Following his death in 1724, the conflict continued between Anton Ulrich and Friedrich Wilhelm who often disagreed and issued conflicting decrees. In 1742, Anton Ulrich moved to Frankfurt but continued to fight with his brother over the ruling of the duchy. Upon Friedrich Wilhelm’s death in 1746, Anton Ulrich became the sole ruler and Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. Although he was now the sole ruler, Anton Ulrich remained in Frankfurt, conducting most of his governmental duties from there, and only made occasional visits to Meiningen. With his children excluded from the line of succession, the Saxe-Meiningen line was in danger of becoming extinct. The Dukes of Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Gotha were already planning how to divide the territory should Anton Ulrich die without any legitimate heirs.\n\nThe succession question was soon resolved. On September 26, 1750, Anton married Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Philippsthal in Homburg von der Höhe. 43 years younger than Anton Ulrich, Charlotte Amalie was the daughter of Carl I, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal and Princess Christina of Saxe-Eisenach. Together they had eight children:\n\nCharlotte (1751-1827) – married Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, had issue\n\nLuise (1752-1895) – married Landgrave Adolph of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld, had issue\n\nElisabeth (1753-1754) – died in infancy\n\nKarl Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (1754-1782) – married Princess Luise of Stolberg-Gedern, no issue\n\nFriedrich Franz (1756-1761) – died in childhood\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm (1757-1758) -died in infancy\n\nGeorg I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (1761-1803) – married Princess Luise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, had issue\n\nAmalie (1762-1798) – married Prince Carl Heinrich Erdmann of Carolath-Beuthen\n\nIn 1747-1748, Anton Ulrich fought a battle with the neighboring Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (known as the Wasunger War). The Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg was looking forward to the likelihood that Saxe-Meiningen would be divided amongst the other Ernestine duchies upon Anton Ulrich’s death with no heirs, and was looking for any chance he could find to receive – or take by force – the lands he would likely inherit. After a dispute between two women over their precedence at court, Anton Ulrich intervened, siding with one of the women and harshly treating the other’s family. When the Imperial Court ruled against Anton Ulrich, and he refused to accept their decision, this gave Friedrich III of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg the pretext to invade the city of Wasungen. The dispute was eventually resolved through mediation from Prussia.\n\nAfter a reign of nearly 17 years, Anton Ulrich died in the Free City of Frankfurt, now in Hesse, Germany, on January 27, 1763. His remains were buried in the castle church at Elisabethenburg Palace in Meiningen, Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, now in Thuringia, Germany.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
