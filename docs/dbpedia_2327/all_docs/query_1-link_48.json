Does Tuaim da Ghualainn occur in the Dinnseanchus? it appears to have been a name of Pagan celebrity. No feature can be shown now, which might Claim this name: the spot, however, which tradition says, gave originally name to Tuam, is still pointed out in John Costelloe's garden, who is a merchant in Shop St. in this town. It is called the Chair of Tuam, in which sat after his election, the member formerly returned by Tuam as a borough, to Parliament.\n\nThe parish of Tuam was heretofore divided into two parishes, the one of which was called Paraiste na Scrine, or Theampaill na Scrine, the parish of Skreen, from Teampall na Scrine of the which, we shall speak hereafter; and the other Paraiste Iarlatha or Theampaill Iarlatha, that is St. Iarlath's parish. The former was the Eastern part of the present parish; and the latter the western portion.\n\n[32]\n\n[Hand of Patrick O'Keeffe:]\n\nDunmore Barony\n\nTUAM:\n\n{Immediately following the Life of S. larlaith Archbp. of Armagh.}\n\nOF S. IARLAITH BISHOP OF TUAM\n\nSame day XI of February\n\nAASS. p 308, col. a.\n\nIn the same fifth (1) age, in which S. Hierlatius, Prelate of Armagh {flourished} in Ulster, another of the same name and Pontifical (i.e. Episcopal) dignity, and not of inferior renown or merit flourished in Connaught, namely S. Hierlatius Bishop of the Church of Tuam, which is the metropolis (2) of that province. Sprung from a noble race, he had for his father Loga, {called} by others Lughus (3) the son of Denius (4) deriving his extraction from the noble family of the Conmacnians; and for his mother Mongfinnia the daughter of Cirdubhan (5) of the illustrious stock of the Connennii; and he himself by the splendour of his own virtues more illustriously adorned the nobility derived from this (high) birth.\n\n[33]\n\nIn his youth he became a disciple of S. Benignus (who was) the disciple of S. Patk. and his successor in the see of Armagh, and the special patron and Apostle of the Conmacnians ***\n\n{col: b} But these are {says the author of the Life of S. Beniguus {9. Nov.} the foster-children of S. Benignus .1. Callianus, the son of Nietach, Bishop, and Ierlatius the son of Loga, Bishop; for it is S. Benignus who instructed them, taught them letters, promoted them to orders, blessed and consecrated their Churches, and induced their friends and relatives to treat them humanely & charitably; and who in the spiritual government presided officially, over the entire Clergy and people of the Conmaicne. ***\n\nAmong the disciples of S. Benignus are also reckoned saints Nectanus or Nectarius, Curnanus, Buedanus, Mugan, Buadmelus, Berranus, Modimocus, Carillus, or Carolus and the seven sons of Damangart and other distinguished men.\n\n[34]\n\nIII. But S. Hierlaith under so great a teacher made such a progress equally in human and divine literature, and particularly in the exercises of holy virtues, that he himself afterwards became a celebrated master. Wherefore first he built a Monastery in the territory of Conmaicne (9) not far from the Metropolis of Tuam, in a place, {as is believed} which is called Cluainfois (10), and there he opened a school (11) to which as to a singular gymnasium of piety & {p. 309} salutary wisdom many disciples, afterwards conspicuous for sanctity, flocked together; of whom the first not in the order of time (12), but by the prerogative of sanctity was the Great Brendan, who sailed over the Ocean afterwards for the space of seven years; and (who was) the father and Abbot (Archimandrita) of three thousand (13) Monks; but the second in the same order {was} S. Colman the son of Leninius,\n\n[35]\n\nthe founder and first Bishop of the Church of Cluain (14) in South Munster. But at the close of the fifth (15) century, or the beginning of the sixth, they came, the former as yet of tender age, the latter recently converted from the vanities of the world, to S. larlaith then an old man, and (for) some time before Bishop of that (16) district, and diligently intent on instructing and directing in the way of the Commandments of Christ, not a few disciples in that aforesaid his Monastery (17) from the death of his master S. Benignus, which is said to have (18) happened about the year 467; and under his direction they for a time drank with thirst the cups of salutary doctrine. For as Augustin Magradin says in the life of S. Brendan. [quotation follows - *** as authority for the above} ***\n\n[36]\n\n*** the same author {i.e. of the Life of S. Brendan} in these words: But he began also among other gifts of God, to excel in the spirit of prophecy. For on one occasion, the Holy Spirit revealing, he foretold to the holy Prelate Iarlaith the place of his burial thus: You will not rise here father, but your resurrection will be elsewhere. To whom the old man says: O holy boy why do you conceal many secrets of God in yourself? for I know that you have the holy Spirit, and much power lies hid in you; you came to me that you might learn, and (now) from this out you shall be my master; receive me therefore as a Monk and disciple of yours henceforward; therefore tell the place of my resurrection. To whom Brendan says: you shall proceed towards the east, and where the wheels of your chariot are (shall be) broken, there build an oratory and remain; there also many shall rise again with you in glory. The holy Prelate\n\n[37]\n\nmounts the chariot, and entering upon his journey the two wheels of his chariot were broken not far from his cell, and there a Monastery was built, of which the name is Tuaim da gualand. ***\n\n{309, col. b.} But S. Iarlaith was not only the founder, but also the first Bishop of the Church of Tuam, which being erected about the beginning of the Sixth century (19) is the Metropolis of Connaught, as Ware testifies in his List of the Bishops of the same see. I come, says he, to those of Tuam. The first Bishop of this see was S. larlathus who adorned Tuam {anciently Tuaim-da-gualann} with a sacred edifice in the first ages of the rising Church. Whence in the life of S. Brendan, Tuam is called the city of S. larlath.\n\n***\n\n[38]\n\nWare says he flourished about the year 550.\n\nS. Hierlatius Logae filius, primus Ecclesiae Tuamensis Autistes, floruit circa annum 550.\n\nColgan does not believe it - he thinks it probable (for reasons adduced) that S. larlath died before or about the year 540.\n\n{p. 310.) But his sacred ashes with his other holy relicks laid up in a precious shrine, are preserved at Tuam, not indeed in the Cathedral Church, which being dedicated to his name (21) is (otherwise) called Teampull Iarlaithi, that is, the Temple of Ierlath; but in a certain Chapel (22) which is called Scrin, and on account of the reverence paid to the treasure preserved in it is always held in the highest veneration. But although I durst not define the day on which his principal feast ought to be celebrated, I think however that it is observed on a different day, from the 26th of December, on which (23) his birthday is placed by some, since the Nativity of the Lord and that of S. Stephen which fall upon that day, seem to exclude\n\n[39]\n\nevery other solemnity from the same. But I advert from the records of his own Church, that on the 6th of June is used to be celebrated his festival {which seems to be that of his translation or commemoration). But since our Hagiographers every where relate that the feast of S. Hierlatius (25) is celebrated on the third of the ides of February, and do not indicate whether he be S. Hierlatius of Armagh, or rather of Tuam, therefore we have thought proper to set down at this day what has occurred concerning both.\n\n{Not having room at the end of the notes to this life for the following passage, we insert it here}\n\nDE S. NUADATO ARCHIEPISCOPO ARDMACHANO\n\nXIX. Feb.\n\nAA.SS. 373.\n\nNOTA\n\n1. 2. Non ille Abbas Cluaneosensis anno 746, nec Abbas Tuaim-da-ualand 877 mortuus. Thus at the same years the Four Masters in the Annals, speaking thus of the former (thus): Nuadus the son of Dubslevius Abbot of Cluain-eois died. Of the latter: Nuadus Hua Bolcain Abbot of Tuaim-da-ualand died. But Marian Gorman and the Mart. of Donegal hand down that the birth-day of the former is celebrated on the 2nd day of December. And the latter perhaps is S. Nuadatus the Anchorite, who, they hand down, is venerated on the 3rd of October.\n\n[40]\n\nNOTES p. 310, col: a.\n\nIt is to be lamented that the acts of this man of most celebrated sanctity have perished, or if they be ex[t]ant, that they have not been brought to public light.\n\n1. Eodem saeculo quinto, Cap. 1. For he was instructed in letters and promoted to sacred orders by Saint Benignus according to what is said above in chap. 2. But Saint Benignus died in the year 467 or 468 according to Ware above chap. 1. And although he lived to the end of the fifth age according to what is to be said at the 9th of November, yet he flourished in the year 460 as is evident from the acts of S. Patrick whose disciple he was.\n\n2. Quae istius provinciae est Metropolis. Cap. I. That the See of Tuam, was first raised to the Metropolis of Connaught in the year of Christ 1152, we are informed by Giraldus Cambrensis in {his} Topography of Ireland dist. 3. ch. 17. Ware in the catalogue of the Bishops of Tuam, and others in common; because in that year Cardinal Paparo sent by Eugene III the high Pontiff, constituted four Archbishopricks, {viz those} of Armagh, Dublin, Cashel, and Tuam. But this necessarily is to be understood of (concerning) the right of the pallium; for it is certain that in each of the four principal provinces of Ireland there were Archbishops before, although that dignity was not always annexed to a determinate see {if you except {that} of Armagh, which ([immediately &]) continually from the time of S. Patrick was the Metropolis of the entire Kingdom) as we (have) shown in the notes to the life of S. Maidoc at the 31st of January. Whence Ware in his list of the Bishops of Tuam speaking of\n\n[41]\n\nS. Hierlatius and others his six successors, who preceded the time that Paparo brought over the pallium, says: Our Writers call these, Bishops, ({&}) sometimes Archbishops of Connaught. There were therefore according to him Archbishops either of Tuam, or at least in Connaught before the year 1152.\n\n3. Patrem habuit Logam, aliis Lughum &c. Cap. I. Thus the author of the life of S. Benignus Cap. II. Ware on the Writers of Ireland lib. I. cap. 3. Usher pag 955. The Sanctilogium genealogicum chap. 26.\n\n4. Denii filium ex Conmacniorum familia &c. Cap. 1. Thus the same Sanctilogium in the same place, where giving the genealogy of the Saints descending from the stock of Cormac, or from the family of the Conmacnii, it says: S. Hierlatius the son of Denius, the son of Modharnus, the son of Dubanus, the son of Fraichus, the son of Kectus, the son of Fricus, the son of Erdalius, &c. Whence the author of the Irish life of S. Brendan errs in chap. 9 where he says that Loga his father was the son of Trienius, the son of Tiegus, the son of Moctaeus &c. since this genealogy in part is rather that of S. Hierlatius Archbishop of Armagh, according to what is said above on this very day.\n\n5. Mongfinnian Cirdubhani filiam &c. cap. I. Thus the Culdee {in his} book on the Mothers of the Saints of Ireland number 75. Mongfinnia, he says, the daughter, of the race of Cenneann was the mother of S. Hierlatius the son of Logae of Tuaim da gualann.\n\n6. 7. S. Benignus S. Patricii discipulus & successor ac Conmacniorum Apostolus - cap. 2.

Callin was {according the Sanctilogium genealogicum chap. 26.} the son of Nietach, the son of Dubhan &c. But this Dubhan had another son\n\n[42]\n\nModarnus, whose grandson {310 col. b.} S. Iarlaith was, according to what is said in num. 4. see more concerning S. Callin at the 13th of November.\n\n9. Monasterium extruxit non procul à Metropoli Tuamensi &c. cap. 3. This appears from the words cited above chap. 4. from the life of S. Brendan.\n\n10. (a) In loco, qui creditur esse Cluainfois. cap. 3. For this Church, which is now only a Chapel, is not far from Tuam, situated in the Parish of the principal Church, as the catalogue of the Churches of the Diocese of Tuam hands down. The Chapel, it says, of Cluainfois in the parish of Tuam, in which that S. Hierlatius fixed his abode the etymon of the word itself seems to insinuate; for Fos signifies the same as abode {dwelling} and Cluain-fois the same as the retreat of dwelling; as if that name was imposed on the place from the dwelling of S. Iarlaith and his disciples there before they had come to Tuam.\n\n11. Ibique scholam aperuit. cap. 3. It is collected from the life of S. Brendan in the words adduced in chs. 3. & 4. where it is said that S. Brendanus glowing with love of the scriptures, &c hearing the fame of S. Hierlatius came to him, and remained with him for a time, drinking with thirst the cups of salutary doctrine.\n\n12. Quorum primus non ordine temporis &c. cap. 3. He had many disciples before S. Brandan, as appears from Chap. 3 & 4.\n\n13. Trium millium Monachorum pater &c. cap. 3. Thus the Chronicles of the world, and Werner in his fasciculus temporum at the year 554, and Ware on the Writers of Ireland, lib. I. cap. 2. Saint Brendan, says he, Abbot {the son of Finloga} by country a Kerry-man, was educated by Bishop Erc, he built the Monastery of Clonfert in the land of Galway in the year 558, and another afterwards, {i.e. that} of Enach-dun. In these and other Communities founded by him, he is said to have presided over three thousand Monks. See his life at the 16th of May.\n\n[43]\n\n15. Exeunte quinto saeculo aut ineunte sexto &c. cap. 3. For after S. Brandan remained some time under his discipline, he returned to S. Erc Bishop, as is read in both lives of S. Brendan above cited; but Saint Erc died in the year 512 according to the Four Masters in the Annals.\n\n16. Aliquan diu ante illlius regionis Episcopum Cap. 3. For he was a Bishop, and an old man before the Church of Tuam was built, as appears from what is said in chap. 3 & 4.\n\n17. A morte sui magistri S. Benigni &c. Cap. 3. For it was Saint Benignus who blessed his Church, as is had in the life of S. Benignus himself chap. 11.\n\n18. Quae in annum circiter 467 fertur incidisse, c. 3. Thus Ware lib. 1. chap. 1. Saint Benignus, he says, died in the year of Christ 467 vel 468.\n\n19. Circa Initium saeculi sexti erectae. cap. 5. For S. Brendan remained with S. Hierlatius, until he began to dwell at Tuam; and consequently to build; but he departed from him before the year 512, as appears from what is said in num. 15.\n\n21.(b) Templum Iarlaithe &c. Thus the above cited catalogue of the Churches of the Diocese of Tuam. The Cathedral Church, it says, of Tuam situated at Tuam, is called Tempull Iarlaithe; dedicated to S. Hierlatius the first Bishop of Tuam, before this see was erected into an Archiepiscopal {one}. His festival day is celebrated on the 6th of June.\n\n22. (c) quae Scrin vocatur Cap. 2. The same list, The (celebrated) Parish, it says, of Scrin in the city of Tuam, in which was buried the body of S. Hierlatius the first Bishop of Tuam.\n\n23. Quam 26. Decembris quo à quibusdan natalis ejus ponitur C. 9. It is so placed by Maguire, the Calendar of Cashel and the Martyrology of Donegal; but by the Martyrology of Tallagh on the 25th of December; but Marian Gorman, who otherwise with the greatest exactness observes the birth-days of the Saints treats of him at neither day; he only mentions at the 11th of February a S. Hierlatius without determining whether he be the Prelate of Tuam or of Armagh.\n\n24. Die sexto Junii Cap. 9. Appears from what is said in num. 21.\n\n25. Tertio idus Februarii. Thus at the same day Marian Gorman, Maguire and the Martyrology of Donegal. See concerning him Ware in his list of the Bishops of Tuam c. 1 & lib. I. on the Writers of Ireland, chap. 2. and Usher on the Origin of the British Church chap. 7. pag 914 & 915 where he says: In Tuamensi vero Metropoli Iarlathi filii Logae, qui proximé in catalogo sequitur adhuc celebris est memoria; cum quo senectute jam confecto, Brendanum adhuc juvenem versatum idem memorat Biographus &c.\n\n[44]\n\n[NOTES BY THOMAS O'Connor] (a) [Referred to on MS p. 42] Cluain-fois (Cluain-fois) is now the name of a\n\ntownland, Anglicised Cloonfush, which is bounded on the N. by the parishes of Belclare, and Kilbannon; on the S. and W. by the parish of Killour and townland of Killmore; and on the East by Killaloonty townland.\n\n[Added in pencil:] TUAM PARISH\n\nIn the North end of this townland ([In pencil]: Cloonfush), (a short distance from the River of Clare to the East), is remaining a portion of an old Church Called Tempall Iarlaithe - templum S. Iarlaithe, at which children are still interred. The west gable remains, 3 yards broad of it (inside) retaining nearly its original height; and 2 yards in length on inside, of the North side-wall attached to this gable, stand as yet. Its highest part is about 7½ feet. The west gable appears to have had a window or opening on, or near its top. The original length of the building inside, as far as is traceable (definable) by the foundation, which can still be traced, was 13 yards by 4 yds.\n\nThe cement is composed of lime and sand.\n\n[45]\n\nAt the distance of 6 or 7 yards from the S. East corner, lies a stone having a circular Cavity nearly central in it, which is about 1 foot in diameter and narrows itself gradually to the bottom, where it does not exceed 3 inches in diameter. Its depth varies with the uneveness of the stone, being 6 inches in the deepest part, and gradually lessening on another side to 2 or 3 inches. This stone was, it is said, originally a holy water font; and the people, who go on any (the) occasion of attending a child's funeral to the place, sprinkle themselves with the water found in it. The common phrase is that they bless themselves with it.\n\n[46]\n\n(b) [Referred to on MS p. 43] (Note) 21 - TEMPLUM IARLAITHE\n\nThe local name for the Cathedral, at present is St. Mary's, because it belonged to St. Mary's Abbey, as is the general impression. In a church (yard) close to the N.E. of the Cathedral, there was an Abbey. The ruins of a church, which was formerly a parish one, are still to be seen here. To this Church, the people apply the name of Teampall Iarlatha ([In pencil:] Temple Jarlath), the temple (church) of S. Iarlath. Are they wrong?\n\nSt. larlath's day is still remembered in this parish. The College of Tuam being dedicated to this Saint, the 6th of June is enjoyed as a holy day yearly by the Students.\n\n[NOTES BY THOMAS O'CONOR CONTINUED] St larlath's well, which is frequented on his festival day, lies about ½ a mile from Tuam town, in a S.E. direction, and being about a quarter of a mile from the Dublin road, (&) to S.(W.) side of it. This is a spring, but now nearly dried up; situated in the corner of a field in N. end of the townland of Tobar Iarlatha, to which it gives name. There are some white thorn bushes, and briars about it.\n\n[47]\n\nAt the East end of the Cathedral is placed a stone cross, the shaft of which has been broken off nearly as far as the arms. On the side of it now facing the East, is in relief, the figure of a bishop, (probably intended to represent St. larlath), holding his crozier, the crook of which has been broken off, in his left hand; and wearing a Cap of nearly a conical shape. Two figures are placed, one on each side of the bishop. The crucifixion is represented on the back of this Cross. It was a long time used as a Market Cross in the town (being set up at the market house gate); and was removed here by the mob, to mark the grave of Bishop Sing, who was well liked by them. The pedestal remains as yet in the old shambles. Eastward of the Cathedral, and close to (near) the wall enclosing the ground about it, lies the body of this cross, which is as large as a moderate sized tombstone, and has a tenant on one end, indicating its having been heretofore placed on a pedestal.\n\nThe entrance to the Cathedral is singularly magnificent. It is a perfectly circular arch built with red grit ('greet') stone, is 22½ feet broad at the base, and no less than 16 feet high, (from the ground) to the keystone. The door inside this is likewise perfectly circular, on each side of which, is a window of a similar form,\n\nI don't know what kind of stone is used in this part; but it exhibits a beautifully ornamented construction.\n\n[In LH margin:] A pointed arch springing from the ground, is to be seen, raising itself over the organ inside the Church. These are said to be all the remnants of the original establishment adopted into the work of the present building.\n\n[48]\n\nStanding against the west gable, close to the entrance, and on N. side of it, is the shaft of a cross, which is 4½ ft. high 14 inches broad, and 8 inches on the sides exhibiting the inscriptions.\n\nOn the South side, as it stands at present is the following Irish inscription.\n\nOR DO chomarda, Iarlaithe do Aed u ossin las indernad in chrossa\n\nOratio pro Comarbano Iarlathi Aedo u-Ossin per quem facto est haec crux.\n\n[49]\n\nHas Mr. Petrie copied this inscription before it became (partly) effaced?\n\nThe Four Masters record that in A.D. 1161 'Hugh (Aedh) O'Hoissein, Archbishop of Tuam head of the piety and chastity of Leithcuinn, died'. The O'Hossins are still in the neighbourhood.\n\nIt would be well worthy of enquiry to as (certain) upon what (memorable) occasion, this Cross was erected as a testimonial to this Archbishop, and to the King Toirdelbuch {Turlogh O'Conor}.\n\nIt probably belonged to the Priory of St. John the Baptist, of which, according to Archdall from War: Mon: Tordelvac O'Conor, King of Ireland, was the founder about the year 1140. See hereafter, where the site of this priory will be described.\n\nOn the East side of the tower of the Cathedral, is inscribed externally.\n\nJACO. 2O. REGE\n\nJOHO.

(JOHN) THE BAPTIST\n\nArchdall in his Monasticon says that, 'the Priory of St. John the Baptist was founded about the year 1140 by Tirdelvac O'Conor King of Ireland. We cannot say to what order this house did belong' (e) War: Mon:\n\nThis priory was situated in Vicar St. to the rear of John Egan's house, Esqr. There are no remains of it now; the name however is retained in the houses built on the cemetery, which belonged to it, for they go by the name of John's Abbey\n\n[62]\n\nABBEY OF THE HOLY TRINITY\n\nThe just cited writer says that, 'this abbey was founded by one of the family of Burgh, either in the reign of King John, or in the beginning of King Henry III, for Premonstre Canons' (f) War: Mon:\n\nThe site of this abbey is still to be seen, immediately to the N. of the road leading from Tuam to Galway, at the extremity of Church Street, and about 110 yards N.W. of the Cathedral.\n\nA considerable part of it remained till the year 1791, when Archdeacon Burton carried off the stones for the building of a house. The Four Masters state that - A.D. 1256 O'Giollarain, abbot of Trinity Church at Tuaim, died.\n\n[63]\n\nCHAPEL OF ST. BRIDGET\n\nArchdall writes that 'an Inquisition of September XXVIII Elizabeth finds that this chapel, then in ruins and in this town did belong to her majesty and which said chapel was probably founded for a Chantry {h 4} Chief Remem'.\n\nThis ([In pencil:] The) chapel, it is locally said, had its situation, a short distance to the S.W. of the Cathedral, at a gate to North of Teerboy road, (directly) opposite Mr. Potter's house, and near where the just mentioned road branches to Loughrea and Galway. Human bones were found in the field into which the gate opens, just at the entrance to it, at various periods during the progress of its cultivation. The cemetery is supposed to have been at this spot.\n\n[64]\n\nA stream which takes its rise in Cloontuah bog, and running through a meadow between this place and the Cathedral, and crossing the Galway Road to about 5 perches to S.W. of the site of Trinity Abbey; (afterwards) joining Caolabhainn, (&) accompanying its waters to Clare river, is called to this day srufan Brighde, the Stream of S. Brigid.\n\nThe wonderful Castle {Castellum mirificum} which is said to have been built by Roderick O'Conor, stood across the centre of Shop Street, within a few yards of the Mitre Hotel. Part of the wall of the Bawn is used (as) the front wall of two publick houses belonging to Richard Savage Esqr. Sovereign of Tuam, one of which is occupied by himself, and the other by - Cloonan.\n\nThe S. East corner of the enclosing wall of John Costelloe's garden, mentioned above on the occasion of speaking of the Chair of Tuam, is said to have belonged to a turret of 'the wonderful Castle'.\n\n[65]\n\n[In pencil at top of page: these are enumerated from the Name-books.]\n\nIn Aughgloragh townland Áth Glórach, explained as signifying the noisy ford, there is an old church and an old castle in ruins. And in Ballymoat townland Beul Atha an Mhota, the mouth of the ford of the moat, is a burial ground. There is an old court and children's burying place in Birmingham's Demesne townland.\n\nThe ruins of an old Castle stand in Castletown townland to which it gave name.\n\nIn Killeen townland Cillín, there is a burying place for children, which gave name to the townland. Another burying place for children lies in Leana-mor- townland, Léine Mór, great holme, and one in Forty acres T.L.\n\nIn Ryehill {Cnoc A t-Seagail}townland, is also a burial ground.\n\nA burying place for children lies in Carnaan (Carnan) townland.\n\nAnd a burial ground in Cloonmore townland, Cluain Mór."
