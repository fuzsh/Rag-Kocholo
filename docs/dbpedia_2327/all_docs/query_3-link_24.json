        "text": "John Ambrose Vesey\n\nBorn 24th April 1933\n\nAttended Palmers School and was a member of the Class of 1949.\n\nFirst job was with Burrows, manufacturers of counting machines.\n\nJohn then spent two years working with accounts at Roland Hall. For company he had Bryan Coker and Tom Shiner who became his friends.\n\nPheonix Timber in Rainham was the next company that John worked for, and after some time he left to run his own firm. He was a Director and major shareholder of Overseas Packing Ltd, Foxton Road, Grays. Large amounts of orders were taken for wooden casings from Ford Motor Co Ltd.\n\nIt was a time of massive export of vehicles that were “knocked down” at Dagenham. Finished vehicles were taken apart, crated in wooden casings and delivered all over the world. When shipping containers started to be introduced less casings were made, and John diversified into import of timber.\n\nJohn had a love of sports cars including a sunbeam to a mini cooper.\n\nAfter retiring John undertook a number of positions within the community, He was the Conservative Councillor for the Chafford Ward at Thurrock Council for a time, also a member of the Viola Trust which provided monies for many local community projects.\n\nHe became the NHS Thameside Health Trust Chair during times of massive restructuring regarding care in the community. Decisions made at that time are still having an effect today.\n\nJohn was an Independent member of Thurrock Council planning committee for six years and represented The Campaign for the Protection of Rural England.\n\nPalmers College was very dear to his heart and he was an old Palmerian and also a former member of the Corporation of the college.\n\nJohn was Clerk to the Palmers Sixth Form College Trust for many years up to his passing. Ensuring the Land and Buildings owned by the Trust are protected for the future and the monies generated from the investments of the Trust are spent on the future welfare of the pupils in Grays. He strongly defended these principles.\n\nJohn was a member of Grays Thurrock Rotary since 1971 and lived with his wife Maureen in Orsett, they have one son Mathew and three Grandchildren."
