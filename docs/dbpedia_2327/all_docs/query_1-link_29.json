        "text": "Some Historical Notes......1800 on\n\nIn 1801, the Church of Ireland was united to the Church of England, following the 'Act of Union'. It remained united until the Disestablishment Act of 1869, which severed this union. In 1833 the 'Church Temporalities Act' became law. By this Act, the number of Sees in Ireland was reduced. There had been four Archbishops in the Church of Ireland: Armagh, Dublin, Cashel and Tuam, but the Act reduced this number to two: Armagh and Dublin, Tuam and Cashel were reduced to Bishoprics and ten other Bishoprics were suppressed, and their Sees united to neighbouring Diocese'. After Disestablishment, the Church of Ireland was no longer the 'State Church' in Ireland, and Parishes had to shoulder the burden of supporting their Clergy and maintaining their Churches, more so than in the past. Nevertheless, new Churches continued to be built in the Diocese of Meath, including: Foyran, Moyliscar, Durrow, Moydrum, and Shannon-Bridge, (these five have been closed in recent years). Although Church building was continuing, between 1870 and 1910, decline had set in and the frequency of Services in many rural Churches was reduced. In the 'Parliamentary Returns' by John Erck, published in 1867, he paints a rather sorry picture of rural Church attendance. He notes that in rural areas, where the Anglicans are thinly scattered, the attendance is miserable, in many cases, consisting of only one or two families. There is a story told about the Duke of Leinster, who was travelling back to Maynooth, in his carriage, meeting his Curate returning from Church early. The Duke asked the Curate, why he was out so early, to which the Curate replied: \"She is ill!\". There was but one woman who attended the Church.\n\nThis account of Church life in the period 1870-1910, makes one wonder what a typical Church of Ireland Church Service would have been like to attend. Small congregations and cold Churches seem to be the main complaint. Mary Ponsonby writes about attending Church in 1880: \"A dismal barn-like building so cold and damp that even in summertime it struck a chill all through one. The floor is ill-paved, the plaster peeling off the walls and the cushions moth eaten\". Lady Alice Howard was another who found Church-going depressing. She writes in her diary, one Sunday, in 1882: \"Very dreary, such a dull old parson and the Church nearly empty\". In Edwardian times, Anglicans became renowned for their lack of piety and many found going to Church a bore, though not perhaps to the extent, as Lord Mayo's unmarried sister, Lady Florence Bourke, who, when attending Church near her family home in County Kildare, would relieve the tedium of the sermon by jabbing the people in front of her with her hat pin!.\n\nFollowing the First World War and the Irish Civil War, many of the Ascendancy families left Ireland and combined with the numbers who were killed in the War, the number of Irish Anglicans declined drastically. This decline continued after the Second World War, and it became clear that major changes were needed to reorganise the Church of Ireland. A 'City and Town Parishes Commission' was established in 1948 to investigate the problem of too many Church buildings. The Commission drew up a scheme for the Diocese of Dublin, in 1959, and recommended the closure of ten city centre Churches, including: St. Mary's in Mary Street, St. James, in James Street, St. Aidan's and Christ Church, Carysfort Avenue. In 1965, the process began in the Diocese of Meath and Churches such as: Kilshine, Balrathboyne, Kilbeggan, Kilmessan, Collinstown, Castletown-Kilpatrick, Painestown, Stackallen and Laracor were all closed and de-consecrated. Those Churches , not closed, were amalgamated into larger Groups or Unions of Parishes and the number of Clergy, serving in the Diocese was reduced also. Further decline continued in the 1970's and the Diocese of Meath was united to the Diocese of Kildare, in 1976. By 1986, it was clear that, another round of Church closure was needed. A 'Commission on Church Buildings' was established by the General Synod, and in the Diocese of Meath and Kildare, it recommended 29 Church closures. In the area around Kells, the following Churches were closed: Moynalty, Moybollogue, Drumconrath, Tara, Bective, Galtrim, Ballivor, Clonmellon, Drumcree, Loughcrew and Mayne. Most of these Churches were only in use 'part-time' and had very few attending Services. Nevertheless the pain of these closures was deeply felt, as we all have a great sense of love and affection towards our Church buildings.\n\nToday there is a greater desire to preserve the heritage of our past. Old Church buildings have taken on a new lease of life in the Diocese, with some being converted into houses and others serving a new function in their local areas. On the great Hill of Tara, seat of the High Kings of Ireland, the small Church has been restored and is used to tell the story of Tara. Its interior has been restored and its original furnishings, lovingly restored. The Church in Moynalty has been converted into a Credit Union Office (a form of Community Bank), for the village. Bective Church is now an artists studio and Ballivor has become a heritage centre. Thirty years ago these buildings would have been demolished or allowed to fall into ruin, but attitudes have changed and preservation is taking a bigger priority.\n\nThis brief account of life in the Church of Ireland in this Diocese may have given the impression that the Church of Ireland is a relic of the past, nothing could be further than the truth. Week by week over thirty Churches are used in the Diocese and the Sacraments of the Church administered. Parish Schools in various Parishes still educate the young of our Churches. Parochial organisations, such as the Mothers' Union, Girls' Brigade, Boys' Brigade, Girls Friendly Society and many other social and recreational activities flourish. Flower festivals, Choral evenings, Celtic festivals, Charity events all take place and inject a vibrancy into our Parishes. Certainly, difficulties have affected the Church of Ireland in the past, but we go forward, into the future, with faith."
