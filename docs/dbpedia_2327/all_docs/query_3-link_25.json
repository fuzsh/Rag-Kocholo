        "text": "The obituary said the cause was pneumonia. John would have been 68 in 1992, so that’s probably true. His death was probably not AIDS-related. It doesn’t really matter, as long as he is dead.\n\nJohn Vesey was not fabulous. Fabulous, if used at all, might refer to detergent or something found in a strip mall in West Virginia. No, John Vesey was important.\n\nHe started out in antiques before designing and producing his own furniture. His pieces went for thousands and were the must-haves of high-society in the 50’s and 60’s, if there was such a thing. Various Vanderbilts, the occasional Rockefeller, Sunny von Bulow, Vidal Sassoon, Diana Ross; aristocrats, French, Italian, even English. Top drawer, upper crust, the very swell, all coveted a piece of John Vesey.\n\nAmong his minor roles was that of good friend to Sally Hughes and god-father to her daughter Susie. Susie was about my age. Sally was my Auntie Mame. She opened many a new window and door for this budding homosexual. I often snuck away from Baltimore for weekends with them, seeking adventure in their place in Princeton. The house on Edgerstoune Road was the destination for weekend parties.\n\nSally knew people. People like John, important and very interesting people: writers, artists, actors, even a senator or two. Sally was an excellent chef which made her weekends exceptional. She was also mischievous and cooking, like everything else in Sally’s life, required a great deal of vodka and countless cartons of Chesterfields. Regardless of when Sally started dinner, it was rarely served before the 11:00 o’clock news.\n\nThere was one particularly outrageous meal-of-many-courses, where people kept leaving the table only to return in one of Sally’s dresses. She was a big girl. Sally eventually died of lung cancer in St. Martin. It took me years to grow into the knit suit I inherited from her, but I digress.\n\nHer house was also a staging area for sojourns into Manhattan. She managed to get a bunch of tickets for Hair when it was at the Public Theater. Eight of us packed into her suped-up 1964 Buick Electra with a couple of joints for that evening.\n\nIt was an adolescent’s dream come true.\n\nSally and Susie were all a twitter that Uncle John was coming out for the weekend and I must come up from Baltimore to meet him and okay, says I.\n\nSally and Susie were both tall girls. Sally was taller than me and Susie was still growing. John stood over all of us at 6’7”. Not over or underweight, just big. Shaking hands with him made me feel uncomfortable and awkward, like he wanted me to know how big he was and how large his hands were.\n\nIt was a lazy Saturday afternoon. We were sitting around the den, getting high and listening to Crosby, Stills & Nash. Sally and Susie went up for a nap. I was headed out to the pool when John asked if I played Bridge. No, I said. “You don’t? Oh. Well, if you did, you’d know that you can lose a game and still win the rubber. But even if you win, you still lost that first game. Nothing can change that.” He returned to Manhattan early Sunday morning.\n\nI thought he was kind of creepy.\n\nBefore I left for Baltimore, Sally asked what I thought of John. I told her I thought he was kind of creepy. I told her the story and she agreed. He was being creepy and she apologized for him.\n\nSome months later, we learned that Uncle John had moved quite suddenly to the Seychelles Islands, a republic without extradition treaties. He had been accused of sexual assault. He returned to be convicted and jailed for five years. I suspect the scale of evil ex-pats in the Seychelles was not very welcoming to a mere homosexual rapist, but I digress.\n\n… the most horrible case of homosexual mutilation …\n\nAccording to Assistant District Attorney Alan Broomer, it was “the most horrible case” of homosexual mutilation he’d seen “in years.” The mutilation that required two surgeries to correct was the result of anal penetration by Uncle John’s very large hands.\n\nThat part of the story was not deemed fit to print. It was, however, circulated through back channels. If nothing else, Sally had backchannels at both the New York Times and Daily News.\n\nApparently, there had been other attacks. This young man however, lived, and had the courage to testify. Others were not so lucky or so bold.\n\nOh My God, Kenny, I had no idea …\n\nShe was not the only one, but others had their suspicions. Other of John’s victims were left in dumpsters or on curbs, alone, frightened, confused, ashamed. John may have been one of the most flagrant, but certainly not the only sociopath of his kind.\n\nThe Johns all had one thing in common: they believed the victim would be too ashamed or too embarrassed to come forward. They were homosexuals, perverts, or hustlers, sub-humans that could not be counted as credible witnesses. In the end, they deserved what they got. It’s one of the most disturbing kind of homophobia — internalized.\n\nThere was a well-known realtor with a house on Gramercy Park and a house in the Hamptons. He liked to drug young men and take them home and rape them. But this wasn’t talked about openly.\n\nJust like good christians, it would be rude to mention the priest is a pedophile. Knowing parents would just say, “Watch out for that one.” Others might have assumed you were cool with being abused, roofied and raped, or maybe it was just your dumb luck, or isn’t it time for coffee or a cocktail? And besides he’s so important, it can’t be true, he does so much good for the community.\n\nHomosexuality was once called a victimless crime.\n\nThat is not true. I would like to believe this kind of behavior is extinct, but that is not true either."
