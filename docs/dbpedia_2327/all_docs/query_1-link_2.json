On 6 August 1730, he succeeded to his father's baronetcy. On 10 April 1750 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Knapton, in the Queen's County, in the Peerage of Ireland, and he assumed his seat in the Irish House of Lords.[1]\n\nHe married Elizabeth Brownlow, daughter of William Brownlow. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, Thomas Vesey, who was made Viscount de Vesci in 1776. His daughter Elizabeth married Edmund Pery, 1st Viscount Pery, and another daughter Anne married Thomas Knox, 1st Viscount Northland.[1]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
