        "text": "(Ground floor, north west corridor)\n\nThroughout history women have made a diverse and invaluable contribution to Belfast, playing a significant role in shaping the city. Belfast City Council’s Women’s Steering Group commissioned the window after a notice of motion to council which was supported by all the political parties to celebrate, recognise and pay tribute to the outstanding contribution by the city’s women.\n\nThe council’s Women’s Steering Group worked with the women’s movement across the city and a local historian to develop the window which is an illustration of Belfast women mill workers, and signifies the struggles that women have faced throughout history, some of which still exist today.\n\nWorking conditions in the mills were horrendous, wages were low, hours were long, health poor and life expectancy low. Women outnumbered male workers but were paid much less, and employers often issued the women with fines for laughing, singing or even adjusting their hair to keep wages low.\n\nIn response to their poor treatment, the women formed the textile workers section of the Irish Transport Workers Union and united to organise the Belfast Linen Strike of 1911. The women mill workers showed solidarity and courage and that courage, strength and faith is an inspiration to the women of today. They believed, ‘if you have faith and courage in each other, you can win’. Women, both present and future will continue to play an important role in leading and shaping our city and changing lives for the better. Through celebrating their history and contribution to the city Belfast city council’s women’s steering group hopes this window will inspire and unite women to continue the work for equality for all and for the uplifting of women’s lives. The window was unveiled in the week of International Women’s Day 2016 by the Lord Mayor, Councillor Arder Carson on Thursday 3 March 2016 and was designed, manufactured and installed by Alpha Stained Glass.\n\n(Ground floor, north west corridor)\n\nThis window was installed as a tribute to the members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Reserve in recognition of their services to the people of Belfast since 1969. In the centre of the window is the RUC coat of arms. The coat of arms consists of a harp, crown and shamrocks. At the bottom there is an open scroll with an inscription in Latin. It reads as follows: “Probitas, Aequitas, Misericordia, Comitas, Virtus”. The English translation is honesty, impartiality, courtesy, compassion and courage. The window was unveiled by the Right Honourable Lord Mayor Councillor David Alderdice on 10 February 1999. The following year in April 2000, Her Majesty the Queen awarded the George Cross to the Royal Ulster Constabulary to honour the courage and dedication of the officers of the RUC and their families; who shared their hardships. This was at a special ceremony at Hillsborough Castle, County Down. In 2006 the window was removed to incorporate the George Cross and then reinstalled.\n\n(Ground floor, north west corridor)\n\nThis window was commissioned in tribute to the corps and regiments of the British Army who have served in the city of Belfast and the province since 1969. It has a border of blue flowers with an image of a drum on crossing bells in the top centre. The coat of arms is detailed with a red hand on a clear background and a red dragon on yellow background. There is also a large motif of a lion standing on a crown over crossed swords. Within the coat of arms there is a fish and a ship, a red hand, a female harp figure and a castle. The window was unveiled by the Right Honourable Lord Mayor Alderman Herbert Ditty on 30th April 1993. The window was created CWS Design in Lisburn in 1992.\n\n(Ground floor, north west corridor)\n\nThe window features a union flag and a green flag crossed over a wreath topped with a female figure and crown. It is surrounded by a green and red border. Underneath it reads, “In memory of all those who served in the Ulster Defence Regiment 1970 – 1992”. This window was first unveiled by the Right Honourable Lord Mayor Alderman Nigel Dodds on 29 May 1992. On the 6 October 2006, Her Majesty the Queen awarded the Royal Irish Regiment the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross in recognition of the bravery, sacrifice and service of the home service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment and their forebears, the Ulster Defence Regiment. The cross was added to the window and unveiled by the Right Honourable Lord Mayor Alderman Gavin Robinson on 2 June 2013. The window was created by CWS Design, Lisburn.\n\n(Ground floor, north east alcove)\n\nThe window comprises the North Irish Horse motto and a female harp figure topped with a crown. There is also the large sword of sacrifice with a small halo of stars. The first plaque reads, “To the memory of the officers, N.C.O.’s and the men of the North Irish Horse who lost their lives in the Second World War 1939-1945 and whose names are recorded on the tablets on either side of the window. This memorial is erected by the surviving members of the regiment.” The second plaque reads, “This window was unveiled by Major General David Dawney CB DSO and Honorary Colonel of the Regiment 28th October 1962”. The window was created by Caldermac. The artist is J. Calderwood.\n\n(Ground floor, north east corridor)\n\nThe window marks the contribution of those Belfast citizens to the anti-fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War from 1936 – 1939.About 320 Irish volunteers fought against Franco’s forces as members of the XV International Brigade. Of these, forty-eight were born in Belfast. Twelve died in Spain. The Spanish Civil War became for many an opportunity to stand against the growth of fascism. Men and women from all over the world answered the call to defend democracy and their working class counterparts.\n\nNorthern Ireland, already impacted by political and religious divisions, was deeply affected by these events and many local people took part in the Spanish aid campaign, including Belfast activists Alderman Harry Midgley, Betty Sinclair, Sam Haslett and Sadie Menzies.\n\nThey played a significant role at home, raising awareness to support the democratic cause abroad. The Spanish Civil War Window was unveiled by the Right Honourable Lord Mayor Councillor Arder Carson on the 24 November 2015. The window was designed, manufactured and installed by Alpha Glass with the agreement of all of the political parties on the council.\n\n(Ground floor, north east corridor)\n\nThe main inspiration for the work was the imagery from the story of the Cattle Raid of Cooley, together with the moral tale of fighting over riches were no-one ever wins. Queen Medbh of Connacht and her warriors attempted to steal the great bull, Donn Cuailnge, owned by the men of Ulster. Medbh wanted the bull to match the white bull of Connacht, Finnbennach, owned by her husband. The central figure is Cuchulain, shown at the ‘gap of the north,’ protecting the borders of Ulster against the onslaught by Medbh’s armies. The Connacht warriors were no match for Cuchulain, who was said to become divine when engaged in battle. The Irish text on the window roughly translates as “a blessing be upon all such as faithfully keep the rain in memory as it stands here and shall not add any other form to it” and was taken from the 12th century book of Leinster. The window was commissioned by Belfast City Council with financial assistance from the good relations programme of the Office of the First/Deputy First Minister. The window is the first in City Hall to have Irish text. It was unveiled by the Right Honourable Lord Mayor Councillor Niall ó Donnghaile in 2012.\n\n(Ground floor, north east corridor)\n\nThe artist of the window is John McLaughlin. In a statement he said, “I designed this window in 2007 to commemorate the Belfast Dockers’ Strike of 1907. The window shows a protestant worker and catholic worker linked arm in arm, a woman representing the workers for the cigarette factory and a member of the Royal Irish Constabulary reminding us of their solidarity with the strikers. They are united in one cause as they stride forward together to demand fair rights for workers. The resonance of their actions roars like thunder in the present political world of Northern Ireland and the absolute need for workers and everyone else to stand together is personified in the image of the great orator James Larkin seen in typical stance at the top of the window while his spirit guides the marchers.\n\nThe lower segment of the window depicts the Custom House which is Belfast’s ‘Speakers’ Corner’ where ‘Big Jim’ held many public meetings. On the steps I have placed a poster seen on the Falls Road at the time of the strike with the words ‘Not as Catholics and Protestants, not as republicans and unionists, but as Belfast workers standing together'\n\nBehind Larkin at the bottom of the picture we see a flurry of banners and flags of many colours which represent the different origins, beliefs and loyalties of the strikers. I first heard of Jim Larkin when my legs were so short that they dangled from the form at the breakfast table where my father taught us about the nobility of the trade union movement. He was a committed trade unionist and I dedicated this window to him.” Designed by John McLaughlin, the window was manufactured by Calderwood Glass Ltd and was unveiled Thursday 10 May 2007 by The Right Honourable Lord Mayor Pat McCarthy.\n\n(Ground floor, north east corridor)\n\nThis window illustrates the horrors of one of Ireland’s greatest disasters and its impact on the citizens of Belfast. The stained glass window was commissioned to commemorate the plight of all those citizens of Belfast who suffered and died as a result of famine and famine related diseases, such as typhus and cholera. The worst effected years were 1846, 1847 and 1848. Those who perished during the famine were laid to rest in mass common graves in the Shankill, Friar’s Bush, Clifton Street and Donegall Road graveyards.\n\nThe window features a woman in a graveyard, a starving father and daughter weeping over a boiling pot; and a woman and child toiling in a field searching for edible potatoes in the blight-ravaged crops. Also featured is Clifton House, used as the poor house for Belfast’s destitute. The bent figure of a woman by the gravestones was an only too familiar sight in a tragedy which affected everyone, irrespective of social status. The emigrant ship (depicted in the window) was a blessed escape at least for those who could afford the cost of a steerage passenger ticket for a voyage to the ‘new world’.\n\nThe plaque underneath reads, “this window was unveiled by the Right Honourable Lord Mayor Councillor David Alderdice on 23 March 1999”. The window was designed and made by Calderwood Stained Glass Ltd. It was commissioned by Belfast City Council with the support of the arts council of Northern Ireland through its national lottery fund.\n\n(Ground floor, north east corridor)\n\nThis window is dedicated to the memory of all the individuals and their effected families whose organs and tissue were removed and retained without the knowledge or consent of relatives and families following post-mortem examinations in former times. The outline of a mountain peak and converging pathways speak of hardship shared by those who mourn; while the leaves fall silently from the tree as tears. A red ribbon binds all together in passion and pain. The rising sun however signifies promises of a new dawn. Hope is symbolised by doves ascending and a butterfly spreading its wings in anticipation of flight. United in the light of remembrance, both candles and a multitude of stars preserve the memory of the many loved one commemorated by this window. The Pathways Memorial Window was unveiled by The Right Honourable Lord Mayor Councillor Tom Ekin on Tuesday 18 January 2005.The window was funded by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and was designed by Nora Gaston. The design was in collaboration with members of the relatives’ reference group and Karl Harron. It was manufactured by Glass Scene.\n\n(Ground floor, north east corridor)\n\nCentenary window is a celebration of the many successes and achievements witnessed by City Hall during the past 100 years. Included in the window are Titanic and the Harland and Wolff cranes, ‘The Beacon of Thanksgiving’ (more affectionately known as “Nula with the hula”), the ‘Salmon of Knowledge’ (better known as ‘The Big Fish’) and the Waterfront Hall. The aircraft industry is illustrated by the Skyvan and the first Vtol aircraft in the world, both created by Shorts. The splitting of the atom was achieved by Ernest Walton in 1932. Achievements in the fields of sport, music and literature are also represented and the City Hall mural is represented by the John Luke inspired landscape in which we see a Massey Ferguson tractor and an ‘Electric Hare’ invented by James McKee of OD Cars Ltd. The multicoloured tree reflects the many different traditions and cultures found within Belfast.\n\nDesigned by Ann Smyth, the window was fabricated and installed by CWS Design in collaboration of Karl Harron. The window was unveiled by The Right Honourable Lord Mayor Councillor Pat McCarthy on Tuesday 12 December 2006.\n\n(Leading from reception to Rotunda, first floor)\n\nThe grand staircase is lit by 21 beautiful stained glass windows original to the building from 1906. Seven large windows display the family crests of four individuals prominent in the history of Belfast, the city coat of arms and then portraits of the monarch at the time of unveiling, Edward VII and his wife Alexandria. Below each of these designs appears a tablet recording important municipal events from the granting of the original charter by King James I on 27th April 1613 to the redefining of Belfast as a county borough in 1899. Smaller panels radiate outwards from each of the panels with the names of those individuals who are listed on the original 1613 charter. The windows moving clockwise beginning on the far left display:\n\nWilliam Lewsley - The name is presented within a wreath.\n\nThe coat of arms of Henry Le Squire, Constable of the Castle of Belfast - A silver and green shield with the head of three swans with crowned blue medieval armour above.

John Vesey, first sovereign”.\n\nJohn Willoyhby - The name is presented within a wreath.\n\nCarey Hart - The name is presented within a wreath.\n\nThe coat of arms of Thomas Hibbotts, a burgess mentioned in the original charter - Three fleurs-de-lis piercing through the heads of gargoyles appear on a silver and green shield with blue medieval armour above.

The window depicts a medieval warrior and female figure in front of a stone monument headed with the Royal coat of arms. At the bottom is the Ulster flag between the flags of the allies from the First World War; Britain, France, USA and Ireland. In the centre is the following inscription, “their name liveth for evermore”. Underneath is the king’s message that reads, “Your prompt patriotic answer to the nation’s call to arms will never be forgotten. I shall continue to follow with interest the fortunes of your division. I pray that god may bless you in all your undertakings”. George I. The memorial window was unveiled by his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Field Marshall the Viscount French of YPRES. K.P., G.C.V.O., K.C.M.G. on the 26 July 1920, and was created by Ward and Partners, Belfast.\n\n(First floor)\n\nThese are perhaps the most famous stained glass windows in City Hall as these remarkably are the original windows though this room was almost completely destroyed in May 1941. The room suffered a direct hit by a Nazi bomb during the Blitz of Belfast. The windows had been fortunately removed previously at the then Lord Mayor’s request at the outbreak of war and stored in the basements of Mount Panther House, County Down. During restoration of the building in 1952 the windows were returned and reinstated to their rightful positions. They display the four provinces of Ireland: Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connacht; with the three British monarchs who visited Belfast up until City Hall’s construction in 1906 between each; King William III, Queen Victoria and King Edward VII."
