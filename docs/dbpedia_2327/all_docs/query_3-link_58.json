        "text": "The condition of lots can vary widely and the nature of the lots sold means that they are unlikely to be in a perfect condition. Lots are sold in the condition they are in at the time of sale.\n\nOverall good condition with scattered scratches and abrasions consistent with age and use. Presents with scattered areas of oxidation to the metal surfaces. Top presents with scattered surface scratches, as to be expected from normal use. Leather desk top with light scratches and wear to the leather. Gilt decoration to the leather top with light wear. Two drawers glide smoothly. Suede interior to drawers with wear, scratches, and pen marks, as to be expected from normal use. Two faux drawer handles, one of which is slightly loose. Presents well, ready for use and display.\n\nPrint Report"
