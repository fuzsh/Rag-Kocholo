So great was his love for his native place that he conferred upon it great and lasting benefits. His most distinguished service to the town was to obtain from King Henry VIII a charter of incorporation, decreeing that the inhabitants of Sutton Coldfield should choose a warden and society for the Government of the town, and the administration of the lands and profits of the manor and lordship for the benefit of the poor, absolutely and forever. This charter also decreed tha the inhabitants should have the free use of the Royal Park and chase in perpetuity, and that the title of the town should thenceforth and for ever be \"The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield\". Among his many benefactions, he enlarged and beautified the church and founded the Grammar School which bears his name. He built a Moot Hall and Market Place. Fifty-one stone houses for the poor and two stone bridges, paved the whole town. Repaired the fences of the park and stocked it with cattle.
