The Peerage Of Ireland vol 6 p33 (John Lodge, 1789)

John Vesey, D.D. was born at Colraine 10 March 1637; and, through various preferments in the church, was advanced to the united sees of Limerick, Ardfert, and Aghadoe 11 January 1672, whence he was translated to the archbishoprick of Tuam 18 March 1678, and was sworn of the privy council; but being obliged to fly into England, as many others did, to escape the confusions of K. Jamesâs reign, he found a safe retreat in London, till the revolution restored him to his bishoprick. In the years 1712 and 1714 he was three times one of the lords justices of the kingdom; but deceasing at his seat of Holymount, in the county of Mayo, 28 March 1716, was there buried, and having had a numerous issue, was succeeded by his eldest son

History of the University of Dublin pp391-2 (William Benjamin Sarsfield Taylor, 1845)

JOHN VESEY was born at Coleraine, in the county of Derry, March, 1637. He was first sent to Westminster School, from whence he was admitted to this University, where he took the degree of A.M., and in 1661, he was appointed chaplain to the House of Commons; in 1672, he commenced D.D. With other preferments he held the Archdeaconry of Armagh, in which his father succeeded him! when he was made Dean of Cork. He was appointed to this see in January, 1672, and translated to the Archbishopric of Tuam, in March 1678. He was forced to fly from Ireland during Tyrconnell's government. He went to London, where he served a lectureship of forty pounds per annum. He was afterwards, three different times, appointed one of the Lords Justices of Ireland; the last of these appointments being in 1714, conjointly with Robert Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare, and William King, Archbishop of Dublin. During this prelate's lifetime, his son Sir Thomas Vesey, Bart., was successively appointed Bishop of Killaloe and of Ossory. He died in March, 1716, and was interred at Holymount, his place of residence. He left a number of legacies for most laudably charitable purposes; and, long before his death, he gave twenty pounds to provide a new silver mace for this college.

The Archbishop wrote much, but we have only met with the following printed works by him :â

The Life of Primate Bramhall, &c. 1 vol. Dub. 1678.âA Sermon preached before the King (William III.) at Windsor, 1691.âAnother Sermon, of great merit, preached to a large congregation of exiled Irish Protestants in London, 1690.âA Sermon, equally powerful and appropriate, preached before the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and both Houses of Parliament, in Christ Church, Dublin, 1692.

The Rev JOHN VESEY, A.M., of this College, published a volume of excellent Sermons in Dublin, 1683.

Dictionary of National Biography vol 58 pp290-1 (Sidney Lee, 1899)

VESEY, JOHN (1638-1716), archbishop of Tuam, born at Coleraine on 10 March 1638, was the only son of Thomas Vesey sometime presbyterian minister, afterwards rector of Coleraine. His grandfather, William, a scion of the house of De Vescy in Cumberland, was the first of his family to settle in Ireland in the reign of Elizabeth. John was educated at Westminster school and Trinity College, Dublin, where he proceeded M.A. in 1667 and D.D. in 1672. He had already, it is said, (WARE, i. 516), before attaining canonical years, been ordained deacon and priest by John Lesly, bishop of Raphoe in the time of the Commonwealth. In 1661 he was appointed chaplain to the House of Commons in Ireland, and on 29 June presented to the rectories of Ighturmurrow and Shandrum in the diocese of Cloyne. Being also vicar of Rathgonil, alias Charleville, in the same diocese, he was instituted archdeacon of Armagh on 16 Oct. 1662; but he held the appointment only for a short time, being succeeded by his father on 9 May 1663 (COTTON Fasti, iii. 46). On 3 Feb 1667 he was created dean of Cork and treasurer of Cloyne, and from thence advanced to the joint bishoprics of Limerick, Ardfert, and Aghadoe on 11 Jan 1673; he was consecrated the following day in Christ Church, Dublin, by Michael Boyle, archbishop of Dublin, assisted by the archbishop of Armagh and the bishops of Killaloe and Ossory. On 18 March 1678 he was translated to the archbishopric of Tuam; but his retention of the âquarta pars episcopalis,â or fourth part of the tithes of most of the parishes in his diocese, in defiance of an arrangement begun by the Earl of Strafford but interrupted by the outbreak of the rebellion and confirmed by the act of settlement (WARE, Works, i. 619), drew forth a petition against it on the part of his clergy; he induced them, however, to withdraw it by promising to surrender the âquarta parsâ in exchange for the wardenship of Galway whenever it became vacant. This it shortly afterwards did, but though Vesey obtained a commendatory grant of the same, he avoided the fulfilment of his promise, and it was indeed not until Edward Synge [q.v.] became archbishop of Tuam in 1716 that the clergy reaped any benefit from Strafford's arrangement.

During the troublesome times that ensued in consequence of the innovations in church and state by Richard Talbot, duke of Tyrconnel [q.v.], Vesey suffered great hardships at the hands of the native Irish, who plundered his cattle, regarding certain improvements he continued to make to his palace, and especially a steeple he erected on his cathedral, âwherein he intended to place six bells at his own charge,â as sure signs of his affection to the cause of William of Orange (Short Sketch of the Methods, &c., p. 17). He was deprived of the wardenship of Galway; but it was only when deeming his life to be in peril that he abandoned his charge, being, with Bishop Richard Tenison [q.v.], the last to quit the province. He sought a retreat with his wife and twelve children in London, where he obtained a small lectureship worth 40l. a year. His name was included in the list of those proscribed by the parliament of James II; but, returning after the revolution to his diocese, he preached before the lord lieutenant and both houses of parliament in Christ Church, Dublin, on 16 Oct 1692; and six days later moved to present a vote of thanks to King William for the great care he had taken of Ireland in venturing his person for its reduction. He was included in the commission for the government of Ireland during the absence of the lord lieutenant in 1712 and 1714, but in the latter year was incapacitated from acting through sickness. He died on 28 March 1716 at his residence of Holymount, about nine miles from Tuam, a commodious and comfortable house built by himself, at that time, âone of the pleasantest places in Ireland,â surrounded by a park and garden in the laying out of which he had taken great delight. He was buried there, and John Wesley, visiting the place in 1755 (Journal, ii. 324-5), copied from a stone pillar in the garden the following touching inscription"

Linquenda tellus, et domus, et placens

Uxor, cum numerosa et speciosa prole,

Chara charÃ¦ matris sobole;

Neque harum quas colis arborum

Te prÃ¦ter invisam cupressum

Ulla brevem dominum sequetur.

Besides three single sermons, Vesey published âThe Life of John Bramhall, Archbishop and Primate of all Ireland;â prefixed to an edition of Bramhall's works, Dublin, 1678.

Dictionary Of Irish Biography

Vesey, John

by John Bergin

Vesey, John (1638â1716), Church of Ireland archbishop of Tuam, was born 10 March 1638 in Coleraine, the eldest son of the Rev. Thomas Vesey (see below). He was educated at Westminster School and was apparently ordained deacon and priest under the protectorate (and thus while under the canonical age) by John Leslie (qv), bishop of Raphoe. Either he or his father was the âMr Vesey, clerkâ who was appointed chaplain to the Irish house of commons in May 1661. He first appears in the records of TCD when awarded the degree of DD in 1672; but must have taken his MA there before 1664, in which year he was incorporated MA at Cambridge on the basis of his Dublin degree. He became rector of Ightermurragh and Shandrum in the diocese of Cloyne in 1661, and was archdeacon of Armagh, 1662â3, and dean of Cork from 1667. He enjoyed the patronage of the earl of Orrery (qv) from at least 1663, and was his chaplain by 1668.

He was appointed bishop of Limerick in 1673 and was translated to the see of Tuam in 1679, where he met controversy over the quarta pars archiepiscopalis, or quarter part of the tithes of the clergy of the diocese used to support the archbishop. The clergy petitioned the lord lieutenant and privy council in 1682 to have the quarta pars restored to them, but Vesey persuaded them to drop their claim. He promised that â provided the government would grant to him the wardenship of the collegiate church of St Nicholas in Galway (on the death of the aged occupant, Dr James Vaughan) â he would relinquish the quarta pars. Vaughan died in 1684 and Vesey was granted the office but managed to persuade the clergy that he should enjoy the quarta pars for the remainder of his life.

In 1688 the corporation of the church of St Nicholas surrendered its charter; a newly constituted catholic corporation elected its own warden, and a dispute with Vesey commenced. Vesey gained a hearing at the privy council, where he had an unfriendly encounter with the lord chancellor, Sir Alexander Fitton (qv), and got no satisfaction. The lord deputy, the earl of Tyrconnell (qv), took the view that the archbishop should be left to pursue his rights at common law. Vesey also found himself in disputes with the remodelled corporations of the towns of Tuam, Galway, and Athenry.

As the political climate in the reign of James II (qv) became more menacing for protestants, the archbishop fled with his family, probably late in 1688, to London. (He was no stranger to England, having spent the years 1683â6 there, returning to Ireland only at the summons of the lord lieutenant, the earl of Clarendon (qv).) He was in London at least from April 1689 to April 1690, being appointed âlecturerâ at St Mary Aldermary in Bow Lane in September 1689, and apparently supporting his family with the salary of Â£30 or Â£40 a year. He was a leading member of the community of Irish protestant exiles and was one of a committee chosen by them in October 1689 to represent their concerns to the English government. In December 1689 Vesey was said to have procured Â£5,000 for the exiled Irish clergy.

On his return to Ireland he found that the cathedral church and archbishop's house at Tuam had been destroyed. In 1695 he proposed legislation to raise funds for the rebuilding of the cathedral and house. A bill to move the see to Galway resulted, but this was eventually defeated in 1697, probably in part at least because of the opposition of the corporation of Galway, now restored to protestant control but still jealous of certain rights it possessed in the corporation of the church of St Nicholas.

In 1676 he published an edition of the works of John Bramhall (qv), which he prefaced with a biography. In contrast to his father's flirtation with presbyterianism, Vesey in the dedication â addressed to Archbishop Michael Boyle (qv) â scorned âthe non-conformity of this present ageâ as âthe most absurd of anyâ. Dissent, he asserted, by promoting divisions among protestants, served the interests of Roman catholics. Vesey also published several sermons. His intellectual interests extended beyond theology, for he joined the Dublin Philosophical Society after its revival in 1693.

Vesey was an active member of the house of lords, with tory sympathies. He was appointed to the Irish privy council in 1684, omitted in 1685, but reappointed in 1704. He was one of the lords justices of Ireland in 1712â13 and 1714â15, and was vice-chancellor of TCD in 1713â14.

He married first (1662) Rebecca Wilson, daughter of a Mr Wilson of Cork House, Co. Dublin, with whom he had a son and a daughter. His first wife died about 1665 and he married secondly Anne Muschamp, daughter of Agmondesham Muschamp and his wife Anne Denny. There were five sons and five daughters of the second marriage. When in the diocese of Tuam, Vesey resided in the archbishop's house and, after the war, built a house on his own estate at Hollymount, Co. Mayo. He also had a residence near Maryborough in Queen's Co., where he and his brother-in-law Denny Muschamp (qv) had simultaneously acquired property. He died 28 March 1716, and was buried at Hollymount.

Many of Vesey's descendants were clergymen of the Church of Ireland during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but none achieved the eminence of his eldest son, Sir Thomas Vesey (1673â1730), 1st baronet, bishop of Ossory, who sat with his father on the episcopal bench. Thomas, the only son of his father's first marriage, was born at Cork. He was educated at Eton, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1689, graduating BA in 1693. He was made a fellow of Oriel College (1695) and took his MA in 1697 and his DD at a date unknown. He married (1698) his cousin Mary (d. 1746), only surviving child and heir of Denny Muschamp, whose great property holdings thus passed to the Vesey family. Thomas was in 1698 created a baronet, and was ordained deacon in 1699 and priest in 1700.

He became archdeacon of Tuam on 25 June 1700 (the day after his ordination), and was rector of Clonenagh, in the diocese of Leighlin, 1703â13. He was chaplain to the second duke of Ormond (qv), during his second viceroyalty, 1711â13, and was created LLD honoris causa of TCD in 1712. He was made bishop of Killaloe in 1713 and translated to Ossory in 1714. In addition to ecclesiastical affairs, his interests extended to the management of the parliamentary borough of St Canice in Kilkenny and an iron-mining enterprise at Glanballyvalley in Co. Kilkenny. He died 6 August 1730 in Dublin. He was succeeded in his estates and baronetcy by his only son, John Denny Vesey, who was subsequently created Baron Knapton and was father of the 1st Viscount De Vesci. Sir Thomas also had two daughters, the younger of whom was Elizabeth Vesey (qv).

The archbishop's second son (and the eldest son of the second marriage), Agmondesham Vesey (1677â1739), politician, was returned to the Irish house of commons for Tuam in 1703, sitting for the borough in every parliament until his death (his brother William also represented the borough from 1715 to 1750). An active parliamentarian and a tory, he found himself in opposition after 1714. He was created LLD speciali gratia by TCD in 1709. He married first (1696) Charlotte Sarsfield, daughter and sole heir of William Sarsfield of Lucan, Co. Dublin (and natural granddaughter of Charles II). He claimed, on behalf of his wife, the Sarsfield estates which, on the death of William in 1675, had passed to his brother Patrick Sarsfield (qv) and, on the latter's attainder, were forfeit to the crown. He was eventually permitted to purchase them at a low valuation. He married secondly Jane, daughter of Captain Edward Pottinger, and widow of John Reynolds MP and of Sir Thomas Butler MP.

The eldest son of this second marriage was Agmondesham Vesey (1708â85), politician and architect. He entered TCD in 1726 (he did not take a BA, but was created LLD in 1741) and the Middle Temple in London in 1729. He was a member of the house of commons for Harristown, Co. Kildare, 1740â60, and Kinsale, 1765â83, accountant and controller general from 1734 to his death, and a member of the privy council from 1776 to his death. He was a distinguished amateur architect, who designed his own residence of Lucan House, Co. Dublin. He married his cousin Elizabeth Vesey.

Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquess of Ormonde, K.P. part 4 pp592-3 (1906)

1682, September 25. King's Weston.âWhen your Grace was the last summer at Charles Fort, you took notice of the ruined walls of the parish church of Rincorran there adjoining. And soon after I proposed in a petition to His Majesty the rebuilding thereof in a more convenient place, if the advowson might be conferred on me. Whereupon your Grace, being first consulted, was pleased to order Mr. Ellis to tell me that I should have your Grace's consent if the Bishop of Cork said nothing to oppose therein. At that time Mr. Vesey, the minister of Kinsale, who held this living also, (and that as well by presentation from the late Lord Bishop as from His Majesty, because the title was uncertain), he was for his health here absent in England; so as I could not consult him as I wished touching the King's right, in order to lay the same before the Bishop. But as soon as I got light into it I did; and his Lordship taking time to search and consider thereof, I now received his answer by the last post, and he gives me his free consent to proceed in my petition as your Grace by his letter will see. While I was in expectation of the Bishop's answer, I did at Sir Nicholas Armorer's motion, promise to Hignett, now chaplain of Charles Fort, that I would present him in case I did succeed. For Mr. Vesey, the incumbent, was thought to be a dying man. And so it happened that Mr. Vesey died almost a month past, and I am told that Mr. Meade (brother to Sir John Meade) was thereupon hastening to obtain Rincorran from my Lord Deputy, as well as another place called Taxanon held also by Mr. Vesey, Kinsale being given by the Bishop to one Mr. Lapp. But I would not move until I had the Bishop's answer and resolution in this matter, as your Grace had directed; and it coming now in favour of my suit (which I look upon as depending for a year), I hope Mr. Meade by stepping in will not disappoint Mr. Hignett, and, indeed the rebuilding of the church: for I shall be loath to meddle about a reversion after one that may be near twenty years younger than myself. If your Grace think fit to cause a stop to be put to Mr Meade's presentation, so far as concerns Rincorran, and to approve of my proceeding in the way I was for, I will then presume to present my petition to His Majesty, and to procure thereon a reference to your Grace; and I will attend till I receive direction by Mr Gascoigne herein.

ARCHDEACONS.

1655âThomas Vesey appears. He had this year Â£120 salary from the Commonwealth Government (Lodge MSS.), and on 7 July, 1656, he got Â£20 increase of salary on his petition that he had a large family, had been expelled from his parish and robbed in the beginning of the rebellion and had preached in Coleraine ever since (Comm. Papers, A/21, Orders for Money, P.R.O.).

He was R. Maghera and Ballyscullion 1629-34, and R. Camus 1634-61. He was probably obliged to take refuge in Coleraine during the rebellion, and as the parish was then vacant on account of Mr. Redshaw's death he seems to have remained there (Reid's Hist. Presby. Church I, 444). Adam, quoted by Reid (I 443, 244; see also II 154, 179) says âthe first who [in Coleraine] publicly entered into the Covenant, was the preacher in that town, Master Vesey;â he took the oath, but ânot ever joined himself to the Presbyteryâ ... âhe was highly prelatical in his heart and not sound in his principlesâ! At the Restoration he was coll. R. Coleraine in 1661. He became R. Killowen (Derry) on 9 Oct., 1662, resigning this Archdeaconry; but he held Killowen only one year. He was V. Dundalk 1665-9. His son John succeeded him as Archdeacon, but res. in 1663, when Thomas Vesey was again made Archdeacon. T. Vesey was the son of William V., a scion of the house of De Vesey in Cumberland and one of the first of the family to settle in Ireland, and ancestor of Viscount de Vesci (see Peerages). The D.N.B. in its biography of his son, Abp. John V., incorrectly describes his father as âSometime a Presbyterian Minister, afterwards Rector of Coleraine,â which suggests that he received Presbyterian Orders. He was sometime a Commonwealth Minister of Religion, but not a Presbyterian Minister. His son Theodore (Ent. T.C.D. April 30th 1658 aged 17; ob. 1682) was R. Kinsale 1669-82. See also Dundalk.

In March, 1668, âThe Archdeacon, Dr. Vesey, an aged grave man, Â£200,â appears in the List of Churchmen in Ireland S.P.I. 1666-9, p. 674.

The Peerage Of Ireland vol 6 p33 (John Lodge, 1789)

William Vesey, having the misfortune to kill a man in a duel, fled to Scotland, where he married a daughter of the family of Ker of Cesford, ancestor to the duke of Roxburgh; after which, in the reign of Q. Elizabeth, he settled in the North of Ireland, and was father of an only son, the Rev. Thomas Vesey; who, 29 December 1629, was collated to the rectories of Ballineskully and Magheragh, in the county of Derry, and in 1634 to the rectory of Camus super Morne in the said county; was minister of Colraine, and archdeacon of Armagh, and in 1655 had 120l. a year allowed him by the government.

Dictionary Of Irish Biography

Thomas Vesey (d. c.1669), clergyman, was born in Coleraine, the only son of William Vesey, originally of Newland in Cumberland, who came to Ireland (after an interval in Scotland) in the reign of Elizabeth. His mother, whose first name is unknown, was of a Scottish family called Ker of Cessford. He graduated BA from TCD in 1625 and was imposed on the college as a fellow by the lord deputy, Lord Falkland (qv), in controversial circumstances in 1627. He became rector of Maghera and of Ballyscullion in the diocese of Derry in 1629, and rector of Camus-juxta-Bann or Macosquin in 1634. He took refuge in Coleraine during the rebellion of 1641, and wrote an account of this period for his bishop, John Bramhall.

His religious affiliations during the interregnum were complex. He appears in 1644 among some members of the Church of Ireland who took the Solemn League and Covenant; he fell out with the presbytery, accusing it of introducing foreign jurisdiction, in 1645, but was reconciled in 1652. In 1654, however, he was a salaried minister under the Commonwealth. He was archdeacon of Armagh in 1655, and was one of an advisory committee of eight ministers summoned to Dublin in February 1660 to assist the convention. He was the leader of the successful, âprelaticalâ, faction within the committee against Patrick Adair (qv), who sought to have the Covenant ratified by the convention. Either he or his son John was the âMr Vesey, clerkâ who was appointed chaplain to the Irish house of commons in May 1661. He became rector of Coleraine in 1661, and was rector of Killowen in Derry, 1662â3, and vicar of Dundalk, 1665â9. He resigned as archdeacon of Armagh in 1662, to be succeeded by his son but, on his son's resignation in 1663, was reappointed.

His wife, whose first name is not known, was a daughter of the Rev. Gervase Walker and a sister of George Walker, a Yorkshire native who was a close associate of Bramhall, chancellor of the archdiocese of Armagh, and father of George Walker (qv), the defender of Derry. They had seven children, of whom the eldest surviving son was John Vesey.

The manuscript of Thomas Vesey senior's account of the rebellion of 1641 and its aftermath is in TCD Dublin, MS 866. The De Vesci papers, a very rich family archive, are now in the NLI. The SarsfieldâVesey papers in the NAI are another family collection, in which the legal proceedings over the Sarsfield estate feature largely and which are calendared in PRI rep. D.K. 56 (1931).
