        "text": "You may have noticed that a common aspect of the film industry is that they will bank on the fame of celebrities to sell their films. The amazement of watching moving pictures on a screen alone was enough to carry the industry forward in the 1890s and 1900s but it did not take long for film producers to discover the value of celebrities with strong and recognizable screen personas like Charlie Chaplin, Errol Flynn, etc. The earliest example of a famous recurring screen star is the French silent actor, filmmaker and comedian Max Linder.\n\nMax Linder was born as Gabriel Leuvielle in Cavernes, France in 1883, although even from a young age he was nicknamed “Max.” He was the son of wealthy vineyard owners but he broke away from the family business because the travelling theater troupes and circus performances that occasionally visited his town enthralled him so much that he developed a passion for performing and decided to pursue the stage professionally.\n\nIn 1899, Linder enrolled in the Conservatoire de Bordeaux, one of the leading drama schools in France, and he won accolades at that school for his performance skills in both comedy and tragedy, soon leading to his career as a dramatic stage actor, officially going by his famous stage name by 1905, although he slowly drifted from the stage to the screen when he joined the French film studio Pathé at the suggestion of film director Louis Gasnier, who would help shepherd Linder’s early film career, and Linder ended up appearing in bit parts in comedies, appearing in dozens of Pathé shorts by 1907, but his first larger film role came with The Young Man’s First Outing (1905) and his first leading role came with the fantasy film The Legend of Punching (1905).\n\nMax Linder’s rise to stardom commenced with the exit of Pathé slapstick star René Gréhan in 1907. Gréhan often portrayed a high-society top hat-wearing man-about-town. A role Max Linder would take over and popularize. The character “Max” made his first screen appearance in The Skater’s Debut (1907), a film that some people might mistake for a Charlie Chaplin clone if they didn’t know that it predated Chaplin. But it wasn’t until 1909, when Pathé’s other top comedy star André Deed left, when Linder really took off in popularity with films like A Young Lady Killer and The Cure for Cowardice. The film Max Linder’s Film Debut (1910), a fictitious autobiography of Linder’s early film career starring Charles Pathé as himself, is another highlight of this period. And by the end of 1910, Linder was an international star.\n\nIn 1911, Linder began writing and directing his own films, and by 1912 he became the sole writer, director and star of his films, which was a period in his career that brought him much critical and commercial acclaim thanks to films many consider to be among his best, especially the ones from 1912 to 1914.\n\nAfter Linder served in the French Army during World War I, his career began to gradually fade and he started to become overshadowed by bigger screen comedians. In 1916, Linder was offered a career in the United States by the American film studio Essanay in an attempt to replace Charlie Chaplin who had recently left Essanay. Linder accepted the offer, moved to the U.S. and even became friends with Chaplin, but none of Linder’s American films were big hits, and after the anxiety and depression that hit Linder after serving in the war, he wasn’t able to make films regularly anymore, even when he returned to France in 1917. Although his career had a brief revival with the financially successful The Little Café (1919), but it was not an international hit.\n\nLinder attempted a career in Hollywood again in 1921 with the American film Seven Years Bad Luck, which is now seen as one of his best films but at the time wasn’t a big hit, and his final attempt at a career in America, the swashbuckling satire The Three Must-Get-Theres (1922) loosely based on The Three Musketeers, was also a box office failure despite receiving praise from both Charlie Chaplin and swashbuckling action star Douglas Fairbanks. The failure was enough to convince Linder that he may no longer be funny, which did not help with his depression.\n\nHe made a few more critically praised films back in Europe, including the horror comedy Au Secours! (1924) directed by Abel Gance and The King of the Circus (1925) directed by Édouard-Émile Violet, but these would end up being his final films. Linder seriously suffered from mental health problems after the War, an event that clearly scarred him, and the severe depression and mental breakdowns culminated in an early death in 1925 when he and his wife were both found dead in what was either a suicide pact or a murder-suicide.\n\nThe man had a sad personal life, but Max Linder’s positive influence on cinema is clear when you look at the ways that the relationship between celebrities and films evolved in the era of Charlie Chaplin, who was a big fan of Linder and whose work clearly inspired Chaplin. Linder was a force in the world of film and comedy, although his career became overshadowed by other actors and comedians who had wider appeal, greater longevity, better luck and sharper savvy about navigating a medium that, to be fair, was still new, but Linder’s significance in film history is unquestionable regardless. If you are a fan of old school comedies like the films of Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Laurel and Hardy but you’ve never seen a Max Linder film, check him out and you may just discover a new favorite."
