        "text": "A film made on a bet is about a bet. I think the moral here is not to gamble unless the outcome is a funny haunted house spoof.\n\nMax Linder made a bet with Abel Gance that he could not make a movie in less than three days (Gance being known for such large epics including the famous Napoleon adaptation from 1927). Suffice to say Gance won the bet and this film is its result. The beauty in this is the plot to the short film also involves a bet with Max Linder (playing himself) and he again loses the challenge.\n\nSlapstick farce mixed with experimental ghostly gags abound including a honestly suspenseful conclusion. Linder acting in top notch form as his silent legend suggests and it is his tension that we feel. Sadly this is among one of his last films before his suicide the following year.\n\nOh my God. I watched this with the Titane soundtrack and I can’t imagine watching it any other way. This 20 minute film was made in 2 days because someone bet Abel Gance couldn’t do that. Well, the madlad actually did it. This film was legitimately INTENSE and possibly my new favourite short film EVER????? Gance’s filmmaking skills are just incredible. The close ups on the actors’ extremely animated faces were actually haunting at points. I wish wish wish Gance made a feature length horror film. Okay yes this film was comedic but I also found it terrifying????\n\nIf you’re reading this, please please please watch this film. It’s only 20 minutes long. My mind is blown. Abel Gance might…\n\nThis short film shows that Abel Gance is more than just his epics. He's one of the best, if not the very best, directors of the silent era. He's able to show amazing emotions on screen, make profound stories, and all while experimenting with the film medium. This film surprised me with how fun and exciting it was. Max Linder gives one of my new favorite performances of the silent era. It's genuinely scary at moments and a crazy fun time.\n\nAdded to Important Silent Films\n\nAnd Abel Gance Ranked\n\nIt is an immense disservice to any film lover that this isn't part of your memory already. This is my second viewing and I see a million more in the future, as a party favor or part of serious discourse, or anything. Practically every cinematic weapon that Abel Gance ever used is in this as far as I can tell, so quickly and to razor-sharp accuracy and power. Max is at dizzying heights here, it's as much a part of Gance as it is his movie, and is practically nothing without him. Make this movie a part of your life and the rest of your life."
