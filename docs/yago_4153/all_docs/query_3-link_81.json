        "meta_description": "Zoetrope Studios, R-1981. Original theatrical poster printed in full color, 22 x 14 in., matted and framed. When originally completed in 1927, Abel Gance's Napoleon ran 4 hours. It was edited down for general release, but the \"director's cut\" tantalized film buffs for decades. In the 1970s, film historian Kevin Brownlow reconstructed Gance's version as best he could and the film began circulating at festivals. Director Francis Ford Coppola then commissioned his father, composer Carmine Coppola (who had provided memorable scores to films such as The Godfather ) to create a score for a live orchestral performance with Gance's film. The first performances were in New York. This poster is from a short run in Boston, November 10-15, 1981, at the Metropolitan Center. Provenance : The Collection of Kevin Burns and Prometheus Entertainment. 20 x 28.5 in.",
