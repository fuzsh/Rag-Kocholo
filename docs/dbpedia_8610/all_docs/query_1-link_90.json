        "text": "Speedy and delicious\n\nAfter a long day, the last thing you want to do is spend hours in the kitchen. From simple pasta dishes and speedy stir-fries to quick salads and effortless soups, we’ve put together a collection of brilliant recipe ideas that are quick to make, guaranteed to hit the spot after a long day, and can all be on the table in 20 minutes or less.\n\nRead on to discover 32 of the easiest, speediest dinners ever.\n\nTeriyaki chicken\n\nA jar of shop-bought teriyaki sauce is the key to making this tasty dish in under 20 minutes. To serve two, cut 14oz (300g) chicken thigh fillets into 2.5cm (1in) pieces and coat lightly with corn flour. Set a frying pan with a little vegetable oil over a high heat, tip in the chicken pieces and cook for five minutes, turning once, until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in 6 tbsp teriyaki sauce and reduce the heat. Simmer until the sauce thickens. Serve scattered with sesame seeds and spring onions, with fluffy white rice and steamed greens on the side.\n\nLamb cutlets with feta and lemon\n\nRich lamb and salty feta make a winning combination that works brilliantly as the base of this speedy dinner. Simply cook lamb cutlets under the grill for around five minutes – you want them to be crisp on the outside, but still pink and juicy in the centre. Arrange on a platter and scatter with generous amounts of feta cheese, season with plenty of black pepper and serve with lemon wedges and warm flatbreads.\n\nBeef tagliata\n\nThis sensational dish looks like it belongs in a restaurant but is actually a cinch to pull together – perfect for a simple yet special Friday night supper. Sear rump steaks in a non-stick frying pan until done to your liking. While the steaks rest, season generous handfuls of rocket leaves with lemon juice, a trickle of extra virgin olive oil and plenty of black pepper. Arrange the leaves on serving plates, then slice your rested steaks into strips and place on top. Garnish with Parmesan shavings, drizzle with balsamic syrup and serve.\n\nAvocado toast\n\nEveryone loves avocado toast for brunch, and it's just as delicious for dinner. Roughly mash your avocados, adding any other extra ingredients you like – think chopped chillies, finely sliced spring onions and diced tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice. Spread over toasted English muffins and add a poached or fried egg to finish. You could also top your avo toast with crispy, grilled halloumi, shards of streaky bacon or ham, or ribbons of smoked salmon.\n\nCrispy tofu with ginger and garlic dressing\n\nFor a filling, tasty dinner that’s completely vegan, look no further. To make two portions of crispy tofu, cut around 12oz (360g) firm tofu into cubes and pat dry. Sprinkle with a little corn flour, tossing to coat. Set a frying pan with a drizzle of sesame oil over a medium-high heat and fry the tofu for four minutes on each side, until crispy. Add four finely sliced spring onions, a thinly sliced red chilli and the florets from a small head of broccoli. Cook for three to four minutes more. Meanwhile, mix 1 tbsp each of sesame oil and soy sauce, two finely chopped garlic cloves and a little freshly grated ginger. Serve the tofu layered over cooked rice or noodles, drizzled generously with the dressing.\n\nBaked fish with a herb crust\n\nTender salmon or cod fillets topped with a herby, cheesy crust makes for a lovely, light midweek meal. For four people, sit four slim fish fillets in a baking dish and season well. Mix 4oz (110g) breadcrumbs, a crushed garlic clove, 3 tbsp finely grated Parmesan, 4 tbsp finely chopped parsley and a little lemon zest. Press the breadcrumb mix onto the upper surface of the fish. Transfer to an oven preheated to 220°C/200°C fan/425°F/gas mark 7 and cook for 15 minutes, until the breadcrumbs are golden and the fish just cooked through. Serve with boiled potatoes or oven chips and a green salad.\n\nSticky soy salmon\n\nHeart-healthy salmon fillets glazed with sticky soy sauce and served with boiled potatoes and a green salad makes for a truly tasty, speedy meal. To make enough glaze for four salmon fillets, whisk together 4 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp runny honey and 1 tbsp sesame oil. Brush the fish with the glaze, season generously and cook under a hot grill for five to eight minutes (depending on the size of the fillets), until the fish is just cooked though and the glaze sizzling.\n\nSticky soy and sesame chicken\n\nThis classic Taiwanese dish is brilliant for a quick and speedy meal. To make enough to serve two, put two diced chicken breasts in a bowl and dust lightly with salt, pepper and corn flour. Set a wok or frying pan with a little vegetable oil over a high heat, add a small handful of thinly sliced ginger and a couple of crushed garlic cloves and fry until crispy. Toss in a sliced red chilli, followed by the chicken pieces. Pour in a splash of rice wine and cook for two to three minutes, then add 3 tbsp each of toasted sesame oil and light soy sauce and 1 tsp sugar. Cook for five minutes, until the sauce has reduced and the chicken is cooked through. Scatter with Thai basil leaves to serve.\n\nChar siu pork stir-fry\n\nChar siu pork recipes usually call for slow-roasted pork, but this stir-fry can be ready in less than 20 minutes. To serve two, combine around 9oz (250g) thinly sliced pork fillet with 1 tsp each of soy sauce, hoisin sauce and runny honey and a pinch of white pepper. Once the pork is coated with the sauce, dust lightly with corn flour and set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 tbsp water, 1 tbsp light soy sauce, 1 tsp hoisin sauce and 1 tsp miso paste.\n\nChar siu pork stir-fry\n\nHeat a frying pan or wok until smoking hot. Add a drizzle of rapeseed oil, followed by two crushed garlic cloves. Tip the pork into the pan, leave for 10 seconds to sear, then flip over. Add a drizzle of rice wine, toss together for another 10 seconds or so, then stir in the leaves from a head of pak choy, a handful of broccoli florets, a thinly sliced red or yellow pepper and a splash of water. Toss together for three to four minutes, then pour in the sauce and toss again. Serve immediately.\n\nCacio e pepe\n\nA lesson in delicious simplicity, to make cacio e pepe for two, cook 7oz (200g) spaghetti or linguine until al dente, draining well and reserving the pasta cooking water. Return the pan to the heat with a generous knob of butter. Once melted, sprinkle in 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper. Cook for a minute or so, until fragrant, then pour in a ladleful of pasta cooking water and bring to the boil. Tip the pasta back into the pan, along with a large handful of finely grated Parmesan. Stir well, then add a little more grated Parmesan, tossing the pasta until you’re left with a smooth, silky sauce. Serve immediately.\n\nIndonesian fried rice\n\nThis tasty dish is inspired by traditional nasi goreng (Indonesian fried rice) and is perfect for using up leftover roast chicken. To serve four, cook 14oz (400g) brown basmati rice according to packet instructions. Add four beaten eggs to a hot, non-stick frying pan, rolling the eggs around the pan to coat thinly. Cook for a minute or so on each side, then roll up into an omelette and slice. Next, finely slice an onion and put half in a blender with three garlic cloves, a chopped red chilli, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp brown sugar and 1 tbsp tomato purée. Blend well to a paste.\n\nIndonesian fried rice\n\nSet a frying pan with a little vegetable oil over a high heat. Add the remaining onion and fry for two to three minutes, until softened. Add around 9oz (250g) leftover roast chicken and the onion and chilli paste. Cook for a couple of minutes, then add the cooked rice and fry for three to four minutes more, until heated through. Stir in a couple of chopped spring onions and a handful of chopped coriander. Divide among serving bowls and top with the sliced omelette, scattering over a few salted peanuts and extra sliced spring onions to finish.\n\nSteak with garlic butter\n\nFor a meal that’s as deliciously decadent as it is easy, cook your favourite cut of steak until done to your liking. Allow to rest, then top the steak with a generous knob of garlic and herb butter and flash under the grill briefly (use shop-bought garlic butter or make your own by beating crushed garlic and finely chopped parsley into softened butter). Serve with shop-bought oven fries or potato wedges.\n\nPad Thai carbonara\n\nA sensational hybrid dish, the classic combination of eggs, bacon and spaghetti is made even more delicious thanks to the addition of Thai-influenced ingredients. To serve four, whisk together 2.5 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp liquid soy bean paste, 1.5 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce and 1.5 tsp fish sauce. Set a wok or frying pan over a high heat, add three chopped rashers of thick-cut bacon and cook for six to seven minutes, until slightly crispy. Add four crushed garlic cloves and a sprinkling of chilli powder and cook for a minute more.\n\nPad Thai carbonara\n\nIncrease the heat to high, add the sauce you made earlier, and cook for a minute or so, until reduced. Add the florets from a small head of broccoli and 2fl oz (60ml) chicken stock and cook for four minutes, until just tender. Tip around 8oz (225g) cooked spaghetti into the pan along with 2fl oz (60ml) more sauce. Cook for three to five minutes, tossing frequently, until the sauce is heated through. Remove the pan from the heat, add two beaten eggs and toss together until creamy. Serve garnished with chopped spring onions.\n\nSpinach orecchiette\n\nPesto pasta is a classic quick-dinner go-to, but why not give this old favourite an update? To make a single portion of spinach pesto pasta, cook your favourite pasta until al dente (we like orecchiette), drain, and reserve a little of the cooking water. Defrost three blocks of frozen spinach in a dry frying pan set over a medium heat. Once almost fully defrosted, add a glug of olive oil and two sliced garlic cloves. Fry for a few minutes, then add a drizzle of single cream and simmer for a minute or so more. Stir your cooked pasta into the sauce, adding a splash of the reserved cooking water. Scatter with grated Parmesan to serve.\n\nPrawn and cabbage fried rice\n\nTo jazz up yesterday's leftover rice, set a wok or frying pan with a little vegetable oil over a medium heat. Crack in an egg or two; once the egg is half cooked, break the yolks and cut into the whites with a spatula. Push the egg to one side of the pan, increase the heat and add your cooked rice, mixing well to prevent clumps from forming. Add defrosted frozen peas and thinly sliced cabbage and season with soy sauce and sesame oil – you could add any additional ingredients you have to hand here: shredded chicken, crispy tofu, carrot ribbons. Once everything is heated through, divide among bowls and serve.\n\nMiso ramen\n\nThis incredibly tasty, easy riff on ramen makes a star of instant noodles and can be ready in just 10 minutes. For a hearty bowl for one, cook miso ramen noodles according to packet instructions, adding a handful of frozen peas (or any other vegetables you have lurking in the fridge or freezer) to the pan. Meanwhile, poach, boil or fry an egg until done to your liking. Pour the noodles and cooking broth into a bowl and garnish with sliced chilli, spring onions, diced tofu and sesame seeds. Add your egg and tuck in.\n\nEgg and lettuce salad\n\nA seemingly simple salad, it’s the peanut dressing that makes this dish really sing. To serve four, whisk together 1 tbsp groundnut oil, 2 tbsp peanut butter (smooth or crunchy, it’s up to you), 1 tbsp fish sauce and a good squeeze of lime juice. Tear the leaves from a head of butterhead lettuce into pieces and place on platter. Soft boil six eggs; once cool, peel and slice and add to the platter. Drizzle over the dressing, turning to coat.\n\nPasta with pancetta and peas\n\nA hit with both adults and children, we like making this dish with farfalle (bow-shaped pasta), but feel free to use whatever you have to hand. To serve four, gently heat 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil and 2 tbsp butter in a frying pan. Increase the heat to medium, add a finely chopped onion and four rashers of finely chopped pancetta or bacon. Cook for three to four minutes, then add four large handfuls of frozen peas, around 6fl oz (175ml) hot vegetable stock and a handful of grated Parmesan. Cover with a lid and cook for four minutes more. Stir your cooked pasta into the sauce, mixing well. Serve finished with extra Parmesan.\n\nSatay noodle stir-fry\n\nFull of crunch and freshness, this stir-fry makes for the most delicious one-pan vegan meal. To make enough for four, whisk together 1 tbsp each of soy sauce and rice vinegar, then add 2 tbsp sesame oil, 5 tbsp peanut butter and 2 tbsp water. Set a wok with a drizzle of sunflower oil over a medium heat. Add two thinly sliced garlic cloves and around 11oz (320g) Tenderstem broccoli and sugar snap peas. Cook for two to three minutes, then add 11oz (320g) straight-to-wok udon noodles. After a minute, pour in the sauce, stir well to coat and cook for a minute or so more, until the sauce thickens slightly.\n\nGrilled cheese and chutney sandwich\n\nNothing says comfort food like a gooey melted cheese sandwich and this one is extra special. To make four sandwiches, fry a finely chopped green pepper and half a finely chopped red onion in a little butter until softened. Tip into a bowl and add around 3oz (100g) mild Cheddar and 6oz (200g) torn mozzarella and a pinch of chilli powder. Butter four slices of thick bread, then pile the cheese mix on top. Top each with another slice of bread to make four sandwiches. Set a frying pan with a little butter over a medium heat and cook the sandwiches, in batches if necessary, for two to three minutes on each side, until the bread is toasted and the filling melted.\n\nOne-pan chicken Parmesan\n\nA speedy twist on an Italian classic, this is a midweek saviour if there ever was one. For enough chicken Parmesan for four, set a frying pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat. Add around 17oz (480g) mini chicken breast fillets and cook for three to four minutes, until browned all over and cooked through. Add a scant sprinkling of dried oregano and thyme, then pour 10fl oz (300ml) passata into the pan and season. Stir in 12oz (350g) courgetti spaghetti (courgetti) and warm through. Combine 3oz (100g) each of grated mozzarella, grated Parmesan and panko breadcrumbs. Scatter over the top of the chicken and grill for four to five minutes, until golden and bubbling.\n\nCorn fritters\n\nBrilliant for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner, corn fritters make a tasty, filling meal out of a tin of corn. To serve two, combine a finely chopped onion, 6 tbsp self-raising flour, a sprinkling of cayenne pepper or chilli powder and 11oz (300g) drained, tinned sweetcorn. Season and stir to combine. Add two eggs and 2 tbsp milk, mixing well to form a rough batter. Set a frying with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat. Add tablespoons of the batter to the pan and cook for three to four minutes on each side, until golden. Serve with the toppings of your choice – think mashed avocado and crispy bacon, poached eggs and smoked salmon, sour cream and spring onions.\n\nPasta with leeks, chilli and prawns\n\nIf you always have a bag of prawns in the freezer, this speedy meal can be on the table in just a few minutes. Sauté sliced leeks in butter until softened, then add tomatoes, garlic, defrosted frozen prawns and a pinch of chilli. Throw in cooked pasta – you can even use a shop-bought fresh pouch – and dinner is ready.\n\nCrab spaghetti\n\nFor a taste of luxury, make crab spaghetti. To serve four, fry a chopped red chilli and a couple of crushed garlic cloves in olive oil until softened. Stir in around 3oz (80g) brown crab meat and 11fl oz (300ml) fish stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for five to 10 minutes, until thickened. Cook 14oz (400g) spaghetti according to packet instructions, reserving a little of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the sauce, tossing well to combine. If it seems too thick, add a little of the reserved water. Season with salt, pepper and lemon zest. Divide among bowls and finish with a little white crab meat.\n\nChunky fish soup\n\nA simple riff on classic bouillabaisse, this 15-minute wonder will transport you to the French Riviera on a weeknight. For two people, cook a finely chopped onion in a little olive oil until softened (around five minutes), then add a sprinkling of saffron, a crushed garlic clove and two bay leaves. Cook for a minute or so, then stir in an 8oz (227g) can of chopped tomatoes and 18fl oz (500ml) fish stock. Bring to the boil and add 7oz (200g) mixed seafood (calamari, mussels, prawns) and a diced and skinned cod fillet. Simmer for five to 10 minutes, until the prawns have turned pink and the seafood is just cooked through. Divide among bowls and garnish with chopped parsley to serve.\n\nCheat's dan dan noodles\n\nThis dish packs a truly epic flavour punch and can be on the table in less time than it would take to order a takeaway. To serve four, set a large frying pan with a little vegetable oil over a medium heat. Squeeze the meat from six pork sausages out of their skins into the pan. Sprinkle with a touch of five-spice powder and cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, make the dan dan sauce: whisk together 2 tbsp each of tahini, dark soy sauce, chill oil and hot water. Add two 10oz (300g) packs of straight-to-wok udon noodles to the pan, followed by the sauce and the leaves from a head of pak choi. Mix really well and stir-fry for a minute more before serving.\n\nGreen baked eggs with asparagus\n\nThis twist on traditional shakshuka is brimming with flavour, texture, colour and goodness. To serve two, fry 14oz (400g) trimmed asparagus in a pan until lightly charred (around three minutes). Remove the asparagus from the pan, reduce the heat and add a bunch of roughly chopped spring onions, two crushed garlic cloves and a scattering of cumin seeds. Cook for a minute or so, then add half a shredded spring cabbage and cook for three minutes more. Stir in a squeeze of lemon juice, a handful of crumbled feta and the asparagus. Reduce the heat to low and crack in four eggs. Cover with a lid and cook for five to seven minutes, until the whites are set but the yolks still soft. Serve scattered with more feta.\n\nClassic salade Niçoise\n\nJust the thing for a summer’s evening, this Niçoise salad is fresh, flavourful and entirely satisfying. All you need to do is slice boiled potatoes into quarters and place in a bowl. Add blanched green beans, sliced boiled eggs, Kalamata olives, halved ripe tomatoes, sliced radishes and cucumber and drained, tinned tuna. Add torn baby gem lettuce leaves, drizzle with a honey-mustard salad dressing and toss together gently to combine.\n\nMarmite mac 'n' cheese\n\nOne for when if feels like there’s no food at home and you need a comforting and satisfying dish. To make enough to feed one, tip around 3oz (75g) macaroni into a mug and cover with 8fl oz (250ml) water. Cover with cling film and pierce the surface several times. Stand the mug in a bowl or jug and cook on for full power in the microwave for two minutes. Stir well, leave to stand for a minute, then repeat this process twice more, until the pasta is cooked. Add butter, Marmite and strong Cheddar to taste, cook for one minute more, stir well and serve.\n\nBaked fish parcel\n\nBaked fish with veg is a firm favourite for healthy dinners. The parchment cooking technique – known in Italian as al cartoccio or en papillote in French – encourages the fish to steam and retain lots of moisture. To make, sit firm fish fillets (think cod, salmon or halibut) on individual squares of parchment paper. Top with your choice of flavourings – sliced fennel and lemon works well, as does tomatoes, capers and black olives. Drizzle with olive oil, season and wrap up to make a parcel. Bake at 200°C/180°C fan/400°F/gas mark 6 for 12-15 minutes, or until the fish is just cooked through.\n\nMasala omelette\n\nThis quick and easy meal is wonderfully tasty and truly satisfying. To feed two, beat four eggs together with two chopped green chillies, two chopped spring onions and a finely chopped large tomato. Add a handful of chopped coriander and season with plenty of black pepper. Heat a little butter in a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Add half the egg mixture and cook for one to two minutes, before gently turning over to cook through. Remove from the pan and repeat with the rest of the mixture. Place the folded omelettes in between slices of buttered white bread, adding tomato ketchup (if you like).\n\nMushroom chow mein\n\nThis speedy stir-fry takes full advantage of short-cut ingredients to make a truly tasty dinner. To serve two, set a wok with a drizzle of rapeseed oil over a high heat. Fry two finely sliced garlic cloves and a chopped red chilli until fragrant, then add five large handfuls of oyster mushrooms, the leaves from a head of pak choy and a dash of rice wine. Stir in 3 tbsp Sichuan sauce (or more to taste) and bring to the boil. Add around 110z (300g) ready-to-wok noodles, toss together until the noodles are coated with the sauce and cooked through, then serve."
