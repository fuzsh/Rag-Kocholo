Using the example of mosques in Amman (Jordan), traditional ornaments are considered from the point of view of their purpose, content and symbolism, location and plastic organization. The compositional techniques, stylization methods, images used in ornaments are analyzed. In the modern architecture of mosques, continuity in approaches to decoration is combined with the active use of modern technologies in the construction and interpretation of ornaments, their embodiment in the material. Since there are strong changes in the space-planning solutions of mosques in connection with modern functional tasks, it is ornaments that are the most important means of identifying religious buildings. New interpretations of the visual language and the purpose of the decoration of mosques are due to the processes of globalization and the use of computer technologies for the design of structures. The authors conclude that it is necessary to follow the canons of Islamic ornamental motifs when using them in modern architecture, especially in religious buildings. By offering engineering and artistic innovations, architects must preserve the structure, plasticity and symbolism of ornaments in which the philosophy of Islam accumulates.\n\nKeywords: symbolism, islimi, girih, geometric ornament, Islamic ornament, mosques of Amman, architecture of mosques, Islamic architecture, symbolism of ornament, traditions\n\nReferences:\n\nAbdel-Gawad, & Tawfiq Ahmed.

The subject of the work is an showpiece of the permanent collection of the Art of China section of the State Museum of Oriental Art, designated as \"A Head with a three-legged toad\". The purpose of this article is to consider the problems of attribution of this museum object and propose ways to solve them for subsequent re-attribution based on new information obtained during the study. The author examines the connection of the \"Head ...\" with mass culture, analyzes the data of the State Museum of the East on the alleged real prototypes of sculpture, as well as the legitimacy of the assumptions put forward. Special attention is paid to the importance of the museum's constant study of primary sources – stored objects, updating information about them through new research and technologies. The work on the research was carried out within the framework of an interdisciplinary approach, using such methods as historical-typological, historical-genetic, comparative analysis, as well as the method of interpreting a work of art. In the course of the analysis, the author provides information on the basis of which the correctness of the statements in the official information channels of the State Museum of the East regarding the showpiece \"Head with a three-legged toad\" is questioned. The dating of the object to the Han period is questioned, since the life years of the personalities indicated as possible prototypes of the \"Head...\" – Hou-xian, Liu Har and Guo Xiang – belong to a later time. It is noted that the intended purpose of the \"Head ...\" – the replacement of the real one in the burial of a decapitated person – turns out to be a rather late practice and does not correlate with the dating of the creation of the showpiece. A hypothesis is put forward about the possible non-Chinese origin of the tradition of this type of images. The collected data can become the basis for the re-attribution of the showpiece, a more thorough study of it and filling in the \"white spots\" in its biography. The identification of a more accurate and definite dating and the region of origin of this museum object will positively affect the comprehensive knowledge about it, expand information about the funerary culture and mythological tradition of China.\n\nKeywords: taoism, Guo Xiang, Liu Har, Hou-xian, China, head with toad, showpiece, attribution, The State Museum of Oriental Art, burials\n\nReferences:\n\nFaibisovich, V.

The purpose of this study is to clarify the importance of the historical influence of ancient fashion on modern Hanfu costume and its perception by the youth of the country. The object of the study is social relations. An empirical survey using the example of young residents of Chengdu showed that fans of the \"Hanfu culture\" make up the absolute majority, and these are mainly women of a wide age range and Han youth with a higher cultural level with a good education. The author proves that the main goals of the Hanfu youth movement are: inheritance, dissemination and popularization of Hanfu culture; development and innovation of Hanfu culture. Based on the conducted surveys and tests, the author concludes that the rise of the youth \"Hanfu culture\" is mainly due to the following reasons: the awakening of national identity, inspired by the ongoing development of globalization; the increase in national consciousness caused by the emphasis on historical consciousness in domestic policy towards ethnic minorities. The following methods and methodology were used in the research process: Analysis of historical sources: historical documents, images, artifacts and literature; Questionnaires: among various population groups; Personal survey; Comparative analysis. The methodology included a comprehensive approach to the study of the historical context and its impact on modern fashion. The presented article explores the historical influence of ancient fashion on modern street fashion, taking into account questionnaires, personal survey and analysis of historical time periods and forms of Chinese Hanfu costume. The main conclusions of the study are to identify the significant influence of ancient fashion on modern street fashion trends, as well as to understand the importance of preserving historical heritage in modern fashion. A special contribution of the author to the research of the topic is an integrated approach to the analysis of historical data and opinions of various groups of society, which allowed us to get a more complete picture of the influence of ancient fashion on modern culture. The novelty of the research lies in the use of a combination of questionnaire methods, personal survey and analysis of historical forms to study this topic, which allowed us to obtain unique results and a deep understanding of the evolution of fashion.\n\nKeywords: questionnaire, research, innovation, Chengdu, historical costume, youth subculture, Hanfu movement, Hanfu Culture, dynasty, clothing\n\nReferences:\n\nZhang, Jiao.

The author examines in detail such aspects of the topic as ethnocultural markers of the ethnos, traditions and cooking technologies, observance of the ancestral features of the national cuisine, recipes existing in the territory of the region and its individual parts. The author partially presents the developed theoretical materials concerning the issues of Buryat cuisine and thematic interviewing materials collected as part of expedition trips to the territory of the Aginsky district of the Aginsky Buryat district of the Trans-Baikal Territory, including the technology and recipe for cooking traditional Buryat dishes. The author lists the forms of events (festivals and holidays) that exist in the region, popularizing the traditional cuisine and culture of the Buryat population of the Trans-Baikal Territory. The main method of research was the analysis of thematic literature and materials, interviewing speakers of traditional culture within the framework of expedition trips. As the main conclusions, the author cites expediency, rationality, geographical and climatic features, conditions and place of residence of ethnic communities as main factors of shaping the local cuisine. And today, thanks to scientific and technological progress, ethnic identity, including in traditional cuisine, is gradually decreasing or disappearing completely. Therefore, the issue of fixing and transferring ethnic culture, including traditions, customs, etc., to future generations in order to preserve their ethno-cultural identity, is acute. Many people do not realize how important and existential this can be for some people who live and think through the prism of their ethnicity.\n\nKeywords: holiday, Transbaikalia, Buryats, recipe, popularization, conservation, festival, ethnic and cultural identity, traditional cuisine, ethnic group\n\nReferences:\n\nAltaeva, A.E., (2018).

The subject of this work is a variety of tools for translating sources through the use of interpretation through vocal arrangements. The purpose of this study is to find performance techniques for comprehending the folklore of the Kuban Cossack song, illustrative popularization of the real listener through a new reading of the original source. In identifying the substantial foundations of song performance, special attention is focused on the music collections of folklorists V. G. Zakharchenko (born 1938), A. D. Bigdai (1855-1909), G. M. Kontsevich (1863-1937), who made a significant contribution to the foundations of the Kuban Cossack folk singing art. Along with this, the analysis of a wide range of vocal arrangements in the practice of professional and amateur vocalists provides a postulation about the ambiguity of interpolation in the formation of an original reading of folklore documents. The theoretical justification of this study is based on the tactics of analyzing endemic folklore singing concepts in the context of the art history dynamics of modern research. The methodological core of the work identifies the elements of preserving traditional performance through the vocally processed embodiment of Kuban Cossack folk songs. The author's direction has been developed in the complex of the constituent elements of the arranging performance, based on the personality of the vocalist, containing an individual interpretation of the performing plurality. The performing techniques of folklore Cossack sources has been formed. Exceptional accents are identified in the analysis of musical folklore sources (selectively) to establish new technical characteristics of performance. The scientific novelty of the research lies in the genesis of Cossack culture for the author's constructive orientation of ways to preserve and transform musical material to a modern listener. The characteristics of the song material according to the genre-performing component, expressed by the system of mechanisms of performance by vocal-performing solutions, are revealed. The derived orientation of the translation mechanisms opens up new facets of the performance of Kuban Cossack folk songs for the preservation of traditions with multifaceted options for the transformation of folklore documents for subsequent generations.\n\nKeywords: traditions, vocal heritage, transformation methods, broadcast, Singer, Cossack, source transformation, performing arts, Song, Folk\n\nReferences:\n\nSabrekova, S.

The article examines the history of the formation and present condition of the network of literary museums in the capital in the context of the historical and cultural process. The chronological framework covers the period from the 19th century until now. This is due to the moment of the appearance in Moscow of the first proto-museum forms of literary museums, the first museums of this profile, as well as the formation and development of their network. Significant historical and cultural prerequisites for the emergence of museums of this profile are identified. The main periods in the history of the formation and development of the network of literary museums are considered in the context of the periodization of the history of museum affairs and the historical process in the country. Museums that also have characteristics of another profile, such as historical and literary, literary and artistic, and literary and local history, are also considered. The total number of literary museums in Moscow has been identified, including state, municipal, departmental, public, private and school. Museum-type institutions representing and popularizing literary heritage are shown. Museums of other profiles (music, art, local history and others) are indicated, the funds and exhibitions of which contain literary monuments and collections of rare books. A special place is occupied by book museums, which are not literary museums, but are close to them in that their collections also contain monuments of literature (including fiction). The total number of literary museums in the capital and their percentage in the museum network have been calculated.\n\nKeywords: museum statistics, Moscow, museums of books, museum-type institutions, private literary museums, school literary museums, literary museums, proto-museum forms, museum network, network of literary museums\n\nReferences:\n\nBelinsky, V.G.

The aim was to study the Russian tradition of perception of the principle of religious tolerance and to build a theoretical model of religious tolerance, reflecting both historical experience and ideas. The work uses ethical, culturological and logical-methodological approaches. The first two allow us to consider religious tolerance as an ethical principle and as one of the important components of a person's spiritual life. The latter contributes to the disclosure of the principle of religious tolerance in its entirety. The scientific novelty consists in the fact that an ethical and cultural approach to the study of the principle of religious tolerance is proposed; the Russian tradition of perception of religious tolerance is revealed, a theoretical model of religious tolerance is built; a logical and methodological analysis of religious tolerance as an ethical principle is carried out, which allowed to reveal its structure and interrelated elements; the dynamics of the appeal of domestic authors to the topic of religious tolerance is demonstrated on the materials of the National Corpus of Russian language. The results of the study coincide with the scientific novelty. The relevance of the study is due to the possibility of its use in the development of the national idea of Russia. The practical significance lies in the possibility of applying the results in the field of education and socio-humanities, in legislative, as well as internal and foreign policy activities of Russia.\n\nKeywords: Russian philosophers, the essence of religious tolerance, the main elements of religious tolerance, religions, humanism, the model of religious tolerance, ethical and cultural approach, Corpus of the Russian language, Russian tradition, the principle of religious tolerance\n\nReferences:\n\nAverina, S.

Interesting considerations are given regarding the Russian cosmism of the philosopher A.P. Ogurtsov. The author problematizes the statements of Semenova, who distances herself from the views of cosmists and shares these views. He sees a similar ambivalent attitude in the polemic of I. Kant with the great scientist and esotericist of the XVIII century Emanuel Swedenborg. An analysis of the esoteric Christian teaching and the personality of the latter shows that Swedenborg simultaneously accepted two realities of spirit and nature, removing contradictions, bringing them into line with each other; at the same time, his psyche changed under the influence of work confirming the new picture of the world he had built. The author suggests that, like Swedenborg, cosmists and Semenova built a reality in which their dreams, intentions and actions received a place and meaning. He believes that in order to properly understand this type of creativity, a turn is needed to the problems and aspirations of the individual, to the built reality in which these problems are resolved (albeit in virtual terms for now), to the historical tradition of thinking. In his opinion, cosmists, Semenova and some modern ideologists like A. Dugin or Yu. Gromyko continue to move in line with the Russian tradition, outlined by Chaadaev, Dostoevsky and Russian religious philosophers. Another tradition characteristic of the creativity of these thinkers is esoteric, which allows you to create realities, omitting the problems of realization, following one ‒ constructing the world for your own personality.\n\nKeywords: spirit, nature, tradition, realization, mind, reality, esotericism, utopia, cosmism, conscience\n\nReferences:\n\nGromyko, Yu.V.

The possible ways of solving the problems of creating an image of the garden of its heyday - the end of the XVIII century - the first quarter of the XIX century are presented and analyzed. The arguments justifying design decisions when choosing planting material are demonstrated. The authors focus their attention on this aspect, as one of the numerous markers of the representation of local historical phenomena - in this case, the development of a certain park object. The scientific novelty of the work is connected with the identification of all factors and combinations of planning elements of the estate, which determined the achievement of that aesthetic expressiveness, which determines the status of the object as a cultural heritage and national treasure. We believe that when carrying out new restoration work, it is necessary to raise the question of restoring \"flower beds\" in historical outlines. In modern conditions, when the scale of the Ostankino park has changed, its functional purpose has changed, it would be wrong to suggest restoring \"flowerbeds\", while using tree and shrub vegetation. Six \"klomps\" are formed in accordance with and on the basis of these iconographic materials. The proposed floral assortment is similar to the solutions of the front yard – herbaceous peony (Latin Paeónia), hosta (Latin Hósta), lily (Latin Lílium) and spring flowering ephemeroids.\n\nKeywords: ensemble, manor, pantheon of arts, planting material, method of analogies, parterre, theater, restoration, plans, monument\n\nReferences:\n\nSemenova-Prozorovskaya, E.

Balmont through the prism of the culture of Islam. The topic of the culture of Islam in the poet's work has been little studied, which is the relevance of this study. Islam is a traditional religion and the cultural and spiritual life of a Muslim is inextricably linked with Islam. All literature, architecture, science, philosophy of Muslims is based on the teachings of Islam and its holy book the Koran. K.D. Balmont became interested in Arabic and translations of the Koran, melodic Arabic script. Subsequently, his essays, poems and travel notes will be filled with religious and cultural images. The methodology of the work is based on synchronic, structural and functional, biographical, historical and cultural methods. The novelty of the article lies in a new look at the work of K.D. Balmont within the framework of the culture of Islam. In the course of our work, we examined Balmont's religious poems of 12 suras: \"I swear\", \"Merciful\", \"Great News\", \"Blow\", \"Oh, Prophet\", \"Rich People\", \"Trumpet sound\", \"Then\", \"Smoke\", \"Al-Hotama\", \"Event\", \"Don't forget.\" There were also many translations from Arabic, travel notes, essays, and the epistolary legacy of Balmont. The poet traveled a lot and visited Muslim countries, made translations from Arabic, wrote essays and travel notes about the culture of Islam.\n\nAs a result, the main conclusions of the study were formulated, the culture of Islam was shown, the religious poems of K.D. Balmont were studied, and further prospects for studying this problem were outlined.\n\nKeywords: tajvida, Masjid al-Haram, mosque, the holy city of Mecca, Muhammad, Koran, symbolist poet, Balmont's epistolary legacy, culture of Islam, Balmont\n\nReferences:\n\nBartold, V.

The article analyzes the approach of the Government of the People's Republic of China to the definition of the essence of the national intangible cultural heritage on the materials of legal documents, considers the classification developed in accordance with national, historical, cultural characteristics for the typologization of intangible cultural heritage objects. To improve the protection of intangible cultural heritage, the State Council of the People's Republic of China provides for a four-level hierarchy of monuments of the National Heritage: national, provincial, city and county, which contributes to more thorough and effective work with them. Particular attention is paid to the consideration of concepts that allowed China to fully integrate the protection of intangible cultural heritage into the modern political course of the state. The novelty and relevance lies in the study of the fundamental principles that guide the State Council of the People's Republic of China in its work on the study of intangible cultural heritage objects, the creation of their nomenclature base, the promotion of digital transformation in meeting the needs of the public in understanding the importance and uniqueness of cultural heritage. An important contribution is the analysis of approaches to ensuring the transfer of spiritual culture, the creation of favorable conditions for the support of \"representative heirs\" of China's spiritual culture.\n\nThe main conclusion of the study is that as a result of the measures taken in China, progress has been made not only in the protection of intangible cultural heritage, but also in strengthening cultural awareness, spreading knowledge about the objects of the ICH, the development of traditional crafts, the study and popularization of traditional spiritual culture.\n\nKeywords: representative heir, protection of the Cultural Heritage, UNESCO, cultural heritage, cultural objects, state cultural policy, cultural values, classification, non-material cultural heritage, China\n\nReferences:\n\nВ Пекине открыт первый в стране Музей нематериального культурного наследия [The country's first Museum of Intangible Cultural Heritage opens in Beijing] (2022).

One of the districts of the North is Kargopolye, whose architectural traditions date back to the high carpentry culture of Ancient Novgorod. Local buildings are an example of traditional wooden construction, a treasure trove of knowledge about the customs, culture and history of the Russian people. In the wooden monuments of Kargopolya, not only the accumulated experience of Russian masters is visible, but also the very spirit of the splendor of northern wooden architecture. The subject of the study is the architectural and structural features and the traditional interior of the Tretyakov house–yard (currently part of the exposition of the Museum of Wooden Architecture \"Small Korely\") as an example of a peasant Kurnaya hut in Kargopol. The article is based on the materials of expeditionary research by A. B. Permilovskaya (1984, 2006) – settlements and monuments of folk architecture of the Kargopolsky district of the Arkhangelsk region with the implementation of photofixation and schematic measurements; analysis of archival documents, interviews with residents of the Kargopolsky district. The scientific novelty of the research consists in the introduction into scientific circulation of new archival sources and field materials on the traditional culture of the Russian North. As a result, an analysis of the architectural and design features of chicken huts was carried out, the value of the furnace \"in black\" for Kargopol was revealed. M. A. Tretyakov's house-complex is of interest, because it contains a kind of \"architectural code\" for understanding the features of the construction of Kurnaya huts. The results of the study show that M. A. Tretyakov's house-yard is a monument of wooden architecture that has preserved the original design solutions, the layout of the premises. The Kurnaya hut has preserved the archaic device of the furnace \"in black\", the household items associated with it, as well as the original interior. Thanks to this, the modern exposition of the house reflects the real life of the Kargopol mid XIX century peasant life.\n\nKeywords: peasant house with a chimneyless stove, house-yard, interior, cultural heritage, cultural landscape, folk architecture, Russian North, Kargopolye, wooden architecture, architectural monument\n\nReferences:\n\nAlferova G.V.

The author partially agrees with the interpretation of the poem proposed by Minkin, objects to Kozarovetsky, but mainly interprets \"Eugene Onegin\" on the basis of his concept of art and the methodology proposed by him for analyzing works of art. The views on the poem of Minkin and Kozarovetsky are compared: the first believes that the poem describes the moral evolution of the personality of Alexander Sergeevich, and the second that we have a brilliant hoax started by Pushkin to shock readers. The author offers his own reading of Pushkin's poem, in which much is based on the analysis of artistic reality. He shows that the narration in \"Eugene Onegin\" is conducted from four persons (Pushkin himself, Onegin, Tatiana and the rest of the characters), and the narrators convey their ideas and contents to each other. Although formally Onegin says very little, Pushkin speaks for him a lot and intelligently; although Pushkin is not Onegin, but Onegin's fate threatens Pushkin as well. The narrator in the poem \"Eugene Onegin\" resembles Proteus: sometimes he speaks for himself, following his character and nature, then on behalf of other narrators, hiding behind their looks and speeches. The reader needs to understand this poetic masquerade: to separate the author from the heroes, to understand where the author is, and where he is the hero and narrator, where the heroes speak for themselves, and where on behalf of Pushkin? Having built such an artistic reality, forcing the reader to work, solving the author's constructions, reflecting on his life, Pushkin acted as a real innovator of art.\n\nKeywords: controversy, composition, reconstruction, understanding, artistic reality, narrator, reader, hero, author, content\n\nReferences:\n\nVladimir Kozarovetsky: how Pushkin played a joke on Minkin-3 (2022). https://vkozarov.livejournal.com/10010.html\n\nVladimir Kozarovetsky: how Pushkin played a joke on Minkin ‒ (2022). 4https://vkozarov.livejournal.com/10303.html\n\nGordin, Ya.

Pursuant of M. Bakhtin, who believes that humanistic approach gives preference to the subject of aesthetic relations, the author suggests his interpretation of the nature of art. The author qualifies the position of M. Bakhtin as \"artistic Platonism\" ‒ art should dictate and inspire life; art is the true life, according to Plato, imitates the objects and events of ordinary life. The position of M. Tsvetaeva suggest “art for the sake of art”. The position of M. Shalev on the one hand – as an independent reality, on the other – comprehension and perception of the problems the artis and the audience are concerned with in artistic form. The author highlights the four main types of art: \"authentic\" oriented towards culture and man, \"postmodern\" deconstructing the reality of life and art, \"traditional\" focused on different attitudes (imitation, expression, representation of the sublime and beautiful, building a different life, etc.). and \"applied\". Based on interpretation of the attitude of art towards life, the following dilemma is formulated. On the one hand, the artist creates in the space of freedom, and thus would not take on responsibility for life (the position of M. Bakhtin); on the other hand, since art affects people and ordinary life, the artist is mindful of possible responsibility. The author believes that all artists solve this dilemma in their own unique way, which makes it virtually impossible to formulate recipes and rules.\n\nKeywords: work, reality, deconstruction, concept, understanding, viewer, artist, art, form, language\n\nReferences:\n\nTsvetaeva M.

It has become the translator of not only the Japanese mentality and traditional values to the West, but also demonstrates the changes taking place in Japan. The analysis of artistic image of the anime heroine Atsuko Chiba (Paprika) is the goal of this research. Noticeable changes in the status of women in Japanese society are observed only since the middle of the XX century, which immediately found reflection in Japanese cinematography. The use of empirical and comparative methods allow establishing that the changes taking place in Japanese traditional society changes retain the national peculiarities. The anime film “Paprika” directed by Satoshi Kon, which is based on the eponymous novel by Yasutaka Tsutsui, reflects the transformation of the role of women in modern society. The novelty of this work lies the fact that this article analyzes the virtually unstudied topic of the artistic imagery in anime and the structure of modern female image therein. The images of Atsuko Chiba and Paprika, translated from the novel to anime, indicate the changes that took place in the Japanese society in the late XX – early XXI century, and namely the female image that gives a better perspective and sense of such changes. Despite the Western influence upon the traditional Japanese society and transition of the country into the new level of development, did not hinder the preservation of national peculiarities that are based on the century-old traditions and Japanese mentality.\n\nKeywords: gender roles, female image, anime, animation, Japanese cinema, Japanese culture, Japan, Yasutaka Tsutsui, Satoshi Kon, Paprika\n\nReferences:\n\nTarnapol'skaya G.

The subject of this research is the traditional dwelling as a factor of formation and transformation of the cultural landscape of Onezhskoye Pomorye. The goal lies in studying the peculiarities of formation and transformation of cultural landscape of the rural settlements Onezhskoye Pomorye based on the material of traditional dwelling. The research relies on the empirical data acquired in the course of expedition of the Scientific Center for Traditional Culture and Museum Practices of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences to Onezhsky District of Arkhangelsk Region (2018–2021);archival sources of A.V. Shchusev State Museum of Architecture (Moscow), experience of exploring the monuments of wooden architecture of the open-air museum “Malye Korely” (Arkhangelsk Region). The data were obtained by photofixation of the architectural monuments, schematic measurements, and ethnographic survey conducted among local residents using the method of interview. The research employs the original methodology developed by the Doctor of Culturology A. B. Permilovskaya on the architectural-ethnographic exploration of the sites of wooden architecture. Cultural landscape of Onezhskoye Pomorye (and the Russian North overall) primarily is the landscape of rural historical settlements. Northern settlements emerged in close connection with the natural landscape and transformed it into a cultural one. Special role in this process was played by the local population – the Pomors, who were guided by the principles of creating compact settlements, with closed type of dwelling to due to the harsh climate. The adaptive capabilities of traditional dwelling, reflected in its architectural design, allowed the people to survive in the severe conditions of the North. The dwelling is a reflection of natural space of the Russian North and the Arctic, passed through the “prism” of local mentality and carpenter's culture, coexistence of man and the surrounding natural environment, special marker of the North Russian identity, and intrinsic part of the North Russian cultural landscape.\n\nKeywords: Russian North, vernacular architecture, tradational dwelling, rural historical settlement, cultural landscape, Onezhskoye Pomorye, Arctic, Vorzogory, Maloshuyka, Purnema\n\nReferences:\n\nUsov A.A.

Unfortunately, after the overthrow of the monarchical structure in 1911, this game gradually ceased to be played. The “Promoting Officials” can be referred to as the game of chance, and its rules remind of the modern game “Monopoly”. Two or more players take turns to roll the dice, which decide whether to move forward or step back. The winner is the one who first reaches the center, position tai shi – mentor of the emperor, grand preceptor. The relevance of this work is substantiated by the absence of research on this cultural phenomenon within the Russian science. The study is based mostly on authentic materials in the Chinese language. The author highlights the connection of the game with the historical era, social structure, hierarchy of state service, education and upbringing of youth, the Confucian doctrine prevalent in the Chinese society. The main conclusions consists in recognition that the board game “Shengguan Tu” played an important role in strengthening the cult of education among youth and regards to the government bureaucratic apparatus. This game also resembles the folk wisdom of the Chinese people.\n\nKeywords: Promoting Officials, Chinese bureaucracy, Shengguantu, Ancient China, game culture, social culture, Chinese culture, game, board games, gambling\n\nReferences:\n\n张磊. 升官图游戏中国最早“桌游” 玩法似飞行棋(图) // 中国中央电视台 – 中国网络电视台 : [sayt]. – 2012. – 09月15日. – URL: http://news.cntv.cn/society/20120915/101966.shtml (data obrashcheniya: 07.04.2021).\n\n姚程珠,秦菊英,周尧. 升官图游戏对当代游戏设计的参考价值 // 设计. – 2016年. – 21期. – 120-121页.\n\n肖磊冰. 古人过年怎么玩 // 八小时以外 (Sparetime). – 2014年. – 2期. – 32-33页.\n\n徐珂. 賭博類: 擲陞官圖 / 徐珂. – Tekst: elektronnyy // 清稗&\n\nReference:\n\nRozin V.M..

This literary work features the four major themes: love of the protagonist Michael, creation of the new world from its inception, the characteristic of life values of a person, and discussion of the peculiarities of reality that Meir Shalev builds as an artist. In the first theme, the author reveals several images of love, reflecting on the mystical love of the protagonist for the young woman Ana, love in the family and marriage, love for children. At the same time, the author discusses not only the way that Meir Shalev understands and describes love in “Fontanelle”, but also talks about the own interpretation of love. In the plotline of the second theme, the author also distinguishes two lines: the story the protagonist’s grandfather Apupa, who carries his beloved Amuma on his shoulders across the country, seeking a place where they could create a home and family; and the story of gradual development of a small settlement into a city, created by Apupa and Amuma on the mountain, and several Jewish families at the lower valley. Discussing in the third topic the anchors of human life, the author emphasizes such values as effort, love, family and family line, creativity, indicating that Michael is not alone, he is loved, he gets involved in family history, as well as the history of Israel and Jewish culture, drawing strength in the heroes of this story.

The author reviews such relatively new for Russia phenomena as military-historical clubs, ethnic parks, thematic tourism zones, private museums and ethnographic collections, which familiarize with the history of our homeland in an interactive form. The active engagement of visitors and members of the club into the process of reconstruction of lifestyle and military traditions of previous generations is like being a participant of the restored history, which is more comprehensible than the textbook or exhibited artifacts, and thus arouses more emotional response and forms a respectful and patriotic attitude towards the native country. It is established that ethnic parks, thematic tourism zones, private museums, houses of ethnography, created by the efforts of enthusiasts do not often become the object of scientific interest, at times receiving contempt from the professional scientific community. However, the practice demonstrates that historical reconstruction draws more citizen’ attention than the traditional museum. Such situation requires examination and defines its novelty. The result of research consists in the creation of value-oriented classification of historical reconstruction organizations, as well as in assumption that from the visitor’s or participant’s perspective the leading role in historical reconstruction is not so much the accuracy (with a certain degree of fiction), but the creation of a holistic image of living history, filled with the value meaning of the bygone era.\n\nKeywords: artistic image, interactivity, private museum, thematic tourism, ethnographic park, preservation of heritage, historical reconstruction, culture, esthetics, culture philosophy\n\nReferences:\n\nKlub voenno-istoricheskoy rekonstruktsii «Leyb-gvardii Preobrazhenskiy polk. 1812 g.» [Elektronnyy resurs] // OKVIR «Petrovskaya brigada». 2003 g.

The subject of this article is the stages of creation and functionality of the sites of war memorial heritage in time and in space. The object of this research is the war memorial heritage. The author highlights and analyzes six key stages of creation and functionality of the sites of war memorial heritage: motivational-explanatory (grounds for memorialization); procedural-memorial (procedure for perpetuation of the memory); maintenance-protective (repair, restoration, improvement; prevention of unlawful actions (inaction) with regards to the sites of war memorial heritage); mobilization (relocation of a war memorial site); destructive (demolition, damage); constructive-restorative (reconstruction of a site). The scientific novelty consists in comprehension of the key stages of creation and functionality of the sites of war memorial heritage, which is of scientific, theoretical and practical interest for the development of effective cultural strategies in the future. The conclusion is made that the period of creation and functionality of the war memorial sites is characterized by the presence of six key stages. The tangible component of a site can be subjected to destructive processes, including demolition. However, sustainability of the symbolic component allows subsequent regeneration of tangible mediums of the monuments, which is confirmed by constructive-restorative activity. The author underlines the antagonism of the tangible and symbolic components of war memorial heritage, in the context of which tangible is constantly subject to modernization, while symbolic should remain unchanged.\n\nKeywords: protection of historical truth, commemoration, cultural policy, historical memory, space, time, military memorial heritage, images of the past, place of memory, sacral place\n\nReferences:\n\nBergson, A.

The landscapes under review are being protected by the government as the objects of Moscow cultural heritage, and designated as museums (reserve museums) and public parks. The subject of this research is disclosure of the essence of these methods and their assessment from the perspective of alignment with historical primary sources, implementation, proliferation, and attractiveness. The author conducts systematization of methods in accordance to the degree of conformance to the historical realities, and divides them into the following groups: 1) that provide accurate reproduction of historical forms, 2) that create similarities, 3) that create new forms. Each group is divided into subgroups. By frequency of application, the leading place belongs to the methods of first group, which are aimed at reproduction of the shapes of buildings and structures. The rest two methods focus on reviving the memory of the past. The application is attributed to new construction, which can be assessed as landscape evolution and a modern artistic phenomenon. The methods of second group lead to landscape development in spirit of historicism, while the methods of third group – to the development of territory based on modern vision of the past. The conducted analysis is valued for the general outlook upon the process of preservation of one of the most complex types of cultural heritage of Moscow.\n\nKeywords: pastiche, reestablishment, preservation, restoration, giving a historical appearance, post-Soviet Moscow, landscapes of historical estates, the persistence of memory, development of the historical landscape, systematization of methods\n\nReferences:\n\nChernyavskaya E.N.

The subject of this research is the basic essential parameters of military-memorial heritage within the framework of humanistic knowledge. The object of this research is the military-memorial heritage as a phenomenon of national culture. The authors explore the key structural forms of existence, species diversity, social functions and specific attributes of the military-memorial heritage; leaning on that conduct structural-functional analysis and determine essential parameters of the “military memorial heritage” as a cultural phenomenon. In the course of this work, the authors apply the interdisciplinary method of research due to the fact that military-memorial heritage attracts attention of the scholars of humanities (culturology, sociology, political science, history, philosophy, and others), as well as deductive method that suggests narrative logic from the general to the specific. In the context of this study, the “general” implies such phenomena as historical memory, heritage, and cultural policy, while the “specific” implies the derivative sociocultural phenomena (military-memorial culture, military memorial heritage, etc.). The scientific novelty lies in the attempt to determine the essential parameters of the phenomenon of military-memorial heritage. The conclusion is made that possessing the particular characteristics, military-memorial heritage requires conceptualization and profound scientific cognition. The key positions of the research were implemented in terms of grant programs of the President of the Russian Federation for government support of the leading young Russian scholars – Doctors of Sciences (MD-2020 Contest), and the project “Culture of Memory of Industrial Cities of the Russian Province: Memorial Strategies of Regional Identity”.\n\nKeywords: monument, defender of Fatherland, military burial place, cultural phenomenon, essential parameters, state cultural policy, military memorial culture, military memorial heritage, memorial complex, search movement\n\nReferences:\n\nErll A.

This article examines and analyzes the Chinese folk tales, ethnocultural representations on the world, values, relationships, and assessment of surrounding environment contained thereof. The understanding of traditional concepts and images allows to better understand mentality of the nation, their priorities and ideologies. The parallel is drawn with the Russian tales and stereotypes. The author determines the universal ethical messages typical for the people of any culture, as well as specific features characteristic to Chinese people. The differences and similarities in perception of various images, actions and conclusions are considered on the examples of Chinese and Russian cultures. A popular idea of “two brothers” in narration of the tales is presented. On the example of several tales, the author analyzes this traditional model and describes its peculiarities, as well as behavioral models that are typical to China. Behavioral analysis can be valuable in in-depth review of Chinese culture, namely folk culture, as well as in strengthening of cross-cultural ties and improving efficiency of studying Chinese language through understanding the national stereotypes and linguistic worldview.\n\nKeywords: linguistic world image, people’s way of thinking, culture of China, fairy tales model, folk art, analysis, Chinese folk tales, cultural exchange, Chinese language, values\n\nReferences:\n\nUporov A.V.

N. Tolstoy for pedagogical project “Azbuka” (an alphabet book) from authentic epic songs of the Russian people, as well as trace the influence of Tolstoy’s interpretation upon the reception of epos in the Russian educates society of the late XIX century. Substituting the epic Niola with the titanic “working man” Mikula, Tolstoy corrects the original concept of the epic poem by counterpoising Svyatogor and Mikula Selyanovich, reflecting the social class conflict of aristocracy and the commoners. The poetic tale of Lev Tolsytoy “Volga and Mikula” presents his ideal of the peaceful worker, who does not resist the evil of the provider, and whose work and meekness hold the society together. This ideal advances the previously unfamiliar to Russian epic consciousness values: sacralization of agricultural work, avoidance of military life and governance of the state, as well as exclusive value of peasant origin.

The concepts and processes that cursory are perceived as traditional, but modernistic in their essence, are referred to pseudo-traditional. The authors understand pseudo-traditionalism as a result of stylistic mimicry based on the partial digestion of separate elements of the traditional semiotic system borrowed extra-contextually and uncoupled from other elements, with which they are in a state of structural-systemic relations within the framework of real tradition. The article is carried out in the context of semiotic-hermeneutic approach towards analysis of the phenomena of modern culture. The sources include the literary text of clearly traditional orientation, as well as materials collected in the course of sociological interview. The authors prove that the opposition city – village carries mythological character, equally to demonization of city and idealization of village in pseudo-traditionalistic discourses. The article also analyzes various aspects and modi of the modern mythological image of a village, including religious (eschatological). The author examines the impact of historical and social contexts upon the formation of ancient mythology.\n\nKeywords: provincialism, archaic,, modernism, city, myth, pseudotraditiona, tradition, village, religion, semiotic\n\nReferences:\n\nBerdinskikh, V.A.
