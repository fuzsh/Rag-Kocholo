        "text": "The article discusses a wide range of aspects concerning the Holomodor – the Great Famine in the Soviet Union in the years 1932–1933. The author focuses on examining the processes of creating a collective image of the Great Famine and the role of individual memory of its survivors in building this image. Analyzing the memories of the survivors the author deals with distortions and myths which has grown up around the Holomodor. The significance of this disaster for the Ukrainian identity is also the subject of the analysis.\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to present an analysis on how the “red famine” (Applebaum 2018) that occurred in Soviet Ukraine between 1932 and 1933 is discussed in Russia and Ukraine. Both countries, rewriting history after the collapse of the Soviet Union, have not yet reached an agreement on what took place during those years. Ukraine was not the only country struck by the famine. Other areas of the Soviet Union, especially in Russia and in Kazakhstan, were hit by the tragic event. Many people starved to death and many others struggled to stay alive. Even though Ukrainian and Russian accounts of the event can often be surprisingly similar, some discrepancies on the interpretation of the cause of the famine, can nevertheless lead discussions into completely different territories and kickstart fiery debates. In Russia the famine is simply remembered as “голод” which means “famine”, while Ukraine has coined a more specific term which includes the nature and the cause of the famine. “Holodomor” which means “to kill people by starvation”. Furthermore, many Ukrainians claim that Holodomor is “геноцид” (genocide), a fully planned act of mass murder on ethnic Ukrainians. Most Russian and Ukrainian experts agree that the famine was man-made, but they are still divided on whether it was caused intentionally, or as a result of a chain of unfortunate events caused by Stalin’s failed collectivization and his total disregard for human life."
