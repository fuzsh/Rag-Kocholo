In a press conference held on Thursday, July 13 in the British capital, Eric Morley gave details of what would be the fiftieth edition of the contest. The Millennium Dome was chosen as the venue for Miss World to be held on November 30. The Dome is a large domed building that was originally used to host the Millennium Experience, a major exhibition celebrating the beginning of the third millennium. It is the eighth largest building in the world by usable volume and is located on the Greenwich Peninsula in southeast London and had a cost of 1.14 billion dollars. Reigning Miss World Yukta Mookhey from India added glamor to the press conference where Eric Morley announced the event. The Maldives islands, with their beautiful beaches, would host the swimwear segment and 104 contestants from around the globe were expected to participate in the event. Morley also announced that the American comedian Jerry Springer would be the official presenter of the contest.\n\nFor her part, Yukta Mookhey spoke about her childhood fascination with beauty pageants, which she regarded as fairy tales, and the subsequent realization that they were about more than just beauty. She further said that the contests provided an ideal platform for young women who wanted to develop their potential. “At the bottom of the heart, the idea attracts, although we are in a new millennium, we are moving towards a very fast era, where everything is based on computers and the Internet, but somewhere along the line there is the idea of ​​someone beautiful or someone who can make you smile, or someone you just want to keep watching on TV. And it’s a concept that’s been going on for 50 years, we’re now celebrating 50 years, and I guess that’s why it’s growing in popularity”, said Mookhey. If the current Miss World sought to inspire talented young women to cultivate inner beauty, Julia Morley, for her part, focused on the virtue of charity. She listed the welfare projects that her organization had funded. One of them was in Hyderabad (India), where the police took care of street children. Eric Morley perhaps did not want the audience to conclude that Miss World was just a charitable institution and repeatedly emphasized that it was a commercial organization. “When I go back to, for example, 1952, the number of girls in Miss World was only 12, and it has grown and continued forward, now today practically all countries want to participate, except strict Muslim countries, obviously, but apart from that, we try to do it so that all countries can attend, in the filming on the beach we tell the girls that they can wear sarongs, but in the old days you couldn’t do that”, said Eric Morley, in what would be his last press conference.\n\nINDIA’S ZEE TV SPONSORS MISS WORLD 2000.-\n\nIndia’s Zee TV secured the worldwide television rights to the contest, contributing to the global broadcast to bring an additional 1 billion viewers to the event. This was a major blow to Sony that was behind the Indian film awards ceremony, which had also been held at the Dome. Zee’s strength was such that two of India’s main channels, Sony and B4U, had forged a marketing alliance in the UK, despite being staunch rivals in India. Sainath Iyer, president of Zee TV, said its participation in this event reflected its “commitment to content development and the creation and coverage of live events.” He said his country’s recent successes at Miss World had generated unprecedented interest among Asians across the globe. “It is natural for Zee, as one of the major broadcasters, to be closely involved with Miss World for its 50th anniversary celebration and the next two years,” he said. Zee TV would work in close collaboration with ARY, a jewelery and gold company that was an official sponsor of the event and would display the exclusive Miss World 2000 50th anniversary jewelery collection designed by ARY to mark the occasion and would also contribute to children’s charities. Design of the collection would be held in a competition, according to Salman Iqbal, managing director of ARY. The winner of the award would be selected by an international jury. ARY also minted or a special souvenir in gold, to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Miss World.\n\nNATIONAL COMPETITIONS.-\n\nThe Miss World organization to date had 108 directors, of which, initially, 104 had ensured the participation of their candidates. Liberia, Seychelles, Nicaragua and Uganda previously reported that they would not be present while Benin and Mauritius did not continue with the franchise. A short time later, three more countries canceled their national events due to economic issues: Guyana, Thailand and Zambia, while Swaziland postponed its local election to the end of November and Saint Maarten decided rather to try some luck in Miss Universe. This year representatives from Belarus, Moldova and Northern Ireland would debut in Miss World while candidates from Barbados and Denmark would return to the competition. The rights in this Scandinavian country were taken by a modeling agency, who appointed Anne Katrine Vrang as its representative. In Australia, Chile and Uruguay private castings were held for Miss World. This year, due to financial reasons, Canal 13 of Chile gave up producing the Miss World Chile contest, so Daniella Campos (Miss World Chile ’98, Queen of the Americas and semi-finalist of Miss World ’98), together with the costume designer Millaray Palma, created the company “A queen for Chile” and in a closed selection, with 6 candidates, they chose Isabel Bawlitza as Miss World Chile 2000, with Christianne Balmelli coming in second. “In my selection, only the cameras were missing. The contest was very demanding and the jury very qualified” declared the new Miss World Chile on the day of her presentation to the press. For her part, the Australians chose Renee Henderson, who already had previous experience in international competitions since she had gone to Miss Universe ’98; and the Uruguayans selected Katja Thomsen, who shortly before had won the international contest “Reina de Punta del Este”. On the other hand, Botswana did not hold its national contest either, but appointed the first runner-up of its 1999 edition, Puna Keleabetswe Serati, as its flag bearer.

The official arrival dates were Friday the 3rd, Saturday the 4th and Sunday the 5th of November. In those days 95 of the 99 expected candidates arrived. In the end, Miss ALBANIA (Gentiana Ramadani), Miss ARMENIA (Gohar Hartunyan) and Miss MACEDONIA (Sanja Nikolic) canceled their participation, while Miss LATVIA (Dina Kalandarova) was expected until the last minute. However, she excused herself due to illness and did not make it to the contest. In any case, the 50th anniversary of Miss World had the largest number of participants in history, up to that moment, with 95 girls, one more delegate than the previous year. The candidates were accommodated at the Hilton hotel in Park Lane and in the first days of their stay they went shopping and rehearsed the first event at the Millennium Dome in London. It should be noted that the Morleys had been quite busy since only three weeks before (on October 13) they had held the Mister World final (in its third edition) at the Crieff Hydro hotel in Edinburgh, Scotland, an event that brought together 33 young men and which was won by Uruguay’s Ignacio Kliche.\n\nASSAULT ON THE DOME.-\n\nJust hours before the official launch of Miss World, thieves tried to steal the Millennium diamond collection a few meters from where the candidates would be presented. Fortunately, the criminals were arrested by the police who caught them “red handed.” The 12 diamonds, worth £ 350 million, were exchanged for copies after the raid and would be returned when the vault was repaired. But Michelle Walker, 19, the reigning Miss England, posed with the real 203-carat Millennium Star at De Beers in London. The stone, the size of an egg, is considered one of the most beautiful jewels in the world. Liverpool’s Walker at the time had 10-1 odds at the bookmakers to win the title. Her toughest competition was Miss India, which included unpublished poetry writing and folk dancing among her talents. Otherwise, everything continued as usual at the Millennium Dome. The only trace of the assault was a tarp over a broken door and a notice explaining that the jewelry display was closed due to an “incident.” Some visitors were disappointed that the bulldozer used to crash into the Dome during the assault had been removed. But the crime scene rivaled many of the Dome’s other attractions.\n\nOFFICIAL LAUNCH OF THE CONTEST.-\n\nThe official launch event for Miss World at the Millennium Dome, the gigantic amusement park in the London borough of Greenwich, took place Wednesday, November 8 at 9:30 a.m., 24 hours after four men in gas masks stormed in the Dome, dropping smoke bombs and carrying nail guns and sledgehammers. All 95 Misses participated in the Miss World 2000 pageant launch just 50 yards from the vault where the Millennium Jewels were supposed to be displayed. This event was presented by Stephen Douglas (son of the Morleys) who introduced the 95 candidates in alphabetical order in groups of five, all smiling and wearing a white sports uniform, consisting of shorts and a sweatshirt, sponsored by Zee TV. They then posed individually for the international press at the Millennium Dome. When Miss Spain, Miss India and Miss Venezuela appeared, the flashes lit up the whole place! Other girls, like Miss Sri Lanka, looked extremely skinny in those shorts that seemed too big for all of them. Miss Chile and Miss Puerto Rico were good surprises. Both tall and with perfect figures, they paraded as expert models. There were other pretty faces from Latin America, like Brazil, Bolivia, and Uruguay. In the end, they all posed together in the middle of fireworks to officially start the celebration of the 50 years of the contest. Eric Morley, the creator of it, could not be present because he had a very strong pain in his back.\n\nERIC MORLEY DIES.-\n\nThe world of glitz, glamor and stunningly beautiful girls was mourning the sad news of the death of Miss World pageant founder Eric Morley. In the early hours of Thursday, November 9, the legendary Eric Morley, creator of the pageant, died at the age of 82 at Princess Grace Hospital, in west London, as a result of a heart attack. He had been very much looking forward to celebrating 50 years of the pageant, but sadly he did not get to witness his 50th event on the land of its birth. Channel 5, which had broadcast the last two pageants, announced Morley’s death hours after the candidates launched the 2000 pageant at the Millennium Dome. Morley began his career in 1946 when he became an entertainment publicist. He later introduced commercial bingo to Britain and created “Come Dancing” in 1949, a show about ballroom dancing that became the longest running television series in the world. He ran for parliament in 1974 and 1979 and narrowly lost. She did not intend the Miss World pageant to be an annual event when she hosted her first beauty event for the Festival of Great Britain in 1951. But the following year, the United States opened the rival Miss Universe pageant, and Morley couldn’t resist the challenge. The pageant regularly sparked controversy, with critics saying it was degrading to women. But Morley had no regrets: “If it’s embarrassing for women, the best thing they can do is turn it off (the television),” he once said.\n\nEric Douglas Morley was born in a Holborn area warehouse (central London) on September 26, 1918. He was educated at Whitstable Primary School and on the Royal Naval Training Ship, HMS Exmouth. His father died when he was two years old, and before he was 12, his mother and stepfather had also died of tuberculosis. At Exmouth, he distinguished himself as a first-class teacher. Later, he was sent to the Army School of Education, where he learned the French horn, becoming a boy in the “Royal Fusiliers” band. During World War II he served with the “Royal Fusiliers” and with the “Royal Army Service Corps”, specializing in beach landings. He was demobilized in 1946 with the rank of captain. His entertainment career began that same year when he was put in charge of advertising in Mecca, then a small and thriving company. He was appointed CEO six years later and then CEO and the company became a great success. A few years later, in 1960, Eric married Julia Evelyn Pritchard, and with her he had three sons, also raised a fourth child from Julia’s previous marriage and adopted a girl in the 70s who died of a regrettable illness in 1985. He was the promoter of the Mecca ballrooms and the BBC’s “Come Dancing” programs. He joined the Variety Club in 1961 to donate part of the proceeds from the Miss World pageant to charity. His wife Julia, who began working on the pageant in 1969, created the slogan “Beauty with a Purpose” in 1972. As president of Variety Clubs International in 1977, Morley helped raise more than £ 7 million for poor children and disabled. He also served as president of the Outward Bound Trust.\n\nThe bureaucrats at Grand Metropolitan Hotels, the conglomerate that took over his and his Mecca interests, tried to align him with their traditional hierarchies, but it took a few years before they succeeded in overthrowing him. In Mecca, Morley was revered by the 15,000 employees, for whom he established a generous bonus plan; but others found it difficult to accept. Scandalous, hard-working, and abrasive, even his admirers didn’t consider him modest. “I can honestly say that I have a bit of a brain,” he once said, “and I’m the kind of man who walks where angels fear to tread.” In 1978, Morley was forced to leave Mecca, of which he was then president, after fighting with the parent company, Grand Metropolitan. He left with an agreement that he could continue with Miss World. The rights to the pageant were later sold to Belhaven Brewery, where Morley was co-president from 1979 to 1984, and later, in 1983, to a company owned by the Morleys. At the age of 63, Morley completed the London Marathon despite a knee tendon injury. Tony Hatch, the ‘barker chief’ of Variety Clubs International, said: “Eric Morley was a giant man in every sense of the word, one of the great humanitarians of the 20th century. He will be greatly missed by all of his friends around the world with sadness”. His funeral was held on Saturday, November 10, 2000 in the British capital. A service of thanksgiving was held at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, with the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh represented. He left a property valued at £ 10.6 million and was buried in London’s West Norwood Cemetery.\n\nTRIP TO MALDIVES.-\n\nOn the night of Wednesday, November 8, the 95 candidates traveled to the Maldives Islands, in the Indian Ocean, for the filming of the contest. After long hours of waiting at London airport, sitting on the floor or on their luggage, the young women boarded an Air Lanka flight to begin the long 10 and a half hour journey to the islands. The girls learned of Eric Morley’s death when they arrived at Malé International Airport, the Maldivian capital, on the morning of Thursday, November 9. There, they received garlands of flowers in a simple welcome and were given a drink of coconut water. Outside the terminal, a group of girls were waiting to entertain them with their dance, and the spectators applauded the Misses with enthusiasm. The contestants and Miss World Staff members stayed at Bandos Island Resort, Full Moon Beach Resort, and Paradise Island. The Miss World swimwear category was shot at some of the resorts and would conclude on November 18. Interestingly, there was no representative from the Maldives in the contest. The reason was the strict Islamism in the country, and even, the contestants would only have contact with the hotel staff, other foreign tourists and the international press invited to cover the event.\n\nCHARITY DINNER POSTPONED.-\n\nThe charity dinner with the Miss World participants in the Maldives had to be postponed due to bad weather. Dinner was scheduled for the evening of Friday, November 10 in Kuda Bandos, but was postponed to November 18, according to the Maldives Tourism Promotion Board (MTPB). The money raised from the dinner would be donated to help disabled people and thalassemia patients. Over 400 tickets were sold, priced at Rf 500 each. Zaki Nafiz, the Maldives media coordinator for the Miss World pageant, said that although the Maldives would attend the dinner, it was aimed more at foreigners as it was an international event. However, some of the offices that were selling the tickets said that the Maldivians had bought most of the tickets. Zaki said that beauty queens from different countries would attend the event and as they had certain commercial contractual obligations, only special sponsors of the contest could take pictures. Hence, the local media could not participate in the event. Haveeru had been informed that the organizers of the contest had ceded the exclusive rights to the benefit dinner to Zee TV of India. Some local singers would also perform on the Kuda Bandos stage during dinner.\n\nACTIVITIES IN THE MALDIVES.-\n\nThe Maldives had a very beautiful tropical landscape, graceful coconut trees leaning over crystal clear lagoons, coral reefs, and plenty of sunshine, and Miss World 2000 was the largest international event to be held on its shores. Until the arrival of tourism, fishing was the main occupation in this nation of sailors. Now, “the last paradise on earth” was fervent with the activity of hosting the largest event in its history and was expected to give its unspoiled shores the much-needed boost, with hour-long clips of the contest filmed during several days in the exotic places that would be shown in the final of the contest, since its entire economy was based on tourism. Officials hoped that the high media exposure the Maldives would receive during the show, which was seen by billions of people around the world, would guarantee it a more prominent place on the world map, as it was one of the most attenuated countries in the world, an island nation that practically nested in oblivion. The 1,196 islands, on 26 different coral atolls, are spread over a total area of ​​90,000 square kilometers (about 36,000 square miles) of the Indian Ocean, but less than 0.5 percent of that is land. Only 87 of the islands were exclusive resort islands and about 200 of the islands were inhabited. A melting pot of different cultures, as people from different parts of the world came and settled there, a country that had, at that time, the highest divorce rate on the planet. Now, beauties from around the world had descended on the Maldives, a nation passionate about the sun, the sea, the sand, and the heavenly beauties.\n\nDressed in a shocking pink blouse with a full green and pink sarong, Priyanka Chopra from India, looking ravishing with a huge flower in her hair, said that the sarong was mandatory by the rules “as the Miss World people are very particular with respect”. Miss Sri Lanka, Miss Bangladesh and Miss Nepal were also wrapped in colorful sarongs on the set at the “Full Moon Beach Resort.” But for many others, the sarongs had been reduced almost to the length of a scarf. For some, it was held diagonally with mesh covers and laces that barely reached the end of their colorful bikinis. These were also held, coincidentally, in the hands of beauties more than wearing. The beachwear section was all about. The scope of the designer range, even in bikinis and one-piece swimsuits, was evident in the profusion of colors and variety on all the long-legged bodies. The naked skin was also of all shades: dark, light, yellow, the colors of the skin in the world.\n\nSome, like Julie Martin from Northern Ireland, preferred to wear shorts and a half top. Unlike others who had worked hard on her skin and body, Julie said that she had not had time to undergo special treatments. “I show myself as I am,” said the dental nurse looking natural and pretty. However, most admitted to having come “very prepared.” Like Miss Venezuela, Vanessa Cárdenas, who said that she had attended public speaking and catwalk classes, including exercise sessions, for the past four months. A computer engineer from Maracaibo, the 19-year-old had to leave her studies and move to Caracas for preparations. For the elegant 1.72m girl her advantage would be her body, she said. “My face, body and eyes are nice. I am a spontaneous person and I hope to achieve it.” In her country her title meant a lot and people “would die for me to be in the fight,” she said. With many Venezuelan beauties who had reached the top several times, the beauty business had become very popular. Sarybel Velilla from Puerto Rico also received six weeks of training after being crowned in her country and she felt well prepared. At that time she had received lessons in public speaking, skincare, and gymnastics. For the 24-year-old biology student, “it was necessary to set goals and not be disappointed.” Miss Australia, Renee Henderson, had her own modeling agency for promotional work and wanted to steer her career, through Miss World, towards acting. For her, participating in the contest had a clear occupational reward. “I don’t see it as degrading to women,” she said. “It is not abusive or enslaving. It is our choice.”\n\nMiss Sri Lanka was studying microbiology and was a 400 meter runner, a chess champion and a talented magician (she did a trick with the rope, with Miss South Africa acting as an assistant). Miss Yugoslavia was a modern and ambitious person, well aware of her capabilities. Miss Belarus’s dream was to discover and test a new mathematical rule; and Miss New Zealand was interested in both ancient Egyptian history and yacht design. Wow! What happened to the boys and pop music? Michelle Watson from Scotland saw the contest as an “opportunity to come here and enjoy”. Dressed in a light blue bikini covered with a black chiffon half sarong, the 19-year-old model saw it as an opportunity to stand out. Miss Dominican Republic, Gilda Jovine, a second-year communication student and part-time model, included yoga in her exercise regimen “as it calms the mind and enhances the body.” She is an advocate for many causes, including protecting whales from extinction. She said that “the projection these contests give should be used to advantage to address the issues.” “Win or lose the exhibition can be very productive,” said the charming young woman. Miss Wales, Sophie-Kate Cahill, was excited to compete. Miss England, Michelle Walker, was a fitness instructor from Merseyside. She missed her parents and her boyfriend, who works for Sainsbury’s in Wirral, but “it’s really nice to get to know different cultures. She has brought us all together.” Miss Scotland said that she missed her boyfriend because it was his birthday. Miss Curaçao wanted to become a pop star. Miss Israel, 19, was shy and hoped that the political situation in her country would improve. Many of her friends were in the military, but she did not have to do it for “medical reasons.” On the side of her, Miss Estonia had been crying. The other girls were to blame. The 17-year-old ballet dancer Irina Ovtchinnikova seemed unappreciated. She was a bit unworthy, they believed, for her extravagant way of dressing…\n\nThe girls locked themselves in their rooms at 10:30 p.m. They missed home, they were more sober than a nun (alcohol was forbidden), and they broke down after calling home on the hotel phones. Photographers were commenting “How did Miss X get here?” a game, in which Miss Wales tended to make a lot of appearances. The banned list was comprehensive: no drinking alcohol, no smoking (in public), no swimming, no barefoot on the beach, no tattoos, no piercings, and no fraternizing with anyone unrelated to the contest. Miss Ireland, Yvonne Ellard, from Tipperary, was the first of the Misses to find a way to break the security cordon. “We had a little party in our room last night and we didn’t go to bed until 1:30 am,” she confessed. So, had they managed to find a way around the prohibition of alcohol? Miss Ireland looked nervously at her chaperone and smiled sweetly: “I’d rather you ask me another question.” “I’m totally nervous, anxious, paranoid,” she confessed later. “The other girls have an air of confidence that makes you feel five inches tall. Most of them are models and they all have their legs up to their necks. I know I have no hope of winning” and she might be right. Miss India, 18, writes stories, lectures on AIDS awareness, acts in street plays and thought she was a criminal psychologist. And she also she was incredibly beautiful. For her part, Miss South Africa, Heather Hamilton said “This is much better than Miss Universe, we are having a great time!”\n\nScary-looking chaperones patrolled the area, checking for questions about boyfriends or politics. The organizers were keen to avoid any scandal. The contestants, divided into eight groups of twelve each, were guarded and protected by two chaperones for each group. Any move to get closer to the Misses was thwarted by them immediately. “Neither photographs nor talks while they relax” was the chaperone’s chant at the Resort where the girls were staying. “They even follow us when we go to the bathroom,” grumbled Miss Wales, before turning her attention to the urgent search for a pair of pliers to remove the forbidden ring she had on her navel before the filming on the beach. However, things weren’t as bad as they seemed. With a full contingent of hotel staff, security, and the Maldives Promotion Board present, the vigil was near perfect. Tourists had no opportunity to see the girls, as the filming was done in private, away from the unwelcome gaze of the public.\n\nMiss Mexico recounted on Monday the 13th her experience in the Maldives: “These days in the Maldives have been great! The people are so hospitable and charming here, it is overwhelming! Everyone is very polite and we have been pampered to the limit. For example, they don’t have us on a diet. For each meal, four different delicious dishes are served. During the day our activities are basically photo sessions and the pre-recording of the beachwear competition, which will air the day of the finals. We are divided into several groups, which means that when one group is filming the rest of the girls are free to enjoy the beauty of this wonderful place. This has allowed the contestants to become closer friends, since we are always talking, playing cards, telling jokes, having a good time together. Some of my best friends are the Misses from Estonia, Poland, Colombia, Russia, Chile, Slovenia, and my lovely roommate, Miss Gibraltar. I have no words to express how happy I am at this moment. The atmosphere here is so relaxed… Tomorrow (Tuesday 14th) we will have a farewell party. In two more days we will head to Paradise Island to continue working on the photography and filming sessions. On November 19 we will return to London. The girls are a bit agitated right now, trying to decide what to wear tomorrow night for that special occasion. We all want to look our best! Everything has been perfect, except for the death of Mr. Morley. We are saddened and sorry for her wife and will do our best to encourage Mrs. Morley when we are with her. I want to take this opportunity to thank all the Mexicans and all those who have supported me. The love and positive comments from them are very important to me”.\n\nAll 95 Miss World 2000 contestants relaxed after completing swimsuit footage of the event. The girls gathered for a celebratory cocktail after the stresses and strains of posing on the beach in the Maldives. Perhaps the biggest pressure was on Miss India, Priyanka Chopra, 18, with the aim of making sure her country won the award for the second year in a row. The bookies seemed to think that Priyanka had a chance, becoming her favorite along with Miss South Africa. It was previously feared that the beachwear section could be finished in time due to tropical storms looming over the islands. But tropical storms cast a shadow on the Miss World 2000 pageant. It had rained every shooting day for the beachwear section, but naturally the contestants didn’t let that dampen their spirits. But the off-season weather subsided enough to allow for traditional footage of the girls posing by the pool or walking on the beach.\n\nWelcoming contestants for the charity event in Bondos on Saturday the 18th, Maldives Minister of Tourism Hassan Zuber hoped that the islands would have presented a perfect setting for the “swimsuit section” on the eve of the final round in London. “Since it is the 50th anniversary of the Miss World pageant, we want the rounds that include the ‘swimsuit section’ in Maldives to be a memorable experience for the contestants and the people involved in the event,” the minister told journalists. In the environment of the Maldives Islands, a serene and harmonious atmosphere, the mixture of natural and deadly beauty, was very intoxicating. Although the swimsuit was featured on location filming simply to ensure contestants had a reasonable figure, it was not included in later rounds where the girls’ talent, balance, and personality were the focus.\n\nDressed in a sparkling bottle green sari and adorned with tikka and gold trim, Priyanka Chopra from India stood out as a charming and balanced candidate and pleased everyone with smiles and photographs. In resorts and elsewhere among the locals, it was Priyanka who emerged as her top favorite. At her farewell dinner at the ‘Full Moon Beach Resort’, it was Priyanka whom everyone waited for and competed to be photographed with her. “She will be Miss World and this will be the best photo of my life,” said Javed Ahmed, Front Desk Manager at the Beach Resort. The other favorites were Miss Venezuela and Miss Bangladesh. Dressed in their evening gowns, all the contestants, tall and elegant, dazzled at the meeting. Lined outside by the chaperones, they entered the event in a file with their country badges and conscious smiles. Each carried small wallets and cameras, which clicked along with professional flashes. Amid requests for photos, they relaxed, loosed their hair, danced to the music, but within two hours, the strict chaperones declared it was time to pack and took them away.\n\nTHEY ADMIRED MISS INDIA.-\n\nThey were neighbors, but the beauty accessories, care and training that an Indian beauty queen received before entering an international pageant was simply unimaginable for any of India’s smaller neighboring countries. The Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi and Nepalese contestants for the Miss World 2000 pageant wondered in disbelief when they saw that the bracelets and bindis worn by Miss India were sponsored, something they couldn’t even think of in their countries. Miss Sri Lanka, Ganga Gunasekera, who was Miss India, Priyanka Chopra’s roommate, said that except for her airfare, a sponsorship from a hairdresser and a cosmetics company, she had had to manage everything for the account of her. “My whole wardrobe is arranged by myself, unlike Priyanka’s, for whom the best designers have created exquisite creations,” she said. However, Ganga, a microbiology student, had no complaints. In fact, she was grateful to Priyanka. ”Her training is so perfect that I have collected many tips to face the contest. She is really sweet to be willing to inform me and teach me’,’ she said. Miss Sri Lanka attributed the “low priority given to beauty” in her country to the prevailing political situation. “Maybe if things were stable, we could have thought more about these things,” she said. Miss Bangladesh, Sonia Gazi, 21, admitted that beauty pageants were gaining popularity in her country. “Especially after Sushmita Sen won the Miss Universe crown, beauty pageants are crazy there,” she said. Sonia claimed that there were almost 25,000 applicants for the national contest, and said that over the years, more and more people were looking towards India as she had been producing winners steadily. “The beauty business within the country has a lot of support,” said the third-year home economics and textiles student. Although the beauty business was emerging as a big business in Bangladesh, it obviously did not yet have the resources and training facilities as India did, Sonia lamented.\n\nMISS WORLD ALL YEAR ON THE INTERNET.-\n\nTo mark and celebrate the 50th anniversary of Miss World, Endemol Entertainment UK, Terra Networks and the Miss World organization were giving this year’s television show a definitive home on the Internet. The Missworld.terra.com page was launched on November 17 and would then continue throughout the year, providing a window into international press and television activity, and then culminating in the annual televised finale. In the run-up to the main event, the new website would broadcast exclusive behind-the-scenes footage in the Maldives, where the contestants were filmed in swimsuits. The 2000 event itself would also be featured with live video broadcasts on site, from behind the scenes, and camera positions dedicated to webcasting. A live video chat with the new Miss World would also be offered after the event. The coronation ball, which takes place after the pageant, would be shown this year exclusively on the website, where for the first time, Miss United Kingdom would be crowned as part of this post-ceremony event. The Miss World website would allow the public to meet and greet the Miss World competitors. In the week leading up to the contest, the website was going to broadcast live talks between the contestants and the public. Visitors to the website could also suggest questions for the show’s host, Jerry Springer, to ask the finalists that night.\n\nEndemol UK Interactive Media Director Chris Short said: “The 50th anniversary of Miss World will be an event that has the United Nations in a shared global contest for five decades, fully exploiting the Net’s global communications potential for the first time. From now on, Miss World will never be considered an annual event; it will be live online 24 hours a day. “Rich in still images and video footage, missworld.terra.com was destined to become the primary point of contact, entertainment, and information for Miss World fans across the globe. Endemol Entertainment UK would produce and maintain the website content as part of a four-year agreement. Terra Networks built the website with Lycos, which had just completed high-profile online support for the Sydney Olympics. Chris Short added: “Sadly, this whole deal was due in large part to Eric Morley’s unique enthusiasm and drive and it is a bitter irony that he is not here to see it now.” Endemol Entertainment UK, one of the UK’s largest television production groups, incorporated Bazal and Initial as the television production branches. GEM was the third branch of the company dedicated to the full exploitation of rights and trademarks. The group also recently acquired a 50% stake in award-winning digital media company Victoria Real and a 25% stake in television and online comedy content production company Zeppotron.com. Initial was producing Miss World for the third year in a row and GEM was distributing the event worldwide after having sold it to more than 120 countries every year since 1998.\n\nRETURN TO LONDON.-\n\nOn the night of Sunday, November 19, the contestants left the Maldives Islands to return to London. After more than 10 hours of flight, they arrived back in the British capital at dawn on Monday the 20th and were taken to the Hilton Hotel on Park Lane, where they were staying. In London a special game show called “Night Fever” had been broadcast on that Sunday night, a kind of karaoke game, with the four British contestants who had recorded it before going to the Maldives. On Tuesday, November 21, the participants visited King College Hospital in London where they brought gifts to the children of the Variety Club held there as part of their “Beauty with a Purpose” work. On Thursday, the 23rd, the International Variety Club charity lunch was held at the Grosvenor House hotel where the national gifts that each girl brought from her countries were auctioned and, where there was also a photographic opportunity for the press. The candidates attended this activity wearing evening dresses. The days 24th and 25th of November were dedicated exclusively to the rehearsals in the Dome. On Sunday, the 26th, the “Miss World Christmas & Family Party” was held at the Grosvenor House Hotel and where the girls made their talent show, as was customary. The most applauded was Miss Sri Lanka presenting a magic act. On Monday, November 27, the participants visited and toured the Palace of Westminster and on Tuesday, November 28, the Dress Rehearsal was held at the Millennium Dome.\n\nFinally, Wednesday, November 29, was reserved for the private evaluation with the judges, who, for two and a half minutes, interviewed the 95 candidates while they presented themselves in their evening wear. Miss France was concerned that the judges’ questions were not difficult enough, while Miss Czech Republic feared that a final interview of just over two minutes would be too short to reveal the “true intellectual depth” of each participant. Such were the concerns among the Miss World contestants. Later they were seen in swimsuits in groups of 8 or 9. The jury made three lists with ten candidates each, one for beauty, elegance and grace in a ball gown, another for personality and talent in an interview and the last one for bearing and figure in swimsuit. The 10 that were repeated the most in the lists of the nine judges, would be the semifinalists. Incidentally, it had been announced that ex-Miss World ’97 from India, Diana Hayden, would be part of the judges, but this did not happen in the end.\n\nFORGET ABOUT STIGMA. MISS WORLD MEANS ‘BUSINESS’.-\n\nFor many of the Miss World 2000 hopefuls, the old stigma of the cattle market just didn’t matter: it was about business. This year’s contestants included aspiring doctors and lawyers, business students, aspiring economists and mathematics. For them, the pageant was a great opportunity to network and promote their professional careers. “There is still a bit of stigma. (But) a lot of girls aspire to be doctors and lawyers and to enter other professions,” Miss Jamaica, Ayisha Richards, a 24-year-old law student, told Reuters at a benefit luncheon on Thursday, November 23. “It’s an opportunity for us to explore how our professions work in other people’s countries. It is a business network: we will all remember having participated in the contest, we have it in common and it could generate business later”. Miss Barbados, Leilani McConney, 19, who was studying international banking and finance in Switzerland, agreed and said that she had already established new contacts. “It’s a way for us to make business connections’, ‘ she said. The 95 contestants in the 50th edition of Miss World covered a wide spectrum of academic fields. Miss Costa Rica was working as an industrial engineer and Miss Czech Republic was studying journalism. One of the favorites, Miss India, was studying to be a clinical psychologist “to understand why people go crazy.”\n\nMeanwhile, Miss Belarus longed to push the boundaries of mathematical theory. “I like working with computers and mathematical formulas. I would like to open up some new areas of mathematical theory”, said Sviatlana Kruk, 21. “Beauty pageants are for when you are young. You won’t be smiling forever”. And in the contest there was everything ‘as in a pharmacy’. Miss Holland, Raja Moussaoui, was a high-flying banker with a black belt in judo. Miss Germany, Natascha Berg, spoke six languages ​​and hoped to become a plastic surgeon. “This experience can help me learn to get along with different people with a variety of cultures,” she said. “I don’t want to spend my whole life in Germany.” Her attitude was typical of contestants willing to exploit their looks to improve their careers, see different parts of the world, or act as ambassadors for their countries. Miss Jamaica, Ayisha Richards, was training to be a lawyer and wanted to specialize in intellectual property. She said the image of the competition in the Caribbean was very different from that of Great Britain. Richards said, “You can’t say that being in a competition like this makes me a less good lawyer.” Miss Bolivia, Jimena Rico-Toro, wanted to establish an organ donation system in her country, while the Bosnia-Herzegovina candidate, Jasmina Mahmutovic, was a medical student and was against tobacco. “You have to show that you are different, that you are eccentric,” said Nigerian representative Matilda Kerry, a 19-year-old medical student.\n\nRegarded as fun and “not supposed to be taken seriously,” the contest, founded by businessman Eric Morley in 1951, had been criticized by feminists over the years as degrading to women. Morley, who died a few weeks earlier, and his wife Julia, now the sole organizer, had said the contest should simply be viewed as fun. “It’s a fun, fantasy title.” But the stigma of the ‘dumb blonde’ seemed to persist still. “Hopefully we can get it out of Britain again,” said Amy Jowett of the Society of Socialist Students and Workers. But the girls said that the pageant was an opportunity for personal growth and cultural exchange. “I’ve met girls from countries I’ve never heard of,” said Angelique Breaux of San Diego, California, who represented the United States. She insisted that winning the contest was more than just an appearance. “You can’t just sit back and look pretty for a year,” said Breaux, who worked with cancer charities.\n\nTHE QUEENS ARRIVE.-\n\nThe Miss World organization invited the former queens to attend the celebration of the 50 years of the pageant. However, the organizers would only pay for the hotel room, since the airfare depended on each of them. On Tuesday, November 28, a press conference was held with 16 of the former beauty queens at the Hilton hotel on Park Lane. “We are well maintained, aren’t we?” Said Gina Tolleson-Thicke, the tall, dark and luscious Miss World 1990, the last Miss America to win. “I’m sure I’m a little rounder here and there, but that’s okay.” Now 30, she was one of the youngest at that dreamy cocktail party on the 28th floor of the Hilton Hotel, overlooking the most elegant part of London, with a glass of champagne in one hand, a canapé in the other and more of a dozen former Miss Worlds as a company. From May-Louise Flodin, the 1952 winner, the second Miss World and the second Swede in the days when Sweden was synonymous with spectacular girls, to Linor Abargil of Israel, Miss World in 1998. Gathered for the 50th pageant, taking place at the Millennium Dome, they were, it had to be said, an announcement of something wonderful. There hadn’t been a reunion like this in 25 years and it felt like something strangely at odds with the creepiest treatment the Miss World pageant sometimes received.\n\nBlessed by nature with good looks that had endured in all cases, graduated from the most intense social circle that could be imagined in their year of reign, these women gave good talk. Cindy Breakspeare of Jamaica, Miss World 1976, was, among other things, the mother of one of Bob Marley’s children. Mary Stavin, still the image of the Swedish blonde, was Miss World in 1977, she became a Bond girl and for three years, until 1985, she was a member of the Miss World team alongside George Best. Now married to an English merchant banker and mother of a four-year-old daughter, she lived between New York and Los Angeles. She was 19 years old, she was living with her parents and was studying at school when she went to London for the pageant. “It happened really fast,” she said. “I was a girl who was used to saying ‘no thanks’. Suddenly they were giving me Volvos, fur coats…”. She speaks of George Best with kindness, but with a firmness that she would keep him from being swept up in the mess. “She has many talents that he hasn’t expressed,” she said, “but of course he had problems. I didn’t want to waste time on substances like that.” Mary Stavin said that she was unprepared for the debates with the feminists that involved her in 1977, not because she was weak, she certainly was not, but because in Sweden female emancipation was taken for granted. She also added, as a point of debate, that she raised £ 3.5 million for charity. Denise Perrier Lamfranchi, from France, Miss World 1953, was 65 years old. She started out as a model, but went on to local politics in Nice and founded women’s organizations there. She did not seem like a woman absorbed in her appearance.\n\nThe beauties of yesteryear included the first Indian to win the event, Dr. Reita Faria Powell, Miss World 1966, who was recorded on Irish television in 1999 for condemning the Miss World pageant saying it was already expired. Powell, who lives in Dublin with her doctor husband, said the contest “did little or nothing for India when they organized it and despite what the organizers are saying about it now, it is past its peak.” She went on to dismiss the months she spent in 1966 as the most beautiful woman in the world, saying it was “just a distraction.” She was a medical student when she became the first Miss India to win. “We move slowly in India. It took us 15 years to get started. They were much more innocent times”, she said. “There was no television in India, I came alone and there was nothing to fear. I was 23 years old and I think I was the only college student who participated that year. I was a little puzzled to win”. She is now married to a medical professor and has two daughters who are doctors. “India wins most of the years”, she said. “They are Miss World’s superpower”. ” And why not. . We are a very beautiful race”. Who knows the ins and outs of these women’s lives? Certainly, most of them looked good. Here, in many cases, brains and beauty seemed to be linked. Over the years Miss World had had her trials, girls who had become famous for the wrong reasons, the one who had to be dethroned for being too lewd and wasting her reign on tabloid headlines and Playboy poses and the one who quit for being a single mother. But They had mostly been the story as scripted and, in the month of the death of Eric Morley, inventor and owner of the Miss World pageant, many of them remembered him with fondness and gratitude. It was no wonder that for many of these women It was one of the central days of their lives, or perhaps their entire life. For some of them it changed everything. Many of them seemed to retain a bit of celebrity sparkle, even to their own surprise. “Yesterday I went shopping for clothes” said Gina Tolleson-Thicke, “when the man in the store said, ‘I remember your dress’. What? I asked. ‘Yeah, the one you wore that night. It was white with those sleeves’ “.\n\nIn total, in the celebration of the 50 years of the contest 21 ex-Miss World were present. They were: 1952- May-Louise Flodin (Sweden); 1953- Denise Perrier Landfranchi (France); 1958- Penny Coelen (South Africa); 1963- Carole Joan Crawford (Jamaica); 1966- Reita Faria Powell (India); 1970- Jennifer Hosten-Craig (Granada); 1971- Lucia Petterle (Brazil); 1975- Wilmelia Merced (Puerto Rico); 1976- Cindy Breakspeare (Jamaica); 1977- Mary Stavin (Sweden); 1980- Kimberly Santos (Guam); 1982- Mariasela Álvarez (Dominican Republic); 1986- Giselle Laronde-West (Trinidad-Tobago); 1988- Linda Petursdottir (Iceland); 1990- Gina Tolleson Thicke (United States); 1992- Julia Kurochkina (Russia); 1993- Lisa Hanna (Jamaica); 1995- Jacqueline Aguilera (Venezuela); 1997- Diana Hayden (India); 1998- Linor Abargil (Israel); and 1999- Yukta Mookhey (India). Decades after their victory, they all met people who remembered their names from their night of glory. They were once Miss World, but they would always be Miss World …\n\nTHE ROOMMATES.-\n\nHere is a table with the list of roommates of the candidates for Miss World 2000:\n\nFAVORITES.-\n\nThe big favorites of the bookmakers were Miss India and Miss Venezuela. Both disputed chances of 6-1. The day before the final, Miss India’s odds had improved to 9-2. Miss Northern Ireland, Julie Lee-Ann Martin, from East Belfast, was 12-1, while Miss England, Michelle Walker, from Liverpool, and Miss Scotland, Michelle Watson, from Motherwell, were 16-1. Others mentioned among the favorites were Miss Mexico, Miss Czech Republic, Miss Costa Rica, Miss South Africa and Miss Belarus. William Hill bookies had won just $ 210 in bets at the contest and attributed the steep decline to “political correctness.”\n\nTHE BETS FALL.-\n\nThe William Hill bookmaker was considering ending gambling on beauty pageants. Before the Miss World finals, only 2,570 pounds had been traded. In the past, bettors flocked to bookmakers when there were contests. In the mid-1970s, it was marketed for an average of £ 250,000 at each Miss World, Ananova news service reported. “If the numbers do not dramatically increase before we close betting on the day of the final, we will seriously consider stopping betting on next year’s event,” said William Hill spokeswoman Serena Momberg. “To put this in perspective, I can say that we accepted bets for £ 500,000 during the US elections. These sums also increase during the football cup”. “We believe that the decline in the Miss World bets is due to several factors. Among other things, the low interest of the media. William Hill had Miss India as a favorite. If you bet on her, you would get 4.5 times the bet back. The house Playoff bookmaker believed that Miss Mexico was the favorite and returned six times the bet if she won. Miss Norway was way down the list. If you put a hundred pounds on Stine Pedersen, you could collect 5,000 pounds if she won the crown.\n\nGOSSIP OF MISS WORLD 2000.-\n\n* This year, the Miss World organization accepted candidates at the age of 16. In fact, there were three of them who were that age. They were: Miss Austria, Miss Lithuania and Miss Moldova. On the contrary, the older girls were Miss Cayman Islands and Miss Sri Lanka, both were 25.\n\n* Miss Czech Republic, Michaela Salacova, won the first ‘online’ vote in history that made a website dedicated to beauty pageants (Global Beauties) along with nine other webmasters and was named the “Unofficial Miss Photogenic”. She received a total of 68 points, followed by Miss Slovenia, Masa Merc, with 63 and Miss Mexico, Paulina Flores, with 60. The others previously selected were Sviatlana Kruk, Miss Belarus; Priyanka Chopra, Miss India; Sun Wei Tan, Miss Malaysia; Mia de Klerk, Miss Namibia; Kathy de Guzman, Miss Philippines; Michelle Watson, Miss Scotland; Jacqueline Ntuyabaliwe, Miss Tanzania; Yuksel Ak, Miss Turkey; and Vanessa Cárdenas, Miss Venezuela.\n\n* Miss Colombia is the daughter of Miguel Durán Silva, who in the 90s was Colombia’s ambassador to the Republic of Korea. Durán has been a councilor in Bogotá, a representative to the House, and a special ambassador to the OAS, Egypt, and Israel.\n\n* Miss Finland gained 8 kilos during her stay in the Maldives. She was a lover of chocolate donuts. On the contrary, Miss Namibia lost many kilos and looked haggard …\n\n* Miss Sweden’s father was from the Gambia, so she was the country’s first brown-skinned Miss from that country. In contrast, Miss South Africa and Miss Namibia, countries with a black majority, were white-skinned candidates although they were chosen by black juries. Miss Canada had Korean blood, Miss Holland Moroccan blood, Miss Germany Spanish blood, and Miss British Virgin Islands Dominican blood. Miss Switzerland was born in New Zealand, Miss Hong Kong in Toronto (Canada) and Miss Finland in Calgary (Canada), the latter of a Hindu father. Miss Bolivia was the sister of Miss Bolivia ’90 and Top 6 of Miss Universe ’90, Rosario Rico-Toro. Miss Venezuela was the daughter of the second at Miss Chile ’68, Sonia Bravo, who won the Miss Objetivo International ’68 crown in Sao Paulo (Brazil). Macarena, Vanessa’s older sister, had been Miss Teen Colombia.\n\n* Miss South Africa had to ask her chaperone for help when a tabloid photographer leaned over the pool to take a picture of her and his shorts couldn’t cover her enormous dignity…\n\n* Miss Venezuela had been put as a roommate of Miss South Africa, because Osmel Sousa wanted Vanessa to practice the English language with a girl who spoke that language. But the Venezuelan smoked so much that the South African asked to change her room. She was then put with Miss Panama and the Honduran, who was previously with the Panamanian, went to the Venezuelan’s room. The Honduran did not complain because she smoked as much as her new roommate. By the way, one night there was so much concentrated cigarette smoke in the room that the fire alarms went off.\n\n* It was rumored that Miss Venezuela was a bit confrontational and that she once slapped her chaperone. But she denied it and said that the only problem she had with the chaperone was a reprimand for having gone without permission to Miss Lebanon’s room, who was her best friend at the pageant. On the other hand, Miss Yugoslavia reported finding her vomiting in the bathroom. Some media also reported that the Venezuelan used “too much” makeup.\n\n* “For six months I have not slept,” Miss Venezuela told the press, a little sad. “I have not gone out. I have not had fun” … She came to the contest with seven suitcases, one of the most prepared girls.\n\n* Miss India Priyanka Chopra admitted that she was under tremendous pressure as Lara Dutta had won the Miss Universe crown and her people’s hopes had risen that for the second time the country would hold both beauty titles in six years. “Fortunately, I perform better under pressure and I am confident that I will do my best in the contest,” said Chopra.\n\n* Miss Estonia had a past as a ‘go-go’ dancer in nude clubs and dressed a bit inappropriately, so she was frowned upon by the other contestants.\n\n* They found Miss Costa Rica a resemblance to Alicia Machado. Not only because of the physique but because of her vibrant personality. She was a gambler’s favorite and one of the most photographed in London.\n\n* Miss Chile, Isabel Bawlitza, complained about the makeup and hairstyle that were imposed on her in the Dress Rehearsal, while Bolivian newspapers chose Miss Brazil, Francine Eickemberg, as the candidate with the most beautiful face in the contest.\n\n* Miss Mexico was scared when she found out that her dresses had disappeared on the day of the finals. Fortunately, she found them shortly after (they had been delivered to the wrong room).\n\n* Julia Morley, who had been widowed two weeks earlier, said during the press conference on Thursday, November 23: “After 40 years together, it is difficult to come to terms. He was a wonderful husband and father. However, the show must go on. It will be a very moving moment and I hope I can do it half as well as he did”.\n\nCONTESTANT INFORMATION.-\n\nThe girls from Belgium, Dominican Republic, Namibia, Nigeria and South Africa competed in Miss Universe 2000, with the South African entering the Top 10. The Puerto Rican had competed in Miss Universe ’96 and the Australian in Miss Universe ’98. The Puerto Rican was also at Nuestra Belleza Internacional ’95. The Englishwoman won the Miss Model of the World ’99. Miss Guatemala participated in the Miss Intercontinental 2000 and won the Miss Belleza Mundial ’99. Miss Costa Rica won the International Coffee Queen that same year. For her part, Miss Belarus was Top 5 in Miss Commonwealth of Independent States ’99 and semifinalist in Miss Europe ’99. The Bolivian participated in World Miss University 2000 and the Trinidadian in the Miss Ámbar Mundial ’98. Miss Estonia went to Miss Hawaiian Tropic Intl. 2000 and won the Miss Trump Style in Atlantic City (USA). On the other hand, Miss USA was 2nd. runner-up of Miss USA ’99, Miss Panama competed in Girl Model ’96 and Miss Ukraine participated in the preselection of her country to the Super Model of the World ’99. Here is a table with the most important information about the Miss World 2000 candidates:\n\nMISS INDIA IN WAITING FOR THE BIG NIGHT.-\n\nWith four lucky charms, including a jar of Jerusalem soil, hidden, though highly unlikely, on her person, India’s hope for this year’s Miss World pageant, Priyanka Chopra, admitted that “there is a lot of pressure for ahead for Thursday night”. The 18-year-old said she relied heavily on the support of her parents. And she added: “All I need now is to find a boyfriend.” Chopra, one of the favorites in the beauty tournament, added diplomatically: “All of India is with me, two billion people!” ‘(Her mistake as India had barely reached one billion souls in 2000) .\n\nPerhaps in spirit, but for more substantial support, Chopra brought 20 people from India and a couple more from the United States to the contest. The former engineering student laughed a lot as she explained the decidedly unique way this beauty pageant had furthered her education: “Miss Jamaica has taught me two new dances, the Jerry Springer and the Butterfly, and I’m learning Spanish.” Chopra’s self-confidence apparently extended to explaining the more complicated aspects of becoming a beauty queen. When she was asked why the contestants constantly talked about working for a greener, AIDS-free, and more peaceful world and then became movie stars, she was enraged. “If you win the Miss World crown and platform, you are just a title holder,” she explained quite obviously, “and her charity to the end, your chance to do your part for the world. Anyway, only two percent of the contestants want to enter the glamor industry’.’ When she was asked what was wrong with glamor in a beauty pageant and if it wasn’t unreal to make it sound like rocket science, Chopra replied, “Yeah, it’s an experience.” Chopra was apparently unfazed by the quirks of the pageant on its 50th anniversary, pleasantly extrapolating Jerry Springer’s reputation as the king of television sleaze. “It will be an interesting twist, but no, it shouldn’t be the normal routine because nothing can be normal around Jerry Springer.” She said it was not humbling to face mortality and the ravages of time, when meeting the 21 previous winners, specially invited by Miss World to celebrate half a century of existence. “They look the same,” Chopra said more tactfully than truth, referring to the array of sensibly shod grandmothers and former beauty queens.\n\nDiana Hayden, who won the crown in 1997 and was also in town, could be trusted to be much more excited about beauty pageants. Hayden had apparently used her time in London to become something of a fixture in the international celebrity stratosphere and train in Shakespearean drama as well. She sure found it helpful to exchange notes with another successful Indian woman with domestic theatrical aspirations, Yukta Mookhey, the reigning Miss World.\n\nPROGRAM BOOK\n\nTHE FINALS.-\n\nThe fiftieth edition of Miss World was held on the night of Thursday, November 30 at the Millennium Dome, in the Greenwich area (London). Before the start of the broadcast, the 21 ex-Miss Worlds present were introduced for the audience in the Dome. The event, produced by Lisa Chapman and directed by INITIAL’s Gavin Taylor, began at 8pm (local time) with broadcast to the world thanks to GEM. In the United Kingdom it was broadcast on Channel 5 as in the previous two years, in Venezuela it was broadcast live on Venevisión at 4 in the afternoon and on the Asian continent thanks to ZEE TV, the Indian channel that was the official sponsor of Miss World 2000. However, the contest was not seen in the US. The opening was made by the English singer Bryan Ferry with the song “Let’s Stick Together” accompanied by the 95 candidates, all dressed in similar gala dresses, on a golden pallet, with large shawls and most of them with headdresses. The gowns were created by the Indian designer Hemant Trivedi thanks to Sheetal Design Studio, who was also one of the members of the judges. The girls did a choreography directed by Ken Warwick on the big round-shaped stage, which simulated a globe.\n\nThen the English-born American entertainer Jerry Springer officially welcomed the contest. His partner in conducting the pageant was former Mexican beauty queen Rebecca de Alba (who was Ricky Martin’s girlfriend before he came out of the closet). Springer presented a video with images from past Miss World pageants in celebration of the pageant’s 50th anniversary, as well as a small tribute to the recently deceased Eric Morley. Springer then proceeded to introduce the judges, with whom he spoke briefly. They were:\n\n01.- Chairwoman of Miss World and the Judges, Julia Morley.\n\n02.- The famous Indian fashion designer, Hemant Trivedi.\n\n03.- Renowned English film, stage and television actress, Stephanie Beecham.\n\n04.- The British fashion designer of Ghanaian origin, Ozwald Boateng.\n\n05.- Scottish singer Lulu Kennedy-Cairns.\n\n06.- El fotógrafo británico y jurado por tercer año consecutivo, Terry O’Neill.\n\n07.- The fashion editor for the American magazine Marie Claire, Lucy Sykes.\n\n08.- The British singer of Jamaican origin, Errol Brown.\n\n09.- And the British fashion designer, Amanda Wakeley.\n\nNext, Springer presented a video of the natural wonders of the Maldives Islands and the arrival of the contestants to that Islamic country. Soon it was time to meet the candidates at their self-presentation on the beaches of Maldives, in their swimsuits. As mentioned above, the girls had been divided into eight groups. The first group appeared from the Filitheyo Resort, in Faafu Atoll. They were the representatives of Uruguay, Bahamas, Argentina, Italy, American Virgin Islands, Brazil, Australia, Bulgaria, Angola, Aruba, Portugal and Austria. And, as had already been done in the two previous contests, the candidates of the group presented then paraded on stage with their evening dresses, not precisely in the same order in which they were shown in the video from the Maldives, with comments on ‘off ‘by Mitch Johnson. For her part, Rebecca de Alba interviewed some of the young women from the ‘backstage’. The second group, comprised of girls from Belgium, Russia, the British Virgin Islands, Moldova, the Czech Republic, Barbados, France, Bangladesh, Norway, Nepal, Kazakhstan and Belarus, performed from the Hilton Rangali in Ari Atoll.\n\nAfter the first commercial break, the third group of ladies appeared from the Full Moon Resort, Paradise & Bandos, North Male Atoll. They were from the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Botswana, Costa Rica, Curaçao, Germany, Estonia, Ghana, Bolivia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and Holland. The fourth group of beauties was made up of the Misses of Tanzania, Denmark, Singapore, Philippines, Hong Kong, Kenya, Namibia, Turkey, Finland, Chinese Taipei, England and Tahiti from the island of Ihuru, in North Male. Coco Palm, in Baa Atoll received the fifth group of entrants. They were the participants from Switzerland, New Zealand, Canada, Korea, Ireland, Wales, Malaysia, Malta, Israel, Sweden, Japan and Iceland. Then Springer and de Alba presented a video where hairdressers and makeup artists were interviewed, as well as the designer of the opening costumes, Hemant Trivedi, before the second commercial break.\n\nUpon return, he introduced to the sixth group of girls from Nika, Ari Atoll. They were the Misses of India, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Slovakia, Trinidad-Tobago, Scotland, Zimbabwe, Northern Ireland, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Paraguay and Slovenia. The seventh and penultimate group was presented from Kuredu, in the Lhaviyani Atoll with the candidates from Poland, Romania, Greece, Mexico, Cyprus, Colombia, Guatemala, Hungary, Gibraltar, Lithuania, Chile and Ecuador. And to conclude, the last group was made up of the contestants from South Africa, Peru, Lebanon, Madagascar, Honduras, USA, Panama, Spain, Ukraine, Yugoslavia and Venezuela from Vilu Reef in Dhaalu Atoll. While all the participants returned to the stage to know the name of the winner of the award for Best Evening Dress, Rebecca de Alba interviewed the former Miss Worlds of 1952, 1966 and 1982, leaving Gina Tolleson, Miss World 1990, with the word of mouth … Here is the list of designers:\n\nThen it was time to meet the winner of the BEST EVENING WEAR, so Springer called the British actress Stephanie Beecham to the stage who announced that the privileged one was Miss KAZAKHSTAN (Margarita Kravtsova), who wore a simple strapless silk dress red color, with a gathered at the bottom of the gown. Kravtsova received a small trophy from Springer. After the commercial break, Springer and de Alba released the list of the 10 semifinalists. They were Miss ITALY, Miss CHILE, Miss COLOMBIA, Miss UNITED STATES, Miss URUGUAY, Miss KAZAKHSTAN, Miss TURKEY, Miss UKRAINE, Miss INDIA and Miss KENYA. This was followed by a video with images of the charity auction that was made for the Variety Club thanks to “Beauty with a Purpose” and the progress of this project with words of Julia Morley.\n\nJerry Springer proceeded to interview the semifinalists on white sofas that they set up on stage. As he called out to them, with comments from Mitch Johnson, they left the far right of the stage and retreated to the left side. Springer asked each girl three questions (with the exception of Miss Uruguay to whom he asked only two), one casual, another about her country and another sent by the public online. Miss Chile, Miss Kazakhstan, Miss Turkey, Miss Ukraine and Miss Italy requested translators, although the Italian and the Ukrainian did not use their interpreters. Springer interviewed the first five and after returning from commercials he chatted with the remaining semifinalists. Springer made some jokes while interviewing the young women, such as when he asked Miss Turkey what she ate on Thanksgiving Day, but Miss Ukraine also knew how to make jokes and when Springer asked to the 17-year-old girl what she would do in 10 years, she replied that in 10 years she would be 27… And Springer replied that he was the one who made the jokes there !!\n\nAt the conclusion of the interviews, a video recap of the ten semi-finalists in the Maldives was presented. After the commercial break, the female musical group “Bond” was introduced, a quartet made up of Tania Davis, Eos Counsell, Elspeth Hanson and Gay-Yee Westerhoff interpreting the song “Victory” to the sound of violins and cellos, while once again the ten semifinalists paraded in their ball gowns. Then it was time to reveal the names of the five finalists by Springer. They were Miss KAZAKHSTAN, Miss ITALY, Miss URUGUAY, Miss INDIA and Miss TURKEY. Each of them would be asked a question from her fellow contestants.\n\nMiss Kazakhstan, who used her int"
