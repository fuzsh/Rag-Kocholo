Individual contributors to the current issue bring a variety of disciplinary perspectives to bear on matters as far rang- ing as the material commemoration of Congregational ministers in early New England and the work of a folk gravestone maker in contemporary Mississippi. In these, as well as its other essays, Markers XIV continues its efforts to provide its readers with the best and most current examples of the type of broad-based and balanced examination of gravemarkers, their makers, and the places where they are found which define this special- ized area of folk art and material culture. Finally, in its ongoing efforts to iv establish the standards and outline the boundaries of this important and emergent microdiscipline, the current issue offers a greatly expanded ver- sion of its annual bibliographic survey, \"The Year's Work in Grave- marker /Cemetery Studies.\" Any scholarly publication's merits are determined largely by the qual- ity of its manuscript submissions and the subsequent efforts of its editor- ial review board, and in both these regards my work as editor has once again been greatly aided by the high standards and conscientiousness dis- played by contributors and members of the editorial board. I thank them all, and hope that readers with scholarly projects in mind will consider submitting their best work for publication consideration in future issues of Markers. Others deserve thanks as well, in particular Western Oregon State College, which, through such efforts as the release time provided to the editor by its Faculty Development Committee, continues to generously support this publication in a variety of manners; staff members - most especially Fred Kennedy - at Lynx Communication Group, Salem, Oregon, and Patti Stephens of Philomath, Oregon, all of whom, through their design and production skills, make my job a lot easier and this vol- ume a lot more handsome; the officers, board members, staff, and gener- al membership of the Association for Gravestone Studies, who make it all possible in the first place; and, finally, Lotte Larsen, my inspiration, my conscience, my best friend, alongside whom, in the words of poet Wilfred Owen, I go on \"quietly shining in her quiet light.\" Articles published in Markers are indexed in America: History and Life, Historical Abstracts, and the MLA International Bibliography.

R.EM American Indian Identity Fig. 1. Bronze bust of T.C. Cannon, Kiowa/Caddo Indian painter and poet, at the National Hall of Fame for Famous American Indians, Anadarko, Oklahoma. VI CEMETERY SYMBOLS AND CONTEXTS OF AMERICAN INDIAN IDENTITY: THE GRAVE OF PAINTER AND POET T.C. CANNON David M. Gradwohl Introduction A bronze image of T.C. Cannon (Kiowa /Caddo) stands among other sculptures at the National Hall of Fame for Famous American Indians in Anadarko, Oklahoma (Fig. I).1 Among the forty Native Americans presently included in this Hall of Fame, located some fifty miles south- west of Oklahoma City, are such historical Indian luminaries as Sitting Bull (Sioux), Will Rogers (Cherokee), Sacajawea (Shoshoni), Sequoyah (Cherokee), Cochise and Geronimo (Chiricahua Apache), Jim Thorpe and Black Hawk (Sac and Fox), Chief Joseph (Nez Perce), Charles Curtis (Kaw), Oceola (Seminole), Tecumseh (Shawnee), Pontiac (Ottawa), and Pocahontas (Powhatan). Honored for his achievements in twentieth-cen- tury art, the late T.C. Cannon is among the youngest individuals selected for the Indian Hall of Fame. His memorial plaque and the associated lit- erature distributed by the Hall of Fame note that Cannon is buried in Anadarko' s Memory Lane Cemetery. Sources indicate that he was laid to rest with full American military and traditional Kiowa honors. T.C. Cannon's gravestone (Fig. 2) reflects the ethnic and historical identity of one Native American; however, this case study has implica- tions for the understanding of ethnicity in general and Native American ethnic identity in particular. In an attempt to interpret this specific tangi- ble representation of T.C. Cannon's identity, it is necessary to consider the symbols of certain immediate and broader mortuary contexts: additional gravestones in the Memory Lane Cemetery, and various general burial patterns of American Indians across time and space. To achieve these goals, this essay first outlines the life of T.C. Cannon and his accomplish- ments. Second, it reviews selected burial patterns in native North America to demonstrate some of the many different modes in which American Indians have materially expressed their identities across several thousand years. The third portion of this discussion deals with some general pat- terns and exemplary gravestones of non-Indians in the Memory Lane Cemetery. Fourth, there is a focus on the symbols associated with American Indians who are buried at Memory Lane. The fifth, and final, analytical section centers on the mortuary monuments of T.C. Cannon American Indian Identity and his parents. In conjunction with parallel studies I am conducting on the gravestones of American Jews and Lativian-Americans,2 I conclude that the study of T.C. Cannon's gravestone and its contexts contributes to our understanding of the relationship of material culture and ethnicity. Cemeteries and gravemarkers provide an important basis for exploring the dimensions of individual and group identities through time. T.C. Cannon the Artist Tommy Wayne Cannon was born on September 27, 1946, at the Indian hospital in Lawton, Oklahoma. His mother, Mimi (\"Mamie\") Ahdunko Cannon, was of Caddo Indian ancestry, while his father, Walter Cannon, was a member of the Kiowa tribe. The Cannon family (which included older children Vernon and Joyce) lived in the vicinity of Anadarko, first at a farm near Mountain View and later at Gracemont, where Tommy com- pleted his secondary schooling. Tommy was always interested in art, and in his early teens began entering his work in art shows. He won some prizes and sold some of his paintings. As a child, Tommy was given the Fig 2. T.C. Cannon's gravestone (front side) in Memory Lane Cemetery, Anadarko, Oklahoma. David M. Gradwohl Kiowa name Pai-doung-u-day, which means \"One Who Stands in the Sun.\" This was the Indian name of Walter Cannon's deceased maternal uncle. According to Kiowa cultural protocol, Walter Cannon formally sought permission to use the name from his uncle's son, who had the hereditary right to give the name to someone else.3 This is just one of many ways in which Kiowa historical traditions and American Indian values in general were brought to bear on the young Tommy Cannon. Some years later, Cannon had this to say concerning these early traditional influences on his personal identity as an American Indian: I believe that there is such a thing as Indian sensibility. . .This has to do with the idea of a collective history. It's reflected in your upbringing and the remarks that you hear every day from birth and the kind of behavior and emotion you see around you. It's probably true of any national or racial group that's sort of inbred; in other words, where Italians marry Italians and live in an Italian community and eat Italian food you can't very easily turn out to be Chinese.4 Following graduation from high school in 1964, T.C. (as he subse- quently would be known) studied at the newly-founded Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In the words of one art historian, \"Under instructors including Allan Houser and Fritz Scholder, a new definition of Indian art evolved there, and Cannon helped author much of it\".5 A volume celebrating three decades of the Institute of American Indian Arts includes the statement that T. C. Cannon \"... is per- haps the best known of the I ALA graduates\".6 Exemplary of this period is a work which demonstrates the artist's sense of humor as well as skill. This piece, entitled \"Mama and Papa Have the Goin' Home to Shiprock Blues,\" portrays a Navajo man and woman waiting, presumably for a bus, to return to their Dineh homeland.7 The man - wearing a traditional headband, black velvet shirt, and beaded necklace - sits cross-legged and dreamily waves a cigarette in his left hand, while his wife rests solidly next to him, huddled in a red and white striped blanket and sporting large sunglasses. In 1966, Cannon was awarded the Governor's Trophy at the Scottsdale National Indian Art Exhibition. That year he also studied briefly at the Art Institute of San Francisco. In 1969, following his military service, Cannon attended the College of Santa Fe and then transferred to Central State University in Edmond, Oklahoma, where he graduated with an art major in 1972. During this period Cannon was married to (and then divorced American Indian Identity from) Barbara Warner, a Ponca Indian from Oklahoma. Maturing as an artist while at Central State University, Cannon not only learned but com- bined the idioms of the Western European and American Indian painting traditions. For example, his painting entitled \"Collector #5,\" or \"Osage With Van Gogh,\" depicts an elaborately-costumed Indian dandy seated in a wicker chair which in turn is placed on a Navajo rug.8 On the wall behind the seated figure is a perfectly-executed representation of Vincent Van Gogh's painting \"Wheatfield.\"9 Influences of Art Nouveau and the decorative style of Henri Matisse can be seen in the painting Cannon charmingly called \"Grandmother Gestating Father and the Washita River Runs Ribbon-Like\".10 In this image, an abundantly pregnant woman bounces along a meandering multicolored strip holding a bright red umbrella. In addition to calf-high beaded moccasins, a concho belt, and a floral shawl around her waist, she wears a dress with large yellow-bor- dered red polka dots. Banded dots also embellish the surrounding topog- raphy and are repeated on the painted border that frames the scene. While studying in San Francisco, T.C. Cannon enlisted in the U.S. Army and volunteered for the paratroops. He spent 1967 and 1968 in Viet Nam with the distinguished 101st Airborne Division. During this time he filled notebooks with drawings and poetry about war and his comrades in arms. The U.S. government awarded Cannon two Bronze Stars for his bravery in Viet Nam, and upon his return to Oklahoma the Kiowa induct- ed him into their elite Black Leggings Warrior Society. This modern Kiowa warrior sodality has its roots in the ranked male military societies which were prominent among the Kiowa and many other High Plains Indian cultures during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.11 In former times, members of the Kiowa's Tonkonko, or Black Leggings Society, danced with black-painted lower legs and forearms.12 They wore horse- hair roach headdresses and carried eagle tail feather fans. Their unique military emblem was a curved \"no-retreat\" staff which, when planted in battle, signified a fight to death. In 1958, the Black Leggings Warrior Society was formally re-established.13 Members of this prestigious con- temporary society must have served in the armed forces and are selected by invitation based on their high moral and ethical character. At pow- wows and Veterans' Day observances, members of the society dance in black knee socks, black buckskin leggings, or with their bare legs painted black. Much of Cannon's art deals with war and warriors. A hero of epic pro- David M. Gradwohl portions is depicted in his painting entitled \"His Hair Flows Like a River,\" in which a warrior with face paint is shown attired in a bright robe, floral scarf, bone bead choker, and wolf skin headdress.14 Cannon captured the tragedy of all wars in paintings such as \"Big Foot in the Snow,\" which shows the horrifying image of the Sioux chief's frozen body on the bat- tlefield following the Wounded Knee massacre of 1890.15 Finally, he depicted the folly and irony of war in various representations of General George Armstrong Custer, in particular the one he dubbed \"Zero Hero\".16 It is worth noting here that T.C. Cannon was among the more than 42,000 American Indian military personnel with the U.S. armed forces in southeast Asia during the Viet Nam War. Historically, American Indians have served in the national armed forces in numbers exceeding their per- centage of the general population.17 Recent estimates suggest that there are now some 160,000 American Indian veterans, representing ten percent of the living Native American population.18 American Indians are three times as likely to have served in the armed forces as other American citi- zens during the twentieth century. Approximately 25,000 American Indians served in World War II; included in this number were at least 400 Navajo \"code talkers\" who contributed greatly to the U.S. victory in the Pacific theater by using their indigenous language to baffle Japanese cryp- tographers.19 The personal problems and identity issues of American Indian veterans returning to the United States have been on-going themes in contemporary literature, for example Ceremony by Leslie Silko (Laguna Pueblo), House Made of Dawn by N. Scott Momaday (Kiowa), and From Sand Creek by Simon Ortiz (Acoma Pueblo). T.C. Cannon's art, especially when considered with his various journals and poems, reflects these cen- trifugal forces in the contemporary life of Native Americans. In a recent- ly-published American Indian encyclopedia, Arthur Silberman points to this matter in commenting that Cannon \"... identified strongly with tra- ditional values. He also used contemporary mainstream styles and made personal statements with wit, anger, and affection about the dilemmas and paradoxes of maintaining a sense of Native American Identity.\"20 During 1973 Cannon served as an artist-in-residence at Colorado State University; in 1975 he was a visiting artist at Dartmouth College. In the late 1970s, Cannon received a number of large commissions. The Santa Fe Opera Company engaged him to create paintings to advertise their 1977 and 1978 seasons. The painting for the poster and program cover for the 1978 opera season, entitled \"A Remembered Muse (Tosca)\", juxtaposes a American Indian Identity number of Euro-American and American Indian symbols.21 Behind the two American Indian figures dressed in elaborate traditional garb is an American flag banner with the images of the martyred John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy. The painting is at the same time puzzling, provoca- tive, and poignant. A larger-scale endeavor, completed in 1977, was a huge mural, eight feet high by twenty-two feet long, for the Daybreak Star Indian Cultural Educational Center in Seattle. The title of the mural is \"Epochs in Plains History: Mother Earth, Father Sun, the Children Themselves.\" Among the mural's figures are representations of the moon, a group of Old People from the primordial world, Mother Earth, an owl, a sacred eagle, a herd of bison, an equestrian warrior, the fabled White Buffalo, a skewered Sun Dancer, a shield-like sun, tipis, and a Peyote Man seated near some peyote buttons and a crescent-shaped altar. Moving off the right side of the image is a Gourd Dancer in blue jeans, a brightly pat- terned shirt, blanket, western hat, and \"shades.\" In the center of the mural are T.C. Cannon's hand prints in red and yellow P- Whether or not some of the symbolism in the above-mentioned paint- ings is prescient of the artist's tragically early death can be debated. Nonetheless, T.C. Cannon was killed in a one-car accident near his home in Santa Fe on May 8, 1978. Although only thirty-one years old, Cannon had garnered many honors and was known not only throughout the United States but in Europe as well. In 1972, while he was still an under- graduate student, he was featured with Fritz Scholder in an exhibition entitled \"Two American Painters,\" mounted by the Smithsonian's National Collection of Fine Arts. This two-man show toured Berlin, Belgrade, Skopje, Istanbul, Madrid, and London. Cannon's one-man shows included exhibitions at the Southern Plains Indian Museum in Anadarko (1971), Larkin Gallery in Santa Fe (1972), Pickard Galleries in Oklahoma City (1974), Beaumont-May Gallery in Hanover, New Hampshire (1975), and the Wheelwright Museum in Santa Fe (1976). In 1979, the Aberbach Gallery in New York, which had served as Cannon's agent and dealer, mounted a posthumous show entitled \"T.C. Cannon: A Memorial Exhibition.\" From New York this exhibition toured to the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe, the Heard Museum in Phoenix, and the Buffalo Bill Cody Cultural Center in Cody, Wyoming. Cannon's work was also included in more than twenty group exhibitions that not only toured the United States but Europe as well. Throughout 1990 and 1991 an extensive retrospective one-man show was exhibited by the National David M. Gradwohl Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center in Oklahoma City and the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indian and Western Art in Indianapolis. The evaluation of T.C. Cannon's skill and position in the art world is outside the scope of this essay and beyond the expertise of this author, but one historian of contemporary art puts his work in perspective with the art of others of \"the most successful Indian painters\" - Fritz Scholder, Earl Bliss, Kevin Red Star, and Grey Cohoe: Their eclectic stylistic combinations of the expressive, the decorative, and the ironic have formed an ambivalent repertoire of recognizable but dis- torted images. Thus, at least an attempt is made to transform the stereotype into the archetype by its simultaneous acceptance and negation. An analy- sis of this development in Indian art might finally demonstrate that the artistic expression of minorities within majority cultures is based on a com- mon structural principle. This principle includes (a) the combination of myth and history, (2) the attempt to purify the cliche, and (3) the search for art forms that concentrate, intensify, and generalize motifs, images, and rhythms, first in symbolic, then in ironic, and, perhaps, finally in a playful popular mode\".23 It is safe to say that T.C. Cannon's art epitomizes the above principles. Only time will tell whether his artistic contributions will have a continu- ing impact not only on American Indian art per se but contemporary art in general. Cannon was not only well aware of his blending of traditional American Indian aesthetic forms with modern Western art modes, he was also able to articulate it clearly and eloquently. In 1970 he wrote the fol- lowing in connection with the preparation of his first one-man exhibition at the Southern Plains Indian Museum in Anadarko: Contemporary Indian painting is an ever-expanding field full of infinite directions and countless rewards and dreams. In these few works, I have tried to align myself along the lines and codes of my ethnic background. I have not shut out my tradition, nor have I attempted to sacrifice or negate the traditional idiom from where I started ... I lean toward a more abstract idiom which I feel suits my situation more ideally. The contemporary Indian of today is a much more open-minded individual than ten years ago, especially the young people with their sensitive and revealing out- looks on the present day world.24 Put in this straightforward manner, Cannon's art is a paradigm of his life in general. American Indian Identity Selected Burial Patterns in Native North America During the thousands of years that they have inhabited North America, Native Americans have disposed of their dead in a variety of ways. A full discussion of these various patterns is obviously beyond the bounds of this essay. A few examples, however, will suffice to demon- strate two points. First, there is no one American Indian mortuary pattern, historically or today, but rather a number of differing modes. Second, these disparate burial practices are expressive of diverse group and indi- vidual identities. In the eastern United States, between approximately 800 BC and 800 AD, people of the archaeologically-defined Woodland Tradition cultures, including Adena, Hopewell, and others, constructed large conical burial mounds over log tombs or pit inhumations.25 Flexed inhumations in cir- cular pits, of course, had been the primary burial mode for some six thou- sand years back into the Archaic Tradition.26 In the Upper Mississippi Valley, by at least 800 A.D. certain prehistoric Indian groups were build- ing mounds in the shapes of animal effigies.27 Although these Effigy Mounds may have served more than one purpose, many of them do include disarticulated \"bundle burials.\" In the Great Plains, numerous historic tribes placed their dead on above-ground scaffolds where the eventual disarticulated bones either fell to the ground or were gathered to be deposited in sub-surface pits. In the 1830s, artist George Catlin record- ed this practice at a Mandan village: burial scaffolds can be seen outside the community of earth lodges beyond the defensive stockade.28 During the same time period, Swiss artist Karl Bodmer was hired to illustrate the western journals of traveler-scientist Prince Maximilian von Wied Neuwied. Bodmer's exquisite and detailed paintings document funeral scaffolds among the Sioux and human mortuary displays among the Mandan.29 In the American southwest other mortuary patterns obtained. Some groups in the Hohokam Tradition practiced cremation, with the burial of ashes and burned bones in sub-surface pits.30 Other groups, par- ticularly those in the Anasazi-Pueblo Tradition, often buried their dead below the floors of their stone or adobe houses, while Native Americans in western Canada and southern Alaska build separate \"spirit houses\" in which the dead are buried.31 To differing degrees today, many southwestern Indian groups have been converted to Christianity. This is certainly apparent at the cemetery of Taos Pueblo in northern New Mexico, where visitors are, for good rea- David M. Gradwohl sons, not allowed within the burial grounds. Still, from outside the peripheral wall, one can observe among the crosses several probable Native American carry-overs in the form of bird motifs painted on grave- markers and several mortuary offerings of beads (not rosaries). The Tohono O'odham or Papago have long been missionized at San Xavier del Bac in Tucson, Arizona. The adjoining cemetery has many characteristics of Hispanic Catholic cemeteries elsewhere and is abundantly decorated with mass-produced artificial floral bouquets and other mortuary orna- ments. Within that melange, however, can be seen offerings of jewelry and food which may represent traditional Indian mortuary patterns. Similar multi-cultural practices have been reported for the Zuni and Navajo.32 Similar processes also exist in the Inuit (Eskimo) native cemetery at Nome, Alaska. Particularly striking is the white painted wooden cross gravemarker of Aloysius Pikonganna, to which has been attached a stone amulet. The horizontal crossbar exhibits a black silhouette-like drawing rendered in an Arctic art style which goes back at least several centuries in engraved ivory.33 The scene depicts boats, the hunting of a bird, walrus, and seal, along with dancers and a drummer with a tambourine. Finally, many contemporary American Indian burial practices are not open for observations from outsiders. At the Meskwaki Indian Settlement in cen- tral Iowa, for example, access to the cemetery is halted by a sign that reads \"Private Cemetery. Tours of any kind are strictly prohibited. We have no chiefs, no agents, no delegates authorized to sell our cornfields, our homes, our trees, or the bones of our dead. Signed by The People.\" General Observations on Anadarko's Public Memory Lane Cemetery As Anadarko's public cemetery, Memory Lane presented a pleasant, tidy, and well-maintained appearance when I entered it. Judging from the names and /or symbols on gravestones, I assumed that American Indian and non-Indian burials were generally intermixed rather than being placed in separate sections of the cemetery. That impression was inde- pendently verified by a maintenance worker and a monument dealer with whom I spoke during my two visits to Anadarko.34 The gravestone styles, source materials, epitaphs, and mortuary or decorative symbols here do not differ markedly from most other small town public cemeteries I have observed in the Great Plains. The changes in these forms from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth century are also essentially pre- dictable. Among the monuments erected during the last twenty years, 10 American Indian Identity however, one can observe increasing numbers of idiosyncratic symbols pertaining to occupations, favorite avocations, and other pursuits. The carved motif on the reverse side of Pat and Joan Anderson's monument, for example, records the family's participation in Oklahoma's oil boom. Similarly, carved scenes on the Francis family monument suggests that their wealth came not only from oil but also cattle. The double marker for the Vaughns has designs indicating that Shirley spent a lot of time with yarn and a crocheting needle while James was a handy-man with a ham- mer and screw driver. The monument of George Hector exhibits a chis- eled image of his personal airplane, specifically a Cessna 210-D Centurion. The epitaph on Bart Harrison's monument announces that he is \"Going Home\"; the image of a dove in flight emphasizes this message, while the likenesses of a trumpet and musical notes probably indicate the deceased's avocational or professional pursuits. Two other monuments attest to the individualistic interests of gravestone customers in addition to the vibrant virtuosity of monument dealers in central Oklahoma. One of these, the stone for Bill and Virginia Tallent, bears an epitaph pro- claiming \"What beautiful memories we have\" along with a complex chis- eled and /or laser-cut scene that includes large hills, trees, a barn, lots of livestock, a stream, and a family of six enjoying a plentiful picnic on a blanket next to their automobile, a Lincoln Mark IV coupe with optional sun roof and Continental rear end kits. The other, a recent pyramidal col- umn monument for Virgil O. Williams, recalls the taller obelisk form pop- ular seven to eleven decades ago. This column, however, has three cast bronze geese departing from its apex; and within its granite shaft is a glass-fronted niche that affords a view of a large porcelain or metal-lidded pitcher decorated with German inscriptions and folk figures. Gravestones of American Indians at Memory Lane Cemetery Gravestones of American Indians buried at Memory Lane Cemetery follow the characteristics outlined above for the monuments of non- Indians. Many gravestones include general floral designs or Christian symbols. Their association with American Indians lies solely with identi- fiable family names: examples include the monuments of Noah and Viola Spotted Horsechief (Fig. 3), Alexandra and Bertha Curley Chief, Lois J. Snake Blackwolf, Stephanie Buffalohead, and Jerry Scott Spotted Horse. Other monuments, though displaying no overt symbols of Native American identity, exhibit names of families from which prominent David M. Gradwohl 11 Indian personalities have come. Mammedaty, for example, was the tradi- tional name of the paternal grandfather of N. Scott Momaday, the Kiowa Pulitzer prize- winning novelist and poet.35 Nevaquaya is the family name of well-known Comanche painter and flute player Doc Tate Nevaquaya.36 The name Ahpetone (or Ahpeatone) appears on two small pyramidal columns dating from the early twentieth century as well as an adjacent contemporary large horizontal monument. \"Apeahtone\" was the last fed- erally-recognized chief of the Kiowa Tribe; a statue in his honor is sched- uled for dedication at the Indian Hall of Fame during the summer of 1996. The monument of Frank Kodaseet exhibits an image of Christ with the Sacred Heart and a symbol for the Knights of Columbus (Fig. 4). Also included on this monument is Frank Kodaseet's Indian name, Taime-Day. Interestingly enough in terms of traditional beliefs, the word Tai-me refers to the most sacred single image or fetish in the Kiowa Indian religion. Tai- Fig. 3. Monument of Noah and Viola Spotted Horsechief. The family name is the only specific indication of American Indian identity. The praying hands and open book or Bible motifs are general Christian symbols found on a number of American Indian and non-Indian gravestones in Anadarko and elsewhere. 12 American Indian Identity me was the central figure of the Kiowa's K'ado, or Sun Dance, ceremony.37 Gravestones of other Native Americans are revealed by the employment of their Indian names, most often rendered in a hyphenated translitera- tion into English. For example, one may note the monument for A-On- Hote-Baw and Ke-He-Gould-Da Keah-Tigh (Fig. 5). The gravestone's other side identifies these people as Margaret Jane and KM. Keah-Tigh (presumably the additional rendering of their nicknames as \"Mom-O\" and \"Pop-O\" is an extension of the hyphenation principle!). The beveled column monument of Zos-Sah-Ane, who died in 1903, suggests that this individual was known by a traditional single name rather than by \"first\" and \"family\" names. Zos-Sah-Ane' s gravestone style, epitaph (\"Gone But Not Forgotten\"), and Christian mortuary symbols (crown of glory, stars, mansions in the sky, and gates of heaven) are typical \"stock\" forms found \"*>»LiV. m TA1ME DAY FRANK KODASLh. ^gks£*far?fa jmIPRt* Wr^^ Fig. 4.

Gradwohl 13 in turn-of-the-century cemeteries in the American midlands. Finally, one observes Tsait-Kope-Ta's monument, which is topped by a large sculpted angel pointing heavenward. Although such sculpted angels are a com- mon Victorian form elsewhere, this monument is strikingly unique in Anadarko, Oklahoma. The American Indian identities represented on numerous other grave- stones in Memory Lane Cemetery are considerably more obvious. For example, the monument of Lilly Catherine Botone Kodaseet (a.k.a. Ahkee'n Tih'n, or \"White Rower\") specifies her as a \"Kiowa Prayer Woman\" and further signifies her Indian identity by a tipi motif (Fig. 6). Another monument identifies Frank Waldon Jones as a member of the Fig. 5.

An oval porcelain photograph of Hoag in traditional garb further emphasizes his American Indian identi- ty. The small, wedge-shaped monument of Perry Arthur Keah-Tigh \"Woman Heart\" exhibits an inscription identifying him as an \"Educational Indian song dance lecturer / A true credit to his father's people.\" Other than the family name, there is no symbol of Indian identi- ty on the front of Lois and Stacy Pahdopony's monument; cut and paint- ed portraits on the back of the gravestone, however, show Lois Tooahimpah Pahdopony's hair parted and braided in a traditional fash- ion. On one side of the Newkumet family monument is an engraved feather (Fig. 8). On the other side of the monument, and also on the indi- vidual markers for Vynola Beaver Newkumet and Phil J. Newkumet, is a Fig. 6. Monument of Lilly Catharine Botone Kodaseet. Her American Indian identity is revealed in three ways: her traditional name, Ahkee'n Tih'n, or White Flower; a tipi motif; and an inscription that identifies her as a \"Kiowa Prayer Woman\".

This emblem may represent the Sacred Fire or the New Fire ceremonies known throughout the Native American southeast.38 Indian symbols in the form of a feather headdress, arrow, quirt, and trade bugle embellish the double marker of Clarence (Set'-Tain-Te) and Maggie Sankadota. The front side of the double monu- ment for Michelle A. Yackeyonny (almost 29 years old) and Dominic A. Reyna (8 years old) is decorated with Christian symbols including the praying hands motif and books (presumably the Bible or the Book of Life). On the reverse side, however, are two traditional feather dance or prayer fans. Dominic's epitaph reads \"My canoe is small, the ocean wide / May the Great Spirit be my Guide\" (Fig. 10). For Michelle - on her portion of the monument - there are the words \"It's so hard to say 'goodbye' to yes- terday.\" The cultural metaphors are additionally mixed, however, as Fig. 7. Enoch Hoag's gravestone, which specifies him as \"The Last Chief of the Caddo Tribe / Grandson of Chief Jose Maria\". His American Indian identity is further expressed by the traditional clothing and hair style in his photograph on the monument. 16 American Indian Identity Dominic is depicted playing soccer and his ephemeral grave offerings include toy cars, dinosaurs, and various commando and soldier dolls. The front of Leonard and Eve Silverhorn's monument exhibits no Indian sym- bols; but on the reverse side one observes the chiseled image of a wood- en flute, perhaps the courting flute employed by most Plains Indian tribes (Fig. 11). The double monument for Bessie Hunter Snake and Willie Snake has separate symbols for these two individuals. Bessie is commemorated by the image of a turtle; Willie by two dominoes. The meanings of these symbols are not immediately clear. The turtle could represent a clan or family totem, the \"turtle island\" of myths, or even a zoomorphic marker for the Indian dice game. While dominoes did not originate in American Indian tradition, Native Americans had a large array of games of chance and gambling.39 Bingo halls and casinos are modern institutions, but gam- bling had independent roots among the first inhabitants of North America. More obvious, and in many ways more unique among the American Indian symbols observed at the Memory Lane Cemetery, are motifs which represent the Native American Church. This religious organization syn- Fig. 8 Newkumet family monument (back side) showing feather motif, a sacred symbol in many American Indian religions. David M. Gradwohl 17 cretizes rituals of the traditional Peyote Cult and Christianity.40 The Native American Church was incorporated in Oklahoma in 1918 and there are still many practitioners there today. Adherents of this religion ritually ingest buttons of the spineless peyote cactus (Lophophora william- sii) as a sacrament and a curative medicine. In this context peyote is non- habit forming but produces visual, temporal, and other sensory sensa- tions which are an ingredient of the ceremonies of the church.41 The mon- ument of Mable Mahseet Weryavah identifies her as a member of the Native American Church (Fig. 12). Here we see the symbol of the tipi (in EL- r if'ii ^^^ii vi ■ -1 • * *\"\"-• •' n ■M jji 1 Newkumet I gin | Fig. 9. Newkumet family monument (front side) showing a fire and rising smoke motif.

Peyote rattles are typically decorated with bright beads and horsehair. One small gourd rat- tle in the collections of the Nebraska State Historical Society exemplifies the combination of Peyote Cult iconography (tipi, star, cactus plant, sun /peyote button, and crescent moon /altar) with Christian symbols (cross, prayer words) in the Native American Church. Another Native American Church member buried at Memory Lane Cemetery, identified by the tipi and aquatic spirit bird symbol, is Thomas Hugh Eckiwaudah. The double monument of N. Hazel Palmer and Earl Palmer, Sr. has no American Indian symbols on its front side; but the reverse side exhibits the symbol of a peyote tipi. Paul Kenyon Littlechief's monument promi- nently displays the aquatic spirit bird icon of the Native American Church Fig. 10. Detail of double monument for Dominic A. Reyna and Michelle A. Yackeyonny. In particular, note the engraved image of a traditional feather dance or prayer fan. David M. Gradwohl 19 (Fig. 13). The accompanying inscription, \"He had the heart of an eagle,\" refers to another bird that has much broader meanings in traditional American Indian religions. Eagle tail feather dance or prayer fans and individual feathers, for example, have a number of symbolic connotations to Native Americans. Since eagles soar high in the skies, they are wit- nesses to everything around them. In the words of Jordan Paper, \"Eagle has varying symbolic functions that differ from culture to culture, but in all cases is a major spirit. Eagle may represent Sun or West Wind. Eagle also represents the sending of our messages to the spirits.\"43 Finally, in regard to symbols of the Native American Church, we may observe the monument of Tom Little Chief. A close inspection of the oval porcelain photograph affixed to his gravemarker reveals his association with the peyote religion (Fig. 14). He is wearing a tie tack in the form of a \"sun- burst,\" which, it is said, \"symbolizes the peyote button dispersing its benevolent rays to all humanity\".44 Little Chief's portrait also shows him garbed in a beaded bandolier with a sunburst medallion and attached aquatic spirit bird pendant. / iJfri*JT: Fig. 11.

A rectangular horizontal block marks the grave of Mimi Cannon, who was born in 1913 and died in 1989, and the future resting place for Walter Cannon, who was born in 1911 and is still living (Fig. 15). Portraits of T.C. Cannon's parents have been cut into and paint- ed upon the front surface of the stone. Their marriage date in 1942 appears below their images. An inscription on the back of the monument records the fact that Walter and \"Mamie\" Cannon are the parents of Vernon, Tommy \"Tee Cee,\" and Joyce (Fig. 16). The elder Cannons' tribal affilia- tions, respectively Kiowa and Caddo, are cut into the stone (Fig. 17). In addition there are two round Plains shield-like symbols. One (adjacent to the word \"Kiowa\") depicts an Indian man, presumably a warrior, riding a horse and carrying a shield and possibly a bow. The other (adjacent to the word \"Caddo\") shows a leaf and two small circles. The iconographic asso- Z\\i% GRANCMA MAK1 MAHSEET WERYAVAf ( PEAKNEX) 1884 ~ J973 FORGET ME NOT ■:'.;i*m Fig. 12.

Gradwohl 21 ciations of these motifs are not clear. They could represent family crests, clan, or tribal symbols, but, if so, they appear to be idiosyncratic. Finally, we reach the monument of T.C. Cannon, which has a smooth- ly-cut, rectilinear-shaped form of a cross along one edge while the oppos- ing border is irregularly curvilinear and roughly hewn (Fig. 2). This gravestone form may well be the shape of a \"stock\" item available at the monument dealer engaged by the Cannon family; the company name \"Bill Willis, Granite, Ok.\" is engraved at the lower right hand side of the front of the monument. On the other hand, one could speculate that these opposing borders are a formal metaphor for the contrasting and complex dimensions of T.C. Cannon. From one viewpoint - that of his paintings, poetry, music, reading interests, and general intellect - Cannon comes off as very polished and sophisticated. From the opposite perspective - Cannon's simple tastes, modest lifestyle, and to-some-extent shy person- ality - he appears to be more simple and uneven. In words written in Fig. 13.

In addition to a feather and traditional braided hair style, his photograph shows symbols of the Native American Church: a peyote button or sunburst tie tack, and a bandolier with a sunburst medallion and attached aquatic spirit bird pendant. David M. Gradwohl 23 1973, Cannon portrayed himself as the latter: \"I am not sophisticated. I am not a man of letters ... I am nothing but a young man ... I have learned to accept myself as nothing more and nothing less\".45 The prominent sym- bol of the cross on T.C. Cannon's monument is also somewhat enigmatic. Cannon's former wife, Barbara Warner Cannon Ross, has stated that \"On all the applications at school which listed what religion you were, he always put 'universalist.' ... I think he had strong religious feelings, but they weren't structured in the church or anything like that\".46 A statement by Sherman Chaddlesone, Cannon's close Kiowa friend, is even more emphatic: \"T.C. wasn't a member of the Native American Church, and he didn't go to Christian churches either. He despised organized religion\".47 His most recent biographer, Joan Frederick, commented that \"T.C. did not belong to an organized church, but was a deeply religious person. His upbringing combined a belief in the mystical Indian religion of his ances- tors with basic Christian tenets\".48 The observations of Elizabeth Dear, whom Frederick identifies as \"T.C.'s best female friend in Santa Fe during Fig. 15. Front side of monument of Walter and Mimi (Mamie) Cannon, parents of T.C. Cannon. 24 American Indian Identity the last two years of his life,\" suggest that Cannon had even broader and more eclectic leanings: \"He considered himself a religious person and was deeply interested and involved in his traditional Indian beliefs, along with several other religions, including Judaism. This fascination led him to read as much as he could about it ...\"49 These statements are interest- ing in terms of the fact that T.C. Cannon normally wore a silver Star of David on a leather thong. That Star of David was recovered along with Cannon's body from the wreckage of his truck on May 7, 1978.50 Cut into and painted on the front surface of this gravestone is a hand- some and rather detailed portrait of T.C. Cannon - a proper memorial to a man who produced many self-portraits during his career. He is repre- sented informally by the name \"Tee Cee\" and formally as \"Tommy Wayne Cannon.\" An inscription records the fact that he is the \"Son of Walter and Mamie Cannon, Brother of Vernon and Joyce.\" This kinship reference, when taken together with the inscription on his parents' monument, iden- tifies T.C. Cannon as an American Indian of Kiowa and Caddo tribal affil- Fig. 16. Back side of the elder Cannon's monument listing the names of their children (Vernon, Joyce, and Tommy \"Tee Cee\"). David M. Gradwohl 25 iation. His dates of birth and death are noted: Sept. 27, 1946 and May 8, 1978. In between those two dates is carved the logo of the 101st Airborne Division in which Cannon served in Viet Nam (Fig. 18). The logo incor- porates the image of an eagle upon a shield. Recently I was informed that members of this elite American combat unit are known as the \"Screaming Eagles.\"51 Not only is the eagle a totemic avian symbol of the United States but, as alluded to previously, \"Eagle is the winged spirit of the day sky, of the Sun\" in most American Indian religions.52 Among Cannon's paintings is one entitled \"On Drinking Beer in Viet Nam in 1967.\"53 This painting captures Cannon enjoying a brief interlude from war with his close friend, Kirby Feathers, a Ponca Indian from Oklahoma.54 In the painting both men are wearing military uniforms, and the artist went to some little effort to clearly include the 101st Airborne' s logo shoulder patch. Cannon shows his hair as below shoulder length while his buddy Fig. 17. Detail of the back side of the elder Cannon's monument showing two round Plains shield-like symbols and the American Indian tribal affiliations of Walter Cannon (Kiowa) and Mamie Cannon (Caddo). 26 American Indian Identity is depicted as sporting traditional braids - neither of which, I suspect, would have been expedient or tolerated in the U.S. military. Both men are wearing feathers in their hair. Quite evidently these are two American sol- diers; more obviously they are two American Indian warriors. For these reasons my hunch is that the shield and eagle on T.C. Cannon's grave- stone may have at least two sets of meanings, as they do in his painting from Viet Nam. Cannon was an American military hero with two Bronze Stars and a member of an elite combat unit with a proud and distin- guished history; he was also Pai-doung-u-day, a member of the Kiowa Black Leggings Warrior Society. The back of T.C. Cannon's monument also presents some food for thought (Fig. 19). The overall design shows a palette with paint, a con- tainer of brushes, and an artist's easel holding a rectangular form, sug- gesting a stretched canvas, upon which is written a poem (for T.C. f 1 X M. X ■ 1 Fig. 18. Detail of the front side of T.C. Cannon's gravestone showing the logo of the 101st Airborne Division, the military unit in which Cannon served in Viet Nam. The eagle and shield symbols probably have additional meanings in terms of American Indian religious iconography. David M. Gradwohl 27 Cannon was a writer of poetry and music too). The easel and other images convey the idea that Cannon was a contemporary painter. The poem is entitled \"Remember Me Blues\" and is written in Cannon's individualistic manner: When the bright lights of the morning Have faded from the land And the ghosts of countless friendships Have all shifted with the sand And the chimes of farewell's melody Blows outward to the sea I'll be standing here r'memberin Hopin you r'member me. The poem is signed \"T. Cee, Artist - Composer - Poet.\" The verse is cer- tainly poignant, but I must confess that I can find no absolutely certain ' I BLUtS «K'> •- « Fig. 19. Back side of T.C.

The first time I viewed the monument I was so busy trying to comprehend its overall design and so engrossed in reading the poem that I almost overlooked the small but important icon identifying T.C. Cannon's Native American links which is situated in the lower left corner of the framed poem on the easel (Figs. 19 and 20). It consists of the representations of three ceramic vessels deco- rated in the bichrome and polychrome styles in which pots have been painted in the American southwest by Anasazi-Pueblo Tradition artists for nearly two thousand years. It is this long tradition of conceptualizing forms and painting designs which must have stirred in T.C. Cannon as a child and carried him into his stellar career as a leading definer and expo- nent of contemporary American Indian art. 4 q p vn , TV * \\ Fig. 20. Detail of the back side of T.C. Cannon's gravestone showing three small ceramic vessels painted in the style of Anasazi-Pueblo artists in the American Southwest for nearly two thousand years. These small images are important symbols of Cannon's prowess as a painter and his connections to the long-standing traditions of painting among American Indians. David M. Gradwohl 29 Conclusions This study has shown that there are some demonstrable relationships between material culture and ethnicity. In this case we have seen many gravemarkers that express both individual and group ethnic identities of American Indians on the contemporary scene and back through time. The data presented in this essay illustrate several points. First, over the course of North American prehistory and history, American Indians have employed a number of different and distinctive burial practices. Second, some of these kinds of variations exist today among Native Americans despite Euro-American attempts at forced assimilation and religious mis- sionization. Third, a number of specific mortuary symbols are expressive of American Indian identities in the Memory Lane Cemetery in Anadarko, Oklahoma. These ethnic indicators include particularistic names, hyphenated format of transliterating names into English, epi- graphic indications of tribal affiliation, references to political and religious roles, photographs portraying traditional hair and clothing styles, and design motifs such as a feathered headdress, individual feathers, dance or prayer fans, fire and smoke, a flute, an arrow, and zoomorphic forms. The cemetery exhibits a notable degree of individuality and virtuosity in the modern gravestones of both American Indians and non-Indians. Particularly distinctive is the iconography of the Native American Church as expressed on mortuary monuments. Key symbols here include the cer- emonial tipi, Peyote rattle, aquatic spirit bird, sunburst or Peyote button symbol, and portrayals of \"Peyote jewelry\" in photographs attached to the gravestones. Fourth, the gravestones of artist T.C. Cannon and his par- ents specifically exhibit symbols of American Indian identification. It is significant, I think, that all three are represented by gravestone portraits. The tribal affiliations of Walter and Mamie Cannon are indicated and there are shield-like motifs which may be further material expressions of their particularistic identity. T.C. Cannon's monument includes a military emblem with a shield and an eagle - insignias with probable bicultural meanings. From documented records we know that Cannon was laid to rest with both U.S. military and traditional Kiowa honors. Furthermore Cannon's link to the heritage of American Indian art, particularly paint- ing, is represented by the symbol of three painted Puebloan pots on his gravestone. In an interview in 1975, T.C. Cannon reflected on this linkage: \"From the poisons and passions of technology arises a great force with which we must deal as present-day painters. We are not prophets - we are 30 American Indian Identity merely potters, painters, and sculptors dealing with and living in the later twentieth century\".55 These words are characteristically modest for a man of T.C. Cannon's stature. By the same token, the diminutive images of painted pots on Cannon's gravestone are significant but understated sym- bols for the man upon whom was bestowed the honored Kiowa name that means \"One Who Stands in the Sun.\" NOTES I gratefully thank the following individuals for assistance in preparing this paper: Gretchen M.

Towns with markers of early Congregational ministers in northwestern Middlesex County and northern Worcester County, Massachusetts. 35 GRAVEMARKERS OF THE EARLY CONGREGATIONAL MINISTERS IN NORTH CENTRAL MASSACHUSETTS Tom and Brenda Malloy Introduction The Massachusetts Bay Colony was established in 1630 as a Puritan theocracy. Within the first year of settlement six towns were laid out. In the ensuing years the Bay Colony experienced rapid population growth to the point that it would become Britain's most populated colony in North America. Consequently, a new county was established to the west of Boston. When Middlesex County was organized in 1643, it had eight towns, and by 1700 there were twenty-two.1 The town structure was viewed as a means by which control could be maintained over a rapidly growing population and, at the same time, ensure Puritan economic and religious domination. A town could only be formed when permission was given by Massachusetts' central govern- ment, known as the General Court. When a town was incorporated, the inhabitants cleared land to be used in common, i.e., the town common, and the next step was to build a meeting house. The structure was called a meeting house because both town and church meetings were held with- in the building inasmuch as towns were also legally considered parishes. As one town historian has stated, \"A history of a New England town without an ecclesiastical chapter would surely be like the play of Hamlet with the part of Hamlet left out.\"2 The established church in Puritan Massachusetts was Congregational and, because the church was supported by the government, as late as 1800 towns could be fined for not hiring a minister. The town provided the minister's salary and other various benefits, such as land and his year's supply of cord wood. The last benefits to be bestowed were his funeral expenses and the erection of his headstone. In some cases, a minister's marker might be a well-ornamented stone that was of the style found generally, throughout his congregation's burying ground. However, because of his high status in a church-state communi- ty, the minister's grave would normally be designated by the most impressive marker in the graveyard. In most instances the marker would be a portrait stone or a table stone. Frequently, if the grave was marked by a table stone, which was considered symbolic of a tomb, it was the only 36 Early Congregational Ministers such marker in a cemetery. Portrait stones were carved not necessarily to reveal the individual's likeness, but to symbolize his position by the inclu- sion of clerical tabs. Also, if for some reason a minister's grave was not marked until some years after his death, it appears that an obelisk mark- er was normally chosen. In addition to being one of the most distinctive gravemarkers in a cemetery, a minister's marker normally contained a generous amount of documentation within the epitaph. Consequently, by using this informa- tion in conjunction with other historical sources, the role of the Congregational minister within a church-state community can be demon- strated. For the purposes of this study, this will be done through the analysis of ministers' markers in twenty-one towns of north central Massachusetts, eight of which are in the northwestern section of Middlesex County, and the remainder in northern Worcester County (see Fig. 1). Fig. 2. Reverend Samuel Whiting, 1719, Billerica. The epitaph on the Whiting stone, carved by Joseph Lamson, reveals that the Congregational clergy were provided with the genteel title of mister as well as that of reverend. Tom and Brenda Malloy 37 Stones of the Ministers Examples of three different types of ministers' stones can be found at the South Cemetery in Billerica, which was incorporated as a town in 1655. At the front of the cemetery is a stone for Samuel Whiting, the town's first pastor. Carved by Joseph Lamson, the headstone is orna- mented with a winged skull, gourds and finial faces (Fig. 2). The inscrip- tion reads: HERE LIES YE BODY OF YE REVEREND MR. SAMUEL WHITING, PASTOR OF YE CHURCH OF CHRIST IN BILLERICA, AGED 80 YEARS, DECEASED FEBRUARY YE 28 1719 Whiting, whose father was the pastor in Lynn, Massachusetts, was a 1653 graduate from the Puritan theological institution known as Harvard College. He arrived in Billerica three years after its incorporation. However, it would be two years after his ordination before the town could afford to build a meeting house. This meeting house, built for Whiting, was a thatched-roof structure with rough boards for siding, a primitive structure compared to the white-steepled churches that were eventually constructed on New England commons. Samuel Whiting preached the sermon in Billerica for fifty-six years before his retirement in. 1714, and the stone that marks his grave indicates that he died five years after his retire- ment. In near proximity to the Whiting stone is the headstone of Billerica's second minister, Samuel Ruggles (Fig. 3). Ruggles graduated from Harvard in 1702, and was teaching in Hadley, Massachusetts when, in 1708, he was selected to assist the aging Whiting. Succeeding Whiting as pastor, Ruggles served until his death in 1749, at which time the town voted 150 pounds for his funeral expenses.3 His headstone is a large por- trait stone carved by William Park which was not erected until some years after the minister's death.4 Features at the top of the stone include a por- trait with clerical tabs, an hourglass, the ubiquitous \"Memento Mori,\" and the phrase \"From deaths Arrest no age is free.\" The epitaph (on the lower portion of the stone) is inscribed in Latin. Translated, it reads in part: 38 Early Congregational Ministers Under this rock of a tomb are found the ashes of Reverend Mister Samuel Ruggles recently pastor of the Billerica church who by the course which God had given completed at AD 1749. He took to death on the 3rd day of March when he had lived about 68 yrs.5 Upon the death of Samuel Ruggles, John Chanler became the third pastor in Billerica. He was a recent Harvard graduate who had grown up in the nearby town of Andover. However, he would only serve as pastor for eleven years before being dismissed for \"indulgence in spiritual con- solations which were not from above.\"6 It was known that he kept these \"spiritual consolations\" stored in his cellar. Two years after his dismissal he died at the early age of 38. The brevity of Chanler's tenure is referred to within the epitaph of his portrait stone, which reads: HRfe , '/.v wkimiLi i^r^ s'S V'-^y \\\\ :■■■:/ Fig. 3. Reverend Samuel Ruggles, 1749, Billerica. The clerical tabs on the Ruggles portrait are typical of the neckwear worn by the Congregational clergy, and are considered symbolic of the tablets that contained The Ten Commandments. Tom and Brenda Malloy 39 Here lye the Remains of the Revd. Mr. John Chanler Some time Pastor of the Church in Billerica who departed this life November the 10th AD 1762 The Chanler stone (Fig. 4), which is located to the rear of the South Cemetery, was carved by the same artisan who cut his predecessor's stone.7 Although, it is only about one-third the size of the Ruggles stone, both markers display a very similar style of portrait. Henry Cumings was Chanler 's successor, becoming the fourth pastor in Billerica. At the age of twenty he graduated from Harvard, which later bestowed on Cumings an honorary doctorate. He has been described as a man who \"was six feet and upwards in height, finely proportioned, with silvery flowing locks and a pleasant smile.\"8 Cumings' pastorate lasted for sixty-one years until his death in 1823 at the age of eighty-four. He Fig. 4. Reverend John Chanler, 1762, Billerica. Like the Ruggles portrait, the figure on the Chanler stone has details of clerical tabs plus buttons and pleats on the coat. 40 Early Congregational Ministers would be the last minister to have his funeral expenses paid for by the town, probably because within a decade after his death church and state would be separated in Massachusetts. Cumings is buried in a family plot where a table stone, the only marker of its type in the South Cemetery, covers his grave (Fig. 5). The epitaph, which is on the surface of the stone, reads: Beneath this stone rest the remains of the Rev. Henry Cumings D.D. late Pastor of the Church and Christian Society in Billerica Born Sept. 16th 1739 ordained Jan. 26 1763 died Sept. 6th 1823 Incorporated the same year as Billerica, the town of Chelmsford bor- ders it to the west. Behind the First Parish Church is the Forefather's Fig. 5. Reverend Henry Cumings, 1823, Billerica. The Cumings table stone consists of a slate top supported by granite legs. Next to the table stone are the headstones of Cumings' daughter and three wives. Tom and Brenda Malloy 41 ** ¥ 8HA8l.SUfFfflJt.eO) THE tftl a PISKE- , j- /: - ■■ rSfif *> ->A Fig. 6. Reverend John Fiske, 1676, Chelmsford. Truncated obelisks such as the Fiske cenotaph became popular markers during the late nineteenth century. 42 Early Congregational Ministers Burying Ground, and here can be found the markers of the town's first four ministers. Because the exact site of the first minister's grave is not known, a memorial cenotaph in the form of a truncated obelisk was erect- ed by his descendants in 1899 (Fig. 6). The inscription reads: This cenotaph is erected by the Fiske Family of Chelmsford to the memory of the Rev. John Fiske First Pastor of Chelmsford who was born at South Finham Suffolk County England about the year 1601. In 1637 he came to New England In 1644 he gathered a church at Wenham Mass. and continued as its pastor until 1656 when he removed with the greater part of his church to Chelmsford where he ministered both as pastor and physician. Greatly respected and beloved until his death January 14, 1676 at the age of 76 years. The Reverend John Fiske, as his cenotaph notes, was born in England, where he was educated for the Anglican clergy. Eventually adopting Puritan theology, he fled England in 1637 in order to avoid persecution. tier ^_^j;?^-^ ^^^•3j!^^Lv\"1 ** : ; ^pfejWlWl ^>v1»0W^ \"Iv^OcV; ' ^ust^rVs rfimii. qui -filve Fig. 7. Reverend Thomas Clark, 1704, Chelmsford. In many cases the Latin epitaph on a ministers's stone was written by a surviving colleague. Tom and Brenda Malloy 43 Fiske lived in Cambridge and then in Salem before moving to Wenham, Massachusetts, where he became the first minister of that town's church. After thirteen years he accepted the pastorate at the new church in Chelmsford, where he settled with a majority of the members from the Wenham parish. John Fiske died in the twentieth year of his ministry after an infirmity that required him to be carried in a chair to church services.9 Upon Fiske's death, Thomas Clark, who was born and reared in Cambridge, became Chelmsford's second minister. Town records perti- nent to Clark reveal how members of the early Puritan ministry might be compensated. Initially, he received provisions and meat as part of his salary. In 1680 he asked the town for, and received, ten acres of land. Three years later he claimed that thirty cords of wood was insufficient to heat his house, and was granted ten additional cords. Then, in 1688, he was given a yearly cash salary increase from eighty to one hundred pounds and an allotment of corn.10 In his twenty-seventh year in Chelmsford, Thomas Clark died of a Fig. 8. Reverend Samson Stoddard, 1740, Chelmsford. The sandstone cover on Stoddard's tomb has an inscription for his wife, Elizabeth, but not for him. 44 Early Congregational Ministers fever after attending a funeral. Like the Whiting marker in Billerica, Clark's grave is graced by a winged skull stone carved by Joseph Lamson (Fig. 7). However, the top of the Clark stone also features an hourglass flanked on each side by imps carrying a burial pall. On the left, the imps are flanked by the phrase \"Memento Mori\" and on the right by the phrase \"Fugit Hora.\" Also, in comparison to the Whiting stone, the finial faces on the Clark marker are accented with clerical tabs, thus symbolizing that the stone was erected for a member of the ministry. Further, Clark's epitaph is entirely in Latin. Translated, it reads: Here to the dust are committed the remains of the Reverend Mister Thomas Clark, the distinguished pastor of the flock of Christ in Chelmsford, who, in the faith and hope of a blessed resurrection, breathed forth his soul into the bosom of Jesus the 7th of December, in the year of the Lord 1704, and the 52nd of his age.11 Just a few feet from the Clark stone is the only box tomb in the Fore- father's Burying Ground. It marks the interment site of Chelmsford's third minister, although there is no inscription to designate it as such (Fig. 8). Fig. 9. Reverend Ebenezer Bridge, 1792, Chelmsford. Whereas the portrait stones in Billerica were carved by William Park, Bridge's portrait stone was carved by William's son, Thomas Park. Tom and Brenda Malloy 45 Samson Stoddard was born in Boston in 1681 and graduated from Harvard in 1701. Five years after his graduation he was invited by a vote of a town meeting to serve as the pastor for the First Parish Church. Stoddard remained as the pastor for the next thirty-four years, during which time he won the reputation of being a plain and practical preacher. In the last three years of his ministry, Stoddard became so ill that he was unable to perform his duties, yet the town continued to pay his salary. Then, after he was found dead in his well on August 30, 1740, the town paid 132 pounds for his funeral expenses.12 Stoddard was succeeded by Ebenezer Bridge, whose portrait stone (Fig. 9) stands as a prominent marker in the town's burying ground. In addition to the portrait, with clerical tabs, the top of the stone is decorat- ed with draped urns. The inscription reads: By the Church of Christ In CHELMSFORD In Testimony of their esteem and veneration This sepulchral stone erected, to stand as a sacred memorial of their late worthy Pastor The Rev. EBENEZER BRIDGE, who after having officiated among them in the service of the Sanctuary for more than a year above half a century the strength of nature being exhausted sunk under the burden of age and joined the congregation of the dead, Oct. 1, 1792, AE 78. During his fifty-two year tenure, Bridge was considered to be an excel- lent speaker whose sermons kept the full attention of the congregation. As a person, he is described as being \"large and commanding\" while being a \"communicant friend and a pleasant companion.\"13 The first minister in the neighboring town of Westford also, like the Reverend Bridge, had a fifty-two year ministry, and his table stone is the only marker of its type in the town's East Burying Ground (Fig. 10). Originally, Westford was a western precinct of Chelmsford. In 1729, resi- dents of the precinct received a charter of incorporation from the General Court. Of course, in colonial Massachusetts the partitioning of a town also meant forming a new church. Consequently, in preparation for the parti- 46 Early Congregational Ministers tion, the Reverend Willard Hall was ordained two years prior to incorpo- ration. As was customary in those days, ministers from surrounding towns were invited to ordination ceremonies, and attending the Willard ordination was Samson Stoddard, Chelmsford's third minister.14 Under Hall's leadership the Westford congregation expanded and prospered. During his tenure 274 people were admitted to the church, 280 marriages were solemnized, and 1,535 children were baptized. However, as the Revolutionary War approached, many of the town's people became antagonized by Hall's criticism of the Colonial cause. As a result, in 1776 Hall was dismissed by a vote of both the congregation and a town meet- ing.15 Reverend Hall died three years after his dismissal, and the inscrip- tion on the surface of his table stone reads: ERECTED IN MEMORY OF THE REVEREND WILLARD HALL, FIRST PASTOR OF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST In Westford. Fig. 10. Reverend Willard Hall, 1779, Westford. Whereas the Cumings table stone in Billerica has granite legs, the Hall table stone is supported by three granite pedestals. Tom and Brenda Malloy 47 DIED MARCH 19, 1779, AGED 77 YEARS, and in the 52nd year of his Ministry. While the pale carcass tho'tless lies Among the silent graves, Some hearty friend shall drop his tear On our dry bones and say, These once were strong as mine appear, And mine must be as they. Thus shall our mouldering members teach What now our senses learn; For dust and ashes loudest preach Man's infinite concern. On the southwest border of Westford is the town of Littleton, which was incorporated in 1714. Here, in the town's First Cemetery, can be Fig. 11. Reverend Daniel Rogers, 1782, Littleton. Rogers' table stone stands in back of an obelisk that marks his family plot. At the foot of the table stone are headstones for his first two wives, Mary and Elizabeth, and for other members of his family. 48 Early Congregational Ministers found a small monument for the first minister, the Reverend Benjamin Shattuck. Shattuck was born in Watertown, Massachusetts, where he taught grammar school while attending Harvard. He was ordained in Littleton on Christmas Day, 1717, but the town's new meeting house was not completed until five years later. The assignment of pews, called \"lay- ing out the pew ground,\" in the Littleton meeting house was typical for Massachusetts towns. Those who paid the highest taxes sat at the front nearest the pulpit, with women on one side of the house and men on the other, and Black parishoners were assigned seats to the rear.16 Thirteen years into his ministry, it appears that Shattuck fell into dis- favor with his congregation, because in 1730 the town forced his retire- ment by not continuing his salary. Shattuck continued to live in Littleton, but as a person of reduced status. This is evident by the 1742 laying out of the pew ground for a new meeting house. At that time Shattuck was assigned a pew to the rear and on the women's side. Also, the present monument that marks his interment site was not erected until many years after his death.17 The inscription reads: Here sleeps until the resurrection morn THE REV. BENJAMIN SHATTUCK son of William Shattuck of Watertown the first ordained minister of Littleton Born July 30, AD 1687 Died AD 1763 AEt. 76 According to a report given in the 1894-95 \"Proceeding of the Littleton Historical Society,\" the birth date and parentage on the Shattuck monu- ment, written about seventy-five years after his death, were incorrect.18 However, the inscription quoted above does provide the correct informa- tion, indicating that the present marker is a second monument erected some time after the errors became evident. Daniel Rogers replaced Shattuck as Littleton's minister. His table stone (Fig. 11) stands as the only marker of its type in the town's First Cemetery. Tom and Brenda Malloy 49 Rogers was born in Ipswich, Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard, where his grandfather had been president. In 1731, six years after receiv- ing his degree, he was offered the pastorate in Littleton. However, he refused the first offer at a salary of 100 pounds, later accepting the posi- tion when the salary was raised to 140 pounds. The people of Littleton must have been very pleased with Rogers' acceptance because at the ordi- nation ceremony the town entertained generously, paying forty-one pounds for the expenses.19 After more than forty years in the pulpit, Rogers came into conflict with his congregation. Like the Reverend Willard Hall in neighboring Westford, Daniel Rogers did not support the Colonial cause against England as did his parishoners. This conflict came to a head on Thanksgiving Day, 1775, when, during a service, the pastor concluded a proclamation with \"God save the king.\" The congregation rose in protest and demanded a retraction, causing Rogers to flee to his house, where they called upon him to declare his position. When the pastor refused, they fired a volley into the door of his house. After this incident, as tem- pers cooled, Rogers was forgiven for his transgressions, and he remained in Littleton until his death, which occurred a year before the end of the Revolutionary War.20 Like his colleagues Willard Hall of Westford and Ebenezer Bridge of Chelmsford, Rogers' ministry lasted for fifty-two years. As with the Cumings table stone in Billerica, the Daniel Rogers table stone consists of a slate top supported by four granite legs. However, unlike any other table stones in our sampling, the surface of the Rogers marker includes epitaphs in addition to his. The first epitaph on the stone is for Rogers' third wife, who predeceased him by three years. The last epitaphs are for Rogers' son and his previous two wives. In the middle of these inscriptions can be found Rogers' own epitaph which reads: Here lies buried the body of the Revd. Mr. Daniel Rogers who died Nov. ye 22nd 1782, In the 77 year of his age and in the 52nd year of his ministry. A learned and faithful Minister is God's delight. North of Westford and Chelmsford is the town of Tyngsborough, where in the Thompson Cemetery can be found a headstone for the first 50 Early Congregational Ministers minister. Tyngsborough, originally a district of neighboring Dunstable, was not incorporated as a town until nearly a quarter of a century after the conclusion of the American Revolution. Similar to the separation of Westford from Chelmsford, a new congregation was formed in prepara- tion for the partition. Thus in 1790, a year after the district was estab- lished, Nathaniel Lawrence was ordained as the pastor of the First Parish Church.21 Nathaniel Lawrence is buried in a family plot next to his wife and two of his children. His term of office extended well beyond the date of sepa- ration of church and state in Massachusetts and well into the mid-nine- teenth century. Consequently, the tympanum of his slate stone is decorat- ed with a willow and urn, a common motif for that period (Fig. 12). The stone's epitaph provides a good documentation of Lawrence's life as well as the circumstances of his death: Fig. 12. Reverend Nathaniel Lawrence, 1843, Tyngsborough. The weeping willow on Lawrence's stone is symbolic of sadness and sorrow, while the urn symbolizes the soul and mortality. Tom and Brenda Malloy 51 In Memory of Rev Nathaniel Lawrence Who died on Lords Day Feb 5 1843 AEt 77 1/2 Mr. Lawrence was a native of Woburn Mass. He graduated at Harvard College in 1787, and on Jan. 6, 1790 was ordained Pastor of the Congregational Society in Tyngsborough, which relation continued 49 years. On the morning of Feb. 5, He attended church as usual, in apparent good health, but on returning to his dwelling, very suddenly expired. His death was that of the righteous; and his last end like his. B. Day, Lowell The town of Groton, which borders Tyngsborough to the west, was incorporated in 1655, over a century and a half before Tyngsborough. There is only one table stone in the town's Old Burying Ground and it is for the fifth minister, the Rev. Caleb Trowbridge, who was ordained in 1714 (Fig. 13.) A search of the cemetery as well as an 1878 publication of the cemetery's epitaphs revealed that there are no existing markers for the earlier ministers.22 The epitaph on Trowbridge's stone provides informa- tion on his family background, graduation from divinity school, and peri- od of service, as well as his personal qualities. In full the epitaph states: UNDERNEATH THIS STONE LIES THE BODY OF THE REVD CALEB TROWBRIDGE, LATE PASTOR OF THE CHURCH of Christ in Groton, born of reputable Parents in the Town of Newton, educated at Harvard College in Cambridge New-England; of such natural and acquir'd Endowments as 52 Early Congregational Ministers rendered him an Ornament and Blessing in the several Relations which he sustained: he was a good steward over the House of God and discharged the Duties of his Pastoral relation with Prudence and Impartiality; Diligence and Fidelity. He was a tender and loving Husband; an affectionate and kind Parent; an agreeable and faithful friend and a Useful Member of Society. He was much beloved and respected while he lived, and dyed greatly lamented, the 9th day of Septr, AD 1760 in the 69th year of his Age and the 46th of his Ministry and is we trust receiving the reward of his Labours in the Kingdom of his Lord: and in Honour to his Memory his loving People have erected this Monument over his Grave. Blessed are the Dead that die in the Lord for they rest from their Labour and their works do follow them. The Memory of ye just is Blessed. Fig. 13. Reverend Caleb Trowbridge, 1760, Groton. In contrast to previously illustrated table stones, Trowbridge's employs brick supports. Tom and Brenda Malloy 53 Bordering Groton to the north is the town of Pepperell. Here the only table stone in the Walton Cemetery (Fig. 14) is for the town's first minis- ter. It stands next to the matching box tombs of William Prescott, the Colonial commander at Bunker Hill, and his wife. In 1747, when Pepperell was a precinct of Groton, Joseph Emerson was ordained as the pastor. He was the twenty-two year old son of a minister in Maiden, Massachusetts, and had recently served as a chaplain on a British expedi- tion against the French at Louisburg. According to a town history, Emerson's sermons did not deal with the depravity of human nature as did those of many Puritan ministers. Rather, his sermons dealt with people's needs relative to their worth in the eyes of God. In one particular sermon, delivered in 1760, he talked about the \"Pepperell Fever\", a disease which in four years had killed 103 members of the parish. In another sermon, given on Thanksgiving Day in 1766, he rejoiced at the repeal of the Stamp Act and held up the Glorious Revolution of 1688 as a warning to George III.23 Thus, unlike his col- Fig. 14. Reverend Joseph Emerson, 1775, Pepperell. Standing next to the Prescott box tombs, Emerson's table stone provides a good illustration of how table stones were considered symbolic representations of tombs. 54 Early Congregational Ministers leagues in Westford and Littleton, Emerson became an ardent supporter of the American Revolution. Joseph Emerson died in 1775, the year that Pepperell became a town and the first year of the Colonial resistance against England. As a patriot, it is fitting that Emerson is buried next to the American commander of the battle at Bunker Hill. The epitaph on the surface of his table stone, which was erected by the town, is highly complimentary: Erected by the Town of Pepperell to the memory of the Revd Joseph Emerson 1st Pastor of the Church here who deceased Oct. 29th 1775 in the 52nd year of his age and 29th of his Ministry Steadfast in Faith once delivered to the Saints Fixed and laborious in the cause of Christ & precious souls Exemplary in visiting and sympathizing with his Flock Diligent in improving his talents A kind Husband, a tender Parent A faithful Reprover a constant Friend and a true Patriot Having ceased from his Labours his works follow him Bordering Pepperell to the west is the town of Townsend, which was incorporated in 1732. Three years after incorporation the first interment took place in the town's Old Burying Ground. Among the burials to fol- low were those of the first two ministers. The marker for Townsend's first pastor, Phinehas Hemenway, is a portrait stone. Hemenway was ordained in 1734, and remained as the town's pastor until his death twenty-seven years later, at which time the town paid for his funeral expenses and for the erection of his gravestone.24 The portrait at the top of the stone (Fig. 15) features clerical tabs and, in contrast to the portraits Tom and Brenda Malloy 55 of other ministers in this survey, is framed by cherub wings. The stone's inscription reads: Erected by the Town to the Memory of the Revd, Mr Phinehas Hemenway the first Pastor of the Church here, who departed this Life May 20th 1760 AE 55 27th of his ministry Sound in Faith, Zealous in the Cause of God, meek and patient under Trials, Faithful to his Lord, and to the Souls of his People. At the bottom of the stone is inscribed the warning, \"From deaths arrows no age or station is free.\" A few feet away from the Hemenway gravestone is the marker of his successor, Samuel Dix. Dix served the town until his death in the thirty- Fig. 15. Reverend Phinehas Hemenway, 1760, Townsend. Hemenway's portrait stone was carved by William Park, the same carver who executed the Billerica portrait stones. 56 Early Congregational Ministers sixth year of his ministry. At the services for Reverend Dix, the funeral ser- mon was given by the pastor of the church in New Ipswich, New Hampshire, in which he stated that Dix's preaching provided \"earnest- ness and pathos of address.\"25 In the summer following the funeral, the town voted to establish a committee \"to obtain a suitable stone to be erect- ed at the grave of Rev. Samuel Dix.\"26 The committee selected a portrait stone (Fig. 16), but, unlike other ministers' portrait stones, this portrait did not include clerical tabs. The epitaph on the marker states: Erected by the Town To the memory of the Rev Mr. Samuel Dix, the 2d Pastor of the Church of Christ in Townsend, who departed this life Nov. 12th 1797: in the 62 year of his age and the 36 of his ministry Fig. 16. Reverend Samuel Dix, 1797, Townsend. The portrait on the Dix stone is considered a common image carved by John Dwight, whose shop was located in Shirley, Massachusetts. Tom and Brenda Malloy 57 Sound in faith, lover of souls Humble, meek and patient under trials, kind charitable and benevolent to all At the bottom of the stone is the verse: Ye living mortals take a solemn view, Of this my silent dark and long abode; Remember you were born like me to die; Therefore prepare to meet the righteous God. Lying to the west of Middlesex County is Worcester County. Of the sixty towns located within Worcester County, Harvard is the most north- easterly. The town's original cemetery is located just south of the com- mon, but there are no markers for the town's first two ministers. This is because they were both dismissed. The first minister, a married man, was discharged for suspected transgressions with a wealthy resident's maid, and the second minister proved to be unsatisfactory because of a speech impediment.27 Harvard's third and fourth ministers proved to be more acceptable and, even though their periods of service were relatively short, their graves are marked by two of only three table stones in the cemetery (Fig. 17). The table stone for Daniel Johnson is the only one in our sampling that also features a portrait. The portrait is located in a crescent-shaped indentation on the upper surface of the marker. Because Thomas Park lived and worked in Harvard and was known to have carved stones sim- ilar to Johnson's, this table stone is more than likely his work. Considering that his period of service was only from 1769 to 1777, Johnson's epitaph is lengthy and highly complimentary. Also, the inscrip- tion documents that his death was caused by dysentery while serving as a chaplain for American forces during the Revolutionary War. The epi- taph reads in full: Sacred to the memory of the Rev. Daniel Johnson Late Pastor of ye Church of Christ in Harvard Early in Life He entered ye ministerial office, 58 Early Congregational Ministers Fig. 17. Reverend Daniel Johnson (foreground), 1777; Reverend Ebenezer Grosvenor (background), 1788, Harvard. These table stones for Harvard's third and fourth pastors, respectively, represent two of only three table stones in the cemetery.

In his Sermons he was orthodox & elegant; In his delivery Zealous, popular & engaging; So that when he ascended the desk, a peculiar attention marked the countenances of his auditory, To his Friends he shewed himself Friendly, who had frequent Pleasing experience of his generous hospitality He was formed for action & Possessed of a martial Genius which lead him to accept ye office of a Chaplain in the American Army just on his entrance into which He was seized with a malignant Dysentery, which put a period to his valuable Life, (disappointing the expectations of his family, friends & Flock) on the 23d of Sept. 1777, In the 30th year of his age and 8th of his Ministry All flesh is as Grass & all ye glory of man as the flower of Grass. Daniel Johnson was not replaced by a permanent pastor for the next five years, at which time Ebenezer Grosvenor was ordained as the town's fourth pastor. He had previously been the pastor in Scituate, Massachu- setts, and, unlike most of his colleagues in central Massachusetts, he was educated at Yale rather than at Harvard College. Even though Grosve- nor's pastorate lasted for only six years until his death, the epitaph on his stone, like that of his predecessor, is lengthy and highly complimentary: 60 Early Congregational Ministers To the memory of the Rev. Ebenezer Grosvenor late Pastor of the Congregational Church in Harvard; descended from respectable parents in Promfret Connecticut; educated at Yale College in New Haven; of such endowments as rendered him an ornament & blessing in the various relations which he sustained; he was a good steward in the house of God, and discharged the duties of his pastoral office with prudence & impartiality, care & fidelity; he was a man of polite address, and peculiarly formed for social life, a tender & loving husband, an affectionate & kind parent, an agreeable friend & pleasing companion; he was much beloved & respected in life, in death greatly lamented, and is we trust receiving the reward of his labours in the kingdom of his Lord; his bereaved & grateful people have erected this stone the monument of his virtues, & their affection, He was the beloved pastor of the first church in Scituate 17 years, and in Harvard 6 He died May 28, 1788. Aged 49 Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord for they rest from their labours & their works do follow them Two towns to the northwest of Harvard is Lunenburg, which was incorporated in 1728, four years before Harvard. At Lunenburg's South Cemetery there is a cluster of three table stones, all of which are for min- Tom and Brenda Malloy 61 isters (Fig. 18). However, the grouping does not include a marker for the first minister because he was dismissed for \"predilection for hunting wild turkeys on the Sabbath and his levity of manner.\"28 Consequently, the table stones are for his successors, the first of whom was David Stearns. Stearns was born in Watertown, Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard in 1738. Five years after his graduation he was ordained in Lunenburg, where he won a reputation for being \"a man of good ability, a faithful and devoted minister, a friend of the people, and labored for the public good.\"29 Further testament to the Reverend Stearns' twenty-eight years of service can be found within the inscription on his table stone, which reads: This Monument erected by the Town of Lunenburgh Is sacred to the Memory of the Reverend David Stearns Fig. 18. Reverend David Stearns (background, left), 1761; Reverend Samuel Payson, (background, right) 1763; Reverend Zabdiel Adams (foreground), 1801, Lunenburg. The town of Lunenburg provided its second through fourth pastors with identical table stones. 62 Early Congregational Ministers their much beloved and respected Pastor who departed this Life in the joyful Expectation of a better on the 9th day of March A D 1761 and in the 52d year of his Age In his private capacity He was a kind Husband, a tender Parent an affectionate Brother and a faithful friend In his Ministerial Character his Conversation was pure entertaining and instructive: His Doctrines plain and Scriptural: and his Life truly exemplary: He was adorned with Hospitality with Singular Prudence "
