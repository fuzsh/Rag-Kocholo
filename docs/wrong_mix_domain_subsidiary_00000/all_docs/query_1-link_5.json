        "text": "When setting up a Poly phone that you did not purchase from Nextiva, you’ll need to check the firmware to make sure it is the newest version. If the phone is showing firmware versions 3.x.x, you’ll need to upgrade to 4.x.x. This article will show you how to check your phone’s firmware and upgrade it if needed.\n\nHow to check the firmware on a Poly phone:\n\nReboot the phone (or unplug it and plug it back in).\n\nPush Menu.\n\nSelect Status.\n\nSelect Platform.\n\nSelect Application.\n\nSelect Main.\n\nCheck the firmware version and determine whether it is 3.X.X or 4.X.X.\n\nNOTE: If your phone is showing firmware in the range of 3.x.x, you’ll need to upgrade the phone to version 4.x.x before entering the provisioning rule and setting up the phone.\n\nTo upgrade the firmware:\n\nObtain the IP address of the phone as it’s booting up, or by going to Menu > Status > Network > TCP/IP Parameters.\n\nEnter the IP address into a web browser. The phone has to be on the same local network as the computer in order for this to work.\n\nIf your phone asks for a password, the default password is 456.\n\nHover your mouse over the Utilities Menu and select Software Upgrade.\n\nVerify that the Server Type is set to Polycom Hosted Server and then select Check For Updates.\n\nYou should see a list of firmware types under the Software Available at Polycom Server drop-down list.\n\nSelect the 4.0.4.**** option out of the drop-down and press Install. The phone will go through its upgrade process at this time. When complete the phone will provision normally on the new firmware.\n\nNeed additional help? Click here."
