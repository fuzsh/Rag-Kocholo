        "text": "Reinstall the firmware on a Polycom SoundPoint\n\nHow to reinstall the firmware on Polycom SoundPoint devices and unlock them for use with Telzio.\n\nTelzio enables you to use existing IP phones, but before you can configure your phones with Telzio, you may need to reinstall the software on the phone if it has been locked by the previous carrier.\n\nImportant: Flashing a Polycom's firmware may remove the phone's factory certificate, which will cause the phone to be unable to connect to Polycom's ZTP service for auto provisioning.\n\nBy reinstalling the software on the IP phone, you will reset the phone back to its original factory settings. While on some phones you can simply hit a Factory Reset button, Polycom phones can be locked to a single vendor, making it necessary to completely reinstall the software. Reinstalling the software on an IP phone is often referred to as flashing the firmware.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn how to break carrier-locked software on your Polycom IP phone. This guide covers instructions to reinstall firmware for the Polycom Soundpoint IP330, and can also be followed to reinstall the firmware for other models in the series.\n\nManually updating firmware of flashing the firmware on your IP phone may void your warranty and Telzio assumes no responsibility for broken, bricked or other complications that may arise by following this guide.\n\nSteps for flashing the firmware on Polycom SoundPoint IP phones:\n\nDownload the bootloader\n\nFind the SIP software application\n\nRun the TFTP application\n\nPrepare the files\n\nHost the files\n\nConfigure the phone for firmware flashing\n\nDisable Trivial FTP\n\nWhat you'll need\n\nThe bootloader for the phone\n\nThe new SIP software application for the phone\n\nA TFTP application that can host the files for your phone\n\nDownload the bootloader\n\nThe bootloader for the Polycom SoundPoint can be downloaded from the Polycom support site.\n\nFind the SIP software application\n\nGo to Polycom’s Software Release Matrix\n\nFind the IP320/330 column\n\nScroll down to the row that says Yes for the column\n\nAt the time of writing, this is version 3.3.5. We’re taking the “Split” variation for this guide.\n\nRun the TFTP application\n\nTrivial FTP (TFTP) is a file transport protocol to flash the software on the Polycom phone. TFTP is different than FTP and SFTP. You can use PumpKIN TFTP Server, which is a simple stand-alone application that accepts TFTP requests and works with Windows and OSX.\n\nDownload PumpKIN\n\nLook at the right section of the page, under TFTP server and client, and select binary downloads (Be careful to avoid banner ads with the text Download Now)\n\nDownload the latest version for your operating system.\n\nWhen run, the exe-file extracts the actual PumpKIN software into a directory of your choice. It can be uninstalled in Add/Remove Programs later if you want to remove it.\n\nPrepare the files\n\nTo prepare, we need to extract the two zip files from Polycom (Bootloader + SIP Software), into the same directory\n\nPlace the contents of both zip files into a directory, in this case named tftp-root\n\nHost the files\n\nOpen the PumpKIN TFTP program, and press Options\n\nSet the TFTP filesystem root (download path) to where you placed the extracted files (tftp-root)\n\nEnable Allow access to subdirectories\n\nSet Read Request Behavior to Give all files\n\nSet Write Request Behavior to Take all files\n\nSteps 4-5 will save you from confirming every time the phone wants to access or send a file, which will happen frequently during this process.\n\nConfigure the phone for firmware flashing\n\nTo flash the phone, you need to enter its setup while it’s booting.\n\nIf your phone is already turned on, remove the power and plug it back in\n\nWhen the phone starts, you’ll see the message Waiting for network to initialize\n\nPress the Setup button\n\nEnter the default password 456\n\nPress Down and select Server Menu\n\nWhen you reach Server Type, press Edit and press the Right button until it shows Trivial FTP\n\nPress OK\n\nWhen you reach Server Address, type in the IP address of your computer running PumpKIN\n\nPress Edit and then a->1A to enable inserting numberss (the star/asterisk button inserts a period)\n\nEnter the IP, and press OK\n\nNext, you’ll be asked for Server User, which you can ignore\n\nPress Exit until you get to Exit Option\n\nClick Save & Reboot\n\nYour phone will reboot and connect to the pumpkin server to start downloading the new bootloader and firmware.\n\nIf PumpKIN asks you to give access to a new connection, select Yes.\n\nYou’ll start seeing activity in PumpKIN when the process starts. The phone will reboot a few times during this process, and eventually boot up in a working state.\n\nDisable Trivial FTP\n\nWhen the firmware installation is complete, you'll need to disable the Trivial FTP functionality.\n\nPress Menu\n\nGo to Settings\n\nSelect Advanced\n\nSelect Admin Settings\n\nSelect Network Configuration\n\nScroll down and select Server Menu\n\nPress down once, and edit the Server address\n\nPress the < < option to erase\n\nHit OK\n\nPress the Left button a few times until the phone asks if you want to save the configuration\n\nSelect Yes\n\nDue to the fact that Polycom has hundreds of different firmware versions for their product lines, Telzio is unable to provide technical support on Polycom products at this time."
