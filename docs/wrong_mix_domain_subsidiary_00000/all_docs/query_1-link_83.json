        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI have issues with updating a phone from a local ftp server on my computer. I just started running an ftp server using FileZilla.\n\nMy Soundstation IP 6000 has SIP 3.3.3.0069 and BootRom 4.3.1.0887\n\nand I have tried to point it to my ftp server in the pre-boot environment using the credentials and ip address of my computer.\n\nI am trying to use this guide posted here on Polycom’s forums.\n\nSo I unzipped UC software 4.0.14, Upgrader 4.4.0 Rev B, and Updater 5.0.14 to the ftp root.\n\nHowever it doesn’t change after multiple reboots. The Filezilla server window doesn’t show any users logging into it or doing anything…\n\nAnyone else experience this issue and gotten out of it?\n\nEdit*\n\nDo I have to do anything with a sip.cfg file? The guide didn’t say anything about that…but I see in the phone’s gui under Status>Platform>Configuration it says:\n\nConfiguration Files:\n\n-File: sip.cfg\n\nErrors Found: 45\n\nParameters Accepted: 136\n\nEDIT*****************************************\n\n**SOLUTION - after much trial and tribulation -\n\nFrom my comment below*************************\n\nSo, you might not believe this, but it happened. We have an upgraded phone now. I am trying to sort through some of the mystery, but here is my most straightforward explanation.\n\nI downloaded and unzipped SIP 3.3.5 SPLIT, because I already had BootROM 4.3.1 and the Split version are recommended for Bootrom’s above 4.0.\n\nMind you, my phone already had 3.3.5, but I was just using this folder as a baseline for what worked. I had then reformatted the phone so that it had 3.3.5 installed with all the defaults.\n\nI pointed my TFTP server to that folder without modding the folder at all.\n\nThen I read back over some of the links I had already been through and several places had seen you need to use a BootROM upgrader before upgrading to later versions. I had been over this several times, but finallly decided to try unzipping the 4.4.0B Upgrader into the 3.3.5 Split folder.\n\nLet me tell you, that 4.4.0B is important,lol. The documentation on Polycom’s site and its FAQ’s left me confused, because they didn’t make this difference known enough, even though it was mentioned.\n\nhttps://community.polycom.com/t5/VoIP-SIP-Phones/FAQ-What-does-the-message-quot-Image-is-not-compati… .\n\nPoly | Video & Voice Collaboration Solutions | HP® Official Site… .\n\nIn the 2nd link, they mention getting 4.4.0B, but it’s not in the downloads area where they say it is. Their documentation isn’t up to date apparantely.\n\nThis link actually contains a direct download link for the 4.4.0 B upgrader, even though you can’t find it in the downloads section of Polycom’s website. You have to scroll down quite far in the page to the Upgrade Path section.\n\nAnd here is the direct link.\n\nhttp://downloads.polycom.com/voice/voip/uc/SoundPoint_IP_BootROM_4_4_0B_Upgrader_release_sig.zip\n\nI had previously downloaded the 4.4.0 version and unzipped it into several SIP version folders to no avail, but the B version actually contains a 3111-15600-001.bootrom.ld file that actually works. So after telling the phone to update the config, it rebooted itself and took the bootrom! Then it took time to reformat itself and re-install the same SIP version.\n\nNext, I pointed the TFTP server to a newer SIP folder. It downloaded SIP 4.0.10 and got into a boot loop! It still had BootROM 4.4.0B at this point.\n\nSo I caught it at one of its boots after it tried to load the new SIP software, and I reset it to defaults before it could boot up. Then it did its resetting configuration and rebooted itself. It then configured network and booted into SIP ok, but then rebooted one more time.\n\nI logged into the web browser and was able to tell it to update to 4.0.14. Split\n\nI then went and downloaded and unzipped Updater 5.0.15 into the corresponding 4.0.14 folder. It went ahead and grabbed the new updater and did a reboot and reformat and install of 5.0.15 then it re-installed 4.0.14 split.\n\n@johnnygarza6549 @patricia-polycom @sam-polycom @sarah-polycom\n\n@rhummel ​ I really appreciate your time!\n\nSo it seems that SIP 3.3.5 is the latest version the phone will take without complaining about being “not compatible”.\n\nIt also seems the phone will not take “bootrom.ld” from the updater of 5.x and beyond, and also doesn’t like the files found in Soundpoint_IP_BootROM_4_4_0_Upgrader_release_sig.\n\nWhen the phone boots up, it grabs the “000000…0.cfg” file at 100%, then bootrom.ld at 80% then sip.ld at 75% according to the tftp window.\n\nI will try and post the last part of the boot log.\n\n000002.772|wdog |*|00|Initial log entry.

I am trying to go 4.0.x only because I like the web interface.\n\nOriginally, I was going to keep this phone as a spare for our conference room phones. I have 3 other Soundstation IP 6000 phones working just fine running the 4.0.10 software for the older ip 6000 Rev AD phones and 4.0.14 for the newer ip6000 Rev AP. They each had their “bootrom” updated to “Updater 5.x” as well without problem.\n\nAnd yeah that’s my mistake, I had reset the phone again after and forgot to make it static again for TFTP. I will do that again.\n\nI concur with the frustration! I have been following the guides in the links above, but it doesn’t seem to a resolution. They all say to use that 4.4.0 Upgrader by unzipping it into the SIP version TFTP root folder. I do that and I get logs like above.\n\n0707160058|cfg |*|00|Prov|Starting to update 3111-15600-001.bootrom.ld 0707160058|cfg |3|00|Could not get all 512 bytes of the header 0707160058|app1 |4|00|Error downloading 3111-15600-001.bootrom.ld\n\nThese 3 lines are a bit odd to me. I wonder why it couldn’t get all 512 bytes of the header. My guess is because it didn’t get the 4.4.0 Upgrade done first? That seems to be pre-requisite, but I don’t know.\n\nI also think those 3 lines are irrelevant since the phone then proceeds to look into bootrom.ld and compare the headers.\n\nIt then says it can’t find a compatible image within the bootrom.ld\n\n0707160101|cfg |5|00|Error: file does not contain a compatible image 0707160101|cfg |5|00| Compatibility for image 0 is 0x411555 0707160101|cfg |5|00| Compatibility for image 1 is 0x411555 0707160101|cfg |5|00| Compatibility for image 2 is 0x411555 0707160101|cfg |5|00| Compatibility for image 3 is 0x411555 0707160101|cfg |5|00| Compatibility for image 4 is 0x411555\n\nSo I am not sure how to step up the phones from 4.3.1 bootrom to get it to go higher. I am not sure what is wrong with the 4.4.0\n\nEdit: It is curious that the 4.4.0 Upgrader does not have a split bootrom with 3111-15600-001 in it. So it’s possible that the general “bootrom.ld” in the folder also doesn’t have an entry for it…\n\n@rhummel ​\n\nSo, you might not believe this, but it happened. We have an upgraded phone now. I am trying to sort through some of the mystery, but here is my most straightforward explanation.\n\nI downloaded and unzipped SIP 3.3.5 SPLIT, because I already had BootROM 4.3.1 and the Split version are recommended for Bootrom’s above 4.0.\n\nMind you, my phone already had 3.3.5, but I was just using this folder as a baseline for what worked. I had then reformatted the phone so that it had 3.3.5 installed with all the defaults.\n\nI pointed my TFTP server to that folder without modding the folder at all.\n\nThen I read back over some of the links I had already been through and several places had seen you need to use a BootROM upgrader before upgrading to later versions. I had been over this several times, but finallly decided to try unzipping the 4.4.0B Upgrader into the 3.3.5 Split folder.\n\nLet me tell you, that 4.4.0B is important,lol. The documentation on Polycom’s site and its FAQ’s left me confused, because they didn’t make this difference known enough, even though it was mentioned.\n\nIn the 2nd link, they mention getting 4.4.0B, but it’s not in the downloads area where they say it is. Their documentation isn’t up to date apparantely.\n\nThis link actually contains a direct download link for the 4.4.0 B upgrader, even though you can’t find it in the downloads section of Polycom’s website. You have to scroll down quite far in the page to the Upgrade Path section.\n\nAnd here is the direct link.\n\nhttp://downloads.polycom.com/voice/voip/uc/SoundPoint_IP_BootROM_4_4_0B_Upgrader_release_sig.zip\n\nI had previously downloaded the 4.4.0 version and unzipped it into several SIP version folders to no avail, but the B version actually contains a 3111-15600-001.bootrom.ld file that actually works. So after telling the phone to update the config, it rebooted itself and took the bootrom! Then it took time to reformat itself and re-install the same SIP version.\n\nNext, I pointed the TFTP server to a newer SIP folder. It downloaded SIP 4.0.10 and got into a boot loop! It still had BootROM 4.4.0B at this point.\n\nSo I caught it at one of its boots after it tried to load the new SIP software, and I reset it to defaults before it could boot up. Then it did its resetting configuration and rebooted itself. It then configured network and booted into SIP ok, but then rebooted one more time.\n\nI logged into the web browser and was able to tell it to update to 4.0.14. Split\n\nI then went and downloaded and unzipped Updater 5.0.15 into the corresponding 4.0.14 folder. It went ahead and grabbed the new updater and did a reboot and reformat and install of 5.0.15 then it re-installed 4.0.14 split.\n\nSo it’s up and running!\n\nRobert, I can’t thank you enough for hanging with me in this thread! Phew! Finally."
