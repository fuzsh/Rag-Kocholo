An IP address consists of four numbers separated by full stops. A home network's IP address will start with 192.168. Routers typically have IP addresses like 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1. Depending on your device or computer, the way you'll find out your router's IP address will be different. Here are the steps for each.\n\nWindows\n\nOpen the command prompt by accessing the search bar and typing 'cmd'. A black window will appear in which you'll need to type 'ipconfig'.
