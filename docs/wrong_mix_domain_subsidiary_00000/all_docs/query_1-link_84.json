If you are looking for a device that can integrate with your desktop Lync client then this is NOT the device!\n\nThis phone is for those “dial tone only” locations like in the lunch room.\n\nWhen thePolycom IP331 arrives it usually has an older version of software on the device. Mine came with SIP Software version 3.3.3.x and Boot ROM Version 4.3.1.x\n\nOK, so the phone needs the UC SIP Software Version 4.0.x to play nice with Lync. Shouldn’t be too much trouble, yeah right!\n\nAfter spending hours chasing my tail on the net I finally managed to upgrade the phone. So here’s the quick facts.\n\nBefore the Upgrade the phone URL access was user Polycom, Password 456 and disploayed the image below once logged in.\n\nSo we begin, first you will need to have an FTP server up and running. I used Filezilla Server.\n\nOnce installed you will see the Connect to Server window, just click OK\n\nNext we need to define the user and home directory. Click on Add user and define the user name\n\nand the password\n\nNext, define the FTP root directory.\n\nMake sure you allow Write and Delete, and set as home\n\nThe FTP server is now configured, next you will need to download the Upgrade files for both the BootROM and the SIP Software. Its a bit overwhelmed when you get to Polycom’s website since there are so many different phones and software versions.You will need to go to the site to download the correct files.\n\nI will document the IP331 files.You are presented with a Combination and a split download. Regardless of the BootROM version (and contrary to what the site states) download the combination.\n\nWhen you click on the link you are presented with the page below\n\nYou will need to download the Polycom Upgrader 4.0.0. Utility (as I did and I was on BootROM 4.XX!!) if your BootROM is pre 4.0 (DO IT ANYWAY)\n\nOnce you have downloaded this you can go ahead and check the radio button and click on Submit – which will start the SIP Software download. Once complete copy both the Upgrader files and the Software files to the FTP Root directory so it looks similar to the below.\n\nAn FYI, The xxx.bootrom.id files match the phones part number.\n\nSo how do you get the phone to boot from the FTP server?\n\nNow enter the IP Address of your FTP Server (use the * key as a . )\n\n(using the # key to switch case and number)"
