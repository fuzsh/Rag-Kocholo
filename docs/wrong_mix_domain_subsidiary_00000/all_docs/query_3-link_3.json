        "text": "Funny, Our desk phones are Polycom, before that they were Avaya and before that in the pre-voip times, Nortel. We just bought a company that uses Yealink phones and I have got to say, Avaya were junk for management, Polycom was okay, I thought they were really quite good until I logged into the Yealink and it took 1/3 of the time to do what I would normally do with the phones.\n\nThat being said I don’t think I’d put $5 into a desk phone company, over the last 5 years we have basically phased out the desk phone for the softphone and cell phone clients, I have shelves of Polycom phones in storage and once we have migrated the new company will probably retire the few Polycoms and replace them with some of the Yealinks as those people move to the softphone, our main office has 4 active physical phones in the entire building, everyone else is on a softphone."
