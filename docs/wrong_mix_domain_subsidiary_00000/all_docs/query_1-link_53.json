        "text": "Introduction\n\nA MAC address (media access control address) is a unique set of alpha-numeric digits used to identify a device within a network. Every device has one. It can be found printed on the device (e.g. for a phone, it may be on a label on the back) or in user settings.\n\nWhy are you asking for the MAC address of a device?\n\nAs a MAC address is a unique identifier, essensys can find your device easily when connecting to the Wi-Fi or Cabled network, if you are unsure of troubleshooting steps you can view the guides for Wi-Fi or Telephony.\n\nDid you know?\n\nEach device has a MAC address for each part of the device for example a Laptop would have a MAC address for it's Cabled Connection and another MAC address for it's Wi-Fi make sure you provide the correct MAC address either when adding the MAC address for Wi-Fi MAC or Device or when speaking with essensys.\n\nWhat is Randomized MAC address or Private Address?\n\nWithin the new version of iOS and Android a new feature has been added when joining Wi-Fi's without a Password the device will automatically randomize the MAC address of the device, this is to stop listeners to build a profile of the device and thus increase user Privacy.\n\nIn some cases this will cause a device to not connect to Wi-Fi MAC or Device, in this guide we will go through how to find the MAC address and how to disable this feature.\n\nSelect your device below:\n\nPolycom Handset\n\nTo find the MAC Address on a Polycom Handset, you can either check the back of the handset or on through the handsets interface.\n\nMAC Address on the back of the handset:\n\nTo see the MAC Address on the handset menu, select Home key - Settings - Status - Platform - Network - Ethernet - MAC Address is the top line.\n\n​\n\nWindows Device\n\n2. Type in ipconfig /all and press Enter.\n\nThis will display your network configuration.\n\n3. Find your adapter's physical address.\n\nScroll down to your network adapter and look for the values next to \"Physical Address,\" which is your MAC address.\n\nThere are potentially two different physical addresses (MAC address) for your wired connection and wireless connection, pay attention to the name of the device! (pictured is 'Wireless LAN adapter')\n\nHow to Find Your MAC Address in the Network Connection Settings\n\nYou can also find the MAC address by looking at the details of your network adapter in Windows.\n\n2. Right-click on your network connection and select \"Status.\"\n\n3. Click the \"Details\" button.\n\nHere you'll find the Physical Address, this would be the MAC address of the Wi-Fi in this example, if you are looking for the Cabled connection you might be looking for Local Area Network or Cabled Connection depending on the device.\n\nMac OS\n\nThese are instructions on how to find the MAC address of your Ethernet or Wireless networking card in Mac OS\n\nOn your Mac, choose Apple menu > System Settings, click General in the sidebar, then click Sharing on the right. (You may need to scroll down.)\n\nClick the Info button to the right of a service that’s turned on.\n\nThe network address for the service is displayed in the window.\n\niOS\n\nTo find the MAC address or Private MAC address on your iPhone follow the guide below,\n\nTo disable the Private Wi-Fi Address off or on. If your device joined the network without using a private address, a privacy warning will explain why.\n\nAndroid\n\nSome Android devices may also use very similar steps to the iPhone instructions above:\n\nGo to Settings\n\nAbout (device)\n\nStatus\n\nWi-Fi MAC address\n\nThis would then be the WiFi Address for the Android device, note that some devices do have Randomized or Private MAC address enabled, please make sure you have provided the correct MAC address.\n\nPrinters\n\nAs there are many different brands of printers, most printers have a different set up. The easiest way to find the MAC Address of a printer is to do the following:\n\nNavigate through the settings on the printer's control panel to find an option to print a configuration page. You can sometimes find the option in \"Report Settings,\" \"Network Setup,\" \"Print Setup,\" \"Self Test\" or a similar menu.\n\nOr...\n\nReview the manual that came with the printer for instructions to locate the MAC address if you're unable to find the address following these steps.\n\nOr...\n\nInspect the back and bottom of the unit for a product sticker. Check the label for a 12-digit address.\n\n​"
