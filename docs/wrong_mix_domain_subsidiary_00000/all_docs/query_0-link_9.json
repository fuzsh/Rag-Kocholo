Integration of the functionality and applications of a personal computer with videoconferencing hardware provided a videoconference platform that included the ability to use a broad range of PC applications, as well as simultaneous access to the Internet. The Company has manufactured and installed more than 30,000 videoconferencing endpoints worldwide and provides service for more than 9,000 of these endpoints, as well as other endpoints, currently under maintenance agreements. In August 2000, the Company, then known as VTEL, announced its plans to shift its strategy by enacting a new business charter and creating two business units, Products and Solutions, to focus on distinctive core competencies. Our Products unit is focused on building and selling videoconferencing endpoints while our Solutions unit is focused on providing services and software for all available enterprise systems. The Company's vast experience in the industry indicated that videoconferencing would not reach the broad-based market appeal necessary for overall growth of the Company's business through the production of videoconferencing endpoints alone. This situation is further demonstrated by the decline in the average selling price of videoconferencing endpoints over the past several years while the videoconferencing industry as a whole has remained relatively flat in terms of revenue growth during the same periods. Management has decided to focus our efforts on our Solutions business and to exit our Products business. Therefore, we announced in May 2001 that the Company intended to sell its Products business unit and rename the remaining Solutions business unit as Forgent Corporation, subject to the execution and consummation of a sale agreement and shareholder approval. The Company executed the sale agreement in early October 2001 and is intending to submit the sale of the Products business to our shareholders at our 2001 annual meeting. To facilitate the change, special attention is being paid to improving the interoperability of all the components in a broadband video network, to expanding the Company's current interoperability labs to create a center of excellence for standards testing and integration and to developing and introducing enterprise videoconferencing software that provides a high level of manageability, reliability and ease-of-use for existing and new enterprise systems. We believe we must provide network software and services that will support the vast amount of visual communication applications that are becoming possible with increased bandwidth. Furthermore, the development and expansion of our consulting and services competencies will ultimately transform the majority of our revenue base to a software and solutions centric provider. We feel that refocusing our efforts will provide the greatest opportunity for long-term success for Forgent and its shareholders. Our new name reflects our desire to forge a new vision and direction for the industry as well as a new business model that is designed to provide potential increased growth in shareholder value. INDUSTRY BACKGROUND Videoconferencing first became available on a commercial basis in the early 1980's. A wide range of uses quickly emerged ranging from business and professional meetings, education and training classes, to technical and medical consultations. Customers typically make use of this innovative technology to reduce operating costs, improve customer service, reduce cycle times, and improve intra- or inter-company communications. The industry has primarily evolved around the production of the various compression/decompression (or Codec) devices as each manufacturer has developed its own proprietary software that compresses and decompresses signal for transmission of video, audio and data signals between two or more locations over a network connection. VTEL products, in particular, have been characterized by the innovation of placing the Codec within a standard PC using an open architecture as opposed to operating the Codec on a proprietary operating system. By incorporating a PC into the videoconferencing endpoint, VTEL products allow for the inclusion of software applications such as PowerPoint(TM) presentations, spreadsheets and the ability to use whiteboard annotations during a videoconference as well as other applications. Over the years, few companies manufactured videoconferencing endpoints, which fall into two distinct categories: (1) the room or group videoconferencing products tailored for targeted markets with specific application needs and (2) the set-top products for the individuals who require strictly video and audio communications during a call. During this same time, the proliferation of the broadband network has augmented the appeal of 1\n\nvideoconferencing, thereby increasing the demand for the set-top or appliance type products. While the unit volumes of these products have increased dramatically, the average selling price of set-top products is significantly less than that of a room system. The result is that the total revenue of the videoconferencing endpoint market has remained relatively flat despite the increased unit volume. Although usage of videoconferencing systems is on the rise, limitations still exist with respect to managing these types of networks. The need for enterprise software and services that assist users in managing their videoconferencing systems, ensuring reliability of the video network and applications, as well as ease of use, is the primary reason the industry has not enjoyed the growth of other hardware industries such as the PC. We believe that while the demand in the industry will continue to be directed toward set-top videoconferencing, technological developments will reduce the endpoint to a software application with minimal additional hardware attached to the PC. We also believe that our experience in providing solutions and software for specific customer needs makes Forgent uniquely positioned to address these limitations. The key to our future in this evolving industry will be based on our ability to develop software and offer services and solutions that can be successfully delivered to the end users as visual communications become easier to use and the associated networks more manageable and more reliable. CORPORATE STRATEGY As VTEL we were known as a leader in the design, manufacture and sale of videoconferencing hardware and software with thousands of satisfied customers around the world. As the industry has evolved into one with increased price competition for endpoint products, the Company has shifted its focus from manufacturing videoconferencing endpoints to providing the tools to visually enable Internet Protocol (\"IP\") and ISDN networks. Forgent's corporate strategy includes managing this transition in its business model with a view towards generating profitable results from operations as quickly as possible. This process, which began in August 2000, has included the restructuring and refocusing of our core operations, the divestiture of all non-core operations, the development of strategic relationships with network providers and vendors of visual communication software and the creation of a visual management software platform. Although such a strategy involves certain risks, we believe our years of expertise, customer relationships and existing software and hardware product offerings can be leveraged for future financial success. Internet Protocol networks that connect large businesses and organizations continue to expand and the steady growth of fiber optic or \"broadband\" cable lines to serve these networks, create a new environment for visual communications - video over IP. Thus, our new business model involves continued execution of the following strategies: o developing industry-wide interoperability tools to ensure that all video network hardware and software are compatible regardless of manufacturer; o designing back-office, enterprise software products to establish the standard for video over IP and ISDN; o integrating entire video networks using existing IP and ISDN enterprise networks and our software; o serving as an industry consultant and expert on video over IP and ISDN; o managing video networks; o providing multi-vendor services and support; o fulfilling multi-vendor endpoint and network product requirements, including integrated systems. In addition, the current economic downturn and world and US political situation caused by the events of September 11, 2001 have increased attention on the videoconferencing industry as a means for corporations to reduce travel expenses, to alleviate safety concerns and to still receive the benefit from face-to-face communication. Early industry figures show the volume of video over today's networks have increased 70% since the September 11th tragedy. The world situation has changed fundamental business processes and has provided an intensified urgency and need for Forgent to prove its services expertise by progressing our Video Network Platform (\"Forgent VNP\") software from beta version to production-level software in the 2002 fiscal year. Forgent VNP is designed to allow system administrators to manage complex heterogeneous video networks from remote locations. Through strong industry partnerships, successful feedback from our beta-testing, and other marketing strategies, Forgent VNP is gaining widespread attention and if successfully adopted, we believe it can be the catalyst for moving video from an infant industry into a mission critical application. We believe the face of modern business 2\n\ncommunication has changed forever and human interaction over video will supplant the need many for face-to-face business transactions. We anticipate revenue to originate from the sale of product elements such as software, systems and network integration, network consulting services and endpoint and network maintenance, as well as equipment sales. As Forgent we will generate additional revenue through value added services and our enterprise software while selling the hardware of many companies. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND SOFTWARE A key strategy in our business plan to become a services and software provider for visually enabling broadband networks lies in our existing expertise as a provider of video systems integration and maintenance services. Since the announcement of the Company's new charter, we have determined the greatest growth and profit opportunities in the videoconferencing industry lie in improving industry wide multi-vendor platform interoperability and in the integration and management of video conferencing networks, all of which are core competencies of the Forgent team. Therefore, we announced in May 2001 that the Company intended to sell its Products business unit and rename the remaining Solutions business unit as Forgent Corporation, subject to the execution and consummation of a sale agreement and shareholder approval. The Company executed the sale agreement in early October 2001 and is intending to submit the sale of the Products business to our shareholders at our 2001 annual meeting. If the transaction is consummated as anticipated, we will exit from the Products business and focus on building and growing our Solutions business. As the Forgent Corporation, we will increase our focus on providing advanced video services for enterprise communications, enterprise software that improves video network management and reliability and interoperability standards throughout the industry. We will leverage our service and software expertise in the deployment and management of videoconferencing endpoints by continuing to actively market our ability to integrate, install and service a wide offering of third-party products, including the products of companies that were traditional competitors when our focus was hardware. Our service group currently supports more than 9,000 endpoint systems around the world under maintenance agreements. These endpoints include current VTEL products, legacy products, network products for which the Company acted as a reseller and a growing base of our traditional competitors' products. We will continue to actively pursue additional support and maintenance contracts for all hardware products as well as other products that emerge in the broadband visual communications industry. Through service and maintenance offerings, we will augment our experience and knowledge of the multiple endpoints available within the industry, thus positioning Forgent as the industry expert in visual communication solutions. As such, we are expanding our service offering to include all of the following: network consulting, interoperability testing, total call management, 24x7 hotline support, emergency on-site support, resident engineering services, video integrations services, and training. The service group has also developed a worldwide reputation as a visual communications solutions provider. We have successfully integrated systems into boardrooms and auditoriums for our corporate customers as well as classrooms in primary schools, colleges and universities by providing solutions for customers requiring multiple voice activated cameras, custom user-interface and other customized requirements. The experience gained by addressing these needs further positions Forgent as the focal point and leader in visually enabling existing and emerging network infrastructures. In addition to software that provides manageability, reliability and ease-of-use, the videoconferencing industry has needed a \"hardware agnostic\" source for interoperability testing. Forgent is meeting this need through the creation of an industry exclusive interoperability lab that allows for real-world testing of video networking technology regardless of brand. In our labs, we can test any major technology brands to ensure they that work, and more importantly, that they work together. Our labs can test everything from personal and group communications products to peripheral components and network technology, which guarantee our customers receive the full value of their video network investments. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2001, Forgent designed Video Network Platform (\"Forgent VNP\"), an enterprise-class server software to manage today's complex heterogeneous video networks. For the first time, enterprises have a tool they can use to proactively measure and improve their end-to-end video quality of service. 3\n\nForgent VNP gives enterprises control over video networks by applying the power of traditional network management tools to video, thus making video usage as reliable as telephone and computer usage. Operating across traditional ISDN networks (H.320) as well as IP networks (H.323), Forgent VNP is the first vendor neutral management software that can manage any brand name endpoints, gateways, gatekeepers, bridges, MCUs, as well as traditional network attached devices such as desktops, servers, printers, IP phones, etc. With features including comprehensive real-time displays, detailed location and status of video infrastructure, an event notification system that provides real-time alerts, powerful diagnostic tools that identify and help isolate video network problems, scheduling, reporting, and automated call launching, Forgent VNP finds, monitors, and identifies video related devices on the network so they can be managed through business rules. Forgent VNP is compatible and interoperable with existing enterprise management frameworks, including Hewlett-Packard's OpenView(R). Network Node Manager, and is designed to accommodate additional endpoints as well as future network protocols, thus protecting a customer's current video investments while smoothing the transition to next-generation technologies. Beta testing for Forgent VNP started in September 2001 with global companies in a variety of industries such as finance/banking, oil and gas, pharmaceutical, government, education and diverse multi-nationals. After several weeks of testing, the video, telecommunications, and IT groups of these companies are all providing positive feedback on the software and its capabilities. The testing will be extended to international customers later this year through Forgent's strategic partnership with Mobile Video Communication AG, the largest German supplier of video, audio, and data conferencing solutions, as well as to other customers. System testing will continue with enhancements being made to the software based on customer feedback. Currently, potential customers are approaching Forgent and requesting proposals for the hardware and software installations for Forgent VNP, although they have not participated in the beta program. Forgent VNP is planned and on target to go into production by the end of the calendar year 2001. INTERNET STRATEGY During the year ended July 31, 2000, the Company established two entities within its combined organizational structure to leverage its expertise in visual communications and to pursue business strategies over the Internet. OnScreen24(TM) developed and marketed visual communication tools for the Internet and ArticuLearn(TM) was an e-learning portal provider for commercial and educational businesses that delivered learning content in a Web environment. During fiscal year 2001, management determined that these strategies were not consistent with the Company's shifted focus on video network software and services. Therefore, the Company ceased further investment in these non-core operations. OnScreen24's operations were folded back into the core operations as of January 31, 2001, and ArticuLearn's operations were terminated as of June 30, 2001. DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY Forgent primarily delivers its capabilities directly to the end-user customers. These services will generally involve larger customers that already have sophisticated visual communication networks in place, but require more sophisticated involvement to support the sale, installation, operation and maintenance of the network. As we intend to offer a broader range of visual communication products, we also expect to develop a broader range of customers, especially as broadband networks become available and affordable to small businesses. VNP will be marketed with a direct sales force, separate from the sales force from our services organization. By building alliances with strategic partners, we plan to leverage their existing channels to directly reach our customers. COMPETITION While there are several manufacturers of videoconferencing endpoints, very few companies are dedicated to developing a business by providing services and software around video communications over Local Area Networks (\"LANs\"), Wide Area Networks (\"WANs\"), and Metropolitan Area Networks (\"MANs\"). Although big network providers sell videoconferencing equipment along with the network they are installing, they do not usually provide post-installation services such as product services and training. Furthermore, today's network management tools do not provide carriers with in depth information about video devices (endpoints, gateways, gatekeepers, Multicontrol Units (\"MCUs\"), bridges, etc. In addition, these networks are typically proprietary in nature and are not open to other hardware or software vendors, limiting the customers in their usability. Similarly, videoconferencing manufacturers may offer a small amount of proprietary device level software to be used on their 4\n\nproducts but do not usually provide a complete view of the entire network infrastructure showing all the network touch points. Other potential competition comes from a few start-up companies that are attempting to develop software that supports video over broadband networks. However, these companies are typically working with proprietary software and do not have the level of industry experience that Forgent brings to the market. The traditional network management systems vendors like Hewlett Packard, Sun Microsystems, and others have traditionally focused on managing devices and are moving to manage system level applications. At the same time, enterprise systems management vendors like IBM Tivoli, BMC Patrol, and Computer Associates Unicenter, who have traditionally focused on managing system level applications, are migrating to cover device level management as well. However, both groups, while interested in covering the widest breadth of device types, do not have the same depth of understanding of video as Forgent and today have no mechanism to discover, to monitor, to diagnose, or to report on video application or device level issues. Forgent is pursuing the addition of several new partnerships to expand the utilization of video, thereby making it a business critical application. Therefore, Forgent's goal is to ensure dependable video communications by combining professional services with network management tools to deliver ease of use, reliability, and manageability for video communications through interoperability standards. While we believe that by embarking on this business strategy that we are focusing on a niche that is being ignored by the industry, there can be no assurances that this strategy will be successful. Furthermore, if this strategy is successful it is likely that other companies will attempt to duplicate this business model. We do believe that, like the PC industry, which saw exceptional growth after the introduction of network management software, the combination of software and services provided by Forgent could have a similar affect on the videoconferencing industry. MARKETING Forgent has developed a comprehensive marketing/communications plan designed to establish credibility and trust, as well as brand recognition, for the Company as well as its software and services. This program integrates media relations, industry analyst relations, investor relations and other corporate communications activities to ensure a consistent and accurate flow of information to and from our key stakeholders and target audiences. Early efforts have been focused on developing clear and concise methods of communicating with shareholders, customers, prospects, trade and technical media and influencers, and the business media. Forgent's corporate Web site will play an important role in providing audiences with the most up-to-date and accurate information available on our people, services, software, success, trends and issues the Company faces. PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS The United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued the Company more than 35 patents covering a broad range of interest including, but not limited to, videoconferencing, data compression, and video mail. The Company currently has in excess of 38 patent applications in similar fields of interest that are filed but not yet issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Seven of these patent applications, related to the new technology of video end-point management, were filed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and we are on track to complete filing on ten more patent applications by the end of the first quarter in fiscal 2002. We intend to file more patents to protect our intellectual property and anticipate an average of five filed patents to be issued per quarter to Forgent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, starting in the near future. There can be no assurance that the pending patents will be issued or that issued patents can be defended successfully. With the successful sale of the products division, Forgent will own the rights to all patents. The Company's Strategic Patent Program, headed by the leadership of Chief Intellectual Property Officer, Gordon Matthews, stimulates the creation of the Company's intellectual property. Mr. Matthews, a board member since 1994 as well as a named inventor on more than 35 U.S. and foreign patents, directs the program to manage the Company's portfolio of patents, to lead an internal patent committee representing all functions in the Company, to empower all employees to develop intellectual property, and to reward those employees who generate the ideas. In addition to the Strategic Patent Program, Forgent is also initiating an active program for licensing its intellectual property. 5\n\nThe Company has been issued two trademarks and two service marks by the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office covering the \"VTEL\" mark and our logo as well as trademarks and service marks issued by certain foreign countries and entities. Applications for other trademarks, including the \"Forgent\" mark are currently pending both in the United States and abroad. EMPLOYEES With the announcement of the New Charter on August 23, 2000, we also announced the restructuring of our organization, which involved the termination of approximately 200 employees or 34% of our workforce. As we further defined our business strategy during fiscal 2001, we identified certain elements that did not contribute our core competencies and therefore restructured our Company in August 2001, which involved the termination of approximately 65 employees or 17% of our workforce. As a result of the August 2001 restructuring, we employed 312 employees as follows:\n\nNUMBER OF FUNCTION EMPLOYEES Sales and marketing 74 Research and development 66 Service, support and Systems integration 96 Manufacturing 37 Finance and administration 39 --------- Total 312 =========\n\nOnce the sale of the Products business unit is completed, Forgent will employ approximately 200 employees. Despite the workforce reductions, we believe that we retained the appropriate employees to fully implement our business strategy and that our current employee relations are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Forgent's development, management of its growth and other activities depend on the efforts of key management and technical employees. Competition for such personnel is intense. We use incentives, including competitive compensation and stock option plans, to attract and retain well-qualified employees and generally do not have employment agreements with key management personnel or technical employees. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to effectively attract, retain, train, motivate and manage our employees. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to attract and retain personnel with the requisite capabilities and experience. The loss of one or more of our key management or technical personnel could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results. EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Our executive officers are as follows: RICHARD N. SNYDER, age 56, joined the Company's Board of Directors in December of 1997 and became Chairman of the Board in March 2000.

PROPERTIES Forgent's headquarters, product development, and sales and marketing facility leases approximately 139,000 square feet in Austin, Texas under a lease which expires in March 2013. During fiscal 1999, we reduced the workforce of the Company and as a result were able to sublet approximately 15,000 square feet during the later part of fiscal 1999 and the first quarter of fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2001, we subleased an additional 26,000 square feet in order to consolidate space and take advantage of a favorable real estate market in the Austin area. Forgent's Professional Services group occupies a facility of approximately 41,000 square feet in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania vicinity which is leased through June 2006. We believe that the facilities in Texas and Pennsylvania are adequate to meet our current requirements, and that suitable additional space will be available, as needed, to accommodate further physical expansion of corporate and development operations and for additional sales and marketing offices. The Company also occupies approximately 60,000 square feet of a facility that is situated in a light industrial area in Austin, Texas where our manufacturing, training and spare parts depot are located. As part of the sale agreement of the Products unit, Forgent will assign this lease to the new company, VTEL Product, who will assume all obligations under the existing lease. Forgent leased 52,500 square feet in Sunnyvale, California under a lease that expired in April 2008. This property housed some of our research and development group as well as our OnScreen24 operations. During fiscal 2001, Forgent reached an agreement with the landlord and sold its equity interest in the real estate lease. Forgent is no longer liable for the remaining lease payments. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is the defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse affect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS None 7\n\nPART II. ITEM 5.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY RESULT OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items in Forgent's consolidated statement of operations:\n\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 1999 2000 2001 Services revenues 64.4% 60.2% 66.5% Integration and other revenues 35.6 39.8 33.5 Gross margin 36.6 28.6 21.7 Selling, general and administrative 39.7 42.4 51.5 Research and development 0.0 18.7 19.5 Total operating expenses 44.5 80.6 77.6 Other income, net 0.1 97.9 17.0 (Loss) income from continuing operations (7.6) 44.5 (38.0) (Loss) income from discontinued operations (26.2) (39.4) (44.3) Net (loss) income (33.8)% 5.1% (85.3)%\n\n9\n\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 1999, 2000, AND 2001. Revenues Consolidated revenue was $46.1 million in fiscal 1999, $45.2 million in fiscal 2000, and $38.2 million in fiscal 2001. The decline was $0.9 million from 1999 to 2000 and $7.1 million from 2000 to 2001. This is a decrease of 1.9% for 2000 and 15.6% for 2001. Consolidated revenue represents the combined revenues of Forgent's, formerly VTEL Solution's, business, which provides network consulting, installation, training, and maintenance services as well as custom videoconferencing integration solutions, and multi-vendor products. Consolidated revenues do not include any revenues from our discontinued Products business, which engages in the manufacture and sale of endpoint systems (see Note 17, in the accompanying financial statements). Service revenue was $29.7 million in fiscal 1999, $27.2 million in fiscal 2000, and $25.4 million in fiscal 2001. The decline was $2.5 million from 1999 to 2000 and $1.8 million from 2000 to 2001. This is a decrease of 8.4% for 2000 and 6.8% for 2001. Service represents 64.4%, 60.2%, and 66.5% of total revenues for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Despite significant declining product revenues from our discontinued operations, revenue streams from network consulting, installation, training and maintenance contracts have been relatively stable, which reflects our customers' confidence in the quality of our service performance. Customers' confidence is confirmed further by the renewal of their maintenance contracts. During the last two quarters of fiscal 2001 we achieved significant increases in our service bookings, which will lead to future service revenues. As Forgent demonstrates its expertise in providing visual communications solutions using a wider array of visual communications products, we believe our service bookings will continue to increase through customers' renewals and new contracts. Revenue from integration solutions and other was $16.4 million, $18.0 million, and $12.8 million in fiscal 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. The increase was $1.6 million from 1999 to 2000 and the decrease was $5.2 million from 2000 to 2001. This is an increase of 9.9% for 2000 and a decrease of 28.9% for 2001. Integration solutions and other represent 35.6%, 39.8% and 33.5% of total revenues for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. Although we experienced an increase in integration and other revenues in fiscal 2000, integration and other revenues were down in fiscal 2001 primarily due to a change in business strategy. In previous fiscal years, VTEL derived approximately half of its integration revenue from sales through its channels. Under the new charter as announced in August 2000, VTEL Solutions sold integrated solutions directly to the marketplace while VTEL Products continued selling existing integrated systems, also referred to as pre-designed systems, via the channels. The cycle time for selling new integrated solutions was significantly longer than selling existing integrated systems and the direct sales did not replace the channel sales as quickly as anticipated, which led to the decline in integrated revenues in fiscal 2001. As \"Forgent,\" the Company will return to its channel partners, leading with visual communications services instead of videoconferencing products. These services will include integrated solutions and focus on all available visual communications products, not only VTEL products. Forgent will be channel-focused with select direct sales targeted in certain geographic marketplaces that do not have any dominant channels. Additionally, during the year ended July 31, 2001, Forgent created the Multi-Vendor Partners Program(TM) (\"MVP\"), which allows the Company to market and distribute a variety of third-party manufactured equipment to optimize connectivity in a variety of network environments. The Company recognized $1.5 million in product revenue that was generated from MVP during fiscal 2001. Gross margin Consolidated gross margins were $16.9 million in fiscal 1999, $12.9 million in fiscal 2000, and $8.3 million in fiscal 2001. The decline was $4.0 million from 1999 to 2000 and $4.6 million from 2000 to 2001. This is a decrease of 23.5% for 2000 and 35.7% for 2001. Consolidated gross margin percentages were 37% for fiscal 1999, 29% for fiscal 2000, and 22% for fiscal 2001. The Company's margins are primarily generated from service revenues. Since the costs associated with our service and maintenance business is relatively fixed, the gross margins are directly affected by the level of revenue generated from new and renewed service contracts. As Forgent, we offer our service capabilities to a broader range of third-party visual communications products, which is resulting in increased service bookings. Therefore, we anticipate that as our service revenues grow, our margins will strengthen. However, there can be no assurance our sales levels will increase. Additionally, we have successfully restructured our business in August 2001 (see Note 18, in the accompanying financial statements) in order to minimize these relatively fixed costs, which cost reductions were designed to improve our margins. 10\n\nAs well as being subject to relatively fixed costs, gross margins from integration revenues are also subject to product mix shifts based on the types of integration solutions we produce. During fiscal 2001 margins from integrated revenues decreased primarily due to the decrease in the overall integration revenues in addition to reduced pre-designed systems sales and increased sales of customized systems at lower margins. The decline in integration margins during fiscal 2000 was attributable to a higher percentage of larger custom integration projects that generated higher revenues yet lower gross margins. Despite declining gross margins, Forgent has resized its infrastructure in fiscal 2002 to more closely match projected revenue levels. Additionally, the integration business acts as a conduit to deliver service maintenance contracts on the visual communications solutions we deliver. Since service revenues do not carry the associated cost of sales that product sales do, and since we have restructured our business, we believe a predominately service-based business model has the potential to provide greater overall profitability. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses were $18.3 million in fiscal 1999, $19.2 million in fiscal 2000, and $19.7 million in fiscal 2001. The increase was $0.9 million from 1999 to 2000 and $0.5 million from 2000 to 2001. This is an increase of 4.8% for 2000 and 2.5% for 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 39.7%, 42.4% and 51.5% of revenues for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. Although total selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses have remained relatively flat during the past three fiscal years, SG&A expenses related to Forgent's operations have actually decreased each year. The SG&A expenses incurred by the Internet subsidiaries, which were folded back into the core operations during fiscal 2001, were $2.0 million and $2.8 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Without the effect of the Internet ventures, total SG&A expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 5.9%, from 1999 to 2000 and $0.4 million, or 2.1%, from 2000 to 2001. SG&A as a percentage of revenues increased each year although total SG&A expenses remained relatively constant against a declining level of revenues. During our years of significant revenue growth, our sales and marketing infrastructure was designed to support a growing business. Although we took measures to reduce costs during fiscal 1999 (see \"Restructuring Activities\"), we had projected that our revenue levels would increase and therefore continued certain strategies in anticipation of further growth. In efforts to find efficiencies and to significantly reduce our administrative costs as a percent of expected revenues, we reexamined our overall staffing needs and restructured our operations in August 2001. We will record a one-time charge of approximately $0.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 for the restructuring. Additionally, we are replacing our Enterprise Reporting Platform (\"ERP\"), which includes the Company's accounting system. The combination of the restructuring and the replacement of the ERP will further reduce our annual administrative expenses by approximately $7.8 million. This savings will be offset by approximately $1.6 million as we expense the remaining value of the current accounting system over a short expected life. As we move into fiscal 2002, any expense not directly supporting the generation of revenues for Forgent remains under close scrutiny in order to prevent any unnecessary costs. Despite the cost reducing measures that we are undertaking, there can be no assurance that we will be able reduce costs enough to become profitable. Research and development Research and development expenses were $0.0 million in fiscal 1999, $8.5 million in fiscal 2000, and $7.4 million in fiscal 2001. The increase was $8.5 million from 1999 to 2000 and the decrease was $1.0 million from 2000 to 2001. This is an increase of 100.0% for 2000 and a decrease of 12.0% for 2001. Research and development expenses were 0.0%, 18.7%, and 19.5% of revenues for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001 respectively. During the year ended July 31, 2000, Forgent created two subsidiaries focused on the development and delivery of visual communication products and services over the Internet. In January of 2000, we announced the formation of OnScreen24 which was comprised primarily of Forgent research and development engineers who developed visual communication delivery products for use over the Internet, including products such as video mail as well as the further development of our web streaming product line, Turbocast(TM), which utilizes the technology acquired in our acquisition of Vosaic during fiscal 1999. In March of 2000, we announced the formation of ArticuLearn, which created and managed custom e-learning portals that enable organizations to create, deliver and manage their learning content directly online. In addition, ArticuLearn offered various professional services to assist 11\n\norganizations in the production of their web-based learning content. During the years ended July 31, 2000 and July 31, 2001, the Company's two Internet subsidiaries incurred $8.5 million and $5.1 million in research and development expenses, respectively. Due to the weakening environment for start-up businesses and related tightening of the venture capital marketplace, the Company absorbed its OnScreen24 operations back into the operations of its core business and terminated ArticuLearn during fiscal 2001. Without the effects of the Internet ventures, the Company incurred $2.3 million in research and development expenses during fiscal 2001 and no research and development expenses during fiscal 2000 or fiscal 1999. These expenses, which represent 6.1% of revenue in fiscal 2001, are related to the development of a network management software and are net of $0.6 million capitalized in fiscal 2001. Software development costs are capitalized after a product is determined to be technologically feasible and is in the process of being developed for market. At the time the product is released, the capitalized software is amortized over the estimated economic life of the related projects. The research and development costs capitalized during fiscal 2001 relates to efforts on designing Forgent's Video Network Platform (\"Forgent VNP\"), an enterprise-class server software that allows enterprises control over video networks. Efforts on Forgent VNP will continue to be capitalized until the end of this calendar year when the product is scheduled to be released to the market. Our ability to successfully develop software solutions to visually enable broadband networks will be a significant factor in Forgent's success. As we develop our research and development strategy, we anticipate additional costs associated with the recruiting and retention of engineering professionals adept at broadband technologies. We will attempt to maintain research and development expenses at reasonable levels in terms of percentage of revenue. However, we believe our ultimate future success is based primarily on our commitment to the new business strategy and the success of Forgent VNP. Write-down of Impaired Assets During fiscal year 2001 management implemented a strategy to divest all non-core operations to focus the business strategy to management software and services. Therefore, the Company folded its OnScreen24 subsidiary's operations back into the core business. OnScreen24 primarily operated from our property in Sunnyvale, California. During the third fiscal quarter the Company sold its equity interest in the real estate lease for $500,000 and recorded a related $1.1 million impairment for the leasehold improvements at the Sunnyvale facility. The $1.1 milllion impairment in fiscal 2001 was all related to continuing operations. As a result of the New Charter announced in August 2000, we reviewed certain long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles and capitalized software, to evaluate the recoverability of these assets pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (\"SFAS\") No. 121 \"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of.\" The evaluation indicated that the future undiscounted cash flows related to certain long-lived assets were below the carrying value of the assets associated with their future operations. Further, the closure of certain foreign offices and the termination of the software capitalization projects resulted in the identification of only minimal future cash flows. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we adjusted the long-lived assets associated with our manufacturing operations and the long-lived assets related to the foreign operations and capitalized software. We calculated the fair value for the long-lived assets based on anticipated future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $14.1 million. This impairment loss was recorded on the consolidated statement of operations as follows:\n\nCONTINUING DISCONTINUED TOTAL OPERATIONS OPERATIONS IMPAIRMENT (in thousands) Capitalized Software $ 5,120 $ 664 $ 5,784 Property, plant and equipment 1,909 3,983 5,892 Intangible Assets 332 1,908 2,240 Other -- 156 156 ------------ ------------ ------------ $ 7,361 $ 6,711 $ 14,072 ============ ============ ============\n\nThe remaining useful lives of certain assets were shortened and thus, depreciation and amortization for these assets were slightly higher in subsequent fiscal years. 12\n\nAmortization of Intangibles Amortization expenses were $1.3 million in fiscal 1999, $1.4 million in fiscal 2000, and $1.4 million in fiscal 2001. The expenses relate to the amortization of goodwill resulting from certain acquisitions. In March 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Vosaic LLP, an Internet video software and technology company, which included technology presently being incorporated into Forgent's VNP product. In November 1995, the Company acquired certain assets and a specified work force of the Integrated Communications Systems Group (\"ICS\") of Peirce-Phelps, Inc., which has developed into the Forgent services business. The Company acquired certain assets of the videoconferencing division of one of its German resellers in July 1998. The goodwill related to the German acquisition was fully amortized during fiscal 2001. Effective August 1, 2001, the Company chose early adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (\"SFAS\") No. 142, \"Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets,\" which recognizes that since goodwill and certain intangible assets may have indefinite useful lives, these assets are no longer required to be amortized but are to be evaluated at least annually for impairment. The Company anticipates an annual expense reduction of $1.3 million from adoption of SFAS No. 142. Restructuring Activities In November 1998, management adopted a restructuring plan that was intended to match the size and complexity of the organization with our planned business approach and recorded a charge of $0.9 million in fiscal 1999. The plan included the involuntary reduction of employees from all departments and was effective immediately for most employees upon announcement. We also made the decision to reduce our operating costs by exiting other activities and reducing related overhead costs. All of the termination benefits were paid and closure costs were incurred by October 31, 1999. Non-Recurring Events On March 3, 2000 the Company settled a lawsuit pending in the 126th Judicial District Court in Travis County, Texas in which VTEL had previously initiated against five former employees who left VTEL in September 1996 to form Via Video Communications, Inc. (\"Via Video\"). Via Video was subsequently acquired by Polycom, Inc. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the former employees of VTEL paid $2.5 million in cash and delivered to VTEL 300,800 shares of common stock of Polycom, Inc. in settlement of the claims asserted by VTEL. These shares were sold during fiscal 2000 for $33.7 million, net of settlement costs. The parties agreed to dismiss all claims and counterclaims and third party claims in the lawsuit, ending the litigation. Separately, VTEL voluntarily dismissed Polycom, Inc. and Via Video from the case without consideration. On March 3, 2000, the Company granted non-exclusive licenses to Polycom, Inc. (\"Polycom\") to use three of its patented technologies, and Polycom paid a one time fee of $8.3 million to VTEL as a fully paid up royalty in exchange for such license. In turn and without any payments by VTEL, Polycom also has granted VTEL a non-exclusive sublicense to its rights under its license agreement with Brown University pertaining to its single camera tracking technology. Through this technology exchange, the parties have access to specified distinctive technologies of the other for use in their product offerings. Interest income and expense Interest income was $0.8 million in fiscal 1999, $1.2 million in fiscal 2000, and $1.2 million in fiscal 2001. The increase was $0.4 million from 1999 to 2000 and $0.04 million from 2000 to 2001. This is an increase of 50% for 2000 and 0% for 2001. Interest income was 1.7%, 2.6%, and 3.2% of revenues for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001. Changes in interest income are based on interest rates earned on invested cash and cash balances available for investment. The slight increase in interest income during fiscal 2001 is due primarily to a higher average cash balance held for investment in fiscal 2001 than in fiscal 2000. The increase in interest income during fiscal 2000 is the result of an increase in the cash balance due to income from non-recurring events. 13\n\nIncome taxes As of July 31, 2001, Forgent had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $139.6 million, research and development credit carryforwards of $5.8 million, and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $0.3 million. The net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from 2002 through 2021, if not utilized. Minimum tax credit carryforwards do not expire and carry forward indefinitely. Net operating losses related to our foreign subsidiaries of $5.3 million are available to offset future foreign taxable income. However, significant permanent limitations may apply to the use of these losses based upon laws of the foreign tax jurisdictions. As a result of various acquisitions completed in prior years, utilization of our net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the \"change in ownership\" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization. Also, due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of its favorable tax attributes in future tax returns, we have placed a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset. Accordingly, no deferred tax benefits have been recorded for the tax years ended July 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001. The valuation allowance increased by $11.2 million during the year ended July 31, 2001. Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes In May 2001, the Company adopted a formal plan to sell the operations and certain assets of its VTEL Products business unit, including the VTEL name. Accordingly, the Products business has been accounted for and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. Loss from discontinued operations was $12.1 million in fiscal 1999, $17.8 million in fiscal 2000, and $16.9 million in fiscal 2001. Loss from discontinued operations was 26.2%, 39.4% and 44.3% of revenues for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. In October 2001, Forgent signed a definitive agreement to sell the Products business unit to a management team led by one of the Company's executive officers, Bob Swem (see Note 18, in the accompanying financial statements). Loss on disposal, net of income taxes In preparation of the sale of the Products business unit, Forgent recorded a $1.1 million loss on disposal as of July 31, 2001. The loss is primarily related to legal and consulting fees associated with the sale. Net income (loss) Net loss was $15.6 million in fiscal 1999; net income was $2.3 million in fiscal 2000; and net loss was $32.5 million in fiscal 2001. The increase was $17.9 million from 1999 to 2000 and the decrease was $34.8 million. Net (loss) income was (33.8%), 5.1%, and (85.3%) of revenues for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. During the fiscal 2001 we have taken steps to eliminate both unprofitable and non-strategic investments and have established a new business strategy to grow the visual communication solutions business. These steps include terminating our Internet ventures, which incurred $16.4 million and $9.5 million in net losses for the years ended July 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Additionally, we have resized our infrastructure to more closely match our projected revenue and we signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell our Products business unit, subject to shareholders' approval in the second fiscal quarter of 2002. Therefore, in fiscal 2002 as cost reduction efforts are realized and sales from Forgent VNP are achieved, the Company is poised for future profitability. Leveraging off the strengths of our existing services, integration and development teams to offer visual communication solutions for the emerging broadband marketplace, we believe we are focused on the strategy to return to profitability. However, there is no assurance that our new business strategy will be successful or profitable. 14\n\nOther factors affecting results of operations Forgent's future results of operations and financial condition could be impacted by many factors, but our ability to implement our new strategy is critical to our future success. Factors that could affect our success are other competitors entering the same market, technical problems in delivering video solutions over broadband networks, and slow adoption to videoconferencing over broadband networks. Due to these factors and others noted elsewhere in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our past earnings and stock price have been, and future earnings and stock price potentially may be, subject to significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis. Past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors are cautioned in using historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Any shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant effect on the trading price of Forgent's Common Stock in any given period. Also, we participate in a highly dynamic industry that often contributes to the volatility of Forgent's Common Stock price. Liquidity and capital resources Cash provided by operating activities was $2.3 million in fiscal 1999; cash provided by operating activities was $52.1 million in fiscal 2000; and cash used in operating activities was $4.9 million in fiscal 2001. The increase was $49.8 million from 1999 to 2000 and the decrease was $57.0 million from 2000 to 2001. At July 31, 2001, we had working capital of $13.8 million, including $22.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Changes in cash from operating activities are primarily the result of the net losses or income generated and changes in working capital, primarily increases and decreases in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and deferred revenues. The OnScreen24 and ArticuLearn operations required significant funding from the Company. The liquidation of both these subsidiaries, as well as the completion of the Company's restructuring efforts, will improve the cash requirements from operations. The Company eliminated its cash burn during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and management believes the Company is in the position to generate cash from operations in fiscal 2002. Included in net income for fiscal 2000 was the favorable settlement of litigation in which the Company received $44.5 million in cash and securities (see \"Non-recurring events\"). Cash provided by investing activities was $0.5 million in fiscal 1999; cash used in investing activities was $32.3 million in fiscal 2000; and cash provided by investing activities was $21.9 million in fiscal 2001. During the year ended July 31, 2001, the Company owned common stock shares of Accord Networks (\"Accord\"), a networking equipment manufacturer, which were converted to Polycom, Inc. (\"Polycom\") common stock shares as a result of Polycom's acquisition of Accord. The cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the proceeds received from the sale of the Polycom and Accord shares and other short-term investments. During fiscal 2000, the cash used in investing activities was primarily from the investment of cash received from the settlement of litigation (see \"Non-recurring events\"). Investments were also made in additional property and equipment and capitalized research and development. During fiscal 1999, the cash used in investing activities was spent primarily to complete the acquisition of property and equipment and to capitalize the costs associated with the research and development of our visual communication software. These expenditures were partially offset by the net sale and maturity of short-term investments. Cash provided by financing activities was $8.0 million in fiscal 1999; cash used in financing activities was $11.0 million in fiscal 2000; and cash used in financing activities was $0.6 million in fiscal 2001. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2001 primarily relates to the Company settling its remaining notes payable. As of July 31, 2001, the Company did not have any outstanding debt. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended July 31, 2000 relates to the repayment of cash borrowed under the line of credit and payment on notes payable. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended July 31, 1999 relates to borrowings under our line of credit and was offset by the purchase of treasury stock and payments on notes payable. During fiscal 1999 we initiated a stock repurchase program and repurchased 526,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock for $2.3 million. The repurchased shares were used to fulfill requirements for the Company's stock including stock option exercises or stock issuances under business combination transactions. In April 2001 we announced a stock repurchase program to purchase up to two million shares of the Company's stock. During fiscal 2001 the Company repurchased 87,400 shares for $0.1 million, including fees. We anticipate repurchasing additional shares during fiscal 2002, depending on the Company's cash position, market conditions and other factors. Forgent's principal sources of liquidity at July 31, 2001 consist of $22.0 million of cash, cash equivalents 15\n\nand short-term investments, and the ability to generate cash from operations. The $22.0 million includes $1.7 million in stock of Polycom, a networking equipment manufacturer. We have recorded the related unrealized gain of $1.5 million as part of other comprehensive income and included the asset as part of short-term investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at July 31, 2001. The 76,625 shares of Polycom were sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 under a cash flow hedge and resulted in a cash inflow of $1.8 million. Our capital budget for fiscal 2001 was $3.0 million, which was not fully utilized as we reduced capital expenditures. Our capital budget for fiscal 2002 is $2.0 million, which will be used principally to invest in development tools, sales and marketing demonstration equipment, and on going operational requirements. In March 2000, we repaid the outstanding balance on our line of credit with a banking syndicate. At July 31, 2001, we did not have a line of credit in place. Based on the Company's strong cash position, management does not anticipate acquiring any additional lines of credit in the near future. Legal Matters Forgent is the defendant or plaintiff in various actions which arose in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse affect on our financial condition or results of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (\"SFAS\") No. 142, \"Goodwill and Other Intangibles Assets.\" SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Since the standard recognizes goodwill and certain intangible assets may have indefinite useful lives, these assets are no longer required to be amortized but are evaluated at least annually for impairment. Intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives, but without constraint of an arbitrary ceiling. Effective August 1, 2001, the Company chose early adoption of SFAS No. 142 and anticipates an annual expense reduction of $1.3 million. On August 31, 2000 the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\" SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative depends upon whether it has been designated in a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship pursuant to SFAS No. 133. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized each period in earnings. Hedging relationships are established pursuant to the Company's risk management policies, and are initially and regularly evaluated to determine whether they are expected to be, and have been, highly effective hedges. If a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively, and future changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in earnings each period. For derivatives designated as hedges of the variability of cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedges), the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged items affect earnings. Gains or losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with terminated derivatives remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged items affect earnings. Forecasted transactions designated as the hedged items in cash flow hedges are regularly evaluated to assess that they continue to be probable of occurring, and if the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, any gain or loss deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income is recognized in earnings currently. During fiscal 2001 the Company utilized forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to the European Euro and the Australian Dollar. The changes in these contracts are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company also utilized derivatives designated as cash flow hedges to ensure a minimum level of cashflows as related to its investment in the Polycom stock. The amount of ineffectiveness with respect to these cash flow hedges was not material. These hedges were recorded at fair value on the Consolidated 16\n\nBalance Sheet, under the caption short-term investments and will result in a $1.7 million reclass from other comprehensive income to earnings in first quarter fiscal 2002. In December 1999, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (\"SAB\") 101, \"Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,\" which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. SAB 101, as amended by SAB 101A and SAB 101B, outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and presents guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies. Forgent adopted SAB 101 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a material impact on our revenue recognition policies. In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44, \"Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation\", which further clarifies APB Opinion No. 25, \"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\". This Interpretation clarifies (a) the definition of employee for purposes of applying Opinion 25, (b) the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, (c) the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award, and (d) the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. This Interpretation did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position. Cautionary Statement Regarding Risks and Uncertainties That May Affect Future Results Certain portions of this report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current expectations regarding future results of operations, economic performance, financial condition and achievements. Whenever possible, Forgent attempted to identify these forward-looking statements with the words \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates\" and other similar expressions. These statements reflect management's current plans and expectations that rely on a number of assumptions and estimates that are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to our ability to execute the business strategy as outlined above, rapid changes in technology, unexpected changes in customer order patterns or order mix, the intensity of competition, economic conditions, the cost and availability of certain key components, pricing pressures, interest rates fluctuations, changes in the capital markets, litigation involving intellectual property, changes in tax and other laws and governmental rules applicable to Forgent's business and other risks indicated in Forgent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties are beyond the Company's control, and in many cases, management cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We identify our principal market risks as interest rate risk related to short-term investments and the market value of our Polycom investment (see Liquidity and capital resources). Interest rate exposure with regard to our investments is minor due to the short-term nature of our investments. We previously invested in Accord Networks (\"Accord\") an Israeli-based manufacturer of networking equipment. In June of 2000, Accord filed an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock exchange in which VTEL was apportioned 1.3 million shares. In February 2001, Accord was acquired by Polycom and VTEL's investment in Accord converted to 399,000 shares of Polycom. The company sold 246,000 shares and then entered into a cash flow hedge to ensure a minimum level of cash flow from the 153,000 remaining shares. These hedges settled in July and October 2001, resulting in net cash flows of $1.8 and $1.8 million, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes. Accordingly, we historically utilized forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure on firm commitments. The principal currencies hedged during fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001 were the Euro and Australian dollar. The amount of unrealized gain or (loss) related to these contracts was ($18,000), $38,000 and $0 for fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. As of July 31, 2001 the Company held no foreign currency contracts. 17\n\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nReports of Independent Auditors and Accountants 20 Financial Statements: Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 31, 2000 and 2001 22 Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 23 Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 24 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 25 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 26 Financial Statement Schedule: Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts 48 Schedules other than those listed above have been omitted since they are either not required, not applicable or the information is otherwise included\n\n19\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of VTEL Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of VTEL Corporation as of July 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the fiscal years then ended.

STATEMENTS (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. THE COMPANY VTEL Corporation, doing business as Forgent Corporation (Forgent, the Company, we or our), visually enables broadband networks through our existing expertise by providing top-rate services to the visual communications industry, regardless of brand, and by developing neutral network management software for rich media networks. Forgent's services and software are designed to improve industry wide multi-vendor platform interoperability as well as improve video network management and reliability standards throughout the industry. On August 23, 2000, the Company announced a new business charter that is intended to shift its core business model from the manufacture of videoconferencing endpoints to a provider of premier enterprise solutions and services for visually enabling broadband networks. The Company's vast experience in the industry indicated that videoconferencing would not reach the broad-based market appeal necessary for overall growth through the production of videoconferencing endpoints alone. We will leverage our service and software expertise in the deployment and management of videoconferencing endpoints by continuing to actively market our ability to integrate, install and service a wide offering of third-party products, including the products of companies that were traditional competitors when our focus was hardware. Management has decided to focus our efforts on our Solutions business and to exit our Products business. Therefore, we announced in May 2001 that the Company intended to sell its Products business unit and rename the remaining Solutions business unit as Forgent Corporation, subject to the execution and consummation of a sale agreement and shareholder approval. The Company executed the sale agreement in early October 2001 and is intending to submit the sale of the Products business to our shareholders at our 2001 annual meeting. To facilitate the change, special attention is being paid to improving the interoperability of all the components in a broadband video network, to expanding the Company's current interoperability labs to create a center of excellence for standards testing and integration and to developing and introducing enterprise videoconferencing software that provides a high level of manageability, reliability and ease-of-use for existing and new enterprise systems. We believe we must provide network software and services that will support the vast amount of visual communication applications that are becoming possible with increased bandwidth. Furthermore, the development and expansion of our consulting and services competencies is focused upon ultimately transforming the majority of our revenue base from endpoint products to a software and solutions centric provider. We feel that refocusing our efforts will provide the greatest opportunity for long-term success for Forgent and its shareholders. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of Forgent's wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant estimates made by management include the loss from discontinued operations, the provision for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory write-downs for potentially excess or obsolete inventory, warranty reserves, the valuation allowance for the gross deferred tax asset, contingency reserves, lives of fixed assets, the amortization period for intangible assets and the determination of the fair value of its long-lived assets. Actual amounts could differ from the estimates made. Management periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements for continued reasonableness. Appropriate adjustments, if any, to the estimates used are made prospectively based upon such periodic evaluation. 26\n\nVTEL CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Revenue Recognition Service and integration revenues are recognized at the time the services are rendered and the Company has no significant further obligations to the customer. Revenues for extended warranty contracts are recorded over the contract period. Customer prepayments are deferred until services have been rendered and there are no significant further obligations to the customer. In general, the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, service delivery has occurred, fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. Warranty Costs Forgent generally warrants against software defects for ninety days from the date of installation. Additionally, the Company guarantees its products against hardware defects for one year from the date of installation, but not to exceed fifteen months from date of shipment. The Company provides currently for the estimated costs which may be incurred in the future under the warranty program. Software Development Costs Costs incurred in connection with the development of software products are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (\"SFAS\") No. 86, \"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.\" Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to research and development expense. Amortization of capitalized software begins upon initial product shipment. Software development costs are amortized over the estimated life of the related product (generally thirty months), using the straight-line method. The Company capitalized internal software development costs of $3,064, $3,945, and $617 for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. No amortization of such costs was recorded for the years ended July 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. In addition, during the year ended July 31, 2000 management made the decision to discontinue further development efforts and abandoned certain projects previously capitalized. The resulting charge of $5,120 was included in the write-down of impaired assets during the year ended July 31, 2000 (see Note 13).
