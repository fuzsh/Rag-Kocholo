These formats enable SIP phones and gateways to report the quality of every call made, allowing you to monitor end-to-end quality for your VoIP activity. You can use AppManager for SIP Server to monitor Quality of Service (QoS) data from a variety of SIP servers, such as Avaya Session Manager.\n\nWe hope you continue to help us ensure that our products meet all your needs. You can post feedback in the AppManager forum on NetIQ Communities, our online community that also includes product information, blogs, and links to helpful resources.\n\nThe documentation for this product is available on the NetIQ Web site in HTML and PDF formats on a page that does not require you to log in. If you have suggestions for documentation improvements, click comment on this topic at the bottom of any page in the HTML version of the documentation posted at the AppManager Modules page. To download this module, log into the AppManager Module Upgrades & Trials page.\n\nWhat's New?\n\nThis initial release of AppManager for SIP Server includes the following features:\n\nReceive, process, and raise alerts on Quality of Service (QoS) packets from SIP servers. This module lets you to monitor end-to-end quality for your VoIP activity using RFC6035 voice quality reports.\n\nMonitor calls for a range of quality metrics. These metrics include jitter, latency, packet loss, MOS (Mean Opinion Score), and R-Value\n\nUse Discovery_SIPServer to create a supplemental database. This database stores call detail records, including voice quality reports. You can also create the supplemental database with the SIPServer_SetupSupplementalDB Knowledge Script.\n\nThis release includes the following Knowledge Scripts:\n\nDiscovery_SIPServer: Discovers a SIP Server and its resources. Depending on your environment, you can discover a SIP server either by SNMP query or by manual configuration.\n\nSIPServer_CallQuality: Monitors calls for quality metrics such as jitter, latency, packet loss, MOS (Mean Opinion Score), and R-Value.\n\nSIPServer_CollectCallData: Starts SIP call data collection, and monitors the collection of data once started.\n\nSIPServer_SetupSupplementalDB: Creates a supplemental database in which to store call detail records, including voice quality reports.\n\nSIPServer_UserAgentQuality: Collects real-time user agent voice-quality statistics, including Mean Opinion Score (MOS), R-Value, jitter, latency, and packet loss.\n\nThis module supports the following devices:\n\nAvaya Session Manager 6.3, 6.2, 6.1, and 6.0\n\nAvaya SIP phones capable of providing RFC6035 voice quality reports\n\nPolycom SIP phones capable of providing RFC6035 voice quality reports\n\nThis module might also support other RFC6035-compliant phones not included in the preceding list. If you need further information or if you have suggestions for devices not in the preceding list, contact Technical Support or your NetIQ sales team.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nFor the most recently updated list of supported application versions, see the AppManager Supported Products page. Unless noted otherwise, this module supports all updates, hotfixes, and service packs for the releases listed below.\n\nAppManager for SIP Server has the following system requirements:\n\nAppManager version 7.0 or later installed on the AppManager repository (QDB) computers, on each proxy agent computer, and on all console computers\n\nNote Support for Windows Server 2008 on AppManager 7.x requires AppManager Windows Agent hotfix 71704 or later. For more information, see the AppManager Suite Hotfixes page.\n\nOne of the following Microsoft operating systems installed on the proxy agent computers:\n\nWindows Server 2012\n\nWindows Server 2008 R2\n\nWindows Server 2008 (32-bit and 64-bit)\n\nWindows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit)\n\nWindows Server 2003 (32-bit and 64-bit)\n\nAppManager for Microsoft Windows module, version 7.6.170.0 or later, installed on the AppManager repository (QDB) computer, on all proxy agent computers, and on all console computers\n\nOne of the following versions of Microsoft SQL Server installed on each proxy agent computer:\n\nSQL Server 2012 or SQL Server 2012 Express\n\nSQL Server 2008 R2 (32-bit and 64-bit)\n\nSQL Server 2008 (32-bit and 64-bit) or SQL Server 2008 Express (32-bit and 64-bit).\n\nSQL Server 2005 Service Pack 4 or SQL Server 2005 Express Service Pack 4.\n\nSQLXML 4.0 on the proxy agent computers\n\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.0 or later\n\nYou can download Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 from the Microsoft Download Center.\n\nYou can download Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 from the Microsoft Download Center.\n\nIf your version of Windows already includes Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5, go to the Add Roles and Features Wizard and select .NET Framework 4.5 and ASP.NET 4.5 under .NET Framework 4.5 Features. As a result of these selections, the TCP Port Sharing component required by this module is also selected. You can find this component below the WCF Services component under .NET Framework 4.5 Features in the Add Roles and Features Wizard.\n\nMicrosoft Core XML Services (MSXML) 6.0\n\nNote This component is required mainly for Windows 2003, as later versions of Windows have MSXML installed by default\n\nFor more information, see the AppManager for SIP Server Management Guide, included in the download package.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nContents of the Download Package\n\nAppManager for SIP Server includes a managed object, qNQSIPServer.dll, and Knowledge Scripts to discover and monitor SIP Server call data. The download package includes this readme, a management guide, Help for Knowledge Scripts, and several files that are used during installation:\n\nAM70-SIPServer-8.0.291.0.msi, the module installer.\n\nAM70-SIPServer-8.0.291.0.ini, a configuration file used with the AppManager setup program.\n\nAM70-SIPServer-8.0.291.0.xml, a configuration file used for deploying the module with Control Center. This is the file you check into the Control Center Web Depot.\n\nAM70-SIPServer-8.0.291.0-RepositoryFiles.exe, a compressed file that contains the QDB and console files. You do not need to run this file during installation.\n\nDefaultRule_SIPServer.xml, a configuration file used for deploying the module with Control Center.\n\nckSIPServer.exe, the pre-installation check used with the AppManager setup program.\n\nWhen you download the module, these files are copied by default to the local folder on the download computer. You should copy these files to the \\windows_installation\\setup\\Setup Files directory on the same distribution computer on which you saved your main AppManager software and documentation. By doing so, you maintain all AppManager software in one location that is easily accessible when you want to add more repositories, management servers, or agents.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nInstalling This Module\n\nRun the module installer to install the module components in the following locations:\n\nOn all proxy agent computers to install the agent components\n\nOn all console computers to install the Help and console extensions\n\nRun the module installer only once on each of these computers.\n\nYou must also install the Knowledge Scripts. You can install these module components to either local or remote QDBs. When installing to each QDB, select the option to install Knowledge Scripts, and then specify the SQL Server name of the server hosting the QDB, as well as the case-sensitive QDB name.\n\nNote Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 is required if you want to install the QDB component remotely from a Windows Server 2012 computer.\n\nImportant This release provides SQL stored procedures. To ensure module functionality, run the module installer for each QDB attached to Control Center.\n\nYou need to install Knowledge Scripts reports only once per QDB. The module installer now installs Knowledge Scripts for each module directly into the QDB instead of to the \\AppManager\\qdb\\kp folder as in previous releases.\n\nFor more information, see the AppManager for SIP Server Management Guide, included in the download package.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nKnown Issues\n\nNetIQ Corporation strives to ensure our products provide quality solutions for your enterprise software needs. The following issue is currently being researched. If you need further assistance with any issue, please contact Technical Support.\n\nThe Avaya (heritage-Nortel) Communication Sever 1000 (CS 1000) SIP Lines Gateway service does not support RFC6035 forwarding. As a result, Avaya and Polycom RFC6035-capable phones connected directly to the CS 1000 SIP Lines Gateway service do not generate QoS metrics even if the phones have been configured to do so. As a result, phones directly connected to a CS 1000 SIP Lines Gateway service will not show QoS statistics when you run the SIPServer_CallQuality or SIPServer_UserAgentQuality Knowledge Scripts. Phones that send RFC6035 directly and do not require forwarding, such as the Cisco SPA525G, are not affected. To work around this issue and set up QoS reporting with RFC6035-capable phones, connect the phone through Avaya Session Manager so the Session Manager forwards the QoS reports.

THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\na. \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n\nb. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\n\nc. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\n\nd. \"Original Author\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work.\n\ne. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\n\nf. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\na. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\n\nb. to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";;\n\nc. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n\nd. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.\n\ne. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:\n\ni. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\n\nii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n\nf. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\na. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n\nb. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\na. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above) from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\nb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\na. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\nb. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\nc. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nd. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n\ne. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\nNet-SNMP License\n\nVarious copyrights apply to this package, listed in various separate parts below.
