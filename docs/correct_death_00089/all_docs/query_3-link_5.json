Ramachandran, 70, who was chief minister of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and popularly known as MGR, died of a heart-attack. Hundreds of thousands of people jammed the streets of Chennai to reach the hall where the popular leader’s body lay. The police chief said he had given shoot-to-kill orders to check violence, where crowds set up roadblocks to enforce total mourning for their hero. Six people were killed in police firing and 15 people were admitted with serious bullet wounds. Police described the city as tense with all shops and offices closed and streets empty of vehicles. MGR shot to power after winning millions of hearts in the 1950s as the swashbuckling hero of some of 130 movies. He had been weak since suffering a stroke and kidney failure in 1984. He led the Tamil All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party and was Rajiv Gandhi’s only political ally in opposition-ruled south India."
