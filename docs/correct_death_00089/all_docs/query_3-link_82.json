Men and women wept, some shedding tears, while others broke into loud wails. Several mourners fainted from the heat and dehydration. Police said some of them had been keeping vigil outside the Apollo Hospital since Sunday and then walked to Rajaji Hall at daybreak.\n\nIn New Delhi, lawmakers observed a minute's silence Tuesday before both houses of Parliament were adjourned for the day in respect for the woman who many referred to as “Amma,” or mother.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi led the country in mourning Jayalalithaa's death, saying her death leaves a “huge void in Indian politics.” Modi was to arrive in Chennai later Tuesday to join mourners at Rajaji Hall.\n\nRoads leading to Chennai were clogged as people from remote villages poured into Tamil Nadu's capital to catch a last glimpse of their leader.\n\nSeven days of mourning were declared for Jayalalithaa, who was a five-time chief minister of the state. Schools and offices were closed after authorities declared public holidays for three days.\n\nHundreds of political leaders and film celebrities are expected to attend Jayalalithaa's funeral, scheduled for later Tuesday.\n\nJayalalithaa, 68, had been hospitalised since September, suffering from a fever, dehydration and a respiratory infection.\n\nAt the time, thousands of people prayed and fasted outside the hospital for her recovery. Doctors barred visitors, sparking rumors that they were withholding bad news out of fear it could trigger the same outpouring of grief, riots and suicides that followed the death of Jayalalithaa's political and acting mentor, M.G. Ramachandran.\n\nJayalalithaa was 13 when she began her film career and quickly became known as a romantic lead in many of the nearly 150 Tamil-language movies that she worked on.\n\nShe entered politics in the early 1980s, under the guidance of Ramachandran, and after his death in 1987 she declared herself his political heir and took control of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhgam party.\n\nPeople news in pictures\n\nShow all 18\n\nShe served as Tamil Nadu's chief minister, the highest elected position in the state of 71 million people, for nearly 14 years over five terms beginning in 1991. She regained her office last year after a corruption case against her was overturned by the court.\n\nJayalalithaa endeared herself to the poor and powerless with her policy of giving out handouts. Laptop computers and bicycles to students, spice grinders, free rice and subsidized food to the poor, cows and goats to farm women, enabling them to rise out of rural poverty. She pushed government officials and workers to promote health and education by handing out gold coins and awards to those who exceeded their goals.\n\nAlthough she was criticised by many who equated her handouts with bribery, she said it was her scheme to wipe out rural poverty. In return, she was loved by the poor who saw her as their charismatic benefactor.\n\n“She was their redeemer. Their saviour,” Vasanthi, a well-known Tamil writer and Jayalalithaa's biographer, wrote in the Indian Express.\n\nAP\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
