        "text": "In this Indian name, the name Maruthur Gopalan is a patronymic, not a family name, and the person should be referred to by the given name, Ramachandran.\n\nMaruthur Gopalan Ramachandran (Tamil: மருதூர் கோபாலன் இராமச்சந்திரன்‍) (17 January 1917 – 24 December 1987), popularly known by his initials MGR (Tamil: எம்.ஜி.ஆர்), was an Indian film actor, director, producer and politician.\n\nIn his youth, MGR and his elder brother, M. G. Chakrapani became members of a drama troupe to support their family. Influenced by Gandhian ideals, MGR joined the Indian National Congress. After a few years of acting in plays, he made his film debut in the 1936 film Sathi Leelavathi in a supporting role. In the late 1940s he graduated to leading roles and for the next three decades dominated the Tamil film industry.[1] He became a member of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and rose rapidly through its ranks. He successfully used his popularity as a film hero to build a large political base. In 1972, he left the DMK to form his own party the Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK). In 1977 he became the chief minister of Tamil Nadu - the first film actor in India to become the chief minister of a state. He remained as chief minister till his death in 1987.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, he has a reputation for philanthropism and is considered to be one of the greatest political leaders and actors of the state. He is idolized by his followers as Puratchi Thalaivar (lit. Revolutionary leader)[2][3][4][4] MGR was posthumously honoured with the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[5]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and background\n\n2 Acting career\n\n3 Political career\n\n3.1 Member of Legislative Assembly\n\n3.2 Chief Minister\n\n4 Awards\n\n5 Philanthropy\n\n6 Death\n\n7 Filmography\n\n7.1 As Actor\n\n7.2 As producer & director\n\n8 Gallery\n\n9 References\n\n10 External links\n\nEarly life and background\n\nMGR was born in Nawalapitiya near Kandy, British Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka),[6] to immigrant Malayali parents — Melakkath Gopala Menon and Maruthur Satyabhama. His family was originally from Vadavannur, Palakkad, Kerala, but his father had migrated with his family to Ceylon. Melakkath Gopala Menon had been excommunicated (bhrasht) during a Smarthavicharam in 1903, regarding an allegation that dealt with an illicit relationship with a widowed Brahmin woman;[7] and hence he left his family, and married Maruthur Satyabhama.[8][9]\n\nMGR was a Hindu and a devotee of Murugan, as is the common practice for Hindus in Sri Lanka.[10] This was during his early days. Later, when he joined the DMK,a pro-rationalist party,he followed the rationalist ideology, though not appearing very aggressively atheistic.However,in later days after he founded his own party following his expulsion from the DMK, he seems to have shown some leaning towards religious faith. He had asked his followers to pray for the success of his AIADMK party.[11]\n\nHis followers even prayed for him when it was determined that he had a kidney illness.[12] After his demise, his wife opened up a temple in his name.\n\nAfter his father's death, he joined a drama troupe called Original Boys. Later, he entered the world of cinema, becoming an actor, and later a director, producer, and editor. MGR married Bargavi also known as Thangamani who died early due to illness. He later married Sathanandavathi who also died soon due to Tuberculosis. M. G. R. married V. N. Janaki a former Tamil film actress as his third wife after the death of his second wife. Janaki divorced her husband Ganapati Bhat, to marry MGR.\n\nActing career\n\nHe made his film debut in 1935, in the film Sati Leelavati,[13] directed by Ellis Dungan, an American born film director.[14] Generally starring in romance or action films, MGR got his big breakthrough in the 1947 film Rajakumaari, written by M. Karunanidhi. Soon he rose to superstardom in the 1954 blockbuster Malaikallan. He acted as hero in the Tamil film industry's first ever colour movie, the 1955 blockbuster Ali Baba and the forty thieves. He rose to become the heart throb of millions of Indians with movies such as Anbe Vaa, Aayirathil Oruvan, Mahadevi, Panam Padaithavan, Ulagam Sutrum Vaalibhan, 'Adimaippenn, etc. He won the National Film Award for Best Actor for the film Rickshawkaran in 1972. His film Nadodi Mannan, which was a tamil version of the interpretation of the Prisoner of Zenda, was produced and directed by himself and released in 1956, ran to full houses. He began to act in many movies that appealed to the direct sentiments of the common man and the rich as well. His 1973 blockbuster Ulagam Sutrum Vaalibhan broke previous box office records. It was one of the few movies filmed abroad in those days. It was shot in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Japan. The DMK unsuccessfully tried to curtail that movie. His acting career ended in 1978 with his last movie, Madurai Meettu Sundara Pandian, which he acted when he was the Chief Minister of the state.He was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, in 1988 (posthumous).\n\nPolitical career\n\nMGR was a member of the Congress Party till 1953 and he used to wear Khādī. In 1953 MGR joined the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) with the help of M. Karunanidhi. He became a vocal Tamil and Dravidian nationalist and prominent member of the DMK] (\"Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam\" aka Dravidian Progressive Federation). He added glamour to the Dravidian movement which was sweeping Tamil Nadu. He became a member of the state Legislative Council in 1962. He was first elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1967. After the death of his mentor, Annadurai, MGR became the treasurer of DMK in 1969 after Karunanidhi became the chief minister.\n\nOn the 12th of January 1967, he was shot in the neck by fellow actor M.R. Radha.Both had worked together in 25 films together.When MGR was acting in the film Kaavalkaran in 1967 opposite Jayalalitha this incident happened. Petralthaan Pillaya was the last movie of MGR-MR Radha together, shooting which ended just few days before MGR was shot at.The bullet was permanently lodged in his neck and his voice damaged. Within hours of the shooting, some 50,000-odd fans had gathered at the hospital where MGR had been taken. People cried in the streets. For six weeks, he lay in the hospital as fans awaited each report of his health. He was visited by a steady stream of commoners and luminaries of film industry, polity and bureaucracy.From his hospital bed, he conducted his campaign for Madras Legislative Assembly. He won twice the number of votes polled by his Congress rival and the largest vote polled by any candidate for the Assembly.[15]\n\nIn 1972, DMK leader Karunanithi started to project his first son M.K.Muthu in a big way in film industry and also in politics. Understanding the tactics played by Karunanithi to corner him, MGR started to claim that corruption had grown within the party after the demise of Annadurai and in a public meeting asked for the financial details of the party to be publicised which enraged the leadership of DMK. Consequently, as expected, MGR was expelled from the party, and floated a new party named Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK), later renamed All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), the only powerful opponent of the DMK.He mobilised the period between 1972-1977 to spread and preach his party ambiition with films like Netru Indru Naalai(1974), Idhayakani(1975) etc..,. He became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu on the 30th of July 1977, remaining in office till his death in 1987. In 1979, members of his party Satyavani Muthu and Aravinda Bala Pajanor, became the first non-Congress politicians from Tamil Nadu to be ministers in the Union Cabinet. The AIADMK won every state assembly election as long as MGR was alive. Although Anna Durai as well as Karunanidhi had acted in stage plays in trivial roles, in their younger days, before becoming chief minister, MGR was the first popular film actor to be a Chief Minister in India.Though the Congress won by a small margin of votes with the DMK in the 1980 parliamentary elections, the AIADMK under MGR won the state elections the same year.This made the Congress to ally with the AIADMK in the 1984 elections.\n\nOnce he became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, he placed great emphasis on social development, especially education. One of his most successful policies was the introduction of the \"Mid-day Meal Scheme\" introduced by the popular Congress Chief Minister and Kingmaker K Kamaraj to a nutritious Mid-day Meal Scheme in the Government-run and aided schools in Tamil Nadu, which encouraged underprivileged children to attend schools. This scheme was at a cost of Rs.100 crore and was imposed in 1982. A little more than 12000000 citizens of the state were benefited. He also introduced Women's Special buses. He introduced Liquor ban in the state and Preservation of old temples and historical monuments, ultimately increasing the state's tourist income. He set up a free school for the Cinema Technicians children in Kodambakkam called MGR Primary & Higher Secondary School which provided Free Mid-Day meals in the 1950s. He led the ADMK to victory in the 1984 assembly elections despite not taking part in the campaigning. At that time he was undergoing medical treatment in America and his images were broadcast in Tamil Nadu through cinema halls. This was an effective campaign tactic and ADMK won the elections, indicating the depth of his popular support. He won the election in a double landslide victory in 1984.He still holds the record of being the chief minister with the highest consistent longevity of more than a decade.\n\nMember of Legislative Assembly\n\nYear Elected/Reelected Place Party 1967 Elected St. Thomas Mount DMK 1971 Reelected St. Thomas Mount DMK 1977 Elected Aruppukottai ADMK 1980 Elected Madurai West ADMK 1984 Elected Andipatti ADMK\n\nChief Minister\n\nFrom Year To Year Election 1977 1980 Tamil Nadu state assembly election, 1977 1980 1984 Tamil Nadu state assembly election, 1980 1984 1987 Tamil Nadu state assembly election, 1984\n\nAwards\n\nFilmfare Best Actor Award for Enga Veettu Pillai[16]\n\nFilmfare Best Film Award for Adimai Penn[17]\n\nNational Film Award for Best Actor for the film Rickshawkaran in 1972.\n\nHonorary doctorate received from University of Madras and The World University (Arizona).\n\nBharat Ratna was conferred by the Government of India (posthumously) in 1988 for his reformation activities and support from Tamil Nadu.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nHe personally offered relief in disasters and calamities like fire, flood, drought, and cyclones. He was the first donor during the war with China in 1962, donating Rs. 75,000 to the war fund. He was the founder and editor of Thai weekly magazine and Anna daily newspaper in Tamil. He was the owner of Sathya Studios and Emgeeyar Pictures (willed to charity) which produced many of the films he acted in. He had gifted a golden sword weighing half a Kilogram to Mookambika temple in Kollur, Udupi district.[18]\n\nDeath\n\nIn October 1984, MGR was diagnosed with kidney failure and rushed to the Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, United States for treatment, undergoing a kidney transplant. MGR died on December 24, 1987 after his prolonged illness. His death sparked off a frenzy of looting and rioting all over the state of Tamil Nadu. Shops, movie theatres, buses and other public and private property became the target of violence let loose all over the state. The police had to resort issuing shoot-at-sight orders. Tamilians from Bangalore rushed to Madras in trains to see the mortal remains of MGR. Govt had announced free train facility for this visit. The violence during the funeral alone left 29 people dead and 47 police personnel badly wounded. [1],[2] This state of affairs continued for almost a month all over the state of Tamil Nadu. Around one million[3] people followed his remains, around 30 followers committed suicide and people had their heads tonsured. After his death, his political party, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, split between his wife Janaki Ramachandran and J. Jayalalithaa; they later merged in 1988. In 1989 Dr. M. G. R. Home and Higher Secondary School for the Speech and Hearing Impaired was established in the erstwhile Residence MGR Gardens, Ramavaram, in accordance with his will dated January 17, 1986. His official residence at 27, Arcot Street, T.Nagar is now MGR Memorial House and is open for public viewing.
