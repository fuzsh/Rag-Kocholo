        "text": "Chennai: It's the 31st death anniversary of AIADMK founder MG Ramachandran. Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami started the day with a visit to MGR's memorial at Marina beach in Chennai. He paid floral tribute to the leader in the morning. The police had taken adequate steps in terms of traffic diversions with many leaders steering their way to Marina.\n\nFollowing this, AIADMK's ousted leader TTV Dhinakaran too visited the memorial and paid his tribute to MGR. While all leaders paid their respects to MGR, none were allowed to Jayalalithaa's memorial, which is adjacent to this place. Sources said that due to construction activity taking place around that area, the access has been restricted.\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, MGR Amma Deepa Peravai leader, Deepa Jayakumar, Jayalalithaa's niece, suddenly trespassed into Jaya's memorial, and created panic in the area. The police swung into action and escorted her out. Deepa paid floral tribute to Ramachandran and did not want to miss visiting her aunt's memorial as well.\n\nFormer chief minister of Tamil Nadu, Ramachandran died in 1987. He floated AIADMK in 1972 and became chief minister of the state in 1977."
