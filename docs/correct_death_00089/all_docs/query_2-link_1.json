        "text": "Apollo Hospitals on Tuesday told the Commission of Inquiry looking into former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s death that it would be appropriate to request the State government to submit the details of the treatment provided to then Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran in 1984.\n\nThe Justice (Retd.) A. Arumughaswamy Commission had earlier asked the hospital to submit details of MGR’s treatment at Apollo and information on shifting him to an American hospital.\n\nThe hospital’s Manager-Legal S.M. Mohan Kumar said documents related to MGR’s treatment were submitted to the government at the time of his discharge. “He was not only a patient; he was a CM and a very revered public figure. Therefore, the details of his treatment are confidential and sensitive,” said Apollo’s legal counsel Maimoona Badsha.\n\n“Apollo did not refer the CM to the hospital in Brooklyn. The government took the decision to shift the CM. All arrangements, including the private plane, were arranged by the government. In fact, the hospital was given only a 12-hour notice when the government brought nephrologists from the United States,” she said.\n\n“We were not involved in the treatment at the Brooklyn hospital. Medical records, if any, in all likelihood would have been handed over to the government. We have no access to them,” she added.\n\nJaya’s gift\n\nOn Tuesday, a respiratory medicine specialist, who treated Jayalalithaa, submitted that she had gifted him a copy of The Private Life of Chairman Mao , penned by Mao Zeodong’s personal physician Li Zhisui.\n\nDr. Narasimhan said Jayalalithaa had developed a fondness for him and would request his presence even though he was not part of the CCU group of doctors that treated her on a daily basis. Despite handing over her day-to-day treatment to fellow respiratory medicine specialist Dr. Babu K. Abraham on October 1, 2016, she would call for him.\n\nHe said Jayalalithaa had recommended the book before being intubated. After she was taken off the ventilator, she asked if he had received a copy. When he replied in the negative, Jayalalithaa rang up her secretary and ensured that he got a copy. Dr. K.S. Sivakumar, who coordinated her treatment, was nearby. He requested for a copy and got one.\n\nDr. Narasimhan said that Jayalalithaa responded to stimuli even she was on the ventilator. She was able to move her limbs and interact with others. The Commission’s lawyer R. Niranjan asked the doctor multiple questions about the possible cause of Jayalalithaa's death.\n\nThe tenure of the Arumughaswamy Commission is due to end on Wednesday. Even on Tuesday, there was no word on whether the State government had approved the Commission’s request for an extension."
