        "text": "Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday took a jibe at his predecessor and YSRCP chief YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in the state Assembly and pointed out the 'false cases' filed against several leaders, including him and his deputy Pawan Kalyan, by the previous state government. After tabling a white paper on law and order of Andhra Pradesh in the last five years, Naidu questioned the House, \"Against whom have cases been filed?\" To this, most of the legislators from the ruling coalition, including Pawan Kalyan, stood up to support his calim. \"Did you see, Speaker sir? Cases have been filed against all of those who fought politically in the state. This is why people have sent these leaders to the Assembly. You've seen the majority. We all were victims of the YSR Congress regime,\" Chandrababu Naidu said amid laughter and thumping of desks by his ministers."
