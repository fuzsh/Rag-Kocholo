        "text": "I recently visited late Chief Minister MG Ramachandran memorial house in Arcot Road, T.Nagar. You would think that memorial house of politician who died 30 years ago would invite hardly any enthusiasm.\n\nMGR, as he is fondly called, is obviously an exception. He was an actor-turned-politician who served as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from 1977-1987, till the time he was alive. To say that he commanded a huge following is an understatement. For, these followers are loyal to him even 30 years after he died.\n\nThe day I visited MGR’s memorial home there were close to a dozen people, mostly women accompanied by one or two women. In fact I saw them posing in front of an old turquoise coloured Ambassador car that he used to favour, one by one, so that they all get a chance to take a separate picture with car.\n\nI heard one saying, “Thalaivar kooda photo eduthu ka Rs 20 enna, evalavu venum naalum kudukalam.” It translates to: “If it is a picture with him, Rs 20 is nothing, I can pay any amount.”\n\nThat is the respect and affection MGR continues to command even decades after his death.\n\nIt is not just his house though that attracts people. His memorial in Marina Beach, considered second longest beach in the world, too sees a lot of people even on sultry summer afternoons. I have been there once too, when I was doing a story.\n\nIt was a hot summer afternoon when my professor asked me to do a story on statues along Marina beach for an assignment. (It came out to be a good story, if I say so myself)\n\nSo I went to the beach, around 1 pm, taking stock of the statues and what they mean to people. There were hardly any people given the time and the few there were homeless people just wanting to rest their feet. So I walked the entire stretch till the labour statue, the last one on the beach, behind which the MGR memorial is situated.\n\nIt was crowded, not just by the people who want rest. But by people who really wanted to take a look at the memorial. It was a good mix I would say – families with kids, couples, elderly, schools and college kids, men and women across all classes.\n\nThe memorial was built in 1988 and was inaugurated by Janaki Ramachandran, wife of MGR in May 1990. The memorial was remodelled and the whole complex was laid with marbles and opened in 1992 by J Jayalalithaa when she became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in 1991. The memorial was remodeled several times after 1992 incurring a huge cost each time. After quite a bit of remodelling what looks like a pair of leaves (party symbol of AIADMK Irattai illai) and a Pegasus, the winged horse in Greek mythology welcomes you. (There was a long drawn out legal battle to prove that those were wings and not two leaves symbol as it made out be and finally Jayalalithaa won the case.)\n\nAs you go inside there is a museum where you can look at MGR’s life in pictures during his time as an actor and also a politician. But the main attraction here is the actor-turned-politicians samadhi.\n\nWhen you reach the samadhi you will see people straining their ear on the surface. It is sort of funny and there is definitely a story behind it. MGR was buried with his watch popular Seiko watch in the memorial in 1987. My father used to tell me that after he died it was common for people press their ears against the grave to listen to his watch tick and there were many who swore by it.\n\nSomehow that habit seemed to have passed on from one generation to the next. For even now, close to 30 years after he died, you will see people straining their ears to listen to the watch tick. I did too. But hardly could hear anything. Considering that it has been three decades, we should know that no watch could last that long.\n\nBut I cannot help but wonder what is it about him that attracted people without boundaries of age, class and gender? He was good looking sure. But more than that he was a demigod, who people believed capable of wiping away their tears and uplift their life. I’m not so sure how much MGR actually did change their situation, but it never mattered to them. For them MGR was a savior and probably he still is in the corner of their hearts."
