        "text": "Tamil Nadu's late supremo Jayalalithaa had millions of admirers cutting across state and political divides. People flocking to her final resting place in Chennai are not just Tamils or supporters of her political party.\n\nThe Jayalalithaa Memorial or Jayalalithaa Samadhi on Marina Beach, the world's longest urban coastal stretch, is a destination for travellers arriving in the Tamil Nadu capital. Numerous visitors are often found taking pictures and selfies all around it. Some people can be seen basking in the serenity of the place, standing there lost in thought. The place is perfect for watching the sunset in silence and enjoying evening breeze by the sea.\n\nJayalalithaa's grave is adjacent to the memorial of her mentor and AIADMK stalwart M G Ramachandran. After her death in late 2016, a makeshift memorial soon came up and was developed soon. However, plans are afoot to revamp the memorial with features like library, video screening, and more. Its foundation stone has already been laid by the party members of the late politician.\n\nVisitors to Marina Beach make it a point to visit the memorials of both the leaders. The memorials are to the northern end of the long beach and could be easily accessed on foot.\n\nPublic rest-rooms are at the complex and shady trees offer solace as the day advances in the sultry Chennai weather. The entrance to the complex is free."
