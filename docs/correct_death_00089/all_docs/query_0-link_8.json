        "text": "From Joan D.\n\nCHENNAI, Dec 24: While many were seen doing last-minute shopping at malls here ahead of the Christmas celebrations, an even larger crowd was seen at the MGR Memorial of the late movie idol-turned Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, M.G. Ramachandran or MGR, at the Marina Beach here today.\n\nI was drawn in as well along with many people in Chennai who turned up to pay homage to their film idol who is still very much loved and revered by the folks in Tamil Nadu state, some 36 years after his death. He died on Christmas Eve in 1987.\n\nThousands thronged to pay respects to the man, who is remembered not only for his dashing and heroic roles in Tamil movies but for his valiant ways in real life.\n\nAs a philanthropist who not only initiated positive changes to the mainly agricultural state back then, MGR was praised by many actors and actresses for having helped them out as they initially struggled to make a name for themselves in India’s movie industry.\n\nMeanwhile, churches here today welcomed X’mas Eve with special services. Chennai is indeed a land of contrast and diversity, and I found myself in awe of the resilience of the Tamil folks as the bustling city has been progressing from mostly an agricultural-based economy to where Artificial Intelligence is making its presence felt in many industrial sectors here. Its march towards to modernity has been tremendous since I last visited this interesting and dynamic state capital.\n\n— WE"
