        "text": "On her 24th death anniversary, ThePrint looks back at her life as an actor, partner to MGR and, finally, as a politician.\n\nAlso read: Pramod Mahajan, BJP’s master strategist and troubleshooter before Amit Shah\n\nFrom films to politics\n\nJanaki made her film debut in Manmatha Vijayam (1939) as a dancer. She went on to do a few supporting roles and shot to fame in the movie 1000 Thalaivaangi Apoorva Chinthamani (1947). She appeared in more than 20 films, including the superhit Mohini (1948), which was the first time she and her future husband, MGR, appeared in a movie together.\n\nThe two came together as the lead pair for the first time in 1950, for the film Marudhanattu Elavarasi. It was during this shoot that MGR fell in love with her. He had been married and widowed once already, and his second wife was seriously ill at this time, and died later. Janaki was married and a mother. But after the two fell in love, she divorced her husband to be with MGR.\n\nOnce they got married, Janaki gave up acting. After MGR launched the AIADMK, she participated in demonstrations and agitations alongside him, but never in a big way. As an AIADMK MP of the Jayalalithaa group observed: “We always viewed Janaki Amma only as our leader’s wife. We had never seen her as a person with political potential.”\n\nIn 1984, that started to change, when MGR had a stroke. Suddenly, Janaki became indispensable, not only giving him vital information about what was going on politically, but also issuing instructions to party workers on his behalf.\n\nJanaki vs Jayalalithaa\n\nNot everyone appreciated Janaki’s transformation, least of all MGR’s protege and Janaki’s domestic, and soon to be political, rival — J Jayalalithaa. Matters came to a head when MGR died on 24 December 1987 and the tension between the two women spilled over for the world to see.\n\nThey were polar opposites, in some ways. If Janaki was the quiet support system who preferred to take a backseat, Jayalalithaa, then the party’s propaganda secretary, “missed no opportunity to bask in the spotlight”, which was evident in the now-infamous theatrics that took place at MGR’s funeral.\n\nImmediately after MGR’s death, the battle for the post of CM began, with the AIADMK splitting into two factions, one supporting Janaki and one throwing its weight behind Jayalalithaa, who had said she was not interested in any post but declared herself the party’s general secretary the next day. Acting CM Nedunchezhian was keen to contest for the post as well, so the Jayalalithaa faction supported his name for CM.\n\nWhat followed was an intense, and violent tug-of-war. In early January 1988, Janaki was sworn in as the chief minister by the then Tamil Nadu Governor S.L. Khurana, but with the caveat that she had to prove her majority within three weeks, on 28 January.\n\nFollowing further political machinations and side-switching, violence broke out in the Assembly on the day of the confidence motion, with members of the House throwing mics and paperweights at each other, and the police had to be called in to lathi-charge the politicians. Janaki’s 24-day government was dismissed.\n\nJanaki never won an election after that, and soon quit politics altogether. She died on 19 May 1996."
