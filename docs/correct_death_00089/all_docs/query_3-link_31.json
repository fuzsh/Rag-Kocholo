Ramachandran started his acting career by joining a drama troupe and acting in dramas just to earn money to supplement that of his family.

MGR saw this move as a move by Karunanidhi to curtail his political career. M. G. Ramachandran then started to make claims of corruption against the party leadership and demanded the financial details of the party are published publicly and that upset DMK leadership leading to him being expelled.\n\nHe then formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK), later called All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which became a powerful rival of the DMK.MGR worked tirelessly to promote his party with the use of films like Netru Indru Naalai (1974), Idhayakani (1975), Indru Pol Endrum Vazhga (1977) to expand his course.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nElections\n\nThe first election contested by the AIADMK was in the 1977 parliamentary and assembly elections in Tamil Nadu.
