        "text": "Maruthur Gopalan Ramachandran aka MGR was one of the cultural icons in the Tamil Film industry. He was an actor, who later turned into a politician. He also served as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from 1977, making him the first actor to hold such a prestigious position, till his death in 1987. He founded the All India Anna Dravida Munnetr Kazhagam (AIADMK) party. He was also honoured with the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian honour. Did you know that one of his leading ladies on the silver screen once funded his elections? An actress once gave Rs 30 lakh for elections. She is none other than Latha Sethupathi aka Latha, who was his leading lady in many movies like Ulagam Sutrum Valiban, Ninaithadhai Mudippavan and Naalai Namadhe. In 1977, she was reportedly a part of the play titled Shakunthalam and went to different parts of Tamil Nadu to perform. From this, she received Rs 35 lakh, out of which the actress reportedly decided to give Rs 30 lakh to MGR for election funds.\n\nIn 1977, MGR led his AIADMK-led alliance to victory and became the first Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Except for a four-month gap in 1980, when his government was overthrown by the union government, he continued to hold the position of Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu till his death in 1987.\n\nMGR made his movie debut in 1936 with Sathi Leelavthi, directed by Ellis R Dungan. It was in 1950 that he got his breakthrough with the M Karunanidhi-written movie Maruthanad Elavarasee. MG Ramachandran soon won the hearts of millions with his acting. Apart from that, he was also known for his many charity works and generosity. From offering food to the hungry to giving monetary assistance to the needy, MGR’s charitable actions made him a loved personality. Even today, he is fondly remembered and people visit his memorial to pay him respect.\n\nThe actor-turned-politician and philanthropist was diagnosed with kidney failure due to diabetes. He breathed his last on December 24, 1987."
