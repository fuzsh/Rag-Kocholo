        "text": "Thiruvananthapuram: The 22-member scuba team of the fire and rescue force has spent hours in a dark tunnel, hoping to find sanitation worker Joy. They waded through garbage-filled muddy water that most would avoid. Several team members ate only when someone hand-fed them. These 22 persons represented the hope of everyone gathered to find Joy.\n\nTo advertise here, Contact Us\n\nThe fire rescue team arrived at the Amayizhanchan canal upon receiving information that a cleaning worker had been swept away by the current and was missing. The group included nine scuba members, with additional team members arriving from Kollam and Pathanamthitta districts on Sunday.\n\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\n\nThe search operation from the Power House to the Coffee House was extremely challenging. Despite the foul-smelling drain and high piles of garbage, including manholes inside the railway station, the team did not hesitate. Although they were often unable to enter certain areas, they risked their lives in the mission to find Joy.\n\nThe team was led by KU Subhash, with members Sujayan, SP Saji, Anu, Santhosh Kumar, Dinumon, Pradosh, Shaheer, Deepak, and Vijesh. In addition to the scuba team, more than 100 firemen participated in the rescue operation, coordinated by Technical Director Naushad.\n\nJustice Devan Ramachandran congratulates team\n\nKerala High Court Judge Devan Ramachandran emphasized the need to ensure the safety of those involved in rescue operations. In a letter to Fire Rescue Chief K Padmakumar, he commended the rescue workers and urged the provision of all necessary security measures for the rescue team."
