        "text": "MG Ramachandran is a name of legendary aura when it comes to Tamil Nadu politics and the film industry.\n\nEven as the newly appointed AIADMK chief VK Sasikala struggles to hold the party together, she knows the fact that mentioning MGR and his protege J Jayalalithaa evokes passion among party workers.\n\nMGR was born Marudur Gopala Menon Ramachandran on 17 January 1917 at Kandy, Sri Lanka, to Maradhur Gopala Menon and Satyabhama who were Nairs from Kerala. When his father died, MGR’s mother moved to Tamil Nadu where the boys began schooling. But poverty meant MGR had to forego completing his education and seek a means of livelihood instead.\n\nAfter a few years of acting in plays, he made his film debut in the 1936 film Sathi Leelavathi in a supporting role. By the late 1940s he graduated to lead roles and for the next three decades dominated the Tamil film industry.\n\nThe bullet, permanently lodged in his neck, affected his voice. But he continued his campaign for the Madras Legislative Assembly in 1967 from his hospital bed. He defeated his Congress rival by polling the largest number of votes polled by any candidate for the Assembly.\n\nOn 24 December 1987, MGR died in Chennai’s Apollo hospital of a heart attack. A diabetic and a kidney ailment patient, death swooped down upon him when he was 68.\n\nNews of his death confused party cadres who had not been readied for a second rung of succession.\n\nAs MGR's body was brought to Rajaji Hall for public viewing, police and government officials were unable to contain the vandalism that spread through the city."
