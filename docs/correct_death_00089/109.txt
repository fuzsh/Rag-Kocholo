From the beginning of his childhood, M. G Ramachandran was a staunch Hindu and firmly believed and worshipped Lord Murugan, the most popular deity among Tamil Hindus.

Career in Tamil Films

M. G Ramachandran was involved in acting from his youth days. His father expired when MGR was still young, leaving him to fend for himself. It was primarily an urge to earn money that drove MGR to enroll his name in a drama troupe named Original Boys. His brother was also one of the members of this troupe. It was only after some years that MGR quit acting in dramas and joined the Tamil film industry in the year 1935. His first film as an actor in a Kollywood movie was that of a supporting role in the 1936 film 'Sathi Leelavathi'. It was only in and after the mid 1940s that he was offered the lead role in a film. The one film that established MGR as one of the best commercial romantic and action heroes that the Tamil film industry had ever seen was 'Rajakumari' penned by M Karunanidhi. 'Rajakumari' hit theaters in the year 1947 and three decades from then the Tamil film industry chanted MGR. In the year 1956, MGR ventured into the field of producing and directing movies. His first film as director 'Nabodi Mannan' was a huge hit with the Tamil audience and ran to packed theaters in Tamil Nadu. Following the success of his first film as director, he made two other films 'Ulagam Sutrum Valiban' and 'Madhurai Meetha Sundharapandian' donning the caps of both director and actor.

Career in Politics

M. G Ramachandran had remained a member of the Indian National Congress from his days of youth till the year 1953. MGR was a great fan of the principles of Mahatma Gandhi and thus he wore only khadi as his garment. In the year 1953, MGR joined the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam or the DMK party on the insistence of M Karunanidhi. Cashing on the popularity of MGR the actor, the DMK made him the face of the Dravidian Movement, which was one of the most notable political movements in 1950s Tamil Nadu. In the year 1962, M. G Ramachandran became a member of the State Legislative Council in Tamil Nadu, following which he got elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1967.

In January, 12 1967 M. G Ramachandran survived a serious gunshot accident. He was shot in the neck area by fellow actor and politician M Radha. He had to be hospitalized for a couple of months, a time when the nation realized how popular MGR was among his fans. Thousands of people remained outside the hospital where he was housed for hours on end, praying and monitoring every minor development. Though he was in an ailing condition, MGR did not give up hope and contested for the Madras Legislative Assembly from his hospital bed. Not only did he win, MGR secured two times more votes than his rival and also the maximum number of votes in the history of the Legislative Assembly.

In the year 1969, M. G Ramachandran was appointed the treasurer of the DMK party after the death of actor and politician Annadurai, who was also M. G Ramachandran's mentor in the field of politics. The death of Annadurai also meant the end of M. G Ramachandran's days in DMK. MGR got involved in a great tiff with the party's head M Karunanidhi after the former accused that the party officials were getting corrupt in the absence of Annadurai. Karunanidhi was already eager to place his son at the party's helms, and this argument only made it easier for him to expel MGR from DMK.

M. G Ramachandran left the DMK to form his own party Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK) in the year 1972. Inspired by his mentor, MGR too used Tamil films as a means of preaching the propaganda of his newly formed ADMK. Understandably, MGR's popularity helped the party to rise and shine in the Tamil Nadu political circuit. M. G Ramachandran won elections to become the first film star becoming the Chief Minister of an Indian state. M. G Ramachandran remained in office of the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from July 30, 1977 till his death in 1987 for three terms.
