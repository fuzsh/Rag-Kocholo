        "text": "This is your resource to find the answers to commonly asked questions about the Evans Scholars Foundation and the Evans Scholarship.\n\nWhat is the Evans Scholars Foundation?\n\nThe Evans Scholars Foundation is a charitable trust that provides full, four-year tuition and housing college scholarships to deserving caddies. The Foundation is overseen by the Western Golf Association, which also runs six prestigious golf tournaments, including the BMW Championship.\n\nAm I eligible for the Evans Scholarship?\n\nApplicants must have a strong caddie record, excellent grades, demonstrated financial need and outstanding character. Find out more about the Evans Scholarship application here.\n\nHow many Evans Scholarships are awarded each year?\n\nThe number of Evans Scholarships awarded changes each year. In 2023, 920 caddies applied for the Evans Scholarship and 340 Scholarships were awarded for the 2024-25 academic year.\n\nHow do I apply for the Evans Scholarship?\n\nScholarship applications are accepted at the beginning of an applicant's senior year of high school, as well as from college freshmen. The entire application — including supporting documents like evaluations, recommendation letters, transcripts, test scores, and a CSS profile — are expected to be completed by Oct. 15. Since the FAFSA will not be available until December 1, the deadline to submit the SAR to the Scholarship Committee will be on or before January 15.\n\nWhen is the Evans Scholarship awarded?\n\nMost Scholarships are awarded during the applicant’s senior year in high school. Applications are reviewed by the Scholarship Committee, and candidates compete for the limited number of Scholarships awarded annually. Read more about the process on our application resources page.\n\nWhich universities can I attend?\n\nLiving in an Evans Scholars House on campus is an integral component of the Evans Scholars Program. Applicants are expected to apply to the Evans Scholars university(ies) listed for their state (Illinois residents are expected to apply to the University of Illinois, Champaign and the University of Illinois, Chicago and other applicable Evans Scholar universities). Applicants apply directly to the university(ies) for admission. The Scholarship Committee recommends applicants apply by early action deadlines (not early decision). If early action is unavailable, apply by regular decision as soon as the application becomes available for the applicable university(ies).\n\n*At a university without a Scholarship House, Scholars live together in a designated university residence hall"
