        "text": "Revolutionary author and abolitionist Frederick Douglass was born a slave in Maryland in 1818 and sent to Baltimore as a young boy to live with Hugh and Sophia Auld and care for their son, Thomas. It was there that Douglass learned to read, first in lessons with Sophia and later through secret self-studies. Later in life, Hugh hired out Douglass to the Fell’s Point shipyards, which allowed him to earn some money.\n\nWhile working in Baltimore, Douglass met his future wife, Anna Murray, who helped him escape to the north. Just three years before his death, Douglass returned to Baltimore as a prosperous free man and built five houses on Strawberry Alley that he named Douglass Place (today known as Dallas Street). The houses still stand today and there is a plaque outside with some information about Douglass. You can also learn more about his life and legacy at the Frederick Douglass-Isaac Myers Maritime Park Museum.\n\nWhile Frederick Douglass was meeting with Abraham Lincoln and advocating for an end to slavery, another Marylander was leading enslaved individuals to freedom via the Underground Railroad and providing valuable intelligence to the Union Army. Harriet Tubman was born into slavery in Dorchester County, Maryland in 1820. She landed in Baltimore in 1850 after helping her sister and children escape to freedom via the Underground Railroad—the first of thirteen dangerous forays into Maryland that facilitated the escape of about 70 enslaved individuals. One such story is memorialized at Pier 4 outside the National Aquarium, where Tubman helped a woman named Tilly. There are also signs honoring Tubman in a section of Wyman Park Dell near the Baltimore Museum of Art that was renamed Harriet Tubman Grove.\n\nYou can learn more about the role Baltimore played in the Underground Railroad and the stories of those who took the journey at the B&O Railroad Museum, an official Network to Freedom Site.\n\nBaltimore’s jazz history is as old as the genre itself. The city greatly contributed to the development of East Coast ragtime, thanks largely to pianist and composer Eubie Blake, who was born in Baltimore in 1887. Blake’s musical training began when he was young, but his big break came when boxer Joe Gans hired him to play the piano at Baltimore’s Goldfield Hotel.\n\nAnother jazz performer and cultural icon, Billie Holiday, spent her early years in Baltimore. A bronze statue, complete with her signature gardenia, stands more than eight feet tall on Pennsylvania Avenue in West Baltimore. Murals and portraits of Holiday can be found throughout her childhood neighborhood of Upper Fell’s Point and at Pennsylvania and North Avenues.\n\nBoth Blake and Holiday and regularly returned to Baltimore perform at legendary venues like the Royal Theatre on Pennsylvania Avenue, which was once one of Charm City’s major entertainment hubs. In addition to hometown stars Holiday and Blake, the Royal Theatre’s stage was graced by African American musical icons Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Etta James, Louis Armstrong and more. Though the theater was demolished, a replica of the marquee still stands in its place. A few blocks down the street is The Avenue Bakery, which is known for its delicious rolls, but also serves as a museum filled with memorabilia, photos and murals celebrating Pennsylvania Avenue’s history.\n\nOther Baltimore-born jazz icons include singer Cab Calloway, drummer Chick Webb and Ethel Ennis, Baltimore’s “First Lady of Jazz.” Their legacy lives on in Baltimore’s still-thriving jazz scene, pushed forward by clubs such as Keystone Korner, Cat’s Eye Pub, Next Phaze Café and Teavolve Café.\n\nAs a populous city in the middle of the East Coast, Baltimore played a pivotal role in advancing civil rights and justice for African Americans, with its residents often at the forefront of protests. In 1931, sisters Juanita and Virginia Jackson organized the City-Wide Young People’s Forum, which advocated for the end of discriminatory policies. Their mother, Lillie May Carroll Jackson was also a civil rights activist who grew the Baltimore branch of the NAACP into the largest in America. You can learn more about Jackson’s impact at the free Lillie Carroll Jackson Civil Rights Museum.\n\nAs an activist, Jackson often worked with Thurgood Marshall, a Baltimore-born civil rights attorney who became the first African American Supreme Court Justice. He played an integral role in the Civil Rights Movement, representing Linda Brown in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case before the Supreme Court. After the decision, Baltimore was the first southern city to integrate its schools. A statue honors Baltimore’s native son and great American lawyer at the U.S. District Courthouse downtown on Pratt Street, and a marker at 1632 Division Street marks the site of the house where he grew up. Baltimore/Washington International Airport was named in Marshall’s honor and features a tribute to him in Concourse C with a timeline of his life and accomplishments.\n\nAlso from Baltimore is Elijah E. Cummings, who served in the United States House of Representatives for Maryland’s 7th Congressional district for 23 years. He became an advocate for civil rights at age 11, in 1962, when he helped integrate a swimming pool. For years, Pool No. 2 in Druid Hill Park was the only recreational and competitive swimming facility for Black Baltimoreans. Today, the pool site is a public art installation by Joyce J. Scott featuring a large rectangular expanse of grass, curvy concrete patterns, vibrant tiles and more.\n\nCummings was best known as a powerful orator and advocate for the poor. Speaking at his funeral, President Obama said, “His life validates the things we tell ourselves about what is possible in this country.” Elijah’s Park at the Baltimore Peninsula pays tribute to Cummings’ commitment to education and healthcare with a mosaic made by local high school students. A park on Mura Street in East Baltimore also features a colorful mural of Cummings designed by Justin Nether."
