        "text": "Few people know that a Boy Scout Camp once existed on Mount Penn. Camp Howard was a 26-acre campsite located on List Road on the top of Mount Penn in the City of Reading.\n\nRecords indicate that Scouts began using the city-owned land in 1918, and, in August 1936, the Reading-Berks County Council newsletter, The Scout, ran the following report.\n\nBefore a group of several hundred Scouts, Scouters and friends, a 26 acre campsite on the on the top of Mt. Penn was recently turned over by Councilman George M. Yocum of the City of Reading to the Scouts of the Reading-Berks County Council. The plot was named Camp Howard in honor of Frank H. Howard, the first President of this Council.\n\nAn old log house which stands near the center of the site was built in the time of William Penn and, it is said, is mentioned in the deed which covered the first transfer of this land.\n\nGreat expanses of rolling meadows, flanked by groves of trees and woodland offer many fine campsites for Scouts wishing to go on overnight hikes. The Council has engaged a Ranger who lives in the historic cabin and who in addition to helping the Scouts to enjoy the facilities of the camp, will also issue overnight camping equipment to Troops or Patrols which have obtained permits for it from Headquarters."
