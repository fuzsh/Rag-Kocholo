        "text": "A 3-foot granite memorial in Susquehanna Township’s Lincoln Cemetery sums up quite a life.\n\n“Scholar, humanitarian, churchman, civic-leader, educator, editor, publisher, lecturer,” it reads.\n\nWilliam Howard Day was a significant 19th-century Black civil rights figure who made his mark in Harrisburg, in Pennsylvania and beyond.\n\nHe was Harrisburg’s first Black school board member and president. He was Pennsylvania’s first Black state employee. He knew Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, John Brown and Booker T. Washington. Civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois gave the keynote address at the dedication of Day’s memorial in Lincoln Cemetery a half-century after Day’s death.\n\n“Day was one of the most influential, resilient and dynamic Black leaders who lived in the nineteenth century,” historian Todd Mealy writes in his biography of Day, “Aliened American.”\n\nAs Wednesday marks Juneteenth — when enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, in 1865 learned they had been freed after the end of the Civil War — here are six facts about this key Black civil rights leader in Harrisburg’s history.\n\nHe was an abolitionist: Born in 1825 in New York City to a father who was a sailmaker and a mother who was active in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion’s mother church. Day’s father died when he was young, and with his mother unable to support him, Day was adopted at age 12 by a white abolitionist couple in Northampton, Massachusetts.\n\nAfter graduating from Oberlin College in 1847, Day joined the Colored Citizens League, an early civil rights group; became involved with the Underground Railroad; lobbied the Ohio General Assembly for Black rights; and started several short-lived newspapers.\n\nIn 1856, he moved to modern-day Ontario, Canada, where he taught at settlements for people who escaped slavery in the U.S. Mealy writes that, on John Brown’s request, Day printed the constitution for the country Brown planned to form if his raid on Harpers Ferry had been successful.\n\nIn 1859, Day toured the United Kingdom to raise money for the Canadian settlements of former enslaved people. He lived there for four years before returning to the U.S.\n\nHe played a key part in the first civil rights march on Washington: The 1963 March on Washington, at which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech, is a landmark event in U.S. history. Nearly a century before that, on July 4, 1865, Day gave a keynote speech of his own on the back lawn of the White House in the first civil rights demonstration at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“(S)everal thousand (Black) men, women and children from many parts of the country gathered at the door step of the White House and celebrated the 4th of July for the first time as free people,” Mealy writes. “Day helped usher in a new era of civil rights demonstration that King and his contemporaries would come to utilize one hundred years later.”\n\nFour months later, Day displayed his oratorical skills in Harrisburg. After the Civil War ended, the U.S. Colored Troops were denied participation in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington D.C. So the Garnet Equal Rights League, a Black civil rights group, organized one in Harrisburg.\n\nDay was selected as the main speaker at the event, and his description of the evils of slavery, praise for Black soldiers and call for political equality were hailed by the audience.\n\nHe was Pennsylvania’s first Black state worker: Day was an active Republican for much of his life, campaigning for presidential and gubernatorial candidates. His work earned him a job as a clerk in newly elected state Auditor General Harrison Allen’s office in 1873. Years later, Day said he was the first Black state employee in Pennsylvania.\n\n“In that capacity it appears that he was able to use his influence to secure state appropriation for black schools such as Lincoln University,” historian Eric Ledell Smith notes in a paper in the Historical Society of Dauphin County archives.\n\nDay’s tenure in the post ended in 1876 when Allen lost reelection.\n\nHe was a minister: Day was ordained an elder in the AME Zion Church in 1866. He served the denomination in a variety of ways, such as general secretary of the general conference for five terms and leader of the Sunday school association. Though he was suspended in 1880 for failing to publish the minutes of a general conference meeting, he was later reinstated and served as interim pastor of AME Zion congregations in Harrisburg and York.\n\nHe valued education: Day served as superintendent of Black schools in Maryland and Delaware in the Freedmen’s Bureau from 1867 to 1871. He built 140 schools, hired more than 160 teachers and enrolled about 7,000 students in that post, Mealy writes.\n\nHe moved to Harrisburg in 1871, living in the Old 8th Ward, a largely Black and immigrant neighborhood near the Capitol, for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1872, he founded a Black newspaper, Our National Progress, which closed two years later because of financial struggles.\n\nDay made his biggest local impact as a member of the Harrisburg School Board, to which he was elected in 1878 as its first Black member and on which he served six three-year terms.\n\nHe worked to desegregate the city’s schools. Notably, he helped the first Black students enroll in the boys and girls high schools in the 1878-79 school year, Mealy writes.\n\nPennsylvania officially integrated its schools in 1881, although that didn’t necessarily end segregation in practice.\n\nRemarkably, he served as school board president from 1891 to 1893. Smith notes that Harrisburg wouldn’t have another Black school board president until 1969, when James Rowland Sr. was elected.\n\nUnder his leadership, the board provided free textbooks to all students, extended the school year from six to seven months and built the coed Harrisburg Central High School on Forster Street.\n\nHis name lives on: Day was beloved in Harrisburg’s Black community and among many white people. A five-day celebration in 1898 marked his 50 years in public life.\n\nAnd in the decades since his death in 1900 at age 75, his name has continued to live on in the Harrisburg area.\n\nWhen the Harrisburg School District built the Lincoln School on State Street in 1905, today the district’s administrative office, it renamed the original Lincoln School in the Old 8th Ward after Day.\n\nIn 1940, the William Howard Day Cemetery was chartered in Swatara Township and the William Howard Day Homes, a federal housing project, opened in Harrisburg.\n\nThere is a sad irony, though. Although Day dedicated his life to fighting for racial equality, the school, the cemetery and the housing project were established as segregated spaces.\n\nAnd Day himself was buried in a majority-Black cemetery.\n\nOn Memorial Day in 1950, a ceremony marked the dedication of Day’s memorial, sponsored by the Black business group Club Twenty-One, in Lincoln Cemetery.\n\nSince 2015, the Pennsylvania School Boards Association has given the William Howard Day Award to people and organizations for their contributions to public education.\n\nAnd in 2020, a monument was unveiled at Fourth and Walnut streets to commemorate the Old 8th Ward, which was wiped out in the early 20th century when the Capitol Complex expanded; the 150th anniversary of the 15th Amendment giving Black men the right to vote; and the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment granting women’s suffrage. Day is one of four figures depicted in the monument.\n\nThe rest of the inscription on Day’s memorial in Lincoln Cemetery sums up his remarkable life.\n\n“A life devoted to the intellectual, civic and spiritual uplift of man, endowed by God with unique talents to serve a common humanity,” the memorial reads, “which he did with humility, patience, fortitude and dignity.”"
