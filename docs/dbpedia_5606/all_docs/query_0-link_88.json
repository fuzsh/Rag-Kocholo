        "text": "Rulers\n\nIndex Pe-Ph\n\nPe Kin (b. Aug. 27, 1912, Swehman village, Pyawbwe township, Burma [now Myanmar] - d. Feb. 25, 2004, Yangon, Myanmar), Burmese diplomat. He was ambassador to Pakistan (1948-52), Thailand (1952-56), the United Arab Republic (1958-62), the Soviet Union (1964-65), and Singapore (1966-72) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1956-57).\n\nPeabody, Endicott (b. Feb. 15, 1920, Lawrence, Mass. - d. Dec. 2, 1997, Hollis, N.H.), governor of Massachusetts (1963-65).\n\nPeabody, James H(amilton) (b. Aug. 21, 1852, Topsham, Vt. - d. Nov. 23, 1917, Canon City, Colo.), governor of Colorado (1903-05, 1905).\n\nPeacock\n\nPeacock, Andrew (Sharp) (b. Feb. 13, 1939, Melbourne, Vic. - d. April 16, 2021, Austin, Texas), Australian politician. He was elected to parliament for the Melbourne establishment seat of Kooyong in 1966 as the replacement to no less a statesman than Sir Robert Menzies on Menzies's retirement after 17 years as prime minister, and Peacock was clearly seen as a potential prime minister as early as the mid-1960s. His most important early post, which launched his political career at centre stage, was as minister for the army (1969-72). During the Vietnam war he performed so well as a minister that he was rewarded with the plum post of foreign minister (1975-80) in the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. He also held various other portfolios, including minister advising the prime minister (1969-71), assistant to the treasurer (1971-72), external territories (1972), environment (two months in 1975), industrial relations (1980-81), and industry and commerce (1982-83). He came into direct opposition to Prime Minister Fraser, and in 1981 he began his long-awaited attempt to unseat Fraser from the leadership of the Liberal Party. Fraser resigned after losing the 1983 elections to Labor, and the Liberals elected Peacock leader. The leadership changed hands again in 1985 when John Howard was elected to replace him by a convincing majority. On May 9, 1989, Peacock's parliamentary colleagues gave him a last chance to lead the conservative parties to victory in an election. They dumped Howard and replaced him with Peacock, who, they hoped, would have a higher level of personal popularity than his predecessor. While Peacock supporters spoke of a phoenix rising from the ashes, Prime Minister Bob Hawke called him a \"recycled dunderhead.\" After Labour won the 1990 election, Peacock was replaced by John Hewson. In 1997-2000 he was ambassador to the United States.\n\nPeake, Karolína (b. Oct. 10, 1975, Prague, Czechoslovakia [now in Czech Republic]), a deputy prime minister (2011-13) and defense minister (2012) of the Czech Republic. She was also leader of the Liberal Democrats (2012-13).\n\nPeano, Camillo (b. June 5, 1863, Saluzzo, Cuneo province, Italy - d. May 13, 1930, Rome, Italy), treasury minister of Italy (1922). He was also minister of public works (1920-21).\n\nA. Pearce\n\nH. Pearce\n\nPearey\n\nPearce, Andrew (John) (b. Oct. 7, 1960), governor of Montserrat (2018-22). He was also British chargé d'affaires in Lithuania (2017).\n\nPearce, Francis Barrow (b. Sept. 16, 1866, London, England - d. June 11, 1926), acting commissioner (1907) and acting governor (1910) of Nyasaland and resident of Zanzibar (1913-22).\n\nPearce, Howard (John Stredder) (b. April 13, 1949, London, England), governor of the Falkland Islands (2002-06). He was also British high commissioner to Malta (1999-2002).\n\nPearey, David (Dacre) (b. July 15, 1948), governor of the British Virgin Islands (2006-10). He was also British high commissioner to Malawi (2004-06).\n\nPearkes\n\nPearkes, George R(andolph) (b. Feb. 26, 1888, Watford, England - d. May 30, 1984, Victoria, B.C.), Canadian politician. He went to Canada in 1906 and after serving with the Royal Northwest mounted police in the Yukon, enlisted as a private in the Canadian army in March 1915. He was wounded in action in France and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry at Passchendaele, Belgium, in 1917. After World War I, Pearkes remained in the army's permanent force. In World War II he was promoted to major general and served as commander of the 1st Canadian division and general officer commanding, Pacific command. He was elected to the House of Commons in the June 1945 election for the constituency of Nanaimo, B.C. He was reelected in 1949 for Nanaimo and in 1953, 1957, and 1958 for the constituency of Esquimalt-Saanich. He was appointed minister of national defense in the federal cabinet on June 21, 1957. He attended the Commonwealth prime ministers' conference in London, England, in 1957 and two meetings of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He welcomed Princess Margaret to Canada on July 28, 1958, on behalf of the Canadian government. In 1960-68 he was lieutenant governor of British Columbia.\n\nPears, Sir Steuart Edmund (b. 1875 - d. Sept. 9, 1931), resident in Mysore and chief commissioner of Coorg (1925-30) and chief commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province (1930-31); knighted 1931.\n\nPears, Thomas Caldwell (b. June 27, 1851, Madras [now Chennai], India - d. Nov. 17, 1921), British resident in Nepal (1901-02).\n\nPearse\n\nPearse, Patrick Henry, Irish Pádraig Anraí Mac Piarais (b. Nov. 10, 1879, Dublin, Ireland - d. May 3, 1916, Dublin), Irish leader. He joined the Gaelic League (founded in 1893 for the preservation of the Irish language), became an energetic member of its executive, and was editor (1903-09) of its weekly newspaper, An Claidheamh Soluis (\"The Sword of Light\"). To promote the language as a weapon against British domination, he published tales from old Irish manuscripts and a collection (1914) of his own poems in the modern Irish idiom. In 1908 he founded St. Enda's College (near Dublin), a bilingual school with its teaching based on Irish traditions and culture. When the Irish Volunteers were formed in November 1913, as a counterforce against the Ulster Volunteers (militant supporters of the union with Britain), he became a member of their provisional committee. After the movement split in September 1914, he became director of organization of the more extreme Nationalist section, which opposed any support for Britain in World War I. Convinced that Ireland might be freed only by the blood of martyrs, he delivered a famous oration on this theme in August 1915, at the burial of Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, a veteran Fenian. As a member of the supreme council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (from July 1914), he was instrumental in planning (January 1916) the Easter Rising. On Easter Monday, April 24, 1916, he proclaimed the provisional government (of which he had been chosen president) of the Irish Republic from the steps of the General Post Office in Dublin. The revolt was crushed; he surrendered on April 29 and, after a court-martial, was executed by a firing squad at Kilmainham Prison. He was responsible more than anyone else for establishing the republican tradition in Ireland.\n\nPearson, Arthur M(acDonald) (b. Feb. 26, 1938, Brandon, Man.), commissioner of Yukon Territory (1976-78).\n\nPearson, Aylmer Cavendish (b. Aug. 5, 1876 - d. March 15, 1926), governor of North Borneo (1915-22, 1925-26).\n\nPearson, Chris(topher William) (b. April 29, 1931, Lethbridge, Alta. - d. Feb. 14, 2014), government leader of Yukon Territory (1978-85).\n\nPearson, Sir Francis Fenwick, (1st) Baronet, byname Sir Frank Pearson (b. June 13, 1911 - d. Feb. 17, 1991), chief minister of Manipur (1947). He was Conservative MP for Clitheroe (1959-70) and was created a baronet in 1964.\n\nPearson, Frederick (b. Aug. 22, 1842, Pennsylvania - d. Dec. 23, 1890, New York City), naval commander in charge of Alaska (1881-82).\n\nL.B. Pearson\n\nPearson, Lester B(owles), byname Mike Pearson (b. April 23, 1897, Toronto, Ont. - d. Dec. 27, 1972, Ottawa, Ont.), prime minister of Canada (1963-68). He joined the diplomatic service in 1928 and became first secretary in the Department of External Affairs. He served on two royal commissions in 1931 and in 1935 became counselor of the Canadian high commissioner's office in London. Recalled to Canada in 1941 to become assistant undersecretary of state for external affairs, he was posted to Washington, D.C., in 1942 as minister-counsellor at the Canadian legation, and in January 1945 he was appointed ambassador to the United States. A year later he was recalled to Ottawa to become undersecretary of state for external affairs. He headed the Canadian delegation at the United Nations (1948-56) and was president of the UN General Assembly (1952-53). In 1948 he became secretary of state for external affairs in the Liberal government of Louis Saint Laurent, entering parliament for Algoma East, Ont., through a January 1949 by-election. In the latter year he represented Canada at the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In 1957 he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his contribution to defusing the Suez crisis of 1956. After the defeat of St. Laurent's government in 1957, he was elected to succeed him as leader of the Liberal Party in January 1958, becoming leader of the official opposition. He became prime minister in 1963 with only a plurality in parliament; the 1965 elections brought no change. His government introduced a national pension plan and a family assistance program, laid the groundwork for the National Free Medical Service, and introduced Canada's first distinctive national flag and an official national anthem. He resigned in 1968 and retired from politics.\n\nPearson, Peter Thomas Clayton (b. Oct. 22, 1954), administrator of the British Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus (2003-06).\n\nPease, Elisha M(arshall) (b. Jan. 3, 1812, Enfield, Conn. - d.

June 20, 1949, Chernovtsy, Ukrainian S.S.R.), governor of Magadan oblast (2013-18). He was also mayor of Magadan (2004-13).\n\nPechkoff, Zinovi, Russian Zinovy (Alekseyevich) Peshkov, original name Yeshua Zolomon (Movshevich) Sverdlov (b. Oct. 16, 1884, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia - d. Nov. 28, 1966, Neuilly, France), French diplomat; brother of Yakov Sverdlov. He was adopted by famous writer Maksim Gorky (real name Aleksey Peshkov) in 1902 and became a naturalized French citizen in 1915.

April 16, 1916, Milwaukee, Wis.), governor of Wisconsin (1891-95).\n\nPeckford\n\nPeckford, (Alfred) Brian (b. Aug. 27, 1942, Whitbourne, Newfoundland), premier of Newfoundland (1979-89). He first became involved in politics as a Liberal but joined the Progressive Conservative Party (PC) in 1969. In 1972 he was elected to the provincial House of Assembly and, after two years as special assistant to Premier Frank Moores, he was appointed minister of the Department of Municipal Affairs and Housing in 1974. In 1976 he became minister of mines and energy and, in 1978, minister of rural development as well. Called self-assertive and even brash by some observers, he first came to prominence when, as minister of mines and energy, he negotiated and implemented the province's oil and gas development regulations. They were so tough that the multinational oil companies stopped their explorations in the province, but Peckford believed that sooner or later Newfoundland's resources would be in demand no matter what the cost. Indeed, offshore exploration resumed in 1979. At the Newfoundland PC convention on March 17, 1979, he solidly won the post of party leader, replacing the retiring Moores. After succeeding Moores as premier on March 26, he hastily called a provincial election in which his Conservatives defeated the Liberals under Don Jamieson. His platform included promises of more attention to Labrador (the mainland part of the province) and programs to preserve and promote Newfoundland culture. He introduced financial programs that had distinct social overtones. He fought an epic battle with Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberals for the right to control Newfoundland's offshore wealth, both fish and oil.

Oct. 12, 1798, Queluz, Portugal - d. Sept. 24, 1834, Queluz), emperor of Brazil (1822-31) and (as Pedro IV) king of Portugal (1826-28). He was the son of King João VI of Portugal. When the French conquered Portugal in 1807, Pedro accompanied the royal family in its flight to Brazil. He remained there as regent when King João returned to Portugal in 1821. Pedro surrounded himself with ministers who counseled independence. When the Portuguese Cortes (parliament) demanded that Pedro return to Lisbon, he refused; when it sought to curb his authority, he declared Brazil independent in the grito do Ipiranga on Sept. 7, 1822. The next month he established Brazil as an empire. But his initial popularity soon waned as there was widespread resentment against the Portuguese nobility that influenced his court. When the constituent assembly of 1823 attempted to draft a liberal constitution, he dissolved that body and exiled the radical leader José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva. On March 25, 1824, Pedro accepted another constitution, drafted by the Council of State, but this did not reestablish his popularity. His autocratic manner, continuing interest in Portuguese affairs, and the failure of his military forces to uphold Brazil's claims to what is now Uruguay antagonized his subjects. Strong opposition in parliament and a series of local uprisings induced him to abdicate in 1831 in favour of his 5-year-old son Pedro II. He then returned to Portugal, fighting to secure the Portuguese throne for his daughter, Maria II. He had succeeded to that throne on the death of João VI in 1826; knowing that he had to abdicate because of incompatibility with his position as emperor of Brazil, he nevertheless used this brief window to issue a constitutional charter for Portugal. He abdicated in favour of Maria and served as regent for her from 1830 until four days before his death, at which point she was prematurely declared of age.\n\nPedro II (b. April 26, 1648, Lisbon, Portugal - d. Dec. 9, 1706, Lisbon), king of Portugal (1683-1706).\n\nPedro II\n\nPedro II, in full Pedro de Alcântara João Carlos Leopoldo Salvador Bibiano Francisco Xavier de Paula Leocâdio Miguel Rafael Gabriel Gonzaga (b. Dec. 2, 1825, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - d. Dec. 5, 1891, Paris, France), emperor of Brazil (1831-89). When he was five years old, his father, Pedro I, abdicated in his favour; after a nine-year regency he was declared of age on July 23, 1840, and was crowned emperor on July 18, 1841. Disturbances in the provinces, which had plagued the regency, continued for the next five years, but by that time the young emperor's profound concern for his subjects was recognized and he enjoyed almost unqualified support for 40 years. Considering himself the arbiter of Brazil's political life, he used his constitutional power to moderate the antagonistic groups in the country, astutely alternating support for the Liberal and Conservative parties. His government intervened in Uruguay and in 1852 Brazil's troops were instrumental in the defeat of the Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas. He led Brazil into the War of the Triple Alliance (with Argentina and Uruguay) against Paraguay (1864-70), gaining new territory and prestige for Brazil. By the end of his reign his support had weakened, a crucial factor being the issue of slavery. Though personally opposed to slavery, he felt that in Brazil's agriculturally based economy abolition would have to occur gradually. Complete emancipation was at last decreed in 1888. He also found himself removed from increasingly powerful elements in society, particularly the urban middle class and the military. In 1889 he was forced to abdicate by military leaders who considered the monarchy an anachronism. The imperial family went into exile in Europe. In 1920 his remains were returned to Brazil to be placed in a chapel in Petrópolis, the city (named after him) where he had his summer residence.\n\nPedro III\n\nPedro III, in full Pedro Clemente Francisco José António (b. July 5, 1717, Lisbon, Portugal - d. May 25, 1786, Ajuda, Portugal), king consort of Portugal (1777-86). The younger son of João V of Portugal, he was married in July 1760 to the daughter of his elder brother, King José I. When she became queen as Maria I (Feb. 24, 1777), Pedro got the courtesy style of king. He devoted himself entirely to religious practices.\n\nPedro IV: see Pedro I.\n\nPedro V, in full Pedro de Alcântara Maria Fernando Miguel Rafael Gabriel Gonzaga Xavier João António Leopoldo Víctor Francisco de Assis Júlio Amélio (b. Sept. 16, 1837, Lisbon, Portugal - d. Nov. 11, 1861, Lisbon), king of Portugal (1853-61). He was the eldest son of Queen Maria II. After succeeding his mother he had his father, Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg, as regent for him till he became of age on his 18th birthday. Meanwhile he went on a long tour of the more industrialized states of Europe; in England he formed a close understanding with the prince-consort Albert (his father's first cousin), with whom he later maintained a regular correspondence. Earnest and enlightened, Pedro devoted himself to his country's problems. In external affairs, he was concerned with the occupation of Cabinda, Molembo, and Ambriz, in northern Angola (1855); with the final abolition of slavery (1856); with the convention (1857) whereby the Holy See restored the effect of the Portuguese patronate over dioceses in India and the Far East, after having practically abolished it in 1838; and with the detention of the French slave ship Charles et Georges off the coast of Mozambique (1857), which led to conflict with the French government (1858-59). In Portugal itself he had to face successive epidemics of cholera and yellow fever (1854-57). He founded the Curso Superior de Letras (1859) for teaching literature, philosophy, and history at university level. He married Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in 1858, but she died in 1859; he died childless and was succeeded by his brother Luís.\n\nPedro, Alim (b.

June 16, 1912 - d. May 8, 2004), British resident in Brunei (1946-48) and resident commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands (1949-51); son of Sir William Peel. His career as a Conservative MP (1957-74) was notable for his controversial defense of the government's handling of the massacre of 11 suspected Mau Mau in Kenya. In July 1959, the House of Commons debated the deaths, which had been blamed on poisoned water but were found to have been the result of beatings administered by African guards at Hola concentration camp. Peel took an unfortunate tack when he said: \"There are obvious risks in dealing with desperate and subhuman individuals.\" This earned immediate protests from the opposition. He then tried to mitigate his remarks by explaining: \"If honourable members remember the type of oath that was taken by Mau Mau followers, I am staggered to think that they can come to any other conclusion but that such men were, for the time being at least, subhuman.\" He was subsequently appointed a junior whip and later a full whip and lord commissioner of the treasury until 1964; in that time he won great respect from fellow Tories for his hard work and efficiency. It was as a keen European that he made his mark in his later career. He was one of six Tory MPs who sent a letter to the principal European papers declaring that Britain did not intend to accept a French veto over its application to join the Common Market. He was a parliamentary delegate to the Council of Europe and later president of the Western European Union in 1972, when he was also elected president of the North Atlantic Assembly. After Britain joined the Common Market in 1973, he was knighted and appointed a member of the U.K. parliamentary delegation to the European Parliament at Strasbourg.\n\nPeel, Jonathan (b. Oct. 12, 1799, Bury, Lancashire, England - d. Feb. 13, 1879, Twickenham, Middlesex [now part of London], England), British secretary of state for war (1858-59, 1866-67); brother of Sir Robert Peel.\n\nPeel, Sir Robert, (2nd) Baronet (b. Feb. 5, 1788, Bury, Lancashire, England - d. July 2, 1850, London, England), British prime minister (1834-35, 1841-46). He entered Parliament in 1809 as Tory member for Cashel. In 1811 he was appointed undersecretary for the colonies, then became chief secretary for Ireland (1812-18). Known as \"Orange Peel\" he displayed strong anti-Catholic spirit, and was so fiercely attacked by Daniel O'Connell that he challenged him to a duel. In 1818-22 he was MP for the University of Oxford. In 1822 he re-entered the ministry as home secretary, working well with Foreign Secretary George Canning, but when Canning formed a Whig-Tory ministry, Peel, along with the Duke of Wellington and others, withdrew from office over Catholic emancipation (1827). Paradoxically, when the death of Canning led to the Wellington-Peel government in 1828, it advocated the relief of the Roman Catholics. As home secretary again, Peel organized the London police force. He succeeded his father as baronet in 1830. Later that year the Wellington-Peel ministry was succeeded by a Whig ministry under Earl Grey, which, in 1832, carried the Reform Bill, which Peel opposed. Rejected by Oxford in 1829, but returned for Westbury, he represented Tamworth from 1833 till his death. In 1834 he became Tory leader and accepted office as prime minister (and chancellor of the exchequer) but was replaced by the Whig Lord Melbourne four months later. The general election of 1841 was virtually a contest between Free Trade and Protection, and Protection won. Peel and the Conservatives were returned to office. He imposed an income tax (1842) and abolished or lowered custom duties. He repressed Irish unrest, and broke O'Connell's influence. But the potato blight in Ireland, and subsequent famine, rendered cheap corn a necessity. Peel informed his colleagues that the Corn Laws, which he formerly defended, were doomed. Lord Stanley (afterwards Earl of Derby), who replaced Peel, Lord George Bentinck, Benjamin Disraeli, and others formed a \"no-surrender\" Tory party, but with the Duke of Wellington, Sir James Graham, the Earl of Aberdeen, William Gladstone, and other eminent Conservatives the laws were repealed in June 1846. He then gave place to a Whig administration under Lord John Russell. During 1847-48 he was one of the most important props of the government, whose free-trade principles he had now accepted. On June 29, 1850, he was thrown from his horse and died days later.\n\nPeel, Robert Francis (b. April 30, 1874 - d. Aug. 10, 1924), governor of Saint Helena (1920-24).\n\nPeel, Sir William (b.

Nov. 16, 1794, Maromme, Seine-Inférieure [now Seine-Maritime], France - d. May 22, 1864, Algiers, Algeria), French general. Commissioned as an artillery second lieutenant in 1815, he took part in the expeditions to Spain (1823) and to the Peloponnese (1828-29). After his first brief service in Algeria (1830), he returned there in 1839, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, to take part in the campaign against the emir of Mascara, Abd-el-Kader. He shocked European opinion by smoking to death the Ouled-Riah tribe when it took shelter in caves near Mostaganem (June 1845). Governor-General Thomas Robert Bugeaud, however, protected him, and he was promoted to general (1846) and made commander of Oran province (1848-51). His furious temper and his sarcasm became notorious. In 1851 he was interim governor-general of Algeria. Subsequently, he played a leading role in the subjugation of the tribes of southern Algeria. During the Crimean War, when Gen. F.C. Canrobert failed to take Sevastopol, Pélissier was first given command of an army corps (January 1855), then appointed commander in chief (May 16). His attack of June 18 on the fort of Malakhov (Malakoff) was unsuccessful, but he defeated a Russian counterattack on the Traktir bridge over the Chernaya River on August 16, and both Malakhov and Sevastopol itself fell on September 8. Four days later he was made marshal of France, and on July 5, 1858, he was created duc de Malakoff. From March 1858 to April 1859 he was French ambassador to London. During the war of 1858 against Austria, he commanded the army of the Rhine. In November 1860 he was appointed governor-general of Algeria, where he served until his death.\n\nPelivan, Jure (b.

Nov. 18, 1834, Zwolle, Netherlands), acting governor of Overijssel (1830-31).\n\nPella\n\nPella, Giuseppe (b. April 18, 1902, Valdengo, Piemonte, Italy - d. May 31, 1981, Rome, Italy), prime minister (1953-54) and foreign minister (1953-54, 1957-58, 1959-60) of Italy. He became a member of the Fascist party and shortly before World War II served as deputy mayor of Biella, where he earned a reputation as a wizard of public finances. After the war, he was elected to the city council as a Christian Democrat and six months later he was elected to the Constituent Assembly that drew up the Italian constitution. He held the top economic post in Italy from 1947 to 1952. A strict conservative in his financial views, he was the dogged defender of the lira in the financial confusion of Europe after the war. In the De Gasperi government, whenever Pella's policies came under attack as too conservative, De Gasperi would change his title, but his work remained the same; he was minister of finance (1947-48, 1972), treasury (1948-51, 1952-53), and budget (1948-54, 1960-62). He became prime minister and budget minister in 1953 after the resignation of Alcide De Gasperi, the Christian Democrat leader who had headed every Italian government for the previous seven and a half years. Within a few weeks of assuming office, Pella faced a dispute with Yugoslavia over Trieste. After a blunt speech by Marshal Tito, he ordered Italy's best army division deployed on the eastern border and sent the Italian navy steaming up the Adriatic. A year later, another Italian government came to terms with Belgrade and reoccupied Trieste. The Pella government lasted barely five months and was marked by squabbles between De Gasperi and the Christian Democratic leadership. Thereafter, Pella had a feeble following within the party but was popular with Christian Democratic voters.\n\nPellegrini (Bevans), Carlos (Enrique José) (b. Oct. 11, 1846, Buenos Aires, Argentina - d. July 17, 1906, Buenos Aires), war minister (1879-80, 1885-86), vice president (1886-90), and president (1890-92) of Argentina.\n\nP.

He was also prefect of the départements of Somme (1940-42), Aisne (1942-43), Seine-et-Marne (1945-47), Haute-Garonne (1947-55), and Seine (1955-58).\n\nPelletier, Gérard (b. June 21, 1919, Victoriaville, Que. - d. June 22, 1997, Montreal, Que.), Canadian politician. He was minister without portfolio (1968), minister of communications (1971 [acting], 1972-75), ambassador to France (1975-81), and permanent representative to the United Nations (1981-84).\n\nM. Pelletier\n\nPelletier, Monique (Denyse), née Bédier (b. July 25, 1926, Trouville-sur-Mer, Calvados, France), French politician. In the 1970s she entered local politics, becoming assistant mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine, the richest suburb of Paris, and a member of the political bureau of the Republican Party, which supported Pres. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. In 1977 Giscard appointed her to lead a major national investigation into drug addiction and, in particular, the problems of drug abuse among young people. The conclusions of her report on drug abuse earned her the nickname \"Madame Anti-Drogue.\" In the beginning of 1978, she became secretary of state in the Ministry of Justice. On Sept. 12, 1978, she was appointed minister-delegate for the status of women, the first time that the government member responsible for women had been given ministerial rank (the first \"minister for women,\" Françoise Giraud, had the rank of secretary of state). Pelletier welcomed the opportunity to speak on equal terms with other ministers and declared that she saw herself as \"the permanent conscience of the government in questions relating to women.\" The energetic mother of seven embarked on the preparation of a reform of laws relating to marriage with the aim of making them more favourable to women. She also began examining the question of pensions for mothers who had had several children, but she rejected as unrealistic proposals for \"housewives' salary.\" The cost of such a salary, in her estimation, would exceed the total of receipts from income tax. She served until 1981 and then left politics.\n\nPellinen, Pavel (Danilovich), originally Paavo Pellinen (b. 1897 - d. [executed] 1937), executive/first secretary of the Communist Party committee of the Mordovian national okrug/autonomous oblast (1929-32).\n\nPelloux\n\nPelloux, Luigi (Girolamo) (b. March 1, 1839, La Roche, Savoy [now in France] - d. Oct. 26, 1924, Bordighera, Italy), prime minister of Italy (1898-1900). He fought in several battles against Austria, and as major commanded the brigade of artillery that breached the wall of Rome at Porta Pia (1870), thus allowing the occupation of the city, which was made the capital of united Italy. Elected to parliament in 1881 as deputy for Livorno, which he represented until 1895, he was promoted to general (1885) and served as minister of war (1891-93, 1896-97). In 1896 he was made a senator. In May 1898 he was sent as royal commissioner to Bari. Recognizing that the disturbances there arose from economic need, he succeeded in restoring public order without recourse to martial law. When similar outbursts in other Italian cities led to the downfall of the government in June, he was invited to form a cabinet, and took for himself the post of interior minister. He withdrew some bills of the previous administration that would have restricted civil liberties, but in February 1899 he introduced his own repressive public safety bill. To avoid defeat on his foreign policy, which featured an unsuccessful military expedition to China, he resigned in May and formed a second, strongly conservative government. Although the country was now quite calm, he attempted to make his earlier bill even more repressive, thus uniting the left in opposition against him. He had the bill passed by royal decree (June), but this was ruled void by the Court of Cassation (February 1900). His failure to overcome obstruction in the Chamber of Deputies led to a dissolution (May) and, after the general election, to his resignation (June 18). He was given command of an army corps at Turin (1900-02) and never regained political prominence.\n\nPëllumbi, Servet (Ismail) (b. Dec. 14, 1936, Korçë, Albania), Albanian politician. He was chairman of the Assembly (2002-05).\n\nPelly, Cornelius James (b. April 8, 1908 - d.

May 29, 1983, Moscow, Russian S.F.S.R.), Latvian Communist leader. A member of the Russian Communist Party from 1915, he was elected a deputy of the Petrograd Workers' and Soldiers' Soviet and took part in the Bolshevik revolution of November 1917 led by Lenin. In 1919 he was attached to the Red Army and was a participant in the unsuccessful attempt to establish Soviet power in Latvia. Pelse graduated from the Institute of Red Professors in 1931, became a member of the party organization in Kazakhstan in 1933, then served (1937-40) as a lecturer at the Moscow Higher Educational Institute. In June 1940 he played a leading role in the armed sovietization of Latvia. The following year he became a secretary of the Central Committee of the Latvian Communist Party and from 1959 was its first secretary. In 1956 he became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and in 1966 a member of the CPSU control commission. As the oldest ethnically non-Russian member of the Communist summit, he was honoured by having his ashes placed in the Kremlin wall in Moscow.\n\nPelser, Petrus Cornelius (b.

Peña\n\nS. Peña\n\nPeña, Federico (Fabian) (b. March 15, 1947, Laredo, Texas), mayor of Denver (1983-91) and U.S. secretary of transportation (1993-97).\n\nPeña (Cañete), Pedro Pablo (b.

March 6, 1937, Hato Nuevo, Valverde province, Dominican Republic - d. May 10, 1998, Cambita Garabitos, San Cristóbal province, Dominican Republic), Dominican Republic politician. He became secretary-general of the leftist Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) of Juan Bosch. By the time Bosch was elected president in 1962, Peña Gómez had emerged as a protégé. However, Bosch was ousted by a coup in 1963, which led to a civil war, and, in April 1965, a U.S. invasion. Peña Gómez headed the opposition to that intervention, which led to Joaquín Balaguer's becoming president. Repression was intense throughout that period, and Peña Gómez eventually had to leave the country, taking refuge in France. Bosch and Peña Gómez had a falling out that resulted in Bosch's breaking with the party that he had founded and setting up a new one. In 1982, Peña Gómez was elected mayor of Santo Domingo (until 1986), which automatically made him a strong contender for the presidency. But his party passed him by in 1986, with some of its leaders arguing that it would be impossible for a black man, especially one of Haitian descent, to defeat Balaguer, who was notorious for his disdain for blacks. The PRD lost to Balaguer anyway, and in 1990, Peña Gómez finally won the nomination. He finished third in a vote marred by widespread accusations of fraud after a campaign that was full of racial innuendo, but he vowed to try again. In 1994, he won his party's nomination for a second time, but had to contend with even more blatant race baiting and vote fraud. With Balaguer barred from succeeding himself, Peña Gómez finished ahead of two strong competitors in the first round of a special presidential vote in 1996, but was narrowly defeated by Leonel Fernández in the second round. He was also vice president of the Socialist International.\n\nPeña Nieto\n\nPeña Nieto, Enrique (b. July 20, 1966, Atlacomulco, México, Mexico), governor of México (2005-11) and president of Mexico (2012-18). He joined the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1984 and became active in México state politics. He was the sixth member of his extended family to serve as governor of the state (the closest relation being Salvador Sánchez Colín, his great-uncle). He based his agenda on 608 compromisos (commitments) that he made to his constituents. He continued this practice while campaigning for the presidency, touting 266 compromisos. Like his opponents, Andrés Manuel López Obrador of the Party of the Democratic Revolution and Josefina Vázquez Mota of the National Action Party, he pledged to improve the economy and to combat the widespread drug-related violent crime. His youthful good looks and frequent association with celebrities served to increase his popular appeal, but he was dogged by claims that Mexico's primary television stations were biased in their coverage of him. In the event, his message and appeal were enough to overcome the PRI's legacy of authoritarian rule and corruption. He won the July 1, 2012, election with about 39% of the vote, amid accusations of widespread irregularities and vote-buying. A recount of more than half the votes upheld his victory. Still, López Obrador refused to concede, and the result could not be ratified until his complaint was ruled on by the Electoral Tribunal, which upheld the results on August 31, making Peña Nieto president-elect; he was sworn in December 1. In November 2014 protests erupted nationwide in reaction to the disappearance of 43 students from a teacher's college in Guerrero state in September. The students' parents were highly critical of Peña Nieto for his administration's handling of the investigation. Then came corruption allegations concerning his acquisition of a lavish private residence from a government contractor at a lower-than-market price; and in 2015 the escape of drug lord Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán from Mexico's most secure prison. In 2016 he invited U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, who had said Mexico would pay for his proposed border wall. Peña Nieto said he told Trump Mexico would not do so, but Trump continued making the claim, and the meeting was seen as giving Trump an unnecessary boost. The issue led to cancellations of further meetings after Trump took office.\n\nPeña Triviño, Eduardo (b. Aug. 26, 1936, Palenque, Ecuador), vice president of Ecuador (1995-96). He was also education minister (1992-94).\n\nPeña Vicuña, Nicolás (R.) (b. 1842?, Santiago, Chile - d.

June 7, 1959, Columbus, Ind.), governor of Indiana (2013-17) and U.S. vice president (2017-21). Also a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives (2001-13), the Republican was chosen by Donald Trump as his vice presidential running mate in 2016. Soft-spoken but strongly conservative, he once had a radio talk show and described himself as \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf,\" referring to a notorious right-wing radio blowhard. With the success of the Trump ticket, he could have been expected as vice president to do much of the actual policy work for which Trump would have neither qualification nor inclination. In the event, however, his pronouncements mostly suggested that he, like other Trump appointees, was mainly chosen for his unquestioning loyalty and obsequiousness, being ready to defend the indefensible and making few statements without lavishing praise on the president. He was renominated with Trump in 2020, but the ticket went down to defeat in November. As Trump refused to recognize the results and all else having failed, he asked Pence to apply a fringe constitutional theory that would allow the vice president, when presiding over the formality of counting the electoral vote in Congress, to just reject any state's submitted votes. As Pence indicated his refusal, Trump incited thousands of supporters to march to the Capitol at the time of the session and \"show strength.\" The Capitol was stormed, and some of the raging invaders chanted \"Hang Mike Pence\" and might well have done so had they gotten hold of him, having already erected a gallows outside. Yet even this did not bring Pence to a public break with Trump, and he rejected calls to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president. Only in 2023 did he become more critical, and in June announced his own (long-shot) candidacy for the 2024 Republican nomination, opposing Trump; he dropped out already in October.\n\nPendarovski\n\nPendarovski, Stevo (b.

Oct. 24, 1898, Xiangtan, Hunan province, China - d. Nov. 29, 1974, Beijing, China), Chinese military leader. He was a military commander under Chiang Kai-shek and a participant in the Northern Expedition (1926-27) to unite China under a single government. In 1927 he broke with Chiang, who attempted to rid the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) of leftist elements. In 1928 Peng joined the Communists and led his forces in guerrilla operations against the Kuomintang. He quickly became a top military commander in the forces led by Zhu De and Mao Zedong. After the Communists were encircled in south-central China he participated in the retreat to the northwest known as the Long March (1934-35). From the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 to 1954 he ranked second only to Zhu in the Communists' military hierarchy. During the war he served as deputy commander in chief of the main Communist forces, known as the 8th Route Army. When the war ended he was elected to the Communist Party's Politburo. In the civil war against the Kuomintang (1946-49) he was the conqueror of the northwestern provinces. In the Korean War he commanded the Chinese forces, known as the Chinese People's Volunteers, and signed the armistice at Panmunjom on July 27, 1953. He became the first defense minister of the People's Republic and a vice-premier in 1954, was promoted to marshal in 1955. When he attacked the policies of Mao's Great Leap Forward in 1959, he was removed as defense minister, but nominally retained his posts as vice-premier and vice-chairman of the National Defense Council until 1965. In 1967 he was dismissed from the Central Committee of the party. He was posthumously \"rehabilitated\" in December 1978.\n\nPeng Hanzhang (b. 1890, Tongchuan, Sichuan, China - d. Aug. 12, 1927, Hankou [now in Wuhan], Hubei, China), military (1925) and civil (1925-26) governor of Guizhou.

Oct. 12, 1902, Quwo county, Shanxi province, China - d. April 26, 1997, Beijing, China), Chinese politician. He joined the Communist Party in 1923 and organized movements of workers and students in various places. He served six years in prison (1929-35). After the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, he founded anti-Japanese bases in the north. In 1945 he became a member of the party's Central Committee and Politburo and in 1948 head of the party's organization department and party chief of Beiping (Beijing). After the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, he was appointed mayor of Beijing in 1951. A number of major construction projects in Beijing were completed under his leadership. He sided with Deng Xiaoping in rebelling against the Great Leap Forward, a disastrous plan to accelerate the pace of development, which resulted in mass starvation. In 1966, he used his leading position in the capital to try to block criticism of a play about a Ming Dynasty official wrongfully dismissed by the emperor. Mao, however, saw the play as an attack on him and his economic policies. Mao exiled Peng to the countryside, making him one of the first victims of the Cultural Revolution. Rehabilitated in 1978, he was widely credited for creating a legal structure to prevent the reemergence of the arbitrary rule Mao enjoyed. He regained his seat in the Politburo in 1979 and became vice-chairman and, in 1983, chairman of the National People's Congress (parliament). Although he was a close associate of Deng's, he was also opposed to the scale and pace of Deng's economic reforms. Peng, considered one of the \"Eight Immortals,\" retired in 1988 but remained a force in politics, supporting the suppression of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations.\n\nPengel, Johan Adolf, byname Jopie Pengel (b.

Aug. 10 [July 30, O.S.], 1718, Ruscombe, Berkshire, England), governor of Pennsylvania (1682-84, 1699-1701). A convinced Quaker, he was sent to the Tower of London in 1668 for denying the Trinity. He was again imprisoned in 1670 (for keeping his hat on in court, although acquitted of the charge of promoting a riot) and 1671 (for illegal preaching). He then visited the Netherlands and Germany for the advancement of Quakerism and in 1672 traveled as a minister through England at a time when persecution had been temporarily suspended. He became involved in American colonization in 1675 when Quakers chose him to serve as mediator in a dispute over West Jersey. He drew up the settlers' celebrated \"Concessions and Agreements\" charter in 1676. In 1681 he obtained a grant of territory in North America, called Pennsylvania in honour of his father, Adm. Sir William Penn (1621-70), intending to establish a home for his co-religionists. He sailed with his emigrants for the Delaware in 1682. In November he held his famous interview with the Native Americans on the site of Philadelphia. He planned the city, and for two years governed the colony wisely and tolerantly, within the restrictions of Puritanism. He returned to England (1684-99) to help his persecuted Quaker brethren. His influence with James II and his belief in his good intentions were curiously strong and, through his exertions, in 1686 all persons imprisoned on account of their religious opinions (including 1,200 Quakers) were released. After the accession of William III, Penn was accused of treasonable adherence to the deposed king, but was acquitted in 1693. In 1699 he returned to Pennsylvania, where his constitution had proved unworkable, and had to be much altered. He did something to mitigate the evils of slavery, but held black slaves himself. He departed for England in 1701. His last years were embittered by legal disputes and he spent nine months in the Fleet Street debtors' prison (1708).\n\nPenn Nouth, Samdech (b.

He received the title of Samdech in January 1956. His adherence to Norodom Sihanouk's policies continued after the latter's exile in 1970, but he had increasing reservations about Sihanouk's association with the Khmer Rouge insurgents. He was prime minister of Sihanouk's alternative government from 1970, at first in exile in Beijing but from 1975 to 1976 in Phnom Penh.\n\nPenna, Herculano Ferreira (b.

Sept. 8, 1900, near Dudleyville, Ala. - d. May 30, 1989, Washington, D.C.), U.S. politician. As a first-term Florida legislator (1929-30), the Democrat sponsored his first bill for the elderly, exempting older anglers from buying fishing licenses. He then lost a reelection bid after opposing a resolution to censure Mrs. Herbert Hoover for inviting a Negro to the White House. Elected to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy in 1936, he was called a \"fighting liberal\" by Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt. He endorsed Roosevelt's New Deal policies and ardently advocated the adoption of the legislation that created Social Security, a minimum wage, and medical assistance for the elderly and for handicapped children. Pepper, called \"Red Pepper\" by some for his red hair and fiery oratory and by others for his liberal views, lost his Senate seat in the 1950 election, at the height of the McCarthy period, after a campaign notorious for smears and innuendo. But when the state gained an additional congressional seat as a result of reapportionment, he ran for it and won (1962), holding it until his death. He became a national spokesman for the elderly. As chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging, he was instrumental in reorganizing the nearly bankrupt Social Security system and in forcing Pres. Ronald Reagan to back down on reducing benefits. In 1983 he became chairman of the crucial Rules Committee. He sponsored a bill, passed in 1986, that abolished mandatory retirement in the federal government and raised the retirement age from 65 to 70 in the private sector. He was also instrumental in the passage of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. Pres.

He removed Ydígoras in a coup, declared a state of emergency, and canceled elections. He then began a crackdown on a growing leftist insurgency. Known for his brutal disregard for human rights, his harsh measures nevertheless did not stamp out the guerrillas.

May 11, 1812, London), British prime minister (1809-12); son of John Perceval, Earl of Egmont. In 1796 he entered Parliament as member for Northampton and supported Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. An evangelical and ardent opponent of Catholic emancipation, he once identified Napoléon Bonaparte as the \"woman drunken with the blood of the saints\" of Revelation 17:3-6. In 1801, on the formation of the government of Henry Addington, he was appointed solicitor general. In 1802 he became attorney general, retaining that post through Pitt's second administration (1804-06). In 1807 he became chancellor of the exchequer and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster under the Duke of Portland, whom he succeeded as prime minister in 1809. Initially considered by many as a mere transitional figure, he surprised everyone by surviving a succession of crises, including King George III losing his sanity; he earned the favour of the prince regent and by March 1812 the cabinet was fully under his control, political leader George Canning seeing no reason why Perceval should not remain in power for 20 years. Only weeks later, however, he was shot and killed in the lobby of the House of Commons by John Bellingham, a man who had vainly applied to the government for redress of a grievance dating back to 1804 when he had been arrested for debt in Arkhangelsk, Russia, and British diplomats did not act on his appeals for help. (Bellingham was hanged seven days later.) Perceval was the only British prime minister ever assassinated.\n\nPércovich Roca, Luis (Ciro) (b. July 14, 1931, Yungay, Peru - d.

In 1990 he was elected to the state Senate as a Democrat; he was easily reelected and was elected Senate majority leader in 1994 and Senate president pro tem in 1997. His major legislative success was a law to deregulate natural gas; he voted against Gov. Zell Miller's lottery to fund Hope scholarships and opposed a moment of silence bill because he favoured prayer in schools. In 1998 he announced that he was switching parties and running for reelection as a Republican; he said his values were not the same as Bill Clinton's and those of other Democrats and that his efforts to change the party had not worked. He was stripped of his leadership posts and staff, but was reelected as a Republican with 70% of the vote. In December 2001, after his Senate seat had been hacked up in redistricting, he resigned his seat and announced he was running for governor. Coming from south (or at least central) Georgia, he employed a rural strategy. It helped him win 51% in the August 2002 primary against state school superintendent Linda Schrenko (28%) and former Cobb County commissioner Bill Byrne (21%). Then, in the biggest shock of election night 2002, Perdue beat Gov. Roy Barnes 51%-46%. Barnes led very narrowly in metro Atlanta, 49%-48%, but Perdue won the rest of the state 55%-43%. He became the first Republican governor of Georgia since Reconstruction. In 2006, unlike in 2002, Perdue led the race from the start. Buoyed by a mountain of campaign cash, a relatively strong economy, and an easygoing, everyman image, he became the first Republican governor in the state's history to be reelected, defeating Democrat Mark Taylor 58%-38%.\n\nPereda Asbún, Juan (b.

He then created the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV) in 1981 and was reelected by the National Assembly in 1981 and 1986. A modest, fatherly figure, he laid the foundations for genuine participatory democracy within a one-party state and in July 1990 relinquished his position as secretary-general of the ruling PAICV as a step towards the introduction of a multiparty system.
