        "text": "With a blend of classic elegance and modern sophistication, the renowned Omni William Penn has served as Pittsburgh’s premier hotel since 1916. Its original owner, Henry Clay Frick, had long hoped that the hotel would rival the great Grand Dames of Europe in its luxury and elegance. To actualize his dream, he hired the renowned architectural firm Janssen and Abbot for the project. Led by Benno Janssen and Franklin Abbot, the firm designed the building based on the principles of Beaux-Arts architecture. Janssen in particular was a popular architect among Pittsburgh’s most prominent citizens, having trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris during his youth. As such, the city’s elite hired him to design a number of other well-known buildings in Pittsburgh, including the Long Vue Country Club, the Mellon Institute, and the Pittsburgh Athletic Association. The initial phase of the hotel included 1,000 guestrooms, and an elegant two-tier Grand Ballroom located on the 17th floor. Completed in a year and at the cost of $6 million, the William Penn was the last major construction project that Henry Clay Frick would undertake in his lifetime.\n\nBeaux-Arts architecture itself originally began at the École des Beaux-Arts during the 1830s. There was much resistance to the Neoclassism of the day among French artists, who yearned for the intellectual freedom to pursue less rigid design aesthetics. Four instructors in particular were responsible for establishing the movement: Joseph-Louis Duc, Félix Duban, Henri Labrouste, and Léon Vaudoyer. The training that these instructors created involved fusing architectural elements from several earlier styles, including Imperial Roman, Italian Renaissance, ad Baroque. As such, a typical building created with Beaux-Arts-inspired designs would feature a rusticated first story, followed by several more simplistic ones. A flat roof would then top the structure. Symmetry became the defining character, with every building’s layout featuring such elements as balustrades, pilasters, and cartouches. Sculptures and other carvings were commonplace throughout the design, too. Beaux-Arts only found a receptive audience in France and the United States though, as most other Western architects at the time gravitated toward British design principles.\n\nOmni William Penn subsequently experienced another series of extensive renovations when Frick sold the structure to Eugene Eppley in 1928. The construction work was immense, as Eppley added 600 new accommodations and a slew of cutting-edge facilities. In just a matter of months, the hotel became the second largest of its kind throughout the entire world. Yet, the greatest part of Eppley’s renovations involved the creation of a new meeting space opposite of the Grand Ballroom called the “Urban Room.” Designed by Joseph Urban, this spectacular venue functioned as a secondary ballroom for the hotel. Urban himself had built a national reputation for his brilliant use of Art Deco design aesthetics. As such, the space featured many outstanding Art Deco architectural elements that made the Urban Room radiate a sense of tranquil elegance. The room’s most defining feature was a series of 14 brilliantly painted murals adorned symmetrically between its tall reflective panels of black Carrara glass.\n\nThe hotel has since undergone a series of additional—yet smaller—renovations during the 1960s, 1980s, and 2000s. Much of the work involved reducing the number of available guestrooms from its astronomically high-count of 1,600 to a more manageable 650. The hope in every case was to enhance the quality of the rooms without sacrificing their great historical character. An investment company called Nomarl truly began the process when it lowered the amount to 900 in 1968. The Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) then continued the trend two decades later, spending some $20 million to bring that number further down to 650. Renovations initiated by Omni Hotels and Resorts in 2001 focused more on enhancing the luxury of the Omni William Penn. The total cost of the project went as high as $22 million.\n\n1916: Omni William Penn debuted for a lively crowd on March 9. Renowned industrialist Henry Clary Frick oversaw the hotel’s development, spending a total of $6 million to complete it. Among the guests attending that attended the opening-night gala were Pittsburgh Mayor Joseph Armstrong, actress Lillian Russell, and U.S. Secretary of State Philander Knox.\n\n1917: President Theodore Roosevelt gave a resounding speech in the lobby of the William Penn at the 1917 Loyal Order of the Moose convention. Founded in 1888, the Loyal Order of the Moose was—and still is—a fraternal organization that supports at-risk children. Roosevelt’s speech marked the beginning of a tradition of U.S. presidents holding court inside the hotel.\n\n1921: A banquet in honor of Field Marshall Ferdinand Foch at the William Penn. Ferdinand Foch was the Supreme Allied Commander of all Allied forces during World War I, coordinating the various strategies of the French, British, and American militaries.\n\n1928: Renowned hotelier Eugene Eppley acquired the controlling interest over the William Penn through his business, the Eppley Hotel Company. Eppley subsequently began a massive renovation of the building, which saw the addition of 600 guestrooms and the beautiful Urban Room. As such, the William Penn became the second-largest structure of its kind throughout the entire world.\n\n1930: Governors from the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia congregated at the hotel to host a special “tri-state” gala. The event was organized to help coordinate the development of the Lincoln Highway through their respective states. Another is also held at the William Penn that commemorated the 10th anniversary of the KDKA-AM radio station. A speech from President Herbert Hoover hailing the KDKA-AM served as the highlight of the night.\n\n1938: A young bandleader named Lawrence Welk played in the hotel’s Terrace Room on New Year’s Eve. This performance would help launch Welk’s career as a popular musician. He would frequently return to the William Penn , as such.\n\n1939: The Annual Dapper Dan Sports Award Banquet was held inside the William Penn. A charitable event that raised money for Pittsburgh-based youth athletic programs, the dinner honored boxer Billy Conn as its “Sportsman of the Year.” The next 20 Dapper Dan Sports Award Banquets were then held at the hotel.\n\n1940: Hamstrung financially by the economic hardships of the Great Depression, Eppley eventually sold the hotel to Statler Hotels. But Eppley would acquire enough capital to buy the business back at the beginning of the following decade.\n\n1942: The United Steelworkers held a major conference in response to wartime steel needs and accepted the 44 cents wage proposed by the War Labor Board. Harry S. Truman would then give a speech at the William Penn some two years later during his stint as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Vice President.\n\n1948: Retired General of the Army and Army Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall, delivered a nationally syndicated address to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. His speech before the group ended the many rumors circulating throughout the country that he would challenge Truman in the upcoming 1952 election cycle.\n\n1954: The Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce held its 80th-anniversary celebration at the William Penn, in which it honored some 118 historic hospitals, schools, and businesses. The event was hosted by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s Alan Scaife, who also ran one of the most historic companies in the city. President Dwight D. Eisenhower also stopped by the hotel, giving an impassioned height of his reelection campaign.\n\n1956: Despite Eppley’s enthusiastic management of the William Penn, he decided to sell his ownership stake in the business once again. This time, Eppley sold the building to Sheraton Hotels and Resort, which proceeded to rename it as the “Penn-Sheraton Hotel.”\n\n1963: Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson gave a major speech at the hotel, spending the night in its glorious presidential suite. The visit occurred just three months before Johnson became president following the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas.\n\n1968: A local investment firm called Nomarl decided to purchase the Penn-Sheraton Hotel following an eight-month long strike by unionized hotel employees. Vowing to improve working conditions, the investors began an extensive restoration of the building that improved both its quality and character.\n\n1971: The Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) purchased the William Penn from the investment company Nomarl. It subsequently changed the name of the business back to the “William Penn Hotel.” Around the same time, the President of the Pittsburgh Zoo, Edward Magee, addressed a Rotary conference held inside the hotel. Among the props that Magee brought to his presentation was an 8-month-old elephant.\n\n1980: Maureen Reagan on the campaign trail for her father, Ronald Reagan speaks at a fundraiser at the hotel. Ronald Reagan then visited the William Penn shortly thereafter to give his own campaign speech.\n\n1984: ALCOA formed a partnership with Westin Hotels to manage the hotel more efficiently. In doing so, the two parties agreed to rename the hotel as the “Westin William Penn.” Alcoa and Westin Hotels then proceed to invest some $20 million into renovating the building.\n\n2001: Omni Hotels and Resorts purchased the Westin William Penn from Alcoa, rebranding it as the “Omni William Penn” in the process. Omni Hotels and Resorts then spent $22 million completing its own series of renovations to the structure.\n\n2010: The hotel has a $25 million renovation that adds a meeting room on the 17th floor and upgrades the lobby and all the guest rooms. Part of the renovation process included the opening of “Speakeasy,” which coincided with the repeal of Prohibition. For its efforts, the Omni William Penn received its first Four Diamond Rating from the American Automobile Association. The hotel then became a member of Historic Hotels of America.\n\n2014: Three different movies use the Omni William Penn to shoot several different scenes: Foxcatcher (2014), Southpaw (2015) and Concussion (2015). One of the films, Foxcatcher, was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Actors, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Director."
