She has since appeared in other theatre and television roles.\n\nAriana's music career began in 2011 with the soundtrack album \"Music from Victorious\". In 2013, she released her first studio album Yours Truly, which entered atop the US Billboard 200. The album's lead single, The Way, opened in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, with critics comparing her wide vocal range to that of Mariah Carey.\n\nAriana's second studio album, My Everything (2014), entered at number one in the US and charted in the top 10 in 24 other countries. With the lead single, Problem and several other singles, she was continuously in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 for 34 weeks and had the most top 10 singles of any artist in 2014. The next year, she gave her first world tour, The Honeymoon Tour, to promote My Everything. In 2016, she released her third studio album Dangerous Woman, which charted at number two on the Billboard 200. The title track debuted at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, making her the first person in the history of that chart to have the lead singles from each of their first three albums debut within the top 10 in the US. In 2017, Ariana gave her international Dangerous Woman Tour.\n\nAs of June 2017, Ariana's music videos had been viewed a total of more than nine billion times online. Her accolades include three American Music Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and four Grammy Award nominations. All three of her albums have been certified platinum by the RIAA. She has supported a range of charities and has a large following on social media. In 2016, Time named Ariana one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual list.\n\nA natural talent with a striking presence, Haley Bennett continues to establish herself as one of Hollywood's most dynamic actresses.\n\nUpcoming, Bennett will star opposite Austin Stowell in Carlo Mirabella-Davis's SWALLOW, on which she also serves as an executive producer. Bennett plays 'Hunter,' a pregnant, young housewife, whose seemingly perfect existence takes an alarming turn when she begins compulsively and uncontrollably eating dangerous objects. The film made its world premiere at the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival, garnering massive critical acclaim, including Bennett's award for Best Actress. The film later appeared at the 2019 Deauville Film Festival, where it was awarded the Prix sp√©cial du 45E and nominated for the Grand Special Prize. IFC Films is set to release the film in March 2020.\n\nFollowing, Bennett will be seen in Ron Howard's HILLBILLY ELEGY for Netflix. Amy Adams and Glenn Close co-star in the film. Based on J.D. Vance's bestselling memoir that follows three generations of an Appalachian family as told by its youngest member, a Yale law student is forced to return to his hometown. Bennett will also star in Antonio Campos's Netflix thriller THE DEVIL ALL THE TIME alongside Robert Pattinson, Bill Skarsgard, and Jason Clarke. Set in rural southern Ohio and West Virginia, the film follows a cast of compelling and bizarre characters from the end of World War II to the 1960s. Both films are set for release in 2020.\n\nBennett's other film credits include THE RED SEA DIVING RESORT opposite Chris Evans; THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE opposite Miles Teller; THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN also starring Emily Blunt, and Rebecca Ferguson; THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN opposite Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt; Warren Beatty's RULES DON'T APPLY; Antoine Fuqua's hit film THE EQUALIZER with Denzel Washington and Gregg Araki's festival darling KABOOM, which premiered at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2010.\n\nBennett made her on screen debut opposite Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant in the Marc Lawrence-directed film MUSIC AND LYRICS.

She was born in the Bab El Oued district of Algiers in Algeria, the daughter of composer and jazz musician Safy Boutella, and an architect mother. She started classical dance education when she was five years old. In 1992, at age 10, she left Algeria with her family and moved to France, where she started rhythmic gymnastics, joining the French national team at age 18. Sofia started with hip hop and street dance, and was part of a group called the Vagabond Crew. She also participated in a group called Chienne de Vie and Aphrodites. She has been rehearsing since age 17 with choreographer Blanca Li, and danced in several film and television appearances, as well as commercials and concert tours.\n\nIn 2007, her breakthrough arrived when she was picked for the Jamie King choreography for Nike as a role model of femininity and hip-hop. This was a major boost to her career and led to more work alongside stars like Madonna in her Confessions Tour, and Rihanna. Sofia successfully auditioned for Michael Jackson's This Is It Tour, but could not attend due to the extension of Madonna's tour, whose dates coincided with Jackson's residency. In February 2011, she was the main character in Michael's last music video Michael Jackson: Hollywood Tonight (2011).\n\nSofia played the lead character Eva in the drama film StreetDance 2 (2012), she starred as the assassin Gazelle in Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014), an alien warrior named Jaylah in Star Trek Beyond (2016), the main antagonist, Princess Ahmanet, in Universal's Dark Universe film Die Mumie (2017), and an undercover French agent in Atomic Blonde (2017) alongside Charlize Theron, and many other great movies since then.\n\nGolden Globe Award, Critics' Choice Award, Teen Choice Award nominee and Imagen Award winner Jaime Camil, named by 'Vanity Fair' as one of the Best New TV Characters of 2014, plays \"the scene-stealing comedic bright spot,\" Rogelio de la Vega, the supremely vain, but totally well-meaning, famous telenovela star and Gina Rodriguez's father on the CW hit series Jane the Virgin (2014).\n\nCamil began his career as a singer performing alongside Cuban icons Amaury Guti√©rrez and Francisco C√©spedes before going on to star in the mega hit telenovelas Mi destino eres t√∫ (2000) and La fea m√°s bella (2007) in his native Mexico. He has starred in a multitude of award-winning films including Pulling Strings (2013), 200 Cartas (2013) (alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda), and 7 Days - Sieben Tage bis U2 (2005) (which earned him the \"Best Supporting Actor\" honors from the Premios ACE and the Mexican Cinema Journalists respectively).\n\nCamil's career continued to skyrocket following star turns in the gender-bending comedy Por ella soy Eva (2012) and the fish-out-of-water romp Qu√© pobres tan ricos (2013). He has recorded four platinum selling albums and has led many musicals in Mexico City including 'West Side Story,' 'Hook,' 'Aladdin,' 'El diluvio que viene,' and others. In 2005, he led the Broadway-bound musical 'The Mambo Kings.'\n\nCamil stars on the hit CW sitcom Jane the Virgin (2014), where he has quickly become a fan favorite, and he just recently wrapped a two-month run on Broadway starring as Billy Flynn in America's longest-running hit musical 'Chicago.' Camil will return to the big screen in 2016, starring in the Spanish-language comedies Maurice, Modisto de Se√±oras and 'Clipped.'\n\nCamil, along with his wife and two children, resides in Los Angeles.\n\nDavid Charvet, who rose to international fame on the hit shows Baywatch - Die Rettungsschwimmer von Malibu (1989) and Melrose Place (1992), is now moving into the feature front, having completed production on starring roles in two films.\n\nIn the sports feature Green Flash (2008), Charvet plays \"Cameron Day\", a star basketball player with a future in the NBA until he chokes in a key game, with the after-effects causing him to settle into an aimless life. A chance encounter takes him into the professional beach volleyball scene in Southern California, but his old demons begin creeping in again, threatening his chances at success. The film marks the directorial debut of Paul Nihipali Jr. Jr., who was a member of the U.S. National Volleyball team from 1995-1997 as well as a three-time All-American and captain for the UCLA men's championship-winning volleyball team. The film, shot on location in Southern California, is produced by Cameron Dieterich and Joseph John Barmettler, with Bob Smiland executive producing.

John Rhys-Davies, Joss Ackland and Carmen Chaplin co-star in the film, which was budgeted at $10 million.\n\nCharvet launched his acting career on the world's most watched show of its time, Baywatch - Die Rettungsschwimmer von Malibu (1989), in which he developed a strong international following playing lifeguard \"Matt Brody\" for three seasons. He continued to expand his fan base with his role of \"Craig Field\" for two seasons on Melrose Place (1992).

He has sold over 2.5 million albums to date, with three of his singles (\"Leap of Faith\", \"Should I Leave\" and \"The Tears in My Eyes\") charting in the Top 10.\n\nCharvet has traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia, performing for packed arenas, writing music and experiencing new cultures. He has collaborated with top songwriters such as Ty Lacy (who wrote LeAnn Rimes' single \"I Need You\"), and he has also worked with Robbie Williams' producer Steve Power. Charvet has recorded a duet with Bryan Adams, and he also worked on a duet with Seal.\n\nAlthough his music career has taken center stage in recent years, Charvet has always sought new creative challenges. He has now returned to the United States where he is happy to be back to his first love of acting and bringing his new palette of colors to that domain. \"Music has helped me to evolve tremendously as an artist and has enriched me personally in so many ways\", he offers. \"I left America a boy and have come back a man\".\n\nCharvet has trained with such renowned acting teachers as Roy London and Larry Moss. He currently resides in Malibu, CA with his fianc√©e Brooke Burke and their infant daughter, Heaven Rain.\n\nThe youngest of three girls, Christina was born just outside Toronto.
