        "text": "Regan Bowering\n\nFulbright Postgraduate All Disciplines Award, Visiting PhD Student in Music – Columbia University\n\nAs a deeply personal, yet highly communicative art form, music unites disparate people, places, and historical moments and can articulate the most elusive aspects of human experience. These qualities inspired Regan to pursue a multi-faceted career of music performance, event management, academic study and teaching. Her current PhD research in Musicology (Goldsmiths, University of London) and practice as a percussionist, improviser and sound artist grapple with music's elusive qualities through a study of the relationships between rhythm, technology, and lived experiences of time in avant-garde music since 1960.\n\nRegan graduated from Goldsmiths, University of London with a first-class Undergraduate degree in Music in 2019, and a Masters with distinction in 2020. Prior to beginning her academic studies as a mature student, she worked for eight years in music event management. Since then, Regan has used this experience to connect academia with the wider arts community through events, conferences, and the co-founding of an online journal for research and practice on audiovisual cultures.\n\nDuring her Fulbright year as a visiting student at Columbia, Regan will complete her PhD archival research and develop two new practical projects under the supervision of Professor Seth Cluett, Director of the Columbia Computer Music Centre. This incredible opportunity will enable Regan to foster an international network of scholars, musicians, and sound artists and immerse herself in the unique creative histories and contemporary happenings of New York City.\n\nJasmine Brittan\n\nFulbright All Disciplines Postgraduate Award, Masters of Transportation Systems - NYU\n\nJasmine Brittan, from Derby, is an ambitious engineering graduate of the University of Warwick.\n\nDuring her undergraduate career, Jasmine worked on the sensor experiments team at the European Space Agency and was selected as a youth delegate to COP27. She also was involved in fundraising for the Warwick Boring Team, global finalists in Elon Musk’s Not-a-Boring Competition. Through this work, she was selected as an Engineering Leaders Scholar by the Royal Academy of Engineering.\n\nIn the US, Jasmine will pursue a degree combining her technical engineering background with policy. Her specific research ambitions pertain to the integration of urban air mobility transport within society.\n\nAlongside her academics, Jasmine hopes to become involved in sport and entrepreneurship.

She further hopes to become involved in dance as one of the passions she has followed since the age of three.\n\nAmy Campbell\n\nFulbright All Disciplines Postgraduate Award, Masters in Climate and Society - Columbia University\n\nAmy is in the UK negotiations team to the UNFCCC COP, working in climate diplomacy, following a climate policy track in the UK's Civil Service Fast Stream stream for high potential graduates in government policy. Whilst on the Fast Stream, Amy led a climate and environment network that set up a climate and environment career anchor which is being rolled out across UK government.\n\nThe Fulbright in climate policy will give Amy skills and knowledge across adaptation and mitigation policy; she hopes to specialise in climate disaster preparedness at Columbia University. She applied to Fulbright to embed climate disaster preparedness in government policy and multilateralism. Amy hopes to work closely with Columbia's National Centre for Disaster Preparedness on climate vulnerable country disaster response. More recently, inspired by Laurie Laybourn, Amy was selected for the programme 'Cohort 2040' and has become interested in policy approaches to the polycrisis and derailment risk. Amy sees the climate crisis as a nexus - the most pressing threat implicating development, conflict, health, politics and migration.\n\nOutside of climate policy, Amy is passionate about equal opportunity - having gotten onto the Fast Stream with the help of UpReach. She launched a mentoring scheme for public servants from disadvantaged backgrounds with a friend, and is a mentor for the Access: Climate and Environment project. During her undergraduate degree, she was funded to conduct research in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel and published a paper with Columbia University. Having grown up in Cornwall, she loves connecting with nature through surfing and long distance running.\n\nEleanor Clark\n\nFulbright All Disciplines Postgraduate Award, MA in Humanities - University of Chicago\n\nEleanor Clark is in her final year studying English at Merton College, Oxford. After three years reading and performing literary analysis on everything from Old English poetry to twenty-first century advertising campaigns, she is excited to study for a Master's degree in the US, specialising particularly in modern women's writing and rural modernity studies. Her research considers how conflicts of gender and nation interact with investments in land and place, and how these conflicts operate differently between modern Britain and North America. As an undergraduate, Eleanor met (online) some wonderful American scholars in this field through the International Virginia Woolf Society, for whom she wrote a prizewinning essay, and the Stanford-Berkeley Graduate Conference, where she presented on hallucinations as visions of authorship in mid-20th century British women's novels. She looks forward to continuing conversations like these in person.\n\nAs a writer of fiction and literary journalism, and outgoing Editor-in-Chief of the Oxford Review of Books, Eleanor hopes to get involved with the US's great tradition of student writing. Having grown up in rural South West England, where she enjoys hiking and outdoor swimming, she is also keen to continue these activities in the dramatically different scale and variety of the US landscape.\n\nMattie Denison\n\nFulbright All Disciplines Postgraduate Award, Physics PhD - University of Pennsylvania\n\nOn the back of 4 years at Durham University, graduating this year with a MSc in Particles, Strings, and Cosmology; Mattie is looking forward to exploring the bigger and busier city of Philadelphia while studying for a PhD in Physics at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nMattie will be joining the Center for Particle Cosmology studying how the smallest things in the Universe affect the structure of the Universe as a whole. She is very grateful for the opportunity Fulbright has granted her to work with leading researchers in this relatively young field, as well as the adventures she hopes to have travelling the beautiful natural parks of the US.\n\nIn parallel with her studies, Mattie aims to show how small actions make a big difference in increasing participation of women in Physics. With this in mind she is keen to continue her outreach efforts and volunteer with the Access Science programme at Penn, working with local schools to encourage science engagement.\n\nBeyond the world of Physics, she is excited to see how the US lives up to the American literature she enjoys, and how easily her love of cricket and rugby will transfer to baseball and American football.\n\nRebs Fisher-Jackson\n\nFulbright-BAFTA Award, MFA Screenwriting - UCLA\n\nWorking in a Cornish pasty shop as a teenager, Rebs would spend her shifts dreaming about studying in the USA and creating stories for film and television. Growing up surrounded by American media, Rebs fell in love with the lives she saw on screen; her greatest wish as a child was to try candy corn at Halloween.\n\nRebs became the first person in her family to attend university. Whilst studying English Literature at Cardiff University, her late introduction to LGBTQ+ films pivoted Rebs towards a career creating positive representation on-screen. She knew from the moment she first stepped foot on a film set that she was home. Starting out as a locations trainee and in production, Rebs re-trained as a script supervisor with Screen Alliance Wales. She has since worked on more than 21 productions for the likes of Lucasfilm and the BBC, and on social film projects for the Iris Prize and International Youth Media Summit.\n\nAs a storyteller, Rebs is interested in telling stories about human connection and LGBTQ+ characters. She’s secured BFI Film Academy funding and made multiple award-winning shorts that have led her to obtain BAFTA Connect membership and achieve her first broadcast credit directing a short for BBC Wales. Rebs is thrilled to train at film school in the USA as a writer/director, a far cry away from the Cornish coastlines near where she grew up. She’s excited to make new friends on campus and learn about the industry from an American perspective. With mentoring from BAFTA and the new connections she’ll make, Rebs can’t wait to put her newfound knowledge towards diversifying the film and television industry.\n\nGidon Gautel\n\nFulbright All Disciplines Postgraduate Award, MS Electrical and Computer Engineering - Boston University\n\nGidon Gautel is a passionate member of the global space community.

He subsequently undertook an internship at the Index on Censorship, before beginning a role in government as a policy advisor at the Department for Education.\n\nNavigating the first stage of his career, he has maintained his passion for South Asian history. In particular, he has nurtured his interest in exploring the influence of the Partition of India upon South Asian diasporic communities, the subject of his undergraduate dissertation.\n\nThis continued passion has led to a Fulbright Award to study for an MA in South Asian Studies at the University of Washington, in which he will be able to build on his interests by researching the influence of Partition upon the development of the South Asian community in the United States.\n\nHe’s excited to learn more about one of the most fascinating diasporic groups in the world, alongside experiencing the unique nature of US college life the Pacific Northwest. A huge sports fan and supporter of the Kansas City Chiefs, he also looks forward to immersing himself in American sport, although he fears that exposure to cricket, his favourite sport, will be hard to come by!\n\nAimée Lister\n\nFulbright All Disciplines Postgraduate Award, MA in Arab Studies - Georgetown University\n\nAimée graduated with a BA in Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies from the University of Cambridge, UK in 2020. On graduating, she moved to Japan, completed a postgraduate law conversion remotely at the University of Law, and founded a copywriting business that supports global tech startups.\n\nHer experiences through her own business, living in 3 continents over the past 5 years, as well as roles at the Asia Society in Japan and Jamal Khashoggi’s DAWN MENA, made her appreciate the role that cultural dialogue plays within broader spaces of foreign policy and international relations. This fully crystallised whilst living in Lebanon and working on the media and editorial team at afikra, a global media and community organization dedicated to reframing dominant understandings of the Arab world by promoting the region’s cultures and histories.\n\nWith the support of the Fulbright scholarship, she is delighted to be pursuing an MA in Arab Studies at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. She is looking forward to building out an interdisciplinary course of study through which she will gain greater understandings of the Arab world, particularly through a cultural and societal lens. Beyond academics, Aimée is also excited by the prospect of exploring DC and involving herself in the city’s vibrant Asian-American community.\n\nAlaya Rathore Mathur\n\nFulbright Postgraduate Student Award, LLM at Indiana Maurer School of Law\n\nGraduating from the University of Nottingham with an undergraduate degree in Law & Chinese Law, Alaya understood the importance of cultural exchange whilst studying abroad at the University of Hong Kong. Falling in love with the city, she returned to Hong Kong in 2023 to work for a local education charity, where she gained a ground-level perspective of the importance of cross-cultural communication and community building through cultural barriers.\n\nLooking to gain a similar level of insight in the commercial and entrepreneurial spaces, Alaya has gained a place in Maurer’s unique Learning and Working LLM. Intending to build on her European and Asian legal experiences, Alaya hopes to learn from her placement with the Elmore Entrepreneurship Law Clinic at IU, where she can gain strong practical experience in high impact areas of law whilst working with early stage high-potential companies as they look for expansion opportunities.

He grew up sailing with his Grandpa and has been captivated by the wild and watery rogues of the High Seas ever since.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Oxford in 2022 with a degree in History & Politics, he pursued an atypical post-graduate route by deciding to spend 20 months back North working in a boatyard. Living in a rural fishing village with a population of just 9 others, he single-handedly renovated a former oil-rig lifeboat into a floating tiny home to an audience of millions online. He has since moved ‘Orla’ to London where he lives onboard and continues to make videos about life afloat.\n\nProfessionally, he hopes to one day combine this digital platform with his new position as a Fulbrighter to raise awareness of the vast swathes of maritime conflict oft overlooked in traditional journalism. From piracy and sea slavery to overfishing and environmental activism, Johnny hopes to use his time at Columbia Journalism School to improve his writing and be schooled in formal ethical and conflict-based procedures. As a student of the Documentary Specialization programme, he is also excited to gain further hands-on camera experience.\n\nElla Robinson\n\nFulbright-American University Award, MA in Journalism and Public Affairs: Investigative Journalism - American University\n\nElla will graduate with a BA in Social Sciences (Politics and Sociology) from the University of Manchester in 2024. During her placement year, Ella was Editor-in-Chief of The Mancunion, the biggest student newspaper in the UK, leading the team to win four national awards.\n\nElla’s award-winning journalism consistently focuses on amplifying the voices of those who are too often ignored by the mainstream media. Named ‘Best Journalist in the North’ and highly commended nationally for her collaborative investigative reporting with Manchester’s Disabled Students’ Society, she was subsequently invited to judge Amnesty Media’s Student Journalist of the Year Award. She looks forward to learning new investigative skills during her Masters at American University, and to putting them into practice through the Investigative Journalism Practicum.\n\nElla has consistently sought to make the journalism industry more accessible. At Manchester, she co-organised the largest ever Women in Media Conference, and launched The Mancunion’s mentor scheme, connecting current students with alumni. In 2023 she was elected as Training and Opportunities Officer for the Student Publication Association, supporting 200 student publications across the UK and Ireland. She hopes to bring this ethos of supportive knowledge sharing to her American University studies and to the Fulbrighters’ network.\n\nEleanor Tack\n\nFulbright All Disciplines Award, Masters of Law - Columbia University\n\nEleanor left school and moved to France to work in a Red Cross emergency housing centre where she supported asylum seekers and families in crisis. Inspired by the people she worked with, Eleanor went on to study International Relations at King's College London, with a focus on public international law. Upon graduation Eleanor returned to France to continue working with the Red Cross, this time in Paris but regularly deployed to informal migrant camps across the country. She worked in the Family Tracing department, reconnecting families who had lost contact with one another during conflict or migration. This experience cemented Eleanor's desire to use the law to create change and protect the vulnerable; she returned to the UK to complete her Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) with a view to becoming a barrister.\n\nAfter completing her GDL, Eleanor moved to Johannesburg to clerk at the Constitutional Court of South Africa under Justice Leona Theron, where she began to understand how differing constitutional structures effect the capacity of the law to protect vulnerable people such as migrants. This is the theme Eleanor hopes to explore through her Masters of Law programme in the USA, selecting modules which focus on comparative constitutional law and the rights of migrants with a view to combining these two discrete areas of practice in a way which will help lawyers better understand how to harness the law to protect vulnerable migrants. Outside of her work and studies, Eleanor is a Trustee at The Society of Mediators, training people across the world in mediation and also sits on the Board of Directors at Bridging the Bar, a charity she launched in 2020 with a group of barristers to diversify the profession.\n\nPragya Agarwal\n\nFulbright All Disciplines Scholar Award - CUNY Graduate Center\n\nProfessor Pragya Agarwal is a behavioural and data scientist, and founder of a research think-tank 'The 50 Percent Project'.

Well, besides the obvious improvement in the weather, Austin is where any researcher interested in the 1960s, and in Pacific-American relations, should be. The University of Texas at Austin hosts not only the archives of President Lyndon Johnson - the first sitting US President to visit Australia - but also one of the only dedicated centers for the study of Australia and New Zealand in North America.\n\nJohnson and Australia are at the heart of Ben Quail's project, which examines how interpersonal relations evolved between Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt. The two men made fast friends, formed an advantageous political relationship for both countries, and set the tone for future US-Australian relations from the 1960s to the trilateral AUKUS agreement of the 2020s. This research asks key questions: did Johnson’s friendship with Holt affect relations between Australia and America, or did diplomacy affect Johnson’s relationship with Holt? Which is more important in the development of policy between the two countries?\n\nThe work builds on Ben's previous research and teaching in the area. Having completed a master's degree researching US post-war foreign policy in Europe, Ben became interested in the relationship between President Johnson, Vietnam, and foreign policy. This research led to a PhD at the University of Strathclyde reviewing the administration's attempts to sell foreign and domestic policies to the American people which was adapted into a research monograph in 2019. Ben is excited to further this research by focusing on a key military ally in Australia, and to be able to spend time attending concerts in Austin, which, like Glasgow, is well-known for live music!\n\nAlan Rice\n\nFulbright All Disciplines Scholar Award - University of Michigan\n\nAlan Rice is Professor in English and American Studies at UCLan, Preston. He has been working on the interdisciplinary study of Transatlantic Black Cultures for forty years. For his Fulbright Fellowship, to be held at one of the oldest African American Studies programmes at the University of Michigan, Rice will undertake new research in military archives and present his long-running project on the Battle of Bamber Bridge (1943) where in a small Lancashire town the imposition of Jim Crow segregation led to pushback both from local residents and the Black GIs. The tensions culminated in oppression by the American military police and a violent stand-off that led to the death of one of the Black soldiers and expressions of solidarity against racism from many of the locals. My project will, for the first time, investigate the incident through the voices of the working class civilians and the perspective of the troops themselves rather than the partial testimonies from court martial records. Apart from University audiences, Rice will engage with Veterans and local community groups to disseminate knowledge about these little known European events which were a contributing factor to the development of the American Civil Rights Movement.\n\nGlyn Robbins\n\nFulbright-Rutgers Newark Scholar Award - Rutgers University\n\nGlyn Robbins has worked in, written about and campaigned on housing for over 30 years.
