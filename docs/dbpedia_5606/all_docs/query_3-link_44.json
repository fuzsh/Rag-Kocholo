        "text": "Howard Jones (born Aug. 23, 1885, Excello, Ohio, U.S.—died July 27, 1941, Toluca Lake, Calif.) was an American collegiate gridiron football coach who made his mark on both West and East Coast football.\n\nAlong with his brother T.A.D. Jones, Howard played football in Middletown, Ohio; at Phillips Exeter Academy (1903–04) in Exeter, N.H.; and at Yale University (1905–07). His early coaching experience came at Yale, Syracuse University in New York, and Ohio State University. In 1913 he became the first paid coach at Yale. During his coaching stay at the University of Iowa (1916–23), his team’s 10–7 victory over Notre Dame in 1921 drew national attention. After coaching at Duke University in 1925, Jones went to the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, where he remained until retirement after the 1940 season. There he developed 13 All-American players, and his teams won seven Pacific Coast Conference championships and two national championships and were undefeated in five Rose Bowl games. The success and fame of the football team were beneficial to USC president Rufus von KleinSmid as he expanded the university during the 1920s and ’30s."
