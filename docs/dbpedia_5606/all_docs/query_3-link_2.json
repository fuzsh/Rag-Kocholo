        "text": "HYANNIS — Many knew Howard Penn as co-owner of Puritan Clothing of Cape Cod.\n\nOthers knew him as a father, grandfather, uncle and brother, and yet some knew him as \"Howie Figawi\" — longtime spectator and committee member of the annual Figawi Race weekend, a sailing extravaganza now in its 41st year.\n\nPenn died Saturday after a long illness. He was 80.\n\nThe Penn family has owned Puritan Clothing since 1919, the year Howard's father, Abraham, founded the company. The Main Street Hyannis store opened in 1939 is still operated by the family.\n\nPenn served Puritan Clothing for 60 years, becoming deeply involved in Cape Cod life along the way.\n\n\"He loved people. He was all about loving people. He didn't care if you were the vice president or the janitor, he looked out for you. It was his mission in life,\" said Elizabeth Penn, Howard's wife of 21 years.\n\nElizabeth Penn said a friend of Howard's told her it was fitting that her husband lived on Lookout Lane.\n\n\"No doubt he's up with his friends — people that meant something to him — now, looking down on us. And that's what gives us peace.\"\n\nPenn was born in Plymouth and majored in retailing at New York University. After an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army — where he served during the Korean conflict — Penn joined the family business.\n\nPenn's son, Richard, in an interview on Saturday, highlighted his father's commitment to the Cape, which in turn was reciprocated by area residents.\n\n\"He was loved and respected by his family and the community,\" Richard Penn said. \"He was very civic-minded.\"\n\nPenn worked with a number of community groups, including Big Brothers and Big Sisters, the Osterville Boy Scouts, Hyannis March of Dimes, Figawi Race weekend and many others.\n\nA constant staple at Figawi races — despite never racing himself — Penn did much to make the race the event it is today. For his work he was named honorary chairman in 2006.\n\n\"It gives me tears,\" he said in a May 2006 Cape Cod Times article. \"It makes me feel good.\"\n\nPenn was such a familiar face at the Figawi races, he was honored during a charity ball in May of last year for his 40 years of involvement."
