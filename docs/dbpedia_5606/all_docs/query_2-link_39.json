        "text": "Penn Arts & Sciences: Making a Difference in Global Communities and Klein Family Social Justice Grants\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Arts & Sciences has awarded grants to fifteen projects through the Making a Difference in Global Communities and Klein Family Social Justice initiatives. Making a Difference in Global Communities, formerly known as Making a Difference in Diverse Communities, supports multidisciplinary projects led by Arts & Sciences faculty working with students to address global societal challenges, including inequities in race, gender, sexual identity, socioeconomic mobility, education, health care, and political representation, as well as climate change, poverty, and immigration.\n\nThe Klein grants, a new program, are a component of the school’s commitment to contributing to the achievement of social justice through research and teaching, and through community engagement rooted in the arts and sciences.\n\nThe awarded projects are led by faculty from across the humanities and social sciences, with contributions from scholars from the Graduate School of Education, the Weitzman School of Design, Penn Nursing, Penn Vet, and the Perelman School of Medicine. In addition, the granted projects involve partnerships with community organizations in locations from Philadelphia to the Galápagos Archipelago, South Africa, Cyprus, and others.\n\nThe 2021 Making a Difference in Global Communities projects are:\n\nPenn-in-Kenya II: Bringing the World’s Premiere Refugee Film School Online, led by Peter Decherney, professor of English and cinema & media studies. This project, expanding on previous work in Kenya, will partner Penn students with students at the FilmAid Kenya training program at the Kakuma Refugee Camp to design an open online course (a MOOC) that will allow refugees and other at-risk communities around the world access FilmAid’s successful curriculum.\n\nDiverse Global Communities and Local Resource Allocation, led by Hans-Peter Kohler, Frederick J. Warren Professor of Demography and co-director of the Population Aging Research Center. In the past few years, Malawi has seen a surge in the number of officially recognized villages and traditional authorities (local chiefs). This project explores how village size and village heterogeneity shape the provision of local public goods and seeks to understand the policies that drive village-splitting decisions and how fragmentations impact inequality and prosperity. Guy Grossman, professor of political science, is co-director of the project.\n\nReducing Inequalities in College Access in Latinx Communities in Philadelphia, led by Emilio Parrado, Dorothy Swaine Thomas Professor of Sociology. This project is a partnership between Penn’s Center for Latin American and Latinx Studies and the Center for Culture, Art, Training, and Education. The two-year project aims to enhance college access and success among Latinx communities in Philadelphia through a college readiness program, student mentoring, conversations between Penn faculty and high school students, and service learning and research opportunities that will bring Penn students into the community. Amalia Dache, associate professor in the higher education division of the Graduate School of Education, co-directs this project.\n\nSeeds of Understanding: Prejudice-Reduction via Inter-Cultural Contact, led by Nicholas Sambanis, Presidential Distinguished Professor of Political Science. The project explores whether anti-immigrant bias, prejudice, and hostility can be mitigated via social contact in a learning environment designed to promote inter-cultural understanding. In collaboration with the University of Cyprus and Caritas, an international NGO providing humanitarian assistance to migrants and refugees, researchers will measure the effects of intergroup contact between natives and refugees/immigrants from different ethno-racial groups in the context of an after-school program targeting school-age children.\n\nSighting Black Girlhood, led by Deborah Thomas, R. Jean Brownlee Term Professor of Anthropology and director of the Center for Experimental Ethnography. The project builds on an existing exhibit and portrait campaign called “The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face,” designed to see Black girlhood as a sacred experience. It will involve a team-taught course, collaborations with partners in Philadelphia, Jamaica, and South Africa, and a traveling exhibit that will generate research on interventions in the lives of Black girls in those area. Grace Sanders Johnson, assistant professor of Africana studies, and Krystal Strong, an assistant professor in the literacy, culture, and international education division of the Graduate School of Education, co-direct the project.\n\nLAVA: Laboratorio para apreciar la vida y el ambiente, led by Michael Weisberg, professor and chair of philosophy. Penn researchers have established partnerships in the Galápagos Archipelago through community science initiatives that pair communities and technical experts to co-conceive, plan, execute, analyze, and disseminate scientific research. The grant allows the LAVA team to continue and expand their work, with projects including research on and public engagement with marine life and the health of the aquatic ecosystem, climate change resilience, and a public health survey. Faculty co-directors include Erol Akçay, associate professor of biology; Karen M’Closkey, associate professor of landscape architecture in the Weitzman School of Design; Keith VanDerSys, senior lecturer in landscape architecture in the Weitzman School of Design; Jennifer Pinto Martin, Viola MacInnes/Independence Professor of Nursing in Nursing; Carl McLaughlin, assistant professor of clinical medicine in the Perelman School of Medicine; and Daniel Beiting, assistant professor in the School of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nMy Philadelphia Climate Story, led by Bethany Wiggin, associate professor of Germanic languages and literatures and founding director of the Penn Program in Environmental Humanities. This project recognizes the urgent need to integrate climate literacy into all levels of education and training. Leaders will develop a network of ten regional climate classrooms linked to one another and to Penn faculty and students to create a diverse collection of student-researched, developed, and authored climate stories. Their genres range from personal micro-essays to field notes, to long-form oral histories, essays, and video documentaries, and they will culminate in a storytelling festival and book which shares the project’s title.\n\nThe 2021 Klein Family Social Justice Grant awardees are:\n\nDiversity and Equity Initiative (DivE In) for the Mind Sciences, led by Angela Duckworth, Rosa Lee and Egbert Chang Professor in the department of psychology. This project addresses the underrepresentation of students of color, first-generation students, low-income students, and students from the LGBTQ+ community in the mind sciences generally and at the graduate level at Penn. Through one-on-one workshops and mentorships and a comprehensive online program, DivE In aims to remove systemic barriers to higher education.\n\nCommunity Assessment of Race-Related Experience of Stress for Black Mothers, led by Morgan Hoke, assistant professor of anthropology. Philadelphia exhibits significant racial disparities when it comes to maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. This interdisciplinary project seeks to document the experiences of race-related stress among Black pregnant women in the greater Philadelphia area. Working in collaboration with community organizations and health partners, the project documents women’s experience of stress and the sources of stress relief alongside information on birth outcomes, thereby generating information for policy makers and care providers while also providing resources to study participants and their communities. Jennifer Warren of George Mason University co-directs the project.\n\nBelonging, Daily Emotions, and Academic Performance in First-Generation Students, led by Sara Jaffee, professor of psychology. This project will test how first-generation, low income (FGLI) students’ sense of belonging in college impacts their day-to-day emotional experiences and grades. As the number of FGLI students at Penn increases, it is important to know how these factors intersect and where greater efforts can be made to increase a sense of belonging for all students. Camille Zubrinsky Charles, Walter H. and Leonore C. Annenberg Professor in the Social Sciences, and Laura Perna, Vice Provost for Faculty and GSE Centennial Presidential Professor of Education, co-direct the project.\n\nWest Philadelphia Community Archaeology Project, led by Megan Kassabaum, associate professor of anthropology. In collaboration with People’s Emergency Center, a homeless services provider, this project focuses on community archaeology in Philadelphia’s Mantua, West Powelton, Saunders Park, Belmont, and Mill Creek neighborhoods. Despite gentrification and other changes, material traces of the rich history of these areas persist. The power of community archaeology lies in the ability to use these material traces as entry points into discussions about gentrification, systemic racism, and socioeconomic change and to recover a heritage that may seem lost. Douglas K. Smit, a senior fellow in the department of anthropology, is project co-director.\n\nPrison Teaching Initiative Collaboration, led by Mona Merling, assistant professor of mathematics. Under the scope of this project, mathematics faculty and graduate students contribute directly to prison education by teaching accredited college-level mathematics classes at the South Woods State Prison in New Jersey, through the Prison Teaching Initiative (PTI) program housed at Princeton University. In addition to providing instruction to incarcerated students, PTI’s innovative, evidence-based practices offer faculty and graduate students an occasion to improve and expand their teaching.\n\nWords and Beats: Music Technology and Social Emotional Healing in Philly Schools, led by Carol Muller, professor of music. This project collaborates with West Philadelphia High School (WPHS) and the Netter Center for Community Partnerships to create a therapeutically informed, sustainable music technology program at WPHS that can be replicated elsewhere in the city and other urban schools fighting poverty and daily trauma. It strives to work against racial inequality by equipping the school’s music technology studio with additional resources to enable students to produce their own words and music as they gain music technology knowledge, skills, and certification and gives students the space to create stories in a style of their own, supported by family and community.\n\nEmpowering Community Voices and Visions, led by Karen Redrobe, Elliot and Roslyn Jaffe Endowed Professor in Film Studies. This project, a collaboration with Philadelphia’s Scribe Video Center and Penn’s Center for Teaching and Learning, is rooted in the belief that community-based learning spaces are sources of knowledge and experience, and that research universities can empower those spaces through the sharing of resources. The grant will support community-based media projects and the development of anti-racist teaching practices related to socially transformative media projects, and will also train Penn students as community facilitators.\n\nPhilosophy in Prisons and Jails, led by Daniel Wodak, assistant professor of philosophy. This project will help to develop a long-term prison and jail education initiative, including teaching philosophy to adult and juvenile inmates in the Philadelphia region. The goal is to offer academically rigorous education, including credit-bearing courses, and ultimately, a degree-granting program for non-traditional populations. Jennifer Morton, Presidential Penn Compact Associate Professor of Philosophy, and Sigal Ben-Porath of the Graduate School of Education are project co-directors.\n\nConvocation 2021\n\nOn Monday, August 30, 2021, Penn’s Class of 2025 Convocation was held in person in Blanche Levy Park, in front of College Hall.\n\nThink Like a Diplomat\n\nPresident Amy Gutmann\n\nHello Class of 2025!\n\nThere has never been a Convocation quite like this. We’re back!\n\nFor this momentous occasion, we get to zone out from Zoom. We are reunited. And it sure feels good!\n\nYou are the most diverse, talented, and resilient class ever. Let’s hear it for the great Class of 2025!\n\nMore than any class before, you had to become expert navigators. You were given no road map for this pandemic. Lacking any how-to guide, you not only finished high school remotely. You did so with flying colors. You made it to your new University despite the most daunting odds.\n\nNow the first and foremost test you face, while challenging, is also exhilarating. How do I navigate Penn?\n\nI faced the same thing when I arrived more than seventeen years ago as a newbie President. To this day, I still find navigating Penn an uplifting challenge (which may help explain why I still haven’t graduated!).\n\nSo: How to do it well?\n\nImagine for a moment that you are invited to attend a global summit. Nothing less than the future of our world is at stake.\n\nIt’s an impressive crowd, impressive in its talent and diversity. You join representatives from nearly 100 countries; all 50 U.S. states; Washington, D.C.; Guam; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nMany are the first in their families to attend such a summit. Many identify as a Black, Asian, Latinx, LGBTQ, or having a disability. Many come from backgrounds in which the social and economic cards were stacked against them.\n\nThough each person has their unique differences, all were chosen for their academic accomplishments, creativity, talent, and drive to do good.\n\nTake this to heart: You are absolutely integral to the global summit that is seated all around you. And you now embark on an exciting journey to make the most of it.\n\nYou will make life-changing friendships; you will find a personally meaningful career; you will improve the lives of others, including your family, community, country, and the world: And you have no road map.\n\nWhat you do have are all the makings of a leader. The most successful combine being both collaborative and independent-minded. Here is what I have found to be the best navigational advice for success. It is deeply rooted in Penn history: Think like a diplomat.\n\nNot long after Penn was founded, back in the 1700s, the American colonies were in trouble. Their war for independence from Britain was not going well. They needed friends. So they sent the greatest mind of the age across the Atlantic to forge an alliance with France. He’s actually sitting among us now: Benjamin Franklin. Not only did he found our University. He was also America’s very first ambassador.\n\nIn France, Ben became a pop culture phenomenon. If Instagram had existed, he would’ve been the CEO of going viral. He charmed the royal court with his signature spectacles, simple clothes, and homemade gifts. He dazzled philosophers and merchants alike with his intellect and wit.\n\nHis printing press in Paris became synonymous with the transformational ideals of liberty and self-government. The French even named a hair style in Ben’s honor and it was all the rage.\n\nWhat was key to Franklin’s genius? From differences, Franklin found strength. From competing interests, he forged consensus. In pursuit of aid for his homeland, he lent aid to others. A diplomat par excellence, Ben won the friendship of France and so changed the future for countless people.\n\nWhat, you may ask, has Franklin’s life to do with my success at Penn? My answer is: Everything!\n\nYou can make the most of your new home by thinking like a modern-day diplomat. An excellent start is by celebrating differences, for they are among your signature strengths.\n\nNot very long ago, another amazing Penn alum, Anea Moore, was able to accept Penn’s offer of admission thanks to our financial aid program. She was born and raised in West Philadelphia and was, like me, the very first in her family to attend college.\n\nA student leader, Anea put her experiences as a Black woman and her extraordinary talents to work across campus and beyond. She helped us implement a new initiative to empower our first-generation and low-income FGLI students. From that grew our Penn First Plus program. And in 2019, Anea was named a Rhodes Scholar.\n\nSuccessful diplomats are both collaborative and independent-minded leaders. To succeed, you will work with and lean on diverse others.\n\nBut never forget this: What each of you brings here is uniquely yours. Share it bravely and be curious about the unique differences of others.\n\nThose differences and your own unique perspective make our community increasingly innovative, and ever more inclusive. At Penn, thinking creatively and being curious about others, that’s what leads to breakthroughs.\n\nMy latest case in point is a lifesaving one: On an ordinary day, much like any other, two Penn scientists—a woman and a man—crossed paths for the first time at a copying machine.\n\nThey chatted briefly about their research interests. By doing so, they discovered something neither had remotely expected. Their projects were quite different, but they found an intersecting interest.\n\nThey decided to team up, thinking each might hold a key to the other’s future. That day, unbeknownst to anyone for years to come, history was made.\n\nThe two people were Penn Medicine’s Drew Weissman and Kati Karikó. By deciding to collaborate, they together pioneered messenger RNA technology.\n\nIt was their breakthroughs that have made the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines against COVID possible. And these vaccines are what have made it possible for all of us to gather here today. We are teaching and learning in person, thanks to their combined collaborative and independent-minded character.\n\nAmong the many life-changing lessons to be learned from the examples of Drew and Katie, Ben and Anea are these: Always be open to that chance meeting on Locust Walk, in your College House, or with a faculty member. Though you may be strangers, though you are independently working toward different goals, your collaboration could one day change the world.\n\nAt Penn, we succeed by lending a hand.\n\nCountless opportunities await you: Penn Leads the Vote, the Netter Center for Community Partnerships, Fox Leadership, the President’s Engagement and Innovation Prizes, SNF Paideia Fellowships, Social Equity and Community Internships, Young Quakers Community Athletics, and many others.\n\nAs Wharton professor Adam Grant has shown, your success only stands to grow from lifting others up. Along the way, never ever hesitate to ask for help whenever you need it. None of us succeeds alone. Not even remotely.\n\nBy now, some of you have heard the news about me. I have been nominated by President Biden to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Germany.\n\nAs I share my thoughts with you today, I vividly remember what it felt like to be a first-year college student, as anxious as I was excited. And now I am both excited and anxious about my future and the future of my family.\n\nMy father, a refugee from Nazi Germany, died suddenly when I was a few years younger than you. I was a rising high school senior. My mom and I struggled mightily to make ends meet. Financial aid made it possible for me to go to college. I had imposter syndrome before there was a name for it. And even now, as we together face an uncertain future, I am feeling a lot of what you’re feeling, too.\n\nThe advice I give to you is the very same advice I continue to take to the best of my ability.\n\nThe power of Franklin’s example. Making the most of our connections to one another, our community, and the wider world. The ongoing urgency of addressing this global pandemic. Doing as much good as we creatively can as soon as we can in partnerships with others.\n\nThe transformative people I’ve known and the enduring lessons I’ve learned at Penn are very much front and center for me as they will be for you.\n\nSo I can say to you with the greatest compassion and conviction: By being both creative and collaborative, you will make the most of your new home here at Penn.\n\nAnd you will also make Penn an even more inclusive and innovative, friendly and all-around better home for yourself and everyone around you.\n\nI am so very thrilled to say officially and in person to the great Class of 2025: Welcome to your new home! Welcome to Penn!\n\nLessons From a Pandemic Year\n\nInterim Provost Beth Winkelstein\n\nAs Interim Provost—Penn’s Chief Academic Officer—it is my great pleasure to welcome you this evening.\n\nConvocation—the first time you’re gathered together, as a class—is a Penn tradition that dates back to the early 1900s. And here I should mention that I attended my own Convocation, as a Penn undergraduate. Not in 1910, but a few years later. Why mention that year in particular? Just as Penn’s Class of 1914 couldn’t have imagined the influenza pandemic waiting around the corner, when you entered high school you had no idea of the disruption to come. And yet: here you are! Penn’s Class of 2025, IRL [in real life]!\n\nThere are many lessons to take from our pandemic year. But I think there are two that are especially relevant to your Penn experience. Your path is not set. And we are all connected. Over the next four years, I urge you to embrace this uncertainty, and explore your interconnection.\n\nSometimes, external events—yes, even a pandemic—will set you off in some new direction. But just as often, change comes from within. You’ll find joy or inspiration in some field or interest that’s new to you. And I’m not speaking solely of academics. Penn has countless opportunities to meet new people and try different things: student organizations, affinity groups, athletics, food, the arts. You’re here to become not just well-educated but well-rounded. It’s a path that goes in all directions.\n\nAnd when you do decide on an academic track or major, know that this path, too, is not fixed. Your course—your courses—will change. Your major might change. When I entered Penn, I was sure I was going to be a doctor. But a summer in a research lab after my sophomore year changed my direction, and I became a bio-engineer.\n\nNew directions can be challenging. Like some of you, I had taken AP courses, so I skipped my first-year math class and went to the 200 level. I got this, I thought. No, I didn’t have it. It was impossible to juggle everything! At least for me. So I dropped a level, and was better for it. Think about your courses and your choices, but try not to stress about them. Let me say that again: please try not to stress. Taking chances—altering course—inevitably brings setbacks. But it may also bring big rewards.\n\nYour classmates and friends, your professors—everyone sitting up here tonight and the thousands of Penn staffers not here—want you to succeed. Which brings me to that second pandemic lesson. Regardless of our differences, in this world we’re all connected. We share a future. Just as you may need help from others, they may need your help. In these challenging times, remember no one succeeds alone. Here, at the nation’s first university, all our schools are on one campus. Penn’s interdisciplinary education is purpose-built for collaboration. Explore these connections, even—especially—when the path seems unclear.\n\nEvery class that’s sat where you’re sitting has worked very hard, and overcome major obstacles, to get here. But, honestly, members of the Class of 2025, you have some serious bragging rights. After a year of screen time, I’m just thrilled we finally have some face time.\n\nWelcome to Penn."
