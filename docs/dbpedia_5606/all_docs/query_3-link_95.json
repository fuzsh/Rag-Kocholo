Howard is .3 square miles.\n\nHoward is well-known because of its proximity to Bald Eagle State Park and Sayers Dam, but it is also a friendly community with rich history. It was settled in 1784, founded in 1810, and incorporated as a borough in 1864. It was named in honor of the British philanthropist, John Howard.\n\nAt the last census there were just under 700 residents. The racial makeup of the borough was 99.71% White and 0.29% Native American.\n\nThe town of Howard offers a relaxed atmosphere and small-town living with close proximity to many recreational areas."
