        "text": "Kyron McMaster was honoured with the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by His Majesty The King, recognising his outstanding contributions to sports in the British Virgin Islands.\n\n26-year-old McMaster, the 31st BVI recipient of the OBE, is now the youngest Virgin Islander to receive this prestigious title, following in the footsteps of the first awardee, Sir Olva Georges, in 1960.\n\nThe list of distinguished individuals who have received the OBE over the years reflects a legacy of outstanding service to the British Virgin Islands, with Kyron McMaster’s name now etched among the esteemed recipients.\n\nAt the age of 21, McMaster secured the British Virgin Islands’ inaugural Commonwealth Games gold in the 400m hurdles at the 2018 Games in Gold Coast, Australia. This triumph came amidst the aftermath of the devastating 2017 hurricane, which claimed the life of McMaster’s coach and mentor, Coach Xavier “Dag” Samuels.\n\nUndeterred by adversity, McMaster has achieved remarkable milestones in his athletic career, claiming victory in the Diamond League, securing gold at the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, and earning a silver at the 2023 World Track and Field Championships in Budapest—the first-ever medal for the British Virgin Islands at this prestigious event. McMaster also made history as a finalist, securing fourth place at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, clocking a National Record time of 47.08.\n\nBeyond his athletic achievements, McMaster dedicates himself to community service, actively supporting and inspiring young individuals in his homeland and championing grassroots sports initiatives.\n\nExpressing his gratitude for the prestigious honour, McMaster stated, “To represent the BVI has always been my dream, and this award illustrates the gratitude of my country and the wider UK family that, as an individual, no matter how small the territory, we can make a significant contribution and be recognised for such.”\n\nHis Excellency Governor John Rankin CMG applauded McMaster’s recognition, stating, “Kyron has placed BVI on the sporting map across the world and given cause for national celebration even in some of the most challenging times in the aftermath of the 2017 hurricane. Off the track, Kyron continues to inspire, using his own experience to motivate young students and athletes. I offer my warmest congratulations to Kyron.”\n\nList of OBE Recipients Over the Years:\n\nMr. Kyron McMaster – 2023\n\nMs Lynette Harrigan – 2022\n\nMr. Peter Haycraft – 2020\n\nMrs. Rosalie Adams – 2018\n\nMrs. Eileene Parsons – 2013\n\nMrs. Lorna Ginerva Smith – 2011\n\nMr. Reynold Stanley O’Neal – 2005\n\nMrs. Edris O’Neal – 2003\n\nDr. Robin Erskine Tattersall – 2001\n\nMrs. Eugenie Etheline Todman-Smith – 2000\n\nMiss Dancia Penn – 2000\n\nDr. Daniel Orlando Smith, MBE – 2000\n\nRev. Julian Clarke – 1999\n\nMrs. Ruth Evans – 1999\n\nDr. Charles Hugo Wheatley – 1996\n\nMr. Audley Maduro – 1993\n\nMr. Marvie Elton Georges – 1989\n\nMr. Clarence M Christian – 1983\n\nDr. Q W Osborne – 1980\n\nMr. Percy Chubb (Hon) – 1978\n\nMr. J A Frost – 1977\n\nMr. Kenneth Bain – 1976\n\nMr. Ivan Dawson – 1976\n\nMr. Ralph T O’Neal – 1975\n\nMr. Howard R. Penn – 1974\n\nMr. I G Fonseca – 1973\n\nMr. Carlton DeCastro – 1972\n\nMr. McWellington Todman – 1970\n\nMr. Henry O Creque – 1968\n\nMr. Jospeh Reynold O’Neal – 1967\n\nSir Olva Georges – 1960\n\nThea LaFond made history for her Caribbean island nation of Dominica by winning gold in the triple jump on Saturday, claiming the country’s first-ever Olympic medal. LaFond’s outstanding performance was highlighted by her second attempt of 15.02 meters, a world best for the year, which proved unbeatable despite the challenging rainy conditions at the Stade de France.\n\nJamaica’s Shanieka Ricketts took silver with a season-best jump of 14.87 meters, while American Jasmine Moore claimed bronze with a leap of 14.67 meters.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters ahead of the final, LaFond, 30, revealed that the entire nation was holding its breath, hoping she would secure a medal. Delivering on those hopes and more, LaFond celebrated exuberantly, draped in the Dominican flag, after her historic victory.\n\nLaFond’s win marked a memorable night for the Caribbean, as Saint Lucia also celebrated its first-ever Olympic medal when Julien Alfred stormed to gold in the 100 meters, ahead of American Sha’Carri Richardson.\n\nThe triple jump competition was notably unpredictable due to the absence of Venezuela’s Yulimar Rojas, the world record holder and Tokyo gold medalist, who missed the Games due to an Achilles tendon injury.\n\nRicketts, who narrowly missed the podium at the Tokyo Olympics, achieved her season’s best to secure the silver medal. Moore, 23, made history as the first woman to make the U.S. Olympic team in both triple jump and long jump, and she is set to compete in the latter event on Tuesday.\n\nSpain’s Ana Peleteiro-Compaore, the bronze medallist in Tokyo, finished sixth with a jump of 14.59 meters, visibly upset with her performance. Cuba’s world number one Leyanis Perez Hernandez came fifth with a jump of 14.62 meters."
