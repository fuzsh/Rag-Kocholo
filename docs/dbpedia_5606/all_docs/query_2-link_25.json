From there, you’ll locate and contact the Recruiting Operations Officer at the school you plan to attend. Most of them have served before and understand the process you’re going through.\n\nYour acceptance of the ROTC scholarship means a future service obligation of eight years in the Army, with requirements for active duty and/or the Army Reserve or Army National Guard depending on the scholarship. You may be eligible to serve part time in the Army Reserve or Army National Guard while pursuing a civilian career immediately after graduation.\n\nScholarship recipients who wish to exit the ROTC program may do so after their freshman year of college without any obligation.\n\nYou’ll have access to four-year, three-year, or two-year scholarships if you decide to join Army ROTC as a college student. Four-year scholarships are most common for students who are on a five-year college plan, while two-year scholarships are more common for those who attend certain participating two-year community colleges before transferring to a four-year university.\n\nTo get started on your ROTC scholarship application, locate and contact the Recruiting Operations Officer at your school to discuss how to apply.
