        "text": "Residents who follow the House of Assembly may have noted lawmakers’ recent chatter about a constitutional review and the territory’s path toward independence.\n\nThat is partly because nearly a decade has passed since the 2007 Constitution took effect, and some HOA members believe it is time to review the territory’s current constitutional model and devolve more powers from the United Kingdom to the local government.\n\n2007, however, is not the only significant constitutional anniversary this year: A half-century ago, in 1967, the territory took one of its most important steps towards self-governance.\n\nTomorrow marks 50 years since the VI populace elected leaders to the territory’s first ministerial government. Seven men, representing the VI’s first three distinct political parties, became the new system’s leaders.\n\nThe fledgling United Party won four seats and the majority, and H. Lavity Stoutt became the first chief minister.\n\n“I think ’67 is a page to remember,” said Conrad Maduro, one of two surviving candidates for the 1967 election, along with Bernard Penn. “It was a step forward for the territory.”\n\nMr. Maduro was the leader of the United Party in 1967 and ran as a candidate in what was then the Fifth District. He likely would have been the first chief minister instead of Mr. Stoutt if he hadn’t lost his district seat to Isaac G. Fonseca by a few dozen votes, though he was elected to the Legislative Council in later elections.\n\nThough the next five decades of territorial governments would gain more and more autonomy, the ongoing evolution of the ministerial system has not come without pitfalls.\n\n“It’s ‘my party, right or wrong,’” said Reggie Penn, whose father, Howard R. Penn, ran unsuccessfully as a United Party candidate in 1967. “In some respects we’ve lost some of the dissent, because it’s more focussed on allegiance to a political party. It’s more cutthroat.”\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1950, VI elected officials formed the territory’s first legislative council in nearly 50 years after Theodolph Faulkner, a fisherman from Anegada, helped spur protests for more autonomy the previous year. The four-person council was based on a new constitution drafted that year, according to an account posted on government’s website.\n\nHowever, the document was not intended to be an end-all system.\n\nDr. McWelling Todman, the first Virgin Islander to operate a law firm in the territory, described it as “an instrument minimal in its intent and its effect,” according to the website.\n\nVarious factors contributed to the enactment of a more expansive constitution in 1967.\n\nIn general, the 1960s were a period of significant decolonisation for Caribbean overseas territories, according to Dr. Peter Clegg, an associate professor in politics and international relations at the University of the West of England.\n\n“The UK linked very strongly to the European Community in the 1960s,” he said, noting that this new relationship led to a loosening of Great Britain’s ties with Commonwealth states around the world.\n\nIt was during this time that multiple Caribbean states that had been members of the disbanded West Indies Federation achieved a temporary status known as “associated statehood,” according to Doug Wheatley, a radio host and former financial secretary. These countries attained full internal self-government, but the UK handled their external affairs.\n\nAmong the countries that gained associated statehood in 1967 were Antigua and Barbuda, which became independent in 1981; St. Kitts, Nevis and Anguilla, which gained independence in 1983 (Anguilla broke off in 1980 and became a British Crown colony); Dominica, which became independent in 1978; St. Lucia, which became independent in 1979; and Grenada, which gained independence in 1974.\n\nDomestic affairs\n\nIn the VI, a UK constitutional commissioner named Mary Proudfoot arrived in 1965 to evaluate the territory’s government and make recommendations for the future.\n\nMs. Proudfoot made recommendations for an evolved government system in the territory, touching on everything from legislative titles to districting to philosophy. Though there was some local resistance, lawmakers on the Legislative Council adopted most of her suggestions, anthropologist Bill Maurer wrote in his 1997 book, Recharting the Caribbean: Land, Law and Citizenship in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nBoth Messrs. Wheatley and Maduro also mentioned that public interest in more autonomy was spurred by dissatisfaction with the Bates-Hill agreement that government signed in January 1967. In a move that was resisted for several years by Noel Lloyd and other members of the Positive Action Movement, British Administrator Martin Staveley agreed to lease Wickhams Cay and the majority of Anegada to Ken Bates, a British businessman, for 199 years.\n\nHowever, both Messrs. Wheatley and Maduro acknowledged that some of the populist anger towards the Crown in 1967 was based on a faulty premise: In addition to Mr. Staveley, the locally elected lawmakers — including Mr. Stoutt — also supported the Bates-Hill agreement initially, only to reverse their positions later to appease the people, they said.\n\nIllusion of power\n\nBoth Messrs. Wheatley and Maduro also stressed that while the 1967 advancement was a step in the right direction, there were — and remain — strong limits to locally elected power.\n\n“I still see a tremendous amount of power in the hands of the governor,” Mr. Wheatley said, citing the governor’s reserve powers to affect legislation and dip into the treasury, as Governor John Duncan announced he was doing last month to fund the Royal VI Police Force and other areas.\n\nMr. Maduro went so far as to question whether there is true democracy in the territory at all.\n\n“If you look at it really, in the true sense of authority, the authority is in the hands of the United Kingdom,” he said.\n\nStill, Mr. Wheatley did note that people were excited about the changes in 1967.\n\n“I guess the people felt that we were moving the right way because we now had a chief minister and all the other territories had their chief ministers,” Mr. Wheatley said, adding, “I think they felt good about that.”\n\nThe local media at the time reflected that excitement.\n\n“Those who have the right to vote and fail to do so have no cause for complaint when government is not what it ought to be,” The Island Sun editorialised on March 11, 1967. “The opportunity for good government is now in the hands of the people of the British Virgin Islands. Now is the time; it is up to you!”\n\nHowever, not everyone would be granted the right to vote. At a time when many Virgin Islanders sought work in the continental United States or USVI, those who had been naturalised or attained green cards and were living in the US could not vote in the 1967 elections, according to Eileene Parsons, who was living in St. Thomas at the time but would later become a legislator here.\n\nLooking forward\n\nFor Dr. Clegg, the VI’s 50th ministerial system anniversary is interestingly timed with UK’s vote to exit the European Union.\n\nEuropean Community ties that encouraged the UK’s decolonisation policies in the 1960s could be coming full circle 50 years later, according to the professor.\n\nIf the next two years of Brexit negotiations lead to a hard disconnect between the UK and the EU, Great Britain may seek to reemphasise its trade relationship with the Commonwealth countries and overseas territories, he said.\n\nGovernment has not scheduled any ceremonies or festivities to mark the anniversary, though the premier does plan to release a statement, according to Arliene Penn, government’s director of communications.\n\n{fcomment}"
