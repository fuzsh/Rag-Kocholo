        "text": "The Confirmation Polarization\n\nWhen Sheldon and Amyâs Super Asymmetry Theory is proven by two physicists from Chicago, theyâre thrilled â until they try to kick Amy off their Nobel Prize nomination! Meanwhile, Bernadette has a big success at work and Pennyâs going to be a part of itâ¦whether she wants to or not.\n\nThe Laureate Accumulation\n\nWhen competitors Pemberton and Campbell (guest stars SEAN ASTIN and KAL PENN) charm America on a publicity tour, Sheldon and Amy try to bring Nobel laureates KIP THORNE, GEORGE SMOOT and FRANCES ARNOLD to their side (this episode sets the record for most Nobel laureates appearing in a comedy). Meanwhile, Halleyâs fear of the dark leads to both opportunity and conflict for Howard, Bernadette and Stuart.\n\nThe Plagiarism Schism\n\nWhen Barry Kripke finds proof that Dr. Pemberton plagiarized his thesis in college, Sheldon and Amy arenât sure if they should turn him in or not. And Howard is happily surprised to learn that Bernadette wasnât the only waitress at The Cheesecake Factory who had a crush on him back in the day.\n\nHelmet\n\nDespite being happy with Sam, Jess confesses to Cece that she had a sex dream about Nick. And Schmidt attempts to help Winston land Furguson a cat audition when he finds out Alyâs star boyfriend is a talent agent for pets."
