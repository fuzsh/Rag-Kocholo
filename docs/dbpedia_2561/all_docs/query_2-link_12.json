        "text": "THE MEMORIAL TREE PROJECT CONTINUES\n\nThe northern end of Old Mission Peninsula on Center Road was once lined with magnificent old maple trees some over 100 years until age, salt and disease took them down. The Memorial Tree Project started in September 1999 under the direction of Rebecca and Leo Nothstine. It has continued since with over 650 trees planted and nourished.\n\nIf you would like to participate in this project please use this form and mail it with your contribution. Many are memorial trees dedicated to specific individuals.\n\nPhotos contributed by Brian Brooks\n\nTracking the Sleeping Bear​\n\n​\n\nTracking the Sleeping Bear is a lengthy essay that includes: 1) documented versions of the so-called “Legend of Sleeping Bear” from the 1890s until its heavy commercial popularization; 2) alternative legends relating to Sleeping Bear Dune and the Manitou Islands; 3) authentic Anishinaabe landscape origin stories from the vicinity of the upper Great Lakes; 4) historical accounts touching upon Sleeping Bear and the Manitous; 5) discussion of where the tracks lead. This is a difficult topic, because the popularity of the “Legend of Sleeping Bear” stems from its close resemblance to romantic “fakelore” (see also my essay on Fakelore and the Ethics of Children’s Literature) but the earliest documented versions, although not until the late nineteenth century, did come from within the Little Traverse Odawa community.\n\nLink to Pearl Hill's Grocery store story from Jane Boursaw:\n\nwww.oldmission.net/2019/06/pearl-hills-grocery/"
