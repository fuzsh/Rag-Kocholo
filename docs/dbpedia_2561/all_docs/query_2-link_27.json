        "text": "Five members from the AWSRG have recently been field recording in the mountain forests of the Huon Peninsular in Papua New Guinea.\n\nWith three previous years recording in the region, Tony Baylis organised and lead this year’s expedition, comprising Sue Gould and her partner Rod Thorn (who both accompanied Tony last year), plus David Stewart and myself, Andrew Skeoch.\n\nDavid, Rod and I returned after four weeks in the mountains. Sue and Tony are (as of writing) still on the trail, undertaking an extended walk for an extra fortnight down to the north coast. This will take them through a range of altitudes, allowing them to experience different habitats and species not found at higher elevations.\n\nOur expedition will likely have a diversity of outputs. Some sounds and further stories will likely be posted here. In due course, I’ll be creating long-form soundscape recordings which will be published on our website for free listening. Tony has produced a sound guide to the vocalisations of bird species in the Huon, and copies of that have been distributed to our guides and their villages to assist them with future visitors. No doubt that guide will undergo some updating as a result of our recent efforts. We’ve all been invited to participate in a symposium panel in December (more on that shortly). And there has been thought about a scientific paper or two as well."
