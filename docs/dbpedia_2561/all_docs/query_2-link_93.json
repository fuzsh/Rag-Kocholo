        "text": "By Pepper Fisher\n\nCARLSBORG â The July 10 announcement that the Olympic Peninsula Humane Society (OPHS) would be closing the doors of its Bark House dog shelter on August 30 has caused a ripple effect throughout the community. Employees have lost their jobs, or soon will. Clallam County and the cities of Sequim and Port Angeles no longer have a place to take impounded or stray dogs, Executive Director Jason Stipp has resigned, and donors are left with questions about how the organization came to be under what Stipp described on his way out as âoverwhelming financial strainâ, losing $40,000 a month.\n\nThe running of the organization is now left to the Board of Directors, headed by President Marti Oldham, who spoke with KONP on August 5. Oldham and the Board are still assuring the public that the August 30 closing date for the Bark House is only a target. She said they will remain open as long as it takes to place the last dog.\n\nhttps://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/958/2024/08/06151543/080624-oldham-1.wav\n\n“We currently have 10 dogs left who are in need of a loving home. Each of these dogs have specific needs, and it’s crucial that we match them with the right individuals to ensure their successful placement. These need range from medical requirements to preferences such as no children or other pets. Once we get the last of them placed, then we will go ahead and shut down the Bark House temporarily while we reassess and rebuild.”\n\nBefore his departure, Stipp told the public that the plan was to sell the Bark House property and use the funds to expand the Kitty City property in Carlsborg into a single facility for cats and dogs. That position has now changed.\n\nhttps://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/958/2024/08/06151607/080624-oldham-2.wav\n\n“Well, after careful consideration we decided to retain ownership of the Bark House property and resume operations at a later date. We don’t have exact details at this moment because our plan has been in flux from the beginning. Everything has happened so quickly, and we want to make sure that we make the right decisions and do this the best way possible, the most cost-effective, and get back into the business of saving dogs as soon as possible. And people can check out our website for updates on a regular basis.”\n\nAfter making the decision to close The Bark House, the board and staff cancelled their contracts with the County and the Cities of Sequim and Port Angeles.\n\nhttps://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/958/2024/08/06151630/080624-oldham-3.wav\n\n“We have been keeping them up to date on our situation, and we are also actively participating in the Animal Solutions Advisory Committee that the County Commissioners have put together. In the meantime, we are trying to help the city of Port Angeles, City of Sequim, the county, to help accommodate them however we can. We haven’t found any concrete solutions at this point, but we’re committed to help out however we can.”\n\nWith that in mind, Clallam County officials announced Tuesday they are seeking volunteers for the new Animal Solutions Advisory Committee to help sort out some solutions to the current dog dilemma. Interested parties are invited to contact the Clallam County Commissionersâ Office at (360) 417-2233 or rachel.weed@clallamcountywa.gov, visit the office in the Clallam County Courthouse, or obtain the application online at: clallamcountywa.gov. Applications must be received by close of business Monday, August 26.\n\nIn the meantime, there are still 10 dogs at the Bark House looking for their forever homes.\n\nhttps://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/958/2024/08/06151646/080624-oldham-4.wav\n\n“We’re going to be hosting adoption events on August 10 and 17 from noon to 3 p.m. at the Bark House to showcase these wonderful dogs that we have left. And we will offer reduced adoption seeds and enhanced starter packs to help these dogs transition smoothly into their new homes. We humbly ask that the community rally around us and support our ongoing efforts to find loving homes for these animals and to get back into the business of saving dogs as soon as possible.”\n\n(Pictured: Olaf is currently available for adoption)"
