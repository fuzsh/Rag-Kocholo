Introduction and Procedure\n\nCommissioner Reginald E. Jones was appointed by Chairman Gilbert F. Casellas to head the Task Force to study \"best\" equal employment opportunity policies, programs, and practices of private sector employers. While the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (Commission or EEOC) is the enforcement agency responsible for compliance with its statutory mandates, the Commission has an important role in facilitating voluntary compliance through education, training, outreach, and policy guidance. Indeed, the primary goal of the Task Force is to facilitate voluntary compliance in its examination of business policies, programs, and practices that will be useful to employers in structuring systems and policies that are consistent with their business priorities as well as with their equal employment opportunity (EEO) obligations and diversity objectives. The Task Force also has presented employers with the opportunity to showcase those policies, programs, and practices of which they are particularly proud.\n\nAccordingly, the Task Force set out to look at noteworthy business practices by which employers are complying with their EEO obligations and diversity objectives, especially practices thought of as creative or innovative. The Task Force also set out to catalogue its findings in such a way that they will be useful to employers, especially smaller and medium-sized employers that are less likely to employ professional personnel and legal staffs. Additionally, ideas were solicited about how the Commission could better assist entities in developing best policies, programs, and practices. The Task Force thus examined what statutory, regulatory, policy or operational changes by the Commission may better facilitate the development of best policies, programs, and practices.\n\nThe Task Force divided its study of policies, programs, and practices into six major groupings: (1) recruitment and hiring; (2) promotion and career advancement; (3) terms and conditions; (4) termination and downsizing; (5) alternative dispute resolution; and (6) other. The focus of \"recruitment and hiring\" is on affirmative recruitment programs designed to create a diverse workforce, such as internships, recruitment strategies, and education and training programs used for hiring. The focus of \"promotion and career advancement\" is on programs that have eliminated barriers to the advancement of women, people from diverse ethnic and racial groups, persons with disabilities, and older workers (those forty or older). Such programs as mentoring, education and training for purposes of promotion, and career enhancement initiatives were considered in this group. The focus of \"terms and conditions\" is on disability and religious accommodation programs, and on sexual harassment, pay equity, insurance, employee benefits, and work-life and family-friendly policies and practices. The focus of the section on \"termination and downsizing\" is on such areas as retraining and placement programs for employees displaced by downsizing programs, nondiscriminatory early retirement programs, and insurance. \"Alternative dispute resolution\" focuses on early resolution of employment discrimination complaints and voluntary and effective alternative dispute resolution programs. The \"other\" category embraces any other policies, programs, or practices not readily identifiable in the previous five groups or where there was an overlap between or among groups.\n\nSince management commitment and accountability are driving forces behind a company's EEO policies, programs, and practices, it was decided to devote a part of the discussion in the report to this factor as well, thus creating a seventh grouping of \"management commitment and accountability.\" In terms of commitment, the Task Force looked at what management was saying and doing. In terms of accountability, the Task Force looked at tools such as performance appraisals, compensation incentives, and other evaluation measures to reflect a manager's ability to set high standards and demonstrate progress.\n\nThe Task Force also decided to discuss a group of companies that have EEO programs that are particularly noteworthy from a comprehensive perspective. These companies addressed most, if not all, of the elements delineated above and deserve comprehensive recognition for their programs. The Task Force, in addition, recognized various partnerships, involving companies and the facilitation of employment opportunities with other organizations and/or individuals.\n\nThe Task Force developed criteria setting forth what a \"best practice\" is and does, which will be discussed, infra. The best practices selected were generally viewed in terms of those criteria. The Task Force also focused on those submissions that were more detailed in terms of the description of the practice and how it worked, and that persuasively explained why the practice was of a noteworthy nature. Furthermore, the Task Force favored those practices that were presented with supporting data as to their effectiveness.\n\nFrom the outset, submitting employers recognized that the information the Task Force was seeking went beyond simple compliance with the EEO laws enforced by the EEOC. When they received the Task Force request to hear about \"Best Practices,\" they knew that this meant more than just complying with the minimum requirements of the law. No, this term inherently focuses on what a company is doing at the level of compliance and beyond.\n\nB. Limitations\n\nUnfortunately, time and financial resources limited the scope of the group's work. The Task Force, as a whole, did not have the luxury of conducting site visits or validation studies of the submissions. Essentially, work was begun with an exhaustive review of the \"best practices\" literature. Thereafter, paper examinations were conducted relying on stakeholders' submissions at face value, although follow-up was done, where it was available and felt to be helpful. In sum, the Task Force essentially considered whether the practice complied with the law, whether it would likely promote effective equal employment opportunity strategies, considering the barrier or barriers it was designed to address, and its fairness. Of course, the additional element of demonstrable results was considered where available.\n\nThe recognition of best practices in this report is a qualified one. The Task Force believes, however, that if appropriately implemented, considering the factual circumstances surrounding the implementation, the cited practices will be reasonably likely to promote equal employment opportunity. Indeed, the Task Force takes as a given that in each instance the submitter believes the practice has been highly successful in the promotion of equal employment opportunity and/or diversity, and, thus, is deserving of recognition.\n\nThe Task Force wishes to stress that a best practice may not be universally replicable on a successful basis regardless of employer or industry. We think, however, that the recognition of the practices in this report can provide some of our stakeholders valuable ideas on what has worked for other stakeholders. Such practices may very well be the basis for replication, although individual tailoring to the requirements of the individual worksite may be necessary.\n\nMoreover, the Task Force notes that citing an employer for a best practice does not mean that employer is necessarily a model equal employment opportunity employer generally. A cited practice involves only a specific area of equal employment opportunity. This is because it is possible, for example, that an employer may have an excellent sexual harassment program and policy, yet that same employer may not have an effective policy on the employment of people with disabilities. A model employer must necessarily do many things, involving a multitude of areas, in a commendable manner. We emphasize, however, that even those employers generally cited for recognition may not be immune from criticism, given the parameters and limitations of the Task Force's study.\n\nIn sum, since time and resource constraints made it impossible to validate the accuracy of the submissions, or to assess how they are being implemented, it is important to emphasize that the Commission is not endorsing any particular policy, program, or practice. Rather, the Commission's goal is to identify and disseminate information about practices currently being implemented by employers which are likely to promote voluntary compliance with the laws enforced by EEOC.\n\nC. What is a \"best\" practice?\n\nThe report begins by identifying what the Task Force considers to be relevant in determining what a \"best\" practice involves. This was not an easy task. The Task Force recognizes that reasonable persons may differ on the question. Nevertheless, the Task Force concluded that most stakeholders should be able, at least generally, to agree with the framework.\n\nIn the view of the Task Force, a \"best\" practice comports with the requirements of the law, as manifested in the Commission's statutory mandates: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and the applicable sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. A best practice promotes equal employment opportunity and addresses one or more barriers that adversely affect equal employment opportunity. Not only does a best practice present serious commitment from management to EEO objectives, but it also addresses management accountability for equal employment opportunity. Effective communication between management and the intended beneficiaries of the practice, as well as with all other employees, is another consistent best practice trait. A best practice embraces fairness to all employees. Finally, a best practice is implemented conscientiously and shows noteworthy results.\n\nD. \"Best\" Practice Findings\n\nThe second section of the report identifies the policies, programs, and practices that the Task Force believes reasonably likely to assist the employer community and related employees and employee groups in facilitating their equal employment opportunity programs. As indicated, the Task Force divided its study of policies, programs, and practices into seven factor groupings:\n\nRecruitment and Hiring;\n\nPromotion and Career Advancement;\n\nTerms and Conditions;\n\nTermination and Downsizing;\n\nAlternative Dispute Resolution;\n\nOther; and\n\nManagement Commitment and Accountability.\n\nThe second section begins with those companies found to be comprehensively noteworthy, and then identifies noteworthy companies in each of the seven major groupings, including management commitment and accountability. Finally, the Task Force discusses noteworthy partnership arrangements, or any type of collaborative effort involving employers and another group, to achieve EEO worksite objectives.\n\nUltimately, the most successful companies have figured out that it makes best economic sense to draw talent and ideas from all segments of the population. Inclusive hiring and promotion practices bring into the organization segments of the workforce that may well provide competitive advantage in the increasingly global economy. Systematic exclusion of these segments denies these resources to the organization and lessens the chances of eventual success. For these companies, pursuing diversity and equal employment opportunity is just as integral a business concept as increasing market share or maximizing profits. In this way, diversity and EEO become not just programs, nor even separate departments, but rather a way of life that is integral to all business activities of the company.\n\nHowever, the EEOC Best Practices Task Force recognizes that often it is not a simple matter for employers to comply with their obligations under our civil rights and EEO laws. This can be complex legal terrain. The EEOC itself enforces five separate statutes, and employers are subject to a myriad of other federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations that also govern the employment arena. Thus, there is no substitute for strong commitment and hard work in this area.\n\nThe third section reviews \"best\" practice findings from a conceptual perspective. Leading companies responding to the Task Force seem to adopt what we call a \"SPLENDID\" approach to these issues. The acronym \"SPLENDID\" stands for a series of actions that conscientious employers can take to address EEO and diversity issues: STUDY, PLAN, LEAD, ENCOURAGE, NOTICE, DISCUSSION, INCLUSION, and DEDICATION. A further explanation of the concepts behind the letters of the acronym is summarized on the following page:\n\nTHE \"SPLENDID\" APPROACH\n\nSTUDY -- Since one cannot solve problems that one doesn't know exists, know the law, the standards that define one's obligations, and the various barriers to EEO and diversity. Assistance can be obtained from EEOC, professional consultants, associations or groups, etc.\n\nPLAN -- Know one's own circumstances (workforce and demographics - locally, nationally, and globally). Define one's problem(s); propose solutions; and develop strategies for achieving them.\n\nLEAD -- Senior, middle, and lower management must champion the cause of diversity as a business imperative, and provide leadership for successful attainment of the vision of a diverse workforce at all levels of management.\n\nENCOURAGE -- Companies should encourage the attainment of diversity by all managers, supervisors, and employees, and structure their business practices and reward systems to reinforce those corporate objectives. Link pay and performance not only for technical competencies, but also for how employees interact, support and respect each other.\n\nNOTICE --Take notice of the impact of your practices, after monitoring and assessing company progress. Self-analysis is a key part of this process. Ensure that a corrective strategy does not cause or result in unfairness.\n\nDISCUSSION -- Communicate and reinforce the message that diversity is a business asset and a key element of business success in a national and global market.\n\nINCLUSION -- Bring everyone into this process, including white males. Help them understand that EEO initiatives are good for the company and, thus, good for everyone in the company. Include them in the analysis, planning, and implementation.\n\nDEDICATION -- Stay persistent in your quest. Long term gains from these practices may cost in the short term. Invest the needed human and capital resources.\n\nThe suggestions above are just a small sampling of the characteristics that seem to be common in most of the companies that operate their EEO compliance procedures above and beyond the minimum basic legal requirements. Additional ideas are set forth in each of the seven \"best\" practice areas studied. Since these ideas are rather extensive, they are not discussed here.\n\nE. Statutory, Regulatory, Policy, and Operational Changes\n\nThe fourth section considers what Commission statutory, regulatory, and policy changes may be necessary to facilitate best practices. This section also considers what the Commission might do operationally to facilitate best practices.\n\n1. Statutory, Regulatory, and Policy Considerations\n\nA Task Force committee was assigned to address Chairman Casellas' request for a review of all statutory, regulatory, and procedural guidance for their impact on the development or implementation of best practices, including, if needed, recommendations for changes. After reviewing the comments received from stakeholders and conducting our own assessment of the statutes the Commission enforces, as well as the substantive and procedural guidance documents issued by the Commission, the Task Force concludes that none of the Commission's current regulations or policy guidance hinder the development or implementation of employer best practices.\n\nIn addition, based on the input from external and internal stakeholders, the Task Force concludes that no recommendations to Congress for changes in the statutes enforced by the Commission are warranted at this time. While Congressional action to promote voluntary compliance with EEO laws and/or to facilitate employer adoption of best practices may be possible, the Task Force received no specific comments, suggestions, or recommendations in this area.\n\nFinally, the EEOC has been and continues to be committed to providing guidance to the public about the laws we enforce. That commitment includes obtaining input from internal and external stakeholders about the type and kind of policy guidance we should issue. The Office of Legal Counsel, which is primarily responsible for development of policy for consideration by the Commission, regularly meets with a broad range of external stakeholders, including personnel from other federal agencies, to seek input on policy issues. The development of policy is also driven by the types of issues that are reflected in our charge inventory and litigation docket, and by input from investigators and attorneys in the field. The Task Force believes that the Commission should continue to facilitate accessibility and responsiveness on policy issues, and continue to welcome advice and comment from stakeholders on how it may better serve the public interest.\n\nA summary of the Task Force's recommendations is as follows:\n\nThe Task Force recommends that the Commission place greater emphasis on the development of procedural and substantive guidances.\n\nThe Task Force encourages a comprehensive and speedy review of Volume II of the Compliance Manual with input from external stakeholders in close coordination with the Commission staff.\n\n2. Operational Considerations\n\nOne of the key factors in implementing best practices is for those affected by EEO laws to be well informed about their rights and responsibilities under those laws. This section of the Best Practices Task Force Report assesses what the Commission can do operationally to facilitate the development and implementation of best equal employment opportunity policies, programs, and practices. A Task Force committee was assigned to address this area.\n\na. EEOC Education, Technical Assistance, and Outreach Programs\n\nThis part of the Task Force report begins with the history of the Commission's education, technical assistance, and outreach programs designed to inform stakeholders about the statutes and changes in the law. It illustrates the Commission's longstanding and continuing commitment to education, technical assistance, and outreach. From the nationwide voluntary action program begun by the agency in 1966, to the Office of Technical Assistance, created in 1967 and which grew into a twenty-one person office by 1970, to the 1972 creation of the Office of Voluntary Programs that continued operations through the 1970s, the Commission constantly maintained a dual focus with law enforcement on the one hand, and education, outreach, and technical assistance efforts on the other.\n\nToward the end of the 1970s, the Commission's primary emphasis was on the reduction of its charge backlog. As a consequence, Commission technical assistance and education programs were de-emphasized, with resources being redirected to law enforcement programs and activities. In 1982, Chairman Clarence Thomas, reaffirming the need for active voluntary assistance to complement EEOC's enforcement efforts, required renewed managerial attention to education and outreach activities. Other such efforts initiated during this time were the Office of Special Projects (established to conduct special analyses and make recommendations of operational changes to increase the agency's effectiveness), the Office of Voluntary Assistance (which was designed to provide education and assistance to small employers, unions and individuals), and the Expanded Presence Program (designed to increase the accessibility of EEOC staff to underserved areas).\n\nWith the passage of the Gramm-Rudman Act, the EEOC was required to reevaluate its spending on voluntary assistance and education programs. Early in FY 1986, the agency concluded that it could not fully renew its budget allotments for these programs, and funding was steadily squeezed off thereafter. By 1990, our technical assistance activities were largely confined to participation as invited speakers in workshops, seminars, and conferences sponsored by other groups and organizations.\n\nPresident George Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act on July 26, 1990, and on July 26, 1992, the Commission began enforcing Title I of the ADA. In that two-year period, the Commission developed regulations and policy guidance, developed broad technical assistance programs, developed training programs for EEOC staff, as well as plans for providing training to the disability community and employers. These and subsequent ADA implementation activities were performed by the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\nThe current EEOC education, technical assistance, and outreach program consists of Commission activities in three areas: (1) national and local enforcement plans [NEP & LEP] (which pledge the Commission to education, outreach, and voluntary resolution as tools to eliminate workplace discrimination); (2) the revolving fund (which produces the agency's fee-paid technical assistance program seminars [TAPS] across the country); and (3) participation of headquarters and field office personnel in thousands of nationwide conferences, meetings, and seminars annually.\n\nb. Recommendations\n\nIn its discussions with field office staffs and external stakeholders, the Task Force received many comments and suggestions about what EEOC can do to improve both its fee paid and no-fee education and technical assistance programs in advancing the development of best practices, and the role of agency enforcement activities and general operations in helping employers develop best practices. All of these comments and suggestions were considered by the Task Force and many of them have merit. However, in times when Commission resources are limited and demands placed upon those resources are heavy, policy choices placing new stress on those resources are difficult to make. Thus, suggestions entailing large new cost outlays were generally not adopted. Moreover, some of the comments did not appear to be relevant to Task Force issues, or bore significant implications beyond the scope of this report. The Task Force has sought to address the concerns of all stakeholders, and these concerns played a key role in the formulation of its recommendations.\n\nThe Task Force's recommendations fall into four primary areas. First, the Task Force recommends that the Commission be more involved in providing employers assistance in implementing best practices. This includes providing technical assistance on-site, where possible, collecting best practices information and models, establishing industry liaison groups, providing more materials, and providing easier and more frequent access to Commission programs. Second, the Task Force recommends that the Commission engage in various communications initiatives. This includes encouraging employers to give their evaluations of Commission activities in education, technical assistance, and outreach, so that the Commission can be even more responsive to employer needs. Third, the Task Force recommends certain coordination initiatives in order to facilitate greater effectiveness and efficiency in the planning and delivery of the Commission's programs. Fourth, the Task Force has made recommendations concerning the use of its settlement agreements and/or consent decrees. A summary of the Task Force's recommendations is as follows:\n\nCommissioner-led outreach activities across the country should continue, with particular emphasis in areas which historically have been underserved by EEOC.\n\nTechnical assistance should be provided on-site.\n\nCollect best practices information and models on an ongoing or periodic basis, and provide such information in TAPS presentations and other Commission programs.\n\nOffice of Research, Information and Planning should provide research support and general industry or sector employment and best practices analyses in support of the field offices' NEP/LEP outreach, education, and technical assistance.\n\nEstablish industry liaison groups, to the extent possible, within each district office jurisdiction.\n\nRevolving Fund Division, Office of Field Programs (OFP), should continue to explore alternative ways to effectively reach nonprofit organizations and small businesses in low cost and more affordable venues and formats.\n\nConsider holding public hearings, to the extent possible, around the country and/or consider holding a few Commission meetings outside of Washington, DC.\n\nContinue to encourage open communications with employers who need help from EEOC in changing their current policies and practices.\n\nOFP should report annually on the status and accomplishments of the Revolving Fund and other education, technical assistance, and outreach\n\nprograms. The report should include an evaluation and presentation of best practices.\n\nTAPS attendees should be asked how and to what extent the program facilitated their compliance with the law and if so, whether it facilitated best practices.\n\nTo the extent possible, additional resources should be devoted to the agency's no-fee education, technical assistance, and outreach programs.\n\nOFP and Office of General Counsel should compile and catalogue best practice settlement agreements and/or consent decrees.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nThis report should be thought of, not as a blueprint, but more as an idea bank that can be drawn upon broadly by one and all. The Task Force report's findings and recommendations are not meant to require employers to adopt certain practices or policies to comply with any of the laws enforced by EEOC.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCommissioner Reginald E. Jones was appointed by Chairman Gilbert F. Casellas to head the Task Force to study best equal employment opportunity policies, programs, and practices of private sector employers. While the Commission is responsible for enforcing a variety of statutes, it also has an important role in facilitating voluntary compliance through education and training, outreach, and policy guidance.\n\nEEOC is pleased to present this report of \"best\" practices in private sector equal employment opportunity compliance. The Task Force hopes that the information contained herein will be an important resource for employers in meeting their EEO responsibilities.\n\nA. Focus of the Task Force\n\nThe primary goal of the Task Force is to facilitate voluntary equal employment opportunity compliance. Accordingly, the Task Force collected information about noteworthy business practices by which employers are complying with their EEO obligations and civil rights responsibilities, especially practices thought of as creative or innovative. The Task Force then catalogued its findings in a user friendly format.\n\nAdditionally, ideas were solicited about how the EEOC could better assist employers in developing \"best\" policies, programs, and practices, including any statutory, regulatory, policy or operational changes to promote such development.\n\nIn the view of the Task Force, a best practice must comport with the requirements of the law, as manifested in the EEOC's statutory mandates:\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended;\n\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended;\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n\nEqual Pay Act of 1963, as amended; and\n\nApplicable sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\n\nA best practice should promote equal employment opportunity and address one or more barriers that adversely impact equal employment opportunity. Not only must there be a serious commitment from management to EEO objectives, but additionally, management accountability for equal employment opportunity is a necessary component of any worthy program. There must also be effective communication between management and the intended beneficiaries of the practice. The practice must necessarily embrace fairness to all employees. Finally, the practice must be implemented conscientiously and should show noteworthy results.\n\nInitially the Task Force divided its study of policies, programs, and practices into six major groupings:\n\nRecruitment and Hiring;\n\nPromotion and Career Advancement;\n\nTerms and Conditions of Employment;\n\nTermination and Downsizing;\n\nAlternative Dispute Resolution; and\n\nOther Policies, Programs, and Practices.\n\nHowever, since Management Commitment and Accountability emerged from the companies' submittals as an important factor in the success of their EEO compliance efforts, it was decided to add a seventh grouping.\n\nThe focus of \"recruitment and hiring\" is on affirmative recruitment programs and strategies designed to create a diverse workforce, such as internships, work/study, and other education and training programs used for hiring.\n\nThe focus of \"promotion and career advancement\" is on programs that have eliminated barriers to the advancement of women, people from diverse ethnic and racial groups, persons with disabilities, and older workers. Such programs as mentoring, education and training for purposes of promotion, and career enhancement initiatives were considered in this group.\n\nThe focus of \"terms and conditions\" includes disability and religious accommodation programs, such as effective mechanisms for addressing reasonable accommodation requests. The focus also includes sexual harassment, pay equity, insurance, and employee benefits. Additionally, many companies cited their numerous work-life and family-friendly policies and practices as very supportive of their diversity and equal employment opportunity objectives. The companies have been able to help their employees realize that these programs are not just for married employees or pregnant women. Employees and dependents with disabilities, as well as men also have benefitted greatly from these programs. Most importantly, these programs have enabled the companies to retain the top quality employees that they've worked so hard to recruit and hire, including minorities, women, and persons with disabilities. Some companies also stressed that work-life and family-friendly programs are an integral part of their diversity, equal employment, and affirmative action efforts.\n\nThe focus of \"termination and downsizing\" is on such areas as retraining and placement programs for employees displaced by downsizing programs, and nondiscriminatory early retirement programs.\n\n\"Alternative dispute resolution\" focuses on early resolution of employment discrimination complaints, and voluntary and effective alternative dispute resolution programs.\n\nThe focus of \"other\" embraces any other policies, programs, or practices not readily identifiable in the previous five groups or where there is an overlap between or among groups.\n\nSince \"management commitment and accountability\" are driving forces behind a company's EEO policies, programs, and practices, it was decided to devote a section of the report to management commitment and accountability. Management commitment focuses on what management is doing to facilitate equal employment opportunities. Accountability focuses on the mechanisms in evaluating management's performance involving equal employment opportunity programs. The Task Force looked at such tools as performance appraisals, compensation incentives, and other evaluation measures to reflect a manager's ability to set high standards and demonstrate progress.\n\nMany stakeholders submitted information about employers' innovative or special efforts. The practices selected by the Task Force were generally viewed in terms of the criteria set forth in our discussion above of what a \"best\" practice exemplifies. The Task Force focused on those practices that were explained in detail, and that were accompanied by an explanation as to why the practice is of a noteworthy nature. Furthermore, the Task Force favored those practices that were presented with data that demonstrated their effectiveness.\n\nUnfortunately, time and financial resources limited the scope of the group's work. The Task Force, as a whole, did not have the luxury of conducting on-site visits or validation studies. The Task Force's work began, and continued on an on-going basis, with an exhaustive review of the \"best practices\" literature. This was followed by an extensive effort to contact companies that might be willing to submit information on a policy or program that they considered a \"best\" EEO practice. Thereafter, paper examinations were conducted relying on submissions at face value, although follow up was done, where it was available and felt to be helpful. The Task Force examined the submissions to see how the policy or practice was implemented, who was accountable for success of the policy or practice, how was the policy or practice communicated, and what was the employer's commitment to the policy or practice. The Task Force generally accepted as accurate whatever commitment, communication, accountability, and implementation factors were reported by the companies, as well as the results. In sum, the Task Force's review considered whether the practice was in compliance with the law, whether it would \"likely\" promote effective equal employment opportunity strategies, and whether the practice was fair.\n\nThe Task Force's recognition of best practices in this report is a qualified one. However, the Task Force believes, that if appropriately implemented, considering the factual circumstances surrounding the implementation, the cited practices would be reasonably likely to promote equal employment opportunity. Indeed, the Task Force recognizes that the companies submitting the policies and practices believe they have been highly successful in the promotion of equal employment opportunity and, thus, are deserving of recognition.\n\nThe Task Force wishes to stress that a best practice may not necessarily be universally replicable on a successful basis regardless of employer or industry. We think, however, that the recognition of the practices in this report can give employers valuable ideas on what has worked for other employers, and stimulate development of new approaches to old problems. Such practices may very well be the basis for replication, although individual tailoring of the practice to the requirements of the individual employer or worksite may be necessary.\n\nFinally, the citation of an employer for a best practice does not necessarily mean that it is a problem-free model equal employment opportunity employer. A cited practice may involve only a specific area of equal employment opportunity. For example, an employer may have an excellent sexual harassment policy and program, but may not have an effective policy on the employment of people with disabilities. A model employer must necessarily do many things, involving a multitude of areas, in a commendable manner. We emphasize, however, that like most employers, those employers found to be comprehensively noteworthy in this report are not necessarily immune from criticism, given the parameters and limitations of the Task Force's review of submitted material.\n\nB. Methodology\n\nThe Task Force had numerous meetings. At the outset, these meetings focused on the process of gathering the required information - primarily in the form of answering the questions of how, what, and to whom to communicate the Task Force's interest in best equal employment opportunity compliance efforts. Initially, the Task Force sent letters directly to all employers with 25,000 or more employees, a total of some 231 companies, informing the employers of the creation of the Task Force and its mission. These companies employ 30% of the employees covered by the Commission's EEO-1 reports, and were felt to represent a statistically significant slice of all American workplaces.\n\nThe Task Force also sent more than 100 letters informing a wide variety of\n\nassociations representing employers, employees, and civil rights groups about the Task Force and its mission. The hope was that the organizations would further spread word of the Task Force and its mission to their members.\n\nFurther, the Task Force prepared and sent a survey questionnaire to nine organizations (limited to nine in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act) selected to represent a broad cross-section of our stakeholders. These included:\n\nAFL-CIO;\n\nEqual Employment Advisory Council;\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Committee of the Labor and Employment Law Section of the American Bar Association;\n\nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights;\n\nNational Association of Minority Contractors;\n\nNational Association of Manufacturers;\n\nNational Federation of Independent Business;\n\nSociety for Human Resource Management; and the\n\nUnited States Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Task Force sent letters to each member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce informing them of our mission. These letters stressed that we would welcome Congressional input on all matters under Task Force consideration. A subsequent letter to the chairmen and ranking members of these committees added a further specific inquiry as to whether National Labor Relations Act standards on employer-employee committees impede formulation of employer best practices in the area of EEO compliance or diversity efforts.\n\nWe carefully reviewed the existing \"best practices\" literature and searched assiduously for reports by the news media for employers cited by others or self-proclaiming best EEO practices. The Task Force also set forth its purpose and interest in best equal employment opportunity practices on the Internet with a link to the EEOC World Wide Web home page. Members of the Task Force explored company home pages on the World Wide Web for interesting equal employment opportunity policies, programs, or practices. As a result of these efforts, we contacted numerous employers about their illustrative equal employment policies, programs, or practices. Indeed, we responded to any individual or group that expressed interest in the Task Force.\n\nLetters also were sent to all Commission employees seeking their input, both in terms of employers with best practices and Commission facilitation of best practices. Finally, we contacted the Commission's Office of Legal Counsel and Office of General Counsel for their views.\n\nThe Task Force met with representatives of the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs to discuss their views on best equal employment practices involving employers subject to the jurisdiction of that office. Their experience and contacts generated from the Secretary's Opportunity 2000 and Exemplary Voluntary Efforts (EVE) Award programs proved invaluable to our efforts to uncover best EEO practices.\n\nCommissioner Jones held roundtable meetings with groups of employers in Albuquerque, NM, Chicago, IL, Cleveland, OH, Houston, TX, Philadelphia, PA, and San Francisco, CA. In his Houston trip, he spoke at an awards dinner hosted by the Governor of Texas, George Bush, Jr., the Mayor of Houston, Robert Lanier, and their respective committees on the employment of persons with disabilities, honoring individuals and companies for their meritorious service in this area. Further, Commissioner Jones made site visits to several companies. Specifically, these visits were with Intel Corporation in Albuquerque, NM, Pacific Telesis in San Ramon, CA, and International Business Machines in North Tarrytown, NY.\n\nThe Task Force received materials from more than seventy organizations, employers, and individuals, not including input from Commission employees. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of materials were received directly from employers in a wide range of industries and across all business sectors.\n\nC. Organization of the Report\n\nSection I of the report identifies what the Task Force considers to be relevant in determining what a \"best\" practice involves. This was not an easy task. The Task Force recognizes that reasonable persons may differ on the question. Nevertheless, the Task Force concluded that most stakeholders should be able, at least generally, to agree with the framework set forth therein.\n\nSection II of the report identifies the policies, programs, and practices that the Task Force believes may be reasonably likely to assist the employer community in facilitating their equal employment opportunity programs.\n\nSub-Section (II. A.) denotes some of the limitations on the review that was conducted by the Task Force.\n\nThe Task Force decided to present some companies, who seem to have EEO programs that are particularly noteworthy, from a comprehensive perspective. These companies' programs addressed most, if not all, of the seven major groupings delineated above. A discussion of these companies and their programs can be found in Sub-Section (II. B.).\n\nSub-Sections (II. C. through II. I.) identify noteworthy companies in the seven major groupings, including management commitment and accountability.\n\nIn Sub-Section (II. J.) the Task Force discusses noteworthy partnership arrangements (i.e., entities or organizations that assist other companies in forming positive employment relationships, including EEO and diversity considerations).\n\nPlease note that colored paper is used in the second section to assist the reader in comprehending the underlying organization of the material, and to aid in quick identification of the sub-parts. The buff-colored pages have summaries of the companies' submittals that are being featured. The blue-colored pages contain even briefer summaries of all of the company submittals for each of the seven major groupings identified above. They are intended to help the reader see at a glance, by each major group, the wide variety of approaches that the companies have submitted.\n\nSection III sets forth the Task Force's \"Best\" Practice Findings. The Task Force approaches its findings from two perspectives. First, it gives a general perspective, in macro terms, for approaching a noteworthy EEO and diversity program. Second, it gives a more specific perspective correlated to each of the seven groupings or areas.\n\nSection IV considers possible Commission regulatory, policy, and operational changes, as well as any statutory changes that may be necessary to facilitate best practices. The Task Force reviewed the statutes enforced by the Commission, as well as its regulations, policies, and operations to determine whether changes made or recommended by the Commission might facilitate the development of best policies, programs, and practices. This section sets forth the Task Force's recommendations.\n\nSection V includes the index of companies participating in the Task Force study.\n\nSome of the Commission's guidelines on the law are included in the Appendices.\n\nFinally, the Task Force wishes to make it abundantly clear that the Task Force is not telling employers how they must comply with the law. Rather, it is the hope that this report will help and guide employers in complying with the law, and more.\n\nD. Acknowledgments\n\nA number of agencies, organizations, and institutions provided invaluable assistance to the Task Force by sharing their resource information about companies. These are listed below:\n\nDepartment of Education's Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative\n\nServices;\n\nDepartment of Energy's Office of Civil Rights;\n\nDepartment of Labor's Office of the Secretary, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, and the Women's Bureau;\n\nGeneral Accounting Office;\n\nMerit Systems Protection Board;\n\nGlass Ceiling Commission;\n\nPresident's Committee for the Employment of Persons with Disabilities;\n\nAmerican Bar Association's Equal Employment Opportunity Committee;\n\nCatalyst;\n\nChicago Area Partnership;\n\nEdison Electric Institute;\n\nEqual Employment Advisory Council;\n\nSociety for Human Resource Management;\n\nChildren's Hospital of Boston, MA, in conjunction with the Institute for Community Inclusion; and the\n\nPennsylvania State University (Best Practices in Diversity Conference).\n\nA substantial number of submissions were received by the Task Force representing a collection of high quality ideas on diversity and EEO. It is noteworthy that the rate of return (number of submissions versus number of solicitations) experienced by the Task Force compares favorably with the experiences of other private and public efforts to solicit best practices submissions from the business community.\n\nThe reasons for any reluctance on the part of employers are probably as many and varied as their numbers and operations. Certainly, many employers may have had conflicting demands such that they simply could not afford the time required to prepare a submission. Many employers also may have had an unduly modest perception of their policies, programs, and practices. In addition, a number of employers expressed reservations about divulging information to the EEOC because of a concern that such information might come into play in some subsequent EEOC enforcement action against them. Since the Task Force obviously could not guarantee immunity to any employer making a submission, this concern may have held back employers who otherwise would have participated in our effort. Indeed, a few \"best\" practices were submitted anonymously.\n\nSeveral employers also indicated proprietary and confidentiality constraints on revealing the details of their programs. It appears that some outside consultants uniformly impose such constraints where they have devised programs for employers. At least one employer also expressed a reluctance to release information because of competitive concerns about other companies raiding its employees. Finally, one employer expressed an interest in an EEOC awards program, indicating that existence of such a program could induce it to make a submission. Here, the Task Force could only respond that the Commission had not instituted an awards program and, at least in the short term, was unlikely to do so. Nevertheless, the Task Force consistently expressed its interest in seeing whatever EEO, affirmative action or diversity policies, programs, and practices that the employers were proud of themselves.\n\nSECTION I WHAT IS A \"BEST\" PRACTICE?\n\nThe Task Force considered a number of factors in addressing the concept of what is a \"best\" practice:\n\nA \"best\" practice complies with the law.\n\nA \"best\" practice promotes equal employment opportunity and addresses one or more barriers that adversely affect equal employment opportunity.\n\nA \"best\" practice manifests management commitment and accountability.\n\nA \"best\" practice ensures management and employee communication.\n\nA \"best\" practice produces noteworthy results.\n\nA \"best\" practice does not cause or result in unfairness.\n\nThe Task Force recognizes that these factors can be interrelated. Thus, for example, compliance with the laws will often promote equal employment opportunity and address one or more barriers that adversely affect EEO. In order to promote equal employment opportunity and address barriers to EEO, strong management commitment is necessary. Management commitment must be evidenced, in part, by communication with employees. Management accountability is an indicia of management commitment and is necessary for a practice to be implemented and monitored. The law is based on fairness. In order to produce results, all of the above factors are going to be involved in some way.\n\nA. A \"best\" practice complies with the law.\n\n[1]\n\nThe Commission enforces five statutes that prohibit job discrimination by private sector employers: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA), and certain sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 that amended provisions of Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA.[2]\n\nTitle VII prohibits employment discrimination based upon race, color, sex, religion, or national origin; the ADEA prohibits employment discrimination against persons forty years of age and older; and the ADA prohibits employment discrimination based on disability. Employers are prohibited from discriminating in the hiring; promotion; discharge; compensation; terms, conditions and privileges of employment; and in the classifying, limiting or segregating of individuals for employment. Employers are also prohibited from printing or publishing discriminatory advertisements, and from retaliating against any individual for opposing a discriminatory practice, filing a charge, or participating in the EEO process. In addition, Title VII and the ADA explicitly prohibit discrimination by joint labor-management committees in the admission or employment of individuals in any program established to provide apprenticeship or other training.\n\nThe ADA protects qualified individuals with disabilities. A qualified individual with a disability is a person who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position. The ADA also prohibits --\n\nparticipating in a contractual or other arrangement or relationship (such as with training organizations or employment agencies) that has the effect of subjecting a covered entity's applicants or employees to prohibited discrimination;\n\ndiscriminating against a qualified individual because of his/her relationship or association with an individual with a disability; and\n\nasking disability-related questions or conducting medical examinations until after making a conditional job offer to the applicant.\n\nThe EPA prohibits sex discrimination in the payment of wages (including fringe benefits) to men and women performing substantially equal work under similar working conditions in the same establishment.\n\nAs indicated, a \"best\" practice should comport with the requirements of the law. While this certainly is a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one. For example, the Task Force recognizes that certain courts have found that employer-imposed, pre-dispute, mandatory, binding arbitration complies with the law. The Commission, however, has taken the position that such systems are inappropriate and unlawful to the extent that they deny charging parties access to the statutorily prescribed avenues of relief (both administrative and judicial). Accordingly, as a Task Force of the Commission, we viewed the issue of best practices from the Commission's perspective, and regarded Commission policy and interpretative guidance as a threshold benchmark. Furthermore, we suggest that mere compliance with the law is not especially noteworthy since all employers must meet that standard. In other words, a \"best\" practice is not accomplished by minimal compliance with the law.\n\nB. A \"best\" practice promotes equal employment opportunity and addresses one or more barriers that adversely affect equal employment opportunity.\n\nWe will first discuss those barriers that affect equal employment opportunity in a general manner, as distinguished from barriers that are specific to the particular type of employment action. The general barriers also tend to be socially counterproductive, while the specific barriers are more indigenous to the employer. Finally, the barriers, general or specific, can serve to discriminate against minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and older workers and accordingly serve to deny them equal employment opportunity. We do not attempt to delineate a comprehensive list of these barriers. Rather, what follows is for illustrative purposes.\n\n1. General Barriers that Inhibit Equal Employment Opportunity\n\na. The \"Like Me\" Syndrome\n\nIt is an axiom of human nature that people often like to associate with other people who are like themselves. This enhances a comfort level in working relationships. Such \"like me\" bias may be conscious or unconscious. Nevertheless, the \"like me\" syndrome can lead to a tendency to employ and work with people like oneself in terms of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age, and disability. Thus, it can lead to a bias and an unwillingness to employ people unlike oneself. For example, women have justifiably complained that the old boy network, with business deals and decisions being made, and professional relationships and alliances being formed in conjunction with male bonding activities, creates a glass ceiling limiting the advancement of women. Perceived cultural differences and ethnocentrism can also feed on the \"like me\" syndrome and may result in the denial of equal employment opportunities.[3]\n\nThe \"like me\" syndrome can also influence an employer's assessment on the norms of performance. Thus, there may be the perception that someone \"different\" is less able to do the job and that someone \"like me\" is more able to do the job. This can further adversely affect equal employment opportunity for minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and older workers.\n\nb. Stereotypes\n\nPeople may have stereotypes of other individuals based on their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability, and age. Many times these stereotypes are negative and erroneous, and thus adversely affect the targeted employees.[4] Such stereotypes can breed subtle racism, sexism, prejudice, and discomfort. Stereotypes must be addressed in the EEO context because they may be used as \"factual\" bases for employment decisions.[5]\n\nOn the other hand, people may have stereotypes of what makes a good employee or successful executive (e.g., that young white males generally are positive role models of excellent employees or of good citizens, while African American males are not; or that Asian Americans are \"model minorities,\" but not fully accepted \"Americans;\" or that women are too soft, caring, or concerned about human relations to be strong, decisive managers, etc.). Such stereotypes, especially if they are the underlying beliefs and attitudes that form the bases of employment decisions, can also adversely affect other individuals who are members or non-members of any of the numerous diverse groups in our society or in the workplace.\n\nc. Prejudice\n\nIt cannot be denied that there may be instances of outright bigotry on the part of an employer or its management for or against a targeted group. Hopefully, thirty years after the enactment of Title VII, such cases of outright prejudice in the area of equal employment opportunity should be rare. But experience tells us that this most basic type of discrimination still exists. [6]\n\nd. Perception of Loss by Persons Threatened by Equal Employment Opportunity Practices\n\nFor example, as the workplace becomes more diverse, and special voluntary efforts are made by companies to recruit and hire from all groups, based on selection standards of hiring or promoting the best qualified individual for the position, some white males, or any other groups who traditionally have been the predominant employees of a particular workforce or occupation, may grow anxious and view themselves as losing employment control and opportunity. As they perceive a direct threat to their own equal employment opportunities, they may feel that they need to overzealously protect their own prospects, by impeding the prospects of others.[7]\n\ne. Ignorance\n\nEmployers, especially smaller entities, may just not be well-versed in the requirements of equal employment opportunity. Acts of discrimination committed in this context may be the result of ignorance. Employers may not know how the law applies because they have received poor or inaccurate advice. Even the largest employers may have managers who are not well-versed in the EEO laws. To a large degree, stereotyping feeds on ignorance, but the repercussions of ignorance go much farther than stereotyping.\n\nf. Other Barriers\n\nOf course, there are other barriers to equal employment opportunity. Lack of education is perhaps the most significant. Without education, most employment opportunities are foreclosed. Indeed, for most higher paying employment opportunities, higher education is a prerequisite.\n\n2. More Specific Barriers\n\nThere are many specific barriers to equal employment opportunity. These barriers tend to be indigenous to the employer's operations, rather than societal or culturally based. The general barriers, on the other hand, tend to be external to the employer, to the extent that they are societal or culturally based. Since there are so many possible specific barriers to equal employment opportunity, we decided to briefly list only a sampling of these barriers for each grouping.\n\na. Barriers to Recruitment and Hiring\n\nNot knowing where to recruit.\n\nFailing to advertise widely.\n\nRecruitment practices that overlook or fail to seek all qualified individuals.\n\nReliance on informal networks of recruitment or word-of-mouth.\n\nFailing to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities.\n\nNo formal systems for recruitment.\n\nLimited pool of targeted groups of persons with required qualifications.\n\nb. Barriers to Advancement and Promotion\n\nLack of employee access to mentoring.\n\nDeficient performance evaluation and promotion processes.\n\nLack of management training.\n\nLack of opportunities for career development and rotational job assignments.\n\nFailing to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities.\n\nPoor career planning and development.\n\nLittle or no access to informal networks of communication.\n\nInability to get feedback.\n\nDifferent standards of performance, disparate treatment.\n\nLack of career counseling and exclusion from career ladders.\n\nLack of equal access to assignments that provide key career experiences.\n\nLack of equal access to assignments that provide visibility and interaction with senior managers.\n\nEEO directors not included in recruitment process for higher levels.\n\nLimited pool of targeted group of persons with required qualifications.\n\nFailure to post/advertise promotional opportunities.\n\nc. Barriers in Terms and Conditions\n\nUnsupportive work environment.\n\nUnequal pay.\n\nCounterproductive behavior and harassment in the workplace.\n\nEmployer policies that are not family friendly.\n\nInflexible hours and working conditions.\n\nFailing to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities.\n\nFailure to accommodate religious needs.\n\nd. Barriers in Termination and Downsizing\n\nUnfairness of standards used in making decisions.\n\nDifferences in benefits given.\n\nInadequate planning.\n\nFailing to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities in terms of denials of reassignments and targets for termination.\n\nLack of adequate incentives to encourage voluntary separations.\n\nLack of communication between employers and employees.\n\nFailure to provide counseling, job placement assistance, and training.\n\ne. Barriers in Alternative Dispute Resolution\n\nNo formal mechanisms for ADR.\n\nUnfairness of procedures.\n\nNot voluntary.\n\nC. A \"best\" practice manifests management commitment and accountability.\n\nManagement must have a positive and unequivocal commitment to equal employment opportunity. Without commitment from top-level management to front-line supervisors, nothing can reasonably be expected to be done. Management commitment must be a driving force.\n\nThis commitment may be evidenced, in part, by management directives, mandating equal employment opportunity policies. Management should communicate throughout the organization that it is committed to equal employment opportunity and will not tolerate unlawful discrimination in any form. EEO should be integrated into all aspects of an employer's policies and practices, including the identification of those aspects of the organization's culture and environment that are barriers to equal employment opportunity.\n\nThis commitment must, however, also include the will to act as required and as appropriate, especially in addressing the barriers to equal employment opportunity specific to the organization's culture and work environment. Management must also monitor the results of its efforts and decisions. Management should support interested advisory and support groups. Management should also provide employee groups with access to high-level management.\n\nWithout accountability, there is a lack of responsibility. Accountability goes hand-in-hand with commitment.\n\nD. A \"best\" practice ensures management and employee communication.\n\nManagement should participate and interact with employees and employee groups. It should encourage ongoing discussions about diversity issues. Communication should be encouraged from the \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\", including CEO speeches to employees and letters from employees to management. Information about equal employment policies, programs, and practices should be distributed to all employees, informing everyone of management's positions on the various aspects of equal employment opportunity. Employers should continually communicate career opportunities to all employees, including competencies, skills, and abilities required. With communication, management and employees are able to understand equal employment opportunity programs and their goals, ascertain to what extent the goals are being met, and work together to make programs better.\n\nE. A \"best\" practice does not cause or result in unfairness.\n\nThe issue of fairness most often comes into play when considering affirmative action programs. The Commission supports affirmative action programs that are consistent with the law.[8] The Commission views such programs as a limited, but important, tool in the fight to eradicate discrimination. An employer can adopt a voluntary affirmative action plan if it identifies a manifest imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories. A voluntary affirmative action plan cannot unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-targeted groups, usually non-minorities or men.\n\nThe plan must be designed to break down patterns of segregation and to open employment opportunities for the targeted groups, usually minorities, women, or persons with disabilities in jobs from which they have traditionally been barred. For example, such a plan cannot require the discharge of non-targeted employees and their replacement with targeted employees, nor can it create an absolute bar to the advancement of non-targeted employees. Applicable law also requires that an individual who benefits from affirmative action must be qualified for the job at issue, although that individual need not be the most qualified individual.\n\nAffirmative action, when properly designed and implemented, does not allow for the use of quotas - the inflexible reliance solely on numbers that ignore qualifications. A voluntary affirmative action plan must be temporary and flexible, and it cannot be used to maintain a balanced workforce. A voluntary plan should be regularly reviewed to ensure that goals and timetables are justified and flexible and that the rights of non-targeted groups are not unduly burdened.[9]\n\nF. A \"best\" practice produces noteworthy results.\n\nA practice may look great on paper, but without implementation and results, its value is subject to conjecture and in any event, unrealized. Simply put, actions speak louder than words. With implementation and evaluation, one can see what has worked and how well it has worked. It goes without saying that results are relevant in assessing whether a practice may be deserving of commendation or imitation. Significant and impressive results of practices to enhance equal employment opportunity give greater credence to those practices.\n\nG. Other Considerations\n\n.\n\nThe Task Force also looked at the innovative aspects of the practices submitted for consideration. However, innovation was not necessarily a prerequisite to being a \"best\" practice. Rather, the paramount consideration was the evidence that the practice worked well within the context of the criteria just discussed. Finally, the Task Force also checked to ensure that there were no indications, based on Commission compliance reviews, of substantial noncompliance by the employer with any civil rights laws under the Commission's jurisdiction.\n\nSECTION II TASK FORCE'S REVIEW OF \"BEST\" PRACTICES\n\nA. Limitations on the Task Force's Review\n\nThe Task Force recognizes that a \"best\" practice must be viewed in terms of the specific facts and circumstances of the employer. A \"best\" practice may, but not necessarily, vary from industry to industry or from employer to employer. The Task Force hopes, however, that this report will help employers, especially smaller and medium-sized entities, who may not have the financial resources to obtain sufficient legal and other professional advice in their efforts to achieve full EEO compliance.\n\nTime and financial resources limited the scope of the Task Force's work. The Task Force had approximately seven months to compile the information, including follow up, thoroughly review the submissions by stakeholders, engage in discussions with stakeholders in roundtable and focus group settings, engage in dialogue within the Task Force, and write the report. Because of budgetary constraints, the Task Force was limited in the amount of outreach that could be done in preparing this report.\n\nAccordingly, the Task Force, as a whole, did not conduct site visits or do validation studies of the submissions. Essentially, the Task Force process consisted of paper examinations relying on employer submissions at face value, although follow up was done, where it was felt to be helpful.\n\nThe Task Force essentially considered whether the practice complied with the law, whether it would promote equal employment opportunity and remove the barrier or barriers it was designed to address, and its fairness. Even with these three factors, the Task Force could not make definitively final and ultimate conclusions, because specific factual circumstances could come into play that could vitiate these factors.\n\nNevertheless, the Task Force considered the employer's belief that its practice was a commendable one. Of course, such a belief by the employer does not by that fact alone make the practice a best practice. The Task Force thus evaluated whether the employer's belief was reasonable within the framework of the above factors, keeping in mind that definitively final and ultimate conclusions could not be made given the limits of the Task Force's evaluation. Even with these limitations, the Task Force believes that much can be gained from an examination of the \"best\" practices reviewed in this report.\n\nIn conclusion, the Task Force's recognition of best practices in this report is a qualified one. The Task Force believes, however, that if appropriately implemented, considering the factual circumstances surrounding the implementation, the cited practices would be reasonably likely to promote equal employment opportunity.\n\nThe Task Force is most appreciative of those stakeholders who took the time and effort to share their best practices with us. However, the Task Force stresses that a best practice may not necessarily be universally replicable regardless of employer or industry. We think, nevertheless, that the recognition of the practices in this report can give employers valuable ideas on what has worked for other employers. The Task Force hopes that at least many of the examples of best practices can act as a framework or prototype by which other employers can develop similar programs and/or policies. However, employers may need to tailor the practices to their own needs and circumstances.\n\nThe Task Force has tried to faithfully and accurately describe the policies, programs, and practices for which the companies are recognized. The Task Force has relied to the utmost on the companies' submissions, and regrets any misstatements that might inadvertently occur in the description of the companies' policies, programs, and practices.\n\nFinally, since time and resource constraints made it impossible to validate the accuracy of the submissions, or to assess how they are being implemented, it is important to emphasize that the Commission is not endorsing any particular policy, program, or practice. Rather, the Commission's goal is to identify and disseminate information about practices currently being implemented by employers which are likely to promote voluntary compliance with the laws enforced by EEOC.\n\nB. Comprehensive Programs Presented by Companies\n\nAt the outset, the goal of the Task Force was to examine individual best EEO practices within certain discrete categories: the original six of recruitment and hiring; promotion and career advancement\n\n;\n\nterms and conditions; termination and downsizing; alternative dispute resolution; other policies, programs and practices; and the subsequently added seventh category of management commitment and accountability. The idea was to allow even companies that had not put together comprehensive programs, but had succeeded in crafting one or more exemplary policies, to participate in the best practices discussion.\n\nHowever, as work progressed on the submissions made by various companies, it became clear that a number of them had done outstanding work in formulating comprehensive EEO and diversity strategies. Further, these companies impressed the Task Force with their ability to integrate workplace EEO and diversity into their basic business plans. The latter concept, i.e., that in a diverse nation and in a diverse world, having a diverse workforce is, at least, a business asset and, more likely, a business necessity, is the primary revelation of the work done by the Task Force.\n\nAccordingly, the Task Force decided to select a number of companies, that it thought presented noteworthy comprehensive EEO programs, addressing most, if not all, of the specific areas set forth for discussion. To view a company's set of programs, as a whole, instead of piecemeal, has the advantage of allowing the reader to see how the company integrates its programs into various operations of the company.\n\nThis is not to say that these companies are exemplary in all of the discussed areas. Rather, the selected companies were chosen for the comprehensiveness of their programs. In addition, we concluded, based on the materials presented by the companies, that the programs went above and beyond the requirements of the law, addressed many barriers to equal employment opportunity, and did not cause or result in unfairness.\n\nThe selected companies are discussed in alphabetical order.\n\nTHE BUREAU OF NATIONAL AFFAIRS, INC.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (BNA), is a publishing company based in Washington, DC. All of the stock in the company is held by its employees and retirees. It is the oldest fully employee-owned company in the United States, this year celebrating fifty years of employee ownership. There are no special stock options or bonus plans for executives and managers; and the company's top executives hold less than ten percent of all outstanding shares. Employee-shareholders vote each spring for the board of directors, twelve of whom are BNA employees or retirees. There are three outside directors who do not work for BNA nor own any company stock.\n\nBNA produces over 200 highly technical, specialized information services in print and electronic formats. These services are intended to provide accurate, comprehensive information on all major developments in labor, legal, tax, economic, environmental, safety, and health activities of the nation. The more than 1,600 employees (500 of whom are reporters and editors) are represented by the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild. A subsidiary company, BNA Communications, produces a line of products focusing on EEO and diversity issues.\n\nRecruitment and Hiring\n\nBNA indicates it makes every effort to recruit qualified minorities and women to its professional level positions. Representatives attend a number of job fairs sponsored by minority associations, and also some that are sponsored by minority universities. When the company goes outside of the company to fill open positions, BNA posts notices on the job hot lines and in the publications of the Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American Journalists Associations.\n\nBNA recently established a scholarship program which awards scholarships of $3,500 to students at three area minority universities, who are working toward degrees in law, information systems, and marketing. In addition, BNA provides those students with opportunities to participate in summer internship programs. Included in its opportunities for traineeships, BNA has a minority editorial traineeship, which allows the person to begin work at BNA at a grade that is just below the experienced reporter level. After a one-year traineeship, the trainee is eligible to bid on positions that have been posted internally in the same manner as other employees. Eventually, the trainee is moved into a position as an experienced employee.\n\nFor the last three years, BNA has been involved in initiatives aimed at providing skills and job opportunities to residents of the District of Columbia (DC). One program, Summerworks\n\n,\n\nfocuses on the high school and college students who live in DC. In 1995, there were six students in the program.\n\nThe second program, Do The Write Thing\n\n,\n\nis an outreach initiative to curb urban violence and provide highly motivated youth with positive alternatives. It provides middle school students with a variety of office skills and other practical work experience. In place of salary, the students receive specifically designated savings accounts that they can use when they graduate from high school. Three students were sponsored last year, and five will be sponsored this year. The students all come from Francis Jr. High School, which is located across the street from BNA's headquarters building.\n\nPromotion and Career Advancement\n\nBNA's Human Resources Training and Development Group has put together a number of programs which provide employees the opportunity to develop professionally and personally. Managing Personal Growth provides employees with tools to enter into a development discussion with their supervisors. The Human Resources Training and Development Group staff also has developed specific training curricula in a number of areas, and has established an Individual Learning Center\n\nwhere employees can take advantage of a number of learning aids and work at their own pace.\n\nBNA has developed a Temporary Transfer Program, where managers can use temporary vacancies as a way to allow employees to move into other positions, where there is a need for temporary help and the employees gain new skills that might be beneficial in moving to a permanent job at a later date. BNA gives the example of one young woman who used the temporary transfer program to gain new skills in the editorial arena, and was hired into a full-time position in the Editorial Department of BNA.\n\nThe BNA-Guild Traineeship Committee helps otherwise capable employees overcome obstacles to upward mobility. Several employees have moved from clerical/support positions to professional level positions. The traineeship committee takes long term employees who otherwise lack the necessary skills and places them in traineeship positions that eventually lead to permanent jobs. The EEO career development subcommittee, with the assistance of the Human Resources department, started an informal mentoring program.\n\nBNA's tuition aid program gives employees an opportunity to take classes that will help them complete an undergraduate degree, pursue a graduate degree in their professional field, or otherwise prepare for jobs in the company. The program provides up to $9,000 a year in tuition reimbursement.\n\nA management succession committee, consisting of the three outside board directors and one inside director, works with department heads on succession planning matters. In a questionnaire to be submitted to the committee, department heads must identify staff members with the capacity to become members of the senior management team, paying particular attention to qualified minorities and women. The questionnaire also requests that department heads identify assignments, course work, and other development opportunities that should be made available to these individuals.\n\nThe president of a major subsidiary, Tax Management, Inc., is a woman who started working at BNA as a reporter over twenty years ago and rose through the ranks to her current position. This year, she was named Vice Chair of the BNA Board of Directors. The Vice President of Human Resources is a woman who was appointed to her position in July 1994, after ten years of service at BNA, mostly as Director of Labor and Employee Relations. One Vice President and Editor-in-Chief is a woman who, in over twenty years at BNA, rose from the level of reporter, managing editor, and associate editor, to her current position. Currently, half of the executive editors in the Editorial department are women.\n\nTwo of BNA's eight Vice Presidents are minorities. The Vice President and General Counsel is an Asian American woman, and the Vice President of Information Technology is an African American male. Several minorities manage one or more BNA publications, and there also are minorities in managerial and professional level positions in other departments in the company. Six of the fifteen members of the current board of directors are women, and one director is an African American male.\n\nBNA has several subsidiary companies, all of which have their own boards of directors. The company appoints members to serve on these boards. Service on these boards has been identified as an excellent developmental opportunity for employees, especially minorities and women.\n\nTerms and Conditions of Employment\n\nBNA makes an effort to adapt working schedules to child care and other family needs where possible, recognizing that in some working units the demands of the business leave little room for flexible schedules. There have been several alternative work pattern arrangements in different units at BNA, including a formal telecommuting program in the Indexing Department.\n\nThe BNA-Guild Work & Family Committee informs employees on work and family opportunities. Family services include child care and elder care referral services through the employee assistance plan, subsidized emergency back-up child care at a nearby day care center, and providing for priority placement at a child care center in Shady Grove, MD. BNA contracts with the Capital Kids to provide emergency care for children of BNA employees; contributes $8,000 per year to the operation of the center; and contributes more than half of the cost of care (per child) for each day that the center is used by BNA employees.\n\nEmployees earn thirteen days of sick leave a year, and there is no limit to the amount of sick leave that may be carried over from year to year. Employees may use their sick leave to care for a sick child. In addition to sick leave, employees are credited with three days of personal leave that they may use during the course of the year. Employees earn up to five weeks of annual leave a year, and may use their personal or annual leave for whatever purposes they choose, including opportunities to participate in religious observances.\n\nBNA feels that its health insurance coverage is among the best in the U.S. There are no employee contributions for coverage under BNA's health plan for employees or their dependents. In addition, employees may register domestic partners as their eligible dependents under one of the health plans offered by BNA. The company also has both medical care and dependent care spending accounts that enable participants to pay for dependent care with pre-tax dollars.\n\nBNA indicates that it goes far beyond compliance with the provisions of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows employees to take up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption, or a serious medical condition. At BNA, a woman may take six to eight weeks of accumulated sick leave after the birth of a baby. In addition, male and female employees can take three weeks of accumulated sick leave called Parental Leave; and this is available to either parent during the first ninety days after birth or adoption. Employees also can be advanced sick leave, if a doctor designates a medical need, up to the amount of accumulated annual leave. They also can use all accumulated annual leave, three days of personal leave, and six months or more of leave without pay.\n\nBNA reports that it contributes $2,000 in adoption expenses when an employee adopts a child. It also has a transportation subsidy program that provides employees up to $600 a year to pay for the costs of coming to work.\n\nBNA indicates that it is committed to complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and makes every reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities, including employees, applicants, and visitors to their buildings.\n\nThe BNA-Guild Sabbaticals Committee receives and reviews applications for sabbaticals, interviews applicants for sabbaticals, and makes selections. The Committee may award two sabbaticals each year that run for a period of up to six months at full pay.\n\nTermination and Downsizing\n\nTo avoid layoffs that may result from current jobs becoming obsolete, BNA began a workforce planning initiative four years ago, which takes an early look at technological changes that would impact on the workforce, determines the skills and competencies that BNA employees will need, and provides the necessary training for the employees. Approximately two thirds of the more than 1,600 employees at BNA have at least five years of service. BNA attributes this to employee ownership and to the family-friendly policies and benefits.\n\nBNA has done very little downsizing. However, in those rare instances when reductions in force have occurred, the company has provided employees with the option of being placed on its rehire list for a two-year period, and almost all of those employees have found other jobs within BNA. As a result, the employees were able to maintain their years of service for the purpose of calculating pensions and other benefits.\n\nAlternative Dispute Resolution\n\nBNA has multiple avenues available to resolve discrimination complaints. Under the internal EEO complaint process, any person alleging a discriminatory or harassing practice may initiate a complaint and forward it to the EEO Office. Management is asked to respond to the complaint and the EEO Office conducts an investigation. Throughout the investigation, management and the complainant are kept informed of the status of the investigation. The complaint may be dismissed if the EEO Office's investigation indicates that it has no merit. The EEO Office will conduct and coordinate conciliation efforts by conferring with the parties in an attempt to secure a reasonable settlement of the dispute. If the complaint cannot be satisfactorily resolved, the Director of EEO will document the efforts made to resolve the complaint and provide a written explanation of the reasons to BNA's General Counsel.\n\nA second resource available to employees is the union. Employees, who are represented by the union, are free to seek the union for assistance in resolving work-related problems. The union contract provides represented employees with the right to file a grievance against a manager if the employee feels that the manager's actions are unfair and in violation of the provisions of the bargaining agreement.\n\nIn addition, employees who are not represented by the union are free to seek assistance and counsel from representatives in the Human Resources Department. BNA does not state or imply that any of its internal alternative dispute resolution mechanisms affect, limit, or modify employees' rights to pursue administrative or judicial relief outside the company.\n\nOther Policies, Programs, and Practices\n\nMany committees have been established in cooperation with the union that represents BNA employees - The Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild. Several of these committees have been mentioned above under the relevant topic. The joint BNA-Guild EEO Committee makes recommendations to the company with regard to recruitment, training, testing, and career development. One such recommendation was that BNA's senior management attend a workforce diversity training seminar. As a result, a training program was developed for all managers at BNA. Another recommendation was the development of the career management booklet. That was done, and the booklet focuses on careers within each department, explaining what is needed in terms of performance, technical skills, and education level. Subcommittees of the joint BNA-Guild EEO Committee established BNA's scholarship program.\n\nBNA employees also celebrate Black History Month, Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, Hispanic Heritage Month, National American Indian Heritage Month, and Bi/Gay/Lesbian Month with a variety of educational brown-bag lunchtime discussions and other activities.\n\nBrown-bag lunches to discuss diversity issues were started over five years ago by a group of BNA employees. These lunches give all BNA employees an opportunity to come together to informally discuss issues concerning diversity in the workplace and the community outside of BNA. These lunches resulted in the development of a community project for BNA employees. For two years, a rotating group of BNA employees participated in a program sponsored by So Others Might Eat (S.O.M.E.). Employees volunteered their lunch hours to serve lunch to the homeless at a local S.O.M.E. shelter.\n\nManagement Commitment and Accountability\n\nBNA indicates it is committed to achieving cultural diversity at all levels of the company. The president of BNA has issued formal policy statements on affirmative action and equal employment opportunity and on sexual harassment. The text of these statements appear in the BNA Handbook, and they also are posted on bulletin boards throughout the company. BNA states that its managers are held accountable for their EEO performance and are trained to understand and utilize the special strengths of a culturally diverse workforce. An important part of the orientation for new employees is a briefing by BNA's EEO Officer on the company's anti-discrimination and affirmative action policies and complaint procedures.\n\nBNA says that it is committed to being a leader in the fair treatment of all and in innovative programs to maximize the potential of all; and the company pledges to ensure the fairness of its promotional system. BNA further indicates that it makes a substantial effort to assure that equal opportunities exist for its employees and to recognize the needs of its diverse workforce. The diversity programs at BNA are not clustered under a diversity management banner, but they represent the company's recognition of the needs of its diverse workforce. According to BNA, some of the programs and policies are intended to specifically address issues of concern to minority employees. BNA suggests that other programs and policies focus more generally on career development and work-family matters, and thereby greatly benefit all employees, which is the intent of any initiative to manage diversity.\n\nPerson to Contact for More Information:\n\nAnthony A.
