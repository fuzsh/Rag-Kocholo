        "text": "1.1.1Authority and Purpose\n\nA.Pursuant to the federal Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. §§ 1451 through 1466) and R.I. Gen. Laws Chapter 46-23 the Coastal Resources Management Council is authorized to develop and adopt policies and regulations necessary to manage the coastal resources of the state and to provide for the integration and coordination of the protection of natural resources, the promotion of reasonable coastal-dependent economic growth, and the improved protection of life and property from coastal hazards. Further, the Council is authorized to collaborate with the state building commissioner and adopt freeboard calculations (a factor of added safety above the anticipated flood level) in accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws § 23-27.3-100.1.5.5.\n\nB.The regulations herein constitute the RICR regulatory component of the Coastal Resources Management Program Red Book and must be read in conjunction with the Red Book guidance document containing the findings and other non-regulatory components for the full and proper context that forms the basis and purpose of this Part. The Red Book guidance document should be employed in interpreting R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-23-1, et seq.\n\n1.1.2Definitions\n\nA.Definitions for this Part are as follows:\n\n1.“Activities and alterations inland of shoreline features and their contiguous areas within state boundaries that may require a Council Assent” means: solid waste disposal; minerals extraction; power generation over forty (40) megawatts; chemical and petroleum processing, transfer, and storage (excluding storage facilities of less than 2,400 barrel capacity); and sewage treatment and disposal (excluding onsite wastewater treatment systems) desalination plans, and activities affecting freshwater wetlands in the vicinity of the coast.\n\n2.\"Agency\" means boards, commissions, departments, or offices thereof, other than the legislature or the courts, authorized by law to make rules, determine contested cases, or issue permits.\n\n3.\"Agricultural\" means any activity as defined by R.I. Gen. Laws § 2-23-4.\n\n4.“Alteration of a marina” means any activity that result in changes to the existing or previously approved recreational boating facility design. Such activities include, but are not limited to, the removal, addition, or relocation of piles, floating docks or fixed piers and changes to the marina perimeter limit.\n\n5.“Alterations to coastal wetlands” means any alterations to the functions and values of wetlands including, but not limited to: filling, removing or grading; dredging and dredged materials disposal; and any significant cutting or removal of vegetation; and excavation, draining, damming and/or diverting of hydrological flows in a coastal wetland. Any activity, including the aforementioned, taking place in an area adjacent to a coastal wetland which impacts the coastal wetland, shall be considered an alteration to coastal wetlands.\n\n6.“Alterations to the circulation of tidal waters” means all structures and fill material that alter the behavior of waters within tidal water bodies, including the removal of tidal waters for industrial cooling or other purposes and the installation of structures in embayments and salt ponds that alter the volumes and/or timing of exchange with outlying tidal waters.\n\n7.“Alterations to the flows of tributaries” means the installation of dams or other devices or fill material that alter flows of tributaries to tidal waters and that significantly change the timing and/or volumes of fresh water to coastal waters.\n\n8.“Approved harbor management plan” or “HMP” means a plan that has been prepared by a municipality in accordance with the CRMC municipal harbor regulations and CRMC Guidelines for the Development of Municipal Harbor Management Plans, adopted by a city or town council, and approved by the Coastal Resources Management Council.\n\n9.“Approved waters” means marine waters of the state classified by RIDEM as approved areas fit for the taking of shellfish for human consumption on a regular basis according to criteria established by the National Shellfish Sanitation Program.\n\n10.\"Aquaculture\" (refer to definitions of \"marine aquaculture\" and \"freshwater aquaculture\" in § 1.1.2 of this Part herein.)\n\n11.\"Areas of historic and archaeological significance\" means those resources as defined by R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-22.2-4(12).\n\n12.“Associated residential structures” means, but is not limited to, decks, porches, walls, boardwalks, swimming pools, roads, driveways, and shall include other structures integral to or ancillary to a residential building including minor grading, filling or excavation typically 10 cubic yards or less.\n\n13.“Barrier” means an island or spit comprised of sand and/or gravel, extending parallel to the coast and separated from the mainland by a coastal pond, tidal water body, or coastal wetland. In addition to a beach, barriers have, in most cases, a frontal foredune zone and often, back barrier dune fields. The lateral limits of barriers are defined by the area where unconsolidated sand or gravel of the barrier abuts bedrock or glacial sediment. This definition of a barrier system is commonly associated with many geomorphic descriptors. These descriptors include, but are not limited to, barrier islands, bay barriers, and spits. Spits are further described as tombolo, shingle, cuspate, and flying spits. The terms “bar” and “ridge” were once used to describe a barrier system, but have since been replaced with the term “barrier”. The barriers or portions thereof designated by the federal government as undeveloped pursuant to their criteria, under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 (Public Law 97-348) are noted in Table 5 in § 1.2.2(C) of this Part. In these federally designated areas, flood insurance for most forms of construction is not available. Many of the state’s barriers have been mapped and assigned by the Coastal Resources Management Council into three categories as follows:\n\na.“Undeveloped barrier” means those essentially free of commercial/industrial buildings, (excluding public utility lines) houses, surfaced roads, and structural shoreline protection facilities.\n\nb.“Moderately developed barrier” means those that are essentially free of houses, commercial/ industrial buildings and/or facilities (excluding utility lines) that contain surfaced roads, recreational structures, and/or structural shoreline protection facilities.\n\nc.“Developed barriers” mean those that contain houses and/or commercial/industrial structures; they may also contain surfaced roads and structural shoreline protection facilities.\n\n14.“Beach grass” means the dominant vegetative cover of sand dunes (Ammophila spp.).\n\n15.“Beach pavilion” means a recreational structure constructed for recreational purposes on a shoreline feature, its contiguous area, or in tidal waters that serves members of the public, owned by a municipal, state, or federal program.\n\n16.“Boat” means any vessel or watercraft as defined by R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-12-1(1).\n\n17.“Boat and float lift systems” means accessory structures to residential boating facilities that raise either a boat or float out of the water. Generally, a cradle or strap supports the vessel or float while it is being lifted by a pulley-type lift system. Overhead arms or crane-like systems may also be used to lift vessels out of the water.\n\n18.“Boat or vessel count” means any space where a vessel may be docked or stored by wet slip, float, mooring or other device. Dry stack vessels will receive a separate boat count. Dinghies, canoes, kayaks and other small tenders (12’ or less) to vessels shall not be included in the boat count.\n\n19.“Breachway” means a connecting channel, usually between a coastal pond and the ocean, which permits water exchange between the two.\n\n20.“Breakwater” means either an exposed or submerged structure that protect a shore, harbor, anchorage, or basin by intercepting waves. Sometimes breakwaters are placed parallel to the open shoreline to retard the force of incoming waves to headland and barrier beaches.\n\n21.“Buffer zone” means a land area on or contiguous to a shoreline feature that is retained in its natural undisturbed condition.\n\n22.“Bulkhead” means a wood, steel, or concrete structure built to retain or prevent mass wasting and collapse of a bluff into the sea; it provides limited protection from damage by waves.\n\n23.“Certified verification agent” or “CVA” means an individual or organization, experienced in the design, fabrication, and installation of an energy related facility or structure, who will conduct specified third-party reviews, inspections, and verifications in accordance with this Part.\n\n24.“Climate” means the long-term weather average observed within a geographic region, and climate change refers to fluctuations in the Earth’s climate system as a result of both natural and anthropogenic causes. Currently the long term climate change trend is evidenced by rising global temperatures; increasing storm intensity extremes within the hydrologic cycle resulting in more frequent floods and droughts; and rising sea level.\n\n25.\"Coastal beaches\" means expanses of unconsolidated, usually unvegetated sediment commonly subject to wave action, but may also include a vegetative beach berm. Beaches extend from mean low water landward to an upland rise, usually the base of a dune, headland bluff, or coastal protection structure, pilings or foundation.\n\n26.“Coastal buffer zone” means a land area adjacent to a shoreline (coastal) feature that is, or will be, vegetated with native shoreline species and which acts as a natural transition zone between the coast and adjacent upland development. A coastal buffer zone differs from a construction setback in that the setback establishes a minimum distance between a shoreline feature and construction activities, while a buffer zone establishes a natural area adjacent to a shoreline feature that must be retained in, or restored to, a natural vegetative condition. The coastal buffer zone is generally contained within the established construction setback.\n\n27.“Coastal headlands, bluffs, and cliffs” means elevated land forms on headlands directly abutting coastal waters, a beach, coastal wetland, and rocky shore.\n\n28.“Coastal environment” means the complete system of living organisms and physical surroundings within the waters and shore lands of estuaries, the nearshore ocean and the terrestrial areas influenced by this system.\n\n29.\"Coastal pond\" means a coastal lagoon usually located behind a barrier which, in its natural condition, permanently or occasionally exchanges waters with the ocean.\n\n30.“Coastal wetland” means salt marshes and freshwater or brackish wetlands contiguous to salt marshes or physiographical features.

Touch and Go facilities shall limit berthing to a maximum of forty eight (48) hours.\n\n163.“Tributary” means any flowing body of water or watercourse which provides intermittent or perennial flow to tidal waters, coastal ponds, coastal wetlands or other down-gradient watercourses which eventually discharges to tidal waters, coastal ponds or coastal wetlands.\n\n164.“Tributary wetland” means freshwater wetlands that are connected via a watercourse to a coastal wetland and/or tidal waters.\n\n165.“Undue hardship” means an inappropriate, unsuitable, unlawful, or excessive standard or requirement levied upon an applicant. This does not include economic diminution in value.\n\n166.“Upweller” means a mechanical device to increase water flow for shellfish seed intended to accelerate their growth.\n\n167.“Vertical datum” means either a fixed benchmark such as NAVD 88 or a site specific tidal datum such as mean high water, mean low water and mean sea level. NGVD 29 is based on the local mean sea level in 1929, which has changed over time. NAVD 88 is the official civilian vertical datum for surveying and mapping activities in the United States. Tidal datum, such as mean sea level (MSL) or mean high water (MHW), vary according to the specific location, and represent the mean heights observed over the national tidal datum epoch.\n\n168.“Vessel” means every description of watercraft, other than a seaplane on water, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water and shall include barges and tugs. Specifically excluded by this definition are floating homes or houseboats.\n\n169.“Water-dependent” means activities and/or uses which can only be conducted on, in, over, or adjacent to tidal waters or coastal ponds because the use requires access to the water from transportation, recreation, energy production, or source of water and also includes non-water-dependent activities that provide access to the shore to broad segments of the public.\n\n170.“Water quality volume” or “WQv” means the storage needed to capture and treat ninety percent (90%) of the average annual stormwater runoff volume, and in Rhode Island this equates to one (1) inch of runoff from impervious surfaces.\n\n171.“Water use category/type” means one of six use designations assigned to Rhode Island coastal waters as part of this program.\n\n172.“Wetland restoration” means the re-establishment of a wetland (on the site of an historical wetland) which has been degraded to such an extent that the site performs little or none of its original wetland functions.\n\n173.“Wetland walkover structure” means a pile-supported structure no more than 30 inches wide that provides passage over a wetland. Any pile supported structure that does not meet the requirements of § 1.3.1(Q) of this Part or terminates in a wetland or in tidal or non-tidal waters is not a wetland walkover structure.\n\n174.“Widgeon grass” or “Ruppia maritima” means a rooted, submerged aquatic plant which is capable of both vegetative and sexual growth. Widgeon grass exists primarily in saline and brackish waters, salt ponds and pools within salt marshes, and inland saline waters.\n\n175.“Wild stock” means existing natural resources, including aquatic (freshwater and marine) animals or plants, which grow within the waters of the state.\n\n1.1.3Requirements for Applicants\n\nA.Step one - Is a Council assent required?\n\n1.All developments or operations within, above or beneath the tidal waters below the mean high water mark extending out to the extent of the state’s jurisdiction in the territorial sea, and those occurring on coastal features or within all directly associated contiguous areas which are necessary to preserve the integrity of coastal resources, or any portion of which extends onto the most inland shoreline feature or its two hundred (200) foot contiguous area, or as otherwise set out in the Coastal Resources Management Program, require a Council Assent.\n\n2.Persons proposing the following activities any portion of which extends onto the most inland shoreline feature or its two hundred (200) foot contiguous area are required to apply for a Council Assent: subdivisions, cooperatives, or other multi-ownership facilities [of six (6) units or more], or facilities requiring or creating forty thousand (40,000) sq. ft. or more of parking.\n\n3.Persons proposing the following activities within critical coastal areas, which include the watersheds of poorly flushed areas delineated on maps accompanying this program, are required to apply for a Council Assent: subdivisions, cooperatives, and other multi-ownership facilities [of six (6) units or more]; any structure serviced by an on-site sewage disposal system servicing two thousand (2,000) gallons or more per day; any activity which results in the creation of forty thousand (40,000) sq. ft. or more of impervious surface; construction or extension of municipal or industrial sewage facilities or systems (not connections to individual homes); construction or extension of water distribution systems or supply lines (not connections to individual homes).\n\n4.Persons proposing selected inland activities anywhere in the state that may require a Council Assent shall request a review of the project to determine whether impacts on the environment of the coastal region are likely and, therefore, whether a Council Assent will be required. These selected inland activities are:\n\na.Power generating over forty (40) megawatts;\n\nb.Chemical or petroleum processing, transfer or storage;\n\nc.Minerals extraction;\n\nd.Sewage treatment and disposal and solid waste disposal facilities; and\n\ne.Desalination plants.\n\n5.Persons proposing any project or activity which may alter the character of any freshwater wetland in the vicinity of the coast, and which is not specifically exempt under the Rules and Regulations for the Protection and Management of Freshwater Wetlands in the Vicinity of the Coast (Part 2 of this Subchapter) or as provided in R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-23-6(2)(iv), are required to apply for a Council Assent. When it is not clear as to whether or not freshwater wetlands exist in the area of any proposed activity, or whether the proposed activity requires a Council Assent, persons should consult with the Council prior to undertaking any activity.\n\nB.Step two - Where Is the activity or alteration being proposed?\n\n1.Locate the area where an activity or alteration is proposed on the maps that accompany this Program. Then note the water use category (if an on land activity is proposed, the adjoining water use category). If the shoreline is designated a critical erosion area, note the average annual erosion rate. In these areas, non-water dependent structures must be set back a distance equivalent to thirty (30) times the annual erosion rate (see § 1.1.9 of this Part). The prerequisites, standards, and Category B requirements for on land activities listed in §§ 1.3.1(A) through 1.3.1(R) and in §§ 1.3.5 and 1.3.6 of this Part apply to both shoreline features and their two hundred (200) foot contiguous area.\n\n2.Identify the shoreline features that may be affected. The maps give some indication of the shoreline features that may be involved, but this must be verified by inspecting the site. The definitions of shoreline features in § 1.1.2 of this Part will further assist you in identifying what shoreline features are present.\n\n3.If the proposed activity or alteration is not located in Rhode Island's coastal waters, on or within the two hundred (200) foot contiguous area, or a statewide activity listed in § 1.3.3 of this Part, determine if it is located within a critical coastal area. If the proposed alteration or activity is listed in § 1.3.4 of this Part, then you will need to apply for a Council Assent.\n\n4.If the proposed project or activity may alter the character of any freshwater wetland in the vicinity of the coast and is not specifically exempt, then you will need to apply for a Council Assent.\n\nC.Step three - What regulations apply?\n\n1.The prerequisites, policies, and standards in this Program are regulations that must be met by all persons who undertake alterations and activities under the Council's jurisdiction.\n\n2.If the alteration proposed is for tidal waters or for a shoreline feature, turn to Table 1 in § 1.1.5 of this Part and match the activity with the water area and shoreline type. The table will tell you if the activity you propose is prohibited or will be processed as a Category A or Category B application. Table 2 in § 1.1.5 of this Part lists the review categories for activities proposed in the two hundred (200) foot area contiguous to shoreline features.\n\n3.If the proposed alteration is within a critical coastal area, consult the appropriate CRMC Special Area Management Plan for supplemental policies, standards, and requirements. Table 3 in § 1.1.5 of this Part lists the review categories for inland activities subject to the requirements of § 1.3.3 or § 1.3.4 of this Part.\n\n4.If the proposed project or activity is located within any freshwater wetland in the vicinity of the coast, the area of land within fifty feet (50') or on a riverbank, then the CRMC Rules and Regulations for the Protection and Management of Freshwater Wetlands in the Vicinity of the Coast (Part 2 of this Subchapter) shall apply.\n\n5.The applicant is required to obtain all other necessary municipal, state and federal permits, except where preempted by federal regulations. The Council may, however, waive the requirement for obtaining other permits as a prerequisite to issuing an assent pursuant to 10-00-1.4.2(G) of this Title.\n\nD.Category A applications\n\n1.Review the policies in § 1.2 of this Part for the water use and shoreline categories your proposal may affect. These may set limits on what may be permitted or provide guidance on how the work should by undertaken.\n\n2.Turn to the appropriate section in § 1.3 of this Part and; note any prerequisites that you must meet before filing for a Council Assent; and review all standards. When filing a Category A application you must commit yourself to upholding all applicable standards. If you cannot meet one or more standards, you must apply for a variance (§ 1.1.7 of this Part), if applicable.\n\n3.File your application. If the activity you propose is not starred (*) on Table 1 in § 1.1.5 of this Part and you meet all applicable standards, and if all information requirements have been verified by the Council's staff, review of the application will begin. If grounds for a substantive objection (see § 1.1.6(H) of this Part) exist on the proposed site (for example, the presence of rare or endangered species or severe building constraints), a Council member or the Council's staff will recommend review by the full Council, and the application will be put out to public notice.\n\n4.If the activity you propose is starred (*), public notice will be given of your proposal; abutters to the affected property and local and state officials will be notified of your proposal. If one (1) or more substantive objections (see § 1.1.6(H) of this Part) are filed within the thirty (30) day notice period, a public hearing on your proposal will be scheduled and a Council subcommittee appointed to hear the objections, review your application, and recommend action to the full Council.\n\nE.Category B applications\n\n1.Complete steps 1 and 2 above (§§ 1.1.3(A) and (B) of this Part) as for a Category A Assent.\n\n2.Prepare in writing an environmental assessment of your proposal. This must address all items listed in § 1.3.1(A) of this Part and any additional requirements for Category B applications listed for the activity in question in the appropriate sections of § 1.3 of this Part. The amount of detail appropriate for each topic will vary depending on the magnitude of the project and the likely impacts. If, in your opinion, some issues do not apply, simply note: \"Does not apply.\"\n\n3.All Category B applications are put out to public notice. A public hearing will be scheduled if one or more substantive objections are filed within the thirty (30) day notice period. A Council subcommittee will review your proposal, the comments prepared by its staff, and all other pertinent materials, and will recommend action to the full Council. If your proposal is uncontested, you may expect Council action within thirty (30) working days of verification by the Council's staff that all informational requirements have been met. The Council shall base its decision on consideration of how your proposal conforms to goals for the shoreline features and water use categories affected, other relevant policies, and the significance of the likely impacts of your proposal on the environment of the coastal region.\n\n1.1.4Alterations and Activities That Require an Assent from the Coastal Resources Management Council\n\nA.Tidal waters, shoreline features, and contiguous areas\n\n1.A Council assent is required for any alteration or activity that are proposed for:\n\na.Tidal waters within the territorial seas (including coastal ponds, some of which are not tidal but which are coastal waters associated with a barrier beach system, and are physiographical features);\n\nb.Shoreline features; and\n\nc.Areas contiguous to shoreline features.\n\n(1)Contiguous areas include all lands and waters directly adjoining shoreline features that extend inland two hundred (200) feet from the inland border of that shoreline feature. A Council Assent is required for any alteration or activity any portion of which extends onto the most inland shoreline feature or its two hundred (200) foot contiguous area. Representative activities are listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of § 1.1.5 of this Part. Any alteration or activities as defined in § 1.1.5 of this Part must have an assent card posted and have a copy of the assent available at the site where the intended activity or alteration is to take place. Failure to post assent card and/or have a copy of the assent available constitutes a violation under this program.\n\n2.Council Assents are also required for any other activity or alteration not listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of § 1.1.5 of this Part, but which has a reasonable probability of conflicting with the Council's goals and its management plans or programs, and/or has the potential to damage the environment of the coastal region.\n\n3.Tidal waters and coastal ponds have been assigned to one of six use categories. Findings, goals, and policies pertaining to each water use category are found in § 1.2 of this Part. High resolution, large scale maps showing the use categories are available on the CRMC website at: for each coastal community. The precise delineation of the seaward boundaries of the state's territorial sea must be clarified through special state legislation. Until that time, the Council shall use as a guideline the boundaries shown in Figure 1 of § 1.1.5(D) of this Part. The land-ward boundary of the territorial sea is the mean high water mark along the Rhode Island coast.\n\n4.Shoreline features together encompass the entire shore and are assigned to the following categories:\n\na.Coastal beaches and dunes;\n\nb.Barrier beaches;\n\nc.Coastal wetlands;\n\nd.Coastal cliffs, bluffs, and banks;\n\ne.Rocky shores;\n\nf.Manmade shorelines; and\n\ng.Dunes.\n\n5.The prerequisites, standards, and Category B requirements for on land activities listed in §§ 1.3.1(A) through 1.3.1(R) and in §§ 1.3.5 and 1.3.6 of this Part apply to shoreline features, their 200-foot contiguous area, and inland activities subject to §§ 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 of this Part.\n\nB.Inland of shoreline features and contiguous areas\n\n1.The Council reserves the right to review the following categories of alterations and activities proposed inland of shoreline features and their contiguous areas pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-23-6:\n\na.Power generating plants over 40 megawatts capacity;\n\nb.Chemical or petroleum processing, transfer, or storage facilities (excluding those of less than a 2,400-barrel capacity);\n\nc.Freshwater wetlands in the vicinity of the coast;\n\nd.Minerals extraction;\n\ne.Sewage treatment and disposal facilities (excluding onsite wastewater treatment systems);\n\nf.Solid waste disposal facilities; and,\n\ng.Desalination plants.\n\n2.Where, on the basis of a review, it is found that a proposal has a reasonable probability of conflict with adopted resources management plans or programs, and/or has the potential to damage the coastal environment the Council shall require that an Assent be obtained. Inland activities and alterations that may be subject to Council permitting are defined, and Council findings, goals, policies, and regulations are set forth in § 1.3.3 of this Part.\n\nC.Critical coastal areas\n\n1.Watersheds of poorly flushed estuaries: The Council reserves the right to review any activity proposed within the watersheds of poorly flushed estuaries and critical coastal areas. Therefore the Council has developed and adopted Special Area Management Plans in order to address the specific environmental concerns of those priority management areas. In addition to those activities captured under the Council's management program, activities within the Salt Pond Region and Narrow River Special Area Management Plans (SAMP) (as delineated on the maps accompanying each SAMP) that have a reasonable probability of conflicting with the goals of this plan must submit an application for an assent. These activities are:\n\na.Subdivisions, cooperatives, and other multi-ownership facilities [of six (6) units or more];\n\nb.Any structure serviced by an on-site sewage disposal system servicing two thousand (2,000) gallons or more per day;\n\nc.Any activity which results in the creation of forty thousand (40,000) sq. ft. or more of impervious surface;\n\nd.Construction or extension of municipal or industrial sewage facilities or systems (not connections to individual homes); and,\n\ne.Water distribution systems or extensions of supply lines (not connections to individual homes).\n\nf.All roadway construction and upgrading projects; and\n\ng.Development affecting freshwater wetlands in the vicinity of the coast.\n\n2.Applicants proposing one or more of these activities shall apply to the Council. For more detailed mapping of the poorly flushed estuaries and their adjacent land use areas, as well as policies and recommendations pertaining to these areas, please see the appropriate Special Area Management Plan.\n\nD.Freshwater wetlands in the vicinity of the coast\n\n1.Applicability\n\na.A Council Assent is required for any project or activity which may alter the character of any freshwater wetland in the vicinity of the coast. Applicants are referred to the CRMC’s Rules and Regulations for the Protection and Management of Freshwater Wetlands in the Vicinity of the Coast (Part 2 of this Subchapter) (i.e., the Rules) for specific programmatic requirements.\n\nb.The Rules apply to all freshwater wetlands within the Council’s jurisdiction, the jurisdictional resource areas which are area(s) of land within fifty feet (50’), riverbanks, and flood plains, and, all activities which could alter the character of any freshwater wetland or part thereof in the vicinity of the coast.\n\nc.The authority of the CRMC to apply the Rules to freshwater wetlands in the vicinity of the coast, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains, is that which is necessary to carry out the effective management of the resource.\n\nd.Projects or activities subject to the CRMC’s jurisdiction due to the nature of the activity, its proximity to any coastal feature, or its location within the boundaries of the Narrow River or Salt Ponds watersheds (as defined in the Narrow River and Salt Ponds Special Area Management Plans (SAMP)), and the proposed project is also subject to these Rules, the CRMC shall apply the provisions of the RICRMP and any applicable SAMP in addition to these Rules. Where these separate regulatory programs may conflict, the more stringent definition, policy, standard and/or prohibition shall apply.\n\n2.Policies\n\na.It is the policy of the Council to prohibit the alteration, filling, removing or grading of any tributary or tributary wetland. In all cases the precise boundary of the freshwater wetland shall be determined through a field inspection and verification by CRMC staff.\n\nb.The Council’s Rules and Regulations for the Protection and Management of Freshwater Wetlands in the Vicinity of the Coast (Part 2 of this Subchapter), are incorporated herein and the following constitute the functions and values of freshwater wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains:\n\n(1)Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat: Freshwater wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains are important areas for the production and diversity of wildlife. Wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains provide habitat for individual species and communities of animals and plants. Animals include both game and non-game species, which may be either obligate or facultative, and which may be permanent residents, seasonal or transient in nature. Wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains serve as travel corridors, nesting sites, feeding sites, resting sites, nursery and/or brood rearing sites, escape cover, and seasonal breeding, migration, and over-wintering habitat for wildlife. Wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains provide critical habitat for some plant and animal species, and provide habitat for rare animal and rare plant species.\n\n(2)Recreation and Aesthetics: Freshwater wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains provide and potentially provide a variety of important active and passive recreational and aesthetic values to the general populace. Such active and passive recreational values include, but are not limited to activities such as; hunting, fishing, trapping, cross-country skiing, ice skating, boating, waterskiing, canoeing, camping, swimming, bicycling, hiking/walking, horseback riding, harvesting of natural foods or plant materials, bird watching, education and nature studies or other animal observations and photography. Aesthetic values include, but are not limited to, the wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains visual, aural and cultural qualities such as its prominence as a distinct feature in the local area, including its prominence as open space; whether the wetland, area of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbank, or flood plain is a rare type; whether the wetland, area of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbank, or flood plain actually maintains or provides suitable habitat for any rare animal or rare plant species; whether the wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains has any outstanding or uncommon geomorphologic features; and whether the wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains contains archaeological evidence or historic significance.\n\n(3)Flood Protection: Freshwater wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains protect life and/or property from flooding and flood flows by storing, retaining, metering out, and otherwise controlling flood waters from storm events. Further, wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains control the damaging effects of flood flows by dissipating erosive forces, providing frictional resistance to flood flows, and providing shoreline anchoring values.\n\n(4)Surface Water and Groundwater: Freshwater wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains provide and/or maintain surface and/or groundwater supplies by acting as a recharge or discharge area, or in the case of some ponds, acting as surface water reservoirs. While groundwater recharge and discharge functions and values may vary seasonally, a freshwater wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains may, either individually or cumulatively, be an important factor in replenishing ground and surface water supplies, maintaining stream flows, transporting surface waters, and storing or metering out surface waters and/or groundwater during seasons or periods of droughts.\n\n(5)Water Quality: Freshwater wetlands, area(s) of land within fifty (50) feet, riverbanks, and flood plains protect and/or maintain important water quality functions and values by nutrient retention or removal; pollution filtration; sediment removal; oxygen production; turbidity reduction; maintenance or modification of stream flow; temperature and oxygen regimes in both flowing and surface water bodies, and providing and maintaining safe drinking water supplies.\n\nc.The functions and values of freshwater wetlands in the vicinity of the coast further the goals and objectives of the Council’s management programs for the protection and management of coastal resources.\n\n3.Prerequisites\n\na.A water quality certificate from the Department of Environmental Management shall be a prerequisite for any application to alter freshwater wetlands pursuant to the Council’s Rules and Regulations for the Protection and Management of Freshwater Wetlands in the Vicinity of the Coast (Part 2 of this Subchapter).\n\n4.Prohibitions\n\na.Filling, removing, or grading (§ 1.3.1(B) of this Part) is prohibited on any tributary or tributary wetland. Any activity not prohibited herein shall be evaluated against the Council’s Rules and Regulations for the Protection and Management of Freshwater Wetlands in the Vicinity of the Coast (Part 2 of this Subchapter). However, the following exceptions may be permitted by the Council:\n\n(1)The fifty (50) foot wetland perimeter and river bank wetland areas outside the wetland “edge” (RIFWWA, R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 2-1-20(d) and (g)) shall not be considered part of the wetland under this section.\n\n(2)Filling, removing, or grading of freshwater wetlands, excluding areas regulated as coastal wetlands (§ 1.2.2(C) of this Part) may receive relief from this prohibition in instances where filling is required to access otherwise buildable land and when no other reasonable alternatives for access exist and when the applicant has satisfied the variance burdens of proof set forth in § 1.1.7 of this Part. Buildable land shall be defined as a land area which satisfies all federal, state, and municipal requirements for the intended development. To be defined as buildable land, the intended development must also satisfy the requirements in applicable Special Area Management Plans and meet all of the Department of Environmental Management’s regulations and requirements for OWTS in “Critical Resource Areas.” In cases where the Council approves filling of a freshwater wetland in order to access otherwise buildable land, the applicant shall be subject to the following requirements:\n\n(AA)The applicant shall be required to mitigate the area of wetland lost on a 2 to 1 (2:1) area basis;\n\n(BB)The wetland that is replaced shall be consistent with that which was filled;\n\n(CC)The mitigation, when feasible, shall take place on-site and in an area which is hydrologically connected to the impacted wetland. When not feasible the Council shall consider other viable alternatives, including increased mitigation ratios;\n\n(DD)Setback and buffer requirements shall be required for the wetland replacement area;\n\n(EE)Enhancement of existing wetland shall not be an acceptable form of mitigation under this section;\n\n(FF)When applicable, all wetland replacement projects will require the approval of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, Division of Freshwater Wetlands; and,\n\n(GG)When applicable, the applicant shall concurrently submit applications to the RIDEM and to the CRMC so that a concurrent review of the proposed activities can occur.\n\n1.1.5Review Categories and Prohibited Activities in Tidal Waters and on Adjacent Shoreline Features\n\nA.Table 1: Water type matrices\n\nB.Table 2: Review categories in the two hundred (200) foot area contiguous to shoreline features\n\nC.Table 3: Review Categories for Inland Activities (§§ 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 of this Part)\n\nD.Figure 1: Rhode Island's territorial sea and 2011 geographic location description (GLD) boundary.\n\n‎\n\n1.1.6Applications for Category A and Category B Council Assents\n\nA.The regulations contained herein are regulations that must be met by all persons who undertake alterations and activities under the Council’s jurisdiction.\n\nB.Through the adoption and implementation of the Marine Resources Development Plan by the Council on January 10, 2006, permit applications which meet the thresholds below in § 1.1.6(C) of this Part, have received no objections, and are consistent with the goals and policies of the coastal resources management program will be reviewed and acted upon administratively by the executive director or his/her designee not less than twenty (20) calendar days after the staff report(s) is/are completed and placed in the public file.

A public hearing will be scheduled if there are one or more substantive objections to the project, or at the consensus of four (4) or more members of the Council.\n\n3.A Category B Assent shall be issued if the Council finds that the proposed alteration conforms to the goals, policies, prerequisites, informational requirements and standards of this Program.\n\nG.Substantive objections\n\n1.Substantive objections are defined by one or more of the following:\n\na.Threat of direct loss of property of the objector(s) at the site in question;\n\nb.Direct evidence that the proposed alteration or activity does not meet all of the policies, prerequisites, and standards contained in applicable sections of this document;\n\nc.Evidence is presented which demonstrates that the proposed activity or alteration has a potential for significant adverse impacts on one or more of the following descriptors of the coastal environment:\n\n(1)Circulation and/or flushing patterns;\n\n(2)Sediment deposition and erosion;\n\n(3)Biological communities, including vegetation, shellfish and finfish resources, and wildlife habitat;\n\n(4)Areas of historic and archaeological significance;\n\n(5)Scenic and/or recreation values;\n\n(6)Water quality;\n\n(7)Public access to and along the shore;\n\n(8)Shoreline erosion and flood hazards; or\n\nd.Evidence that the proposed activity or alteration does not conform to state or duly adopted municipal development plans, ordinances, or regulations.\n\nH.Findings of no significant impact\n\n1.Certain construction and alteration activities within two hundred (200) feet of a coastal feature frequently are found to pose little impact or threat to coastal resources and therefore do not warrant full CRMC staff review. These activities are often associated with existing residential, commercial, and/or industrial sites or previously assented structures or activities and include, but are not limited to, interior renovations, construction of attached decks, dormers, porches, second story additions, roofing, siding or window and door alterations, installation of detached tool sheds, flag poles, fences along property bounds located landward of the coastal feature and certain types of landscaping work.\n\n2.These associated structures and activities, depending on the extent of alteration and proximity to the coastal feature, may, on a case by case basis, and after preliminary review of the proposed activity or upon staff recommendation, be determined by the Council's Executive Director or Deputy Director as having an insignificant threat to coastal resources. In such cases, an application for a finding of no significant impact to undertake the proposed activity will be required. The property owner will receive a letter from the Executive Director or Deputy Director informing him/her of the determination, the limits of authorized work, and a time frame within which the work is to be completed. This letter must be kept on-site and available for inspection by appropriate CRMC officials.\n\nI.Coastal hazard analysis application requirements\n\n1.The following new projects when subject to the jurisdiction of the CRMC must file a coastal hazard analysis with their CRMC application using the “CRMC Coastal Hazard Application Guidance” provided in Chapter 5 of the CRMC Shoreline Change Special Area Management Plan (Beach SAMP):\n\na.Construction of new residential buildings as defined in § 1.1.2 of this Part;\n\nb.Construction of new commercial and industrial structures as defined in § 1.1.2 of this Part;\n\nc.Construction of new beach pavilions as defined in § 1.1.2 of this Part;\n\nd.Construction of any new private or public roadway, regardless of length;\n\ne.Construction of any new infrastructure project subject to §§ 1.3.1(F), (H), and (M) of this Part; and\n\nf.Construction of any new subdivisions with six (6) or more lots, any portion of which is within two hundred (200) feet of a shoreline feature.\n\n2.The following modifications to existing projects subject to the jurisdiction of the CRMC must file a coastal hazard analysis with their CRMC application using the “CRMC Coastal Hazard Application Guidance” provided in Chapter 5 of the CRMC Shoreline Change Special Area Management Plan (Beach SAMP):\n\na.Any expansion of existing commercial structures over tidal waters;\n\nb.Any expansion greater than six hundred (600) square feet to existing residential, commercial, industrial or beach pavilion structures;\n\nc.Second story additions greater than six hundred (600) square feet to any existing residential, commercial, industrial or beach pavilion structures; and\n\nd.Any expansion, including second story additions and decks, to existing residential, commercial, industrial or beach pavilion structures when such structures are located within the CRMC minimum setback specified by § 1.1.9 of this Part.\n\n3.All projects meeting the analysis thresholds established in §§ 1.1.6(I)(1) and (2) of this Part above shall complete the CRMC coastal hazard application worksheet () and provide the following information as part of the application:\n\na.Identify the project design life (20, 30 50 years, etc.), which is the period of time during which a structure is expected by its designers to be functional within its specified parameters; in other words, the life expectancy of the structure before failure. This period of time is used to establish the appropriate sea level rise (SLR) scenario for analysis;\n\nb.Using Table 1 in Chapter 5 of the Beach SAMP that is based upon the NOAA sea level rise high curve as adopted by the CRMC in § 1.1.10 of this Part determine the SLR projection at the end of the project design life; and\n\nc.Assess the exposure and potential risk from coastal hazards at the project site based upon:\n\n(1)Sea level rise;\n\n(2)Shoreline erosion;\n\n(3)Base flood elevation (BFE) from FEMA flood insurance rate map; and\n\n(4)STORMTOOLS design elevation.\n\n4.All projects meeting the analysis thresholds established in §§ 1.1.6(I)(1) and (2) of this Part above shall provide site plans of the proposed project with the following overlays:\n\na.Sea level rise analysis showing the corresponding proposed project design life SLR scenario (maximum of 9.61 feet for NOAA high curve by 2100). Applicants should consider evaluating the coastal hazards risk associated with frequent storm events (1, 3 or 10-year storms) combined with minimal sea level rise of 1-2 feet to account for extreme high tide events which can occur any year during the expected project design life;\n\nb.One hundred (100) yr return storm event and the One hundred (100) yr storm event with the corresponding design life SLR scenario;\n\nc.projected erosion rate for structure design life at the project site using the appropriate CRMC shoreline change map; and\n\nd.Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) for 1, 3 and 5 feet SLR scenarios for large projects and subdivisions only.\n\n5.All projects meeting the analysis thresholds established in §§ 1.1.6(I)(1) and (2) of this Part above shall describe the proposed coastal adaptation techniques incorporated into the project design to overcome or accommodate any coastal hazard exposure risks resulting from the analyses required by § 1.1.6(I) of this Part.\n\n1.1.7Variances\n\nA.Applicants requiring a variance from a standard shall make such request in writing and address the six (6) criteria listed below in writing. The application shall only be granted a variance if the Council finds that the following six (6) criteria are met.\n\n1.The proposed alteration conforms with applicable goals and policies of the Coastal Resources Management Program.\n\n2.The proposed alteration will not result in significant adverse environmental impacts or use conflicts, including but not limited to, taking into account cumulative impacts.\n\n3.Due to conditions at the site in question, the applicable standard(s) cannot be met.\n\n4.The modification requested by the applicant is the minimum variance to the applicable standard(s) necessary to allow a reasonable alteration or use of the site.\n\n5.The requested variance to the applicable standard(s) is not due to any prior action of the applicant or the applicant’s predecessors in title. With respect to subdivisions, the Council will consider the factors as set forth in § 1.1.7(B) of this Part below in determining the prior action of the applicant.\n\n6.Due to the conditions of the site in question, the standard(s) will cause the applicant an undue hardship. In order to receive relief from an undue hardship an applicant must demonstrate inter alia the nature of the hardship and that the hardship is shown to be unique or particular to the site. Mere economic diminution, economic advantage, or inconvenience does not constitute a showing of undue hardship that will support the granting of a variance.\n\nB.In reviewing requests for buffer zone variances for subdivisions of five (5) lots or less, the Council will review on a case-by-case basis the extent to which the prior action of the applicant or its predecessor in title created or caused the need for a variance, whether the applicant has created the need for a variance by the subdivision and whether the subdivision complies with local zoning requirements.\n\nC.Relief from a standard does not remove the applicant's responsibility to comply with all other Program requirements.\n\nD.Prior to requesting approval for a CRMC variance, in those instances where a variance would be obviated if a variance for a setback were acquired from the local municipality, the applicant must first exhaust his remedies before the local municipality.\n\n1.1.8Special Exceptions\n\nA.Special exceptions may be granted to prohibited activities to permit alterations and activities that do not conform to a Council goal for the areas affected or which would otherwise be prohibited by the requirements of this document only if and when the applicant has demonstrated that:\n\n1.The proposed activity serves a compelling public purpose which provides benefits to the public as a whole as opposed to individual or private interests. The activity must be one or more of the following:\n\na.An activity associated with public infrastructure such as utility, energy, communications, transportation facilities, however, this exception shall not apply to activities proposed on all classes of barriers, barrier islands or spits except as provided in § 1.2.2(C)(4)(i) of this Part;\n\nb.A water-dependent activity or use that generates substantial economic gain to the state; and/or\n\nc.An activity that provides access to the shore for broad segments of the public.\n\n2.All reasonable steps shall be taken to minimize environmental impacts and/or use conflict.\n\n3.There is no reasonable alternative means of, or location for, serving the compelling public purpose cited.\n\nB.Special exceptions may be granted only after proper notice in accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws Chapter 42-35, the Administrative Procedures Act, a public hearing has been held, and the record of that hearing has been considered by the full Council. The Council shall issue a written decision including findings of fact and conclusions upon which the decision to issue a special exception is based.\n\nC.In granting a special exception, the Council shall apply conditions as necessary to promote the objectives of the Program. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, provisions for:\n\n1.Minimizing adverse impacts of the alteration upon other areas and activities by stipulating the type, intensity, and performance of activities, and the hours of use and operation;\n\n2.Controlling the sequence of development, including when it must be commenced and completed;\n\n3.Controlling the duration of use or development and the time within which any temporary structure must be removed;\n\n4.Assuring satisfactory installation and maintenance of required public improvements;\n\n5.Designating the exact location and nature of development; and\n\n6.Establishing detailed records by submission of drawings, maps, plots, or specifications.\n\n1.1.9Setbacks\n\nA.A setback is the minimum distance from the inland boundary of a coastal feature at which an approved activity or alteration may take place.\n\nB.Setbacks shall be maintained in areas contiguous to coastal beaches, coastal wetlands, coastal cliffs and banks, rocky shores, and existing manmade shorelines, and apply to the following categories of activities and alterations:\n\n1.Filling, removal, or grading, except when part of an approved alteration involving a water dependent use or activity or structure (see § 1.3.1(B) of this Part);\n\n2.Residential buildings and garages excluding associated structures (see § 1.1.6(H) of this Part);\n\n3.New individual sewage disposal systems, sewage treatment plants, and associated sewer facilities excluding outfalls (See § 1.3.1(F) of this Part). Repairs and replacements of existing (permitted) individual sewage disposal systems shall be exempt from the Council's setback requirements;\n\n4.Industrial structures, commercial structures, and public recreation structures that are not water dependent (See § 1.3.1(C) of this Part); and\n\n5.Transportation facilities that are not water dependent (see § 1.3.1(M) of this Part).\n\n6.Any structure as specified in § 1.3.1(G)(1)(e) of this Part.\n\nC.Setbacks will be determined using the rates of change as found on the accompanying Shoreline Change Maps for Watch Hill to the Easternmost Point of Quicksand Beach (Little Compton) abutting Massachusetts. The minimum distance of a setback shall be not less than 30 times the calculated average annual erosion rate for less than four (4) dwelling units and not less than sixty (60) times the calculated average annual erosion rate for commercial, industrial or dwellings of more than four (4) units. At a minimum however, setbacks shall extend either fifty (50) feet from the inland boundary of the coastal feature or twenty-five (25) feet inland of the edge of a Coastal Buffer Zone, whichever is further landward. Due to site conditions over time, field verification of a coastal feature or coastal buffer zone may result in a setback determination different than that calculated using a shoreline change rate.\n\nD.Where the applicant demolishes a structure, any contemporary or subsequent application to rebuild shall meet applicable setback requirements.\n\nE.Applicants for alterations and activities who cannot meet the minimum setback standards may apply to the Council for a variance (see § 1.1.7 of this Part).\n\nF.The setback provisions do not apply to minor modifications or restoration of structures that conform with all other policies and standards of this program.\n\n1.1.10Climate Change and Sea Level Rise\n\nA.Policies\n\n1.The Council will review its policies, plans and regulations to proactively plan for and adapt to climate change and sea level rise. The Council will integrate climate change and sea level rise scenarios into its programs to prepare Rhode Island for these new, evolving conditions and make our coastal areas more resilient.\n\n2.The Council’s sea level rise policies are based upon the CRMC’s legislative mandate to preserve, protect, and where possible, restore the coastal resources of the state through comprehensive and coordinated long-range planning.\n\n3.The Council recognizes that sea level rise is ongoing and its foremost concern is the accelerated rate of rise and the associated risks to Rhode Island coastal areas today and in the future. The Council recognizes that the lower the sea level rise estimate used, the greater the risk that policies and efforts to adapt sea level rise and climate change will prove to be inadequate. Therefore, the policies of the Council may take into account different risk tolerances for differing types of public and private coastal activities. In addition, the Council will regularly review new scientific evidence regarding sea level change.\n\n4.The Council relies upon the most recent NOAA sea level rise data to address both short and long term planning horizons and the design life considerations for public and private infrastructure. The Council’s policy is to adopt and use the most recent sea level change scenarios published by NOAA (currently Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 083 (2017)), and the NOAA sea level rise change curves for Newport and Providence as provided in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers online sea level rise calculator tool available at: http://corpsclimate.us/ccaceslcurves.cfm. The Council requires the use of the NOAA High scenario curve for projecting sea level rise for future conditions. In addition, the Council adopts and recommends use of the STORMTOOLS online mapping tool developed on behalf of the CRMC by the University of Rhode Island Ocean Engineering program to evaluate the flood extent and inundation from sea level rise and storm surge.\n\n1.1.11Coastal Buffer Zones\n\nA.Prerequisites\n\n1.All applications for which § 1.1.11 of this Part applies shall be initially reviewed by the Executive Director or his designee. The Executive Director may grant a variance for such applications in accordance with this section, or refer any application to the Council for a hearing if based upon the application a determination is made that the proposed activity warrants a Council hearing.\n\nB.Policies\n\n1.Coastal buffer zones provide multiple uses and multiple benefits to those areas where they are applied (Desbonnet et al 1993). The multiple uses and benefits of coastal buffer zones include:\n\na.Protection of water quality: Buffer zones along the perimeter of coastal water bodies can be effective in trapping sediments, pollutants (including oil, detergents, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, wood preservatives and other domestic chemicals), and absorbing nutrients (particularly nitrogen) from surface water runoff and groundwater flow. The effectiveness of vegetated buffers as a best management practice for the control of nonpoint source runoff is dependent upon their ability to reduce the velocity of runoff flow to allow for the "
