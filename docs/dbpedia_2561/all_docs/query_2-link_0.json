        "text": "Down Peninsula Audio was founded in 2002 to document Michigan-based musicians. Our activity has occasionally waned over the years, yet the DPA logo always seems to sporadically rematerialize on new records and releases. 2020 will see a kind of revival for the label, with releases by KIND BEAST, Patois, and the Spirochete Session, as well cataloging the work of now-defunct artists who were kindred to the DPA ethos."
