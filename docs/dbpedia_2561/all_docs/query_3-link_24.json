        "text": "Frogs and toads are amphibians. Amphibians usually lay unshelled eggs in water or moist places, and most species have a gilled larval stage that changes into a lung-breathing adult. Amphibians depend on the outside environment for body heat because they do not produce it internally and have smooth or warty skin that can be quite penetrable, so most species remain in or near water or moist habitats. Frogs and toads share many similarities. Both have wide heads, short bodies, no ribs, and hip bones and legs specialized for hopping or jumping.\n\nFrogs vs. toads\n\nToads have a dry, warty skin and short hind legs and lay their eggs in chains. Frogs have smooth, moist skin and long hind legs and lay their eggs in clusters. Frogs and toads are usually colored in browns or greens, providing good camouflage from predators looking down both in water and on land. Their bellies are lighter in color, making them harder for underwater predators looking up to see against the bright sky. Frogs and toads also have skin glands producing chemicals that are distasteful and may be poisonous in some species. The warty bumps on toads contain chemicals that can repel, sicken or even kill animals that try to eat them.\n\nFrogs and toads survive the winter by hibernating\n\nAs temperatures begin to drop below freezing, some frog species will seek shelter at the bottoms of lakes and ponds. Other species will burrow into the ground. Those wintering in deeper waters or burrowed deep underground are protected from freezing. Others, such as the chorus frogs, tree frogs and wood frogs, have special “anti-freeze” substances in their bodies that allow them to survive while buried in shallow soil and leaf litter!\n\nEggs are soft and shell-less and are laid in water.\n\nFemale frogs and toads typically produce hundreds to thousands of eggs.\n\nIn a few days or weeks, the eggs hatch into fishlike tadpoles that gradually transform into four-legged adults. This transformation is called metamorphosis, which means to “change form.”\n\nTadpoles are covered with a thin skin and have long, flat tails and small, rounded mouths.\n\nMost tadpoles are herbivores, eating algae and other soft plant materials, but they also scavenge dead animals.\n\nDepending on species, the tadpole stage may last from several weeks to two or three years.\n\nDuring metamorphosis, the tadpole undergoes dramatic changes to practically every part of its body. For example:\n\nThe legs must develop, and the tail is absorbed.\n\nThe mouth broadens, and the digestive tract changes to that of a predator instead of an herbivore.\n\nRespiration shifts to the use of lungs as gills shrink.\n\nMany tadpoles and young frogs are lost to predators. Probably, for this reason, many frog species breed in small, temporary ponds that lack fish and larger predators."
