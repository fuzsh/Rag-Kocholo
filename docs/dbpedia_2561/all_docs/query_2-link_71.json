        "text": "MERIDIAN, Miss. (WTOK) - After Tropical Storm Debby’s landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Florida coastline on Monday morning, it slowed down dramatically, taking a hard eastward turn back out into the Atlantic.\n\nThe slow-moving storm now swirls just off the coast of the Carolinas, its sights set on a more northerly trajectory over the next few days.\n\nTropical storm warnings have already been issued along the Carolina coastlines as Debby’s bands of torrential, potentially record-setting rain bear down on the coastal states.\n\nPeak storm surge in the Carolinas is expected to be as much as 4 feet in some areas, with the potential for 8 to 12 inches of rainfall along coastal areas of the states within the next 24 hours. There is also the low-end potential for tornado activity within the storm’s bands of rain.\n\nDebby has lost much of its original strength and structure, having already made landfall once and spending much of the past 48 hours over land in Florida and Georgia, but it still remains a potent threat to states along the eastern seaboard.\n\nThe storm is not expected to significantly restrengthen, but warm ocean waters could allow for more significant rain and thunderstorm activity in affected areas within the next 48 hours as it approaches a second landfall along the Carolina coasts.\n\nAreas in the wake of Debby have gotten up to a foot or more of rain within the past 48 hours, including areas like Charleston, SC and Savannah, GA.\n\nDebby is set to pick up speed over the next 24 hours and move northward along the eastern seaboard states within the next few days.\n\nLOOKING BEYOND...\n\nThere is one other area of interest within the Caribbean right now with a low potential for development over the next few days.\n\nIt is expected to develop northwest of the Yucatan Peninsula in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico (if at all).\n\nShould it become anything significant, it would be given the name “Ernesto.”\n\nWhile meteorologists have recently readjusted their forecasts for the 2024 Atlantic season, it is still predicted to be an above-average year for tropical activity."
