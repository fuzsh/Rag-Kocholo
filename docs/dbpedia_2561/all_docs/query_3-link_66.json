The only remaining\n\nproducts are the Flood Warning (for the Lake Creek, Yentna and\n\nSkwentna Rivers) and the Flood Watch (for Susitna Valley). After\n\nanother round of light rain tomorrow for the Southcentral Mainland,\n\nexpect a return of clearer skies and warmer temperatures.\n\nThe details... as the parent low continues lifting north into the\n\nAlaska Interior, cold air advection aloft will produce gusty\n\nsoutherly winds up Cook Inlet and over places like Homer, Kenai,\n\nand Anchorage. These winds will eventually diminish later this\n\nafternoon and evening as the aforementioned low weakens and a more\n\nwesterly to northwesterly flow develops in the wake of the\n\ndeveloping Barrens Islands low as it tracks into the northern\n\nGulf. By late tonight into Monday morning, a northerly gap flow\n\nmore reminiscent of a winter pattern may bring gusty winds to\n\nSeward and Whittier.\n\nThere will be a brief reprieve in the rain from tonight through\n\nMonday morning for valley locations, while higher elevations\n\ncontinue to see scattered showers. However, rain showers move back\n\nacross the western half of Southcentral by Monday morning and\n\ninto Prince William Sound and the Copper River Basin for Monday\n\nafternoon and evening as a fast moving storm system moves across\n\nthe region from the west. This system will exit the region by\n\nTuesday morning, with improving conditions for all but the Copper\n\nRiver Basin.\n\nA ridge moves in behind Monday`s storm system, leading to much\n\nmore benign weather for the latter half of Tuesday and for\n\nWednesday. Expect light winds, clearer skies, and a warm up with\n\nmost areas seeing highs in the 60s.\n\n-TM/KC\n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM FORECAST SOUTHWEST ALASKA/BERING SEA/ALEUTIANS (Days\n\n1 through 3: Today through Thursday morning)...\n\nGOES water vapor imagery shows an upper-level shortwave over\n\nSouthwest Alaska moving eastward across the Alaska Range, with a\n\nanother shortwave descending from eastern Russia. Rain showers\n\ncontinue along the Kuskokwim Delta, Bristol Bay, and the Alaska\n\nPeninsula. The shortwave from eastern Russia moves into Southwest\n\nAlaska tonight bringing another period of showers to the Kuskokwim\n\nDelta and spreading eastward to the Alaska Range by early Monday\n\nmorning.\n\nAcross the Aleutians, a ridge of high pressure continues to build\n\ninto the Bering Sea through Monday. This high pressure will bring\n\nthe potential for fog, especially around the Pribilof Islands,\n\nand the western/central Aleutian Chain through Tuesday. Fog and\n\nmisty conditions may make it to the Southwest coast Tuesday\n\nmorning as the Bering Sea ridge shifts eastward.\n\nA Kamchatka low moves eastward and into the Bering Sea through\n\nWednesday morning. Areas of gale-force winds look to accompany\n\nthis low as well as moderate to heavy rain at times as its front\n\nmoves across the western and central Aleutians through Wednesday.\n\nThe front looks to move into the AKPEN and Southwest Alaska by\n\nThursday afternoon, with the potential for moderate to heavy rain\n\nand gusty winds.\n\n-ME\n\n&&\n\n.LONG TERM FORECAST (Days 4 through 7/Thursday through Sunday)...\n\nLooks like it is setting up another couple of rounds of active\n\nweather across the Alaska Weather map through this forecast\n\nperiod. Forecast models are in good agreement with the Eastern\n\nWeather producer, but loses confidence with a second system\n\ndeveloping in the Far West for Sunday. A well developed upper\n\nlevel trough works its way from the Central Bering on Thursday to\n\nthe Western Mainland by Sunday. This trough is also enhanced by\n\nseveral shortwaves rotating through the gradient. This system\n\nsupports a moderate surface low center and front that spreads\n\nlocally heavy rains and near gale force winds from the Northern\n\nand Eastern Bering to the Eastern Aleutians and Alaska Peninsula.\n\nHeaviest rainfall should occur along the Pacific side of the AKPEN\n\nand spread over Kodiak Island late Thursday into Friday. As the\n\nlow-980s surface low tracks Northward through the weekend, locally\n\nheavy rains spread into the Yukon-Kuskokwim Valleys and Bristol\n\nBay. Rainfall continues across Southern Alaska with the infusion\n\nof moisture and gusty winds from the North Pacific through the\n\nweekend, continuing across Southcentral Alaska. Another bout of\n\nheavy rains is expected across Prince William Sound and Copper\n\nRiver Delta late Saturday into Sunday. A second stronger band of\n\nmoisture pushes through the Susitna Valley up to the Alaska Range.\n\nJust beyond the end of this forecast period, a new North Pacific\n\nlow center approaches the Western Aleutians for Sunday. This\n\ndeveloping system looks to have support from a second upper level\n\ntrough coming out of Russia, plus some additional influence from\n\nthe North Pacific. It is expected to bring heavy rains and\n\npotentially gale force winds into the Western Aleutians and\n\nBering for the start of next week.\n\n- Kutz\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION...\n\nPANC...Rain showers will move off to the north and east between\n\n00Z and 03Z today with breezy southeasterly winds becoming more\n\nsouthwesterly. Winds will then decrease to under 10 kts by 06Z.\n\nVFR ceilings, with some drops to MVFR, are likely to continue\n\nthrough Monday as another system brings additional rain showers\n\ninto the terminal Monday morning.\n\nThe main area of uncertainty is this evening into the overnight\n\nhours, with potential for areas of fog and low clouds (IFR) to\n\ndevelop as upper level clouds exit and radiational cooling ensues\n\nin a very moist environment. With hours of daylight left, do think\n\nthere is ample time to dry out the low levels a bit. If lower\n\nconditions do develop, low level south to southwest flow will\n\nfavor areas up against the Chugach, with lower probabilities of\n\nmoving over the terminal.\n\n&&\n\n$$\n\n616\n\nFXAK69 PAFG 112049 CCA\n\nAFDAFG\n\nNorthern Alaska Forecast Discussion\n\nNational Weather Service Fairbanks AK\n\n1207 PM AKDT Sun Aug 11 2024\n\n.SYNOPSIS...\n\nSeasonably cool pattern with showers over the Interior persists\n\ninto early next week. Strong fronts will cross the W Arctic the\n\nnext few days. Increasing southwest winds along the coast next\n\nweek will bring in higher water levels to coastal regions. High\n\nwaters on the Tanana River will also continue into next week.\n\n&&\n\n.DISCUSSION...\n\nUpper Levels and Analysis...\n\nThere is a large upper level low over the Mainland, with spokes on\n\na wheel rotating around this in the form of lower amplitude\n\nshortwaves. The first is a strong storm which moved inland across\n\nBristol Bay yesterday and is moving northeast into the Yukon.\n\nThere is another shortwave trough moving from the Gulf of Anadyr\n\nto the N Bering Sea. There is a strong 519 dam arctic low near\n\nWrangel Island. Downslope winds continue across the AK Range which\n\nis keeping the Interior in only intermittent showers along with\n\ncontinued south winds.\n\nModel and Forecast Discussion...\n\nSeveral arctic fronts will move to the NW Arctic, the first being\n\ntonight. A much stronger one will move across from west to east\n\nMonday and Tuesday. Weak ridging will build inland at that same\n\ntime, with increasing southwest onshore flow over the West Coast.\n\nThe dynamical and numerical ensembles are all in good agreement\n\nnow with the general flow and pattern. Things don`t really get\n\nuncertain until midweek as a strong coastal low is possible\n\nsometime Thursday into Friday.\n\nCentral and Eastern Interior... Light showers today will become more\n\nwidespread tonight as the downslope winds across the Alaska Range\n\nend, and winds in the passes weaken. Isolated thunder today is\n\nrelegated to the ALCAN border over the Fortymile Uplands. Showers\n\ncontinue into tomorrow but will be gradually dissipating. Some\n\npatchy overnight fog is likely Monday night as skies partly clear,\n\nand with temps falling well into the 40s. Drying out and slowly\n\nwarming Tuesday, but warming up much more Wednesday as we approach\n\nseasonal normal values again over the Interior, which is the upper\n\n60s.\n\nWest Coast and Western Interior...\n\nShowers over the Interior dissipate tonight. Another low will clip\n\nthe YK Delta to Lower Yukon with more light rainfall late this\n\nevening and tonight then quickly shift into the Gulf. The pattern\n\nwill turn to more southwest flow driven which means extensive\n\nstratus along the coast with periods of fog. Fronts will clip the\n\nNW Arctic with periods of rainfall Tue and Wed. A stronger storm\n\nis on tap for later in the week.\n\nNorth Slope and Brooks Range...\n\nWeak high pressure dominates the Arctic and N Slope with\n\nextensive stratus and some areas of fog. A weak arctic front will\n\nmove east across the W Arctic tonight and early tomorrow with west\n\nwinds and a shot of rainfall. Attention turns to a much stronger\n\narctic front which will bring gales to the W Arctic from Point\n\nHope to near Utqiagvik with southwest winds on Monday and\n\nTuesday. Much better chance of rain with this system, but with the\n\nwind trajectories some warming will also occur with the south\n\nwinds component over the E Arctic on Tue and Wed.\n\nExtended Forecast Days 4-7...\n\nA broad upper trough extending from the Arctic to the Bering Sea\n\nwill be in place Wednesday with a ridge over the E Interior. A\n\ncoastal low will develop from the Bering on Thursday and Friday\n\nand shift into the West Coast, bringing widespread rainfall and\n\npossible gales. The low track is highly uncertain, so locals\n\naround the West Coast will want to remain alert to future\n\nforecasts, as there is a chance for elevated water levels and a\n\nstrong coastal low. Wednesday and Thursday are warmer after\n\nseveral cool days over the Interior, then it cools as the West\n\nCoast low shifts east during the weekend.\n\nCoastal Hazard Potential Days 3 and 4...Southwest winds of 20 to\n\n30 mph along the West Coast Monday through Wednesday will promote\n\nelevated water levels of 1 to 2 feet above the normal high tide\n\nline. A coastal low may impact the West Coast Thursday and Friday\n\nwith higher water levels possible.\n\n&&\n\n.FIRE WEATHER...\n\nCooler and damp out west continues through the period, with\n\nincreasing chances for light showers and wetting rains over the E\n\nInterior tonight and tomorrow as the upper trough moves east.\n\nDownslope winds in the AK Range passes end late this afternoon.\n\nIsolated wet thunder is possible near the ALCAN border today from\n\nNorthway to Eagle. Warming up slightly Wednesday as a ridge\n\nbuilds over the Interior.\n\n&&\n\n.HYDROLOGY...\n\nThe Tanana River crested at Big Delta Saturday, and at Fairbanks\n\nthis morning, both at action stage and just below flood stage.\n\nWater will continue to move downstream, but remain at action stage\n\nand below flood stage. Water levels at Fairbanks will remain high\n\nfor the next several days, but currently it is projected to now be\n\nbelow minor flood stage at Fairbanks. Inundation of gravel bars\n\nas well as minor flooding remains possible with these elevated\n\nriver levels. No significant rainfall is anticipated the next\n\nseveral days, otherwise.\n\n&&\n\n.AFG WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\n\nAK...None.\n\nPK...Small Craft Advisory for PKZ801.\n\nSmall Craft Advisory for PKZ807-810-856.\n\nSmall Craft Advisory for PKZ811-812-858.\n\nSmall Craft Advisory for PKZ850.\n\nSmall Craft Advisory for PKZ851.\n\nSmall Craft Advisory for PKZ857.\n\nSmall Craft Advisory for PKZ859.\n\n&&\n\n$$\n\nAhsenmacher\n\n452\n\nFXAK67 PAJK 112314\n\nAFDAJK\n\nSoutheast Alaska Forecast Discussion\n\nNational Weather Service Juneau AK\n\n314 PM AKDT Sun Aug 11 2024\n\n.SHORT TERM...Rain returns to the panhandle as another system\n\nmoves through the area alongside breezy conditions for some\n\nlocations. The rain and wind will diminish on Monday, though some\n\nchances of showers will linger through the remainder of the time\n\nframe.\n\nSatellite and radar imagery shows that rainfall has begun to spread\n\nacross the panhandle. Surface observations indicate that parts of\n\nthe northern panhandle have already begun to report precip, and\n\nthe remainder of the northern panhandle will see rain arrive\n\nthrough the afternoon or early evening time frame. The source of\n\nthe rain is a system moving E out of the Northern Gulf. The\n\nsystem`s corresponding upper level reflection\n\n- a weakening trough, will still be sufficiently strong enough to\n\neject the ridge which had been rebuilding across the area\n\npreviously.\n\nAs the system moves through, breezy conditions are expected for some\n\nlocations, especially in the northern half of the panhandle and the\n\nIcy Strait Corridor. Winds will increase through the afternoon\n\nand evening hours on Sunday, and could reach as high as 15 to 20\n\nkt sustained in some parts of Juneau, with stronger winds\n\npossible for parts of the far northern panhandle. These winds will\n\nbe diminishing by late Sunday night, and the system itself will\n\nhave largely departed the panhandle by the late afternoon.\n\nAlthough chances of rain are also in the forecast for much the\n\nsouthern panhandle, precipitation totals there will be\n\nconsiderably lower ( with maximum totals of up to 0.2 inches, as\n\ncompared to 0.4 - 0.8 inches for the northern panhandle) given the\n\nsystem`s continued weakening.\n\nImproving conditions are expected through Monday, with only\n\nresidual showers by late Monday afternoon. The synoptic scale\n\nflow from the WNW is one that is less than favorable for\n\ncontinuing shower activity, and so anticipate that despite the\n\nlingering chances of precip, many areas will likely see a dry\n\nsecond half of the day. Clearing skies in the wake of the\n\ndeparting system will help set the stage for the arrival of fog\n\nacross much of the area Monday night into early Tuesday morning.\n\nGiven the clearing skies on Monday, expect that temperatures in\n\nsome areas will reach as warm as the upper 60s, though lower 850\n\nmb temperatures will help put a cap on any truly warm weather for\n\nthe immediate future. Low temperatures will largely stay in the\n\n50s across many areas near sea level Sunday night, but could drop\n\ninto the 40s for some locations Monday night as clearing skies\n\nenable more radiational cooling.\n\nThe forecast generally remains largely on track. Increased winds\n\nacross Cross Sound and Icy Strait given the anticipated system\n\ntrack, and made some minor adjustments to temperatures given\n\nanticipated cloud cover. Also accelerated the forecast departure\n\nof the system across the northern panhandle, given slightly faster\n\nthan previously progged system motion.\n\n.LONG TERM.../Tuesday to Friday/...\n\nQuick hits for next week:\n\n-Rainy start for some in the mid-range. Dry weather late week for\n\nall.\n\n-Moderate chances (40-70%) of rain linger into Tuesday with PoPS\n\ndecreasing Wednesday, leaving Thursday and Friday dry.\n\n-Marine winds will be strongest in the Lynn Canal area, at around\n\n10 to 20 knots at times with some evidence showing near 25 knot\n\nwind speeds possible. The rest of the inner channels look to have\n\nwind speeds around 5 to 15 knots.\n\n-Daytime temps will be near normal with a warming trend for the\n\nsecond half of the week.\n\n-Nighttime temps will be cooler than normal with morning lows in\n\nthe 40s for much of the central panhandle.\n\nDetails for next week:\n\nOn the heels of an exiting trough, a 500mb low will move towards the\n\nnorthern Gulf, keeping chances for rain in the forecast for mainly\n\nthe northern panhandle. The southern panhandle may end up being on\n\njust enough of a ridge that would keep the bulk of the rain at bay.\n\nWednesday into the weekend, 500mb ridging sets up, giving the\n\npanhandle another few days of dry weather.\n\nInner channel marine winds look to be around 5 to 15 knots for most\n\nof the area. The main exception is Lynn Canal, where stronger winds\n\nmay end up setting up. The NBM is hinting at wind speeds around 10\n\nto 15 knots, which usually translates to winds around 20 to 25\n\nknots. So while the marine forecast for Lynn Canal is set to 15 to\n\n20 knots, the confidence is low and may need to be increased as we\n\nget closer.\n\nFor temperatures, according to the EURO Ensemble and GEFS 850mb\n\ntemps, it could be a chilly morning Wednesday. 850mb temps could dip\n\nto near 2 to 3C, which is cooler than normal for mid-August. So went\n\nwith temps in the low to mid 40s for parts of the central and\n\nnorthern panhandle. Temps in the mid 40s aren`t hugely impactful but\n\nit`s a gentle reminder of the cooler temps on the way.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION...Aviation conditions along the NE outer coast are\n\nalready starting to degrade as a new front moves in from the west\n\nthis afternoon. Yakutat and Elfin Cove are reporting IFR\n\nconditions with ceilings as low as 700 ft and 1 1/2 mile vis.\n\nThere are also some breezy conditions with the front with Yakutat\n\ngusting to 20 kt currently. That is going to spread inland this\n\nevening and overnight with the northern half of the panhandle\n\nseeing the brunt of it. Expect IFR conditions overnight and\n\npossibly tomorrow morning before conditions gradually improve into\n\nMonday. Some breezy conditions likely in the north tonight as\n\nwell, but nothing greater then 20 kt. Exception is Skagway and\n\nupper Lynn Canal where winds are gusting to 35 kt this afternoon.\n\nThose winds will mostly persist overnight before diminishing\n\ntomorrow morning.\n\n&&\n\n.MARINE...Elevated winds will persist across the outer coastal\n\nwaters and inner channels through the remainder of Sunday, with\n\nwind speeds increasing through Sunday evening in the inner\n\nchannels as a system moves into the panhandle. Winds will diminish\n\nacross most of the inner channels through the latter half of\n\nMonday as the system departs, though northern Lynn Canal will\n\nprove to be the exception. Small craft conditions are anticipated\n\nfor many of the outer coastal waters and near some of the ocean\n\nentrances and Lynn Canal. Some gale force conditions are expected\n\nthrough the early evening hours on Sunday for parts of the\n\nnorthern gulf.\n\n&&\n\n.AJK WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\n\nPUBLIC...Strong Wind until 4 PM AKDT this afternoon for AKZ318.\n\nMARINE...Gale Warning for PKZ651.\n\nSmall Craft Advisory for PKZ012-053-643-644-652-661>664-671-672.\n\n&&\n\n$$\n\nSHORT TERM...GFS\n\nLONG TERM....GJS\n\nAVIATION...EAL\n\nVisit us at http://www.weather.gov/Juneau"
