        "text": "Note: This is a national list and many of the items listed are housed in collections across the country. The Library of Congress does not currently hold copies of all the recordings listed.\n\nRecordings are listed in chronological order:\n\nPhonautograms. Edouard-Leon Scott de Martinville. (c. 1853-1861)\n\nIn late 1853 or early 1854, Edouard-Leon Scott de Martinville captured the first recorded sounds by etching onto blackened glass plates the movements of a boar's-bristle stylus, vibrating in sympathy with a guitar and a human voice. Later, Scott made recordings on paper wrapped around a drum. The resulting \"phonautograms\" proved crucial to the development of recorded sound. Scott was interested solely in the visible tracings of sound waves in order to study acoustics and did not record with the intention of playing back or listening to his recordings. Nevertheless, in 2008, researchers from the First Sounds group, using contemporary audio technology (developed with the support of several institutions, including the Library of Congress and the National Recording Preservation Board) were able to play back Scott's recordings for the very first time.

It is a survivor—the earliest extant document that captures a musical performance. The recording is on a piece of tinfoil. It lasts 78 seconds and was made on a phonograph in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 22, 1878, just months after Thomas Edison invented his magic recording machine. For years the foil endured and went, not surprisingly, unplayed. Then, in the summer of 2013, the Museum of Science and Innovation (a.k.a. miSci) in Schenectady, New York, announced that physicists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory had recovered the sound from this slip of shiny silver. The result was a surprisingly listenable musical and vocal interlude. Selected for the 2020 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 386KB)\n\nListen (MP3)\n\nEdison Talking doll cylinder. (1888)\n\nFew, if any, sound recordings can lay claim to as many \"firsts\" as the small, mangled artifact of a failed business venture discovered in 1967 in the desk of an assistant to Thomas Edison. This cylinder recording, only 5/8-inches wide, represents the foundjohations of many aspects of recording history. It was created in 1888 by a short-lived Edison company established to make talking dolls for children, and it is the only surviving example from the experimental stage of the Edison dolls production when the cylinders were made of tin. As such, this recording of \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,\" as sung by an anonymous Edison employee, is the earliest known commercial sound recording in existence. It is also the first children's recording and, quite possibly, the first recording to be made by someone who was paid to perform for a sound recording. Due to its poor condition, the recording was considered unplayable until 2011 when its surface was scanned in three dimensions using digital mapping tools created at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and developed in collaboration with the Library of Congress. Selected for the 2011 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 64KB)\n\nListen (MP3)\n\nThe 1888 London cylinder recordings of Col. George Gouraud. (1888)\n\nThomas Edison debuted his \"perfected\" wax-cylinder phonograph in the summer of 1888, rendering obsolete his 1877 tinfoil model and preventing a coup against his \"favorite invention\" by Bell and Tainter's insurgent Graphophone. The first phonograph to leave Edison's factory was sent to his friend and agent, Civil War hero Col. George Gouraud, an American living in London, who had a knack for promoting and marketing new technologies. In the second half of 1888, Gouraud marketed the machine by hosting recording demonstrations with celebrity guests and, perhaps accidentally, preserved for posterity the voices of prominent poets, scientists, musicians and politicians, including future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and Sir Arthur Sullivan of Gilbert & Sullivan. The first of these recordings was the Handel Festival at the Crystal Palace. Hugh DeCoursey Hamilton, who worked for Gouraud and Edison, captured a 4,000-voice chorus performing \"Israel in Egypt\" from the press balcony 100 yards away. Gouraud also recorded his friends, family and business partners.

Selected for the 2002 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 185KB)\n\nListen—\"Pattison Waltz\" (MP3)\n\nJesse Walter Fewkes field recordings of the Passamaquoddy Indians. (1890)\n\nFewkes' cylinder recordings, 30 in total and made in Calais, Maine, are considered to be the first ethnographic recordings made produced \"in the field,\" as well as the first recordings of Native American music. The cylinders are held by the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress.

(c. 1890)\n\nEmile Berliner, the inventor of the microphone and founder of the first disc record company, lived and worked in Washington, D.C. A contemporary of Thomas Edison, Berliner believed that the wax cylinder developed by Edison and his partners was too soft and fragile for making a permanent recording. Hence, he developed the first process for mass-production of disc recordings. These are two of his early recordings.

The core of the collection is based on several decades of purposeful acquisition by anthropologist Donald R. Hill and sound historian David Giovannoni. From its commercial introduction in the 1890s through its demise in the 1920s, the cylinder phonograph allowed its owners to make sound recordings at home. These UCSB audio \"snapshots\" of everyday life are perhaps the most authentic audio documents of the period: songs sung by children, instrumentals, jokes, and ad-libbed narratives. The vast majority of vernacular wax recordings remain in private hands or uncatalogued in institutions. UCSB's extensive collection serves as a beacon for the recognition and assertive preservation of these highly endangered audio treasures.

These recordings contain Fijian, Samoan, Uvean, Javanese, Turkish, Kwakiutl or Vancouver Island Indian songs and ceremonies along with recordings of other Middle Eastern, South Seas and Native American musicians and singers who performed in specially constructed \"villages\" along the midway. In addition to being the first recordings ever made at any World's Fair, these are also the earliest known recordings of many non-western musical styles, such as the Javanese Gamelan. Selected for the 2014 registry.\n\nListen (MP3)\n\n\"The Laughing Song.\" George Washington Johnson. (c. 1896)\n\nGeorge W. Johnson was the first African American to make commercial records; he began in 1890. Born near Wheatland, Virginia, Johnson made his living as a street singer during the 1870s, busking in New York City. \"The Laughing Song\" was Johnson's most famous and long-lived number. This familiar sounding and uncomplicated tune was sung by Johnson in a down-home, gruff baritone and completed with his infectious laughter, all remarkably free of the caricature and forced dialect that marked most African American-themed material of the period. \"Laughing Song\" was tremendously successful, with versions released in the US and Europe. With its ragtime-imbued accompaniment, its stature is inestimable: here is perhaps the most popular recording of the 1890s, and probably the first \"hit\" sung by an African American.

(1897)\n\nThe first recording of America's favorite march. \"The Stars and Stripes Forever,\" John Philip Sousa's most famous composition, was recorded by the company of the inventor of the 78-rpm gramophone disc, Emile Berliner, for his company Berliner Gramophone.

The Berliner Gramophone Company captured bass Eugene Cowles' performance of one of the operetta's hits, \"Gypsy Love Song,\" on what was one of the very first \"original cast recordings.\" Selected for the 2004 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 615KB)\n\nListen in National Jukebox\n\n\"Honolulu Cake Walk.\" Vess Ossman. (c. 1900)\n\nDuring the era of ragtime music's greatest popularity -- the late 19th and early 20th centuries -- the syncopated music was typically recorded by bands, orchestras, or small ensembles, or accordion, xylophone, or banjo soloists. Vess Ossman, called \"The Banjo King,\" was the one of the most prolific recording artists of that time. His \"Honolulu Cake Walk\" is a prime example of recorded ragtime banjo. Selected for the 2003 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 150KB)\n\nListen (MP3)\n\nRagtime compositions on piano rolls. Scott Joplin. (1900s)\n\nScott Joplin is today regarded as the pre-eminent composer of ragtime compositions. Joplin himself performed some of these \"rags\" for piano roll sales. These rolls represent the way these compositions were originally listened to and enjoyed--on home player pianos. They are outstanding examples of a less-familiar, now nearly-obsolete sound recording format. This selection consists of the titles \"Maple Leaf Rag,\" \"Magnetic Rag,\" \"Weeping Willow Rag,\" \"Something Doing,\" \"Pleasant Moments,\" and \"Ole Miss Rag.\" Selected for the 2002 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 48KB)\n\nListen—\"Maple Leaf Rag\" (MP3)\n\nLionel Mapleson cylinder recordings of the Metropolitan Opera. (1900-1903)\n\nIn the early 1900s, Lionel Mapleson set up a phonograph in the New York City Metropolitan Opera House to record excerpts of live performances there. These cylinders preserve a special window on the spontaneous artistry of this era and are the only known extant recordings of some performers, including Jean de Reszke.

(1901)\n\nThis vaudeville and musical theater duo, among America's first African-American recording artists, recorded many sides for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1901. But as effective as the comic duo were on record, George Walker disliked recording and made only one other disc. Bert Williams, however, had a very successful recording career, which included two versions of his signature song, \"Nobody,\" before his death in 1922. The Victor discs are quite rare. Two of them, \"The Fortune Telling Man \" (Victor 1083) and \"The Ghost of a Coon\" (Victor 998), are missing from any known collection.

(c. 1901-1905)\n\nThese cylinders originally produced by the Standard Phonograph Company of New York are believed to be the earliest recordings of Yiddish songs. Eventually released by the Thomas Lambert Company of Chicago, these releases (some manufactured in unusually vibrant colors) also represent the first releases by an ethnically-owned and ethnically-focused record company, a risky venture at a time when a US-based audience for foreign-language music had yet to be established. These surviving 20 cylinders of 48 once produced, provide an insight not only into the Yiddish-speaking community of the era but also into the difficult assimilation of Jewish immigrants arriving to America at the turn of the century. In 2016, the Archeophone label lovingly restored and packed the cylinder into a CD-set.

(1903)\n\nRepresentative of the Columbia Grand Opera Series. Columbia Records' 1903 \"celebrity\" series of discs featured seven Metropolitan Opera stars who were considered some of the most significant singers of the period. Perhaps of greatest historical significance within the Series are the three recordings made by bass Edouard de Reszke. They are his only known published recordings, made when he was approaching the end of his performing career. Other performers included in the Series are Giuseppe Campanari, baritone; Marcella Sembrich, soprano; Suzanne Adams, soprano; Ernestine Schumann-Heink, contralto; Antonio Scotti, baritone; and Charles Gilbert, baritone.

(1904)\n\nCal Stewart was among the most prolific and popular recording artists of the first 20 years of commercial recording. His \"Uncle Josh\" monologues offer humorous commentary on American life at the turn of the 20th century. His \"rural comedy\" describes life in the imaginary New England village of Pumpkin Center, painting humorous pictures of Uncle Josh's encounters with new technologies as well as pointing out the comic contrasts between agrarian and urban life in America. Stewart's influence can be heard in the comedy of Will Rogers, in Fred Allen's character, Titus Moody, and in Garrison Keillor's stories about Lake Wobegon. \"Uncle Josh and the Insurance Company\" is especially notable as the first recording of the humorous folk tale and urban legend \"Barrel of Bricks.\" Selected for the 2006 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 72KB)\n\nListen (MP3)\n\n\"Casey at the Bat.\" DeWolf Hopper.

(1906)\n\nBilly Murray was one of the most popular recording artists in the U.S. in the acoustic recording era. His distinct tenor voice was featured on hundreds of records issued by Victor, Columbia, Edison, and other labels. Some of Murray's best-loved and most popular recordings were of George M. Cohan's songs. \"You're a Grand Old Rag\" was the original title of this recording and Cohan's song \"You're a Grand Old Flag.\" Despite the song's clear patriotic message, \"rag\" was considered by many to be an undignified and inappropriate way to refer to the American flag.

(1908-1909) (album)\n\nMariachi music and its imagery are now emblematic of Mexican national identity, but it was once a rural style of music played mainly in the state of Jalisco. In 1908, four musicians from the town of Cocula, Jalisco, led by the vihuela player Justo Villa, made the very first recordings of it in Mexico City, where two years earlier they had introduced the style to the capital when they performed for the Mexican president Porfirio Diaz. These performances lack the trumpet now inextricably associated with mariachi, but even the early recording technology of the time could not fail to capture the group’s drive and spirit, and the recordings remained in print for many years. Thanks to the efforts of scholars and record collectors, the group’s work was collected and reissued in 1998 by Arhoolie Records, revisiting and reviving an otherwise lost chapter in mariachi’s history and paying overdue homage to these recording pioneers.

(1908)\n\nThis recording captured a gifted monologist at his best and became one of the most popular performances on early records. The \"No News\" monologue, with its roots in oral tradition, was one of vaudeville's most famous and often-copied routines. The monologue unfolds as a piecemeal report by a servant to his master who recently returned from a trip, assuring him that there is nothing new to report from home, except that his dog has died. Nat M. Wills displays masterful comic timing as he slowly reveals, in a escalating hierarchy of domestic disasters, the events that led up to the dog's demise.

(1908)\n\nThis popular song has become an unofficial national anthem of America's national pastime. It was composed in 1908 and was recorded by all three of the major U.S. record companies, Victor, Columbia and Edison. Few copies of these recordings are now extant, which may indicate that initially the song was not as popular as it was to become later. Comic vocalist Edward Meeker, whose duties for Edison included announcing the titles and artists on hundreds of cylinders, sings on this Edison recording. Meeker delivers the song in his stentorian, but good-natured baritone, including both verses, which remind us that the song is about a baseball-loving woman.

(1911)\n\nVaudeville singer and comedienne Sophie Tucker first recorded her signature song for the Edison company on cylinder. It was the beginning of a recording career that extended nearly 50 years. This Sheldon Brooks song was an ideal vehicle for the earthy star known as \"the Last of the Red-Hot Mamas.\" Selected for the 2004 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 273KB)\n\nListen External\n\n\"Dream Melody Intermezzo: Naughty Marietta\" (single). Victor Herbert and His Orchestra. (1911)\n\nVictor Herbert's \"Dream Melody Intermezzo\" is one of several iterations of the immortal song \"Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life\" heard throughout Herbert's most successful operetta, \"Naughty Marietta.\" This recording is the intermezzo version of \"Sweet Mystery,\" which is heard near the beginning of Act II as a transitional piece during which time the locale moves from the marionette theatre to the Juenesse Doree Club's ballroom. As \"Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life,\" the work has lived on as a free-standing song, heard to both dramatic and comic effect. In this 1911 Edison cylinder recording, listeners are transported back to the fall of 1910. The arrangement calls for a sprightly, annunciatory introduction by brass and pizzicato strings. The new cylinder recording process made it possible to capture nuances of the orchestra not possible with disc recording technology of the time.

(1911)\n\nThe Columbia Quartette was, in reality, the Peerless Quartet, led by tenor Henry Burr. Burr's distinctive forward-sounding, nasal voice gave the Peerless a unique and easily identifiable tone. The blend and balance of the harmonized quartet is rich and satisfying, providing us with an authentic taste of the music of the 1910s. \"Let Me Call You Sweetheart,\" a product of Tin Pan Alley, composed and written by Leo Friedman and Beth Slater Whitson, has an uncomplicated rhyming scheme and predictable melodic contour, making it a song that has endured for more than a century with its unabashed, expression of love.

(1911-1914)\n\nRecorded on 148 wax cylinders between September 1911 and April 1914, this is the largest collection of the extinct Yahi language. Ishi, the last surviving member of the Northern California Yahi tribe and the last speaker of its language, sings traditional Yahi songs and tells stories, including the story of \"Wood Duck\" recorded on 51 cylinders. The complete recordings, totaling 5 hours and 41 minutes, were made by anthropologists Alfred Kroeber and T.T. Waterman during Ishi's five-year residency at the University of California Museum of Anthropology in San Francisco (now the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology, UC Berkeley).

(1912)\n\n\"Come Down Ma Evenin' Star\" is the only surviving recording of Lillian Russell, one of the greatest stars the American musical stage has ever known, a versatile performer at home in operetta, burlesque and vaudeville whose personal life often generated as much publicity as her performances. Born in 1861, she was a star before movies and recordings, which in their early days could not do justice to her famous beauty, voice, style and stage presence. \"Come Down\" was her signature song. She introduced it in the 1902 burlesque review \"Twirly-Wirly,\" parodying the nouveau-riche society figure she had become, but investing it with a poignancy that reflected its troubled history. The song was written by her former music director John Stromberg, who committed suicide over the pain of chronic, untreatable rheumatism hours after finishing it. Russell recorded it in 1912, but it was not released. In 1943, rare record dealer Jack L. Caidin found a lone test pressing of it, inscribed by Russell herself, and released it on his own specialty label, providing us with a brief echo of the Lillian Russell phenomenon, and a fleeting glimpse into nineteenth century American theater.

It caught on quickly and was soon being performed by bands around the country, introducing Handy's style of 12-bar blues to a wide audience.

(1915)\n\nElegant, charming and unexpected, Jerome Kern's \"They Didn't Believe Me\" was a late arrival—or interpolation—into the musical \"The Girl from Utah.\" Its appearance marked a turning point in American theater music and popular song. Its melody has been described as \"natural as walking,\" free from the formal-sounding, stilted phrases and form that typified most show music of the period. The song quickly became an enormous hit and greatly accelerated Kern's career. This recording by Macdonough and Green (nee Olive Kline) is the first known recording of the song and represents well its forward-looking informality. Although the song\" is in standard eight-measure phrases, the melody and words (by Herbert Reynolds) fall into delightful anacrusis, and the singers create a relaxed, free-flowing effect.

Natalie Burlin, a pioneer in the study of American minority cultures, was one of the leading collectors and transcribers of indigenous music of Africa and the United States. Beginning around 1903, she worked to document and preserve Native American culture and, in 1910, extended her work to studies of African-American and African culture. Burlin published four volumes of transcriptions taken from performances by students at Virginia's Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in 1918-1919. Recordings by the Hampton Quartette made on wax cylinders during the 1880s, including this recording of \"Listen to the Lambs,\" were probably the basis of some of her published transcriptions.

Soon after his debut, Heifetz started recording for the Victor Talking Machine Company. He would maintain a relationship with Victor, and later RCA Victor, over the course of his career. These acoustic recordings, made between 1917 and 1924, were mostly light recital pieces with piano accompaniment.

(1918)\n\nIn one of the first recorded versions of this American standard, cabaret star Marion Harris, in a profound departure from then-current singing styles, sang in a relaxed, loose-limbed, near swinging style. Her performance matched perfectly the lyric of this unsentimental love song by Turner Layton and Harry Creamer, and also its sleek, blues-inflected melody and harmony. Layton and Creamer were part of a small group of African American songwriters to write for Broadway revues during the 1910s. This recording of \"After You've Gone\" led the transition in American popular singing from a full-throated, relatively stilted style, to a manner more relaxed, subtle and evocative.

Their band, led by composer and orchestra leader James Reese Europe, also made an enormous impression, and received a hero’s welcome home. Shortly before beginning a national tour, the band began making a series of recordings for the American Pathé label. “Clarinet Marmalade” was a work composed by clarinetist Larry Shields and pianist Henry Ragas. It was recorded by Europe’s ensemble in 1919, and though their instrumentation was that of a standard military band, their delivery had a verve and abandon unheard of from such a group. “Clarinet Marmalade” was one of 24 titles released by Europe’s ensemble which helped introduce a new Black American music to a welcoming public.

Although rather quaint to modern ears, \"Whispering\" was at the pinnacle of up-to-date dance music and directly led to the Big Band Era. Among its attributes were bold, clean lines with the melody clearly in front. Gone was the old fashioned-ness of the lead being handed off to different voices mid-chorus. Also, harmonic and rhythmic support was pared down to a sleek, tasteful profile, one that encouraged the smart-looking updated fox-trot of 1920.

Though there was a large Irish and Irish-American audience there, a somewhat homogenized version of Irish music incorporating various influences had taken hold, and even a rural, traditional fiddler of Coleman's singular caliber must have seemed well behind the times. Nevertheless, Coleman achieved unprecedented commercial success and a long-lasting impact on both sides of the Atlantic. He remains a vital figure in Irish music to this day. His brisk, highly ornamented playing set new standards and brought traditional music a level of respect it had never had even in Ireland.

One of the songs he did it with was “St. Louis Blues,” which Handy both wrote and played. It was one of the first blues songs to enjoy success as a pop song. Later, the tune would be incorporated into the repertoire of numerous other legends including Bessie Smith, Bing Crosby, Glenn Miller, Count Basie and Benny Goodman. Meanwhile, Handy, beyond his own composition and performing prowess, created detailed, written exegeses of blues music (including his own compositions) which have long served to educate others about the artistry of blues and aid in their appreciation for this American artform.

Moore sought to restore the standing of the song among young African-Americans.

(1927)\n\n\"Compagnia Columba\" were a group of actors who recorded this and other scenes for the Columbia label, including sketches about the death of Rudolph Valentino and the Lateran Treaty that recognized Vatican City as an independent state. This 1927 release combines a spoken, dramatic set piece on it's A side with a protest song on the B side. Both sides decry the impending execution of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, two Italian American immigrants convicted of murder in 1920 but believed by many to have been railroaded because of their anarchist political beliefs. \"Protesta per Sacco e Vanzetti\" presents a scene at a rally for the two men, with actors, representing different regions of Italy, speaking on their behalf as well as others wrongly accused: \"Friends, you already know what has brought us together here, and I am happy to see in this solemn moment a crowd made up not just of Italians but of people of all nationalities: Italians, Americans, Jews, English, Japanese. At this fatal hour we have come together to form a single race: the human race! With no differences based on age, on class, or on party.\" The scene was written by Frank Amodio, who specialized in dramatic and comedic sketches aimed at Italian-Americans. Side B features Raoul Romito, a popular Neapolitan tenor residing in the U.S., performing a song written by Renzo Vampo and F.

He is a captivating storyteller. McTell's voice is accompanied brilliantly by his 12-string guitar as the latter darts and dodges among the vocal phrases, creating many layers of rhythm. The guitar is also somewhat out-of-tune which combines with a reverberant room to lend the record an eerie effect. McTell is also very free with meter, in the manner of old-time country performers, adding and subtracting the standard number of measures.

This is remarkable given the rhythmic complexities of the first four measures. Musicologist and author Alec Wilder wrote in \"American Popular Song,\" \"It is the most complex and provocative I have ever come upon.\" The song was introduced in the film by Harry Richman (1895-1972), a song-and-dance man and star of radio, movies and nightclubs. Although Richman is little remembered today, his top-hatted presence, with cane and tails, set the tone and stage for this swanky tune. His enduring features—a slight lisp and a tendency to over-pronounce the syllable \"oo\"—have been parodied in animated cartoons and by musician/comedian Spike Jones. On this recording, Richman is accompanied by Earl Burtnett and his Los Angeles Hotel Biltmore Orchestra, who supply sophisticated accompaniment.

It is well known in Puerto Rico and throughout Latin America to this day and has been recorded dozens of times, including versions by contemporary singers such as Marc Anthony and Placido Domingo. The song's success launched the careers of three major Puerto Rican artists: songwriter Rafael Hernández, bandleader \"Canario\" (Manuel Jiménez) and singer \"Davilita\" (Pedro Ortiz Dávila), who was just 18 when he recorded the song. The term \"Borincano\" derives from the indigenous name for Puerto Rico—Borinquen.

The song, composed by Vinson, quickly became part of the Southern and Southwestern musical vernacular, with distinctive versions recorded by black and white artists, including Charlie Patton, Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, Bill Monroe, Ray Charles, Howlin' Wolf and many others.

Minnie, herself, is characterized as both \"rough and tough\" and big-hearted, and one who hung around with types as disparate as \"Cokey Joe\" and the King of Sweden.

(October 18, 1931)\n\nWill Rogers had starred on the stage and screen and even made records, but when he entered radio broadcasting, it proved to be a natural medium for his folksy but pointed ruminations on topical matters. At one of the lowest points of the Great Depression, he took part in a national broadcast with President Herbert Hoover to kick off a nationwide unemployment relief campaign. Rogers praised Hoover's integrity and intentions, but also decried the tragedy of such hard times in a land of plenty: \"We'll hold the distinction of being the only nation in the history of the world that ever went to the poor house in an automobile,\" he observed. \"The potter's fields are lined with granaries full of grain. Now if there ain't something wrong in an arrangement like that, then this microphone here in front of me is—well, it's a cuspidor, that's all.\" The broadcast demonstrates the status Rogers had gained as a spokesperson for the \"common man,\" who used popular culture to satirize financial and political corruption, especially as the country went from the extravagant twenties into economic depression.

The song's lyrics underscored the irony of Depression-era American working class who had once built railroads and fought wars only to now find themselves waiting in bread lines. With its bittersweet melody and bold, unsentimental lyrics, this arresting anthem to America's \"forgotten man\" became a major hit. Recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee—both issued the same year—were best sellers and emphasized the song's strengths in different ways. Crosby's nuanced baritone played to the song's drama; his use of rubato during the verse being especially effective.

During this period, thousands of slave narratives were also collected on paper from by WPA workers, but these are the only known audio recordings of former slaves. As historian C. Vann Woodward said of the WPA narratives, these recordings \"represent the voices of the normally voiceless,\" but with all the nuances of expression that written transcriptions cannot reproduce. They recall aspects of slave life and culture, including family relations, work routines, songs, dances, and tales, as well as their relationship with masters, punishments, auctions, and escapes. They recount experiences of the Civil War, Emancipation, and Reconstruction. One interviewee worked for Confederate President Jefferson Davis, as did his father and grandfather.

Roosevelt are tied to singular events—such as the attack on Pearl Harbor—but many of his most influential addresses were actually made on otherwise mundane occasions in the 1930s such as on a tour of a flood control project in 1936, when he delivered the blistering \"I Hate War\" speech, anticipating World War II. Others reverberate in our time for different reasons, such as when he spoke on behalf of the campaign against polio, now nearly eradicated but a dreaded scourge in that era of which he was the disease’s most famous victim. His speeches are far more than sources for historical soundbites, they are defining political and social texts of their day that form a narrative of the 12 years of his presidency, and of an historical epoch.

(1934)\n\nThe acknowledged father of modern gospel music, Thomas A. Dorsey made only a handful of gospel recordings himself. Recording first as \"Georgia Tom\" and \"Barrelhouse Tom,\" Dorsey was a noted blues artist and composer during the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1932, he dedicated the remainder of his life exclusively to gospel music. In four sessions in 1932 and 1934, Dorsey recorded several songs for Vocalion, including his popular composition \"If I Could Hear My Mother Pray Again,\" which were released under his own name. His voice, although well-suited to his earlier blues and jazz recordings, was said to have lacked the qualities needed for gospel music and he made no further recordings, concentrating instead on songwriting and publishing.

(1934)\n\nSinger Lydia Mendoza (1916-2007) once said, \"It doesn't matter if it's a corrido, a waltz, a bolero, a polka or whatever. When I sing that song, I live that song.\" Mendoza had been performing and recording with her family's band since the late 1920s, and was only 16 when she recorded \"Mal Hombre,\" investing the song's bitter lyrics with an artistic maturity that belied her age: \"Cold-hearted man, your soul is so vile it has no name.\" \"Mal Hombre\" launched her solo career, her stark voice and graceful 12-string guitar lines resounding strongly with the Spanish-speaking audience of Texas. The Houston-born singer was soon known as \"La Alondra de la Frontera,\" The Lark of the Border.

(1934)\n\nThe cowboy vocal group The Sons of the Pioneers was formed in 1933 by Roy Rogers, Tim Spencer and Bob Nolan. The group became America's premier western singing group and remained so for decades. They still perform today with different singers. The Sons of the Pioneers are widely admired for their smooth and adventurous harmonies. Their songs serve as the foundation of non-traditional, popular cowboy music. \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" was one of the songs cut at the Sons' first recording session, and it became the group's theme song, beautifully evoking the cowboy's love of the land.

(1934)\n\n\"You're the Top\" is a work by composer/lyricist Cole Porter at the top of his form. Seamlessly, the words and music of this quintessential \"list song\" convey wit, exuberance, and charmingly high- and low-cultural references. This solo performance, by Porter, invites the listener to become part of Porter's universe and imagine the composer performing, much as he might have for friends on a luxury cruise or in his own Waldorf Astoria suite.

A radical populist, he proposed a \"Share the Wealth\" plan with the motto \"Every Man a King.\" The wealth was to be shared by increases in inheritance taxes which would \"guarantee a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home and automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences.\" In this 1934 radio speech, the Senator outlines his plan and explains why he no longer supports President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Selected for the 2003 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 50KB\n\nListen (MP3)\n\n\"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart.\" Patsy Montana. (1935)\n\nSinger Patsy Montana's signature song, \"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart,\" was written at a time in 1934 when she was feeling lonely and missing her boyfriend. Montana recorded the song a year later when Art Satherly, of ARC Records, needed one more song for a recording session with the Prairie Ramblers. Her song's lively, quick polka tempo and yodeling refrain, and Montana's exuberant delivery, resulted in it being requested at every performance; it became one of the first hits by a female country and western singer. A popular performer on the WLS radio program \"National Barn Dance,\" Montana was the soloist with the Prairie Ramblers, a group that successfully melded jazz and string band music. Montana's film appearance in a Gene Autry film, \"Colorado Sunset\" in 1939 introduced her to a wider audience, and her independent air, high-spirited personality, and singing style quickly secured her popularity as a singing cowgirl. Patsy Montana was named to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1996.

(1935)\n\nIn 1935, on their expedition to document rare North American birds, Arthur Allen and Peter Paul Kellogg of Cornell University recorded a pair of ivory-billed woodpeckers in an old-growth Louisiana swamp forest known as the Singer Tract. These recordings of the birds' calls and foraging taps are presently the last confirmed aural evidence of what was once the largest woodpecker species in the United States. The last universally accepted sighting of an ivory-bill occurred in 1944. However, since that time, many scientists believe there have been credible sightings of the species, suggesting the bird might not be extinct. These 1935 recordings have been vital to recent searches and have been used to train searchers on what to listen for. They have also been used to develop pattern-recognition software, enlisting computers to analyze new field recordings identifying similar sounds.

Lord, producer of the successful \"Seth Parker\" radio series. Capitalizing on the public's fascination with gangsters, Lord based his new show on true crime stories, going so far as to obtain the cooperation of the FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. \"G-Men,\" as the series was known initially, premiered on July 20, 1935, but the FBI's enthusiasm waned quickly and its cooperation diminished. Revised as \"Gang Busters,\" the show remained on the air until the late 1950s. The program's spectacular opening, which included sirens, police whistles, gunshots and tires screeching, inspired the slang expression, \"come on like gangbusters!\" Selected for the 2008 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 179KB)\n\nListen (MP3)\n\n\"La Chicharronera\" (single). Narciso Martinez and Santiago Almeida. (1936)\n\nMartinez and Almeida, two pioneers of the Tex-Mex conjunto music, introduced the classic accordion (Martinez) and bajo sexto (Almeida) combination on this, their first recording for Bluebird Records. Martinez was known as the \"Father of Conjunto Music\" and had a long career in Texas, performing from a huge repertoire of regionally popular dance tunes and styles including polkas, redovas, schottisches, waltzes, mazurkas, boleros, danzones and huapangos. Almeida developed the bajo sexto guitar as the distinctive accompanying instrument in the classic conjunto style. Their music exemplified the blending of Central European instruments and dance genres with those of Mexican Texas that had been going on for at least a generation before they made their first recordings. This conjunto sound remains popular in Tex-Mex music in an expanded and amplified form. Martinez and Almeida were later honored with the NEA's National Heritage Fellowship artist award in 1983 and 1993, respectively.
