        "text": "who is that Pamic who scored a hattrick?\n\nHe's the son of one ex-Croatian forward, Igor Pamic. His father was coaching a small Croatian team and he played there too, being their best player I believe. Some months ago Leverkusen signed him, but loaned him to Freiburg for the next season. He's a midfielder.\n\nOh, and even though he was only 18, he also played for the u-21 team of Croatia. I know him mostly from highlights, though.\n\nWell, the French are hosting the tournament and in the first two matches they won twice by a big margin, scoring 9 goals against the Netherlands and Austria.\n\nThey are #1 favorites to win this tournament and the Croatian boys gave their all today so I'm not sure how good will they look against the physically (much) stronger French kids.\n\nI still stand by my opinion. The french kids are all confident when it is early on but when things get tough they lose it, not so strong mentally, so for me home turf would be disadvantage.\n\nJust my thoughts but I think (and hope) that Croatia will make the final.\n\nA lot?\n\nNot really. It's only a couple of good players. If you're thinking about them going to other clubs aboard.\n\nNot sure if I got that right.\n\nMost of them either go abroad or retire. Not many talents appear at 16 or 18, because different players have different bodies, therefore they peak at different ages.\n\nPeople thinking that Messi will become the best in history because he was good since he was 20, watch him when he is 28, I bet my life that he will be a finished player.\n\nSo my point is, you can't judge a player he just needs to keep on practicing and improving. Italy is losing all youngsters because of stupidity. The future is fucked.\n\nMost of them either go abroad or retire. Not many talents appear at 16 or 18\n\nI don't think that's the issue, then.\n\nOnly a couple of good players leave Italy at the young age. I don't think it's fair, but you can tell that's the reason why it's everything falling apart. Over the past 2 years only 3 promising youth players left Italy so that's not a big number. One kid was from Lazio while the other one is Petrucci. I think there was another one but I'm not so sure.\n\nYet again, that's not the real issue. It's just that the clubs aren't treating them nicely and it's like they want to ruin them. I also don't blame those kids if they leave as they only want to play and get a chance which is NOT possible in Italy and which is NOT possible with Italian coaches. Who was giving them a shot? Nobody. Well, Mourinho did but he's not even Italian.\n\nThey send their best players on loan to Serie C4 clubs who later disappear. They keep loaning them out somewhere and ruin everything they worked for over the past 10 years. The whole system has to change in Italy but it has nothing to do with that rule, nothing.\n\nI don't think that's the issue, then.\n\nOnly a couple of good players leave Italy at the young age.
