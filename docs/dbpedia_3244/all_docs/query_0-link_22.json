        "text": "and now, for soemthing a bit different from Kinnik's football world:\n\nGreat football seasons: Serie A 1997-1998 season part 1â€‹\n\nWhen it comes to all-time great football seasons, many hardcore fans of the beautiful game would ppint out the 1997-1998 Serie A as the greatest ever season of club football. And they're hardly to blame: never has there been a concentration of the world's top footballers, all in their prime or close to it, competing in the same league across different teams. This season marked the peak of italian football. Almost every club had two superstars in their ranks, and every game were dramatic affairs full of twists and turns. Here's how it went down\n\nPRE-SEASON\n\nMassimo Morratti, Inter owner, continued in his free-spending ways in 1997, signing the like sof Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone, Auxerre's Taribo West and breaking the expensive goalkeeper record to snap up Jens Lehmann from UEFA Cup champions Schalke 04. Only a year after Inter broke the transfer record to bring Christian Vieri back to Italy from Atletico Madrid for $25 million following hsi exceptional 1995-1996, Morratti would break the world transfer record again, bringing in Ronaldo from Barcelona for $27 million to for a dream partnership with Vieri. Manager Roy Hodgeson now has all the tools needed to finally win that scudetto.\n\nAaron Winter from Lazio also arrives for depth in the midfield, while in players out Paul Ince would leave for Liverpool, while Davide Fontolan and Antonio Paganin would join Bologna, with Antonio reuniting with his brother Massimo at the latter club.\n\nINTER MILAN 1997-1998\n\nLehmann\n\nBergomi West Galante Pistone\n\nZanetti Berti Winter Simeone\n\nVieri Ronaldo\n\nMeanwhile, Juventus, after missing out on both Ronaldo and Milan's new star striker Fillipo Inzaghi, opted with a more under-the-radar approach in this transfer window, signing brazilian striker Giovanni Elber from VFB Stuttgart to partner Del Piero, while Gianluca Festa arrived from relegated cup double winners Middlesbrough in England to provide competition for Mark Iuliano and Andres Escobar, and Alessandro Birindelli from Empoli comes in as competition for Moreno Torricelli at right back.\n\nJUVENTUS 1997-1998\n\nPeruzzi\n\nBirindelli Festa/Escobar Iuliano Fortunato\n\nDeschamps\n\nDavids Conte\n\nZidane\n\nDel Piero Elber\n\nSubs: De Sanctis, Escobar/Festa, Torricelli, Corini, Vialli, Amoruso\n\nMilan, meanwhile, has Fabio Capello on the hot seat after finishing in a disappointing 11th place last season, with only surprise breakout star Filippo Inzaghi's 21 goals last season saving Milan from complete humiliation. Leonardo from Paris comes in along with youth products christian Abbiati, Massimo Ambrosini and Francesco Coco, looking to add some much needed youth in Milan.\n\nAC MILAN 1997-1998\n\nRossi\n\nPanucci Desaily Costacurta Maldini\n\nBoban Ambrosini Albertini Leonardo\n\nInzaghi Simone\n\nNotable bench players: Abbiati, Andre Cruz, Savicevic, Coco, Donadoni, Maini\n\nLazio, runner-ups in 1995-1996, saw Zdenek Zeman betraying them, going to FC Roma. To replace him, Sampdoria's coach Sven-Goran Eriksson arrives, while aaron winter leaves for Inter, replaced by sevilla's mattias Almeyda. Giuseppe Pancaro arrives from relegated Cagliari to provide competition for Jose Chamot at left back, while Alessandro Nesta is oermanently installed at center back alongside Giuseppe Favalli\n\nLAZIO ATHLETIC 1997-1998\n\nRoma/Fiori\n\nNero Nesta Favalli Pancaro\n\nFuser Almeyda Di Matteo Nedved\n\nBoksic Signori\n\nBench: Roma/Fiori, Gottardi, Chamot, Marcolin, Di Vaio, Lombardo, Casiraghi\n\nFC Roma pulled off a huge coup by snapping up manager Zdenek Zeman from fierce rivals Lazio, hopimg to turn aroudn their fortunes and finally compete for the top 4. Captain and icon Giuseppe Giannini was sold to Napoli, with young phenom Francesco Totti now the new leader of Roma goig forward, inheriting the captain's armband. A big squad overhaul, as well, as longtime stalwarts like Moriero, Statuto, Cervone and Annoni all left the club, with the biggest new signings being Bayer Leverkusen's Paulo Sergio and french versatile fullback Vincent Candela to provide competition for Amedeo Carboni and Cafu, along with Eusebio Di Francesco from Piacenza completing the midfield with Di Biaggio and Tommassi, while Fabrizio Del Moro\n\nFC ROMA 1997-1998\n\nCudicini\n\nCafu Aldair Petruzzi Carboni\n\nDi Biaggio\n\nTommassi Di Francesco\n\nPaulo Sergi Totti\n\nBalbo\n\nBench: Chimenti, Lanna, Candela, Gautieri, Vagner, Del Vecchio, Dal Morro\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's Parma, the reigning italian champions, got even better in the off-season, with the addition in .idfield of Paulo Souza of european champions Dortmund to partner Dino Baggio, a transfer made possible thansk to Nestor Sensini's Italian citizenship. The cheesemakers, named so due to their sponsorship by local dairy giants Parmalat, has not only defending their title in mind, but also win the champions league to win every single trophy possible in only 7 years.\n\nPARMA 1997-1998\n\nBuffon\n\nThuram Sensini Couto Bennarivo\n\nFigo D. Baggio Souza Fiore\n\nChiesa Crespo\n\nBench: Nista, Appoloni, Franceschini, Crippa, Giunti, Melli, Brolin\n\nFianlly, the last of the favorites, Trappatoni's Fiorentina, only added one player to their already potent squad, with Aston Villa's Andrei Kanchelskis cpming in as a luxurious supersub, while Cristiano Zanetti was promoted to provide depth in their stacked midfield.\n\nFIORENTINA 1997-1998\n\nToldo\n\nPadalino Malusci Amoruso\n\nSerena Di Livio Effenberg Schwarz\n\nRui Costa\n\nBatistuta Baggio\n\nBench: Mareggini, Firicano, Bettarrini, Carnasciali, Kanchelskis, Robbiati, Piacentini\n\nAmong the main dsrkhorses, Marcelo Lippi's Napoli standout among them with the most complete team, with the defense of Cannavaro, Ferrara and Ayala being the best back three in all of football, along with a good midfield boosted by the arrival of Mario Stanic as the new right wingback. Up front, il maestro Gianfranco Zola plays alongside Daniel fonseca, with Francesco Baiano and Claudio Bellicci providing really good depth off the bench. Fresh off winning the coppa last year, Napoli looks to win their first european trophy since Maradona's days in the late 80s\n\nNAPOLI 1997-1998\n\nTaglialatella\n\nFerrara Cannavaro Ayala\n\nStanic Rincon Boghossian Pecchia Tarantino\n\nZola Fonseca\n\nNotable bench guys: Giannini, Baiano, Bellucci\n\nAlberto Zaccheroni's Udinese, who fonished on the podium last year, is also a team to watch, with a crowd pleasing offensive style and the towering gemran marksman bierhoff, with new signings giovanni bia and the returning statuto offering solidity that this team needed, along with belgian midfield general Johan Walem.\n\nUDINESE 1997-1998\n\nTurci\n\nBertotto Bia Calori\n\nHelveg Giannicheda Walem Jorgensen\n\nLocatelli\n\nBierhoff Amoroso\n\nNotable bench players: Gago, Statuto, Poggi\n\nSampdoria, once one fo the top teams in euroep in the early 90s, now looks set to finish their rebuidl and compete, although it woudl be without their former coach Eriksson, who left for Lazio. The veterans Jugovic Mihaljovic, Pagliuca, Mannini and Mancini will mix with the exciting young tlaents Veron, Karmebeu, Sachetti, Seedorf and Montella, while the returning coach Boskov reinforced the bench with players like Pierre Laigle from Lens, Castellini from Perugia and Jurgen Klinsmann as a free agent from Bayern Munich\n\nSAMPDORIA 1997-1998\n\nPagliuca\n\nMannini Sachetti Mihaljovic Balleri\n\nSeedorf Karembeu Veron Jugovic\n\nMancini Montella\n\nBench: Ambrosio, castellini, Pesaresi, Laigle, Scarchilli, Klinsmann, Salsano\n\nFinally, the last darkhorse is Torino FC, who managed to rebuild their squad pretty well with the money gained from Christian Vieri's shock transfer to Atletico Madrid in 1995, with Portuguese winger Sergio Conceicao proving a fruitful signing on the right wing, while Samuel Kuffour from the academy revealed himself as a great defender alongside Falcone and Chilean Marcelo Salas proving to be a more than adequate replacement for Vieri up front.\n\nNow, Nevio Scala has spalshed the cahs on Midldesbrpugh's brazilian dynamo Juninho Paulista an the new number 10 to provide passes to Salas and Lentini, and Torino are targetting the european places.\n\nTORINO 1997-1998\n\nMarchegianni\n\nPessotto Kuffour Falcone/Mussi Milanese\n\nVenturin Cois\n\nConceicao Juninho Lentini\n\nSalas\n\nThe teams fighting for mid-table and avoiding relegation also boasts soem good players, with those fights looking to be very tough, especially with the arrivaks of Atletico's Juan Esnaider at Vicenza, Dario Simic and Nwankwo Kanu to Atalanta and the return of Fabrizio Ravanelli to his hometown club Perugia, along with a midifeld prospect by the name of Andrea Pirlo running the Brescia midfield. Finally, Bologna is forming a team full of experienced Serie A players, with swede Kenneth Andersson and argentine Julio Ricardo Cruz leading the attack alongside Igor Kolivanov\n\nBOLOGNA 1997-1998\n\nAntonioli\n\nTarozzi M.

While success was scarce, Rostocker did manage to win two Gauligas during the National Socialist era of Germany, and the club's best finish in the German Football Championship was a single Qualifying round, and a first round performance in the Tschammerpokal, later to be known as the DFB Pokal. After the war though, all of the clubs in Rostock, and to a larger extent in all of the East Soviet Occupation zone were closed down, with many cities having to earn new representatives. Some got lucky and retained their history, like Dresdner SC, while others started from scratch. Rostock was one of the latter ones, and the city's football clubs were usually wallowing in the District competitions of the Mecklenburg region, even when the Occupied zones merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nThe original crest of Rostocker FC\n\nâ€‹\n\nThe merger (1954-1963)\n\nWith the Rostocker football clubs struggling in the lower tiers of German football, talks began about a merger of the clubs all over the city and the district area. Hansa's history as a football club began on November 11 1954, when an agreement was settled between lower tier sides TSV and Rostocker FC, with the team being forced to start from the Amateurliga, and work its way up to the Eastern Oberliga from the 1955 season onwards, with Oswald Pfau as their first coach. It was a long journey, but Hansa's selection of players from all over the Mecklenburg region helped the club rise all the way to the regional top of German Football, with the Volksstadion seeing the Pomeranians compete with the big dogs of the eastern regions. In honour of the historic Hansanian league, the new team that would go on to represent Rostock would be named Hansa, and the insignia would feature the Mecklenburg dragon on the sails of the Kogge - a traditional ship of the region that sailed the Baltic sea. With the 1955/56 season in the Amateurliga being Hansa's debut campaign, the club would quickly rise up the ranks to the Bezirksliga, until finally reaching the Oberliga Ost in 1958. Led by Walter Fritzch, Hansa played attractive, attacking football that made the little team a thorn on their enemy's side, and Hanseaten would slowly improve as time passed, with the club's best results being a 5th place in the 1959/60 Oberliga season, and a semi-final appearance in the 1960 DFB Pokal. Following the introduction of the Bundesliga in 1962, great efforts were made for Hansa to try and qualify for the new Federal League for its inaugural season in 1962/63, and sensationally, they did so along with Carl Zeiss Jena. As one of the 16 Teams to play in the inaugural Bundesliga Season.\n\nThe first Bundesliga season\n\nâ€‹\n\nAdventure in the Bundesliga (1962-1970)\n\nWith a team consisting of Wolfgang Barthels; Jurgen Heinsch; Herbert Pankau and Klaus-Dieter Seehaus, Hansa embarked on their first season in the Bundesliga along with 15 other teams. The first season, while not ideal, did see Hansa remain in the league by a single point, escaping relegation in front of Saarbrucken and Prussia Munster. The next couple of seasons were relatively similiar, with Fritzch's expertise making Hansa a rather problematic squad for any team that would play against them, and his last year with them did prove to be Hansa's best results in the Bundesliga, as the Kogge finished 8th. However, with Fritzch's departure came a steady decline, and Hansa soon enough fought for relegation, where they managed to escape by the virtue of Nurnberg imploding. Another steady finish in the top 10 in 1969 saw Hansa get invited to the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, where they even managed to reach the Round of 16 and take it to Inter Milan, winning 2-1 in the first leg on a packed Volksstation.\n\nHansa's first Bundesliga team\n\nâ€‹\n\nUnfortunately, this euphoric tenure in Europe exhausted the limited number of players that Hansa had, and the Koggen tragically finished bottom of the Bundesliga in the 1969/70 season, accumulating a pitiful 21 points, 7 wins, 7 draws, and 20 losses.\n\nThe struggle (1970-1991)\n\nFollowing the club's descent to the Regionalliga, Hansa struggled in the Eastern section of the competition for several years. However, by the mid 70s the club was consistently finishing in the lower half of the league table and was relegated to the feared Amateurliga for a single season on three occasions late in the decade. From 1977 to 1981, Hansa continued on to struggle against the other teams in the competition, with the club switching coaches every other year. The appointment of Jurgen Heinsch in 1981 did provide some consistency, but the club still couldn't even reach the top half of the 2nd Bundesliga table, eventually falling back to the Oberliga (Now a third tier in German Football) in 1985. This was the final straw, and Heinsch was demoted from his job as a coach, and Werner Voight was appointed, who just came fresh from leading Berliner FC to its only Bundesliga title, and also in helping out Andreas Thom develop into a World Star player for the German National Team. Two seasons back in the Oberliga saw Hansa win the competition and once again qualify for the 2nd Bundesliga, where Voigt began to develop the squad for the next step. This ardous process in itself would last for almost five years, with Hansa's results getting increasingly better with every season. Finally, in 1990/91 Hansa accumulated a great challenge for the top of the table, and with much hard work ended up winning the 2nd Bundesliga, with Henri Fuchs the top scorer for the club, along with the efforts of Michael Spies, . That same year, Hansa shocked all of Germany to make it to the DFB Pokal finals, and they took the game against Werder Bremen all the way to the penalties, where Hansa became victorious.\n\nâ€‹\n\nGolden generation and the legend of '96 (1991-2008)\n\nHansa's return to the Bundesliga was one of dreams, as the Ostseestadters enjoyed a phenomenal 1991/92 season, where they were at one point even leading the standings, before slowly slipping down the order. Nevertheless, a promising 7th was followed by a series of fruitful seasons which saw Hansa sailing in the Bundesliga, with the club reaching the dizzying heights of 2nd, behind a dominating Borussia Dortmund. The attacking trio of Henri Fuchs, Stefan Meinlich and Jens Wahl helped the club achieve the impossible and overtake Schalke, Leverkusen and Hamburg during the latter stages of the season, and Hansa achieved a miraculous second, which has later become known as \"die Legende auf '96\". With this incredible success, Hansa would soon gain a new stadium thanks to its efforts, and the new and fresh Ostseestadion was built before the 2000/01 season, where the Ostseestadters would go on to play. During this era, Hansa also saw the emergence of future National team player Oliver Neuville, who helped out Hansa reach further respectable results.\n\nHansa's most iconic match of its history came in its first year in the Bundesliga,\n\nwhere they Bayern 2-1 away\n\nâ€‹\n\nThe later half of the 90s saw Hansa consistently finishing the the middle parts of the Bundesliga, with the club garnering a cult following and regular appearances in European competitions. Another great showing occured in 1998, where Hansa finished 2nd once again thanks to the goalscoring prowess of Carsten Jancker, and a year later 8th which was enough to enter the Intertoto Cup, but Hansa made that season even sweeter when the Kogge managed to once again lift the DFB Pokal, this time against Berliner FC. With another Pokal win in 2002/03, it seemed that life was good for good old Hansa, with the club achieving another solid 5th in 2001. However, results began to deteriorate by the beginning of the 2000s, and the club had seemingly begun to stagnate. With all of this success, complacency had taken over the club, and Hansa Rostock began to lose the players that made up its golden generation and what came after it. Unfortunately, by the time it became clear that something was rotten in Hansa - it was too late, and the Unsinkables had finally sunk into the 2nd Bundesliga. The players broke down on the pitch during the final leg of the season, where Hansa needed to win against Werder Bremen in order to stay up, but it was to no avail, and Hansa sunk with a 3-0 loss.\n\nâ€‹\n\nReturn to the Bundesliga and present day (2008-present)\n\nFollowing the fall, Hansa would take three seasons to return to the Bundesliga, where the Kogge have managed to remain in the top flight of the German Football. There have been hard times, and the club risked to go down twice in the past 10 years, but Hansa has managed to remain a stable side in the Bundesliga following their encouraging 5th place in 2014. Further signs of improvement occured in 2018/19, when Hansa managed to outplay Werder Bremen to achieve a memorable comeback victory, resulting in a dramatic 3-2 finish in the 88th minute thanks to Pascal Breier. A return to the European scene had already begun in 2015, when Hansa played in the Group Stage of the Europa League. The Unsinkables might not have potential to challenge for the title, but they are certainly able to remain a solid side in the Bundesliga.\n\nâ€‹\n\nâ€‹\n\nAttachments\n\nSnimka zaslona (405).png\n\nName: Newcastle United\n\nCity: Newcastle\n\nNicknames: The Magpies\n\nHome ground: Bobby Robson Stadium\n\nattendance: 80,902\n\nLeague: Premier League\n\nHonours:\n\nDomestic:\n\nLeague\n\nFirst Division / Premier League : 1904-05, 1906-07 , 1908-09 , 1926-1927 , 2011-2012 , 2013-2014 , 2017-2018 , 2018-2019 , 2020-2021 , 2021-2022 , 2022-2023\n\nSecond Division / First Division / Championship : 1964â€“65, 1992â€“93\n\nCups\n\nFA Cup : 1909-10 , 1923-24 , 1931-32 , 1950-51 , 1951-52 , 1954-55 , 2010-2011 , 2018-2019 , 2022-2023\n\nEFL Cup : 2010-2011 , 2013-2014 , 2015-2016 , 2017-2018 , 2018-2019 , 2019-2020 , 2020-2021\n\nFA Charity Shield\n\nWinners: 1909,2012,2014,2018,2019,2021,2022,2023\n\nInter-Cities Fairs Cup\n\nWinners: 1968â€“69\n\nEuropa League\n\nWinners : 2009-2010\n\nChampions League\n\nWinners : 2015-2016 , 2020-2021\n\nThe creation (1881â€“1895)â€‹\n\nThe first record of football being played on Tyneside dates from 3 March 1877 at Elswick Rugby Club. Later that year, Newcastle's first association football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of Byker in November 1881. They won their first match 5â€“0 against Elswick Leather Works 2nd XI.[4] The team was renamed Newcastle East End F.C. in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in Stanley, County Durham.\n\nShortly after this, another Byker side, Rosewood FC, merged with East End to form an even stronger side. Meanwhile, across the city, West End Cricket Club began to take an interest in football and in August 1882, they formed Newcastle West End F.C. West End played their early football on their cricket pitch, but in May 1886, the club moved into St James' Park.[5] The two clubs became rivals in the Northern League. In 1889, Newcastle East End became a professional team, before becoming a limited company the following March.[6]\n\nWest End soon became the city's premier club. East End were anxious not to be left behind and lured Tom Watson into becoming the club secretary/manager in the close season of 1888 and from that point, never looked back; Watson made several good signings, especially from Scotland, and the Heaton club went from strength to strength, while West End's fortunes slipped dramatically.\n\nThe region's first league competition was formed in 1889 and the FA Cup began to cause interest. Ambitious East End turned professional in 1889, a huge step for a local club, and in March 1890, they made an even more adventurous move by becoming a limited company with capital of 1,000 pounds in ten shilling notes. During the spring of 1892, in a season during which their results were at an all-time low, and in which they had lost to their bitter rivals, East End, five times, West End found themselves in serious trouble. They approached East End with a view to a take over, the directors having decided that the club could no longer continue.\n\nWhat actually happened was that West End wound up, while some of its players and most of its backroom staff joined East End. East End also took over the lease on St. James' Park in May 1892.[5]\n\nWith only one senior club in the city for fans to support, development of the club was much more rapid. Despite being refused entry to the Football League's First Division at the start of the 1892â€“93 season, they were invited to play in their new Second Division. However, with no big names playing in the Second Division, they turned down the offer and remained in the Northern League, stating \"gates would not meet the heavy expenses incurred for travelling\".[5][6] In a bid to start drawing larger crowds, Newcastle East End decided to adopt a new name in recognition of the merger.[5] Suggested names included Newcastle F.C., Newcastle Rangers, Newcastle City and City of Newcastle, but Newcastle United was decided upon on 9 December 1892, to signify the unification of the two teams.[5][7] The name change was accepted by the Football Association on 22 December, but the club was not legally constituted as Newcastle United Football Club Co. Ltd. until 6 September 1895.[6] At the start of the 1893â€“94 season, Newcastle United were once again refused entry to the First Division and so joined the Second Division, along with Liverpool and Woolwich Arsenal.[5] They played their first competitive match in the division that September against Woolwich Arsenal, with a score of 2â€“2\n\nThe first glory era (1895â€“1914)â€‹\n\nTurnstile numbers were still low, and the incensed club published a statement claiming \"The Newcastle public do not deserve to be catered for as far as professional football is concerned\". However, eventually figures picked up by 1895â€“96, when 14,000 fans watched the team play Bury. That season Frank Watt became secretary of the club, and he was instrumental in promotion to the First Division for the 1898â€“99 season. However, they lost their first game 4â€“2 at home to Wolves and finished their first season in thirteenth place.[6]\n\nIn 1903â€“04, the club built up a promising squad of players, and went on to dominate English football for almost a decade, the team known for their \"artistic play, combining team-work and quick, short passing\". Newcastle started to purchase talented players, especially from Scotland, and soon had a squad to rival all of England. With players like Colin Veitch, Jackie Rutherford, Jimmy Lawrence and Albert Shepherd, Newcastle had a team of international talent. Bill McCracken, Jimmy Howie, Peter McWilliam and Andy Aitken were also household names in their day. Long after his retirement, defender Peter McWilliam said \"The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them, and further more, beat them at a trot\".\n\nNewcastle United went on to win the League on three occasions during the 1900s: in 1904â€“05, 1906â€“07 and 1908â€“09.[6][8] Newcastle reached five FA Cup finals in the years leading up to World War I. In 1904â€“05, they nearly did the double, losing to Aston Villa in the 1905 FA Cup Final. They were beaten again the following year by Everton in the 1906 FA Cup Final. They reached the final again in 1908 where they lost to Wolves. In 1908 the team suffered a record 9â€“1 home defeat to local rivals Sunderland in the league but still won that season's league title. They finally won the FA Cup in 1910 when they beat Barnsley in the final. They lost again the following year in the final against Bradford City.[6)\n\nInterwar success (1919â€“1939)â€‹\n\nThe team returned to the FA Cup final in 1924, in the second final held at the then new Wembley Stadium. They defeated Aston Villa, winning the club's second FA Cup.[6] Three years later they won the First Division championship a fourth time in 1926â€“27. Record signing & Scottish international centre-forward Hughie Gallacher, one of the most prolific goal scorers in the club's history, captained the championship-winning team. Other key players in this period were Neil Harris, Stan Seymour and Frank Hudspeth. Seymour was to become an influential figure for the next 40 years as player, manager and director.\n\nIn 1930, Newcastle United came close to relegation, and at the end of the season Gallacher left the club for Chelsea, and at the same time Andy Cunningham became the club's first team manager. In 1931â€“32, the club won the FA Cup a third time in the infamous 'Over the Line' final. United won the game 2â€“1 after scoring a goal following a cross from Jimmy Richardson which appeared to be hit from out of play - over the line. There were no action replays then and the referee allowed the goal, a controversial talking point in FA Cup history.\n\nNewcastle boasted master players like Sam Weaver and Jack Allen, as well as the first player-manager in the top division in Scottish international Andy Cunningham. But at the end of the 1933â€“34 season, the team were relegated to the Second Division after 32 seasons in the First. Cunningham left as manager and Tom Mather took over.[6] Amazingly in the same season as they fell into the Second Division, United defeated Liverpool 9â€“2 and Everton 7â€“3 within the space of a week.\n\nThe club found it difficult to adjust to the Second Division and were nearly further relegated in the 1937â€“38 season, when they were spared on goal averages.\n\nNew ownership and Shiekh Mansour Takeover (2007â€“2010)â€‹\n\nAs the 2007 season drew to a close, St James Holdings Limited, the bid vehicle of billionaire businessman Mike Ashley, was reported to be in the process of buying the club.[73] Ashley successfully acquired Sir John Hall's majority stake in the club in May 2007,[74] leaving many to believe chairman Freddie Shepherd was set to depart after stepping down as chairman, should Ashley acquire more than 50 percent, which would see Shepherd no longer in control of the club and Ashley able to replace the board.[75] Shepherd dismissed all speculation and proceeded to appoint ex-Bolton Wanderers boss Sam Allardyce as Newcastle manager,[76] but eventually met with Mike Ashley and the board on 29 May.[77] On 7 June 2007, Shepherd ended his 11 years with the club after Mike Ashley accepted his bid to buy his shares and in his role as chairman of the board, also having Shepherd advise the remaining shareholders to sell to Ashley.[78] Ashley then announced he would be delisting the club from the London Stock Exchange upon completion of the takeover.[79] The club officially ceased trading on the Stock Exchange as of 8 am on 18 July 2007 at 5p a share.[80] Ashley brought in lawyer Chris Mort as the new club \"deputy chairman\".[81]\n\nDespite signing and building a seemingly strong squad,[82] Sam Allardyce soon became widely unpopular with fans and players alike,[83][84] and was surprisingly sacked by Ashley halfway through his first season after underwhelming results and pressure from the fans.[85] Ashley, however, defended his decision to sack Allardyce, stating he made a mistake in not appointing his own choice of manager before the season started.[86]\n\nKevin Keegan then made a sensational surprise return as manager.[87] His return had an instant impact on club ticket sales as he sat with the fans, Mike Ashley and Chris Mort for the FA Cup replay 4â€“1 win against Stoke City.[88] Following his return, Keegan had a disappointing first ten games back, with the club not winning a single game until his decision to include strikers Obafemi Martins, Michael Owen and Mark Viduka into a 4â€“3â€“3 formation, which saw the club back on goal-scoring and winning form [89] and eventually finishing 12th in 2007â€“08.[90] In May Keegan met with Mike Ashley and Director of Football Dennis Wise after he had suggested Champions League qualification was out of Newcastle United's reach and expressed dissatisfaction with the board's financial backing.[91] Ashley was battling reports that he had lost hundreds of millions of pounds in a disastrous attempt to rescue bank HBOS.[92] leading to fan fury and protests around St James' Park, with fans accusing Ashley and club executives Dennis Wise, Tony Jimenez and Derek Llambias of false promises to Keegan and put newcastle into debts\n\nFollowing after Ashley lost hundreds of millions of pounds in disaster attempt to rescue the bank,Ashley released a statement to the club's fans that in fear of his and his families reputation and safety, he was placing the club for sale\n\nThen, in July 2008, the club was purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. and Keegan was Sacked and been Replaced by Mancini,The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for Â£32.5 million.[29] Performances were not a huge improvement on the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing sixth place, qualfying for Europa League 2009-2010 Season. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over Â£100 million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo TourÃ©, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez and Joleon Lescott.[30] Newcastle finished the season in Fourth position in the Premier League, Qualfying the Champions League for first time in history since 2003 and Won Europa League beating Atletico by 2-1\n\nâ€‹\n\nName: Manchester United Football Club\n\nCity: Manchester\n\nHome grounds: Old Trafford\n\nAttendance: 74,310\n\nLeague: Football League First Division\n\nHONORS\n\nDOMESTIC:\n\nFirst division: 1907-1908, 1910-1911, 1955-1956,1956-1957,1957-1958, 1958-1959, 1966-1967, 1993-1994, 1996-1997, 2000-2001, 2006-2007\n\nSecond division: 1935-1936, 1974-1975\n\nFA Cup: 1908-1909, 1942-1943, 1947-1948, 1956-1957, 1957-1958, 1962-1963, 1991-1992, 1995-1996, 1998-1999\n\nLeague cup: 1991-1992, 2005-2006, 2022-2023\n\nEUROPEAN\n\nEuropean Cup/Champions League: 1967-1968, 1999-2000, 2007-2008\n\nUEFA Cup: 1998-1999\n\nCup winners cup: 1963-1964, 2006-2007\n\nManchester United was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football club in 1878 by employees of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway company. The team played initially against other company teams, but they played their fjrst recorded match on november 20th 1880, where they lost 6-0 to the bolton Wanderers reserve team.\n\nIn 1892, the league which Newton played in, the football alliance, merged with the football league, meaning the team played in the first division, only to be relegated two years later and going through a financial crisis at the turn of the century. In 1902, after receiving a wind-up order, captain Harry Stafford, future club president John Henry Davies and two other businessmen each invested money into the club to keep it running, switching to the name Manchester United.\n\nâ€‹\n\nMan Utd's 1902-1903 team photo\n\nUnder Ernest Mangnall, Man U got promoted to the first division in 1906 and, omly two years later, the club won its first league title, followed by an FA Cup win the following year. A second league title would follow in 1911, but Mangnall would join Man City in the ensuing off-season.\n\nAfter the great war, Man Utd got relegated in 1922, which would start the club's most unstable period as they became a yo-yo club for a decade and almost going bankrupt if it wasn't for James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club in 1931, culminating in united going back up to the first division in 1936 and winning the FA Cup during the war years in 1943.\n\nâ€‹\n\nSir Matt Busby\n\nAfter the second world war ended, Matt Busby took over the club, demanding unprecedented control over the club's day-to-day activities and transfer dealings. Another FA Cup win arrived in 1948, followed by close runner up finishes in the league. In the 50s, led by a squad with an average age of 22, dubbed \"The Busby Babes\" by the media, Man Utd would win 4 league titles in a row from 1956 to 1959, including two consecutive doubles in 57 and 58, led by youngsters Bobby Charlton and Duncan Edwards, after losing in the semi-finals to Barcelona in the 1956-1957 europena cup, Man Utd went all the way to the final, defeating swedish side Norkopping and the mighty AC Milan before losing to Real Madrid in Brussels. The following year, United lost in the quarter-finals to Atletico Madrid 4-1 on aggregate.\n\nThe Busby Babes, in their match against Norkopping\n\nThe 1960s would see Man U's dominance significantly evaporate, as the english game became the most competitive footballing landscape in europe. Busby added young irishman George best and scottish striker Denis Law in the squad, forming a big four with Duncan Edwards and Bobby Charlton, leading to the club winning the FA Cup in 1963 and the cup winners cup the following year. Whiel they would be beaten by fierce rivals Leeds United and liverpool in 1965 amd 1966, the big four's dominance carried united to the 1967 league title and, the following year, the club's first ever european cup agaisnt Eusebio's Benfica in 1968.\n\nâ€‹\n\nGeorge Best\n\nHowever, the club would find themselves be overtaken by Leeds at the start of the 70s, and a nasty row between Busby and George Best prompted the latter to join brian clough's Derby County and win the 1972 and 1975 league titles, while United, on the day where their fierce rivals Leeds would win the league in 1974, would find themselves relegated to the second division, signaling the end of the matt busby era.\n\nthe darkest day in club history\n\nUnited would be back to the first division in 1975, although as a shadow of their former selves, only being content with mid-table and occasional top six finishes until 1981, when Ron Atkinsson of West Brom was hired, bringing with him Laurie Cunningham and future captain Bryan Robson.\n\nBryan Robson, practicing for the nutcracker suite.â€‹\n\nDespite united finally playing lien a top team again under atkinsson, success was scarce, with two FA Cups lost in 1983 and 1985 to Brighton and Liverpool, respectively, while the club almost finished in relegation again in 1986, prompting Atkinsson's sacking.\n\nThings didn't really get better under former aberdeen coach Alex Ferguson, and after a defeat to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley, he would be sacked in the summer to make way for England's world cup winning coach Bobby Robson.\n\nThe saviour arrives\n\nRobson's first transfer window sees him bringing in his midfield general from the england squad Paul Ince from West Ham United and Oxford's Full back Denis Irwin before proceeding with United's first ever foreign player in midfielder/defender Gheorghe Popescu from Romania. While they would go trophyless in his first season in charge, the club played much better football, finishing just outside the european places.\n\nThe following year saw the arrival of former soviet right winger Andrei Kanchelskis and the emergence of prospects Lee Sharpe and Ryan Giggs. In the league, they were right in the middle of a tense title race with Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United, which was won by their fierce rivals, but man u finished as runner-up, along with winning their first major honors in decades by achieving the domestic cup double.\n\n1992-1993 saw hope in the united fanbase for the first time in a while, for they truly believed that Robson would lead them to their first league title since 1967, especially after signing Hearts and Denmark's goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and signing 1992 cup winners cup champions Nottingham's Teddy Sheringham up front.\n\nIn yet another crazy title race, United went down the wire with Wednesday, Aston Villa and the surprise champions Norwich City, finishing runner-ups again, while they would be eliminated from both domestic cups and, in the cup winners cup, they would be stunned 6-2 by Spartak Moscow, who would lose to finalists Royal Antwerp in the semi-finals.\n\nâ€‹\n\n1993-1994 would end up finally being the year for Manchester United. Despite a really strong challenge from both Shearer and Le Tissier's Southampton and Alex Ferguson's Aston Villa led by the duo of Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke, Sir Bobby and his crew, led by the midfield generals popescu and Ince, the strike partnership of Sheringham and Mark Hughes, the emergence of Ryan Giggs and Kanchelskis on the wings and an imperial Schmeichel in front of goal, emerged as champions of england for the first time since 1967. It would prove to be a fitting end to bryan robson's career, despite the disappointing exit to Oldham Atheltic in the FA Cup semi-final that same year.\n\n1994-1995, however, would see Man Utd disappoint in both domestic and european competition. Despite gaining Norwich's Chris Sutton for Â£5 million, the most expensive transfer in british history at the time, as long term replacement for Mark Hughes, and Sutton's 15 goals and Sheringham's 18, the red devils would slip out of the title race between Fergie's Villa, the surrprising nottingham and the soon-to-be-unstoppable Southampton of Shearer, Le Tissier and Kenny Dalglish by late winter due to defensive issues and injuries. Said injuries cost them in the champions league, for Bobby was forced to play many young talents from the academy, who won the 1992 FA youth cup, with the likes of the brothers Phil and Gary Neville, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and a young heartrob named David Beckham all making their debuts in both the league and europe, where Man Utd would be eliminated by the spanish champions Deportivo La Coruna on the last matchday of their group via a 3-1 correction.\n\nâ€‹\n\nimage comes from the TV series class of 92: full time\n\nSaid youngsters, whom formed what was dubbed the \"class of 92\" alongside Ryan Giggs, performed rather well given the circumstances, however, which prompted Sir Bobby to make some bold moves in the 1995 off-season: gone were paul Ince to Inter Milan, Kanchelskis to Aston Villa and even long time club icon Mark Hughes to Chelsea, with Popescu moving back to his natural position at Center Back alongside Gary Pallister with Butt and Scholes now occupying the midfield. Such an unusual transfer window was criticized by the media, especially match of the day pundit and former Liverpool captain Alan Hansen, who stated that Robson and Man Utd won't win anything with kids.\n\nThe class of 92 shut the doubters up in the best way possible: proving it on the pitch. They added some much needed fresh legs to the side, and Popescu moving back to center back alongside Pallister acutally solved the defensive issues of last season. All this meant that Sir Bobby and his kids became surprise contenders for the 1995-1996 first division title, with a tense 4-horse title race where they rivaled the likes of Fergie's Aston Villa, the young liverpool side led by Cantona and Robbie Fowler and Kevin Keegan and his million dollar entertainers at Newcastle United, with les ferdinand, Roy Keane, free agent David Ginola and world record signing Alan Shearer. The race for the title would go all the way to thr final weeks, where manchester's lack of experience would prove fatal as theybwould end up in a very respectable 3rd behind Villa and champions Newcastle.\n\nHowever, the class of 92's emergence came in the FA Cup final, where a tense game was won by a sheringham volley from Beckham's shot hitting the cross bar to win it for Man Utd to win the cup. Sir Bobby showed that, yes, you can win with kids.\n\nStrengthened by much needed depth signings in the 1996 off season with norwegians Ronnie Johnsen and Ole Gunnar Solksjaer coming in, the young united squad, now with a year of experience under their belt, would tear up the first division, ending up as league champions with 7 points ahead of reigning champions Newcastle. In the Cup Winners Cup, Man Utd went all the way to the semi-finals, where they would unfortunately lose to winners Paris.\n\n1997-1998 would see United, now with Henning Berg replacing Gary Pallister, fight valiantly with Cheis Sutton's 18 goals, but ultimately fail against Johan Cruyff's total football revolution at Arsenal and go trophyless.\n\nRobson would then release the checkbook, as he made high profile transfers from Holland, with Jaap Stam and ruud Van Nistelroy, both coming from PSV Eindhoven, strengthening the squad so as to fight on all fronts. While they would lose the league to the surprising Chelsea of David O'Leary, they would win the FA Cup after a legendary final where Ryan Giggs ram down the entire left wing to score the cup winning goal, while in the UEFA Cup, they would overcome a 2-0 deficit to Juventus thanks to an incredible performance by Gheorghe Popescu to head to the final, where they would be led by Bayern Munich 1-0 until injury time, where Giggs and Solksjaer would score two late goals to snatch the win and head to the champions league in 1999-2000, where, with Edwin Van der Sar replacing the departing Peter Schmeichel, they would overcome the likes of Boa Vista, Lazio and Bayern Munich again in the final to win their second ever european cup.\n\nWhile they would surrender the 1999-2000 league title to their fierce rivals leeds united and their former manager Alex Ferguson, the red devils, now with the class of 92 in their prime, along with Van Nistelrooy's goalscoring, Teddy Sheringhma's surprise ressurgence and some much needed defensive depth in academy graduates John O'Shea, Quinton Fortune and Wes Brown, would take part in and win the crazy 5-horse race of the 2000-2001 first division against Leeds, Arsenal, Jupp Heynckes's Liverpool and the surprising Ipswich Town, Bobby Robson's former club.\n\nThe latter, after winning almost every trophy imaginable with the club, announced his departure in the 2001 off-season, to realise his dream of managing his boyhood club Newcastle United, with Lazio's championship-winning coach Sven-Goran Eriksson replacing him for the 2001-2002 season.\n\nThat off-season would see a slight overhaul of the squad by Eriksson. Sheringham left for Tottenham, Popescu left for Lecce in Italy, Chris Sutton was sold to Celtic for Â£6 million and Jaap Stam was surprisingly sold to Leeds for Â£15 million, with Wes Brown and John O'Shea now the new center back pairing meaning that 8 of the Man U starting 11 come from the academy. The three non-academy players being Van Der Sar, Van Nistelrooy and the new Â£21 million signing of Eriksson's former Lazio striker Marcelo Salas, spent using the money from the sales of Sutton and Stam.\n\nDespite this strong squad, eriksson's first three seasons at United were trophyless, as they witnessed Cruyff's Arsenal and Fergie's Leeds win the next three league titles, with a defeat in the 2003 league cup final to leeds proving especially woeful, since Jaap Stam ended up being the defender Leeds needed to get back on top.\n\nThings would turn around for Eriksson, however, when he proceeded to sign highly-touted prospect Wayne Rooney from Everton, a Â£27 million move that made Rooney the most expensive under 20 signing of all time at the time. Rooney would intergrate into the united culture with a hat trick in his club debut at the UEFA Cup tie against Borussia Dortmund, and United would get back to winning ways, and with korean dynamo and 2005 european cup winner Park Ji-Sung and academy graduate Darren Fletcher in tow, the club would win the 2005-2006 League Cup.\n\nIn 2006, United proceeded with the signings of argentine duo Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez for Â£15 million from brazilian club Corinthians. Those signings proved significant for the team's depth, for United fought their way through a tense title duel with the all dominant West Ham United of Jose Mourinho to win their first league title in 7 years and their first european trophy in that same time span as they lifted the cup winners cup, defeating Deschamps and Drogba's Marseille in the final. Unfortunately, the ensuing off-season would see United be hit with an unprecedented $5 million fine for breach of transfer regulations, as it was revealed that both Tevez and Mascherano were under third party ownership, which is illegal in the FA Rules. This forced the club to sell Mascherano to Liverpool and buy Tevez's rights outright from Media Sports Investments with a hefty fee.\n\nNonetheless, this unexpected developemnt ended up not affecting United that much, for they were in the big three horse title race agaisnt West Ham and David Moyes's surprising Everton side until the end, where the tofees would end up triumphant in a big upset.\n\nIn europe, however, United would go all the way to.the champions league final, where they faced the previosu year's champion West Ham in the competition first all-england final. The match was an unremarkable affiar, where both sides shut eahc other down, and the match threatened to go to overtime until David Beckham scored from a signature curled free kick in the dying minutes of the game to win United's third european cup.\n\nThe next three seasons would see United go trophyless, however, as United's aging squad was finally taking its toll, and they would lose in two consecutive league cup finals to tottenham in 2009 and Falcao and Sneijder's Aston Villa in 2010, with Leeds, West Ham and Aston villa winning the next three league titles.\n\nWith a much younger squad in 2011-2012, Eriksson and United would participate in an intense title race, where United seemed to have won it against Blackburn on the final day...only for Daniel Sturridge to score the league winning goal against QPR for Manchester City.\n\nSince then, a long drought would follow, and managers would succeed one another until former supersub Ole Gunnar Solksjaer and, later, Ajax coach Erik Ten Hag took over, and with a promising young squad featuring the likes of Dean Henderson, Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford, Victor Lindelof, Axel Tuanzebe, Timothy Fosu-Mensah, Cameron Borthwick-Jackson and Scott McTominay, Man Utd would climb back up the standings, reaching the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup in 2017 and becoming semi-finalists of the 2021 UEFA Cup, losing to 1860 Munich before finally winning their first trophy in 15 years, defeating Crystal Palace in the 2023 league cup final.\n\nâ€‹\n\nName: Racing Club Paris Saint-Germain (born Racing Club de France)\n\nCity: Paris\n\nNicknames: Les Ciel et Blanc (the sky blue and whites), Les Pingouins (the Penguins)\n\nHome ground: Parc des Princes\n\nCapacity: 48 229\n\nLeague: Ligue 1\n\nHONORS\n\nDOMESTIC\n\nFrench Division 1/Ligue 1: 1935-1936, 1940-1941, 1960-1961, 1985-1986, 1993-1994, 2004-2005, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, 2018-2019,\n\nCoupe de France: 1929-1930, 1935-1936, 1938-1939, 1944-1945, 1948-1949, 1981-1982, 1982-1983, 1984-1985, 1992-1993, 1994-1995, 1997-1998, 2017-2018\n\nCoupe de La Ligue: 1994-1995, 1997-1998, 2000-2001, 2002-2003, 2014-2015, 2017-2018\n\nEUROPEAN\n\nChampions League: best finish Runner-up 2005-2006 and 2019-2020\n\nUEFA Cup: 1992-1993\n\nCup Winners Cup: 1995-1996, 1996-1997\n\nRacing Club Paris was born as Racing Club de France, an omnisport club founded in 1882 at the Condorcet University in Paris, France. Initially an Athletics and Tennis club, the club would first open its famous Rugby team, which is still nowadays one of the prominent rugby clubs in France and Europe, before creating its football section in 1896.\n\nAt the time, there was no national league, and the national championship was essentially a play-off between the champions of the Parisian league and the provincial leagues competing agaisnt each other.\n\nThe RC Paris 1935-1936 double side\n\nAt the turn of the century, Racing Paris became one of the prominent clubs in french football, winning multiple regional and national championships. In the 1930s, Racing took part in its first coupe de france final, where they'd win it against Sete in a wild final where they lost their starting keeper to a red card with ten minutes to go.\n\n6 years later, they would win French Football's second ever double as they won the french first division and the coupe in 1935-1936, two years after Marseille did the same exploit. The duels between Paris and Marseille in the 1930s would be the start of the legendary rivalry between those clubs.\n\nAfter a league title and two coupes in the 40s, Racing Paris would narrowly lose to upstart and future dominant force Stade De Reims in the 1950 Coupe final before going on a decade long drought, highlighted by close calls with relegation in multiple seasons. In 1958, Pierre Palibot, the coach that sent France to the semi-finals of the 1958 world cup in Mexico, became coach, and built a spectacular side that won an epic title race against Monaco to win the 1960-1961 league title.\n\nPalibot's 1960-1961 league winners\n\nThe rest of the decade would prove to be very troublesome, as bad results and threats of bankruptcy almost forced the club to go back to amateur status and be forcefully relegated to the third division. A merger between Racing and Sedan was refused by the federation due to it being illegal to merge two clubs from different districts, but a solution finally came in the late 60s.\n\nIn 1969, an ambitious group of businessmen, namely Guy Crescent, Pierre-Ã‰tienne Guyot and stade Saint-Germain owner Henri Patelle, were inspired by none other than Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu to start a subscription campaign and gather funds to buy Racing Paris, merge it with Stade Saint-Germain and turn it into french football's first and only fan-owned club, the merger being officialised in 1970.\n\nâ€‹\n\nGuy Crescent\n\nOnly two years later, the football team would move to the renovated Parc Des Princes, while the Rugby team would stay at Stade Yves-du-Manoir. In their first season at their new home, Racing Paris Saint-Germain, as the football team would now be called, would have their best season in a while, finishing in the UEFA Cup places and reachign the round of 16 of the Coupe de France, losing to future winners Lyon. The good times wouldn't last, however, as the club would struggle under its second elected president Daniel Hecter, who infamously used the gate receipt as bonuses for the players isntead of putting that money into the club's coffers, which banned him for life from presiding over a football club in 1978.\n\nIt would be under the newly-elected president, Francis Borelli, that Racing would see its return to the elite of French Football. To make his mark immediately, Borelli personally orchestrated, in 1980, the appointment of Hajduk Split's european cup winning coach Tomislav Ivic and the massive signing of Saint-Etienne's icon Dominique Rocheteau, which made headline news on TF1.\n\nTomislav Ivicâ€‹\n\nThe more under-the-radar, but oh so important signings of Chadian striker Nabatingue Toko and Sochaux's goalkeeper Joel Bats, along with the pre-established squad players Eric Renaud, Thierry Morin, Jean-Marc Pilorget, captain Dominique Bathenay, Mustapha Dahleb, Jean-Claude Lemoult and the club's crown jewel Luis Fernandez, formed a formidable Racing squad that won the 1981-1982 Coupe de France in an epic penalty shootout against league champions Saint-Etienne, the club's first silverware in 22 years.\n\nThe following year, two major reinforcements arrived in Algerian forward Rabah Madjer and Yugoslavia's best player, Safet Susic, in order to compete against Nantes and Bordeaux for domestic title and win the cup winners cup. In the league, they would finish third behind Nantes and Bordeaux, but in the cup winners cup, they defeated Lokomotiva Sofia, Swansea City and Waterschei Thor to reach the semi-finals, where they would unfortunately be defeated by eventual winners Aberdeen of Sir Alex Ferguson. The compensation prize would be victory in the coupe de france for the second year in a row.\n\nSafet Susicâ€‹\n\nThe 1983-1984 season saw Paris once again finishing 3rd behind Nantes and Bordeaux, albeit Bordeaux became champions this time, while in the cup winners cup, they defeated Irish side Glentoran, Italains Hellas Verona and Finish side Haka before being on the receiving end of a Diego Maradona masterclass at both teh Camp Nou and the Parc Des Prince as they bowed out to eventual winners Barcelona.\n\n1984-1985 saw Paris finishing in a disappointing 10th place, but winning the coupe against Monaco. While they would be stunned by the scintillating dynamo kiev in the round of sixteen of the 1985-1986 cup winners cup, Paris would become champions of france for the first time since 1961. With the solidity of Bats in goal, Renaud and Bathenay letting nothing through, Pilorget and Morin joining Mustapha Dahleb and Jean-Claude Lemoult in the counter-pressing, Luis Fernandez the midfield sentinel and the attacking trio of Madjer, Rocheteau and Susic frustrating opposing defenses and midfielders with their relentless forechecking, the club executed Ivic's innovative tactics to perfection, going undefeated for the first 27 games of the season and Susic and Joel Bats being named in the team of the year in france.\n\nLuis Fernandez, the prince of Parisâ€‹\n\nThe following season, 1986-1987, would be a disappointement, as Rabah Madjer would go to FC Porto in the off-season, becoming immortalised by his backheel goal in the 1987 champions league final, and Paris would be eliminated right from the get-go in the european cup by Czechoslovakian side FC Vitkovice, and they would finish the league in 7th place, 2 places outside the UEFA Cup spot. Failure to win the coupe de france would marka trophyless season for the Racingmen and the firing of Tomislav Ivic, to be replaced in 1987 by the european cup winning FC Porto manager Artur Jorge, with Ivic going the other way to Portugal.\n\nThe end of Borelli's third and final term would see the club's star players beginning to leave or age out one by one, and his old school way of running things was becoming obsolete as lucrative TV Deals and revenue sharing were starting to become the norm, as established by the world-leading Italian league and the new TV deal signed by the english football on ITV.\n\n1990 would see the arrival of french TV newcomers Canal + buying the rights to the French league for a very lucrative sum of money, with the revenue being split evenly between the clubs so as to keep up with the other rival leagues in europe. One of Canal +'s head honchos, Michel Denisot, a lifelong Football and Racing Paris Socio, was elected as the new president. Keeping Artur Jorge as coach, the club now emerged from their late 80s rebuild with a promising core of players which carried the team to a losing effort against Laurent Blanc, Carlos Valderama and Eric Cantona's Montpellier in the 1990 Coupe de france final, including Paul Le Guen, Vincent Guerin and Daniel Bravo running the midfield, Laurent Fournier and Alain Roche on defense and a young stud forward named David Ginola.\n\nâ€‹\n\nDavid Ginola\n\nThe 1990 off-season would see the club miss out on Hristo Stoichkov, who went to Johan Cruyff's Barcelona, but reinforce key positions with goalkeeper Bernard Lama from Lille, defenders Antoine KombouarÃ©, Patrick Colleter and Ricardo Gomes and Brazilian left winger Leonardo from Flamengo. Results would keep improving in the next two seasos, as Paris would once again become prominent players in the golden years of early-to-mid 90s french football, with the club's rivalry with Marseille hitting a whole new level as they battled year after year for the league title along with Arsene Wenger's Monaco, Zidane's Bordeaux, Guy Roux's Auxerre and Blanc and Valderama's Montpellier. David Ginola became a superstar in Paris, almost on the same level as david beckham would be a few years later, but he and Leonardo were pretty much alone on offense. One piece was missing to complete the offensive trio.\n\nAnd that piece ended up being George Weah from Wenger's Monaco. The Liberian signed with Paris in 1992 and completely transformed the offense. Leonardo, Weah and Ginola became the deadliest trio in France, and they took the fight go Marseille all the way to the end in the incredibly tight 1992 1993 ligue 1 title race that saw champions Marseille and 4th placed Bordeaux being separated by only 5 points!\n\nHowever, the highlight of the Racing Paris season would be their UEFA Cup run, after comfortably reachign the quarter-finals, Paris would face none other than Real Madrid of La Quinta del Buitre, Robert Prosinecki, Bodo Illigner and Ivan Zamorano. Having lost heavily 3-1 at Santiago Bernabeu, Paris needed a miracle at Parc Des Princes to qualify, especially with Zamorano scoring early one to make it 4-1 on aggregate. And then, the miracle did happen. The trio of Weah, Leonardo and Ginola took over, with Weah scoring a brace and making mincemeat of Sanchis and Hierro, while finally, in the dying minutes of the game, substitutes Valdo and Antoine KombouarÃ© turned the entire city of Paris into a nuthouse, with Valdo sneding his free kick right on the unmarked KombouarÃ©'s head tonwin it for Paris in the club's first great european victory.\n\nAnd the exploits would keep going, as the Racingmen, now full of confidence, would narrowly defeat Juventus 1-0, then George Weah would deliver the title-winning goal to Paris as they downed Baggio and Batistuta's Fiorentina 1-0 to win their first ever European trophy and complete France's clean sweep of the three main europan competitions!\n\nThe club, now convinced of their potential, would take part in a title duel with Marseille in 1993-1994, boosted by the arrival of Sao Paulo's copa libertadores winner Rai in tow, forcing Ricardo Gomes to be on the bench for KombouarÃ© in order to keep the trio of Leonardo, Ginola and Weah intact due to the three foreign players on the pitch rule at the time. Racing Paris would win their first league title since 1986, competing in the champions league for the 1994-1995 season, where they would defeat Deportivo La Coruna in the quarters, but lose to eventual champions Ajax. In the league, they would be no match for the young and exciting Nantes, but they would win the domestic cup double as compensation.\n\n1995-1996 sees the arrival of free agency and the number of foreign players on ht epitch being increased to 5, meaning Leonardo and Rai could play at the same time as new signings Julio Dely Valdes, Mauricio Pocchetino and Roberto Carlos, with George Weah not counting as a foreigner due to his french citizenship, while David Ginola would leave as a free agent to become a superstar in england for newcastle united.\n\nArtur Jorge's tactical changes, opting for a simple 4-4-2 with Roche and Pocchetino at center back and put Roberto Carlos and Fournier or academy graduate Francis Lacer as wingbacks, with Rai and Leonardo as double pivots on the wings to give the ball to Weah and Dely Valdes. In the league, they would surrender the title to AJ Auxerre in the last weeks of the season, but they would win the cup winners cup by defeating Parma, Valencia and Rapid Wien in the final, while Zidane's Bordeaux would win the UEFA Cup in the same year. Sadly, there would be no french clean sweeps like in 1993, as Nantes would lose heavily 4-1 to Ajax in the european cup final.\n\nIn the 1996-1997 off-season, Artur Jorge would leave the club to manage Portugal for the 1998 world cup, and his replacement would be club icon Luis Fernandez, who managed AS Cannes to third place in 1995-1996 and brought up future superstars like Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Viera. Fernandez would keep the same tactic, with Benoit Cauet joining from Nantes in midfield alongside Guerin or Le Guen, while Jerome Leroy from the academy would start on the right side and Leonardo on the left with weah and Rai up fromt and Dely Valdes as impact sub.\n\nIn the league, Paris would finish as a distant runner-up to Arsene Wenger's Monaco, but they would win a second consecutive cup winners cup title, shutting down Ronaldo and beating Barcelona on penalties after making insane comebacks agaisnt the likes of galatasaray and Manchester United.\n\nAccording to the UEFA rules revision, this cup winners cup victory qualified Racing Paris to the 1997-1998 champions league. In that off-season, Leonardo would leave for AC Milan and Dely Valdes to Real Oviedo, with youngster Edouard CissÃ© being promoted to.the first team and making his mark alongside Cauet. Fernandez moved Rai to the left wing and brought in Patrice Loko and Faustino Asprilla as Weah's new strike partners, but the two's poor forms forced Fernandez to try a teenager named Nicolas Anelka alongside Weah.\n\nThis proved to be a genius move, as anelka revealed himself as a huge prospect for the future, scoring 15 goals as Paris ended up in 6th place. In the champions league, Anelka would also prove his meddle, for Paris would successfully qualify from the group stage and reach the semi-final of the Champions League, losing to finalists Bayer Leverkusen. The club would win the domestic cup double to qualify for the 1998-1999 cup winners cup.\n\nIn a big shakeup, Michel Denisot was beaten in the elections by his rival in the 1990 elections Charles Bietry as the new president. In the transfers front, Alain Roche would join his former club Bordeaux as a free agent and Rai returned to Sao Paulo. To compete with Wenger's Monaco, Robert Pires's Marseille and Gerard Houllier's Bordeaux in the league, Racing Paris splashed the cash on Bayer Leverkusen's Christian Worns, Auxerre's Sabri Lamouchi and Nigerian genius Jay Jay Okocha on the left wing to replace Rai\n\nLama\n\nLacer Pocchetino Worns Carlos\n\nLeroy CissÃ©/Cauet Lamouchi Okocha\n\nAnelka Weah\n\nWhile it started really promisingly, eith the club being leaders heading into christmas, Racing Paris's 1998-1999 season was a big disappointment, with defensive issues all around and the club finishing 9th, while in the cup winners cup, they would be stunned 4-0 by lokomotiv moscow in the quarter finals.\n\n1999-2000 off-season would see fernandez clean house a bit, with Worns leaving for dortmund, cauet going to torino and a shift in tactic to a 4-2-3-1, with Laurent Robert coming in as the new left winger and Okocha behind Anelka as the sole striker, and Alain Goma becoming Pocchetino's new center back partner. It was a much better season, with Racing Paris ending up a very distant second to the dominant Monaco of Wenger and Okocha and Anelka lighting up the goal charts.\n\nRoberto Carlos would leave for a club record fee as part of florentino perez's galaticos policy at Real Madrid in the 2000 off-season, with academy graduate Didier Domi taking his place, while Bernard Mendy competes with Francis Lacer at right back, while Sylvain Distin of coupe de la ligue winners Guneugnon comes in to compete with Goma and Pochettino, and Bernard Lama would retire, with Lionel Letizi to replace him as the new goalkeeper.\n\nDespite this promising squad on paper, Racing Paris would end up in a relatively disappointing 6th place in the league, while in the UEFA Cup, they lost in the quarter-finals to eventual winners Alaves. The consolation prize being winning the league cup.\n\n2001-2002 would see both a new president, as Bietry resigned with his vice-president Laurent Perpere replacing him. In the league, Paris would perform much better, finishing 4th in the league and finoshing as runner-up to Jupp Heynckes's Liverpool in the cup winners cup thansk to their new Brazilian phenom Ronaldinho.\n\nLetizi\n\nMendy Pocchetino Distin Heinze\n\nCissÃ© Lamouchi\n\nLeroy Okocha Ronaldinho\n\nAnelka\n\n2002-2003 would see Okocha depart for Bolton and Racing Paris fall down in 11th place in the league at christmas, as Luis Fernandez engaged in a bitter feud with both Anelka and Ronaldinho, the former due to his attitude and the latter for his partying in the Paris nightlife. In the champios League, they would be eliminated in the group stage by Arsenal.\n\nThis led to a big shakeup, as Frank Rijkaard of Sparta Rotterdam was hired in the second half of the season to right the ship. Thankfully, Rijkaard did so just in time for Paris to finish in 8th place and win the league cup.\n\n2003-2004 would see rijkaard stabilise his tactic to a 4-3-3 with new signing Rafael Marquez hired from Monaco to replace Mauricio Pocchetino long-term and youngsters Modeste M'Bami and Lorik Cana joining Ã‰douard CissÃ© in the midfield 3, with Ronaldinho, Anelka and new signing Ludovic Giuly forming a new trio up front. Ronaldinho would carry the team to a very distant 2nd place finish from the monaco invincibles.\n\nFinally, Anelka had enough and wanted to leave, which Racing Paris gladly granted with Anelka moving to Bolton for $15 million, and the club would replace him with a $24 million move for Mallorca's Samuel Eto'o. This expensive signing proved to be more than worth it, for Eto'o ended up as top scorer in the ligue 1 thanks to his deadly trio with Ronnie and Giuly, and Paris would beat Lyon and Monaco to win Ligue 1 for the first time in 11 years. The club would then be inspired by Ronnie and Eto'o to reach the champions league final at home for the first time in the club's history in 2006, where they would unfortunately lose to Villareal 2-1.\n\nThe following three years would prove to be catastrophic, with the club going in free fall and ronaldinho going back to his partying ways. In 2009, in an ambitious trade, Eto'o would be traded to Inter Milan in exchange for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is tasked to lead a rebuilding, ronaldinho-less squad with promising pieces like Mamadou Sakho, Blaise Matuidi, Jeremy Menez and expensive palermo dynamo Javier Pastore, with cheap signings in 2011 like Phillipe Mexes, Salvatore Sirigu, and Maxwell filling the gaps\n\nIn 2012, the club, with Laurent Blanc as the new manager and the emergence of a young midfielder named Paul Pogba, would be reborn, winning their first league title since 2005.\n\nSirigu\n\nJallet Sakho Mexes Maxwell\n\nMatuidi Motta Pogba\n\nMenez Ibrahimovic Pastore\n\nIn 2013-2014, boosted by the free agent signing of Thiago Silva and Djibril SidibÃ©, Paris would win their second consecutive league title, but lose in the cha.pios league round of 16 to West Ham.\n\nSirigu\n\nJallet Sakho Thiago Silva SidibÃ©\n\nMatuidi Motta Pogba\n\nMenez Ibrahimovic Pastore\n\n2014-2015 would see Paris win the league cup, but lose in the champions league quarter-finals to Atletico Madrid. Youngsters like Kingsley Coman and Adrien Rabiot started making their mark in the first team.\n\nThey would lose the next three league titles, but win the domestic cup double in 2017-2018 with a younger squad mainly coming from the academy, such as Presnel Kimpembe, Alphonse Areola, Moussa DembelÃ©, Kingsley Coman and Adrien Rabiot. A league title in 2018-2019 would be spoiled by an upset against Eintracht Frankfurt in the 2019 cup winners cup semi-final and a loss in the champions league final to Erling Haaland and Borussia Dortmund in 2020.\n\nNowadays, Racing Paris is now a regular contender for titles in france and they are in a very good position in the future with the academy churning out quality talent.\n\nRACING PARIS CURRENT LINEUP 2023-2024\n\nArÃ©ola\n\nMeunier Zagadou KimpembÃ© Renan Lodi\n\nNkunku Rabiot Pogba\n\nDiaby DembelÃ© Coman\n\nâ€‹\n\nName: Association Sportive de Monaco\n\nCity: Monaco\n\nNicknames: Les MonÃ©gasques (the monÃ©gasques), Les Invincibles ( the invincibles) (about the 2003-2004 undefeated side), le rocher (the rock), les rouges et blancs (the red and whites)\n\nHome ground: Stade Louis 2\n\nCapacity: 16,360\n\nLeague: Ligue 1\n\nHONORS\n\nDOMESTIC\n\nLigue 1: 1976-1977, 1987-1988, 1996-1997, 1997-1998, 1999-2000, 2002-2003, 2003-2004, 2017-2018\n\nCoupe de France: 1959-1960, 1962-1963, 1979-1980, 1990-1991, 1991-1992, 1998-1999, 1999-2000, 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2009-2010\n\nCoupe de La Ligue: 1983-1984.\n\nEUROPEAN\n\nChampions League: best finish runner-up 1998-1999 and 2003-2004\n\nUEFA Cup: best finish semi-final 2017-2018\n\nCup Winners Cup: 1991-1992, 1992-1993, 2005-2006\n\nAS Monaco, born in 1919 by the mergers of multiple clubs in the principality and nearby france, is the only club of the french pyramid not to be based in the Hexagon, due to monaco not having its own league system or cup competition.\n\nThe club spent its first year as an amateur side until they were promoted to the second division at the end of the 30s, where, for most of the next two decades, they would yo-yo between the second and thrid division until Lucien Leduc brought it up to the first division in the late 50s, forming a strong side that almost won the league title in 1961 and 1963. The club's first silverware would be the coupe de france in 1960 and 1963.\n\nLucien Leduc, Monaco's original Architectâ€‹\n\nA decade later, Under leduc once again and boasting the likes of roland courbis, Jean-Luc Ettori and Delio Onnis, Monaco would win the league title in 1976-1977, with Onnis, coming from double scudetto champions Lazio in 1974, becoming the club's iconic goalscorer as they won the 1980 coupe de france and the 1983-1984 Coupe de La Ligue in an otherwise forgettable early to mid 80s, filled with close calls in the leageu and the cups.\n\nDelio Onnis, goalscorer extraordinaireâ€‹\n\nA few season of going nowhere in the league and the cups forced monaco to hire relative unknown Arsene Wenger for the 1987 1988 season. Despite being unproven, wenger proved to be an inspired signing, for he signed none other than Glen Hoddle from Tottenham and discovered a young liberian striker named George Weah. In his first season in charge, Wenger would win the league title, with Weah becoming part of a new breed of strikers. Building a strong side featuring veteran Claude Puel, Portuguese Rui Barros, SK Jugoslavia's number 10 Dragan Stoikovic and young french talents like Gilles Grimandi, Emmanuel Petit, Youri Djorkaeff and Lillian Thuram, Monaco would become perennial challengers to Marseille's dominance in the early 90s, with wenger's initial spell at the club culminating in winning two consecutive cup winners cups in 1992 and 1993, with weah being effectively replaced by Jurgen Klinsmann in the latter win.\n\nâ€‹\n\nArsene Wenger\n\nHis excellent performances for Monaco caught interest from Bayern Munich, which Wenger was very eager to join, but the monaco higher-ups refused any talks between him and Bayern, which prompted Wenger to quit for Nagoya Grampus in Japan. Two fruitless seasons followed under Jean Tigana, despite the emergence in the first team of youngsters such as David Trezeguet and Thierry Henry. In the 1996 off-season, The players, who were very dissatisfied, demanded Wenger back, or else they will all go on strike. After much negotiating with Nagoya, Monaco finally brought Wenger back in early september, with Remi Garde from Lyon and Patrick Viera from Cannes coming in at his request.\n\nâ€‹\n\nHenry and Trezeguet\n\nWith the training methods and culture that he learned from Japan, wenger revolutionised the club once again, and Monaco would dominate the 1996-1997 season, with Viera and Petit turning into the best midfield in france, while Djorkaeff and Enzo Scifo torched the wings and StÃ©phane Porato and Andreas Kopke were solid in net. Up front, Sonny Anderson was joined by either trezeguet or henry\n\nIn a surprising move, Wenger sold Scifo to Liege and Sonny Anderson to Barcelona and bought Lyon's breakout Right winger Ludovic Giuly and second division Saint-Etienne's right back Willy Sagnol. Asked about those moves, Wenger felt that the squad needed more pace and power on the wings to play the expansive football he wanted, and he put his faith in henry and trezeguet up front.\n\nPorato/Kopke\n\nSagnol Grimandi Dumas Leonard\n\nGiuly Viera Petit Djorkaeff\n\nTrezeguet Henry.\n\nThe ensuing 97-98 season would see Wenger and Monaco storm the ligue 1 and hold off a challenge from the surprising Lens and Metz sides to win a second consecutive title, while they would eliminate manchester united in the champions league quarter final before losing to eventual winners Parma in the semis.\n\nThis experience gained would prove crucial, as Monaco, now boosted by the arrivals of Marcel Desailly and brazilian left back Sylvinho, took the champions league by storm, defeating Celtic, Inter Milan and Parma to reach the final, where they would be on the receiving end of Andrei Shevchenko's star-making performance, outscoring Henry and Trezeguet with a hat trick to win the european cup for Dynamo Kiev, the latter club becoming the first eastern european side to win the competition since SK Jugoslavia in 1990-1991. In the league, they would finish 3rd behind marseille and champions bordeaux, but they would win the coupe de france to qualify for the 1999-2000 cup winners cup.\n\n1999-2000 would see Thierry Henry and Trezeguet turn into the best strikers in europe not named Ronaldo, and young mexican Rafael Marquez and academy Graduate Phillipe Christanval emerge as quality players as Monaco would dominate in Ligue 1 and win the coupe de france again. a potential treble would sadly be averted, as they lost the cup winners cup final to Valencia on a missed penalty by Viera.\n\nThe 2000 off-season would see David Trezeguet depart for Juventus on a club record sale, Djorkaeff leave for Kaiserslautern and willy sagnol for bayern munich. Replacing them is Cameroonian Lauren from Celta Vigo, Sylvain Wiltord from Bordeaux and robert pires from Marseille.\n\nPorato\n\nLauren Christanval Desailly Sylvinho\n\nGiuly Viera Marquez Pires\n\nWiltord Henry\n\nDespite this really strong squad, Monaco would concede the league title to the surprising FC Nantes, while they would lose in the cup winners cup semi-finals to eventual winners Bayern Munich\n\nBoosted in their forward depth with hajduk split's Dado Prso, 2001-2002 would see Monaco lose the league title in a four-horse race to surprise winners Lens. Monaco would go unbeaten on the road to win the league in 2002-2003 in an astonishing 7-horse title race, where the gap between 1st and 7th place was only 6 points!\n\nThis undefeated record in away games made wenger realise that something big was about to happen. Out went Ludovic Giuly and Rafael Marquez to RC Paris and in came ivorian Kolo TourÃ©, who joined the club after injuring Wenger himself during a trial, Emmanuel Adebayor from Metz and the free agent signing of german veteran keeper Jens Lehmann from Dortmund, along with young Patrice Evra becoming the new left back.\n\nLehmann\n\nLauren Squillacci TourÃ© Evra\n\nPires Viera Gilberto Rothen\n\nAdebayor Henry\n\nSubs: Porato, Givet, Rodriguez, Edu, Plasil, Wiltord, Prso\n\nWith this team in tow, Monaco went the entire season undefeated in both the league and the coupe de france, losing only to sochaux in the league cup final. In the champions league, they would also go undeafeated and were on the cusp of a treble, with Thierry Henry becoming unstoppable...that is, until they finally met the brick wall that was Jose Mourinho's FC Porto in the champions league final, badly losing 3-0 and wenger being outclassed by the portuguese upstart manager. Victory in the coupe de france in 2005 would be followed by victory in the 2006 cup winners cup, with the 2006-2007 season being the last in the champions league for Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira for Monaco, as they would leave in 2007 for Barcelona and Real Madrid, respectively, while Patrice Evra would leave for Alex Ferguson's Leeds United and Robert Pires to villareal.\n\nDespite those departures, Monaco and Wenger still had a very good team, with the youngsters now taking over as Gael Givet, Gael Clichy, Emmanuel Ã‰bouÃ©, Lassana Diarra, JÃ©rÃ©my Menez, goalkeeper StÃ©phane Ruffier and Kolo TourÃ©'s brother Yaya TourÃ© emerging as the new generation of Monegasques, with Djibril CissÃ© coming in from Auxerre to partner Adebayor.\n\n2007-2008 sees Monaco enter a 5-horse race with Gerard Houllier and Benzema's Lyon, Laurent Blanc and Gourcuff's Bordeaux, Deschamps and Drogba's Marseille and the surprising Nancy-Lorraine of Mamadou Niang and Mustapha Hadji, with Bordeaux ending up winning that race. Distant 4th place finishes would follow for 5 consecutive seasons as monaco started losing talent left and right due to financial difficulties.\n\nIn 2013, Arsene Wenger, with the help of a consortium, became co-owner of Monaco, getting half the shares of the house of grimaldi. He would spend the next three seasons rebuilding his squad around signings such as Geoffrey Kondogbia, Bernardo Silva, Mehdi Benatia, TiemouÃ© Bakayoko, Daniel Subasic and Fabinho, with youth products Layvin Kurzawa, Francis Coquelin, Yannick Ferreira Carrasco and Anthony Martial completing the team.\n\nIn 2016, the signing of brazilian center back Jemerson added more solidity to the team, while a young crack named Kylian MbappÃ© would emerge as a huge superstar, him and martial carrying Monaco offensively as Wenger and Monaco enters the 5-horse race for the title, finishing as runner up to Aubameyang's Saint-Etienne in the league. 2017-2018 would see Monaco dominate the league and lose in the UEFA Cup semi-final to Lyon in Arsene Wenger's last season as Manager, with Unai Emery from Sevilla as the new manager.\n\nâ€‹\n\nKylian MbappÃ©\n\nMonaco would reach the 2018-2019 Champions League semi-final, but they would lose to finalists Barcelona. This woukd end up being MbappÃ©'s last season, for his three-year professional contract ran out and he would go to Atletico Madrid for a world record fee, while Bernardo Silva left for Italy\n\nMonaco would use that fee to sign players like Abdou Diallo, Axel Disasi, Youri Tielmans, Wissam Ben Yedder, Alexander Golovin and free agent Jan Oblak from Manchester United.\n\nSince then, with Ferreira Carrasco, Martial and Ben Yedder leading the attack and Bakayoko, Tielmans and Golovin running the midfield, Monaco are still contenders in Ligue 1, with former Stade Rennais boss Leonardo Jardim as new coach.\n\nAS MONACO CURRENT LINEUP\n\nOblak\n\nTourÃ© Disasi Diallo Kurzawa\n\nTielmans Bakayoko Golovin\n\nMartial Ben Yedder Ferreira Carrasco"
