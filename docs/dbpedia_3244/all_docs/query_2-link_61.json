        "text": "It was pretty hard training session today for the Granata troops: the players worked for two hours both in the morning and in the afternoon at the Centro Sisport, and another session is planned for tomorrow (Saturday) at 10 o'clock. Following this intense schedule, Zaccheroni will give his roster a two-day rest before restarting on Tuesday afternoon with the 'normal' week and prepare Sunday's key clash with Chievo.\n\nBefore the afternoon session, skipper Diego De Ascentis spoke with the press and gave his view of Toro's difficult situation, as well as his personal remarks after Urbano Cairo's statement: a few days ago the Toro chairman said that he decided to call the experienced midfielder back in the Granata roster despite the negative opinion of former coach Gianni De Biasi, who didn't want him. \"I didn't know that\" Diego said, \"but it wasn't really an issue for me. I worked hard this summer and I knew that I would have played in the first round: after all, the club didn't spend a cent for my comeback, so it wasn't such a bad affair…\".\n\nDe Ascentis also spent wise words about the bad start to the season, comparing Toro's current woes with those he lived in the Cimminelli era. \"Believe me, this is a cakewalk compared with what Toro went through in the recent past. Now the fans understand the situation and they're much calmer: next Sunday we'll have to change our attitude especially for them\"."
