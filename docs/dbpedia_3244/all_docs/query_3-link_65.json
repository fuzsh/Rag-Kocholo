(1915)\n\nMatr. 80895 - via Indipendenza, 16\n\n57126 Livorno - Telefono 0586 219295\n\nThe city of Livorno lies on the west coast of northern Italy in the Regione (region) of Toscana (Tuscany). Toscana includes the famous Fiorentina, and other Serie A minnows Empoli and Siena, not to mention Serie B's Arezzo whom we played last year.\n\nLivorno were known as Toscana FC, before being officially established in 1915 as U.S. Livorno (Unione Sportiva, I think). They began to play their football in Stadio Armando Picchi since October the 8th, 1933 when they beat fellow rivals Fiorentina 3-0 during its inauguration. Of course, at the time Italy was under Mussolini, and the newly built stadium was called Edda Ciano Mussolini - after Benito's daughter. The stadium was created by a famous Florentine architect, Raffaello Brizzi, who masterminded the 20,000 capacity (approx. 15,000 seated) structure back then.\n\nStadio Armando Picchi -\n\nThe stadium was named Armando Picchi in 2000, after their famous Libero defender from the 1950's. He moved on to other clubs, as Livorno were struggling in Serie B at the time.\n\nArmando...or Nando, was a crucial player in defining the Catenaccio movement of Helenio Herrera's Inter of the 1960's. After Livorno, he featured prominently for the Nerazzurri, winning 3 Scudetti, 2 Champions Leagues, and 2 Intercontinental cups and 12 caps for Italy. Here he is pictured below with the legendary Pele.\n\nLivorno has a had a turbulent history ever since 1949, since they got relegated to Serie B...and never looked ahead since then until 2004. They struggled in the lower divisions, often yo-yo-ing between Serie B, C1, C2, Serie D...and even a division below that- the \"Eccellenza Regionale\" during the 1991-1992 season!\n\nBut the dream came true, the below 2003/2004 squadra Amaranto were able to achieve a historic promotion from Serie B to A:\n\nPavarini, Melara, Vanigli, Cannarsa, Balleri, Grauso, Ruotolo, Doga, Lucarelli, Protti, Vigiani\n\nSealing a 3-1 win away to Piacenza in 2004 was a turning point in the history of Livorno earning them direct promotion to Serie A. Mind you, that season Serie B was 24 teams! Livorno finished an impressive 3rd place, thus directly promoting them to Serie A for the first time in 55 years!\n\nIt was the mastermind of current Sampdoria manager, Walter Mazzarri who guided the team to promotion.\n\nHere is a picture of the fans from that great evening in Piacenza...\n\nI couldn't find any more pics from that match...but what I did find was pics from the \"Festa\" after their final home match the following weekend!\n\nUnlike Bari where his goals counted for nothing, despite surpassing Batistuta...Igor Protti scored dozens of goals for the Amaranto to take them to Serie A...the fans love him...\n\nBut the real home town hero in Livorno is an all too familiar name - Cristian Lucarelli!!!\n\nHere he is (against our very own Molinaro) versus Siena...\n\nIn 2004/2005 guided by Roberto Donadoni, Livorno had lined up a decent squad for survival in Serie A. With impressive scorelines, like holding Juve to a 2-2 draw, beating Lazio 1-0, a 1-0 win vs. Milan...however, they struggled away from home, barely won 2 matches on the road in that season. They finished 9th place.\n\n2005/2006 proved to be a more challenging season. New comers Lazetic (from Chievo), Palladino on load from Juve, an old-timer (\"has-been\" - remember this term, I will use it later) Bakayoko, hard working midfielder Stefano Morrone, and veteran Diego De Ascentis.\n\nAltho, the names aren't too fancy, Donadoni's men still managed to finish 9th...and then 6th after the Calciopoli scandal judgment. Hence, this ensured them a historic qualification to the UEFA Cup.\n\nLivorno made an encouraging start to the UEFA cup the following season under Daniele Arrigoni, but were eventually knocked out by Espanyol 4-1 on aggregate. Their best result was a 1-0 win vs. Auxerre away at the stade Abbe Deschamps\n\nArrigoni was sacked just after the halfway point, until his replacement Fernando Orsi came in, with the team finishing in 11th place, managing to steer away from relegation.\n\nThis year Livorno have reinforced their squad yet again for survival, this time with old timer Vikash Dhorasoo, Italian flop Francesco Tavano, and the legendary \"has been\"-Super Depor striker...DIEGO TRISTAN!!! Lucarelli99 ended up going to Shakhtar Donetsk. Other new comers include, former Juve player Giannichedda, former Fiorentina Serie C and B hero Christian Rigano, Fausto Rossini (Atalanta youth graduate, was highly rated as a youngster, a flop now), and speaking of graduates there's a Juve youth in there too - Francesco Volpe who I think is there on loan.\n\nOh and the old Filippini twins Emmanuele and Antonio are reunited, once again\n\nI never expected this man who terrorized Juve's defense on more than one occasion...would come back to haunt us in a Livorno shirt!!!\n\nThe squad roster (WikiPedia)\n\n1 GK Marco Amelia\n\n3 MF Emanuele Filippini\n\n4 MF Antonio Filippini\n\n6 DF Fabio Galante\n\n7 MF Nico Pulzetti\n\n8 MF José Luís Vidigal\n\n9 MF Martin Bergvold\n\n10 FW Francesco Tavano\n\n14 GK Alfonso De Lucia\n\n15 DF Dario Knežević\n\n16 MF Giuliano Giannichedda\n\n18 DF Rahman Rezaei\n\n20 FW Fausto Rossini\n\n21 MF Massimo Loviso\n\n22 FW Diego Tristán\n\n23 FW Alessandro Diamanti\n\n24 MF Vikash Dhorasoo\n\n26 DF Giovanni Pasquale\n\n32 DF Simone Pavan\n\n69 DF David Balleri\n\n77 DF Alessandro Grandoni\n\n78 FW Francesco Volpe\n\nLivorno's likely starting 11 for this match:\n\nLivorno: Amelia, Grandoni, Knezevic, Galante, Pasquale, A. Filippini, Pulzetti, Loviso, E. Filippini, Tristan, Tavano\n\nBuy on AliExpress.com"
