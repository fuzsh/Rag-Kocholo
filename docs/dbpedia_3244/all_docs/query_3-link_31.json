        "text": "Front two Juventus and Milan both cruised to home wins in Serie A.\n\nThere is no&nbsp;change at the top of Serie A as front-runners Milan and Juventus both cruised to facile victories on home soil.\n\nChampions Juventus had to wait until just before the hour mark to break the deadlock against Livorno,&nbsp;when the impressive Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovich&nbsp;notched the latest goal in what has been an imperious start to the new campaign.\n\nWithin a minute, the 58th, strike partner David Trezeguet had doubled their advantage before Alessandro Del Piero etched his name on the scoresheet in the final minute to secure a 3-0 win.\n\nLivorno's woes were worsened in the final stages as Diego De Ascentis was shown a red card.\n\nMilan too were excellent in putting Udinese to the sword 5-1 at the San Siro, with Alberto Gilardino helping himself to a brace.\n\nThe Italy international got Milan off the mark in the 25th minute before Clarence Seedorf (36)&nbsp;and Andrea Pirlo (45)&nbsp;ensured a three goal lead at the break.\n\nGilardino netted on 53 minutes, Udinese striker Vincenzo Iaquinta notched a consolation from the penalty spot, before Brazilian Kaka finished proceedings with Milan's fifth twelve minutes from time.\n\nGoals from Tomas Ujfalusi (1)&nbsp;and Luca Toni (62) gave Fiorentina away day success at Ascoli, while Roma too enjoyed a fine win on their travels in beating Messina 2-0.\n\nFrenchman Philippe Mexes gave Roma the lead in the 34th minute, leaving talismanic captain Francesco Totti to seal the win ten minutes from time.\n\nGoals from Marco Marchionni on the half hour mark and Domenic Morfeo in the 50th minute were enough to ensure Parma saw off Lecce at home, whilst Sergio Pellissier's strike gave Chievo a 1-0 win at Siena - who had earlier seen Enrico Chiesa miss a penalty.\n\nSampdoria were too good for Palermo on their travels as they came away from Sicily with a 2-0 win thanks to goals from Andrea Gasbarroni (32)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Emiliano Bonazzoli (72).\n\nCagliari's clash with Treviso ended in a 0-0 stalemate."
