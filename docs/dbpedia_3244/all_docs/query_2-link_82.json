        "text": "to me the case in the second season, however in the first season did not lose a game ... Not happening, I suppose the amount of division (ba League 2nd below) and make a starting line again practically have not adjusted (I'm already more than half of the season and struggling to avoid relegation).\n\nMy starting lineup is very good for that category:\n\nPT: Kingson (GHANA)\n\nFullbacks: Digne and Nelson Rivas\n\nCt: Semedo and Martin Crespi\n\nCD: Marti\n\nMC: Van de Laak and Gudjonhsen\n\nDCS: Aquino, Miguel Medina, Manu Busto\n\nGreetings\n\n---------- Post added at 08:40 PM ---------- Previous post was at 08:37 PM ----------\n\n---------- Post added at 08:41 PM ---------- Previous post was at 08:40 PM ----------\n\nWill influence play in 2D or 3D game engine?\n\nhi guys\n\nI used to have immense success with small teams using the ultimate 11.3 v3 tactic on my mac. recently I bought a windows laptop and I downloaded the 'v3 Rarely' tactic from the opening post and found that it was pretty bad and I was not getting the same results with small teams as I used to on my mac.

Only problem I seem to have is I concede quite alot from corners.\n\nIs this a common problem ?\n\nI have altered the defending corners so that I have all but 3 back with 2 upfront and man on the edge of the area.\n\nBut the rest are in the box man marking. Seems to have done the trick so far.\n\nhi guys\n\nI used to have immense success with small teams using the ultimate 11.3 v3 tactic on my mac. recently I bought a windows laptop and I downloaded the 'v3 Rarely' tactic from the opening post and found that it was pretty bad and I was not getting the same results with small teams as I used to on my mac.

I was tottenham and was playing man city away and lost 4-3. Tevez scored a hattrick the same way 3 times. gomes takes a goal kick, one of man citys players gets the header and tevez is off leaving one on one with keeper.\n\nWondering if you have any suggestions, I'm currently improving my centrebacks quickness.\n\nAnd if there are any improvements for set piece defences? I think I read somewhere you said set fullbacks to go back?\n\nWhile I'm here, no OI, min pitch size, *** man team talks. match prep- none, average workload\n\nHave you tried working with player preferred moves?\n\nI've currently got my DMC with stops play, to hold up the ball and lets my more creative players get into play. simple passes and looks for pass\n\nLCM comes deep to get ball\n\nRCM is the playmaker so killer balls often. he doesn't have much pace so don't let him run with ball often and ofc dictates tempo\n\nSTC/R/L channels, placed shots, beat offside trap etc.\n\nWhat attributes of striker position is this tactic for? I'm currently playing same foot same side strikers.\n\nThanks mate, other than that the tactic is beastly ^^ good work\n\nDecided to re-try this tactic for a season with Exeter City for a whole season, and Southamption for half a season, and unfortunately results have been less than impressive .\n\nExeter finished with W20 D12 L14 (F89 A74), while Soton are currently at W12 D4 L7 (F42 A27).\n\nJudging by the results it has yielded for other people I guess it must just be my match engine or something. I've double- and triple-checked the instructions, but find myself being dominated in 80% of matches, while my strikers (notably Lambert and do Prado) need about 5 clear-cut chances before they bury one.\n\nThat said, I'll give the alternate version linked above a short go...\n\nedit: New edition just lost to rock-bottom club :'(\n\nHedges the person means V3 tactic of which I released before V3 Rarely. The only difference between V3 and V3 Rarely is the the LCM is set from 'run from deep' 'sometimes' instead of 'rarely' .. Its the only change you need to make if you want to try that out\n\nyeh and lcm also has a back arrow in the 'Rarely' version whereas there is no back arrow in the normal v3. my midfielders and even strikers just seem to be closing down the opposition much better with the normal v3 tactic, not giving them much time on the ball. im not using any OI and its the same players, so same workrate. anyways it works great, so thank you. just trying to find a way to stop the AI scoring from set pieces"
