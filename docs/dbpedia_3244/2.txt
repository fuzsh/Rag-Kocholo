TORINO midfielder Diego De Ascentis has strenuously denied that Granata supporters approached the players to deliberately set-out to hurt Juventus players and get themselves sent-off in their ill-fated derby game on Saturday night.

Cristiano Lucarelli was sent-off&nbsp;for clashing with Juve's Igor Tudor and he was also followed down the tunnel by team-mates Carlos Marinelli and Luca Mezzano.

However, De Ascentis is adamant that Juve director general Luciano Moggi's claims that players were under orders to show their passion in an over zealous manner after meeting with a group of hardcore Torino fans are wide of the mark.

"Personally, I haven't met any supporters in our headquarters in the last week and nobody has asked us to make bad tackles or injure our rivals.

"Because we are professionals, it is a request we wouldn't have accepted.

"Torino supporters always ask us to play with guts, passion and determination as we did in the second half against Perugia, but nothing else," he added.
