In his 29-game career (12 as a starter), he has caught 72 passes for 854 yards and seven touchdowns, but is still looking for his first multiple TV receiving game. His 1,114 career kickoff return yards already ranks eighth in school history heading into his junior season. The record was set by his former teammate Shaq Hill (2012-14, 16) with 2,280. His twin brother, Nzuzi, has played in 38 games and started 25.\n\n2018: Listed as a starter at wide receiver on the preseason depth chart. He had eight catches for 129 yards in three spring scrimmages, including three grabs for 68 yards and a long of 54 in EWU’s Red-White Game.\n\n2017: Earned third team All-Big Sky honors (as selected by the league’s head coaches). Started EWU’s first 10 games as a wide receiver and played in a total of 11. He ranked 36th in FCS and fifth in the Big Sky in receptions (5.4 per game, total of 59) and 68th and 11th, respectively, in yards (63.0 per game, total of 693). He caught five passes for 101 yards against Fordham (9/16/17) and one game later versus Montana (9/23/17) he equaled the sixth-best performance in school history with 13 catches for a career-high 143 yards. However, he didn’t score in either game, but followed that by having a touchdown catch in five-straight games from Sept. 30 to Nov. 4. He started the stretch with eight catches for 70 yards against Sacramento State (9/30/17), and ended it with seven grabs for 94 yards versus Weber State (11/4/17). He had six receptions for 102 yards and a TD versus UC Davis (10/7/17). He took over a starting position after all three of EWU’s 2016 starters (Cooper Kupp, Kendrick Bourne, Shaq Hill) were All-Americans and moved on to opportunities in the NFL after combining for an inconceivable 817 catches for 12,412 yards and 132 touchdowns in 160 games played (109 starts). In three spring scrimmages, Webster caught 14 passes for 273 yards and five of the eight touchdowns EWU quarterbacks passed for.\n\n2016: Played in eight games as wide receiver and kickoff returner, missing six games from Oct. 8 to Nov. 18 with a broken clavicle. He suffered the injury on a 65-yard kickoff return against UC Davis (10/1/16). He returned to play in all three games in the FCS Playoffs, and finished the season with six catches for 64 yards and two TDs, and a 25.3 average on 15 kickoff returns. He caught one pass in six of the eight games he played. He started EWU’s final game of the season versus Youngstown State (12/17/16). Earlier in the year he was EWU’s co-special teams player of the week against Northern Arizona (9/24/16) when his 55-yard kickoff return led to an Eagle field goal just before halftime to give EWU the lead for good in the 50-35 win. Was the leading receiver with 18 catches for 251 yards and four touchdowns in three spring scrimmages. Three of his TD catches came from fellow sophomore Gage Gubrud. He had six catches for 63 yards and a TD in the Red-White Game, and one scrimmage earlier had nine catches for 141 yards and two scores.\n\n2015: Finishing with 772 all-purpose yards as a redshirt freshman, Webster played in 10 games, including one as a starter. He closed the year with seven catches for 97 yards and had 680 yards on 31 kickoff returns. He ranked eighth in the Big Sky with a 21.9 average per return, with a long of 47. His 680 return yards rank as the 10th-most in school history. He made the first start of his career versus Sacramento State (10/26/15) and had a pair of catches for 36 yards. He missed the game versus Idaho State (10/17/15) with a knee injury. Webster had season highs of six kickoff returns and 139 yards against Northern Iowa (9/12/15), and had a long return of 37 yards. His season-best return of 47 yards came versus Cal Poly (10/10/15) when he was selected as the team’s special teams player of the week. In three spring scrimmages, he caught a team-leading 13 passes for 123 yards and touchdown. Nine of those grabs and 93 of the yards came in EWU’s second scrimmage of the spring in a break-out performance.\n\n2014: Redshirted.\n\nHS: Graduated from Deer Valley HS in 2014. Was selected to the\n\nMaxPreps.com All-Northern California High School Football Team. He was selected by the Bay Area News Group as the All-East Bay Offensive Player of the Year. He was selected by the San Francisco Chronicle as the Contra Costa/Tri-Valley recipient as one of the metro area’s top three regional football players. He was also the MVP of the Bay Valley Athletic League, and was a first team all-league quarterback.
