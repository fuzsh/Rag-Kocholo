        "text": "Webster Travel Baseball (WTB) has been in existence for 15yrs and now is a formal non-profit organization incorporated in New York State. Our application to become a tax exempt 501(C)(3) organization was accepted by the IRS. All donations and sponsorships (beginning April 19, 2012) are NYS and Federal tax exempt and are deductible. Any donor or sponsor should see their tax advisor for additional information. All WTB teams are customarily called the Webster Warthogs. Each season we intend to form at least one team at each player age, 8u through 17u.\n\nMission\n\nWebster Travel Baseball (“WTB”) mission is to operate as a player development baseball organization for the youth in the Webster School District and keep the top talent in Webster on Webster teams that play in the highest‐level travel league in our region (MCBR). We provide opportunities and exposure to Webster kids while instilling discipline, teamwork, sportsmanship, honesty and integrity.\n\nProgram Goals\n\nKeep the most talented Webster players playing together on Webster teams that play in the highest level travel league in our region; MCBR (https://www.mcbaseballregion.com/).We are the only Webster organization sanctioned to bring new Webster travel teams to the MCBR league, which is the Premier travel league in the 5 County region. We strive to make sure all Webster players get the best developmental experience at the best value (talented players need to be challenged). We attend multiple weekend tournaments where players gain experience playing under pressure in many playoff situations; and it allows us to develop many pitchers due to the compressed weekend schedule, which is much needed by the High School teams and players get to witness the wider area baseball talent outside of the Rochester region (very important to understand).\n\nProvide a simple “one team all season” format for the players.\n\nPrepare Webster players for high school and college advancement at much less cost than the facility based club organizations (no paid coaches, no business owner salaries and expenses, no profit); but with same experiences and opportunities. In response to parents requests, we now have experienced and dedicated hitting and pitching instructors working with our teams and we offer an optional team based strength and conditioning program at PCX in mid Dec and Jan.\n\nProvide each player with the opportunity to learn, develop, and improve their baseball skills on a regular basis.\n\nField successful teams at all levels. (not necessarily defined by wins)\n\nContinue to be a Member in Good Standing with the Webster Youth Sports Council. (https://websteryouthsports.com/)\n\nEmphasize the WCSD CARE program Rubric to all WTB players. (see CARE link at the WYSC site above)\n\nSupport the WHEN:DFCC (https://www.whendfcc.org/)\n\nAll coaches are certified coaches through the National Alliance of Youth Sports (NAYS) and pass background checks through MCBR league."
