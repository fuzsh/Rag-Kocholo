The first day will be an evaluation day to test skill levels. Kids will be placed on a team and will work on drills for the first couple weeks. Game play will start in December and players will have 30 minutes of both practice and league play. Players in 1st - 2nd grade will be using lower rims. Please have your child wear their boots and bring sneakers and a water bottle each week. We also ask that your child brings their own basketball due to health and safety concerns. This league can't run without parent volunteers, please email Julie Schillaci at jschillaci@ci.webster.ny.us if you are able to coach this year.\n\nPlease email recreation supervisor if you are available and willing to coach.
