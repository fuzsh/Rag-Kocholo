        "text": "Former Blazers guard-forward Martell Webster confirmed that he got his McDonald’s All-American ring back on Monday night at the Rose Garden Arena. The ring went missing from his Tualatin-area home recently, (Read: stolen) and turned up in the hands of Daniel Tracy, 47, from Gladstone. Tracy claims he bought the ring on Craigslist for $75. Webster wanted it back.\n\nTracy figures it’s time for the ring to go back to Webster. After a request from Webster, the Blazers have given Tracy and his friend passes to tonight’s game. They’ll meet with Webster, shake hands, and make a trade. “I’d like to maybe get a jersey or a ball for the ring,” Tracy said. “I’d donate whatever we get to my brother-in-law, who runs an auction every year for little-kids’ baseball in Gladstone.”\n\nTracy offered $50. The men settled on $75, he said. And since that day, Tracy figured he’d get the ring back to Webster because “if it was my ring, I’d want it back.” First, though, Tracy and a friend attempted to “price” the ring on eBay, listing it for sale. That auction ended early after it was spotted by locals, who alerted Webster. The Minnesota guard told reporters a couple of weeks ago, “I know exactly who it was who took it. I only had a couple of people living with me at the time.” It’s stolen. So he wants it back.\n\nThe Timberwolves appear to be getting some good injury news for a change. Martell Webster, one of the newcomers expected to give the Wolves some athletic energy this season, was cleared today for game acrtion by team physicians. The veteran swingman met with the physicians to get an update on his recovery from back surgery on Oct. 25. Webster, acquired by the Wolves on June 24 in a draft-day trade with Portland, had surgery to repair part of a herniated disc in his lower back. Webster has been sidelined since the exhibition season. He was one of the Wolves’ more impressive players in the exhibition season, leading the team in scoring twice, including a 24-point effort against the Los Angeles Lakers in London.\n\nIn any case, several league sources confirm that what is certain is that disclosing injury history is a focal point of those trade calls we always hear about. A typical NBA trade goes like this: Marc Stein breaks the news, and says that the trade will be official once the trade call with the league is complete. And then 12 hours later, teams e-mail out press releases. For as long as anyone can remember, a call like that has consisted of representatives of the relevant teams, and league officials and lawyers, all digging into the nitty gritty of contract particulars, bonuses and trade kickers. And part of those calls, whether by tradition or rule is unclear, is to declare known injuries. The question is whether, on his last day on the job, then-Portland GM Kevin Pritchard or his staff did or did not know about, or declare, any Martell Webster back injuries."
