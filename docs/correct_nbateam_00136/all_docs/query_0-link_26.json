The Timberwolves have struggled mightily to defend the perimeter in his absence.\n\nHe returned to practice last week and team doctors cleared him for game action on Tuesday. The team says his specific return date has not been determined. The Timberwolves play Oklahoma City on Wednesday night.\n\nThe team says center Darko Milicic is day to day with a bruised right thigh.\n\nPoint guard Jonny Flynn, who has been out all season after having hip surgery, is not yet ready to play. The team is considering sending him to the D-League for a second rehab assignment this weekend."
