        "text": "The Iowa Wolves were officially announced as the new branding starting with the 2017-18 season. The Iowa Wolves joined the NBA G-League as the Iowa Energy, an expansion team in 2007. The G-League is the official minor league system of the NBA. The Energy were affiliated with the Memphis Grizzlies from 2014 – 2017 and changed to the Iowa Wolves after being purchased by the NBA’s Minnesota Timberwolves. The Iowa Wolves play their home games at Wells Fargo Arena.\n\nOne of the most decorated teams in league history, the Energy captured four division titles (2009, 2010, 2011 and 2014) and the NBA D-League Championship in 2011. Committed to preparing and developing coaches and players for the NBA, 20 Energy players and three coaches received Call-Ups from NBA teams.\n\nThe Iowa Wolves set the franchise single-season attendance record, averaging 4,148 fans per game over 24 games, drawing nearly 100,000 fans to Wells Fargo Arena with a total attendance of 99,552 fans. The previous single-season mark was set in 2017-18, the first year of the Iowa Wolves franchise."
