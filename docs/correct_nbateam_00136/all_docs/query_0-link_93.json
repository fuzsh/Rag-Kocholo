        "text": "This is about as easy as things get in an exercise where you balance the talent level of players remaining with the needs of the team. Minnesota’s entropic hole at the shooting guard position threatens to devalue the team, and without a legitimate threat at the two, the rest of the Western conference will continue to hold the playoffs high above the team’s head like a douchebag older brother would to a perpetually less physically capable sibling. Ricky Rubio was a revelation for this team last year before he went down with a season-ending injury. Kevin Love got signed to a perplexingly short long-term contract extension last season, and Minnesota’s other young players exhibited true, if inconsistent, potential last season. Before Rubio’s injury, Minnesota was threatening to make the playoffs. With another year of experience for their young players, and hopefully some moves in the offseason, Minnesota could be in pretty, pretty good shape in spite of the most compellingly absurd GM in the league, David Kahn.\n\nWith all due respect to Martell Webster and Wayne Ellington, the Timberwolves should draft Dion Waiters here. Waiters’ agent canceled all of his workouts last week after a rumored promise was made in the top 11 teams. By having him here, all the way at 18, and drafted after Beal, Lamb, and Rivers, this panel believes those cancelations were a smokescreen employed by Waiters’ agent to increase Waiters’ perceived value. Although we don’t hold him in as high esteem as many mock drafters, this panel concedes that at pick #18, Waiters could potentially be the steal of the draft. An intriguing prospect who can do many things pretty well, and who has an NBA-ready physical profile, Waiters is a well-rounded shooting guard. His defense at Syracuse was really very good. Combined with Rubio’s surprising defensive ability, Minnesota could groom a disruptive backcourt to create opportunities on the fast break, where Rubio and Waiters already excel. Waiters attacks the basket relentlessly, and doesn’t quit on tough, contested finishes. He doesn’t possess elite speed but manages his pace well. Waiters’ biggest weakness is in the half court and isolation area, but this should be mitigated in part by Rubio’s creativity and by Love forcing defenses to open up with his versatility.\n\nMinnesota has a ton of $4-$5 million contracts this coming year (Milicic, Barea, Williams, Pekovic, Johnson) and several more $4-$5 million contracts that can be terminated through either team options or not providing a qualifying offer (Webster, Miller, Randolph). The Wolves should excise themselves of as many mid-range contracts as they can, stay the course and draft a quality shooting guard here (if they can), and continue to build this coming year. They have the luxury of being competitive while they figure out the pieces to keep, and the ones to discard. After the 2012-2013 season, the Wolves could potentially only have Rubio, Love, Barea, Ridnour, Waiters (if drafted) and Malcolm Lee under contract. Everyone else on the roster is expendable, and (fortunately) removable via not exercising their respective team options or qualifying offers. This panel member expects the Wolves to extend Pekovic before that time, and also to try to move either Barea or Ridnour. Minnesota could offer free agents at that time a sizeable contract and the opportunity to play with an exciting, and supremely talented point guard in Rubio, and alongside one of the league’s most fan-friendly (read: Caucasian) young stars, Kevin Love. (C. Dirks)\n\n**Update: The Minnesota Timberwolves traded this pick to the Rockets for Chase Budinger. Also, Dion Waiters has shot up the draft boards, being rumored as high as #4 to Cleveland, but more likely within the 8-18 range.**"
