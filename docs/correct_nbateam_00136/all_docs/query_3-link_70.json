The 10 points she earned were pivotal in Wilson’s ability to win back-to-back state titles.\n\nWebster also finished first in the Moore League Finals (20-9.50 PR) and CIF Southern Section Division 1 Finals (19-7.50),\n\n“Hopefully, 22 (feet) next year. Look out for that,” Webster said after her win at the state meet in Clovis.\n\nWebster also anchored Wilson’s 4×100 relay team to a sixth-place finish at the state meet in 46.64, which gave the Bruins three key points in the team standings.\n\nCOACH OF THE YEAR\n\nNeil Nelson, Wilson\n\nWilson track coach Neil Nelson led the Bruins to back-to-back CIF State championships for the first time in program history.\n\nNelson believes a three-peat is possible next year. His team returns several top athletes who scored individually at the state meet, including juniors Loren Webster and Kaylin Edwards, sophomore Brooke Blue and freshman Saniah Varnado. The Bruins, who won the state title in the 4×400 relay, are also expected to be competitive in the 4×100 and 4×800 relays.\n\n“I know we have to put the hard work in. I know we have to get back and we have to grind, but we know how hard it was this year so we’re going to grind even harder to get it back (next year),” Nelson said after winning a second straight CIF title.\n\nWilson scored 36 points to defeat runner-up Ventura (30 points) at Buchanan High on May 25.\n\nDREAM TEAM\n\n(All race distances in meters)\n\n100: Leila Holland, Long Beach Poly, Jr.; Brooklyn Lee, Long Beach Poly; So.; Aniyah Brooks, Long Beach Poly, So.; Dylan Nelson, St. Pius X-St. Matthias, Fr.\n\n200: Dylan Nelson, St. Pius X-St. Matthias, Fr.; Nevaeh Lewis, Long Beach Poly, Jr.; Leila Holland, Long Beach Poly, Jr.; Amaya Rice, Lakewood, Jr.; Brooklyn Lee, Long Beach Poly, So.\n\n400: Brooke Blue, Wilson, So.; Saniah Vanardo, Wilson, Fr.; Jaylin Hunter, Long Beach Poly, Jr.; Aliyah Stokes, Long Beach Poly, So.\n\n800: Shirayah Lewis-Williams, Long Beach Poly, Fr.\n\n1,600: Avery Peck, Long Beach Poly, So.\n\n3,200: Avery Peck, Long Beach Poly, So.\n\n100 hurdles: Kaylin Edwards, Wilson, Jr.; Anise Becker, Long Beach Poly, Sr.; Alene Washington, Wilson, Jr.; Jamiyah Sanders, Wilson, Jr.\n\n300 hurdles: Saniah Vanardo, Wilson, Fr.; Kaylin Edwards, Wilson, Jr.; Anise Becker, Long Beach Poly, Sr.; Morgan King, Long Beach Poly, Sr.\n\n4×100 relay: Long Beach Poly; Wilson; St. Joseph.\n\n4×400 relay: Wilson; Long Beach Poly.\n\n4×800 relay: Wilson.\n\nLong jump: Loren Webster, Wilson, Jr.; Tarynn Maroney, Wilson, Sr.; Maya Gonsalves, St. Joseph, Jr.\n\nTriple jump: Journii Spencer, Wilson, So.; Samiya Stevens, Jordan, Sr.; DaQari Hampton, Wilson, Sr.\n\nHigh jump: Jillene Wettland, Long Beach Poly, Jr.; Joy Anderson, Long Beach Poly, Jr.; Sanna Trotter, Los Alamitos, Sr.; Sadie Dixon, St. Pius X-St. Matthias, Sr.\n\nShot put: Mai Ricks, Long Beach Poly, Sr.; Kirss Reyes, Warren, Jr.\n\nDiscus: Mai Ricks, Long Beach Poly, Sr.; Lily Ellis, Los Alamitos, Sr.; Kirssy Reyes, Warren, Jr.\n\nPole vault: Olivia Bettinger, Los Alamitos, Jr.; Celia Polk, Valley Christian, Fr."
