He has upgraded his workouts and practice time with the team over the past three weeks.\n\nMilicic on TV in Detroit: Friday’s game was televised live in the Detroit area, giving Pistons fans a rare sight: Darko Milicic in an NBA starting lineup. Milicic had an unfulfilling 2 1/2-year career with Detroit, which made him the No. 2 overall pick in the NBA draft.\n\nMilicic, who started Friday’s game, made only three starts in 96 games with the Pistons before he was traded to Orlando, leaving the Pistons with the reputation of being one of the draft’s biggest busts. Today, Milicic has started 22 of the Wolves’ 23 games and leads the NBA in blocked shots (2.67 per game).\n\nMilicic recovered from a bruised right quadriceps in time to play against his former team and finish with a career-high seven blocked shots, 11 points and five rebounds.\n\nLove chasing Wallace: Kevin Love’s 18 rebounds extended his streak to nine consecutive games with at least 15 rebounds. It’s the longest such streak since Detroit center Ben Wallace had a 14-game streak in 2002-03. Wallace did not play Friday night.\n\nFlynn recap: Wolves point guard Jonny Flynn had 12 assists but seven turnovers Friday night in the Sioux Falls Skyforce’s 120-102 loss to the Tulsa 66ers in the NBA Development League.\n\nFlynn played 30 minutes and finished with eight points on 2-for-8 shooting and five rebounds. Flynn will play again for the Skyforce tonight against Tulsa before returning to the Wolves for practice on Sunday. Based on assessments of his performance in the two games, the Wolves will consider activating Flynn for the team’s five-game West Coast trip, which begins Tuesday at Golden State.\n\nBriefly: Despite a snowstorm warning in the Twin Cities area, the Wolves were scheduled to leave for Chicago after Friday’s game. They hoped to get into Chicago late Friday night in order to have a shootaround practice this morning at United Center.\n\nThe Wolves wore their alternate black uniforms for the first time Friday night. They will play in them once more this season.\n\nOriginally Published: December 9, 2010 at 11:01 p.m."
