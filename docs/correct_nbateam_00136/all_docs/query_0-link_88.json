With an explosive style of play, Edwards has quickly established himself as a force to be reckoned with on the court. His 2021 Rookie of the Year campaign showcased his incredible athleticism and scoring ability, promising a bright future for both Edwards and the Timberwolves. As the franchise continues to build around this young star, his place among the greatest Timberwolves small forwards is already secure.\n\n2\n\nWally Szczerbiak\n\nAge: 47\n\nBirthplace : Madrid, Spain\n\nNationality : Spanish\n\nTeam : Boston Celtics, Cleveland Cavaliers, Minnesota Timberwolves, Seattle Supersonics\n\nPosition : Small forward\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: 1999–2006\n\nAn integral part of the Minnesota Timberwolves' history, Wally Szczerbiak joined the team as the sixth overall pick in the 1999 NBA Draft. Known for his prolific scoring and sharpshooting from beyond the arc, Szczerbiak was a matchup nightmare for opposing defenses. His tenacity and consistent play earned him an NBA All-Star selection in 2002 while playing for the Timberwolves. As one of the franchise's most beloved players, Szczerbiak's time in Minnesota will always be remembered as a highlight for the organization.\n\nBirthplace : Markham, Thornhill, Canada\n\nNationality : Canada\n\nTeam : Golden State Warriors\n\nPosition : Small foward\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: 2014–2020\n\nDrafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers and then traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2014, Andrew Wiggins quickly emerged as a vital part of the franchise's future. Known for his exceptional athletic ability and scoring prowess, Wiggins became a Rookie of the Year recipient in 2015 while donning the Timberwolves' uniform. His solid play throughout his tenure with the team made him a cornerstone piece of the lineup.

As a key contributor to the team's deep playoff run during the 2003-2004 season, Sprewell's impact on the organization was undeniable. With an innate ability to score and defend multiple positions, he was viewed as the missing piece for a squad that had its sights set on championship contention. Although he failed to capture a title in Minnesota, Sprewell left a lasting impression on the fans and organization alike.\n\nBirthplace : Columbus, Georgia\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Small forward\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: 1989–1992, 1995–2002\n\nDrafted by the Houston Rockets in 1985, Sam Mitchell signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves during their inaugural season in 1989. Mitchell quickly became a crucial player for the young franchise, providing solid defense, rebounding, and veteran leadership. Over his two tenures with the team, Mitchell left his mark with strong performances on both ends of the court. He remains an essential figure in the Timberwolves' history, having also coached the team later in his career.\n\nBirthplace : Portland, Tennessee, USA\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Denver Nuggets\n\nPosition : Shooting guard, Small forward\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: 2007–2011, 2013–2014\n\nJoining the Minnesota Timberwolves as the seventh overall pick in the 2007 NBA Draft, Corey Brewer quickly established himself as a tenacious defender and an adept scorer on the fast break. With his high motor and relentless pursuit of loose balls, Brewer was a fan favorite for his energy and hustle. His well-rounded skill set helped the Timberwolves maintain a strong presence on the wing. Although his tenure in Minnesota was split between two separate stints, Brewer's impact on the franchise remains significant."
