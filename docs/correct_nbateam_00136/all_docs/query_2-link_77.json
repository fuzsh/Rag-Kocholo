        "text": "WASHINGTON - GW men's basketball alumnus James Bishop IV will begin his professional career as part of the Minnesota Timberwolves NBA2K25 Summer League team, held in Las Vegas from July 12-22.\n\nBishop and the Wolves will open play on Friday, July 12 vs the New Orleans Pelicans at 5 p.m. with live coverage on ESPN2. The additional three pool play games will also air on national television, including matchups with the Indiana Pacers (July 14, 5:30 p.m., NBATV), Philadelphia 76ers (July 16, 8 p.m., ESPN2) and Houston Rockets (July 18, 11 p.m., ESPN).\n\nA three-time All-Atlantic 10 performer, Bishop finished his career in the Buff and Blue third on the program's all-time scoring list with 2,103 points. He also ranks among GW's all-time top-10 in career 3-pointers made (t-3rd), field goals (4th), free throws made (4th) and assists (6th) during his four years in Foggy Bottom.\n\nThis marks the second-straight year in which a GW alum has played for the Timberwolves in the summer league following Brendan Adams' appearance last summer. Bishop will aim to become the 11th George Washington player to appear in an NBA game in its history."
