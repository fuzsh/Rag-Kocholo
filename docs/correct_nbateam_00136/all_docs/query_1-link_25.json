        "text": "The way Martell Webster shrugged his shoulders after his career-best matching seventh 3-pointer in the Wizards’ 127 -105 blowout of Phoenix on Saturday harkened back to the prime of Michael Jordan’s career. But the swingman’s career-high 34 points had John Wall thinking ahead about next year. “I already talked to Ted about that one,” Wall said, referring to Wizards owner Ted Leonsis. “That’s an easy, hands down question about trying to get [Webster] back here because him being a free agent, there’s a lot of people that are going to come after him.”\n\nBut despite the trying times, Webster still thought there was a chance the Wolves would pick up his $5.7 million option. He went to Florida to train and Kahn came down to watch him workout. Kahn told him they were definitely considering keeping him around and that they’d be in touch. But Webster’s phone never rang and he found out he was done in Minnesota while watching TV. “It just would have been more respectful if I would have gotten a phone call (from Kahn) instead of seeing it on the ESPN ticker,” Webster said. “That is just me. Maybe that is the way it is done, but I think it would have been a bit more tasteful if I would have gotten a phone call.”\n\nOn Monday night, the Wizards hosted a Special Olympics basketball game on the practice court at Verizon Center. The matchup between the two teams of Special Olympians was refereed by John Wall and Cartier Martin, and coached by Martell Webster, Garrett Temple, Chris Singleton, and Trevor Booker, and it became clear very quickly that these six Wizards players were going to be taking this game very seriously. Webster immediately made his presence known by playfully arguing with Wall after the teams were announced. Wall handed Webster a technical before the game even started, and the tone was set."
