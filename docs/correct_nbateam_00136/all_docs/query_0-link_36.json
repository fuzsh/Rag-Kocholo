        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Timberwolves guard Martell Webster is out indefinitely while he recovers from back surgery.\n\nThe Timberwolves made the announcement on Friday, the day they held their media day and first practice of training camp. Webster had a microdiscectomy on Sept. 28\n\nThe Wolves say he is being evaluated by the team's medical staff, but would not provide a timeline for his return.\n\nWebster was limited by back problems last year as well and played in only 46 games. He averaged 9.8 points and 3.2 rebounds after coming over in a trade with Portland on draft night.\n\nThe injury will open up more playing time at shooting guard for Wes Johnson and Wayne Ellington.\n\n(© Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.
