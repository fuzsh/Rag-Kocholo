        "text": "Regular Season: October – April\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves have been bringing NBA basketball action to Minneapolis for nearly 20 years. An expansion team that joined the NBA in the 1989-90 basketball season, the Minnesota Timberwolves played their first game on November 3, 1989 and recorded their first win a week later: a 125-118 victory over the 76ers. In the years since then, the MN Timberwolves have made playoff appearances eight years in a row, from 1997 to 2004. The Twin Cities professional basketball team captured its first title — the Midwest Division title — in 2004. That same year, forward Kevin Garnett became the first Timberwolves player ever named the NBA’s MVP.\n\nThe team got its name from a naming contest in which 17 entrants suggested that Minnesota’s NBA sports franchise be called the Timberwolves.\n\nThe Timberwolves is not the first professional basketball team Minnesota has ever had. Its predecessors include the Minneapolis Lakers, a five-time title winner, as well as the American Basketball Association’s Minnesota Muskies and Minnesota Pipers.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\n600 First Avenue N\n\nMinneapolis, MN 55403\n\nPhone: (612) 673-1600\n\nTicketmaster: (651) 989-5151\n\nHome Arena:\n\nTarget Center\n\n600 First Avenue North\n\nMinneapolis, MN 55403\n\nBox Office: (612) 673-0900"
