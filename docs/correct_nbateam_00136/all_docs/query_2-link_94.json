        "text": "All it took was one Denver Nuggets victory to alter the complexion of their Western Conference semifinals series against the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nMinnesota’s 2-0 series lead, winning both games in Denver, indicated the Nuggets were doomed and that repeating as NBA champions was not in Denver’s future.\n\nLet’s hold off on that sentiment, at least for now.\n\nThe Nuggets defeated the Timberwolves 117-90 in Game 3 Friday, and no matter how the series got here, it’s 2-1 Minnesota, and Denver can put pressure on the Timberwolves and add intrigue to the series with a victory in Game 4 Sunday (8 p.m. ET, TNT).\n\nGame 3 wasn’t a must-win for Denver in the traditional sense, but no team has come back from a 3-0 deficit. It was a game the Nuggets needed to win if they wanted to give themselves a chance to win the series.\n\nThis was by far the best the Nuggets have looked in the series, and they cooked the Timberwolves through the first three quarters for a 93-66 lead headed into the final 12 minutes.\n\nNuggets guard Jamal Murray, coming off a tough Game 2 – eight points on 3-for-18 shooting – and $100,000 fine for throwing objects in the direction of a referee (and he should be thankful he wasn’t suspended), had 24 points, five assists and four rebounds.\n\nDenver center Nikola Jokic, who won his third MVP in four seasons on Wednesday, had 24 points, 14 rebounds, nine assists, three blocks and three steals. The Nuggets are tough to beat when Murray and Jokic have it going like that, and all five starters reached double figures in scoring, including 21 from Michael Porter Jr.\n\nIt was the offensive performance expected from the Nuggets – 53.8% from the field and 48.3% on 3-pointers.\n\nDenver’s concerns aren’t alleviated with a win. Murray was questionable for Game 3 with a strained left calf, and anyone who watches the Nuggets regularly can see that he isn’t 100%. He had three-plus days between Game 2 and Game 3 to give that calf a rest and get treatment. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (bruised abdomen) and Reggie Jackson (bruised left calf) were also questionable and it’s back to every other day for the next three scheduled games.\n\nNow, did the Nuggets find a Minnesota weakness in the off days? It’s the playoffs, and adjustments are necessary, especially in a seven-game series featuring quality teams. But more often than not, a team needs to play better and smarter, and that’s what Denver did.\n\nIt’s difficult to eliminate a defending champion, and that’s the next step for the Timberwolves, who haven’t been to the conference finals since 2004. Just like Game 3 wasn’t a “must win” for Denver, Game 4 is not a “must win” for Minnesota.\n\n“It’s just one game. We’re still down in the series and have a long way to go,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.\n\nBut the Nuggets are closer to where they want to be than they were four days ago."
