        "text": "Five former UCLA men's basketball players have been listed to rosters for the upcoming NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, which runs from July 12-22.\n\nAmari Bailey, Jules Bernard, Adem Bona, Moses Brown and Jaylen Clark are scheduled to compete for their respective NBA teams in Las Vegas, while Bona has already played in three games in the NBA Summer League contests in Salt Lake City. Bona, selected No. 41 in the 2024 NBA Draft by Philadelphia, averaged 5.7 points, 5.7 rebounds and 3.0 blocks in three Salt Lake City summer league contests (July 8-10).\n\nBailey and Clark were both selected in the second round of last summer's NBA Draft. Bailey will be suiting up this month for the Los Angeles Clippers' summer league team, while Clark will be taking the court with the Minnesota Timberwolves. In addition, Bernard will be playing for the Washington Wizards and Brown will compete for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nBailey spent last season playing in the NBA and the NBA's G League with the Charlotte Hornets organization. He appeared in 10 games with Charlotte during the regular season. Clark continued to rehab from an injury sustained at the end of the 2022-23 college season and missed the entire NBA season. Upcoming games in Las Vegas will mark Clark's return to the court since he was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves in June 2023.\n\nBernard returns to the NBA Summer League after having spent last season playing for the Washington Wizards, as well as the organization's G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go. A four-year player for the Bruins from 2019-22, Bernard helped lead the Bruins to the Final Four in 2021 and the Sweet 16 as a senior in 2022. Last season, he competed in 19 games for the Wizards.\n\nBrown, set to compete with the Lakers' summer league squad, played at UCLA as a freshman in 2018-19 and saw action in 22 games last season for the Portland Trail Blazers. Brown, who was added to the Lakers' roster on Thursday, has played in 150 total NBA games over the past five NBA seasons, most recently competing for the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nThree of the former UCLA players – Bailey, Bona and Clark – were college teammates during the 2022-23 season. That year, the Bruins went 31-6 overall and won the Pac-12 Conference's regular-season crown before advancing to the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16.\n\nBernard played alongside Brown as freshmen in 2018-19, and Bernard overlapped with Clark during the Bruins' 2020-21 and 2021-22 basketball seasons.\n\nNBA Summer League contests in Las Vegas (schedule here) will begin on Friday, July 12, with a seven-game slate lined up that day between two venues (Thomas & Mack Center, and Cox Pavilion). Former UCLA players who could be in action on Friday include Bailey with the Los Angeles Clippers, Brown with the Los Angeles Lakers, Clark with the Minnesota Timberwolves and Bernard with the Washington Wizards. Philadelphia's first game in Las Vegas is scheduled for Saturday, July 13.\n\nGames in Las Vegas will be televised live on the ESPN family of networks and NBA TV."
