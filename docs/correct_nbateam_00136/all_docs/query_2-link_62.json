I felt all the big bodies,” Wahl told reporters this week. “But at the end of the day it’s always fun to get in here, compete, get better, and I’m ready to work towards something here.”\n\nEssentially, what the 23-year-old is working toward is an opportunity. After five collegiate seasons at Wisconsin, Wahl went undrafted — which he expected — and quickly received an invitation to join the Timberwolves’ Summer League team, which also wasn’t a surprise.\n\n“That was kind of the first call after the draft, and we jumped right on it,” Wahl said. “I feel like I had a pretty good (pre-draft) workout here. … (My agent and I) feel like we had somewhat of an idea of what was going to happen, but it’s really a dream come true to be here, be in the hometown, just 30 minutes from home. I really couldn’t ask for a better start.”\n\nThe Wolves kick off Summer League competition at 4 p.m. Central time Friday in Las Vegas with a game against the New Orleans Pelicans. How much Wahl plays in that game – or any Summer League game – remains to be seen. Minnesota’s Summer League roster is packed with draft picks that figure into the NBA team’s future plans. The team’s NBA roster spots are all spoken for, though two-way roster spots are fluid until the season begins.\n\nStill, Wahl landed with the Timberwolves for a reason.\n\n“He plays hard, man. He plays really hard,” Timberwolves Summer League head coach Chris Hines said. “I like the fact he has a nose for the ball, offensive rebounds, he’s a smart guy. We’ll definitely utilize him.”\n\nThose were certainly Wahl’s primary traits with the Badgers — a gritty defender and rebounder who was willing to do the little things required to win. If he can show that in Las Vegas, whether that be in games or even just practice, he could land with the Wolves’ G-League team in Iowa.\n\nEarlier this week, Wahl wasn’t overly consumed with his expected role over the coming week-plus of competition.\n\n“At the end of the day, I think it’s just about getting better every single day,” he said. “I’m going to go out there, try to prove that I belong out here and get my best foot forward. Give that energy, be communicating with everybody and just be a positive impact on the team.\n\n“I’m just happy to really be here and give all that I have.”\n\nOriginally Published: July 11, 2024 at 1:46 p.m."
