        "text": "We would not be able to do events like our upcoming \"Golf Fore Vets\" without all the generous support we get from our partners. Those events then go right back to serving veterans. PepsiCo's Kevin Toolan and Jeff Cyrus stopped by VOC with a donation of auction items and a check for the event. They also received a tour of our facility and learned more about our core mission. Thank you, Pepsi for helping us to serve our veterans!\n\nHappy to be part of the Courtyard Rochester Downtown as we give back to the community! The Veterans Outreach Center does so much for our community. Thanks for the photo op Michele H. Martell"
