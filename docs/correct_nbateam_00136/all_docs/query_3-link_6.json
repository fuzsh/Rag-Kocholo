        "text": "The Week Ahead: Managers have access to update and add events via the button +EVENT.\n\nStaff : Team Staff will be added as they complete their registration and training/screening/CEP sign-up requirements. All Team Staff should ONLY be added by the webmaster. This ensures that all staff have completed their requirements before they take on a team management role.\n\nTeam Feed: Any messages posted to the feed by parents or Managers will show up on the website as well as be emailed to parents. Public messages can be seen everyone, while team only messages can only be seen if team parents are logged in. Images can be included, however, some parents are sensitive to images of their children being posted. Please discuss this issue with the parents before posting. Note: until all players are registered, the team feed has limited value.\n\nPublic message example:\n\nWho to contact to schedule games, including phone number and email\n\nMajor game wins or tournament successes\n\nSponsorships\n\nGames: Managers must enter all games with the event type of “GAME,” which allows you to enter the game score. The Ice Scheduler will enter all game slots as practice then add a game slot over the top of it.\n\nNote: Please do not delete the game slot entered by the Ice Scheduler as this game slot prompts him/her to order referees! Managers should only edit the game and add or change opponents. If the Manager deletes the game without notifying the Ice Scheduler and Webmaster, then referees will not be cancelled. The Manager must notify the Ice Scheduler and Webmaster of the decision to cancel a scrimmage and use the ice as practice (or vice versa). Do not assume putting a game designator on practice ice will get referees scheduled.\n\nGame scores: Managers should post team game scores as they occur. Managers login, go to the GAMES tab and click on EDIT to enter the game score.\n\nScrimmages: can be designated by putting \"scrimmage\" in the opponent field along with the opponent name (example: \"Batavia - Scrimmage\").\n\nAway games: Managers can add away games either from the HOME page +EVENT interface, or the +EVENT on the Schedule page.\n\nTournaments: If you sent the Webmaster your tournaments, they were entered as event type \"GAME\" – one game per day with the opponent either “TBD – Travel” for a travel day to a tournament more than 4 hours away (and must be the day of actual travel), or “TBD – Tournament”. Once the Tournament schedule is received, you can update the existing slots with the correct times/opponents and (if necessary) add games to match the tournament schedule.\n\nTravel days: If you are leaving Thursday because the Friday through Sunday tournament is located more than four hours away, Thursday is approved for a travel day, but Wednesday and Monday are not. The Ice Scheduler can override any travel days for practice assignments if your team’s request is not reasonable. If you are going to a Tournament someplace where you can’t reasonably get back Sunday evening, then Monday is approved. Every travel day you request will scramble the schedule for another team (or many teams) or you may lose practices if switches can not be made.\n\nThis view shows all events entered by the Ice Scheduler (practices and slots for games), the Webmaster and Team Manager. There are two formats – calendar and listing. An icon in the upper right corner allows the user to switch formats. Event types are game, practice, training, meeting and other. The Ice Scheduler can only see games on their display.\n\nEvents can be edited or deleted by the Team Manager (whether they were entered by the Team Manager or Webmaster). The Webmaster enters tournaments (if the manager does not have access yet), Webster events your team should be aware of, and reminders for team clinics. (Clinics show up as practice and not switchable/cancelable.) Do not delete the clinic reminders.\n\nEvents entered by the Ice Scheduler (practices and slots for games) can only be removed by the Ice Scheduler, so any game slots not being used must be cancelled by the team according to the cancellation policy (Webster Ice Arena rule is 30 days notice), or the team should plan on using the ice for additional practice.\n\nIt is the Manager's responsibility to check their game slots and ensure the correct ones have been removed or added after requests to the Ice Scheduler."
