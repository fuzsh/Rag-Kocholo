There is no layout or direction as to where you are and what you are ordering. The idea behind this okay, but even as a 26 year old tech savvy person this is not even convenient anymore. It can be nice for busy games. But to have this as the ONLY option for ordering food is a joke. If my parents wanted to come to a game and had to use this they would never even figure out how to use it and end up spending zero dollars and likely never returning to a game.\n\nYou are eliminating and entire market by doing this. The app is messy and needs a lot of work. Good luck but I hope youâre okay with losing out on concession sales until you figure your app navigation out. Make this an option and not mandatory and you might be alright."
