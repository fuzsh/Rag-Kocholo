The Wizards have 13 roster spots, so they can sign up to two more players. [Us via ESPN's Marc Stein]\n\nHere's a scouting report on Webster from jkhan15. [Us]\n\nWebster isn't the only guy the Wizards are considering. They've also checked out Michael Redd, Shawne Williams and Terrence Williams. [Wizards Insider]\n\nSeveral other teams are interested in Redd as well. [Sam Amico]\n\nGilbert Arenas is back on Twitter, according to John Wall. This should be interesting. [@BulletsForever]\n\nAnd Arenas wants to return to the Wizards. [@_agentzeroshow]\n\nUPDATE: Apparently it's a fake.\n\nA reminder that Bradley Beal is not the savior. Not sure why a reminder was needed, but OK. [Truth About It]\n\nA long interview with Beal at the rookie photoshoot, where he discussed what he does to get ready for games and much more. [Dime]\n\nWhy Anthony Davis is not a shoo-in for Rookie of the Year. [SB Nation]\n\nThe Southeast Division, much like the rest of the NBA, does not have many good true centers. [CSN Washington]\n\nCongratulations to SB Nation's own Scott Schroeder, who has been named the director of basketball operations for the Sioux Falls SkyForce of the NBA Developmental League."
