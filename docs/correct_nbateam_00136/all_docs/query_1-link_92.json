        "text": "In the wake of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, Milwaukee is set to host the 2024 Republican National Convention this week.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will make an appearance Monday at the Republican National Convention, said RNC committee member David Bossie in an interview with WISN-TV. \"The welcome that he's going to get here, I think, is going to be a very emotional and overwhelming thing,\" Bossie said.\n\nWill his entrance be epic? Certain corners of social media are begging for or looking forward to a grand show as Trump enters the convention in primetime.\n\nThink WWE more than Rose Garden statement.\n\nThis is what that looks like:\n\nHis entrance to Ultimate Fighting Championship 295 in November brought the crowd to a full-throat cheer. His retinue included pundit/personality Tucker Carlson, rock musician Kid Rock and UFC President Dana White.\n\nHundreds if not thousands of arms reached out at Madison Square Garden to record the former president as he walked by. Kid Rock was drinking what looked like a beer. The scene was high energy.\n\nTrump has shown the instincts of a showman over and over.\n\nJust a day after a gunman tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the GOP candidate’s website redirected to a fundraising platform for conservative candidates across the U.S.\n\nAn all-black landing page featured Trump’s campaign logo, with a black-and-white photograph of Trump raising his fist shortly after the shooting occurred, blood streaked across his face.\n\n“I am Donald J. Trump,” the page reads. “FEAR NOT! I will always love you for supporting me.”\n\nThe July 13 shooting, allegedly carried out by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, killed one person in the stands behind Trump and critically injured two others. Trump's image, rising with blood on his face, is already iconic.\n\nWhat is the plan for Trump entrance to RNC?\n\nA 2024 RNC Trump entrance that would set social media on fire is not official.\n\nRNC Co-Chair Lara Trump laughed about it as far back as May when a podcaster asked her if his entrance would match 2016.\n\nAt the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump entered backlit by blinding lights.\n\nBlaring from the loudspeakers: \"We Are The Champions\" by Queen.\n\nFog rolled and rolled across the stage. The crowd went wild.\n\n'Many Men' the soundtrack of Trump defiance on social\n\nWhat would the soundtrack be this time, in 2024, if social media chose it?\n\nA song by 50 Cent about surviving attacks has long been a meme that signals toughness, resilience. Now \"Many Men\" is getting heavy use after the shooting of Donald Trump. The song from 50 Cent's \"Get Rich or Die Tryin” album brings attitude with the intro:\n\nMany men wish death upon me / Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see\n\nI'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be / And (n—) tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)\n\nAlmost immediately after the Trump shooting on July 13, the Internet was putting the video footage of a defiant Trump, blood on his face, to this song.\n\n50 Cent posted a Get Rich or Die Tryin’ cover edit on Saturday night featuring Trump’s face on his body.\n\nShift in tone for Trump?\n\nOther reports claim that the attempted assassination has changed Trump's tone going into the convention.\n\nTrump told the Washington Examiner he has completely rewritten his keynote speech, which he is set to deliver Thursday. The previous draft took aim at President Joe Biden's policies. Now, Trump plans to call for national unity, according to the Washington Examiner.\n\nHerb Asher, a professor of political science at Ohio State, speculated the shooting might boost Trump’s campaign in his state even more.\n\nHe compared the potential effects with those of other historical incidents, such as the attempted 1981 assassination of President Ronald Reagan and the shooting of Gabby Giffords, which mobilized public sentiment.\n\nTrump is expected to take the stage at the Republican National Convention this week, where the topic of the Pennsylvania shooting is expected to play a central role in the event.\n\n“Events like these can galvanize a base, as seen with Reagan, or lead to significant shifts in policy and political engagement,” Asher said.\n\n— Genevieve Redsten and Jack Wolf contributed to this article."
