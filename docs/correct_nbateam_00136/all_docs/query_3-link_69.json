        "text": "The Webster City boys basketball squad dropped their North Central Conference finale on Tuesday against Algona, 56-41.\n\nSenior Briar Klaver had 16 points for the Lynx, who fell to 6-14 overall and 6-8 in the NCC — good for fifth place. The team’s final regular-season game was Thursday at home versus Boone.\n\nSenior Jack Larson grabbed seven rebounds. Jace Larson contributed five boards and blocked three shots.\n\nWebster City struggled from distance, converting on just two of its 14 three-point tries.\n\nBen Helmers (19 points), Alex Manske (15) and Evan Allie (10) paced the Bulldogs, who finished the regular season with a 14-7 record. Algona played in the Class 3A state tournament a year ago.\n\nAlgona also defeated the Lynx last month, 47-44.\n\nWebster City’s 3A substate opener will be at Ballard on Monday night. The Bombers are the No. 2 seed in the bracket; the Lynx are the seven.\n\nBallard is 13-7 overall."
