        "text": "The Washington Wizards have agreed to a contract with free agent swingman Martell Webster. Terms of the deal have yet to be announced, but the contract is expected to be for one-year and close to the league minimum. Via the Washington Post: “Webster, the former sixth overall pick of the 2005, has established a reputation as a perimeter threat over his time with Portland and Minnesota but he struggled last season while recovering from two back surgeries. He averaged 6.9 points and 3.6 rebounds but shot a career-low 33.9 percent in 47 games, including 26 starts, for the Timberwolves. Minnesota bought him out in July in a move that cleared up money for the team to make a run at restricted free agent Nicolas Batum, who wound up returning to Portland. Webster, 25, worked out for the Wizards at Verizon Center this week and the team quickly moved to lock up the 6-foot-7 player who has averaged 8.4 points per game and shot 37.4 percent from three-point range in seven seasons. Two years ago, Webster shot a career-high 41.7 percent from long distance.”"
