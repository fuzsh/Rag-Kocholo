        "text": "\"We talked about we needed a three,\" Adelman said. \"I think he caught the ball, stole it and maybe emotions got the best of him.\"\n\nWebster afterward said he was well aware of the time and situation. He said he hoped to either create a foul and 3-point play or score with enough time to foul the Nuggets yet again.\n\n\"I don't know, I don't know if it was a mental thing, like I shot [a three] before that and didn't knock it down,\" said Webster, who missed a three with the score tied with 53 seconds left. \"I just wanted to be aggressive, get to the rim, possibly get a foul. But I didn't.\n\n\"Most people probably would have pulled up for the 3-point shot. Yeah, I can see why they would. If I had to do it over again, I'd probably pull up for a three. Why not?\""
