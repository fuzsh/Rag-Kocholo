        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS -- The way Martell Webster sees it, he just got drafted for the second time.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves acquired the former lottery pick with Portland in a trade for the 16th overall pick on draft night last week. Many players would sulk after getting traded from a playoff contender to the second-worst team in the league, but Webster welcomes the change.\n\nThe swingman averaged 8.5 points per game in five seasons with the Blazers. But his playing time was limited when star Brandon Roy arrived the year after he was drafted.\n\nSo Webster is hoping the move, and the increased playing time he is expected to get with the young Timberwolves, will allow his career to blossom. He is expected to compete with Corey Brewer for the starting shooting guard position in Minnesota."
