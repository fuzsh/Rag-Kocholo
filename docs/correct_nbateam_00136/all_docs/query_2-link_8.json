        "text": "Minnesota Timberwolves, American professional basketball team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that plays in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nThe Timberwolves began play in 1989 as an expansion team alongside the Eastern Conference’s Orlando Magic. As a new team, the “T-Wolves” unsurprisingly struggled in their initial years in the league, winning no more than 29 games in any of their first seven seasons. In 1995 the Timberwolves’ vice president of basketball operations, former Boston Celtics star Kevin McHale, a Minnesota native, drafted teenage forward Kevin Garnett straight out of high school. Garnett soon led the team to the first playoff berth (1996–97) and winning season (1997–98) in franchise history. While Garnett turned the team’s fortunes around, he was unable to lead it past the first round of postseason play in any of Minnesota’s first seven playoff berths, through the 2002–03 season. Before the 2003–04 season the Timberwolves added veteran guards Sam Cassell and Latrell Sprewell. That season the team won its first division title and its first playoff series, advancing to the Western Conference finals before ultimately being eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nIn 2004–05 the Timberwolves failed to qualify for the postseason for the first time in eight years. They traded Garnett in 2007 in an effort to spur the rebuilding of the franchise. McHale left the franchise soon thereafter, and new management built a team centered on All-Star forward Kevin Love that steadily improved. In 2013–14 Minnesota had the 10th best scoring differential in the NBA but missed the playoffs with a 40–42 record in a historically strong Western Conference. Nevertheless, it was the team’s best finish in nine seasons. Love, a pending free agent, was traded during the following offseason, and a rebuilding Timberwolves team finished the 2014–15 season with the worst record in the NBA (16–66). During the 2017–18 season the Timberwolves rebuilt around a promising young core featuring center Karl-Anthony Towns that was complemented by veteran All-Star wing Jimmy Butler, and the team returned to the postseason after a 14-year playoff drought. However, Butler clashed with his coach and teammates and was traded away during the 2018–19 season, which ended with Minnesota finishing in last place in its division and missing the playoffs.\n\nAfter a pair of losing seasons, the Timberwolves showed marked improvement in 2021–22 with a 46–36 record, their best winning percentage since 2003–04. Second-year guard Anthony Edwards (known as “Ant Man”) and Towns led the team to the playoffs, where Minnesota lost in the first round to the Memphis Grizzlies. In the offseason the T-Wolves made a blockbuster trade with the Utah Jazz for perennial Defensive Player of the Year candidate Rudy Gobert. Although an injury to Towns during the following season limited the team’s competitiveness, Edwards had a breakout year, proving himself capable of being Minnesota’s leader and earning an invitation to the All-Star Game. Despite losing again in the first round of the playoffs, the Timberwolves’ strong performance against the eventual champion Denver Nuggets in that series impressed observers around the league."
