        "text": "The Blazers were busy last night, firing their GM, and unloading Martell Webster off to the Wolves. The Oregonian fills us in: “The Trail Blazers have traded Martell Webster to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Ryan Gomes and the draft rights to Luke Babbitt, a source told the The Oregonian. In Babbitt, a sophomore from Nevada, the Blazers will fulfill their stated desire to add perimeter shooting. Babbitt averaged 21.9 points and 8.9 rebounds per game last season and shot 50 percent from the field — including 41.6 percent from three-point range. The 6-foot-9 small forward, who has a 6-11 wingspan, also shot 91.7 percent from the free-throw line, which ranked third in the NCAA … The trade ends Webster’s five-year run with the Blazers, who drafted him No. 6 overall in the 2005 draft. The small forward, who batted inconsistency throughout his career, averaged 9.4 points and 3.3 rebounds last season.”"
