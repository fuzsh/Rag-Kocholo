After following Luke for a few months and with Rudy now likely not participating I'm concerned about our backup 3. Martell was our best wing defender when Nic was out and when Nic was healthy Martell allowed us to keep one defender on the court at all times. If this team is healthy and an outside contender Martell could have given us valuable minutes this upcoming season. I don't expect anything from Luke this year."
