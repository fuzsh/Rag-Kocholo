        "text": "Located in the heart of downtown Minneapolis’ vibrant sports and entertainment district, Target Center is proud home to the NBA’s Minnesota Timberwolves, and four-time WNBA world champion Minnesota Lynx. Over 1 million guests visit the arena every year - making Target Center one of the top arenas in the world.\n\nTarget Center completed a MAJOR renovation in 2017 - transforming the venue into a state-of-the art arena. Totaling $145 Million, the project encompassed infrastructural improvements, guest experience enhancements and aesthetic changes on all levels of the arena. The renovation project was a joint venture between the Minnesota Timberwolves/Lynx, City of Minneapolis and AEG Facilities.\n\nTarget Center opened in October 1990. The facility is owned by the City of Minneapolis and managed privately by ASM Global. Target has been the naming rights partner of the arena since its opening.\n\nVenue Management\n\nTarget Center’s original owners, Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner, owned and operated the venue and the Minnesota Timberwolves for the first 5 years. In March of 1995, Harv and Marv sold the arena to the City of Minneapolis and Ogden Entertainment was brought on board to manage the facility. Ogden Entertainment managed the facility until September 22, 2000 when the management rights were acquired by SFX Entertainment.\n\nIn early 2001, Clear Channel Entertainment bought SFX Entertainment and the facility became part of the Clear Channel Entertainment family. Clear Channel Entertainment managed the venue and a Minneapolis based regional concert promoter office until May 2004. On May 1, 2004 a joint venture between the Minnesota Timberwolves organization joined forces with Los Angeles based concert promoter, Nederlander Concerts, to create Midwest Entertainment Group (MEG). At that time, this joint venture stepped in as the venue manager. This partnership oversaw the day-to-day operation and booking of Target Center until spring 2006. In May of 2006, Midwest Entertainment Group (MEG) shifted from the joint venture partnership to 100% ownership by the Minnesota Timberwolves organization.\n\nOn May 2, 2007 AEG Facilities, now ASM Global, assumed the management contract of Target Center. The City of Minneapolis continues to own the arena while ASM Global manages its day-to-day operations. Target Center is part of an elite venue network of ASM Global.\n\nAbout ASM Global\n\nASM Global was formed in October 2019 from the merger of AEG Facilities, the global innovator in live entertainment venues, and SMG, the gold standard in event management. As the world’s leading venue management company and producer of live event experiences, ASM Global is the preeminent management and content partner with over 350 venues worldwide.
