        "text": "Even seven-year NBA veterans forget their car keys.\n\nWashington Wizards guard Martell Webster compounded the embarrassing mistake by flying halfway across the country home. When the team arrived at Dulles International Airport in Northern Virginia on Saturday, Webster went to his car with intents to head home. Only, he had left his keys in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nHe had one of the apps on his phone to enter the car, but couldn't start it.\n\n\"Good thing I have a wife that loves me. She came and got me,\" Webster told The Washington Post. \"I slept in my car for two hours, I'm not going to lie. I called my wife I was like, 'You know what it is 3:30. I'll let you sleep a couple more hours but you need to come get me.' And she got me; we're good.\"\n\nClearly, Webster is a loving husband and calm guy for not panicking, but we do wonder how comfortable a 6-7, 230-pound man can be sleeping in a car.\n\n\"As long as I had shelter I was good,\" Webster told the Post. \"By the time I had figured out my keys were in Kansas City everybody was gone. I didn't want to call anybody, I didn't mind. I'm from the Northwest, we do weird stuff like sleep in our cars â€“ not a problem.\n\n\"If you haven't slept in your car, then you're weird\"\n\nLet's tag that quote #firstworldproblems.\n\nWebster, 25, spent his first five seasons in the NBA with the Portland Trail Blazers, who drafted him sixth overall out of high school in 2005. He then spent two seasons with the Minnesota Timberwovles before joining the Wizards' bench on a one-year contract for about $1.6 million.\n\nHe's made more than $26 million in his career and traveled across the country extensively. He's a veteran. But he's a human.\n\nAnd, hey, at least he didn't leave his wallet in El Segundo. We hear that can get messy."
