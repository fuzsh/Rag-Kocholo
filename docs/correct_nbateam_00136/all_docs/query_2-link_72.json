        "text": "You can’t start your pro career much better than that.\n\nAfter being selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the NBA Draft, Terrence Shannon Jr. is already showing his dominance in his first action with the team.\n\nShannon finished his Summer League debut with a game-high 25 points on 9-of-14 shooting in an 81-74 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. He also tacked on 3 rebounds, 2 blocks and 1 steal in 27 minutes of play.\n\nIn typical Shannon style, his first pro bucket was a dominant and-one poster slam. In the first quarter alone, Shannon had 8 points and a block on 2-of-2 shooting from the field and 3-of-3 from the line.\n\nHe finished the contest with four dunks and shot 6-of-8 from the charity stripe. Shannon flashed his explosive speed in transition and was the clear MVP of the game.\n\nWith the game airing on ESPN2, those who didn’t know Shannon already are now well aware of the 23-year-old rookie. Following an Elite Eight run with the Illini, he’s now looking to contribute to a Timberwolves team that is fresh off a Western Conference Finals appearance.\n\nJust a reminder, at 27th overall TSJ almost snuck his way into the second round. After just one game of action, he has already started making his case for steal of the 2024 NBA draft.\n\nShannon will look to continue his dominance this Sunday when Minnesota takes on the Indiana Pacers at 4:30 p.m. on NBATV."
