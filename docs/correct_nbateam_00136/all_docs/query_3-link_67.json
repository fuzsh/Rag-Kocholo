        "text": "Naval Air Warfare Center - Aircraft Division (NAWCAD)\n\nAir Test and Evaluation Squadron (UX) 24\n\nNAWCAD WOLF develops integrated and interoperable quality products for the warfighter in the areas of Command, Control Communications, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) systems; sensors; command/operation centers; intelligence management; and identification for the Navy, DOD, and other government agencies.\n\nWOLF is NAWCAD’s organic Lead Systems Integrator (oLSI) and rapid capability source.\n\nOur expertise in accelerated acquisitions, rapid response, and rapid prototyping means that we are able to respond to warfighter needs with unprecedented speed. We design, test, and field many innovative customer solutions in under two years’ time.\n\noLSI is a unique approach to delivering products to the warfighter.\n\nGovernment serves as the lead systems integrator as well as an organic product developer (no prime contractor).\n\nGovernment retains all rights.\n\nGovernment develops acquisition strategy and incentivizes contractor collaboration to achieve “best of breed.”\n\nIndustry partners are critical to success.\n\nThe benefits of oLSI include dramatic cost savings, significant schedule savings, improved program flexibility, and government-owned rights, documentation, processes, and facilities.\n\nWOLF has established itself as NAWCAD’s rapid capability engineering experts. Our rapid capability engineering practices are deeply embedded across our organization.\n\nAirborne Systems Integration—serves as oLSI for airborne systems. Rapidly develops, evaluates, demonstrates, integrates, fields, and transitions airborne systems and advanced technologies to meet warfighter needs.\n\nCombat Integration & Identifications Systems (CI&IDS)—designs, integrates, installs, and tests combat identification and datalink systems used throughout the Navy, Marine Corps, and other DoD Commands at shore stations, aboard submarines, surface combatants, and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to include Coast Guard vessels and foreign military sales combat ships.\n\nShip & Air Integrated Warfare (SAIW)—develops, integrates, and installs interoperable warfighting capabilities, including C41SR, combat systems, information systems, and mission systems onboard ships, both manned and unmanned aircraft, and at shore stations that enable the warfighter to fight and win.\n\nSpecial Communications Missions Solutions (SCMS)—develops and delivers C4ISR solutions to the warfighter in the areas of joint intelligence systems, crisis response and interoperability communication, mobile/deployable C4 integration, network engineering and operations centers, and executive leadership communications and platform applications. Most projects complete within 12-18 months.\n\nIntegrated C2 & Intelligence Systems (IC2&IS)—enables information superiority through exploitation and integration of cutting edge networking, communications, and electronics systems technologies to meet Defense, Intelligence, and Homeland Security missions.\n\nAir Traffic Control & Landing Systems (ATC&LS)—provides cradle-to-grave support for ATC&LS in military operational environments. Division has operated as the Center of Excellence for over 40 years. Act as the lead system integrator for ATC&LS on ACAT and non-ACAT ATC&LS programs while providing quick and agile prototyping solutions to respond to urgent needs requirements.\n\nOrganic Product Development—WOLF also provides rapid organic engineering and prototyping capabilities, including mechanical engineering design, development, fabrication, assembly, and testing of prototypes for mechanical, electrical, and RF systems. WOLF also conducts reverse-engineering and sustainment of ship and shore-based combat systems. Our facilities include an environmental laboratory, an antenna range, and an engineering & prototyping lab.\n\nWOLF’s Facilities:\n\nSituated on Webster Field, 850 acres strategically located 15 miles from Patuxent River Naval Air Station.\n\nTwo active runways.\n\nAn antenna range.\n\nA geographically littoral environment.\n\nIsolated and actively managed electromagnetic environment.\n\nA Navy Center of Excellence for Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS).\n\nHouses one of 3 DOD approved C-UAS test ranges, and the only Navy C-UAS test range."
