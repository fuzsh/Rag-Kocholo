        "text": "The Trail Blazers have traded Martell Webster to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Ryan Gomes and the draft rights to Luke Babbitt, a source told the The Oregonian.\n\nIn Babbitt, a sophomore from Nevada, the Blazers will fulfill their stated desire to add perimeter shooting. Babbitt averaged 21.9 points and 8.9 rebounds per game last season and shot 50 percent from the field — including 41.6 percent from three-point range.\n\nThe 6-foot-9 small forward, who has a 6-11 wingspan, also shot 91.7 percent from the free-throw line, which ranked third in the NCAA.\n\nIn Gomes, the Blazers will add a versatile veteran who has played with the Boston Celtics and Timberwolves in his five-year career. Gomes averaged 10.9 points and and 4.6 rebounds last season, while shooting 37.2 percent from three-point range.\n\nThe trade ends Webster's five-year run with the Blazers, who drafted him No. 6 overall in the 2005 draft. The small forward, who batted inconsistency throughout his career, averaged 9.4 points and 3.3 rebounds last season.\n\n–"
