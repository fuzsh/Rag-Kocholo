MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Timberwolves guard Martell Webster is out indefinitely while he recovers from back surgery.

The Timberwolves made the announcement on Friday, the day they held their media day and first practice of training camp. Webster had a microdiscectomy on Sept. 28

The Wolves say he is being evaluated by the team's medical staff, but would not provide a timeline for his return.

Webster was limited by back problems last year as well and played in only 46 games. He averaged 9.8 points and 3.2 rebounds after coming over in a trade with Portland on draft night.

The injury will open up more playing time at shooting guard for Wes Johnson and Wayne Ellington.
