The Timberwolves are pinching pennies and clearing space, presumably to try and make room for Nicolas Batum.

The team announced Friday it has waived forward Martell Webster while also completing a trade with the Hornets that sends Brad Miller and two second round picks in exchange for a conditional second round pick.

The Wolves received a protected 2017 selection while the Hornets received the Nets' 2013 second round pick and the Wolves 2016 second round selection.

Essentially this deal boils down like this: The Hornets bought two second round picks from Minnesota for $848,000 (the amount of guaranteed money owed to Miller following his retirement).

The Hornets are stockpiling assets while the Wolves are making all the room possible in a likely move to sign Batum to what's expected to be a four-year, $46.5 million offer sheet. Thursday the Wolves waived Darko Milicic via the amnesty provision.

Webster, 25, was on a non-guaranteed contract for this season. After being picked sixth overall by the Blazers in 2005, Webster has largely disappointed. He was traded to the Wolves from the Blazers in a draft night deal in 2010.

In 47 games with the Wolves last season he averaged 6.9 points and 3.6 rebounds per game. He's now an unrestricted free agent.
