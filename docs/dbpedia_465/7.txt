Well this version runs surprisingly well on OS X.

Darwin 124244241046.ctinets.com 12.4.0 Darwin Kernel Version 12.4.0: Wed May 1 17:57:12 PDT 2013; root:xnu-2050.24.15~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64), along with clang 421 (Apple clang version 4.0 (tags/Apple/clang-421.0.57) (based on LLVM 3.1svn)

I’m using glib-2.23.6, along with my older notes, which are somewhat PowerPC specific, but work fine on OS X. Â First remember to setup your environment for glib2

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH

I ran into some issue with picking up libiconv with gconvert.c . Â I just commented out the error message.

#if defined(USE_LIBICONV_GNU) && !defined (_LIBICONV_H)

#error GNU libiconv in use but included iconv.h not from libiconv

#endif

#if !defined(USE_LIBICONV_GNU) && defined (_LIBICONV_H)

//#error GNU libiconv not in use but included iconv.h is from libiconv

#endif

I also built it without GTK+ as building that looks simply overwhelming on OS X. Â I had to build the included pixman with –disable-gtk flags. Â In the configure script make it look like this:

#PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG

#if test $enable_gtk = auto ; then

# PKG_CHECK_EXISTS(gtk+-2.0, enable_gtk=yes, enable_gtk=no)

#fi

#if test $enable_gtk = yes ; then

# PKG_CHECK_MODULES(GTK, gtk+-2.0)

#fi

# if test “x$enable_gtk” = xyes; then

# HAVE_GTK_TRUE=

# HAVE_GTK_FALSE=’#’

#else

HAVE_GTK_TRUE=’#’

HAVE_GTK_FALSE=

#fi

Finally while the AdLib card is enabled by default now (yay) I kept on receiving the following error:

Assertion failed: (pio->offset >= off_last), function portio_list_add, file /usr/src/qemu-1.6.0-rc3/ioport.c, line 240.

So I just commented out the assert in ioport.c and I’ve been running Doom 1.1 for a few minutes without issue. Â I’ve also been able to install Windows NT 4.0 on Qemu
