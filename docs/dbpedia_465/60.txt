XNU kernel is part of the Darwin operating system for use in macOS and iOS operating systems. XNU is an acronym for X is Not Unix. XNU is a hybrid kernel combining the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University with components from FreeBSD and a C++ API for writing drivers called IOKit. XNU runs on x86_64 for both single processor and multi-processor configurations.

config - configurations for exported apis for supported architecture and platform

SETUP - Basic set of tools used for configuring the kernel, versioning and kextsymbol management.

EXTERNAL_HEADERS - Headers sourced from other projects to avoid dependency cycles when building. These headers should be regularly synced when source is updated.

libkern - C++ IOKit library code for handling of drivers and kexts.

libsa - kernel bootstrap code for startup

libsyscall - syscall library interface for userspace programs

libkdd - source for user library for parsing kernel data like kernel chunked data.

makedefs - top level rules and defines for kernel build.

osfmk - Mach kernel based subsystems

pexpert - Platform specific code like interrupt handling, atomics etc.

security - Mandatory Access Check policy interfaces and related implementation.

bsd - BSD subsystems code

tools - A set of utilities for testing, debugging and profiling kernel.

The xnu make system can build kernel based on KERNEL_CONFIGS & ARCH_CONFIGS variables as arguments. Here is the syntax:

Where:

<sdkroot>: path to macOS SDK on disk. (defaults to /)

<variant>: can be debug, development, release, profile and configures compilation flags and asserts throughout kernel code.

<arch> : can be valid arch to build for. (E.g. X86_64)

To build a kernel for the same architecture as running OS, just type

Additionally, there is support for configuring architectures through ARCH_CONFIGS and kernel configurations with KERNEL_CONFIGS.

Note:

By default, architecture is set to the build machine architecture, and the default kernel config is set to build for DEVELOPMENT.

This will also create a bootable image, kernel.[config], and a kernel binary with symbols, kernel.[config].unstripped.

To intall the kernel into a DSTROOT, use the install_kernels target:

Hint: For a more satisfying kernel debugging experience, with access to all local variables and arguments, but without all the extra check of the DEBUG kernel, add something like: CFLAGS_DEVELOPMENTARM64="-O0 -g -DKERNEL_STACK_MULTIPLIER=2" CXXFLAGS_DEVELOPMENTARM64="-O0 -g -DKERNEL_STACK_MULTIPLIER=2" to your make command. Replace DEVELOPMENT and ARM64 with the appropriate build and platform.

To build with RELEASE kernel configuration

make KERNEL_CONFIGS=RELEASE SDKROOT=/path/to/SDK

Define architectures in your environment or when running a make command.

$ make MAKEJOBS=-j8 # this will use 8 processes during the build. The default is 2x the number of active CPUS.

$ make -j8 # the standard command-line option is also accepted

$ make -w # trace recursive make invocations. Useful in combination with VERBOSE=YES

$ make BUILD_LTO=0 # build without LLVM Link Time Optimization

$ make REMOTEBUILD=user@remotehost # perform build on remote host

$ make BUILD_JSON_COMPILATION_DATABASE=1 # Build Clang JSON Compilation Database

The XNU build system can optionally output color-formatted build output. To enable this, you can either set the XNU_LOGCOLORS environment variable to y, or you can pass LOGCOLORS=y to the make command.

By default, a DWARF debug information repository is created during the install phase; this is a "bundle" named kernel.development.<variant>.dSYM To select the older STABS debug information format (where debug information is embedded in the kernel.development.unstripped image), set the BUILD_STABS environment variable.

To test the xnu kernel, you need to build a kernelcache that links the kexts and kernel together into a single bootable image. To build a kernelcache you can use the following mechanisms:

Using automatic kernelcache generation with kextd. The kextd daemon keeps watching for changing in /System/Library/Extensions directory. So you can setup new kernel as

$ cp BUILD/obj/DEVELOPMENT/X86_64/kernel.development /System/Library/Kernels/ $ touch /System/Library/Extensions $ ps -e | grep kextd

Manually invoking kextcache to build new kernelcache.

$ kextcache -q -z -a x86_64 -l -n -c /var/tmp/kernelcache.test -K /var/tmp/kernel.test /System/Library/Extensions

The development kernel and iBoot supports configuring boot arguments so that we can safely boot into test kernel and, if things go wrong, safely fall back to previously used kernelcache. Following are the steps to get such a setup:

Create kernel cache using the kextcache command as /kernelcache.test

Copy exiting boot configurations to alternate file

$ cp /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist /next_boot.plist

Update the kernelcache and boot-args for your setup

$ plutil -insert "Kernel Cache" -string "kernelcache.test" /next_boot.plist $ plutil -replace "Kernel Flags" -string "debug=0x144 -v kernelsuffix=test " /next_boot.plist

Copy the new config to /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/

$ cp /next_boot.plist /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/boot.plist

Bless the volume with new configs.

$ sudo -n bless --mount / --setBoot --nextonly --options "config=boot"

The --nextonly flag specifies that use the boot.plist configs only for one boot. So if the kernel panic's you can easily power reboot and recover back to original kernel.

Creating tags and cscope

Set up your build environment and from the top directory, run:

To install IOKit headers, see additional comments in iokit/IOKit/Makefile.

XNU installs header files at the following locations -

Kernel.framework is used by kernel extensions.

The System.framework and /usr/include are used by user level applications.

/System/DriverKit/usr/include is used by userspace drivers.

The header files in framework's PrivateHeaders are only available for ** Apple Internal Development **.

The directory containing the header file should have a Makefile that creates the list of files that should be installed at different locations. If you are adding the first header file in a directory, you will need to create Makefile similar to xnu/bsd/sys/Makefile.

Add your header file to the correct file list depending on where you want to install it. The default locations where the header files are installed from each file list are -

The Makefile combines the file lists mentioned above into different install lists which are used by build system to install the header files. There are two types of install lists: machine-dependent and machine-independent. These lists are indicated by the presence of MD and MI in the build setting, respectively. If your header is architecture-specific, then you should use a machine-dependent install list (e.g. INSTALL_MD_LIST). If your header should be installed for all architectures, then you should use a machine-independent install list (e.g. INSTALL_MI_LIST).

If the install list that you are interested does not exist, create it by adding the appropriate file lists. The default install lists, its member file lists and their default location are described below -

If you want to install the header file in a sub-directory of the paths described in (1), specify the directory name using two variables INSTALL_MI_DIR and EXPORT_MI_DIR as follows -

A single header file can exist at different locations using the steps mentioned above. However it might not be desirable to make all the code in the header file available at all the locations. For example, you want to export a function only to kernel level but not user level.

You can use C language's pre-processor directive (#ifdef, #endif, #ifndef) to control the text generated before a header file is installed. The kernel only includes the code if the conditional macro is TRUE and strips out code for FALSE conditions from the header file.

Some pre-defined macros and their descriptions are -

xnu offers the following mechanisms for conditionally compiling code:

It is recommended that you avoid compiling based on the target platform. xnu does not define the platform macros from TargetConditionals.h (TARGET_OS_OSX, TARGET_OS_IOS, etc.).

There is a deprecated TARGET_OS_EMBEDDED macro, but this should be avoided as it is in general too broad a definition for most functionality. Please refer to TargetConditionals.h for a full picture.

XNU kernel has multiple mechanisms for testing.

Assertions - The DEVELOPMENT and DEBUG kernel configs are compiled with assertions enabled. This allows developers to easily test invariants and conditions.

XNU Power On Self Tests (XNUPOST): The XNUPOST config allows for building the kernel with basic set of test functions that are run before first user space process is launched. Since XNU is hybrid between MACH and BSD, we have two locations where tests can be added.

xnu/osfmk/tests/ # For testing mach based kernel structures and apis. bsd/tests/ # For testing BSD interfaces.

Please follow the documentation at osfmk/tests/README.md

User level tests: The tools/tests/ directory holds all the tests that verify syscalls and other features of the xnu kernel. The make target xnu_tests can be used to build all the tests supported.

$ make RC_ProjectName=xnu_tests SDKROOT=/path/to/SDK

These tests are individual programs that can be run from Terminal and report tests status by means of std posix exit codes (0 -> success) and/or stdout. Please read detailed documentation in tools/tests/unit_tests/README.md

XNU uses different data formats for passing data in its api. The most standard way is using syscall arguments. But for complex data it often relies of sending memory saved by C structs. This packaged data transport mechanism is fragile and leads to broken interfaces between user space programs and kernel apis. libkdd directory holds user space library that can parse custom data provided by the same version of kernel. The kernel chunked data format is described in detail at libkdd/README.md.

The xnu kernel supports debugging with a remote kernel debugging protocol (kdp). Please refer documentation at [technical note] TN2063 By default the kernel is setup to reboot on a panic. To debug a live kernel, the kdp server is setup to listen for UDP connections over ethernet. For machines without ethernet port, this behavior can be altered with use of kernel boot-args. Following are some common options.

debug=0x144 - setups debug variables to start kdp debugserver on panic

-v - print kernel logs on screen. By default XNU only shows grey screen with boot art.

kdp_match_name=en1 - Override default port selection for kdp. Supported for ethernet, thunderbolt and serial debugging.

To debug a panic'ed kernel, use llvm debugger (lldb) along with unstripped symbol rich kernel binary.

And then you can connect to panic'ed machine with kdp_remote [ip addr] or gdb_remote [hostip : port] commands.

Each kernel is packaged with kernel specific debug scripts as part of the build process. For security reasons these special commands and scripts do not get loaded automatically when lldb is connected to machine. Please add the following setting to your ~/.lldbinit if you wish to always load these macros.
