These are implemented as C macros, and assume a standard C struct. As such, they are probably not suited for writing code in C++.\n\nThe basic types of lists and queues included are\n\nSLIST , a singly linked list\n\nSTAILQ , a singly linked tail queue\n\nLIST , a doubly linked list\n\nTAILQ , a doubly linked tail queue\n\nSLIST is ideal for creating stacks or for handling large sets of data with few or no removals. Arbitrary removal, however, requires an O(n) traversal of the list.\n\nSTAILQ is similar to SLIST except that it maintains pointers to both ends of the queue. This makes it ideal for simple FIFO queues by adding entries at the tail and fetching entries from the head. Like SLIST, it is inefficient to remove arbitrary elements.\n\nLIST is a doubly linked version of SLIST. The extra pointers require additional space, but allow O(1) (constant time) removal of arbitrary elements and bidirectional traversal.\n\nTAILQ is a doubly linked version of STAILQ. Like LIST, the extra pointers require additional space, but allow O(1) (constant time) removal of arbitrary elements and bidirectional traversal.\n\nBecause their functionality is relatively simple, their use is equally straightforward. These macros can be found in xnu/bsd/sys/queue.h.\n\n< Previous PageNext Page >\n\nLast updated: 2006-11-07\n\nDid this document help you?
