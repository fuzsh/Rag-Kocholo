        "text": "JamesBrickley said:\n\nApple made the switch from PowerPC to Intel due to Performance per Watt. The PowerPC was much more power hungry than Intel with no reduction in power usage being anticipated. The last Mac Pro model to ship with PowerPC had a liquid cooling system because it could not compete with Intel without overclocking and running hot enough to require liquid cooling. Intel outperformed the PowerPC CPUs and used a lot less power and even far less today. Apple was able to transition from PowerPC to Intel because Mac OS X came from NeXT whose OpenStep OS is the foundation of today's macOS Sierra and iOS devices. OpenStep always was cross platform across several workstation class RISC CPUs such as Alpha, SPARC, etc. as well as running on Intel. OpenStep even had a development environment on Windows called Yellow Box which was the same on all platforms and is an ancestor to Xcode. Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web on NeXT computers and John Carmack developed Doom on NeXT computers as well. OpenStep = mac OS High Sierra which is just an evolution of what was developed at NeXT. The operating system developed at NeXT is Apple's secret weapon. The OS was far ahead of it's time and is still relevant today. They ported to Intel so easily because since day one, it was running on Intel in secret. They removed the GUI and replaced it with a touch GUI for the iPad and iPhone but under the hood it's running the same UNIX kernel and many of the same API's on the iOS devices ARM CPUs.\n\nApple stripped down the ARM designs removing legacy features and optimizing for power efficiency. The new AppleTV 4k is running an A10X ARM CPU and they don't need to worry about power efficiency because it's plugged into AC power and not a battery. The new A11 Bionic CPU that powers the iPhone 8 and iPhone X has 6 CPU's. Two high-speed and four efficient processors plus a custom GPU and two more CPU's tied to the machine learning engine used with FaceID. Without the battery conservation it will give the latest MacBook Pro 13\" a run for it's money. Some benchmarks suggest it beats the MBP 13\" in several areas. That is a 10 nanometer chip design. TRSM is working on 3-5 nanometer scale chip fabrication by 2022 in Taiwan. The smaller the nanoscale the less power and greater the speed. So that means ARM can eventually supplant Intel in the Performance per Watt game. (yes, Intel is at 10 nanometer and they are pursuing 7 nanometer but will it be as power efficient and will the x64 architecture be as efficient as ARM designs?).\n\nSo yes, Apple could certainly switch to ARM CPU's for the Mac in the future. Imagine a Mac Pro with 64 CPUs or MacBook Pro's even thinner yet faster with longer battery life requiring less cooling. A super computer in your backpack? Yes, it is very possible in a few short years.\n\nIntel would need to make some radical new designs and who knows, maybe they can pull it off but right now, ARM is making some serious headway. Intel is kinda stuck with their x64 architecture due to reliance on customers to buy their CPUs. While Apple can custom design their ARM CPUs and make their operating systems run on whatever changes they make. That is a very strong advantage.\n\n1) There is no significant advantage between ARM and x86 as architectures. It's all engineering trade offs of implementation and focus area."
