        "text": "The Linux vs. Mac security debate keeps going, doesn’t it? Let’s be honest – both systems are secure. The Linux Foundation and Apple have built great reputations for making security a top priority in their operating systems. Both Linux and Mac have received increasingly advanced features over the years to maintain system integrity and stop unwanted access.\n\nWhile these two systems exhibit almost polar opposite design philosophies, it hasn’t stopped people from comparing their approaches to security. So, is one more secure than the other?\n\nWe’ll explore the various security features each system offers, looking at everything from the operating system and kernel, to system protection and permission access. We know you probably also have questions about functionality, coding performance, and GUI, so we’ll answer those too.\n\nWhat Is Linux?\n\nLinux is an open-source operating system based on the Unix kernel, which was first developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. It was originally developed for use on personal computers, but thanks to its open-source nature, Linux has grown in popularity and is now used across many devices. Android OS, for example, relies on Linux’s kernel for most of its functionalities.\n\nLinux is trusted for its stability, reliability, and security. It’s widely used for managing hardware resources, coding, and performing computing tasks. The OS’s advanced customization options let you adapt the operating system to suit your liking, which attracts a lot of developers and tech-savvy hobbyists.\n\nWhat Is Mac?\n\nA “Mac” is an Apple-designed computer or laptop using the macOS operating system. Apple first created macOS in 1984 exclusively for their line of Mackintosh computers, which we all know as Apple Macs. MacOS is based on the XNU kernel, which stands for “X is not Unix”. It’s derived from UNIX, making the Mac’s programming and software quite similar to Linux. If you were wondering why people like to compare the two operating systems so closely before, you might have a better idea now.\n\nMacOS has evolved considerably over the years – usually with an annual release boasting exciting new features. It’s well-known for its powerful hardware, strict security, attractive GUI, and intuitive built-in programs and apps.\n\nLinux vs. Mac Security Features Compared\n\nOperating System and Kernel\n\nAlthough both Linux and macOS are derived from the UNIX kernel, their operating systems are considerably different. Linux consists of open-source code, which means anyone can download the OS and modify all of it, without paying a fee. In contrast, macOS is a closed operating system, which means you can’t access the OS’s kernel code. You can only use the macOS proprietary operating system on Apple-owned Mackintosh devices, and most of its processes can’t be modified.\n\nMany people would assume Linux’s open-source code makes it less secure, but this isn’t necessarily the case. Linus Torvalds, along with his team of developers (also known as “maintainers”), monitor the OS and review feedback from volunteer developers across the world to identify potential vulnerabilities and security risks. They then use this information to develop new security patches and can apply them to the kernel on an almost immediate basis.\n\nLinux distributors like Canonical and Red Hat usually apply these updates and add their own patches to their distros’ various components. Since the system uses open-source code, you’re even free to build your own distribution and develop new security updates to your liking too. This level of flexibility isn’t something you get with a proprietary operating system.\n\nWith macOS, you’re relying on Apple to identify and patch vulnerabilities, which can take longer and further risk your security. This can make zero-day exploits a bigger threat, as criminals can target a loophole for as long as it takes Apple to fix it. That said, Apple’s closed-off system can reduce the risk of cybercriminals finding security flaws before the developers do. It also creates less opportunity for coding errors or conflicts stemming from a fragmented system like the Linux GNU has.\n\nmacOS offers some customization options with a kernel extension capability for Macs that have the Apple silicon chipset. While its source code remains hidden, developers can use third-party kernel extensions (kexts) to add instructions to the kernel. These let you develop applications with integrated access to functions like memory, networking, system sounds, and more. To avoid security vulnerabilities, Apple imposes strict rules for using kexts. They must be approved by a local system administrator and whitelisted first.\n\nThe company is phasing out kexts though, as it encourages developers to use System Extensions rather than kexts for macOS 10.51 or later to avoid potential security vulnerabilities. Third-party developers can still increase the functionality of the kernel, but apps run in the user space rather than at the kernel level. This reduces the impact on the kernel and overall function of the Mac if a kext has a bug or security loophole.\n\nSoftware and System Protection\n\nMacs come with tough security measures to protect your system from malware and risky downloads. XProtect is Apple’s built-in antimalware protection, which detects and blocks known threats before they can infect your device. It runs automatically in the background to scan software, including newly installed apps. Even trusted apps stay under scrutiny, as XProtect scans every app when it launches to ensure third parties didn’t make malicious changes to the software.\n\nMacOS also uses a feature called Gatekeeper, which stops you from downloading malware. Before you can download an app, it confirms the software is Apple-approved and scans for possible malicious code. The OS uses an access management tool called MAC to gatekeep your access to its system too, by preventing unauthorized changes to system files and processes.\n\nNow, what about Linux? Like Mac, Linux has many built-in security features to protect your device, including AppArmor and SELinux. AppArmor is a security module that essentially locks down your device, protecting the kernel by limiting programs’s access permissions to specific resources only. This stops potential vulnerabilities from spreading further throughout the kernel and damaging the hardware.\n\nSELinux minimizes unauthorized access to your system by limiting access controls. It was originally developed by the USA NSA as a way of giving administrators greater control over who has access to a system and what people can do within that system.\n\nAlongside that, Linux’s kernel has built-in self-protection to identify and minimize the impact of security issues in the kernel without any additional work from you. This includes measures to protect memory integrity, prevent information leaks, and limit how far an attack can spread.\n\nThird-Party Security Support\n\nBoth operating systems support third-party security applications, like VPNs and antivirus tools. Apple is much stricter on which applications you can download, though. Any app on the App Store must be verified by Apple before you can download it, preventing you from installing ones hiding malware (in theory). This is ideal for your security, but it can limit the availability of apps as everything must be pre-approved by the company.\n\nLinux is less strict about which apps you can use, letting you choose from a huge range of third-party programs. While this freedom and flexibility gives you the power to manage your system’s security, it comes at a cost. You can easily put your device at risk by accidentally downloading malicious software or poorly maintained apps that introduce new flaws to the system.\n\nPermissions and System Access\n\nLinux heavily restricts root access, which helps to keep your operating system safe from unauthorized use. All Linux systems require that you assign a dedicated superuser, who’s in charge of distributing and managing access permissions for other users. This means they can’t make changes to the kernel, access certain files, or even open attachments without the superuser’s consent. You can easily check and manage file permissions via the GUI and command line.\n\nMacOS doesn’t let you manage user privileges as intensely as Linux, but has features that let you prevent unauthorized access to your file storage. This includes FileVault, which encrypts all data at rest and requires login details to access the encrypted information. If someone removes your hard drive and connects it to another computer, they won’t be able to open any files without valid login details.\n\nSecurity Updates\n\nLinux usually issues frequent security updates to patch any vulnerabilities, though patch adoption varies between distributions. With some distros, you can expect updates as frequently as every 1–2 weeks. You can choose whether or not to apply these updates, but they’re highly recommended to keep your system secure and prevent unauthorized access or malware. New kernel versions are also released often, though not on a set schedule. The open-source code makes it possible to identify and patch vulnerabilities quickly, with the Linux Foundation, volunteer developers, and distributors monitoring the code for potential loopholes.\n\nmacOS typically gets one big update annually instead of lots of small updates throughout the year. The only exception is when Apple identifies an exploit or bug that has to be patched quickly. Since the source code is proprietary, only the company can identify and patch vulnerabilities. It’s not always clear what issues exist or how long Apple took to identify them.\n\nLinux vs. Mac: Known Security Vulnerabilities\n\nAlthough Linux and Mac both offer secure hardware, that doesn’t mean either is immune to vulnerabilities or threats.\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, Mac made headlines when CISA highlighted a serious security flaw affecting its kernel. It was a known bug that let hackers bypass pointer authentication to gain access to a Mac’s systems. CISA warned that cybercriminals had identified the flaw and were actively abusing it. Turns out, Apple had already released patches to fix the flaw back in 2022, but only notified the public of the issue after this news broke two years later.\n\nIn 2023, Apple also fixed another Mac-related vulnerability that could let attackers bypass Mac’s system integrity protection and gain root access to the OS. This could give cybercriminals the ability to perform arbitrary operations, install malicious files and hide them from monitoring software, attack the system kernel, and compromise the overall system integrity. Apple patched the flaw, known as “Migraine,” but it’s unclear whether anyone managed to exploit it before the update.\n\nLinux has also experienced its fair share of security flaws. In 2023, Qualys Threat Research Unit discovered a flaw named “Looney Tunables” affecting the security of almost all Linux systems. Similar to Apple’s Migraine bug, Looney Tunables could give malicious outsiders root access to the system through the GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable in the GNU C Library (or glibc for short).\n\nGlibc is a common tool among system developers and administrators across many Linux distributions, which meant a significant number of users were affected. Thankfully, most Linux distros were quick to patch the issue.\n\nA separate buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered within the Netfilter subsystem of the Linux Kernel in 2023. This would give attackers root access to the system using VLAN headers to trigger a buffer overflow. Linux also quickly released a patch to fix this vulnerability.\n\nUnlike Apple, which solely manages macOS updates, Linux distributors are responsible for fixing flaws and users have to install new updates themselves. This could leave you exposed to security vulnerabilities for longer than necessary, especially if some distros don’t patch vulnerabilities once they’re identified. That said, Linux is well known for its frequent security updates. Apple, meanwhile, is somewhat secretive about its own update process, which could raise questions about the integrity of your system.\n\nLinux vs. Mac Functionality and Compatibility\n\nHardware Compatibility\n\nLinux’s open-source code means you’re free to download the code and configure it to almost any hardware, offering greater flexibility and freedom of options. You can also choose from several pre-set Linux distributions, or amend the code to build your own. Community distros are free to use or you can pay for an enterprise Linux distribution (though these are more suited to business than personal use).\n\nThe same can’t be said for macOS. macOS is only compatible with Apple’s hardware, which means you have to pay the expense of an Apple device to use it. You can’t download the code or easily configure it to any other hardware. While attempts at a modified version of the OS (dubbed “Hackintosh”) exist, these versions are illegal and require specific PC hardware components. Even then, it’s unstable, with many missing features that won’t work on non-Apple hardware.\n\nCustomization and GUI\n\nLinux’s GUI is highly customizable, letting you change the desktop environment to suit your preferences. You can choose from several premade desktop environments such as GNOME, KDE Plasma, and Deepin, or install your own. You have the flexibility to change system settings, install new software, and alter the overall look, feel, and functionality of the interface however you like.\n\nmacOS users are confined to the pre-set Mac desktop environment. You can change colors, choose dark or light mode, and set new screensavers, but that’s about it. You can’t install additional desktop managers to change how you use your Mac or how the system looks or functions. The OS only lets you install pre-approved apps from the App Store.\n\nAlthough Linux’s customizability is attractive, it also creates room for error since you’re free to amend the hardware to your liking. This can break important security features or create new vulnerabilities that risk the security of your system. With Mac, this is less of an issue because it has tight controls over the desktop environment and what you can do with it. That’s not to say you can’t put your Mac at risk, or that the system is 100% secure, but it significantly reduces the chance you’ll make mistakes that introduce new vulnerabilities.\n\nCLI and Scripting\n\nBoth Linux and macOS rely on the Unix-based operating system, even if macOS likes to call it XNU. This means both have a command-line interface system that allows you to communicate with the system and run complex activities. With both macOS and Linux, you can quickly automate tasks and create custom scripts. You can also use the CLI terminal to create complex workflows.\n\nAlthough similar, Linux gives you much greater control over the system and overall desktop environment. It gives you unrestricted access to open-source tools, a huge online developer community, and various programming libraries. But macOS is better at rendering different font weights and is often considered more efficient with a seamless and easy-to-navigate user interface. It’s also compatible with some of the most popular development software.\n\nGaming\n\nLinux isn’t known for providing much gaming support. The number of games on Linux is growing thanks to the Steam store, but it has fewer games than macOS and other operating systems, such as Windows. Gamers generally prefer macOS over Linux for its wider choice of games and gaming stability, especially because macOS games often include integration with other Apple hardware, like iOS and iPad. This means you can run games across multiple devices too, which is an attractive feature for many people.\n\nLinux vs. Mac: What’s the Verdict?\n\nIt’s hard to say whether one system keeps you more secure than the other since they take very different approaches. Linux’s transparency and customizability gives it a serious edge, but really, it comes down to your technical skill level and personal preferences.\n\nYou could build a more secure Linux setup compared to macOS if you’re tech savvy and can adequately manage the security of your system. Otherwise, the ability to change the system could expose you to additional vulnerabilities and security flaws. This is something Mac users don’t have to worry about – while Apple gives you less control over your system, it manages your security almost entirely for you.\n\nLinux also receives far more security updates than macOS, with its pool of distributors around the globe. MacOS is limited to what Apple identifies and applies to patch updates.\n\nFeatures and functionality are important too. Linux’s customizability and freedom to create your desktop environment are hard to compete with. Then again, Mac’s seamless user experience and compatibility with the most popular development programs make it a strong choice, especially for coding. Whichever operating system you choose, you can use PIA VPN to encrypt your connection and stop unwanted snoopers from stealing your information or gaining unauthorized access to your device."
