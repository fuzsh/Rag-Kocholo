        "text": "2nd part Kernels.\n\nUnix.\n\nUnix is an OS which is created at Bell Labs (AT&T) in the early 1970s by Ken Thompson. at first, it was called UNICS.\n\nLater after some versions, this was used by some universities. University of California at Berkeley releases the Berkeley version of Unix.\n\nBerkeley Software Distribution(BSD). There are some new features with the BSD version of Unix. Virtual Memory model, BSD sockets (think TCP/IP), vi editor, CSH (the first shell designed for interactive use).\n\nAT&T and BSD code bases were pulled into “Official UNIX” and these were released in UNIX system V release 4 (SVR4). This was a successful one at that time. Bourne shell was used with Unix version 7.\n\nUNIX kernel used for SunOS, Solaris, HP/UX, etc.\n\nLinux\n\nLinux is a kernel written by Linus Torvalds in 1991.it is like a clone of Unix.\n\nbut all written from scratch.\n\nIn 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU (GNU is not Unix)project to create a Unix-like OS. Also by the early 1990s, he wrote a GNU General Public License (GPL).\n\nLinus used this for Linux OS to make it open source.\n\nin 1996 Linus intrudes on The Tux (a penguin) official mascot of Linux.\n\nbash (Bourne again shell) This was used in Linux as a free enhanced version shell.\n\nThis is a picture of the evaluation of kernels.\n\nSo, basically, Linux is just a kernel. it is maintained by Linux Foundation.\n\nLinux kernel is the most distributed kernel on earth.\n\nothers can use this kernel to make operating systems.\n\nFor more info about kernel types click here.\n\n3rd part OS\n\nLinux Operating Systems.\n\nThere are lots of Linux-based distributions. They are all based on the Linux kernel. Ubuntu, Redhat Kali, etc.\n\nbash is the default shell and there are lots of customs shells also.\n\nLinux has terminal programs to use with shells. that we can use for scripting and other tasks.\n\n2. Mac OS\n\nMac OS is using XNU kernel which is developed by Apple in 1996.\n\nit is based on the Unix kernel.\n\nmac os has bash and Zsh shells. defualt shell is Zsh.\n\n3. Windows OS\n\nWindows has its own kernel Windows NT(new technology).\n\nIt has Powershell as a shell.\n\nwindows also have a Command shell which was used in early windows os.\n\nCommand prompt is the command line interpreter program that we can use with the command shell.\n\nFor more info:\n\nUnix Vs Linux: What is the Difference Between UNIX and Linux (softwaretestinghelp.com)"
