It previously existed as an independent open-source operating system, first released by Apple Inc. in 2000. It is composed of code derived from NeXTSTEP, FreeBSD,[3] other BSD operating systems,[6] Mach, and other free software projects' code, as well as code developed by Apple.\n\nDarwin is mostly POSIX-compatible, but has never, by itself, been certified as compatible with any version of POSIX. Starting with Leopard, macOS has been certified as compatible with the Single UNIX Specification version 3 (SUSv3).[7][8][9]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe heritage of Darwin began with Unix derivatives supplemented by aspects of NeXT's NeXTSTEP operating system (later, since version 4.0, known as OPENSTEP), first released in 1989. After Apple bought NeXT in 1996, it announced it would base its next operating system on OPENSTEP. This was developed into Rhapsody in 1997, Mac OS X Server 1.0 in 1999, Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000, and Mac OS X 10.0 in 2001.\n\nIn 1999, Apple announced it would release the source code for the Mach 2.5 microkernel, BSD Unix 4.4 OS, and the Apache Web server components of Mac OS X Server.[10] At the time, interim CEO Steve Jobs alluded to British naturalist Charles Darwin by announcing \"because it's about evolution\".[11] In 2000, the core operating system components of Mac OS X were released as open-source software under the Apple Public Source License (APSL) as Darwin; the higher-level components, such as the Cocoa and Carbon frameworks, remained closed-source.\n\nUp to Darwin 8.0.1, released in April 2005, Apple released a binary installer (as an ISO image) after each major Mac OS X release that allowed one to install Darwin on PowerPC and Intel x86 systems as a standalone operating system.[12] Minor updates were released as packages that were installed separately. Darwin is now only available as source code. As of January 2023, Apple no longer mentions Darwin by name on its Open Source website and only publishes an incomplete collection of open-source projects relating to macOS and iOS.\n\nDesign\n\n[edit]\n\nKernel\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: XNU and Mach (kernel)\n\nThe kernel of Darwin is XNU, a hybrid kernel which uses OSFMK 7.3[13] (Open Software Foundation Mach Kernel) from the OSF, various elements of FreeBSD (including the process model, network stack, and virtual file system),[14] and an object-oriented device driver API called I/O Kit.[15] The hybrid kernel design provides the flexibility of a microkernel[16][failed verification – see discussion] and the performance of a monolithic kernel.[17]\n\nHardware and software support\n\n[edit]\n\nThe last bootable full release of Darwin supported 32-bit and 64-bit Apple PowerPC systems and 32-bit Intel PCs.[18]\n\nDarwin currently includes support for the 64-bit x86-64 variant of the Intel x86 processors used in Intel-based Macs and the 64-bit ARM processors used in the iPhone 5S and later, the 6th generation iPod Touch, the 5th generation iPad and later, the iPad Air family, the iPad Mini 2 and later, the iPad Pro family, the fourth generation and later Apple TVs, the HomePod family, and Macs with Apple silicon such as the 2020 Apple M1 Macs, as well as the Raspberry Pi 3B.[19][20] An open-source port of the XNU kernel exists that supports Darwin on Intel and AMD x86 platforms not officially supported by Apple, though it does not appear to have been updated since 2009.[21] An open-source port of the XNU kernel also exists for ARM platforms, though it has not been updated since 2016.[22] Older versions supported some or all of 32-bit PowerPC, 64-bit PowerPC, 32-bit x86, and 32-bit ARM.\n\nIt supports the POSIX API by way of its BSD lineage (largely FreeBSD userland), so a large number of programs written for various other UNIX-like systems can be compiled on Darwin with no changes to the source code.\n\nDarwin does not include many of the defining elements of macOS, such as the Carbon and Cocoa APIs or the Quartz Compositor and Aqua user interface, and thus cannot run Mac applications. It does, however, support a number of lesser-known features of macOS, such as mDNSResponder, which is the multicast DNS responder and a core component of the Bonjour networking technology, and launchd, an advanced service management framework.\n\nLicense\n\n[edit]\n\nIn July 2003, Apple released Darwin under version 2.0 of the Apple Public Source License (APSL), which the Free Software Foundation (FSF) classifies as a free software license incompatible with the GNU General Public License.[23] Previous versions were released under an earlier version of the APSL license, which did not meet the FSF definition of free software, although it did meet the requirements of the Open Source Definition.[24]\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following is a table of major Darwin releases with their dates of release and their derivative operating system releases.[25] Note that the corresponding releases may have been released on a different date.\n\nDarwin 0–8 and corresponding Mac OS X releases\n\n[edit]\n\nVersion Date Corresponding releases Notes 0.1 March 16, 1999 Mac OS X Server 1.0 releases\n\nInitial release\n\n0.1 is contrived (for sorting and identification) as this identified itself simply as Rhapsody 5.3\n\n0.2 April 14, 1999 Mac OS X Server 1.0.1 0.3 August 5, 1999 Based on Rhapsody 5.5\n\nISO image is available on archive.org\n\nAfter this point the kernel changed from the NeXTSTEP/OPENSTEP/Rhapsody to the newer XNU for Mac OS X\n\n1.0 April 12, 2000 Developer preview 3\n\nISO image is available on archive.org\n\n1.1 April 5, 2000 Developer preview 4 1.2.1 November 15, 2000 Mac OS X Public Beta (code-named \"Kodiak\") 1.3.1 April 13, 2001 Mac OS X v10.0 (code-named \"Cheetah\")\n\nFirst commercial release of Darwin\n\nAll releases of Cheetah (v10.0.0–4) had the same version of Darwin.\n\n1.4.1 October 2, 2001 Mac OS X v10.1 (code-named \"Puma\")\n\nPerformance improvements to \"boot time, real-time threads, thread management, cache flushing, and preemption handling\"\n\nSupport for SMB network file system\n\nWget replaced with cURL.[26]\n\n5.1 November 12, 2001 Mac OS X v10.1.1\n\nChange in numbering scheme to match the Mac OS X build numbering scheme\n\n5.5 June 5, 2002 Mac OS X v10.1.5 6.0.1 September 23, 2002 Mac OS X v10.2 (code-named \"Jaguar\")\n\nGCC upgraded from 2 to 3.1\n\nIPv6 and IPSec support\n\nmDNSResponder service discovery daemon (Rendezvous)\n\nAddition of CUPS, Ruby, and Python\n\nJournaling support in HFS+ (Darwin 6.2)\n\nApplication profiles (\"pre-heat files\") for faster program launching.[27]\n\n6.8 October 3, 2003 Mac OS X v10.2.8 7.0 October 24, 2003 Mac OS X Panther Mac OS X v10.3.0\n\nBSD layer synchronized with FreeBSD 5\n\nAutomatic file defragmentation, hot-file clustering and optional case sensitivity in HFS+\n\nBash instead of tcsh as default shell\n\nRead-only NTFS support (Darwin 7.9)[28]\n\n7.9 April 15, 2005 Mac OS X v10.3.9 8.0 April 29, 2005\n\nMac OS X Tiger\n\nMac OS X for Apple TV\n\nMac OS X v10.4.0\n\nDownload for Darwin 8.0.1 can be found here\n\nMac OS X for Apple TV in Darwin 8.8.2\n\nStable kernel programming interface, finer-grained kernel locking, 64-bit BSD layer\n\nlaunchd service management framework\n\nExtended file attributes, access control lists\n\nCommands such as cp and mv updated to preserve extended attributes and resource forks[29]\n\n8.11 November 14, 2007 Mac OS X v10.4.11\n\nThe jump in version numbers from Darwin 1.4.1 to 5.1 with the release of Mac OS X v10.1.1 was designed to tie Darwin to the Mac OS X version and build numbering system, which in turn is inherited from NeXTSTEP. In the build numbering system of macOS, every version has a unique beginning build number, which identifies what whole version of macOS it is part of. Mac OS X v10.0 had build numbers starting with 4, 10.1 had build numbers starting with 5, and so forth (earlier build numbers represented developer releases).[30]\n\nDarwin 9; iPhone OS introduced\n\n[edit]\n\nVersion Date Corresponding releases Notes 9.0 October 26, 2007 Mac OS X v10.5.0\n\niPhone OS 1 support in Darwin 9.0.0d1\n\nFull POSIX compliance, improved hierarchical process scheduling model, dynamically allocated swap files, dynamic resource limits (for files and processes), process sandboxing, address space layout randomization, DTrace tracing framework, file system events daemon, directory hard links\n\nApache 1.3 and PHP 4 updated to Apache 2.2 and PHP 5, read-only ZFS support.[31]\n\nFirst Darwin core used for iPhone devices.\n\n9.8 August 5, 2009 Mac OS X v.10.5.8\n\nDarwin 10-11; iPhone OS rebranded to iOS\n\n[edit]\n\nVersion Date Corresponding releases Notes 10.0 August 28, 2009 Mac OS X v10.6.0\n\nEnd of official support for PPC architecture (although several fat binaries, such as Kernel, still contain PPC images)\n\n64-bit kernel and drivers\n\nlibdispatch task parallelization framework\n\nOpenCL heterogeneous computing framework\n\nInitial support for Automatic Reference Counting\n\nSupport for blocks in C\n\nTransparent file compression in HFS+.[32]\n\n10.8 June 23, 2011 Mac OS X v10.6.8 11.0.0 July 20, 2011 Mac OS X v10.7.0\n\nXNU no longer supports PPC binaries (fat binary only for i386, x86_64).\n\nXNU requires an x86_64 processor, except for iOS which is ARM based.\n\nImproved sandboxing of applications\n\nComplete support for Automatic Reference Counting\n\n11.4.2 October 4, 2012 Mac OS X v10.7.5 (supplemental)\n\nDarwin 12–15; Mac OS X rebranded into OS X\n\n[edit]\n\nVersion Date Corresponding releases Notes 12.0.0 February 16, 2012 OS X Mountain Lion OS X v10.8.0\n\nMac OS X was rebranded into OS X.\n\nObjective-C garbage collection was deprecated in favor of Automatic Reference Counting\n\n12.6.0 January 27, 2015 OS X v10.8.5 (with Security Update 2015-001) 13.0.0 June 11, 2013 OS X v10.9.0\n\nVirtual memory compression\n\nTimer coalescing\n\nOpenGL 4.1 and OpenCL 1.2\n\nServer Message Block version 2 (SMB2) is now the default protocol for sharing files instead of AFP.

Build dates for Darwin versions are not publicly available; the commands below only give the build date for the XNU kernel.\n\nThe command uname -r in Terminal will show the Darwin version number (\"20.3.0\"), and the command uname -v will show the XNU build version string, which includes the Darwin version number. The command sw_vers will show the corresponding ProductName (\"macOS\"), the ProductVersion number (\"11.2.3\") and the BuildVersion string (\"20D91\").\n\nDerived projects\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to the free software nature of Darwin, there have been projects that aim to modify or enhance the operating system.\n\nOpenDarwin\n\n[edit]\n\nOpenDarwin was a community-led operating system based on the Darwin system. It was founded in April 2002 by Apple Inc. and Internet Systems Consortium. Its goal was to increase collaboration between Apple developers and the free software community. Apple benefited from the project because improvements to OpenDarwin would be incorporated into Darwin releases; and the free/\"open\"-source community benefited from being given complete control over its own operating system, which could then be used in free software distributions such as GNU-Darwin.[38]\n\nOn July 25, 2006, the OpenDarwin team announced that the project was shutting down, as they felt OpenDarwin had \"become a mere hosting facility for Mac OS X related projects\", and that the efforts to create a standalone Darwin operating system had failed.[39] They also state: \"Availability of sources, interaction with Apple representatives, difficulty building and tracking sources, and a lack of interest from the community have all contributed to this.\"[40] The last stable release was version 7.2.1, released on July 16, 2004.[41]\n\nPureDarwin\n\n[edit]\n\nPureDarwin is a project to create a bootable operating system image from Apple's released source code for Darwin.[42] Since the halt of OpenDarwin and the release of bootable images since Darwin 8.x, it has been increasingly difficult to create a full operating system as many components became closed source. In 2015 the project created a preview release based on Darwin 9 with an X11 GUI,[43] followed by a command-line only 17.4 Beta based on Darwin 17.[44]\n\nOther derived projects\n\n[edit]\n\nXQuartz is a component of the X Window System that runs on macOS (Darwin). XDarwin, before the introduction of Apple's X11.app.\n\nGNUstep is a free software implementation of the Cocoa (formerly OpenStep) Objective-C frameworks, widget toolkit, and application development tools for Unix-like operating systems.\n\nWindow Maker, a window manager designed to emulate the NeXT GUI as part of the wider GNUstep project.\n\nWebKit is a browser engine primarily used in Apple's Safari web browser, as well as all web browsers on iOS and iPadOS.\n\nMacPorts (formerly DarwinPorts), Fink, and Homebrew are projects to port UNIX programs to the Darwin operating system and provide package management. In addition, several standard UNIX package managers—such as RPM, pkgsrc, and Portage—have Darwin ports. Some of these operate in their own namespace so as not to interfere with the base system.\n\nGNU-Darwin was a project that ports packages of free software to Darwin.
