        "text": "It helps to remember that Quartz is Apple's answer to the (very) expensive Display Postscript rendering engine by Adobe. When NeXT and Sun made their application environment specifications (OpenStep) open source a new project was formed by the open source community call GNUstep (a window manager/application environment for unix and unix-like operating systems). Being an open source project, they also needed a way around Adobe's Display Postscript. The solution they are working on is call Display Ghostscript, but I'm really not sure just how far they have gotten with it. Everyone on the project does this in their spare time.\n\nAlso Aqua and Quartz are not open source. These are proprietary technologies owned by Apple. The only people who would be working on a port would be them, and they wouldn't let people on the outside know about it (or have access to it).\n\nOne idea that was floated around for a while was replacing Mach OS in Rhapsody 5.1 with Darwin, but as it turns out Darwin is to different for this to work correctly (and generally there would be little noticeable improvement even if it did work).\n\nIf you are looking for a theme Im quite sure that some one has made an Aqua theme to run in WindowMaker or the like. I havent been following the themes for quite some time so Ill leave that to some one else to answer and provide more information.\n\nOne idea that was floated around for a while was replacing Mach OS in Rhapsody 5.1 with Darwin, but as it turns out Darwin is to different for this to work correctly (and generally there would be little noticeable improvement even if it did work).\n\nDarwin comprises of Mach 3.0 (I beleive). Mach is not an OS, its a Kernel. Mach is FreeBSD's kernel, Darwin is FreeBSD's kernel with a few Apple/Mac specific features... thats all...\n\nThere is however a project that is working to make a functional OS with a darwin foundation.\n\nThe KDE theme \"Liquid\" is about the closest you will get to a Mac OS X look and feel for that however...\n\nOriginally posted by UtaTr3y\n\nMach is not an OS, its a Kernel. Mach is FreeBSD's kernel, Darwin is FreeBSD's kernel with a few Apple/Mac specific features... thats all...\n\nInteresting, you should take the time to tell it's creators that.\n\nFrom the CMU Mach home page:\n\nProject Mach was an operating systems research project of the Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science from 1985 to 1994.\n\nSo is Darwin not an operating system? Apple seems to think so. And Apple also seems to think that Darwin as an OS can run some major apps (like Apache and Apples own Quicktime Streaming Server). What is an operating system to you then?\n\nMach was designed and developed to stand on it's own. NeXT licensed 4.3BSD for use as an interface layer and application environment and developed their own application environment and window management system (using Adobe's technology for rendering images on the screen) all to run on top of the Mach OS and called there creation NeXTSTEP (years before anyone had even thought of FreeBSD). This moduler design is why OpenStep could be moved from Mach to Solaris and even Windows. OpenStep for Solaris looked almost exactly the same as OPENSTEP for Mach (of course Sun is also using Display Postscript, which helped).\n\nI didnt know about \"Liquid\", so thank you for that information."
