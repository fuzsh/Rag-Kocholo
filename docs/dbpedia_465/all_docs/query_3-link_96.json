        "text": "President Barack Obama, in his address to the American public on 4 December 2013 described economic inequality as the “defining challenge of our time”. At the time of writing (June 2016), the general public is increasingly being reminded (through the media) of the symptoms of growing inequality. These include rising relative poverty and excessive bonus payments to top executives that, since in many cases the payments are not commensurate with company performance, are not justifiable. Changes to legislation in the United Kingdom have empowered investors to take action on executive pay, which in April 2016 led to executive pay being challenged by the investors of Weir group (72% of shareholders rejected a proposed pay scheme) and BP (59% of shareholders voted against a pay rise for the CEO). This paper describes a system which would fall into the class of “predistribution” (coined by Jacob Hacker), as it relates to economic inequality, and should assist governments worldwide to produce a more equal distribution of employment income and fulfil the public’s expectations in terms of reducing inequality. It would further empower investors by allowing them to manage their risk by voting in favour of a standardized and more equal pay regime at an early stage, rather than them having to monitor and periodically approve the pay of top executives. The system is based on a remuneration ratio that reflects the shape of an income curve that can be used to evaluate whether income distribution of individual businesses meets a government-defined benchmark. This paper demonstrates how the system would operate, which starts with modelling of employment income distribution for small, medium and large businesses in the United Kingdom. A case study of the system’s implementation is included, covering small, medium and large business in the UK. The potential impact of all UK businesses conforming to a ratio value as appropriate for the size of the business is reviewed in terms of changes to income inequality and UK government net tax receipts. The probability of a business conforming to a specified ratio value assumes that the owners and shareholders of businesses would voluntarily opt in if tax incentives offered for conforming are attractive. A tax incentive plan to propel voluntary conformity in the UK is proposed and the effect on business productivity and investment financial ratios is confirmed, in theory, to be positive."
