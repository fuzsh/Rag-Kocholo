        "text": "When you use to be an iOS user you will try to take a look how it work and how it realize the iOS world in your iPhone and iPad.\n\nThis is the year with open source idea to share knowledge to understand what is inside.\n\nWindows and Linux\n\nBeside the Windows System, FreeBSD and Linux become the main operating system which influence your life. During these years experience in IT industry, I use Windows System in my Laptop and use Linux for the server system when I focused on server related tasks. Windows is the system with retail customers and some main applications work on this operating system for user. Linux based system is a good system which could provide more system resource when you want to use some server or remote control services.\n\nFreeBSD\n\nIt is a system use to be understand as a useful system in educational system. Some specific tasks work on this system and continues more than a decade.\n\nDarwin XNU\n\nWhen first time you download the code from GitHub, you would find the code structure based on BSD and other Unix, Linux based systems than add some Darwin specific ideas to redefine this operation system. During the information inside the source code, I admit that I should said it as XNU but some Linux or Unix base operating system. Because it already has its own code base and some structure base on its own. Like NeXTStep, Solaris and also contain with Linux and BSD, etc.\n\nInnovation and Ideas\n\nMore things review inside, more surprising things happen during these code base and ideas.When you are a firmware or BIOS engineer, it is more easily to let you understand the low level code base like the kernel code. In another way, it would take long time to understand application code because its far from the low level code base idea inside the system. Different work environment cause different innovation and idea during the project requirement. Different Level with the code base would also include different topology and algorithm to create the code base and the structure the data and the things that we used to be.\n\nObjective-C\n\nIt is the Programming Language that make the world has different idea about the system which provide different idea about the user and the system. Specifically when you are a PC environment engineer and live in the MS and go through the coding environment with C, C# and assembly. It provide more detail control idea and method with resource and provide how to control these resource with some feature include inside. These kind of coding style would help to manage the code in some resource limit devices and component.\n\nWilson"
