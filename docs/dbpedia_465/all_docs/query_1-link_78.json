        "text": "Darwin/XNU\n\nIt turned out to be unreasonably hard to bootstrap a VM image usable for fuzzing from the XNU source drops without using any of the proprietary kernel extensions shipped with macOS. This guide is therefore based on a normal macOS installation. Unfortunately Apples macOS EULA makes this unsuitable for fuzzing XNU on Google Cloud Platform.\n\nPrepare a macOS installation disk image\n\nNowadays Apple mainly distributes macOS updates via the Mac App Store. This will however only give us the latest builds. Luckily the Munki people are kind enough to maintain a script, allowing us to fetch a macOS build of our choice from the shell.\n\nWe‘ll need a macOS build that has a kernel version close to the one we will be building. You can see Apples most recent source drops on this page. At the time of writing the most recent version is macOS 11.5 containing kernel xnu-7195.141.2. The Munki download script can only tell the macOS version and build number, but not the XNU version. Unfortunately you might occasionally download a matching macOS release, but the kernel you build won’t boot anyway. Among many other reasons this can be caused by this mismatch in kernel and bootloader versions. Some trial and error can be involved in getting the correct build. Sometimes the correct build might no longer be available. At the time of writing 11.5 build 20G71 was available and worked with the 11.5 xnu source drop.\n\nIn the instructions below I will assume you have VMware Fusion installed on your host macOS for creating the VM disk image. This is for convenience sake as Fusion allows us to simply drag and drop in the macOS installer App we downloaded. If you want to use another tool like Qemu for this, take note of Apples own process for creating a bootable install media. I had trouble generating bootable ISOs from certain macOS builds using Apples method, hence I just always let Fusion create the installation medium for me.\n\nAdditionally the below instructions ask you to disable System Integrity Protection and Authenticated Root inside the VM. We need to do this in order to run the DIY kernel we will build in a bit. Executive Summary on these features:\n\nIn OS X 10.11 Apple introduced System Integrity Protection, a feature that (among other things) limits even root from writing to certain critical system directories during normal operations. We need to disable it to write our kernel to disk\n\nIn macOS 11 Apple introduced Authenticated Root. Starting with this version only a cryptographically signed read only snapshot of the root filesystem is mounted during boot. We need to disable it in order to remount a writable version and take a new snapshot to boot from later\n\nTl;Dr: To create the VM image:\n\nClone Munkis macadmin-script repo\n\nRun installinstallmacos.py and choose a version matching the last kernel source drop\n\nMount and open the downloaded Install_macOS_<version>-<build>.dmg\n\nOpen VMware Fusion and create a new VM via the File menu\n\nDrag and Drop the Install macOS <name> App from the mounted disk image into the Select the Installation Method Fusion dialog\n\nI suggest cranking up the VMs CPU and Memory at this point\n\nAfter picking your language in the macOS installer open Utilities -> Terminal\n\nEnter csrutil disable to disable System Integrity Protection\n\nEnter csrutil authenticated-root disable to disable Authenticated Root\n\nQuit the Terminal app via Cmd+Q\n\nFollow through with the macOS installation, creating a user called user. If you don’t have any disk available to install to, you might need to use the Disk Utility to format the virtual disk first\n\nGo to System Preferences -> Software Update -> Advanced… and uncheck Check for updates\n\nGo to System Preferences -> Energy Saver and check Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off\n\nGo to System Preferences -> Sharing and check Remote Login to enable sshd\n\nAdd your ssh pubkey to both your users and roots authorized_keys files\n\nOptionally disable WindowServer and other non-essential services via launchd. Note that you will obviously loose the GUI: sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.WindowServer.plist\n\nCheck that everything looks alright:\n\nPrepare a Kernel optimized for fuzzing\n\nYou might be wondering why we aren’t using one of the precompiled kernels available in Apples Kernel Development Kits. However those don’t include any kernel built with the KSANCOV feature flag. KSANCOV is Apples take on an API that allows userspace to request the kernel to start tracing which kernel code a given thread touched and exposing that information to userspace. This information is required by Syzkaller to be really effective at fuzzing.\n\nLuckily afrojer@ is releasing semi-regularly updated instructions on building XNU from source and installing it on macOS on his blog. At the time of writing he is lagging three minor source drop versions behind. The most recent instructions are for macOS 11.2. We’ll cover some additional required changes in this text.\n\nBuilding and testing a XNU useful for fuzzing:\n\nDownload a somewhat recent Xcode from Apples Xcode versions archive (Apple ID login required) to your VM. I’m using Xcode 12.5. I had issues with 12.5.1 and 13 beta 4\n\nOpen the Xcode_<version>.xip to extract. Make a coffee ⏳\n\nDrag and Drop the extracted Xcode app into your VMs Applications folder\n\nStart Xcode, agree to the license and quit it after it finishes installation\n\nCreate and join a directory named kernel in the users home dir and cd into it\n\nDownloading afrojer@s Makefile: curl https://jeremya.com/sw/Makefile.xnudeps > Makefile.xnudeps Note this file is not versioned, but always updated in place. Here is an archive link to the version at the time of writing.\n\nmake -f Makefile.xnudeps macos_version=11.5 xnudeps This will get the dependencies for building the 11.5 XNU. Check out the original blog post for details on how to fetch dependencies for a specific version\n\ncd into ~/kernel/xnu-<version>/\n\nApply required XNU patches manually or via git am. Applying via git requires you to init the repo and commit all files first. That's probably a good idea anyway to track further changes you might make\n\nThe patches for MakeInc.def and kasan.c are required for the KASAN kernel to build. KASAN is short for KernelAddressSANitizer - a feature to detect a bunch of memory safety issues inside the kernel during runtime\n\nThe ksancov.h patch is required for building syzkallers executor. Executor is C++ and hence doesn't like the void pointer casting\n\nFinally the cpuid.c and cpu_threads.c patches are required for our kernel to boot on Qemu\n\nRun mount and look for the roots mount device. On my VM it looks like this /dev/disk2s5s1 on / (apfs, sealed, local, read-only, journaled). Now remember the devices name, ignoring the last sN part. So I note down /dev/disk2s5\n\nCd into ~/kernel/xnu-<version>/ and run the following, replacing <your_disk> to build and install your kernel\n\nmkdir -p BUILD/mnt sudo mount -o nobrowse -t apfs /dev/<your_disk> $PWD/BUILD/mnt make SDKROOT=macosx TARGET_CONFIGS=\"KASAN X86_64 NONE\" KSANCOV=1 kmutil create -a x86_64 -Z -n boot sys \\ -B BUILD/BootKernelExtensions.kc.kasan \\ -S BUILD/SystemKernelExtensions.kc.kasan \\ -k BUILD/obj/kernel.kasan \\ --elide-identifier com.apple.driver.AppleIntelTGLGraphicsFramebuffer sudo ditto BUILD/BootKernelExtensions.kc.kasan \"$PWD/BUILD/mnt/System/Library/KernelCollections/\" sudo ditto BUILD/SystemKernelExtensions.kc.kasan \"$PWD/BUILD/mnt/System/Library/KernelCollections/\" sudo ditto BUILD/obj/kernel.kasan \"$PWD/BUILD/mnt/System/Library/Kernels/\" sudo bless --folder $PWD/BUILD/mnt/System/Library/CoreServices --bootefi --create-snapshot sudo nvram boot-args=\"-v kcsuffix=kasan wlan.skywalk.enable=0\"\n\nAfter rebooting you should see your shiny new kernel when running uname -a: Darwin users-Mac.local 20.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 20.6.0: Mon Aug 9 16:12:43 PDT 2021; user:xnu-7195.141.2/BUILD/obj/KASAN_X86_64 x86_64\n\nFor effective fuzzing we'll need the kernels binary, symbols and source on the host. Copy them like this:\n\nmkdir -p ~/115/src/Users/user/kernel/ ~/115/obj rsync -r mac:/Users/user/kernel/xnu-7195.141.2 ~/115/src/Users/user/kernel/ mv ~/115/src/Users/user/kernel/xnu-7195.141.2/BUILD/obj/KASAN_X86_64/kernel.kasan ~/115/obj/ mv ~/115/src/Users/user/kernel/xnu-7195.141.2/BUILD/obj/KASAN_X86_64/kernel.kasan.dSYM/ ~/115/obj/\n\nPreparing VM for Qemu\n\nEven though Macs are AMD64 machines with EFIs (at least the once we care about here), they aren't exactly IBM PC compatible. So far VMWare Fusion did all the trickery necessary to virtualize macOS for us, but qemu-system-x86_64 does not.\n\nTo make macOS boot we'll first start Qemu with OVMF (tianocore based UEFI for qemu). Next we boot OpenCore, which will do some trickery making it possible to chainload Apples stock AMD64 EFI bootloader. It also does some binary kernel patching, making it possible to load the RELEASE kernel shipped with macOS, should we want that.\n\nOpenCore is rather configurable, but we don't care about real hardware. I'm using this version prebuild and configured to work inside Qemu. We can simply overwrite the EFI partition on our VMs disk with the EFI partition from one of the images from this repo.\n\nLet's first find out which partition we will overwrite in a minute. From the following output from within the macOS VM (still booted via Fusion for now) we can see that in my case the EFI partition is at /dev/disk0s1:\n\nuser@users-Mac ~ % diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical): #: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER 0: GUID_partition_scheme *69.8 GB disk0 1: EFI EFI 209.7 MB disk0s1 2: Apple_APFS Container disk1 69.6 GB disk0s2 /dev/disk1 (synthesized): #: TYPE NAME SIZE IDENTIFIER 0: APFS Container Scheme - +69.6 GB disk1 Physical Store disk0s2 1: APFS Volume macos - Data 43.2 GB disk1s1 2: APFS Volume Preboot 385.6 MB disk1s2 3: APFS Volume Recovery 623.2 MB disk1s3 4: APFS Volume VM 1.1 MB disk1s4 5: APFS Volume macos 16.0 GB disk1s5 6: APFS Snapshot com.apple.bless.4099... 16.0 GB disk1s5s1\n\nNow download OpenCore-v13.iso.gz and extract the image via gzip -d OpenCore-v13.iso.gz. Display the partition map to find out the images blocksize and the EFI partitions offset and size.\n\nuser@users-Mac ~ % hdiutil pmap ./OpenCore-v13.iso MEDIA: \"\"; Size 150 MB [307200 x 512]; Max Transfer Blocks 2048 SCHEME: 1 GPT, \"GPT Partition Scheme\" [16] SECTION: 1 Type:'MAP'; Size 150 MB [307200 x 512]; Offset 34 Blocks (307133 + 67) x 512 ID Type Offset Size Name (1) -- -------------------- ------------ ------------ -------------------- -------- 1 EFI 40 307120 disk image\n\nNow put all those values together in a dd command like so: sudo dd if=./OpenCore-v13.iso of=/dev/disk0s1 bs=512 iseek=40 count=307120\n\nNow let's mount the EFI disk via sudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 ~/mnt/. We have to edit OpenCores config file a tiny bit. We disable the boot device selector, as that will prevent us from starting the VMs during fuzzing completely automatically. Additionally note how we set boot-args here. In VMware Fusion we were able to use the normal macOS tools like nvram and csrutil. In OpenCore we need to set these settings in the config.plist instead.\n\nEdit ~/mnt/EFI/OC/config.plist like so:\n\nindex 8537ca8..a46de97 100755--- a/Users/user/mnt/EFI/OC/config.plist +++ b/Users/user/mnt/EFI/OC/config.plist @@-799,7+799,7@@<key>PollAppleHotKeys</key><true/><key>ShowPicker</key>-<true/>+<false/><key>TakeoffDelay</key><integer>0</integer><key>Timeout</key>@@-944,7+944,7@@<key>SystemAudioVolume</key><data>Rg==</data><key>boot-args</key>-<string>keepsyms=1</string>+<string>-v kcsuffix=kasan wlan.skywalk.enable=0 keepsyms=1 debug=0x100008 kasan.checks=4294967295</string><key>csr-active-config</key><data>Jg8=</data><key>prev-lang:kbd</key>\n\nAt this point you should still be able to (re)boot the VM in Fusion. It will just ignore OpenCore however. That's fine.\n\nPrepare isa-applesmc\n\nOn boot macOS checks whether it is booted on a proper Mac by reading a value from its System Management Controller and comparing it with the value it expects. We'll retrieve this value now and pass it to qemu later. To retrieve the value:\n\nDownload the smc_read.c source from this site.\n\ngcc -Wall -o smc_read smc_read.c -framework IOKit ./smc_read\n\nThat will produce a single line of text which you will later have to substitute in for a place marked <YOUR_APPLE_SMC_HERE>.\n\nBooting macOS via Qemu\n\nSetup Homebrew on your host macOS\n\nInstall qemu via homebrew\n\nYour VMs disk should be somewhere like this on your host ~/Virtual\\ Machines.localized/macOS-11.5-20G71.vmwarevm/Virtual\\ Disk.vmdk. Convert it to qcow2 via something like this qemu-img convert -U ./Virtual\\ Disk.vmdk -O qcow2 ~/115/mac_hdd.qcow\n\nUnfortunately OVMF is currently not packaged in Homebrew. Download the ovmf package from ubuntu. Extract it via ar -xv ./ovmf_2020.11-4_all.deb and tar -xvf ./data.tar.xz. Finally mv ./usr/share/OVMF /usr/local/share/OVMF\n\nThat's pretty much all you should need in order to boot the VM image we build. Start Qemu like so. Remember to substitute <YOUR_APPLE_SMC_HERE> and the username in the disk image path:\n\nqemu-system-x86_64 \\ -device isa-applesmc,osk=\"<YOUR_APPLE_SMC_HERE>\" \\ -accel hvf -machine q35 -smp \"2\",cores=\"2\",sockets=\"1\" -m \"4096\" \\ -cpu Penryn,vendor=GenuineIntel,+invtsc,vmware-cpuid-freq=on,\"+pcid,+ssse3,+sse4.2,+popcnt,+avx,+aes,+xsave,+xsaveopt,check\" \\ -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly=on,file=\"/usr/local/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd\" \\ -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly=on,file=\"/usr/local/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd\" \\ -device ich9-intel-hda -device hda-duplex -device ich9-ahci,id=sata \\ -device ide-hd,bus=sata.4,drive=MacHDD \\ -drive id=MacHDD,if=none,file=\"/Users/user/115/macos_11_5.qcow\",format=qcow2 \\ -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::1042-:22, -device e1000-82545em,netdev=net0,id=net0 \\ -device usb-ehci,id=ehci -usb -device usb-kbd -device usb-tablet \\ -monitor stdio -vga vmware\n\nYou should both see the macOS UI and be able to ssh user@localhost -p 1042. Confirm we are booted into your KASAN kernel:\n\nuser@users-Mac ~ % uname -a Darwin users-Mac.local 20.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 20.6.0: Mon Aug 9 16:12:43 PDT 2021; user:xnu-7195.141.2/BUILD/obj/KASAN_X86_64 x86_64\n\nShut down your VM now. We'll let syzkaller boot it back up soon.\n\nBuilding Syzkaller\n\nInstall go via homebrew\n\nAdd something like this to your .zshrc:\n\nexport GOPATH=/Users/user/go export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\nRelogin and build syzkaller like this:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/google/syzkaller cd syzkaller make HOSTOS=darwin HOSTARCH=amd64 TARGETOS=darwin TARGETARCH=amd64 SOURCEDIR=/Users/user/115/src/Users/user/kernel/xnu-7195.141.2\n\nFuzzing with Syzkaller\n\nWe need g++ to make C reproducers work.
