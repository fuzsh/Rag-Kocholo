        "text": "I feel that all has been said about this. Why not participating in the latest Linux discussion?\n\nBecause they decided it was not worth the effort for the current user base.\n\nThere is no sense in a Linux discussion. If Adobe does port their software on Linux, they will do it and announce Linux at a time.\n\nIn the meantime use the Bug/Feature request to let Adobe hear your request: Feature Request/Bug Report Form\n\nABAMBO | Hard- and Software Engineer | Photographer\n\nIt's not the numbers that don't add up. It's the fact that many users have dual boot systems, and only Microsoft records the data and reports it.\n\nI've been an avid Linux user for 3 years now and I do all my visuals there, including all my business material with ease. Lately the OS has become extremely viable with good support by both companies and it's community. And now with Valve's Proton, even the latest Windows games play flawlessly. I've actually tested it, so I know it works.\n\nBack to the visuals, Black Magic is doing big steps to secure the Linux market, and lets be honest, all major VFX studios have Linux as a prerequisite. That's because all major applications work there much better and crashes are minimal, if non existent. The only app crash I've seen are in beta testing. Additionally, the reason there are so many companies that support Windows and Mac for their utilities especially, is that there are no alternatives. So, most seek the easy solution for video transcoding, audio reformatting etc.\n\nThe C language basically depends on two major things: the compiler and the external libraries. I played a little with the C++ and I have options to compile for any platform, as long as the respective compiler is there. Therefore, I trust the real technical issue is the libraries. Adobe uses Directx, Linux uses Opengl and Vulcan. The latter is up to par with Directx. Not to mention Apple uses mainly Opengl, so that isn't exactly an excuse either. Therefore the effort to port the applications is minimal. The true reason I suspect has to do with contract partnerships between Adobe, Microsoft and Apple. Because imagine, should the Adobe Suite and the Office 365 become available on Linux, it will sooner or later spell doom for the two companies. Perhaps not so much for Apple that builds hardware and locks it, but Microsoft will definitely feel it.\n\nHi Everyone,\n\nI just thought I'd bring up a different perspective. Everyone talks about private computing, or corporate users, but it honestly surprises me the complete disregard that the research world seems to get. Maybe because they don't get out much... who knows.\n\nI've been using Linux in various flavours since 2001, and the general user-friendliness of distributions like Ubuntu have addressed most of the problems long-associated with Linux. The biggest obstacle now, (at least in my experience) is the availability of industry-grade software for Linux. Imagine if Adobe wasn't made available for MacOS? How many people would be using it today?\n\nLinux users seem to suffer from the \"chicken and egg\" situation caused by corporate inertia. Every software company complains about \"how few people use Linux\" to justify doing nothing. It would only take a few big software firms to start supporting Linux like Autodesk and Adobe (and that's just the As) to radically change that landscape, and encourage much wider adoption of Linux in the general population.\n\nThe ability to build custom PCs with a good performance-to-value ratio, drop a stable, free OS like Linux on it, and use commercial software to get stuff done would be the holy trifecta for many users, ranging from small businesses, researchers, students, and even larger organizations. We'd finally be able to squeeze more performance from our systems, regardless of the price we'd paid for it.\n\nI've worked as an IT Systems Administrator, Systems Engineer, and Solutions Architect for several research schools for the Australian National University. In the Research School of Chemistry, in the computational Chemistry division alone, there's 50 users running Ubuntu who'd desperately appreciate the ability to use Adobe products without dual-booting into Windows. In the Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering, I can think of another 100 people who'd dump Windows in a heart beat if they could use Adobe's and/or AutoDesk's products with it. The cost savings in the digital media school, if they were suddenly freed from paying Apple prices for borderline-adequate hardware, could afford some serious upgrades in RAM, CPUs, Video cards, NASs, more than enough to upgrade to a rig capable of editing vast tracts of 4K footage, and high detail 3D rendering.\n\nWhile MacOS X does have some proprietary elements. It still has a strong basis on Unix. Building a precompiled binary for a common distribution like Ubuntu shouldn't require the \"reinventing the wheel\" level of difficulty implied by others here.\n\nAs a web designer, IT support, in-house research photographer, and now a small-business operator. I can assure you that businesses and universities alike are cutting costs, and are all about the Return on Investment. (ROI). Stale arguments about Linux not being worthwhile are short-sighted.\n\nHonestly, I consider myself amongst the first people who would ditch Windows if I could run Adobe software on Linux. I'm just unwilling to pay Apple prices for hardware, and I'm honestly tired of the unnecessary bloat, constant update-based restarts that Windows forces upon it's users.\n\nI know my opinion isn't worth much, but I'd happily offer any assistance, testing, and feedback toward getting Adobe to join the Linux bandwagon.\n\nPlease pass this request on to whoever might like to take the challenge up.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nHamish.\n\nOk, fair enough - but at least for a share of Mac and Win users, that is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Users like myself would've been on Linux since 2011, if it wasn't for the lack of Adobe CC support.\n\nBy refusing to port even just one of their apps to Linux, Adobe is preventing a good share of users from using an OS they'd find more comfortable, as well as losing potential revenue from other users already working with what they have in Linux.\n\nI know that if Adobe had had Linux support, I would have bought my current machine (Dell XPS 9380) with Ubuntu pre-installed, and saved myself some money to put towards my Adobe subscription. Adobe software is the only non-free/open-source software I use on my machine, and I know there's many like me - or at least enough to have threads such as this one everywhere all the time.\n\nHi Abambo long time, no read.\n\nIs always great to get attention from you and your feedback.\n\nYou keep people in-line and honest.\n\nI apologize if I posted twice my reply.\n\nIt was not my intention to be annoying, this was an error when I was uploading my replies in different threads at the same time while using my mobile device.\n\nAlso, I didn't posted the screenshots from my Android device thinking of them from an art appreciation standpoint; much less it was my itention to agitate the bee hive.\n\nI just didn't wanted to continue to type in my extensive reply all of the Adobe apps that are finally available and supported for the Android linux kernel.\n\nI can tell this topic becomes sensitive, and I can clearly tell the difference between how it feels to be welcomed or not welcomed at all... just the same way it feels during job- hiring interviews when I've applied for computer jobs during the last 20 years.\n\nLet's not forget that I am also here in these forums helping MS Windows and Apple users.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated to see answers marked as correct too for those individuals that take the time and efffort in learning linux.\n\nI have stated before in these forums that I am a linux enthusiast, but I am extremely vendor neutral as well.\n\nSo when it breaks down to the content that I've just posted, I really know what I'm talking about.\n\nNothing in my content was aimed to put down the MS Windows family of operating systems, nor the Unix-like operating systems in the macOS and iOS families of operating system.\n\nI am sorry, if in the past I've been sarcastic to macOS users and have engaged unnecessarily in heated discussions with other community users and MVPs.\n\nIf my participation is not welcomed in these forums, all you have to say is we don't want you here, and I'll leave the forums.\n\nIs there a way to delete the duplicated thread ?"
