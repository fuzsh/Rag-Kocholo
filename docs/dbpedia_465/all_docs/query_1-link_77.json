        "text": "-BEGin=1\n\nsets the beginning position for all input sequences. When the beginning position is set from the command line, Xnu ignores beginning positions specified for individual sequences in a list file.\n\n-END=100\n\nsets the ending position for all input sequences. When the ending position is set from the command line, Xnu ignores ending positions specified for sequences in a list file.\n\n-PRObability=.01\n\nFor a repeat to be recognized, it must score high enough so that you would not expect to see a higher score more than once in 100 searches of random sequences of average length and composition. Use this parameter to change that expectation cutoff. Setting this cutoff lower than its default of 0.01 makes the search more stringent and the number of repeats masked off fewer. The minimum and maximum values of this parameter are 0.0001 and 0.1.\n\n-WIDth=4\n\nsets the maximum size of a repeat. If a repeat were of length five, even if it were significant, it would not be found if this parameter were set to four. When this value is set to zero, Xnu will search for repeats of any size. Very short repeats may not score above the default probability cutoff (see -PRObability above). The maximum value of this parameter is 100. The larger it is, the longer the search will take.\n\n-EXTension=.xnu\n\nThis program normally creates output file names by using the original input file name for the base name and the program name for the name extension. Use this parameter to specify some other file name extension.\n\n-LIStfile=xnu.list\n\nwrites a list file with the names of the output sequence files. This list file is suitable for input to other Wisconsin Package programs that support list files (see Chapter 2, Using Sequence Files and Databases in the User's Guide.) If you don't specify a file name, then Xnu makes one up using xnu for the file name and .list for the file name extension.\n\n-MONitor\n\nThis program normally monitors its progress on your screen. However, when you use -Default to suppress all program interaction, you also suppress the monitor. You can turn it back on with this parameter. If you are running the program in batch, the monitor will appear in the log file.\n\n-SUMmary\n\nwrites a summary of the program's work to the screen when you've used -Default to suppress all program interaction. A summary typically displays at the end of a program run interactively. You can suppress the summary for a program run interactively with -NOSUMmary.\n\nYou can also use this parameter to cause a summary of the program's work to be written in the log file of a program run in batch."
