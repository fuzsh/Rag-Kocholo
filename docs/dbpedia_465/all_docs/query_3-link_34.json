This vulnerability was introduced in macOS 14.0 and iOS 17.0 and is fixed in tvOS 17.5, visionOS 1.2, iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5, watchOS 10.5, macOS Sonoma 14.5. Proof-of-concept exploit code was developed by security researcher Joseph Ravichandran, dubbed Turpentine. The write up for this vulnerability was released on the June 20, 2024. This vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a buffer overflow that can enable an app to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.\n\nThis vulnerability, which stems from an improper implementation of a performance optimization, allows an attacker to execute an arbitrary code attack with kernel privileges in which more data can be written into the buffer’s data field than the maximum the field allows. MacOS 14.0 Sonoma with xnu-10002.1.13 was the first release with the vulnerability and macOS Sonoma 14.5 (23F79) with xnu-10063.121.3 was the first release with the fix for the vulnerability.\n\nIf exploited it allows for an attacker to perform an arbitrary code execution, currently an attack vector is undefined and no CVSS score has been assigned to this CVE. If an were impacted by this vulnerability it would allow an attacker to run code on the affected device which can lead to data exfiltration, corrupted software or data, or even system compromise. This can result in financial, data, or reputational loss.\n\nApple has released fix xnu-10063.121.3 in the XNU Kernel. This enables users to write up to 255 bytes of data into the buffer’s data field instead of just 224 bytes of data. This helps protect users from a potential buffer overflow or arbitrary code attack."
