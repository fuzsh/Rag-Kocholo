        "text": "❯ iOS Development Training – A Brief Idea\n\nAn iOS is a mobile phone operating system created and developed by Apple Incorporation. It is distributed exclusively for Apple hardware. It has a state-of-the-art environment that enables developers to create and produce powerful applications proactively. iPhone has several built-in applications, has quality peripherals, and provides direct manipulation in the user interface (UI) for multi-touch gestures. The iOS kernel is XNU. Apps are developed using a software development kit (SDK) with Xcode extension toolset – compilers and framework.\n\nThe iOS Development Training using Swift will introduce with the exciting world of iOS application development. Swift is a brand new programming language for iOS and OS X applications, both of which adopt safe programming patterns and adds modern features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more fun. This course will enable us to design and develop applications for iPhones and iPads. Apart from the tools and language, you will explore design patterns, coding conventions and guidelines, and essential concepts like model-view-controller, storyboards, and delegation. Also, learn what is possible within the new iOS 7 interface, and obtain a checklist for successfully submitting your app to the App Store. Here’s an iOS Dev Hiring Guide for the employers looking for i0S Developers.\n\n❯ iOS Application Development – Challenges\n\nThe various challenges while learning iOS Development are mentioned as follows:\n\nThe working of the approval process is a mystery in some cases.\n\nThe App Store review guidelines are a big challenge as policies are left to Apple’s discretion of what they feel is right.\n\nGetting used to Xcode updates is quite buggy, as they crash a lot.\n\nAt times, the iOS SDK documentation can be minimal or misleading – with new features, Apple releases a new SDK.\n\nThe web services use older technologies like RSS instead of using more modern protocols.\n\nIt is difficult to stay tuned with frequent updates of the new features.\n\nOptimizing for performance is also a big challenge as it eats up an ample amount of time.\n\n❯ Course Objectives\n\nAfter the completion of iOS Application Development using Swift course at OPTnation, you will be able to:\n\nStart quick coding in Objective-C\n\nHands-on proficiency with Objective-C\n\nTaking advantage of numerous powerful features of the Objective-C language and the libraries and frameworks of the iOS
