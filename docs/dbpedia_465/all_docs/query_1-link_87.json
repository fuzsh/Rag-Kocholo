J.},\n\nabstractNote = {GPDRV is a Device Driver for the RSX-11M Operating System designed as a software interface between RSX-11M and the IEEE-488 Bus via a Tektronix CP1100 Interface. GPDRV allows communication with the IEEE-488 Bus by use of the RSX-11M standard FORTRAN READ, WRITE, QIO Statements. The Tektronix CP1100 Interface must be modified so all 8 interrupts will interrupt through the same vector and bit 14 of the Bus Address Register will indicate if the CP1100 Interface is System Controller. The CP1100 Interface may be further modified if it is System Controller (bit 14 of the Bus Address Register equals a zero) so that Interface Clear and Remote Enable cannot be sent by the Interface. A more detailed explanation of the CP1100 may be found the the ''TEKTRONIX CP1100/IEEE 488 INTERFACE'' Instruction Manual.},\n\ndoi = {10.2172/6305994},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6305994}, journal = {},\n\nnumber = ,\n\nvolume = ,\n\nplace = {United States},\n\nyear = {Wed Nov 01 00:00:00 EST 1978},\n\nmonth = {Wed Nov 01 00:00:00 EST 1978}\n\n}"
