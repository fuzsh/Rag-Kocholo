Britton & Rose - has the northernmost distribution of any of the large, columnar cacti of the tropical and subtropical Americas. Formerly regarded as a member of the genus Cereus, it is now considered the single species of its own genus, Carnegiea. It is a principal indicator species of the Sonoran Desert and is found at...\n\nImplications of seed size for seedling survival in Carnegiea gigantea and Ferocactus wislizeni (Cactaceae)\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBowers, Janice E.; Pierson, E.A.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nLarger seeds have been shown to convey benefits for seedling survival but the mechanisms of this process are not well understood. In this study, seed size and seedling survival were compared for 2 sympatric cactus species, Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.) Britt. & Rose and Ferocactus wislizeni (Engelm.) Britt. & Rose, in laboratory and field experiments in the northern Sonoran Desert. Both species have small seeds, but Ferocactus seeds are nearly twice as long and 3 times as heavy as those of Carnegiea. The difference in size is perpetuated after germination: new Ferocactus seedlings have 4 times the estimated volume of new Carnegiea seedlings. In an outdoor experiment, annual survivorship of both species was low but was 6 times higher for Ferocactus (6 seedlings, 8.1%) than Carnegiea (1 seedling, 1.4%). The pattern of seedling mortality in relation to temperature and rain suggests that, after the initial flush of seed and seedling predation, drought and heat took a greater toll on Carnegiea than Ferocactus seedlings, probably because the larger seedling volume of Ferocactus conferred greater drought tolerance. In addition, F. wislizeni could become established without benefit of nurse plants whereas C. gigantea could not; this might reflect differential tolerance to high soil temperatures.\n\nMorphology, nurse plants, and minimum apical temperatures for young Carnegiea gigantea\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNobel, P.S.\n\n1980-06-01\n\nThe northern limit of Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.) Britton and Rose apparently depends on minimum apical temperatures. Diameters, apical spine coverage, and effects of nurse plants on incoming long-wave (infrared (ir)) radiation, all of which affect apical temperatures, were therefore determined for stems of C. gigantea up to 4 m tall at four sites along a north-south transect in Arizona. A simulation model indicated that the increase in diameter accompanying stem growth raised the minimum apical temperature more than 3 C. Thus, plants with the shortest stems would be expected to be the most vulnerable to freezing damage; indeed, freezing damagemoreÂ Â» on stems <0.5 m tall without nurse plants was fairly common at the colder sites. Nurse plants obstructed a greater portion of the sky for C. gigantea at the colder sites; e.g., the effective environmental temperature for ir radiation at such locations was raised more than 10 C for stems under 1 m tall. If the northern limit of C. gigantea reflects wintertime survival of juveniles, nurse plants could extend the range by offering some protection against freezing.Â«Â less\n\nWater relations of cacti during desiccation: distribution of water in tissues. [Carnegiea gigantea; Ferocactus acanthodes; Opuntia basilaris\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBarcikowski, W.; Nobel, P.S.\n\n1984-03-01\n\nThree species of cacti survived an average stem water loss of 81%. Fractional water loss was greater from water-storage tissue than from the chlorenchyma, as documented at the cellular level by determining changes in cell volume and at the tissue level by determining relative water content of chlorenchyma and storage tissues. For Carnegiea gigantea and Ferocactus acanthodes, this differential loss of water resulted from a decrease in the moles of solute per cell for storage tissue; hence, less water was retained at a given osmotic pressure than for the chlorenchyma. Opuntia basilaris lost less water from the chlorenchyma during droughtmoreÂ Â» because of a greater initial osmotic pressure in the chlorenchyma than in the storage tissue. Greater retention of water in the chlorenchyma would result in less disruption of photosynthetic activity in these cacti during drought.Â«Â less\n\nConcomitant changes in high temperature tolerance and heat-shock proteins in desert succulents. [Agave deserti, Carnegiea gigantea, Ferocactus acanthodes\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKee, S.C.; Nobel, P.S.\n\n1986-02-01\n\nRaising the day/night air temperatures from 30/sup 0/C/20/sup 0/C to 50/sup 0/C/40/sup 0/C increases the high temperature tolerated by Agave deserti, Carnegiea gigantea, and Ferocactus acanthodes by 6/sup 0/C to 8/sup 0/C; the increase is about half completed in 3 days and fully completed in 10 days. A 25 to 27 kilodalton protein concomitantly accumulates for all three desert succulents upon transfer to 50/sup 0/C/40/sup 0/C, while accumulation of other heat heat-shock proteins is species specific. Some of the induced proteins are more abundant at 3 days, while others (including the 25-27 kilodalton protein) remain after completion of high temperaturemoreÂ Â» acclimation.Â«Â less\n\nRegional demographic trends from long-term studies of saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) across the northern Sonoran Desert\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nPierson, Elizabeth A.; Betancourt, Julio L.; Turner, Raymond M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTen saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) populations in the northern Sonoran Desert were monitored from 1959 to 2005 to discriminate how climate influences plant growth, abundance, reproductive potential, survivorship, age structure and regeneration trends. Thousands of saguaros were measured to determine site-specific growth rates and survivorship through time. Observed growth rates were used to predict the ages of saguaros and reconstruct local and regional regeneration patterns back to the late 18th century. Both growth rates and degree of branching generally tracked temperature and moisture gradients. Site-specific age-height models explained 89-97% of variance in observed ages, with a slope of nearly one. Regeneration was more consistent at sites in the western (hotter/drier) than eastern (cooler/wetter) sites, which exhibited clear multidecadal variability in regeneration rates. Averaged across the region, saguaro regeneration rates were highest from 1780 to 1860, coincident with wet conditions and high Pinus ponderosa recruitment in the highlands. Milder and wetter winters and protection from livestock grazing likely promoted late 20th century regeneration surges at some sites. Predictions of saguaro population dynamics in the 21st century likely will be confounded by the saguaro's episodic and asynchronous regeneration, continued urbanization, ongoing grass invasions and associated wildfires, and changing climate.\n\nRegeneration of Carnegiea gigantea (Cactaceae) since 1850 in three populations in the northern Sonoran Desert\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDrezner, Taly Dawn\n\n2006-03-01\n\nSaguaro cacti ( Carnegiea gigantea) are long-lived and exhibit great variability in growth that makes age estimation problematic. A few single-site studies have focused on those locales where long-term data (e.g. 85 years) are available. Using a newly developed technique, 733 saguaros were sampled in three locales (Silverbell, Harcuvar, Kofa) across Arizona and their age structure reconstructed for the last 150 years based on a mathematical model of the heights of individuals. This is the first study to compare regeneration at multiple locations across the species' range. Regression analysis for each site (years and frequency of individuals established during that year) was run and residuals extracted to determine peaks and troughs in regeneration over time. Correlation was run on the residuals between sites, and chi-square analysis was employed to compare frequency of good and bad regeneration years between Kofa and Silverbell. Peaks and troughs represent regeneration as well as survivorship and mortality. Several large cohorts established at Kofa and Harcuvar since 1850, while at Silverbell well over 80% of sampled saguaros established after the late 1930s. This more recent recruitment at Silverbell may be related to the major freezing event of 1937 whose impact was likely greater at the cooler Silverbell site. Despite the widely different population structures at Silverbell and Kofa, recruitment trends in both populations were statistically linked as both locales often benefited from the same favorable periods for regeneration ( P < 0.001). The Harcuvar population shares some common peaks and troughs in regeneration over time with Kofa and Silverbell, but its relationship to them is not statistically significant. Some trends overlap in some locales, such as the favorable regeneration period in the late 1800s and early 1900s, particularly at Silverbell and Kofa as well as at other known sites. However, each population has its own signature. Silverbell is a\n\nSaguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) Mortality and Population Regeneration in the Cactus Forest of Saguaro National Park: Seventy-Five Years and Counting\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOrum, Thomas V.; Ferguson, Nancy; Mihail, Jeanne D.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAnnual census data spanning seventy-five years document mortality and regeneration in a population of saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) in the Cactus Forest of the Rincon Mountain District of Saguaro National Park near Tucson, AZ. On 6 four-hectare plots, each saguaro was censused and a methodical search for new saguaros was conducted annually each year from 1942 through 2016, with the exception of 1955. Regeneration has been episodic with 828 plants established from 1959 through 1993 compared with 34 plants established between 1942 and 1958 and only three plants established after 1993. The years preceding 1959 and following 1993, include some of the driest decades in centuries in southern Arizona. While woodcutting and cattle grazing are believed to be among the causes of decades of failed regeneration prior to 1958, neither of these factors contributed to the failed regeneration following 1993. The height structure of the population from 1942 to 2016 shifted dramatically from a population dominated by large saguaros (> 5.4 m tall) in the first three decades of the study to a population dominated by small saguaros (< 1.8 m tall) in the most recent two decades. Mortality is shown to be strongly age dependent. In the year following the 2011 catastrophic freeze, 21 of 59 plants older than 80 years died compared with zero deaths in 270 plants between the ages of 29 and 80 years. Saguaros under 40 years old, growing under small shrubs or in the open, have a lower probability of survival than better protected saguaros. Long-term population monitoring is essential to understanding the complex impacts of human and environmental factors on the population dynamics of long-lived species.

Yet the highly variable precipitation, temperature and humidity conditions in these environments likely have unique impacts on underlying processes regulating photosynthetic gas exchange and WUE, limiting our ability to predict growth and survival responses of desert CAM plants to climate change. We monitored net CO(2) assimilation (A(net)), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and transpiration (E) rates periodically over 2 years in a natural population of the giant columnar cactus Carnegiea gigantea (saguaro) near Tucson, Arizona USA to investigate environmental and physiological controls over carbon gain and water loss in this ecologically important plant. We hypothesized that seasonal changes in daily integrated water use efficiency (WUE(day)) in this constitutive CAM species would be driven largely by stomatal regulation of nighttime transpiration and CO(2) uptake responding to shifts in nighttime air temperature and humidity. The lowest WUE(day) occurred during time periods with extreme high and low air vapor pressure deficit (D(a)). The diurnal with the highest D(a) had low WUE(day) due to minimal net carbon gain across the 24 h period. Low WUE(day) was also observed under conditions of low D(a); however, it was due to significant transpiration losses. Gas exchange measurements on potted saguaro plants exposed to experimental changes in D(a) confirmed the relationship between D(a) and g(s). Our results suggest that climatic changes involving shifts in air temperature and humidity will have large impacts on the water and carbon economy of the giant saguaro and potentially other succulent CAM plants of warm desert environments.\n\nThe paradoxical distribution of a shallow-rooted keystone species away from surface water, near the water-limited edge of its range in the Sonoran Desert: Seed-seedling conflicts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDrezner, Taly Dawn\n\n2013-02-01\n\nSpecies distributions reflect limiting factors, particularly near the margins of their range where density and abundance decrease as environmental factors decrease or increase to non-optimal conditions. I test whether the keystone saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea), a shallow-rooted species, is indeed distributed disproportionately in areas of concentrated drainage (runnels) in a water-limited population. Carnegiea and a common nurse were sampled at a marginal site in and out of areas with concentrated surface water and chi-square analysis was used to determine the pattern of distribution. In this study I found that, surprisingly, near the hot, water-limited edge of their range, C. gigantea are found significantly less often in areas where more water would be available to them. For example, while only 20% of nurses were on interfluves, half of Carnegiea protÃ©gÃ© were there. One possible explanation is that the subsequent redistribution of seeds by water away from preferred microsites may be important in shaping the final pattern of successful establishment. The shallow-rooted Carnegiea relies entirely on surface water for its moisture; it is thus paradoxical that the surface water so fundamentally essential to its survival throughout its life appears to hinder its establishment in precisely those sites where the greatest surface water would be available, particularly near the water-limited edge of its range.\n\nThe interaction of drought and habitat explain space-time patterns of establishment in saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea).\n\nPubMed\n\nWinkler, Daniel E; Conver, Joshua L; Huxman, Travis E; Swann, Don E\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe long-lived columnar saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) is among the most studied plants in the world. Long-term studies have shown saguaro establishment to be generally episodic and strongly influenced by precipitation and temperature. Water limitation through lower-than-average seasonal rainfall and elevated temperatures increasing evaporative loss can reduce survivorship of recent germinates. Thus, multi-year, extended drought could cause populations to decline as older saguaros die without replacement. Previous studies have related establishment to temporal variation in rainfall, but most studies have been on non-randomized plots in ideal habitat and thus might not have captured the full variability within the local area. We studied how saguaro establishment varied in space and which habitat features may buffer responses to drought on 36 4-ha plots located randomly across an elevation gradient, including substantial replication in landscape position (bajada, foothills, and slopes) in the two disjunct districts of Saguaro National Park in southern Arizona, USA. Recent, severe drought coincided with drastic declines in saguaro establishment across this ~25,000-ha area. Establishment patterns derived from the park-wide data set was strongly correlated with drought, but the Park's two districts and diversity of plots demonstrated substantially different population outcomes. Saguaro establishment was best explained by the interaction of drought and habitat type; establishment in bajada and foothill plots dropped to near-zero under the most severe periods of water limitation but remained higher in slope plots during the same time span. Combined with saguaro density estimates, these data suggest that the most suitable habitat type for saguaro establishment shifted to higher elevations during the time span of the recent drought. These results place into context the extent to which historical patterns of demography provide insight into future population dynamics in\n\nMicrosatellite markers for Vellozia gigantea (Velloziaceae), a narrowly endemic species to the Brazilian campos rupestres.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartins, Ana Paula V; Proite, Karina; Kalapothakis, Evanguedes; Santos, FabrÃ­cio R; Chaves, Anderson V; Borba, Eduardo L\n\n2012-07-01\n\nMicrosatellite primers were developed for the first time in Velloziaceae, in the endangered species Vellozia gigantea. Using two different protocols, seven primer sets were characterized in three populations of V. gigantea. The primers amplified di- and trinucleotide repeats with six to 12 alleles per locus. These revealed high levels of genetic variation, presenting an average observed heterozygosity of 0.508 in V. gigantea. The seven primers were tested for cross-amplification in three Vellozia species. All primers successfully amplified in V. auriculata. Six primers amplified in V. compacta and three in V. hirsuta. The new marker set described here will be useful for studies of population genetics of V. gigantea. The cross-amplification results indicate the utility of primers for studies in other Vellozia species.\n\nLeaf and stem CO/sub 2/ uptake in the three subfamilies of the Cactaceae. [Pereskia aculeata; Pereskia grandifolia; Maihuenia poeppigii; Carnegiea gigantea; Ferocactus acanthodes; Coryphantha vivipara; Mammillaria dioica; Opuntia ficus-inidica; Pereskiopsis porteri; Quiabentia chacoensis; Austrocylindropuntia subulata\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNobel, P.S.; Hartsock, T.L.\n\nNet CO/sub 2/ uptake over 24-hour periods was examined for the leaves and for the stems of 11 species of cacti representing all three subfamilies. For Pereskia aculeata, Pereskia grandifolia, and Maihuenia poeppigii (subfamily Pereskioideae), all the net shoot CO/sub 2/ uptake was by the leaves and during the daytime. In contrast, for the leafless species Carnegiea gigantea, Ferocactus acanthodes, Coryphantha vivipara, and Mammillaria dioica (subfamily Cactoideae), all the shoot net CO/sub 2/ uptake was by the stems and at night. Similarly, for leafless Opuntia ficus-indica (subfamily Opuntioideae), all net CO/sub 2/ uptake occurred at night. For leafy members ofmoreÂ Â» the Opuntioideae (Pereskiopsis porteri, Quiabentia chacoensis, Austrocylindropuntia subulata), at least 88% of the shoot CO/sub 2/ uptake over 24 hours was by the leaves and some CO/sub 2/ uptake occurred at night. Leaves responded to the instantaneous level of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) during the daytime, as occurs for C/sub 3/ plants, whereas nocturnal CO/sub 2/ uptake by stems of O. ficus-indica and F. acanthodes responded to the total daily PAR, as occurs for Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants. Thus, under the well-watered conditions employed, the Pereskioideae behaved as C/sub 3/ plants, the Cactoideae behaved as CAM plants, and the Opuntioideae exhibited characteristics of both pathways.Â«Â less\n\nPost-fire saguaro community: impacts on associated vegetation still apparent 10 years later\n\nTreesearch\n\nMarcia Narog; Ruth Wilson\n\n2005-01-01\n\nFire impacts on saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) associated vegetation were studied in unburned and burned areas over a 10 year post-fire period after the 1993 Vista View fire, Tonto National Forest, Arizona.

Mucuna gigantea is one such Hawaiian species which has been studied as affordable sustenance and as a cover crop in developing countries. Mucuna gigantea and other Mucuna species (spp.) in general, are known to contain natural levodopa and its utility in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease has also been evaluated. Levodopa is converted in the periphery into dopamine which can then act on dopamine receptors to cause nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias, and hypotension. We describe a case in which a patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting after legume ingestion. The bean was ultimately identified as Mucuna gigantea and the patient was diagnosed with levodopa-induced gastrointestinal toxicity from consumption of the legume. A literature review was conducted using the database search engines, Biological Abstracts and PubMed, with a broad combination of keywords of which include âmucuna, âgigantean,â âlevodopa,â âl-dopa,â âtoxicity,â and the association between Mucuna gigantea ingestion and levodopa toxicity is discussed. These findings expand the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting in the correct clinical context.

To better understand the complex karyotypic evolution of E. gigantea, the karyotypes of specimens from five populations in Brazil were investigated using molecular cytogenetics and phylogenetic approaches. Herein, we used FISH with histone genes as well as sequencing of the COI to determine differential distribution of markers and relationships among populations. The analyses revealed new karyotypes, with variability for chromosome number and morphology of multiple sex chromosome mechanisms, occurrence of B chromosome variants (punctiform and large ones), and high dispersion of histone genes in different karyotypes. These data indicate that chromosomal polymorphism in E. gigantea is greater than previously reported, and that the species can be a valuable model for cytogenetic studies. The COI phylogenetic and haplotype analyses highlighted the formation of three groups with chromosomally polymorphic individuals. Finally, we compared the different karyotypes and proposed a model for the chromosomal evolution of this species. The species E. gigantea includes at least three cytogenetically polymorphic lineages. Moreover, in each of these lineages, different chromosomal rearrangements have been fixed. Dispersion of repetitive sequences may have favored the high frequency of these rearrangements, which could be related to both adaptation of the species to different habitats and the speciation process.\n\nInterim Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Arid West Region\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2006-12-01\n\nsplendens), mesquite (Prosopis spp.), saguaro cactus ( Carnegiea gigantea ), and cholla and prickly pear cacti (Opuntia spp.).

To identify periods of establishment, we determined the relationship between stem height and age for each site, based on observed growth rates in the field, gas-exchange data, and weather records. The average yearly growth for the globular F. acanthodes was relatively constant at about 9 mm yr/sup -1/, but for the club-shaped C. gigantea, it increased with age from 2 mm yr/sup -1/ in the first year to 44 mm yr/sup -1/ at 13moreÂ Â» yr. In years suitable for establishment, seedlings grow to sufficient size that stored water is not depleted by cuticular transpiration during the ensuing drought. The pattern of such suitable years over the last 3 decades correlated with the measured height distributions when the relation between stem height and age was considered. At a Sonoran Desert site, major peaks in the height distribution were centered at 0.05 m and 0.19 m, which corresponded to suitable conditions for establishment in 1976 and 1959, respectively. Rainfall records from various weather stations indicated that both species occurred where at least 10% of the years are suitable for seedling establishment.Â«Â less\n\nDujardinascaris gigantea sp. n.

Three growth parameters, extension rate, skeletal density, and calcification rate were evaluated over the past two decade's interval (1988-2013) in different gender of two massive corals Pavona gigantea and Porites panamensis. The species P. gigantea calcified two-times faster (0.84Â Â±Â 0.29Â gÂ cm -2 yr -1 ) than P. panamensis (0.36Â Â±Â 0.15Â gÂ cm -2 yr -1 ); and male colonies presents13-58% higher calcification rates than females. Annual growth parameters do not show significant trends over the period 1988-2013, but significant, growth disruption associated with ENSO events. The data presented here suggest that P.gigantea and P.panamensis from the area have developed phenotypic plasticity to a wide range of environmental condition; the life history of both species is reflected in their calcification rates during both optimal and non-optimal conditions over the last two decades. Massive species develop denser structures that provide a permanent habitat to many marine species and contributes to the long-term maintenance of coral reef communities in the eastern tropical Pacific.

A classic case is the grassâfire cycle in which grass invasion increases the frequency, scale and/or intensity of wildfires and promotes the continued invasion of invasive grasses. Despite wide acceptance of the grassâfire cycle, questions linger about the relative roles that interspecific plant competition and fire play in ecosystem transformations. Location Sonoran Desert Arizona Upland of the Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona, USA. Methods We measured species cover, density and saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) size structure along gradients of Pennisetum ciliare invasion at 10 unburned/ungrazed P. ciliare patches. Regression models quantified differences in diversity, cover and density with respect to P. ciliare cover, and residence time and a Fisher's exact test detected demographic changes in saguaro populations. Because P. ciliare may have initially invaded locations that were both more invasible and less diverse, we ran analyses with and without the plots in which initial infestations were located. Results Richness and diversity decreased with P. ciliare cover as did cover and density of most dominant species. Richness and diversity declined with increasing time since invasion, suggesting an ongoing transformation. The proportion of old-to-young Carnegiea gigantea was significantly lower in plots with dominant P. ciliare cover. Main conclusions Rich desert scrub (15â25 species per plot) was transformed into depauperate grassland (2â5 species per plot) within 20 years following P. ciliare invasion without changes to the fire regime. While the onset of a grassâfire cycle may drive ecosystem change in the later stages and larger scales of grass invasions of arid lands, competition by P. ciliare can drive small-scale transformations earlier in the invasion.

This study therefore aims at investigating the antimicrobial properties of ethanol leaf and stem bark extracts of P. macrocarpa and C. gigantea using the agar diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques and also determining the anti-inflammatory properties of the extracts of these plants in carrageenan-induced foot edema in seven-day old chicks. The minimum inhibitory concentration of both ethanol leaf and bark extracts of P. macrocarpa against the test organisms was from 0.125 to 2.55âmg/mL and that of C. gigantea extracts was 0.125 to 2.75âmg/mL. Extracts with concentration of 50âmg/mL were most active against the test organisms according to the agar diffusion method. All the extracts of P. macrocarpa and C. gigantea at 30, 100, and 300âmg/kg body weight except ethanol leaf extract of C. gigantea exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects (P â¤ 0.001).

Two perennial herbs of this category of invasive plants, Rudbeckia laciniata and Solidago gigantea (Asteraceae), were thus tested in a pot experiment to determine whether AMF influence their growth, the concentration of phosphorus in biomass, and photosynthesis. The following treatments, including three common AMF species, were prepared on soils representative of two habitats that are frequently invaded by both plants, namely fallow and river valley: (1) control-soil without AMF, (2) Rhizophagus irregularis, (3) Funneliformis mosseae, and (4) Claroideoglomus claroideum. The invaders were strongly dependent on AMF for their growth. The mycorrhizal dependency of R. laciniata was 88 and 63Â % and of S. gigantea 90 and 82Â % for valley and fallow soils, respectively. The fungi also increased P concentration in their biomass. However, we found different effects of the fungal species in the stimulation of plant growth and P acquisition, with R. irregularis and C. claroideum being the most and least effective symbionts, respectively. None of AMF species had an impact on the photosynthetic performance indexes of both plants. Our findings indicate that AMF have a direct effect on the early stages of R. laciniata and S. gigantea growth. The magnitude of the response of both plant species to AMF was dependent on the fungal and soil identities. Therefore, the presence of particular AMF species in a site may determine the success of their invasion.\n\nMorphology, surface temperatures, and northern limits of columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNobel, P.S.\n\n1980-02-01\n\nInterspecific morphological differences and intraspecific morphological changes with latitude were evaluated to help examine the distributional ranges of Carnegiea gigantea, Lemaireocereus thurberi, Lophocereus schottii, Pachycereus pecten-aboriginum, and P. pringlei in the Sonoran Desert (US and Mexico). A computer model, which predicted the average surface temperature of the stem within 1/sup 0/C of that measured hourly throughout a 24-h period, was particularly useful in studying the thermal relations of the stem apex, where the lowest surface temperature occurred. Simulated increases in stem diameter raised the minimum apical temperature for C. gigantea and may help account for the extension of its rangemoreÂ Â» to higher latitudes than the other species studied. However, diameter increases led to a slight decrease in minimum apical temperatures for Lophocereus schottii. The immature stems of L. schottii are morphologically distinct from the mature stems, which caused minimum apical temperatures to be 1.6/sup 0/C lower for the immature stems under given environmental conditions; thus, freezing damage to the immature stems could limit the northward extension of the range of this species. As the apical pubescence in the simulations was increased up to the normal amount (10 mm), the minimum apical temperature for the stem of C. gigantea increased 2.4/sup 0/C. Simulated increases in spine shading of the apexalso raised the minimum apical temperatures, again indicating the influence of morphological features on the temperature of the meristematic region.Â«Â less\n\nErgot Alkaloid Biosynthesis in the Maize (Zea mays) Ergot Fungus Claviceps gigantea.\n\nPubMed\n\nBragg, Paige E; Maust, Matthew D; Panaccione, Daniel G\n\n2017-12-13\n\nBiosynthesis of the dihydrogenated forms of ergot alkaloids is of interest because many of the ergot alkaloids used as pharmaceuticals may be derived from dihydrolysergic acid (DHLA) or its precursor dihydrolysergol. The maize (Zea mays) ergot pathogen Claviceps gigantea has been reported to produce dihydrolysergol, a hydroxylated derivative of the common ergot alkaloid festuclavine. We hypothesized expression of C. gigantea cloA in a festuclavine-accumulating mutant of the fungus Neosartorya fumigata would yield dihydrolysergol because the P450 monooxygenase CloA from other fungi performs similar oxidation reactions. We engineered such a strain, and high performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated the modified strain produced DHLA, the fully oxidized product of dihydrolysergol. Accumulation of high concentrations of DHLA in field-collected C. gigantea sclerotia and discovery of a mutation in the gene lpsA, downstream from DHLA formation, supported our finding that DHLA rather than dihydrolysergol is the end product of the C. gigantea pathway.\n\nAnalysis of the Phlebiopsis gigantea Genome, Transcriptome and Secretome Provides Insight into Its Pioneer Colonization Strategies of Wood\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nHori, Chiaki; Ishida, Takuya; Igarashi, Kiyohiko; ...\n\n2014-12-04\n\nCollectively classified as white-rot fungi, certain basidiomycetes efficiently degrade the major structural polymers of wood cell walls.

Brazil has a rich biodiversity of plant species, including those reported as being endemic. Among the endemic Brazilian plant species, Vellozia gigantea (Velloziaceae) is threatened by extinction and is a promising target to recover endophytic fungi. The present study focused on bioprospecting of bioactive compounds of the endophytic fungi associated with V. gigantea, an endemic, ancient, and endangered plant species that occurs only in the rupestrian grasslands of Brazil. The capability of 285 fungal isolates to produce antimicrobial and antimalarial activities was examined. Fungi were grown at solid-state fermentation to recover their crude extracts in dichloromethane. Bioactive extracts were analysed by chromatographic fractionation and NMR and displayed compounds with antimicrobial, antimycobacterial, and antimalarial activities. Five fungi produced antimicrobial and antimalarial compounds. Extracts of Diaporthe miriciae showed antifungal, antibacterial, and antimalarial activities; Trichoderma effusum displayed selective antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium intracellulare; and three Penicillium species showed antibacterial activity. D. miriciae extract contained highly functionalised secondary metabolites, yielding the compound epoxycytochalasin H with high antimalarial activity against the chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum, with an IC50 approximately 3.5-fold lower than that with chloroquine. Our results indicate that V. gigantea may represent a microhabitat repository hotspot of potential fungi producers of bioactive compounds and suggest that endophytic fungal communities might be an important biological component contributing to the fitness of the plants living in the rupestrian grassland.\n\nKinetic studies of amylase and biomass production by Calvatia gigantea\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKekos, D.; Macris, B.J.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nProduction of alpha-amylase (alpha-4, glucan 4-glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.1) by microorganisms has been practiced for many years in small and large scale operations and the literature on this enzyme is voluminous.

The antibacterial activity was higher in MA2 against all selected pathogenic bacteria. Selected phenolics were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet-visible detection. Gallic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, p-hydroxy benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, and rutin contents (micrograms per gram dry weight) were quantified. Quercetin and rutin were absent in both strains of M. gigantea. M. gigantea MA2 showed relatively higher phenolic content (915.8 Î¼g/g dry weight) than M. gigantea MA1 (854.4 Î¼g/g dry weight). Among the phenolics, gallic acid is found in the largest amount; in M. gigantea MA2, it was 847.9 Â± 2.67 Î¼g/g dry weight. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed the presence of bioactive compounds in both strains; most compounds were antibacterial.

Tolerance, the ability of a plant to regrow or reproduce after being consumed, has been studied less than resistance, but this trait varies widely among species and has considerable potential to affect the ecology of plant species. One particular aspect of tolerance, compensatory responses, can evolve rapidly in plant species; providing insight into interactions between consumers and plants. However, compensation by invasive species has rarely been explored. We compared compensatory responses to the effects of simulated herbivory expressed by plants from seven Solidago gigantea populations from the native North American range to that expressed by plants from nine populations from the nonnative European range. Populations were also collected along elevational gradients to compare ecotypic variation within and between ranges. Solidago plants from the nonnative range of Europe were more tolerant to herbivory than plants from the native range of North America. Furthermore, plants from European populations increased in total biomass and growth rate with elevation, but decreased in compensatory response. There were no relationships between elevation and growth or compensation for North American populations. Our results suggest that Solidago gigantea may have evolved to better compensate for herbivory damage in Europe, perhaps in response to a shift to greater proportion of attack from generalists. Our results also suggest a possible trade-off between rapid growth and compensation to damage in European populations but not in North American populations.

Tocopherols predominate in photosynthetic tissues (Î±-tocopherol being the major form), while either tocopherols or tocotrienols (or both) are present in seeds. Tocotrienols have not been described in photosynthetic tissues thus far. Here, we report on the presence of tocotrienols in leaves of higher plants. Both tocopherols and tocotrienols accumulated in leaves of Vellozia gigantea, an endemic plant found in the rupestrian fields of Serra do CipÃ³, Brazil. Increased plant size had a remarkable effect on the vitamin E composition of leaves, Î±-tocopherol and Î²-tocotrienol levels being highest in the largest individuals, but only during the dry season. Vitamin E levels positively correlated with lipid hydroxyperoxide levels, which also increased in the largest individuals during the dry season. However, the maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (F v/F m ratio) kept above 0.75 throughout the experiment, thus indicating absence of photoinhibitory damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. It is concluded that higher plants, such as V. gigantea, can accumulate tocotrienols in leaves, aside from tocopherols, and that the levels of both tocopherols and tocotrienols in the leaves of this species are strongly modulated by seasonal and plant size effects.\n\nOccurrence and impact of the root-rot biocontrol agent Phlebiopsis gigantea on soil fungal communities in Picea abies forests of northern Europe.\n\nPubMed\n\nMenkis, Audrius; BurokienÄ, Daiva; Gaitnieks, Talis; Uotila, Antti; Johannesson, Hanna; Rosling, Anna; Finlay, Roger D; Stenlid, Jan; Vasaitis, Rimvydas\n\n2012-08-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess belowground occurrence, persistence and possible impact of the biocontrol agent Phlebiopsis gigantea (Fr.) JÃ¼lich on soil fungi. Sampling of soil and roots of Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. was carried out at 12 P. gigantea-treated and five nontreated control sites representing 1- to 60-month-old clear-cuts and thinned forest sites in Finland and Latvia. The 454-sequencing of ITS rRNA from fine roots, humus and mineral soil resulted in 8626 high-quality fungal sequences. Phlebiopsis gigantea represented 1.3% of all fungal sequences and was found in 14 treated and nontreated sites and in all three substrates. In different substrates, the relative abundance of P. gigantea at stump treatment sites either did not differ significantly or was significantly lower than in nontreated controls. No significant correlation was found between the time elapsed since the tree harvesting and/or application of the biocontrol and abundance of P. gigantea in different substrates. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that P. gigantea occasionally occurs belowground in forest ecosystems but that stump treatment with the biocontrol agent has little or no impact on occurrence and persistence of P. gigantea belowground, and consequently no significant impact on soil fungi.

No distinct functional groups or structural characteristics could be correlated to activity. However, in all three bioassays, the eremophilanes with the higher oxidation states were generally less active.

For example, in social bees and mammals, the composition is relatively constant within species and is dominated by specialist bacteria that do not live elsewhere; in laboratory studies and field surveys of Drosophila melanogaster, however, gut communities consist of bacteria that are ingested with food and that vary widely among individuals and localities. We addressed whether an ecological specialist in its natural habitat has a microbiota dominated by gut specialists or by environmental bacteria. Drosophila nigrospiracula is a species that is endemic to the Sonoran Desert and is restricted to decaying tissues of two giant columnar cacti, Pachycereus pringlei (cardÃ³n cactus) and Carnegiea gigantea (saguaro cactus). We found that the D. nigrospiracula microbiota differs strikingly from that of the cactus tissue on which the flies feed. The most abundant bacteria in the flies are rare or completely absent in the cactus tissue and are consistently abundant in flies from different cacti and localities. Several of these fly-associated bacterial groups, such as the bacterial order Orbales and the genera Serpens and Dysgonomonas, have been identified in prior surveys of insects from the orders Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera, including several Drosophila species. Although the functions of these bacterial groups are mostly unexplored, Orbales species studied in bees are known to break down plant polysaccharides and use the resulting sugars. Thus, these bacterial groups appear to be specialized to the insect gut environment, where they may colonize through direct host-to-host transmission in natural settings. IMPORTANCE Flies in the genus Drosophila have become laboratory models for microbiota research, yet the bacteria commonly used in these experiments are rarely found in wild-caught flies and instead represent bacteria also present in\n\nProteomic analysis of muscle between hybrid abalone and parental lines Haliotis gigantea Reeve and Haliotis discus hannai Ino\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDi, G; Luo, X; You, W; Zhao, J; Kong, X; Ke, C\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo understand the potential molecular mechanism of heterosis, protein expression patterns were compared from hybrids of Haliotis gigantea (G) and Haliotis discus hannai (D) using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight analyses. Expression differences were observed in muscle samples from the four groups with 673Â±21.0 stained spots for H. discus hannai â Ã H. discus hannai â (DD), 692Â±25.6 for H. gigantea â Ã H. gigantea â (GG), 679Â±16.2 for H. discus hannai â Ã H. gigantea â (DG) (F1 hybrid) and 700Â±19 for H. gigantea â Ã H. discus hannai â (GD) (F1 hybrid). Different 2-DE image muscle protein spots had a mirrored relationship between purebreds and the F1 hybrid, suggesting that all stained spots in F1 hybrid muscle were on 2-DEs from parents. DD and DG clustered together first, and then clustered with GD, whereas the distance of DD and GG was maximal according to hierarchical cluster analysis. We identified 136 differentially expressed protein spots involved in major biological processes, including energy metabolism and stress response. Most energy metabolism proteins were additive, and stress-induced proteins displayed additivity or over-dominance. In these 136 identified protein spots, hybrid offspring with additivity or over-dominance accounted for 68.38%. Data show that a proteomic approach can provide functional prediction of abalone interspecific hybridization.

The dominant vegetative cover was formed by two grasses: Agrostis gigantea Roth. and Agrostis scabra Willd. Testing of 10 clones of A. gigantea from the roast bed and an adjoining area for copper tolerance showed that two clones collected from the roast bed were tolerant to increased copper levels. Copper tolerance was found in clones growing on soils with high copper contents and low pHs. The combination of high copper content and low pH brought about a high level of extractable copper within the soil. Soils withmoreÂ Â» equally high copper levels but higher pHs and therefore low extractable-copper levels did not support copper-tolerant clones.Â«Â less\n\nImaia, a new truffle genus to accommodate TerJezia gigantea\n\nTreesearch\n\nGabor M.

The main metabolite was identified by spectroscopic methods and optical properties as ophiobolin A (1), a well-known phytotoxic sesterterpene produced by several phytopathogenic fungi of important crops and already extensively studied for its interesting biological activities. The other three minor metabolites proved to be related to ophiobolin A and were identified using the same techniques as 6-epi-ophiobolin A and 3-anhydro-6-epi-ophiobolin A (2 and 3) and ophiobolin I (4). Assayed on punctured detached leaves of several grass and dicotyledon weeds, ophiobolin A proved to be on average more phytotoxic as compared to the other related compounds. Some structural features appear to be important for the phytoxicity, such as the hydroxy group at C-3, the stereochemistry at C-6, and the aldehyde group at C-7. Furthermore, grass weeds usually proved to be more sensitive to the phytotoxins than dicotyledons, on which ophiobolin A caused the appearance of large necrosis even at the lowest concentration assayed. This is the first report about the production of ophiobolins from D. gigantea and of the proposed use as potential natural herbicides against grass weeds.\n\nAntiproliferative and phytochemical analyses of leaf extracts of ten Apocynaceae species\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWong, Siu Kuin; Lim, Yau Yan; Abdullah, Noor Rain; Nordin, Fariza Juliana\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground: The anticancer properties of Apocynaceae species are well known in barks and roots but less so in leaves. Materials and Methods: In this study, leaf extracts of 10 Apocynaceae species were assessed for antiproliferative (APF) activities using the sulforhodamine B assay. Their extracts were also analyzed for total alkaloid content (TAC), total phenolic content (TPC), and radical scavenging activity (RSA) using the Dragendorff precipitation, FolinâCiocalteu, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays, respectively. Results: Leaf extracts of Alstonia angustiloba, Calotropis gigantea, Catharanthus roseus, Nerium oleander, Plumeria obtusa, and Vallaris glabra displayed positive APF activities. Extracts of Allamanda cathartica, Cerbera odollam, Dyera costulata, and Kopsia fruticosa did not show any APF activity. Dichloromethane (DCM) extract of C. gigantea, and DCM and DCM:MeOH extracts of V. glabra showed strong APF activities against all six human cancer cell lines. Against breast cancer cells of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, DCM extracts of C. gigantea and N. oleander were stronger than or comparable to standard drugs of xanthorrhizol, curcumin, and tamoxifen. All four extracts of N. oleander were effective against MCF-7 cells. Extracts of Kopsia fruticosa had the highest TAC while those of Dyera costulata had the highest TPC and RSA. Extracts of C. gigantea and V. glabra inhibited the growth of all six cancer cell lines while all extracts of N. oleander were effective against MCF-7 cells. Conclusion: Extracts of C. gigantea, V. glabra, and N. oleander therefore showed great promise as potential candidates for anticancer drugs. The wide-spectrum APF activities of these three species are reported for the first time and their bioactive compounds warrant further investigation. PMID:21772753\n\nAssessment of antiproliferative and antiplasmodial activities of five selected Apocynaceae species\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Studies have shown that the barks and roots of some Apocynaceae species have anticancer and antimalarial properties. In this study, leaf extracts of five selected species of Apocynaceae used in traditional medicine (Alstonia angustiloba, Calotropis gigantea, Dyera costulata, Kopsia fruticosa and Vallaris glabra) were assessed for antiproliferative (APF) and antiplasmodial (APM) activities, and analysed for total alkaloid content (TAC), total phenolic content (TPC) and radical-scavenging activity (RSA). As V. glabra leaf extracts showed wide spectrum APF and APM activities, they were further screened for saponins, tannins, cardenolides and terpenoids. Methods APF and APM activities were assessed using the sulphorhodamine B and lactate dehydrogenase assays, respectively. TAC, TPC and RSA were analysed using Dragendorff precipitation, Folin-Ciocalteu and DPPH assays, respectively. Screening for saponins, tannins, cardenolides and terpenoids were conducted using the frothing, ferric chloride, Kedde and vanillin-H2SO4 tests, respectively. Results Leaf extracts of A. angustiloba, C. gigantea and V. glabra displayed positive APF activity. Dichloromethane (DCM) extract of C. gigantea, and DCM and DCM:MeOH extracts of V. glabra showed strong APF activity against all six human cancer cell lines tested. DCM extract of A. angustiloba was effective against three cancer cell lines. Against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, DCM extract of C. gigantea was stronger than standard drugs of xanthorrhizol, curcumin and tamoxifen. All five species were effective against K1 strain of Plasmodium falciparum and three species (C. gigantea, D. costulata and K. fruticosa) were effective against 3D7 strain. Against K1 strain, all four extracts of V. glabra displayed effective APM activity. Extracts of D. costulata were effective against 3D7 strain. Selectivity index values of extracts of A. angustiloba, C. gigantea and V. glabra suggested that they are potentially safe for use to\n\nA Distinctive and Host-Restricted Gut Microbiota in Populations of a Cactophilic Drosophila Species.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartinson, Vincent G; Carpinteyro-Ponce, Javier; Moran, Nancy A; Markow, Therese A\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAlmost all animals possess gut microbial communities, but the nature of these communities varies immensely. For example, in social bees and mammals, the composition is relatively constant within species and is dominated by specialist bacteria that do not live elsewhere; in laboratory studies and field surveys of Drosophila melanogaster , however, gut communities consist of bacteria that are ingested with food and that vary widely among individuals and localities. We addressed whether an ecological specialist in its natural habitat has a microbiota dominated by gut specialists or by environmental bacteria. Drosophila nigrospiracula is a species that is endemic to the Sonoran Desert and is restricted to decaying tissues of two giant columnar cacti, Pachycereus pringlei (cardÃ³n cactus) and Carnegiea gigantea (saguaro cactus). We found that the D. nigrospiracula microbiota differs strikingly from that of the cactus tissue on which the flies feed. The most abundant bacteria in the flies are rare or completely absent in the cactus tissue and are consistently abundant in flies from different cacti and localities. Several of these fly-associated bacterial groups, such as the bacterial order Orbales and the genera Serpens and Dysgonomonas , have been identified in prior surveys of insects from the orders Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera, including several Drosophila species. Although the functions of these bacterial groups are mostly unexplored, Orbales species studied in bees are known to break down plant polysaccharides and use the resulting sugars. Thus, these bacterial groups appear to be specialized to the insect gut environment, where they may colonize through direct host-to-host transmission in natural settings.

Most growth parameters were enhanced significantly by high CO{sub 2} in both species, but there were no significant differences in the allometric relationships between plant parts except for allocation to rhizomes. Unlike allocation to other plant organs, rhizome growth was directly affected by elevated CO{sub 2}. In a high CO{sub 2}, S. canadensis, whichmoreÂ Â» has short rhizomes, allocated more biomass to new rhizomes, and produced longer new rhizomes, while S. gigantea, which has longer rhizomes, produced shorter and more branched rhizomes, forming a more aggregated clone. If global change will lead to expansion of clonal perennials when trees die, S. canadensis may expand faster than S. gigantea.Â«Â less\n\nHost Plant Adaptation in Drosophila mettleri Populations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCastrezana, Sergio; Bono, Jeremy M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe process of local adaptation creates diversity among allopatric populations, and may eventually lead to speciation. Plant-feeding insect populations that specialize on different host species provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate the causes of ecological specialization and the subsequent consequences for diversity. In this study, we used geographically separated Drosophila mettleri populations that specialize on different host cacti to examine oviposition preference for and larval performance on an array of natural and non-natural hosts (eight total). We found evidence of local adaptation in performance on saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) for populations that are typically associated with this host, and to chemically divergent prickly pear species (Opuntia spp.) in a genetically isolated population on Santa Catalina Island. Moreover, each population exhibited reduced performance on the alternative host. This finding is consistent with trade-offs associated with adaptation to these chemically divergent hosts, although we also discuss alternative explanations for this pattern. For oviposition preference, Santa Catalina Island flies were more likely to oviposit on some prickly pear species, but all populations readily laid eggs on saguaro. Experiments with non-natural hosts suggest that factors such as ecological opportunity may play a more important role than host plant chemistry in explaining the lack of natural associations with some hosts.

Natural polymers are the most important materials used in food packaging, micro/nano-drug delivery, tissue engineering, agriculture, and coating. In the present study, natural compounds extracted from plant Lax were designed to function as drug carriers using various surfactants via emulation and solvent evaporation method. Calotropis gigantea belongs to the family Apocynaceae and has received considerable attention in modern medicine, ayurvedeic, siddha, and traditional medicine. Since, we were isolated biodegradable, non-toxic, and biocompatible materials as latex from Calotropis gigantea plant. The Lax was separated as per their solubility nature and it was designed as a carrier using surfactant namely; Sorbitanmonolaurate (Span-20), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The isolated compounds from Lax of Calotropis gigantea were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. To confirm the encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release of the carriers, doxorubicin (DOX) was used as a model natural drug. The hybrid nanocarriers were successfully synthesized through simple solvent evaporation using three surfactants, and the morphology was characterized by SEM and TEM technique. The functionality and crystalline nature of the nanocarriers were confirmed using FTIR and XRD, respectively. Within 90min, the maximum amount of DOX was encapsulated in the carriers, and prolonged cumulative drug release by the nanocarriers was observed. The formulated natural carriers were found to have potentially effective cytotoxic effects on lung cancer cells. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

For Pereskia aculeata, Pereskia grandifolia, and Maihuenia poeppigii (subfamily Pereskioideae), all the net shoot CO2 uptake was by the leaves and during the daytime. In contrast, for the leafless species Carnegiea gigantea, Ferocactus acanthodes, Coryphantha vivipara, and Mammillaria dioica (subfamily Cactoideae), all the shoot net CO2 uptake was by the stems and at night. Similarly, for leafless Opuntia ficus-indica (subfamily Opuntioideae), all net CO2 uptake occurred at night. For leafy members of the Opuntioideae (Pereskiopsis porteri, Quiabentia chacoensis, Austrocylindropuntia subulata), at least 88% of the shoot CO2 uptake over 24 hours was by the leaves and some CO2 uptake occurred at night. Leaves responded to the instantaneous level of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) during the daytime, as occurs for C3 plants, whereas nocturnal CO2 uptake by stems of O. ficus-indica and F. acanthodes responded to the total daily PAR, as occurs for Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants. Thus, under the well-watered conditions employed, the Pereskioideae behaved as C3 plants, the Cactoideae behaved as CAM plants, and the Opuntioideae exhibited characteristics of both pathways.

To evaluate support for this phylogenetic hypothesis at the molecular level, we sequenced the genomes of four cacti in the especially problematic tribe Pachycereeae, which contains most of the large columnar cacti of Mexico and adjacent areas, including the iconic saguaro cactus ( Carnegiea gigantea ) of the Sonoran Desert. We assembled a high-coverage draft genome for saguaro and lower coverage genomes for three other genera of tribe Pachycereeae ( Pachycereus , Lophocereus , and Stenocereus ) and a more distant outgroup cactus, Pereskia We used these to construct 4,436 orthologous gene alignments. Species tree inference consistently returned the same phylogeny, but gene tree discordance was high: 37% of gene trees having at least 90% bootstrap support conflicted with the species tree. Evidently, discordance is a product of long generation times and moderately large effective population sizes, leading to extensive incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). In the best supported gene trees, 58% of apparent homoplasy at amino sites in the species tree is due to gene tree-species tree discordance rather than parallel substitutions in the gene trees themselves, a phenomenon termed \"hemiplasy.\" The high rate of genomic hemiplasy may contribute to apparent parallelisms in phenotypic traits, which could confound understanding of species relationships and character evolution in cacti.

The bark of M. denticulata showed the highest total phenolic content (2682âmg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100âg) and free radical scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.063âmg/mL). All of the samples inhibited linoleic acid peroxidation by greater than 80%, with the leaves of M. gigantea exhibiting the highest inhibition of 92.21%. Most of the samples exhibited significant antioxidant potential. The bark of M. denticulata and the leaves of both M. pruinosa and M. gigantea exhibited greater than 50% tyrosinase inhibition, with the bark of M. denticulata having the highest percentage of inhibition (68.7%). The bark and leaves of M. denticulata exhibited greater than 50% inhibition (73.82% and 54.50%, resp.) of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE), while none of the samples showed any significant inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Only the bark of M. denticulata and M. gigantea displayed greater than 50% inhibition of nitric oxide production in cells (81.79% and 56.51%, resp.). These bioactivities indicate that some Macaranga spp. have therapeutic potential in medicinal research.\n\nEffect of anhydrosophoradiol-3-acetate of Calotropis gigantea (Linn.) flower as antitumoric agent against Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nHabib, Muhammad R; Karim, Muhammad R\n\n2013-01-01\n\nOver 60% of currently used anti-cancer agents are derived in one-way or another from natural sources, including plants, marine organisms and microorganisms. Calotropis gigantea (Linn.) (Family: Asclepiadaceae) is a perennial shrub and it is used as a traditional folk medicine for the treatment of various health complications. But there is no report on isolation of anticancerous chemicals from the flower of Calotropis gigantea. The objective of the present study is to explore the antitumor effect of anhydrosophoradiol-3-acetate (A3A), isolated from the flower of Calotropis gigantea (Linn.) against Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC) in Swiss albino mice. Antitumoric effect of A3A was assessed by evaluating viable tumor cell count, survival time, body weight gain due to tumor burden, hematological and biochemical (glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, blood urea, SALP, SGPT and SGOT) parameters of EAC bearing host at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight. Treatment with A3A decreased the viable tumor cells and body weight gain thereby increasing the life span of EAC bearing mice. A3A also brought back the altered hematological (Hb, total RBC and total WBC) and biochemical parameters more or less to normal level. Results of this study conclude that in vivo the A3A was effective in inhibiting the growth of EAC with improving in cancer induced complications.\n\nComparison of Polyphenol Profile and Antimutagenic and Antioxidant Activities in Two Species Used as Source of Solidaginis herba - Goldenrod.\n\nPubMed\n\nWoÅºniak, Dorota; Ålusarczyk, Sylwester; Domaradzki, Krzysztof; DryÅ, Andrzej; Matkowski, Adam\n\n2018-04-01\n\nEuropean Pharmacopoeia accepts two equivalent species Solidago canadensis L. and S.Â gigantea Aiton as goldenrod (Solidaginis herba). We compared phytochemical profile of both species from invasive populations in Poland. Further, we compared inÂ vitro antimutagenic and antioxidant activities of solvent extracts from aerial (AP) and underground parts (UP). In S.Â gigantea, flavonoid profile was dominated by quercetin glycosides, with quercitrin as the major compound. In S.Â canadensis, quercetin and kaempferol rutinosides were two major constituents. Caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) were less diverse with 5-CQA as a main compound. In UP, over 20 putative diterpenoids were detected, mostly unidentified. Several CQAs were present in higher amounts than in AP. Antioxidant and antimutagenic activities were different between species and organs, with the strongest inhibition of lipid peroxidation by Et 2 O and AcOEt fractions from AP of both species (IC 50 13.33Â -Â 16.89Â Î¼g/mL) and BuOH fraction from S.Â gigantea UP (IC 50 Â =Â 13.32Â Î¼g/mL). Chemical mutagenesis was completely inhibited by non-polar fractions, but oxidative mutagenesis was inhibited up to 35% only by S.Â canadensis. No clear relationship was found between chemical profiles and antimutagenic activity. In conclusion, both species have diverse activity and their phytochemical profiles should be considered in quality evaluation. UP of these weeds can also provide potential chemopreventive substances for further studies.

Kinetics, equilibrium and photophysical considerations.\n\nPubMed\n\nIriel, Analia; Lagorio, M Gabriela; FernÃ¡ndez Cirelli, Alicia\n\n2015-11-01\n\nArsenic (V) uptake from groundwater by using Vallisneria gigantea plants was studied using batch experiments. Reflectance and fluorescence of intact plants were investigated and changes in photophysical properties following arsenic absorption were reported. Good correlations have been found between arsenic concentration in groundwater and parameters derived from reflectance and fluorescence measurements. This system reached its equilibrium after seven days when the removal quantities were strongly dependent on the initial arsenic concentration. Interestingly, Vallisneria plants were able to accumulate from 100 to 600 mg As kg(-1) in roots and fronds although the translocation factors were low (0.6-1.6). Kinetic data for biosorption process followed a first-order law. At low arsenic concentrations the uptake in plants was governed by diffusion aspects. Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich models were applied and results demonstrated that arsenic uptake was better described by the Langmuir model. As a final remark we concluded that a plant of this species should be able to remove 1mg As per week. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These latitudinal clines provide evidence that natural variation in circadian rhythms is adaptive, but it is still unclear what adaptive benefits this variation confers, particularly because circadian rhythms are not usually measured in day/night conditions that reflect those experienced by organisms in nature. Here, we report that daily rhythms of GIGANTEA expression respond to day length in a way that depends on the latitude of origin of Arabidopsis accessions. We additionally extend previous findings by confirming that natural variation in GI expression affects growth related traits, and alters the expression of different target genes. The results support the idea that natural variation in daily rhythms of expression have broad effects on plant development and are of potential adaptive value.\n\nClinal variation at phenology-related genes in spruce: parallel evolution in FTL2 and Gigantea?\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Jun; Tsuda, Yoshiaki; Stocks, Michael; KÃ¤llman, Thomas; Xu, Nannan; KÃ¤rkkÃ¤inen, Katri; Huotari, Tea; Semerikov, Vladimir L; Vendramin, Giovanni G; Lascoux, Martin\n\n2014-07-01\n\nParallel clines in different species, or in different geographical regions of the same species, are an important source of information on the genetic basis of local adaptation. We recently detected latitudinal clines in SNPs frequencies and gene expression of candidate genes for growth cessation in Scandinavian populations of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Here we test whether the same clines are also present in Siberian spruce (P. obovata), a close relative of Norway spruce with a different Quaternary history. We sequenced nine candidate genes and 27 control loci and genotyped 14 SSR loci in six populations of P. obovata located along the Yenisei river from latitude 56Â°N to latitude 67Â°N. In contrast to Scandinavian Norway spruce that both departs from the standard neutral model (SNM) and shows a clear population structure, Siberian spruce populations along the Yenisei do not depart from the SNM and are genetically unstructured. Nonetheless, as in Norway spruce, growth cessation is significantly clinal. Polymorphisms in photoperiodic (FTL2) and circadian clock (Gigantea, GI, PRR3) genes also show significant clinal variation and/or evidence of local selection. In GI, one of the variants is the same as in Norway spruce. Finally, a strong cline in gene expression is observed for FTL2, but not for GI. These results, together with recent physiological studies, confirm the key role played by FTL2 and circadian clock genes in the control of growth cessation in spruce species and suggest the presence of parallel adaptation in these two species.

J.\n\n2006-03-01\n\nCacti contain large quantities of Ca-oxalate biominerals, with C derived from atmospheric CO2. Their death releases these biominerals into the environment, which subsequently transform to calcite via a monohydrocalcite intermediate. Here, the fate of Ca-oxalates released by plants in arid environments is investigated. This novel and widespread form of biomineralization has unexpected consequences on C cycling and calcite accumulation in areas with large numbers of cacti. The magnitude of this mineralization is revealed by studying the large columnar cactus Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.) Britton and Rose in southwestern Arizona (locally called the saguaro). A large C. gigantea contains on the order of 1Ã105 g of the Ca-oxalate weddelliteâCaC2O4Â·2H2O. In areas with high C. gigantea density, there is an estimated 40 g Catm m-2 sequestered in Ca-oxalates. Following the death of the plant, the weddellite transforms to calcite on the order to 10-20 years. In areas with high saguaro density, there is an estimated release of up to 2.4 g calcite m-2 year-1 onto the desert soil. Similar transformation mechanisms occur with the Ca-oxalates that are abundant in the majority of cacti. Thus, the total atmospheric C returned to the soil of areas with a high number density of cacti is large, suggesting that there may be a significant long-term accumulation of atmospheric C in these soils derived from Ca-oxalate biominerals. These findings demonstrate that plant decay in arid environments may have locally significant impacts on the Ca and inorganic C cycles.\n\nDecay of cacti and carbon cycling.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarvie, Laurence A J\n\n2006-03-01\n\nCacti contain large quantities of Ca-oxalate biominerals, with C derived from atmospheric CO(2).
