Months.\n\nPOPES,\n\nPAUL IV. 27 dayes under this Reign.\n\nPIUS. IV. Elected the 26 of De∣cember 1559. S. Five Years, and eleven Months and a half.\n\n[Year of our Lord 1559] IF in a State it be a certain sign of it's decadency, the want of good Heads for Council, and good hands, (great Soldiers) for Execution: it is as certain a fore-runner and cause of troubles and Civil Wars, to have mul∣titudes of Princes and over-grown Nobility when there is not an Authority great enough to contain and keep them to their duty. This misfortune hapned to France after the death of King Henry II. as soon as he was no more, the Factions which were formed during his Reign, began to appear, and by an unluckly fate met with, to fortifie themselves, differing Parties in Religion, great numbers of Malecontents, lovers of Novelties, and which was more and worse, Soldiers of Fortune, who having been disbanded would needs get themselves some employment at what rate soever.\n\nOn one side were to be seen the Princes of the Blood and the Constable, on the other the Princes of the House of Guise; betwixt these two Parties, the Queen Mother who was bargaining to make her best Market, and sided sometime with the one, and then with the other: In the midst of all these a young King, as weak in mind as in body, exposed to the first occupier, and the prize contended for the Government of the Kingdom.\n\nAs for the Guises, they were Five Brothers, the Duke, the Cardinal de Lor∣raine, the Duke d'Aumale, the Cardinal de Guise, and the Marquess d'Elbeuf: we are not to make any reck'ning of the three last because they acted nothing but by the inspiration and motion of the other two. The Duke drew his Party to him by the Reputation of his Valour, his Liberality, and his Affability, the Cardinal de Lorraine by his Eloquence and his Learning. They were, notwith∣standing of very different humors, the Duke moderate, just, undaunted in dan∣gers, the Cardinal hot, undertaking and vain, puffed up with good success, but trembling and faint-hearted at the least frowns of Fortune.\n\nAmongst the Princes of the Blood, there was Anthony King of Navarre, Lewis Prince of Condé, the Duke of Montpensier, and the Prince de la Roche-sur-yon. Anthony was a voluptuous and fearful Prince, and more considerable for his Qua∣lity then his Power; Lewis was Valiant, Hardy, and one the greatness of whose Courage, and meanness of whose slender Fortune, made him fit to undertake eve∣ry thing. Anthony did not stand firm but abandoned his younger Brother: to his\n\ndescription Page 658\n\n[Year of our Lord 1559] very death he fluctuated in doubts of Religion, and was neither a good Catho∣lick, nor right Lutheran. His Brother followed the Opinions of Calvin.\n\nThe Guises seized upon the Kings Person, because he had Married their Niece Mary Steward Queen of Scotland, and upon the favourable pretence of the Ca∣tholick Religion; The others made sure of the Male-contents, the disbanded Soul∣diers, and the protection of the Religionaries, whose dispair was yet much greater and stronger then their numbers.\n\nThe Mareschal de Saint André, a Lord as brave as witty and polite, but very Luxurious and over-head and ears in debt, devoted himself wholly to them, and promised the Duke to bestow his Daughter upon which of his Sons he pleased, with all the Estate belonging both to him and his Wife, reserving only the clear revenue during their term of Life; This he did fearing to be devoured by his Creditors should he ever happen to be expell'd the Court.\n\nThe Constable a great temporiser, and who had wont to be prime Minister of State, could not stoop now to be Inferior. He admitted the flatteries and cares∣ses of both Parties: but at length adhered to the Guisians, in hatred to the no∣vel opinions, being perswaded by his Wife, and second Son, that the Title he bare of the first Christian Baron, would not allow him to linck himself with those who did impugne the Catholick Religion.\n\nThe Duke of Montpensier and the Prince de la Roche Sur-Yon, though both of the House of Bourbon, were led by the same motives, and did not so much respect the proximity of Blood, as the name of the Ancient Church, and the King, from whom they would not start aside for any other Consideration what∣soever.\n\nA motive directly contrary to the Constables, cast the Admiral de Coligny and his Brother Dandelot, Colonel of the French Infantry, on the side of those Prin∣ces who favour'd the new Religion, of which they were thoroughly convinced and perswaded, besides that they had the Honour to be Allied to the Prince of Condé. For he had Married Elenora de Roye, Daughter of one Magdelain de Mailly, who was their Sister by the Mothers side, she and they being Born of Louisa de Montmorency, who was first Married to Frederic du Mailly , Then to the Mareschal de Chastillon Father of these two Lords.\n\nWhen King Henry II. received his hurt, the Queen Mother was in suspence a day or two whether to joyn with the Constable or the Guises. She looked upon both the one and the other as her Enemies, being all Allied to the Dutchess of Valentinois, whom she hated mortally, though in her Husbands Life-time she feigned to love her even to the height of confidence. But she thought her self much more affronted by the Constable, then the Guises, because it was he that had last adventur'd to contract an Alliance with that Woman, Besides the Guises utterly abandoned her, notwithstanding the repugnance of the Duke d'Aumale who was her Son in Law: and withal they promised this Queen so much Service and so great Submission, that she resolved to stand by them; To which me may add that being Uncles to the young King, as they were, it might perhaps have been out of the reach of her power or interest to have set them aside.\n\nWhen the Constable perceived his Game was near lost, he sent in all post hast to the King of Navarre to press him to come and take that Place and Authority his Birth justly claimed under the young King: but that Prince who was slow and irresolute, and who withal did not much confide in him, because he had once ad∣vised the deceased King to seize upon the remainder of his petit Kingdom, did not make much hast. This signal fault, and after this his strange irresolutions, and the weakness of his Conduct during all this and the following Reign, may be accounted indirectly amongst the principal and main causes of all the Troubles and Misfortunes that befel the Kingdom of France.\n\nWherefore the Guises having gained the Mastery at Court, the King declared to the Parliaments Deputies when they came to wait on him; That he had com∣mitted the direction of his Affairs to them, that is to say, the Intendance or Over-sight of all the Affairs of War to the Duke, and that of the Finances, or Treasury to the Cardinal. Being thus establish'd, they consider'd of removing out of the way all those that might be obnoxious. They left the Constable and Mareschals of France no more Commission but to Bury the late King, and sent the Princes of Condé and de la Roche Sur-Yon into Spain, the first to carry the Coller of the Order to King Philip, the other to get the Treaty of Peace confirmed. They likewise banished the Dutchess of Valentinois from the Court: but first ob∣liged\n\ndescription Page 659\n\nher to restore and deliver up the Jewels and the rich Furniture and [Year of our Lord 1559] Goods the late King had bestowed upon her, and took away her fair House of Chenonceaux to accommodate the Queen-Mother, in exchange for the Castle of Chaumont upon the Banks of the River Loire.\n\nDesiring by embellishing the face of their new Government with a shew of Goodness and Justice towards the publick, to condemn the Government past, they took the Seals from Bertrandi Cardinal and Archbishop of Sens, whose re∣putation was not of the best, and restored them to the Chancellor Ol vier, a per∣son really of a much more then ordinary merit and of great probity: but who soon perceived they had recalled him to servitude rather then to a freedom of fun∣ction in the highest Office of the Kingdom.\n\nThe Queen-Mother in the mean time persuaded the King to discharge the Constable, and on her own score, reproach'd him for having said, That of all the Children which King Henry had, there was none resembled him but a natural Daughter of his.\n\nShe desired also that the Cardinal de Tournon night be recalled, because She would make use of his Counsel, which she thought would be the more sincere, he being engaged to neither party. The Guises agreed to it, and indeed it would have been difficult for them to hinder it, besides they believed they might be confi∣dent of him, he being a capital enemy to the Constable.\n\nThe King of Navarre crawled along by easie journeys, and made a halt at Vendosme. The Princes of Condé and de la Roche Sur-Yon went even to that place to sollicite him to come to Court. He came at length, but too late, the Guises had taken care he should be ill received, they did not assign him Lodgings suita∣ble to his Quality, he must have laid on the Floor had not the Mareschal de Saint André lent him his; and as soon as ever the King saw him, he told him he had given the administration to his Uncles de Guise.\n\nNotwithstanding all this unworthy treatment, his friends exhorted him to stand his Ground: the Guises bethought them of a Stratagem to make him quit the Spot. They read before him in full Council some Letters from the King of Spain, of whom the Queen had demanded assistance against the Factious where∣with she was threatned; The Letters imported, that in case there should be any found so audacious as to controll the Government the King had established, he offer'd his whole power to chastise them. The Navarrois easily apprehended that this might be a plausible colour and pretence for him to invade his Country of Navarre, and was councell'd to go back with all possible speed to put things in good order: but that he might leave the Court with some kind of reputation, he got the Commission to conduct the new Queen of Spain to the Frontiers.\n\nHe went not however till after the Kings Coronation. This Ceremony was performed the one and twentieth of September with great Pomp in the City of Reims, by the Ministery of the Cardinal de Lorrain who was Archbishop thereof. At their departure from thence he conducted the Queen to Navarre, being ac∣companied by the Cardinal de Bourbon and the Prince de la Roche Sur-Yon. He delivered her up to King Philips Deputies, those were the Cardinal de Burgos, and his Brother the Duke de l'Infantado; and because it was said she should be conducted into the Territories of Spain, and yet the delivery of her was at Ron∣cevaux which is within the limits of Navarre, he drew up a Protestation that it might be no prejudice to him, and that from thence they might not make it a consequence, that the Kingdom of Navarre was a Province dependant on Spain. After this the Spaniards in recompence for his pains and care, gave him fair, but empty hopes, to do him right concerning his Kingdom. He nibled at this Bait, and the Queen-Mother amused and tempted him with it as long as he li∣ved.\n\nIn the preceding Month of August, King Philip had left the Low-Countries, and was gone into Spain by Sea, where he chose his residence for all the rest of his life. His Father had tenderly cherished the Flemmings, and had most happily made use both of their Councils and Arms: but he being bred in the imperious Air of Spain, could not agree with a people that were free, and such as could prodigally expose both their lives and fortunes for their Princes service, but yet would not suffer themselves to be robbed of them. He left as Governess over them Margaret his natural Sister Wife of Octavian Duke of Parma, with whom was joyned as chief Counsellor Anthony Perenot de\n\ndescription Page 660\n\n[Year of our Lord 1559] Granvelle a Cardinal, originally a Franc-Comtois, but haughty and arrogant as a Spaniard. At his Arrival in Spain he caused a great many to be burnt in his own pre∣sence at Seville and Valladolid of those they call Lutherans, both Men and Women, Gentlemen and Ecclesiastiques, as likewise the Effigies or Fantosme of Constance Ponce Confessor to Charles V. who attended that Emperor till his death. We must not wonder that he scrupled no more the defaming of his Fathers Memory, since, if we will believe some, he would have made his process too, and have burnt his bones for the Crime of He∣resie, nothing hindring him from it, but this consideration that if his Father were an He∣retick, he had forfeited * his Estates, and by consequence had no right to resign them to his Son.\n\nSome weeks before the departure of the Navarrois, there were two Edicts made, one of them to forbid the wearing of any Fire-Arms, or even long Cloaks or large Breeches that might conceal them: The second revoked all alie∣nations of the Demeasnes. Both the one and the other were made at the desire of the Guises, the first for the security of their Persons, the second that they might prejudice or gratisie whom they pleas'd. And indeed they gained many of the great ones by this means; as they likewise made themselves many crea∣tures by the creation of Eighteen Knights of the Order of Saint Michael. Which so debased and vllified that Order, formerly preserved with great care by the Kings of France, that it was in raillery called the Coller for every Beast.\n\nWith the same design and that they might have Governments and Offices e∣nough for themselves and for their friends, they obliged the King to declare that he would suffer none hereafter to hold two at one time. The Admiral had the Government of the Isle of France and that of Picardy, he resigned the latter very chearfully, believing they would bestow it on the Prince of Condé: but the Guises disposed of it in favour of Brissac, whom they intended to bind to their own Party. The Constable endured a pulling by the Ears before he would lay down his Office of Grand Maistre of the Kings Houshold; when he perceived that after fair warning they were going to use force, he surrendred it to the King, who conferr'd it upon the Duke of Guise. All he could do was to obtain an Office of Mareschal of France, which was created extraordinary, for Francis his eldest Son.\n\nAfter the Coronation they carried the King to Bar. The Duke of Lorrain his Brother in Law being come to salute him there, he by Letters Patents renounced the Soveraignty he had of Barrois, in favour of that Prince.\n\nThe Novelty and pretence of a Reformation in an Age that so much wanted it, opened the hearts of the French to the new Religion, and on the other hand the necessity there was to pluck up this Darnel and the like Weeds; furnish'd those that governed with a fair occasion and opportunity to make themselves formida∣ble, even to the most innocent, who in such junctures, fear lest they should be look'd upon as Hereticks how little soever tainted.\n\nThe young King believed that to execute his Fathers will, was to extirpate all such as opposed the Catholick Belief: to this end he Created in each Parliament a particular Chamber, or Court, that took Cognisance of no other matter. They were named Chambres Ardentes , because in effect they burned without Mercy all such as were convicted: and there needed no other proof but the find∣ing them at some Nocturnal or Clandestine Conventicle. The President Saint André, and the Inquisitor Demochares laboured with great diligence at Paris, and sought them even in the bottom of Cellars, upon the intelligence of their Spies, amongst others a Taylor and two Goldsmiths who had been of that Reli∣gion.\n\nTwo young Men of these Mouchards, or Informers deposed, that in those mid∣night Assemblies they did eat of the Pascal Lamb, and Roasted Pigg, and afterwards put out the Lights, and mingled in an unclean manner with those they first hap∣ned to meet, nay one of them affirmed that upon the like occasion it fell to his lot to encounter an Advocates Daughter of the Place Maubert, at whose House they held such communion. This calumny was spread abroad by the populace, told in the Louvre, and brought to the Ears of the King and Queen, and though\n\ndescription Page 661\n\nthese Witnesses had been convict of falsehood by the Chancellor, that did not [Year of our Lord 1559] hinder it from making some impression on the Queen.\n\nThus the Religionaries being pursued and punished every where, especially in the great Cities, as Aix in Provence, Toulouze, Poitiers, and Bourges, began to think how to defend themselves. They first made use of the Pen, and scatter'd about se∣veral Libels which tended to make out, that Kings ought not to be accounted Majors sooner then other Men; That in the mean time it belonged to the Estates to assign them a Council; and that the Princes of the Blood ought to have the first place and rank; that the Laws of the Land did not admit either of Women, or Strangers; That the Guises were not natural French Men; That besides they had pretensions upon Anjou and Provence, and even to the whole Kingdom, say∣ing they were descended from Charlemain; That therefore the trusting them with the Government was to hazard the whole State. They added many rea∣sons and examples, to prove the administration of Cardinals had ever been very prejudicial to France; That Francis I. though he made use of them, yet ne∣ver admitted them into the Council when it concerned the Affairs of Rome; and that experience had fully enough demonstrated that the Venetian Polity, which excluded all Ecclesiastiques from the management of Affairs, was very wise, and very prosperous.\n\nThese Books wanted not forr eplies. Du Tillet one of the Registers in Par∣liament made one, which at that time was torn to pieces and silenced by the multiplicity of smart answers: but in another Season had the fortune to be revi∣ved and brought in credit by the Chancellor de l'Hospital, and cry'd up as it had been a Law of the Land.\n\nThey then were labouring in good earnest for the Execution of the Articles of Peace. The Mareschal de Brissac with much regret gave up the City of Va∣lence, and those in Piedmont. Those that held Thionville and the places of Luxem∣burgh, went out with curses in their Mouths against those Ministers that made that Treaty; nor could any heart be so hardned as not to be touched at the la∣mentations and sad cryes wherewith the Corses and Siennois endeavoured to move Heaven and Earth to compassion, when they had notice the French abandoned them to their severe Masters. The Siennois made the last attempt their dispairing impotency could prompt them to, for the defence of their liberty: but in a short time, they fell under the weight of the Spanish Forces, who to compleat the mea∣sure of their misery, delivered them over to the Duke of Florence, reserving however the maritime Towns.\n\nThere were at Court great numbers of persons of every Province, especially Martial Men, who demanded either their pay, or some reward. The Cardinal de Lorrain who had the management of the Treasury, was mightily importun'd and pester'd with them, and moreover he apprehended some Conspiracy amidst the multitude. Wherefore he caused an Edict to be published which commanded all such as followed the King and Court only to solicite and begg some thing of him, they should forbear and withdraw, upon pain of being truss'd up on a Gibbet, which for that very purpose was set up in the publick place. This rude treatment turned great numbers of those against him, that had formerly served in the Armies.\n\nA Quartan Ague tormented the King for some Months, which made him un∣capable of applying himself to business, besides that he was naturally very weak. When he came to be cured, many pustules appeared on his livid Face, which signified some internal indisposition. He was therefore carried to Blois for change of Air; whilst he staid there, some in that Country, by whomsover employed, sought for young Infants that they might have their Blood, as they gave out to make the King a Bath. For which reason many will needs have it that he was infected with Naaman's Disease.\n\nIn the mean time they zealously prosecuted all such as were imprison'd for the matters of Religion. They began with the Counsellors of the Parliament of Paris formerly mentioned. Anne du Bourg having fenced a long time for his life by several Appeals, to the Metropolitan of Sens, then to the Primate of Lyons, for he was an Ecclesiastick and a Priest, in the end threw aside his Mask and bold∣ly declared that he professed a Belief contrary to that of the Roman Church. The Zealots of his opinion had push'd him on to this resolution. They imagined that being a man of eminent condition, of rare merit, and great vertue, at least, as to his Morals, his example would take a marvellous impression, and for\n\ndescription Page 662\n\n[Year of our Lord 1559] those reasons the Parliament would never expose him to the infamy of Execution. But they deceived themselves: the heat of those that had taken this business in hand, made them go thorough with it; and there hapned an Accident besides which hastned his ruine. He had excepted against the President Saint André, and find∣ing notwithstanding he still appeared, he threatned him that God would restrain and compel him to keep away. Now some days after, it so fell out, that this President going from the Palace, was assassinated and shot with a Pistol, and it was currently reported the first President was in danger of the like. The Au∣thors of this Murther could never be discovered, tho Robert Stuart being vehe∣mently suspected, was put in Prison.\n\nThis incident exasperated those that Governed in such sort, that Du Bourg was condemned to death, and after he had been degraded of his holy Orders, was burnt in the Greve, they having first strangled him. He went to his death with so much joy and so great shew of piety, that his Execution was so far from striking any terrour, it begot compassion in every one, and inspired many with this perswasion, that the Belief so good and so understanding a man professed, could not possibly be bad. The other Counsellors Eustace de la Porte, Paul de Foix and Lewis de Faur, were severally condemned to retract, and suspended from their employments for some time: but the heat of these prosecutions being over, the Parliament restored them. Anthony Fumee alone was fully and wholly absolved.\n\nAs for the other Prisoners which were in great numbers, the reiterated com∣mands from Court, heightning the severity of the Judges, they soon emptied all the Goals. They were all sent to death or banishment. As for Rohert Stuard, being able to find no favour, or yet the least recommendation in his behalf from the young Queen, who disowned any thing of Kindred or Relation to him, he endured the greatest torments of the Rack without confession, and by that means was cleered.\n\nAbout these times the ordinary and mean people of their own heads, or by the suggestions of some Zealots, bethought themselves of setting up Images at all the corners of the Streets, especially that of our Lady; they adorned them, lighted Wax Tapers before them, and met together in Crowds singing the Litany and other Prayers. And if any one passed by without saluting them and staying there, or if they forgot to put something into the Box, he was taken for a Lu∣theran, and beaten and dragged in the Myre, nay sometimes to a Prison. The wiser Churchmen, who consider'd that those sacred Rites and that worship was not to be used in such undecent places, nor by people of that sort, took away as∣many of those Images as they could and placed them in their Churches.\n\nMargaret de Lorrain Mother of Queen Mary Stuard, Governed the King∣dom of Scotland for her Daughter, assisted by Henry Clutin-Loysel who was sent thither from France. She being disturbed by the Religionaries, of whom James (a Bastard of the Kings) Earl of Murray was head, they dispatched to her a sup∣ply of Three Thousand Men commanded by la Brosse a Bourbonnois. Loysel was recalled and in his place they sent Nicholas de Pelve Bishop of Amiens, with whom they joyned some Doctors of the Sorbon, to endeavour to reclaim those that were gone astray either by instruction and perswasion or else by compulsion.\n\nThese Forces had orders when they should have subdued the Rebels, to March directly into England and conquer that with the assistance of the Catholicks, for the benefit of Queen Mary who pretended she was Heiress thereof, and had already taken the Arms into her own Coat. Elizabeth having information of it, perhaps by the Admirals means, furnished the Rebels with Twelve Hundred Men, and those together in one Body besieged the Port of Lieth, within half a League of Edinborough. La Brosse and Sebastian de Luxemburg Martigues put themselves in∣to the place to defend it. There were gallant feats of Arms acted by either par∣ty, during this Siege. At last both sides being tyred with the War, made up a Peace. In which it was agreed, that all their differences and disputes should be judged and determined by the general Estates of the Country, and that the King of France and the Queen his Wife should quit both the Arms and the Title of Kings of England.\n\nPope Paul V. who longed for nothing so much as to establish the Inquisition over all Christendom, made his Exit out of this World eight days after King Henry II. The Roman People, in hatred for his having put that Yoak upon their necks, broke his Sta∣tues,\n\ndescription Page 665\n\nand pull'd down his Arms in all places where they could come at them. The in∣trigues [Year of our Lord 1559] of Vargas Ambassador from Spain, and the Caraffa's together kept the See va∣cant for above three Months: at the end whereof was Elected the Cardinal de Mede∣quin, Brother to the Marquiss de Marignan, by the ways and methods usual in their Conclaves. Of whom it may truly be said, that he added the greatest lustre to the sa∣cred purple it ever had, by bringing his Nephew the great Saint Charles Boromeus into the number of Cardinals.\n\n[Year of our Lord 1560] The Year 1560. began happily enough by a very wholsome Edict, ordaining in all Soveraign Companies and all inferiour Courts of Justice, that when any places were vacant, they should present three persons to the King such as were without reproach, and men thoroughly versed in the knowledge of the Law, of whom he was to chuse the party he best liked. But the importunity of Court flies, who ever stick close to what is most corrupted, and indeed live by it, would not allow so holy an Ordonnance should take place. Thus though justice in it self be a most divine and most necessary thing to all Societies, yet since the num∣ber of the wicked and such as are self-interessed will be eternally the greater, such endeavours for setling good and wholesome methods may always be praise∣worthy, [☜] but will ever prove ineffectual.\n\nAlthough the Prince of Condé, the Admiral and Dandelot his Brother were no∣toriously imbued, and tainted with the Novel Opinions, and favoured to the ut∣most of their power those that did profess them, they had not as yet dared to declare themselves their Chiefs. In the end those miserable people being prose∣cuted with all extremity united together, to extinquish those flames that were kindled to consume them: but they did not restrain themselves to the defensive only, their dispair carried them far beyond those bounds and limits.\n\nA Gentleman of Angoumois by name George Bary la Renaudie, one who had been formerly condemned for some Crime, was entrusted by the Principals to go to all the Churches of those pretended Reformed People, and perswade them to send their Deputies to Nantes about the time when the Parliament of Rennes was to be transferr'd thither. He acquitted himself so well, that there came to him at the day appointed to the number of above one hundred and fifty.\n\nWhen they had heard his harangue, and weighed the opinions of several Di∣vines of their Belief, who affirmed they might take up Arms in their own defence, and make way for a free access to the King to present their Remonstrances: they Elected for their private or nameless Chief the Prince of Condé, and under his Authority la Renaudie; and resolved that in every Province should be chosen a certain number of Un-Married Men, who under such Chiefs by them named, should go to Amboise, upon a day assigned; that they should there present their Petition to the King, and seize upon the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal de Lor∣rain, that they might be brought to Tryal by process before the Estates. But who could give security or answer for them they would not have kill'd them out of hand, and have made themselves Masters of the Queen-Mothers person and the King himself? This was certainly all laid to their Charge.\n\nThe design was kept so private, that the Guises had advice of it from Forraign Countries sooner then they discover'd it in France. The time drawing near, la Renaudie who forged a thousand fine imaginations upon the event of this project, could not hold his tongue, but opened the whole mystery to an Advocate of his own Religion named des Avenelles, with whom he lodged at Paris. The Advo∣cate discover'd it to l'Allemand Vouzé a Master of Requests, and l'Allemand carried him to Court to declare particularly all what he had learned of la Re∣naudie.\n\nUpon this news the Guises first provided for the security of their own persons, and without the least noise called all their trustiest friends about them, gave order for the preservation of the great Cities, caused the Prince and the Admiral to come to Court, granted an abolition of all things past to the Religionaries, excepting to those that had conspired; and at the same time set Guards of Soldiers and Men belonging to the Provosts upon all the Roads leading to the Conspirators. The Duke got the Title of Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom confirmed to him, as well whilst the King should be present, as absent, and established a Com∣pany of Musquetiers on Horse-back, all select Men, who were constantly to at∣tend the Kings Sacred Person.\n\ndescription Page 666\n\n[Year of our Lord 1560] The Court immediately dislodged from Blois, and went to the Castle of Am∣boise, as well because that place was stronger, as to break the measures of the Plotters. In the mean time the Duke of Guise sent the Kings Orders into all the Provinces, with exhortations to the Nobility, and Officers of War, to arm themselves for the preservation of the State, and to the Governors to seize up∣on all such as should be found in Arms, whether on Foot or on Horseback upon the Road of Amboise. The Prince of Conde who was going to Court, met the Lord de Cipierre at Orleans, by whom he was informed how the enterprize was discover'd: but this hindred not his Journey forward, nor la Renaudie (a self∣will'd fellow) from pursuing his design. But the Court having changed their station, he was fain to change the Rendezvous appointed for his Gang, and this was it that made them miscarry in the execution of the contrivance.\n\nCastelno de Chalosses, one of the chief Ring-leaders, with Raunay and Mazeres were at Nozé. James de Savoye Duke of Nemours took the two last as they were imprudently walking without the Castle: but Castelno and the rest got in. He besieged them there, and being unable to take them by force, drew them out by fair promises; for he gave them his word he would carry them to the King and no hurt should be done to them, neither should they be confin'd to Pri∣son. But as there is no security in the faith of that Man that is not able to warrant it , as soon as they were come to Amboise they were cast into a Goal, and Ne∣mours thought it a sufficient excuse to say, I cannot help it.\n\nLa Renaudie who was in Vendosmois, made his Men advance with all speed to disengage Castelno, whose surrender he knew not of: but as they Marched in small parties and by ways thorow the Forrests, the people set there by the Kings Order to watch them, easily slew them, or took them Prisoners, and tied them to their Horse-Tails to lead them to Amboise, whither they no sooner came but they hang'd them up immediately on the Battlements of the Walls, Booted and Spurr'd. The day after la Renaudie was kill'd in the Forrest of Chasteau-Renaud, but he first slew Pardillan his Cousin, to whom the King had given command to go a∣hunting after the Conspirators with two hundred Horse. His Body was for some hours hanged upon the Bridge at Amboise, with this writing, Captain of the Rebels, then quarter'd, and the quarters set up in divers places.\n\nThe Guises press'd the Chiefs might be dispatch'd, the Chancellor was of opi∣nion they should suspend that till they had found the bottom and main drift of the enterprize, and to appease the fury of those exasperated spirits, it would be fit to grant a Pardon to such whose blind zeal had misled them, provided they would return to their own homes, in small parcels of two or three in a Compa∣ny. But whilst they were contending for Mercy and Clemency against the ri∣gour of Justice and Law, a Captain of the Conspirators named la Motte, made an attempt to surprize Amboise, which stopt the Chancellors Mouth, and let loose the raynes of persecution to the utmost severity. A Command was given to take all such as had been in Armes either dead or alive, though they should be returning to their own homes.\n\nThey pardon'd very few of those they had in Hold; there were hanged, drown∣ed, and beheaded near Twelve Hundred, the Streets of Amboise were overflowed with Blood, the River choaked up with dead Corps, and the Market-places plant∣ed full of Gibbets. The Chief were Executed the last, the Queen-Mother, her three Sons, and all the Court Ladies gazing out of the Windows, beholding this Tragical Spectacle as a divertisement. Not one of them would own or confess that the Conspiracy aimed at the Kings Person, but only against the Guises. Raunay and Mazeres confessed upon the Rack that la Renaudie had told them, that if it had succeeded the Prince of Condé would have declared: Castelno stoutly denied it, and upon their confrontation gave them very significant re∣proaches.\n\nSome writings in Cyphers seized in the Custody of la Bigne Secretary of the Conspiracy, and the Examinations of certain Captains that had Command a∣mongst them, gave them light enough to believe that the Prince of Condé and the Admiral were concerned: but the proofs not being clear, and the Evidence only upon hear-say, and those that had orders to search the Princes House, find∣ing neither Men nor Arms there, he demanded leave to purge himself in full Council before the King. The Queen Mother being willing to admit him, he made a discourse full of Reason and Eloquence to justifie himself concerning that attempt; and afterwards gave the lye to all that durst say he was guilty of it,\n\ndescription Page 667\n\nand offer'd to Fight them himself, renouncing his Quality, only for that pur∣pose. [Year of our Lord 1560] The Duke of Guise out of a most profound dissimulation applauded his generosity, and told him, he was also ready to maintain his Innocency: but in private he notwithstanding was of opinion he ought to be seized on. The Queen Mother did not judge it convenient, whether she feared the Guises might make themselves too absolute, if they could but pull down the only Prince that was a∣ble to make head against them, or that she apprehended lest such a detension should produce some act of desperation, which might prove more fatal then the fore-going Conspiracy.\n\nThe danger over, they wrote Letters in the name of the King to all the Par∣liaments, Governors and great Cities, giving them an account of the eminent danger the King had escaped, and the signal Service the Duke of Guise had ren∣dred him. The Parliament of Paris giving Credit to it, bestowed upon him the glorious Title of Conservator of the Country. In the mean while the Coligny's ob∣serving they were looked upon with a very evil Eye at Court, withdrew them∣selves, and the Queen order'd the Admiral to go and quiet those Commotions that were beginning in Normandy, and to enquire and search out the real causes that he might make report thereof to her.\n\nThe horror of this Conspiracy, and so much blood as had been spilt in pu∣nishing it, so deeply wounded the Heart of Francis Olivier who had a tender and most humane Soul, that he fell sick upon it and died. The Cardinal de Lor∣raine had cast his Eye upon John de Morvilliers Bishop of Orleans: but the Queen prevented him, and desired the King to give that Office to Michael de l'Hospital; at least she made some body tell him, that he owed that favour to her, although the Cardinal would needs perswade him it came by his means; l'Hospital did af∣terwards make it plainly appear the Obligation was from the Queen, by his so closely sticking to her Interest.\n\nThe Cognisance of all matters and Crimes relating to Heresies had hitherto belonged to the Parliaments, who five years before had contended mightily to preserve the same. Now, as there were many Councellors and of the most Learned, who were imbued with those Novelties, the Cardinal de Lorraine got all such causes to be transmitted to the Bishops by an Edict of the Month of May, at Ramorantin in Berry: To which the new Chancellor consented, to prevent a greater evil, the Inquisition, which that Cardinal and the Court of Rome endea∣vour'd to introduce in France, with the same power it hath in Spain.\n\nIn France they had hitherto called those that professed the new Religion Lu∣therans, though in many points they did not follow the Doctrines of Luther. Some did more properly name them Sacramentaries, because they denied the Re∣ality of the Body of our Lord in the Holy Sacrament. This year they applied the name of Huguenots to them, which sticks upon them still. The Origine of it is uncertain: there are those that say it took its birth at Tours, and they derive it from the name of Hugon, because those Novators made their Mid-night Assem∣blies at the Gate Hugon, or because they went abroad only during the darkness, like Goblins or Spirits, by them called King Hugon, and which according to the fabulous reports of those People, stalked about the Streets of that Town in the Night time. For my own part, I think I have good Proof that it comes from a Swiss word which signifies League, but corrupted by those of Geneva, and from thence it Travelled into France with the Religionaries themselves, who were so called in those Countries.\n\nAfter Queen Catherine had Fortified her self by the Councils of the Chancel∣lor de l'Hospital, she was precautioned as well against the Guises as against the Princes of the Blood; And as she would always keep to that Maxime of her House, as a Rule to walk by, Divide and Reign, she studied to continue the troubles, that she might still find a Party to rely upon, and make them balance one another. And if either side grew too ponderous, she put more weight into the other Scale to bring them to an equalibrity. Thus observing the absence of the two first Princes of the Blood, and the Coligny's, who were gone to their own homes, left the Guises in too great Credit, she began to lend a more favourable ear to the Huguenots, and even to read some Writings they address'd to her for their justi∣fication.\n\nWith the same prospect, or to dive into the designs and interests of the Gran∣dees, she Summoned them all to Fountainbleau upon the twentieth of August, under colour of taking their advice upon the present State of affairs, as it was other∣while\n\ndescription Page 668\n\n[Year of our Lord 1560] the Ancient and necessary Custom, and Method of the Kingdom of France.\n\nThe Constable, the Admiral and Dandelot went thither with a Train of Eight or Nine Hundred Gentlemen. The Assembly lasted only four Sessions; They were held in the Queen Mothers Closset, the King being present.\n\nThe first day, the King and then the Queen his Mother, having in few words declared the occasion of their being called, which was to find out some remedy for the Troubles caused by differences in Religion, and to root out those abuses that sprung up so fast in all the Orders, conjured those that were present to give their opinions and speak their thoughts without passion or interest. The Chancellor did more at large lay open what the distempers and disorders were, and the Re∣medies they might apply.\n\nWhen he had ended, the Admiral advanced and falling on his knees before the King, presented him some Petitions, not signed by any one, but which he said he had received in Normandy, which implored the Kings mercy, and begged he would put some stop to the prosecutions against the Reformed, and allow them some Churches and the free exercise of their Faith.\n\nThereupon John de Montluc Bishop of Valence being desired to give his advice, spoke with more freedom (then any Enemy of the Church of Rome durst have done) of the abuses and vices of the Clergy, particularly the Bishops, Forty of them having been seen at one time together at Paris, wasting their precious time in sloathful idleness or forbidden pleasures; praised the devotion in singing of Psalmes and Hymnes in French, rather then wanton Ayres and Songs; Blamed the severity Inflicted upon People guilty of no other Crime, but a perswasion of what they believed to be really good; and concluded it best to refer the decision of those Controversies to a National Council, there being little hopes of a Gene∣ral one, and the reformation of the disorders in the State to an Assembly of the Estates General. Marillac Archbishop of Vienne spake to the same purpose, and added several things too picquant against the Guises.\n\nThe Cardinal de Lorraine a Prelate of a sublime Eloquence, took the Counter∣part against these two Bishops, and by weighty reasons shewed there was no need of any Council, and that the Prosecution ought to be carried on against the Sec∣taries. As to the other point, he was of opinion to call the Estates together. He also gave an account in gross of the Administration of the Treasury, as his Brother the Duke of Guise of his Conduct in the Government, justifying himself against the Calumnies imputed to him; especially his having Armed the King, against his Subjects by setting up a Guard for him, as he had done, for which he laid all the blame on those that were the Authors of the late attempts and di∣sturbances.\n\nThe result of all was an Edict the Four and Twentieth of August, which Summoned the Estates of the Kingdom to meet in the City of Melun upon the Tenth day of December, and ordained the Bishops to come to the King the Tenth of January to such place as the King should prescribe, to consult of a fit time and place to hold a National Council, in case the Pope by affected delayes did conti∣nue to defeat their hopes of the General one, so often promised. Moreover the Governors were enjoyned to watch there might be no factious Meetings, and to su spend their pursuits for matters of Religion, if no other Crime were complica∣ted with it. This was to begin a Toleration. Things being thus regulated, every one had order to retire home.\n\nGreat was the Alarm at Rome when they heard mention made of holding a Natio∣nal Council in France; Pius IV. omitted nothing to disswade the King from it. He represented to him, as a great grievance, that the Gallican Church would re-establish the Pragmatique, and by consequence the Elections, whereby the Royal dignity and prero∣gative would be much eclipsed and diminished: He intreated the King of Spain to in∣terpose his Interest and Credit with him to prevent a mischief he reckoned so prejudici∣al to his Pontifical Authority: And all these Engines proving too weak to obtain a revo∣cation of those resolutions taken in Council, he could find no other expedient to avoid it but by a General Council. He was a while in suspence, whether to call one wholly new, or whether he should continue the same his Predecessors Paul III. and Julius III. had Prorogued. All considered, the advice for continuation seemed best; And he caused publication to be made that the Council should re-commence on Easter-day the follow∣ing year.\n\ndescription Page 669\n\n[Year of our Lord 1560] The two Brothers Anthony and Lewis de Bourbon did not appear at the Assem∣bly of Melun: for two Months before Anthony was retired to Gascogne, and his Brother was gone to visit him. Being there in much greater security, they settled their Affairs, and projected the means and methods to make themselves the stron∣ger, and set aside the Guises. These having many faithful and trusty Servants, Spies well paid, and all rewards and punishments in their own hands, quickly discover'd their Stratagems, and blasted them before they could be ripe for Execu∣tion.\n\nThe Princes made use of one named la Sague, an Imprudent man, who Com∣municated his Secrets to a Camerade of his, with whom he had born Arms in Pi∣edmont. This Fellow whispers it to the Mareschal de Brissac, who tells it to the Duke of Guise: So that as la Sague was returning into Gascogne, he was Seized with a great many Letters. Fear of the Rack, or hopes of reward unty'd his Tongue: Himself put them in the way how to read some of them, by wetting the Paper, where before there was no Footsteps of any Writing appear'd. The most Criminal were those from Francis de Vendosme Vidame of Chartres, an Ene∣my to the Duke of Guise; so he was laid hold on and shut up in the Bastille. Some time after he was transfer'd from thence, but under a strong Guard, to his own House, where he Died of grief, if not by the Debauchery of his Youth.\n\nBouchard who was Chancellor to Anthony, without any other instigation but his own faint-heartedness, did likewise reveal all the practises of the Prince of Condé, and the means he made use of to engage his Brother. He thought hereby to se∣cure himself: but they Seized upon him, and put him in Prison at Saint John d'Angely, where he was kept very close, that they might have his Evidence when time Served.\n\nThere appeared in the mean time divers Commotions in the Provinces, which shewed that the whole Body of the Religionaries were on the point of making a general rising; for in Normandy, whither the Admiral had been dispatched, they met and Preached Publickly. The two Brothers Anthony and Paul Richend Mou∣vans, endeavoured to make themselves Masters of Valence, of Montelimard, of Romans in Dauphiné, and of the Cities of Aix and Arles in Provence: but the Lord de Maugeron made them fail in their enterprize; Anthony was slain in a tumult at Draguignan, Paul made his escape into Swisserland.\n\nIn like manner Charles du Puy Montbrun making use of the Religionaries in his dispute for the Government of Dauphiné at la Mothe Gondrin, was routed by his Adversary, and ran away stark naked, yet got safe to the Swiss Country.\n\nMaligny of the House de Ferriere, who belonged to the King of Navarre at∣tempted also to Seize upon Lyons, causing his Soldiers to Ship in man by man; and he had compleated his work if N. Dapchon Abbot de Savigny who was Go∣vernor in the absence of the Mareschal de Saint André his maternal Uncle, had not discover'd his Plot and put the Bourgeois in Arms. Maligny was glad to make his escape, and the Abbot apprehending some worse Event, set open the Gates that he might be gone quietly. The Mareschal de Saint André going thither to search into the bottom of the design, caused above fifty of those rash undertakers to be executed.\n\nThe Princes promised themselves a much stronger Cabal in the Assembly of Es∣tates then the Guises: nevertheless their Friends were of Opinion they ought not to rely upon that, but come so well Armed to Court, as to be in a Condition either to drive them thence, or make them perish there. To this purpose they had given orders on all hands: but their Letters and practises having taken Air, the Guises made use of the Kings Name to fortify themselves, sent for all the Es∣tablished Company's, and put forth a Declaration, to all Governors of Provinces, commanding them to punish the disturbers of the publick Peace according to the utmost severity of the Edict, with power to Suspend and displace such Officers as had conniv'd or shew'd any indulgence towards the Factious. Besides all this, they sent to command the Princes to come to Court, only attended with their Houshold Servants, to justify themselves of such matters wherewith they were charged; so that to speak truly, they left them but a very ill-boding passage to enter, much more like a Prison Door then a Gate of the Louvre.\n\nThey resolved however to come. The Cardinal de Bourbon their Brother being deceived first, was an Instrument to deceive them; withal the Dignity of their Birth seemed an inviolable safe-conduct to them. So that the King of Navarre refused seven hundred Gentlemen of Poitou, who offer'd to attend him, and above\n\ndescription Page 670\n\n[Year of our Lord 1560] fifteen hundred Soldiers who were in a readiness in several Provinces, telling them his innocency, was his sufficient security, and he would give them no cause to suspect he came with any design to offer violence to the King, or to the Es∣tates.\n\nIn his Journey he received notice from several hands, that the Guises having scared the King and the Queen Mother with the pretended Conspiracy revealed by la Sague, were more Masters at Court then ever, and had put them upon the extreamest resolutions. However he went forward not duely weighing the wise Councils of Marillac Archbishop of Vienne, who having endeavour'd all that was possible to diswade him, died with Grief, and the fear he justly had conceived lest the Guises, whom he had already highly offended, should revenge themselves upon him.\n\nThe Sixteenth of October, the King with the Queen Mother, the Princes of Montpensier and de la Roche Sur-Yon, the Guises, and all the great ones of the Court, went to Orleans, after he had quartered his Gent-darmerie, and other Soldiers in all the Cities Forty Miles about, and disarmed the Citizens of Orleans, for the most part tainted with the new opinions, and suspected to have intended to deli∣ver it up to the Prince of Condé, as they did two years after. He forthwith sent Messengers into several Provinces to lay hands upon all such as the Guises had a mind to involve in the Conspiracy; an ill omen for the Prince of Condé.\n\nAnd indeed as soon as he and his Brother were Arrived, and had saluted the King, Philip de Mailly Brezé, and Francis le Roy Chavigny, Captains of the Life Guards, Seized him and Convey'd him to a House in the Market place called l'Estape , at the Corner whereof they had raised a kind of Bastion of brick with a Platform, defended by several Small Cannon.\n\nThe King of Navarre his Brother was not secured, but perceived he was ve∣ry narrowly observ'd, and forsaken by all, excepting the Admiral, and the Car∣dinal de Chastillon his Brother, who faithfully accompanied him. Dandelot more apprehensive, had retired himself to his Wifes Estate in Bretagne. The Dame de Roye Mother in Law to the Prince of Condé, was likewise Arrested, some few dayes after in his own House, and carried to the Castle of Saint Germains en Laye. So was Hierosme Grollot Bailiff of Orleans, accused of holding Correspon∣dence with the Religionaries; and Bouchard Chancellor to the Navarrois was brought from Saint Jean d'Angely, as a material Witness that knew the most for the Conviction of the Prince.\n\nThe Order for seizing the Prince was proposed by the Mareschal de Brissac, who boldly exposed himself to all for the Guises, the King signed it, and after him the Chancellor, though with regret. The Chancellor, Christopher de Thou a President in Parliament, and two Councellors, with the Procuror, or Solicitor General Bourdin, and the Register Du Tillet, went to interrogate him; He refused to answer them, and said he owned no other Judges then the whole Body of Par∣liament, together with the Pairs , and the King there presiding.\n\nBut this appeal and all such others he made afterwards, were declared null by the Kings Council, and upon the Sollicitor Generals Petition it was order'd, that he should answer or that he should be held as fully Convict, and that in the mean time the Witnesses should be re-examined, whereupon he demanded Councel, they assigned him two Advocates of Paris, Peter Robert and Francis de Marillac. He was afterwards confronted with Witnesses which were brought in from all Parts; and then saw himself in most eminent danger. But the Queen Mother found her Authority in no less hazard: for the Guises who thought themselves al∣ready above all by the approaching ruine of their Enemy, began to slight and des∣pise her of whom they stood no longer in need.\n\nGrollot being Condemned to die, his Sentence was looked upon by all Men, as a prejudication and fore-runner of the Princes. Now upon the Seventeenth of November the King being ahunting, that he might not be present at the Execu∣tion of this unhappy man, was seized with a heaviness in his head, which in some dayes turned to an imposthume voiding it self by his Ear. The first Five or Six dayes the Distemper did not appear so dangerous in the mean time they carried on the Process against the Prince, with so much hast and precipitation, that stepping over many formalities, they Condemned him to loose his Head. The Sentence was signed by the greatest part of the Councellors of State and Men of the Robe, excepting the Chancellor, and the President Guillard de Mortier, who\n\ndescription Page 671\n\nobserving the encrease of the Kings malady, were so crafty as to spin out the [Year of our Lord 1560] time and deferr it. Amongst all the Knights of the Order and the Lords, so much were they devoted to the Guises, there was not one but the Count de San∣cerre who refused it, notwithstanding three express Orders from the King.\n\nAt the same time this terrible Sentence was forging, the Physitians, who in the case of Persons of so eminent a quality, never give their Judgment clearly till the extremity, declared that the King was very near his end. Then did the Guises do their utmost to oblige the Queen to have the King of Navarre secured like∣wise: but she having taken advice of the Chancellor, could not resolve to give her consent. That prudent Minister made her very sensible how the detention of those two Princes would necessarily leave and confirm all the Authority in the hands of the Guises, whereas she ought to get it all to her self, and over-rule both Parties, by keeping them in equal balance.\n\nAnd indeed both of them dreading her became her suppliants, the Princes for their Lives, which she had at her disposal, the Guises for their Grandeur which she could soon pull down with the assistance of the Princes, and submitted themselves to such Conditions as she pleased. Anthony promised under his hand to yield the Regency to her, which belonged to him as first Prince of the Blood, reserving on∣ly the Title of Lieutenant General; and the Guises swore to serve her for and against all.\n\nThings being in this posture, the King gave up his last gasp of breath the Fifth day of December. He was Aged Sixteen years, ten Months and a half, of which he had Reigned only one year and five Months, wanting five dayes. He had no Child by Mary Stuart his Wife, who the year following returned into her King∣dom of Scotland.\n\nHis Servants, because of the Innocency of his manners and disposition, called him The King without Vice, a Title much more glorious then any other can be be∣stowed, when it hath for it's Foundation not the imbecillity of mind and under∣standing, but Wisdom and Vertue.\n\nHis death hapning favourably for the Princes and for the Montmorancies, gave an occasion to their Enemies to say it had been hastned by Ambrose Paré his Chyrur∣geon, who was a Creature of the Constables, and had injected Poison into his Ear. Others, but a long while afterwards, observing the perverse ambition, and the Conduct of Queen Catherine de Medicis, suspected her as guilty of that Crime, as well as of the death of the Daufin Francis his Brother in Law, and of Charles IX. his second Son. Those that judged with more modesty, found the cause to be in himself, and said that having been generated of corrupt blood, his Mother conceiving him after ten years sterility, which proceeded from a suppression of ... he had ever been indisposed, especially in his Head, which did at no time discharge it self by the ordinary Channels, so that the pituitous matter corrupting there, caused that Imposthumation whereof he died.\n\nAll the Court Grandees were so busie about the contriving of their own Affairs, that neither his Mother, nor his Uncle took any care for his Funeral. Of so ma∣ny Lords, and so many Bishops as were then at Orleans, there were none but San∣sac and la Brosse who had been his Governors, and Lewis Guillard Bishop of Sen∣lis (who was blind) that conducted his Corps to Saint Denis. His Heart was left to the Church named Saincte Croix at Orleans.\n\nThe Guises excused their not attending it upon the necessity there was for them to stay with their Niece to comfort her.\n\nBut they were not exempted from reproach, such as had more sence of Ho∣nour then Ambition, much blamed them for not paying that little devoir to him from whom they had received so much honour. And indeed, some body tack'd a Paper upon the Pall that cover'd his Coffin, wherein were these words, Taneguy du Chastel, where art thou? This Taneguy, as was well known, tho banished from Court during the Reign of Charles VII. his Master, came generously back again thither to make a Funeral for that King at his own charges, shewing his grati∣tude thereby and making it appear to all the World that his thankfulness for the favours he had received, were above his fear of the resentments of Lewis XI. a mor∣tal Enemy to the memory and Servants of his own Father.\n\nThe Constable who had been sent for several times, but crept along slowly by little Journeys, having heard the tydings of the Kings death, doubled his pace, and Arrived the Eight of the Month of December at Orleans. Entring into\n\ndescription Page 672\n\n[Year of our Lord 1560] the City he made use of the power belonging to his Office, and commanded away the Guards that were at the Gates, threatning to send them to the Gallows if he found them any more besieging, or investing the King in that manner in a time of Peace, and in the very heart of his Kingdom.\n\nAs for the Prince, though he had free liberty as soon as ever the King expir'd, nevertheless he refused to go out of Prison, till he knew who were the prosecu∣tors against him and who his accusers. There were none durst undertake to play so desperate a Game; and the Guises replied, that all had been done by express Command of the King, but did not produce any Order by vertue whereof he had been so prosecuted. So that Thirteen dayes afterwards he came forth, and went to Ham in Picardy, attended with Honour and respect by those very men, that had served as Guards upon him in his Confinement.\n\ndescription Page 673\n\nCHARLES IX.\n\nKing LX.\n\nPOPES,\n\nPIUS IV. Five Years under this Reign.\n\nPIUS V. Elected the 7 January, 1566. S. 6 Years 3 Months and 24 dayes.\n\nGREGORY. XIII. Elected the 13. of May, 1572. S. 13. Years want∣ing one Month, whereof two years under this Reign.\n\n[Year of our Lord 1560. in December.] THose hopes many had conceived that King Francis II. being near the time of his compleat Majority, might possibly extinguish, all the Fa∣ctions, were now by his death changed into a just fear of finding them rather more enflamed, and heightned from a Sedition to a Bloody War; wherefore the Tumults increasing every day, they made hast to Assemble the Estates, from whom the silly vulgar expect a redress of all their grievances and troubles.\n\nThe first Session was held the Thirteenth of December in a great Timber Hall expresly built in the place called l'Estape. The Chancellor begun it with a Speech becoming his gravity. He blamed the violent proceedings in matters of Reli∣gion, told them the only means to reclaim such as went astray, was a good exemplary Life, and sound Doctrine, exhorted them earnestly to lay aside the injurious names of Lutherans, Huguenots, Papists, and desired every one to for∣bear all hatred, and own no passion but for the publick good, in which consists the benefit of all particular Persons. There was nothing else done at this first meeting, only the three Orders were sent to confer together about their Papers and Instructions.\n\nSome who were inspired with a bolder zeal, had a mind to confer the Regen∣cy upon the King of Navarre, but withal to leave the Education of the young King to his Mother, to set bounds to the Government, and make choice of a good Council for the management of all Affairs of State. The Queen Mother took the Allarm; caused the Kings Council to make a Decree, which forbad the Deputies to intermeddle with the Government, and made use of so many in∣trigues, that the Navarrois, a Prince very inconstant and irresolute, was perswaded to confirm what he had promised her during the Imprisonment of his Brother.\n\n[Year of our Lord 1561] The second of January was the second Sessions of the Estates. The three Or∣ders made their Harangues: John de Lange Advocate of Bourdeaux, spake for the Third Estate, James de Silly Earl of Rochefort, for the Nobility, and John Quintin a Canon of Autun and Doctor en Decret, for the Clergy. The two first laid great stress and weight upon the Vices of the Ecclesiasticks, the cause of all the disorders; The last endeavour'd to defend them, retorted all upon the new Sec∣taries, and reflected particularly upon the Admiral, who demanded reparation.\n\ndescription Page 674\n\n[Year of our Lord 1561] Quintin was obliged to do it in a set Speech at the closing up of the Es∣tates.\n\nWhatever accord there could be between the Navarrois and the Regent, yet there was danger that the Estates, if they consider'd their power, might put some Fetters upon this Woman who was a stranger, and besides they began to perceive that the Princes were forming parties, and tryed to foist in certain pro∣positions for their own interests, or concerning their private quarrels. Amongst others, the King of Navarre put them upon calling for an account of the Finan∣ces, and a particular of all the Gifts bestowed in the Reign of Henry II. himself proffering to surrender all that were given him.\n\nThis touched the Constable and the Mareschal de Saint André, more then the Guises, as having expended more in the Kings Service then they had gained. The Regent soon perceived where it pinched, and joyning them to her self upon this consideration, easily adjourned the Estates to the Month of May, and the City of Pontoise, and ordained, that she might be at less Charge and trouble to bribe them, that there should come but two Deputies from each Govern∣ment.\n\nIn the Month of February the King being come to Fountainbleau, the Prince of Con∣dé appeared there with a slender attendance, that he might give them no jealousie. The next day being admitted to the Privy-Council, and having spoken of his innocency, he asked the Chancellor whether there were any proofs against him; the Chancellor answered No, and all the Princes and Lords having testified that they were satisfied of his innocency, the King commanded him to take his Seat. The Council did after make a Decree which declared him wholly innocent, and sent him back to the Parliament of Paris to get a more Authentique one, as he did in a few days afterwards.\n\nThe courage of the Guises did not sink upon the rise of their enemies: they were supported by the Catholick Party, and the Catholicks by them. It is most cer∣tain but for them the old Religion must have given place to the new Sect. The Regent favour'd them in show, that they might not fly out to extremes. In the mean time the Navarrois desiring to enlarge his power, began a quarrel by de∣manding to have the Keys of the Kings House brought to him, not to the Duke of Guise, that honour being his due in respect of his Office of Grand-Maistre. The pretence was but slight, but the King of Navarre carried it on so high, that he was upon leaving the Court with all the Princes of the Blood and the Constable, to come to Paris and deliberate concerning the Government of the State. What did the Queen? She regains the Constable, and that he might have a plausible excuse to break their intended project, prevailed with the King to command him, in presence of the Four Secretaries of State, not to for∣sake or leave him. So that the Navarrois apprehending they might perhaps do well enough now without him, was advised to stay, and came to an agreement with the Queen, who augmented his power of Lieutenancy.\n\nFrom that time the Constable began to fall off from the Princes of the Blood. The same proposition concerning the repetition of gifts, being renew'd in the particular Estates of Paris, he was made believe it was chiefly aimed at him, be∣cause he had in truth received an Hundred Thousand Crowns under Henry II. whereof he had given no account. To the apprehension he was under of being obliged to repay this Sum, were joyned the several exhortations of his Wife, the Dutchess of Valentinois, Honorat de Savoy Count de Villars his Brother in Law, his Son Henry Lord of Danville; all which under the specious pretence of pre∣serving the Catholick Religion, persuaded him to enter into a League with the Duke of Guise and the Mareschal de Saint André; the remonstrances of the Prince, the Coligny's his Nephews, and his Son the Mareschal, esteemed one of the wisest Lords in the Kingdom, were not so prevalent as to hinder it. The Huguenots named this Union the Triumvirat.\n\nThese Brouilleries had hitherto retarded the Kings Coronation. When these three Lords were thus united, they carried him to Reims, where he received the Crown the fifteenth day of May from the hands of the Cardinal de Lorrain Arch-Bishop of that See. The Duke of Guise, pursuant to the ancient Order of the Kingdom, which gives place according to the dignity of their Lands, or antiqui∣ty of Peerage , not according to their birth, did there precede the Duke of Montpensier a Prince of the Blood; the Queen-Regent having so adjudged it,\n\ndescription Page 675\n\nthough on the other hand she would have Alexander Monsieur her second Son, [Year of our Lord 1561] precede the King of Navarre, who had a more eminent Title: which was not so practised at the Coronation of Francis II.\n\nIt had been agreed by the Treaty of the general Peace, that within three years, the right of the Kings pretensions to the Territories of the Duke of Sa∣voy, should be Examined and settled by Commissioners on either part. King Francis II. and the Duke had named Deputies for that end in the year 1560. An∣thony Seguier President in Parliament, and Anthony de Chandon Master of Requests, who were for the King, made Six Demands. 1. The County of Nice, which they said was a Member of the County of Provence. 2. The Cities of Turin, Cony, Montdevis, Albe, Querasque, and Savillan. 3. The County of Ast which had been given in Dower to Valentine de Milan, Wife of the Duke of Orleans. 4. The Dependancies of the Marquiss de Salusses specified in an Arrest, or Decree of Parliament in the year 1390. 5. Homage of that Duke for what he held in Daufiné, on this side Guyer le Vif and elsewhere, in Focygny, and in Genevois; and the inheritance of Louisa Mother of Francis I.\n\nThey produced their Titles, and their Pleas; the Deputies for the Duke their exceptions and their answers: but seeing on either side they acted rather as Advocates then Judges, they could not agree upon any thing, and made their re∣ports severally, and diversly.\n\nThe Duke could not therefore obtain any thing till the year following, when he was so earnest with the King, that by Letters Patents of the eight of August, he commanded that they should restore to him, Turin, Chivas, Quiers and Villa-Nuova d'Ast, excepting only the Ammunitions and Artillery, in exchange for Pignerol, Savillan, and Perouse with all the Lands within their Limits. Imbert de la Pla∣tiere Bourdillon, the Kings Lieutenant beyond the Alpes, started many difficulties, sent warm Remonstrances to the Council to prevent the Execution of that Order, and would not obey till after three express Commands, and upon the most solemn and authentick discharges that could be imagined. Which yet would have avail∣ed but little, if the Dukes had not paid all the Arrears that were due to the French Garrisons in the said places, and had not moreover lent a Hundred Thou∣sand Crowns to the King.\n\nThe Ambiguous conduct of the Regent fomented the Troubles. On the one side she feigned to give a favourable ear to the Huguenots, for she permitted John de Montluc Bishop of Valence, and Peter du Vall Bishop of Sées, to Preach even in the Kings Family, such Doctrine as was very much like theirs; She wrote a long Epistle to the Pope, wherein she said that till there were a Gene∣ral Council, they might safely be admitted to the Communion of the Roman Church, since they held or taught nothing contrary to Holy Scripture, or the seven first Oecumenical Councils, She set forth an Edict which commanded all men to leave them in peace, and released from Prison, and call'd home from Banishment all such as had been prosecuted upon that single account. (This was the first they ever had in their favour;) and on the other side she incited the Constable to complain aloud and openly of these things thus done to the preju∣dice of the Roman Church.\n\nHonour would not allow the Constable to joyn himself openly with the Duke of Guise, whilst the Prince of Condé continued to be his Enemy; wherefore he begg'd the Queen to make an accommodation between them. Both of them being therefore commanded to come into the presence of the King, the Princes, Cardinals, and great Officers, the Duke of Guise Addressing his Speech to the Prince, assu∣red him he had no way contributed to his imprisonment: the Prince replied, he held him for a Rascal and a Traitor whoever were the Author of it; the Duke answer'd he believed so to, and that this did no way concern him. This past, the King Commanded them to embrace, and promise each other a sincere and cordial amity. An instrument hereof was drawn up in writing which was signed by the two Secretaries of State.\n\nThe Parliament was in such a heat against the Edict the Queen had obtained in favour of the Huguenots, because they had sent it only to the Presidials and not to them, that they made a Decree quite contrary: Whereupon the King made another in July referring the Cognizance of all Crimes of Sedition and unlawful Assemblies to the Presidial Courts, and those of Heresie to the Judges Ecclesiasti∣cal, by whom the Parties convict should be delivered up to the Secular Power; who should not however condemn them to any thing above banishment.\n\ndescription Page 676\n\n[Year of our Lord 1561] They had often discoursed of a National Council: till that could be called, it was thought convenient to have a Colloquy or Conference, between the Ca∣tholick Priests and the Huguenot Ministers. The Cardinal de Lorrain was one of the chief Promoters, whether to hinder the National Council which did not at all please the Court of Rome, or to make ostentation of his learning and eloquence. The Ministers did likewise promise much advantage to themselves: for by this means they were made equal with Bishops, whereas in a Council they could have had no place. Besides they thought themselves able enough to throw Dust in the Catholicks Eyes: and they reckon'd they must needs have the better of it, seeing the two Bishops of Sées and of Valence, who were of the most knowing Prelates, leaned towards them.\n\n[Year of our Lord 1561. in May.] In the interim, the Assembly of the States which had been adjourned to Pontoise in May, began to fall to work. Whatever the Regents Emissaries had been able to do, there was yet so much of the ancient French spirit left in the heads of the Deputies, as would not suffer them to let a Woman have the Regency: the King of Navarre was forced to go thither himself to let them know he had yield∣ed up his right, and together with the Mareschal de Montmorency Governor of the Isle of France, intreat them, they would speak no more of it. This was not sufficient, but for fear they should bring it again upon the Stage, it was judged ne∣cessary to dismiss the Assembly till the Month of August, and to appoint it might be held at Saint Germain en Laye, where they did meet.\n\nThe King was present there sitting on his Throne, the Queen-Mother at his left hand with her Daughter Margaret, and somewhat lower the King of Na∣varre, the Cardinal de Bourbon and the Prince of Condé; before these on the right hand were the Constable, on the left the Chancellor, the Duke of Guise as grand Chamberlain, lay at the Kings Feet. The Cardinals pretended to take place be∣fore the Princes of the Blood, and had often had it in other Assemblies: but it was now judged otherwise in favour of those Princes. The Cardinals de Chastil∣lon and d'Armagnac did acquiesce: and the old Cardinal de Bourbon remained there also, who having the right of birth before the Prince of Condé, had like∣wise the precedence: but the Cardinals de Tournon, de Lorrain, and de Guise, would not submit to it, and so withdrew.\n\nThe Admiral being the person that had persuaded the King of Navarre and the Deputies of the Estates, to confirm the Regency to the Queen-Mother, She would in recompence, whilst She stood in need of him, favour the Huguenot par∣ty; and according to that Air wherewith She had inspired the Court, or to in∣timidate the Clergy and incline them to give Money, it was observed that in this Assembly every thing was turned against the whole Body of them. Those that spoke in the name of the third Estate, and the Nobility mentioned, no other thing but their irregularities and disorder, and concluded, (as the Hereticks ever do, and all such as have more Policy then Religion) not so much to re∣form them, as to retrench their vast Riches, and take away their Temporal Ju∣risdiction, and adjudg the possessions of Religious Rents to the King. They ad∣ded, that a National Council ought to be called, and in the mean time did tole∣rate the Religionaries to Preach with all freedom in such Temples, where the King should appoint, and give leave.\n\nAfter these Harangues they considered and debated the propositions contained in the Deputies papers and instructions: wherein some Reglements were made by way of satisfaction. But the Regent did not forget to take those advantages which the Council of Kings is ever wont to draw from such Assemblies, that is to say, great Sums of Money. For the Clergy having a hot Allarm, gave con∣sent they should raise four Tenths in Six years, and the third Estate five Solz upon every Tierce of Wine that was carried into any Walled Town. An im∣post that hath encreased ever since that time to this very day.\n\nThe day for the Colloquy being come, there met six Cardinals, and four Bi∣shops at Poisy, with a good number of the Most Learned Theologues, amongst others Claude d'Espences and Claude de Saintes; that which made the number of these Prelates there so great, was their being sent for to advise about the place and time for a Council, and to deliberate concerning the publick Affairs of the State. Now before the Ministers were come, they had propounded several things amongst themselves in order to restore the Discipline, supposing, as it was true, that the corruptions thereof had given rise and birth to the present here∣sies: but they came to no result of any importance.\n\ndescription Page 677\n\n[Year of our Lord 1561] Some days afterwards ten or twelve Ministers arrived there, the most famous of them were Theodore de Beze, Augustin Marlorat, Francis Morel, who com∣piled the first Articles of their Religion, Peter Martyr and John Viret. The King and the Regent were present with the Royal Family, the Princes of the Blood, the Bishops, Cardinals, Council of State and the Grandees of the King∣dom both of the one, and the other Religion, all seated according to their Qualities and Degrees within a place enclosed with rails: the Doctors were be∣hind the Bishops upon low Forms. The Ministers would have gone within the Enclosure, but they were excluded, and remained without, and standing.\n\nThough the Colloquy was appointed upon the Tenth of August, it did not however commence till the Fourth of September. After the Chancellor had open'd it, the Cardinal de Tournon desired since the thing was new and without a Presi∣dent, he might deliberate or consult of it with the Clergy. The Queen-Mother would not allow it, and commanded de Beze to speak: for they had resolved to treat of and handle the questions by discourses and harangues, not by argumen∣tations [month September.] and syllogismes, which suited very well with the desire the Cardinal de Lorrain and Beze had to shew their Eloquence.\n\nWe may say of de Beze on this occasion to say no worse, that he had neither the prudence, nor the moderation he ought to have shown. For upon the point touching the Holy Sacrament his zeal transported him to such expressions and discourses as horribly grated the Catholick Ears, saying that the Body of Jesus Christ was as far distant from the Eucharist, as Earth is from Heaven. The Prelates trembled with horror of the expression, the Cardinal de Tournon made a great deal of noise, and called him Blasphemer, in so much as Beze was asham'd of it, and endeavour'd to excuse himself to the Queen, and filed his rough and grating Proposition a little smoother.\n\nIt had been resolved to reduce all the dispute to two heads, the one of the true Church, the other about the Eucharist. The Sixteenth of September the Cardinal de Lorrain made a discourse as learned as it was eloquent, and full of solid reasonings both upon the one and other point; which he concluded with this, that there could be no re-union of the Sectaries with the Church, if they did not believe the reallity of the Body of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist. The other Prelates rising up applauded this proposition, declared they would live and dye in that belief he had explained, and besought the King and Queen to perse∣vere, and to defend it, protesting they would break off the Colloquy if the Mi∣nisters refused to yield that point.\n\nIt was continued nevertheless for sometime longer. The Four and Twentieth of September Beza strained hard to reply to the Cardinals discourse, then entred into dispute with the Catholick Doctors, as did his Companions afterwards each in his turn. Father Jacques Laynes a Spaniard, and Superiour General of the Je∣suits, whom the Cardinal de Ferrara the Popes Legat (who arrived not till a good while after this Conference was begun) had brought along with him, would not confer with the Ministers: but treated them with the epithets of Wolves, Monkeys, and Serpents, and boldly told the Queen that it did not belong to her to hold Assemblies for matters concerning Religion, especially since the Pope had convocated a Council. The disputes were not discontinued for all that till in fine the alteration having so exasperated and heated their spirits, that they were capable of nothing but downright quarrelling, they broke up the Confe∣rence the five and twentieth day of November.\n\n[month November.] Some believed the Cardinal de Lorrain had chiefly promoted this, who ha∣ving some kind of correspondence with the Lutherans of Germany, thought to make himself head and as it were Pope of that Party opposed to the Roman Church, which however as to the exteriour differs not much; and in this prospect had promised them to engage the Ministers of France by this Colloquy, to sub∣scribe to the Ausburg Confession. And indeed towards the end of the Colloquy there came some Lutheran Ministers to Paris, and the King of Navarre overper∣suaded by the Lawyer Francis Baudouin▪ Tutor to his Bastard-Son, joyned with that Church: but seeing those of France held at too great a distance, and made the difference too wide, the Cardinal de Lorrain dispairing to bring his ends to pass, became equally an utter enemy both to the one and the other.\n\nAs in this Colloquy the Huguenots had for the first time, the liberty allowed them to dispute the controverted Articles of Religion: they thought they might have every where that of exercising it, and began to open their Temples in eve∣ry\n\ndescription Page 678\n\n[Year of our Lord 1561] Province. The Queen-Mother in retribution of the services paid her by the Admiral, lent him, or feigned to lend him her helping hand in many occurrences, and even sent orders to the Kings Ambassador at Rome, to be instant with the Pope and Cardinals, for obtaining the Communion in both Species, and the al∣lowance to pray to God in French; which she could not obtain, perhaps because as she demanded it openly, she obstructed it underhand.\n\nThe Triumviri could not endure the great credit the Admiral was in, and re∣tired from Court, making Religion the pretence of their discontent. The King of Spain who affected the Title of Catholick, express'd a great deal of Anger for that they favoured the Huguenots, and particularly against the King of Na∣varre, thereby to have a Salvo Conscientiae not to do him right concerning his Kingdom, and a pretence to intermeddle with the Affairs of France: to which he was invited by some of the most eminent, in whom the passion to govern and to supplant their Enemies, was more prevalent then love to their Native Country, or the honour of this State.\n\nA short while before a Priest was taken going into Spain with a Petition to King Philip in the name of the Catholicks, together with certain very dangerous instructions; He was carried to the common Goal. The Parliament consider∣ing the quality of the persons involved in this business, durst not search too deep, but thought fit only to condemn him to make amende honorable in full Au∣dience, bare-head and his feet bare, with a Torch lighted in his hand, and to be shut up between four Walls in the Convent of the Chartreux.\n\nLikewise a Batchellor of Sorbon named Tanquerel, having maintained some The∣sis, wherein he asserted the Pope had an absolute power over all Kings, as well in Temporals as in Spirituals, and that therefore he might depose them if they deser∣ved it: the Parliament ordained that he should make amende honorable; and be∣cause he absented himself, it was said the Beadle of the Faculty should do it for him in the School of the Sorbon before a President, two Counsellors, and the Sollicitor General, and in presence of the Dean and Doctors, who were enjoyn∣ed to be there, upon pain of forfeiting all the Priviledges to them granted by the Kings.\n\nThe Holy Fathers greatest fear was lest he should lose his Authority in France by a National Council, the interest of the King of Spain was to gain some Au∣thority by rendring himself necessary, and that of the Regent to preserve her own and encrease it. The King of Navarre shared in this with her, and there∣fore they could never well accord: but all the rest endeavoured to adjust them∣selves with that Prince. The Constable served as mediator to reconcile him with the Duke of Guise, and he to bring him to a correspondence with the Pope and the King of Spain. His Sentiments concerning Religion were a great obstru∣ction, nevertheless they had the Art to manage him so well that they brought him to their bent.\n\nThey propounded to him first, if he would repudiate Jane d'Albret his Wife, as he might lawfully do, said they, because she was an Heretick, that then he should be Married to Queen Mary Steward, who would bring him the Kingdoms of Scotland and of England, and when they found he could not resolve upon that Divorce, they gave him verbal assurances that the King of Spain would give him up the Island of Sardinia, which they described to him as a Country abound∣ing in all things of delight and use, in recompence of Navarre. This charm∣ing illusion was the bait that drew him into their snare.\n\n[Year of our Lord 1562 January.] In the Month of January of the Year 1562. the Regent who desired to sup∣port her self by the Huguenots, got an Edict in their favour, containing amongst other things the revocation of that in July, permission for them to Preach in all parts of the Kingdom, excepting in Wall'd Cities, namely in Paris. An As∣sembly of the Notables authorized it; the Parliament of Paris verified it, not without great difficulty, and with this Clause, in consideration of the present jun∣cture of the times, but not approving of the new Religion in any manner, and till the King should otherwise ordain. The other Parliaments prescribed several modifica∣tions.\n\nWhen the Triumviri had absented themselves, the Admiral appeared most pow∣erful at Court, and was effectually so for some days: but he afterwards lost himself in the Queens good opinion, by his own fault. For too much prospe∣rity having made him lay open his heart too much, he would needs make it ap∣pear to her the strength of the Huguenots was much greater then in truth they\n\ndescription Page 679\n\nwere, demanding Temples for Two Thousand One Hundred and Fifty Congre∣gations. [Year of our Lord 1562. February.] He did it with intent to persuade her that she might find amongst them strength enough to maintain her self against all the World: She pretended to be∣lieve it, and charged him to take an account how many Men those Churches, upon occasion of necessity, could furnish her with fit to bear Arms; but they prudently denied to discover their whole strength: and in the mean time the Queen imagined he would have her depend solely upon his Credit; so that she put her self upon her Guard towards him; and resolved though she did make use of him yet, not by subjecting her self.\n\nNow he and the Prince of Condé, observing withal a potent League was pre∣paring to attack them, believed it was lawful to joyn the German Princes to their party, since their Adversaries had taken the Spaniards into them. The Duke of Guise and the Cardinal his Brother having notice of it, labour'd with great assi∣duity to prevent such assistance: themselves went to Savern to discourse with the Duke of Virtemberg, from whom the Prince hoped to get a considerable par∣ty. They craftily feigned a great propensity to Luthers Doctrine, and made him believe that if they had but some good correspondence with the German Princes, who generally were of that Church, they would bring both the Catho∣licks and Zuinglians to reason, and by that means restore the Church to Unity. The Duke of Wirtemberg was cajolled with this specious pretence, and sell from the Huguenots the more readily, for that in truth the Lutherans hate them but little less then the Roman Catholicks do themselves.\n\nAt his return from Saverne, the Duke of Guise having sojourned some days at his Castle of Joinville, was desired by his Confederates to come speedily to Paris, because the Huguenots being countenanc'd by the Regent, the Prince of Condé, the Admiral, and their Governor the Mareschal de Montmorency, would needs be uppermost. They were permitted to Preach in the Fauxbourg Saint Merceau and in that of Saint Antoine, the Chevalier du Guet, or Captain of the Watch, had order to Guard them with his Archers, and they had disarm'd the people of Paris, for fear they should run open-Mouth upon them; which had so raised their cou∣rage, that the Priests could not carry the Holy Sacrament along the Streets without danger of an up-roar.\n\n[month March.] About the latter end of the foregoing year there hap'ned a great Tumult in the Fauxbourg Saint Marceau, where they broke open the Church Doors of Saint Medard, pull'd down the Images, kill'd divers persons, and dragged the Priests most shamefully to Prison, because some Catholicks had abused a man, whom they sent to bid them leave off jangling their Bells, which hindred their hearing the Minister. The Parliament having taken Information upon complaint of either party, found the Huguenots guilty, and punish't their insolency with the death of two or three of them.\n\nNow the first day of March, as the Duke of Guise was passing thorough the little Town of Vassy, it hap'ned that some quarrel arose between some that were of his Train, and the Huguenots who held their meeting in a Grange, and he going thither to pacifie them, was wounded on the Cheek with a stone. His people seeing his face all bloody, their rage grew to such a height, that they slew near threescore of them, and wounded above two hundred. This is what the Huguenots have called the Massacre of Vassy, and which in effect proved as it were the first signal to all those bloody Wars for Religion which afterwards af∣flicted this unhappy Reign, though it were a pure accident, without any design or fault in the Duke of Guise.\n\nAfter he had taken with him the Cardinal his Brother in his passage by Reims, he came to Mantueil: his friends came to him in Crowds, and the Constable sent to Complement him. In the mean time the Prince of Condé was gone to Monceaux, to make Complaint to the King about the Murthers at Vassy. The Regent found her self mightily perplext, She promised the Huguenots to do them justice, wrote to the King of Navarre who was at Paris, to provide for the safety of the King and Kingdom, sent for the Duke of Guise to come to Court without any Company, and enjoyned the Mareschal de Saint André to repair to his Govern∣ment of Lyonnois. But the Navarrois sharply reproved the Huguenot Deputies who carried him the complaints from those of Vassy; the Duke of Guise replyed that he was busie and could not yet appear at Court, and the Mareschal told the Queen to her face, that in the posture things then stood, he could not abandon the Kings Person.\n\ndescription Page 680\n\n[Year of our Lord 1562. March.] Shortly after the Duke of Guise came to Paris attended by a Thousand or Twelve Hundred Horse. His Enemies would have made it a Crime de Laesae Ma∣jestatis for having Marched in by the Gate Saint Denis, thorough which the Kings make usually their Entry, as likewise because the Prevost des Marchands, and the Eschevins who went out to meet him made him a Speech, and the People made loud Shouts and Acclamations as to the King.\n\nIt is not credible the Queen had any suspition that the Duke aimed at the Crown: but she imagined that he and his Confederates intended to snatch the Government out of her hands. This apprehension putting her into extream trouble, she had recourse to the Prince of Condé, who was retired to his House, and wrote several Letters to recommend her Son to him, as likewise the King∣dome, and her self with expressions so affectionate and so full of Compassion, hint∣ing that the Confederates kept her in Captivity, as gave him just cause to arm himself, though he had not had the least inclination to it.\n\nTheir principal aim was to bring the King back to Paris, that they might have him entirely at their devotion. The Prevost des Marchands who was for them, came to Melun to request it of the Queen, and demand the Parisians might have their Armes again restored, to defend themselves against the Huguenots. The last particular was granted, and the other was promised in time convenient; mean while the Confederates so contrived it that the Commission for the Go∣vernment of Paris was given to the Cardinal de Bourbon, the Mareschal de Mont∣morency being suspected by them.\n\nWhen the Parisians had recover'd their Armes again, the Prince of Condé was the weaker and durst not Challenge the upper hand, or dispute the Wall with the Triumvirs: but to salve these sores, a Composition was made by means of the Cardinal his Brother: That the Heads of both Parties should leave the Town at the same time. He therefore retired to his House de la Ferté-Aucou near M••aux, and the Duke of Guise went to Fountainbleau where the King was, carrying so great a Convoy along with him, that he made the Queen quickly sen∣sible his Forces were much more numerous then the Princes.\n\nShe was gone thither, amidst her irresolution which she ought to chuse, either to cast her self into the Arms of the Prince and follow him to Orleans, for he was to be there upon her first notice, or to suffer her self to be carried to Paris by the Confederates. Either of these made her a Captive, the first was the more odious, because of the great peril she would have put the Catholick Religion into, and the latter appeared to her the more dangerous.\n\n[month March.] She would willingly have been in a Capacity of keeping them in equal balance on both hands, and for that purpose had sent for the Prince, who having gotten his friends together; was Travelling towards her and had passed over the River at Saint Cloud. His approach put the Parisians in Arms, as if they might have been besieged by a handful of Men, and gave occasion to the Confederates to let the Queen know it was necessary to remove the King to Paris, lest he should fall into the Huguenots hands. The King of Navarre carried her this unwelcome Message, and she seeming to hesitate, he told her plainly that if she were not pleased to go along with them, she might stay behind. She had not leasure to consider upon it, but must follow or else loose the Party: for at the same mo∣ment they carried the weeping King to Melun, the next day to Bois de Vincennes, and then to Paris.\n\nThus were all Addresses from that Queen fruitless, and all the prudent Coun∣sels of the Chancellor de l'Hospital, which tended but to prevent a Civil War, that he foresaw would be inevitable as soon as ever the King was in the hands of either Party.\n\n[Year of our Lord 1562. April.] In effect, the Prince of Condé, partly out of spight and revenge for having been deluded by a Woman, (for so he guessed it,) partly anger to see his Ene∣mies Masters of the Kings Person, and fear likewise of being left to their Mercy, or suffer the zeal of his Friends and the Huguenot Party to grow cold, ran post hast with two thousand Horse to Orleans, where Dandelot had slily seized upon one of the Gates the day before, which was the first of April.\n\nThis was as it were the place of Armes and Capital Seat of all his Party. Now to keep them in Unity and under good Discipline, the only bonds necessa∣ry to all establishments, he took an Oath from all that were there; That they would remain united for the defence of the Kings Person, and of the Queens, for the reformation and the benefit of the State; That they should lead a Life with∣out\n\ndescription Page 681\n\nreproach and Christian-like observe the Laws of the Land and Military [Year of our Lord 1562] Rules, and should take care to provide Ministers to Preach the word of God to them; That they should own him for their Head, should obey all his Orders, serve him with their Persons, and should furnish him with Armes and Money.\n\nHe afterwards wrote to all the German Princes, setting forth the cause of his taking up Arms, and then sent the Queen Mothers Original Letters, to perswade them thereby to send him some Assistance, and lend a friendly and helping hand to redeem both the King and her from their Captivity. At the same time he published a Manifesto to all the Kingdom to the same purpose, and some dayes after sent after it the Copy, whether real, or supposed, of a League made between the Pope, the King of Spain, and the Guises, to exterminate all the Sectaries of the new Religion.\n\n[month April.] This was a strong motive to draw those Princes to his side who made professi∣on of it, and to retain and bind fast to him the Huguenots of France: for the Kings Council, thinking to dis-unite, or lull them asleep by a deceitful security, put out a Declaration upon the very same day directed only to their Bailiffs and their Lieutenants, which confirmed the Edict of January, granted Indemnity for all that was past, forbid the molesting or doing them any injury for matters of Religion, and gave them the Liberty of exercising the same in all places, excepting within the City and Suburbs of Paris.\n\nWhen the Prince had declar'd himself, the Officers that took his part, and the Huguenots of themselves, seized upon several Cities, as Mans, Angers, Vendosme, la Charité upon the Loire, Angoulesme, Lyons, Valence, Romans, and almost all those in Daufiné, a great number of those in Guyenne, and Languedoc: In Nor∣mandy, upon Rouen, Caen, Dieppe, Havre de Grace, Bayeux, Saint Lo, Vire, Falaise, and many others. Matignon the Kings Lieutenant in that Province under the Duke of Bouillon who was Governor, saved Granville and Cherbourg. This was a signal Service, for those Ports would have given an easie entrance to the Eng∣lish.\n\nWherever the Huguenots were Masters, they utterly abolished the exercise of the Catholick Religion, overturn'd the Altars, broke the Images in pieces, burn∣ed the Reliques, and cast the ashes into the Air, Tormented and Massacred the Monks and Priests, not observing that equality and moderation herein, which they expected should be measured to themselves, but rendring their Party execra∣ble to the People by the horrible profanation of all things Sacred. The Prince neither by Intreaties, nor by Remonstrances, nor even by punishment, had pow∣er to stop their fury, which he knew must be very prejudicial to his cause. And indeed they were even with them in many Cities, where they Massacred huge numbers, as particularly at Cahors, Sens, Amiens and at Beauvais; and their pul∣ling down and plundering continuing, the Parliament by a Decree of the last of June, enjoyned all persons, to fall upon them and destroy and slay them in all places wherever they should find them, as People that were mad, and declared Enemies both to God and Man.\n\nThough all the Kingdom were in a flame, the Chancellor a right good French∣man, endeavour'd to remedy that evil he could not prevent, and sought wayes for an Accommodation, which did not seem impossible to him, since their Forces had not yet engaged, nor any Blood as yet been drawn but what was spilt in Tu∣mults and Seditions. The Queen consider'd likewise, finding the Huguenots Ma∣sters of so many places that the Triumvirs might seize upon the rest, and so both her Son the King and she, might be wholly stripped of all: and therefore she sent the Baron de la Garde to find out the Prince, and intreat him earnestly to come to Court, assuring him that whatsoever had been done against the Prote∣stants, was much against her will, and that with his Assistance she would endeavour to repair it.\n\nThe Prince began to listen to it, and was inclined to condescend, when news was brought him, that the Huguenots coming out of Church at Sens, were all Massacred, and their Houses saccaged by the Soldiers, the fault whereof was charged upon the Cardinal de Lorrain, Archbishop of that City. The Prince having heard the particulars said to his People that they must hope for nothing now but from God and their own Courage; They then caused white Cassocks of Cloth to be made for all their Cavalry, and endeavour'd to animate and keep up their Spirits by Printing several little Books, some for their Justification, others to bespatter the House of Guise, and particularly the Cardinal de Lorrain.\n\ndescription Page 682\n\n[Year of our Lord 1562] Yet there were many Envoyez, and propositions sent from the one to the other. The Prince demanded the Edict of Januar"
