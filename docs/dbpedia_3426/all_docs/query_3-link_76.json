        "text": "The recreation of the face of a king from his skull is the most subjective, and thus controversial, technique in the field of forensic anthropology. Despite this, positive identification can be established when a unique set of biological characteristics are present.This type of identification has recently proved its interest in discovering \"lost” historical figures of Henry IV and the ‘Temple Child’ considered as a missing-link in the case of Louis XVII. The forensic sciences involve numerous sciences and techniques to produce a true identification: anthropology, pathology, odontology, DNA as well as history. But you have to probe the truths of history, get the facts. In search of the true head of Henri IV, Gino Fornaciari of the University of Pisa questions the medical point of view of the identification as well as the historic record since it was said that the exhumations of the French kings in Saint Denis in October 1793 revealed that the skull of Henri IV had been sawed. And, precisely, the identified skull had not been sawed. However, Jacqueline Vons recall that the report of the visit of the body observed that “Almost all (surgeons) have found the only wound and necessary cause of death”. It was no need to saw the skull and, because it was the custom not to alter the kings head of France, indeed he probably was not sawed. http://umr6576.cesr.univ-tours.fr/publications/HasardetProvidence/fichiers/pdf/Vons.pdf Superimposition was the technique of identification of Henri IV because investigators had good knowledge about the supposed identity of the skull. The method is opposed to reconstruction as it was the case for the Temple Child skeletal remains that are completely unknown¨. Forensic superimpositions practiced for Henri IV have been declared relevant having anatomical skull features of the face aligned accurately to a funerary mask and a statue kept at Pau. But Franco Rollo, Professor of Physical Anthropology, find that: “Unfortunately, as far as one can judge on the basis of the published figures, the … comparison evidences several elements of incompatibility between skull and plaster mould, namely in the forehead curve, the depth of the nasal bridge, the shape and projection of the nasal bones. These are precisely the areas indicated (by Austin Smith and Maples) to be of particular importance for comparison on lateral photographs.\" Forensic reconstructions are only produced to aid the process of identification. Louis XVII supposedly died in the Temple prison during the Revolution at the age of 10 victim to tuberculosis in 1795. The remains of the alleged Louis XVII were dug up and photographed and a 2D reconstructed portrait made resembling the painting made by Joseph-Marie Vien in 1793. The paint is considered to be the one of a substituted boy aged between 13 and 16 that render a possible hypothesis that Louis XVII was replaced. A position that raises the question: what happened to Louis XVII?"
