        "text": "This paper aims to contribute to the discussion in the rich field of studies on Mediterranean slavery, a subject that in recent years has been object of a lively historiographical debate: a number of books and studies have shed light on the different causes, dynamics, places and protagonists of that phenomenon. In the centuries of the early-modern age, thousands of people were captured by corsairs and pirates in the Mediterranean and were reduced to slavery in the land of «infidels»: once fallen prisoners, they were sold, compelled to forced labour, to the oar in galleys, or destined to be rescued trough ransom. It is estimated that this phenomenon affected a total of about 1.200.000 people , who experienced slavery (even of short duration) on either side of the Mediterranean: both in Europe and in the Ottoman dominions slaves could eventually regain their freedom, either by exchange with prisoners on the other side or, as said, by the payment of a ransom fare. Charitable institutions and religious orders such as Trinitarians and Mercedarians were involved in the ransom of Christian slaves in the Ottoman Empire. In the Italian context, it was mainly charitable institutions or city magistrates who dealt with the task of captives ransom: these institutions operated essentially on a local or regional basis (Naples, Genoa, Palermo, Venice, Rome), given the context of the ancient pre-unitary States. One may argue that this kind of captives ransoming, institutionalized and locally-based, can be considered as of a ‘laical’ or ‘secular’ model, given that national arguments and economic interests laid behind that humanitarian endeavor, much more than Christian charity, which the friars of the religious orders always appealed to. Nevertheless, the religious element (faith and hope of redemption), as well as the insistence on the charitable purpose are always present in all the letters that the captives wrote both to their kin and to local institutions to ask for help. This paper attempts to reconstruct the activity of one of the institutions charged with the redemption of captives in the Spanish Vice-Kingdom of Naples. After a brief introduction on slavery and the captives ransom economy in the early-modern Mediterranean (17th-18th cc.), I will focus on captives redemption in Southern Italy and Sicily, also showing some short extracts from significant documents on slaves ransoms. I will analyze in particular the case of the Neapolitan Pio Monte della Misericordia ,following step by step the various passages needed to organize and send a ransom mission, from money collection to the instructions given to recognized agents and mediators, or the contracts signed by individual rescuers. A few examples from the documentation will help us to reveal the financing, dynamics and strategies adopted by all the actors involved in that peculiar kind of human trafficking across the Mediterranean, as well as to understand how difficult it could be for those captives to recover their freedom."
