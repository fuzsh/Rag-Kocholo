        "text": "Ancestors of Caden Michael Norquist\n\nThirty-fifth Generation\n\n32177447804. William De WARENNE 1st Earl Of Surrey,2091,2188 son of Rodulf (Ralph) II De WARENNE and Emma, was born before 1037 in Varenne Near Bellencombre, Seine-Inferieure, Normandy, France,2188,2189 died on 24 June 1088 in Lewes, Sussex, England (From Wounds At Siege Of Pevensey) 2091,2188, and was buried in Priory Of Lewes, Sussex, England.2188 Another name for William was 01st Earl Of SURREY William De Warenne.\n\nGeneral Notes: EARLDOM OF SURREY (I) 1088\n\nWILLIAM DE WARENNE was 1st son of Rodulf II by Emma. At some time in or after 1054 Duke William gave him the castle of Mortemer, which had been forfeited by his kinsman, Roger de Mortimer, after the Battle of Mortemer in February of that year. Probably at the same time he acquired lands at Bellencombre, the castle of which became the caput of the Warenne barony in Normandy. In 1066 he was one of the Norman barons summoned by the Duke to a Council on hearing that Harold had been crowned King after the death of the Confessor. He took part in the invasion of England and was present at the Battle of Hastings. He was rewarded with lands in 13 counties (j), including most of the rape of Lewes in Sussex, the manor of Conisborough, co. York, and Castle Acre and a number of holdings in Norfolk. In 1067 he was one of the Norman nobles whom the Conqueror left in England to support his vice-regents, William FitzOsbern and the Bishop of Bayeux. In 1075 he was one of the two chief justiciars who were in charge of England when the Earls of Hereford and Norfolk rebelled and who summoned them to the King's court, and on their refusal crushed the rebellion (b). About 1083-85 he was fighting for the King in Maine (c). In the spring of 1088 he supported William II against the rebels led by the Bishop of Bayeux and the Count of Mortain, and to secure his loyalty he was created, shortly after Easter (16 April) 1088, EARL OF SURREY (e), his immediate successors being styled more usually EARLS DE WARENNE. He was mortally wounded at the siege of Pevensey before the end of May. He founded Lewes priory as a cell of Cluny abbey, about 1078-82.\n\nHe married, 1stly, Gundred, sister of Gerbod the Fleming, EARL OF CHESTER, possibly daughter of Gerbod, hereditary advocate of the Abbey of St. Bertin at St. Omer. She died in child-birth, 27 May 1085, at Castle Acre, Norfolk, and was buried the chapter-house at Lewes. He married, 2ndly, [----], sister of Richard GUET (living 1098). He died 24 June 1088, apparently from the effect of his wound at Pevensey, at Lewes, and was buried there beside his wife.

This was the only earldom created before the reign of Stephen of which the holder did not take his title from the county in which lay his chief territorial strength. However, it is likely that with the Earldom he was given lands at Reigate in Surrey.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------\n\n[From \"The Origins of Some Anglo-Norman Families\"]\n\nFor this identification see Mr. Loyd's paper 'The Origin of the Family of Warenne' in Yorkshire Arch. Journal, vol. xxxi, pp. 97-113. The hamlet of Varenne lies on the river Varenne c. 2 miles S of Arques and c. 13 miles N of Bellencombre. The latter place, arr. Dieppe, cant. Bellencombre, where there was a castle, became the caput of the Warenne honour in Normandy.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------\n\nWilliam Warenne was one of those followers of William of Normandy who made their fortunes by the conquest of England. The younger son of Rudulf of Varenne in Normandy, he distinguished himself in ducal service as a very young man in the early 1050s. After the ducal victory at Mortemer (1054) he received estates in upper Normandy, but it was only after the English invasion that he attained the front rank. He fought at Hastings and was rewarded with lands which by 1086 extended into thirteen counties, most notably strategically important estates in Sussex centered round Lewes. By the end of William I's reign he was one of the dozen largest individual landowners in England. He repaid his debt with vigorous loyalty in both England and France. In 1075 he played a leading role in suppressing the revolt of the earls of Hereford and Norfolk. After the Conqueror's death, Warenne supported William Rufus in 1087-88 against Robert Curthose and Odo of Bayeux. Rufus encouraged his service by creating him earl of Surrey in 1088. The same year Warenne was seriously wounded by an arrow in his leg at the siege of Pevensey and died at his foundation of Lewes Priory on 24 June 1088.\n\nWarenne's career was more than meteoric. A younger son of an obscure minor Norman nobleman, he had risen through conspicuous loyalty to his lord to become not only one of the richest men in one of the richest kingdoms of Europe but also the founder of a dynasty which, powerful, wealthy and influential, survived as earl of Surrey until 1347. Warenne's foundation at Lewes (1078/80) was the first Cluniac house in England, another sign of the Conquest's effect on establishing institutional as well as personal links across the Channel. Warenne's success depended on the traditional chivalric virtues of loyalty, bravery and prowess in arms. His life illustrates the stupendous prizes and the personal dangers on offer to those who joined the conquest of England. It was appropriate that Warenne's direct descendent, John De Warenne, Earl of Surrey (1231-1304), when challenged in 1278 by royal commissioners to produce title to his land, produced an old rusty sword declaring, 'Here, my Lord, is my warrant (warrantus: a pun which no doubt appealed to the somewhat intractable sense of honour of the time). My ancestors came with William the Bastard and won their lands with the sword, and by the sword I will hold them against all comers.' Earl John won his case. William of Warenne would have approved. [Who's Who in Early Medieval England, Christopher Tyerman, Shepheard-Walwyn, Ltd., London, 1996]\n\n----------\n\nWilliam de Warrenne, Earl of Warrenne, in Normandy, a near kinsman of William the Conqueror, came into England with that prince and, having distinguished himself at the battle of Hastings, obtained an immense portion of the public spoliation. He had large grants of land in several counties, amongst which were the Barony of Lewes, in Sussex, and the manors of Carletune and Benington, in Lincolnshire. So extensive indeed were those grants that his possessions resembled more the dominions of a sovereign prince than the estates of a subject. He enjoyed, too, in the highest degree, the confidence of the king, and was appointed joint justice-general with Richard de Benefactis for administering justice throughout the whole realm. While in that office, some great disturbers of the public peace having refused to appear before him and his colleague in obedience to citation, the Earl took up arms and defeated the rebels in a battle at Fagadune, when he is said, for the purpose of striking terror, to have cut off the right foot of each of his prisoners. Of those rebels, Ralph Wahir or Guarder, Earl of Norfolk, and Roger, Earl of Hereford, were the ringleaders. His lordship was likewise highly esteemed by King William Rufus, and was created by that monarch Earl of Surrey. He m. Gundred, dau. of the Conqueror*, and had issue, William, Reginald, Gundred-Edith, and another dau. who m. Ernise de Colungis.\n\nThis potent noble built the castle of Holt and founded the priory at Lewes, in Sussex. He resided principally at the castle of Lewes, and had besides Castle-Acre, in Norfolk, and noble castles at Coningsburg and Sandal. He d. 24 June, 1088, and Dugdale gives to following curious account of his parting hour. \"It is reported that this Earl William did violently detain certain lands from the monks of Ely, for which, being often admonished by the abbot, and not making restitution, died miserably. And, though his death happened very far off the isle of Ely, the same night he died, the abbot lying quietly in his bed and meditating on heavenly things, heard the soul of this earl, in its carriage away by the devil, cry out loudly and with a known and distinct voice, Lord have mercy on me; Lord have mercy on me. And, moreover, that the next day after, the abbot acquainted all the monks in chapter therewith. And likewise, that about four days after, there came a messenger to them from the wife of this earl with 100 shillings for the good of his soul, who told them that he died the very hour that the abbot had heard the outcry. But that neither the abbot nor any of the monks would receive it, not thinking it safe for them to take the money of a damned person. If this part of the story as to the abbot's hearing the noise be no truer than the last, viz., that his lady sent them 100 shillings, I shall deem it to be a mere fiction, in regard the lady was certainly dead about three years before.\" The earl was s. by his elder son, William de Warenne. [Sir Bernard Burke, Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited, and Extinct Peerages, Burke's Peerage, Ltd., London, 1883, p. 568, Warren, Earls of Surrey]\n\n* At one time, it was thought that Gundred was the daughter of William the Conqueror. This has since been disproved. For details, see \"Early Yorkshire Charters\" by C. T. Clay, or \"Études sur Quelques Points de l'Historie de Guillaume le Conquérant\" by H. Prentout. [Brian Tompsett, Directory of Royal Genealogical Data, University of Hull, Hull, UK, \"Electronic,\" royal01389]\n\nWilliam married Gundred Of FLANDERS 1011,2091,2092 before 1077 in Normandy, France.2091 Gundred was born about 1052 in Ghent, Flanders, died on 27 May 1085 in Castle Acre, Norfolk, England (In Childbirth) 2091,2092 about age 33, and was buried in Priory Of Lewes, Sussex, England.

Another name for Gundred was Gundreda De GAND.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nGundred (daughter of Gherbod the Fleming), d. 27 May 1085; m. bef. 1077, William de Warenne, d. Lewes 24 June 1088, created 1st Earl of Surrey, son of Rudolf de Warenne and Beatrice. [Magna Charta Sureties]\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nHe married, 1stly, Gundred, sister of Gerbod the Fleming, EARL OF CHESTER, possibly daughter of Gerbod, hereditary advocate of the Abbey of St. Bertin at St. Omer. She died in child-birth, 27 May 1085, at Castle Acre, Norfolk, and was buried the chapter-house at Lewes. [Complete Peerage XII/1:493-5, XIV:604 (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]\n\nNote: I think that Gundred was daughter of Gerbod the Fleming, Earl of Chester. He was also advocate of the Abbey of St. Bertin of St. Omer (as CP itself indicated-see notes under Gherbod) . As far as I know there is only one Gerbod.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to Magna Charta Sureties (and CP in a way), a daughter of Gherbod the Fleming. According to the Plantagenet Ancestry, a daughter of William the Conquerer and Matilda of Flanders. The following discussion in soc.genealogy.medieval illustrates the proof for Gundred being daughter of Matilda, wife of William I, and also the controversy still being debated about her ancestry. I happen to believe that the Lewes Chartulary is not false on the basis that there is no reason for forging a relationship to Queen Maud, but not King William I.\n\nFrom: Phil Moody ([email protected])\n\nSubject: Re: tombstone of Gundrad, wife of William de Warenne\n\nNewsgroups: soc.genealogy.medieval\n\nDate: 2002-12-30 21:52:15 PST\n\n\"Chris PHILLIPS\" wrote\"\n\n> There was never any question of Gundred being an illegitimate daughter of\n\n> William I, but rather it was a case of a fraudulent claim that she was a\n\n> legitimate daughter.

Per your earlier assistance to me; I do now have \"The Chartulary of the Priory of St. Pancras of Lewes\", vol. I, ed. L. F. Salzman, and published by the Sussex Record Society in 1032 [sic?]. There is a lengthy charter by William Warrene nearly six pages in length; so I will not quote it's entirety, but this bit is curious.\n\nPage 3:\n\n\"..., I have given for the welfare of my soul and that of Gundrada my wife and for the soul of my lord King William who brought me into England and by whose license I caused the monks to come and who confirmed my former gift, and for the welfare of my lady Queen Maud the mother of my wife and for the welfare of my lord King William his son after whose coming to England I made this charter and who made me Earl of Surrey,...\" UNQ\n\nPLM: It is quite clear from this charter, that Gundrada is the daughter of Queen Maud, and the lack of a reference to William I being the father of Gundrada is highly significant. If I were to rely solely on this evidence, I would have to conclude that Gundrada was NOT the daughter of William I at all.\n\nPeople have referred to forged charters from Lewes, but what is the basis of these assertions, and which references discuss these \"supposedly proven forgeries\"? The premise of such an accusation appears to be up side down, in relation to the above charter. It seems illogical to forge a document that makes Gundrada the daughter of the Queen, as opposed to the King of England; which would essentially diminish her social standing, instead of elevating it, as most forgeries tend to do?\n\nCheers,\n\nPhil\n\n- - - - -\n\nFrom: Chris PHILLIPS ([email protected])\n\nSubject: Re: tombstone of Gundrad, wife of William de Warenne\n\nNewsgroups: soc.genealogy.medieval\n\nDate: 2002-12-31 01:54:55 PST\n\nPaul Reed posted a quite detailed summary of the arguments that the charter was spurious, on 11 March 1998, entitled: \"Gundred, the Conqueror, and the spurious charter of 1085 (LONG)\".\n\nApart from the internal evidence that the charter has been tampered with, and the existence of a copy of the foundation charter, which doesn't mention Gundred's parentage, in the cartulary of Cluny, the parent house, there are also statements by two other sources that Gundred was the brother of Gerbod. Admittedly these could be circumvented by the suggestion that Gundred was only William's step-daughter, and that Gerbod's father had previously been married to Matilda (although there is no indication elsewhere that this was the case, despite quite a lot of documentation relating to Gerbod's family, and of course to the counts of Flanders).\n\nWhat clinched the long-running Victorian controversy was the point made by Chester Waters, that when a marriage was proposed between an illegitimate daughter of Henry I and a son of Gundred, it was prohibited on the grounds of a 4th/6th-generation consanguinity. If Gundred had been Matilda's daughter they would have been first cousins, so this, rather than the much more distant relationship, would surely have been mentioned.\n\nChris Phillips\n\n- - - - - -\n\nFrom: Linda ([email protected])\n\nSubject: Re: tombstone of Gundrad, wife of William de Warenne\n\nNewsgroups: soc.genealogy.medieval\n\nDate: 2002-12-31 08:52:44 PST\n\nAs with other \"proof\", I am curious about how conclusive Mr. Waters' arguement is. People being the political animals that they are, it would seem to me that a closer relationship might not be mentioned if it were politically sensitive for some reason. I have no thoughts on what that might be, but Mr. Waters' arguement, while persuasive, still does not seem to me to CONCLUSIVELY prove anything, simply because we cannot possibly know everything was going on in people's minds 1000 years ago (or today, for that matter).\n\nI guess it's my background in math and computers that makes me question these things. It does not seem to me that either side of this controversy has anything that could be considered absolute proof - just circumstantial evidence and theories, all of which can be contested with more theories. There seem to be plenty of sincere and knowledgeable people on both sides of the issue, and I wonder if, barring discovery of new documentation, the issue will ever be resolved. I keep going back to that tombstone - the only piece of evidence that is truly \"cast in stone\".\n\n- - - - - -\n\nNote: I happen to feel that Chester Water's analysis which invalidates the Chartulary is not altogether conclusive. The fact remains that the marriage WAS invalidated on the grounds of consanguinity; quite possibly for political reasons the church chose a more distant relationship for invalidating the marriage (4th or 6th cousin rather than 1st cousin); the church may not have wanted to emphasize the illegitimacy of Gundred, ancestor of the Warennes, a very powerful family.\n\nGundred married William De WARENNE 1st Earl Of Surrey 2091,2188 before 1077 in Normandy, France.2091 William was born before 1037 in Varenne Near Bellencombre, Seine-Inferieure, Normandy, France,2188,2189 died on 24 June 1088 in Lewes, Sussex, England (From Wounds At Siege Of Pevensey) 2091,2188, and was buried in Priory Of Lewes, Sussex, England.2188 Another name for William was 01st Earl Of SURREY William De Warenne.\n\n32177447806.

But the 1101 date is clearly correct, because Hugh died of wounds after the battle in which a Crusader force was annihilated at Heraklea (Asia Minor) in late September of 1101. There is no mistaking the year, in the chronology of the first Crusade's aftermath. Runciman (2:28-29) does not provide a precise date for that battle, but it was one of three major failures of Western forces the Summer and Fall of 1101. See generally his _History of the Crusades_, vol. 2, chapter 2, \"The Crusades of 1101.\" On the battle at Heraklea, he says:\n\n\"Early in September they [see below] entered Heraclea, which they found deserted as Konya had been. Just beyond the town flowed the river, one of the few Anatolian streams to flow abundantly throughout the summer. The Christian warriors, half-mad from thirst, broke their ranks to rush to the welcoming water. But the Turkish army lay concealed in the thickets on the river banks. As the crusaders surged on in disorder, the Turks sprang out on them and surrounded them. There was no time to reform ranks. Panic spread through the Christian army. Horsemen and infantry were mixed in a dreadful stampede; and as they stumbled in their attempt to flee they were slaughtered by the enemy. The duke of Aquitaine, followed by one of his grooms, cut his way out and rode into the mountains. After many days of wandering through the passes he found his way to Tarsus. Hugh of Vermandois was badly wounded in the battle; but some of his men rescued him and he too reached Tarsus. But he was a dying man. His death took place on 18 October and they buried him there in the Cathedral of St Paul. He never fulfilled his vow to go to Jerusalem. Welf of Bavaria only escaped by throwing away all his armer. After several weeks he arrived with two or three attendants at Antioch. Archbishop Thiemo [of Salzburg] was taken prisoner and martyred for his faith. The fate of the Margravine of Austria is unknown. Later legends said that she ended her days ia captive in a far-off harem, where she gave birth to the Moslem hero Zengi. More probably she was thrown from her litter in the panic and trampled to death.\"\n\nRunciman cites Albert of Aachen, 8.34-40 (pp. 579-82 in the edition he cites); and Ekkehard, 24-26 (pp. 30-32), among other material on the legend of the the Margravine of Austria, etc.\n\nNat Taylor\n\nHugh married Adelaide De VERMANDOIS 1869,2192,2194 in 1067 in 1st Husband.2194 Adelaide was born about 1057 in Valois Now Oise, Picardy, France and died on 28 September 1120 in Vermandois, Aisne, Picardy, France 2192,2194 about age 63.\n\nChildren from this marriage were:\n\n16088777679 i.

Ralph De MORTIMER Lord Of Wigmore,415,2059,2203 son of Roger De MORTIMER and Hawise De VEXIN, was born about 1058 in Saint-Victor-En-Caux, Seine-Inferieure, Normandy, France and died after 5 August 1104 in Wigmore, Ludlow, Herefordshire, England 2059,2203.\n\nGeneral Notes: RALPH DE MORTIMER, son and heir [of Roger by Hawise], succeeded his father before 1086, when he appears in Domesday Book as tenant in chief in twelve counties. His possessions lay largely in Herefordshire and Shropshire, Wigmore in the former county being the caput of the honour. Both Wigmore and Cleobury, in Shropshire, had belonged to William FitzOsbern, Earl of Hereford, and the grant must therefore have been later than the forfeiture of William's son Roger in 1074. He attested a notification by William I between 1078 and 1087. On 30 March 1088 he witnessed a grant made by his man Ralph FitzAnseré to the abbey of Jumiegès. In that year he, Bernard de Neufmarché, and Roger de Lacy, at the head of a large body of English, Norman and Welsh fighting men, attacked Worcester with the avowed intention of burning the town and pillaging the church. The Bishop's men marched out and defeated them on the other side of the Severn. In 1089 he was one of the barons of Eastern Normandy who sided with William Rufus against Robert Curthose, but between 1091 and 1095 he is found (at Lisieux) witnessing with Duke Robert a charter for Jumièges. He made a grant to the monks of Worcester with the assent of his sons (unnamed) and his men. In 1104. he adhered to Henry I against Duke Robert. This is the last mention found of him, and the date of death is unknown.\n\nHe married, 1stly, Melisande, who was dead before 30 March 1088, and, 2ndly, Mabel (g). [Compete Peerage IX:267-8, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]\n\n(g) Stephen, Count of Aumale, by a charter circa 1100, with the consent of Hawise his wife and of Ralph de Mortimer her father, granted the church of Airaines (Somme) of the inheritance of Ralph and Hawise to the priory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs, Paris, mentioning Melisande, Ralph's deceased wife. The charter of 30 Mar 1088 referred to above is subscribed 'Signum Radulfi Filii Rogeri Morte maris Signum Mabilie uxoris eius'. Hawise was clearly the daughter of Melisande; and as she must have been born before 1088, Melisande would be Ralph's first wife. William, brother of Hugh, witnesses his charter for Saint-Victor, but he occurs low in the list of witnesses and was probably illegitimate. There is no evidence as to which wife was mother of Hugh.\n\nNote: It seems that most people on SGM assume that Hugh is the son by the 2nd wife.\n\n-----------------------\n\nRalph de Mortimer, the presumed son of Roger de Mortimer, accompanying the Duke of Normandy in his expedition against England, was one of his principal commanders at the decisive battle of Hastings; and shortly after, as the most puissant of the victor's captains, was sent into the marches of Wales to encounter Edric, Earl of Shrewsbury, who still resisted the Norman yoke. This nobleman, after much difficulty and a long siege in his castle of Wigmore, Mortimer subdued and delivered into the king's hands, when, as a reward for his good service, he obtained a grant of all Edric's estates and seated himself thenceforward at Wigmore. Independently of these great Welsh territorial possessions, Ralph Mortimer enjoyed, by the bounty of his royal master, sundry lordships and manors in other parts of the realm which he held at the time of the general survey. In the beginning of Rufus' reign, Mortimer took part with Curthose, but he subsequently changed sides and, being constituted general of the forces sent by King Henry I to oppose that prince in Normandy, he totally routed the enemy and brought Curthose prisoner to the king.

He was one of the commanders at the Battle of the Standard, in August 1138, and was, for his services, created Earl of Derby by King Stephen, shortly afterwards. He married Hawise, daughter of André, Seigneur de Vitré in Brittany, by Agnes, daughter of Robert, Count of Mortain. He died in 1139. [Complete Peerage IV:191, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]\n\n(c) . . . The lands in Normandy were eventually inherited by Henry de Ferrieres, his nephew (son and heir of one of his brothers, Engenulf or William). Henry, who was living in 1136, held Oakham, co. Rutland, and Lechlade, co. Gloucester (a manor held by his grandfather Henry at the Domesday Survey). He was father of Walkelin, who was father of (1) Henry, Seigneur de Chambres in 1202, (2) Hugh, of Lechlade, who dsp. in 1204, having m. Margaret, daughter and heir of Hugh de Say of Richard's Castle, and (3) Isabel (d. before 31 May 1252), who m., 1stly, Roger de Mortemer of Wigmore (d. 24 June 1214), and 2ndly, Piers fitz Herbert of Blaen Llyfni (d. 1 June 1235). Isabel inherited Lechlade, and also Oakham, which her eldest brother, Henry, had lost at the time of the conquest of Normandy. Henry was the ancestor of the seigneurs of Ferrieres and Chambrais, the last of whom, Jean, dspm. in 1504. A custom quite recently existed that a peer of the realm, the first time he passed through Oakham, should give a horse-shoe to be nailed upon the castle-gate; a toll or privilege dating, no doubt, from the time of the ancient lords of that town.\n\nNote: Most people on the internet have Robert being christened at \"Charterley, Staffs\". If he was born in 1062, it was certainly in Normandy; perhaps he was christened in England after 1066. Since there is no Charterley (any where, let alone in Staffordshire), they must be referring to the area of the town now known as Chartley Holme in Staffs (nearby Chartley Castle wasn't built until 1220 by Ranulph Blundeville, Earl of Chester). There were Ferrers who were Lords of Chartley later on, but that family received Chartley through the marriage of William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby, to Agnes of Chester, sister & heir of Ranulph Blundeville (Ranulph died without issue), so Chartley Castle was not inherited from the Ferrers of this period.\n\n----------------------------\n\nRobert de Ferrers, having contributed, at the head of the Derbyshire men, to King Stephen's victory over King David of Scotland at Northallerton (commonly called the battle of the Standard), was created by that monarch Earl of Derby.

William \"The Younger\" PEVEREL Of Nottingham,415,1900 son of William \"The Elder\" PEVEREL Of Nottingham and Adeline, was born in 1080 in Nottingham Castle, Nottinghamshire, England and died in 1155 in Bourn, Cambridgeshire, England at age 75.\n\nGeneral Notes: Complete Peerage, Appendix I.\n\nWilliam Peverel the younger, one of the principal supportors of KING STEPHEN, was a commander at the Battle of the Standard and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Lincoln. His estates were forfeited for a time, and his castle of Nottingham was committed by THE EMPRESS [MAUD] to William Paynel. He recovered it in 1143. His wives were Odonna and AVICE DE LANCASTRIA, who was presumably a daughter of Count Roger the Poitevin (cognomine Pictaviensis), Lord of the honour of Lancaster, by his wife Aumodis, Countess of La Marche. He had a son Henry, and a daughter, Margaret, eventually, or in her issue, his heir, and a wife of Robert, Earl of Ferrers.\n\nAbout March 1152/3 HENRY, Duke of Normandy [the future King HENRY II] and count of Anjou, by a charter expedited at Devizes, formulated what he was prepared to give to [RANULF DE GERNON] the Earl of Chester, as the price of his support; not indeed, even to the half of the kingdom, but yet no inconsiderable portion of it. It ought to be unnecessary to have to state that these extensive grants never took effect. Nine months afterwards, in Dec. 1153, THE EARL died, poisoned, as men said, by William Peverel.\n\nShortly after his accession to the throne, KING HENRY II visited Nottinghamshire, in order, as the annalists state, to disinherit William Peverel for having poisoned THE EARL, but more probably to punish him for what had previously been termed his wickedness and treason. William, on THE KING's approach, retired to one of his religious foundations where he became a monk. The honor of Peverel remained in the Crown for nearly half a century.

Miles Of GLOUCESTER 1st Earl Of Hereford,415,1330,2210,2211,2212 son of Walter FITZROGER Sheriff Of Gloucester and Emma De BALLON, was born in 1092 in Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England, died on 24 December 1143 in Shot While Hunting In Forest Of Dean, Gloucestershire, England 2211,2212,2213 at age 51, and was buried in Llanthony Without Gloucester Priory, Gloucestershire, England. Another name for Miles was 3rd\\1St Earl Of HEREFORD Miles Fitzwalter.\n\nGeneral Notes: In 1141, during the struggle between the Empress Maud and Stephen I for the throne the former conferred the Earldom of Hereford on Miles of Gloucester, so-called from his father being hereditary Constable of the shire. Only two years earlier the new Earl had supported Stephen, but it has been suggested that he went over to the Empress's in part because his overlord, the Earl of Gloucester, was one of Henry I's many bastard sons, hence Maud's half brother. (Her generous gifts to Miles of land, houses, and castles, in addition to the Earldom, may have helped win him over.) [Burke's Peerage]\n\n----------------------\n\nWilliam II \"Rufus\" King of England granted the lordship of \"Over Gwent\" which included a castle at the mouth of the Genny where it joins the Usk, probably some time after 1088 to one Hamelin de Ballon, so called from his having been born at Ballon, in Maine. Subsequent holders of Over Gwent or Abergavenny included the 1st and 2nd Earls of Hereford of the 1141 creation and the 2nd Earl's four younger brothers, for all of whom a shadowy family connection with Hamelin de Ballon has been claimed, though this is very hard, if not impossible, to sustain.

By charter dated at Rouen he was confirmed in all his father's lands held in chief with the office of constable. He accounted for Gloucestershire and Staffordshire in 1130-1. At the coming of Stephen he was one of the great magnates of the West of England, and after joining him received 2 charters, granting to him and his heirs his whole bonour of Gloucester and of Brecknock and all his lands and holdings in shrievalties and other things as he held them at the death of Henry I the second, which is more precise, mentions the constableship of Gloucester Castle. He attended the Easter Court of 1136 and witnessed Stephen's Charter of Liberties, as constable. He was present at the siege of Shrewsbury in 1138, but joined the Empress on her arrival in I I 39, recciving her at Bristol \"ut dominam,\" and taking her to Gloucester, where he did homage and received from her the castle of St. Briavell's and the whole Forest of Dean. He accompanied her to Winchester, to Reading, where he acted as her constable, and to London in 1141. At St. Albans, where she received a deputation from London, she had granted to him a house in Westminster which had belonged to Gregory, dapifer. He accompanied her in her flight to Gloucester, and was with her subsequently at Oxford, where on 25 July 1141 she created him EARL OF HEREFORD. After this creation at the request of Brien FitzCount and of Maud de Wallingford, his wife, she granted to him and his heirs the castle of Abergavenny and all the honour thereof to be held of the said Brien and Maud and their heirs in fee by the service of 3 knights' fees.\n\nHe married, as aforesaid, about April or May 1121, Sibyl, daughter of Bernard DE NEUFMARCHE, lord of Brecknock.

[Burke's Peerage]\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe well-known Roger de Beaumont held Sturminster Marshal, Dorset, in 1086; it descended to the counts of Meulan through Roger's eldest son, Robert count of Meulan. That Roger took his name from Beaumont is a part of the general history of Normandy. It follows that Roger's descendants, the counts of Meulan, the Earls of Leicester, and the Earls of Warwick, all derive from Beaumont-le-Roger. [The Origins of Some Anglo-Norman Families]\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nROGER DE BEAUMONT (de Bello Monte), SEIGNEUR of BEAUMONT AND PONT-AUDEMER, was eldest son of Humphrey. He appears to have remained faithful to the young Duke William during the disturbances of the earlier part of his reign, in the course of which he defeated and slew Roger de Tosny. He is said to have furnished 60 ships for the invasion of England. He did not accompany the expedition, but remained in Normandy as the principal adviser of the Duchess Maud, to whom the government of the duchy was entrusted. In 1071 the King committed Morcar as a prisoner to his custody. Up to the year 1082 he constantly appears as a witness to the charters of William the Conqueror. At the -time of the Domesday Survey, 1086, he held land in Dorset and co. Gloucester. About 1088 he founded the collegiate church of the Holy Trinity at Beaumont-le-Roger for canons of St. Frideswide of Oxford. He was a benefactor of St. Pierre-de-Préaux and of St. Wandrille.\n\nHe married Adeline, sister of Hugh and daughter of Waleran, COUNTS OF MEULAN. Shortly after 1090 Roger became a monk at the Abbey of Préaux. He died some years later, and was buried there with his father.

Another name for Richard was 01st Lord Of CLARE Richard De Clare.\n\nGeneral Notes: Richard Fitz Gilbert; also known as \"de Bienfaite\" (from the quantity of his fiefs [so states BP, but CP states Richard was lord of Bienfate & Orbec in Normandy]), \"de Clare\" or \"de Tonbridge\" (from actual fiefs); went with his cousin William I the Conqueror to England and was granted 176 Lordships, 95 of them associated with the Honour (feudal unit of administration) of Clare, Suffolk, and others with Tonbridge, Kent. [Burke's Peerage]\n\n-----------------------------\n\nObservations. In the times of the Heptarchy the border fortress of Clare (Suffolk), on the confines of the Kingdoms of East Anglia and Essex, was of the greatest importance, and continued to be so or many centuries afterwards, when, it was granted by the Conqueror to Richard FitzGilbert. FitzGilbert's successors the earlier Lords of Clare were, \"it is implied in the Lords' Reports [vol. iii, p. 124] and elsewhere, styled Earls of Clare before they were Earls of Hertford, but investigation disproves this,\" though doubtless, these Lords, after they obtained that Earldom, were according to the usage of the period, frequently styled \"Earls of Clare,\" just as the Earls of Derby were styled \"Earls Ferrers,\" &c. On account of the great importance of these feudal Barons, the earlier Lords of Clare, so frequently considered to have been actual Peers, a short account of them is subjoined, as under.\n\nHOLDERS OF THE HONOUR OF CLARE (I) temp. William I\n\nRICHARD FITZGILBERT, styled (from his possessions) \" DE BIENFAITE,\" \"DE CLARE,\" and \"DE TONBRIDGE, was son of Gilbert, COUNT OF BRIONNE in Normandy, which Gilbert was son and heir of Godfrey, COUNT OF BRIONNE, illegitimate son of Richard, DUKE OF NORMANDY. He was born before 1035, was Lord of Bienfaite and Orbec in Normandy, accompanied his kinsman, William the Conqueror, into England, and was rewarded by him with no less than 176 Lordships, of which 95 were in Suffolk, attached to the Honour of Clare, which honour,, with the Castle of Clare, as also the Castle of Tonbridge in Kent, he obtained, becoming thus Lord of Clare and of Tonbridge. During the King's absence he was joint Chief justiciar, and, as such, suppressed the revolt of 1075.\n\nHe married Rohese, daughter of Walter GIFFARD, the elder, and aunt and heir of Walter [GIFFARD], 2nd Earl of Buckingham, through which match his descendants became co-heirs to the lands of that family. He was living 1081, but appears to have died about 1090 being buried at St. Neots, co. Huntingdon. His widow was living, as such, 1113. [Complete Peerage III:242, XIV:183, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]\n\n-----------------------------\n\nRichard FitzGilbert, having accompanied the Conqueror into England, participated in the spoils of conquest and obtained extensive possessions in the new and old dominions of his royal leader and kinsman. In 1073 we find him joined under the designation of Ricardus de Benefacta, with William de Warren, in the great office of Justiciary of England, with whom, in three years afterwards, he was in arms against the rebellious lords Robert de Britolio, Earl of Hereford, and Ralph Waher, or Guarder, Earl of Norfolk and Suffolk, and behaved with great gallantry. But afterwards, at the time of the General Survey, which was towards the close of William's reign, he is called Ricardus de Tonebruge, from his seat at Tonebruge (now Tunbridge) in Kent, which town and castle he obtained from the archbishop of Canterbury in lieu of the castle of Brion, at which time he enjoyed thirty-eight lordships in Surrey, thirty-five in Essex, three in Cambridgeshire, with some others in Wilts and Devon, and ninety-five in Suffolk, amongst those was Clare, whence he was occasionally styled Richard de Clare, and that place in a few years afterwards becoming the chief seat of the family, his descendants are said to have assumed thereupon the title of Earls of Clare. This great feudal lord m. Rohese, dau. of Walter Giffard, Earl of Buckingham, and had issue, Gilbert, his successor, Roger, Walter, Richard, Robert, a dau. m. to Ralph de Telgers, and a dau. mo. to Eudo Dapifer.

[Burke's Peerage]\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nEven though BP, above states that they are the same person, there is no definite proof either way. One person in soc.genealogy.medieval has speculated that Robert of Belvoir was son of Roger de Toeni by his Spanish 1st wife, while Robert de Stafford was a younger son by his 2nd wife Godheut. It makes sense to me, which is why I have portrayed my pedigree that way.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAmongst the most distinguished companion in arms of the Conqueror was Robert de Todeni, a nobleman of Normandy, upon whom the victorious monarch conferred, with numerous other grants, an estate in the county of Lincoln upon the borders of Leicestershire. Here de Todeni erected a stately castle and, from the fair view it commanded, gave it the designation of Belvoir Castle, and here he established his chief abode. At the time of the General Survey, this powerful personage possessed no less than eighty extensive lordships, viz., two in Yorkshire, one in Essex, four in Suffolk, one in Cambridge, two in Hertfordshire, three in Bucks, four in Gloucestershire, three in Bedfordshire, nine in Northamptonshire, two in Rutland, thirty-two in Lincolnshire, and seventeen in Leicestershire. \"of this Robert,\" saith Dugdale, \"I have not seen any other memorial than that the Coucher-Book of Belvoir recordeth: which is, that bearing a venerable esteem to our sometime much celebrated protomartyr, St. Alban, he founded near to his castle a priory for monks and annexed it as a cell to that great abbey in Hertfordshire, formerly erected by the devout King Offa in honour of that most holy man.\" Robert de Todeni, Lord of Belvoir, d. in 1088, leaving issue by his wife Adela, William, who assumed the surname of Albini; Berenger; Geoffrey; Robert; and Agnes.

Aubrey I De VERE Sheriff Of Berkshire 415,741,899,1929,2223,2224 was born before 1040 in Ver, Manche, Normandy, France,741,2223,2224 died in 1112 in Hedingham Castle, Essex, England 741,2224, and was buried in Earls Colne Priory, Halstead, Essex, England.\n\nGeneral Notes: In 1086 Aubrey de Ver, the ancestor of the Earls of Oxford, in addtion to his tenancies-in-chief in several counties, was an under-tenant of Geoffrey bishop of Coutances in Kensington, Middlesex, and two places in Northamptonshire. This indicates that his place of origin was Ver (as indicated), which is 18 kil. South of Coutances and not Ver in the Bessin. [Origins of Some Anglo-Norman Families]\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAlberic/Aubrey de Ver (a place in the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy), probably himself a Norman; b. by 1040; by the Domesday Survey held numerous manors, chiefly in Cambs, Essex, and Suffolk--Hedingham, Essex being the chief one, but also in Hunts, Middx (including Cheniston, now Kensington) and Northants; references to him as Chamberlain occur c1110; founded Earl's Colne Priory, Essex, where he and many of his descendants are burried; Sheriff Berks by 1106; married Beatrice and died probably 1112. [Burke's Peerage]\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAUBREY DE VERE I was almost certainly a Norman who derived his name from Ver in the Côtentin and probably had connexions with the adjoining duchy of Brittany. He was born probably before 1040. The Conqueror granted him, with other lands, the great estates of an English thegn named Wulfwine in Essex, Suffolk, and Cambridge. In 1084 he attested a royal charter for Lessay as Aubrey the Chamberlain. In 1086 he held in chief 14 estates in Essex, with 2 houses and 3 acres in Colchester, 9 estates Suffolk, 7 in Cambs, and 2 in Hunts. He also held Kensington in Middlesex and two properties in Northants of the Bishop of Coutances, land in Hunts of the Abbey of Ramseyand land in two places in Essex of Count Alan of Brittany. The head of his barony was at (Castle) Hedingham in Essex, where he had planted a vineyard. It is usually assumed that he is identical with, and not the father of, the Aubrey de Vere who attested a writ at Westminster (September 1102 to Easter 1103 and a charter for Abingdon (1101-06). Not later than 1106 he was acting as sheriff of Berkshire, being styled simply Aubrey. Within the next few years he was acting as a justice in Northants, being styled Aubrey the Chamberhiln, and as sheriff of Berkshire, being styled Aubrey de Berkshire. At the dying request of his eldest son, not later than 1106, he gave Abingdon Abbey his church of Kensington with its appurtenances and 2 hides and 1 yardland; but as he resided mostly in Essex, he founded a priory at Earls Colne as a cell of Abingdon. He seems to have held 1 1/2 knights' fees of the Abbey of St. Edmund. He married Beatrice, whose parentage is unknown. He died before 1113 (almost certainly in 1112), at Colne Priory, and was buried with his wife in the church there. [Complete Peerage X:194-5, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe following post-em by Curt Hofemann, [email protected], certainly puts doubts as to the validity of the ancestry I have for Alberic/Aubrey.\n\nAt present I am starting this line with Aubrey de Vere I (d. 1088) & Beatrice. Appendix J in vol. x of \"Complete Peerage\" even more conservatively indicates that there is no proof that this Aubrey of the Conquest is father of the great chamberlain. There may have been one or more intervening Aubreys. [Ref: Alan B. Wilson <[email protected]> 14 Mar 1996 message to soc.genealogy.medival]\n\nThe parentage of Alberic/Aubrey de Vere is unknown. He was not son of Alfonso de Ghesnes, the confusion coming from a later Vere/Ghesnes marriage. [Ref: TAF 19 Apr 1998]\n\nFWIW, the following is from Paul McBride's website:\n\nhttp://homepages.rootsweb.com/~pmcbride/james/f042.htm\n\nThe first mention of the De Veres is in the General Survey of England, made by William the Conqueror, wherein the name of Alberic de Vere is stated.\n\nAlberic (Aubrey I.) de Vere, Count Aubrey, \"Sanglier,\" married before 1139 (sic) Beatrix of Ghisnes, Countess of Ghisnes in her own right, and daughter of Henry, Count of Ghisnes, and his wife Sibylla. Alberic possessed numerous lordships in different shires, of which Cheniston (now Kensington), co. Middlesex, was one, and Hedingham, co. Essex, where his castle was situated, and where he chiefly resided, another. The first mention of the De Veres is in the General Survey of England, made by William the Conqueror, wherein the name of Alberic de Vere is stated. He and his wife had five sons: 1. Alberic de Vere, 2. Geoffrey de Vere, 3. Roger de Vere, 4. Robert de Vere, 5. William de Vere. Alberic assumed the cowl in his later days, and died a monk in 1088; he was buried in the church of Colne Priory, which he founded.

[Burke's Peerage]\n\n------------------------------------\n\nOn Leicester, Earldom of [Burke's Peerage, p. 1671]:\n\nRobert de Beaumont, a companion in arms of William I (The Conqueror) at Hastings was granted after the Conquest much land in the Midlands of England, but most of it was in Warwickshire rather than Leicestershire. Indeed his younger brother became Earl of Warwick. Robert also held territory in Normandy and is usually referred to as Count of Meulan. He was a leading political figure in the reigns of William II and Henry I and on the death of one Ives de Grandmesnil in the First Crusade, the funds for campaigning in which Ives had raised from Robert on the security of his estates, [Robert] came into full possession of them, including a sizeable part of Leicester. The rest of the town was granted him by Henry I and it is possible that he became Earl of Leicester.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nEARLDOM OF LEICESTER (I) 1107 ?\n\nROBERT DE BEAUMONT, SEIGNEUR OF BEAUMONT, PONT-AUDEMER, BRIONNE AND VATTEVILLE in Normandy, and from 1081 COUNT OF MEULAN in the French Vexin, son and heir, born circa 1046. When very young he accompanied Duke William to England and distinguished himself at the battle of Hastings, and received large grants of lands in co. Warwick, with smaller holdings in cos. Leicester, Northants, and Wilts. On 14 July 080, as Robert de Bellomonte, he witnessed the foundation charter of Lessay, and next year he inherited from his mother's family the comté of Meulan. Thereafter he is continuously styled Count (Comes) of Meulan. After the death of the Conqueror he adhered to William Rufus, and was high in favour at his court. He quarrelled with Robert of Normandy about the castellanship of Brionne, in consequence of the exchange of Brionne for Ivry made by his father. He was imprisoned, but was released at the intercession of his father Roger, who eventually succeeded in obtaining Brionne in fee. He succeeded to the greater part of his father's lands in Normandy, including Beaumont, Pont-Audemer, Vatteville and Brionne. This paternal inheritance, added to his French comté and his great possessions in cos. Warwick and Leicester, made him one of the most powerful vassals of the Crown. He became one of the chief lay ministers of William Rufus, with whom he sided against Robert Courtheuse in 1098, and when William invaded the French Vexin in 1097 he received his troops in his fortresses of the comté of Meulan. After the death of William Rufus he became one of the chief advisers of Henry I. On the death of Ives de Grandmesnil on Crusade, Robert retained his estates, which Ives had mortgaged to him circa 1102. Thereby he acquired one-quarter of the town of Leicester, the whole of which was later granted to him by the King. Robert thus added largely to his already vast possessions. In 1104 he was one of the Norman barons who adhered to Henry on his arrival in Normandy. He was present in the King's army at Tenchebrai, 28 September 1106. In 1110 he was besieged at Meulan by Louis VI, who took the castle by storm, but in the following year he retaliated by a raid on Paris, which he plundered. After obtaining the whole town of Leicester he is said to have become EARL OF LEICESTER, but, being already Count of Meulan, was never so styled. There is no contemporary record that he had the third penny of the pleas of the county, but he doubtless acquired, with the Grandmesnil fief, the third penny of the issues of the Mint at Leicester.\n\nHe married, in 1096, Isabel, called also Elizabeth, daughter of Hugh DE CREPl, called Hug \"le Grand,\" COUNT OF VERMANDOIS. He died 5 June 1118, and was buried with his ancestors in the chapter house of Préaux (c). His widow married, very shortly after his death, William (DE WARINNE), EARL OF SURREY. [Complete Peerag"
