Much ‘history’ was partisan and contentious when taking place: Saxons killed Danes, Jacobites despised Hanoverians, methodists mistrusted Anglicans, chartists hated whigs; Gladstone was admired as a man of stern moral purpose and denounced as a fraud and humbug. We should not drain away controversy in order to try for some agreed verdict. It may be of some consolation to readers provoked by an omission or questionable inclusion that certain entries have been included, excised, and reinstated. I do not know of any infallible or purely objective test for inclusion and have often wished that I did. Some features call for explanation. We have devoted considerable space to ‘local history’, with a general article on the subject and shorter entries on all the English and Welsh counties, the Scottish provinces, ancient kingdoms, modern regions, and on most important towns, together with entries on a number of castles, cathedrals, and country houses. This reflects not only the interest felt by many people in their immediate surroundings, but also that the distinction commonly made between national and local history is, in practice, difficult to sustain. The one-hour skirmish at Newburn, five miles west of Newcastle, on 28 August 1640, when the Scottish army crossed the Tyne with little trouble, helped to bring about the execution of Charles I and the abolition of the monarchy. National events must take place somewhere, and not necessarily in London, while local events can cast long shadows. The industrial revolution— if the phrase is still permissible—was in practice an agglomeration of forges and furnaces, mills and mines, shipyards and turnpikes, all over the British Isles.\n\nThis raises a further difficulty. The term ‘national’ begs the question ‘which nation and whose nation?’—not in the sense beloved by Marxist historians (for whom nation was a tedious distraction from the class struggle)—but because though there was a British state, there was never a British nation, unless the term is used to describe the seventh-century Welsh. Packed into these small islands are four nations, and within each nation are further divisions and differences. Welsh and English, Irish and Scots differ, but so do north and south Wales, Portnaguran and Motherwell, Belfast and Dingle, Wolverhampton and Wisbech. The Companion attempts, within severe limits, to do justice to each nation, with articles on the kingdoms of England, Ireland, and Scotland and on the principality of Wales. There is no way of avoiding the question ‘what is history?’ In the course of preparing this work, I was told by many kind friends that I did not know what history was about. I fear they may be right. But, in my less submissive moments, I think a broad and eclectic ‘seamless web’ approach may be defended. We have, for example, included an article on the development of sport and brief references to individual sports. They will not be enough to please enthusiasts. But they make the point that most sports, as we know them, developed in the later nineteenth century and were in response to mass urbanization. They had an important political and national role. Indeed, post-Marxists, if conceding that religion is no longer the opiate of the masses, might wonder whether sport has taken its place, judging from the attention paid to it by the media. Irish nationalists were well aware in the nineteenth century of the relevance of sport to their own aspirations and begged their fellow countrymen to shun English games like soccer and tennis in favour of traditional Gaelic pastimes like hurling. In 1990 Norman Tebbit pointed out, in a pithy phrase, the connection between cricket and national identity, though he had little thanks for his pains. Sport is but one example of the balance to be struck between traditional political and military history, and social, cultural, scientific, and economic history. Few readers would doubt that Handel’s Messiah, Marks and Spencer, and the Grand National are as much part of the fabric of English life as the political parties, newspapers,\n\nand constitutional arrangements. Should one exclude the Proms (even if they represent only a part of English life) in favour of longer articles on the Bedchamber crisis of 1839, the Field of the Cloth of Gold, or the battle of Blore Heath? Are inventors, industrialists, and entrepreneurs, like Dunlop, Watt, Brunel, Royce, and Harland, intrinsically of less consequence than foreign secretaries, however transient? We have, I hope rightly, included substantial entries on the great industries—mining, gas, shipbuilding, motor manufacture, cotton, aeronautics—which have given employment to millions of people. We have tried to explore aspects of private and domestic life with articles on childbirth, housing, health, food and drink, retailing, holidays, and funerals, which attempt to chart some of those ‘noiseless revolutions’ which Macaulay, essentially a political historian, thought more significant than ‘important events’. The ‘seamless web’ approach involves even more difficult and controversial decisions. Though sport is included, sportsmen are not (save for W. G. Grace and Sir Stanley Matthews), since their fame, like that of performing artists, is usually by its nature fleeting. In relation to architects, painters, and men of letters, the problem is even more acute. Most people appreciate the importance of images and would acknowledge that we see the Tudor monarchy largely through the eyes of Holbein. Should we exclude him as not British and only a painter? Does the work of Vanbrugh at Blenheim or Castle Howard, or that of Sir George Gilbert Scott at St Pancras have no bearing on British history? Has any minister left a greater impression on the national mind (if there is such a thing) than Capability Brown? Do the lives of Robert Burns and Dylan Thomas not resonate in the identity of Scotland and Wales? We have included short entries on many authors, partly because not all readers will have the Oxford Companion to English Literature at their elbows, but more because to exclude them would leave a gaping hole in historical comprehension. Many authors, of course, played an important political role and would be included in even the most traditional survey—Milton, Dryden, Addison, Sheridan, Shelley, Byron, O’Casey. But even those less directly interested in politics— Shakespeare, Johnson, Jane Austen, Scott, Dickens, Wilde— illuminate the life and concerns of their own times. We cannot hope\n\nto do justice to them as writers, but we can suggest how they contribute to our understanding of and feel for the past—Trollope for the cathedral close, Wells for the draper’s counter, Bennett the provincial printing office, Kipling the hill-station, Wodehouse the jolly weekend. It is hardly possible to produce a work of this complexity without errors surviving. I would be glad to be told of them, preferably with compassion. Though we have tried to provide clear and authoritative entries, taking account of the most recent scholarship, contributors have also been encouraged to express their own opinions rather than offer bland and lifeless summaries. It would be a strange reader who agreed with all their judgements and some may not agree with any. Some opinions are bound to seem intrusive, unfair, or irritating. But if certain entries appear irreverent, we rely upon the irreverence of the reader who is, after all, at perfect liberty to dissent from dissent.

In doing so we have taken note of suggestions by reviewers and readers. We are grateful to people who have written in and would welcome further comments on this edition. J C University of Newcastle upon Tyne February 2002\n\nPREFACE TO SECOND EDITION\n\nProfessor John Cannon is responsible for the important achievement that is this Companion. He undertook a vast amount of work over a number of years and ensured that the work met high standards of scholarship while being accessible and engaging to a non-academic audience. His death in 2012 was a blow to the profession. I am much indebted to Rebecca Lane at Oxford University Press for approaching me about preparing this new edition. Rebecca helped to pilot the proposal through the approvals process and provided much encouragement and guidance along the way. Cornelia Haase was an excellent and diligent editor. It was a pleasure to work with them both. I have done my best to preserve the balance and feel of the Companion as it was conceived by Professor Cannon. Hopefully the judgements offered within will continue to stimulate readers and provoke disagreement. New entries have been added on events that took place since the last edition was published. Many other entries have been updated in light of the passage of time. I authored much of the new and revised material myself, though I am grateful to Rachel Utley and Philip Williamson for their contributions. R C University of Edinburgh September 2014\n\nCONTRIBUTORS\n\nBiographical details were current in 2002 when the majority of entries were written and the revised first edition of the Companion published.
