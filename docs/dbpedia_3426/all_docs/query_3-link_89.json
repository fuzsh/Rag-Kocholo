I was chosen for this task because of a small chapter on the subject of Gerson’s post-mortem reception in my 2004 book Le siècle d’or de la mystique francaise. The wealth of fascinating facts and developments I accumulated while preparing this chapter could not be accommodated in a series of articles, signaling the need for a more substantial study, which became my second dissertation at EHESS in Paris, and then this book. My most heartfelt gratitude goes to my mentor Pierre-Antoine Fabre (EHESS), colleagues Thierry Amalou (Université d’Artois) and Jean-Marie Le Gall (Sorbonne) for their generosity in welcoming a complete stranger; and to Jacob Schmutz (UC Louvain), Bénédicte Sère (Paris-Nanterre) and Dominique Iogna-Prat (EHESS) for their helpful comments. I am most grateful to Wim François at KU Leuven for his unwavering support and friendship, and to Antonio Gerace at Fondazione per le scienze religiose Giovanni XXIII (FSCIRE) in Bologna for his continuous help and his faith in me. On the ‘German side’ I thank my former Alaska colleague Josef Glowa for his assistance with difficult middleGerman passages, my dear friend Steffen Hoffman for guiding me through archives of Sondersammlungen of Albertina Library (Leipzig University) and Rudolf Schüssler (Bayreuth University) for his interest in my work. A dedicated group made of family members (Phyllis Adams, Craig Bledsoe), friends (Vlad Demine, George Fairclough and Sylvia Kim) and especially former students (Jalil Jackallen, Debbie Tilsworth, Maureen Heftinger, Katelyn Bushnell, Heather Maas-Kisha, Kat Timm, Solomon Shindler and Lisa Gilbert) proofread the manuscript. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 13\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\nList of Abbreviations Luthers Werke Weimar Ausgabe\n\nWA volume number.

Jean Gerson1\n\nThis book is the first wide-ranging investigation of the reception of Jean Gerson — the most significant intellectual figure of the late medieval period, whose larger-than-life personality and mammoth legacy we are only now beginning to assess — in early modern Europe, both in Protestant and in Catholic milieus. The story of his reception is worth sharing, as it reveals many discoveries and surprises for all those interested in the reconstruction of this revolutionary period in Western history — the end of the late Middle Ages and the beginning of modern times — when European culture began to show first signs of its dissociation from what Albert Camus called ‘the world of grace’ 2 and Jacques Derrida the ‘universe of testimony’.3 Indeed, although Gerson himself fully belongs to the latter, his reception, in my view, has the potential to serve as a key to both the lost universe of the medieval past and the reformed world that would replace it. Paraphrasing Daniel Hobbins, one can say that his legacy is a window not just to Gerson himself but to the social realities that met his thought after his passing.4 Studying towering figures like Gerson is never just a mere erudition. The success of someone’s ideas is not measured by their fame, but by an actual effect upon the minds and actions of La Montagne de contemplation, OC: 7:1, p. 27: ‘Comment la grace singulière d’aucuns n’est mie a ensuivre de tous’. McGuire 1998, p. 90. 2 Camus 1992, p. 21. 3 Derrida & Stiegler 1996, p. 94. Also see Allow 2017, pp. 289–303. 4 Hobbins 2006, p. 76. 1\n\n15\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\nthose who come after them. In Gerson’s case this effect was disproportionally large, while our understanding of it is still in its early stages. Therefore, his significance should be fully restored to posterity not only to give him credit for his contributions, but also in order to better understand his specific role in the religious, legal and cultural evolution of Western civilization. It is a matter of awareness and healthy self-reflection on our common and now more and more shared inheritance. His legacy, part of the theological foundation, which lies, hidden, at the basis of many, if not all, contemporary issues and debates, provides a significant doctrinal context, where contemporary ideas such as the concept of individual right, international law or the necessity of palliative care, find their roots. Today, when the question of the place of religion in society has lost nothing of its urgency, coming to terms with this theological basis is no longer the fief of specialized researchers, but a social necessity. For, even though we might not know it, Gerson is part of our own universe, capable of offering us ‘a surer grasp of principles amid the complexities of the modern world’.5 The title of the book, Le père du siècle: The Early Modern Reception of Jean Gerson (1363-1429), reflects the prevalence of the theme of the father — as parent, protector, generator, counselor and authority — both in his oeuvre and in his reception, providing connection between the two. Much more than a ‘good witness of his time’, as Zénon Kaluza, Cédric Giraud and Jacques Verger viewed him,6 Gerson was an active maker of a modern concept of the father, in a sense becoming ‘the father of the fatherhood’. What’s more, already in his lifetime he assumed, first toward his siblings, then toward his students and finally even toward his contemporaries, including the royal family, the role of the father, whose vocation consisted of leading, teaching and especially consoling his spiritual children. The latter motif is part of the ideal of bonus paster, who, as a prelate of the Church, should be like a father to all the orphans, the poor, the prisoners and the af Figgis 2011, p. 4. Kaluza 1988, p. 65. Giraud 2016, p. 257: ‘nous avons retenu Jean Gerson pour plusieurs raisons qui s’additionnent pour faire du chancelier un ‘bon témoin de son temps’. Verger 1995, p. 191: ‘Gerson est un bon témoin.’ On Gerson’s contribution to the more modern idea of fatherhood see Delumeau & Roche 1990. 5 6\n\n16\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nflicted.7 Indeed, it is mostly, although not only, in his quality of doctor consolatorius, which Herbert Kraume calls his zweiter Beiname,8 that Gerson would be welcomed by the future generations of theologians and spiritual leaders for the majority of whom he had remained or had become a spiritual father.\n\nState of the Art ‘For the late Middle Ages, the towering figure of Jean Gerson commands attention’.9\n\nWhile there has been something of a renaissance in Gersonrelated studies, with Daniel Hobbins’s 2009 book Authorship and Publicity Before Print: Jean Gerson and the Transformation of Late Medieval Learning, Vial 2006 Jean Gerson: théoricien de la théologie mystique, Nancy McLoughlin’s 2015 Jean Gerson and Gender: Rhetoric and Politics in Fifteenth-Century France and Brian Patrick McGuire’s 2005 biography, Jean Gerson and the Last Medieval Reformation, none of the existing research deals with the subject of Gerson’s legacy and reception directly. Gerson-related literature can be divided into four groups. The first group, dominated by Protestant researchers, traditionally presents Gerson as a precursor of the Reformation, from Johann Baptist Schwab’s major 1873 study to Heiko A. Oberman’s classic Forerunners of the Reformation.10 This view has been challenged by the second group of publications, dating from the late 1980s and 1990s, and authored by unambiguously Christian researchers such as Mark S. Burrows, Catherine Brown and Brian P. McGuire, arguing that ‘Gerson is no forerunner to later Protestant exegesis, but a distinctively\n\n7 Gerson, Nova epistola pro instructione episcoporum et prelatorum …, in Vansteenberghe 1939, p. 40 and p. 42: Qui orphano et pupillo et uidue et egenti et captiuo et egroto et aflicto et agricolis senebis et languoribus consumptis et onere puerorum aggrauatis etc., quia refugium esse debent atque patres, subueniant. ‘And that these [prelates] help the orphan, the child, the widow, the destitute, the prisoner, the sick and the afflicted, the old peasants and those who are consumed by diseases, etc., because they must be for them a refuge and fathers’. 8 Kraume 1980, p. 76. 9 Newman 2013, p. 2. 10 Schwab 1859; Oberman 1981a.\n\n17\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\nconservative voice’,11 or should be considered as the forerunner of the Catholic Counter-Reformation instead.12 The third group of research publications, by Heiko A. Oberman, Veronica GerzVon Büren, Herbert Kraume and Daniel Hobbins, is comprised of works covering the reception of Gerson shortly after his death in 1429 up until early 1500s.13 Based on the fact that the last edition of Gerson’s works was published in 1521, these studies deem Gerson’s influence to have diminished with the triumph of the Reformation. The fourth, and the largest category, is focused on his role in the conciliarist movement, and includes works by Francis Oakley, Christopher Bellitto, Bénédicte Sère, Thomas Izbicki, Philippe Denis and others. This dimension of his legacy, together with the discussion of Gerson’s nominalism,14 although very important, will mostly stay outside the scope of the current study for three main reasons. The first is that, unlike practically all other aspects of Gerson’s legacy, the conciliarist dimension has already received much scholarly attention in the last fifty years. In fact, it might be the only component of his legacy that received any major traction at all. Despite Philippe Denis’s affirmation to the contrary, the bibliography on this subject is extensive.15 The second, a direct consequence of the first, is that the study of the chancellor’s conciliarism has a history in and of its own, with its own methodologies and a long tradition, whose inclusion in this study would require a whole different approach and a multi-volume format. Finally, since this book aims, first and foremost, at introducing unexplored dimensions of Gerson’s posthumous significance, the Burrows 1991, p. 42. Brown 1987, p. 252. 13 Oberman 1963; Gerz-Von Büren 1973; Kraume 1980. 14 Adams 1977, pp. 144–76; Burrows 1991; Gillespie 2009; Enenkel & Melion 2010. 15 Denis 2019, p. 369.

Francis Oakley addresses the issue of ‘instability’ regarding the definition of conciliarism: ‘What people mean, however, when they refer to ‘conciliarism’ is far from self-evident; over the years usage has manifested a sometimes confusing degree of instability’. (Oakley 2006, pp. 182–83) Some legal researchers credit Gerson’s conciliar theory as presaging ‘the eventual development of representative democracy in the Western world’ (Cahill 2014, p. 168). 11 12\n\n18\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nconciliarist component does not fit this objective, as well as the general direction of the study, which focuses on the chancellor’s spiritual and theological legacy. This project also builds on the foundation of my own earlier research, which will be referenced but not repeated in the current study. The subjects explored in my earlier publications, such as the 15th century reception of Gerson by Parisian preachers, devotio moderna, early German humanists in Vienna, Tübingen, Strasbourg and Heidelberg, and some other topics, will reappear only in two particular circumstances. The first is when there is a new information, which may enrich or correct previously investigated developments. The second is when there is a clear need to provide factual base and context for the readers.\n\nObjective Since no comprehensive study of the reception of Gerson exists,16 the book hopes to achieve precisely this primary task: to take his name out of shadow and bring him into spotlight, by showing his importance beyond the 15th century. Already in 1964 Etienne Delaruelle articulated the historical task taken up here, when he urged the necessity of undertaking such an opening study, believing, contrary to majority of Gerson’s experts, that the chancellor’s influence sustained and even increased in the 16th century.17 Yet, the majority of points concerning the state of research on Gerson’s legacy that Etienne Delaruelle and his team specified in L’Église au temps du schisme are still valid, with none of the research ideas listed in its ‘Note additionnelle’ realized to this day.18 While Delaruelle hoped that a study of Gerson’s influence outside\n\n16 Bast 1997, p. 18: ‘Scholars have not yet attempted to gauge precisely the impact of Gerson’s program’. 17 Delaruelle, Labande & Ourliac 1964, p. 861: ‘Si la première moitié du XVe siècle peut être appelée le siècle de Gerson, il ne faudrait pas croire pour autant que cette influence ait par la suite déclinée; elle n’a fait, au contraire, que croître’. 18 ‘One should not underestimate the impact of the ideology of laïcité that spread along with the Code Napoléon and the repression of the ancien régime, not only on the actual, battered relationship between State and Church, but inevitably also on historical scholarship, where the contribution by the theologians has been eclipsed almost completely’ (Decock 2012, pp. 12–13).\n\n19\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\nFrance would take place ‘un jour’,19 a relatively recent MA thesis, concerning the state of Gerson’s studies after 1945, flatly asserts the absence of further research on his legacy and reception.20 In 1960s, as today, ‘Le monde gersonien est donc actuellement un chantier où tout est matière de discussion’.21 The present study is, among other things, an exploratory response to Delaruelle’s half a century old call for action, as it attempts to demonstrate Gerson’s relevance beyond the 15th century and his impact on early modern movements and thinkers of great significance that paved the way for many developments still shaping our existence today. Besides the expected influence in theology and church history, Gerson’s thought left a significant imprint in jurisprudence, human rights history, education, art, music, literature and more. There is hardly an area of humanities that did not pay at least some tribute to his authority, and there is almost no political or religious movement in the West that neglected his name. Following Gerson’s legacy through time and space, one crosses paths with virtually all key personalities of early modern Europe. A cohort of celebrities — Thomas More, Martin Luther, King James I, Ignatius of Loyola, Girolamo Savonarola, Christopher Columbus, Bartolomé de Las Casas and many others, relied on his writings and ideas. The last medieval reformer (McGuire) became a privileged reference in the dialogue of practically all early-modern theologians with their immediate past, and in the heated arguments these theologians had between each other. His writings and ideas became building blocks for new religious identities ranging from Lutheran to Jesuit, and among those who relied on his insights were not only Martin Luther, his main associate Philipp Melanchthon and his spiritual descendant Martin Chemnitz, but also Luther’s main opponent Johannes Eck and Melanchthon’s bitter foe, Lutheran theologian Matthias Flacius Illyricus. Puritans, Jesuits and King James I, who hated both, all banked on Gerson’s authority and ideas. The topography of his legacy is just as broad and varied, spanning from Portugal to Scan19 Delaruelle, Labande & Ourliac 1964, p. 862: ‘ll vaudrait la peine d’étudier un jour la question du gersonisme hors de France’. 20 Hoffman 2003. 21 Delaruelle, Labande & Ourliac 1964, p. 865.\n\n20\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ndinavia, and from Japan to Mexico. It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the importance of further research regarding the reception of Gerson before and during the Reformation, this book being the first, opening step toward filling a yawning gap in our understanding of his legacy.\n\nMethodology: Organization, Sources and Theoretical Framework The novelty of the project consists in its aim to transcend traditional historiographical boundaries, which have continuously influenced and, in my opinion, undermined, our understanding of Gerson’s legacy. These boundaries are numerous: confessional, namely between Protestant and Catholic scholarships; chronological (between the fields of medieval and early modern studies); and disciplinary (between different fields of knowledge). An example of the latter is Gerson’s contribution to music, which has long been known to professional musicologists, while remaining unknown to historians. Similarly, Gerson’s role in the emergence of the early modern judicial order, which has recently attracted an unprecedented attention among legal scholars and philosophers, has not reached outside the field of jurisprudence.22 His fundamental role in the history of medicine is also acknowledged exclusively in specialized publications. Finally, the project also aspires to make an important step toward overcoming the national divide in Gerson’s research, namely between contemporary French, German and English-language scholarships. Such a study is certainly an ambitious undertaking fraught with great difficulty, but it should help in both dispelling the perception of Gerson’s irrelevance in the early modern Europe, and break new ground. Surely, nothing approaching complete success is possible at this stage. Yet, this endeavor gives a chance of reaching certain conclusions about the place that this extraordinary man occupied after his death. This is what I have tried to do, and I shall be happy if the pages which follow stimulate teams of others to fare better.\n\n22 Prodi 2000; Bauer 2004; Varkemaa 2005; Varkemaa 2006; Varkemaa 2012; Decock 2012; Bader 2014; Decock 2017; Astorri 2019.\n\n21\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\nAvoiding confessional bias is of a particular importance in the field of Reformation studies, where, until recently, traditional perspectives remained strong and nearly all those working in it were insiders, interpreting revolutionary changes that occurred in early modern period in light of their respective religious commitments, and thus often presenting ‘une construction théorique ouvertement confessionnelle’.23 The aim to adopt, as much as possible, an analytically detached outsider perspective requires minimal information on my own biography, as a way to identify possible involvement or partiality in the issues analyzed here. To keep it short, I have no familial, cultural, historical or educational ties with Western forms of Christianity, and no personal or religious association with either Catholic or Protestant traditions. As an imperfect outsider, I am rather interested ‘in presenting the story of Christian contributions to contemporary identity’, which, as Carter Lindberg put it, ‘is too important to be left to the Christians’ 24 only. However, it does not mean that I intend, in the tradition of social historians, ‘to shelve the theological-religious interpretation of the Reformation’,25 or dismiss homo religiosus as a mere fiction. On the contrary, I believe that the presence of homo religiosus is sometimes the most determining factor in shaping human existence even now, let alone in the 16th century. After all, at the center of this study is a ‘theological polymath’ 26 Jean Gerson, who was homo religiosus par excellence. Placed outside any particular religion or even, as much as possible, current ideological movements, I consider theology to be a formative anthropological factor of major importance, which needs to take a central stage in telling history, where Jean Gerson is certainly one of the most significant and interesting actors. Of course, no writing is value-free and ‘to write history amounts, for the most part, to projecting a vocabulary of order unto the confusion of realities’.27 Even choosing terminology is a heavily charged and problematic step, as all usual terms — Refor 25 26 27 23 24\n\nBüttgen 2011, p. 78.

Both the words ‘Reformation’, which was not used until the end of the 17th century, and ‘Counter-Reformation’ fail to please Roman Catholic historians such as John Bossy, who would just as soon drop the term Reformation altogether, or John O’Malley, who cogently argues that the phrase ‘early modern Catholicism’ would better designate both change and continuity than the older terms.28 However, since the human mind cannot function without categories, the contents of this study are organized chronologically, denominationally and geographically. Chronologically, in order to provide the reader with historical background immediately preceding the Reformation, the study begins, largely building upon existing scholarship, in the last ten years of Gerson’s life, after the conclusion of the Council of Constance (chapter one). Denominationally, the book is divided, relatively equally, between Protestant and Catholic receptions (chapters two and three). Each chapter opens with an introduction, followed by concrete case studies. The geographical dimension is particularly relevant, since ideas and social processes play out differently in different locations. The impact of Gerson’s thought largely depended upon local circumstances, the broader theological and political context, and the specific and ever-contingent agency of particular religious leaders and thinkers. In the unfolding of the initial roadmap of Gerson’s post-mortem journey space is every bit as important as time. Spatiality, which is interdisciplinary by nature, offers a perspective in which ‘geography is not relegated to an afterthought of social relations, but is intimately involved in their construction’.29 Indeed, geography in all its expressions, as locality, environment, vicinity or neighborhood, probably shaped early modernity more than any other factor. However, using designations such as ‘Germany’ or the ‘Netherlands’ is obviously problematic and ambiguous at best, as early modern borders did not coincide with the present-day political maps. Also, due to frequent visits among religious leaders and to migrations provoked by mutual persecutions, schools and ideas traveled amazingly fast, constantly inter Lindberg 1996, pp. 10–11.

The greater part of the new data in chapter one concerns the reception of Gerson in Sweden and especially in Italy, new facts and documents concerning his influence on Johannes Geiler von Kaysersberg and Johannes Nider, as well as his contribution to Аrs moriendi tradition. 16th century sources explored in the main chapters two, three and four, with the exception of the Meaux circle of French evangelicals, Martin Luther, and, partly, the philosophical ‘School of Salamanca’, had not been considered in relation to Gerson before this study. Thus, the degree of Gerson’s significance for early 16th century Catholic German theologians such as Johannes Staupitz did not bring any notice, the fact likely explainable by a scanty interest and ‘a historical pre-judgment’ of the beginning of Catholic reform in general, and in German territories in particular.30 Among the writings of famous personalities, analyzed for their relationship with Gerson’s legacy, Thomas More holds a special and massive place, which, together with the chancellor’s impact on British legal history through both More and Christopher St Germain, as well as some other, specifically English aspects, warrant the necessity of a separate chapter ‘Gerson in England and Scotland’.31 Gerson-related data is gathered, whenever possible, from primary Latin, vernacular or translated sources by key historical personalities, such as Johannes Geiler von Kaysersberg’s Die Augsburger Predigten, Johannes Nider’s Consolatorium timorae conscientiae, Bernard von Waging’s Consolatorium tribulatorum, Wessel Gansfort’s Farrago rerum theologicarum, Thomas More’s Complete Works, Martin Luther’s Werke, Andreas Osiander’s Gesamtausgabe, Schriften und Briefe, Johann von Staupitz’s Sämtliche Schriften, Philipp Melanchthon’s Loci Communes, Martin Chemnitz’s Loci theologici, Francisco de Osuna’s Tercer abecedario spiritual, Juan-Alphonso Polanco’s Le Directoire des confesseurs tres Volkmar 2018, p. 13. Although Anglicanism is one of the major branches of the 16th-century Protestant Reformation, it is a form of Christianity that includes features of both Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. Due to this particular situation and England’s 16th-century vacillations between Puritanism and Catholicism, Anglican reception of Gerson is treated in chapter four. 30 31\n\n24\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nbrief and so forth, as well as from important historical documents, such as the text of the Confessio Augustana (Augsburg Confession) or Repertorium columbianum. The investigation also includes anonymous or collective works largely based on Gerson’s writings, such as German ars moriendi or Middle English manuals for confessors, as well as a large quantity of secondary literature. It must also be taken into account that many of Gerson’s writings were published under other people’s names, while his works and ideas were used without giving him credit. In the era before copyrights and the concept of plagiarism, the significance of an author cannot be measured through direct citations only. Hence, I cannot always claim, in every case, to be invulnerable to doubt in regards to Gerson’s textual presence or theological influence, nor can I claim to have called everything possible into question. Such work would exceed not only this volume but my lifetime. As a general principle, I made a decision to present only the clearest cases of what may be called history of the reference to Gerson, while only briefly indicating other occurrences, which admit more scruple. Notwithstanding, evaluating influence is always problematic for several reasons, the first being the vagueness of the concept itself. Although ‘my method has been inductive, starting with case studies rather than theories’,32 this study is partly based on the techniques borrowed from modern sociology, which uses the following principles in order to measure impacts of contemporary movements or figures. Applied in historical context and re-contextualized in light of the diffusion and transformation of Gerson’s legacy, these methods include: • the General Elimination Method, which entails systematically identifying alternative causal explanations of observed results, as, for example, when Gerson’s opinions concerning certain issues have to be differentiated from those of other thinkers or from the prevalent ideas of the time commonly inhaled with them. • Contribution Analysis Method, which builds up evidence to demonstrate the contribution made by an activity or a person Newman 2013, p. 7.\n\n32\n\n25\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\ntowards observed outcomes, as in cases of Gerson’s impacts on catechization, ars moriendi tradition, cult of St Joseph or confessional practices. • A Case Study Method, which is a detailed and intensive examination of a specific unit of analysis — as in cases of Thomas More’s reception of Gerson, early Jesuits or Lutheran historiography — eventually building into larger ‘long-term syntheses’ narratives. Case studies method is privileged here because it suits situations involving a new setting, or when the environment is complex or turbulent,33 which is definitely the case of early modern Europe. Even though case study evaluations present the difficulty of not being easily generalizable, multiple case studies, as presented here, counter the latter concern by presenting a rich and varied panorama of the reception.34 This method can also provide a deeper understanding of circumstances, actors and their motivations, while also avoiding the problem of being locked into preconceived ideas about the person or phenomenon being evaluated.35 Naturally, such an approach is not without dangers, since a case-based study cannot, by its nature, do full justice to each historical figure treated here, and specialists of Thomas More, Teresa of Avila or Philipp Melanchthon may complain that I have misrepresented them in this way. Also, there is a problem inherent to ‘long-term syntheses’, as it can only provide ‘a rough outline’.36 Nevertheless, considering that the significance of Gerson for the Western intellectual history has not yet been acknowledged, case-based long-term syntheses approach is justified. Instead of taking small, careful steps forward, the book hopes to become a starting point of the future chain of research, which will take upon itself proving in minuscule detail what appears beyond certain for me: Jean Gerson’s continuous and ubiquitous presence after his passing.\n\n35 36 33 34\n\nTsui & Lucas 2013, online.

In this book, it combines several related and mostly chronologically subsequent concepts: • reception in its most literal sense of a welcome, as with Gerson’s initial sojourn in Austria or in Lyons; • reception as distribution, reproduction, translation and accumulation of his works, as in cases of the Carthusian Order, devotio moderna or Johann Staupitz; • reception as a response to his legacy, whether through reworking or manipulation, as in cases of Johannes Geiler von Kayserberg, Philipp Melanchthon or Thomas More; • reception as response to the response, as with the Catholic reaction to the Lutheran attitude toward the late medieval chancellor. Since in the 15th and 16th centuries these types of reception were not isolated from one another, the same person or institution could be simultaneously or subsequently involved in more than one of these types. Thus, those who received the exiled chancellor at Melk became active in first distribution efforts, while one of the principal recipients of his theology, Gabriel Biel, also translated and published his works. Indubitably, the distribution effort already represents, in and of itself, a type of response, a reaction and an approval, as only an author in whom the reading public is potentially interested can become an object of such efforts. On the other hand, response to an influence through citing and reworking affects distribution, in a complicated, controversial, and oftentimes unpredictable way. Finally, a study of reception also poses the problem of continuity or discontinuity models, which both imply a teleological perspective. Although both modes will be signaled when appropriate, it is Volker Leppin’s idea to view the relation between late Middle Ages and the 16th century as that of change in polarities, that appears to offer a particularly useful theoretical framework. Leppin’s suggestion that tensions, which had existed in late Middle Ages as cultural tendencies were transformed in the 16th cen27\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\ntury into institutional ones 37 applies to the chancellor’s reception, since Gerson, whom Leppin never mentions, was involved in all polarities listed by the German scholar. Among these tension-generating polarities are philosophical, between realists and nominalists, theological, between via antiqua and via moderna, political, between papacy and conciliarism, cognitive, between humanism and scholasticism, as well as between humanism and monasticism, social, between secular and professional religiosity, university and monastic orders, and institutional, between monastic tradition and non-monastic communities such as devotio moderna or even little home-based communes such as the one that Gerson helped to create for his own sisters. To this list could be added nascent national tensions in which Gerson also played a significant role both during his lifetime and post-mortem. His centrality to all major issues of his time, whose tension will increase in the 16th century to the point of becoming actual conflicts, makes the French chancellor a reference with a capital R.\n\nLeppin 2010.\n\n37\n\n28\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nTHE BACKGROUND: GERSON AND THE LONG 15TH CENTURY ‘Once it was Alexander of Hales who was the reigning authority; then came Thomas and after him Duns Scotus; Albertus dominated his age, as Gerson did his’. Desiderius Erasmus1\n\nPart I. Early Reception in the Empire Introduction The period of early reception corresponds to the long 15th Century (1400–1520s),2 an age characterized by prodigious cultural, political and religious changes to which Gerson’s role was central. It was also the time when the reception of Gerson throughout Europe began, and where the future developments in his legacy are rooted. His star status in the 15th century is beyond doubt. With 210 editions published between 1455 and 1500, he scores as the seventh best-selling author far above Petrarch (thirty-fourth) or Boccaccio (forty-eighth). Among those who still matter today only St Augustine (sixth), Thomas Aquinas (fourth), and Cicero (third) are ahead of him.3 With a view to the chancellor’s key importance for this time period, this chapter seeks to achieve the balancing act of presenting new or lesser-known facts concerning the early stages of the reception of Gerson, while still providing sufficient references to the already existing research without repeating previous publications. In addition to these two goals and in accordance with the study’s spatial approach, this chapter Erasmus 1994, Letter 1581 to Noel Béda p. 153. Van Engen 2008, p. 260: ‘This address focuses on the 1370s to 1520s, the long 15th century as some now say, and more particularly on religious and church history’. 3 Milway 2000, p. 142. 1\n\n2\n\n29\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\noffers a geographically inclusive view of Gerson’s early reception in Europe. This reception was diffused through three distinct but interconnected channels: monastic milieu, humanist circles, and universities. Contrary to Paul Payan’s affirmation that the chancellor’s influence was ‘naturellement plus importante en France’,4 all three conduits were initially more active in propagating Gerson’s works in what is now the Low Countries, Austria, Switzerland, and especially Germany than in his homeland.5 Several factors contributed to Gerson’s posthumous success in this cultural chronotope — configuration of time and space — forming what came to be known as his ‘Germanic passage’.6 One factor was numerical: the Empire was producing three times as many manuscripts as France was, a phenomenon that Daniel Hobbins called ‘the textual avalanche’.7 Another factor was quantitative. The distribution of Gerson’s writings and ideas profited mightily from the location of the general ecumenical council at the imperial city of Constance (Konstanz) from 1414 to 1418. The council became a nexus circulating Gerson’s books in the heart of the Empire. There, Gerson’s works were introduced to the new reading public of 15th century Germany, which was then both the most pious and the most literate land that it has ever been,8 as well as to the booming Northern and Central European book markets.9 The desire for church reform formed another powerful ground for Gerson’s highly positive reception in the Empire.10 Then there was the Zeitgeist, which Gerson both shaped and expressed in his works: a response to the desire for reform expressed in a new form of practical devotional theology, known as Frömmigkeitstheologie, to which both the clergy and ‘the self-confident urban laity’11 Payan 2006, p. 219.

Jahrhunderts in Deutschland besser bekannt war als in Frankreich selbst’. 6 Mazour-Matusevich 2006, pp. 963–87; Mazour-Matusevich 2006, pp. 357–400; Mazour-Matusevich 2010, pp. 632–51. 7 Hobbins 2006, p. 194. 8 Saak 2017, p. 16. 9 Hobbins 2006, pp. 193–94. 10 Hamm 1977, p. 75 & p. 77. 11 François & Soen 2018, Introduction, p. 10. 4 5\n\n30\n\nCHAPTER 1 – THE BACKGROUND: GERSON AND THE LONG 15TH CENTURY\n\nwere already particularly receptive during his lifetime.12 The fact that by the end of the 15th century the principal oracle of the devotio moderna (a Germanic phenomenon as well) was none other than the chancellor of Paris University,13 further reinforced the special connection between the French late medieval chancellor and religious circles in this part of Europe. Gerson at Melk\n\nThe Benedictine monastery of Melk, located on a rocky base overlooking the Danube river, was the place where Gerson’s Germanic passage began. It began, right after the Council of Constance, as a personal failure and loss. The epic Council turned out to be the culmination of all the paradoxes and contradictions of Gerson’s complex personality and life — both the summit of his career that propelled him from a peasant’s son to a preeminent status in Europe, and the point of no return in the literal and figurative sense of this expression. The Council epitomized his greatest achievement as an ecclesiastical leader and a dedicated servant of the Church: the end of the Western Schism. It also brought about his fateful involvement in the condemnation and gruesome execution of Jan Hus (1369–1415) and Jerome of Prague (1379– 1416), a deeply disturbing fact in the chancellor’s biography otherwise untarnished by violence and cruelty.14 As if in retribution for his treatment of the Czechs, he, the powerful chancellor of the University of Paris, adviser of kings and princes and the star theologian of his time — himself became a victim of persecution. His persistent struggle contra doctrinam pestiferam iubentam tyranos per insidias interfici 15 or the tyrannicide theory, earned him condemnation in Paris, then occupied by Anglo-Burgundian See Hamm, 1977, pp. 464–971.

His numerous epitaphs do not exaggerate when they state that he suddenly lost all that he managed to accomplish, accumulate and secure in his spectacular social ascent: status, academic position, income, home, library, and friends.17 Unable to go back, he traveled to Tyrol, accompanied (according to a legend which will be discussed further on) by only a friend and a dog.18 This life-changing experience must have had a powerful effect on the formerly powerful man, and in 1418 Melk’s monks probably met a different Gerson. His own accounts of his internal state of turmoil are found in Dialogus Apologeticus and De consolatione theologiae, written immediately after the Council. Dialogus, written first, reflects his inner transition from shock to resentment, from resentment to acceptance and from acceptance to the beginning of recovery. Anyone familiar with the grieving process can identify with these three stages. Only at the very end, the Dialogus reveals its author’s capacity to redirect his gaze away from his pain(ambushes) and furthermore when the system of either divine or human laws, despite any confederation, is not upheld’. 16 The tyrannicide controversy and the ensuing open conflict with the head of House of Burgundy John the Fearless (1371–1419) earned the chancellor the condemnation in absentia, making his return to Paris impossible. After the Council of Constance, he went to Tyrol and then to Lyons. For Gerson’s biography see McGuire 2005.

This epitaph, with slight variations, is found in the 1580 Index Chronologicus by Abraham Buchholzer, Catalogue of Historical Description by Wolfgang Krüger, and Index Chronologicus by Elia Reusner. 18 L’Écuy 1832, p. 251.\n\n32\n\nCHAPTER 1 – THE BACKGROUND: GERSON AND THE LONG 15TH CENTURY\n\nful recent past, turning ‘inward to his spiritual life’.19 Abruptly thrown out of the commotion of an active political life, disillusioned, worn out and resentful, the fifty-five-year-old chancellor was left with what no one could take away from him, and what he was soon to rediscover as truly his own: his love of writing and meditation, which for him were one and the same. This mindset, favoring detachment and internal reflection, naturally influenced his demeanor and the impression he left on Melk’s brothers, who perceived him not as a mighty church politician, but as a spiritual writer absorbed in contemplation. This does not mean, of course, that his contemplative tendencies emerged only at that stage of his life. They had always been present in his writings. But it was only in his involuntary retirement that these tendencies had the opportunity to fully blossom and fully absorb him, unhindered by worldly concerns. In fact, shifting away from his initial distress, Gerson ended up viewing his forced withdrawal from the active life as a deliverance and an act of God’s mercy, allowing him to finally focus on his main concerns — theology and pastoral care: His interim contentus, habes enim De theologica consolatione grandius opusculum, tecum habita, gratus Deo qui te segregauit ab his sollicitudinibus et pro ceteris in potestate constitutes ora, compatiens, flens et lugens.20\n\nGerson must have left a lasting impression in Melk, since the first German manuscript translations of his works originate from there, including his future best-seller Opus tripartitum. His contemporary at Melk and likely his personal acquaintance, Benedictine monk Johannes Wischler von Freinsheim (1383–1455), translated Opus’ third part in Latin as Scientia mortis. The second translation of the same text also came from Melk, authored by an affiliate of Vienna University, Heinrich von Preussen.21 By 1483 McGuire 2005, p. 283. Dialogus Apologeticus, OC: 6, p. 304. ‘Meanwhile, safe from those people, now you have the greater work The Consolation of Theology, carried with you, [and], thanks to God, who separated you from these cares, now you also are able to work for others, suffering, crying and grieving’. 21 Rudolf 1957, p. 68. 19 20\n\n33\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\ncatalogue at Melk already ‘lists forty-three manuscripts containing one or more Gerson’s texts’.22 The consonance between Gerson’s post-Constance disposition and Melk spirituality could not be greater: like-minded people met at the right place and at the right time. Melk’s monks, leaders of the reform movement among monasteries in the Empire, welcomed a kindred spirit. This happenstance doubtless influenced the reception of the chancellor’s writings in German lands in the years immediately following his passing, as other monasteries soon joined Melk in the production of German manuscript translations of Gerson’s works. His De remediis contra pusillanimitatem and Super Magnificat were translated anonymously at the monastery in Tegernsee, which would collect thirty-nine manuscripts of his works.23 German monks Thomas Finck and Wolfgang Walcher translated the vernacular French treatise De mendicité spirituelle.24 Several translations also came from the movement of devotio moderna.25 University of Vienna\n\nWhile the monastic milieu might have been the most receptive to Gerson’s influence at first, his impact in academia was ultimately not less prominent. In fact, in the context of the 15th century Empire, these two spheres of intellectual and spiritual life were not juxtaposed but closely connected, with both students and faculty circulating between the two venues. Gerson’s association with the University of Vienna, the Empire’s most important theological school, is of particular importance. According to a later tradition promoted by early German humanists, the Vienna connection was a direct continuation of Gerson’s sojourn at Melk. According to this belief , the exiled and dispossessed chancellor was contacted by Albrecht V, Duke of Austria (1397–1439), who allegedly offered him protection and professorship at the Theology Department of the young University of Vienna (founded in 1365, the first students matriculated in Hobbins 2006, p. 202. Kraume 1980, p. 42. Besides Kraume, for the first reception see Pascoe 1973; McGuire 2005. 24 Kraume 1980, p. 55 & p. 64. Hohenadel 2015, p. 51. 25 Kraume 1980, p. 50. 22 23\n\n34\n\nCHAPTER 1 – THE BACKGROUND: GERSON AND THE LONG 15TH CENTURY\n\n1385). Although Gerson allegedly declined the offer — a believable response considering his mood after the Council — he enjoyed a great reputation among the University’s faculty. His writings addressing the daily needs of the clergy met with an immediate popularity among representatives of the Vienna school of Pastoraltheologie such as Thomas Peuntner (1360/80– 1439), Peuntner’s teacher, Nikolaus von Dinkelsbühl (real name Prüntzlin or Prunczlein, 1360–1433), Johannes Nider (1380– 1438), and Oswald de Corda (13?–1434). The latter, a Vienna alumnus and author of a manual for Carthusian copyists and correctors of Latin manuscripts, Opus pacis, corresponded with Gerson, and translated several of his French works into Latin.26 Vienna scholars chose Gerson as their model, since ‘Jerome, Augustine, Gerson, and Heinrich of Langenstein [were] superior to the neoclassical poets of Italian humanism because the former employed language practically rather than artificially’.27 ‘Practically’ here means theologically, that is applying linguistic prowess and classical erudition as a medium for a greater purpose, theology, rather than as a goal in and of itself. For the Vienna faculty, caught at the crossroad between classicist Renaissance Italy and traditional medieval scholasticism, Gerson embodied a new type of theologian who, while passionate for affective theology, was open ‘toward the first stirrings of humanist, rhetorical renewal at Paris’.28 The combination of humanistic concerns with an earnest spiritual quest for contemplative life was what the Vienna faculty found inspirational in Gerson. As for the scholastic philosopher, theologian and mathematician Heinrich von Langenstein (1325–1397), his life presents some rather curious similarities to Gerson’s, to the point of causing confusion. Langenstein studied at the University of Paris, favored the idea of a general council as the remedy for the suppression of the Schism in his 1381 Epistola concilii pacis, had mystical tendencies, and even authored an ascetic treatise with the same\n\nEgan 2001, p. 179.

Langenstein’s Speculum was published in Strasbourg in 1507 by the main editor of Gerson texts Jacob Wimpheling. Furthermore, after leaving his position in Paris, Langenstein was invited in 1384 by Albrecht III, Duke of Austria (1349–1395), to come to Vienna in order to assist in the foundation of the theological faculty of the newly founded university. Unlike Gerson, Heinrich von Langenstein accepted the offer and spent the remainder of his life teaching fundamental theology, exegesis, and canon law in Vienna. The association of their names and the intriguing parallels between the two men’s biographies might have been responsible for the lasting confusion between these two authors. In the middle of the 16th century, the English jurist Christopher St Germain still attributed Langenstein’s writings to Gerson, further contributing to the misperception, which was to continue for at least two more centuries. It also makes one wonder whether some facts from Heinrich von Langenstein’s life have actually been confused with Gerson’s story. Yet, Heinrich von Langenstein might not be the only person to act as a possible prototype for Gerson’s German passage. The chancellor’s story of traveling through German lands and spreading ancient knowledge also corresponds to the biography of a Benedictine monk Peter von Rosenheim (1380–1433). Fra Peter not only participated in the Council of Constance — where he must have met and heard Gerson personally — but he also stayed at the Melk monastery, apparently around the same time as Gerson.30 This energetic monk also left a long-lasting impression at Melk and was credited with bringing humanist ideas from Italy to Vienna. Later, von Rosenheim reformed Salzburg’s Benedictine monastery, which ‘became a stimulating intellectual and spiritual center from the middle of the 15th century’.31 The library of this monastery was particularly famous for offering vernacular translations of Latin works, including those by Gerson.32 The bio29 While Langenstein’s Speculum animae was written between 1382–1384, the exact date of the completion of Gerson’s Miroir de l’ame is unknown.

The link between Gerson and Johannes Nider, Dominican theologian and dean of the Vienna faculty, is well established.33 Nider certainly knew the chancellor personally. While at Constance, ‘the assembly of the electrified intellectuals’,34 Nider attended the chancellor’s speeches, which made a big impression on him. His dependence on Gerson leaves no room for doubt. His major work Consolatorium timoratae conscientiae, ‘derives its lessons directly from Gerson’,35 drawing on several works ‘zusammenkompiliert’.36 The chancellor is mentioned directly at least twenty-two times as Magistro Io. De Gersono, cancellarius parisieni, Cancellarius or even simply Ioannnis. Concerning confessions, Part I of Consolatorium relies on what Cancellarius Parisiensis in suo tripartite [Opus tripartitum] sic dicens,37 while Part III, heavy with Gerson’s textual presence, is dependent on Libro suo de consolatione theologie, tractatu de pollutione Cancellari de gersono, tractatu de contractibus and De uita spirituali animae as its direct sources. In chapter VII, chapters from XV to XX, as well as in chapters XXII, XXIIII and XXVII uerba sunt per totum Cancellarii.38 Nider’s Consolatorium timoratae also addresses two typical and interrelated Gersonian issues: too scrupulous a conscience and moral certainty.39 Although the term scrupuli, meaning excessive moral scrupulosity, was used in the Middle Ages in reference to exaggerated anxious agitations of the soul caused by the idea of a moral or religious insufficiency of its bearer, the discussion of this subject attains an unprecedented intensity in Gerson’s works. See Brogl 2013; Tentler 1977. Hobbins 2006, p. 193. 35 Tentler 1977, p. 145. 36 Grosse 1994, p. 170. 37 Nider 1604, Oart 1, p. 23. 38 Nider 1604, part 3, p. 110 & p. 118. 39 Brogl 2013, p. 66: ‘Nider draws on Johannes Gerson first in Consolatorium because the thematic of the scrupulous conscience is to be found not yet so virulent in Thomas, highlighted by how the term scrupulosa conscientia is to be found neither in Thomas nor in Bonaventura’. 33 34\n\n37\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\nIt culminates in book three of De consolatione theologiae, where the word ‘anxiety’ or its synonyms abound, beginning with the declaration of Gerson’s alter ego Peregrinus: […] sollicitam enim super hoc auiditatem ex peruigili cordis mei cura quae te loco temporeque praeuenit, intellegis.40 While Gerson’s precursors suggested various therapeutic exercises meant to relieve excessive scrupulosity, he was the first to choose an approach that implied a change in the doctrine itself. Applying his characteristic circumstance-based reasoning, the French doctor asserted that when absolute moral certainty is impossible to attain, one should settle for a relative or probable certainty, which is sufficient for peace of mind. He coined the term moral certainty (certitudo moralis), according to which […] sufficit tertia certitudo qualis non semper scrupulos omnes abiicit, sufficit ut contemnat uel superet sic operando quasi non sint.41 Through this step, pregnant with major future developments in theology, commerce and jurisprudence, irrational anxieties and fears were to be mitigated,42 and Gerson’s ultimate goal of ‘inner calmness’,43 could be achieved. This innovative approach has been referred to as ‘probable certainty’ 44 or Gerson’s probabilism,45 although probabilism as a doctrine appeared only in the 16th century, well after the chancellor’s death.46 Even though Nider’s arguments derive from Gerson, his focus almost imperceptibly shifts from the more introspective, personal and spiritual one in De consolatione theologiae to a more legalistic and pragmatic one in Consolatorium. Gerson’s offer of consola De consolatione theologiae, OC: 9, p. 215. ‘You see my anxiety and eagerness and my sleepless heart’s care, for I arrived here before you’ (Miller 1998, p. 215). 41 Based on De consolatione theologiae, OC: 9, pp. 231–32. ‘The third kind of certainty which, although it does not always remove all scruples, suffices to disregard or overcome them [scruples] operating as if they were not there’. Also in Regulae morales, OC: 9, p. 123: Et haec uocatur certitudo moralis uel ciuilis, quod homo sufficienter probatus est. 42 Schüssler 2011, p. 452. 43 Suzanne 1981, p. 238. 44 Maryks 2008, p. 67. 45 Schüssler 2011, pp. 450–52. 46 Suzanne 1981, p. 235: ‘This moral uncertainty was understood as concerning the sinfulness of actions, which was due to the often-disputable validity of precepts in concrete cases’. Also see Fleming 2006. 40\n\n38\n\nCHAPTER 1 – THE BACKGROUND: GERSON AND THE LONG 15TH CENTURY\n\ntion is unconditional. It does not depend on whether a person is or is not in the state of grace, since God’s love is not completely withdrawn even from mortal sinners.47 Nider’s itemized scholastic analysis of moral certitude verges on an explicitly probabilistic approach. He writes: […] certitudo non remouet omnem improbabilitatem uel opinionem alterius partis: licet magis declinet ad ista qua ad alia. Q uod sufficit. Verba sunt pene totum cancellaru i tractatu de contractibus.48\n\nThe pene (‘almost’), which Nider allows himself as a divergence from his French mentor, consists in his merging, in a convoluted and labyrinthine manner, words from Gerson’s most personal work De consolatione theologiae with arguments taken from more canon-law related texts De contractibus and De uita spirituali animae. Yet, in doing so, the German theologian restates again and again that verba sunt per totum Cancelarii, ‘the words are all the Chancellor’s’.49 Following the chancellor, Nider also admits that certitudo naturalis, achievable in mechanics and mathematics, is not possible in civil and spiritual laws forming lex humana. In human affairs one must use a more flexible approach, derived from Aristotle and tirelessly promoted in Christian context by Gerson: 50 Necessaria est praceptorum discrete epikeysatio, seu interpretatione uel deductio. Equitas dicit Cancellarius est igitur Epikeyae Grosse 1994, p. 132. Nider 1604, p. 110. ‘[it …] certainly does not remove all the improbability or the position of the other party, even if it leans more to one position or the other. This is enough. The words are almost entirely those of the Chancellor’s De contractibus’. De contractibus, OC: 9, p. 402: […] quae certitudo non remouet in una parte omne probabilitatem uel opinionem alterius partis, licet magis declinet ab istam quam uel ad illam, quod sufficit. 49 Nider 1604, p. 111. Also, Nider 1604, p. 120: Unde Cancellarius super eadem auctoritate dicit […] ‘Whence the Chancellor spoke more about the same with authority’. 50 The Greek term ἐπιείκεια was first proposed by Aristotle. Applied to Greek and Roman law, it was further developed by Thomas Aquinas in Somma theologica. ‘Epikeia or equity ‘consists of the principles of natural justice so far as they are used to explain or correct a positive human law if this is not in harmony with […] positive law in its literal interpretation’.

Cathrein. 47 48\n\n39\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\nuirtutis considerare non nudum praeceptum, sed circumstantias omnes particulariter ipsum uestientes.51\n\nWe will return to the concept of epikeia and to the Nider-Gerson connection a little further on. Carthusian Tradition\n\nGerson’s sojourn in Austria was one of several parallel and interconnected elements that assured his omnipresence in the Empire after his death.52 Another was his connection, also personal, to the Carthusian tradition, which was particularly strong in what is now Austria. The chancellor’s ties with this Order had developed already during his lifetime. He regularly sent his works to the Grande Chartreuse from Lyons, while Carthusian monk Johannes Huiklene or Hinklene translated several of his treatises.53 The Carthusian connection was further reinforced by Vienna University’s historical bonds with the same Order. By 1458, former professors and students of the University of Vienna constituted more than a half of the nearby Carthusian community of Gaming, located in the foothills of the Austrian Alps.54 The most renowned monk of this monastery, the former Vienna university professor Nicolas Kempf (c. 1415–1497), espoused several features of Gersonian spirituality, such as emphasis on discretion and moderation, and the use of the vernacular for religious purposes. Kempf was particularly impressed with De consolatione theologiae, which he strove to emulate. The geographical proximity of Melk, where De consolatione was written, must have reinforced the connection. Making use of De consolatione as well as of another of Gerson’s texts, De uita spirituali animae, Kempf hoped to move\n\n51 Nider 1604, p. 134. ‘A descrete epikeysatio, or interpretation or deduction, of the precepts is necessary. The Chancellor says that equity is therefore the virtue of Epikeya, to be considered not as the naked precept, but with all the circumstances that specifically ‘dress’ it’. 52 Massaut 1968, p. 127: ‘Toute l’histoire du siècle qui le suivit est dominée par cette figure complexe, et hantée par son souvenir. Gerson devait garder après sa mort ‘l’omniprésence’. 53 Sönke 2002, p. 43. 54 Martin, 1992, p. 22. This work by Denis Martin constitutes the most extended existing study of Kempf.\n\n40\n\nCHAPTER 1 – THE BACKGROUND: GERSON AND THE LONG 15TH CENTURY\n\nfrom a theology of the intellect to the theology of the heart’.55 Another famous Carthusian, who explicitly cited Gerson as an authority on mystical theology, was Denys van Leeuwen, mostly known as Denys the Carthusian (1402–1471).56 His positions on the power of general councils and on mystical theology were ‘almost identical with those of Jean Gerson’.57 The chancellor’s Carthusian connection manifests itself in the sheer number of his works held in Carthusian libraries. Among them, the library of Basel holds a special place, for it became the third center of the distribution of his works after Constance and Vienna. The library’s success in accumulating Gerson’s editions was due to the Council of Basel (1432–1443), which became, after Constance, the most important event for ‘the spread of late medieval texts of all kinds’ 58 and of Gerson’s works in particular. The Basel collection is indicative of the early stages of what might be referred to as ‘Gerson’s frenzy’. Basel’s Moser catalogue, edited by Veronica Gerz-von Büren, contains 352 Gerson titles, all of Germanic origin, the majority of which belong to the second Martin 1992, p. 83. De uita spirituali animae, OC: 3, p. 127: Vis ergo secretum cognoscere? Transfer te a theologia intellectus ad theologiam affectus, de scientia scilicet ad sapientiam, de cognitione ad deuotionem. ‘Do you want to know a secret? Take yourself from theology of the intellect to theology of the affectivity, that is, from knowledge to wisdom, from cognition to devotion’. The same idea is also found in De consolatione theologiae, OC: 9, p. 237: […] ita theologum nominamus bonum uirum in sacris litteris eruditum; non quidem eruditione solius intellectus, sed multo magis affectus, ut ea quae per theologiam intelligit, traducat per iugem ruminationem in affectum cordis, et executionem operis […] ‘so we call a theologian a good man learned in the sacred writings, not in learning of the intellect merely, but much more of the heart. As a result, what he understands through theology he transfers through constant rumination to the affection of the heart and to the performance of good works’ (Miller 1998, p. 253). 56 Emery 1991, p. 21: In quibus assidue, Deo laus, exstiti studiosus, et multos legi auctores: scilicet super Sententias Thomae, Alberti […] Bonauenturae […], Richardi de Mediauilla […] Libros etiam sanctorum: Hieronymi, Ambrosii, Gregorii, Dionysii Areopagitae doctoris mei electissimi Boetii, Anselmi, Bernardi, Bedae, Hugonis de Sancto Victore, Gersonis, Guillelmi Parisiensis. ‘Thanks God, I studied assiduously, and read many authors, namely [the Commentary] on the Sentences by Thomas [Aquinas], Albert [the Great] […] Bonaventure […], Richard of Middleton […] as well as books by saints: Jerome, Ambrose, Gregory, Dionysius Areopagitis, my beloved [most chosen] doctor Boetius, Anselm [of Canterbury], Bernard [of Clairvaux], Beda, Hugues of St Victor, Gerson and Guillaume of Paris’. 57 Ewig 1936, pp. 60–61.

The corpus includes the five ‘full’ Gerson’s editions existing at the time: that of Cologne, 1483; of Strasbourg, 1488; of Basel, 1488; of Strasbourg, 1518, and that of Basel, 1518.59 As was the case at Melk, the vast majority of Gerson’s writings accumulated in Basel deals with reforming monastic life, mystical theology or pastoral care.60 Out of fifty-four volumes contained in the Basel library, eighteen are dedicated to spirituality, fifteen to religious life and pastoral duties, nine to doctrinal questions, seven to ecclesiology and five represent polemical treatises. Judging by the number of manuscripts of Gerson’s works, his Super Magnificat appears to be of special meaning for the Carthusians.61 Better known among musicologists, Super Magnificat reviews all contemporary musical instruments, their use and their particular effects on human senses.62 It explores the mystical connection between five musical notes, five vowels of the French language, and the five fingers of the hand, developing a special technique of internal or spiritual singing.63 It must also be noted that more works were acquired in time. Consequently, while Constance had given Gerson’s works an international audience, Basel and the Carthusians ‘gave readers the chance to collect his works systematically and on a great scale’.64 Besides Basel, another Carthusian house with an impor Gerz-von Büren 1973, p. 118. Gerz-von Büren 1973, p. 120. 61 Sönke et al. 2002, p. 118. 62 There were eight editions published in the Empire and in Switzerland, and one published in Paris in 1521 (See Vendrix 1997, pp. 1453–62). 63 An article published in 1904 underlines the unique character of Super Magnificat facsimile published by Conrad Fyner of Esslingen (Southern Germany) because musical notes, printed in black, and lines, printed in red, were certainly printed ‘at the same time and not punched in afterwards’ (Crotchet 1904, pp. 432–33). Art historian Kathi Meyer-Baer offered a hypothesis that the expressions of the singing angels on the famous Ghent Altar panel might correspond to five affections/notes/vowels described by Gerson in Super Magnificat: two negative, timor and dolor, and two positive, gaudium and spes, while the angel at the center can be understood as representing pietas or misericordia (Meyer-Baer 2015, p. 359). Gerson develops a similar theory in Tractatus de canticis, where he speaks of the correlation between vowels and the emotions they express: O timet, U que dolens odit, et esta notes. I uel Iota compassionem, O timorem, U dolorem uel odium (Tractatus de canticis, OC: 9, p. 542). For more details see Anttila 2013, pp. 42–49. Isabelle Fabre analyzes both of Gerson’s musical treatises (Fabre 2005). 64 Hobbins 2006, p. 213. 59 60\n\n42\n\nCHAPTER 1 – THE BACKGROUND: GERSON AND THE LONG 15TH CENTURY\n\ntant assortment of Gerson’s works was that of Erfurt in Thuringia. Its Lektürkanon contained, among others, Gerson’s De libris legendis a monachis, as well as a summary of his Exhortatio finalis ad stadium sacrae lectionis.65 We should not, however, ‘oversimplify a complicated picture’ 66 of Gersonian collections in Charterhouses. Although the Carthusian selection of Gerson’s works was ‘broad enough to reflect the complexity and wide interests of Gerson himself ’,67 its readers had little notion of him as a Latin orator and poet, and virtually nothing of him as the author writing and preaching in the vernacular. Of how much interest these aspects of his creativity would have been to the Carthusian monks is another question. What seems to be certain is that in this particular context ‘his legacy was taking shape as a moral and spiritual authority and guide to the religious life’ 68 both because of the nature of his readership and the nature of the supply to which his readers had access. Nicolas of Cusa and Bernhard von Waging\n\nThe intellectual relationship between cardinal Nicolas of Cusa (1401–1464) — a brilliant Renaissance mind, theologian, mathematician and astronomer — and Gerson is too vast a topic to be addressed by this study in any detail,69 but three important connections are necessary to mention. The first concerns Gerson’s reputation as a mystical theologian, which was challenged by a Carthusian monk named Vincent von Aggbach (1389–1464) in 1453. Initially very much in favor of the French master, whom he venerated according to the already established Carthusian tradition, Vincent subsequently turned against him, accusing the late chancellor of fundamental infidelity to Dionysian mystical theology. This complex controversy centered on a question that Gaspard (Kaspar) Aindorffer (Ayndorffer), abbot of Tegernsee\n\nWassermann 1994, p. 488. Hobbins 2006, p. 200. 67 Hobbins 2006, p. 200. 68 Hobbins 2006, p. 200. 69 On this controversy and Gerson-Cusa connection see Vansteenberghe 1920; Hopkins 1996; McGinn 2005; Mazour-Matusevich 2002; Vial 2006 & Vial 2014. 65 66\n\n43\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\nBenedictine monastery, formulated as follows: ‘whether without intellectual knowledge, or even any prior or accompanying thinking, a devout soul can attain God by affectus alone’.70 Gerson’s answer to this question is negative because even though he gave the priority to love — as so many other commentators had — he was also ‘anxious to maintain a place for mental understanding’,71 making sure that affectus and intellectus kept each other in check.72 This position provoked Vincent von Aggbach’s charge against Gerson of willful misrepresentation of the true meaning of Dionysius’ teaching. At Aindorffer’s prompting, Nicolas of Cusa came to Gerson’s aid, declaring that the chancellor did no violence to the Dionysian doctrine. There is no doubt that the cardinal knew Gerson’s works, including both Theologia Mystica Speculatiua and Theologia Mystica Practica, which ‘had popularity in learned circles’, including Cusa’s ‘correspondents and opponents’.73 ‘Displaying agreement with ideas from Gerson’,74 the cardinal rejected Vincent’s position that the mystical ascent could be effectuated only by love without knowledge. Cusa’s ‘notion of the hunt for God’,75 reminiscent of Gerson’s theology of spiritual quest — the middle ground between quietism and theology of merits, based on Hebrews 11:6: ‘God rewards those who seek him’ — might warrant further investigation.76\n\nLetter of Gaspar Aindorffer to Nicolas of Cusa, McGinn 2005 p. 452. McGinn 2005, p. 451. 72 La Montagne de contemplation, OC: 7: 1, p. 37: ‘Il est certain que la vie de créature raisonnable est plus en l’ouvrage d’entendement et de raison que ailleurs, c’est a dire en pensées raisonnables et en dilection voluntaire’. ‘It is certain that the life of the rational creature concentrates more on the work of understanding and reason than on anything else. It is concerned with rational thought and voluntary love’ (McGuire 1998, p. 103). 73 Hopkins 1988, p. 15. McGinn 2005, p. 451. 74 Hopkins 1988, p. 15 & 16: ‘In mystical theology, he answered in a manner reminiscent of Gerson, knowledge must accompany love. For whatever is loved is loved under the aspect of the good — i.e., is loved as being a good. So if the soul did not deem God to be a good, it would not love Him; and if it loves Him, it deems Him a good. This judging, or deeming, is the intellectual, or cognitive, component that is necessary for love’. 75 McGinn 2005, p. 456. 76 For a detailed analysis of Gerson’s theology of spiritual quest see MazourMatusevich 2004, chapter 5. 70 71\n\n44\n\nCHAPTER 1 – THE BACKGROUND: GERSON AND THE LONG 15TH CENTURY\n\nThe second nexus is conciliarist. In 1434 Cusa published De Concordantia catholica, where he favorably presented the chancellor’s views on the superiority of the council over the papal authority.77 The third link pertains to what constitutes the greatest difference between these two late medieval minds. It has to do with the question of the relationship between intellect and affect in mystical theology. Gerson had a consistent preoccupation with simple believers, which was pastoral in nature. This concern was relevant, for example, to his evaluation of Ruysbroeck and some other mystics, whose language he deemed either too intellectually challenging or too dangerously unguarded for the general audience. The doctor consolatorius saw a likelihood that ‘any necessity for cognitive abandonment would exclude simple believers from the uia mystica — since many such believers would be incapable of attaining the state of pura intelligentia’ — as intolerable.78 It contradicted his goal of opening contemplative life to all those who longed for it. Cusa, by contrast, was no moral theologian,79 and he ‘shows no signs of supposing that the pathway of mystical theology is available to all believers’.80 While Gerson accommodated ‘version of theologia mystica to the uia deuotionis’,81 open to all souls in search of God, no such concern is visible in Cusa. Nicolas Cusa’s friend and ‘the most fervent admirer’,82 distinguished monastic theologian and Benedictine friar, Bernhard von Waging (1400–1472) valued Gerson as an expert on contemplative life, referring to him as doctor insignis et emeritus or just cancellarius in his major work Consolatorium tribulatorum, which is more or less a compilation of the chancellor’s writings. See Watanabe 1993; Oakley 2015. Hopkins 1988, p. 97. 79 Jacob 1953, p. 169. 80 Hopkins 1988, p. 97. 81 Hopkins 1988, p. 97: ‘Gerson introduces his second route, the uia deuotionis. Through faith and love, he explains, the soul of the simple, fervent believer can attain unto the same heights as the soul of the erudite- i.e., can attain unto ecstasy and can do so without the precondition of intellectual detachment. For through the edifying quality of his devout love the simple believer can become released from attachment to the world in order to soar upward unto the Beauty of the Lord’. 82 Jacob 1953, p. 166. 77 78\n\n45\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\nWith entire passages inserted without acknowledgement, Consolatorium’s chapters one to four are taken from De remediis contra pusillanimitatem, chapters five and six from Super Magnificat, and chapter seven, for the most part, from Nider’s Consolatorium conscientiae timoratae, which itself is a compilation of Gerson’s texts. In the Prologue to Consolatorium, Bernhard openly and proudly states his dependence on Gerson’s De remediis contra pusillanimitatem. To do so at the very beginning of his work, he must have expected his readers to recognize Gerson’s name,83 using it as an advertisement. It was an exceptional honor, since von Waging considered very few theologians, among either veteri or moderni, to be true witnesses of the contemplative experience.84 Several of Bernhard’s writings (Laudatorium doctae ignorantiae, Defensorium laudatorii doctae ignorantiae and De cognoscendo Deum) are part of the same Dionysian controversy discussed above. After reading Nicolas of Cusa, Bernhard identified theologia mystica with docta ignorantia and favored — against Vincent but with Gerson — a balanced relationship between intellectus and affectus. Von Waging also endorsed both Gerson’s criticism of certain monastics, who wear the habit but whose life is corrupt and immoral,85 and explicitly supported his views of the pope as being seruum seruorum.86 Nevertheless, von Waging implicitly reversed some of Gerson’s theological novelties, all the while exhibiting the Hohenadel 2015, p. 67. Treusch 2011, p. 101. On Bernhard von Waging also see Kaup 2013, pp. 23–24. 85 Rieman 1985, pp. 264–66: […] inter haec monachis et claustralibus […] testatur contra magis uidemus insolentes, magis carnales, magis tenaces, magis auaros […] Q uocirca monachi quidem sunt exteriori habitu, sed uita, sed operibus, sed internae conscientiae spurcitia a perfectione, quam habitus ille demonstrat longissime disiuncti. ‘Among these monks and those living in cloisters there are insolent, very carnal, very obstinate, very avaricious […] Therefore indeed these are monks by exterior habit, but by life, deeds and corruption of internal conscience, they are most remotely disjoined from the perfection that this habit expresses’. 86 Rieman 1985, p. 71: Nempe ut ait doctor insignis et emeritus Iohannis de Gersona praetactus: omnis dominatio, primatus et praelatio est uerissime seruitus, nec frustra nec ficte nec mendose dicit se summus pontifex seruum seruorum tamquam habens omnes homines impositos super caput suum redditurus de omnibus rationem. ‘Of course, like the already mentioned famous and venerable Jean Gerson said: all government, primacy and authority is most truly a servitude; the supreme pontiff says neither vainly nor insincerely nor falsely that he is servant of servants having people put on his head, giving an account of everything’. 83 84\n\n46\n\nCHAPTER 1 – THE BACKGROUND: GERSON AND THE LONG 15TH CENTURY\n\nmost reverential attitude toward him. One of these reversals concerns, as in the case of Nicolas of Cusa, the chancellor’s eagerness to open the contemplative life to the laity. Although for different reasons than Cusa (who was, like Gerson, a secular cleric), von Waging did not share the latter’s enthusiastic program of contemplative life for all. Q uoting Gerson’s major work De mystica theologia practica, von Waging articulated his view of the contemplative life as a monastic prerogative: Respondeo ex intentione doctoris praenominati olim Parisiensis cancellarii, quod claustralis deditus contemplationi et internae quieti multum proficit quam tam aliis quam sibi primo. Multum proficit sibi ipsi, cum ut sic in uita contemplatiua multo plus placeat deoquam in uita actiua.87\n\nAnother theological novelty that Fra Bernhard chose to suppress was Gersonian notion of simultaneously maintaining active and contemplative modes of life: ‘[…] et qui porroit ensemble tenir l’une vie et l’autre parfaitement, ce seroit le meilleur’.88 The focus of Fra Bernhard’s works — despite their general titles Speculum pastorum et animarum restorum and Defensorium specula pastorum et animarum rectorum 89 — is inner reform and monastic contemplative life understood as one and the same thing. Rhine Humanists: Geiler von Kaysersberg, Jacob Wimpheling and Johannes Trithemius\n\nWhile monastics and academics were guardians and consumers of Gerson’s works, the credit of printing and publishing them should be fully given to another group of people: Rhine humanists, the ‘toujours et encore le relais rhénan’,90 whom Pierre Chaunu considered the most active and energetic intellectual community in 87 Rieman 1985, p. 78. ‘I respond on the basis of the intention of the previously mentioned doctor and formerly Parisian chancellor, that the monk devoted to contemplation and inner quiet greatly profits others as well as himself. He greatly profits himself since in the contemplative life he pleases God more than in the active life’. 88 La Montagne de contemplation, OC: 7: 1, p. 36. ‘The best would be if one could maintain both ways of life [contemplative and active] completely’ (McGuire 1998, p. 101). 89 Rieman 1985, pp. 70–268. 90 Chaunu 1981, p. 92.\n\n47\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\nlate medieval Europe. This milieu included professor, prior, and then chancellor of the Sorbonne, Johannes Heynlin von Stein, known in France as Jean Lapide (?1430–1496),91 Strasbourg preacher Johannes Geiler von Kaysersberg or Keysersberg (1445– 1510), Strasbourg printer Peter (Pierre) Schott (1427–1504), the already-mentioned humanist Jacob Wimpheling (1450–1528), Bishop of Basel Christoph von Utenheim (c. 1450–1527), poet and satirist Sebastian Brant (1457–1521), Basel publisher Johann Amerbach (1444–1511), poet laureate Thomas Murner (1475– 1537), brilliant humanist Beatus Rhenanus (1483–1547), scholar of Greek and Hebrew and Melanchthon’s future tutor Johannes Reuchlin (1455–1522), humanist monk Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516) and others. These remarkable men, who belonged to what Brian McGuire christened ‘the last medieval reformation’,92 were united ‘in their mutual effort at ecclesiastical and educational reform, and in their unanimous esteem for the unofficial fifth ‘church father’, Jean Gerson’.93 While Gerson’s pastoral theology and pedagogical objectives corresponded to the reforma perpetua program of 15th century German mystical humanists both in and outside monasteries, subjectivist and moralistic aspects of his religiosity resonated with their ‘immense appétit du divin’.94 A double process took place: on the one hand, the reception of Gerson was one of the central points of a ‘distinctly religious revival’ 95 in the late 15th century Germanic Europe, on the other, it is this very revival that allowed Gerson’s ideas laßten weiter 96 in this geographical and cultural milieu. 91 The countless spellings of names under which he was known creates confusion: Heynlein, Henelyn, Henlin, Hélin, Hemlin, Hegelin, Lapierre, de la Pierre, Steinlin, Lapidanus. The date of his death varies from 1496 to 1505. He is also often understandably confused with another Johannes de Lapide from England, who, besides having exactly the same name, also studied in Paris at the same time (1418). For Heynlin’s other works, see Tilly 1990, col. 810–12. 92 This is the title of McGuire’s biography of Gerson. 93 Oberman 1981, p. 38. Gerson’s works were printed continuously: Monotessaron, Ars moriendi, Cologne, 1468 & 1482; Modus uiuendi omnium Christi fideliu, Cologne 1470; Marienthal, Urach 1480 & Cologne, 1510; Sermo de uirginis marie, Cologne, 1480; Sermo de passione in latinum traductus, Strasbourg, 1509 & 1510; Basel 1515, to name just a few. 94 Fèvre 1957, p. 37. 95 Holt 2005, p. 14. 96 Smolinsky 2005, p. 261 & p. 362.\n\n48\n\nCHAPTER 1 – THE BACKGROUND: GERSON AND THE LONG 15TH CENTURY\n\nNowhere else in the Empire was Gerson’s spiritual presence more pronounced than in the imperial city of Strasbourg,97 and no one in Strasbourg was more receptive to it than this city’s celebrated preacher Johannes Geiler von Kaysersberg, who ‘venerates Gerson to the point of being called his illustrator’.98 The Strasbourg preacher played a crucial role in the preservation of Gerson’s written legacy, as some of the latter’s texts are only known to us thanks to Geiler’s edition.99 It opens with the epitaph, which expresses Geiler’s distinct perception of the Parisian master as fortis in ecclesia bellator maxime Gerson, armatus gladio (‘a strong warrior in the church armed with a sword’).100 It is a militant image, likely to please someone like Ignatius of Loyola less than fifty years later. The chancellor’s impact on Geiler was profound, manifold and vast, and his dependency on Gerson’s ideas is well known.101 It seems to permeate not only Geiler’s ideas but his personality, preaching style and active civil position. Having ‘adopted Gerson as his model’ 102 as ‘more than a theologian, but an engaged pastor of Saint-Jean-en-Grèves’,103 Geiler became ‘the religious and political conscience of the city council of the Free City of Strasbourg’.104 Characteristically, one of his first pastoral struggles, at the beginning of his service in Strasbourg, was his unconditional opposition to the common custom of refusing confession, communion and Christian burial to those condemned to death.105 This was one of Gerson’s concerns as well. In Requête pour les condamnés à mort the chancellor pleaded for compassion even for the worst of criminals.106 Geiler picked up the battle where Gerson 97 Kraume 1980 p. 82: ‘Hatte der Straßburger Kreis wesentlichen Anteil daran, dass Gerson gegen Ende des 15. Jahrhunderts in Deutschland besser bekannt war als in Frankreich selbst’. On Gerson’s influence among German humanists see Posset 2005; Ritter 2010. 98 Arnaud 2006, p. 251, citing Herding 1970, p. 51. 99 Ouy 1998, p. x. 100 Wimpheling 1514.

The custom was abandoned, and the clergy was allowed to regularly administer communion to condemned criminals.107 An outstanding orator famed for his capacity to attract crowds, Geiler largely based his preaching on Gerson’s sermons, which he sometimes followed verbatim.108 He appealed to his spiritual guide under a variety of names: christenlich Lerer Joannes Gerson, Gerschon, Cancellarius, der grosse lerer Gerschon, cancilarius, kancelarius Barydietzis, kanzelar Baridientziss, kanzelar Baridyenßyß, kanzelar Barydienziss, kanzelar Barydyentziss, Johannes Canciliarius, kanzelar and kantzeler. Even when Geiler was not quoting Gerson directly, he took over his spiritual mentor’s ‘subjects and positions, which he then handles and presents to his audience in an easily accessible form’.109 For example, out of twenty-five of his Augsburg sermons, where Gerson is directly mentioned at least twenty-two times, nineteen represent close reworking of Gerson’s texts, and specifically the Mountain of Contemplation, while in the remaining six ‘die frommigkeittheologischen Grundpositionen des Pariser Kanzlers’ can be clearly perceived.110 Among these theological Grundpositionen are ‘fundamental relationality in an older mystical tradition’,111 death preparation, psychological insights on dealing with contemplative practices, evangelical harmonization, confession, consolation of the Holy Cross, mental pilgrimage and spiritual begging. Theological relationality, meaning a spirituality centered on a personal relationship or even a friendship with God, found expression in Geiler’s reworking of Gerson’s Mountain of Contemplation in the cycle of sermons appropriately called Der Berg des Schauens and published in 1492.112 In this cycle, where he creatively combines segments from Mountain of ContemplaToute loy ou estat au contraire des vérités dessus dittes est injuste, desraisonnalble et non a tenir pour quelconque proffit ou dammaige qui en doye venir a la chose publique’. 107 Backus 2004, p. 119. 108 Lieberman 1965, p. 294.

Vnd dar umb sprechen wir jm pater noster nit gemachel oder herr, sonder: Vater noster […]116\n\nHowever, while introducing the work of ‘der kantzelar Barydyentziss’ as written for ‘sein leiplich schwostren’ (‘his beloved sisters’), who were ‘die junckfrawen’ (young women), whom their brother let stay together ‘jn ain hauss vnd nit ain closter’ (at home and not at the cloister),117 Geiler chooses to skip Gerson’s confidence in his sisters’ entendement (understanding).118 Instead, McGuire 1997. Freiehagen-Baumgardt & Williams-Krapp 2015, p. xxxiv. 115 La mendicité spirituelle, OC: 7: 1, pp. 316–17. 116 Freiehagen-Baumgardt & Williams-Krapp 2015, p. 198. ‘[God] should be beheld as a kind father, says Gerson. And this is why we speak to him as our father and not as our consort or lord but rather: Our Father.’ 117 Freiehagen-Baumgardt & Williams-Krapp 2015, p. 40: ‘der kantzelar Barydyentziss der schryb dise wort seinen schwostren. Er hot fier schwostren, waren und sein leiplich schwostren. Die tot er zusamen jn ain hauss vnd nit ain closter’. ‘The Parisian chancellor who wrote these words to his sisters. He had four sisters, who were his beloved sisters. He put them together at home and not in a cloister’. Sur l’excellence de la virginité, OC: 7: 1, p. 419: ‘car a vray dire — et sans blasme de religion — je navoye pas inclinacion grande que vous fucies mises en religion que je cougneusse, pour causes plusieurs qui a ce me mouvoyent’. 118 La Montagne de contemplation, OC: 7: 1, p. 16: ‘Si n’est chose plus convenable pour escripre a mes dictes sueurs qui par le don de Dieu ont entrepris pieca vivre sans mariage, que de les enseignier comment elles plairont a Dieu […] Et ne me retarde point de ce faire la simplesse de mes dittes seurs car je n’ai entencion de dire chose qu’elles ne puissent bien comprendre selonc l’entendement que j’ai esprouvé en elles’. ‘Therefore, nothing is more fitting, in writing to my sisters, who by God’s gift set out some time ago to live without marriage, than to teach them how they will please God […] The lack of learning of my sisters cannot keep them from going ahead, for I intend to speak only about what they can fully grasp according to the understanding that I have found in them’ (McGuire 1998, p. 75). 113 114\n\n51\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\nhe indulgingly stated that the given material is ‘nit zu schwer say noch zu hoch zu verstan’ (‘is not too difficult and nor too lofty to understand’) anyway.119 Anyone who has read The Mountain of Contemplation would find Geiler’s statement inaccurate, and Gerson’s faith in his sisters’ intellectual abilities impressive. Indirectly revealing his misogyny that would influence his exceptionally harsh stance toward witches, Geiler also leaves out Gerson’s explicit intent to write about spiritual matters more to women than to men.120 One also cannot help noticing that in these series of sermons, Gerson’s nuanced attitude loses sophistication and subtlety in Geiler’s over-simplified rendition of the chancellor’s psychological insights on dealing with contemplative practices: Gerson: […] la maniere de tenir son corps pourfïte a avoir ferme pensée, et que la personne se mette en tele disposition qu’il luy plaira mieus, soit a genolz, soit en estant, soit au séant, soit en s’enclinant ou apuyant, ou soit en gisant. Et c’est ce a entendre quant la personne est seule […] 121 Geiler: Der kanzler Baridyenßyß der schreibt von ainem, aber er maint sich selb, der testu sprechen: wann jch schon allain pin, weiß jch doh gar nichtz, wye jch mich halten soll oder sain umb gaun oder ob jch kniegen sol. […] Doch so kan man dir nit all wegen sagen, wye du dich halten solt. Du solt auch\n\nFreiehagen-Baumgardt & Williams-Krapp 2015, p. 40. La Montagne de contemplation, OC: 7: 1, p. 16: ‘Aucuns se pourront donner merveille pourquoy, de matiere haulte comme est parler de la vie contemplative, je vueil escripre en francois plus qu’en latin et plus aux femmes que aux hommes, et que ce n’est pas matiere qui appartiengne a gens simples sans lettre’. ‘Some persons will wonder and ask why, in a matter so lofty as that of the contemplative life, I choose to write in French rather than in Latin, and more to women that to men. They will say that such a subject is not appropriate for ordinary people who have no Latin’ (McGuire 1998, p. 75). Geiler’s fanatical misogyny and his extreme stance toward witches, which cannot be discussed here, are hard to reconcile with Hamm’s opinion of Geiler as an example of a ‘moderate, accommodating, balancing mediation of God’s severity and mercy’ (Hamm 2018, p. 337). 121 La Montagne de contemplation OC: 7: 1, p. 34. ‘the manner of bodily posture contributes to our having clarity of thought. A person should prepare herself in the manner that will serve her best, whether kneeling, standing, sitting, bowing, or leaning up against something, or perhaps lying down. I refer to the situation when the person is alone’ (McGuire 1998, p. 98). 119\n\n120\n\n52\n\nCHAPTER 1 – THE BACKGROUND: GERSON AND THE LONG 15TH CENTURY\n\nit söllichen dingen nit ton, das wyder dein natur sey. […] du sytzest oder standest oder knyegest oder ob du joch auf der erd ligst, das jst vor got alles gleich.122\n\nGeiler’s interpretation of Gerson’s Scientia mortis, although very close to the original, also displays a stylistic move downward, his style being much more folkloristic, with metaphors and examples lying well outside the scholarly spectrum. Geiler thus likens the man longing for his heavenly home to ‘einem Hündehen, das keine Ruhe hat, wenn es nicht bei seinem Herrn ist’ — (‘a doggy, which has no peace, when it is not with its owner’).123 While it is not readily evident whether Geyler’s collection of sermons, Der Passion oder das lyden Jesu Christi vnsers herren/noch dem text der fyer Euangelisten, which he ‘zu Strassburg järlich geprediget hatt’,124 is directly inspired by Gerson, his written Passion des herrn Jesu […] geteilt in stückes weiß eins süßen Lebkuchen ußgeben, published in 1514 by Johanes Grüninger, relies on the chancellor’s template in a more obvious manner. Even though Geiler does not mention the words ‘evangelical harmony’ or the title of Gerson’s Monotessaron, which will be discussed in detail further on, he quotes the chancellor twelve times in direct relation to his rendition of the Passion: ‘item Gerson in seinem passion spricht’, ‘Dies sprichet Gerson mitt weitern worten’,125 ‘dann nach Gerson oben sagt’,126 ‘wie solten wir lernen und mit Gerson sagen’,127 ‘Dies sagt Gerson im seinem passion’,128 or ‘darum spricht Gerson uber das magnificat/tractatu. ix. particolae. Iiif ’.129\n\n122 Freiehagen-Baumgardt & Williams-Krapp 2015, pp. 114–15. ‘The Parisian chancellor wrote about others but he meant himself when he said the following: when I am alone, I know not how I should hold myself, standing or kneeling. One cannot tell you all the manners how you should hold yourself. You should not do such things that are against your nature. […] whether you sit or stand or kneel or lies on the ground, to God is all the same’. 123 Hoch 1901, p. 36. 124 Geyler von Keysersberg 1522. ‘He had preached yearly in Strasburg’. 125 Geyler von Keysersberg 1514, p. xi. 126 Geyler von Keysersberg 1514, p. xxv. 127 Geyler von Keysersberg 1514, p. xxvi. 128 Geyler von Keysersberg 1514, p. xlvii. 129 Geyler von Keysersberg 1514, p. lxxxv.\n\n53\n\nLE PÈRE DU SIÈCLE: THE EARLY MODERN RECEPTION OF JEAN GERSON\n\nSubject to excessive anxiety in his role as a confessor, Geiler was parti"
