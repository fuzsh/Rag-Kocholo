After teaching at Hampton University, she moved to the University of Virginia’s College, located in Wise, Virginia, where she gained a well-earned reputation as a teacher, winning the Harrison Award for Outstanding Teaching. Although she taught a number of medieval courses, including one on Byzantium and Islam, her research centered around the late-medieval history of England and France. Professor Sample produced as her thesis an edition of the documents dealing with the dispute over the county of Artois. She delivered several papers and published articles on Robert of Artois, one of which appeared in 2006 in Shell Games: Studies in Scams, Frauds, and Deceits (1300–1650) (Toronto, 2004).

Although much of his academic work has been largely devoted to the explorations of modern French poetry and poetics, Vernier has maintained his early interest in medieval studies, as exemplied by some of his most most recent works including the\n\nlist of contributors\n\nxix\n\ntranslation from Catalan of The Dream of Bernat Metge (Ashgate, 2002) and a biography of a leading medieval military gure, The Flower of Chivalry: Bertrand du Guesclin and the Hundred Years War (Woodbridge, Sufok, 2003). He is currently completing a biography of Gaston III Phoebus, Count of Foix (1331–1391). L. J.

Villalon, who specializes in late medieval and early modern European history, has delivered numerous conference papers and his articles have appeared in both collections and scholarly journals including the Sixteenth Century Journal, the Catholic Historical Review, Mediterranean Studies, and the Proceedings of the Ohio Academy of History. He has co-edited four other volumes of medieval essays—The Final Argument: The Imprint of Violence on Society in Medieval and Early Modern Europe (Woodbridge, Suffolk 1998), The Circle of War in the Middle Ages: Essays on Medieval Military and Naval History (Woodbridge, Suffolk, 1999), Crusaders, Condottieri, and Cannon: Medieval Warfare in Societies around the Mediterranean (Leiden, 2002), and The Hundred Year War: A Wider Focus (Woodbridge, Suffolk). Currently, he is working on studies dealing with the canonization of San Diego and the life of Sir Hugh Calveley, while he and co-editor Donald Kagay are preparing a joint monograph dealing with the War of the Two Pedros (1356–1366). In addition to his major eld, Villalon has published articles on automotive history and the history of World War I. He has received several grants for study in Spain, including a Fulbright, two awards from the American Association of University Professors for defending academic freedom, and in 2001, he was presented the Professional-Scholarly Activity Award for the University College at the University of Cincinnati. David Whetham took a degree in Philosophy at the London School of Economics, and then went on to earn a Masters Degree in War Studies at King’s College, London. After time spent traveling around the Great Lakes region of Africa, he returned to King’s College to complete a PhD in War Studies. Whetham spent time working as a researcher for BBC History, and then joined the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe [OSCE] in Kossovo, supporting the 2001 and 2002 elections. His main research interests are focused on the ethical dimensions of warfare and the development of the laws of war, but he also retains a keen interest in medieval warfare.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nOnce again, the editors wish to thank people whose efforts have helped bring this volume into print.

As was the case with the earlier volume, volume two has also tried to include revisionist articles that take a fresh look at even such well-studied topics as the battles of Crécy (1346) and Agincourt (1415). The rst part, “Broader Horizons of the Hundred Years War,” contains a single article, “The Hundred Years Wars: Not One War But Many” by Kelly DeVries, that establishes the volume’s overall point of view. DeVries briey surveys the military history of this period, looking at the interrelated series of conicts that occurred throughout Western Europe, while showing how they were inextricably linked to the Anglo-French struggle and, in many cases, to one another. Starting with Scotland, his essay supplies a gazeteer of military and political activity occurring in the Holy Roman Empire, the Iberian kingdoms of Castile, Navarre, Portugal, and the Crown of Aragon, the Low Countries, and Burgundy, stressing that most of the wars were really part of the one larger conict. From the perspective of a historian highly conversant with the literature of the period, DeVries also suggests fruitful directions in which future scholarship on the Hundred Years War might proceed. The second part, “Agincourt and its Aftermath,” focuses in on the conict’s best known and best-documented battle, later immortalized in William Shakespeare’s Henry V. By closely analyzing not only the contemporary chronicles, but also the most recent archaeological and technological evidence, Clifford Rogers has produced in his article “The Battle of Agincourt” what is arguably the most thorough and\n\n1 The Hundred Years War: A Wider Focus, ed. L. J. Andrew Villalon and Donald J. Kagay (Leiden, 2005).\n\nxxvi\n\nintroduction\n\nsophisticated treatment to date, one that any future scholarship on this encounter will have to address. Among the topics on which Rogers sheds new light are the formation and tactics employed by both side, the probable numbers involved, the actual effect of the English arrow rain, the penetrative power of the longbow, and the explanation for the magnitude of French defeat despite an overwhelming numerical superiority. Included with Rogers’s essay are several detailed appendices further exploring technical matters raised in the text. A second article in this section, “Grief and Memory after the Battle of Agincourt” by Megan Cassidy-Welch deals with the psychological toll the battle exacted on survivors and their families, in particular those who had been on the losing side. For the French, public and private grief was deeply felt and emotionally expressed not only by veterans and families mourning their dead, but also by a society crushed by defeat. It was memorialized in private funeral ceremonies and in state-sponsored rites and writings aimed at keeping alive the memory of those who lost their lives at Agincourt. Among the reactions closely examined are those of chroniclers, including the foremost female writer of the period, Christine de Pizan. In Part Three of this volume, “The Iberian Face of the Hundred Years War,” a pair of papers focuses on a theatre of conict far from central stage, but one which would on several occasions in the second half of the fourteenth century greatly inuence the war’s course. In the mid-1360s, during a hiatus in the ghting north of the Pyrenees that followed the Treaty of Brétigny (1360), the Hundred Years War spilled across the mountains into Iberia where it merged with a decade-long struggle, the War of the Two Pedro’s (1356–1366), being fought primarily between Castile and the Crown of Aragon, but also involving to a lesser extent the other Iberian kingdoms of Granada, Portugal, and Navarre. Essays by Andrew Villalon and Donald Kagay explore from opposite sides this regional conict which touched off two invasions of Castile (1366 and 1367) by English, French, Gascon, and Breton forces, invasions that brought into play many leading gures from the larger struggle, including the Black Prince and the future constable, Beltran duGuesclin. In “Cut Off Their Head’s or I’ll Cut Off Yours: Castilian Strategy and Tactics in the War of the Two Pedros and the Supporting Evidence from Murcia,” Villalon treats the lengthy assault on his eastern neighbor launched by the Castilian monarch, Pedro I “the Cruel” (1350–1366/69); in particular, highlighting the counterproductivity of Pedro’s “strategy of terror” and stressing the importance of\n\nintroduction\n\nxxvii\n\nsurviving evidence from the archives at Murcia. By contrast, Kagay has produced an article, “The Defense of the Crown of Aragon during the War of the Two Pedros (1356–1366),” based on extensive research in Barcelona’s Archivo de la Corona de Aragón, which closely examines the complex array of defensive actions employed by Pedro’s Aragonese opponent, Pere III (aka Pedro IV) (1337–1387) in his attempt to counter Castilian aggression. Ultimately, the events in Spain set the stage for a signicant intervention by both France and England (1366–1367) that in turn did much to bring about a renewal of fullscale warfare between the two countries in 1369. What would any collection on the Hundred Years War be without some treatment of the most effective missile weapons of the Middle Ages: the English longbow and the crossbow employed by most continental armies? Part Four, “The Technical Aspects of Archery in the Hundred Years War” serves this purpose. In “The English Longbow: A Revolution in Technology?” David Whetham supplies a ne summary of the evolution of the English longbow, indicating that what was new to the central and later Middle Ages was not the weapon itself, but the way in which the weapon was used in battle. Long, powerful bows had actually been in use for centuries by various cultures; on the other hand, massed and coordinated volleys had begun to emerge as a potent force on the eld of battle only toward the end of the thirteenth century. It was this tactical use of the weapon that led to the great English victories of the Hundred Years War, in turn giving rise to myths extolling the longbow’s newness and invincibility. The second article, “The Longbow-Crossbow Shootout at Crécy (1346): Has the ‘Rate of Fire Commonplace’ Been Overrated?” by Russell Mitchell, takes a fresh look at the alleged matchup between the two weapons that occurred during the initial stages of the battle of Crécy (1346). Rather than reafrming the conventional wisdom that this confrontation reected the absolute technological superiority of the former over the latter, Mitchell argues that Crécy was not really a meaningful test of two weapons systems going head-to-head with one another. Instead, the highly-professional Genoese crossbowmen ghting in the service of France, realizing that they had been thrown into the mêlée almost as an afterthought and without a crucial piece of their equipment (the pavises that would have helped shield them from the rain of English arrows) hastily red a volley or two, then withdrew from the eld before any real exchange with the enemy could develop.\n\nxxviii\n\nintroduction\n\nAccording to Mitchell, it was this precipitate withdrawal that probably spurred the French king to accuse his Genoese mercenaries of treason and order his horsemen to ride them down. Mitchell further argues that had the French waited for arrival of the crossbowmen’s baggage containing their pavises and only then committed to battle the potent weapons system they represented, the story of Crécy might have been very different. Part Five—“Military Participants in the Hundred Years War”—examines three signicant gures to come out of the conict and a famous exercise in chivalry uncharacteristic of the bloody struggle. In “Philip VI’s Mortal Enemy: Robert of Artois and the Beginning of the Hundred Years War,” Dana Sample reevaluates the role of Robert, Count of Artois, in inciting the conict, reafrming to an extent the view of contemporary chroniclers that attribute to this slippery gure a greater role than most modern historians concede to him. Steven Muhlberger’s essay, “The Combat of the Thirty against Thirty: An Example of Medieval Chivalry?” examines a famous chivalric episode of the year 1350 that pitted thirty Franco-Breton knights against a like number of Englishmen and their allies. Muhlberger shows that just how chivalric this event truly was depends largely on what sources the historian credits: the principal chroniclers of the event, Jean le Bel and Jean Froissart, paint the combat in far more knightly colors than does a highly partisan Breton poet who saw the English as evil and rejoiced at their defeat. In “John Hawkwood: Florentine Hero and Faithful Englishman,” William Caferro continues his examination of the career of the English adventurer begun in the rst volume of this collection. Here, Caferro shows that the conversion of this refugee from the Hundred Years War into a Florentine hero has been overstated throughout the centuries; that, in fact, his conversion suited the propagandistic needs of Florence and his national loyalties may have remained far more English than earlier historians ever imagined. Richard Vernier’s “The Afterlife of a Hero: Bertrand du Guesclin Imagined” traces how one of the two great French heroes of the Hundred Years War, Constable Bertrand du Guesclin, has been viewed over succeeding centuries and how his image has changed to meet the needs of subsequent generations. Vernier also compares du Guesclin’s afterlife to that of Joan of Arc, the premier French hero of the conict. The nal part, “Fiscal, Literary and Psychological Aspects of the Hundred Years War,” contains three articles. In “Purveyance and\n\nintroduction\n\nxxix\n\nPeasants at the Beginning of the Hundred Years War: Maddicott Reexamined,” Ilana Krug focuses on the system of purveyance through use of which the English monarchy secured at favorable prices foodstuffs for its armies serving on the continent. Krug argues that the primary authority on purveyance, H. R. Maddicott, overstates the negative effect the system had on the English peasantry. Lia Ross examines the works of a leading French literary gure of the later fourteenth century in her article, “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Visions of Burgundy, France, and England in the Oeuvres of Georges Chastellain.” In the opening sections of his chronicle that have survived, Chastellain, who is writing for the most part after the conict has ended, supplies a retrospective view of the Hundred Years War. Although Chastellain primarily served the duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good (1419–1467), who had in the early years of his reign sided with England against France, the chronicle is in general pro-French and vitriolically anti-English. As a result, the author takes pains to explain and excuse his master’s anti-French stance. Ross points out that despite his antipathy toward England, Chastellain paints a surprising mixed portrait of France’s major adversary, Henry V (1414–1422), depicting him as a talented political and military leader. The nal essay in the collection, “Mental Incapacity and the Financing of War in Medieval England” by Wendy Turner, explores connections between the treatment of madness and the nancing of war in medieval England. Having surveyed how the horrors of combat and captivity could unhinge the minds of men who had experienced them, Turner then shows how the crown benetted nancially from a system that afforded it considerable control over the mentally incompetent and how, in turn, this freed up funds for the war effort.\n\nxxx\n\nDirect domain of the King of France\n\nmaps\n\nFiefs of the French Crown\n\nMap 1: France in 1328.\n\nFiefs of the English King\n\nmaps\n\nxxxi\n\nMap 2: French Territory Ceded to England after the Treaty of Brétigny 1360.\n\nxxxii\n\nmaps\n\nMap 3: England and France in the later Hundred Years War.\n\nPART ONE\n\nBROADER HORIZONS OF THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR\n\nTHE HUNDRED YEARS WARS: NOT ONE BUT MANY Kelly DeVries Loyola College\n\nWhen the English King Edward III (1327–1377) launched his major invasions of France in 1339 and again in 1340, it was ostensibly to recover his crown as king of France, a crown which had been legalistically “stolen” from him in 1328 when, despite being the closest heir to the dead king, Charles IV (1322–1328), he was declared ineligible to receive it because this royal descent was gained through a woman. The throne instead was given to a cousin, Philip of Valois, who was then crowned as King Philip VI of France (1328–1350). This action is recognized by most historians as the rst blow struck in what would become known as “The Hundred Years War.” The initial military action taken by Edward would lead in 1339 to a geographically-extensive, but ultimately-impotent campaign fought across the northern French counties of Cambrai, Vermandois, and Thiérarche. There followed in 1340 a major English naval victory at Sluys, counterbalanced by the unsuccessful siege of Tournai. The idea that two nations could ght a war lasting more than a century, as France and England did in the last two centuries of the Middle Ages, seems to most modern military historians to be the very denition of the words “medieval warfare.” And yet, in dening the Hundred Years War in this manner, these same historians have misconstrued the conict by narrow-mindedly focusing upon the ghting between those two kingdoms. They have all too often ignored or at least downplayed as an integral part of the conict the fact that each of these major combatants was also conducting military activity against third parties and that these parties engaged in conict between themselves without direct French or English involvement. In fact, the Hundred Years War was not fought only during the period 1337–1453, the most commonly given dates, nor was it fought only by England and France. Its origins can be traced at least to the late-thirteenth century with the establishment of the “Auld Alliance” between Scotland and France (1295–1296) followed by William\n\n4\n\nkelly devries\n\nWallace’s rebellion of 1297–1298. Its roots also extend back to the earlyfourteenth century revolt of the townspeople of the county of Flanders (1302) against their French overlords. Nor is the date usually given for its conclusion—1453—all that precise. Some of the issues involved in the Hundred Years War were not solved until 1477, when Charles the Bold (1467–1477), last Valois duke of Burgundy, died on the eld of Nancy, thus ending the Swiss-Burgundian-German-Lorraine Wars; or even 1485, when the defeat and death of King Richard III of England (1483–1485) at the battle of Bosworth Field, terminated the Wars of Roses (1455–1485). Most importantly, other conicts were fought along the way which directly involved not only France and England but also the Low Countries, Burgundy, Switzerland, the Holy Roman Empire, the various Spanish Kingdoms, Portugal, and Scotland.1 As with most historical periodizations, the concept of a Hundred Years War is a relatively modern one, constructed by relatively modern historians. The earliest reference to the term as used to dene warfare in Western Europe during the fourteenth and fteenth centuries does not enter the literature until 1823. It appeared rst in France and was later accepted in England.2 The actual dating of the conict to 1337–1453–a period that obviously exceeds a hundred years—would not appear until even later. At any rate, it is an odd selection of dates, since the French and English had long been at war and had already fought one another several times during the fourteenth century.3 Nor would 1453 put an end to Anglo-French ghting. Edward IV\n\n1\n\nSome might even suggest that the conict lasted into the Italian Wars begun in 1494. While the condence given to the French by their victories in the fourteenth and fteenth centuries certainly encouraged the Italian campaign of Charles VIII (1483–1498), I can nd no direct link historically between what I call the Hundred Years Wars and his punitive march against Naples. If someone can make that link, however, I would welcome it as it would further validate my thesis. 2 Anne Curry, The Hundred Years War (Houndmills, 2003), 5–27, contains perhaps the most complete historiography on the struggle. 3 Curry, Hundred Years War, 1. The rationale for using 1337 as the beginning of the war, despite having no actual ghting between the two sides, lies in the fact that in that year the French king, Philip VI, “ofcially” conscated Edward III’s lands in France. These lands were primarily Gascony and Ponthieu, as Normandy, Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and Poitou had been surrendered to the French king, Louis IX (1226–1270), by the English king, Henry III (1216–1272), in the treaty of Paris in 1259. The lands lost in 1259 would become an issue for the English during the Hundred Years War, but the conscation of Gascony and Ponthieu was never completed by Philip VI due to Edward’s willingness to ght over the issue.\n\nthe hundred years wars\n\n5\n\n(1461–1483) launched a campaign into France in 14754 and Henry VIII (1509–1547) did the same in 1512–1513.5 Calais, a city captured in 1347 as one of the earliest English victories, in fact did not return to French possession until 1553.6 But then, as we have noted, the “Hundred Years War” is a modern construct. No contemporary writer saw anything special in the dates modern historians use to bracket this conict. The rst combat recorded by Jean Froissart, regarded by many as “the historian of the Hundred Years War,” is not between England and France but between England and Scotland.7 This is followed by an account of the ghting between France and Flanders, when the Flemish revolted against French rule, ghting that was ended by the battle of Cassel in 1328. Then Froissart’s chronicle swings back to warfare between England and Scotland. Although the chronicler discusses Philip VI’s inheritance of the French throne—an inheritance he believed should have gone to Edward III as nephew of the deceased Charles IV—he clearly interprets the other\n\n4 See J. R. Lander, “The Hundred Years War and Edward IV’s 1475 Campaign in France,” in Tudor Men and Institutions: Studies in English Law and Government, ed. A. J. Slavin (Baton Rouge, La., 1972), 70–100. 5 See C. G. Cruickshank’s two studies: Army Royal: Henry VIII’s Invasion of France, 1513 (Oxford, 1969) and The English Occupation of Tournai, 1513–1519 (Oxford, 1971). 6 Two older studies may still be the best on the English occupation of Calais: Georges Daumet, Calais sous la domination Anglaise (Arras, 1902) and F. Lennel, Calais sous la domination Anglaise, vol. 2 of Histoire de Calais, 2 vols (Calais, 1908–1910). 7 There were two Froissart editing projects undertaken in the middle of the nineteenth century. The rst, by Baron Joseph-Marie-Bruno-Constantin Kervyn de Lettenhove was published in its entirety and with many signicant added texts to provide context for the chronicle of Froissart. Oeuvres de Froissart, ed. Kervyn de Lettenhove, 29 vols. (Brussels, 1867–1877). The second was begun by Siméon Luce under the patronage of the Société de l’Histoire de France, but was incomplete at his death. Volumes continued to be appear over the next century—fteen in total—but to date the edition has not been completed. Chroniques, ed. Siméon Luce et al., 15 vols., Société de l’Histoire de France (Paris, 1869–1975). Recent editions have been made by George T. Diller, drawn from single manuscripts. Chroniques: Dernière rédaction du premier livre. Edition du manuscrit de Rome Reg. lat. 869, ed. George T. Diller (Geneva, 1972) and Chroniques: Livre I. Le manuscrit d’Amiens. Bibliothèque municipale n-A 486, ed. George T. Diller, 5 vols. (Geneva, 1991–1998). There are also compilations of several manuscripts by Diller, Peter F. Ainsworth, and Alberto Varvaro: Chroniques: Livres I et II, ed. Peter F. Ainsworth and George T. Diller (Paris, 2001) and Chroniques: Livres III et IV, ed. Peter F. Ainsworth and Alberto Varvaro (Paris, 2004). Almost all the English translations of Froissart are abridged to highlight English warfare, and in particularly the Anglo-French conict. Consequently, they do not provide an accurate view of Froissart’s historical scope. Take, for example, the most accessible of these translations, made by Geoffrey Brereton, Chronicles (Harmondsworth, 1968).\n\n6\n\nkelly devries\n\nconicts he has mentioned as a signicant and inter-related part of the history of warfare in Western Europe during the fourteenth century. Jean Froissart was born in Valenciennes, in the southern Low Countries, so perhaps it was natural for him to take an interest in military affairs of regions other than England and France, especially after his return to the European continent following the deaths of his patron, the queen of England, Philippa of Hainaut, in 1369 and her husband, Edward III, in 1377. Froissart ends his chronicle in 1400 at a time of peace between France and England. At this point in his narrative, as well as in his life, he is far more concerned with other events of the period than any future Anglo-French warfare: the deposition of Richard II (1377–1399) by Henry IV (1399–1413) in 1399 and the Flemish rebellion of Flanders against France in 1379–1385. The chronicle could not have predicted the turn events would take when Henry V of England (1413–1422) would renew the conict by launching a new and successful invasion of France. After all, the last English campaign against the French reported by Froissart had been that of the bishop of Norwich, who, in 1383, under the guise of a “Crusade” against the followers of the Avignon pope, Clement VII (1378–1394), had led his army on a libustering expedition through Flanders, where he fought mainly against Flemings, who supported the same pope that he did, the Roman pontiff, Urban VI (1378–1389). This unfortunate military adventure ended with the bishop’s ignoble defeat at the siege of Ypres.8 (Interestingly, Froissart’s derisive tone in reporting this action is echoed by modern historians describing the same event).9 For all intents and purposes, it appeared that England’s effort on the continent had collapsed and probably ended ignominiously. An angry English government, stung by humiliation, put Norwich and most of the military leaders of the campaign on trial for their failure. The fact that chronicles of the period saw no special signicance in the dates modern historians use to bracket the conict is also illustrated by another major example: Jehan (or Jean) de Waurin. Like Froissart,\n\n8 Froissart, Chroniques, ed. Luce, IX:95–137, contains the account of the bishop of Norwich’s Crusade. 9 The most complete modern account of Henry Despenser’s campaign in 1383 is George M. Wrong, The Crusade of 1383 Known as That of the Bishop of Norwich (London, 1892). But, see also Norman Housley, “The Bishop of Norwich’s Crusade, May 1383,” History Today 33 (1983): 15–20, and Kelly DeVries, “The Reasons for the Bishop of Norwich’s Attack on Flanders in 1383,” in Fourteenth Century England III, ed. W. M. Ormrod (Woodbridge, Suffolk, 2004), 155–65.\n\nthe hundred years wars\n\n7\n\nWaurin, is always associated with the Hundred Years War, as indeed he should be. After all, he was born in Artois near the end of the fourteenth century, fought in the battles of Agincourt (1415) and Verneuil (1424), and was an ofcial of the court of Philip the Good (1419–1467) in Burgundy, serving as ambassador to various places, including Rome. His chronicle, assigned the title Récueil des croniques et anchiennes istories de la Grant Bretaigne by its nineteenth-century editors, William and Edward Hardy, is one of the most widely used sources for Anglo-French warfare from 1399 to 1453.10 But a large part of Waurin’s narrative discusses the history, especially of military events, that took place from 1453 to 1471, when the work ends. (Its author is thought to have died sometime around 1474). In chronicling this later period, he writes extensively on the War of the Public Weal, fought primarily between the French king, Louis XI (1461–1483) and Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy; the Liégeois Revolt against Burgundy; the Wars of the Roses; and, even farther aeld, the Ottoman advances in the eastern Mediterranean. Indeed, in his accounts of the year 1453, Waurin shows as much if not more interest in the siege and fall of Constantinople as he does in the battle of Castillon and the fall of Bordeaux.11 The treatment of the fourteenth and fteenth centuries by these two major chroniclers should suggest to modern historians a new paradigm for considering the Hundred Years War. Instead of simply viewing it in its traditional Anglo-French context, the conict should be seen as a larger (and longer) series of interrelated wars throughout Western Europe during the last two centuries of the Middle Ages. This larger struggle helped set the stage—politically, economically, and, of course, militarily—for much that would follow: the rise of the centralized early modern state, the growth of Spanish and Holy Roman Imperial power, the Italian wars, the exploration and exploitation of the Americas, and the emergence of the “Swiss way of war.” Viewing events in this manner also helps explain the homogeneity of late medieval/early\n\n10\n\nJehan de Waurin, Récueil des croniques et anchiennes istories de la Grant Bretaigne, ed. W. and E. L. C. P. Hardy, 5 vols., Rolls Series (London, 1864–1991). Despite its age, this edition has not been updated. The Hardys also attempted a translation of the chronicle from medieval French to English—also for the Rolls Series—but only completed the rst three volumes (London, 1864–1891). This, like the translations of Froissart, often leads to a focus on the ghting between England and France, again skewing the author’s own interests and biases. 11 Ibid., V:244–51 (battle of Castillon and fall of Bordeaux); V:251–61 (fall of Constantinople).\n\n8\n\nkelly devries\n\nmodern military strategy, tactics, and technology—a broad based phenomenon that some historians have erroneously named the “Military Revolution.” But that goes beyond the scope of this article. Here, we shall simply outline how other European lands—Scotland, the Holy Roman Empire, the Iberian kingdoms, the various Low Countries, and Burgundy—affected and were affected by the so-called Hundred Years War, before, during, and after the traditional chronology. To accomplish this, the article will rst list the events occurring in these many lands that inuenced the French and English struggle and then discuss briey how this inuence was felt.\n\nScotland 12 1295–1296 The Auld Alliance between France and Scotland is established, rst in Paris in 1295 and then the following year in Dumfermline.13 1297–98 William Wallace leads the Scottish armies against England in the First War of Independence, winning at the battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297, but losing at the battle of Falkirk in 1298.14 1300 Edward I (1272–1307) captures Caverlock Castle in southwest Scotland. 1301 The English king launches his campaigns in Scotland, his sixth campaign against the Scots. 1303 He conducts his seventh campaign into that kingdom. 1304 The Scots submit to Edward I at St. Andrews.\n\n12 Ranald Nicholson’s Scotland: The Later Middle Ages (New York, 1974) is an excellent study of this period of Scottish history, and because of Nicholson’s own interests—as seen in Edward III and the Scots: The Formative Years of a Military Career, 1327–1335 (Oxford, 1965)–his treatment of the Scottish War of Independence, as it is now known, is detailed and complete. However, even Nicholson does not follow Scottish soldiers ghting in France.

My favorite is Chris Brown, William Wallace: The True Story of Braveheart (Stroud, 2005). The best study of the two battles of Wallace is Pete Armstrong, Stirling Bridge and Falkirk, 1297–98: William Wallace’s Rebellion (London, 2003). For a more general history of the period see Fiona Watson, Under the Hammer: Edward I and Scotland, 1286–1307 (East Linton, 1998), which should be consulted not only for Edward’s conict with Wallace but for all of the Anglo-Scottish wars to 1307.

Such raids will continue throughout Bruce’s life. (He will die in 1329). 1311 Edward II fails miserably in his campaign against Scotland. 1313 The Scottish army drives English forces out of Perth and begins the siege of Carlisle. 1314 Edward Bruce, Robert’s brother, besieges Stirling Castle, provoking Edward II to ght and lose the battle of Bannockburn.18 As a result of this loss, the English are driven from Scotland. 1315 Edward Bruce campaigns in Ireland, defeating an Anglo-Norman army at the battle of Connor.19 1317 Edward Bruce is defeated in several engagements in Ireland, forcing his brother, the king, to travel there.\n\n15 The standard biography of Robert Bruce is G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland (London, 1965) which has recently been released in a fourth edition (Edinburgh, 2006). Quite good also, and better on Bruce’s military career in my opinion, is Chris Brown, Robert Bruce: A Life Chronicled (Stroud, 2004). Colm McNamee, The Wars of the Bruces: Scotland, England, and Ireland, 1306–1328 (East Linton, 1997) specically focuses on the military history between Scotland and England during the Bruce’s generalship, as does the slightly older A. A. M. Duncan, “The War of the Scots, 1306–23,” Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 6th ser., 2 (1992): 125–51. 16 On the battle of Loudon Hill see Kelly DeVries, Infantry Warfare in the Early Fourteenth Century: Discipline, Tactics, and Technology (Woodbridge, Suffolk, 1996), 49–57. 17 A good general history of Edward II’s military problems remains Michael Prestwich, The Three Edwards: War and State in England, 1272–1377 (London, 1981). 18 More may be written about Bannockburn than perhaps any battle in history. W. M. Mackenzie’s The Battle of Bannockburn: A Study in Mediaeval Warfare (Glasgow, 1913) and John E. Morris’ Bannockburn (Cambridge, 1914) are the places to start any study of the battle—especially as they disagree quite a bit. Of the numerous more recent works my favorite is Pete Armstrong, Bannockburn 1314: Robert Bruce’s Great Victory (London, 2002), although much may change if the battleeld is ever correctly identied by archaeology. For a concise account of the battle, see DeVries, Infantry Warfare, 66–85. 19 Séan Duffy’s Robert the Bruce’s Irish Wars: The Invasions of Ireland, 1306–1329 (Stroud, 2002) covers the subject nicely.\n\n10\n\nkelly devries\n\n1319 Edward II besieges Berwick-upon-Tweed, but raises the siege after the Scottish general, Sir James Douglas, defeats an English army raised by Archbishop Melton of York at the battle of Myton. 1320 In a letter (later known as the declaration of Arbroath) written to Pope John XXII (1316–1334) at Avignon, Robert Bruce and fty-one other nobles and magnates declare Scotland to be an independent and sovereign state. The pope does not ratify the declaration, but neither does he condemn it.20 1322 Another of Edward II’s campaigns into Scotland fails. Robert Bruce’s raids into Yorkshire are much more successful, including his defeat of an English army led by the earl of Richmond. 1323 Edward II executes Andrew of Harclay, earl of Carlisle, for negotiating a treaty with Robert Bruce, but later that year arrives at a truce with the Scottish king.21 1327 Edward II is deposed by his wife, Isabelle, and her lover, Roger Mortimer, who become regents for his son, the newly-crowned king, Edward III. Mortimer’s army is crushed by Robert Bruce in the Weardale campaign.22 1328 Following the deposition of his father, Edward III signs the treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton which recognizes Robert Bruce as king of a sovereign Scotland. This is done so that Edward might pursue his inheritance claims as king of France.23 1329 Robert Bruce dies and is succeeded as king by his son, David II Bruce (1329–1371).24 1332 At the battle of Dupplin Moor,25 Edward Balliol, leading an army of “disinherited” Scottish nobles, defeats a Scottish army led by the earl of Mar, guardian of Scotland and regent for David II. Balliol declares himself king but is soon defeated by the earl of Moray, John Randolph, at the battle of Annan. He is then forced to ee to England.\n\n20 See Edward J.

Berwick falls the next day.26 1334 For his own safety, David II travels to France. Edward Balliol is recrowned king, recognizing Edward III as his overlord and ceding to him Berwick and eight shires of southern Scotland. A Scottish rebellion ultimately forces him to again ee to England. 1335 Edward III campaigns in Scotland, placing Edward Balliol back on the throne. Once again Balliol’s kingship fails. 1336 Edward III returns yet again to Scotland and campaigns in the Highlands. Edward Balliol is put back on the throne. Edward III uses the Scottish-French alliance as a means of raising taxes for war against France. 1339 While Edward III is campaigning in northern France, the Scots again force Edward Balliol to ee to England. 1341 David II returns to Scotland from France; his supporters force all remaining English from Edinburgh. 1342 Edward III campaigns unsuccessfully in southern Scotland. The Scots recapture Roxburgh Castle and drive the English out of the kingdom. 1346 While Edward III besieges Calais, David II invades England where he is defeated, wounded, and captured at the battle of Neville’s Cross by the forces of Henry Percy, Ralph Neville, and William la Zouche, Archbishop of York.27 For the next eleven years David is imprisoned in England.28 1355 The Scots recapture Berwick. 1356 Edward III again takes Berwick, and Edward Balliol, still titularly the king of Scotland, abdicates his throne to the English sovereign. 1371 David II dies without a direct heir. As a result, his nephew, Robert II, “the Steward,” (1371–1390) is made king. 1384 A Scottish army besieges and destroys Lochmaben Castle, then begins raiding Cumberland.29 1385 The Scots, supported nancially by France, raid Northumberland.

During his captivity, many Scottish nobles and soldiers were lured to France to ght the English there.33 1421 Scottish soldiers assist the French in gaining victory over the English at the battle of Baugé. 1424 James I returns from England after signing the treaty of Durham which establishes peace with the English.

A feud between James II and the Douglas family begins with the execution of William, earl of Douglas. The feud, which essentially creates a Scottish civil war, continues through James II’s reign and into that of James III (1460–1488). Scotland attempts to wage war against England. James II murders William, earl of Douglas, at Stirling Castle. James II captures Roxburgh Castle, but is killed during his inspection of his artillery when a cannon accidently explodes. He is succeeded by his son, James III, who is still a child. Henry VI (1422–1461) is forced to ee to Scotland after his defeat at the battle of Towton by his cousin, Edward IV. Out of gratitude for Scottish support, Henry cedes Berwick to Scotland. After being tried as a traitor, Robert, lord Boyd, who had been one of the regents of James III, ees to England. His brother, Alexander, is executed for treason.\n\nThe Anglo-Scottish chronology makes clear several ways in which Scotland both inuenced and entered into the Hundred Years War. The rst has been observed by some historians: that by their military activity on the northern borders of England, the Scots kept Edward III from embarking on the conict before 1337. As early as 1328, the citizens of Bruges tried to offer the English king their allegiance if he would assist them in their rebellion against the French. Initially, he promised to do so, but was then forced to renege, much to the rebels’ detriment as they could not militarily sustain their revolt without England’s aid after suffering defeat at the battle of Cassel (1328). Clifford J. Rogers makes a good point about Edward’s growing condence in his own tactical abilities after the battle of Halidon Hill in 1333.37 On the other hand, the fact that it took the English king another half-dozen years to actually make it to the continent suggests that he was still not 35\n\nKelly DeVries, Joan of Arc: A Military Leader (Stroud, 1999), 65–68. The Anglo-Scottish Warfare of the fteenth century is very poorly researched. About the only good secondary source is Nicholson’s Scotland: The Later Middle Ages. 37 This point is made by Rogers in both “Edward III and the Dialectics of Strategy, 1327–1360,” Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 6th ser., 4 (1994): 83–102 and War Cruel and Sharp: English Strategy under Edward III, 1327–1360 (Woodbridge, 2000). 36\n\n14\n\nkelly devries\n\ncondent enough strategically to leave his border open to yet another potential Scottish attack. The Anglo-Scottish chronology raises another issue here that has been somewhat ignored by Hundred Years War historians who are so tightly stuck on a 1337–1453 chronology. The nancial resources that were needed for Edward to ght a war in France were signicant; in fact, his failure to receive sufcient funds from Parliament is given by Rogers and Jonathan Sumption as the reason for the English failure to capture Tournai in 1340.38 Yet the fact that these funds had been drained off consistently since the very beginning of the Scottish War of Independence in 1297 has been largely forgotten. What were the further nancial repercussions of continued threats to England by the Scots throughout the fourteenth century? And how did the need to respond to these threats militarily impinge on the English war effort in France? In fact, at various times during the period, the Scots received French funding. On the other hand, England relied only on what its own economy could provide. Although both the wool trade with Flanders remained fairly constant throughout Edward’s reign, the Flemish rebellions of 1337–1345 and 1379–1385 and the Brabantese War of Succession of 1355–1357 did disrupt that trade to some extent, no doubt affecting English nancing of the war. (The extent of such disruption has yet to be explored by historians.) Another obvious connection between Scotland and the Hundred Years War has received even less commentary by military historians. The Scottish threat to northern England had virtually disappeared by Henry V’s reign, which may have had something to do with that king’s interest in renewing an English military effort in France. Instead, Scottish warriors appear to have shifted their ght against the English to France. Chroniclers note the Scottish presence at such battles as Baugé (1421), Verneuil (1424), and the Herrings (1429), as well as in the army that served with Joan of Arc at Orléans and along the Loire River. This interesting shift in military theaters may have had something to do with\n\n38 Rogers, War Cruel and Sharp, 199–216 and Jonathan Sumption, The Hundred Years War: Trial by Battle (Philadelphia, 1991), 338–70. Neither details what forms of nancing there were, why such nancing was solely in the hands of Parliament, why Edward had not arranged his nancing more completely before he left England, why England was paying for the siege alone when Flemish, Brabantese, Hainauter, and German allied forces were also involved, probably in greater numbers than the English, and, nally, why if his war nancing was such a hardship in 1340, it was well in hand by 1341 when Edward was prepared to make yet another assault on the continent.\n\nthe hundred years wars\n\n15\n\nthe instability of the Scottish throne. On the other hand, the presence in France of so many Scottish leaders whose families had fought against England over the decades may simply signify a desire on their part to take their ght to the English, wherever possible.\n\nHoly Roman Empire 39 1337 1338 1340 1341 1346 1378 1416 1473\n\n1474\n\n39\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Ludwig IV of Bavaria (1314–1347) (of the House of Wittelsbach) makes an alliance with Edward III.40 Ludwig names Edward III as imperial vicar west of the Rhine River. The Holy Roman Emperor sends troops to participate on Edward’s side at the siege of Tournai. Ludwig abandons his English alliance and allies himself with Philip VI. Charles IV (of the House of Luxemburg) (1347–1378) is elected king of Germany by barons opposed to Ludwig IV’s rule.41 Nine years later, he will be declared Holy Roman Emperor. Charles IV signs a peace treaty with Charles V of France (1364–1380) in Paris. To seal the friendship, he names the dauphin, later Charles VI (1380–1422), imperial vicar over the kingdom of Arles. Emperor Sigismund (1410–1437) travels to Paris in a vain attempt to make peace between England and France.42 Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, meets with Emperor Frederick III (of the House of Habsburg) (1440–1493) at Trier in an effort to be crowned “king of Burgundy.”43 Frederick refuses to accommodate the Burgundian duke. With the support of King Louis XI of France, the Swiss Confederation achieves its independence from Austria. The confederation forms the Union of Constance with Strasbourg, Schlestadt, Colmar, Basel, and\n\nThis is an area of historical neglect that is badly in need of a scholarly study. There is only one study of any signicance here—and it is very dated—despite its importance to the early stages of the Hundred Years War: H. S. Ofer, “England and Germany at the Beginning of the Hundred Years’ War,” EHR 54 (1939): 608–31. 41 John the Blind’s bravery at Crécy is still memorialized on the battleeld by a monument, parts of which are centuries old. For a brief and very nationalistic biography of John, see Walther Rose, “König Johann der Blinde von Böhmen und die Schlacht bei Crécy (1346),” Zeitschrift für historisches Waffenkunde 7 (1915–17): 37–60. Sadly none of the biographies of Charles IV detail his interactions with the French or the English during the Hundred Years War. 42 Unfortunately Sigismund’s biographies also do not discuss his activity with France or England during the Hundred Years War. 43 The sources for Charles the Bold’s life will be indicated below. 40\n\n16\n\nkelly devries\n\nAustria as a defensive pact against Charles the Bold, who initiates the siege of Neuss.44 1475 The armies of Frederick III, the Union of Constance, and other German entities raise the siege. 1476 The Swiss defeat the Burgundians at the battles of Grandson and Murten.45 1477 The Swiss defeat the Burgundians at Nancy and there Charles the Bold is killed.\n\nWhile the connection of the Holy Roman Empire to the Hundred Years War is less noteworthy than that of Scotland, there are several things that do stand out. Most notably, there is the active participation of Holy Roman Emperor, Ludwig IV, at the outset of the conict, although little scholarly emphasis has been placed on this outside of H.S. Ofer’s article.46 Nor has the failure of Ludwig’s alliance with Edward III received much attention, despite the loss by the English king of what could have been an invaluable and wealthy ally, and despite the fact that this failure seems to have been one of the principal justications used by German barons for overthrowing Ludwig. The fact that the Germans replaced Ludwig with Charles IV (1347–1378), whose father, John the Blind, duke of Luxemburg and king of Bohemia (1310–1346), had lost his life so famously ghting on the French side against Edward at the battle of Crécy (1346) suggests German interest in what was happening in the Hundred Years War. The fact that the imperial chronology produced in this article has only a few entries primarily reects the limited research that has to date been devoted to this aspect of the conict, a clear call for more work in the future.\n\n44 The most complete discussion of the siege of Neuss are found in the articles in Neuss, Burgund und das Reich (Neuss, 1975), especially Joseph Lange’s “Pulchra Nussia: Die Belagerung der Stadt Neuss, 1474/75,” 9–190.

The English defeat a Franco-Castilian eet off the coast of Kinsale, Ireland. By marrying Beatrice of Portugal, Juan I forges an alliance with her father, King Fernando, causing the English to evacuate the kingdom. Fernando dies and the Castilian king claims the throne of Portugal through his wife. However, this is not accepted by the Portuguese and Juan is forced to march his army into Portugal.57 The Portuguese defeat Juan at the battle of Atoleiros. The Castilian king begins a siege of Lisbon but has to raise it within a few weeks after plague decimates his besieging troops. João I (1385–1433), the illegitimate son of Pedro I of Portugal (1357– 1367) and Grand-Master of the Order of Aviz, is crowned the king by the Portuguese cortes. He is supported by John of Gaunt who sends English longbowmen to ght with the Portuguese in their stunning defeat of the Castilians at the battle of Aljubarrota.58 The treaty of Windsor is signed between England and Portugal, culminating in the wedding of Philippa of Lancaster, John of Gaunt’s daughter, to João the following year. John of Gaunt uses the occasion to launch an attack on Castile.\n\nJames Sherborne, “The Battle of La Rochelle and the War at Sea, 1372–5,” Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research 42 (1969): 17–29; José María Blanco Nuñez, “Las armadas de Castilla y Aragón durante la Guerra de los Cien Años,” in XXII Kongreß der Internationalen Kommission für Militärgeschichte Acta 22: Von Crécy bis Mohács Kriegswesen im späten Mittelalter (1346–1526) (Vienna, 1997), 269–80. 56 C.

Enrique III (1390–1406), who in 1388 had married Katherine of Lancaster, John of Gaunt’s daughter, succeeds his father, Juan, as king of Castile. The death of Marti (Martin) I, king of Aragon (1395–1410), without direct heirs initiates a two-year interregnum. Ferran (Fernando) I “the Just” (1412–1416), a member of the Castilian ruling house of Trastámara, is crowned king of Aragon in 1412. Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, defeats a Castilian eet in the English Channel. Although Joan II, king of Aragon and Navarre, (1458–1479) and Louis XI of France cooperate in suppressing a Catalan revolt in Perpignan, once it is settled they ght against each other over possession of the region.59 The Aragonese-French war ends when Louis captures Perpignan, Roussillon, and Cerdagne.\n\nWhile German and Scottish troops actually served in the Low Countries and France during the Hundred Years War, it was primarily the other way round in the case of Iberia. Here, French, English, and Bretons brought the Hundred Years War into the Peninsula through their massive intervention. On opposite sides of the intervention stood two of the conict’s dominant gures: Bertrand DuGuesclin led the Franco-Bretons supporting the usurper, Enrique II, while Edward, the Black Prince, commanded the army that restored Pedro I to the throne. Apparently, it was during his 1367 campaign in northern Spain fought on behalf of Pedro, that the prince contracted the illness that eventually killed him. This would put his young son, Richard II, on the throne of England in his stead, leading to what many historians regard as the principal reason for the English military setbacks at the end of the fourteenth century. Of equal interest to French historians has been the participation on the other side—that supporting Enrique de Trastámara—of the future constable of France, Du Guesclin, the man whom many historians see as the architect of French victory at the next stage of the Hundred Years War (1369–1380). Although the Black Prince achieved a crushing victory at the battle of Nájera (1367), as in many other English battleeld successes this did not lead to victory in the larger conict. In reality, the victory at Nájera decided 59 The standard work remains Joseph Calmette, Louis XI, Jean II et la révolution catalane (Toulouse, 1903).\n\nthe hundred years wars\n\n21\n\nnothing. Within months, the Black Prince, estranged from his ally, Pedro I, evacuated the peninsula. At the same time, Enrique returned from France at the head of a rebuilt army and eighteen months later won at Montiel (1369) what would turn out to be the decisive battle of the civil war. Here, he captured and executed Pedro I, thereby securing his place on the Castilian throne. No historian suggests that John of Gaunt was anywhere near as great a military leader as his elder brother, the Black Prince. However, his assistance to the Portuguese against the Castilians during the 1380s is almost always viewed as a military victory. For their part, Portuguese historians have suggested that their English counterparts overstate the role of the longbow at the battle of Aljubarrota in 1385. Whatever the case, there can be no doubt that this period of Iberian conict and its inuence on the Hundred Years War requires much more investigation than has been undertaken to date. English historians sidestep, if not completely ignore, the fact that John of Gaunt’s success in Iberia may have less to do with his military skills than his ability to produce marriageable daughters, two of whom—Philippa and Katherine—became spouses of peninsular monarchs. Outside of Nájera and Aljubarrota, the role of the Navarrese in that conict remains largely unexplored. Neither Joanna II nor her son, Charles “the Bad,” has received an adequate biography—Plaisse’s treatment of Charles notwithstanding.60 Hence, the fascinating gures have not received the historical attention they deserve, despite their connections to almost everything that happened in France during the lead-up to and the rst few decades of the Hundred Years War. Finally, what were all those Castilian ships doing ghting against the English eet during these centuries? Can we call this naval warfare on a state level or was it simply piracy on a more private level?\n\n60 I nd Plaisse’s biography, Charles dit le Mauvais (cited above) to be fraught with more popular than scholarly writing, although it is certainly the place where a good scholarly biographer needs to start his study.\n\n22\n\nkelly devries The Low Countries 61\n\n1302 1304 1312 1314 1315 1320\n\nThe county of Flanders, led by the town of Bruges, rebels against France. The Flemish victory at the battle of Courtrai prompts Pope Boniface VIII (1296–1303) to issue the bull Unam sanctam.62 The French victory at the battle of Mons-en-Pévèle essentially ends the Flemish rebellion.63 Robert of Béthune, count of Flanders, reluctantly concedes the castellanies of Lille, Douai, and Béthune to King Philip IV “the Fair” of France (1285–1314) as part of the treaty of Athis-sur-Orge. Philip IV campaigns briey in Flanders; although initially quite successful, he suspends his campaign when threatened by a tax revolt from towns in France. Louis X, who had succeeded to the throne of France in 1314, fails to conquer anything during his Flemish campaign. Robert of Béthune failed in his attempt to win back Lille in 1319 and this forces his submission to Philip V (1316–1322) in Paris.\n\n61 An excellent work on the Low Countries during the fourteenth and fteenth centuries is Wim Blockmans and Walter Prevenier, The Promised Lands: The Low Countries Under Burgundian Rule, 1369–1530, ed. Edward Peters, trans. Elizabeth Fackelman (Philadelphia, 1999). Before this period about the only solid book is F. Quicke, Les Pays-Bas à la veille de la periode Bourguignonne, 1356–1384: Contribution à l’histoire politique et diplomatique de l’Europe occidentale dans la seconde moitié du XIV e siècle (Brussels, 1947). As with many other subjects in this article, there is a need for a history of the Low Countries’ urban revolts during the fourteenth and fteenth centuries. For an introduction, see Kelly DeVries, “The Rebellions of the Southern Low Countries’ Towns during the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries,” in Power and the City in the Netherlandic World, ed. Wayne Te Brake and Wim Kibler (Leiden, 2006), 27–44 and Jan Dumolyn and Jelle Haemers, “Patterns of Urban Rebellion in Medieval Flanders,” Journal of Medieval History 31 (2005): 369–93. 62 There are numerous studies on the battle of Courtrai, especially with the recent seven-hundredth anniversary of the battle. The best is still J. F. Verbruggen, The Battle of the Golden Spurs: Courtrai, 11 July 1302, ed. Kelly DeVries, trans. David Richard Ferguson (Woodbridge, 2002). However, scholars should also consult Philippe Despriet, Kortrijk 1302: Keerpunt in de Frans-Vlaamse oorlog, 1297–1305 (Courtrai, 2002); J. F. Verbruggen and Rolf Falt, 1302 opstand in Vlaanderen (Tielt, 2002); and the articles in Omtrent 1302, ed. Paul Trio, Dirk Heirbaut, and Dirk van den Auweele (Leuven, 2002). A concise account is in DeVries, Infantry Warfare, 9–22. Frantz Funck-Brentano, Philippe le Bel et Flandre: Les origines de la guerre de cent ans (Paris, 1896) certainly saw the connection between these events and the Hundred Years War, but few have followed his lead. 63 J. F. Verbruggen, Vlaanderen na de Guldensporenslag (Bruges, 1991) is one of the very few works on the Flemish rebellion after the battle of Courtrai. It is badly in need of translation. On the battles of Arques (1303) and Mons-en-Pévèle (1304) see DeVries, Infantry Warfare, 23–48. And on the Treaty of Athis-sur-Orge see Randall Lesaffer, “Cedant arma togae. De vrede van Athis-sur-Orge (1305),” in Omtrent 1302, ed.

When the count of Flanders, Louis I of Nevers (1322–1346), refuses to join the others, an action that results in a wool embargo, Jacob van Artevelde leads an uprising of Ghentenaars which causes the count to ee to France.67 Edward III travels to Antwerp and meets with Low Countries’ leaders. In Ghent, Edward III proclaims himself king of France. He later returns to Flanders, winning the naval battle of Sluys, but fails in his efforts to besiege Tournai and returns to England.68 Jacob van Artevelde is killed in Ghent by a dissatised faction of townspeople. Liégeois burghers defeat their newly-appointed prince-bishop, Englebert de la Marck, at the battle of Vottem.69 He is restored to rule after granting concessions to the rebels. Named count three years earlier, Louis II of Male (1346–1384), now retakes the county of Flanders.

Sabbe, Vlaanderen in opstand, 1323–1328: Nikolaas Zannekin, Zeger Janszone en Willem de Deken (Bruges, 1992), although both are rather slight on military history. 65 A historical work on par with Russell’s, The English Intervention in Spain and Portugal in the Time of Edward III and Richard II is Henry Stephen Lucas, The Low Countries and the Hundred Years’ War, 1326–1347 (Ann Arbor, 1929), although some updating work on the period has been done by Low Countries’ scholars. 66 See DeVries, Infantry Warfare, 100–11 and the articles in Nikolaas Zannekin en de slag bij Kassel, 1328–1978: Bijdrage tot de studie van de 14de eeuw en de landelijke geschiedenis van de Westhoek (Diksmuide, 1978). 67 David Nicholas’, The Van Arteveldes of Ghent: The Varieties of Vendetta and the Hero in History (Ithaca, 1988) has become the standard history of Jacob van Artevelde, but I still like Hans Van Werveke, Jacques van Artevelde (Brussels, 1943) a"
