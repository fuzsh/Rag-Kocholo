        "text": "Background\n\nOver the last few decades, there has been a steady increase in the number and percentage of women in medicine, resulting in a more feminized profession. However, female representation in decision-making positions remains low on a global scale [1, 2].\n\nIn academic careers, women are internationally underrepresented, especially in senior positions [3–5]. Similarly, in many the medical societies across variuos specialties, gender inequity persists, not in terms of membership but in terms of recognition and appointment to leadership positions [6]. Additionally, in academic medicine, including research and teaching, women are underrepresented on an international scale. In the United States, women are less likely to be promoted to associate professor, full professor, and department chair, and this bias has persisted, with the gap widening in recent years for full professorship [7, 8]. These indicators highlight the existing gender inequity in medical professional societies. Other indicators include the underrepresentation of women in medical board membership, relevant roles in congress programs, and prominent positions in teaching and publications. Discrimination is not always explicit, there is evidence of differing language used based on gender within the context of international medical conferences. For example, women tend to introduce speakers using their professional title, regardless of gender, while men introduce female speakers with professional titles less frequently than they do male speakers [9, 10]. Female physicians continue to face numerous challenges in medicine, ranging from implicit bias to barriers in promotion, responsibility, and payment gaps. Consequently, despite an equal number of men and women graduating from medical schools, only a small fraction of female physicians ascend to medical leadership positions [11, 12].\n\nThere is gender inequity in the academic publishing system, with a systematic underrepresentation of women as authors, referees, and editors [13–16]. Gender bias in scientific publications and its causes or mechanisms has been studied in different fields. The composition of editorial committees and the pool of referees by sex could make a difference. It has also been investigated whether the editorial processes, which are a set of interlinked decisions, may have any direct or indirect effect on the lower rate of publications by women. A recent study examining gender bias in 145 peer-reviewed scientific journals surprisingly found that manuscripts written by women received systematically more positive reviews, and that manuscripts with a higher proportion of women among authors were accepted more frequently, although there are some differences between fields of research [17]. Moreover, the study found that women are systematically less involved in peer review and are rarely appointed to prestigious editorial positions. In December 2017, the Lancet group launched the #LancetWomen project, focusing on the roles of women in editing, reviewing, and authoring articles. Following its findings, some of the group’s journals have expanded their editorial boards to include more women [18].\n\nAlthough the international evidence is extensive, gender bias in medicine has not been properly studied in Spain. Local studies focused on specific medical specialties have pointed to a pronounced inequity both in healthcare practice and in academic medicine [15, 19–25]. In the 2015–2016 academic year, 65.7% of undergraduate medical students in Spain were women, and by 2020–2021, that percentage increased to 69.4% [26]. Currently, more than half of the physicians in Spain are women (around 58%), and this trend is increasing [12, 27]. This percentage is higher among medical doctors aged 35 or younger (67%), and varies among regions, ranging from 341/100,000 population in Melilla to 575 in Aragon. In 2021, over 60% of physicians working in the public network of hospitals and health centers were women, with variability related to different specialties [28]. Official figures for the number of physicians working in private practice in Spain are not yet available.\n\nTo gain further insights into the current representation of women in leadership roles and to extend our understanding of gender challenges in Spain, the Women in MEDicine in Spain (WOMEDS) project was initiated. The primary goal of this project is to systematically and comprehensively describe and characterize gender bias in the medical profession in Spain, in order to monitor its evolution over time and contribute to prioritizing gender policies. The project focuses on the clinical setting but also has implications for professional organizations, academia, and research. Four groups of indicators were established: (i) healthcare; (ii) scientific and professional bodies (medical councils, medical associations, and medical conferences); (iii) academic career (universities); and (iv) research career, concerning women physicians for each specialty.\n\nDiscussion\n\nLimited evidence exists in the literature regarding gender inequity in medicine in Spain. To address this knowledge gap, the WOMEDS project was established. Its primary objective is to provide valuable insights into gender inequity in the field of medicine in Spain and contribute to ongoing efforts to promote gender equality. To achieve this, we plan to collect annual data to monitor the evolution of gender bias in leadership positions over time. The project focuses on presenting data and defining indicators related to various areas, including medical practice, representation of women in visible and influential roles within scientific and professional organizations, academia, and research. Whenever possible, the indicators were analyzed by medical specialty and by region. The data presented in this article cover the period from 2019 to 2021 and will be openly accessible through the project’s website at: https://womeds.es.\n\nOur analysis of data from 2019 to 2021 confirms a significant gender inequity in leadership position within the medical field in Spain across all four settings examined. These findings align with previous studies that have consistently highlighted the lack of adequate representation and integration of women in top positions within the healthcare sector [2, 30]. Despite women gaining increased access to the medical profession, the disparity in leadership positions persists, underscoring the ongoing challenge of achieving gender equality in these areas.\n\nA study focused on women’s leadership positions in various healthcare professions in Spain, including nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy, medicine, dentistry, podiatry, and psychology revealed that only 16% of medical societies had a female president in 2014, compared to 77% nursing societies [21]. Among primary care societies, there was a higher proportion of women in executive positions (55%) compared to societies associated with hospital care specialties (28%). A subsequent survey conducted five years later indicated that women were most represented in secondary leadership positions such as vice-secretary (or secretary in societies without vice-secretaries), member, vice-president, and vice-dean. The percentage of women in presidency positions or deanship was only 2% and 6%, respectively [31]. These findings highlight the ongoing need to continue efforts to achieve gender equity in leadership positions in Spain. Our study did not reveal a consistent pattern of feminization across specialties within the public health system. However, it is important to acknowledge that the data were only available from seven AACCs, which represents a limitation of this indicator. One specialty, preventive medicine, showed a clear advantage for female leadership, while a few others (neurosurgery, pneumology, and clinical neurophysiology) had WRs greater than or equal to 1 in three AACCs analyzed. It is crucial to recognize that gender does not correlate with intellectual competence, but women are often viewed less favorably than men, particularly in surgical disciplines. Our findings indicated that half of the specialties with low women empowerment in the health public system were from the surgical field, which is consistent with previous reports from other countries [32, 33]. This concern begins at very early stage, as 75% of medical students aspiring to pursue surgical careers reporting receiving verbal discouragement [34]. The probability of female doctors accessing the most demanded specialties for in Spain has been negatively influenced by changes introduced in the medical residency selection process in 2010. The main change was an increase in the importance placed on the results of the resident medical intern (MIR) test score, at the expense of the weight given to medical undergraduate studies. Specifically, the weight given to the MIR exam increased from 75 to 90%, while the contribution of the grade point average decreased from 25 to 10% [35].\n\nThe considerable variation in WRs of top positions in the public healthcare system across AACCs emphasizes areas where improvements can be made. It is possible to conduct a benchmarking exercise by examining the case of Navarra, where no evidence of gender bias in top positions was found. Our research provides valuable insights by identifying AACCs demonstrating better gender equity. Regional human resources managers in other regions can learn from their success and gain insights into the factors that contribute to it. Additionally, by comparing the four settings, our study can assist in establishing priorities for action among the different government ministries and agencies responsible for implementing measures.\n\nOur study revealed a clear gender inequity in national medical congresses. Out of 36 Spanish societies that provided data from annual congresses held during the study period, only 4 medical societies had a WR greater than one for women speakers. Similarly, only 5 societies reported a WR greater than one for members in the scientific committee, indicating a significant imbalance against women. Additionally, throughout the entire period from 2019 to 2021, only 3 medical associations in Spain had a female president. These findings align with data published by international societies, such as the European Society of Medical Oncology, which also highlighted a significant underrepresentation of women as invited speakers at oncology congresses and as board members of oncology societies [36].\n\nFurthermore, we also identified a gender gap in the top leadership and institutional representation positions within provincial official colleges of physicians, academies of medicine, and universities. It is common to observe a man as president and a woman as vice-president or secretary in most medical organizations. These results are consistent with evidence from around the world [3, 8, 37–41] and within Spain [19–21, 23, 24], as documented in previous studies.\n\nThe situation in universities is worrying with a striking lack of women in leadership positions, according to other studies conducted in Spain as well as elsewhere [30, 42, 43]. The lack of women in top positions is striking, as evidenced by the fact that in 2020, only 9 out of 39 Spanish medical schools had women deans, compared to just two in 2010 [44]. These findings align with existing literature, which also highlights the presence of gender stereotypes in the highest-ranking decanal positions in US medical schools, with men primarily occupying clinical affairs and research affairs deanships, while women are more commonly found in admissions, diversity affairs, faculty affairs, and student affairs deanships [45]. Additionally, our research identified a gender gap in applications to research projects funded by the ISCIII, with fewer applications submitted by women. Moreover, women experienced lower success rates and received less average funding, which is consistent with evidence found globally [43, 46, 47]. These disparities in research funding could potentially contribute to the gender inequity observed in female first authorship manuscripts in scientific fields [13]. Based on these inequities observed in Spain, we propose the implementation of active policies of positive discrimination in calls for research projects in the medical field. This suggestion is in line with other authors who have recommended proactive efforts to promote gender equity in high-ranking work positions [48]. Recommendation for funders have also been put forward, such as describing the ideal candidate in non-gendered terms in grant proposals and reviewer guidelines, urging institutions to address possible gender inequities (e.g., salaries), and requesting recommenders to focus on an applicant’s objective research record rather than irrelevant personal circumstances [48].\n\nThanks to the #LancetWomen initiative, which called for papers addressing gender equity in science, medicine, and global health, important discussions have been initiated regarding the representation, experience, and promotion of women in these fields [49]. Various strategies have been proposed to promote gender diversity and inclusion in medicine, emphasizing the need for comprehensive interventions that address structural and systemic changes rather than focusing solely on individual attitudes and behaviors [50, 51]. These strategies include treating gender equality as an innovation challenge, changing institutional norms, fostering a culture of personal responsibility for change, implementing behavioral guidelines and action plans, and establishing organizational accountability. One key issue identified is the limited visibility of women in top leadership positions within medical organizations, which hinders the provision of role models for future generations [39]. A common pattern observed across various areas of analysis, including scientific societies, professional associations, and medical schools, is the predominance of men in visible head and institutional representative roles (e.g., president, dean), while women are often found in lower-ranking positions (e.g., vice-president, committee members). This bias is persistent and significant. An important objective of this study is to raise awareness of this problem and contribute its resolution. In fact, the completion of the questionnaires played a crucial role in making some societies and institutions aware of the gender gap for the first time.\n\nThe study has several strengths and limitations. Among its strengths, this is the first comprehensive study containing primary and recent data concerning various aspects of medical professions in Spain. This allowed us to report an exhaustive scenario of gender inequity in medicine in Spain. There are no similar studies published; most papers are focused on specific areas (for instance, women in the academy) or one specific specialty, but they did not cover all the angles (clinical practice, research, academia, and management) and different specialties at the same time.\n\nHowever, there are certain limitations to consider. The study lacks historical data, preventing the analysis of the evolution of gender inequity over time. Nevertheless, the WOMEDS project aims to continue collecting annual data to monitor the evolution of gender bias in the medical profession in Spain. Another limitation is the absence of relevant information such as age and ethnicity, which are known to play significant roles in career advancement. Additionally, the intersectionality of gender with race, ethnicity, caste, or religion further exacerbates the disadvantage experienced in different parts of the world [3]. Another potential limitation is the bias associated with the sources of information, particularly with regard to medical specialties. Furthermore, the granularity and detail of the responses varied among medical societies. Currently, the research data only cover one program, but there are plans to expand the WOMEDS project with additional indicators and new collaborators who are willing to share their own data publicly for the analysis of gender bias and its evolution over time."
