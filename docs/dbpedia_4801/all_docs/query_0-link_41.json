        "text": "Out of Africa.\n\nA.D. Ceuta F.C. are a Spanish Team playing in the Primera División RFEF Grupo I (Tier 3) this season. What sets them apart from all the other teams at that level is that they aren't actually in Europe.\n\nThey are based in Africa, on the North tip of the Moroccan coast, (just opposite Gibraltar), so whenever you hear Spain complaining about the UK owning Gibraltar, be reminded that they have at least 2 such territories on the African mainland, Cueta & Melilla, (the latter of which is further along the coast to the East)\n\nI was hoping that Cueta would produce Newgens of African Nationalities, but in my FM22 save in Portugal, (where I had the Spanish structure loaded), they rarely seemed to produce Africans, (even of 2nd Nationality), but this might be down to the fact that they are only able to scout players at their own level in Spain.\n\nI'm not sure how realistic this strategy is, but my plan is to only sign players who are of African Nationality, (or 2nd Nationality). This might prove a problem, (especially in the early stages of the save), but I will also be allowing myself to use players who come through our Academy, (even if they don't have an African Nationality).\n\nYou all know I like to challenge myself and as I'm making things easier by allowing myself to sign African players who have been produced by other clubs, I'm going to make things tougher by removing all attributes, or to be more accurate, making them invisible.\n\nThanks to @_Ben_ who showed me how to do this by the way. (Actually, I'm not 100% sure that I'm going to do this now. I was keen at the end of FM22, but in the cold light of day with FM23 loaded and ready to go, now I'm not so sure). I think a smarter move is to maybe play the game as normal to start off with, (and get used to scouting and buying players again with the new system), and then go into the invisible attributes either later in the save or in a completely new save at some point.\n\nMy main reason for doing this is because I'm interested to really see how the scouting system works because I understand that this is an area that has improved in recent issues of the game. Because I play Youth Only saves so regularly, I think I need to go back and properly delve into the scouting side of things and see how it's changed and what works and doesn't work. I will largely have to take the word of scouts in terms of making player signings, (and who we can sign will of course be very limited by only being able to sign Africans), but the upside of that is that we should be able to speculate a bit in terms of signing players who \"might\" be good, simply on the basis that they should be quite cheap and if it doesn't work out then it won't be a disaster. I'm hopeful that sooner or later we will unearth some gems.\n\nWhat might be a little more of a problem is training and working out which players are suited to what roles. Am I biting off a bit too much here? I think I might be. At the moment the decision is still up in the air. I definitely want to start with a Spanish club in Africa, (so that's Ceuta or Melilla who are in the 3rd and 4th tier respectively), but I don't know if the 4th tier is playable out of the box having never played in Spain. I think that with the self-imposed restrictions of only signing African players, I'm not sure that making the attribute levels invisible works with that because I want to test the scouting system and if I have nothing to judge it against then it will be literally the blind leading the blind. I think the answer is to play with attributes visible to start off with and then see how we get on.\n\nIf I get sacked by Ceuta for any reason, I will 1st try and apply for the job at Melila, and failing that I will install a new manager at Melila and continue from there.\n\nMy Belenenses save in FM22 was started with the Beta and continued all the way through with few if any problems. That's really impressive stability from the SI Towers boffins and I'm hoping for more of the same this time around. [Fingers crossed]\n\nEdited October 20, 2022 by Jimbokav1971\n\nI'm absolutely furious!\n\nWe don't have a single African at the club. Not a single one.\n\nThis is the Youth Intake view that I like to use and although we have 3 squads at the club, (Senior, B Team & U19's), this shows everyone.\n\nInitially I'm going to rank everyone by CA.\n\nLet's look at the best 3 players by CA, and see what they're like.\n\nGonzalez (SUI) looks more like a wide player than a central striker to me, and I'm not sure I like the look of him at all, (but then again I haven't seen anyone else yet so let's not be too harsh).\n\nHe's already a good player at this level and could develop to play higher. He doesn't like big matches though and I hope I don't have to rely on him.\n\nLiberto is much more to my liking and I will be astonished if he isn't my 1st choice ML. (I'm gutted that he's not a Libero with a name like that though).\n\nAdri Cuevas is a player I really like the look of. (I mean REALLY like the look of), but then I see his Det value. He's a leading player at this level, (and then some I think).\n\nInitial reactions on just looking at the 3 best CA players at the club are that I like 2 of them, (although 1 of them is old), but so far so good).\n\nNow I'm going to rank everyone by PA. The 3 players who were at the top ranked by CA, are ranked 1st, 4th and 5th by PA, and the #2 ranked player is a loanee. This isn't a great start.\n\nJuan Gutiérrez is in on loan, and at this stage I don't know if he's here because we need him or for some other reason.\n\nLuismi looks better than decent, and I won't have any problems with him playing on the right flank.\n\nAlain García looks decent, but I'm not completely sure of what the standard is like at the moment. We seem to have some very good players but also some pretty bang average players too.\n\nAll in all, not much to shout about in terms of PA.\n\nThe registration rules seem to limit us to 24 players, but we possibly don't have to register youngsters. (I hope that's the case anyway).\n\nInitial scouting.\n\nThere's a lot to pick through in this screen and I want to go slow so I don't miss anything. Apart from a little bit of scouting at the end of my Belenenses save I haven't done any proper scouting in ages, and I understand this area has had a revamp, so let's have a look.\n\nI like this graphic. I don't think it was there previously, but if it was there it's certainly more prominent now.\n\nWhen I was playing Youth Only and just wanted to keep an eye on our old players, there wasn't really a need for scouting range. Here I'm not so sure. The \"Scouting Range\" costs us £74,500 per season, but that doesn't include any scout reports. Our scouting budget is only £80,500 per season so effectively we only get to spend £6,000 on scouting this season. I'm not sure that makes good economic sense to me. The problem is, if I completely cancel the scouting range, (as I would have done in the past), I don't know how this impacts the existing knowledge we have. For example if we look at the main graphic above showing the Agent Offers and Free Agent Offers, you will see that on the right hand side it says that our knowledge of all 6 players is \"extensive\" and I think this takes over from the % scouted figure we used to see. My thinking, (at least ibn this early part of the save), is that I want to keep with the Scouting Range because it means I have less reason to scout anyone I want to look at, (because we already have \"Extensive knowledge\", but of course I'm going to test that. I would guess that while the info will remain extensive, it will also soon go out of date, (so still be extensive, but also be out of date).\n\nSomething else I'm not sure about it, what happens when we run out of scouting budget? Will I just not be able to scout? If I run out of scout budget after 10 months, when I can't pay the bill for the 11th month, do I automatically lose all the knowledge/reports that I have garnered over the course of the season?\n\nWe don't have a transfer budget, and that's absolutely fine, but we do have a wage budget of £61,650 per month and we're currently only spending..... Ahhhh. That's not our wage budget. That's our AVAILABLE wage budget. I quite like that. If that was there in previous issues of the game I never noticed. I've always worked it out manually. (£136,634 - £74,984 = £61,650).\n\nI need to get this going so let's click on it now and see where it takes us.\n\nOk, so we basically have to dial into the detail and tell our staff exactly what it is we're looking for.\n\nHaving had a brief look at the squad I think we're decent out wide but lacking pretty much everywhere. The biggest issue of the squad isn't a particular position, (at least I don't think it is), but more the fact that so many of them are 30+ and this is the biggest priority to change. I want us to sign youngsters, even if they don't turn out to be very good, because sooner or later we will find one that is. A scattergun approach if you will. Ok, that doesn't work. I actually have to pick a position, but I can pick all positions, so that's ok, but it only highlights positions within my 442 tactic so I still don't think I will see players who are only WBL, WBR, DM AML, AMR and AMC. Ok, well I will just stick with my 442 for now I guess. I don't really want to restrict players to just those that fit into our 442 tactic. If we're signing young players then we will have time to mould them to our system and at this point who cares if they're an AML rather than a ML. We will have to come back and look at that at some point in the future though. I'm particularly thinking of WB's who I want to play FB, but who I might want to scout for because of they greater attacking ability.\n\n[Edit] Actually, I have worked it out. The drop-down menu can be changed from the name of my tactic (442 High Press Bal), to any, and this activates all the positions not used in the 442 tactic.\n\nWell I thought I had it worked out by maybe not. When I manually click on all positions it shows like this.\n\nBut when I go back in to look at it, it's changed to this. So maybe there is a limit to the number of positions that can be searched or something. Is this a bug or by design do you think? I'm not sure. What did it look like in FM22?\n\nThe best I can do is this, but I'm concerned that it will only find me strikers who like to play on their own up top, or a centre back who liked to play free in a 3. That surely can't be right can it, but what's the point then?\n\nI also don't want to sign loans particularly at the moment. I'm signing youngsters, (hopefully), so the idea of clogging up the pathway to the 1st Team with players owned by other clubs seems counter-productive.\n\nIn terms of CA and PA I think that 2.0 should be the minimum for CA and I'm going to up it a little to 4.0 for PA. This might be a risk in that we might not see any, but we're playing in Spain and I think there should be loads, and the only real question is whether or not I can find some who are also African.\n\nAlthough I want to sign younger players, I'm not just talking about teenagers or even U21 players as I might do in the future, but just players who aren't the wrong side of 30. WIth that in mind I will stick the upper age limit at 25. Plenty of time for me to sell a 25 year old on for a profit. It's also going to significantly increase the number of returns I'm likely to get and could be the difference between signing Africans and signing nobody.\n\nWe can only scout Spain, but rather than limiting the search to 1 competition I will just scout the whole Country. (Again, scattergun approach).\n\nIn terms of priority, this will be my top priority, (because it will be my only priority until I work out where the holes in our squad are).\n\nThis is what I'm left with, but I realise I've missed out \"Further Details\".\n\nI don't know what that is so let's have a look.\n\nI wonder if under Nationality I can set it to African and then another value for 2nd Nationality African?\n\nIt will allow the 1st Nationality detail, but it won't allow 2nd Nationality which is obviously frustrating, but better than nothing.\n\nSo our end \"Top Priority Recruitment Focus\" looks like this. Let's see how that gets on.\n\nThis doesn't look great, but then again we only have 1 scout. He doesn't seem to have any knowledge of anything though.....\n\nThere were about 6-8 scouting recommendations to start with so I went through them one by one and discarded everyone who didn't have an African Nationality/Second Nationality/ (By the way, from now on I'm going to just say Nationality rather than Nationality or 2nd Nationality because it's a pain. When I say Nationality I also mean or 2nd Nationality).\n\nChentouf (ESP)(MAR) doesn't look great, but he appears to have good PA and he's African. That might be good enough for me. I've taken him on trial and will have a look at him before deciding."
