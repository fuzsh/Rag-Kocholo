        "text": "Santiago Solari started his Real Madrid reign on a positive note as goals from Karim Benzema and Marco Asensio gave his side a 4-0 win over Melilla in the Copa del Rey.\n\nWith Julen Lopetegui sacked on Monday, it was up to Castilla coach and former midfielder to take the team for this away trip to the north coast of Africa. Real Madrid needed a good display after their El Clasico, and they got it for the most part.\n\nVinicius Junior was handed his first start for Real Madrid and shone, contributing an assist for Asensio’s goal on the stroke of half time. This came after Benzema had opened the scoring after a great run and cut back by Alvaro Odriozola down the right.\n\nTransfers\n\nMan Utd, Arsenal and Chelsea set to miss out on Benzema - Paper Round\n\n31/01/2024 at 08:15\n\nOdriozola himself added his name to the score sheet late on, smashing home from close range following a scramble that involved Vinicius and Sergio Reguillon, with substitute Cristo Gonzalez capping the scoring on what was a much-needed comfortable evening for Real Madrid.\n\nTALKING POINT - Did Santiago Solari do enough to impress on his bow?\n\nReal Madrid have been here before. Zinedine Zidane was meant to be an interim appointment, but a strong start to life as the senior manager at the club meant they had to offer him the job on a full time basis. Solari finds himself in a similar position, so did he do enough on his bow to impress? Real Madrid looked more dangerous in the final third, for sure, but the real test will come against better opposition in La Liga this weekend.\n\nReal Madrid's Argentinian coach Santiago Solari (L) gestures as Real Madrid's Spanish midfielder Lucas Vazquez (R) walks past during the Spanish King's Cup football match between UD Melilla and Real Madrid CF at the Alvarez Claro municipal stadium in the\n\nImage credit: Getty Images\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH - Vinicius Junior (Real Madrid)\n\nThe hype is real, it would seem. Much has been said and written about Vinicius since his move to Real Madrid as a 16-year-old, with many arguing that he should be in the first team fold. On this basis, they might have a point. Vinicius contributed an assist, struck the crossbar and posed a threat throughout. Melilla might have been lower league opposition, but there was enough in this display to suggest that the Brazilian is the real deal.\n\nPLAYER RATINGS\n\nMelilla - Barrio 7, Sofian 5, Carrion 5, Richi 6, Mahanan 5, Alfonso 5, Martinez 6, Garrido 5, Yacine 7, Otegui 5, Ruano 7.\n\nReal Madrid - Navas 6, Odriozola 8, Sanchez 7, Ramos 6, Reguilon 7, Llorente 5, Ceballos 7, Asensio 8, Lucas 6, Vinicius 9, Benzema 6. Subs - Cristo 6, Nacho 5, Valverde 5.\n\nVinicius y Marco Asensio celebran un gol del Real Madrid ante el Melilla\n\nImage credit: Getty Images\n\nKEY MOMENTS\n\n25’ What a save! Vazquez opens up his body just inside the Melilla penalty area, getting the looping shot away on goal, but Barrio does so well to tip the effort over the bar! It might have picked up a deflection too.\n\n28’ GOAL! Melilla 0-1 Real Madrid: Real Madrid have the opener and it's the first goal of the Solari era! Odriozola made it to the byline and then squared a pass for Benzema to finish into the empty net from about two yards out! That all looked very easy for the visitors.\n\n39’ Vazquez should score! Good play from Asensio sets Vazquez clean through on goal, but the Real Madrid winger shoots straight at Barrio, who makes the stop with his feet. That should have been a goal.\n\n45’ GOAL! Melilla 0-2 Real Madrid: Real Madrid double their advantage just before the break! It's a wonderful pass from Vinicius to find Asensio around the penalty spot and he fires a low finish into the back of the home side's net.\n\n70’ Rattled off the bar! So close to Vinicius' first goal for Real Madrid. Asensio set up the Brazilian who smashes a shot off the Melilla crossbar! That would have been some moment.\n\n79’ GOAL! Melilla 0-3 Real Madrid: Odriozola adds a third for Real Madrid and that's his first goal for the club! Reguillon and Vinicius caused a scramble inside the box and then the right back was on hand to smash home into the empty net. That should be the tie over.\n\n90’ GOAL! Melilla 0-4 Real Madrid: The substitute completes the scoring late on, heading home from close range after a clipped cross into the box by the impressive Odriozola. That will be that for Real Madrid, and the final whistle blows.\n\nKEY STATS\n\nKarim Benzema became the first La Liga player to score in four different competitions this season.\n\nTransfers\n\nMan Utd duo wanted by Al-Nassr, Benzema wants 'temporary' transfer – Paper Round\n\n24/01/2024 at 08:39\n\nTransfers\n\nMan Utd opt against Benzema pursuit, PSG eye £100m Guimaraes transfer – Paper Round\n\n16/01/2024 at 08:15"
