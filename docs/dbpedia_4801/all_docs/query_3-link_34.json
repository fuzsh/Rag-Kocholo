Expat Tips\n\nSituated in the southwest of Europe, Spain provides opportunities amid a vibrant cultural heritage and a robust economy. Ranking as the fourth most populous country in the European Union with over 47 million inhabitants, Spain's dynamic economy and evolving demographics contribute to its distinct character.\n\nIn the following article, we will give you an overview of the labour market in Spain including the current labour trends and shortgages and the most in-demand jobs by sector and region with the view of helping you to successfully apply for a Spanish work visa.\n\nDemographics and Economy\n\nDespite a slight dip in Spanish nationals in early 2022, there's a rise in non-nationals, including Romanians, Italians, Germans, Moroccans, Colombians, and Britons. Spain's economy is ranked fourth in the EU and 14th globally by nominal GDP, driven by domestic demand and external sectors.\n\nLabour Market\n\nSpain's labour market is on an upswing, creating over one million permanent jobs in the past year after a significant labour reform. There's a move towards European labour market standards, reducing temporary employment and youth unemployment. Challenges include an ageing population and persistent youth and long-term unemployment.\n\nBusiness and Sectors\n\nSpain's business landscape involves 3.43 million active businesses, with small units in services and major international players in sectors like infrastructure, renewable energy, and tourism. Recent positive trends show resilience despite a fragmented structure.\n\nLabour Trends and Shortages\n\nThe 2022 employment balance in Spain reflects recovery, with declining unemployment and more affiliated workers. Long-term unemployment, especially among women and those above 45, remains a challenge. The economic recovery brings forth labour shortages due to digitalisation, an ageing population, and shifting youth occupational interests.\n\nIn-Demand Jobs\n\nSpain faces a significant number of job vacancies, notably in the services sector. According to the National Statistics Institute (INE), companies estimated 140,517 job vacancies in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily concentrated in services. However, despite these vacancies, Spain is noted in Eurostat data as having some of the lowest rates of available employment in Europe.\n\nReskilling in Health Crisis\n\nThe ongoing health crisis leaves a lasting impact on Spain's labour market, necessitating reskilling as job profiles evolve. While job applications flood public employment services, aligning skills with the changing job market is a challenge.\n\nIn this context, our exploration delves deeper into Spain's most sought-after jobs, analysing sectors and regions to guide those navigating the nuances of Spain's changing employment landscape.\n\nWhich jobs are in demand and will help me get a Spanish work visa?\n\nAccording to data from the EURES website, the following roles stand out as highly sought-after on a national scale.
