        "text": "Spain is situated in the south-western corner of the European continent and extends to more than half a million km². It is the fourth most populous country in the European Union with a population of over 47 million, 85 % of whom are Spanish nationals. In relative terms, the population has grown year on year due to negative net population growth offset by a positive migration balance. The number of Spanish nationals underwent a slight decline at the beginning of 2022 but a rise was recorded in the number of non-nationals, both EU and non-EU nationals. The highest number of non-nationals registered in the EU population register were Romanians, Italians and Germans. Whereas the largest numbers of non-EU nationals were from Morocco, Colombia and the United Kingdom. The largest increases over the last year occurred among citizens of Colombia, Italy and Venezuela, and the largest decreases occurred amongst those from Romania, China and Brazil.\n\nThe Spanish economy is the fourth largest in the European Union and the 14th largest in the world in terms of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). It is in an expansionary phase, with significant growth in GDP rates driven mainly by domestic demand and the external sector. The macroeconomic scenario accompanying the General State Budget is based on GDP growth of 4.4 % in 2022 with projected growth of 2.1 % in 2023. In a scenario of slower growth in the European economy, Spain will maintain levels above the average for the euro area and the main developed countries, in line with the estimates drafted by the main national and international organisations. The growth forecast for this year is based on the encouraging performance of the labour market, healthy growth in the external sector and a rise in investment due to the implementation of the Recovery Plan. In 2023, the unemployment rate is expected to continue its downward trend, falling to 12.8 %.\n\nThe positive trend has made it possible for more than one million permanent jobs to be created in Spain over the last year, five times more than before the recent labour reform. Since the approval of this reform, the labour market has been converging rapidly towards the European average, due to a reduction in the high rate of temporary employment and unemployment, especially youth unemployment: the lowest youth unemployment in history was recorded in September. Beyond the expected short-term and medium-term developments, the main challenges and vulnerabilities in the Spanish labour market include the gradually ageing population, the high unemployment rate – especially among young people and those over 55 – and the high percentage of long-term unemployed.\n\nThe most recent data collected in the Central Directory of Companies (DIRCE) as at 1 January 2022 and published by the National Statistics Institute (INE) indicates that the number of active businesses rose by 1.9 % in 2021, to 3.43 million. From an employment standpoint, Spain’s business structure is highly fragmented, consisting of small business units. In fact, 8 out of every 10 companies in Spain have 2 employees or fewer. The majority of small businesses are in the services sector, especially in trade. In contrast, most large companies operate in the industrial sector. Moreover, a significant number of large companies are major international players in sectors related to infrastructure development, renewable energy, tourism, banking, insurance, the textile industry, health technology, aeronautics, the agri-food sector and the automotive industry.\n\nAccording to information from the Observatory for Occupations in the State Public Employment Service in Spain, the 2022 employment balance was positive: the year ended with more employed and affiliated workers than before the pandemic and with a fall in unemployment. The unemployment rate for the fourth quarter stood at 12.87 %: 2007 was the last year with lower unemployed numbers in the month of December.\n\nThe number of affiliated workers increased in all sectors, with the exception of the primary sector, which showed a decrease of 3.07 %. The largest increases were again in construction and services, with above-average increases, and to a lesser extent in industry. The economic activity sectors that drove the improvement in the labour market during the year were: Food and beverage services, Programming, consultancy and other IT-related activities, Education, Health activities, Public administration and defence, Compulsory social security, Specialised construction activities and Accommodation services.\n\nRegistered unemployment continued to decline in 2022 and the year ended with 2.84 million unemployed jobseekers, 8.64 % fewer than in 2021. Above-average declines were recorded among men, and people under 30. Long-term unemployment stood at 42.62 %, after a reduction of seven percentage points. Its incidence is higher among women and those over 45 years of age. The typical unemployed person's profile is still predominantly female, aged 55 or over, not educated beyond Compulsory Secondary Education level, seeking employment in the services sector and registered as unemployed for more than six months.\n\nAccording to information from the Observatory for Occupations in the State Public Employment Service in Spain, the economic recovery is exposing labour shortages in some economic activities. This may be due to the acceleration of certain changes linked to the digitalisation of the economy or due to other factors such as an ageing population, lack of generational replacement or lack of interest among young people in traditional occupations due to the working conditions.\n\nAccording to information from the National Statistics Institute (INE), in the fourth quarter of 2022, companies estimated that they had 140 517 job vacancies, which were almost exclusively concentrated in the services sector. However, according to Eurostat data, Spain is one of the countries with the lowest rates of available employment in Europe.\n\nThe most difficult vacancies to fill are mainly those related to information and communication technologies (ICT) - especially STEM professionals - as well as in renewable energies, Healthcare, Hospitality, Construction, Fishing and Metal Repairs. However, there are also many vacancies in lower-skilled professions in the same sectors.\n\nAs regards job types, technological roles such as data analysts, computer engineers, engineers with expertise in renewable energy, big data and IT security technicians and experts in business intelligence and data mining have become increasingly hard to fill in the last year. Depending on the seasons and areas, shortages have been recorded for plumbers, bricklayers and carpenters in construction, nurses, health care assistants and technical specialists in health care, waiters and cooks in hospitality, truck drivers and forklift drivers in transport.\n\nThe biggest problem at present is the shortage of medium-skilled staff, which corresponds to vocational training qualifications at intermediate and higher levels, especially in the fields of transport and vehicle maintenance and health care.\n\nAndalusia is located in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, in the southernmost part of the European continent. It borders the autonomous communities of Extremadura and Castile-La Mancha to the north, and Murcia to the east, the Alborán Sea and the Atlantic Ocean to the south, and Portugal to the west. It consists of eight provinces (Almería, Cádiz, Córdoba, Granada, Huelva, Jaén, Málaga and Seville). Andalusia is Spain’s second-largest autonomous community (87 597 km²) and has the largest population as at 1 January 2022, with 8 500 187 inhabitants. Its population density is 97.04 inhabitants/km² and its population grew by 0.33 % compared to the previous year. The most populous provinces are Seville, Málaga and Cádiz. Andalusia is home to 741 378 foreign residents, accounting for 8.72 % of the population and representing a 4.14 % year-on-year increase.\n\nAccording to data from the Central Directory of Companies of the National Statistics Institute (DIRCE, as at 1 January 2022) the business community of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia comprised 545 502 registered companies, 55.40 % of which had no employees (302 214). Of the total number of companies with paid workers (243 288), 91.39 % have fewer than 9 workers and 7.47 % have between 10 and 49 workers, reflecting the predominance of small businesses. The economic activities in which the largest numbers of companies operate are: retail, except motorcycles and other motor vehicles; food and beverage services; building construction; wholesale, except motorcycles and other motor vehicles; property activities; and health activities. The largest companies include: Endesa Generación, Bida Farma and Atlantic Copper, which occupy the top positions among the strongest companies. By provinces, the companies with the highest turnover are the following: Cosentino Group, Unica Group and FJ Sánchez Sucesores in Almería; APM Terminals Algeciras, Osborne Group and Iberinox Recycling Plus in Cádiz; Cunext Copper Industries, Deoleo Global and SCA Ganadera del Valle de los Pedroches in Córdoba; Bida Farma, Lactalis Puleva and Coviran in Granada; Atlantic Copper, Minas de Aguas Teñidas and Atalaya Riotinto Minera in Huelva; Aceites del Sur-Coosur, Petroprix Energía and Grupo Alvic FR Mobiliario in Jaén; China Red, Compañía Logistica Acotral and Mercaoleo in Málaga; and Endesa Generación, Bida Farma and Heineken España in Seville.\n\nAccording to data published by the National Statistics Institute (Spanish Regional Accounts), the Autonomous Community of Andalusia contributes 13.3 % of Spanish GDP. The services sector is the autonomous community’s predominant economic activity, followed by industry, agriculture and construction. The first estimate of Andalusian gross domestic product for 2021 indicated a 5.5 % increase over 2020 in terms of volume, the same as for Spain as a whole. Gross domestic product per capita in 2021 was EUR 18 906, 7.8 % higher than the previous year and 25.85 % less than the national average.\n\nAccording to Andalusian Regional Accounts for the fourth quarter, the balance for 2022 in Andalusia was real GDP growth of 5.2 %, three tenths of a percentage point below that of Spain (5.5 %). Compared with the European environment, the growth of the Andalusian economy in 2022 largely exceeded the average for the euro area (3.5 % according to Eurostat) and the EU (3.6 %), which contributed to the convergence process. Moreover, this was achieved at a time of economic crisis brought about by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, high inflation and drought. Estimates by Analistas Económicos de Andalucía suggest a moderation of Andalusian GDP growth to 1.6 % in 2023, and a 1.3 % increase in employment, in a context of high uncertainty in which the risk of recession for the main world economies has increased.\n\nAccording to the latest Labour Force Survey (LFS) data for the fourth quarter of 2022, of the total population aged 16 and over in Andalusia (7 138 700), 4 026 100 are economically active, with 81 % employed and 19 % unemployed. The unemployment rate in Andalusia (19.00 %) is among the highest in Spain, exceeded only by the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla. The figure for women is 21.96 % and for men it is 16.45 %. The provinces of Cádiz, Huelva and Granada have the highest unemployment rates in this autonomous community, while Almería and Seville have the lowest rates.\n\nAccording to data from social security records, in December 2022 the number of registered workers increased by 102 347 in comparison with the same month of the previous year. An increase was recorded in the number of workers registered in the General Scheme and in the Special Scheme for Self-Employed Workers, while a decrease was recorded in the number registered in the Special Agricultural and Household Employees' Systems.\n\nThe registered number of unemployed in Andalusia in December 2022 was 727 097 people, 7.45 % less than the same month of the previous year. Unemployed foreign workers accounted for 7.64 %. The number of employment contracts concluded in 2022 was 4 069 741. This is a 11.30 % decrease over the previous year, and is mainly due to the services sector; foreign workers accounted for 15.99 % of the contracts issued in Andalusia. The percentages of contracts finalised in Huelva and Almería were particularly high, with 39.54 % and 38.75 %, respectively.\n\nSPANISH PUBLIC STATE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE\n\nwww.sepe.es\n\nSPANISH NATIONAL STATISTICS INSTITUTE\n\nwww.ine.es\n\nMINISTRY OF LABOUR AND SOCIAL ECONOMY\n\nwww.mites.gob.es\n\nMINISTRY OF INCLUSION, SOCIAL SECURITY AND MIGRATION.\n\nwww.seg-social.es\n\nMINISTRY OF EMPLOYMENT, TRAINING AND SELF-EMPLOYMENT\n\nwww.juntadeandalucia.es/organismos/empleoformacionytrabajoautonomo.html\n\nANDALUSIA STATISTICS INSTITUTE\n\nhttps://www.juntadeandalucia.es/institutodeestadisticaycartografia/\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSTS OF ANDALUSIA\n\nwww.analistaseconomicos.com\n\nThe Autonomous Community of Aragon, situated in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula and bordering France, is made up of the provinces of Huesca, Teruel and Zaragoza. It is the fourth largest autonomous community in Spain in terms of area (47 720 km²). According to data compiled by the INE from the municipal population registers, in early 2022 it had 1 326 315 inhabitants and a population density of nearly 28 inhabitants per km². This makes it one of the most sparsely populated autonomous communities in Spain, well below the national average of 93 inhabitants per km². The population is spread among 731 municipalities, of which just over a quarter have over 500 inhabitants. Over half of the population lives in Zaragoza. In addition to being a sparsely-populated region, it has an ageing population and a high dependency rate. The population level has been maintained since 2017 with slight increases, especially due to the contribution of immigration. The minimum increase in the last year was specifically due to the arrival of non-nationals in the community, which compensated for the loss of the national population. Currently, the foreign population accounts for 12.42 % and the largest number of non-nationals are from Romania, Morocco, Nicaragua, Colombia and China.\n\nAccording to estimates from the Aragon Institute for Statistics, Aragon’s GDP grew year on year by 2.2 % in the fourth quarter of 2022. This growth is five tenths lower than that recorded for Spain as a whole (2.7 % per annum), and is higher than that of the euro area (1.8 % per annum). Estimates by the Government of the Autonomous Community of Aragon forecast GDP growth of 2.1 % for 2023.\n\nAccording to the Central Directory of Companies (DIRCE), in 2022 the number of businesses trading fell by 0.87 % to 89 376. Of these, 70 % were in the services sector, more than half had no employees on the payroll and approximately 45 % had between 1 and 49 employees. Among the larger companies, there are 704 with between 50 and 1 000 employees and 24 with more than 1 000 employees.\n\nAragon is one of the largest industrial centres in Spain and has made progress in recent years towards some sectoral diversification. The automotive industry is a major player in the region, in which more than 350 companies from this sector are present and one third of regional exports depend on it. At the same time, with almost 1 000 businesses in Aragon, the agri-food sector is the second largest industrial sector in terms of turnover and employment, accounting for more than 10 % of GDP. In addition to these sectors, logistics, tourism and renewable energy contribute to the industry in this region. The head offices of industrial companies in various sectors, such as construction machinery, agricultural machinery, paper, metallurgy, electronics and chemicals, are also located in Aragon.\n\nThe region’s largest companies are located in the province of Zaragoza. Opel España, with more than 5 000 workers, is the largest company and various ancillary companies depend on it. Other companies of note in this province are paper manufacturer SAICA, Alliance Healthcare (distributor of pharmaceuticals), Simply supermarkets, Pikolín (mattress and mattress base manufacturer), Inditex (textile manufacturing and marketing), and BSH (domestic appliances). In Teruel, companies of note include UTISA, part of the FINSA group (manufacture of veneer sheets and wood panels), Ronal Ibérica SAU (tyres and bath screens), Casting Ros (automotive components) and the Térvalis group (which is involved in a growing number of activities, including: plant nutrition, animal nutrition, logistics, food, sustainable energy and agrotourism); Arco Iris Group (a cooperative located in Matarraña and dedicated to livestock production, industrialisation and the sale of food by-products) and Tarmac Aragón S.L. (aircraft repair and maintenance). Huesca is home to the pharmaceutical company Bieffe Medital (Baxter group), Becton Dickinson (clinical equipment) and Ercros (chemicals). The primary and agri-food sector is a key industry in this province, especially Litera Meat and Fribin (meat processing) and Piensos Costa, Mazana Piensos Compuestos, Cincaporc and Agropienso (fodder).\n\nDue to the region’s geographical location, logistics is a key industry in Aragon. Aragon has logistics hubs in Zaragoza (Plaza, the biggest goods and transport hub in southern Europe), Huesca (Plhus), Teruel (Platea), Fraga (PlFraga) and Monzón, as well as the Zaragoza Maritime Terminal (TMZ). The establishment of the new logistics platform La Melusa-Tamarite is expected to create 2 000 direct jobs when it reaches its full occupancy. Aragon also has the second busiest Spanish airport in terms of cargo (Zaragoza) and the biggest airport in Spain and in Europe for parking, maintenance and reuse of aircraft (Teruel), which is in the process of growing.\n\nOCCUPATIONS OBSERVATORY\n\nwww.sepe.es\n\nPUBLIC EMPLOYMENT SERVICE\n\nwww.sepe.es and www.inaem.es\n\nGOVERNMENT OF ARAGON\n\nwww.aragon.es\n\nMINISTRY OF LABOUR AND SOCIAL ECONOMY\n\nwww.mites.gob.es\n\nMINISTRY OF INCLUSION, SOCIAL SECURITY AND MIGRATION\n\nwww.inclusion.gob.es\n\nSPANISH NATIONAL STATISTICS INSTITUTE\n\nwww.ine.es\n\nFUNDACIÓN DE LAS CAJAS DE AHORROS (SAVINGS BANK FOUNDATION)\n\nwww.funcas.es\n\nThe Principality of Asturias is located in the north of the Iberian Peninsula.

They make up one of the 17 Spanish autonomous communities and are one of the European Union’s outermost regions. The coordinates of the islands are north latitude 27°37’ and 29°25’ and west longitude 13°20’ and 18°10’. They are situated just over 1 200 km from the Iberian Peninsula and just over 2 000 km from the Spanish capital.\n\nThe autonomous community has two provinces: Santa Cruz de Tenerife, towards the west, and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, situated to the east. Santa Cruz de Tenerife comprises the islands of Tenerife, La Gomera, El Hierro and La Palma. Las Palmas comprises Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. In administrative terms, the island of La Graciosa can be added to the seven islands mentioned, but it does not have its own administration.\n\nThe region has an area of 7 447.00 km2, 2 177 701 inhabitants on 1 January 2022 and a population density of 292.42 inhabitants per square kilometre. This autonomous community ranks eighth in Spain in terms of population.\n\nThe population of the Canary Islands has increased by 0.22 % since 2021.

According to recent data from the municipal population register, 585 402 people reside in Cantabria, marking a small increase (0.15 %) in line with the trend for the Kingdom of Spain as a whole, for which the increase stands at 0.19 %. The average age is 45 and life expectancy is 84. 51.5 % of the population are women and 48.5 % are men. The population density is 110 inhabitants/km². In terms of the origin of the population, three quarters are from the region itself and, of the remaining quarter, two out of every three are from other parts of Spain. The rest were born abroad, mostly in Europe and Latin America.\n\nThe bulk of the population, and hence economic activity, is found on the coast, particularly the east coast, along what is known as the ‘Arc and extension of the Bay of Biscay’, which encompasses Santander and Torrelavega and their outskirts as the main conurbations, the former known for its services sector and the latter for its traditional industry. The coast features a mild, temperate Atlantic climate with moderate day/night temperature fluctuations and average annual temperatures of approximately 17°C, precipitation of around 1 200 l/m2 and over 1 600 hours of sun. Inland, the climate is more moderate and continental. Additional data supplementing the census show that 70 % of commutes from home to work – by any means including walking – take under 20 minutes, bringing us more into line with the ‘15 minutes’ commitment.\n\nThe economic recovery was consolidated during 2022 and, to a large extent, marked an end to the previous two years’ pandemic effect. The major national economic indicators were encouraging for the year, especially when compared to 2020, but this should not be interpreted as an overall, even recovery to pre-pandemic levels. The Autonomous Community of Cantabria, which represents around 1.15 % of national GDP, is caught up in this positive trend. It is also on track to end the year with increases close to those of Spain as a whole, between 4 and 5 percentage points of year-on-year GDP growth, though this remains to be confirmed. The outlook is rosy for economic sectors, with services, construction and industry leading the recovery. The activities leading the growth include trade, transport, hotels and catering, information and communications, construction and, to a lesser extent, those related to industry and energy or the primary sector, which is quite limited in this community. Per capita income in Cantabria and in Spain as a whole has recovered after the major setback caused by the pandemic, standing at EUR 23 730 and EUR 25 498, respectively, in 2021 (the latest year for which figures are available).\n\nThe most recent update of the Central Directory of Companies (DIRCE) shows a total of 38 960 companies in Cantabria, with 44 758 active premises or places of business. Cantabria’s business structure is highly fragmented. In fact, slightly more than half of the companies have no employees and of those that do, 83 % are in the band with fewer than six; companies with over 50 workers account for only 1.4 % of the total number of companies. The most common legal forms of companies are sole trader and limited company (SL). Quantitatively, the region’s main economic activities are retail and wholesale trade, construction of buildings and their specialities, food and beverage services, land transport, real estate activities, personal services, health activities, education, legal and accounting activities, and technical architectural and engineering services, which account for almost three quarters of active enterprises. The number of people paying contributions to the public social security system (221 978) as at 31 December 2022 had increased by 2.39 % compared with the same month of the previous year.\n\nThe consolidation in recovery recorded in 2022 was reflected in the Cantabrian labour market, despite the strong impact of the multiple crises that afflict the economy on a permanent basis. The recovery is evident in the estimates of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the data provided by the various public registers, especially the Ministry of Labour and the Social Economy and the Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration. The following major employment indicators serve as examples: a rise in the number of those registered as working (2.39 %) and, consequently, a reduction in the number of unemployed persons (9.04 %). The LFS data on Cantabria for the fourth quarter of 2022 show that the activity rate was 54.26 %, and the unemployment rate was 10.34 %, whereas the national figures were 58.52 % and 12.87 %, respectively.\n\nCastile and Leon, located in the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula, is the region with the largest area in Spain and the third largest in the European Union with 94 224 km2.

One of the main problems facing Galicia, together with depopulation of the rural area, is its ageing population. The ageing rate is increasing year on year, and in 2022 stood at 213.54 % (213 people over 64 years old, for every 100 under 16).\n\nIn 2021, GDP at market prices in Galicia was EUR 63 230 043 000, after increasing by 7.83 % compared with 2020. It represents 5.24% of the national total and is the sixth autonomous community in terms of GDP among all the 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities that make up Spain.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, the number of employed persons increased by 1.21 % (from 1 091 300 to 1 104 500); the number of economically active persons increased by 0.78 % (from 1 226 400 to 1 235 900) and the number of unemployed persons decreased by 2.73 %, i.e. 3 700 fewer, bringing the total down to 131 400. There was an increase of 2.33 % in the number of people paying social security contributions, which in absolute terms comes to 23 513 additional contributors, rising from 1 009 111 on 31 December 2021 to 1 032 624 on the same date in 2022.\n\nAccording to information from the National Statistics Institute (Central Directory of Companies), in 2022, Galicia’s business community comprised 196 530 companies, mostly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and there were 13 (three more than in 2021) companies with over 5 000 workers, 7 in the province of A Coruña, 4 in Pontevedra, 1 in Lugo and 1 in Ourense. Since 2021, the total number of companies has risen by 0.96 %.\n\nThe largest companies in Galicia, in terms of turnover and number of employees, are the Inditex group in Arteixo (A Coruña), in the textile sector; Stellantis Vigo (Pontevedra), in automobile production; Gadisa (Betanzos) Vegalsa in A Coruña and Froiz in Poio (Pontevedra) in food distribution; Coren in Ourense, food processing; Financiera Maderera SA (FINSA) in Santiago (A Coruña), working in wood processing, or canneries, Nueva Pescanova and Jealsa-Rianxeira, the former based in Chapela (Pontevedra), and the latter in Boiro (A Coruña).\n\nBased on the number of workers paying social security contributions, the most important activities are: retail trade, except motor vehicles and motorbikes, health activities, food and beverage service activities, education, public administration and defence, compulsory social security, specialised construction activities, wholesale trade and trade intermediaries, except motor vehicles and motorbikes and land and pipeline transport, all with more than 30 000 registrations.\n\nAccording to information from the Observatory for Occupations in the State Public Employment Service in Spain, in December 2022, the provinces of A Coruña and Pontevedra accounted for 78.95 % of the 142 222 unemployed job seekers (a decrease of 6.79 % compared to 2021) in Galicia, and 81.83 % of the 845 243 hirings during 2022, (7.95 % fewer than the previous year. However, this has a lot to do with the entry into force of Royal Decree-Law 32/2021 of 28 December 2021, which converted many temporary contracts to permanent contracts, reducing the number of contracts a person signs per year, and therefore the number of contracts as a whole).\n\nThe remaining 21.05 % of jobseekers were distributed quite evenly between Lugo (9.60 %) and Ourense (11.46 %), while, in terms of contracts, Lugo accounted for 10.16 % and Ourense, 8.01 %. Women accounted for a total of 57.92 % of the unemployed and 48.99 % of hirings. Young people under the age of 30 represented 11.07 % of the unemployed, with a recruitment rate of 32.75 %, while those over 45 accounted for 59.38 % of registered unemployment, with a recruitment rate of 28.74 %. People with disabilities accounted for 5.67 % of the unemployed and were awarded 2.13 % of the contracts. The recruitment rate of non-nationals was 9.91 % and the unemployment rate for this group was 7.36 %. A total of 47.03 % of unemployed jobseekers are long-term unemployed.\n\nThe economic activities with the largest increase in the number of contracts during 2022, and which, in turn, exceeded 1% of total recruitment, were: creative, arts and entertainment activities (31.87 %), motion picture, video and television programme production, sound recording and music publishing activities (22.42 %), sporting, recreational and entertainment activities (3.46 %), accommodation services (2.90 %) and activities of households as employers of domestic staff (1.70 %). Activities showing the biggest decreases, including those representing more than 1 % of recruitment, are: storage and auxiliary transport activities (-30.39 %), food industries (-21.89 %), manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers (-17.89 %) and wholesale trade and commercial intermediaries, except motor vehicles and motorcycles where recruitment fell by 16.80 %.\n\nThe Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands comprises the islands of the Balearic archipelago, located in the Mediterranean Sea off the east coast of the Iberian Peninsula. It has an area of nearly 5 000 km² with a total coastline of approximately 1 800 km. It has nearly 1 200 000 inhabitants, 18.87 % of whom are non-nationals according to the municipal population registers where they are registered. In 2022, the population of the islands increased by 0.31 %. The most numerous EU nationals are Italians, Germans and Romanians. The largest presence of non-EU nationals comes from Moroccan, Colombian and British citizens.\n\nThe economy of the Balearic Islands experienced significant GDP growth in 2022, reaching 10.7 %. The recovery is expected to continue in the coming years at a more moderate pace. Increases of 3.1 % and 3.2 % are predicted for the future and a return to the pre-crisis level of activity is expected. The growth forecast for this year is based on the positive performance of the labour market, a flourishing external sector and the growth of investment through the implementation of NextGenerationEU (NGEU) funds. The unemployment rate is expected to continue its downward trend in 2023.\n\nThe most recent data collected in the Central Directory of Companies (DIRCE) as at 1 January 2022 and published by INE indicates that the number of active businesses increased by 3.17 % in 2021, to 101 236 million. From an employment point of view, the business structure of this community is highly fragmented into small business units, to the extent that 8 of every 10 companies have just 1 or 2 employees or are individual or family undertakings. However, it does have a small number of large companies in the areas of tourism, passenger transport, trade, private security and travel agencies.\n\nOverall, the balance for 2022 was positive for employment. The year ended with more employed and registered workers than before the pandemic and with a reduction in unemployment. This means that the unemployment rate for the fourth quarter stands at 10.91 %, four points below the previous year, and lower registered unemployment figures were recorded for December than in December 2007.\n\nAt the end of the year, registrations rose by 5.72 % to more than 450 000. The largest increases were again in construction and services. The economic activity sectors that drove the improvement in the labour market during the year were: health activities, construction of buildings, housing services, specialised construction activities, food and beverage services and education.\n\nThe number of hirings in 2022 showed an increase of 28.02 % compared to 2021, and there was strong dynamism in permanent recruitment owing to the impact of the labour reform approved at the end of 2021, which has been fully effective since April and introduced significant changes to recruitment arrangements.\n\nRegistered unemployment continued to decline and ended the year with 35 851 unemployed jobseekers, 35.95 % fewer than last year. Foreign unemployed persons accounted for 20.62 %. Men and the unemployed aged 25-44 registered above-average declines.\n\nBeyond the expected short- and medium-term growth, the main challenges and vulnerabilities of the Balearic labour market include a marked seasonality, progressive ageing of the population that hinders generational replacement in some sectors, a lack of qualified professionals, as well as rates of unemployment that are still high among young people, older workers and the long-term unemployed.\n\nSPANISH PUBLIC STATE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE\n\nwww.sepe.es\n\nSPANISH NATIONAL STATISTICS INSTITUTE\n\nwww.ine.es\n\nAUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF THE BALEARIC ISLANDS\n\nhttp://www.caib.es\n\nEL ECONOMISTA.ES Ranking of Companies\n\nhttps://ranking-empresas.eleconomista.es/empresas-baleares.html\n\nBALEARIC ISLAND EMPLOYMENT SERVICE (SOIB)\n\nhttp://www.caib.es/govern/organigrama/area.do?lang=ca&co\n\nMAJORCA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\nhttp://www.cambramallorca.com/\n\nIBIZA AND FORMENTERA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\nhttp://www.camaraibizayformentera.com/\n\nThe Autonomous Community of Madrid is situated in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. Territorially, it is a medium-sized community, with an area of 8 028 square kilometres. Its borders roughly form an equilateral triangle, the base of which adjoins the province of Toledo to the south; its northern apex is at the Somosierra mountain pass. To the north and west, it borders the provinces of Segovia and Avila and to the east and south Toledo, Guadalajara and Cuenca. Madrid is a single-province community and therefore has no provincial government. Its capital city is also the capital of Spain. According to the INE on 1 January 2022, the number of inhabitants in the community amounted to 6 750 336, and the population density was 840 inhabitants per square kilometre. This population is mainly concentrated in the capital. Some 14.07 % of its residents are non-nationals, 52.15 % are women and 47.85 % are men. The population of Madrid dropped slightly compared with the previous year.\n\nMadrid’s economy is one of the largest in Spain, mainly because the city of Madrid is the nation’s capital. GDP per inhabitant in 2021 was the highest in Spain, at EUR 34 821 per inhabitant. This exceeded the average amount registered for Spain and Europe.\n\nAccording to data from the Central Companies Directory 2022, 16.59 % of active companies in Spain are located in Madrid. This percentage makes it the autonomous community with the second highest number of companies, after Catalonia. The Madrid business community has grown above the national average over the last year. This sector is mainly tertiary, with 85.25 % of the enterprises belonging to the tertiary sector, 3.68 % to industry and 11.07 % to construction. Although the community does not specialise in industry, it is ranked fourth for numbers of companies in this sector. In terms of provincial representation (over 2 %), wholesale trade and trade intermediaries, except for motor vehicles and motorcycles, retail trade, except for motor vehicles and motorcycles, real estate activities, construction of buildings, legal and accounting activities, health activities, food and beverage services, office administration and other business support activities, land and pipeline transport; specialist construction work; technical architecture and engineering services; technical testing and analysis; education; other personal services; other professional, scientific and technical services; advertising and market studies; auxiliary work for financial and insurance services.\n\nMadrid had the second highest numbers of people paying social security in December 2022 after Catalonia, representing 17.40 % of the whole of Spain. Its year-on-year development was positive, increasing by 5.46 %. The activities that account for over 2 % of registrations in the autonomous community are: building and gardening services; security and investigation activities; storage and transport support activities; administrative office work and other business support activities; cinematographic, video and television programme work, sound recording and music publishing activities; specialised construction activities; employment-related activities; building construction; activities of households as employers of domestic staff; activities of travel agencies, tour operators, reservation services and related activities; sale and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; real estate activities; insurance, reinsurance and pension funds, except compulsory social security; decontamination activities and other waste management services.\n\nAccording to the LFS, Madrid’s workforce (active population) totalled 3 608 200, in the fourth quarter of 2022, this figure breaks down into 3 193 000 employed and 415 200 unemployed. Compared with the same quarter of the previous year, the active population increased by 2.13 % and numbers of unemployed by 16.15 %, while the employed grew by 0.55 %. The unemployment situation is proportionately less serious in the Community of Madrid than in the rest of Spain as the unemployment rate (11.51 %) is below the national average, while the employment rate (55.93 %) is above the average. The breakdown of the occupied population by economic sector confirms the predominance of the services sector, accounting for 84.38 % of Madrid’s population in work, followed by industry (9.42 %) and construction (5.79 %). While services account for most of the population in work, it is also the sector with the greatest number of unemployed persons.\n\nAccording to information from the Madrid SEPE Occupations Observatory, the number of unemployed persons fell by 18.57 % between December 2021 and December 2022. Some 16.20 % of unemployed jobseekers in Madrid are non-nationals. A total of 59.32 % of unemployed persons in the autonomous community are women; 32.18 % are older than 55. Recruitment in 2022 increased by 2.27 % compared with the previous year. Some 22.89 % of the contracts were awarded to foreign workers.\n\nAll sectors have seen a decline in hiring, except for the services sector. The following activities represent more than 2 % and exceed the provincial increase: retail trade, except motor vehicles and motorcycles, wholesale trade and intermediaries, except motor vehicles and motorcycles; land and pipeline transport; advertising and market research; sports, recreation and entertainment activities.\n\nSPANISH PUBLIC STATE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE\n\nwww.sepe.es\n\nMINISTRY OF LABOUR AND SOCIAL ECONOMY\n\nwww.mites.gob.es\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY CENTRAL TREASURY\n\nwww.seg-social.es\n\nSPANISH NATIONAL STATISTICS INSTITUTE\n\nwww.ine.es\n\nMurcia is situated in the south-east of the Iberian peninsula between Andalusia and Valencia and between the Mediterranean coast and Castile-La Mancha. It covers 11 314 km2 and has a population density of 135.40 inhabitants/km2. On 1 January 2022, the population was 1 531 878, a year-on-year increase of 0.88 %. Men account for 50.10 % of the total. Of the total population, 13.63 % were non-nationals, which was 2.00 % more than in 2021, and the sixth highest percentage in Spain. The main countries of origin were Morocco, Ecuador, the United Kingdom, Romania, Colombia, Bolivia, Ukraine, Bolivia, Bulgaria and China.\n\nThe economy of the Region of Murcia grew by 4.9 % in 2022 (5.5 % for Spain), maintaining the growth started in 2021.The effects of the pandemic have disappeared. However, the war in Ukraine is currently driving a rise in prices, which is affecting all sectors, and GDP to a lesser extent. By 2023, the region is expected to see the lowest increase in the country, 1 %, although it is supposed to reach 2.4 % by 2024. Agriculture and livestock farming – the latter to a greater extent – are performing favourably, although drought and inflation are clear threats. The food industry is performing well in terms of turnover and exports. In the rest of industry, the performance is favourable in beverage manufacturing, the leather and footwear industry, the wood and cork industry, and electrical energy supply, while the chemical and metal industries are worse. The upturn in construction – both in housing and public works – continues. In services, tourism and transport in particular are recovering, while trade continues to lag behind.\n\nThe Region of Murcia was home to 44 387 companies in 2022, giving a year-on-year increase of 1.80 %, although in recent years the number has been decreasing. Some 98.33 % of companies have fewer than 50 workers and 80.57 % have no more than five. The most important companies are El Pozo, Hero, J. García Carrión, Alimer and Estrella de Levante in the food industry; Repsol, SABIC and Iberdrola in chemicals and energy; Hefame in pharmaceuticals; Navantia in shipbuilding; Ferrovial in civil engineering works; PC Componentes in the components trade, and Primafrio in transport and logistics. Cooperativism is more active in the Region of Murcia than the Spanish average, and Murcia is ranked first for the number of cooperatives per inhabitant; by 2023, 130 cooperatives are expected to be created, which would generate 280 jobs. The biggest cooperatives are in agriculture, trade, hotels and catering, education and health. The industrial sector is growing in terms of cooperatives.\n\nThe number of workers paying social security contributions in December 2022 was 627 012, a year-on-year increase of 4.3 %. Some 69.68 % are registered under the General Scheme and the self-employed account for 16.46 %. The following activities have the highest numbers of workers paying social security contributions: agriculture, trade, food and beverage services, health, education, food industry, specialised construction activities, public administration and road transport.\n\nAccording to the figures provided by the National Statistics Institute’s labour force survey, in the fourth quarter of 2022 in Murcia there were 754 500 economically active persons, of whom 657 200 were employed and 97 300 were unemployed. The economic activity rate reached 59.99 % while the unemployment rate stood at 12.89 % – below the Spanish average of 13.33 % – and was higher for women than men. There was a slight year-on-year increase of 0.62 % in the number of unemployed persons and employed persons increased by 0.83 %. Employment increased in agriculture and services, but fell in industry and construction. The unemployment rate increased among men and decreased among women, and rose significantly among the under 25s, which reached 32.02 %, slightly higher than the national average.\n\nAccording to information from the Observatory for occupations in the state public employment service (SEPE), in December 2022 there were 89 962 unemployed persons registered at the employment offices, accounting for 3.17 % of the total nationwide. Of these, 61.90 % were women. Approximately 17.7 % were under the age of 30, while more than 52.7 % were aged over 45. Some 12.24 % were non-nationals and 42.84 % had been unemployed for more than a year. Compared to December 2021, registered unemployment decreased by 2.66 %, to below pre-pandemic levels. Contracts registered in 2021 (766 831) decreased by 20.88 % year on year, as temporary contracts were reduced as part of the labour reform. This boosted permanent contracts, which rose by 263.20 %, and the stability rate reached 44.39 %. Only 36.26 % of contracts were awarded to women, and 42.31 % were awarded to non-nationals, the second highest percentage in Spain.\n\nThe economic activities with a significant relative weight showing the highest year-on-year growth in hiring in 2022 are: employment-related activities, accommodation services, residential care, public administration and defence, compulsory social security, creative, artistic and entertainment activities, building services and gardening activities, social work activities without accommodation, and sale and repair of motor vehicles and motorbikes.\n\nSimilarly, the economic activities with the best employment prospects according to quantitative forecasts for the number of hirings and qualitative predictions are agriculture and livestock farming; the food industry; renewable energy (especially photovoltaic energy); and repair and installation of machinery and equipment. In construction, the same is true of building renovation and energy efficiency improvements. IT programming and consultancy; education, health, wholesale and retail trade, administrative activities, logistics and transport, building and gardening services, business consultancy, architectural and engineering technical services.\n\nSPANISH PUBLIC STATE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE\n\nwww.sepe.es\n\nSPANISH NATIONAL STATISTICS INSTITUTE\n\nwww.ine.es\n\nMINISTRY OF LABOUR AND SOCIAL ECONOMY\n\nwww.mites.gob.es\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY CENTRAL TREASURY\n\nwww.seg-social.es\n\nMURCIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL\n\nwww.cesmurcia.es\n\nMURCIA BUSINESS CONFEDERATION (CROEM)\n\nhttps://croem.es/\n\nMURCIA DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE\n\nwww.institutofomentomurcia.es\n\nMURCIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, INDUSTRY AND NAVIGATION\n\nwww.camaramurcia.es\n\nMURCIA COOPERATIVE UNION (UCOMUR)\n\nhttps://ucomur.org/\n\nFUNDACIÓN DE LAS CAJAS DE AHORROS (SAVINGS BANK FOUNDATION)\n\nwww.funcas.ceca.es\n\nThe Autonomous Community of Navarre is situated in the north of Spain, in the westernmost part of the Pyrenees, and covers a total of 10 391.08 km². The population data recorded by the definitive census on 1 January 2022 was 664 117 people. This figure represents an increase of 0.39 % over the previous year, following the same trend as the population of the whole of Spain, which increased by 0.19 %. The gender distribution is effectively balanced, with 335 497 males (50.52 %) and 328 620 females (49.48 %).\n\n73 475 foreign residents make up 11.06 % of Navarre’s total population. 27.05 % come from member states of the European Union and 72.95 % are from other non-member states. By gender, 50.48 % of the foreign population is male (37 089 persons) and 49.52 % female (36 386 persons).\n\nAccording to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), the economic activity rate in Navarre in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 59.33 %. The rate was 64.12 % for men and 54.70 % for women. The employed population was 293 100, 1.81 % more than the previous year, but was 0.17 % higher if we consider the figures for the third quarter of 2022. By gender, 53.39 % of the employed population are men and 46.61 % are women, representing a year-on-year increase of 4.19 % for men and a decrease of 0.87 % for women. The unemployment rate, which stood at 10.09 %, increased by 1.61 % compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. By gender, the unemployment rate was 9.66 % for men and 10.58 % for women. The number of unemployed persons was 32 900, 1 100 up on the previous year (3.46 %).\n\nAt the end of December 2022 there were 296 178 workers in Navarre paying social security contributions, marking a year-on-year increase of 3.13 %. Economic activity sections with significant numbers of registrations included Manufacturing industry; Wholesale and retail trade; Repair of motor vehicles and motorbikes; and Health and social services activities. These sectors accounted for 46.07 % of the total number of registrations in the community.\n\nThere were 45 738 active companies in Navarre, according to the most recent update of the Central Directory of Companies (DIRCE). This marks a 3.17 % drop compared to the previous year’s figure. 57.93 % of the companies have no employees. Companies employing between 1 and 5 workers account for 33.17 % of the total, 7.89 % have between 6 and 49 workers, and 1.01 % employ 50 or more. The companies with the highest turnover in Navarre are Volkswagen Navarra; Siemens Gamesa; Nordex Energy; Grupo A.N.S.C.; UVESA; Laboratorios Cinfa and Ultracongelados Virto, among others.\n\nWith regard to employment contracts, the number of contracts registered in Navarre during 2022 amounted to 334 321, which represents a decrease of 7.73 % compared to the previous year. Of these contracts, 20.42 % were entered into with non-nationals during this most recent period.\n\nIn this regard, the adoption of Royal Decree-Law 32/2021, of 28 December, on urgent measures for labour reform, ensuring job stability and the transformation of the labour market, has had an impact on recruitment arrangements, creating and expanding some and abolishing others. The increase in permanent recruitment is 194.81 % (347.92 % for ordinary permanent contracts). However, temporary recruitment fell by 22.62 %, showing a reversal in the recruitment pattern.\n\nThe stability rate in 2022 represents a break and a turning point in the historical series. A rise of 6.85 % to 21.88 % set a new trend mainly due to the change in the regulatory framework.\n\nAccording to information from the Observatory for occupations in the state public employment service (SEPE), on 31 December 2022, 31 610 unemployed persons were registered with the employment offices in Navarre: 1.30 % fewer than in December 2021.
