        "text": "The UD Almería 'B' vs CD Atlético Melilla match will be played at the Anexo Power Horse Stadium at 5pm this Wednesday. While the UD Almería 'B' boys have already secured their presence in the promotion play-offs, on the other hand, CD Atlético Melilla have already been mathematically relegated to a lower tier.\n\nFor UD Almería 'B', this match represents an opportunity to get up the table and reach the decisive fixtures in a good position. With its sights set on that clear objective, the team led by Alberto Lasarte will go all out to add three points that boost their morale and confidence for the next matches.\n\nOn the other hand, CD Atlético Melilla face this encounter with the intention of making a good impression in one of their last games of the season in this division. Despite having been relegated, the Melilla-based side will surely make it very difficult for the youthful Rojiblancos.\n\nWith both teams having different motivations, a highly competitive match is expected in which UD Almería 'B' will try to impose their game to claim a victory that will allow them to continue climbing positions in the table."
