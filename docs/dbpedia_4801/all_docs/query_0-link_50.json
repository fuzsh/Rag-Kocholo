        "text": "Why Iâ€™m hoping that the 2019/20 season can be Spurs youngster Anthony Georgiouâ€™s breakthrough season at the Lilywhites:\n\nNow a fully fledged member of the Cyprus national team at the age of just 22, Spurs youngster Anthony Michael Georgiou has achieved a lot in his short career. Ever since I first saw the Lewisham born winger at the Milk cup in 2012 in County Derry (Castlerock) Iâ€™ve always been a massive fan, and it is somewhat appropriate that I am currently writing this piece in the place where I first saw Anthony play all those years ago. Almost seven years on from being a member of the Spurs side which competed at that tournament, Anthony is one of the few players remaining at Spurs who competed in that competition. The Cypriot international has overcome two frustrating injuries including one which almost kept him out for the whole of the 2016/17 season. Anthony also missed the opportunity to play in an FA youth cup semifinal due to a burst appendix. A semifinal for which he helped Spurs to reach. Georgiou is a pacy wide man who is direct and forward thinking. Georgiou can also fill in at left back where he has played at on several occasions over the last couple of seasons. He is versatile and I do believe that he could go onto follow Danny Roseâ€™s path into the first team by transitioning into a top class modern fullback as I alluded to in great detail in a piece in which I wrote about Anthony last summer. The season just gone may not have went as smoothly or as well as the promising young winger would have liked. Carrying on from an impressive 2017/18 season which saw Anthony make his competitive first team debut for Spurs in a UEFA champions league game against APOEL Nicosia. During Georgiouâ€™s first two games of the 2018/19 season he put in two very impressive performances at both left back and on the left wing against Liverpool and West Ham at under 23 level. However, any possible loan moves which may have been in the offing for Anthony that summer failed to come to fruition due to an injury in which the youngster picked up shortly after the Liverpool game. This frustrating injury would keep the former Watford schoolboy out until mid December. It was only then that Anthony got a good run of games under his belt for Wayne Burnettâ€™s development side. Putting in a series of strong and typically direct Bale-esque performances out on the left flank. Anthony impressed against the likes of Wolfsburg II, Norwich City, Athletic Bilbao B and Liverpool. During the Liverpool game Anthony tore the â€˜ Reds â€˜ defence to shreds, and by the end of the game he had two Liverpool players man marking him.\n\nAnthony caught the eye of Spanish side Levante who he joined on loan the following month. Although he would only play for Levanteâ€™s B team who ply their trade in the third tier of Spanish football, the loan move which was Anthonyâ€™s first, would have been an eye opener for the youngster who impressed on every occasion that I saw him play for the â€˜ Granotas â€˜. Thatâ€™s why I was puzzled as to why he was constantly being subbed so early on in games for Luis Tevenetâ€™s side. Georgiou returned to London before linking up with the Cyprus national team. He won two more caps for them, playing in Euro 2020 qualifiers against Scotland and Russia. During the Scotland game Anthony set up Cyprusâ€™ only goal of the game. In the following piece I will be going into great detail on Anthonyâ€™s style of play and why I believe that the 2019/20 campaign could be his breakthrough season at Spurs. Anthony is in many ways a traditional left winger. He loves to run at defences and beat players, he is confident and direct, he takes risks but he is extremely unselfish. With blistering pace and good skill about him, Georgiou is a flair player to a certain extent. Some of his standout qualities include his extremely high work rate, and his ability to track back for the full 90 minutes of a game. He also has excellent off the ball movement and he is an intelligent player who reads the game well and has a wealth of footballing knowledge and good vision. Furthermore Georgiou is a good tackler which along with his pace makes him well suited to playing at left back. He is also good at creating space for himself and at whipping in high quality crosses. From that brief summary of Anthonyâ€™s style of play you get a feel for what type of player he is and what his qualities as a winger are. Having now mastered under 23 football Georgiou is still relatively untested at senior level. However, when I look at Spursâ€™ first team particularly at the depth of our squad we have very few impact players to bring off the bench in games that arenâ€™t going our way. With the exception of both Erik Lamela and Lucas Moura, Georgiou is very much an impact player who offers pace, skill and intensity to games. He also thrives under pressure.\n\nA championship loan this season or an EFL loan could well massively help Anthonyâ€™s development as a player. However, Iâ€™d love to see this exciting and persistent young talent get a run of games for Spursâ€™ first team. Having been on the previous two pre-season tours, Anthony will be hoping to feature for Mauricio Pochettinoâ€™s first team during this pre-season, with five games to look forward to. The experience of his loan to Levante as well as the invaluable experience of getting to play for the Cyprus national team will have helped Georgiou loads. There are two players who I would like to compare Georgiou to, one is of a similar age to Anthony while the other is 30 years of age. Those players are recent Manchester United signing Daniel James and Stoke City and Republic of Ireland international James McClean. James is a player who played a full season of football for the Swansea City in the Championship last season. He is a remarkably similar player to Georgiou in the sense that he is like a young Gareth Bale. Frighteningly quick, skilful and good at tracking back I believe with a full season of Championship football under his belt that Georgiou could emulate what the slightly younger Welshman has achieved. In regards to James McClean who I have previously likened Georgiou to, the Irishman is very similar to the Spurs youngster as both a left winger and as a left wing back. Georgiou and McClean are both pacy wide men who have a real talent at crossing a ball. They also have a pile-driver of a left foot and both like to test the keeper with low drilled efforts on goal. Furthermore like McClean, Anthony is defensively very well disciplined and he has a non stop high energy work rate. He is a selfless team player who is constantly looking to link up with other attacking players on the field. Drawing back to my comparisons with James McClean, in my time of watching football the pair of them are amongst the hardest workers Iâ€™ve ever seen. Georgiou is a fitness fanatic who is constantly testing himself both on and off the pitch. He is both determined and resilient, unaffected by his injury setbacks and fully focused on his future in the game.\n\nGeorgiou can be like an Aaron Lennon for Pochettinoâ€™s senior side during the dying moments of difficult games. A speedster who also has a good footballing brain, Anthonyâ€™s list of qualities are endless but it is his adaptability to games which is perhaps his best one. Whenever I have seen Georgiou slot in at left back he has done a sterling job, defensively well disciplined but also not shy to express himself down the left flank. There is a nice balance to the ever improving 22 year olds game. And it is that balance and versatility as well as a desire to make an impact on games which, will take Anthony a long, long way in the game. The youngster who was released by Watford as a schoolboy could in my opinion become a Gareth Bale like player for Pochettinoâ€™s Spurs in the future and I could really see the 2019/20 season being a breakthrough season for Georgiou at Spurs, whether that be at the â€˜ Lilywhites â€˜ or on loan at another English club. With his blistering pace and quick feet, he has the ability to terrorise oppositions defences as he has shown on countless occasions over the last couple of seasons for our under 23â€™s. He also has the stamina needed to do that in the Premier League. There are few players as fast as Anthony is on Spursâ€™ books, he really is rapid over 100 metres and it is that type of traditional out and out winger which Spurs have lacked since the great Gareth Bale departed us back in 2013. Georgiou is a relentless presser whose hunger for work is inspiring and I would love more than anything to see him get a run of games for the Spurs first team once the new season has begun. He is a very useful young player who can be brought on as an impact player or as a defender. He is a polite young man whose on the field passion and admirable work rate is something which will appeal to Mauricio Pochettino who is a fan of the 22 year old. Anthony is a credit to Spurs and to the Cyprus national team and the exciting young winger has such a bright future for both Spurs and for his country. I look forward to hopefully seeing our number 42 back in action for the first team during pre-season and I also look forward to seeing what the 2019/20 season has in hold for him and for Spurs. He is an inspiring and tremendously talented young man who could well go onto become like a new signing for Mauricio Pochettinoâ€™s side during the 2019/20 season.\n\nMy interview with former Spurs player Andy Rollock:\n\nI caught up with former Spurs player Andy Rollock today to talk about his time as a youth and reserve team player at the â€˜ Lilywhites â€˜ during the early 1980â€™s. A left sided forward, Rollock would go onto become a prolific scorer for Spurs at youth team and reserve level and he would also feature for England at schoolboy level. Andy kindly agreed to doing an interview with me about his time at the world famous Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nWhat are your earliest footballing memories?\n\nAndy: Probably starting about under 10â€™s I started playing for a team called Craig Park and then I went to play for another team about 11 or 12 in the local league. I then went to play for Eversley, managed by Don Ball who was a great influence on my football career. From there I got scouted to go to quite a few clubs, so at one point I was at Tottenham, QPR and Fulham training pretty much everyday of the week.\n\nWhat are your earliest memories of your time at Spurs and how did you come about joining the club?\n\nAndy: My earliest memory is probably training on a Tuesday and Thursday night at White Hart Lane. They had two gyms there, one was a smaller gym downstairs and the other was a big gym upstairs. Youâ€™d start off in the little gym and then once you got older and better you sort of progressed up to the top floor gym which was the bigger one. I got to join Spurs by being scouted through my Sunday club by Bill Nicholson who was the chief scout at Tottenham at the time, and he scouted me and took me to Spurs. He used to pick me up from school on a Tuesday and a Thursday and take me down to training.\n\nWhat was the great Bill Nicholson like?\n\nAndy: Bill Nicholson was unbelievable, youâ€™d never think that he had been the manager whoâ€™d won the league and the cup for Tottenham and done the double. He was really down to earth and a really decent man and to be honest with you if it wasnâ€™t for Bill I probably wouldnâ€™t have gone to Spurs, but he had a lot of faith in me and made me join the club even though there were other clubs that wanted to sign me. Bill was like a father figure really and he pushed me to go to Tottenham which is where I ended up.\n\nWhat was your time at the Lilywhites like on the whole?\n\nAndy: I canâ€™t say it was a bad experience because it was probably one of the best experiences of my life. Thereâ€™s not many kids that get to sign for a club like Tottenham and Iâ€™d been there since I was 12 so I was lucky.\n\nDid you have any footballing heroes/inspirations and if so who were they?\n\nAndy: I think at Spurs Iâ€™d say Glen Hoddle because he was just an unbelievable player to watch, and to play with him was just second to none really. Also Garth Crooks was somebody who I spent quite a bit of time with and heâ€™d give hints and tips, so I looked up to both Glen and Garth Crooks as well.\n\nCould you describe to me what type of player you were and what positions you played in for Spurs during your time there?\n\nAndy: I was a forward and I used to play on the left wing, I was pretty quick back in the day and I always had an eye for goal, and I used to score quite a few goals. That was the only position I ever played for Tottenham.\n\nWhat was it like to brush shoulders with some of the legendary players that were around at Spurs at the time?\n\nAndy: It was an unbelievable experience, at the time you donâ€™t realise it but as you get older and move on through the game you realise that youâ€™ve rubbed shoulders with some of the greats, such as Glen Hoddle, Garth Crooks, Steve Archibald and Ricky Villa and Ossie Ardiles, two players who had just won the World Cup. However, back then they were just two players at Tottenham but when you look back now and look at the things that theyâ€™ve done in the game you think to yourself that youâ€™ve been in the presence of two legends.\n\nWho were your greatest influences at Spurs?\n\nAndy: Iâ€™d say Bill Nicholson because he always had faith in me, and Iâ€™d also say youth team coach Peter Shreeves because he always used to look out for me and give me some hints and tips, and he used to try to drive me forward.\n\nWere there any players at Spurs who you would watch closely to try and improve your game or look to learn from?\n\nAndy: Yeah Iâ€™d say obviously Glen Hoddle and Ricky Villa who used to play in a similar position to me. So I would watch him in training and I was lucky enough to train with him as well. Iâ€™d also say Garth Crooks as well because he was a natural finisher so as far as finishing was concerned I used to learn quite a lot from Garth, so Iâ€™d say them two.\n\nCould you talk me through some of your favourite memories of your time at Spurs or ones which particularly standout within your memory?\n\nAndy: Iâ€™d say probably the night they won the FA cup against Manchester City, weâ€™d been to Wembley on the Saturday and seen them draw and then weâ€™d seen them on the Wednesday night at Wembley, where Ricky Villa scored a wonder goal. So that was a great memory for me. Personal memory for me was coming off the subs bench against Charlton, I think there was 20 minutes to go and we were losing 2-0, and I scored a hat trick and we won the game so personally that was a good memory for me. Another one was actually training with the first team a couple of times, being on the same pitch as some of the other guys who Iâ€™d mentioned before was really special.\n\nWhat was the greatest moment of your footballing career?\n\nAndy: Iâ€™d say when I played for England schoolboys at Wembley against Germany. That game was televised and I scored a goal that day at Wembley, so for me thatâ€™s probably the greatest memory for me.\n\nWho was the greatest player that you had the pleasure of sharing a pitch with?\n\nAndy: Thereâ€™s been a few but I would say just for his pure goalscoring ability it was Terry Gibson. He was an absolute goal machine and I was lucky enough to play with him both in the youth team and the reserves and he was probably one of the best players I ever played with on a pitch to be honest.\n\nCould you talk me through some of your favourite memories of your time in the Tottenham youth team?\n\nAndy: I think the year that we got into the FA youth cup final against West Ham where we played the first leg at Upton Park and the second leg at Tottenham which we won, so I got an FA youth cup medal which was the highlight for me. And also playing at Old Trafford in the FA youth cup against Manchester United was another one and I can still remember it vividly. Iâ€™ve played at Wembley three times, but you walk out at Old Trafford and to be fair itâ€™s just something special, itâ€™s an unbelievable stadium.\n\nWhat prompted you to leave Spurs and could you talk me through your career after you left the Lilywhites?\n\nAndy: Spurs offered me a contract to stay on for a year but I turned it down because I wanted a better contract. I then went to Arsenal for six months and played in their youth team and reserve team but I left them after about six months. After leaving Arsenal I went to Wolves before playing out in Finland for a year and a bit. I then went into non league football where I kind of dropped out of the professional game and I played for Enfield Town and Walthamstow Avenue and I did the non league circuit to be honest.\n\nWho was the toughest player that you ever came up against?\n\nAndy: I would say thereâ€™s two players, Nigel Winterburn when he was at Wimbledon and a lad called Keith Stevens who was at Millwall. They were two tough fullbacks who I didnâ€™t get a lot of change out of!\n\nWere there any players at Spurs who you were particularly close to?\n\nAndy: I was close with Allan Cockram and we kind of went through the ranks together and itâ€™s a shame that we lost contact. There was also another lad from Enfield called Steve Cox who I was pretty close with, we used to go to training together because we lived literally round the corner from each other, so I would say that Allan and Steve were the two players who I was closest to at Spurs.\n\nWhat would your advice be to the young Spurs players of today as they look to break into the first team?\n\nAndy: I would say to them to not take it for granted and to listen to every piece of advice that they are given from coaches and senior players in the game. What got me is that I wanted it too soon and too quick, I thought that I should have been in the first team when I was competing with players who were World Cup winners! Players should believe in their talent but they must listen to people because if you push yourself too far the chances are that youâ€™re going to end up out of the game.\n\nAfter all these years how do you look back on your time at the Lilywhites and is Spurs a club who you still hold close to your heart?\n\nAndy: Yeah definitely even though Iâ€™m not a Spurs supporter but I do hold the club in high esteem, and theyâ€™ll always have a piece of my heart. Iâ€™m actually proud to say that I played for Tottenham because back then they were one of the big clubs in English football and they are still a big club. So Iâ€™m extremely proud that I was able to represent the club and be a part of their history.\n\nMy interview with former Spurs player Glen Alzapiedi:\n\nIn the latest in my series of interviews with former Spurs youth team players from the 1980â€™s I caught up with tough tackling midfielder Glen Alzapiedi, to talk about his time as a youth player at Spurs during the late 1970â€™s and early 1980â€™s. Alzapiedi who is now the assistant manager at St Albans, played in a richly talented Spurs youth team before going onto depart for Birmingham City and later Stevenage amongst other clubs, after doing the knowledge and becoming a London black taxi driver. Alzapieidi would also turn his hand to coaching where he coached the likes of Ware Town and Concord Rangers. I had the great pleasure of talking to Glen about his time at the â€˜ Lilywhites â€˜ more than 40 years ago. Glen (pictured in the centre above) might just be the only ever Spurs player to wear an Arsenal shirt to training!\n\nWhat are your earliest memories of your time at Spurs?\n\nGlen: The earliest memories Iâ€™ve got are getting an invite to go up to Tottenham to train. Iâ€™d been playing for Abbey youth under 12â€™s and Mike Varney (the Spurs physio) did a presentation evening for us and I suppose I got recommended to him, and that set the wheels in motion. So thatâ€™s how I got to train at Tottenham.\n\nHow did you come about joining the club?\n\nGlen: Well the previous answer sort of tells that. I got the invite to go and train at Spurs and I must of impressed during the training and in the games that I played, so I got invited to train there every Tuesday and Thursday I think it was.\n\nWhat was your time at the Lilywhites like on the whole?\n\nGlen: The first couple of seasons I was there I think I did quite well although I did spend practically a whole season out injured around the age of 14 going onto 15. Then the last season I was there I played a lot of football but ultimately I got released, so most of the time there was good.\n\nDid you have any footballing heroes/inspirations and if so who were they?\n\nGlen: My favourite player was Liam Brady who was at Arsenal so there werenâ€™t any Tottenham players Iâ€™m afraid!\n\nCould you describe to me what type of player you were and what positions you played in for Spurs during your time there?\n\nGlen: I was a central midfield player who was very tenacious and an aggressive tackler and in all honesty that was my main strength. I was reasonably good at everything else but my outstanding strength was obviously my tackling.\n\nWhat was it like to brush shoulders with some of the legendary players that were around at Spurs at the time?\n\nGlen: I only ever had contact with first team players at Tottenham once and that was in pre-season just before I turned 16 in 1980. I went in for two or three weeks during the summer holidays and trained and I remember the warm up was with the first team players. I can remember Glen Hoddle and I can also remember Terry Naylor as well as Chris Hughton and Graham Roberts. I had contact with Roberts once or twice because I had an injury playing for my school and I was treated by Mike Varney, and Graham was getting treated at the same time as me. I can also remember Terry Yorath saying to me who are you and I replied with my name and then he said again who are you, rather flippantly for a 15 year old boy. But like I said I was an Arsenal fan so I wasnâ€™t star struck by Tottenham players.\n\nWho were your greatest influences at Spurs?\n\nGlen: Well to be honest with you I thought that I was really treated well at Tottenham by the coaches there such as Robbie Stepney and Peter Shreeves. And in particular by a coach called Dave Lister who was very supportive of me during a difficult time for me, because I had real problems off the field in my personal life. However, I canâ€™t complain about how I was treated by Tottenham.\n\nWere there any players at Spurs who you would watch closely to try and improve your game or look to learn from?\n\nGlen: Only youth team players really and the players who played in the same position as me who I had contact with were Allan Cockram and Ian Crook. And I can remember Ian Crook used to play a lot of one touch football which impressed me and I tried to improve my game in that way, but they were both very technical players whereas I was a rat who got around the pitch and kicked people. I suppose in terms of who I tried to aspire to be it would have been someone who was an out and out defensive midfield player. There was no one I ever tried to model my game on, I just tried to improve my game and with all the things that were going wrong for me at the time it was difficult.\n\nCould you talk me through some of your favourite memories of your time at Spurs or ones which particularly standout within your memory?\n\nGlen: Well in terms of playing experiences I can remember playing at White Hart Lane in the league cup semi final against Swindon in the second leg. The stadium was empty but it did seem huge and I enjoyed playing there. I can also remember scoring a few goals for Tottenham such as scoring against West Ham that season in a 1-0 win, I think that George Parish was marking me on that day. Most of the time at Tottenham I enjoyed but I practically had a whole season where I was out when I needed to get treatment. And in the last season I had a strong start to the season and a poor second half to the season and ultimately I didnâ€™t get an apprenticeship because of that. Basically what happened during my second last year of school my mum had died at the beginning of the year so by the time I got to my last year at school my life had unravelled. She had been the discipline in the family and held everything together and I subsequently became a bit of a loose cannon at school. I became ill disciplined and that carried over into my football because I became petulant and over aggressive, and although the coaches at Tottenham did their best to try and reign me in and help me, I didnâ€™t listen to anyone at that time. And during the second half of the season things just went from week to week, worse to worse and my attitude was absolutely awful and it cost me an apprenticeship there. So it wasnâ€™t a good time for me in my last year but I canâ€™t blame Tottenham for any of that because they did their best for me. It was purely down to attitude and there have been better players than me who didnâ€™t make it because of poor attitude. So itâ€™s one of those things and I accept that, and itâ€™s not something that I hold any grudges about.\n\nWhat was the greatest moment of your footballing career?\n\nGlen: As a coach the best moment I had was helping Concord Rangers get promoted to the National League South along with Danny Cowley (now of Lincoln), because they were such a small club. Another great moment was getting Ware Town to the first round proper of the FA Cup so that was really good as well. As a player I had a really bittersweet experience at Stevenage Borough where I helped the club get promoted to the national conference. However, I snapped my cruciate ligaments a couple of months before the end of the season and that was that really. I regret not getting the chance to play in the conference for Stevenage because by the time Iâ€™d got to my late 20â€™s my attitude had changed and I had become a much more effective and professional player than I had been throughout my younger years. For three years I didnâ€™t really play because at the age of 19 when I didnâ€™t get a contract anywhere I finished playing for three years and did the knowledge, and it was only friends dragging me back into semi professional football that got me involved and Iâ€™ve been involved ever since as a player, coach and as a manager.\n\nWho was the greatest player that you had the pleasure of sharing a pitch with?\n\nGlen: When I was at Birmingham City as an apprentice I played in training games against the first team. And the first team then had Frankie Worthington and Archie Gemmill playing for them so I would have to say Archie Gemmill who I ended up cleaning his boots. He was an excellent player who really stands out as a star for me.\n\nDid you play abroad at any youth tournaments for Spurs and if so what was that experience like for you?\n\nGlen: No but I can remember playing against foreign teams for Spurs but I canâ€™t remember going abroad with Tottenham.\n\nWho was the toughest player that you ever came up against?\n\nGlen: In all honesty thereâ€™s two and there for totally different reasons. I played for Birmingham Cityâ€™s youth team against Nottingham Forestâ€™s youth team and their player manager at the time was a man called Liam Oâ€™Kane who was an Irish international. I was marking him and I never got a kick because he was playing one touch football all around me all day and I couldnâ€™t get near him even though I was a 17 year old boy full of running and he was well in his 30â€™s. I also played against Paul Allen for Birmingham City when he was at West Ham and I had a bit of a running battle with him. But the hardest player I played against was in non league football and his name was Paul Hobbs and he played for Hemel Hempstead. He was as hard as nails and we just spent the whole game kicking lumps out of each other, but I respected him because he didnâ€™t give me any verbal. So he was my toughest opponent.\n\nWere there any players at Spurs who you were particularly close to?\n\nGlen: Robert Brace was a friend of mine who stayed at Tottenham and got an apprenticeship for them. We were very close and I was also close with Gary Rudkin who joined us from Crystal Palace and he was my best mate but he sadly past away a long while ago, but they were the players who I was closest to.\n\nAs a coach what would your advice be to the young Spurs players of today as they look to break into the first team?\n\nGlen: Work hard, listen to your coaches then go and work even harder!\n\nCould you tell me about the time you wore an Arsenal shirt to training?\n\nGlen: Well when we used to train on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the training ground behind the West stand. I can remember Ron Henry taking training once (the former left back in the double winning season) and I had an Arsenal away shirt on. Ron said to me what are you doing wearing that shirt and I said what do you mean. And he replied by saying you canâ€™t wear this shirt here and I said I can wear it because Iâ€™m an Arsenal fan, anyway he said that I donâ€™t think you should wear it here and I had a big smug grin on my face. However, I cannot remember Ron Henry speaking to me at all after that!\n\nAfter all these years how do you look back on your time at the Lilywhites and is Spurs a club who you still hold close to your heart?\n\nGlen: Like I said I enjoyed most of my time at Tottenham and the fact that I failed to progress there was down to me not them. However, I cannot say that I hold them close to my heart because I am an Arsenal fan but I do have a healthy respect for the achievements of Tottenham and how the present coach is managing them. Any team that gets to the Champions league final is a good team coached by a good manager and I acknowledge that with gritted teeth.\n\nMy end of season player reviews of our under 18 side:\n\nIt is exceptionally difficult to put our under 18â€™s 2018/19 rollercoaster ride of a season into words. It was an incredible season for the wonder boys of Hotspur Way but for one reason or another it ended without them winning any silverware. Playing superb free flowing attacking football, with a high press and intensity about them, under the tutelage first of Matt Wells and then John McDermott and Ryan Mason were, absolutely outstanding as a team. 95% of the teams in which we played, we played them off the park. Such was our excellent fitness levels and high intensity style of play, along with the sheer fluidity of our fast attacking football. Matt Wells deserves great credit for the way in which he managed the boys before departing them in February to link up with former Spurs man Scott Parker at Fulham, before academy chief John McDermott took the reigns along with Ryan Mason for the latter parts of the season. In my eyes the wonder boys of Hotspur Way were the best team in England this season regardless of the fact that we finished four points behind Arsenal in second place in the Premier League South. Although we were ahead of Arsenal for large parts of the season it was our controversial meeting with the â€˜ Gunners â€˜ back in April when we lost 3-2, which effectively ended our title charge. Regardless of what went on at Arsenalâ€™s training centre, the season as a whole has been a roaring success. And the experience for which it has provided for our young developing scholars has been invaluable. I have never seen an under 18 team as good as the class of 2018/19. They were an absolute pleasure to watch and report on. Apart from finishing in second place in the Premier League South, McDermott and Masonâ€™s side reached the quarter finals of the Premier League Cup where they were knocked out by Derby County. They also reached the fourth round of the FA youth cup where once again they were outdone in controversial circumstances by their bitter rivals Arsenal. A number of our under 18â€™s also played in the UEFA youth league. We reached the last 16 of Europeâ€™s most prestigious youth competition.\n\nFrom the goalscoring exploits of Troy Parrott, to the leadership and craft of captain fantastic Armando Shashoua, to the defensive solidity of the likes of Malachi Walcott, Luis Binks and Brooklyn Lyons-Foster. The 2018/19 season is one in which I and many Spurs fans will look back on with great fondness, and from the bottom of my heart I canâ€™t say how very proud I am of our under 18â€™s for all that they have achieved over the course of this long and at times gruelling season. In the following piece I will be going into great detail about each of our under 18â€™s players seasons.\n\nGoalkeepers:\n\nJoshua Oluwayemi: After only playing two games for our under 18â€™s during the 2017/18 season the following season was a breakthrough season for Oluwayemi who, made 21 appearances for our under 18â€™s as he enjoyed an excellent campaign for John McDermott and Ryan Masonâ€™s side. Oluwayemi was a key player for our under 18â€™s and he was one of their most consistent players. The former England under 15 international who is also eligible to represent Nigeria and Grenada was, an extremely reliable presence in between the sticks and it was the sheer consistency of his performances which impressed me the most this season. An excellent shot stopper who made some absolutely outstanding reflex saves throughout the campaign, from the second year scholars 21 competitive appearances for our under 18â€™s he kept an impressive seven clean sheets. Oluwayemi also became somewhat of a penalty saving specialist during the 2018/19 season by keeping out an impressive five penalties last season, something which really saved us in big games. Joshua has made great strides as a player and he has become a lot well rounded as a goalkeeper. Not only is he an excellent shot stopper, despite his relatively short size for a goalkeeper Joshua was authoritative inside his box last season. Claiming almost every ball which came into his box, the 18 year old also impressed me with his distribution and calmness and composure in which he showed, when he had the ball at his feet. Some of Oluwayemiâ€™s games of the season include our 4-0 league defeat of Leicester City in December, our 2-0 Premier League Cup defeat to Derby County where he made a string of impressive saves, a 2-0 league win over Chelsea, and our under 18â€™s infamous 3-2 defeat to Arsenal where he made one of the saves of the season to keep out an excellent strike from Arsenalâ€™s Trae Coyle. Oluwayemi has enjoyed a superb season but, now one of our under 18â€™s most important players will have to adapt to under 23 football next season, that is something which will be a big step up for Oluwayemi as he continues to develop as a goalkeeper.\n\nKacper Kurylowicz: The Luton born Polish youth international was our under 18â€™s second choice goalkeeper this season. Kurylowicz only made three competitive appearances for our under 18â€™s during the 2018/19 season but he did have an interesting season and he impressed when called upon. After spending some of the early parts of the season on loan at Barnetâ€™s youth team, Kurylowicz who was often on the bench for our under 18â€™s during the first part of the season, made his competitive debut for them in a Premier League Cup group stage match against Middlesbrough around Christmas time. After making a number of impressive stops in that 2-2 draw up in County Durham, Kurylowicz would go onto make a further two competitive appearances for our under 18â€™s that season. One of which came as a substitute in a 5-3 league win over West Ham, and our final day 4-3 league defeat to Leicester City in late April. Very much a sweeper keeper who likes to stand on the edge of his penalty area, Kurylowicz is like Oluwayemi in the sense that he is an excellent shot stopper and good all round goalkeeper. The first year scholar also made two appearances (which he impressed in) for our under 19â€™s at the end of the season Terborg tournament. Next season Kurylowicz will likely be our under 18â€™s number one goalkeeper.\n\nDefenders:\n\nMaximus Tainio: The Finland under 19 international made 14 appearances for our under 18â€™s during the 2018/19 campaign. Primarily featuring at right back, the son of our former player Teemu put in some sterling defensive performances in big games including against the likes of Chelsea and West Ham. The Auxerre born defender also showed improvement from last season and he impressed with his reading of games and his anticipation of danger. Tainio also made two appearances for our under 23â€™s and in one of those games he ended up going in goal after goalkeeper Brandon Austin had sustained an injury late on in a game, and Spurs had already used all three of their substitutions. Unfortunately after enjoying a good first half of the season Maximus missed much of the second part of the 2018/19 campaign through injury and he recently had an operation, so hopefully heâ€™ll be fit again for the start of next season where heâ€™ll be competing with Tariq Hinds and Jubril Okedina for a right back spot in our under 23â€™s. However, the versatile former HJK Helsinki schoolboy can also fill in at CDM if required. I like Tainioâ€™s aggression and commitment on the field and I was impressed with how he played during the 2018/19 season.\n\nJubril Okedina: Tainioâ€™s injury problems opened the door to the under 18 side to a player who had had his own injury problems the previous season. Centre half Jubril Okedina only made two appearances for our under 18â€™s during the 2017/18 season and after not starting the campaign as a regular for Matt Wellsâ€™ side, Tainioâ€™s early injury problems meant that the RCB got given the opportunity to fill in for the Finn at right back. And Okedina did an absolutely outstanding job in Tainioâ€™s absence, really making that right back spot his own the South London born defender made 21 competitive appearances for our under 18â€™s this season, most of which he played in as a right back. Okedina who is of Nigerian descent impressed greatly with his tight defending and solidity down the right flank. Good at locking in wingers and marking players out of the game. The second year scholar who also featured on one occasion for both our under 19â€™s and 23â€™s is a player who loves to be on the ball. And it is his comfortableness on the ball and his ability to turn at pace which has helped him to excel at right back for our under 18â€™s. The Greenwich born defender has been consistently excellent for the under 18â€™s this season and it has been the quality of his performances as well as the guile for which he has shown while operating at both fullback and centre half which has made him so effective. A calming presence in the side, Okedina is a very well rounded defender who has good pace and skill. However, he is a highly intelligent defender who isnâ€™t rash in the challenge and he doesnâ€™t panic when he is under pressure. What I like about Jubril is that he is a very skilful player who is comfortable at bringing the ball out from the back, but most of all he is an excellent defender. After enjoying a fine season on the domestic stage in his newfound position of right back. Okedina also performed well at the recent Terborg tournament in the Netherlands where he played all five games at right back. Next season Jubril will be hoping to become the first choice right back for our under 23â€™s however, his versatility will stand him in good stead over the course of the campaign.\n\nDennis Cirkin: One of our under 18â€™s best players this season has been Dublin born left back Dennis Cirkin. A wonderfully talented attacking fullback who loves to embark on jinking forward runs down the left flank. Cirkin was a mainstay in our under 18 side last season while in his first year of scholarship and the England under 17 international was consistently excellent for McDermott and Masonâ€™s side. Young Dennis is a combative left back who gets up and down the flank excellently well. Cirkin is a young player who is constantly improving at left back, the former left winger was a mainstay in our title challenging under 18 side this season, and the quality of his performances have been just as good as anybody elseâ€™s. Putting in a string of superb performances against the likes of Leicester City, Fulham, Arsenal, Chelsea and Barcelona across the various age levels this campaign. Cirkin made 19 appearances for our under 18â€™s, four for our under 19â€™s and a further six for our under 23â€™s, he also featured at two post season tournaments (the Future Cup and the Terborg tournament) as well as being a member of the under 17 side which won the Euro Youth Cup in Germany at the beginning of the campaign. A skilful player who likes to take players on, Cirkin is also a very aggressive and tough tackling defender who is assertive and committed in his defending. Physically adept at playing under 23 football Cirkin has looked very good whenever he has made that step up this season, and the same can be said about his performances in the UEFA Youth League for our under 19â€™s. Cirkin has enjoyed an excellent season as a first year scholar and due to a lack of competition for the left back spot I could see him establishing himself as our under 23â€™s main left back for the 2019/20 season.\n\nMalachi Walcott: A tall and skilful centre half who is excellent at making last ditch challenges and blocks. England under 17 international Malachi Walcott who featured for the Three Lions at the European under 17 championships in Ireland this year, has been an important player for our under 18â€™s over the course of the campaign. Walcott featured on 16 occasions for our under 18â€™s last season and him and Luis Binks would often form a strong partnership in central defence. Walcott also featured on two occasions for our under 23â€™s, and on three occasions for our under 19â€™s. It has been a very positive campaign for the centre half despite having a couple of injury problems throughout the season. Solid and consistent whenever he was called upon, the 17 year old first year scholar who chipped in with one goal has been an extremely reliable player for McDermottâ€™s and Masonâ€™s side. Making many an important block, last ditch challenge and clearance over the course of the campaign. Walcott is also very good in the air and like Lyons-Foster and Binks he manages to maintain impeccable positioning throughout games. Some of the first year scholars best game this season came against the likes of Chelsea, PSV, Crawley Town and Arsenal. Next season I would imagine that Walcott would play quite a few more games for the under 23â€™s. Malachi was a member of the 17 sides which competed in the Future Cup and the Euro Youth Cup.\n\nMaxwell Statham: After enjoying an excellent pre-season with our development squad where the commanding centre half impressed greatly away in France at the annual Tournoi Europeen. However, after some injury problems early on in the campaign meant that it was hard for Statham to get himself back into our under 18 side. This meant that he had to show his versatility right from early on in the season, and for much of this campaign Statham has been playing at fullback (both right and left). However, the second year scholar slotted in seamlessly to his new positions and during his 17 appearances for the under 18â€™s he did a sterling job, putting in some excellent performances at both left back and right back, and the son of our former player had definitely improved from last season. One of his best performances came up against tricky Irish winger Shane Flynn when we played Leicester City in a league game back in December. On that day the aggressive Statham marked Flynn out of the game. All in all it has been a very positive season for the Southend born defender who will now be looking to break into the development side for the 2019/20 season. It is worth noting that the 18 year old did spend a short time on a youth loan at Norwich City this season. Statham completed the full 90 minutes for the â€˜ Canaries â€˜ under 23 side of a 4-0 PL2 defeat to Wolves back in February.\n\nLuis Binks: Gillingham born LCB Luis Binks enjoyed a marvellous first year of scholarship at Spurs during the 2018/19 season where he made 21 appearances for our under 18â€™s. Ball playing centre half Binks was one of our under 18â€™s most integral and consistent players and the quality of his defending in big games was unrivalled by anybody else. The son of the legendary former Chatham Town player Tom Binks, has oozed class whenever he has played for Spurs this season. Putting in match winning performances against the likes of Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Fulham and Leicester City to name but a few clubs. Binksâ€™ outstanding anticipation, reading of the game and the commanding nature of his defending has made him one of our under 18â€™s most important players during the title challenging season. Binks who also featured on four occasions for our under 23â€™s, and five for our under 19â€™s was at times unplayable at the back. Mature beyond his years young Binks along with Armando Shashoua and Dilan Markanday was one of our most important players. A member of the Euro youth cup winning side, Binks was a regular for England under 18â€™s, and he also featured for our under 19â€™s at the post season Terborg tournament. With a wand of a left foot and a wonderful understanding of the game, Binksâ€™ consistent performances have greatly impressed me this season and from a physical point of view he could well establish himself as a regular for our under 23â€™s during the 2019/20 campaign. However, he should be very proud of all that he has achieved this season.\n\nBrooklyn Lyons-Foster: Ball playing centre half Brooklyn Lyons-Foster overcame a number of injury problems during the first part of the season to enjoy another season of great personal development. The Islington born defender who also featured at CDM and fullback on a number of occasions throughout the season, divided his time playing under 18 and 23 football. Making 21 appearances for both our under 18â€™s and 19â€™s, Lyons-Foster also made nine appearances for our development side. The second year scholar was a highly influential player for both our under 18â€™s and 23â€™s. The rock solid centre half who chipped in with an impressive three goals and two assists is not too dissimilar to a defender such as Matthijs de Ligt, Lyons-Foster plays the game as if he has been schooled at the Sportpark De Toekomst, such is the way in which he operates as a ball playing centre half. A player who loves to make positive forward passes, Brooklyn is more than just an excellent defender who reads the game so well. He is also very creative from deep and his adventurous surging forward runs make him adept at playing at CDM. The 18 year old is a very mature defender who sees the danger which is in front of him. Commanding, decisive and unfazed by bullish target men despite his slim build, as I wrote last season he is another wonderful young talent. Despite a couple of injury problems throughout the campaign Lyons-Foster managed to make 30 competitive appearances for Spurs across all levels this season and it has meant that he has been able to get a lot of valuable playing time under his belt. Lyons-Foster played a big part in us reaching the last 16 round of the UEFA youth league and whenever he was involved for our under 23â€™s we were statistically a lot better as a team such is the attacking and defensive influence which Brooklyn has on games. Two performances from last season come to mind when I think of Lyons-Fosterâ€™s 2018/19 season. Those were against both West Ham and Barcelona and you can refer back to my match reports from last season to find out why. Next season I would be surprised if the highly promising centre back wasnâ€™t a mainstay in our development squad. Look out for an in-depth piece which I am currently writing on Brooklyn. I recently named him as Spursâ€™ best player at this years recent Terborg tournament in the Netherlands.\n\nMidfielders:\n\nArmando Shashoua: A skilful and ridiculously determined midfield craftsman whose high work rate and on the field intelligence made him our under 18â€™s man to go to last season. Our under 18â€™s captain fantastic operated at both CAM and CM during his 34 competitive appearances for our under 18â€™s, 19â€™s and 23â€™s during the recent season. Shashoua chipped in with an impressive seven goals and 12 assists (a great improvement from last seasons goal involvement tally of three) but they only tell half the story. Captain fantastic literally carried our under 18â€™s at times during the season. Demonstrating great leadership qualities, Armando was the beating heart of John McDermottâ€™s team. Impressing with his passing ability, jinking forward runs, vision and razor sharp movement and ability to get to loose balls in and around the danger zone. Shashoua captained our side in every game that he played in apart from one (our opening day victory over Brighton) and the West Londoner did so with great aplomb on every occasion. So often the man to initiate chances and thwart dangerous attacks, Shashouaâ€™s all round game was on completely another level this season. He could run at full pelt for 90 minutes of a game regardless of the score or how it was going and it was his sheer desire to get on the ball which impressed me so much, amongst other things. Shashoua starred in big games throughout the season and to be quite honest with you he never had a bad game. He was a constant source of encouragement on the field as he gave out instructions and barked out orders. Along with Dilan Markanday he was one of Spursâ€™ most fouled players last season but despite his small stature he was one of the strongest players on the ball in the team. He fought for every ball, tracked back relentlessly after him and he always made himself available to receive the ball as he constantly managed to drop into little pockets of space. Our under 18â€™s captain fantastic showed in his second year of scholarship that he was far, far too good for under 18 football. He had mastered every aspect of it, and his incredible footballing intelligence and guile meant that he always looked so comfortable and adept whenever he made the step up to play for our under 19â€™s and 23â€™s. It really does amaze me that neither England, Spain, Venezuela, America or Egypt havenâ€™t called the technically gifted central midfielder up to represent their youth teams.\n\nHarvey White: Another player who enjoyed a remarkable season was first year scholar Harvey White. The Maidstone born CDM was involved in 21 goals from 33 appearances across all levels for Spurs last season, the now England under 18 international put in many a dominant performance in central midfield for our under 18â€™s, 19â€™s and 23â€™s. White enjoyed an excellent first part of the season for both our under 18â€™s and 19â€™s where he was one of Matt Wellsâ€™ most creative players. During the early parts of the season White was an important part of the Spurs under 17 side which won the Euro youth cup and it was he who netted Spursâ€™ winning goal in the final against Anderlecht. An industrious and hardworking midfielder (formerly an AM) who would also fill in at left back throughout the campaign, White would later go onto cement his place in the development side. The 17 year old who is a set piece specialist, did an excellent job at breaking up play and recycling possession throughout the season, and the excellent passer created many good chances for the forwards in the games that he played in. The well rounded and valiant midfielder enjoyed an excellent season for his club and it was recognised by his country (England) who he won his first competitive caps for at the under 18 Slovakia Cup last month. Next season I would imagine that White would spend the vast majority of his time playing for our development side. He will also be an important player for our under 19â€™s in the UEFA Youth League. Whiteâ€™s performance of the season (in my opinion) came in a league game against Norwich City.\n\nElliot Thorpe: Welsh attacking midfielder Elliot Thorpe made 11 appearances for our under 18â€™s last season, most of which came during the second half of the season. CAM/CM Thorpe who is a technically gifted and skilful midfielder put in some impressive performances for our under 18â€™s in both the hole, and in central midfield. The Cambridgeshire born midfielder who also featured once for our development side put in his best performance of the season in our Premier League Cup game against Swansea City in November which was on his first ever competitive start for our under 18â€™s. Thorpe would go onto score his first goal for our under 18â€™s in a 4-0 home league win over Fulham. Next season the Wales under 19 international who is a wonderful passer of the ball, will be looking to break into Wayne Burnettâ€™s development side.\n\nRafferty Pedder: The first year scholar made only six appearances for our under 18â€™s last season but the Maidstone born midfielder impressed during all six of those games. Pedder, who also featured at the Euro Youth Cup, the Terborg tournament and the Future Cup is a very technical central midfielder/number ten. Pedder is a seriously pacy player who is skilful and intelligent both in and out of possession. Furthermore, one of the youngest of our first year scholars the midfielder has good vision and a good weight of pass. Next season Pedder will be hoping to be a lot more involved with our under 18â€™s. Pedder chipped in with one assist last season.\n\nPhoenix Patterson: The skilful winger started the season well and in good form, and after he put in an excellent performance against Portsmouth on his first ever start for the development side, things were looking up for Patterson. However, a fractured fibula set the former Wycombe Wanderers youth player back. And he had to wait until April before he could make his return. On his return Patterson made four appearances for our under 18â€™s before then going onto feature for our under 19â€™s out in the Netherlands at the annual Terborg tournament. The 18 year old played in a whole variety of positions this season, including CDM, CAM and out in his natural position of LW. The Scotland under 18 international made 22 competitive appearances for Spurs last season, chipping in with three goals and four assists. The second year scholars outstanding performance against Portsmouth in the Checkatrade trophy was his best of the season, and Patterson will be hoping to put in more performances like that when he represents our development side again next season. Phoenix is a sharp and pacy player who has a fantastic understanding of the game for somebody so young.\n\nChay Cooper: The silky attacking midfielder/left winger made ten appearances for our under 18â€™s last season while in his first year of scholarship with the young â€˜ Lilywhites â€˜. The former Southend United schoolboy put in some bright performances last season, and in a variety of positions. Cooper impressed at CM, CAM and in particular out on the left wing where his good spurts of pace, first touch and lovely skill caused problems for teams. Since making his competitive debut for our under 18â€™s in a Premier League Cup game against Wolves in September, Cooper chipped in with three assists. Next season the attacking midfielder will likely get a lot more playing time for our under 18â€™s and he will hopefully feature for our under 19â€™s in Europe. It is worth noting that Cooper scored a stunning goal in the final of this seasons Euro Youth Cup in Germany against Anderlecht, back in the early stages of the season. I am a big fan of the Harlow born player and I have been impressed whenever I have seen him play.\n\nForwards:\n\nMaurizio Pochettino: The technically gifted right winger made 21 appearances for our under 18â€™s and two for our under 23â€™s this season. The gaffers son chipped in with three goals and one assist from those matches and he showed great improvement from the 2017/18 campaign. Pochettino was consistent in his performances and he put in a number of impressive ones over the course of the season. The 18 year old impressed me with his passing/crossing and his close ball control. Next season Pochettino will be hoping to get a good number of games for our under 19â€™s and 23â€™s. He should be proud of all that he has achieved this season.\n\nDilan Markanday: With his many weaving runs and sensational close ball control 17 year old starlet Dilan Markanday was one of the stars of the season for our under 18 side. Chipping in with an impressive 12 goals and six assists from 24 appearances for our under 18â€™s. Markanday also featured on a number of occasions for our under 19â€™s and 23â€™s. The North London winger played in a variety of positions last season but it was out on the right wing where he was most effective. A good reader of the game, Markanday has a sharp footballing brain and his off the ball movement is something to be admired. He is good at creating space for himself down the flanks and the timing of his runs down the channels is quite impressive. As much of a creative force as Dilan is with his darting runs and attacking forays, and good weight of pass Markanday is also a real goal threat. He is particularly dangerous on the edge of the penalty area where he will often look to test the goalkeeper with a curling low effort towards the far corner of the goal. The winger is also very quick to loose balls inside the danger zone and he is often the first to efforts which have been parried by the goalkeeper. While Markanday is a good finisher who scores a good amount of goals per season, he was one of John McDermottâ€™s most influential players during the 2018/19 campaign. Markanday impressed greatly with his skills and mazy driving runs, as well as his tireless tracking back and defensive work (he is an excellent tackler!). Next season Markanday will likely be an important player for our under 23 side out on the right wing.\n\nJeremie Mukendi: The pacy and direct winger started the season well and after finding the back of the net twice in a league game against Southampton in September, things were looking up for Mukendi, who had struggled for game time during the previous season. He made eight appearances in total for Spurs this season, playing eight games for our under 18â€™s and making the bench on one occasion for our under 23â€™s. However, Mukendiâ€™s season sadly came to an end in December after he sustained a season ending injury in a league game against Leicester City.\n\nRayan Clarke: The direct winger had a Keanan Bennetts-esque season as a second year scholar chipping in with eight goals and nine assists from 23 games for our under 18â€™s. Clarke also featured on five occasions for our under 23â€™s and on two for our under 19â€™s. Clarke would often go on long surging runs down the flank before cutting inside and looking to test the goalkeeper with a thumping effort at goal. Clarke had some great games for the young â€˜ Lilywhites â€˜ and he would also go onto fill in at right back and at centre forward on a couple of occasions last season. The positive wide mans best performances of the season came against both Norwich and Leicester. The aim next season for Clarke will be to replicate some of those performances for our under 23â€™s who he has played well for so far whenever he has been selected. Clarke reminds me a lot of Andros Townsend in the way that he operates as a winger and overall I thought that he enjoyed a very positive 2018/19 season.\n\nJâ€™Neil Bennett: Fancy wide man/forward Jâ€™Neil Bennett had a very positive season for Spurs during the 2018/19 campaign, featuring heavily for both our under 18â€™s and 23â€™s the skilful and pacy Bennett had some great games down both the right and left flank. The Zaha-esque former QPR schoolboy scored ten goals and assisted a further seven last season. Difficult to defend against due to his blistering pace and dazzling skill, the first year scholar put in some fantastic performances for both our under 18â€™s and 23â€™s and what I liked about him this season was his unpredictably in games and that he wasnâ€™t afraid to try FIFA Street like skills in big moments in games. Bennett is a hardworking player who tracks back well after him down the flank. As well as featuring for our under 19â€™s in the UEFA youth league the 17 year old also featured at the post season Terborg tournament in the Netherlands.\n\nEnoch Asante: Unfortunately the centre forwards season was plagued by injuries and he only made two competitive for our under 18â€™s during the early parts of the season. Next season Asante will be competing with Kion Etete, Troy Parrott and Tarrell Whittaker for a starting berth in our under 18 side.\n\nTroy Parrott: It has been an excellent season for the highly rated young Irishman, who excelled at under 18 level during the 2018/19 campaign. Tall and physical centre forward Troy Parrott scored an impressive 15 goals for our under 18â€™s from just 12 appearances and he laid off a further six. Parrott has made great strides this season, putting in big performances for both our under 18â€™s and 23â€™s in big games. Not only was he a prolific goalscorer who had a Kane-esque influence on games. Parrott also worked tirelessly for his teammates across the park and it was that sheer grit and determination which really shone through especially when he came up against very physical defenders in games our under 23â€™s. The Dubliner was directly involved in a remarkable 29 goals from 29 games across all levels for Spurs last season and in my opinion he isnâ€™t that far away from playing for the first team! See my in-depth piece on Parrott for a greater understanding of the Irishmanâ€™s style of play and traits.\n\nMy goal of the season: Paris Maghomaâ€™s wonderful solo goal on the opening day of the season has to win it for me. After receiving a pass from Armando Shashoua, Maghoma shimmied his way around two Brighton defenders on the edge of the â€˜ Seagulls â€˜ penalty area before then firing an unstoppable effort into the top right hand corner of the goal.\n\nMy save of the season: Joshua Oluwayemiâ€™s magnificent stop to prevent Arsenalâ€™s Trae Coyle from finding the top left hand corner of the Spurs mans goal after he cut inside from the left flank, in our 3-2 defeat to the â€˜ Gunners â€˜ has to win it. Coyleâ€™s effort couldnâ€™t have been anymore in the top corner of the goal but still Oluwayemi was able to get a hand on it to push it away from danger.\n\nMy game of the season: There were many superb performances over the course of the campaign however, for me, my game/performance of the season came when we faced Chelsea in game week three of the league season. On that day Matt Wellsâ€™ side were simply flawless from the back four right up to the makeshift centre forward Jâ€™Neil Bennett who ran the Chelsea defence ragged. We defended imperiously and played some beautiful attacking football in a game that we won 2-0 against a strong Chelsea side.\n\nMy under 18â€™s player of the season: Our under 18â€™s captain fantastic Armando Shashoua was in my opinion our best and most influential player last season. The beating heart of the side, Shashoua led by example in every game that he played in. Furthermore, the Londoner was one of our most creative players but his goal involvement tally of 19 tells only half the story. For it was the skilful midfielders sheer desire to influence games and initiate chances which for me put him head and shoulders above anyone else in the team. He is one of my favourite ever youth players and I have no doubts at all that he has all it takes to become a premier league footballer in the future.\n\nSpurs under 18â€™s statistics 2018/19:\n\nGoals scored: Troy Parrott â€“ 15\n\nDilan Markanday â€“ 12\n\nJâ€™Neil Bennett â€“ 10\n\nRayan Clarke â€“ 8\n\nArmando Shashoua â€“ 7\n\nRodel Richards â€“ 7\n\nHarvey White â€“ 6\n\nParis Maghoma â€“ 4\n\nLuis Binks â€“ 3\n\nMaurizio Pochettino â€“ 3\n\nDennis Cirkin â€“ 2\n\nJeremie Mukendi â€“ 2\n\nBrooklyn Lyons-Foster â€“ 2\n\nPhoenix Patterson â€“ 2\n\nKion Etete â€“ 2\n\nJubril Okedina â€“ 1\n\nTarrell Whittaker â€“ 1\n\nElliot Thorpe â€“ 1\n\nAssists: Harvey White â€“ 12\n\nArmando Shashoua â€“ 12\n\nRayan Clarke â€“ 9\n\nTroy Parrott â€“ 6\n\nDilan Markanday â€“ 6\n\nJamie Bowden â€“ 5\n\nPhoenix Patterson â€“ 4\n\nJâ€™Neil Bennett â€“ 4\n\nRodel Richards â€“ 3\n\nChay Cooper â€“ 3\n\nParis Maghoma â€“ 3\n\nBrooklyn Lyons-Foster â€“ 2\n\nDennis Cirkin â€“ 2\n\nLuis Binks â€“ 2\n\nElliot Thorpe â€“ 2\n\nMalachi Walcott â€“ 2\n\nMaurizio Pochettino â€“ 1\n\nRafferty Pedder â€“ 1\n\nMaxwell Statham â€“ 1\n\nJeremie Mukendi â€“ 1\n\nNile John â€“ 1\n\nKion Etete â€“ 1\n\nTarrell Whittaker â€“ 1\n\nOliver Skipp â€“ 1\n\nMichael Craig â€“ 1\n\nClean sheets: Joshua Oluwayemi â€“ 7\n\nJonathan De Bie â€“ 2"
