        "text": "Telephone area codes for Oakland County, Michigan\n\nArea codes 248 and 947 are area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The area codes also serve portions of Livonia and Northville, both located in Wayne County. The rest of Wayne County, including Detroit, located to the southeast, is serviced by area codes 313 and 734.\n\nArea code 248 was created in 1997 as a split from area code 810. In 2000, area code 947 was assigned as a relief area code for the area.[1] In 2001, it was approved as an all-services overlay plan in the 248 numbering plan area,[2] requiring ten-digit dialing after end of the permissive dialing period, which started on January 26, 2002.\n\nMajor communities serviced include:\n\nMap of Michigan area codes at North American Numbering Plan Administration's website\n\nList of exchanges from AreaCodeDownload.com, 248 Area Code\n\nList of exchanges from AreaCodeDownload.com, 947 Area Code"
