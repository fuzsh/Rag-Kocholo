        "text": "During All Staff Convocation this morning, the Auburn-Washburn School District proudly recognized Linda Pfannenstiel for an extraordinary 50 years of service as a bus driver. Linda began driving for the district in 1974 when her youngest son, Terry, was in kindergarten.\n\nSuperintendent of Schools Dr. Scott McWilliams expressed gratitude for Linda's service, saying, \"For 50 years, Linda has been driving Pauline Central, Pauline South, Washburn Rural Middle School, and Washburn Rural High School students safely to and from school. She knows every twist and turn of every route she travels – many of which are gravel roads – and she has never been at fault for even one minor scratch on any of the buses she has driven.\"\n\nBeing a bus driver is not just a job for Linda – it is a deeper calling to serve her community. She takes extreme pride in her profession and the relationships she has built over time. She not only knows the students on her bus, but she also knows their parents, their grandparents, and at times, their great-grandparents. In fact, the opportunity to serve multiple generations is one of the aspects of the job she likes most. \"I enjoy driving a bus and watching the kids grow up and graduate and have their own kids,\" said Pfannenstiel.\n\nIn addition to driving students to and from school safely, Linda serves as President of the Auburn-Washburn Bus Club, an organization dedicated to supporting Auburn-Washburn families in a variety of ways. The Bus Club provides an annual $2,000 scholarship to a Washburn Rural High School senior. The Club also sponsors at least one family during the holidays and provides support to drivers during times of need. It is the perfect role for someone like Linda, who is known for her servant heart. \"If you needed a shirt, she'd give a coat,\" said fellow bus driver Stephen Billbe. \"She goes above and beyond.\"\n\nAs for what's next, Linda remains dedicated to her role. \"As long as I'm healthy and don't put anybody at risk by me driving, I intend to keep driving,\" she shared. \"I've been challenged to go to 60.\" She will begin her journey toward that goal on Tuesday, August 13, when school resumes for the 2024-2025 school year.\n\nCongratulations, Linda, and thank you for a remarkable 50 years!\n\nToday, we recognize and thank our Operations staff for all their hard work throughout the summer to ensure everything is ready for the start of the new school year.\n\n🛠️To our Grounds and Maintenance crews: Thank you for repairing, maintaining, and improving our facilities, ensuring both our indoor and outdoor spaces are safe and welcoming.\n\n🧹To our Custodial staff: From shampooing carpets and waxing floors to painting and disinfecting, thank you for ensuring every classroom, hallway, and common area is clean and inviting.\n\n🍎To our Food Services team: Thank you for planning and preparing nutritious meals, not only during the school year, but through our summer meal program as well. You keep our students fueled and ready to learn all year long.\n\n🚌To our Transportation team: Your behind-the-scenes work to maintain the fleet, plan bus routes, participate in training exercises, and pass vehicle safety inspections ensures safe and reliable transportation for all–thank you!\n\n💻To our Technology staff: Thank you for updating our software, cleaning and repairing our devices, and answering any and all IT-related questions. You equip our students and staff with the digital tools they need to succeed!\n\n📦To our Warehouse crew: From organizing textbook shipments and lab equipment to managing the flow of food and supplies, your efficiency and organization are critical to our success—thank you!\n\nPlease join us in thanking each of these teams for contributing to the success of our district. We are incredibly grateful for their hard work, dedication, and commitment!"
