It is the successor to SEMTA.\n\nWithin the City of Detroit, SMART coordinates the provision of transit services with the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT), though all SMART routes serving the City except the FAST service serve the City during peak/rush hours on weekdays only, and services within the City (except FAST) are restricted in that trips into the City can only drop off passengers and trips out of the City can only pick up passengers.\n\nHistory\n\nPlease see the timeline links at the bottom of this article for full history.\n\nTimeline of important events\n\nThis section is incomplete. You can help! [1]\n\n1989 - On January 17, the Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority becomes the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation. This was followed several months later by the acquisition of second-hand Grumman Flxible 870 buses.\n\n1993 - On April 1, a standard $1.50 flat fare is implemented on weekdays, replacing the zone system inherited from SEMTA. It had already been implemented on weekends by SEMTA in 1988. It is later raised to $2.00 in 2010.\n\n1994 - SMART's budget deficit reaches a point that unless solutions can be found, service may shut down in the near future. In June, SMART and DDOT attempt to merge five routes, but the project was cancelled in April 1995.\n\n1995 - In order to eliminate debt, a local .33 property tax millage is placed on the ballot and successfully passes in all of Macomb County and portions of Wayne and Oakland to support operations of SMART. As of the most recent referendum in 2022, the current rate is 0.994-0.95 mil. SMART ultimately begins to turn away from a network centered on downtown Detroit to focus more on suburb-to-suburb connections surrounding Detroit.\n\n1996 - SMART and DDOT establish a common regional bus pass but further attempts to merge services fail. SMART establishes the Community Partnership Program to support local transit in communities for seniors and people with disabilities.\n\n1998 - SMART resumes several suburban routes eliminated by DDOT.\n\n2001 - SMART receives it's first low-floor buses, a larger order of Gillig Low Floor buses that quickly replace all high-floor buses.\n\n2002 - SMART millage is increased from .33 mil to .59 mil and successfully passes in all three counties.\n\n2005 - Livonia becomes the first community to opt out of SMART since the implementation of the millage referendum in 1995.\n\n2006 - Walled Lake becomes the first formerly-opt-out community to opt back into SMART's service area since 1996.\n\n2010 - SMART introduces diesel-electric hybrid and low-floor articulated buses to Metro Detroit, the two New Flyer Industries DE60LF buses were purchased using ARRA funds.\n\n2011 - On November 1, SMART unveils three hybrid electric 40 foot Gillig BRT buses using ARRA Funds. The buses are painted in local university colors, which, along with the Gillig BRT model itself, then become standard on many new SMART orders. On December 12, SMART cuts service by 22% due lower property values reducing the revenue collected through the .59 millage.\n\n2012 - Oakland County overwhelmingly passes the SMART millage with a 79% approval.\n\n2014 - Lathrup Village becomes the second formerly-opt-out community to opt back into SMART's service area since 1996.\n\n2016 - As SMART places a large order of new Gillig BRT vehicles into service, several terminal transfers occur with the older Gillig Low Floor fleet, a few permanently.\n\n2017 - Terminal realignments continue with another large Gillig BRT order. On September 4th, the Northland Center bus terminal closes permanently.\n\n2018 - FAST begins operations on New Year's Day, January 1, using a large fleet of Gillig BRTs reassigned from conventional services. A number of recently-retired older Gillig Low Floors are placed back into service due to a resulting conventional-service fleet shortage, mainly providing service on peak-hour runs.\n\n2019 - On May 1, SMART and DDOT streamline their fare systems, centered around a fare payment system called Dart, which includes 4-hour, 24-hour, 7-day and 31-day passes, each offering unlimited rides on both agencies, while the 31-day pass includes a tap-to-pay option that speeds up boarding.\n\n2020 - On June 8, SMART implements the first service change related to the SMART Path Plan master plan first released in 2018, the consolidation of route 125's two Detroit Metro Airport branches into a single branch that serves the airport's two terminals.\n\n2021 - In March, SMART Flex, an app-based microtransit service, launches in Dearborn, Troy, and the Hall Road corridor from Mound Road eastward (including Chesterfield Township and New Baltimore). The service expands to Pontiac and Auburn Hills in August 2021, and Farmington and Farmington Hills in May 2022, with the three initial zones also expanding their service areas over time.\n\n2022 - An attempt by Auburn Hills to become the second community to opt out of SMART since the implementation of the millage referendum in 1995, which was approved on February 22, is blocked by an order from Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Daniel O'Brien. Later that year, Oakland County board members approve a 0.95 countywide property tax millage for supporting SMART expansion within the county. The new millage is approved by voters on November 8.\n\n2023 - On May 1, SMART announces the first phase of an Oakland County expansion plan following the previous year's countywide millage's approval. This first phase sees extensions of routes 305, 740, 790, 805, and 851 and the addition of two new routes, all of which will serve areas including Novi, Rochester, and Waterford. Additionally, routes 450 and 462 FAST Woodward will have new stops added in Bloomfield Hills. The Novi expansion and the Bloomfield Hills stops begin service on September 11.\n\n2024 - A reroute of route 280 to serve downtown Romulus and the restoration of route 560 service to New Baltimore are implemented on January 8, the Rochester expansion begins service on April 22, and the Waterford expansion begins service on June 24. Additionally, efforts are underway to implement a countywide property tax millage in Wayne County, and the SMARTer Mobility master plan is unveiled on June 11. Replacing the SMART Path Plan, the SMARTer Mobility Plan includes modifications to existing and new routes and Flex zones, including a new FAST service on Fort Street.\n\nWebsite timeline\n\nDecember 2001-February 2004\n\nFebruary 2004-September 2011\n\nSeptember 2011-August 2014\n\nAugust 2014-present\n\nFAST\n\nFAST, launched on January 1, 2018, is SMART's brand for bus rapid transit (BRT).

Peak/rush hour trips extend into downtown Detroit.\n\nCommunity Route: Circulates within communities, providing local service to areas of communities not served by more frequent routes.\n\nCrosstown Route: Provides feeder service to main corridor routes, operating between communities.\n\nCommuter Route: Provides frequent service during peak/rush hours only from suburbs into downtown Detroit.\n\nPark & Ride Route: Express routes serving park & ride lots during peak/rush hours only from suburbs into downtown Detroit.\n\nAll routes are wheelchair accessible (as SMART's last-remaining non-wheelchair accessible buses were retired in 1995).\n\nTop 10 busiest routes in 2018\n\n560 Gratiot Local\n\n561/563 Fast Gratiot\n\n461/462 Fast Woodward\n\n710 Nine Mile Crosstown\n\n510 Van Dyke Local/515 Van Dyke Limited\n\n450 Woodward Local/Pontiac/460 Woodward Local/Somerset\n\n125 Fort Street/Eureka Road\n\n275 Telegraph\n\n495 John R\n\n200 Michigan Avenue Local\n\nService changes\n\nSMART often modifies routings and schedules (at least four times a year) for many reasons, including adjusted run times; openings and closures of important stops such as transit centers, malls and big-box stores and supercenters such as Meijer and Walmart; and construction. The most notable service changes almost always occur in January, April, June and September.\n\nPaper schedule booklet covers\n\nWhen SMART began in 1989, the original paper schedule booklet covers featured on the right a pictogram of a passenger-side front view of a Rapid Transit Series bus and on the left the route numbers and names that were included and a list of the communities served by those routes. This design remained until about 2003, when it was changed to the current design that now instead on the right displays a of a photo of 23383 with a \"RIDE SMART\" destination sign display while retaining the same route and community information on the left, but now with the handicap-accesible symbol and later \"Bike Accesible\" and eventually \"Bus Tracker\" symbols, while also eventually adding mentions of the SMART app including the Google Play and App Store logos on the bottom.\n\nRecognition\n\nOfficial color palettes\n\nColor Thumbnail Pantone CMYK RGB (HEX) RGB (Decimal) NCS Notes on usage SMART Red #F3072F R215, G0, B0 SMART SMART Orange #FF6920 R255, G105, B32 SMART Community Transit, SMART commuter routes SMART Blue #00A3C2 R0, G163, B194 SMART timetables, SMART crosstown routes SMART Purple #A3278C R163, G39, B140 SMART passes, SMART community routes SMART Midnight Blue #4C3099 R76, G48, B153 SMART main corridor routes SMART Gray #6B6D71 R107, G109, B113 SMART park & ride routes\n\nLivery\n\nFour different livery schemes have traversed Metro Detroit streets during the last 11 years of the 20th century and during the 21st century.\n\nThe original livery was white with red and orange stripes and black trim around the windows, this one was actually inherited from SEMTA, who first started using it on their first RTS buses in 1978, which were also inherited by SMART and lasted until 1995. The black trim was discontinued upon the arrival of the 2101-2140 series in 2001, but the familiar white with red and orange stripe livery remained in use until 2010, though it is still used today on new 'Community Transit' vehicles.\n\nBuses 3001-3002 deviated from the longtime livery for the first time by using a wrap of a flower field underneath a blue sky. This wrap is still exclusive to both buses.\n\nBeginning with 3003-3005 in 2011, a new template livery was created that is still standard today. It now basically features a retro-styled double-wave design on each side, similar in style to those on the last livery used by Martin Lines prior to it's acquisition by SEMTA, with the waves, the area above the passenger windows, above the engine door on the rear and destination sign area on the front one color and the remainder a different color. Three different color combinations are currently used, derived from the colors of three major Michigan universities: a green-and-gold design for Wayne State University, green-and-white for Michigan State University and maize-and-blue for the University of Michigan.\n\nA modified version is used on buses 3019-3020, which still feature the base Michigan State University colors but instead feature two wide white stripes running from top to bottom across the center of the sides of the vehicle.\n\nSince 2011, new 'Connector' vehicles feature a white base with a red stripe running around the sides before thickening and kicking around the rear.\n\nCoinciding with the adoption of the new logo in 2022, a new livery was unveiled, featuring two silver tones with diagonal red, black, and white stripes near the rear. 4024-4027 were the first buses to receive this livery, and other buses will receive this livery in the near future.\n\nLogo\n\nThe same logo had been used since SMART's 1989 creation until it was redesigned in September 2022, although the distinctive red snail symbol has been used since the SEMTA days.\n\nSlogans\n\nSMART has used various slogans through the years. Past slogans included It's The SMART Thing To Do, For Our Community, and It's a good start when you begin with SMART!. Currently, it uses the slogan Life. SMART. You., adopted alongside the new logo in 2022.\n\nAdvertising\n\nFor several years after it's creation in 1989, SMART ran extensive catchy newspaper ads in several Detroit-area newspaper publications, continuing from practices used by SEMTA. SMART has since stopped doing this practice.\n\nTelevision\n\nOccasionally, every few years, SMART will run an extensive television advertising campaign on various channels in the Detroit area. The current campaign began in September 2022, featuring the new logo and slogan.\n\nBus wraps\n\nSince 2014, SMART will wrap (completely cover) selected buses with advertisements for a number of local, regional and national companies.\n\nFacilities\n\nTerminals\n\nName Address Capacity Opened Macomb Terminal 22900 15 Mile Road, Clinton Township, MI 48035 190 1976 Oakland Terminal 2021 Barrett Drive, Troy, MI 48084 135 1976 Wayne Terminal 30000 Industrial Drive, Inkster, MI 48141 90 1978\n\nTransit Hubs\n\nJohn D.

All fixed-route vehicles feature Clever Devices automated next-stop announcements and interior LED signs (both installed in late 2013 and made standard on all newer vehicles) and GPS systems, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, Sportworks bicycle racks (installed in 2004 and made standard on all newer vehicles), air conditioning and wheelchair ramps at the front door.\n\nDestination signs originate from either the defunct Vultron company (LED signs) or Luminator (Horizon signs). The last remaining buses with mylar-curtain rollsigns, all of which were inherited from SEMTA, were retired in late 1995, while the last full flipdot signs (also manufactured by Vultron) were retired with the last high-floor buses in 2004, and the last LED/flipdot signs (also manufacturered by Vultron) were retired in February 2019. Rollsigns, however, were still used for run number boxes on all operational SMART vehicles except those manufactured by New Flyer Industries up until 2016.\n\nNearly all vehicles also feature the website URL of smartbus.org and SMART's primary phone number of (866) 962-5515 on at least one side, in effect since 2004, prior to then, buses only carried the phone number, which was first launched by SEMTA as the number (313) 962-5515, with the area code ultimately being included in items featuring the number as additional area codes (specifically 810, 248, 947, 734 and 586) were created in Metro Detroit during the early SMART era.\n\nActive Bus Roster\n\nFleet\n\nnumber(s) Thumbnail Year Manufacturer Model Engine Transmission Destination sign Seating Terminal Notes 3003-3005\n\n2011 Gillig BRT HEV 40'\n\n(G30D102N4) Cummins ISB6.7 Allison H 40 EP hybrid system Luminator Horizon 35 American Seating 6468 3003 -
