        "text": "I went there yesterday for dinner. This place is a hidden gem. It looks so nice and clean inside, very professional staff. The atmosphere was very calm and romantic. The food was great! I had the chicken piccata and it tasted so good and very fresh my boyfriend had the flatbread and it was very good too. The appetizer was amazing...\n\nI ordered the calamari appetizer and fettuccini Alfredo with mushrooms and being half-Italian, I am usually very picky with Italian dishes. This meal was excellent. The calamari was perfectly crispy. I loved that they mix in spinach fettuccini noodles. The Alfredo was excellent and closely resembled the Alfredo my Nonni used to make...\n\nThis is a wonderful, comfortable and quiet home style Italian restaurant. We love coming here because the food is so consistently good! My favorite entree is the perch Diane. Always loaded with artichokes and the tang of lemon and perfectly done. My husband likes their lasagna and also veal or chicken piccata. Their tiramisu is outstanding!\n\nThis place is not the closest Italian restaurant for me but is certainly one of the best and worth the 35 mile drive. I enjoyed their food at their former location in Novi which was much closer for me but I make a point of visiting their new location whenever I can. Their lasagna is excellent and their soup and salad very fresh and authentic. The service is always top notch and several of the staff continue here from the Novi location. I plan to continue to enjoy this place."
