This was not just a name; it was a testament to the rich history and cultural heritage of the area. In the heart of Michigan, Pontiac Township was a vibrant, diverse community that shaped the destiny of its residents.\n\nThe name ‘Pontiac Township’ was derived from the Ottawa war chief, Chief Pontiac, who played a pivotal role in the history of the region. The township was established in 1821 and this name remained until 1983. The area was primarily rural, with beautiful landscapes and panoramic views. It was a place where hard work met simple living, where every sunrise promised a new beginning.\n\nHowever, the winds of change began to blow in the mid-20th century. The rural character of Pontiac Township was gradually replaced by industrial growth and development. The area became an attractive destination for businesses and families alike. Recognizing the transformation, the township was renamed the City of Auburn Hills in 1983 to reflect its modern identity.\n\nThe name ‘Auburn Hills’ was chosen to capture the city’s topography, featuring rolling hills and lush greenery. It’s believed the ‘Auburn’ part of the name was inspired by Auburn Road, a major thoroughfare in the city. Today, Auburn Hills stands as a testament to progress and development, never forgetting its roots as Pontiac Township.
