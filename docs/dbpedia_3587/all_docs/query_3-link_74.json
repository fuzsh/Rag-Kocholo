        "text": "How the Pistons are building hope on and off the court.\n\nBy Alan Greason\n\nThe Detroit Pistons, aside from three remarkable championships, have been one of the NBA’s worst teams in recent decades. Since 2009, they have made the playoffs only three times, and are in the midst of a four-year drought.\n\nBut that futility could be changing. The organization has recently made drastic improvements to suggest that a turnaround is at hand. From the ownership to the front office and, finally, to the players on the court, the Pistons have laid the foundation for what fans expect will be a sustained run of success.\n\nIt starts with ownership. On Sept. 5, 2017, six years after Tom Gores became principal owner of the franchise, the Pistons unveiled Little Caesars Arena as their new home. The new arena would be a turning point for Detroit basketball. Not only did the arena bring the team back home to its roots in the city after many years in the suburb of Auburn Hills, but it also infused new energy to the trainers, coaches and players who stepped foot on the hardwood — not to mention the fans.\n\nNow, fans who live in the city of Detroit do not have to travel to Auburn Hills to feel the Pistons experience. To some, it feels as though the Pistons are playing in their backyard. This was a huge step in building culture for Pistons fans, giving the team and its fans a special “313” feeling — Detroit’s area code — that can only be experienced in the heart of the city.\n\nBut the new arena was only the first step in the Pistons’ revival. Next up was the front office. The hiring of General Manager Troy Weaver in 2020 was a drastic improvement that had an immediate impact on the team. After 10 successful seasons with the Oklahoma City Thunder as an assistant general manager and vice president of basketball operations, Weaver was an important part of a front office that emphasized drafting and developing young players who would form the nucleus of a team. While with the Thunder, Weaver helped build a team that included the perennial All-Stars Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden.\n\nOn the Pistons, Weaver has brought a similar draft-and-develop approach as he has avoided big-ticket signings in free agency. With help of other members of the Pistons front office, Weaver has snagged young, talented players in recent drafts including Cade Cunningham, Jaden Ivey and, most recently, Ausar Thompson.\n\nFans are taking notice. Dandre Turk, a senior at Westfield Preparatory Academy and a long-time Pistons fan, has been encouraged by Weaver’s moves. “I've just been impressed by Weaver being able to pinpoint talent and draft ready players,” he says.\n\nThe current crop of promising players began in 2021, when Weaver and the rest of the Pistons front office selected Cunningham out of Oklahoma State with the No. 1 overall pick. A lot was riding on this draft pick, especially since the team had drafted a series of players who didn't live up to their expectations. Dandre says Cunningham’s selection was one of his most exciting experiences as a Pistons fan. Not only did Cunningham bring undeniable talent on the court, but he exuded a style that was immediately appealing to fans, donning a pair of Cartier sunglasses, better known as buffs, on draft night.\n\nWhat made Cunningham so appealing? “Just everything about him,” Dandre says. “His energy matches the city for sure. When I saw him put on those Cartier shades, I knew it was on.”\n\nCunningham went on to have a strong rookie season, averaging 17.4 points, 5.6 assists and 5.5 total rebounds on 50.4% shooting.\n\nThe excitement is showing up in the stands. Austin Perry, a Pistons employee who works in ticket sales, says the number of fans coming out to see the hometown team has skyrocketed. “Definitely, 100%, there has been an increase in ticket sales over the past couple of years, mainly due to new talented players like Cade and Ivey,” Perry says.\n\nPerry was referring to Jaden Ivey, a highly touted guard from Purdue University taken last year with the fifth overall draft pick. Along with the big man Jalen Duren out of the University of Memphis, whom the Pistons traded picks with the Charlotte Hornets to acquire, Ivey and Duren had strong rookie campaigns. Ivey averaged 16.3 points, 3.9 rebounds and 5.2 assists a game on 47.7% shooting. Duren averaged 9.1 points. 1.1 assists and 8.9 total rebounds.\n\nWhen Ivey and Duren are combined with Cunningham, who missed the second half of the 2022-23 season with an injury, they have become a force to be reckoned with — and a beacon of hope for fans.\n\nBut the rebuilding process is not over. This year’s draft has brought even more hope for Pistons fans in Ausar Thompson, who was selected fifth overall — the team’s third straight top-five pick. Ausar, the twin brother of Amen Thompson, who was drafted one pick earlier by the Houston Rockets, bypassed his senior year of high school to play for Overtime Elite, a nascent professional league for younger players where he played for two seasons.\n\nAusar Thompson won back-to-back OTE titles and was named finals most valuable player both times, culminating a stunning turnaround for a team coming off the worst record in the league.\n\nThompson’s selection has raised fans’ hopes even more. Perry expects ticket sales to rise again, similar to what happened when Cunningham was drafted in 2021. “Ausar has the whole package — great athleticism, scoring ability and a great defender. He will bring excitement to fans as well. Ticket sales are going to rise again,” Perry says.\n\nAusar has already gained notice playing alongside Ivey and Duren in the summer league, where Ausar averaged 13.5 points, 10 rebounds and 3.5 assists. Though the Pistons came up short in winning the summer league title, fans were encouraged by Ausar’s performance and look forward to seeing him take the court in Little Caesars Arena.\n\nAll this talent, though, would be for naught without an effective head coach. On June 2, the Pistons signed Monty Williams, a former head coach for the Phoenix Suns, after parting ways with Dwane Casey. The 51-year-old Williams compiled a 194-115 record in four seasons with the Suns. He was awarded coach of the year in 2022 after leading the Suns to 64 regular-season wins.\n\nMany fans believe the addition of Williams is just what the team needs. The youthful Pistons, with an average age of 25, need all the development they can get, and Williams has a proven track record of developing young players like Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges.\n\nDandre, of Westfield Academy, says he was confident in Williams’s ability to steer young players in the right direction. “The hiring of Monty Williams gives me hope,” Dandre says. “He brings a winning mentality to the team along with his ability to make young players better.\n\nWith a new coach, promising players and a patient front office, the elements are there for a Pistons revival. But that also means the pressure is on for Weaver, Williams and players like Cunningham. The fans, after all, expect success.\n\n“My goal as a fan is to see this team succeed long term,” Dandre says. With all the steps that the Pistons have made until now, it would be hard to find a Pistons fan who doesn't feel hope right now.\n\n“I'm now saying this as a fan and a Detroiter myself: It has been a tough road with the Pistons but us fans do feel hope,” he says. “It's there.”"
