It sits close to large metropolitan areas like Pontiac and Rochester Hills. This city covers a large geographical area, so there are multiple high speed Internet options across each of the city's neighborhoods.\n\nThroughout all of Auburn Hills, AT&T is a popular option for residents and businesses alike. The network reaches all of the city, including neighborhoods like Baldwin, downtown, Oakland, Auburn Heights, and Oak Grove.\n\nXfinity is one of the primary cable options in Auburn Hills. The entire city falls into their coverage area. A small part of northwestern Auburn Hills enjoys service through Charter, another cable option.\n\nWindstream and Eaglenet are two prominent Internet providers in Auburn Hills. They have very similar networks that cover all of Auburn Hills, reaching neighboring communities to the north, south, east, and west.\n\nThrough WOW!, those in central and eastern Auburn Hills enjoy coverage options."
