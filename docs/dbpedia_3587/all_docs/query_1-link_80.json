We serve the Rochester Hills, Auburn Hills, Troy, and Bloomfield Township areas, and we are a School of Choice school district that openly welcomes families and students who live outside the school district. Whether youâ€™re a parent coming to check out one of our schools to decide to send your child here, or a community member coming to a school to volunteer for an event - all locations, addresses, and contact info are below for your use. Each location has a designated letter/number code that corresponds with its location on the District Map at the bottom of the page.\n\nDownload Avondale School District Map"
