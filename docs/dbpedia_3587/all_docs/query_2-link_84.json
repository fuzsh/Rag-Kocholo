        "text": "So it sounds like Ravelco needs to change their product such that for a particular unit any of the 16 could be the ground, any of the remaining 15 could be one side of the circuit, and any of the remaining 14 could be the other side. I guess the ground could easily be found, but the homemade harness IGLA man posted as a way to connect the pins wouldn't work. Wouldn't that make Ravelco near unbeatable? That seems like a relatively easy product modification for them to make. It also seems like this is how they led customers to believe it was constructed all along.\n\nNot really... method 1 doesn't depend on the equatorial boundary. The fact that only 5 pins (total) are in play, and only one of them is direct ground makes it child's play to find the other pins. To make it better, they would need to have multiple grounds, multiple phantom power sources, throw in a few resistors on some of the grounds to make them harder to identify as such... THAT would drive people nuts. But that would cost more than the $8 in materials currently used.\n\nSo it sounds like Ravelco needs to change their product such that for a particular unit any of the 16 could be the ground, any of the remaining 15 could be one side of the circuit, and any of the remaining 14 could be the other side.

Test for the 2 circuits, vehicle/engine side will show a pulsed ground then OL (out of limit) indicating thats the other leg of both circuits. Then test for a power indicator (with factory fob or make another) then connect one of those two to the other 2 and then the last 2. If no start then swap them. Nothing they can do to it will make it a viable option unfortunately. Now they finally need to raise their white flag instead of hiding it in one of his rooms in his 12,500sqft mansion.\n\nVery interesting.\n\nI’ll leave you all with food for thought. I’ve had two attempts on my vehicles. Two on MY TRX as well.\n\nThey were both unsuccessful. One the attempts they even came in my house.\n\nWhat did I have for security?\n\nRavelco. I’m not going to provide specific details, but it is much harder to bypass a plug you can’t see. It’s harder to trace a harness back through the firewall if you can’t find it because it’s been integrated into the factory harness. It’s hard to find where it’s spliced, because it’s not done with splices, and it’s not done in a way that’s visible. Can it be defeated? Yes. Is it going to take more skill and time than most thieves have? Yes. Especially if you can’t start the vehicle and have no idea why.\n\nWould this be the case if it was installed in a visible location with the cable run to the fuse box and zip tied? Nope. I’m going to suggest every one of those can be bypassed in minutes if not seconds.\n\nIs IGLA better? I would agree that it is. It’s more contemporary, it’s electronic as well as mechanical and it also affords additional features. I’d have it in addition to Ravelco if there was an installer in my area of the country.\n\nThere isn’t…. Has Ravelco served me well? Twice? And on the second attempt they came with a programmer and still failed.\n\nSo for those who read this thread, and see some very compelling arguments from a guy who is the IGLA rep, consider all sides of the equation. Ravelco, if done well, is much better than nothing.\n\nVery interesting.\n\nI’ll leave you all with food for thought. I’ve had two attempts on my vehicles.

If you can put the cap on it to start your vehicle it most definitely is not a problem to bypass it at all.\n\nThat would be incorrect. If you can put the cap on it to start your vehicle it most definitely is not a problem to bypass it at all.\n\nI get what he's saying - he feels that if the plug is hidden, that offers up an extra layer of security. In a sense, he's right - as there is nothing obvious to say \"this vehicle has a Ravelco installed\". So once the key is copied, but the engine doesn't start, now it's a guessing game. Is there a kill switch? Pop the start button and check the wiring. Nope... OK. We know it doesn't have IGLA, because we just programmed a key. Maybe pop the hood and check the PDC for a Mobilistics relay. Swap them with the wiper motor relays just to be sure. Still no start? Look around for a kill switch somewhere. We're now into the area of the REALLY motivated thief, as most others will have thrown in the towel at that point. Why risk getting caught and spending the next 5, 10, maybe even 30 minutes incarcerated before bonding out on your own PR. Who needs THAT hassle?\n\nThe downfall of the \"hidden\" Ravelco is that it has to be located somewhere A) capable of hiding the plug, and B) \"reasonably\" convenient for the operator. So it's not going to be behind the rear seat, or underneath the pax seat, or buried in the dash. It's going to be within reach of either the driver's seat, or within reach of entering the vehicle. So it's either under the dash below the steering wheel, inside the center console, or inside the glove box. If the glovebox is locked, that's a GIANT clue... and nothing a good-sized screwdriver can't rectify in short order. It may add a minute - maybe 2, but it's going to be discovered. Again, this is if we're talking about a professional, motivated thief with a decent clue what he's doing. The rest will have given up.\n\nBut despite the minimal advantage, we're still in the same \"realm\" of vehicle protection... slightly more secure than a traditional kill switch. Better than your average Ravelco installation, because the plug is not visible - but still, once it's discovered, the bypass procedure is quick and easy for those who took Electronics 101 or grew up with a Radio Shack catalog as their preferred bathroom reading material."
