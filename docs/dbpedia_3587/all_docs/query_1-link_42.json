These \"learning by doing\" opportunities help deepen a student's educational experience through application in real-world contexts, instilling marketable skills like critical thinking, leadership and communication that build a strong foundation for long-term career success. That’s one more reason Wayne State graduates are in high demand in the marketplace. Below are just a few recent Warrior grads who sat down with us to tell their story."
