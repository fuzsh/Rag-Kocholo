Kristin is the Center Director at Auburn Hills KinderCare in Michigan. She holds an associate degree in Early Childhood Education. Kristin has been with KinderCare since 1989 and started her KinderCare journey as an assistant preschool teacher. Her favorite quote is, \"They may forget your name, but they will never forget how you made them feel.\" -Maya Angelou. When she is not working, Kristen likes to spend time on her boat, camping, traveling, and spending time with her husband and two sons.\n\nOur classrooms are places to thrive!\n\nIn our safe and healthy classrooms, your child will be engaged in learning experiences that meet them where they are, both socially and academically. With fun daily activities, passionate teachers, and great friends, a lifetime of confidence starts here. Contact the center director to learn more about our child care options and schedule a tour!\n\nAuburn Hills KinderCare Programs\n\nInfant Programs (6 weeks–1 year)\n\nLeaving your baby in someone else’s care is a big step. Everyone at our centers—most importantly, our naturally gifted infant teachers—will work with you to make sure the transition goes smoothly. When you step into our infant classroom, you’ll see how much we want your infant to feel safe, loved, and ready to explore their world.\n\nToddler Programs (1–2 Years)\n\nEverything in our toddler classroom is designed for little explorers. That’s because a lot is going on at this age. When your child is wandering all over the place, that means they’re learning and discovering new things every day. We’ll help them explore their interests (and find new ones!) as they play and learn.\n\nDiscovery Preschool Programs (2–3 Years)\n\nThis age is filled with so much wonder and curiosity. That’s why we offer a ton of books and toys and bring artwork down to kids eye level. Children in discovery preschool also begin to learn how we all work together in a classroom. Simple math and science, pretend play, and group play help them get used to a more structured school setting.\n\nPreschool Programs (3–4 Years)\n\nThis age is all about expression, when kids really start to form their own ideas about what they want to play and how they want to create. Every day in our preschool classroom, your child will explore science experiments, create artwork, and play pretend—all the skills needed for their big next step: kindergarten!\n\nPrekindergarten Programs (4–5 Years)\n\nWhen you walk into one of our pre-K classrooms, you’ll see artwork and writing displayed around the room. Labels are everywhere to help kids connect letters with words. You’ll also see pictures on the walls that reflect the families in our community. Your child will also deepen their knowledge in language, math, science, Spanish, and social skills.\n\nBefore- and After-School Programs (5–12 Years)\n\nYou can count on us to provide reliable care for your school-ager while you’re at work, with safe transportation from our center to your child’s school and back! Whether your child wants to start a drama club, build a volcano, or create a comic book, they will have a place to follow their dreams. Your child will start and end the day with a whole lot of fun!\n\nSchool Break Programs (preschool, prekindergarten, and school-age)\n\nWinter break, spring break, summer break—when school’s out (but you still need to work), you can count on KinderCare to provide a safe and supportive learning environment that’s focused on fun. We welcome children ages 5–12 during school break times and make sure they have a sensational, screen-free experience they won’t forget.\n\nParticipating Child Care Aware Center\n\nKinderCare partners with Child Care Aware® of America to offer fee assistance for Active Duty military families and flexible support to fit their needs when care at a Child Development Center on the installation is not available.\n\nLearning Adventures - Enrichment Program\n\nCooking Academy™ (3 – 12 Years)\n\nIn Cooking Academy, kids learn new recipes from cultures around the world and develop a healthy relationship with food. They’ll whip up everything from Southwest rainbow lettuce wraps to pumpkin muffins, building their skills in STEM, communication, and more along the way. And yes—little chefs get to eat their culinary creations!\n\nMusic Explorers™ (2 – 4 Years)\n\nKinderCare families are already giving a standing ovation to our newest Learning Adventures program: Music Explorers! Kids will learn to sing, move, listen, play instruments, and even create their own tunes. Our original curriculum blends math, science, social studies, literacy, and mindfulness (think yoga!) for a uniquely KinderCare way of learning the foundations of music.\n\nPhonics Adventures® (2 – 4 Years)\n\nLearning how to read is a whole lot of fun at KinderCare! We help kids grow to love books and words (and get ready for kindergarten) in our Phonics Adventures program. From discovering the basics of vowels to practicing poetry, kids learn all about letters and sounds in small-group lessons made just for their age group. (Bonus: Kids who attend our phonics program are more prepared than their peers for school—and we have the data to prove it.)\n\nSpanish\n\nSpanish Adventures provides young learners with a foundation for later success with the Spanish language. Music, games, children's Spanish literature, and other tools give children multiple opportunities to hear, practice, and see Spanish language to develop vocabulary and conversation skills. Curriculum includes lessons on greetings, numbers, colors, animals, family, body parts, and pets, as well as how to engage conversationally during common scenarios at home, a restaurant, or at the zoo.\n\nSTEM Innovators (3-8 Years)\n\nYou’ve probably heard a lot about how important STEM education is for your child, but what does that really mean? Our STEM Innovators program takes kids’ natural ability to make sense of the world and applies it to robotics, chemistry, coding, geology, and more. While your child experiments, they’ll discover how to use technology to do amazing things!\n\nFamily Stories\n\nDon't take our word for it. Hear what our families have to say about our amazing center! If you have a story about your experience at KinderCare, please share your story with us.\n\n“ Our son has been with Kinder Care since he was three on a part-time learning basis. He has enjoyed Spanish, Math, Phonics, Cooking and Music, all of which continue to him develop and prepare for Kindergarten this fall. The staff is what makes KinderCare so successful! Without a team of dedicated, caring, trusting people there would be no Auburn Hills KinderCare. We are so pleased to have chosen the Auburn Hills KinderCare where you feel like one big family! Thanks to a GREAT team!\n\nShow more\n\nJennefer M. - KinderCare Parent\n\n“ There is not enough space to write about all of the wonderful stories I could tell about KinderCare, but the common theme in all my experiences at the Auburn Hills KinderCare comes down to the people. Whether it is the great level of detail that Ms. Marti provides in her daily Phonics reports for my daughter (perfect for a control freak such as myself), or if it is the funny stories that Ms. Tracie shares about my daughter's day (probably got that from her dad), or my daughter's awesome cooking creations directed by Ms. Sheri, it is the passion and true enjoyment that these wonderful role models give to my children that is invaluable. The friendly daily greetings I get when I walk through the door to drop off/pick up my children is always appreciated...regardless of the day. Ms. Kristen (current center director) offers nothing less than a contagious positive attitude and a true caring nature when it comes to kids. Nothing is as valuable as our children and therefore we would not consider going anywhere else...even though this location is 1/2 hour from our home. The education my son received at KinderCare was second to none and prepared him above and beyond for Kindergarten. What a wonderful foundation to build a child's future on.
