Pp.x, 484. $3o.oocloth,$•2.5opaper. This second volumeon Canadianexternalpolicies coversthe yearsfrom Chanakto NATO. It isno coincidence that the periodalsospansMackenzie King'syearsas prime ministerbecause Staceybelieves that King shaped Canadianforeignpolicyin thoseyears.He doesnot ignorethe changing balance ofworldpowerandtheshiftfromGreatBritaintotheUnitedStates as Canada's majortradingpartner,butwithinthiscontextStacey stresses King's policies andtactics. Withthisperspective, themajorsources areCommons debates, state papers, private correspondence, andpersonal diaries. Historians andpolitical scientists havealready ransacked mostofthese collections andStacey shows aneasy familiarity withthesecondary literature,buthehastakennothingforgranted. His ownresearch in the primarysources hasbeenpainstakingly thorough. Indeed, his thoroughness has disclosed a number of minor errors and omissions inearlieraccounts and,asonewhohasbeencaughtout(245,248),I tipmyhattoa meticulous scholar. This careful research,however,has not led to major revisions.Stacey's interpretations ofmajortrends andpolicies arecautious andbalanced andvery much intheorthodox traditionofCanadian scholarship. In thedebate overthe assertion of Canadianautonomyin the 192osscholars suchasR.M. Dawson andRogerGrahamhavedisagreed overtheextentbywhichBritainresisted the decentralization of the Commonwealth. Stacey takesa middleposition: Britishofficials, in hisview,wantedto imposetheir foreignpolicyon the Commonwealth buttheypreferredlocalautonomy toanyformof continuous consultation. Stacey alsooffersabalanced - or equivocal - assessment of Canada's closer REVIEWS 523 association with the United States. Canada moved from the British to the Americanorbit,notoutof choice butasaconsequence of 'economic factsand publicopinion'(• 79).The shiftwasinevitable butit isnota matterof regret; the'greatneighbour's civilized attitude'isCanada's goodfortune(•59). The closerelationshipposessomeproblems- there is alwaysthe threat of Americancontinentalism and the dangerof hysteriain Americanforeign policy - butCanadian vigilance hasthusfar secured Canadian autonomy. The 'Epilogue' referspessimistically totheexcessive influence oftheUnitedStates since•948; in the MackenzieKing era, however,thisinfluencewasnever undue. Paradoxically, thisbalanced interpretation isinterspersed withidiosyncratic opinions andassertions. DonaldCreighton has'apparently neverreadKing's diary'(• 78);Mackenzie King'was asmall-spirited man'(•87);theinstinct ofthe peoplewassounderthan that of the 'isolationist intelligentsia' in External Affairsin •939 (269).The bookisalsopepperedwithpersonal recollections, even to a footnoteabout hearing the radio addressof GeorgevI on 3 September •939 whileonhishoneymoon (252).Butthesepersonal opinions andcomments aremorethanobiter dicta. Theyconvey tothereaderasense of theimmediacy and of the importance of thesehistorical events whichisin sharp contrast tothenumbing objectivity ofmostsurveys ofCanadian history. The bookhasitslimitations. It isa historyof externalpolicies andnotof external relations. The author does note the influence of the French-Canadian minorityandof shiftingtradebalances buthedoes notattempttoanalyse the long-rangeimplications of suchcultural or economic factors.Staceyhas writtenwhat he intendedto write: a generalhistoryof Canadianexternal policies. It isbased onamastery oftheprimary andsecondary sources. It isalso apleasure toreadbecause itsidiosyncratic opinions andwitraise it far above thelevelofmost textbooks.
