Bonham-Carter, but the life of this command is short, disbanding\n\nin 1923.\n\n1 April\n\nThe Royal Air Force Staff College opens at Andover with Air Commodore\n\nH.R.M. Brooke-Popham as the first commandant. Of the 29 students that\n\ncomprise No.1 Course, six go on to become Commanders-in-Chief and one,\n\nSquadron Leader C.F.A. Portal, becomes Chief of the Air Staff.\n\nSeptember\n\nTurkish\n\ntroops enter the Allied controlled demarcation zone around Gallipoli and\n\nencamp at Chanak. Allied governments are determined to prevent Turkey\n\noccupying Chanak and reinforcements, including a number of Royal Air Force\n\n(RAF) units, are rushed to the area.\n\nElements from Nos. 4, 25, 56, 203 207, 208, and 267 Squadrons are formed\n\ninto the Constantinople Wing, which supports the garrison until the crisis\n\nis settled in August 1923.\n\n5 September\n\nAfter the First World War, Turkey makes strenuous attempts to extend its\n\ncontrol to Mesopotamia (renamed Iraq in September 1921), going as far\n\nas massing troops on the Turkish-Iraqi border\n\nand infiltrating irregular forces into Iraq.\n\nBy August 1922, irregulars, working with the local Kurdish tribes, have\n\noccupied Rowanduz and are probing towards Rania and Sulaimaniya. During\n\nthe month, a mixed column of Imperial troops and levies, sent to restore\n\nthe situation, are forced to retreat and it is subsequently decided to\n\nevacuate Sulaimaniya. Eighteen Royal Air Force (RAF) transport aircraft\n\nparticipate in the evacuation, which begins on this date.\n\n30 September\n\nFollowing earlier British reverses during September 1922, a Turkish Army\n\ndetachment crosses into Iraq and established a post at Koi Sanjak, within\n\n40 miles of Kirkuk. After an ultimatum dropped on the post is ignored,\n\nair action begins against Koi Sanjak and the neighbouring villages and\n\nthe Turkish detachment is forced to withdraw.\n\n1\n\nOctober\n\nThe Royal Air Force (RAF) assumes military control of Iraq and throughout\n\nthe winter of 1922-23, irregular posts are located and attacked from the\n\nair."
