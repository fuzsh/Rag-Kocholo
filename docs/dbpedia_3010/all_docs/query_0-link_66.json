        "text": "This paper analyzes the role that WW1 played in shaping Canada’s political identity and in building Canadian independent position in international affairs. The article concentrates on the analysis of selected wartime and postwar events and processes that constituted milestones in the Canadian road to full political autonomy. In general the paper aims to address the following fundamental questions re. the significance of the First World War for Canadian nationhood: • In what way did the war change Canada’s international status? • What was the influence of the war trauma on Canadian political philosophy, doctrines, decisions and personal convictions of Canada’s political leaders? • How did those doctrines reshape Canada’s attitude to Europe, Britain and the British Empire? • To what extent did the war accelerate the process of Canada’s transition from a dependent colony to an independent international actor?\n\nGordon W. Smith, PhD, dedicated much of his life to researching Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic. His 1952 dissertation from Columbia University on “The Historical and Legal Background of Canada’s Arctic Claims” remains a foundational work on the topic, as does his 1966 chapter “Sovereignty in the North: The Canadian Aspect of an International Problem,” in R. St. J. Macdonald’s The Arctic Frontier. This work is the first volume in a project to edit and publish Smith’s unpublished opus – a manuscript on “A Historical and Legal Study of Sovereignty in the Canadian North and Related Law of the Sea Problems.” Written over three decades, this work may well be the most comprehensive study on the nature and importance of the Canadian North in existence. Volume 1: Terrestrial Sovereignty provides the most comprehensive documentation yet available on the post-Confederation history of Canadian sovereignty in the north. As Arctic sovereignty and security issues return to the forefront of public debate, this invaluable resource provides the foundation upon which we may expand our understanding of Canada’s claims from the original transfers of the northern territories in 1870 and 1880 through to the late twentieth century.\n\n\"This article reports the results of the largest survey of expert opinion on prime ministerial leadership in Canada, conducted in 2011. The top-rated prime ministers were, in order, Laurier, King, Macdonald, and Pearson, who were preferred because of their creative records of achievement and capacity to see the country as a whole, champion its unity, and make for positive change. Survey respondents valued transformational leadership that altered the country, but did so in a cautious way that did not threaten national cohesiveness. The article makes frequent reference to the international literature on leadership, allowing for comparisons across a range of countries.\"\n\nThis chapter explores the results of several expert rankings of Canadian prime ministers that have been conducted over the last half-century, the most recent of which was initiated by the authors in 2011. It analyses the importance, consistency and reliability of such expert ranking exercises, while also reflecting upon the nature of national politics in Canada and the circumstances under which transformation in the Canadian political system is most effectively managed. The chapter highlights that in a nation of regional and cultural cleavages the ability to maintain national unity is prized as the sine qua non of successful leadership, and, consistent with this, preference is given to prime ministers that have wrought change consensually and unobtrusively. For all that, the authors find that for a prime minister to be assessed as truly successful they must have transformed Canada, even if the country does not take easily to change.\n\nThe Council on Foreign Relations has given rise to its own mythology, attracting attacks from both Right and Left in American politics as an example of the ability of anti-democratic, elitist groups to set governmental policy. Robert D. Schulzinger, Michael Wala, and Inderjeet Parmar have also studied the Council’s role and influence upon American foreign affairs. Their works largely concentrate upon the period from approximately 1940 onwards, when the United States began to take an increasingly important part in world affairs, and upon the Council’s contribution to its country’s international transformation. This essay focuses on the Council’s earlier interwar activities, in the fifteen or twenty years after its foundation, and in particular upon its impact upon Anglo-American relations. In recent years historians have drawn attention to the development between the wars among certain sections of the foreign-policy elite in both Britain and the United States of sentiments in favour of closer Anglo-American relations. This essay suggests that the roots of the transformation in American international policies, most notably the dedication and commitment with which the United States government supported the Allies, especially Britain, during the Second World War, owed something to the Council’s previous efforts to improve Anglo-American relations."
