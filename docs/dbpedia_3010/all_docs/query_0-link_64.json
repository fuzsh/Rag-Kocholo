Following the fall of Sicily to the Allies in 1943 Mussolini was dismissed from office and arrested, but was rescued on Hitler’s orders and set up a new fascist regime in German-occupied northern Italy.

Nivelle was replaced by Pétain.\n\nNivelle Offensive, 1917\n\nA major offensive against the Germans launched by General Nivelle along the Chemin des Dames in April 1917. Although the charming and charismatic Nivelle had aroused enormous expectations, the attack was a fiasco.\n\nNorthcliffe, 1st Lord, formerly Alfred Harmsworth (1865-1922)\n\nBritish press baron, owner of the Times and founder of the Daily Mail.\n\nNorthcliffe had founded the Daily Mail in 1896 and became chief proprietor of the Times in 1908.

The pact also ensured that neither was able to make peace without the agreement of the other.\n\nPasschendaele\n\nVillage in Flanders, the centre of the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917. The British bombardment destroyed the local drainage system which, combined with heavy rain, turned the battlefield into a quagmire.

After the German spring offensive of March 1918 Pétain saw his priority as the defence of Paris, even at the risk of breaking contact with his allies. In 1940 he was called on to lead a government which would negotiate an armistice with the invading Germans, and he served as Head of State in the collaborationist Vichy regime. He was arrested in 1945 and condemned to death, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and he died in prison on the Ile d’Yeu.\n\nPétain’s First World War service included: Commandant of the 33rd infantry regiment at Arras and the 4th Brigade at St Omer, 1914; Brigadier-General August 1914 (Charleroi); commanded the 6th Division of Infantry (Marne), the 33rd Army Corps, 20 October 1914; stormed Carency, May 1915; took command of the 2nd Army, June 1915; in charge of operations in front of Verdun, February-May 1916; commanded a group of Armies, May 1916; Commander-in-Chief, May 1917.

In 1940 Pétain became Minister of State and Vice-President of the Council, as well as Chief of the French State (1940-1944) and Prime Minister of France (1940-1942).\n\nPopular Front\n\nA term borrowed from Spanish politics to signify a broad coalition of leftist political groups, ranging from moderate liberals to extreme communists and anarchists.

This had been declared a demilitarized zone under the Treaty of Versailles, and Hitler’s generals advised him against the move, as it might lead to war with France. However, France would not take action without British support and the British refused to go to war over the incident, declaring that “Germany was only marching into its own back yard.”\n\nRobertson, Field Marshal Sir William (1860-1933)\n\nBritish General. Chief of Staff in France, 1915, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, 1915-1918 (responsible for co-ordinating the armed forces of Britain and the Empire).\n\nRobertson was a convinced “westerner” (concentrating on the Western Front) and a strong supporter of Field Marshal Haig. It was Robertson who took the decision to pull out of the disastrous Dardanelles campaign. Robertson was out-manoeuvred by his political opponents, and replaced in February 1918 by Sir Henry Wilson.\n\nRobertson began his military career as a private in the ranks in 1877, achieving promotion to officer rank as a Lieutenant in the 3rd Dragoon Guards, 1888. Thereafter he served as: a staff officer in Intelligence in India and South Africa; as Assistant Director of Military Operations, War Office, 1901-1907; on the General Staff, Aldershot, 1907-1910; as Commandant of the Staff College, 1910-1913; Director of Military Training at War Office, 1913-1914.

After a brief spell as General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Eastern Command, he returned home to act as Commander-in-Chief of the forces in Britain, 1918-1919, then Commander-in-Chief, British Army on the Rhine, 1919-1920. Robertson was finally promoted to Field-Marshal, 1920, and is still the only man to rise to this rank from that of private.\n\nRome-Berlin Axis, 1936\n\nTreaty of friendship signed between Italy and Germany on October 25, 1936.\n\nRoosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945)\n\nPresident of the United States, 1933-1945.\n\nMember of Senate State of New York (1910-1913); Assistant Secretary of the Navy (1913-1920); in charge of inspections of US Naval Forces in European Waters (1918), and of demobilisation in Europe (1919); Governor of the State of New York (1929-1933); Nominated for Vice-President of the United States by Democratic Party (1920); Democratic nominee for President of the United States (1932).

Enormous hopes were built up before the assault, which was to involve large numbers of those who had responded to Lord Kitchener’s famous appeal for volunteers. In the event, the attack was a disaster: German machine guns caused 60,000 British casualties on the first day alone, and the battle, which had been expected to last a matter of days, dragged on until the autumn. British gains were minimal, and even the use of tanks failed to break through the German lines. The battle has become a symbol of the failures of British generalship in the First World War.\n\nSpanish Civil War\n\nDevastating civil war between the right-wing Spanish Nationalists, led by General Francisco Franco, and supported by Nazi Germany, Italy and Portugal, and the Republican Government forces, supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico. The war lasted from July 1936 to April 1939, increasing tensions throughout Europe, and featuring terrible atrocities on both sides. It ended in victory for the Nationalists, and a dictatorship which was to last until Franco’s death in 1975.\n\nSpring Offensive\n\nA massive, and initially very successful, German attack on the Allied lines. It was launched by General Ludendorff on 21st March 1918 against Sir Hubert Gough’s depleted Fifth Army on the old Somme battlefield. The Germans broke through the British lines and moved into open countryside behind the British trenches. For a time the British and French position was critical, but the Germans did not have the reserves to carry through their advances, and Allied resistance was stiffening as more American reinforcements began to arrive. The offensive was finally reversed in a major Allied counter-attack in August 1918.\n\nSuez Crisis, 1956\n\nAttack on Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel in October 1956, following Egypt’s decision to nationalize the Suez canal after the withdrawal of an offer by Britain and America to fund the building of the Aswan Dam. Although militarily successful, Britain and France were forced to withdraw after financial and political pressure from the United States and United Nations.\n\nSwinton, 1st Lord Swinton (1884-1972), earlier Philip Lloyd-Greame and then Philip Cunliffe-Lister\n\nBritish politician.\n\nElected Conservative MP for Hendon Division of Middlesex (1918); President of the Board of Trade (1922-1923, 1924-1929 and in 1931); Secretary of State for the Colonies (1931-1935); Secretary of State for Air (1935-1938); Cabinet Minister Resident in West Africa (1942-1944); Minister for Civil Aviation (1944-1945); Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Minister of Materials (1951-1952); Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (December 1952-April 1955); Deputy Leader of the House of Lords (1951-1955).\n\nTariffs\n\nTaxes on particular classes of imports or exports.\n\nTerschelling\n\nIsland off the coast of the Netherlands.\n\nTexel\n\nIsland off the coast of the Netherlands.\n\nThatcher, Margaret Hilda Thatcher (b.1925), Baroness Thatcher\n\nBritish politician and first woman Prime Minister.\n\nElected Conservative MP for Finchley (1959). Entered the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Education and Science (1970-74), then became Leader of the Conservative Party in 1975. Prime Minister (1979-90).\n\nGrand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz (1849-1930)\n\nHead of the German navy.\n\nGerman naval secretary from 1898, von Tirpitz persuaded both Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Reichstag to support his Navy Laws, which built up the small German High Seas fleet into a fleet capable of challenging Britain’s hitherto undisputed naval supremacy.\n\nTizard, Professor Sir Henry Tizard (1885-1959)\n\nPhysical chemist, aeronautics expert and champion of the development of radar.\n\nJoined Royal Flying Corps (1915); Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Controller of Experiments and Research, Royal Air Force (1918-1919); Permanent Secretary, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (1927-1929); Chairman, Aeronautical Research Committee (1933-1943); Chairman, Advisory Council on Scientific Policy and Defence Research Policy Committee (1946-1952); Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence (1948-1952).\n\nTreasury\n\nGovernment department with responsibility for finance.\n\nTreaty of Versailles, 1919\n\nPeace treaty signed in 1919 which officially ended the First World War, after six months of negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference. Some of the treaty’s main points required Germany to accept responsibility for causing the war, to disarm, make substantial territorial concessions and to pay large financial reparations to the Allies. This caused lasting resentment in Germany, right up until the Second World War, and the treaty was widely ignored by the mid-1930’s.\n\nTurkey\n\nMuslim country with capital at Istanbul. Formerly the heart of the great Ottoman Empire, created by the Ottoman Turks. Istanbul was formerly called Constantinople.\n\nTwo Power Standard\n\nThe British naval policy adopted in 1889 whereby the Royal Navy was to be maintained at a size at least equal to those of the next two largest fleets combined. At the time these were supposed to be fleets of France and Russia, but the policy was a major driving force behind Britain’s reaction to German naval expansion in the years before 1914 (see Tirpitz; Navy League; Navy Laws). The policy was abandoned by Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty in 1912.\n\nUnionist\n\ni.e. Conservative. The Conservative Party was also known as the Unionist Party to stress its support for the Union with Northern Ireland.\n\nVerdun, Battle of\n\nOne of the major battles of the First World War. It began in February 1916 with a German attack on the French fortifications around the town of Verdun, and degenerated over the next nine months into a bitter trench battle which drained the French army of men. It was this battle which first brought General Pétain to national prominence.\n\nWall Street Crash, 1929\n\nDevastating financial crash on the Wall Street stock market in New York in October 1929, which had a major impact on the American and world economy.\n\nWar Cabinet\n\nSmall group of senior Ministers and military chiefs responsible for overall strategy and policy in time of war.\n\nWestern Front\n\nThe battlefront in the First World War which, from late 1914, ran in a single line of trenches from the Belgian coast to the Swiss frontier. The British Expeditionary Force (part of the Army available for service in Europe) occupied the Belgian and northern French part of the front. The Western Front was characterised by static trench warfare, in contrast with the Eastern Front, where there was much more movement.\n\nWesterners\n\nThose political and particularly military figures who, in the First World War, advocated concentrating all Allied efforts on the Western Front, even to the point of ignoring other fronts altogether. Trying to evict the Germans from the huge tract of northern France which they occupied in 1914 was a political as well as military imperative for the French, and Britain, as the junior ally, was obliged to support them. Major “westerners” included Field Marshal Haig and Sir William Robertson. They were opposed by “easterners”, including Lloyd George and Churchill.\n\nWigram, Ralph Wigram (1890-1936)\n\nForeign Office official who helped provide Winston Churchill with information on German rearmament.\n\n3rd Secretary, Foreign Office (1919); 2nd Secretary (1920); 1st Secretary, British Embassy, Paris (1924-1933); Counsellor and head of the Foreign Office Central Department (1934).\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II (1859-1941)\n\nGerman Emperor (Kaiser) from 1888 – 1918.\n\nWilhelm had a strong love-hate relationship with Britain, epitomised by his difficult relations with his British relatives (he was first cousin to Britain’s King George V). After sacking the German Chancellor, Prince Otto von Bismarck in 1890 he was increasingly taken up with ambitious policies to push Germany to international prominence and especially to challenge the position of Great Britain. He supported the Boers in the Boer War and challenged the French and British in the Moroccan crisis, 1905 and again in the Agadir crisis, 1911. He enthusiastically supported Tirpitz’s policy of naval expansion, though he adopted a more moderate tone when the war crisis of 1914 actually struck. He was not an inspiring war leader, and his reputation suffered badly from Germany’s defeat in 1918, when he was forced to abdicate and flee to exile in Holland. Although German nationalists after 1918 often regretted the loss of the monarchy, neither they nor the Nazis particularly wanted him back, and he died in exile in Holland in 1941.\n\nWilson, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson (1842-1921)\n\nFirst Sea Lord (most senior Admiral of the Royal Navy), 1909-1912.\n\nLike his contemporary Admiral Fisher, Wilson was brought back to the Admiralty during the First World War after a career which had begun in the Victorian era. His service included: Captain 1880; Rear-Admiral 1895; Vice-Admiral 1901; served Crimean War, 1854; Chinese War, 1865; Egyptian Campaign, 1882; Soudan Campaign, 1884; Aide de Camp to the Queen, 1892-1895; a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty and Comptroller of the Navy, 1897-1901; commanded Channel Squadron, 1901-1903; Commander-in-Chief of Home and Channel Fleets, 1903-1907; Admiral of the Fleet, 1907. Returned to the Admiralty without any formal post, October 1914-June 1918.\n\nWilson, Field Marshal Sir Henry (1864-1922)\n\nBritish General. Director of Military Operations, 1910-14.\n\nWilson was a keen advocate of working closely with the French, and although he sympathised with the “westerner” point of view (concentrating on the Western Front), he was much more prepared than Sir Douglas Haig and Sir William Robertson to work alongside Lloyd George and the War Cabinet (the group responsible for overall strategy and policy in time of war).\n\nWilson entered the Army in 1884, serving in Burma and (with particular distinction), South Africa, in the Boer War. He acted as Assistant Director Staff Duties, War Office, 1904-1906 and Commandant Staff College, 1907-1910. From 1910-1914 he served as Director of Military Operations at Army Headquarters and also as Assistant Chief of General Staff to Field Marshal French, 1914. He acted as Liaison Officer with the French forces, and was a British Military Representative at Versailles, in 1917. In February 1918 he replaced Robertson as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (responsible for co-ordinating the armed forces of Britain and the Empire). In 1922 he was assassinated by the IRA.\n\nWilson, Woodrow (1856-1924)\n\nAmerican politician, President 1913-1919.\n\nWilson began his career practising law, but gave this up for academic life as a Professor of History and Political Economy at Bryn Mawr College, 1885-1888, Wesleyan University, 1888-1890, then as Professor of Jurisprudence and Politics, Princeton University, 1890-1910 (he was President of the University, 1902-1910). In 1911, taking another new turn, he was elected Democratic Governor of New Jersey. He became President in 1913 and was re-elected in 1916 on the promise to keep the USA out of the First World War. In 1917, however, provoked by German U-boat attacks on American shipping and by German anti-American intrigues in Mexico, he persuaded Congress (the legislative body of the USA) to declare war on Germany. He issued his famous Fourteen Points as a basis for a peace settlement in January 1918, and it was in the expectation that the peace settlement would follow this framework that the Germans finally asked for an armistice in November of that year. Wilson hoped that the Paris Peace settlement, including the Treaty of Versailles, which he helped to negotiate in 1919, would be based upon national self-determination, but he was unable to impose his will on his allies, and the settlement was much harsher on Germany and her allies than Wilson had intended or expected. He placed great hope in the idea of a League of Nations to settle international disputes peacefully, but he had underestimated the extent of opposition to the idea in the USA, where Congress voted not to ratify the Treaty and therefore not to join the League. Wilson’s efforts to drum up popular support for the League broke his health, and he died an invalid in 1924.\n\nWood, Sir Kingsley Wood (1881-1943)\n\nBritish politician.\n\nElected as Conservative MP for Woolwich West in 1918. Held positions in the Ministry of Health (1919-1929) and Board of Education (1931); Postmaster-General (1931-1935); Minister of Health (1935-1938); Secretary of State for Air (1938-1940); Lord Privy Seal (April-May 1940); Chancellor of the Exchequer (1940-1943).\n\nYpres\n\nBelgian town, the centre of three major battles in the First World War, including the appalling slaughter of Passchendaele, and of fighting during the German spring offensive in 1918. The British trench line in front of Ypres formed a large salient or bulge extending into the German lines, which meant that British troops could be fired on from three sides, making it one of the most dangerous parts of the British sector of the Western Front. Affectionately nicknamed “Wipers” by British troops, Ypres remained in British hands throughout the war."
