Your Committee heard that the Director will be accountable to the Speakers \"for the management and performance of the parliamentary protective service'', however he will also \"be accountable to the RCMP commissioner through the RCMP chain of command to ensure that the RCMP meets its responsibility according to the terms of service that is included in the arrangement between the Speakers, the Minister of Public Safety and the RCMP.''\n\nYour committee is troubled that this places the Director in an untenable conflict of interest, and threatens parliamentary privilege. Your committee notes that in all the years of Liberal governments, including the very challenging time immediately after the terrible events of 9/11, Liberal prime ministers and governments were able to effectively protect Canadians' security and the security of the parliamentary precinct without breaching parliamentary privilege of any parliamentarian or Parliament as a whole. Your committee is troubled that the current government has failed to achieve this balance therefore necessitating the unprecedented changes set out in Bill C-59, and moreover that we are witnessing an attempted takeover of Parliament by the government by placing the Parliamentary precinct under the control of a protective service whose director will be reporting to the RCMP Commissioner who in turn reports to the Minister of Public Safety.'';\n\nAnd on the subamendment of the Honourable Senator Mitchell, seconded by the Honourable Senator Moore, that the motion in amendment be not now adopted, but that it be further amended by adding immediately after the last sentence the following:\n\n\"Conclusion\n\nYour Committee is therefore concerned that Division 10 of Part 3 of Bill C-59 does not strike the best balance between the competing needs at play in the provision of security throughout the parliamentary precinct and the grounds of Parliament Hill, and that the proposed measures do not fully respect the letter and spirit of the resolutions of February 2015 while upholding parliamentary privilege.''.\n\nNo. 2.\n\nJune 25, 2015—Resuming debate on the consideration of the eleventh report of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce (Subject matter of Bill C-59 (Divisions 14 and 19 of Part 3)), tabled in the Senate on June 4, 2015;\n\nAnd on the motion in amendment of the Honourable Senator Ringuette, seconded by the Honourable Senator Eggleton, P.C., that the report be amended by adding immediately before the words:\n\n\"Respectfully submitted''\n\nthe following:\n\n\"Nevertheless, the committee believes that the changes to the Trust and Loans Companies Act, the Bank Act, the Insurance Companies Act, and the Cooperative Credit Association Act should be reviewed in three years to determine their effectiveness.''.\n\nNo. 3.\n\nJune 25, 2015—Resuming debate on the consideration of the twenty-second report of the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology (Subject matter of Bill C-59 (Division 15 of Part 3)), tabled in the Senate on June 3, 2015.\n\nNo. 4.\n\nJune 3, 2015—Consideration of the fifteenth report of the Standing Senate Committee on National Security and Defence (Subject matter of Bill C-59 (Divisions 2 and 17 of Part 3)), tabled in the Senate on June 3, 2015.\n\nNo. 5.\n\nMay 28, 2015—Consideration of the tenth report of the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples (Subject matter of Bill C-59 (Division 16 of Part 3)), tabled in the Senate on May 28, 2015.\n\nNo. 6.\n\nNovember 26, 2014—Consideration of the sixth report of the Standing Senate Committee on Fisheries and Oceans (Fisheries and Oceans Canada's Proposal for User Fees and Service Standard for Aquaculture Licenses under the Pacific Aquaculture Regulations, without amendment), tabled in the Senate on November 26, 2014.\n\nMotions\n\nNil\n\nInquiries\n\nNo. 2.\n\nBy the Honourable Senator Martin:\n\nApril 22, 2015—That she will call the attention of the Senate to the budget entitled, Strong Leadership: A Balanced- Budget, Low-Tax Plan for Jobs, Growth and Security, tabled in the House of Commons on April 21, 2015, by the Minister of Finance, the Honourable Joe Oliver, P.C., M.P., and in the Senate on April 22, 2015.\n\nOther\n\nNo. 2.\n\nApril 1, 2014—Resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Martin, seconded by the Honourable Senator Marshall:\n\nThat the Senate share the concerns and conclusions expressed by the House of Commons in the message dated March 26, 2014;\n\nThat the Senate convey this resolution of the Senate to the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to Canada;

Given that Tribunal members will be Ottawa-based, how will local economic realities be taken into account when hearing Employment Insurance appeals?\n\n7. Has Human Resources and Social Development Canada or Service Canada developed policy or guidelines to address the challenges of possible low functional literacy levels among Employment Insurance claimants?\n\n8. How has Human Resources and Social Development Canada or Service Canada trained its employees to recognize the needs of Employment Insurance claimants with low functional literacy levels?\n\nNo. 4.\n\nBy the Honourable Senator Callbeck:\n\nOctober 17, 2013—1. In August 2012, the Minister of Human Resources announced changes to the Working While on Claim Pilot Project. This pilot project allowed Employment Insurance (EI) recipients to collect benefits even if they are able to find part-time work.\n\nThe previous system clawed back benefits once the part-time wages exceeded 40% of benefits, or $75 a week, whichever is greater. The change means that the federal government will now clawback all new earnings, from the first dollar earned, at a rate of 50%.\n\nIn October, the Minister of Human Resources announced a transition measure that those EI recipients who were working while on claim between August 7, 2011 and August 4, 2012 will be given the option of reverting to the rules that existed under the previous pilot project.\n\n(a) How many individuals have utilized this pilot project in each fiscal year, by province, from the year of the project's inception?\n\n(b) Has the Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Service Canada, or Finance Canada estimated how many EI recipients who were working while on claim between August 7, 2011 and August 4, 2012 will opt to revert to the rules that existed under the previous pilot project? If so, what are the results?\n\n(c) Has Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Service Canada, or Finance Canada undertaken any analysis or case studies to compare the impact on income, based on factors such as occupation, wage levels, etc., for individuals in each province between the previous and the new pilot project? If so, what are the results?\n\n(d) Has Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Service Canada, or Finance Canada undertaken any study to estimate the negative impact to the overall economies of each province as a result of this change? If so, what are the results?\n\n(e) Has Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Service Canada, or Finance Canada undertaken any study to estimate the cost to social services in each province as a result of this change? If so, what are the results?\n\n2. On September 15, 2012, the Minister of Human Resources allowed the Extended Employment Insurance Benefits Pilot Project to expire. This pilot project provided an extra five weeks of Employment Insurance benefits to people living in 21 designated regions with high unemployment.\n\nAs a province with a chronically high unemployment rate, Prince Edward Island is one of those regions. In addition, the three primary industries of the province are seasonal in nature: agriculture, fisheries, and tourism.\n\n(a) How many individuals have utilized this pilot project in each fiscal year, by province, from the year of the project's inception?\n\n(b) Has Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Service Canada, or Finance Canada undertaken any study to estimate the negative impact to the overall economies of each province as a result of the cancellation of this pilot project? If so, what are the results?\n\n(c) Has Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Service Canada, or Finance Canada undertaken any study to estimate the cost to social services in each province as a result of the cancellation of this pilot project? If so, what are the results?\n\n(d) What initiatives will Human Resources and Skills Development Canada or Service Canada implement to ensure that EI recipients who work in seasonal industries can weather five extra weeks without income?\n\nNo. 17.\n\nBy the Honourable Senator Downe:\n\nMarch 25, 2014—With respect to the Enhanced New Veterans Charter Act:\n\nIn response to a written question tabled in the Senate on November 4, 2013, Julian Fantino, the Minister of Veterans Affairs, confirmed that as of August 31, 2013, an incalculable amount of the promised \"two billion dollars'' of changes to the New Veterans Charter had been spent on 2717 veterans who were receiving increased monthly financial compensation through the earnings loss benefit; 590 veterans who were receiving increased access to the Permanent Incapacity Allowance; and 202 veterans who were receiving access to the Exception Incapacity Allowance.\n\nWould the Government of Canada provide the following information regarding the answer of the Minister:\n\nA. How much have payments increased on average for the 2717 veterans entitled to increased earnings loss benefits;\n\nB.

How much have payments increased for each of the 590 veterans entitled to increased Permanent Incapacity Allowances;\n\nE. How much have payments increased on average for the 202 veterans entitled to Exceptional Incapacity Allowances; and\n\nF. How much have payments increased for each of the 202 veterans entitled to Exceptional Incapacity Allowances?\n\nNo. 18.\n\nBy the Honourable Senator Downe:\n\nMarch 25, 2014—With respect to the benefit provided by the Government of Canada for veterans' funeral and burial expenses:\n\nA. What is the maximum amount available through the Veterans Funeral and Burial Program for funeral services?\n\nB.

How many requests for assistance with burial costs were made in each of the fiscal years from 2006-2013?\n\nF. How many of the requests in (E) were approved?\n\nG. For the requests in (E), please provide a breakdown, by fiscal year, summarizing the reasons for rejecting the requests ( e.g. value of estate did not satisfy means test, veteran did not serve in First and Second World War or Korea, etc.) and the number of requests that were rejected for each reason.\n\nNo. 31.\n\nBy the Honourable Senator Callbeck:\n\nMay 1, 2014—1. On July 4, 2011, the federal, provincial and territorial governments committed to a combined $1.4 billion investment under a new Investment in Affordable Housing Framework 2011-2014. This framework was implemented through IAH bilateral agreements between CMHC and most provinces and territories.\n\nFor Prince Edward Island in particular, the Government of Canada and the Province announced a combined investment of close to $7 million under the renewal of the existing Affordable Housing Initiative and renovation programs for the 2011-2014 period.\n\n(a) What was the federal share for each province or territory?\n\n(b) What was the provincial or territorial share for each province or territory?\n\n(c) How much of the federal share has been claimed in each year for each province or territory?\n\n(d) How many households/units are funded per year by the AHI in each province or territory?\n\n2. Budget 2013 announced more than $1.25 billion over five years, beginning in April 2014, to extend the Investment in Affordable Housing (IAH) to March 31, 2019. This is a significant decrease over the previous 2011-2014 investment.\n\nCanada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's (CMHC) website states that it is currently working with provinces and territories on the renewal of affordable housing investments to 2019.\n\n(a) Aside from PEI, which signed its agreements April 25, have agreements been signed with any other province or territory? If so, which one(s)?\n\n(b) Is the federal government or CMHC currently negotiating with all provinces and territories? If not, which provinces or territories are engaged in negotiations?\n\n(c) At what stage are these negotiations for each province or territory?\n\n(d) When does the federal government estimate IAH agreements to be signed with every province or territory?\n\n(e) What will be the federal share for each province or territory for each year of the agreements?\n\n(f) What will be the provincial or territorial share for each province or territory for each year of the agreements?\n\n(g) How many households/units will be funded by this renewal of the AHI in each province or territory in each year of the agreement?\n\n(h) What is the federal government's rationale for a more than 45% annual decrease between the 2011-2014 IAH and this extension?\n\n3. Over the next two decades, about $1.7 billion in annual federal funding for long-term social housing will be expiring across the country. This funding accounts for approximately 600,000 social housing units in Canada, and its expiry will put one-third at risk. CMHC also has agreements with housing co-operatives in Canada, which have already begun to expire. The federal government had indicated that they will not be renewed.\n\nFor Prince Edward Island, there are approximately 50 agreements with the provincial government and housing co- ops worth about $12 million annually. The federal government subsidizes 3,100 households across the province for seniors and low-income people.\n\nThere have been calls from some provinces and the Canadian Federation of Municipalities for the federal government to discuss renewal of these agreements, and develop a long-term social housing plan.\n\n(a) Has the federal government undertaken any discussions to renew the expiring long-term social housing agreements with any province or territory? If so, what were the results?\n\n(b) Has the federal government undertaken any discussions to renew the expiring agreements with any housing co-operative? If so, what were the results?\n\n(c) Has the federal government undertaken any study to determine the impact of the expiry of these long-term social housing agreements? If so, what were the results?\n\n(d) Has the federal government undertaken any study to determine the impact of the expiry of agreements with housing co-operatives? If so, what were the results?\n\nPlease note that I wish to receive a response within 45 days of tabling these questions.\n\nNo. 32.\n\nBy the Honourable Senator Downe:\n\nMay 27, 2014—Could the Government provide a list of recipients of all civil and military decorations, awards and commendations granted to individuals or groups by all branches of the Government of Canada for actions in the wake of the crash of Swissair Flight 111 on September 2nd, 1998?\n\nNo. 34\n\nBy the Honourable Senator Cowan:\n\nFebruary 3, 2015—For the three-year period ending December 31, 2014, in respect to each inmate death in federal institutions under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, what was:\n\n(a) the name and number of the inmate;\n\n(b) the date of death of the inmate;\n\n(c) the age of the inmate;\n\n(d) the cause of death of the inmate;\n\n(e) the sentence being served by the inmate; and\n\n(f) the institution where the death occurred?"
