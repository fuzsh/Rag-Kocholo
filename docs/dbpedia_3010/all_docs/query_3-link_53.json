More than a mere comparison of the policies and strategies put in place by the two powers to govern their respective mandates, this article intends to be an analysis of the way the British saw the French strategy and vice versa. Such an approach will shed light on the way the British and the French conceived their own policies. The article also dwells on forms of cooperation and similarities in the way the British and the French managed the A mandates of the League of Nations.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n1On 1st December 1956, while Britain and France were facing the diplomatic consequences of the Suez Crisis, the French Orientalist Jacques Berque gave his inaugural lecture at the Collège de France, where he held a chair in the social history of contemporary Islam. In his lecture, Berque tackled the long history of the relationship between France and the Arab world. Despite the context, he wanted to believe that the French language and culture would still play a role in the region's future:\n\n1 Quoted in Henry Laurens, Français et Arabes depuis deux siècles, la « chose franco-arabe » (Paris, (...)\n\nVoyez notre langue, notre culture, elles sont aujourd'hui combattues ou soutenues en Orient, à la fois parce qu'elles étaient celles de la bourgeoisie et parce qu'elles sont celles de l'intelligentsia. Langue de la « gauche » et de l'éducation missionnaire [...], véhicule à la fois d'un humanisme aux valeurs reconnues et d'une inquiétude qui le remet en cause, le français et son message ont encore, dans ces pays, un avenir que l'inimitié des adversaires permet seule de mesurer. Adversaires dont peu sont arabes, car le français, j'ose le déclarer même aujourd'hui, reste l'hellénisme des peuples arabes.\n\n6It will first dwell on the specificity of British and French interests and strategies in the Middle East before analyzing the mutual suspicions at work in the discourses of the people on the spot. Finally, the article will show that the Franco-British relationship in that region also entailed cooperation and emulation.\n\nFrench and British interests and strategies in their Middle Eastern mandates\n\n9At the beginning of the mandate, French rule was rather direct and authoritarian. The government was highly centralized around the offices of the High-Commissioner, located in Beirut. There were also delegates controlling the local indigenous governments and French advisers in the various ministries. Moreover, there was a significant French military presence due to a conflict with Kemalist forces over the region of Cilicia, and also to pacify the areas in which there were attempts to resist French rule. The French promoted local political autonomy while resorting to a form of centralized management when it came to the budget and the economy of the mandate as a whole. Despite the integration of what the French called Les États du Levant into their empire, the latter were isolated from a geographical point of view. There was no contiguity between these states and their Algerian colony or the Protectorates of the French in North Africa.\n\n10The British, on the other hand, already controlled several parts of the Middle East when they were granted mandates in that region. They had occupied Egypt as early as 1882, as the control of the Suez Canal was vital for access to India. The British were also on friendly terms with several chiefs of the Arabian Peninsula and the emirates along the Persian Gulf had been integrated into the informal empire of the Raj for several decades.\n\n13Despite such similarities, once the lot of the former Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire was settled, suspicion pervaded the Franco-British relationship, probably because of the weight of history, as underlined by Toynbee in his Western Question:\n\n26 Toynbee, Western Question, p. 45.\n\nOne cannot understand—or make allowances for—the postwar relations of the French and British Governments over the 'Eastern Question' unless one realises this tradition of rivalry and its accumulated inheritance of suspicion and resentment. It is a bad mental background for the individuals who have to represent the two countries.\n\nThe “Fashoda spirit”: rivalry and mutual suspicions in the interwar years\n\n34 “Extract from report by Lt. Col. F.G. Peake, Officer Commanding the Arab Legion”, March 1924, CO 73 (...)\n\nThe reason why we cannot get good security, why we cannot arrest and hand over criminals, why the prestige of the Legion is low, why the officers are afraid to act, is the Amir Abdullah and some few Syrian anti-English, anti-French, anti-Jew, pro-their-own-pockets-only, officials who up to now have held all the posts of Government.\n\n18The British were confident that establishing a monarchy in Iraq and an emirate in Transjordan, both with local Arab governments, was the right way to rule their Middle Eastern mandates. They believed that this form of indirect rule would placate nationalists and give more legitimacy to the new political entities. Some of the British officials on the spot were convinced that Arab nationalism and British interests were compatible. For instance, Gertrude Bell, who as Oriental Secretary was a very close adviser to Percy Cox, the British High Commissioner in Iraq, strongly believed in an ideal Anglo-Arab partnership. Bell thought that indirect rule worked best when the personal relationships between British officials and Arab political players were excellent. In 1922, she wrote a letter in which she compared the relationship of Robert de Caix, Gouraud's closest civilian administrator, with the Syrians and the relationship between Percy Cox and the Iraqis:\n\n36 Gertrude Bell to her stepmother, Dame Florence Bell, 10 May 1922, Gertrude Bell Archive, Newcastle (...)\n\nThey [the French] are amazingly out of touch; there isn't the close personal link of acquaintance and knowledge between a man like de Caix and the Syrians that exists between any of our senior (or junior) officials and the native population of Iraq. It begins with us from the top, with Sir Percy and his amazing personal position, and not all the integrity and earnest desire to fulfill the responsibility he has undertaken can help M. de Caix and his like to bridge the void. In the first place none of them talk Arabic - just think what it means when you've got to establish intimate relations through an interpreter.\n\n22This shows that beyond the discourses which described two very different imperial paradigms, the strategies of the French and the British in the Middle East evolved and could draw inspiration from one another. Moreover, despite their mutual suspicion, the two mandatory powers had to cooperate on several issues.\n\nBeyond rivalry: cooperation, emulation and inspiration\n\n25In the 1930s, this British network of communication routes in the Middle East, which included air bases, roads and pipelines conveying oil to the Mediterranean coast, was an object of admiration for at least one French observer. Robert Montagne was an orientalist, ethnologist and sociologist who presided the French Institute of Damascus. In 1936, he wrote an article in which he undertook to study British methods in the Middle East. Even though his article coincided with the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, Montagne thought that the British imperial system in the Middle East was still to be reckoned with. He praised what he saw as a highly effective and pragmatic system which relied on the specific expertise of various men on the ground:\n\n47 Robert Montagne, “La Grande-Bretagne et la protection de la route des Indes”, Politique Etrangère, (...)\n\nEn Orient, la sécurité de l'Empire exige avant tout le maintien de moyens de communication et l'établissement d'une chaîne d'alliances entre les États. Par nature, cette politique voit grand, large et se préoccupe moins de réalisations durables que de combinaisons utiles. Ceux qui la mènent sont des marins, comme au Golfe Persique, des aviateurs en Irak, des spécialistes du désert au Nejd, en Transjordanie, au Sinaï, des diplomates à Bagdad. Tous ont en commun le désir d'utiliser les forces locales sans se laisser prendre par elles. Certes les fonctionnaires britanniques restent longtemps en Orient, mais ils ne prennent pas racine.\n\nConclusion\n\n31Ultimately, instances of rivalry or cooperation between the British and the French in the Middle East in the interwar years testify to the interconnectedness of colonial empires. The latter should not be considered political entities that were merely juxtaposed but rather ones whose interests sometimes clashed and sometimes overlapped. Despite the rivalry between them and the specificities of their respective imperial strategies, the British and the French shared the same imperial logic that was ultimately defeated by local resistance and a changing global context."
