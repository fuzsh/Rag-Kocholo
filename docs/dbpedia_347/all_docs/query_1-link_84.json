        "text": "After enjoying the success of his latest film Padmaavat, Shahid Kapoor has moved on to shoot for his next, Batti Gul Meter Chalu. The actor is currently in Tehri, Uttarakhand and shared a picture from his first day on sets on Instagram on Friday.\n\n“Day 1. On set. Batti Gul meter Chalu.Here we go. #goodpeople #goodvibes,” he posted with the picture of him riding a bike in a thick black jacket amid heavy security. The ‘mahurat shot’ was clapped by Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh. The film is to be shot in Tehri, Rishikesh, Dehradun and Mussoorie over the next two months.\n\nBatti Gul Meter Chalu is a social comedy drama which also stars Yami Gautam and Shraddha Kapoor. It is directed by Toilet: Ek Prem Katha’s Shree Narayan Singh.\n\n“Shree Narayan Singh, in Toilet Ek Prem Katha, talked about issues women faced with open defecation. Now he has chosen the electricity issue which will make the film very relatable to the common man,” Shahid had said about his film in a recent interview.\n\n“The story is based in Uttarakhand so I will be using a certain accent and dialect for the film. After playing a King, I will be seen as a small city lawyer,” he added. Yami also plays a lawyer in the film."
