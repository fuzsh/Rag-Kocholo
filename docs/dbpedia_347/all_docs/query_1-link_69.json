        "text": "The pandemic is in full force but the unlock down phase has allowed the film industry to slowly get back on track. The shooting of several films has commenced already. Shahid Kapoor who was filming for the Hindi remake of Telugu film, Jersey before the pandemic is all set to kick-start shooting for the film again from October.\n\nA source close to the film reveals that the shoot will take place in Dehradun and Chandigarh—\n\nShahid has already started brushing up his cricket skills and is ready to hit the pitch again. A 15-day schedule is planned from the first week of October. This is going to be one of the last remaining schedules. There will be one more schedule after this. The shoot is going to take place in Dehradun and Chandigarh.\n\nApart from the actor, the rest of the cast including Mrunal Thakur will also join the shoot.\n\nTalking about the schedule, the source went to add—\n\nShahid and Mrunal, among other actors, will be a part of the shoot. Shahid will restart his cricket training sessions. But this schedule won’t involve a lot of cricket. The next one would require him to play it.\n\nThe cast and crew of the film had been shooting in Chandigarh earlier this year when the announcement to stall all shoots, pre-production and post-production work came about. The unit will resume work following all the safety precautions.\n\n“Jersey was amongst the first films to stop shooting before the lockdown. The makers felt it was the right thing to do and it was necessary. Now the unit is taking all precautions that are mandatory as per the guidelines from the government and the industry,” the source says."
