And that is actually the day I decided to quit smoking.”\n\nShahid married Mira Rajput in July 2015. The couple have two kids– daughter Misha, and son Zain.\n\nOn the work front, Shahid was last seen in ‘Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya’, a science fiction romantic comedy co-starring Kriti Sanon.\n\nHe next has ‘Deva’ in the pipeline.\n\n‘No Filter Neha 6’ streams on JioTV and JioTV+.\n\nPriyanka Chopra gives sneak peek into MM’s ‘first hike’; fans gush over her voice\n\nMumbai– Global star Priyanka Chopra Jonas on Thursday shared the glimpses of her little bundle of joy Malti Marie’s (MM) first hike, sharing how she touched everything, jumped in puddles, calling the little angel as her ‘magic dust’.\n\nTaking to Instagram, where Priyanka enjoys 90.6 million followers, she shared a series of photos, and videos, wherein we can see MM wearing a leopard print jacket, full sleeves black T-shirt, and matching tights.

She kept her tresses open and opted for a no-makeup look. She was holding a ‘puja thali’ in her hands.\n\nA photographer asked Poonam: “Aap kaisi hain (How are you)?”, to which she replied laughing, “Ek dum first class (I am all good, first class)!”\n\nThe pap then jokingly said, “Aapne daraa diya (you had scared us).”\n\nPandey laughed and replied: “Aap darr gaye the, maine daraya bilkul bhi nahi tha (You got scared, but I did not try to scare you).”\n\n“Main darshan karke aayi (I am now going in for darshan),” she concluded and walked into the temple. The video then shows her praying inside the temple and bowing down to seek the blessings of the Almighty.\n\nStung by the widespread criticism of her ‘death stunt’, Pandey had defended herself, saying her effort ensured that the words ‘Cervical Cancer’ appeared in 500 news headlines on the same day.\n\nShivangi Verma to make her OTT debut with musical love story\n\nMumbai– ‘Choti Sarrdaarni’ fame actress Shivangi Verma is all set to make her OTT debut with a musical love story, saying it will take the audience on an emotional ride.\n\nShivangi, who will play a prominent role in the yet-to-be-titled show, said: “There are so many goosebump moments which will take the audience on an emotional trip. I am also an emotional person and that is why I connect with the story.”\n\nThe ‘Bhutu’ actress added: “I couldn’t be happier. I think every actor gets what they deserve in some way or other, and it’s such a great feeling. I chose this web show because of Nivedita Basu (Senior VP at Atrangii Group), as she has always been on my mind and I always wanted to work with her. And of course, I loved the musical love story.”\n\nThe project revolves around couples and their love affairs and heartbreaks.\n\nShivangi added: “I don’t know if it’s a happy or a sad ending, but tears will definitely roll down your eyes. And there won’t be a single scene where you can blink your eyes.”\n\nThe show will stream on Atrangii.\n\nUrmila recalls how SRK made co-actors feel comfortable at ‘Chamatkar’ shoot\n\nMumbai– Actress Urmila Matondkar reminisced about shooting with Shah Rukh Khan for the song ‘Is Pyaar Se Meri Taraf Na Dekho’ from the 1992 romantic comedy ‘Chamatkar’, calling him not only a great actor but also a lovely human being.\n\nUrmila appeared on the special episode of singing reality show ‘Indian Idol 14’.

Piyush, you have beautifully attempted the song. I remember filming with the iconic Shahrukh, who is not only a great actor but also a lovely human being.”\n\n“He is one of the finest actors who has also done theatre, he’s been humble since the beginning and he has an aura that makes his co-actors feel comfortable. I feel that the people who have worked with him and shared screen space with him are truly blessed,” shared Urmila.\n\nImpressed by Piyush’s performance, Urmila added: “You sang beautifully.
