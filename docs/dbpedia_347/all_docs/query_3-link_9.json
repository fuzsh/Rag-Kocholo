        "text": "In many Bollywood movies, the hero’s arrival in Mumbai is marked by a compulsory shot of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. But the city of dreams is much more than the heritage railway station famed for its Victorian Gothic revival architecture. While iconic spots like the Gateway of India and Marine Drive are predominantly featured in films, many directors have gone off the beaten track to choose locations that give you a well-rounded glimpse of the coastal city. Which Mumbai do you appreciate more—the dark and brooding world of Satya (1998) or the fresh, hopeful one of Wake Up Sid (2009)? Here are a few films to refresh your memories of the city that never sleeps.\n\nJaane Tu… Ya Jaane Na (2008)\n\nEvery time Aditi (Genelia D’Souza) feels blue, her best friend Jai (Imran Khan) knows he can find her at Bandra Fort. In fact, the one place their gang of friends likes to hang out at is the iconic Castella de Aguada. Many of the film’s sequences have been shot here, offering a beautiful view of the Arabian Sea, as well as at St Xavier’s College, which has probably never looked so dreamy before.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\nBombay Talkies (2013)\n\nFor many of the devoted fans, getting a glimpse of megastar Amitabh Bachchan outside his bungalow, Jalsa, every Sunday, is a sign that all is well in Mumbai. Anurag Kashyap’s short film Murabba, which was part of the anthology, Bombay Talkies, gave us more than that. The veteran actor opened his iconic mansion Prateeksha for shooting and for the very first time, viewers got to see not only him, but also a few spots of his house.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\nBombay (1995)\n\nA visibly lost Shaila (Manisha Koirala) stands outside the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, waiting for Shekhar (Arvind Swami) to turn up. And once he does, the city of Mumbai (then Bombay) welcomes the eloped lovers with open arms. The poster of the film shows Koirala and Swami posing against the backdrop of the Gateway of India, and that’s where the much-in-love couple often bring their twins for their evening excursions too.\n\nStreaming on Amazon Prime Video\n\nOK Jaanu (2017)\n\nIf you’ve never been to Mumbai and wouldn’t mind a tourist’s view of the city, then this Shraddha Kapoor- and Aditya Roy Kapoor-starrer might be a good place to start. From Oval Maidan to Asiatic Library, Eastern Express Highway, Marine Drive and more, Aditya (Roy Kapoor) and Tara (Kapoor) explore the city’s iconic spots, only to fall in love with each other in the process.\n\nStreaming on Amazon Prime Video\n\nDhobi Ghat (2010)\n\nDebutante filmmaker Kiran Rao once stated in an interview that Mumbai is the fifth character in her film that follows the lives of four people who are very different from each other, yet find a connection. That may well be true. Dhobi Ghat opens with a scene of a rain-drenched Marine Drive and follows it up with many beautifully-shot sequences of the metropolitan. This is not a tourist’s view but that of a native who recognises his city with its crowded lanes, cosy Irani bakeries and old neighbourhoods.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\nLage Raho Munna Bhai (2006)\n\nThe iconic Dhobi Talao appears prominently throughout the film, as does Sophia College of Women that exudes an old-world charm with its Victorian architecture.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\nThe Lunchbox (2013)\n\nIs there any sight more evident than that of the dabbawalas that will transport you straight to Mumbai? The famed lunch-delivery system, unique to the city, plays a major role in the mix-up that allows two strangers, Ila (Nimrat Kaur) and Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan) to exchange messages with each other. Those familiar with the area will also recognise Matunga’s vintage restaurant Koolar & Co, which features almost at the end of the critically-acclaimed film.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\nAlso read:\n\n7 movies that give you a culture-soaked tour of Kolkata, on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and more\n\n8 romantic Bollywood movies to watch during the monsoon, on Netflix and Amazon Prime Video\n\nRajasthan, New York, Tokyo: 9 movies that will take you on a virtual vacation"
