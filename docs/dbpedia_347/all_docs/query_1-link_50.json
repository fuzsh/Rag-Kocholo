        "text": "Bollywood actor Shahid Kapoor made his debut with the 2023 film Ishq Vishk. The actor has starred in several blockbusters and superhit films in a career span of 2 decades. For those unaware, Shahid appeared as a background dancer in several films. Also, he had a blink-and-miss appearance in the song Kahin Aag Lage Jaaye from the 1991 film Taal, starring Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. He was one of the dancers who was seen putting the white dupatta around the gorgeous actress.\n\nNow, in a recent interview, the actor recalled shooting with Aishwarya. While speaking with Radio Nasha, the actor said, “No one knows this, but that day I met with an accident. I used to ride my motorcycle and I fell off it. So, I remember I reached the set very flustered because I had fallen off and I was like, what just happened with me? And that was the day this happened with me. I’ll always remember it as the worst and the best day of my life at that time.”"
