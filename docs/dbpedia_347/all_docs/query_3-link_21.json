        "text": "Known to be the birthplace of Bollywood, and subsequently, Indian cinema, Bombay (now Mumbai) has been capturing several hearts for its superstars, glamour, movies and shooting locations. One must have visually explored the charm of Mumbai in its cinema, and Mumbaikars are quite proud of it. Scenic beaches, upscale markets, local stores, railway stations and airports – all have been extensively filmed when we talk about film shooting locations in Mumbai. Some of the most celebrated movies have been part of these sites, and today, they are popular tourist spots enjoyed by movie-buffers across the city. So, let’s read on and know more about the charms of shooting locations in Mumbai:\n\nColaba Causeway\n\nA fashionable shopping spot in South Mumbai, Colaba Causeway has upscale retail showrooms and roadside stalls selling footwear, perfumes, electronic goods and street food. Tourists can visit the nearby the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Museum and the National Gallery of Modern Art. Nicknamed the ‘Culture Square’, a part of “Talaash: The Answer Lies Within” (2012) was filmed here.\n\nChhatrapati Shivaji Terminus\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage site, the CSMT was earlier known as the Victoria Terminus. Several movies such as “Bunty Aur Babli” (2005), “Slumdog Millionnaire” (2008), “Ra.One” (2011) and “Chennai Express” (2013) were filmed here.\n\nThe Gateway of India\n\nAn illustrious monument, the Gateway of India overlooks the mighty Arabian Sea. Tourists usually come here for their sightseeing trips, restaurants, cafes, open-air markets and more. Movies such as “Bombay” (1995), “Hero No. 1” (1997), “Mann” (1999), “Kalyug” (2001) and “Ghajini” (2008) have been filmed along with several regional-language movies.\n\nMarine Drive\n\nA 3.6-kilometre-long boulevard in Mumbai is famous for its sea-and-sunset views, which has been captured in “Munnabhai MBBS” (2003), “Dhoom” (2004), and “Wake Up Sid!” (2009). With several restaurants, cafes and marketplaces near its proximity, this is one of the well-loved film and serial shooting places in Mumbai.\n\nThe Bandra-Worli Sea Link\n\nWell-known among locals and tourists alike, it’s an amazing drive on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link road, which connects the Western suburban area to the Nariman Point in South Bombay. It is equally known for its elaborate architecture with homes of several Bollywood stars before and after the stretch. Apart from the Sea Link, Carter Road, Jogger’s Park, Pali Hill and the Bandstand are famous shooting locations in Mumbai as well.\n\nMovies filmed here: “Ok Jaanu” (2019)\n\nDharavi\n\nDharavi rose to quick fame with the Oscar-winning “Slumdog Millionnaire” (2008) but was also known for movies such as “Deewar” (1975) “Salaam Bombay” (1988), “Footpath” (2003), “Traffic Signal” (2007), “Sarkar” (2018) and “Gully Boy” (2019). Though it is notorious for its unhygienic living conditions, Dharavi is home to the textile, recycling and pottery industry. Over the years, it has become one of the famous film shooting locations in Mumbai.\n\nFilm City\n\nThough most serial shooting places in Mumbai are set outdoors, there are bungalows for shooting in Mumbai as well. Film City has twenty indoor studios to display backdrops of cities, villages and interiors alike such as for “Ready” (2011) and “Bodyguard” (2011).\n\nTulsi Vihaar"
