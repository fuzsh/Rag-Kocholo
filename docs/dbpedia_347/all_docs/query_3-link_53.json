In 1977, Filmcity was established by the Govt of Maharashtra in Mumbai. Since then, Indian Cinema has come a long way, from simple silent movies to technically advanced films of the present-day.\n\nWhat makes Mumbai a City of Film?\n\nFilm Festivals\n\nMumbai hosts a number of national and international film events every year. The MAMI Film Festival showcases a variety of cinema from Bollywood and Hollywood. KASHISH, the Mumbai International Queer Film Festival is the first Indian LGBT festival and attracts some 8500 visitors a year.

Mumbai University has a series of film-making courses, while private school and colleges, headed by industry professionals, offer world-class learning in the field of acting, drama, theatre art, sound mixing, editing, cinematography and more.\n\nFilming Infrastructure\n\nFilmcity was established in 1977 by the Govt of Maharashtra in Mumbai. The complex is spread over 500 acres and has over 40 outdoor locations, 16 studios, film processing facilities and much more, along with a Single Window Portal for film-shooting permissions. Mumbai has a thriving post-production infrastructure at a world-class level, supported by specialised animation and VFX institutes.\n\nFilm Production\n\nA new state-funded project is working to overhaul the present Filmcity complex to provide world-class pre and post production facilities all in one place. The “Bollywood Square” will be a visual emblem depicting the excellence of cinema at Filmcity and offering a guided tour covering all aspects of filmmaking, from script to screen.\n\nIndustry Support & Initiatives\n\nMumbai City of Film champions accessibility to the film industry, a key sector providing employment opportunities. As part of a state-wide development plan, by 2034, Mumbai is working to create theatres, museums, parks, playgrounds, theme gardens, old age homes, shelters for the homeless, and encourage local economic development within the media sector.\n\nCity-wide Development\n\nMumbai will soon have the Maharashtra School of Drama and the National Centre of Excellence in Animation, Visual effects, Gaming and Comics, adding even more opportunities for media and arts education. Alongside these spaces, a new crime unit will focus on intellectual property rights, working to protect the interests of the growing creative community in the city.\n\nLatest News\n\nThis is the accordion body content.
