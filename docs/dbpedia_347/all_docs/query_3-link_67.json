        "text": "Maharashtra is at the forefront in providing the required infrastructure pertaining to filming in the country. More than half of movies made in India are produced in the state. It would be wise to say that Maharashtra has all the prerequisite resources required for the entire life cycle of film making.\n\nThe State has the highest number of film studios majorly located in the hub of Hindi Film Industry, Mumbai. They provide readymade sets, locations, outdoor shooting venues at one place thereby eliminating extra costs of visiting actual locations. There are plenty of options to choose from based on requirements and budget\n\nWhen it comes to outdoor locations, Maharashtra has almost all of them. Be it the serene western Ghats, beaches, waterfalls, forts, palaces, museums, railway stations, etc. There is no dearth of options to choose from. It spoils you in terms of indoor and outdoor locations. One just have to pick and choose based on the requirements.\n\nMaharashtra being the hub of Hindi film industry provides all the resources and technical know how for preparing the production of any form of media be it films, documentaries or advertisements. State has its film studios, animation studios, sound recording studios offering editing, sound mixing and VFX facilities\n\nThe film making process sounds incomplete without a reference to talent. The scriptwriters, cinematographers, actors, dancers, extras, spot boys and many more, each one of them put in their best to create a masterpiece on screen. Maharashtra has talent from all over the country that can be utilized in the process"
