        "text": "NEW DELHI — The Bollywood director Vishal Bhardwaj has made his name by adapting Shakespeare into film, using the plays to reflect the violence and vicissitudes of modern India. “Maqbool,” an adaptation of “Macbeth,” was set in the Mumbai underworld; “Omkara” transported “Othello” to the feudal badlands of northern India. His latest effort, a loose adaptation of “Hamlet” called “Haider” that takes place in Kashmir during the turbulent 1990s, has become one of the most acclaimed and contentious Bollywood movies of the year.\n\nThe film, which opened on Oct. 2, sparked a fierce reaction from Hindu nationalists, many of whom called for a boycott on social media. Kashmir remains a sensitive subject in the Indian subcontinent, a disputed territory claimed by both India and Pakistan.\n\n“Any movie that sympathizes with terrorists, glorifies them; insults Indian Army & justifies ethnic cleansing, goes to the bin. #BoycottHaider,” one tweet read. The boycott campaign’s Facebook page included a photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. That was not an accident: The election of the conservative Mr. Modi this year has emboldened Indians who advocate a muscular, unapologetic nationalism.\n\nMost journalists in India, meanwhile, gave the movie a rapturous reception. The columnist Mukul Kesavan, writing in the Kolkata Telegraph, said its “great achievement is to bring Kashmir out of the closet.” The Mint newspaper termed it an “immensely effective reimagination of Shakespeare.”"
