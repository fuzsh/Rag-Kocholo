        "text": "\"'Bull' is a full-blown action film inspired by real events from the life of Brigadier Bulsara. It is a privilege to play a paratrooper who leads his boys through a historic and selfless mission that has now become iconic for its precision and bravado. The opportunity to play a paratrooper is exhilarating and truly an honour,\" the 40-year-old said in a statement.\n\n\"We're all set to bring the audience an action extravaganza with our second collaboration with Shahid after 'Kabir Singh'. I'm elated that my association with Amar Butala and Garima Mehta could hold the key to great cinema,\" he said.\n\n\"We dedicate this film to men in uniforms and our soldiers who brave through unimaginable turmoil to guard this great nation's sovereignty. Shahid will be seen in an exciting avatar. This is also our first association with T- Series and I look forward to it,\" he added."
