Team #Jersey is suspending shoot so as to enable all unit members to be with their families and in the safety of their homes. Be responsible. Stay safe,” he wrote.\n\nApart from Jersey, many other films have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak and have called off shooting or release of films. Tamil actor Vikram’s upcoming film Cobra was recently cancelled in Russia due to the outbreak.\n\nRecently, the shoot of Salman Khan’s Radhe which was to be held in Thailand later this month, was also called off as several coronavirus cases were detected in the country. Around 82 cases of coronavirus infections have been reported in Thailand so far.\n\nThere have also been reports of a delay in the shoot of Brahmastra, but there has been no confirmation from the makers so far.\n\nThe release of the films Sooryavanshi and Sir have also been delayed."
