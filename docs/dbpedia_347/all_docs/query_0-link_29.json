        "text": "Director: Vikramaditya Motwane\n\nCast: Ranveer Singh, Sonakshi Sinha, Adil Hussain\n\nGenre: romance, thriller, musical\n\nVikramaditya Motwane re-imagined O Henry’s short story ‘The Last Leaf’ for this film about a simple girl, Pakhi (Sinha), who falls in love with a robber, Varun (Singh), when he arrives in her town pretending to be an archaeologist. Effectively recreating the 1950s era, complete with Dev Anand film songs playing on the radio, ‘Lootera’ brought together an ace technical team made up of production designer Aditya Kanwar and cinematographer Mahendra Shetty, who gave the film a distinct, lush period look.\n\nThe big scene\n\nA sick Pakhi steadily rejects Varun’s advances while he seeks refuge in her house after running away from the police.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nDirector: Mahesh Bhatt\n\nCast: Aamir Khan, Juhi Chawla\n\nGenre: romance, comedy\n\nIn this remake of Cary Grant’s ‘Houseboat’ (1958), Vyjayanti (Chawla), the bubbly daughter of a conservative Tamil family, escapes from an upcoming forced marriage and finds kindred spirits in three children who decide to hide her at their home, under the nose of their guardian Rahul (Khan). When Rahul discovers her, she becomes the children’s governess and what follows is a story of love between opposites. A wonderfully sweet soundtrack accompanies this delightful, light and entertaining family comedy.\n\nThe big scene\n\nWhen Rahul finally stands up for Vyjayanti’s honour in defiance of his boss.\n\nShai Hussain\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: MS Sathyu\n\nCast: Balraj Sahni, Farooque Shaikh, AK Hangal\n\nGenre: history, drama\n\nAlso known as ‘Scorching Winds’, this is perhaps the most important and accurate Indian film to depict the plight of minority Muslims in northern India following Partition in 1947. Set in the late 1940s, Salim (Sahni), an elderly Muslim shoemaker must decide whether or not to leave his ancestral home in Agra and migrate across the border to newly-created Pakistan. Meanwhile, Hindu-Muslim tensions at home threaten to rip apart his family. Director MS Sathyu, a Marxist activist, created a heart-wrenching tale of innocent lives torn apart by hatred and suspicion. Balraj Sahni’s noble performance will move you to tears, and the issues are equally relevant to India today.\n\nThe big scene\n\nWhen the grandmother hides away in order to stay in her ‘home’.\n\nAnil Sinanan\n\nDirector: Guru Dutt\n\nCast: Guru Dutt, Madhubala, Johnny Walker\n\nGenre: comedy\n\nDirector Guru Dutt uses a familiar plot to hilarious effect in this satire of India’s urban upper class in the post-independence period. Anita (Madhubala) can only inherit her father’s wealth if she gets married – leading her feminist aunt to suggest that she goes through a ‘fake’ marriage with cartoonist Preetam (Dutt) and then ‘divorce’ as soon as possible afterwards. But, of course, both Anita and Preetam fall in love… Dutt’s unique directing style is put to inventive use during the songs: the camera appears never to sit still. The film is best remembered today for the tunes sung by Geeta Dutt (the director’s wife) and for being truly funny. It’s an irresistible and impeccably cast film.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe heroine’s swimming-pool song – which comes complete with charming chorus girls twirling umbrellas.\n\nAnil Sinanan\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Sachin Kundalkar\n\nCast: Rani Mukerji, Prithviraj, Anita Date\n\nGenre: romance, comedy, musical\n\nFilmmaker Sachin Kundalkar took one of three parallel stories he previously told in the 2009 Marathi-language film ‘Gandha’ and turned it into a madcap Hindi comedy with fantasy elements. Meenakshi (Mukerji) falls in love with Tamil boy Surya (Prithviraj) after she’s drawn to his smell. The bizarre characters around Meenakshi include her father, who smokes four cigarettes at once; a grandmother with gold teeth; and her friend Mynah (a superb Date), who has a weird Lady Gaga obsession.\n\nThe big scene\n\nMeenakshi finds herself fantasising about romancing with Surya while dancing to an archetypal Tamil cinema-inspired song that’s garish, vulgar and full of pelvic thrusts.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nDirector: Raj Kapoor\n\nCast: Shashi Kapoor, Zeenat Aman\n\nGenre: romance\n\nRaj Kapoor’s attempt to portray the conflict between the sacred and the profane, and to show that beauty is only skin deep, is an admittedly patchy affair. When engineer Ranjeev (Shashi Kapoor) hears the religious songs sung by ‘ugly’ village belle Rupa (Aman), he is convinced her face will be as beautiful as her voice. He marries her without seeing her, so the shallow groom is understandably upset on his wedding night. It’s a flawed masterpiece that is guilty of exactly of what it purports to criticise. But it’s also groundbreaking for its sexual explicitness, including wet kisses. Excellent soundtrack, too.\n\nThe big scene\n\nAny scene with lead actress Zeenat Aman: she is practically topless for most of the film.\n\nAnil Sinanan\n\nAdvertising\n\n54. Baahubali: The Beginning & Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2015, 2017)\n\nDirector: SS Rajamouli\n\nCast: Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Tamannaah Batia, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan, Sathyaraj, Nassar\n\nGenre: fantasy, action, musical\n\nThese blockbusters play like the Bollywood ‘Black Panther’. Inspired by Indian mythology and the Amar Chitra Katha comic-book series, director SS Rajamouli’s two-part fantasy epic about a young man, Shivudu, who later discovers his name is Mahendra Baahubali (don’t ask, it’s complicated), offers some of the most spectacular Indian cinema ever made. Both films blend high fantasy and action with an almost Shakespearean sense of drama, resulting in a double bill that knows when to rein it in. Just. Like the ‘Wakanda forever!’ salute in ‘Black Panther’, ‘Baahubali’ will always be associated with the chant ‘Jai Mahishmathi’.\n\nThe big scene\n\nWhen Mahendra Baahubali’s father, Amarendra shows off his strength by lifting a gargantuan statute of the Hindu god Shiva, preventing it from falling and killing people.\n\nAshanti Omkar\n\nDirector: Abrar Alvi\n\nCast: Meena Kumari, Rehman, Guru Dutt, Waheeda Rehman\n\nGenre: drama\n\n‘Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam’ is a period film about the end of an era. Abrar Alvi’s adaptation of a Bengali novel by Bimal Mitra is about the stormy relationship between a rich, decadent business owner (Rehman), his lovelorn wife (Meena Kumari) and their young servant (Guru Dutt). It’s all told against the backdrop of the last days of the old system of zamindari (a way of collecting tax) in colonial, nineteenth-century Bengal. Shot with great sensitivity and innovation by Guru Dutt’s main man VK Murthy, ‘Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam’ is a more romantic twin to Satyajit Ray’s ‘Jalsaghar’.\n\nThe big scene\n\nA drunk Kumari pleads with her arrogant husband to stay and make love to her via the song ‘Na jao saiyan’ – a bold scene back then.\n\nVarun Grover\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: N Chandra\n\nCast: Anil Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit, Anupam Kher\n\nGenre: romance, drama\n\nActor Anil Kapoor followed his 1987 super-hit ‘Mr India’ with this film (the title means ‘Acid’) that gave actress Madhuri Dixit her breakout role, swept the box office and won four Filmfare awards (Bollywood’s equivalent to the Oscars). It tells of a criminal, Munna (Kapoor), trying to get himself back on the right side of the law while also attempting to rescue his love, Mohini (Dixit), from the grasp of her villainous father. It’s passionate and violent.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe song and video for ‘Ek Do Teen’ (‘One Two Three’) by composer duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal put actress and dance queen Dixit firmly on the Bollywood map.\n\nAshanti Omkar\n\nDirector: Raj Kapoor\n\nCast: Raj Kapoor, Vyjayanthimala, Rajendra Kumar\n\nGenre: drama, romance\n\nThis is cinema as love song. Two best friends from childhood, Sunder (Kapoor) and Gopal (Kumar) love the same girl, Radha (Vyjayanthimala). She marries Sunder, the one she doesn’t love, but then he goes missing at war. When Sunder returns, the discovery of an old love letter sows seeds of suspicion and friendships are tested. The standard love-triangle template is made exotic by Shankar-Jaikishan’s timeless music and Raj Kapoor’s love for foreign locales.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe accusatory song on piano – ‘Dost dost na raha’ (‘Friend did not remain a friend’) – is one of a kind in Hindi cinema (a man berating another man for trying to steal his woman), and the most intense point of the film.\n\nVarun Grover\n\nDirector: Imtiaz Ali\n\nCast: Ranbir Kapoor, Nargis Fakhri, Aditi Rao Hydari\n\nGenre: musical, romance, drama\n\nRanbir Kapoor embodied the film’s tortured, Jim Morrison-like protagonist Jordan so convincingly that he had to keep reminding people that he wasn’t a real rock star. Jordan is one of Indian cinema’s most complex male characters. This, as well as glimpses of hidden India – like Nizamuddin Dargah, the mausoleum of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya, in Delhi – and the last appearance of Bollywood legend Shammi Kapoor (‘Junglee’) make ‘Rockstar’ a noteworthy addition to the rock biopic pantheon.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe heart-wrenching montage during the song ‘Nadaan Parindey’ as we see Jordan overcome with debilitating grief.\n\nAshanti Omkar\n\nDirector: Farah Khan\n\nCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Sushmita Sen, Sunil Shetty\n\nGenre: comedy, drama\n\nMilitary man Ram (Khan) goes undercover as a university student in the name of peace between India and Pakistan. While stalking the villain, Ram also loses his heart to a chemistry professor. ‘Main Hoon Na’ exists in a knowingly meta world where global superstar Shah Rukh Khan involuntarily bursts into song every time Miss Universe (Sen) glides by. The film dances that fine line between parody and celebration like no mainstream Hindi film before or since. It’s a celebration of all things filmi – family reunions, the redemptive power of love, fantasies played out in song – while also reveling in how ridiculous it can all be.\n\nThe big scene\n\nIn front of a huge crowd, Ram saves the life of his younger brother, who’s about to fall to his death from the roof of the university. One onlooker nicknames him ‘Rambo’.\n\nBeth Watkins\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Vikas Bahl\n\nCast: Kangana Ranaut, Rajkummar Rao, Lisa Haydon\n\nGenre: drama, musical\n\nA fiercely original filmmaking style and a novel plot made ‘Queen’ stand apart from all other 2014 releases, helping it to emerge as a critical and box-office hit. In a career-altering performance, Kangana Ranaut plays Rani, a sheltered small-town girl who decides to go on her honeymoon to Europe alone after she’s jilted at the altar. Writer-director Vikas Bahl displays a strong flair for capturing human behaviour and peppers a simple story with lovable characters and witty lines.\n\nThe big scene\n\nRani’s ex-lover begs her to return, but she simply thanks him for cancelling their wedding and thereby allowing her to discover herself.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nDirector: Raj Kapoor\n\nCast: Raj Kapoor, Simi Garewal, Rishi Kapoor\n\nGenre: romance, biopic\n\nDirector-star Raj Kapoor’s semi-autobiographical magnum opus is four hours of self-loathing angst, which crashed at the box office and almost bankrupted the director-actor. A sad clown, Raju (Kapoor), invites the women he loved and lost in his life to his last ever performance. Told in three ‘chapters’, this overlong film is awash with iffy symbolism about the meaning of life, exhibits a questionable attitude towards women and is burdened with a mother-fixation subplot. But for all its flaws, this is no-holds-barred epic filmmaking with a moving soundtrack.\n\nThe big scene\n\nRaju’s mother collapses and dies just as he’s about to perform – but the show must go on.\n\nAnil Sinanan\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Karan Johar\n\nCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Rani Mukerji\n\nGenre: romance, musical\n\nDirector Karan Johar began his association with Shah Rukh Khan with this romantic drama partly inspired by the Archie-Veronica-Betty trio in the American Archie comics. Rahul (Khan) and Anjali (Kajol) are best friends studying in the same college, but the tomboyish Anjali is threatened by the arrival of Tina (Mukerji). Years later, widower Rahul reconnects with Anjali. The film was a runaway hit, best remembered for Khan and Kajol’s sizzling chemistry and Jatin-Lalit’s music.\n\nThe big scene\n\nAnjali is unaware that one of her students, also named Anjali, is actually Rahul and Tina’s daughter. Then she watches Rahul on TV, who sends out a message about how much he misses ‘Anjali’.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nDirector: Mani Ratnam\n\nCast: Kamal Haasan, Saranya, Nasser\n\nGenre: crime, thriller\n\n‘Nayakan’, the original, 1987 Tamil version of this film, was dubbed into Hindi in 1999 to become ‘Velu Nayakan’. An epic crime movie, it’s loosely based on the life of Varadarajan Mudaliar (here becoming Velu Nayakan, played by Haasan), a real mafia slumlord in Bombay, and also explores the struggle of south Indians living in the city. It drew inspiration from Francis Ford Coppola’s ‘The Godfather’. The song ‘Thenpandi cheemaiyile’ tops a much-admired soundtrack by veteran Indian film composer Ilaiyaraaja, who has now scored over 1000 films in his career.\n\nThe big scene\n\nYou’re bound to feel an emotional tug every time you hear the song ‘Sitam Ki Andhi’ (‘Who has hit you?’) sung by Bollywood stalwart Hariharan.\n\nAshanti Omkar\n\nAdvertising\n\n44. Enthiran: The Robot (2010)\n\nDirector: S Shankar\n\nCast: Rajinikanth, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Akshay Kumar Amy Jackson\n\nGenre: Sci-fi, action\n\nMononymous superstar Rajinikanth has a loyal following all across Asia, including Japan, and has over 160 films under his illustrious belt. Enthiran and its sequel, 2.0, are the most famous of his pan-Indian films and have been dubbed into several languages. Scientist Vaseegaran (Rajinikanth) creates an humanoid robot called Chitti (also played by Rajinikanth) for the Indian army, only for it to go rogue. Director S Shankar throws in huge amounts of CGI to bring Chitti to life in a splurge of mind-blowing weaponry. The two films delve into the ethics of a robot who begins to think – but you will absolutely not need to.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe robot multiplies and then creates shapes that attack anything coming after it. It is both ludicrous and eye popping at the same time, especially when it turns into a snake and then an Optimus Prime-type transformer.\n\nDirector: Sooraj Barjatya\n\nCast: Salman Khan, Bhagyashree, Alok Nath\n\nGenre: romance, drama\n\nPrem (Khan), a boy from a wealthy family, pursues forbidden love with working-class girl Suman (Bhagyashree). So far, so Bollywood, but ‘Maine Pyar Kiya’ managed simultaneously to kickstart megastar Salman Khan’s career, cement director Sooraj Barjatya’s box-office clout and redefine romance and friendship in Bollywood in a way that wasn’t bettered for years. Released in a decade signified by violent masala flicks, this family-friendly film with an evergreen soundtrack and iconic dialogue was immediately and widely admired.\n\nThe big scene\n\nWhen Prem and Suman attend a party and their boy-girl friendship is mocked, Prem stands up for Suman’s honour and they fall in love. Obviously.\n\nShai Hussain\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Rajkumar Santoshi\n\nCast: Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn\n\nGenre: drama, action, thriller\n\nAmitabh Bachchan broke on to the scene with the role of angst-ridden cop Vijay in ‘Zanjeer’ (1973). ‘Khakee’ explores what would have happened to the character 30 years later. Vijay is an honest policeman who gets entangled in an operation that involves transferring a terrorist from a small village to the city. But as the ageing officer and his team go about their mission, they realise there are influential people who want the terrorist dead – so their lives are in danger too.\n\nThe big scene\n\nBachchan berates another cop for being a puppet of the establishment – it’s exactly the kind of monologue we’ve come to associate with the actor over the years.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nDirector: Ritesh Batra\n\nCast: Irrfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur, Nawazuddin Siddiqui\n\nGenre: romance, drama, comedy\n\nRitesh Batra’s debut film turned out to be India’s most popular export in recent times, with rave reviews at Cannes followed by a wide release in the US, where the film ended up among the highest-grossing foreign-language films of the year. Simply structured yet purposeful, ‘The Lunchbox’ focuses on the lives of two lonely individuals, Saajan (Khan) and Ila (Kaur). Both jostle for some peace and happiness amid the buzz and mayhem of Mumbai, as they share notes through a tiffin box delivered back and forth.\n\nThe big scene\n\nSaajan is invited to dinner by his lowly colleague Shaikh (Siddiqui), and he bonds with Shaikh and his girlfriend.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nDirector: Mani Ratnam\n\nCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Manisha Koirala, Preity Zinta\n\nGenre: romance, drama, musical\n\n‘Dil Se..’ was acclaimed south Indian filmmaker Mani Ratnam’s big plunge into Bollywood, achieved by teaming up with superstar Shah Rukh Khan. A box-office failure at the time, this story of a Delhi journalist falling in love with a terrorist has gained popularity in the years since. Ratnam’s interest in political issues may have clashed with Khan’s lover-boy image at the time, but at least the actor has one solid drama in his otherwise monotonous filmography.\n\nThe big scene\n\nAce cinematographer Santosh Sivan shot Khan and Malaika Arora on top of a moving train dancing to AR Rahman’s ‘Chaiyya Chaiyya’, a song that would go on to become a national hit.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nDirector: Karan Johar\n\nCast: Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Hrithik Roshan\n\nGenre: melodrama, romance, musical\n\n‘It’s all about loving your parents,’ screamed the trailer for ‘Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham…’, a film that piled on the mush in true Karan Johar (‘My Name is Khan’) style. Here, Johar brought together a dream cast to play a fractured family. Billionaire Yashvardhan (Bachchan) is an authoritarian who banishes his adopted son Rahul (Khan) for marrying a woman against his wishes. Years later, Raj’s brother Rohan (Roshan) strives to bring the family together. Boasting opulent production design, lavish musical set pieces and an orgy of superstars, ‘K3G’ (as the film came to be known) is guilty-pleasure Bollywood at its best.\n\nThe big scene\n\nRahul and Rohan reunite after several years. Sat on a park bench, Rahul asks Rohan questions about things they had talked about when Rohan was just a kid.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Ashutosh Gowariker\n\nCast: Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Sonu Sood\n\nGenre: historical, romance, drama\n\nThis story of real-life Mughal emperor Akbar (Roshan) and his Hindu wife Jodhaa (Bachchan) doesn’t exactly follow the facts. But when artistic license is exercised so beautifully, who cares? Ashutosh Gowariker, director of the Oscar-nominated ‘Lagaan’, executes a perfect balance of spectacle, performances, ideas and story, never sacrificing the entertainment factor and allowing us to bask in the costumes and production design. He drenches his always-timely message of respect for all faiths in immeasurable imperial pomp.\n\nThe big scene\n\nA sizzling sword fight between the emperor and the princess, a woman with serious physical presence who refuses to bow her head.\n\nBeth Watkins\n\nDirector: AR Murugadoss\n\nCast: Aamir Khan, Asin, Jiah Khan\n\nGenre: romance, thriller\n\nBearing many similarities to Christopher Nolan’s ‘Memento’, this way-over-the-top thriller leans heavily on its main character’s short-term-memory loss. Sanjay (Aamir Khan) is a leading Indian businessman, while Kalpana (Asin), a model, brags to everyone that she is Sanjay’s girl even though they’ve never met. When Sanjay discovers this, he decides to confront her but soon falls in love. However, Kalpana falls foul of a local crime lord and Sanjay is determined to avenge her death… ‘Ghajini’ was an enormous hit in India.\n\nThe big scene\n\nSanjay is attacked by gangsters and suffers short-term amnesia. He tattoos memory prompts all over his body. Heard that somewhere before?\n\nAnushka Arora\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Yash Chopra\n\nCast: Amitabh Bachchan, Shashi Kapoor, Shatrugan Sinha\n\nGenre: action, crime, thriller, historical\n\nThe common man’s exploitation by greedy industrialists is the theme of ‘Kaala Patthar’, which loosely references the 1975 Chasnala disaster in which 375 miners drowned. Amitabh Bachchan plays sullen loner Vijay, a disgraced naval officer who abandoned a sinking ship; Shashi Kapoor is clean-cut engineer Ravi; and Shatrugan Sinha is escaped convict Mangal. Despite Ravi’s protests, the mine owner sacrifices safety for profit, but when the mine is flooded the trio unites. ‘Kaala Patthar’ wears its proletarian heart on its sleeve.\n\nThe big scene\n\nWhen the mine siren sounds, the entire workforce and surrounding village rush to help. It’s a striking symbol of the power of the collective over the individual.\n\nRahul Verma\n\nDirector: Shimit Amin\n\nCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Shilpa Shukla, Vidya Malvade\n\nGenre: sports, drama, musical\n\nBetween clever gangster movie ‘Ab Tak Chhappan’ (2004) and the grossly underrated ‘Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year’ (2009), director Shimit Amin teamed up with writer Jaideep Sahni to give us this quintessential sports drama. The film narrates the story of a tainted ex-India hockey player (Khan) who coaches the women’s team to World Cup glory. While sticking to the underdog-overcomes-obstacles template, Amin and Sahni deftly weave in themes of cultural diversity, religious difference and feminism.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe girls’ team goes up against the boys’ national team, winning the respect of the opposing team and the selectors.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Kabir Khan\n\nCast: Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif, Ranvir Shorey\n\nGenre: action, romance\n\nSalman Khan adds a dash of cosmopolitan sophistication to his special brand of machismo with this story involving espionage and a love affair with an enemy agent (Kaif). As Tiger, Khan adheres to the muscle-man template, but he also struggles over questions of loyalty to his lady or his country – a complexity not always afforded to India’s defenders. This same dilemma is mirrored in Tiger’s colleague, Gopi (Shorey), who may have to rat out his friend.\n\nThe big scene\n\nTiger crashes through Dublin’s public transport system – a proud addition to the tradition of Bollywood heroes wreaking havoc in foreign locales.\n\nBeth Watkins\n\nDirector: Shyam Benegal\n\nCast: Shabana Azmi, Anant Nag\n\nGenre: drama\n\n‘Ankur’ is the film that kickstarted an ‘arty-indie’ parallel film movement in Hindi cinema in the 1970s and early ’80s. Shyam Benegal’s directorial debut introduces Shabana Azmi (‘India’s Meryl Streep’) as Laxmi, the servant-wife of a deaf and dumb untouchable potter. Laxmi falls pregnant by bored middle-class student Surya (Nag) at his family’s holiday farmhouse. The rest of this admirable and realistic film explores the fallout from these events and bravely adopts a strong feminist stance. Gritty and political, this is an elegiac and essential rural melodrama.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe film’s final sequence: a young boy throws a brick at the landlord’s house, suggesting that the unfair social order may soon change, even violently.\n\nAnil Sinanan\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Hrishikesh Mukherjee\n\nCast: Amol Palekar, Utpal Dutt, Bindiya Goswami, Dina Pathak\n\nGenre: comedy\n\nWhere it all started. At least two generations of Indians will count this as the best homegrown comedy ever made, and with good reason. Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s immensely well-crafted comedy of double identities has Ramprasad (Amol Palekar) doubling up as his non-existent twin brother and wearing a fake moustache, just to convince his new boss Bhavani (Utpal Dutt) that it wasn’t him at a sports match. Throw in a couple of fake mums, the boss’s daughter who is in love with the other ‘brother’, a drunk Keshto Mukherjee and screenwriter Rahi Masoom Raza’s memorable lines, and this is a comedy for all seasons.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe moment when Bhavani finally realises Ramprasad’s lie while he is gorging on parathas approaches comedy nirvana.\n\nVarun Grover\n\nDirector: Anurag Basu\n\nCast: Ranbir Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra\n\nGenre: adventure, comedy, romance\n\nA success driven by word of mouth, ‘Barfi!’ observes the magical relationship between an autistic woman, Jhilmil (Chopra), and a deaf-mute guy, Barfi (Kapoor). The film has the air of a fairytale, and Kapoor’s twinkly-eyed, vividly expressive performance as the title character evokes Charlie Chaplin as well as his own grandfather, Raj Kapoor. ‘Barfi!’ announced Kapoor as a credible actor and rising superstar rather than just a pretty boy. He is the fourth generation of the Kapoor family to star in Hindi movies.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe song ‘Kyon’ sees a gentle acoustic guitar accompany Barfi’s attempts to move on from the fairytale world of the film. However, wherever Barfi turns, Jhilmil follows and as it dawns on him that she’s the one, the lush green landscape glows in approval.\n\nRahul Verma\n\nDirector: Raj Kapoor\n\nCast: Rishi Kapoor, Padmini Kolhapure\n\nGenre: drama\n\nRaj Kapoor tackles the controversial subject of widows remarrying with this stark critique of old-fashioned family and tenancy structures, all framed within a big, commercial movie. It’s held together by teenage actress Padmini Kolhapure, who is utterly convincing and sympathetic as the unlucky bride who discovers the true meaning of love. There are rough edges to ‘Prem Rog’ and some hammy acting, but ultimately its liberal and progressive stance wins you over.\n\nThe big scene\n\nA climax sees a widow who dared to love about to be executed by being burnt alive on a cross.\n\nAnil Sinanan\n\nDirector: Hrishikesh Mukherjee\n\nCast: Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, Johnny Walker\n\nGenre: drama, tragedy, musical\n\nReigning superstar Rajesh Khanna plays the title character, whose days are numbered after he’s diagnosed with cancer. The film explores his relationship with his doctor, Bhaskar, played by a young Amitabh Bachchan (who would famously oust Khanna from the box-office top spot a few years later). Anand’s positive outlook on life and his playful demeanour is a lesson for those around him, even as Bhaskar, a more serious man, struggles with his inability to reverse Anand’s medical condition. Apart from the performances, the film is memorable for Salil Chowdhury’s score.\n\nThe big scene\n\nBhaskar cries over Anand’s body, hysterically demanding that his dead friend speak again, when a voice recording left behind by Anand starts to play…\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Yash Chopra\n\nCast: Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Rekha\n\nGenre: romance\n\nYash Chopra’s most infamous film is based on the alleged real-life affair between Bollywood’s biggest star, Amitabh Bachchan, and the ultimate diva, actress Rekha. Outrageously, Bachchan persuaded his actress wife, Jaya, to come out of retirement to play his screen wife and his alleged mistress, Rekha, to act in this silly film as his screen mistress. Chopra’s attempt to romanticise adultery via tuneful songs results in a somewhat sleazy film with a traditional cop-out ending. Today, it’s regarded as a flawed cult classic due to its controversial casting and tuneful soundtrack.\n\nThe big scene\n\nWhen real/reel wife and real/reel mistress meet in a highly-charged confrontational scene and both agree to fight for their man.\n\nAnil Sinanan\n\nDirector: Zoya Akhtar\n\nCast: Hrithik Roshan, Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar\n\nGenre: comedy, adventure, drama, road movie\n\nTranslated as ‘You only live once’, this buddy-meets-mid-life-crisis movie sees three friends take a road trip in Spain: Arjun (Roshan) is a workaholic; Imraan (Farhan Akhtar) wants to track down his biological father; and Kabir (Deol) is unsure about his upcoming wedding. ‘Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara’ had a message for middle-class Indians living the new liberal dream with well-paid jobs: it’s okay not to conform or to have a happily-ever-after romance.\n\nThe big scene\n\nAs the friends do Pamplona’s bull run – in slow motion – there’s a voiceover of Akhtar’s character, Imraan, reciting a poem about being free. The poem is written by Akhtar’s screenwriter father, Javed (‘Sholay’, ‘Deewar’). How meta is that?\n\nRahul Verma\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Ramesh Sippy\n\nCast: Amitabh Bachhan, Shashi Kapoor, Kulbhushan Kharbanda\n\nGenre: action, comedy, thriller\n\nUnderrated excellence: Ramesh Sippy’s follow-up to his career-defining ‘Sholay’ (1975) rode in on high expectations and left many viewers underwhelmed. But this story of two conmen (Bachhan and Kapoor) mending their ways and collaborating with a sharpshooter (Shatrughan Sinha) to avenge the death of their cop brother at the hands of the dreaded Shakaal (Kharbanda, in a stunning debut) has aged very well. The cons are very original and the scale of the film extravagantly ambitious.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe first image of Shakaal with his shiny, bald head and his punishment aquarium full of crocodiles and sharks sticks long in the memory.\n\nVarun Grover\n\nDirector: Vidhu Vinod Chopra\n\nCast: Jackie Shroff, Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar\n\nGenre: crime, drama, romance\n\nThe quintessential Bollywood crime film, ‘Parinda’ tells of street-kid brothers Kishen (Shroff) and Karan (Kapoor). When Karan returns after completing his education abroad, he realises his brother has become a gangster working for Anna (Patekar). Boasting of some fine editing by the late Renu Saluja and stellar sound design, the film came to be known for director Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s noir treatment, and all round brilliant acting.\n\nThe big scene\n\nKaran meets his childhood buddy, police officer Prakash, at Kabutarkhana (pigeon house), where the latter is gunned down by Anna’s henchmen. A shattered Karan is left holding his best friend’s lifeless, bullet-ridden body.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Imtiaz Ali\n\nCast: Shahid Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor, Dara Singh\n\nGenre: romance, musical, comedy\n\nA winning second film from Imtiaz Ali, Jab We Met is the defining romantic comedy of a generation. Genuinely funny and heartwarming, it starts out as the classic story of the lost manchild, Aditya (Shahid Kapoor), encountering the female embodiment of joie de vivre, Geet (Kareena Kapoor), whose effervescent outlook changes his life. But before you can shout ‘manic pixie dream girl!’, their roles are reversed, with Geet’s heartbreak and subsequent descent into depression tended to by the newly go-getting Aditya. In effect, he must bring back to her the joy and zest she bequeathed to him.\n\nThe big scene:\n\nAs Geet prepares to run away from home and reunite with her secret lover, Aditya asks her why she’s playing with her life like this. ‘Because it’s my favourite game!’ she replies.\n\nSahir Avik D’souza\n\nDirector: Raj Kapoor\n\nCast: Raj Kapoor, Nargis, Nadira, Nemo\n\nGenre: drama, romance, musical\n\nLead actor and director Raj Kapoor modelled his on-screen persona in ‘Shree 420’ and other films after Charlie Chaplin’s Little Tramp. Here he plays Raj, who comes to Bombay to earn a living and falls in love with Vidya (Nargis). However, Raj’s need to make quick money leads him to collaborate with corrupt businessman Dharmanand (Nemo) and his associate, the temptress Maya (Nadira). The film reflected a general state of unrest among unemployed youth and an increasing class divide in the country at the time.\n\nThe big scene\n\nRaj is lured to a party by Maya (which means desire), with the song ‘Mudh Mudh Ke Na Dekh’ (‘Don’t Look Back’), as Vidya (which means education) cries outside the venue.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Farah Khan\n\nCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Arjun Rampal\n\nGenre: satire, romance, musical\n\nA runaway hit on release, ‘Om Shanti Om’ achieved what other similar films before it had tried and largely failed to do – to satirise the idiosyncrasies of the Hindi film industry. ‘Om Shanti Om’ manages this while wearing the garb of a clichéd reincarnation story. Om (Khan) is a junior artist in love with superstar Shanti (Padukone) in the 1970s. Shanti, though, is in love with a wily producer, Mukesh Mehra (Rampal), who has her killed. In the present day, Om is now a superstar out to exact revenge on Mehra, now settled in Hollywood.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe film’s climactic scene borrowed from Bimal Roy’s 1958 classic, ‘Madhumati’, and sees Shanti’s spirit return to help Om complete his revenge against Mehra.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nDirector: Yash Chopra\n\nCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Karisma Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit, Akshay Kumar\n\nGenre: romance, musical\n\nThis musical romance and box-office hit explores the love lives of dancers in a musical troupe. There’s Rahul (Khan), who does not understand how two people can fall in love. Pooja (Dixit) believes in the idea of soulmates and lives by the statement that ‘someone, somewhere is made for you’. Lastly, we have Nisha and her belief that love starts as friendship and two good friends have the potential to love one another right to the end. ‘Dil To Pagal Hai’ is remembered as one of the late Yash Chopra’s best.\n\nThe big scene\n\nRahul and Pooja finally confess their feelings for each other in front of a large audience in a climactic scene guaranteed to bring audiences to tears. After all, ‘dil to pagal hai’ (‘the heart is crazy’), right?\n\nAnushka Arora\n\nDirector: Raj Kapoor\n\nCast: Prithviraj Kapoor, Raj Kapoor, Nargis\n\nGenre: family courtroom drama\n\nKnown as The Show Man, Raj Kapoor’s most famous film is a grand Oedipal melodrama exploring the nature-versus-nurture debate. Will a bandit’s son always end up a criminal? ‘Awara’ explores class division in newly independent India, which excludes the film’s lowly ‘tramp’ hero, Raj (Raj Kapoor), at every point. Its surprise success outside India – especially in the USSR, Africa, China, Greece and the West Indies – was directly responsible for introducing the world to mainstream Hindi cinema.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe nine-minute dance number, ‘Ghar Aya Mera Pardesi’ (‘My lover has come home’), sung by Lata Mangeshkar, is a dream sequence famous for its elaborate sets.\n\nAnil Sinanan\n\nDirector: Rajkumar Santoshi\n\nCast: Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon\n\nGenre: comedy, romance, musical\n\nRajkumar Santoshi’s ‘Andaz Apna Apna’ brought together two young, up-and-coming superstars, but the resulting film was a box-office failure. Its cult has grown over the years, spawning fan clubs and websites and ensuring record television ratings time after time. Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan) are wastrels who both want to marry a rich heiress, but they become involved in a feud involving warring twin brothers and a buffoonish villain, Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor).\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe film’s extended climax, during which all the characters fight over a bag of diamonds in a warehouse, boasts immense repeat value.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Farhan Akhtar\n\nCast: Aamir Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Saif Ali Khan\n\nGenre: coming-of-age, drama, romance\n\nBefore the dawn of India’s urban multiplex culture in the mid-2000s, director Farhan Akhtar made his debut with this coming-of-age tale about three Mumbai boys whose language reflected how regular people talked – a refreshing change from other Bollywood films of the time. Akhtar has never been able to better his first film, but with ‘Dil Chahta Hai’ he ushered in a style of storytelling that was new to Indian audiences, where everything from the dialogue and design to the music was subtle and realistic.\n\nThe big scene\n\nDuring the song ‘Tanhayee’, the Melbourne skyline whizzes by Aamir Khan, who is far from home and desolate after learning about the marriage of his lover to another man.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nDirector: Ram Gopal Varma\n\nCast: JD Chakravarty, Urmila Matondkar, Manoj Bajpai\n\nGenre: crime, drama, romance\n\n‘Satya’ was among a slew of gangster films that hit screens in the late ’90s, and director Ram Gopal Varma has lately come to be associated with the genre. The film tells of Satya (Chakravarty), who is unwittingly sucked into the world of Mumbai crime. What sets ‘Satya’ apart from other gangster films is the realistic portrayal of the criminals’ daily lives and Varma’s unrestrained, gloomy treatment of the subject. It’s considered one of his best films.\n\nThe big scene\n\nSatya pleads with his lover to open her door, while outside the police are trying to kill him. There’s love and escape on one side of the door; violence and despair on the other.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Shekhar Kapur\n\nCast: Anil Kapoor, Sridevi, Amrish Puri\n\nGenre: sci-fi, action, romcom\n\nShekhar ‘Elizabeth’ Kapur’s most famous Bollywood film. Arun (Kapoor) becomes the invisible superhero Mr India, who uses his power to fight the evil Mogambo (Puri) who is intent on taking over the world. Stuffed with as many masala ingredients as possible, this is pure camp nonsense. But it’s told in such a cheeky kitsch way that the viewer surrenders to its sheer energy. ‘Mr India’ is huge fun, especially Mogambo’s catchphrase ‘Mogambo Khush Hua’ (‘Mogambo is happy’) which became a national craze.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe ‘Kaate Nahin Kat Te’ song is regarded as perhaps the definitive sexy ‘wet sari’ song sequence in the history of Bollywood.\n\nAnil Sinanan\n\nDirector: Mani Ratnam\n\nCast: Arvind Swamy, Manisha Koirala\n\nGenre: romance, drama, tragedy\n\nThis poignant film covers one of the darkest periods in India’s contemporary history: the 1992 and 1993 Bombay riots. A love story about star-crossed lovers from different faiths who elope to Bombay to start a family, it proved so controversial on its release in 1995 that director Mani Ratnam’s house was bombed by extremists. Nevertheless, its heart, moral centre and cry for peace in India resonated, and ‘Mani Ratnam’ became a critical and commercial success.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe sweeping love song ‘Tu Hi Re’, sung by Hariharan and Kavita Krishnamurthy – and composed by AR Rahman, the man behind the music of ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ and ‘127 Hours’ – soundtracks a moment of pure passion between the film’s central couple. It’s widely considered to be one of Indian cinema’s most romantic scenes.\n\nAshanti Omkar\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Guru Dutt\n\nCast: Guru Dutt, Waheeda Rehman, Johnny Walker\n\nGenre: drama, romance, tragedy\n\nIn a bizarre case of life imitating the movies, actor-director Guru Dutt died in an apartment in 1964 after allegedly consuming a concoction of sleeping pills and alcohol: his unsuccessful relationship with actor Waheeda Rehman was said to be one of the things that caused him to fall into depression. Six years earlier, Dutt made ‘Kaagaz Ke Phool’, in which he played a director who falls in love with a film actress (played by Rehman). The film ended with Dutt’s character – a dejected filmmaker – dying in his chair at a film studio.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe song sequence ‘Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam’, stunningly shot by cinematographer VK Murthy, sees Dutt and Rehman’s characters regretting the decisions they’ve made in life.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nDirector: Rajkumar Hirani\n\nCast: Aamir Khan, Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Kareena Kapoor\n\nGenre: Comedy, drama, family\n\n‘3 Idiots’ charts the japes and scrapes of three students at India’s top engineering university (the film was shot in Bangalore). Along the way, this coming-of-age comedy addresses ‘ragging’ (initiation rituals), the intense pressure to excel in education, student suicide and the tension between the ambitions of students and their parents. ‘3 Idiots’ was a huge hit and confirmed Aamir Khan as the master of balancing good old-fashioned family entertainment with meaningful messages.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe film’s catchphrase, ‘All is well’, is still part of everyday language in India.\n\nRahul Verma\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Kundan Shah\n\nCast: Naseeruddin Shah, Ravi Baswani, Pankaj Kapur\n\nGenre: satire, comedy, drama\n\nLoosely inspired by Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 film ‘Blow-Up’, ‘Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro’ (‘Who Pays the Piper’) tells of two Mumbai photographers, Vinod (Shah) and Sudhir (Baswani), who unwittingly take a picture of a corrupt businessman (Kapur) killing a government official. The two discover the dead body and fight to ensure that it doesn’t end up in the hands of a motley group – the killer, his competitor, his two associates and a journalist, all of whom have vested interests in the case.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe epic climax, in which all the characters become part of a staging of Mahabharata, is widely considered to be the best comic scene ever shot in a Hindi film.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\n11. RRR (2022)\n\nDirector: SS Rajamouli\n\nCast: NT Rama Rao Jr, Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody\n\nGenre: action, drama\n\nBelieve it or not, this massive action extravaganza and even bigger box-office hit is actually based on two real-life historical figures during the British rule in India. Director SS Rajamouli does give their lives a fully fictionalised and highly bombastic skew, imbuing the men with superhuman powers, fighting against (and, for good measure, with) a myriad of CG animals, as well as the evil Brits, and throws in some musical bangers and some top-notch dance choreography for good measure. The story revolves around tribal leader Komaram Bheem (NT Rama Rao Jr), the protector of a village and its children, and his bromance with A Rama Raju (Ram Charan), a policeman with a hidden identity. They work together to save Malli, the daughter of Loki (not the God of Mischief, but a tribal Indian mum), who is forcefully taken from a forest as a trophy for a colonial wife and her brutal husband, the governor of the district. Cue, well, total mayhem.\n\nThe big scene\n\nJust when a colossal battle at the British colonial headquarters seems to have capped-out for explosions, fights and all-round chaos, someone turns up with a truck full of ferocious wild animals.\n\nDirector: Manmohan Desai\n\nCast: Amitabh Bachchan, Vinod Khanna, Rishi Kapoor\n\nGenre: drama, comedy, musical\n\nThe escapist formula honed by director Manmohan Desai (‘Dharam Veer’, Roti’) peaked with this late 1970s film about three brothers – each named in the title – separated at birth. Brimming with clichés and implausible situations, ‘Amar Akbar Anthony’ set the commercial template that many modern Bollywood filmmakers continue to follow. Thirty-five-year-old Amitabh Bachchan, the film’s star, defied his Angry Young Man image – created by a string of sombre action dramas – with his largely comical role.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe three characters enter a villain’s den in disguise to rescue their respective loves, at the same time singing the film’s title track, each of their names signifying the religion in which each was raised – Hinduism, Islam and Christianity.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nDirector: Kamal Amrohi\n\nCast: Ashok Kumar, Meena Kumari, Raaj Kumar\n\nGenre: historical romance\n\nLucknow, 1900. Sahibjaan (Kumari) is a ‘dancing girl’ who marries the respectable Salim (R Kumar), despite his dad’s disapproval. Sahibjaan soon considers herself unworthy of her husband and runs away. Will the lovers be reunited and will ‘respectable society’ accept them? Fifteen years in the making (not helped by personal differences between the director and his leading lady, also his wife), this has an evocative soundtrack which is weaved seamlessly into the story, creating perhaps the most magical, lyrical portrayal of idealised erotic romance seen on the Indian screen. The title means ‘Pure’.\n\nThe big scene\n\nWhen Salim sees the exposed feet of the sleeping, covered Sahibjaan, he is immediately smitten.\n\nAnil Sinanan\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Ashutosh Gowariker\n\nCast: Aamir Khan, Gracy Singh\n\nGenre: adventure, drama, sport, historical\n\nSet in the nineteenth century, ‘Lagaan’ sees a drought-struck village unite, learn to play cricket and take on their cruel imperial rulers. Although the combination of cricket and colonialism seems like a no-brainer in retrospect, at first nobody would touch this script with a bat. Then star Aamir Khan took the lead role and its critical and box office success ushered in a new era of alternative subject matter and varied storytelling. ‘Lagaan’ is, thus far, the last mainstream Hindi film to be nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe climactic cricket match saw audiences cheering on the villagers. The sports movie had arrived in Bollywood and ‘Chak De! India’, ‘Bhaag Milkha Bhaag’ and ‘Mary Kom’ later followed in the trailblazing wake of ‘Lagaan’.\n\nRahul Verma\n\nDirector: Yash Chopra\n\nCast: Shashi Kapoor, Amitabh Bachchan, Neetu Singh\n\nGenre: Action, thriller, crime\n\nEvoking ‘Mother India’ with its story of a good son pitched against a bad one and a mother caught between them, ‘Deewaar’ places an anti-hero centrestage. Amitabh Bachchan excels as the simmering Vijay, who turns to criminality to provide for his mum, while brother Ravi (Kapoor) becomes a cop. Inevitably, their paths must cross. ‘Deewaar’ was Bachchan’s first step on the road to mega-stardom and it epitomises his status as the bristling, angry young man railing against all around him.\n\nThe big scene\n\nInspector Ravi faces down gangster Vijay in his elder brother’s grand, ill-gotten house and declares that as long as Vijay is a criminal there is a ‘deewaar’ (wall) between them, and that their mum must choose between the two.\n\nRahul Verma\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Vijay Anand\n\nCast: Dev Anand, Waheeda Rehman, Leela Chitnis\n\nGenre: romance, drama, musical\n\nDirector Vijay Anand adapts RK Narayan’s English-language novel into a sprawling drama. ‘Guide’ tells of a man, Raju, who transforms from a tour guide in his youth into a great holy man later in life. The film is considered ahead of its time for showing its protagonists, Raju (Anand) and Rosie (Rehman), having an extra-marital affair, and also for presenting its lead character as an unscrupulous scumbag. Both were deeply unusual in a Hindi film of the time.\n\nThe big scene\n\nRaju has an epiphany on his deathbed – a spiritual awakening where he realises that even though the body dies, the soul will never fade away.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nDirector: Guru Dutt\n\nCast: Guru Dutt, Mala Sinha, Waheeda Rehman\n\nGenre: drama, romance, musical\n\nFilmmaker Guru Dutt, known for bringing tragic stories to celluloid, plays Vijay, a struggling writer whose two best friends happen to be a streetwalker and a masseuse. Vijay tries unsuccessfully to get his book of poems published and is later believed to have died in a train accident. A cunning publisher prints the book and makes a killing. Maestro composer SD Burman provides a stellar soundtrack, memorable for Sahir Ludhianvi’s poetic verses. With ‘Pyaasa’, Dutt established himself as a filmmaker who could effectively depict the reality of the world around him.\n\nThe big scene\n\nWhen Vijay ‘returns from the dead’ at his own memorial. Dutt’s silhouette, with the flash of light around him flooding the dark auditorium, sticks in the memory.\n\nAniruddha Guha\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: Aditya Chopra\n\nCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Amrish Puri\n\nGenre: romance, comedy, family\n\nFamiliar themes of personal choice versus family responsibility, and of forbidden love, are remixed for the 1990s in this epic, era-defining romance. In London, Raj (Khan) is an immature young man, while straight-laced Simran (Kajol) is all set for a marriage arranged by her domineering father. She goes InterRailing in Europe, meets Raj and they fall in love against the backdrop of Swiss mountains. The popularity of the film (the title translates as ‘The brave-hearted will take away the bride’) is reflected in the fact that it has screened daily in Mumbai’s Maratha Mandir cinema for 19 years and counting. This ultimate romance also raised the bar impossibly high for guys chasing girls.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThe hit song ‘Tujhe Dekha To…’ sees Simran and Raj reunited in Punjab’s rolling fields, and its lingering gazes and passionate embraces are old school Bollywood at its finest. Raj’s line – ‘Senorita bade bade desho me aisi choti choti baatein hoti rehti’ (‘Senorita, don’t get stressed by the little things’) – has crossed into daily usage. Indeed, no less a figure than Barack Obama quoted it during his inaugural visit to India in 2015.\n\nRahul Verma\n\nDirector: Mehboob Khan\n\nCast: Nargis, Rajendra Kumar, Sunil Dutt\n\nGenre: drama\n\nThe first Hindi film to be nominated for Best Foreign-Language Film at the Oscars, this is a heartbreaking story of the complexities of rural farming in newly independent India and the exploitation of farmers by their feudal landlords. It follows the hardships faced by Radha (Nargis), a village mother of three sons who is abandoned by her husband and forced to toil the paddy fields to survive. The film entrenched the idea of the pure, self-sacrificing mother figure as synonymous with the notion of an idealised Indian (Hindu) nation.\n\nThe big scene\n\nWhen Radha’s rebellious son Birju (Dutt) shoots the lecherous evil landlord and kidnaps his daughter, she must take matters into her own hands to restore order.\n\nAnil Sinanan\n\nAdvertising\n\nDirector: K Asif\n\nCast: Prithviraj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Madhubala\n\nGenre: historical romance\n\nTranslated as ‘Emperor of the Mughals’ and set in the late sixteenth century in India’s Mughal period, this is the doomed story of Prince Saleem (Kumar), son of the ruling Emperor Akbar (Kapoor), who falls in love with dancing slave girl Anarkali (Madhubala). This is true epic filmmaking, with magnificent sets, huge battle scenes with hundreds of real elephants, elaborate costumes, an evergreen score and naturalistic acting. It remains a gorgeous evocation of a bygone era, and was one of the rare occasions when a film of the ‘Muslim social’ genre (i.e. interested in Muslim people and culture) became a blockbuster in Hindu-centric India.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThis mostly black-and-white film suddenly bursts into colour when the classic ‘I have loved, so what is there to fear?’ confrontational dance number begins.\n\nAnil Sinanan\n\nDirector: Ramesh Sippy\n\nCast: Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan, Amjad Khan\n\nGenre: action, thriller, western\n\nThis cult masala western sees escaped convicts Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Bachchan) defend a village terrorised by bandits led by the maniacal Gabbar Singh (Khan). ‘Sholay’ has it all – epic dishum-dishum fight scenes, bromance, humour, memorable songs, plot twists, thrilling dance sequences and sparkling performances. The haunting score and Bollywood’s baddest villain are the icing on a rollicking, all-action cake.\n\nThe big scene\n\nThree bandits return from a raid empty-handed to face Gabbar’s ire: miraculously they survive trial by half-loaded gun (six chambers, three bullets) and Gabbar laughs hysterically. His men join in and there’s a collective relief-filled exhale – then Gabbar shoots them anyway. The threat of a visit from Gabbar Singh has been used by parents to get kids to bed on time ever since.\n\nRahul Verma"
