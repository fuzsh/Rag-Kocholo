        "text": "Shahid Kapoor, who will take on Nani’s role in the Hindi adaptation of Jersey , recently suffered an injury on the film’s sets in Chandigarh. According to Mumbai Mirror , the actor was reportedly hit in the face with a leather cricket ball, which split his lip. A doctor was rushed on site and his wound was stitched up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the mishap, Kapoor took to Twitter and thanked all his fans for the concern and wishes for his speedy recovery. He wrote that while he had to spill a little blood for the film, it was a worthy sacrifice for a “script this good.”\n\nHere is his tweet\n\nAsian News International recently reported that Kapoor returned to Mumbai on Sunday with his wife Mira Rajput. At the airport, he was seen wearing a printed maskÂ to cover the injury.\n\nHere are some photos of the actor from the airport\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJersey revolves around a father and a talented but failed cricketer, who decides to return to cricket in his late thirties because of his desire to represent the Indian cricket team and fulfil his son’s wish of an Indian jersey as a gift. How he makes it big despite being limited by his age forms the essence of the story. Gowtam Tinnanuri, who directed the Telugu original, will also helm the Hindi version.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides Kapoor, the drama also stars Mrunal Thakur and Pankaj Tripathi in pivotal roles. Jersey is slated to release on 28 August 2020."
