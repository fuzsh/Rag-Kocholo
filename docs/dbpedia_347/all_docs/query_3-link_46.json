        "text": "WHAT‘S HAPPENING\n\nNews & Events\n\nFilming wraps on Adelaide set of Hotel Mumbai\n\n02 September 2016\n\nLeading South Australian filmmakers and Hollywood superstars came together in Adelaide to create a major international production, Hotel Mumbai, with filming starting on August 2 and wrapping this week.\n\nScreen Australia and South Australian Film Corporation have supported the production, which is injecting millions into the South Australian economy, and has employed a large local crew during the five week shoot based at the Adelaide Studios. The production team included over 350 South Australian Heads of Department, Cast, Crew and Extras.\n\nThe film will tell the astonishing true story of the victims and survivors of the devastating attacks on Mumbai in 2008. A story which fearlessly tackles the defining global issues of our time. A story about ordinary people. Real people. People of all races, all colours, all creeds, binding together in a gruelling fight for survival. A story that celebrates humanity’s highest ideals – compassion, courage, resilience and an unwavering desire to live.\n\nHome-grown Adelaide director Anthony Maras (The Palace) is working alongside South Australian Producer Julie Ryan (Red Dog and Ten Canoes). The project is being produced by Basil Iwanyk (Gods of Egypt, Sicario), Gary Hamilton and Mike Gabrawy (Jungle, Nest and Resident Evil), Jomon Thomas (The Man Who Knew Infinity), and documentary filmmaker Andrew Ogilvie (Surviving Mumbai, The War That Changed US).\n\nThey are joined by screen stars Armie Hammer (The Man From U.N.C.L.E, The Social Network), Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, The Man Who Knew Infinity) Jason Isaacs (Harry Potter, Fury, London Fields) Anupam Kher (Silver Linings Playbook, The Headhunters Calling, The Big Sick), Nazanin Boniadi (Homeland and Ben Hur) and South Australian Tilda Cobham-Hervey (Girl Asleep, The Kettering Incident, 52 Tuesdays).\n\nHotel Mumbai is a coproduction with international producer Basil Iwanyk (Sicario, The Expendables) and Australian Producers; Gary Hamilton (Bait, Paper Planes) Jomon Thomas (The Man Who Knew Infinity, Damascus Cover) and Andrew Ogilvie (Surviving Mumbai, The War That Changed US).\n\nThe film has been shot at Adelaide Studios, which was transformed to become the interiors of Mumbai’s Taj Mahal Hotel, the exclusive high class hotel in Mumbai. Filming will move to India after the monsoon period.\n\nThe film has utilised the Adelaide Studios’ Mixing Theatre with local post-production company Kojo engaged to work on post-supervision, picture and sound services and visual effects.\n\nThe South Australian government recently boosted SAFC funds by $1 million in order to attract Hotel Mumbai and other feature films to the State.\n\nRead the full release here.\n\nFeatured image: L-R: Hotel Mumbai Director Anthony Maras with South Australian Arts Minister Jack Snelling, South Australian Film Corporation Chief Executive Annabelle Sheehan and Hotel Mumbai Producer Julie Ryan on-set at Adelaide Studios."
