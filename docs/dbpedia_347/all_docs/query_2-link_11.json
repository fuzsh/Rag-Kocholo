        "text": "#filmyfridays Movies have always had a great impact on me. Films were my biggest source of entertainment, thanks to my dad who loved them too.Language was never a barrier as Madras as a city was open to the most prominent of all 4 South Indian films apart from Hindi films. With a lot of Malayali friends , I saw a lot of Malayalam films and the storytelling always fascinated me. My dad would make it a point to take us to the theatre to watch films. An outing we all looked forward to as a family. In recent times however, there are a few movies that pulled me into a theatrical experience. Most are best seen on OTT very soon. One of the most recent movies that pulled me to a late night show in theatres is \"Aadujeevitham- the Goat life\" It was amazing to see what the team presented. Was curious about the film from the time I saw the trailer. The promotions & interviews further made me want the big screen watch. It truly was an experience! The connect to the #voiceinme was visible. ðŸŽ¯ Vision: The vision of Blessy the Director & the commitment of the main lead Prithviraj and every one else is a treat to experience.The metaphorical expanse of the desert & the plight of the protagonist are so beautifully intertwined that you are drawn into his trials yourself too. ðŸŽ¯ Outcome = Events + Response. The outcome of the 16 year investment into the film by everyone is evident in the final product. The challenge of making this in a desert with a particular breed of goats and camel was immense. With the pandemic it was 4 years lost The journeys of each of those involved evolved. The commitment of completing this masterpiece stayed. ðŸŽ¯ Information about this real life saga came from a bestseller. The challenge was how much would they edit from the original story.This FILTER was important keep the audience hooked. ðŸŽ¯ Communication was key. From only a possible low key release in a few states with the film being localised 16 years ago, Covid opened the world to Malayalam films. The reach & and response thus was global in a much grander way. The 16 year journey also helped in putting this film on a bigger platform and upped the overall quality of the entire experience. Social media was utilised and everyone was talking about this amazing film. ðŸŽ¯ Energy: The energy it carried & what it garnered were enough to keep the curiosity alive. Every connect to the film made it their duty to spread the word. The Energy around this film was phenomenal.Every connection came forward to contribute their bit to make this movie a talking point. With the clarity in Vision, control over Outcome, filter of Information, subtle Communication Skills , you will attract the Energy to BE the difference. The whole experience of seeing the VOICE of the entire team unfold was a moment when the line between REEL & REAL blurred. An experience I will cherish for a long time. Would love to know if you have experienced such a connection to VOICE. #india #resilience"
