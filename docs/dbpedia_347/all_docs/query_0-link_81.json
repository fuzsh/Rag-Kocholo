        "text": "A movie title is an audience's first connect to the subject. So you know how important it is when it comes to film-making. So it's really annoying when every year or so, there comes along a movie that just couldn't get the grammar or spelling of its title correct. While many tend to overlook these errors, but for the set of people, who love Bollywood as much as they love grammar--it's highly bothersome.\n\nSometimes the film-makers do it on purpose, assuming they have the artistic license to do so. So we're going to let alphanumeric titles like Te3n and Welcome 2 Karachi be. But the list of movie names with genuinely atrocious spellings and grammar in Bollywood is long. Here's a sample:\n\nOnce Upon A Time In Mumbaai\n\nThe film starring Ajay Devgn, Emraan Hashmi, Kangana Ranaut and Prachi Desai is one of the few good gangster dramas that Bollywood has produced. But the spelling of Mumbai? Not happening. Maybe the extra â€˜a' was added for auspiciousness. But the scriptwriters did a damn good job, so why pay the numerologists?\n\nKarzzzz\n\nThose extra zzz's symbolise what people were doing in the theatre. Also, Himesh Reshammiya, how about sticking just to music? You have given us good numbers.\n\nThe Xpose\n\nAnother absurd Himesh movie with absurd spelling. Smh.\n\nOnce Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara\n\nFor the sequel it seems, the makers spent money on the numerologists and forgot to pay the writers. Even that 'Ay' instead of an 'a' couldn't save this Akshay Kumar, Imran Khan, and Sonakshi Sinha film from being a dud.\n\nSingh Is Bliing\n\nToo much bling, we have to admit. More than even the Sindhis like it.\n\nDarr @ The Mall\n\nThis Jimmy Shergill starrer's title looks like an incomplete e-mail address. Do we suffix dot com, dot in, or dot co dot in after the mall to send an e-mail? Because we have to tell the makers that this movie was less horror and more comedy.\n\nKismat Konnection\n\nNo one could \"konnect\" with this film, which brought Shahid Kapoor and Vidya Balan together on the screen.\n\nI Hate Luv Storys\n\nOof, this is hard to look at. I can't even...\n\nTanu Weds Manu Returns\n\nKangana gave her best performance in this film. But the title is a truly aggressive rejection of punctuation. Where is the colon between Tanu Weds Manu and returns? Forget that, the whole title just sounds so odd. Just say it loud. Do it again and again... and you'll understand what we mean!\n\nSaheb Biwi Aur Gangster Returns\n\nAnd while you are at it, say this one out loud too.\n\nDunno Y...Na Jaane Kyon\n\nThis was a landmark movie. It explored the topic of gay relationships in 2010 when section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was still very much relevant. So naturally, it hurts to see that the title of the film was suggested by a teenager.\n\nU Me Aur Hum\n\nAnd this is another movie title which seems to have come out a teen's mind. We can overlook the 'U' instead of 'You', but where are the commas?\n\nKyaa Super Kool Hain Hum\n\nThe makers may be keeping the franchise alive, but none of the films have worked very well--despite all the Ks. Not \"kool\" guys, not \"kool\"!\n\nBoyss Toh Boyss Hain\n\nOh boy! Why did Rajkummar Rao star in this movie? And even if he did why didn't he tell the producers to fix the title?\n\nLuv Ka The End"
