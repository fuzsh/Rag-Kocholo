        "text": "The Telugu original Arjun Reddy was shot in scenic locations of Italy, parts of Germany, and hill-stations like Dehradun, apart from Rishikesh and Hyderabad.\n\nBut for the Hindi remake, starring Shahid Kapoor, who essays the role of a medical student, originally played by Vijay Deverakonda, director Sandeep Vanga has set up the initial premises for the film in Mumbai. And the Udta Punjab actor is keen that the film is first being shot in the city.\n\n“His wife, Mira, is expecting their second child. So rather than rushing back to her when she is delivering, Shahid is keen to get the Mumbai portions shot first as it makes it easy for him to be around his wife. The makers do not have any issue with that. This is good enough for Shahid as well as for the film as the makers do not want an anxious actor on the set,” inform our sources.\n\nThe Student of The Year 2 actress Tara Sutaria has been cast opposite Shahid and will be playing a medical student who is Shahid’s junior in college. Ashwin Varde and Murad Khetani have produced the film.\n\n—Sanskriti Media"
