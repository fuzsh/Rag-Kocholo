        "text": "Shahid Kapoor with the innocence look throbs the millions heart by his debut film “Ishq Vishq Pyaar Vyaar”. Shahid was born on 25th February 1981 in Mumbai. He completed his early education from Gyan Bharathi (Delhi) and his further studies were completed in Rajhans Vidyalaya (Mumbai). When Shahid Debuted his age was just 22 years. This younger hero did just few films but has offer from Boney Kapoor, Nitin Manmohan and Abbas Mastan.\n\nShahid believes in achieving all by him, though he has a film family tag. His father Pankaj Kapoor, a versatile actor and mother Neelima Azmi, an actress and marvellous classical dancer. Shahid has inherited from his parent’s great acting talent. He had never told his parents that he want to be an actor before signing his first film. This charming actor, who started his career with a video album “Aryans”. Shahid made his film “Ishq Vishq Pyaar Vyaar” in 2003 and was a hit. He received the “ Hero Cycles Stardust Award” and “Filmfare” for the most promising newcomer of the year 2003.\n\nShahid went for the audition of Ishq Vishq first time and was rejected, as he looked too young. After years later Ken Ghosh saw him in a public place, he was totally changed. Ghosh asked him to come to the audition again and he was selected. He wasn’t offer much film after the released of “Ishq Vishq….”for about few months though the film was hit and his acting was also appreciated. The main reason behind this was that producers and directors had no subjects for a 22 years old guy. After that people started writing subjects for him and he started getting lots of offers. Shahid signed his second film after waiting for the six months of his first release. He did Ken Ghosh’s “Fida” (2004) with Fardeen Khan and his girlfriend Kareena Kapoor, which was a thriller movie. Then he was seen in Nitin Manmohan’s “ Dil Maange More” (2004), which was a hit. It was a light romantic comedy about which of the three girls get him.\n\nShahid also did “Deewane Huye Paagal” and Mahesh Manjrekar’s “Vaah! Life Ho To Aisi” (2005), this movie became popular among the children and was appreciated. Then came “Shikar” (2006) casting Shahid Kapoor, Ajay Devgan, Amrita Roa and Bipasha Basu, though the movie didn’t do well at the box – office but Shahid’s role as Jaidev Vardhan was appreciated and praised a lot. His efforts in this movie made him to be nominated in the category of Screen Best Actor Award for Shikar in 2006. His famous movies are ”Vaah! Life Ho To Aise”, ”Dil Maange More”, “Fida”, “Ishq Vishq Pyaar Vyaar”.
