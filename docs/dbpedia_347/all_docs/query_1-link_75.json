To close the wound, stitches were sutured by the doctor,\" the source said.\n\nThe actor will not be shooting for the next few days as he has a heavily bruised lower lip. He will resume filming after the swelling subsides and the wound is healed, the source added.\n\n‘Jersey’ chronicles the story of a talented but failed cricketer, who decides to return to the field in his late thirties driven by the desire to represent the Indian cricket team and fulfil his son's wish for a jersey as a gift.\n\nThe Hindi version of the sports-drama is being directed by Gowtam Tinnanauri, who also helmed the original 2019 Telugu film, starring Nani in the lead.\n\n‘Jersey’, which also features Mrunal Thakur and Pankaj Kapoor, will release in August this year."
