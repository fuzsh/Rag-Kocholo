        "text": "Posted on: 15 August 2012\n\nThe Bollywood film, Ek Tha Tiger, shot on location at Trinity College Dublin will be launched in India and Dublin this week. The first ever Bollywood blockbuster to be made in Ireland, featuring two of Bollywood’s biggest stars, Katrina Kaif and Salman Khan, will have special screening events across India – Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, Dehli – as well as Dublin. It will go on general release in 3,000 cinemas in India and in 24 countries worldwide with an expected global audience of 100 million.\n\nFilming of Ek Tha Tiger, a spy-thriller featuring the usual Bollywood elements of music and dance took place last September and October in Trinity and some other locations around Dublin city centre. The film’s storyline involves a world renowned scientist working at Trinity College Dublin who is suspected of selling missile technology secrets to Pakistan. The Indian Government sends an Indian secret agent to find out about the Professor’s activities. The agent, codenamed Tiger, falls in love with the Professor’s caretaker Zoya, who is studying at a fictional dance academy located at TCD, and together they embark on a rollercoaster journey that takes them from Dublin to Istanbul, Kazakhstan and Chile.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/J0HSOkQotmw\n\nSpeaking about the Bollywood production, Vice Provost for Global Relations at TCD, Professor Jane Ohlmeyer said: “Trinity College Dublin has longstanding links with India. The filming of Ek Tha Tiger at TCD was a great opportunity for us to increase our understanding of modern Indian culture and live the Bollywood experience here at Trinity. The College currently boasts a wide array of teaching and research relating to India along with growing numbers of students from South Asia. Ek Tha Tiger not only gave Trinity a chance to showcase our magnificent campus to a huge Bollywood audience but also gave our Indian students a chance to catch a glimpse of two of India’s biggest stars in action here at Trinity College.”\n\nProduced by one of India’s most prominent film companies, Yash Raj Films, Ek Tha Tiger was directed by award-winning Indian director Kabir Kahn. The film was co-produced by Oscar-winning Irish company Fantastic Film."
