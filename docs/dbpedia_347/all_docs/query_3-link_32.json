        "text": "While Bollywood filmmakers run around the globe looking for exotic locales to shoot their films, Hollywood directors in fact turn to India when they want to shoot ‘abroad’. We bring to you the 10 best Hollywood movies that were shot in India.\n\nThe Darjeeling Limited — Jodhpur\n\nThis is a comedy-drama film about spiritual-self discovery of three brothers who reunite on the train to Darjeeling. The director, Wes Anderson, said his inspiration for this movie was Satyajit Ray and several other documentaries on India. Apart from locations from Jodhpur, one can also spot Irrfan Khan in the movie.\n\nEat Pray Love — Delhi and Pataudi\n\nHeavily revolving around India, this romantic comedy-drama starring Julia Roberts was shot in parts of Delhi and Pataudi. On her search for enlightenment, she ends up going to an ashram in India. It’s a must watch for people who want a peek into the power of prayers in India.\n\nJobs — Delhi and Vrindavan\n\nA biographical drama film based on Steve Jobs played by Ashton Kutcher has some parts which were shot in Delhi and Vrindavan. It provided a backdrop of Job’s 1974 trek to India. Don’t be surprised if you spot locations around Chandni Chowk or Red Fort.\n\nMillion Dollar Arm — Mumbai\n\nThis biographical sports drama film about baseball pitchers Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel was partly shot in Mumbai. The film’s music is an interesting mix composed by A.R. Rahman.\n\nSlumdog Millionaire — Mumbai\n\nDirected by Danny Boyle, this adaptation of a Q & A by Vikas Swarup won many accolades. It has been shot in the Juhu Slums of Mumbai. It stars Indian actors including Anil Kapoor, Irrfan Khan and Frieda Pinto.\n\nThe Hundred Foot Journey- Unknown\n\nA movie revolving around a family which moves to Europe from Mumbai. It has a lot of Indian cooking and stars Juhi Chawla and Om Puri. The plot of the story starts from India.\n\nThe Bourne Supremacy — Goa\n\nThe second of the spy film series was shot in Goa. I guess even the director was bewitched by Goa!\n\nThe Namesake — Kolkata\n\nBased on the book of the same name by Jhumpa Lahiri, it was directed by Mira Nair. It starred Tabu and Irrfan Khan, and was shot in Kolkata.\n\nA Mighty Heart — Pune\n\nIt is a drama film directed by Michael Winterbottom. The plot demanded shooting in Karachi but due to safety reasons, those scenes were shot in Pune.\n\nMission Impossible 4 — Mumbai\n\nThis fourth installation of the cult action spy series had scenes in the lanes of Mumbai. It also starred Anil Kapoor as Brij Nath. Pretty cool, huh?\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises — Mehrangarh Fort (Jodhpur)\n\nThis superhero movie has scenes from Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur. Yeah, the same scene where Batman escapes from jail.\n\nThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel — Jaipur and Udaipur\n\nThis Dev Patel starrer comedy-drama film has most of its scenes from Rajasthan, especially in Jaipur and Udaipur. A lot of scenes take place in the busy markets of these cities. Released in 2011, the movie is about British retirees who come to India for vacation, where they stay at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Starring Judie Dench, Maggie Smith and Dev Patel — most parts of the movie was shot in Jaipur and Udaipur.\n\nIndian locations might have been done to death in Bollywood movies — the same is not true for foreign filmmakers. And they’re welcome!\n\nZero Dark Thirty — Chandigarh\n\nSome parts of this movie were shot in Chandigarh but it was all designed to look like Lahore and Abbottabad. It was dramatically based on the manhunt for Osama Bin Laden.\n\nOctopussy — Udaipur\n\nThirteenth of the James Bond series, much of this movie was shot in Udaipur. Also could you spot Kabir Bedi in there?\n\nThe Rains Came — Unknown\n\nThis classic romantic drama movie released in 1939 and is one of the oldest movies which were shot in India. Around 50 days were spent filming in man-made floods.\n\nLife of Pi — Puducherry and Kerala\n\nIt is a survival story of ‘Pi’ Patel who survives a shipwreck and shares a lifeboat with a tiger. It was shot at various places in India including Puducherry and Kerala. Irrfan Khan and Tabu played a major role in the movie.\n\nOutsourced — Mumbai\n\nThis romantic comedy was not only shot in India but also set up on what happens when a firangi gets outsourced to India. Major chunks of the movie were shot in Mumbai."
