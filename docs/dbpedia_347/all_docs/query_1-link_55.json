We just want to complete the shooting. People should see the film and judge it after watching. They will resume shooting soon and we will continue shooting.\n\n“I don’t know the details as I am promoting “Rangoon” right now.”\n\nShahid, 35, is essaying the role of Raja Ratan Singh in the Indian period drama, which also stars Deepika Padukone as queen Padmavati and Ranveer Singh as Alauddin Khilji.\n\nTalking about his look in the movie, Shahid said, “When you play a king you need to have a certain personality. That time people were not very skinny so I need to have manly personality. So to carry the outfits and all Sanjay sir wants me to be muscular, fuller.”"
