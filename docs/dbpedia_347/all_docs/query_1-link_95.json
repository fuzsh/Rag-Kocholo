        "text": "Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor will share screen space for the first time\n\nHighlights\n\nShahid and Ranveer co-star with Deepika in Padmavati\n\nRanveer is currently on a break from Padmavati and is in London\n\nRanveer is yet to shoot his scenes with Shahid and Deepika\n\nNew Delhi: Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor have reportedly been avoiding each other on the sets of Padmavati, the Sanjay Leela Bhansali film, in which they co-star with Deepika Padukone. According to mid-day, Mr Bhansali made the Padmavati roster in such a way that his two male leads have been kept apart for as much as possible, with their solo scenes being shot before those they appear in together. \"Sanjay sir planned the shoot in such a way that individual scenes of all actors were shot first. These will be followed by portions that see them together. Although Deepika Padukone, who plays Rani Padmavati, and Shahid, as her husband Raja Ratan Singh, have shot together before, Ranveer has shot solo scenes until now,\" a source close to the film's unit told mid-day. Ranveer Singh plays Alauddin Khilji.\n\nDeepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor have already filmed some of their sequences together, reported mid-day. Ranveer and Shahid will now shoot their first scene together - one in which their characters meet for the first time and get into a 'war of words,' as mid-day describes it. \"A scene like this banks on the actors' equation, and Shahid and Ranveer share a good one. As performers, they are different. Having them come face to face on set will be a delight to watch,\" the source also told mid-day. Ranveer is currently on a pre-planned break from work and is holidaying in London. He will resume shooting for Padmavati sometime after June 4. The first scene, featuring Shahid and Ranveer, has already been discussed with the 31-year-old actor - the wait is on now for Ranveer to join Shahid on set.\n\nIt appears that the schedule has been designed carefully following speculation that Ranveer is reportedly upset with Shahid's extended scenes in the film. Padmavati is Deepika and Ranveer's second period piece and third film with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, after Ram-Leela and Bajirao Mastani.\n\nPromoted\n\nListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nEarlier in an interview to news agency PTI, Shahid had said that the film is inappropriately being tagged as a two-hero project where as it involves three primary characters. \"It's a great opportunity for all three of us. It's a great role for Deepika, a fantastic role for Ranveer and great one for me. I am happy that the film has been cast the way it has and it is getting made, said Shahid. Of the speculated feud with Ranveer, he said its 'absurd.' Shahid Kapoor was also reported to have not gotten along with the co-star of his last film Rangoon, Kangana Ranaut.\n\nPadmavati is expected to release later this year.\n\n."
