        "text": "RHG and I (CarrieS) saw Jupiter Ascending and we are here to tell you that it is just terrible and we loved every batshit minute of it.\n\nIs the movie “good”?\n\nNo, in the sense that it was relentlessly derivative, totally soapy, had some god-awful lines, a plot that frankly never did make much sense, and characters that had very little development and when they did develop it was in peculiar ways.\n\nYes, in the sense that Channing Tatum roller blades in anti gravity boots and fights an alien space dragon-dinosaur soldier while everything in the background explodes.\n\nThere’s a plot, kind of, but don’t waste your time trying to follow it because it’s just a thinly veiled excuse to blow things up and show gorgeous people in gorgeous clothes and various stages of undress. But we have to do some kind of summary so here goes.\n\nBasically, into not every generation there is a chosen one. She alone is the perfect genetic copy of the space queen. She alone can fight vampires/solve Lego problems/defeat Voldemort/save the earth. Mila Kunis plays Jupiter, an immigrant from Russia who works as a maid until aliens try to kill her and she is saved by Channing Tatum. Tatum is a space soldier half-albino with lycan DNA and elf ears who used to have wings but they were cut off as a punishment because he bit someone in disgrace. I did not make that up. He spends his time roller blading with his anti-gravity boots and brooding. He rescues Jupiter and she gets involved in space politics and she changes clothes and he rescues her again and after a sufficient number of repeats of this cycle the movie is over.\n\nHere are our thoughts:\n\nCARRIE:\n\nThe cheese! It owned ALL THE CHEESE. CHEESE AND CAKE! I love that the movie had no shame and no restraint. Will Tatum fight a bunch of aliens in a cornfield while rollerblading on anti gravity boots and while shirtless? OF COURSE HE WILL. Will Mila Kunis wear every kind of fetish wear imaginable? Duh.\n\nMy advice to viewers is go big or go home. You will only see this because all the people, and clothes, and explosions are so very, very pretty so you might as well see them in 3D. God knows you won’t be seeing it for the subtle, witty, insightful dialogue.\n\nDouglas Booth is so very, very pretty.\n\nRHG:\n\nThat. Was. Fucking. Ridiculous.\n\nI thought National Treasure Channing Tatum wore his shirt too much. I was promised a shirt allergy of Lautneresque proportions, and, well. Nope.\n\nHonestly, it was delightful. It was a Space Opera of the highest order, with overly complicated world building, gorgeous, gorgeous visuals, and costumes that I can’t wait to see cosplays for.\n\nCARRIE:\n\nBut I have questions. So many questions. For example:\n\nDid the movie actually end, or did the filmmakers just get bored and/or run out of budget and say, “Fuck this, let’s go to a party?”\n\nHow cool was it to see Mrs. S. from Orphan Black?!? And also that Mila, who is a real- life Russian immigrant who speaks fluent Russian, gets to speak Russian?\n\nRHG:\n\nLike, the plot, I’m not too sure what was going on. Sean Bean was part bee (and I can’t believe I lost the “When does Sean Bean die” pool, GODDAMMIT) and CHANNING TATUM HAD WOLF DNA (how could that not be the best movie ever) and Belle was there as Marius’ hench-deer and there was Mrs. S and also James D’Arcy for a minute and a half (HEY JAMES D’ARCY HEY) and the princess was played by Tuppence Middleton and like, what?\n\nWHAT?\n\nCARRIE:\n\nWhat I loved about this movie is that it made no sense but also it had no shame. Do bees bow to the will of royalty? Sure, why not, if it means Mila gets to look pretty and control bees with flowing hand motions. Are the Wachowski siblings aware that, for instance, Queen Elizabeth does not control bees in this manner? Or do they think that this is how The Queen spends her time? Maybe all day she hangs out in the garden waving at bees. Maybe they have access to intel I don’t have. It’s like they just took every idea they could think of that would look cool and just hurled it at the screen with no rationale. Orgy! Space Wedding! Space DMV with android guy named Bob (that was the best thing ever, BTW)! Winged Space Dinosaur/Dragon Hybrids that talk and shoot ray guns! A guy with an elephant head! Explosions! If they had had an ounce of restraint it would have all fallen apart but it was just a hilarious riot of insanity.\n\nI have no opinion of the acting except to say that the actors committed. I mean, they were going for the Oscar. And you have to respect that in someone who has to say lines like “You’re the perfect hunting machine: fearless, relentless. You’ve been searching for one thing your whole life… and she’s down there.” Ouch.\n\nRHG:\n\n“I love dogs, I’ve always loved dogs.” SAID TO A HALF LYCAN.\n\nI can’t.\n\nThe Space DMV was just the best fucking thing. I’m not sure Eddie Redmayne (probable Oscar Winner Eddie Redmayne) was in the same movie, but he committed, single-mindedly. He’s a fucking professional and he was there to DO HIS JOB.\n\nCARRIE:\n\nSo, romance. Did you buy it? Are Mila and Channing destined to make happy Russian-American-Wolf-Elf-Ear royal babies together? I thought the romance was pretty perfunctory but hey, once a guy saves you with his anti gravity boots, it’s really a done deal, right? Like any relationship building would be almost beside the point.\n\nI am possibly the only straight woman in the world who doesn’t have a thing for Tatum but he fit a certain paranormal romance type PERFECTLY. What with the lycan thing and the missing wings and the brooding and the rescuing and the elf ears I could totally see how he would be a crack cocaine candy bar for a lot of people.\n\nRHG:\n\nHe saved her life in anti-grav boots and gave her a gun and then took off his shirt. That’s it. Boom, done. Also she loves dogs! It happened, because the checklist had “Queen and bodyguard DO IT” and you need to hit as many of the tick-marks as possible. They make a pretty couple, so. Whatever.\n\nRHG:\n\nThe audience in my theater was into the campy ridiculousness. There was a number of people who were just like “WHAT”ing through the whole movie. It was hilarious.\n\nCARRIE:\n\nI went to early Thurs PM showing and it was quiet. Which is too bad because this film BEGS for the Rocky Horror treatment. I want the midnight showing, and when Tatum roller blades into the space wedding I want the audience to sing “FLASH! AH-AH! SAVIOR OF THE UNIVERSE! DUM DUM DUM DUM!”\n\nRHG:\n\nThere are two reasons I was super excited for this movie. One is because when someone gives the Wachowski Siblings a shit ton of money, batshit amazing comes out. It’s also one of the very very few action-adventure movies coming out this year that’s not a remake, franchise, or adaptation. I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe, don’t get me wrong, but I want to see original stuff come out, too! And there’s SO LITTLE OF IT. When Pacific Rim became the hit it did, it wasn’t a cry for “Moar Pacific Rim, plz.” It was for “Moar original stuff plz.”\n\nLook, objectively this is not a “good” movie. But it owns its cray-cray, it doesn’t pretend to be anything other than cray-cray, and it’s SO PRETTY. I want to talk to National Treasure Channing Tatum about the fight scene choreo. And the spaceship designs (well, not to Tatum, but you know, other people) and the costumes and everything. This is the kind of movie that you just have to commit to, and let it all happen.\n\nPossibly let it happen with rum and coke. I’m not sure.\n\nCARRIE:\n\nIt is truly tragic that the conventions of SBTB require us to give this movie a letter grade, since it transcends simple grades and enters a higher, or possibly lower, order of judgement. RHG decided that the closest thing we have to a “WTF” grade is F+, so that’s the grade we are assigning. However, a more accurate grade would be something like three unicorns and a glitter bomb."
