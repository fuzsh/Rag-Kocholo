        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Just six weeks ahead of its planned release, the Wachowskis' space thriller \"Jupiter Ascending\" has been postponed to 2015.\n\nWarner Bros. announced the date change late Tuesday. The movie, with a budget of $150 million or more and starring Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis, will now open Feb. 6 instead of July 18.\n\nIt's a stunning and unusual move for a high-profile film so close to release. \"Jupiter Ascending,\" which Warner Bros. co-financed with Village Roadshow, will bounce out of the lucrative but high-pressure summer movie season and into early February, often a dumping ground for troubled movies.\n\nAndy and Lana Wachowski have a checkered box-office track record. Though their \"Matrix\" trilogy was a huge hit, their \"Cloud Atlas\" and \"Speed Racer\" both flopped at the box office.\n\nCopyright © The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
