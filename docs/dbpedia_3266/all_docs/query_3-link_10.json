        "text": "Jupiter Ascending was a complex shoot, spanning six months and many different locations in England and America (while it was mostly filmed on location and in the studio in England, plenty of location filming was also done in Chicago).\n\nHere, I want to draw your attention to what’s probably one of the most obscure and unfamiliar shooting locations - Charterhouse Boys School in Godalming in Surrey. You might ask why it’s obscure, and I would explain that it’s because whatever was shot here is not (to the best of my knowledge) present in the final film.\n\nInformation on what was filmed here is virtually non-existent, with the evidence for it taking the form of several photos showing the production crew parked up (shooting at the school took place in July 2013) and a scattering of tweets only saved for posterity thanks to the extreme diligence of a German Sean Bean fan group. The tweets are as follows:\n\n\"some movie called Jupiter Ascending is filming in the Kings College Chapel and we were behind some actor who's been in Sherlock or something\"\n\n\"just saw a film crew going into godalming for the set of 'Jupiter ascending' which channing tatum and Mila kunis are in\"\n\n\"mila kunis, channing tatum, Douglas booth, Eddie redmayne, sean bean all breathing my air right now. filming as we speak holy crap\"\n\n\"filming at Charterhouse boys school\"\n\n\"met Lana Wachowski and saw Eddie Redmayne\"\n\nNow, most of these tweets are typically confused and misleading. What happens when people learn that a project is filming in their vicinity is that they look it up on imdb and immediately assume that every cast member involved in the project is present. This is why you have a tweet implying that Mila, Channing, Douglas, Eddie and Sean were all present - the person assumed they were there because they were all on the cast list, not because they had any first-hand information to that effect. The most important and potentially telling tweets, then, are the ones in bold.\n\nThe first bold tweet is confusing, because it doesn’t appear to be about filming at Charterhouse Boys School, instead referring to King’s College Chapel, which is a very grand and beautiful example of Gothic-style architecture. It’s also in Cambridge, which is a considerable distance from Surrey. The person was probably confused and mistakenly under the impression that Jupiter Ascending was filming there, which would also explain the odd reference to a Sherlock actor (no Sherlock actor appears in Jupiter Ascending).\n\nThe second bold tweet is much more concrete and intriguing, because it very specifically names Lana and Eddie as the main people present at the school for the shoot. This is important because the only location filming Eddie was involved with that made it into the final cut is the Bilbao/Zalintyre scene - beside that scene (which was filmed in 2014, months after principal photography wrapped), the rest of his extant material was, to the best of my knowledge, shot in the studio.\n\nI doubt we’ll ever know exactly what was filmed here, but it’s quite fascinating to speculate. The school was presumably used for filming because it offered up some distinctive and appealing architectural features, so if Eddie was the key actor present we can reasonably assume that the location was used to represent an unseen/unknown part of the refinery complex, and specifically Balem’s personal rooms (there’s nothing industrial about the school, so it would have been used to represent private quarters rather than a public part of the refinery)."
