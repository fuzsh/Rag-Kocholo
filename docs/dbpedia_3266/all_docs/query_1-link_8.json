        "text": "The big budget sci-fi flick Jupiter Ascending has been dropped from the summer movie lineup.\n\nThe $150 million film starring Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis was slated to open on July 18th, but will now debut February 6, 2015, according to Hollywood Reporter. Visual effects delays have been cited as the main reason for the push back move on the film co-financed by Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow and created by Lana and Andy Wachowski. Jen Yamato at Deadline reports that \"the Wachowskis needed more time to complete visual effects work on their CG-heavy space epic, which spans intergalactic worlds and follows the story of a woman (Kunis) who links up with a space warrior (Tatum) and learns sheâ€™s the heir to Earth. \"\n\nFebruary tends to be a movie graveyard, which the AP calls \"often a dumping ground for troubled movies.\"\n\nThe new release date for the film also means that Warner Brothers' Liam Neeson-fronted hitman movie Run All Night, will also need to be rescheduled, as the film was previously slated to be released on that day.\n\nThe date shuffle largely affects the marketing budgets for films, who have to rebrand and relaunch an entire campaign around a new date. Last minute film rescheduling is not unprecedented, and sometimes does not affect the end box office results, writes Pamela McClintock of the Hollywood Reporter:\n\n\"At the 11th hour, Paramount pushed G.I. Joe: Retaliation from its 2012 summer berth to March 2013 with no apparent downside in terms of the movie's performance. The sequel took in $375.7 million worldwide, besting the first G.I. Joe ($302.5 million). In an even more famous move, Paramount pushed back the release of World War Z, which went on to become a global blockbuster.\"\n\nRegardless the outcome, the delay adds to the Wachowski siblings' post-Matrix woes; their last two films flopped at the boxoffice, with the $102 million Cloud Atlas only grossing $27 million domestically and the $120+ million Speed Racer grossing $93 million worldwide.\n\nRead More Articles by Drew Tewksbury\n\n-Life After The Theme Song: \"True Detective\" Songwriters The Handsome Family and Musician James Iha Talk Music On Television\n\n-'Jodorowsky's Dune' Director Frank Pavich On The Art Of Independent Filmmaking"
