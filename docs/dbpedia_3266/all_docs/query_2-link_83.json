        "text": "Jupiter Jones:\n\nAre those flying boots?\n\nCaine Wise:\n\nThey harness the force of gravity, redirecting it into differential equation slips so you can surf.\n\nJupiter Jones:\n\nYeah, I heard \"gravity\" and \"surf\".\n\nCaine Wise:\n\nUp is hard, Down is easy.\n\nJupiter Jones:\n\nThank you, wow!\n\nJupiter Jones:\n\nIt's like my internal compass points directly at Mr. Wrong. Maybe it's my genes. Maybe I have defective engineering, too. [moving closer] And if that's the case, is there anyway to fix it?\n\nCaine Wise:\n\n[backing away] You are royalty now. I'm a splice, you don't understand what that means. I have more in common with a dog than I have with you.\n\nJupiter Jones:\n\nI love dogs, I've always loved dogs.\n\nJupiter Jones:\n\nBecause a dream is the only way any of this make sense.\n\nCaine Wise:\n\nCompared to what? The idea that you're the only intelligent species, on the only inhabitable planet, in a universe so full of planets that you don't even have a number to describe how many there are.\n\nBalem Abrasax:\n\nStop. [Balem \"freezes time\" in the operating room where Caine meets Jupiter, as the scene slowly takes place around him] There you are... [he stoops down to look at Jupiter as she is floating in the operating room] You know there are times when I actually miss you. Because no one understood this universe like you did. No one understood me [his voice breaks] like you did.\n\nBalem Abrasax:\n\n[sitting on his throne with his back to Jupiter] You should have stayed dead.\n\nJupiter Jones:\n\n[angrily] I am not your mother.\n\nBalem Abrasax:\n\n[scoffing] No, my mother never cleaned a toilet in her life.\n\nJupiter Jones:\n\nMaybe that was her problem.\n\n[first lines]\n\nJupiter Jones:\n\nTechnically speaking, I'm an alien. And from the perspective of Immigration, an illegal one. My parents met at the University in Saint Petersburg, where he taught Astrophysics, and she taught Applied Mathematics. My mother fell in love with him when she found him almost frozen to death on the bank of the Neva, staring up at the stars.\n\nKalique Abrasax:\n\n[steps out of her rejuvenation pool] Each of us has the code for our optimal physical condition. The problem is our genes have an expiration date, which is transferred to ourselves. A long time ago someone figured out how to replace deteriorating cells with new ones. Today it's as easy as changing a light bulb.\n\nJupiter Jones:\n\nWhere do you get these light bulbs?\n\nKalique Abrasax:\n\nWe grow them.\n\nJupiter Jones:\n\nLike clones?\n\nKalique Abrasax:\n\nNo. Clones lack genetic plasticity. Several million years ago a gene plague caused by cloning by nearly annihilated the entire human race.\n\nJupiter Jones:\n\nI was told that Abrasax is the seed of earth. Is that where you get it?\n\nKalique Abrasax:\n\nYour earth is a very small part of a very large industry... Feel my skin.\n\nJupiter Jones:\n\nOh, wow.\n\nKalique Abrasax:\n\nIn your world, people are used to fighting for resources like oil and minerals and land. But when you have access to the vastness of space, you realize, there's only one resource worth fighting over - even killing for. More time. Time is the single most precious commodity in the universe.\n\nDiomika Tsing:\n\nIf there's anything we can do to make the journey easier, you let us know.\n\nStinger Apini:\n\nActually, you know what, I'm feeling a little over-dressed, so if you have something I can change into. By myself. While I'm awake. [looking back toward Caine]\n\nCaine Wise:\n\nWhat?"
