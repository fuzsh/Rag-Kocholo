        "text": "Warner Bros. has pushed back the Wachowski siblings’ latest sci-fi extravaganza “Jupiter Ascending” to Feb. 6, 2015 from its original July 18 release date.\n\nChanning Tatum and Mila Kunis star in “Jupiter Ascending” alongside Eddie Redmayne, Douglas Booth and Sean Bean.\n\nAn individual familiar with the project told TheWrap that the delay was necessary due to the film’s intensive VFX, which will not be completed in time for an international rollout this summer.\n\n“Jupiter Ascending” will now open against Lionsgate’s Johnny Depp movie “Mortdecai,” and Universal and Legendary’s long-delayed fantasy film “Seventh Son,” which stars Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore.\n\nWarner Bros. has already moved its Liam Neeson crime thriller “Run All Night” to an unspecified 2015 release date to avoid competing with itself for the young male audience that “Jupiter” is expected to attract.\n\n“Jupiter Ascending” has been plagued by bad buzz since its initial trailer and many industry insiders have predicted it would underperform at the summer box office, given its hefty price tag, which is believed to be north of $150 million.\n\nMovies that benefit from “Jupiter’s” abrupt exit from the summer movie calendar include Universal’s sequel “The Purge: Anarchy,” Sony’s comedy “Sex Tape,” Fox Searchlight’s sci-fi movie “I Origins” and Focus’ Zach Braff movie “Wish I Was Here.”\n\nThe Wachowskis are coming off of the three-hour sci-fi epic “Cloud Atlas,” which was a critical and commercial disappointment."
