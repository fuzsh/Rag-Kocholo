        "text": "Better late than never, they say. And so six months after its announced July release date, Warner Bros. will release “Jupiter Ascending,” on Feb. 6.\n\nWriter/directors and producers Andy and Lana Wachowskis promise the $175 million film is “a science fiction space opera unlike any you’ve seen before.”\n\nThe delay, they said, was because they needed to finish the film’s more than 2,000 special effects. It filmed for four months last summer at Cinespace.\n\nLast week at Sundance, two hour “Jupiter Ascending” turned out to be Sundance’s invitation-only (but not extended to critics) “secret screening.” Arriving guests were given 3D glasses to see the film projected in 3D.\n\nThe reception was cool, no applause during the closing credits, and some walkouts, Variety reported. But it also reminded that Sundance is a venue for highbrow films and “Jupiter Ascending” is aimed at 16 year old boys.\n\nThe Wachowskis and star Channing Tatum did not attend the screening.\n\nMila Kunis is the Jupiter of the title, who gets targeted by a ruthless son (Eddie Redmayne) of a powerful family that live on a planet in need of a new heir. So she travels with a genetically engineered warrior (Channing) to the planet in order to stop the tyrant’s reign."
