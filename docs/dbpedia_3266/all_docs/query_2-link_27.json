        "text": "Oh what a horrible mistake I made. Written and directed by The Wachowskis, \"Jupiter\" is so bad it made me want never to go out to the movies again.\n\nThe plot is ridiculous, but it's the inept and tedious script that seals the deal.\n\nSee, it's only ten minutes into the movie that we meet the ancient human aristocrat siblings from another planet who have been harvesting rejuvenating lifeblood from species on planets around the universe and who plan to do the same to planet Earth, which they actually seeded with humans after having first wiped out the dinosaurs.\n\nAfter that ham-fisted exposition, it's no surprise when earthling cleaning lady Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), who is introduced with an equally ham-fisted voiceover about her parents, encounters aliens and wolf-human hybrid Caine Wise (Channing Tatum) and gets swept up in an adventure. She doesn't seem surprised either — and as a Kunis fan I'm going to do her the credit of blaming the script and not her acting.\n\nCompare that to exposition in \"The Matrix,\" which is the one good movie I've seen by The Wachowskis. That movie grabs you from the first scene, as protagonist Neo (Keanu Reeves) receives a mysterious message and is sent running for his life, and there's a dramatic buildup before he takes the plunge and learns the shocking truth about the world (that humans are being harvested by, in that case, machines). \"Jupiter\" treats a comparable plot with the drama of a Wikipedia page.\n\nThe Wachowski's latest doesn't get any better from there. Jones, after learning she is the genetic second coming of one of those ancient aristocrats, suffers through boring and repetitive encounters with all of her new family members, as they pretend to be her friends and she almost falls for it long enough to sign away her rights.\n\nThe directors \"make world domination as boring as filing your taxes,\" notes BI's Brett Arnold.\n\nWe are also treated to a cornfield showdown that feels like a knockoff of \"Looper\"; space rogue hijinks that feel like a knockoff of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\"; a Steampunk bureaucracy that feels like a knockoff of \"Brazil\" — with a Terry Gilliam cameo to boot; and a wedding that feels like a knockoff of \"The Princess Bride.\"\n\nThen there are ludicrous details, like how the guy who settled on a bee farm happens to be named Stinger Apine (Sean Bean) — that's Stinger as in bee stinger and Apine as a play on the Latin apis meaning bee.\n\nAnd that part only gets more ridiculous when Jones visits and learns that she has the power to control bees because bees have the ability to recognize royalty — not just bee royalty but also humans who are genetically identical to those ancient humans who rule the universe.\n\nMeanwhile, Wise is not developed at all, and the only significance of his wolf splicing seems to be pointed ears and stoicism. This humorless character is a waste of Tatum's comedic talent and charm, and it makes for a painfully awkward romance with Jones.\n\nWise: \"I have more in common with dogs than I do with you.\"\n\nJones: \"I love dogs.\"\n\nDumb movies can be fun, but this one is just boring, and it drags out for 127 minutes.\n\nThe only redeeming qualities of the movie are good special effects, production design, and — to a certain extent — action sequences.\n\nThere is great part early on when Wise, equipped with awesome gravity boots that let him surf on anything, a energy shield, and a directed-energy gun, embarrasses a group of space mercenaries and follows it up by winning an aerial fight in Chicago against a bunch of aliens with cool spaceships.\n\nBut the action sequences go on too long, and at a certain point watching so much CGI becomes as interesting as watching \"Halo.\" This was most apparent in the climactic aerial battle between Wise and a winged lizard person in the middle of an exploding base on Jupiter: Strip away the CGI and you're left with Tatum's face spinning in a circle for five minutes.\n\nWhile this movie might fare better among non-native English speakers, it seems likely to be a flop, which was expected last summer when Warner Bros. abruptly pushed the movie back 10 months only weeks before it was due in theaters — and it's off to a bad start on opening weekend."
