        "text": "In a pretty dramatic last-minute manoeuvre, Warner Bros. has moved the release date of Jupiter Ascending from July 18 to Feb 6, 2015.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, insiders are saying that the $150m movie “needed more special effects work,” but it’s still very late in the day to be delaying one of the studio’s big summer releases.\n\nDirected by Andy and Lana Wachowski, the film is a futuristic sci-fi that stars Channing Tatum as a pointy-eared space warrior and Mila Kunis as an intergalactic queen, and looks somewhat insane if the below trailer is anything to go by."
