        "text": "Well, you can never say that The Wachowski siblings do anything half-assed.\n\nThe second trailer for their upcoming intergalactic, action packed, thriller, romance movie Jupiter Ascending has hit the web and it’s nothing short of mind bending. I’ve read the synopsis, I’ve watched the trailer and I’m still unsure of what’s in store for me when the film arrives in theaters July 18th 2014. Known for films such as the loved The Matrix and the more divisive Cloud Atlas the directing duo know how to make their mark. Keen on hyper visual spectacles they follow through with their vision. As a fan of the recent Cloud Atlas (aside from a few squabbles I thought it was an immensely beautiful film to watch and easily one of the most inventive) I can’t help but fell a nudge of excitement for the movie.\n\nIs it comprehensible as of yet? Not quite, but maybe that’s a good thing since as of late it seems as if we’re given movies entire stories before we’ve even sat down in a theater to see it. The Wachowski’s are some of the more daring filmmakers today and whether you love them or hate them, they always try and entertain. The film stars Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis, Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne, Doona Bae and more. An eclectic cast such as that already has my attention.\n\nSci-Fi Epic Adventure. From the streets of Chicago to the far-flung galaxies whirling through space, “Jupiter Ascending” tells the story of Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), who was born under a night sky, with signs predicting she was destined for great things. Now grown, Jupiter dreams of the stars but wakes up to the cold reality of a job cleaning other people’s houses and an endless run of bad breaks. Only when Caine (Channing Tatum), a genetically engineered ex-military hunter, arrives on Earth to track her down does Jupiter begin to glimpse the fate that has been waiting for her all along—her genetic signature marks her as next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos.\n\nAdvertisement"
