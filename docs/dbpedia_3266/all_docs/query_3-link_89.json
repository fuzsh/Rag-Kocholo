        "text": "J upiter Ascending is a sharp descent for everyone involved.\n\nThe sci-fi film's reported $175 million budget must have gone largely into loopy production design, wild costumes, outlandish hairstyles and colorful make-up. It certainly didn't go into developing a coherent script or coaching believable performances (*½ out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).\n\nThe story is laughably inane and uninvolving. The brains behind The Matrix movies, Lana and Andy Wachowski, are responsible for this ambitious misfire.\n\nA ridiculous intergalactic action-adventure, Jupiter even draws a risible portrayal from an Oscar-nominated actor.\n\nFor those who want their image of Eddie Redmayne as a consummate actor capable of a moving portrayal of Steven Hawking to remain intact, stay far away from this movie. The creepy, whispery voice he affects for his villainous role is one part Don Corleone, one part Lord Voldemort and several parts absurdly melodramatic.\n\nJupiter is a convoluted, design-happy space opera whose special effects are underwhelming and whose story grows ever more absurd as it goes along.\n\nIf nothing else, the eye candy is sweet: Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) is squired about by hunky and chivalrous Caine (an often shirtless Channing Tatum in guy-liner and pointy elf ears). He lands on Earth, flies around in hover boots and sweeps her up into the stratosphere. His mission is to protect her from power-mad alien siblings — Balem (Redmayne), Kalique (Tuppence Milddleton) and Titus (Douglas Booth) — each bent on Jupiter's destruction. Evidently, she shares their dead mother's genetic composition and as such looms large and in charge. Jupiter has a particularly unappealing life, spending most of her days cleaning toilets in Chicago. When not scrubbing porcelain, she feels misunderstood by her extended Russian immigrant family. When she finds out she's heir to a vast space empire it would seem to be thrilling news. Or at least it's supposed to be for us mere mortals watching the movie.\n\nJupiter occasionally feels derivative, with whiffs of Star Wars, Princess Diaries, Dune and even a bit of Star Trek. But when Jupiter asks, of no one in particular, \"Could this get any weirder?\" we echo her sentiments.\n\nProlonged action sequences, with a host of creatures including some reptilian hybrids, have a video game feel. And oddly, Jupiter appears to jog delicately from escalating peril, rather than running full-speed ahead.\n\nAfter Caine sweeps Jupiter off to a farm run by beekeeper Stinger (Sean Bean), everyone there begins addressing her as \"Your Majesty.\" The reason for the title, she's told, is that the bees act differently around her. Apparently, she can manipulate their swarming.\n\n\"Bees are genetically designed to recognize royalty,\" Stinger explains. Bean deserves an Oscar nomination for delivering that line with a straight face.\n\nEverything else about the movie is equally preposterous. Sometimes it feels like an elaborate send-up of interplanetary action movies. But thudding attempts at actual humor only make the unintentional comedy that much more odious.\n\nJupiter spends some time on distant planets, but misses her drab existence on Earth. So does the audience. At least that made sense."
