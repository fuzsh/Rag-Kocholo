        "text": "Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) was born under a night sky, with signs predicting that she was destined for great things. Now grown, Jupiter dreams of the stars but wakes up to the cold reality of a job cleaning toilets and an endless run of bad breaks.\n\nOnly when Caine (Channing Tatum), a genetically engineered ex-military hunter, arrives on Earth to track her down does Jupiter begin to glimpse the fate that has been waiting for her all along â€“ her genetic signature marks her as next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos.\n\nFrom the streets of Chicago to far flung galaxies whirling through space, Jupiter Ascending was conceived and written by the Wachowski siblings (The Matrix trilogy, Cloud Atlas), who are also directing.\n\nAward-winning producer Grant Hill, with whom the writer/directors have collaborated since 'The Matrix' Trilogy, is producing the film together with the Wachowskis. Roberto Malerba and Bruce Berman are serving as executive producers."
