But despite the plethora of books, films, exhibitions, and articles on the period, its prevailing image remains, in the Anglo-American world especially, surprisingly simplistic. It is often viewed as an era of accelerated socio-cultural progress on the one hand and extreme politico-economic unrest on the other. This dichotomy has been central to almost every major treatment of the Weimar Republic since its implosion in 1933. Christopher Isherwood’s 1939 novel Goodbye to Berlin, with its flighty flappers, fey gents and Nazi thugs, set the tone, its subsequent adaptations for musical theatre and film cementing the place this stock cast held in the popular imagination over the following decades. Many historians too consider a politico-cultural divergence as ‘typical’ of (Kolb, 1988), even ‘integral’ to (Peukert, 1992), the Weimar period. Over forty years ago, however, Hermand and Trommler pointed out that such dichotomous interpretations were frequently driven by contemporary agendas – social, historical, and political. During the Cold War, for instance, western scholars turned the Bauhaus into an emblem of artistic freedom by conflating its aesthetic modernity with liberal democracy. The Berlin Wall fell twenty years ago, but current works on the Republic – often of good quality – still bear titles that encourage dichotomous analyses: Promise and Tragedy (Weitz, 2007), Glitter and Doom (Metropolitan Museum, 2006), Utopia and Despair (West, 2000). A reassessment of this important period in German history, without ulterior agendas, is now overdue. This conference will focus, therefore, on the experiences of the Weimar Republic’s contemporaries, rather than on the demands of its successors. It will provide a flexible forum where points of intersection and divergence between public and personal histories in all aspects of both the period itself and of its historiography can be examined, in order to begin the work of replacing those dichotomies that continue to mark the Republic’s reception to date with a more nuanced image of the era.

While hiking in the woods, Steve Prosser listened intently to the warbling songs of birds.An ear training professor at Berklee College of Music, he absorbed the intricate harmonies and transcribed them into musical compositions, a process his brother, Mark, said was remarkable to watch. “It was almost like an orchestra conductor pointing to his musicians in the woods,” Mark said.Dr. Prosser, who along with teaching at Berklee was a studio vocalist, composer, jazz pianist, and lawyer, had undergone gall bladder surgery and died Oct. 10 in his home in the Back Bay, apparently of complications from a fall. He was 60. “My teaching style is consciously Socratic rather than didactic,” he wrote for his Berklee faculty webpage. “I musically demonstrate the materials and techniques myself, in order to demonstrate mastery, and then ask the students pointedly related questions.” Alongside his students, he wrote, “we come to an understanding of the methods of study, the meaning of the material, and the desired musical results. I choose this style because students need to understand the ‘why’ of the music — not just the ‘what.’ I also discover something new about music from every class of students.”His brother, who lives in Radford, Va., said Dr. Prosser was a master teacher who never acted as though he were better than his students. “He wasn’t above his class,” Mark said. “He was with his class.”Hired to teach at Berklee upon graduating from the school in 1979, Dr. Prosser was an associate professor until 1992. From 1992 to 1998, he was assistant chairman of the ear training department, which teaches students to sight-read music and transcribe what they hear. From 1998 to 2008, Dr. Prosser was chairman of the department.He stayed on as a professor in the department until his death, and also led Berklee’s jazz choir from 1979 to 1990.In 1981, he met Kris Adams while she was a student at Berklee. Adams later became a professor at the school, and they married on Jan. 2, 1987. They divorced in 2006, and remained close friends.Adams, who lives in Holliston, cared for Dr. Prosser during his last few months. He was full of life, she said, and had a sharp wit.“He had a very big personality,” Adams said.Born in 1952, he grew up in Altoona, Pa. His father, William, served as mayor of Altoona, and his mother, Elizabeth, had been a nurse during World War II.His parents were young when they died, and Dr. Prosser turned to music to cope with the loss, his brother said.“Music was his thing that helped him survive a lot of this stress and pain,” Mark said. “He was gifted.”Mark said that when Dr. Prosser was about 5, he began playing the organ and other keyboards. He started playing drums in middle school and then joined a band in high school.After graduating from Altoona Area High School in 1970, Dr. Prosser toured the country before deciding to attend Berklee.Dr. Prosser also graduated from Suffolk University in 1989 with a master’s in educational administration. In 1992, he received a doctorate from Boston College in curriculum, instruction, and administration in higher education.He graduated from Suffolk University Law School in 1998 and was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar the following year.Paul Stiller, a Berklee professor who studied under Dr. Prosser in the late 1980s, said he thrived most when he was in class.A tough professor, Dr. Prosser could also use his sense of humor to keep his students on their toes “with a zinger in two seconds.”“He had a way of joking around with the class,” Stiller said, but treated all his students with respect and cared deeply about their success.“He wanted everybody to be excellent, he didn’t want you to be an A-minus,” Stiller said. “That wasn’t good enough.”Dr. Prosser also could be quirky, Stiller added, and would take his cat, Coda, for walks in a stroller.Services will be held in the spring for Dr. Prosser, who also wrote two books: “Essential Ear Training for Today’s Musician” and “Intervallic Ear Training for Musicians.” He was a member of the Associated Grant Makers of Boston, which promotes effective and responsible philanthropy, and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, a performers’ union.Dr. Prosser hired 20 to 25 of the 35 people in the ear training department, Stiller said, and many of them knew him when they had attended Berklee as students.Stiller added that he was inspired to become a professor at Berklee by Dr. Prosser.“He was a mentor in a lot of ways,” Stiller said. “He’s someone you’d want to emulate.”In his Berklee biography, Mr. Prosser wrote that teaching was his passion because of the strong relationships he had with students and colleagues.“I have learned an important truth during my 30 years at Berklee: No thing or person can alter the passionate musical bond between our diverse student body and our tremendously talented faculty,” he wrote.Roberta Radley, the ear training department’s assistant chair, said Dr. Prosser was an extremely honest and passionate teacher who remains one of Berklee’s legendary figures.“He had kind of two sides to him,” she said. “He was extremely powerful and had strong opinions and was quite an intellectual leader here at the college, and definitely campaigned for quality in education.”Dr. Prosser also “had quite the sense of humor, and if he were your friend, he would go to bat for you to the end.”Katherine Landergan can be reached at klandergan@globe.com.\n\n教育\n\n2016-50/2785/en_head.json.gz/4374\n\n1997 Release: CIDR Enter word(s) to search Español Research Funding Current Grants Education and Training Funding Extramural Research News Features Funding Divisions Funding Opportunities Funded Programs and Projects Grant Information NIH RePORTER Research at NHGRI DIR Calendar DIR News Features NHGRI Affiliated Centers Online NHGRI Research Resources Publications, Books and Resources Research Investigators For Patients and the Public Community Engagement & Community Health Resources Family History Initiative Finding Reliable Health Information Online Genetic and Genomic Science and Research Genetic & Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) Genomic Medicine and Health Care Online Health Resources Competency & Curricular Resources Genetics 101 Genomic Medicine and Health Care Genomic Medicine Working Group New Horizons and Research Patient Management Policy and Ethics Issues Quick Links for Patient Care All About the Human Genome Project Genetic Education Resources for Teachers Genomic Careers National DNA Day Online Education Kit Online Genetics Education Resources Smithsonian NHGRI Genome Exhibition Talking Glossary: English Talking Glossary: Español Coverage & Reimbursement of Genetic Tests Genomics and Health Disparities Genetic Discrimination Human Subjects Research Informed Consent for Genomics Research Online Bioethics Resources Privacy in Genomics Regulation of Genetic Tests Statute and Legislation Database Current News Releases Image Gallery GenomeTV Media Contacts NHGRI-Related News Journal Articles from NHGRI Health Professional Education Intramural Training Office Online Careers & Training Resources Training Programs: Funding Training Programs: Intramural Working at NHGRI Budget and Financial Information Institute Advisors Long-Range Planning Minority and Special Populations NHGRI History of Genomics Program News Release Archives 1994-2015 News Release Archives 1997 & 1998 1997 Release: Breast Cancer Risk Study 1997 Release: Health Insurance in the Age of Genetics 1998 Release: Complete Animal's Genome Sequence NIH and Johns Hopkins Establish a New Center to Study Genetic and Environmental Origins of Common Disorders January 1997 BETHESDA, Md. - In a creative government-university partnership, components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) School of Medicine have established a new research center to analyze common disorders caused by the actions of multiple genes and interactions with the environment. The new Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR, pronounced SY-der) will give scientists a powerful new approach to understanding common but poorly understood modern-day disorders such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Operating under a $21.8 million NIH contract over the next five years, CIDR is housed in a 14,000 square-foot facility at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore. Expected to be fully operational in the spring of 1997, the Center will employ a staff of about 25. CIDR represents a partnership among eight components of the National Institutes of Health, the federal government's largest biomedical research institution, and Hopkins, which is home to a world-renowned medical genetics program. The eight NIH participants are: the National Center for Human Genome Research (NHGRI), which serves as the lead component, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD), the National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders (NIDCD), the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the National Institute on Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The interest of so many of the NIH institutes in pursuing the genetic basis of today's most common and confounding diseases signals a significant transition in our approach to understanding disease and opens the door to exciting new strategies for treatments and prevention, says Harold Varmus, M.D., Director of NIH. \"Hopkins' commitment to molecular medicine and gene research is reflected in and strengthened by this Center,\" said William R. Brody, M.D., Ph.D., president of Johns Hopkins University (JHU). So far, scientists have been quick to apply new gene-finding tools developed by the Human Genome Project (HGP) to uncover disease genes. These tools now make it possible for an investigator looking for a single gene to isolate it in a matter of months instead of years or even decades. And indeed, the number of single disease genes identified using these tools has increased dramatically over the past few years. Understanding the inheritance of single-gene disorders -- the so-called Mendelian disorders -- is relatively straightforward because their hereditary patterns were well established a century ago and are still reliable today. But most diseases of modern life -- cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and a host of neuro-psychiatric disorders -- seem to result from the activities of several genes and the interplay between a human body and its environment. The direct causes of these disorders have been hard to elucidate because they appear to be intertwined in complicated ways that have so far resisted the tools of modern science. Several genes seem to contribute to such disorders, but the effect of each gene is rather weak, making it much more difficult to understand why some members of a family develop chronic disorders while others do not. New technologies now give us the power to go after the genetic origins of ordinary diseases that are caused by multiple genes, says Robert Nussbaum, M.D., who came to NHGRI three years ago with the aim of developing a center for studying the genetics of complex disorders. As the CIDR mastermind, he will oversee the contract from the NIH side. David Valle, M.D., Hopkins professor of pediatrics, serves as acting director of CIDR while a search is underway to fill the post. CIDR will specialize in a technique known as genotyping -- sorting through the entire genetic complement, or genome, of disease-prone family members to search for not one, but many gene regions associated with that disease. A person's genotype refers to his or her own arrangement of the DNA letters, A, T, C or G, in a particular region of their genome and may be different from one person to the next. Differences in genotype may point scientists toward DNA regions that are involved in a disease. Whole-genome analysis allows researchers to find lots of possible disease-related changes in a person's DNA. Though focusing on genotyping, CIDR research will take place across five main components: 1) Statistical Genetics, which applies the power of statistics to the hereditary patterns of genes to determine modes of inheritance from parents to their children; 2) Genetic Epidemiology, which applies genetic analysis gathered from disease-prone families to the general population to determine if the genetic patterns of the research families hold in large, diverse populations; 3) Medical Informatics and Database Management, which uses computer programs to store, manipulate and analyze the research data; 4) Genotyping using state-of-the-art technology to rapidly scan whole genomes for multiple gene regions associated with a particular disorder; and 5) Technology Development, which continues to refine existing and generate new ways to perform high-capacity genotyping efficiently and cost effectively. Scientists estimate that determining the genotypes at 300 to 400 locations in DNA will give them dense enough sampling to identify places likely to contain disease genes. In studies of large groups, hundreds of thousands of genotypes must be performed to find all the regions that contain genes related to a particular disease. Under full capacity, CIDR researchers expect to analyze the genetics of six to nine complex disorders per year. CIDR will charge investigators funded by a participating NIH institute a reduced rate of $1.00 per genotype; investigators funded by non-participating sources will pay $3.50 per genotype. To use CIDR, scientists in academic labs, NIH, and industry will submit research proposals to a panel of scientists. The scientists will make recommendations to a CIDR governing board made up of directors of the NIH institutes that fund the center.

The skills required to write good anti-virus software are far removed from those needed to write a virus. With 80,000 viruses in existence there can be no excuse for teaching students on how to create more.\" Hruska was reacting to the news that the University of Calgary in Canada has confirmed it will be running a virus writing course for students later this year. \"The university's justification for this course is entirely misguided,\" continued Hruska. \"There is no need to make code self-replicating to test new vulnerabilities or features which could appear in future viruses. The essential component that makes it a virus - self-replication - can be left out. We hope the university comes to its senses quickly.\" Sophos stresses that it does not have an issue with people wishing to study computer security or the techniques which viruses and malicious software can use. However, it does not believe that writing new viruses is a useful way to learn more about the subject. The University of Calgary has so far declined to comment on whether it believes it would be financially or legally responsible if any of the viruses written on its course were to break out and infect innocent users.

The voices of more than 10,000 adolescent boys and girls were heard loud and clear as they marched across Bangladesh last week. Chanting “We are the leaders; we will stop AIDS” and wearing special T-shirts, their message resonated across the country. In one area of Dhaka, the capital city, police closed a major road to give them room for their demonstration, which attracted the curiosity of bystanders. Leading by example, the adolescents rallied together to promote HIV and AIDS awareness to mark World AIDS Day, truly embodying the 2008 theme “Lead – Empower – Deliver”. Although Bangladesh is still considered to be a low prevalence country for HIV-AIDS (with a prevalence rate of less than 1 per cent), prevention efforts are crucial to prevent the epidemic to spread among vulnerable groups, especially young people. According to the recent Children and AIDS, Third Stocktaking Report 2008 published by four UN agencies, only 16 per cent of girls aged between 15 and 24 have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV. Yet, as in many countries, young Bangladeshis are at risk of HIV. More than 40 per cent of HIV infections globally occur among young people. But young people can also play a critical role in raising awareness and promoting safe behaviour. This is one of the objectives of UNICEF's Adolescent Empowerment project, ‘Kichori Abhijan’: to inform adolescents on HIV-AIDS and safe behaviours. Supported by the European Commission, the project encourages adolescents to become actively involved in the prevention drive. Under the project, peer leaders receive life skills training that equips them to tackle issues of HIV-AIDs among others. Adolescents become agents of change by encouraging conversations within communities and breaking some of the taboos surrounding reproductive health. This year, thousands of adolescents involved in the project, which is implemented in collaboration with NGOs BRAC and CMES, helped coordinate rallies and other awareness raising activities, disseminate information and encourage dialogue about HIV and AIDS. Trained Peer Leaders, such as Shati (17) and Rokon (17) who live in Mirpur in the north-west of, Dhaka, have been working together with their friends to plan for World AIDS Day. Shati and Rokon developed rally slogans and scripts for theater plays on HIV-AIDS and helped organise a girls’ soccer match at the community ground. – a novelty in a country where girls playing football is unusual. After the match, adolescents from the local centre staged a play highlighting key messages on HIV. “HIV is very dangerous. I want people to know about it so I joined the rally. In Bangladesh HIV/ AIDS is a problem that is difficult to discuss it in our society. People think that it’s not a risk because we don’t live a western style of life, but everyone needs to know about these things to protect themselves,” Shati said. “When I joined the adolescent centre,” says Rokon, “I spoke to my male and female friends and at school. I also discussed the topic of HIV-AIDS with my family. It is important for us, as adolescents, to know about HIV and AIDS, but it is also important for everyone – young and old.” UNICEF Child Protection Officer Mads Sorensen said World AIDS Day activities organized by adolescents across Bangladesh aimed at encouraging group discussion sessions with parents and community leaders. “By building understanding and awareness on HIV and AIDS among families and communities, we will contribute to further strengthen the protective environment surrounding children and adolescents,” Mads said. “Adolescents, especially girls, also need the support of their communities to take active roles and participate positively in their communities. Their active participation here in Dhaka today demonstrates that this is possible if they are empowered”. World AIDS Day rallies and awareness raising activities were held in Panchagor, Nilphamari, Nowgaon, Rajshahi, Chapai, Jamalpur, Sherpur, Cox's Bazar, Dhaka, Kushtia, Sylhet, Chandpur, Comilla, Joypurhat and Gainanda (coordinated by BRAC) and in Chittagong, Barguna, Rangpur and Chapai (coordinated by CMES). Why is World AIDS Day important? World AIDS Day is an opportunity for individuals and organisations from around the world to come together to focus attention on the global AIDS epidemic. According to UNAIDS, today, 5.5 million young p[eople aged 15-24 are estimated to be living with HIV. 45 percent of all new cases in 2007 were found among those 15-24 years old. On average, about 30% of males and 19 per cent of females aged 15-24 in developing countires have comprehensive and coorect knowledge about HIV and how to avoid transmission. These knowledge levels are far below the goal of comprehensive HIV knowledge of 95 per cent among young people by 2010, as set by the UN General Assembly Special Sessions 9on HIV-AIDS (UNGASS) in 2001.

Her talk, “The Promise of Nanomaterials for Thermoelectric Applications,” is free and open to the public. Once dubbed the “Queen of Carbon Science” for her widely recognized research on carbon science and carbon nanostructures, Dresselhaus has spent more than 40 years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she became the first woman to receive the title of Institute Professor, the highest faculty honor. She also has been honored for her work in nanoscience and nanotechnology, and is credited as one of the researchers whose work on low dimensional thermoelectricity in the early 1990s led to the resurgence of the thermoelectrics field. Growing up poor in the Bronx, Dresselhaus attended Hunter College in the city, where she began as a math major with the hope of becoming an elementary school teacher. While at Hunter, she met her mentor, Nobel Prize-winning nuclear physicist Rosalyn Yalow, who encouraged her to study science. Dresselhaus eventually received a Fulbright Fellowship to study at Cambridge University’s Cavendish Laboratory. She earned her master’s degree at Radcliffe and her Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. The author or co-author of more than 1,300 publications including books, book chapters, invited review articles and peer reviewed journal articles, Dresselhaus is the co-inventor on five U.S. patents. Dresselhaus has received numerous awards, including the National Medal of Science and 25 honorary doctorates worldwide. In 2009, the National Science Board presented her with its Vannevar Bush Award “for her leadership through public service in science and engineering, her perseverance and advocacy in increasing opportunities for women in science, and for her extraordinary contributions in the field of condensed-matter physics and nanoscience.” In 2010, Union awarded her an honorary doctorate of science at Commencement. The Steinmetz Memorial Lecture series commemorates world-renowned engineer Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1865-1923), professor of electrical engineering at Union from 1902 to 1913 and former president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Created in 1925, the series has brought dozens of eminent scientists, engineers and innovators to campus. For more information, click here.

Shown here are Kerry Woods, left, and Kaci Brasher. By Trevor AndersonThe Spartanburg Herald-Journaltrevor.anderson@shj.comPublished: Saturday, February 16, 2013On a lime green wall in Scott Cochran's office, the dean of Wofford College's Mungo Center for Professional Excellence uses a dry erase marker to draw a picture.The image he depicts is that of a square.To the casual observer, it might appear to be an average quadrangle, with congruent sides and four right angles. But in Cochran's entrepreneurial-centric world, it carries significant meaning.The interior of the box is a metaphor for what he calls “the space.” It's a place where interdisciplinary studies, curiosity, hard work and preparation converge and come into focus.Outside of the box, those concepts become vague and peripheral. Within the box, anything is possible.And that is what he's aiming for within the walls of the Mungo Center.Cochran said it's a space where students can launch their business ideas through mentoring, networking, project-based experience, and consulting and project management — a step up from the job listing and resume editing services traditionally offered by college career offices.“This is where higher education needs to go,” Cochran said. “I really believe that we are staking out new territory. We are on the tip of the spear.”Cochran, a 1988 graduate of Wofford and father of three, stepped away from a lucrative career in finance to teach. He developed and founded the Mungo Center in 2010, starting in a small office in the Campus Life building.“I was out there (in the corporate world) interviewing people, and I noticed that many of them just seemed to be missing x or y,” Cochran said. “We developed these programs around those x's and y's to make our students better prepared when they leave college.”Last year, the center took up residence in the college's new, three-story Michael S. Brown Village Center. Completed in the fall of 2011, the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED Silver certified building houses 80 students in four-bedroom apartments on the top two floors. The building includes office and meeting spaces, classrooms, a market and a café.The Mungo Center's wing is on the ground floor. The facility is clean and contemporary. Students huddle at round tables, drinking coffee and talking. They have access to technology and other amenities. The walls are painted with whiteboard paint, and the students are encouraged to write their ideas on them.“This was the perfect fit for us,” Cochran said. “It gives us more visibility, and allows us to do a lot of things. The students really like it. It's a great place for them to do what they need to do. It feels like a place where anything can get done.”On Saturday, the center hosted a gala where it unveiled what Cochran referred to as “The Mungo Center 3.0,” which encompassed the launch of its new “The Space” brand and programs designed to give more students an opportunity to participate.A crowd that included local business leaders, alumni, donors, potential investors and others were able to take a look at 14 student-led companies competing in the center's business plan competition. It also featured dozens of exhibits from the 60 students involved in its Success Initiative, a program open to students of all majors that emphasizes innovation and creative problem solvingCopyright © 2013 GoUpstate.com — All rights reserved.

This decision effected two students. The third new student was already planning to attend Holy Cross. Over the years we have tried to keep a balance between the distribution of our seminarians to various Orthodox seminaries here and abroad, especially St. Vladimir’s, St. Tikhon’s and Holy Cross. In fact, this year, we will have 10 students at St. Vladimir’s, 9 students at St. Tikhon’s and 6 students at Holy Cross. It has been our primary concern over the years to insure a strong priestly formation for our future priests. While all three schools have helped us in accomplishing this task for generations of clergymen, we feel Holy Cross most closely mirrors the practices and customs of the Patriarchate of Antioch in general and the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of North America in particular. This is true for a variety of reasons, first and foremost being the common Syro-Byzantine liturgical and musical tradition that we share. Given the changing demographics of the majority of our seminarians and the reality that many of them are not rooted in this Syro-Byzantine expression of our one Orthodox faith from birth, we feel it is vital to immerse them in this tradition in a more complete way. It is our hope to have our own seminary in the future. In fact, much of the foundational work has already been done. Nevertheless, since we do not have our own seminary at this point in time, we feel Holy Cross is best suited to accomplish the task at hand. At the same time, however, we will and have always assessed the common needs and concerns of both the seminarians and the Archdiocese and therefore leave all doors open for the future with regard to their placement.

Ballor In an interview promoting his recent book Faith in the Halls of Power: How Evangelicals Joined the American Elite, D. Michael Lindsay, describes what he sees to be the intellectual sources of evangelicalism: And the interesting thing is that the Presbyterian tradition, the Reformed tradition, has provided some of the intellectual gravitas for evangelical ascendancy. And it’s being promulgated in lots of creative ways so that you have the idea of Kuyper or a cultural commission of cultural engagement is being promulgated by Chuck Colson, who is a Baptist. So Presbyterians are – if I had to say what are the two main intellectual influences on the evangelical ascendancy – it’s Roman Catholicism, conservative Catholicism, embodied by, let’s say, Richard John Neuhaus in First Things. And it’s going to be Reformed theology coming out of places like the philosophy department at Calvin College. In 2002, a conference was held at Calvin College as part of recognition of the hundredth anniversary of Abraham Kuyper’s Stone Lectures at Princeton. The proceedings of the conference, “A Century of Christian Social Teaching: The Legacy of Leo XIII and Abraham Kuyper,” were published in the Journal of Markets & Morality, and included closing comments from Chuck Colson that illuminates a connection between the two sources of evangelical intellectualism that Lindsay identifies. Since 1992, I have been involved in an organization called Evangelicals and Catholics Together (ECT). (And I have the scars to show for what has often been a controversial undertaking.) Working for accord between people of goodwill from both communities is something I believe in very deeply, and I see this conference advancing that cause. The thoughts that I want to share with you tonight are inspired by that great Dutch theologian and statesman, Abraham Kuyper, and I do so, noting with particular pride that this is the one-hundredth anniversary of his famous Stone Lectures at Princeton University. Dr. Kuyper’s influence on my life has been profound. I was introduced to him by people here at Calvin. Another influence in my life is that of John Paul II. I suspect that our Catholic brethren here tonight would agree with me that someday he will be known not just as Pope John Paul II but as John Paul the Great—one of the most significant figures of the twentieth century. And while Kuyper rightly deserves credit for being one of the leading influences on American evangelicalism, so too does his contemporary Herman Bavinck warrant greater appreciation. Two notable publications this year testify to this. First, the fourth and final volume of the translation of Bavinck’s Reformed Dogmatics is newly available, Holy Spirit, Church, and New Creation. And secondly, a collection of articles and treatises by Bavinck on various topics has been translated in Essays on Religion, Science, and Society. The latter volume includes essays “On Inequality,” “Classical Education,” and “Ethics and Politics” that will be of special interest to PowerBlog readers. Update: See also, “The Roots of American Evangelicalism,” in five parts. Looking for Happiness, Finding Faith Thursday, May 29, 2008By Jonathan Spalink Dr. Arthur C. Brooks spoke about “happiness” at an Acton Lecture Series event last week. Dr. Brooks, a professor of Business and Government Policy at Syracuse University and a visiting scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, presented evidence which suggests that religion is the greatest factor in general human happiness in the United States. Religion, argues Dr. Brooks, is essential to human flourishing in the United States and public secularism should be strongly guarded against by everyone – religious or not. He is the author of, most recently, Gross National Happiness (2008) and Who Really Cares? (2006) published by Basic Books. We were able to interview Dr. Brooks about happiness – watch it now and see what you think!

European foreign aid caught between dishonesty and incompetence Wednesday, May 28, 2008By Bernd Bergmann International aid groups have criticized the EU and many of its member states for falling behind their promises to step up foreign aid to 0.5 per cent of GDP by 2010 and 0.7 per cent by 2015. On the one hand, these groups are right to expose the accounting tricks governments use in order to promote themselves as saviors of Africa. On the other hand, the aid groups should consider very carefully whether their focus on state aid is really the key towards future development in poor countries. The problem that they indicate is that the EU and its members classify some expenses as aid although these are only indirectly related to development. This includes debt restructuring and payments to cover housing of refugee claimants in Europe. The aid groups say that in 2007, EU nations spent around €8 billion in such non-aid items. They conclude that “on current trends, the EU will have given €75 billion less between 2005 and 2010 than was promised.” This kind of creative accounting should not be very surprising since politicians like to claim that they are helping the poorest countries in the world but also know that it is more difficult to tell taxpayers that they have to foot the bill. In such circumstances the most convenient thing to do is to artificially inflate the aid budget with non-aid expenses. The question remains: Is state-to-state aid the most effective way to promote development? Prof. Philip Booth explained at a recent conference organized by the Acton Institute in Rome that government aid has failed on countless occasions and has even entrenched underdevelopment on some occasions. Booth made clear that “at the empirical level, there appears to be a negative relationship between aid and growth. This does not imply cause and effect of course, but it should make us pause for thought. After the late 1970s, aid to Africa grew rapidly yet GDP growth collapsed and was close to zero or negative for over a decade from 1984. GDP growth in Africa did not start to pick up again until aid fell in the early-to-mid 1990s. In East Asia, South Asia and the Pacific, one also finds that, as aid reduced, national income increased rapidly.” It is important to note that Booth criticized government-to-government aid and not charity in general. Whereas transfers between governments have often resulted in rent-seeking and the strengthening of dubious regimes, private initiatives do not suffer from the same problems: “None of the points I have made relate to the exercise of charity. It is important to point out that we should not wait for a just ordering of the world or good governance in recipient countries before supporting charitable relief.” Aid groups such as Oxfam and Christian Aid would do well to turn their focus away from pressuring governments to spend more on aid and instead strengthen their efforts to encourage private initiatives. Book Review: Carl Anderson’s A Civilization of Love Tuesday, May 27, 2008By Michael Severance On March 29, Carl Anderson’s A Civilization of Love (HarperOne, 2008) first appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list as one of hottest-selling books in America among the “Hard Cover Advice” category. Since then the author has been on an energetic European and American tour to promote his book. In just 200 pages, Anderson writes convincingly to elaborate a treatise to dispel dominant secular ideologies whose ethical frameworks falsely aim at human fulfillment and forming good and just societies. The author is Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, the world’s largest Catholic fraternal society, and CEO of its top-rated life insurance company. Anderson brings to his writing a vast amount of practical experience tactfully combined with the rudiments of Catholic philosophy and theology to elucidate his philosophy of love and goodness. Anderson’s first task is to enlighten his readers on the very meaning of love. He author dedicates his first few chapters to explain that a culture of love is not simply about encouraging romance; and in no way does a culture of love echo the loose liberal ideas behind the hedonistic behavior so vigorously idealized in Western society since the late 1960s. A culture of love is, rather, about self-responsibility, self-denial, hard work, unconditional generosity and steadfast dedication. And yet, there is something more to love, at least in the Christian sense: Anderson’s primary axiom is that a civilization characterized by love is, above all, one which is rooted in the love of God and is ultimately other-directed. To make his point clear, Anderson spins Descartes’ fundamental existential premise “I think therefore I am” to reveal a deeper insight about man and his relationships: “‘I love therefore I am.’ Or perhaps even more profoundly: ‘I have been first loved, therefore I am.’” Anderson goes on to say that “Divine love implies an other…. Love involves (at least) two persons, two selves.” (chap. 3 “Craftsman of a New Humanity”, pp.35, 37). Anderson’s second point is that love is marked by the freedom to act and to give; yet it involves a personal liberty which often challenges our spontaneous preferences and natural inclinations for comfort, company and security. “[Freedom] cannot be lived in isolation, that is, unhinged from other values such as equality and human dignity.” (chap. 1, “The Power of Christ to Transform Culture”, p. 10). Carl Anderson colorfully speaks of Mother Teresa’s little known struggles while experiencing her own “dark night of the soul” in caring for lepers, drug addicts and AIDS victims in the streets of Calcutta.. Certainly not every day, he explains, was Mother Teresa rewarded with the joy of having improved the well-being of India’s most destitute citizens. Many days were, in fact, quite routine and so physically exerting on her body, that it would be very wrong to speak of any “good feelings” that resulted from her unconditional acts of charity. And yet “throughout her ministry she persevered and did not begrudge her work.” (chap. 4 “A Dignity That Brings Demands, p. 61) Anderson believes that promoting human responsibility, based on personal acts self-giving and firmly rooted in imitating God’s law and love for his creatures, is the only way to make a culture a civilized one. The end result – as Anderson hopes – will be that human society bows ever the less to man-made social agendas and their accompanying large impersonal governmental agencies. As he writes: “Social engineering, even if well-intended, cannot in itself create a just society. Just society must arise out of the hearts and minds of those that live in it. If the precepts that Leo [XIII] proposed [in the 1891 social encyclical Rerum Novarum] – which are, after all, specific applications of natural law – were voluntarily obeyed by all people, the need for complicated laws and governments would be greatly reduced.” (chap. 6 “Globalization and the Gospel of Work”, p. 91.) Carl Anderson gives good reasons to not rely on state welfare as a norm to provide loving care for the nation’s poor. He cites the millions of volunteer hours and financial support which Americans still give to private charities, including impressive contributions from his own Knights of Columbus councils. Yet, despite the inspiring statistics, Anderson warns his readers of seeking the opposite solution to welfare provision with the words of Benedict XVI: “If men have nothing more to expect than what the world offers them, and if they may and must demand all this from the state, they destroy their own selves and every human society.” (p. chap. 1 “The Power of Christ to Transform Culture”, p. 10). Lastly, Carl Anderson gives perhaps his best example of how modern society may end up, by recounting the personal experiences of Czech playwright and former president, Vaclav Havel. After undergoing decades of forced social engineering, where the very fundamentals of human love and trust all but vanished from Czech society, Havel confesses: “The worst thing is that we lived in a contaminated environment….We learned not to believe anything, to ignore each other, to care only for ourselves. Concepts such as love, compassion, humility, and forgiveness lost their depths and dimensions. The previous regime…reduced man to a force of production and nature to a tool of production.” (chap 7, Ethics in the Marketplace, p. 109). Carl Anderson’s book brings to light many pressing social issues affecting most modern nations. But unlike many philosophical works, Anderson provides a cause and a solution sustained by real-life examples and their consequences. I would highly recommend reading A Civilization of Love to reinforce many of the same principles promoted by the Acton Institute. Dealing with Rising Gas Prices Tuesday, May 27, 2008By Kevin Schmiesing As the Drudge Report today hails the coming of the fuel-efficient Smart car, it might be worth pointing out other ways in which people are adapting to deal with higher fuel prices. I don’t mean to minimize any of the pain associated with skyrocketing energy costs, whether personal (I feel it, too) or economy-wide, but it is interesting to observe the myriad and often unexpected effects of price changes. It’s the market working. Or, to put it another way, it’s the human mind working to adapt creatively to the challenge of scarce resources. The search for fuel-efficiency has, for example,… …hurt the trucking industry, but given new life to long-suffering railroads. …convinced growing numbers of urbanites to use mass transit. …been a boon for bicycle shops. …hurt many parts of the auto industry, but has also spurred a sharp advance in hybrid auto sales. Memorial Day: John Gillespie Magee Jr. & ‘High Flight’ Friday, May 23, 2008By Ray Nothstine John Gillespie Magee, Jr. is remembered fondly by American aviators who defended and sacrificed for this nation in World War II to the present day. He is remembered for his touching poem High Flight, which he penned in 1941. Magee was born to an American father and British mother in Shanghai, China in 1922. His parents were Christian missionaries in the country. Well educated in China, England, and the United States, Magee received a scholarship to Yale University, where his father was then serving as a chaplain. With the outbreak of World War II, and the British Isles under German threat, Magee postponed college and joined the Royal Canadian Air Force. The United States had not yet entered the war, and hundreds of Americans served as combat aviators with the Canadian Air Force. Magee received his pilot wings in June of 1941. He served in the defense of the British homeland against the Luftwaffe. In August of 1941, Magee was test flying the new Spitfire MK I at high altitude. The inspiration of the flight led him to write High Flight, which came to him in the sky, and he completed the poem on paper soon after landing. He sent a copy to his parents, and his father reprinted it in church publications. Sadly, Magee died just a few months later in a mid-air collision with another airplane in December of 1941. An English farmer said he saw Magee struggle to open the canopy, and was finally able to bail out, but by then he was too low to the ground for his parachute to open. Magee was only 19 years old. The poem would however continue to gain praise as the war continued. The Library of Congress featured the work in an exhibit titled ‘Faith and Freedom’ in 1942, and it was published in the New York Times. Also, several biographies were written about Magee as the popularity of the poem skyrocketed. It is a poem that is loved and cherished by many aviators everywhere, especially those who have defended this nation in the sky. Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy memorize the poem. American pilots shot down and tortured in North Vietnamese prison camps during that war drew inspiration from Magee’s words. Lines from the poem are quoted on the headstones of many military pilots buried at Arlington National Cemetery. It gained still further fame when President Ronald Reagan quoted the first and last lines of the poem in his moving words of tribute to the American astronauts who perished in the Challenger Space Shuttle tragedy in 1986. “The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved good-bye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God,” Reagan said. Dedicated to those who have given their life in defense of the nation, High Flight is printed in its entirety below: High Flight Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings; Sunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth Of sun-split clouds, — and done a hundred things You have not dreamed of — wheeled and soared and swung High in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there, I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung My eager craft through footless halls of air. . . . Up, up the long, delirious burning blue I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace Where never lark, or ever eagle flew — And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trod The high untrespassed sanctity of space, Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.

Description: In 1939, composer Julia Smith's first opera Cynthia Parker dramatized the story of a Texas legend. Smith manipulated music, text, and visual images to make the opera accessible for the audience in accordance with compositional and institutional practices in American opera of the 1930s. Transparent musical themes and common Native Americans stereotypes are used to define characters. Folk music is presented as diegetic, creating a sense of authenticity that places the audience into the opera's Western setting. The opera is codified for the audience using popular idioms, resulting in initial but not lasting success. Anton Bruckner's Treatment of the Credo Text in His Last Three Masses Creator: Lee, Namjai Description: In order to investigate the stylistic transformation that occured before Bruckner abandoned the composition of Masses, this paper analyzes the Credo settings in his last three great Masses, with special attention to the treatment of the text. The relationship between the text and specific musical techniques is also considered. The trends found in these three works, especially in the last setting in F minor, confirm the assumption that Bruckner's Mass composition served as a transition to the composition of his symphonies. The \"Beethoven Folksong Project\" in the Reception of Beethoven and His Music Creator: Lee, Hee Seung Description: Beethoven's folksong arrangements and variations have been coldly received in recent scholarship. Their melodic and harmonic simplicity, fusion of highbrow and lowbrow styles, seemingly diminished emphasis on originality, and the assorted nationalities of the tunes have caused them to be viewed as musical rubble within the heritage of Western art music. The canonic composer's relationship with the Scottish amateur folksong collector and publisher George Thomson, as well as with his audience, amateur music lovers, has been largely downplayed in the reception of Beethoven. I define Beethoven's engagement with folksongs and their audience as the \"Beethoven Folksong Project,\" evaluating it in the history of Beethoven reception as well as within the cultural and ideological contexts of the British Isles and German-speaking lands at the turn of the nineteenth century. I broaden the image of Beethoven during his lifetime by demonstrating that he served as an ideal not only for highly educated listeners and performers but also for amateur music lovers in search of cultivation through music. I explore the repertory under consideration in relation to the idea of Bildung (\"formation\" or \"education\" of the self or of selves as a nation) that pervaded contemporary culture, manifesting itself in music as the ... \"Being\" a Stickist: A Phenomenological Consideration of \"Dwelling\" in a Virtual Music Scene Creator: Hodges, Jeff Description: Musical instruments are not static, unchanging objects. They are, instead, things that materially evolve in symmetry with human practices. Alterations to an instrument's design often attend to its ergonomic or expressive capacity, but sometimes an innovator causes an entirely new instrument to arise. One such instrument is the Chapman Stick. This instrument's history is closely intertwined with global currents that have evolved into virtual, online scenes. Virtuality obfuscates embodiment, but the Stick's world, like any instrument's, is optimally related in intercorporeal exchanges. Stickists circumvent real and virtual obstacles to engage the Stick world. Using an organology informed by the work of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, this study examines how the Chapman Stick, as a material \"thing,\" speaks in and through a virtual, representational environment. Belle Musique and Fin' Amour: Thibaut de Champagne, Gace Brulé, and an Aristocratic Trouvére Tradition Creator: Bly, Emily Description: Many consider Gace Brulé (c1160-c1213) and Thibaut IV, Count of Champagne, (1201-1253) to have been the greatest trouvères. Writers on this subject have not adequately examined this assumption, having focused their energies on such issues as tracking melodic variants of individual works as preserved in different song-books (or chansonniers), the interpretation of rhythm in performance, and creation of modern editions of these songs. This thesis examines the esteem enjoyed by Gace and Thibaut in both medieval and modern times which derives from their exemplarity of, rather than difference from their noble contemporaries. Beyond the Human Voice: Francis Poulenc's Psychological Drama La Voix humaine (1958) Creator: Beard, Cynthia C. Description: Francis Poulenc's one-character opera La Voix humaine (1958), a setting of the homonymous play by Jean Cocteau, explores the psychological complexities of an unnamed woman as she experiences the end of a romantic relationship. During the forty-minute work, she sings in a declamatory manner into a telephone, which serves as a sign of the unrevealed man at the other end. Poulenc uses musical motives to underscore the woman's changing emotional states as she recalls her past relationship. The musical dramaturgy in this work resignifies Debussy's impressionist symbolism by collapsing devices used in Pelléas et Mélisande in a language that shifts between octatonicism, chromaticism, harmonic and melodic whole tone passages, and diatonicism. This late work recontextualizes elements in Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmélites (1953-56), and the end of the opera provides a theme for his Sonate pour Clarinet et Piano(1962), as Poulenc reflects on his youthful encounters with Cocteau, Erik Satie, and Les Six. Beyond the \"Year of Song\": Text and Music in the Song Cycles of Robert Schumann after 1848 Creator: Ringer, Rebecca Scharlene Description: In recent years scholars have begun to re-evaluate the works, writings, and life of Robert Schumann (1810-1856). One of the primary issues in this ongoing re-evaluation is a reassessment of the composer's late works (roughly defined as those written after 1845). Until recently, the last eight years of Schumann's creative life and the works he composed at that time either have been ignored or critiqued under an image of an illness that had caused periodic breakdowns. Schumann's late works show how his culture and the artists communicating within that culture were transformed from the beginning to the middle of the nineteenth century. These late works, therefore, should be viewed in the context of Schumann's output as a whole and in regard to their contributions to nineteenth-century society. Schumann's contributions, specifically to the genre of the song cycle from 1849 to 1852, are among his late compositional works that still await full reconsideration. A topical study, focusing on three themes of selections from his twenty-three late cycles, will provide a critical evaluation of Schumann's compositional output in the genre of the song cycle. First, Schumann's political voice will be examined. The political events that led to the mid-nineteenth-century revolutions inspired crucial ... Busoni's Doktor Faust Creator: Harrison, Charles Scott Description: It is the intent of this thesis to shed a new investigative light upon a musician whose importance as a creative personality and aesthetician has been sorely underestimated or at least unappreciated by fellow musicians and audiences of his own and succeeding generations, a musician who formulated a new musical aesthetic which involved the utilization of compositional techniques diametrically opposed to those which had held dominant influence over the musical world for more than half a century, a musician who attempted to fuse the Italian sense of form and clarity with Teutonic profundity, complexity, and symbolism. This musician was Ferruccio Busoni. This thesis will concentrate on the history of the Faust legend and Busoni's final work, his opera Doktor Faust (c. 1924), the creative problems opera imposed upon Busoni, and his attempt to solve them vis-a-vis his own personal aesthetic. Cadential Syntax and Mode in the Sixteenth-Century Motet: a Theory of Compositional Process and Structure from Gallus Dressler's Praecepta Musicae Poeticae Creator: Hamrick, David (David Russell) Description: Though cadences have long been recognized as an aspect of modality, Gallus Dressler's treatise Praecepta musicae poeticae (1563) offers a new understanding of their relationship to mode and structure. Dressler's comments suggest that the cadences in the exordium and at articulations of the text are \"principal\" to the mode, shaping the tonal structure of the work. First, it is necessary to determine which cadences indicate which modes. A survey of sixteenth-century theorists uncovered a striking difference between Pietro Aron and his followers and many lesser-known theorists, including Dressier. The latter held that the repercussae of each mode were \"principal cadences,\" contrary to Aron's expansive lists. Dressler's syntactical theory of cadence usage was tested by examining seventeen motets by Dressler and seventy-two motets by various early sixteenth-century composers. In approximately three-fourths of the motets in each group, cadences appeared on only two different pitches (with only infrequent exceptions) in their exordia and at text articulations. These pairs are the principal cadences of Dressler's list, and identify the mode of the motets. Observations and conclusions are offered regarding the ambiguities of individual modes, and the cadence-tone usage of individual composers. Carlo Milanuzzi's Quarto Scherzo and the Climate of Venetian Popular Music in the 1620s Creator: Gavito, Cory Michael Description: Although music publishing in Italy was on the decline around the turn of the seventeenth century, Venice emerged as one of the most prolific publishing centers of secular song in Italy throughout the first three decades of the 1600s. Many Venetian song collections were printed with alfabeto, a chordal tablature designed to facilitate even the most untrained of musicians with the necessary tools for accompanying singers on the fashionable five-course Spanish guitar. Carlo Milanuzzi's Quarto Scherzo (1624) stands out among its contemporary Venetian song collections with alfabeto as an anthology of Venetian secular songs, including compositions by Miniscalchi, Berti, and Claudio and Francesco Monteverdi. Issues surrounding its publication, instrumentation, and musical and poetic style not only contribute to the understanding of Venetian Baroque monody, but also help to construe a repertory of vocal music with defining characteristics usually associated with popular music of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. Caught Between Jazz and Pop: The Contested Origins, Criticism, Performance Practice, and Reception of Smooth Jazz. Creator: West, Aaron J. Description: In Caught Between Jazz and Pop, I challenge the prevalent marginalization and malignment of smooth jazz in the standard jazz narrative. Furthermore, I question the assumption that smooth jazz is an unfortunate and unwelcomed evolutionary outcome of the jazz-fusion era. Instead, I argue that smooth jazz is a long-lived musical style that merits multi-disciplinary analyses of its origins, critical dialogues, performance practice, and reception. Chapter 1 begins with an examination of current misconceptions about the origins of smooth jazz. In many jazz histories, the origins of smooth jazz are defined as a product of the jazz-fusion era. I suggest that smooth jazz is a distinct jazz style that is not a direct outgrowth of any mainstream jazz style, but a hybrid of various popular and jazz styles. Chapters 2 through 4 contain eight case studies examining the performers of crossover jazz and smooth jazz. These performers have conceived and maintained distinct communicative connections between themselves and their audiences. In the following chapter, the unfair treatment of popular jazz styles is examined. Many early and influential jazz critics sought to elevate jazz to the status of art music by discrediting popular jazz styles. These critics used specific criteria and emphasized notions ... The Christmas Cantatas of Christoph Graupner (1683-1760) Creator: Schmidt, René R. Description: An assessment of the contributions of Christoph Graupner's 1,418 extant church cantatas is enhanced by a study of his fifty-five surviving Christmas cantatas, written for the feasts of Christmas, St. Stephen's, St. John's, and the Sunday after Christmas. Graupner's training in Kirchberg, Reichenbach and at the Thomas School in Leipzig is recounted as well as his subsequent tenures in Hamburg and Darmstadt. A Comparison of the Use of Music in the Holy Eucharist of the Roman Catholic Church and the Sabbath Morning Service of the Jewish Synagogue in the Middle Ages Creator: Simmons, Sandra K. (Sandra Kay) Description: The problem with which this investigation is concerned is that of comparing the medieval musical traditions of two of the world's most influential religions. The similarities are discussed in two major categories: the comparison of liturgical texts and ritual, and the comparison of the music appearing in each ritual. This study has one main purpose. That purpose is to demonstrate how, through musical traditions, each religion has developed through the influence of the other. Samples of the liturgies from the musical portions of the services were obtained from prayer books and references dealing with those religions. Investigations of English translations from the Latin and Hebrew revealed a close identity between the two, not only in scriptural uses, but also in prayers and responses. Musical examples demonstrating similar elements in Hebrew and Christian worship were found in the extensive research of A. Z. Idelsohn and Eric Werner. Due to the dispersal of world Jewry, the best examples of Hebrew medieval music were obtained from the most isolated Jewish communities, such as those of Yemen, Musical similarities included modes, melodic formulas, and hymns and songs. This report concludes that the musical portions of the services of Christianity and Judaism in the Middle ... Composing Symbolism's Musicality of Language in fin-de-siècle France Creator: Varvir Coe, Megan E Description: In this dissertation, I explore the musical prosody of the literary symbolists and the influence of this prosody on fin-de-siècle French music. Contrary to previous categorizations of music as symbolist based on a characteristic \"sound,\" I argue that symbolist aesthetics demonstrably influenced musical construction and reception. My scholarship reveals that symbolist musical works across genres share an approach to composition rooted in the symbolist concept of musicality of language, a concept that shapes this music on sonic, structural, and conceptual levels. I investigate the musical responses of four different composers to a single symbolist text, Oscar Wilde's one-act play Salomé, written in French in 1891, as case studies in order to elucidate how a symbolist musicality of language informed their creation, performance, and critical reception. The musical works evaluated as case studies are Antoine Mariotte's Salomé, Richard Strauss's Salomé, Aleksandr Glazunov's Introduction et La Danse de Salomée, and Florent Schmitt's La Tragédie de Salomé. Recognition of symbolist influence on composition, and, in the case of works for the stage, on production and performance expands the repertory of music we can view critically through the lens of symbolism, developing not only our understanding of music's role in this difficult and often ... Criticism of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony in London and Boston, 1819-1874: A Forum for Public Discussion of Musical Topics Creator: Cooper, Amy Nicole Description: Critics who discuss Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony often write about aspects that run counter to their conception of what a symphony should be, such as this symphony’s static nature and its programmatic elements. In nineteenth-century Boston and London, criticism of the Pastoral Symphony reflects the opinions of a wide range of listeners, as critics variably adopted the views of the intellectual elite and general audience members. As a group, these critics acted as intermediaries between various realms of opinion regarding this piece. Their writing serves as a lens through which we can observe audiences’ acceptance of ideas common in contemporaneous musical thought, including the integrity of the artwork, the glorification of genius, and ideas about meaning in music. Don Gillis's Symphony No 5½: Music for the People Creator: Morrison, Sean Description: Don Gillis wrote Symphony No. 5½ (1947) in order to reconcile the American public with modern art music. By synthesizing jazz (as well as other American folk idioms), singable melodies, and humor, and then couching them into symphonic language, Gillis produced a work that lay listeners could process and enjoy. The piece was an immediate success and was played by orchestras across the globe, but it did not retain this popularity and it eventually faded from relevancy. This study focuses on elements that contributed to the initial efficacy and ultimate decline of the work. Due to its pervasive popular influences, Symphony No. 5½ is a crystallized representation of time in which it was written, and it soon became dated. Don Gillis did not harbor the idea that Symphony No. 5½ would grant him great wealth or musical immortality; he had a more pragmatic goal in mind. He used every musical element at his disposal to write a symphonic work that would communicate directly with the American people via a musical language they would understand. He was successful in this regard, but the dialogue ended soon after mid-century. Dramatic Expression in Thirty Musical Settings of Goethe's \"Der Erlkonig\" Creator: McDaniel, Mary Eileen Description: This study is an investigation of the dramatic expression in thirty musical settings of Goethe's \"Erlkonig,\" to attempt to determine why the works by Franz Schubert and Carl Loewe have achieved such popularity. An Edition of Verse and Solo Anthems by William Boyce Creator: Fansler, Terry L. Description: The English musician William Boyce was known as an organist for the cathedral as well as the Chapel Royal, a composer of both secular and sacred music, a director of large choral festivals, and the editor of Cathedral Music, the finest eighteenth-century edition of English Church music. Among Boyce's compositions for the church are many examples of verse and solo anthems. Part II of this thesis consists of an edition of one verse and three solo anthems selected from British Museum manuscript Additional 40497, transcribed into modern notation, and provided with a realization for organ continuo. Material prefatory to the edition itself, including a biography, a history of the verse and solo anthem from the English Reformation to the middle of the eighteenth century, a discussion .of the characteristics of Boyce's verse and solo anthems, and editorial notes constitute Part I. Educating American Audiences: Claire Reis and the Development of Modern Music Institutions, 1912-1930 Creator: Freeman, Cole Description: The creation of institutions devoted to promoting and supporting modern music in the United States during the 1920s made it possible for American composers to develop an identity distinct from that of European modernists. These institutions were thus a critical part of the process of modernization that began in the United States during the early decades of the twentieth century. There is substantial scholarship on these musical institutions of modern music, such as the International Composers’ Guild and the League of Composers; but little to no work has been done on the progressive musical institutions of the 1910s, such as the Music League of the People’s Music Institute of New York, which was founded by Claire Reis. This thesis addresses the questions of how and why American musical modernism came to be as it was in the 1920s through an examination of the various stages of Reis’s career. The first chapter is an extensive study of primary source material gathered from the League of Composers/ISCM Records collection at the New York Public Library, which relates to Reis’s work with the PML in the 1910s. The second chapter uses the conclusions of the first chapter to shine new light on an ... Eighteenth-Century French Oboes: A Comparative Study Creator: Cleveland, Susannah Description: The oboe, which first came into being in the middle of the seventeenth century in France, underwent a number of changes throughout the following century. French instruments were influenced both by local practices and by the introduction of influences from other parts of Europe. The background of the makers of these instruments as well as the physical properties of the oboes help to illuminate the development of the instrument during this period. The examination of measurements, technical drawings, photographs, and biographical data clarify the development and dissemination of practices in oboe building throughout eighteenth-century France. This clarification provides new insight into a critical period of oboe development which has hitherto not been exclusively addressed. Elements of Shamanic Mythology in E. T. A. Hoffman's Romantic Conception of Music Creator: Miller, Harry A. W. (Harry Alfred Werner) Description: The musicians in E. T. A. Hoffmann's tales and essays demonstrate traits remarkably similar to those of shamans. Hoffmann uses the same imagery to describe the journey of the composer into the \"realm of dreams,\" where he receives inspiration, as the shaman uses to describe the spirit world to which he journeys via music. Hoffmann was a major force in changing the 18th-century view of music as an \"innocent luxury\" to the 19th-century idea of music as a higher art. As a German Romantic,author, he subscribed to the idea championed by the Schlegels that true poetry is based on myth. In this thesis, Hoffmann's writings are compared with shamanic mythology to demonstrate a similarity beyond mere coincidence, without drawing conclusions about influence. English Devotional Song of the Seventeenth Century in Printed Collections from 1638 to 1693: A Study of Music and Culture Creator: Treacy, Susan Description: Seventeenth-century England witnessed profound historical, theological, and musical changes. A king was overthrown and executed; religion was practiced fervently and disputed hotly; and English musicians fell under the influence of the Italian stile nuovo. Many devotional songs were printed, among them those which reveal influences of this style. These English-texted sacred songs for one to three solo voices with continuo--not based upon a previously- composed hymn or psalm tune—are emphasized in this dissertation. Chapter One treats definitions, past neglect of the genre by scholars, and the problem of ambiguous terminology. Chapter Two is an examination of how religion and politics affected musical life, the hiatus from liturgical music from 1644 to 1660 causing composers to contribute to the flourishing of devotional music for home worship and recreation. Different modes of seventeenth-century devotional life are discussed in Chapter Three. Chapter Four provides documentation for use of devotional music, diaries and memoirs of the period revealing the use of several publications considered in this study. Baroque musical aesthetics applied to devotional song and its raising of the affections towards God are discussed in Chapter Five. Chapter Six traces the influence of Italian monody and sacred concerto on English devotional song. The earliest ... he Essercizii musici: A Study of the Late Baroque Sonata Creator: Volcansek, Frederick Wallace Description: Telemann's Essercizii musici is a seminal publication of the 1730's representative of the state of the sonata in Germany at that time. Telemann's music has been largely viewed in negative terms, presumably because of its lack of originality, with the result that the collection's content has been treated in a perfunctory manner. This thesis presents a reappraisal of the Essercizii musici based on criteria presented in Quantz's Versuch. A major source of the period, the Versuch provides an analytical framework for a deeper understanding of the sonatas that comprise Telemann's last publication. A comparison of contemporary publications of similarly titled collections establishes an historical framework for assessing the importance of the Essercizii musici as part of a tradition of publications with didactic objectives that may be traced to the late 17th century. Expanded Perceptions of Identity in Benjamin Britten's Nocturne, Op. 60 Creator: Perkins, Anna Grace Description: A concentrated reading of Benjamin Britten's Nocturne through details of the composer's biography can lead to new perspectives on the composer's identity. The method employed broadens current understandings of Britten's personality and its relationship to the music. After creating a context for this kind of work within Britten scholarship, each chapter explores a specific aspect of Britten's identity through the individual songs of the Nocturne. Chapter 2 focuses on how Britten used genres in a pastoral style to create his own British identity. Chapter 3 concentrates on the complex relationship between Britten's homosexuality and his pacifism. Chapter 4 aims to achieve a deeper understanding of Britten's idealization of innocence. The various aspects of Britten's personality are related to one another in the Conclusion.\n\n教育\n\n2016-50/2785/en_head.json.gz/4746\n\nLarousse Gastronomique by Jinmyo Thu Aug 10 2000 at 16:08:51 The first edition of Larousse Gastronomique was published in 1938. A monumental encyclopaedia of culinary information compiled by Prosper Montagné, it is a never-ending source of inspiration to those who regard cooking and the preparation of food as something more than a necessity. It details the origins of a vast number of foods and wines, provides thousands of recipes, definitions of culinary terms, cooking methods, stories, and some etymology. If you like food or cooking, you will find Larousse Gastronomique fascinating reading. My rather tattered copy contains 1098 pages in small biblical print. Georges Auguste Escoffier wrote the preface to Larousse Gastronomique after reading the first draft, though he died three years before the book was finally published. Escoffier is often referred to as the “king of cooks and the cook of kings”. I like it! by avjewe Tue Sep 17 2002 at 18:08:45 The World Authority The Encyclopedia of Food, Wine and Cookery Prosper Montagné introduction by A. Escoffier and Ph. Gilbert Charlotte Turgeon and Nina Froud 1000 Illustrations Including many in full color Copyright 1961 by Crown Publishers Inc. Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number: 61-15788 from the book jacket : This is the internationally famous bible of cooking, the encyclopedia-cookbook which, because of its 8,500 recipes and the full information it gives on all culinary matters, has been accepted as the world authority. Ask any chef, ask any cooking expert. You will find a copy of Larousse Gastronomique in the kitchen of any superior restaurant anywhere in the world. It is a prized possession of every gourmet who knows French. But until now it has been available only in the French language. Because of the complexities of variations in terms and measurements, it has never before been translated into English. Now, after three years of intensive work by a staff of twenty experts headed by two famous editors, it has been converted for American usage. Larousse Gastronomique contains in its 1,100 large pages 8,500 recipes from all over the world and 1,000 illustrations, many in full color. Also, there are descriptions of cooking processes; full details about all foods, their nature and quality, and how to cure, treat, and preserve them; the history of food and cooking; articles on table service, banquets, food values, and diet -- in fact, just about every topic of culinary interest is covered. Though Larousse Gastronomique is the prime reference book of chefs, gourmets, and experts, it is equally useful and convenient for the home cook. All recipes except for banquet specialties are on a small-group basis, stated in simple terms for convenience in the home For this American edition, all entries have been brought up to date, notably in the articles on the preservation of food. Entries are in alphabetical order and are fully cross-referenced under both English and French names. The illustrations in color, black-and-white photographs, and line drawings, many of which were made expressly for the American edition, show not only the appearance of the cooked dish but in many cases the intermediate steps of preparation as well. In Larousse Gastronomique you will find clear information on almost any culinary subject, an excellent recipe for almost any dish you may want. All in all, it is a champion book, the number-one cookery book for anyone who cares about good food and the fine art of preparing it. Crown Publishers, Inc. New York 16, N.Y. printed in the U.S.A. Tragically, the copyright on this work was indeed renewed in 1989 (28 years after the original copyright), and therefore it won't be out of copyright until the year 2056 (95 years after the original copyright). Every entry cries out to be noded, but it cries in vain. Entries noded under fair use : others as I fail to resist This book was on the shelf in the house where I grew up. I remember it clearly, because it has a distinctive spine; however, I do not remember it ever being opened. The copy I own is a different one, which I bought used in 1992 or thereabouts. It has a sticker inside the front cover saying ex libris Joseph P. Kaczorowski : Joe, whoever you are, I've got your book. I've always wanted a copy of the mythical Gastronomicon. This is as close as I'm likely to get. by elaine Wed Sep 18 2002 at 4:02:45 I'm pleased to say that the 1988 English translation of 1985 French Larousse has no mention of cat as a comestible. It is a wonderful and exhaustively complete reference to (cat free) cooking. The recipes are not recorded in instructive detail, as such it is not the place to learn the fundamental or advanced techniques of cooking. (Consider Mastering the Art of French Cooking volumes I and II by Julia Child. Again, there is no mention of cat or chat. Cast iron is followed by catalane, chasseur by chateau. No cat.

In the past, I've really not liked these titles - too expensive for the extremely limited amount of text, uninspired photographs, etc. but they're offering new titles and what looks like a makeover of the covers, so I thought I'd give it another chance. This title keeps the same oversized rectangle layout, but has a more colorful, attractive cover. There is a note to parents and teachers that this supports various curriculum standards and a table of contents before the book begins. The first chunk of text introduces the reader to rabbits and explains that this book will examine their different body parts. Each spread features a different part of the rabbit with a caption and an average of 3 sentences on the left, in a bold, large font. On the right is a large color photograph, which is spread across the gutter and bordered with a blue and white design. The subjects include ears, eyes, nose, teeth, whiskers, feet, fur, and tails. Tails doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the pages, since all the other ones focus on how the body part helps the rabbit survive and thrive and tails just says \"Short, round, and fluffy, bunnies' tails never get in their way.\" The back matter includes a short glossary, 3 titles for further reading (one of which must be an error because it's about cats) and a link to Capstone's curated websites, FactHound. There is also a short index. Verdict: Still not impressed. I don't like the way the photographs are split across the gutter. I like the new ABDO titles better - they seem aimed at a more picture book audience while these are still being pushed as easy readers although the layout is all wrong for that age group. Easy readers should be vertical rectangles, everyone knows that! I can see that these would be useful in a curriculum context, but I can't justify the cost of these and the paperbacks are too flimsy. If it's a subject I really need and these are the only option I'll go with them, but there are plenty of better books about pets.

While UDHR is cause for celebration, the speeches at this event offered a critical eye, demanding a collective voice for Notre Dame’s workers. Last May, a need for this voice became obvious when three building service workers presented a petition to Staff Advisory Council, signed by 216 workers around campus, and were told that they needed 2000 for the petition to mean anything. The subject of the petition was a vacation policy, changed several years ago without meaningful consultation with the workers whom it affects. The petition called for a new policy that would make it easier for workers to plan their vacations: a simple request, rejected flatly. No existing body on campus represents the concerns of workers. How, then, can labor rights be achieved? UDHR offers some guidance in Article 23(4): “Everyone has the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests.” Catholic Social Tradition unambiguously supports trade unions. For example, Pope John Paul II, in Laborem Exercens (20), calls trade unions an “indispensable elements of social life”. In the past, Notre Dame has claimed to uphold this right, while arguing that unions are unnecessary. On April 20, 2006, John Affleck-Graves, the Executive Vice President, said, “there is nothing a union can accomplish for them that cannot be accomplished through an open and honest relationship such as has traditionally prevailed between the University and its employees.” The vacation policy issue demonstrates that this relationship is neither open nor honest. The University’s handling of this issue is emblematic of its suppression of a movement that has been fighting, issue by issue, for over three years now, to address working conditions. Unions are necessary at Notre Dame to realize these goals: to provide all its workers with just wages, fair treatment, and most importantly, a collective voice.
