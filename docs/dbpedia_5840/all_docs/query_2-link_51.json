        "text": "Abstract\n\nHomologous chromosomes pair with each other during meiosis, culminating in the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC), which is coupled with meiotic recombination. In this study, we showed that a meiosis-specific depletion mutant of a cullin (Cdc53) of the SCF (Skp-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase, which plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation during mitosis, is deficient in SC formation, but is proficient in the formation of crossovers, indicating uncoupling of meiotic recombination with SC formation in the mutant. Furthermore, the deletion of the PCH2 gene encoding a meiosis-specific AAA+ ATPase suppresses SC-assembly defect induced by CDC53 depletion. On the other hand, the pch2 cdc53 double mutant is defective in meiotic crossover formation, suggesting the SC assembly with unrepaired DSBs. A temperature-sensitive mutant of the CDC4, which encodes a F-box protein of the SCF, shows similar meiotic defects to the CDC53 depletion mutant. These suggest that SCFCdc4, probably SCFCdc4-dependnet protein ubiquitylation, regulates and collaborates with Pch2 in SC assembly and meiotic recombination.\n\nSummary During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair with each other and form the synaptonemal complex (SC). In this study, components of the SCF (Skp-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase, Cdc53 and Cdc4, are required for SC formation. A meiosis-specific AAA+ ATPase Pch2 antagonize the functions of Cdc53 and Cdc4 for proper SC assembly.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMeiosis is a specialized cell division, which generates haploid gametes (Marston and Amon, 2004; Petronczki et al., 2003). Upon the entry into meiosis, cells undergo DNA replication followed by two rounds of nuclear division. During meiosis I homologous chromosomes segregate to opposite poles. Crossovers (COs), reciprocal exchanges between homologous chromosomes, are essential for segregation of the chromosomes during meiosis I by providing physical linkages between the chromosomes (Gray and Cohen, 2016; Hunter, 2015).\n\nMeiotic prophase-I exhibits drastic chromosome dynamics and morphogenesis. Homologous loci on two parental chromosomes pair with each other during the prophase-I (Kleckner, 2006; Zickler and Kleckner, 1999). Pairing culminates as synapsis of the homologous chromosomes, manifested by the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a meiosis-specific chromosome structure (Kleckner, 2006; Zickler and Kleckner, 1999). SC contains the central region with polymerized transverse filaments, which is flanked by two homologous chromosomal axes with multiple chromatin loops referred to as a lateral element (LE) (Cahoon and Hawley, 2016; Gao and Colaiacovo, 2018). SC assembly and disassembly are tightly regulated. In leptotene stage, a pair of sister chromatids is folded into a chromosome axis with chromatin loops, called an axial elements (AE). Leptonema is followed by zygonema, in which a short patch of SC is formed between homologous AEs. SC elongation occurs along chromosomes, resulting in the formation of full-length SCs in pachynema, where AEs are referred as to LEs. In some organisms, AE elongation is coupled with SC formation. In other organisms, LE/AE formation proceeds to SC formation. SCs are then disassembled in diplonema, prior to the onset of anaphase-I. Importantly, SC formation is tightly coupled with meiotic recombination in most of organisms including budding yeast and mammals. Mutants defective in meiotic recombination show a defect in SC formation; e.g. the spo11 and dmc1 mutant (Baudat et al., 2000; Bishop et al., 1992; Giroux et al., 1989; Romanienko and Camerini-Otero, 2000), which are deficient in the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and strand exchange between homologous DNAs, respectively. On the other hand, in fruit fly and nematode, SC formation is independent of the initiation of meiotic recombination (Dernburg et al., 1998; McKim and Hayashi-Hagihara, 1998).\n\nSynapsis of homologous chromosomes, thus SC formation, initiates at a specific site along chromosomes, which likely corresponds to the site of meiotic recombination. In budding yeast, evolutionally-conserved ZMM (Zip, Msh, Mer)/SIC (Synaptic Initiation Complex) proteins including Zip1, Zip2, Zip3, Msh4, Msh5, Mer3, Spo16, Spo22/Zip4 and Pph3 (Agarwal and Roeder, 2000; Borner et al., 2004; Chua and Roeder, 1998; Hochwagen et al., 2005; Hollingsworth et al., 1995; Nakagawa and Ogawa, 1999; Shinohara et al., 2008; Tsubouchi et al., 2006) promote SC assembly as well as CO formation. ZMMs localize to chromosomes as a large protein ensemble, which is detected by immuno-staining as a focus, for SC assembly through the deposition of Zip1, a yeast transverse filament protein, into arrays in the SC central region (Sym et al., 1993; Sym and Roeder, 1995). Zip1 polymerization is promoted by the action of a complex containing Ecm11 and Gmc2 as a component of the SC central region (Humphryes et al., 2013; Voelkel-Meiman et al., 2013). AEs/LEs contain several meiosis-specific proteins including Red1, Hop1, and Mek1/Mre4 kinase {Hollingsworth, 1990 #81;Leem, 1992 #190;Rockmill, 1988 #23;Rockmill, 1991 #189} as well as a cohesin complex containing a meiosis-specific kleisin Rec8 (Klein et al., 1999). Rec8, Hop1, and Red1 are axis components evolutionally conserved among species and are found as REC8, HORMAD1/2 and SYCP2/3 in mammals, respectively (Eijpe et al., 2003; West et al., 2019; Wojtasz et al., 2009). How AEs or meiotic chromosome axes, which may be independent of SC elongation, are assembled remains largely unknown.\n\nProtein modifications such as ubiquitin and small ubiquitin-like modifier protein (SUMO) regulate various biological processes during both mitosis and meiosis. SUMOlyation is involved in SC formation (Nottke et al., 2017). SUMO is localized to the SC, both the SC central region and the axes, in budding yeast (Cheng et al., 2006; Hooker and Roeder, 2006; Voelkel-Meiman et al., 2013) and both SUMO and ubiquitin are present on the axes and SC central region in mouse spermatocytes (Rao et al., 2017). Budding yeast Ecm11 present in SC central region is SUMOlyated (Humphryes et al., 2013; Voelkel-Meiman et al., 2013)and amounts of SUMOlyated Ecm11 correlates with SC elongation (Leung et al., 2015). In mouse, a SUMO ligase Rnf212 and a ubiquitin ligase Hei10 antagonize with each other for meiotic recombination (Qiao et al., 2014). Moreover, the proteasome is localized on SCs in budding yeast, nematode, and mouse (Ahuja et al., 2017; Rao et al., 2017), suggesting the role of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in meiotic chromosome metabolisms.\n\nTwo major ubiquitin ligases, the SCF (Skp-Cullin-F-box) and APC/C (Anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome) play an essential role in mitotic cell cycle (Feldman et al., 1997; Skowyra et al., 1997; Yu et al., 1998; Zachariae et al., 1998). In budding yeast meiosis, APC/C with either Cdc20 or Cdh1 promotes the timely transition of metaphase/anaphase I and II (Cooper and Strich, 2011; Pesin and Orr-Weaver, 2008). A meiosis-specific APC/C activator, Ama1, regulates the duration of prophase-I (Okaz et al., 2012), which is negatively controlled by an APC/C subunit, Mnd2 (Oelschlaegel et al., 2005; Penkner et al., 2005).\n\nIn budding yeast, a core SCF, which is composed of Rbx1/Hrt1 (RING finger protein), Cdc53 (cullin) and Skp1, binds various F-box adaptor proteins including Cdc4, Grr1, and Met30 (Nakatsukasa et al., 2015; Willems et al., 2004). These F-box proteins determine the substrate-specificity of the complex. SCF with Cdc4, referred to as SCFCdc4, mediates ubiquitylation of G1 cyclin(s) and a Cdk inhibitor, Sic1, at G1/S transition (Koivomagi et al., 2011). The SCF also ubiquitylates Cdc6 essential for the initiation of DNA replication (Perkins et al., 2001). On the other hand, the role of the SCF during prophase-I remains less described. A previous report indicates the role of SCFCdc4 in pre-meiotic DNA replication through Sic1 degradation (Sedgwick et al., 2006).\n\nIn this study, we analyzed roles of the SCF ubiquitin ligase in yeast meiosis by characterizing a meiosis-specific depletion mutant of Cdc53 and found that the Cdc53 is indispensable for SC formation and progression into anaphase I. Moreover, a mutant of the PCH2 gene, which encodes a meiosis-specific AAA+ ATPase (Borner et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2014; San-Segundo and Roeder, 1999) suppresses SC-assembly defect by Cdc53 depletion. A temperature-sensitive cdc4 mutant also showed similar meiotic defects to the CDC53 depletion. We propose that SCFCdc4 regulates proper SC assembly by counteracting with the Pch2-dependent negative control on SC assembly.\n\nResults\n\nDepletion of Cdc53 induces an arrest at meiosis I\n\nThe SCF complex plays a critical role in cell cycle control of mitosis (Willems et al., 2004). However, its role in meiosis is largely unknown, since genes encoding core components of the complex (e.g. Rbx1, Cdc53, Skp1) (Willems et al., 1999; Willems et al., 2004) are essential for vegetative growth of budding yeast, S. cerevisiae. To know a meiotic role of the SCF complex in budding yeast, we constructed a strain that depletes an SCF component specifically during meiosis by replacing the promoter of a target gene with the CLB2 promoter, whose activity is down-regulated during meiosis (Lee and Amon, 2003). In a strain with the pCLB2-HA-CDC53, hereafter, CDC53mn (meiotic null), we could efficiently reduce a cullin component of the SCF, Cdc53 (Fig. 1 A), whose steady state level did not change much during meiosis (Fig. S1 A). In the CDC53mn mutant, the level of Cdc53 began to decrease from 2-h induction of meiosis and little Cdc53 protein was detectable after 4 h. We checked amounts of two known SCFCdc4 substrates, Sic1 and Cdc6. In wild-type cells, the level of Sic1 decreases at 0-2 h incubation with sporulation medium (SPM) (Fig. S1 D), as shown previously (Sedgwick et al., 2006). In the CDC53mn mutant, Sic1 was still present at 4 h of meiosis, but disappears at 6 h, suggesting the delay in its degradation. On the other hand, Cdc6, that is very unstable after 4 h in the wild-type meiosis (Perkins et al., 2001), was present at late time points such as 12 h in the mutant (Fig. S1 D). These results indicate that, in the CDC53mn mutant, SCF activity is retained in very early meiotic prophase-I, which is enough for triggering premeiotic S phase, but is largely decreased during further incubation.\n\nAlthough the CDC53mn mutant shows normal growth during mitosis, the mutant shows various defects during meiosis. The CDC53mn mutant cells delayed the onset of meiotic DNA replication by ~2 h compared to the wild-type cells (Fig. S1 B). The delayed Sic1 degradation (Fig. S1 D) might explain the delay in the onset of S-phase in the mutant. DAPI staining showed that Cdc53-depleted cells arrested prior to meiosis I (Fig. 1 B). Aberrant recombination intermediates are known to trigger an arrest at mid-pachytene stage; e.g., dmc1 mutant (Bishop et al., 1992). However, the arrest in the CDC53mn mutant is independent of the recombination. Since the introduction of the spo11-Y135F mutation, which abolishes the formation of meiotic DSBs (Bergerat et al., 1997), did not suppress the arrest induced by CDC53 depletion (Fig. S1 C). We also checked the expression of Cdc5 (Polo-like kinase), which is induced after pachytene exit (Chu and Herskowitz, 1998; Clyne et al., 2003). CDC53mn cells expressed Cdc5 from 8 h, 2 h later than the wild type and maintained its expression at late times such as 12 h (Fig. S1 D), showing that the mutant exits the pachytene stage. High levels of Cdc5, whose degradation triggers the exit of meiosis-I, in the mutant support that the mutant does not carry out meiosis I division. Tubulin staining revealed that the mutant delayed the entry into metaphase-I with short spindles (Fig. 1 C). Even at 12 h, only half of the mutant cells contained short metaphase-I or anaphase-I spindles (Fig. 1 D), indicating an arrest at late prophase-I such as metaphase/anaphase-I transition in the CDC53mn mutant. These indicate that Cdc53, probably the SCF, plays an essential role in the transition of metaphase-I to anaphase-I, suggesting the presence of a novel regulatory mechanism on the transition. The arrest induced by CDC53 depletion is similar to that seen in meiosis-specific depletion of the CDC20, which encodes an activator or APC/C for the onset of anaphase-I (Lee and Amon, 2003). The SCF may regulate APC/C activity during meiosis I as seen in Xenopus oocytes (Nishiyama et al., 2007).\n\nCDC53 depletion results in defective SC assembly\n\nWe examined the effect of Cdc53-depletion on meiotic prophase-I events such as SC formation by immuno-staining of chromosome spreads. Zip1, a component in SC central region, is widely used as a marker for SC formation (Sym et al., 1993). As a marker for meiotic DSB repair, we co-stained Rad51, a RecA-like recombinase (Bishop, 1994; Shinohara et al., 1992) with Zip1. In wild type, Zip1 first appears as several foci on chromosomes in early meiosis such as leptotene stage (Fig. 1 E i). Then, short lines and later long lines of Zip1 are observed, which correspond with zygotene (Fig. 1 E ii) and pachytene stages (Fig. 1 E iii), respectively. The CDC53mn mutant is defective in SC assembly (Fig. 1 E and F). At early time points (e.g., 2-4 h) in the mutant, dotty-staining of Zip1 appeared without any delay compared to wild type. This indicates normal association of Zip1 to chromosomes at early meiosis I. The formation of short lines of Zip1 in the mutant delayed by ~2-3 h compared to that in wild type (Fig. 1 E and F). Even at late time points (6 h), the mutant largely reduced the formation of fully-elongated Zip1-lines (Fig. 1 F), indicating a defect in Zip1 elongation. Indeed, the mutant transiently accumulated an aggregate of Zip1, called “poly-complex (PC)”, which is an indicative for abnormal SC assembly (Sym et al., 1993) (Fig. 1 E and G). Although the mutant transiently accumulated these zygonema-like nuclei with short lines and PCs of Zip1, these Zip1 structures almost dismantled at late times such as 10-12 h in the mutant (Fig. 1 F). The disappearance of Zip1-positive cells is delayed by ~4 h in the mutant relative to wild type, indicating ~2 h longer prophase-I in the CDC53mn mutant relative to that in wild type.\n\nCDC53 depletion shows little defect in meiotic recombination\n\nDuring meiotic prophase-I, SC formation is tightly coupled with meiotic recombination (Alani et al., 1990; Bishop et al., 1992; Padmore et al., 1991). Rad51 staining showed that the CDC53mn mutant cells delayed the appearance of Rad51 foci on the chromosomes relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 1 E and H), probably due to delayed entry into meiosis (Fig. S1 B). However, kinetics of Rad51-focus staining look similar to those in the wild type, with a delayed peak at 6 h (Fig. 1 H), suggesting a weak defect in DSB repair in the mutant.\n\nTo analyze meiotic recombination in the CDC53-depletion mutant, we analyzed the repair of meiotic DSBs and formation of crossovers (COs) at a well-characterized recombination hotspot, the HIS4-LEU2 (Cao et al., 1990) by Southern blotting (Fig. 2 A). In wild type, DSBs appeared at ~3 h, peaked at 4 h and then disappeared after 5 h (Fig. 2 B and C). Consistent with the delay in the onset of meiotic S-phase, the CDC53mn mutant delayed DSB appearance by ~2 h relative to wild type. When the delay in the S-phase entry is compensated, kinetics of the appearance of meiotic DSBs in the mutant are similar to those in wild type. On the other hand, there is substantial delay (about one hour) in the disappearance of DSBs in the mutant, indicating a weak defect in meiotic DSB repair. These suggest that the CDC53mn mutant is almost proficient in the repair of meiotic DSBs. Indeed, the mutant is proficient in CO formation at this locus. In wild type, COs started to form at 5 h and reached to a maximum level of ~7.5% at 8 h (Fig. 2 D and E). Although the formation of COs in the mutant delayed by ~3 h compared to wild type, final levels of COs in the mutant were indistinguishable from those in wild type (Fig. 2 E). To confirm the normal CO formation at the other locus in the CDC53mn mutant, we also analyzed the ectopic CO formation at a recombination hotspot of URA3-ARG4 (Allers and Lichten, 2001). At this locus, ectopic COs are formed between cassettes at the leu2 and his4 loci (Fig. 2 F). The CDC53mn mutant showed approximately two-hour delay in the formation of the COs at the locus relative to wild type (Fig. 2 G and H). A final level of CO products in the mutant was similar to those in the wildtype control (Fig. 2 H). In addition, we checked genome-wide DSB repair by examining chromosome bands using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (Fig. S1 E). The CDC53mn cells showed smear bands of chromosomes at 4 h, which were caused by DSB formation, and, as wild-type cells, recovered full chromosomal bands from 5 h. This, together with Rad51 focus kinetics (Fig. 1 H), suggests that most of DSBs are repaired under CDC53-depletion condition. Furthermore, these results indicate that SC formation is uncoupled with meiotic recombination in the CDC53mn mutant. It is likely that full-length SCs are not required for completion of CO formation in the absence of Cdc53.\n\nCDC53 depletion results in altered assembly of some ZMM proteins\n\nWe examined the localization of ZMM proteins (Zip3, Zip2, Mer3, Spo22/Zip4, Msh4, and Msh5), which promote SC assembly and CO formation. As reported previously (Agarwal and Roeder, 2000; Chua and Roeder, 1998; Shinohara et al., 2008; Tsubouchi et al., 2006), on wild-type chromosomes these ZMM proteins show punctate staining from leptotene to pachytene stages (Figs. 2 I and S2 A). We found that the staining of Zip3, Zip2, Mer3, and Spo22/Zip4 were altered in the CDC53mn mutant (Figs. 2 I, top and S2 A). With reduction of focus staining, the mutant accumulated PCs of Zip3, Zip2, Mer3 and Spo22/Zip4, which almost colocalize with Zip1 PCs (Figs. 2 I and S2 A). These indicate defective assembly of ZMM proteins in the CDC53mn mutant.\n\nDifferent from foci of Zip2, Zip3, Mer3 and Spo22/Zip4 proteins, foci of Msh4 and Msh5, which form a hetero-dimeric MutSγ complex (Hollingsworth et al., 1995; Novak et al., 2001), look normal in the CDC53mn mutant compared to those in wild type (Figs. 2 I and S2 A). In the mutant, Msh4 and Msh5 foci appeared with a 2-h delay, and disappeared with delay (4 h) relative to wild type (Fig. 2 J). As in wild type, the kinetics of Msh4 and Msh5 are similar to those of Rad51 in the mutant (Figs 1 H and 2 J). Notably, the CDC53mn mutant does not form any PCs containing Msh4 or Msh5 (Fig. 2 I and S2 A), different from other SC-defective mutants such as zmm (Shinohara et al., 2015; Shinohara et al., 2008). We also counted a steady-state number of Msh5 foci in the CDC53mn mutant. An average number of bright Msh5 foci at 6 h in the mutant (Fig. 2 K) was 30.7±7.3 (n=20) which is indistinguishable from the number at 4 h in wild type (29.1±6.1; Mann-Whitney U-test, P=0. 34). Normal assembly and disassembly of Msh4 and Msh5 could explain the proficiency of meiotic CO formation in the mutant (Fig. 2 E and H). This result supports the idea that, among ZMMs, Msh4-Msh5 is a key for crossover formation, whose functions are distinct from other ZMMs (Pyatnitskaya et al., 2019; Shinohara et al., 2008). Moreover, Cdc53 plays a role in proper assembly of subsets of ZMM proteins other than Msh4-Msh5 for SC assembly.\n\nCdc53 and Zip3 distinctly work in SC formation and recombination\n\nTo know the relationship between Cdc53 (ubiquitin ligase) and Zip3 (SUMO ligase), both of which is involved in SC assembly, we characterized the CDC53mn zip3 double mutant. Like the CDC53mn single mutant, the CDC53mn zip3 double mutant shows an arrest during meiosis (Fig. 3 A), which is different from the zip3 mutant with delayed progression of the meiotic prophase (Agarwal and Roeder, 2000; Borner et al., 2004). While both of the CDC53mn and zip3 single mutants can repair meiotic DSBs with substantial delay, CDC53mn zip3 double mutant accumulated unrepaired DSBs at the HIS4-LEU2 hotspot with hyper-resection at late time points (Fig. 3 B and C). The inability of the double mutant to repair the DSBs was confirmed by the accumulation of Rad51 foci at late time points such as 12 h (Fig. 3 D), when the disappearance of Rad51 foci is seen in both CDC53mn and zip3 single mutants. Moreover, CDC53mn zip3 double mutant formed lower levels of COs compared to the zip3 single mutant (Fig. 3 E and F). Different from CDC53mn single mutant, the double mutant did not express Cdc5 as a marker for pachytene exit (Chu and Herskowitz, 1998) (Fig. S2 B), indicating an arrest induced by recombination checkpoint response to unrepaired DSBs. These results suggest that Cdc53 plays a role for efficient repair of meiotic DSBs, thus CO formation, in the absence of Zip3.\n\nSC formation in the CDC53mn zip3 double mutant was analyzed by Zip1 staining. On spreads of both the CDC53mn and zip3 single mutants, short lines of Zip1 were often formed (Fig. 3 G and H). On the other hand, the CDC53mn zip3 double mutant reduces the formation of short Zip1 lines compared to either the single mutant (Fig. 3 H). Different from the either single mutants, which disassemble abnormal SCs at late times, the double mutant did not disassemble SCs (Fig. 3 H), which is probably due to pachytene arrest (Fig. S2 B). These suggest that Cdc53 and Zip3 distinctly work for SC assembly as well as CO formation.\n\nCDC53mn mutant forms altered chromosome axis\n\nDefective SC assembly in the CDC53mn cells is due to either the assembly of SC per se or rapid turnover (precocious disassembly) of fully-elongated SCs in the mutant. To distinguish these possibilities, we introduced an ndt80 mutation, which blocks the disassembly of the SC by inducing mid-pachytene arrest (Fig. S3A)(Xu et al., 1995). As shown previously (Xu et al., 1995), the ndt80 single mutant accumulated full length SCs (Fig. S3 B-D). The ndt80 mutation weakly suppresses SC-elongation defect in the CDC53mn mutant only at late times; e.g. 10 h (Fig. S3 D). However, about 20% of the CDC53mn ndt80 double mutant showed long Zip1 lines at late times, while few long Zip1 lines were transiently formed upon Cdc53 depletion, indicating that the SC assembly defect in the CDC53mn mutant is not caused by precocious SC disassembly. Based on above results, we concluded that Cdc53 is necessary for efficient SC assembly.\n\nWe confirmed defective SC formation in the mutant by analyzing the localization of chromosomal axis proteins, Hop1 (Fig. 4 A). In the wild-type cells, Hop1 initially binds to unsynapsed chromosomes as multiple foci/lines and then later large fractions of Hop1 a dissociate from synapsed chromosomes (Fig. 4 A), as shown previously (Smith and Roeder, 1997). The CDC53mn mutant accumulated Hop1 on chromosomes as multiple foci (Fig. 4 A and B). Even at late times (6 and 8 h), the multiple Hop1 foci/lines persisted on the chromosomes and disappeared at late times. The appearance and disappearance of Hop1 delayed in the mutant by ~2 h and ~4 h delay, respectively, relative to wild type (Fig. 4 B).\n\nWe also examined the localization of other axis components, Rec8 and Red1 (Klein et al., 1999; Smith and Roeder, 1997). Wild-type cells show dot/short line staining of Red1 and Rec8 in early prophase-I. In pachytene stage, when synapsis is almost completed, both proteins show beads-in-line staining (Fig. 4 C), which is different from Hop1. In wild-type spreads, both Rec8 and Red1 showed dots at 2 h and short and long lines with beads-in-line staining at 4 h (Fig. 4 C). In wild type, Red1 and Rec8 disappeared at 6 h (Fig. 4 E). On the other hand, the CDC53mn mutant formed few Red1/Rec8 long beads-in-lines at any times during prophase-I (Fig. 4 C and E), consistent with SC defects in the mutant. Moreover, in the CDC53mn mutant, Red1 dots appeared from 2 h, short-line staining peaked at 6 h and, from 8 h, Red1 signals gradually decreased during further incubation (Fig. 4 E). Contrary to Red1, few Rec8 dot-positive spreads was observed at 2 h in the mutant. Short lines of Rec8 appeared from 4 h and peaked at 6 h and some fractions of Rec8 short-lines started to disappear from 8 h, probably due to the cleavage-independent cohesin release (Challa et al., 2019). Rec8 dots persisted on chromosomes during further incubation as a result of metaphase-I arrest; no cleavage of Rec8. This result indicated the uncoordinated loading of axis proteins Red1 and Rec8/Hop1 in early meiosis in the CDC53mn mutant. Indeed, the mutant showed spreads at early time points such as 3 h, which are positive for Red1 but negative for Rec8 (Fig. 4 D). This staining was rarely seen in early wild-type spreads (Fig. 4 C). Rather than delayed loading of Hop1/Rec8, the mutant exhibited precocious loading of Red1 (and Zip1; Fig. 1 F), suggesting un-coordinated loading of chromosomal proteins. These imply that the CDC53mn mutant assembles an altered structure of meiotic chromosome axis.\n\nWe also analyzed chromosome axis structure by deconvolution analysis of DAPI-stained chromosomes. In wild type, we often see two pairs of DAPI-stained lines are co-aligned with each other (Fig. 5 A). Like the zip3 mutant (Agarwal and Roeder, 2000), the CDC53mn mutant formed few DAPI-dense linear structures. Thus, these suggest that Cdc53 might promote proper formation of chromosome axes. To probe chromosome axis structure, we compared Rec8 staining in the CDC53mn mutant with those in the zip3 and gmc2 mutants, both of which are defective in SC formation. In the zip3 mutant, which shows zippering-defect of SCs (Agarwal and Roeder, 2000), beads-on-line staining of both Rec8 and Red1 is observed at late time points, suggesting normal assembly of AE or chromosome axis in the zip3 mutant. On the other hand, the CDC53mn mutant shows more dotty staining of Rec8 than the zip3 (Fig. 3 I). The gmc2 mutant is also defective in SC elongation, but retains ability to forms COs (Humphryes et al., 2013), which is similar to the CDC53mn single mutant. Unlike the CDC53mn mutant, the gmc2 mutant also exhibited elongated Rec8 lines (Fig. S3 E). This supports the idea that the CDC53mn mutant form altered chromosome axis, which is different from other SC-defective mutants.\n\nDuring meiotic prophase-I, chromosome axes are compacted compared to that in pre-meiotic cells (Challa et al., 2019; Challa et al., 2016). We measured the distance between CenIV and TelIV loci marked with GFP in an intact cell (Fig. S2, Fig. 4 F). The distance of the two loci in wild-type cells at 4 h was 0.89 ± 0.26 μm (n=166) while that at 5 h in the CDC53mn mutant cells was 1.06 ± 0.35 μm (n=166, Mann Whitney, P value<0.0001). This showed that the CDC53mn mutant is defective in chromosome compaction during meiosis.\n\nThe pch2 deletion largely suppresses SC defect by Cdc53 depletion\n\nAs a SCF component, Cdc53 facilitates the degradation of a target protein which functions as a negative regulator for biological processes; e.g. Sic1. We hypothesized that Cdc53 may relieve the negative regulation on SC formation and looked for a mutant which rescues a defect in the CDC53mn mutant. We found that the deletion of the PCH2 gene largely suppresses SC defects induced by Cdc53 depletion (Fig. 5 A and B). The pch2 mutant was originally isolated by one which alleviates meiotic prophase-arrest induced by the zip1 mutation (San-Segundo and Roeder, 1999). Pch2 is a conserved AAA+ (ATPase Associated with various cellular Activity) ATPase protein (Wu and Burgess, 2006) involved in remodeling of chromosome axes by modulating Hop1 (Borner et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2014) as well as in the pachytene checkpoint and regulation of DSB formation (Wu and Burgess, 2006). As described previously (Borner et al., 2008; San-Segundo and Roeder, 1999), the pch2 single mutant shows more continuous Zip1 lines than wild-type (Fig. 5, A and B)(Borner et al., 2008). Different from the CDC53mn single mutant, the CDC53mn mutant with the pch2 deletion did form uniformly-stained long Zip1-lines like the pch2 single mutant (Fig. 5, A and B). Staining of Rec8 revealed similar Rec8 lines in the CDC53mn pch2 double mutant like the pch2 single mutant (Fig. 5, B), suggesting that the pch2 suppresses the SC defect in the CDC53mn mutant.\n\nWe checked whether SCs in the double mutant are formed between homologous or non-homologous chromosomes. Pairing of a centromere locus was tested using CenXV-GFP (Fig. S4D). Wild-type spreads harboring one spot peaked at 5 h with 30% (n=50), probably due to transient nature of pairing at the locus. The CDC53mn showed similar frequency of 28%, (at 6 h) supporting that the mutant is proficient in the pairing. The CDC53mn pch2 double mutant accumulated spreads with one spot with a frequency of 74% at 8 h, indicating normal pairing of CenXV-GFP in the double mutant. These indicate that SCs in the double mutant are formed between homologous chromosomes.\n\nThe CDC53mn pch2 double mutant initially accumulated Zip1 PCs with defective SC assembly at earlier times as seen in the CDC53mn single mutant, but, during further incubation, the PCs disappeared and concomitantly full-length SCs appeared in the double mutant (Fig. 5, C and D). At 8 h, most of the nuclei of the double mutant contained full SCs without any PCs. These suggest that suppression of SC defects by the pch2 mutation is not due to suppression of early defects conferred by Cdc53 depletion. Consistent with this, neither delayed onset of S-phase nor delayed degradation of Sic1 and Cdc6 in CDC53mn cells was suppressed by the pch2 (Fig. S4 A and B). The effect of the pch2 deletion on the suppression of SC-defects is very specific to Cdc53-deficiency in SC assembly, since the pch2 deletion mutation does not suppress a SC-defect induced by the zmm mutation (San-Segundo and Roeder, 1999).\n\nAlthough the CDC53mn pch2 double mutant looks to form normal SCs, the mutant arrested at the pachytene stage with full length SCs and did not disassemble SCs or exit this stage (Fig. 5 C and 6 A). We next checked meiotic recombination. The CDC53mn pch2 double mutant could not repair meiotic DSBs at HIS4-LEU2 locus and accumulated more processed DSB ends (Fig. 6 B and C), which was accompanied with the accumulation of Rad51 foci on spreads (Fig. 6 D). Consistent with DSB repair defect, the CDC53mn pch2 double mutant largely decreased CO levels compared to the wild-type strain (~1/5 of the wild type level; Fig. 6 E and F). On the other hand, the CDC53mn (Fig. 3) and pch2 single (Borner et al., 2008; Hochwagen et al., 2005) mutants showed weak DSB repair defect with normal CO formation (Fig. 6 B-F). We also checked genomewide DSB repair by examining chromosome bands using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (Fig. S1 E). Different from the CDC53mn and pch2 single mutants, the CDC53mn pch2 did not recover bands of intact chromosomes at late time points, supporting little DSB repair. These indicate that Pch2 and Cdc53 work distinctly for meiotic DSB repair and/or CO formation. Furthermore, this implies that the completion of the recombination (DSB repair) is not necessary for the formation of full SCs/synapsis. As pointed out by Kleckner (Kleckner et al., 1991), early recombination events are probably sufficient to promote synapsis between homologous chromosomes (Discussion). Consistent with the arrest with unrepaired DSBs, the CDC53mn pch2 double mutant did not express a pachytene exit marker Cdc5 (Fig. S4 B). The mid-pachytene arrest in the double mutant is induced by recombination checkpoint during meiosis (Hollingsworth and Gaglione, 2019).\n\nSince Pch2 regulates the localization of Hop1 on chromosomes (Borner et al., 2008), we checked the expression and localization of Hop1 protein (Hollingsworth et al., 1990). In wild type, Hop1 protein was induced after the entry into meiosis and persisted during meiosis (Fig. S4 C). Hop1 showed band shifts from 3 h by the phosphorylation in a manner dependent of Mec1(ATR) kinase (Carballo et al., 2008). These phosphorylated bands of Hop1 decreased during late prophase-I of wild type. The CDC53mn mutant induced similar amounts of Hop1 protein as well as phosphorylated Hop1 to the wild type, although the appearance of phospho-Hop1 was delayed by ~2 h due to probably delayed DSB formation (Fig. 2).\n\nWe checked the localization of Hop1 by immuno-staining. In wild type, Hop1 shows dotty or short-line staining prior to full synapsis and most of Hop1 dissociates from synaptic regions of pachytene chromosomes (Fig. 6 G). As a result, Hop1 localization of pachytene chromosomes is largely decreased. As reported (Borner et al., 2008), the pch2 mutant accumulated “unusual” long Hop1 lines during mid-prophase I, which colocalized with Zip1 lines. In the CDC53mn pch2 mutant, as seen in the pch2 mutant, Hop1 accumulated on full-length Zip1 lines (Fig. 6 G). These indicate that, unlike Pch2, Cdc53 does not affect Hop1 protein levels and its localization on chromosomes.\n\nOne likely possibility to explain the suppression of SC defect in the CDC53mn mutant by the pch2 is that Pch2 is a target of Cdc53-dependnet protein degradation. To check the possibility, we analyzed amounts of Pch2-HA protein by western blotting. Wild-type cells induced Pch2 from 1 h in meiosis. Pch2 peaked at 4 h and disappeared at 6 h (Fig. 6 H). The CDC53mn mutant induced Pch2 protein to wild-type levels during meiosis. The amount of Pch2 decreased slightly at late times. This suggests that Pch2 protein level is not affected by Cdc53 depletion. There are little band shifts of Pch2 during meiosis of wild-type and CDC53mn mutant strains by modifications (Fig. 6 H).\n\nWe checked Pch2 localization using anti-Pch2 antibody. In wild-type cells, as shown previously (San-Segundo and Roeder, 1999), Pch2 localizes to both chromosomes and nucleolus (Fig. 6 I). On the CDC53mn spreads, strong signals of Pch2 were seen on Zip1 PCs. This is consistent with the accumulation of Pch2 on Zip1-PC in other synapsis-defective mutants (Herruzo et al., 2016; San-Segundo and Roeder, 1999). The CDC53mn cells also showed clustered foci on nucleolus although these Pch2 signal intensities were relatively weaker than those in wild type (arrows in Fig. 6 I). Chromosomal Pch2 signals are much weaker in the CDC53mn cells relative to wild type. Since Pch2 localization on chromosomes depends on Zip1 (Herruzo et al., 2016; San-Segundo and Roeder, 1999), reduced loading of Pch2 in the mutant might be due to defective Zip1 loading.\n\nThe cdc4 mutant shows a defect in SC assembly\n\nWe next looked for a F-box protein working with Cdc53 during meiosis. Since CDC53mn cells accumulate Cdc6, whose degradation during mitosis depends on Cdc4 (Perkins et al., 2001), we checked a role of Cdc4 in SC formation by using the temperature-sensitive cdc4-3 mutant in vegetative growth. Previous analysis showed that this mutant accumulated Sic1 at 36 °C with delayed S-phase entry (Sedgwick et al., 2006). The cdc4-3 mutant showed defective Zip1 elongation at 32 °C, which is a semi-permissive temperature for the mutant, and accumulated Zip1-PCs (Fig. 7 A). Wild-type cells at 32 °C exhibited similar Rad51- and Zip1-staining kinetics to those at 30 °C (compare with Fig. 1) The cdc4-3 mutant showed normal Rad51-assembly and delayed Rad51-disassembly at 32 °C (Fig. 7 B), implying the role of Cdc4 in meiotic DSB repair. More importantly, the pch2 deletion also suppressed the Zip1-assembly defect observed in the cdc4-3 mutant at 32 °C (Fig. 7 C-E). The cdc4-3 pch2 double mutant formed long Zip1-lines like the pch2 single mutant (Fig. 7C). The cdc4-3 pch2 mutant showed little SC disassembly even at late time points (Fig. 7E). Most of the cdc4-3 mutant cells did not show an arrest at meiosis I and rather shows delayed entry into meiosis I at 32 °C (Fig. 7 F). These results indicate that Cdc4 regulates SC formation together with Cdc53, but not at the onset of anaphase-I.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes are involved in various cellular processes during both mitosis and meiosis, particularly in cell cycle progression. In this study, by analyzing the role of two SCF components, Cdc53 (cullin) and Cdc4 (F-box protein) in meiotic cells, we showed that Cdc53 and Cdc4 promote SC formation and that CDC53, but not Cdc4, is required for the transition from the metaphase-I to anaphase-I. Given that Cdc53 as SCF component mediates protein ubiquitylation, it is likely that SCF-dependent ubiquitylation is involved in the two critical meiotic events.\n\nThe role of SCF in SC assembly\n\nThe role of ubiquitylation in meiotic chromosome metabolism during meiotic prophase-I has been recently shown by the study of Hei10 ubiquitin ligase in mouse (Qiao et al., 2014). Hei10 plays a direct role in meiotic recombination and an indirect role in SC formation by antagonizing the SUMO ligase Rnf212, a Zip3 ortholog of budding yeast (Qiao et al., 2014). Moreover, in budding yeast, nematode and mouse, the proteasome localizes on meiotic chromosomes (Ahuja et al., 2017; Rao et al., 2017), supporting the role of protein ubiquitylation in meiotic chromosome functions. Our studies showed the role of SCF-dependent ubiquitylation in SC formation.\n\nLike the zmm and ecm11/gmc2 mutants (Humphryes et al., 2013; Pyatnitskaya et al., 2019), the CDC53mn mutant is deficient in the SC elongation. Importantly, there are difference in defects in meiotic chromosomal events among these mutants. The zmm mutants are defective in CO formation while the ecm11/gmc2 and CDC53mn mutants are proficient. The ecm11/gmc2 mutant shows normal assembly of ZMM proteins including Zip3 and Msh4. On the other hand, the CDC53mn mutant is defective in ZMM assembly except for Msh4-5. These suggest the involvement of Cdc53 in the Msh4/5-independent ZMM function (Pyatnitskaya et al., 2019; Shinohara et al., 2008), which might be unrelated to its role of CO formation.\n\nIn S. cerevisae, the formation of AEs is coupled with SC elongation accompanied with the polymerization of transverse filaments (Padmore et al., 1991). Moreover, while the zmm and ecm11/gmc2 mutants form normal chromosome axes (Humphryes et al., 2013; Pyatnitskaya et al., 2019), the CDC53 depletion mutant exhibits altered axis assembly. The SCFCdc4 seems to regulate chromosomal events during early prophase I when axial protein(s) are loaded. CDC53 depletion seems to cause uncoupling of the loading of SC components, Red1 (and Zip1), with that of Rec8 cohesin and Hop1 to chromosomes. In wild type, the loading of these proteins occurs in early prophase-I in a similar timing. On the other hand, the CDC53mn mutant exhibits distinct loading timing between Rec8-Hop1 and Red1-Zip1. Given delay in pre-meiotic S-phase in the cdc53 mutant, rather than delayed loading of Rec8 and Hop1, promiscuous uncoupled loading of meiosis-specific components such as Red1 (and Zip1) might occur in the mutant. These suggest that coordinated loading of different chromosomal proteins onto chromosomes promotes proper axis formation, which in turn helps SC assembly. We propose that, by functioning in early prophase-I, SCFCdc4 complex controls coordinated loading of axis proteins for proper axis formation, which is critical for coupling of axis assembly with SC elongation.\n\nAlthough we could not defect any immune-staining signals of Cdc53 on meiosis chromosome spreads, recent studies on mouse spermatocyte showed the localization of a SCF component, Skp1, on the lateral element of SCs (Guan et al., 2020), which supports the role of SCF in axis assembly. It is known that SCF regulates mitotic chromosome condensation in fruit fly and nematode (Buster et al., 2013; Feng et al., 1999). Recently, SCF ubiquitin ligase is shown to promote meiotic chromosome pairing as well as the entry into meiosis in C. elegans (Mohammad et al., 2018) and mouse (Gray et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020), which are shared defects with yeast CDC53 depletion mutant. Therefore, SCF ubiquitin ligase regulates chromosome morphogenesis during mitotic and meiotic phases in various organisms.\n\nSC assembly is negatively regulated\n\nSince the SCF complex promotes the ubiquitylation of a target protein for degradation, we could postulate the presence of a negative regulatory pathway for SC assembly, which would be inactivated by the SCF (Fig. 8). In the absence of SCF, the putative negative regulator might inhibit SC elongation. This putative negative regulator might be involved in proper coordination of axis assembly and SC elongation. In this scenario, we could expect to identify a mutation that suppresses the SC defect induced by the CDC53 depletion. Indeed, we found that the deletion of the PCH2 gene suppresses a defect in SC assembly in the CDC53mn and cdc4 mutant cells. This suggests the presence of a Pch2-dependent negative regulation for SC assembly. One possibility is that Pch2 could be a direct target of the SCFCdc4-mediated ubiquitylation. However, opposed to this expectation, our studies here did not provide any evidences to support the hypothesis that Cdc53 controls post-translational status of Pch2, Thus, there might be the other target of SCFCdc4 in SC assembly (“X” in Fig. 8).\n\nIf Pch2 is not an SCFCdc4 substrate, how does pch2 deletion suppresses SC-assembly defect in the CDC53mn mutant? In SC assembly, Pch2 (TRIP13 in mammals) regulates the dissociation of a chromosome axis protein, Hop1 (HORMAD1/2 in mammals), which might control the synapsis (Borner et al., 2008; Wojtasz et al., 2009). One likely possibility is that SCFCdc4 might control Hop1-mediated regulatory pathway for SC assembly. However, the CDC53 depletion mutant shows wild-type levels of Hop1 protein with normal phosphorylation as well as normal loading (and unloading) of Hop1 on chromosomes (Fig. 6). Therefore, it is very unlikely that the SCF directly down-regulates Hop1. Rather, we propose that, in the absence of Pch2, cells do not require SCF-dependent control for SC assembly. In other words, the pch2 mutant cells can form SCs in the presence of the negative regulator for SC assembly (Fig. 8). Pch2 may be able to activate the negative regulator for its action as seen in the activation role of TRIP13 in the spindle assembly checkpoint (Vader, 2015. Alternatively, Pch2 may impose the kinetic barrier for SC formation, which might function in parallel with Cdc53-dependent pathway. The latter role has been proposed to nematode Pch2 ortholog (PCH-2) for chromosome pairing and synapsis (Deshong et al., 2014).\n\nIn mouse Skp1 conditional knockdown spermatocytes, chromosome synapsis is partly defective with accumulation of Hormad1/2 proteins on synaptic SC regions, suggesting premature SC disassembly (Guan et al., 2020). In the yeast CDC53 depletion mutant, SC formation is almost defective with the accumulation of Hop1 protein. The ndt80 mutation, which induced pachytene arrest, did not fully suppress SC-defect in the CDC53mn mutant cells, arguing against premature SC disassembly in the yeast mutant.\n\nThe role of SCF in meiotic recombination\n\nIn mouse, SUMO-ligase Rnf212 and ubiquitin ligase Hei10 collaborate in meiotic recombination (Qiao et al., 2014). Budding yeast has a Rnf212 ortholog, Zip3, but does not have a Hei10 ortholog. In this study, we found SCF ubiquitin ligase plays a role not only in SC formation but also a role in meiotic recombination. Rather than cooperation, Zip3 and Cdc53 distinctly control CO formation, since the zip3 CDC53mn double mutant is more deficient in CO formation than the zip3 single mutant. Moreover, Cdc53 is essential for CO formation in the absence of Pch2, which plays a weak role in the recombination in wild-type background (Borner et al., 2008). These suggest a role of Cdc53 in meiotic recombination. Our results support the notion that not only sumolyation, but also ubiquitylation plays a role in recombination during yeast meiosis. This is consistent with the result that deletion of the proteasome component, Pre5, impairs the meiotic recombination (Ahuja et al., 2017).\n\nRelationship between meiotic recombination and SC formation\n\nPrevious studies show intimate relationship or coupling between meiotic recombination and SC formation. It is believed that SC regulates meiotic CO formation (Cahoon and Hawley, 2016; Gao and Colaiacovo, 2018). And also meiotic recombination promotes SC formation (Kleckner, 2006; Padmore et al., 1991). On the other hand, our studies revealed two extreme mutant’s situations, which uncouple meiotic recombination and SC elongation. First, in the case of the CDC53mn mutant, meiotic CO forms efficiently in the absence of fully-elongated SCs. This indicates that SC, at least SC elongation, IS NOT required for efficient formation of COs per se. We also observed wild-type number of Msh5 foci, which is likely to exhibit non-random distribution like Zip3 foci (Fung et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2014a; Zhang et al., 2014b), on meiotic chromosomes in the mutant. This suggests normal establishment of ZMM-dependent CO formation may occur in the absence of the CDC53, thus SC formation/proper axis assembly, although we do not know the effect of CDC53 depletion on implementation (and/or maintenance) of CO control. Second, in the CDC53mn pch2 double mutant, we observed normal SC formation with little CO formation or DSB repair. This suggests that the formation of meiotic recombination products such as COs is not necessary for SC formation. Since SC assembly depends on DSB formation, as suggested previously (Kleckner, 2006), early recombination intermediates such as DSBs and/or single-stranded DNAs at recombination sites are sufficient to trigger SC assembly. Alternatively, like in fruit fly and nematode (Dernburg et al., 1998; McKim and Hayashi-Hagihara, 1998), the CDC53mn pch2 double mutant may induce minor SC assembly pathway, which is less dependent of the recombination.\n\nImplication for pachytene checkpoint\n\nThe CDC53mn mutant, which is defective in SC formation, but is proficient in meiotic recombination, passes through pachytene stage and proceeds at least to metaphase-anaphase I transition. Indeed, the CDC53mn mutant expresses Cdc5 and Clb1, which are under the control of Ndt80-dependent mid-pachytene checkpoint. This strongly suggests that abnormal SC in the mutant does not trigger any delay or arrest in meiotic prophase I, suggesting the absence of checkpoint, which monitors synapsis (SC elongation) under the condition. Alternatively, Cdc53 by itself might mediate the synapsis checkpoint signaling.\n\nMore interestingly, the pch2 mutation, when combined with the CDC53mn, rather accelerates the cell cycle progression, but induces an arrest, due to inability to repair DSBs, suggesting a role of Pch2 in meiotic recombination, but not in the recombination checkpoint. Consistent with this, in mouse, a mutation of the Pch2 homolog Trip13 is known not to alleviate any defects induced by various meiotic mutations (Li and Schimenti, 2007). In addition, in plant, there is no synaptic checkpoint since meiotic cells progress through cell cycle even in the presence of defective synapsis (Hamant et al., 2006). We propose that SC elongation (synapsis) is not monitored by the surveillance mechanism even in yeast, since meiotic cells has an ability to dismantle abnormal SC with normal CO formation.\n\nThe role of SCF in metaphase-I-to-anaphase-I transition\n\nIn addition to roles during prophase-I, SCF might is involved in the transition from metaphase I to anaphase I. The simplest interpretation is that SCF may degrade an inhibitor molecule for APC/C at the transition. The cdc4 mutant is deficient in SC formation, but is proficient in the transition from metaphase I to anaphase I, suggesting the involvement of a F-box protein other hand Cdc4 in this transition. Similar arrest at metaphase/anaphase-I transition was reported to a yeast mutant of the RAD6 (Yamashita et al., 2004), which encodes an E2 enzyme for ubiquitylation. The role of Rad6 in SC formation is less clear since the rad6 mutant also reduces DSB formation, which also affect SC assembly. Moreover, at metaphase/anaphase II transition of Xenopus oocytes, SCF is known to promote the degradation of an APC/C inhibitor, Erp1/Emi2 (Nishiyama et al., 2007). We need to identify a target molecule of SCF ubiquitin ligase for not only SC assembly but also the onset of anaphase-I. Indeed, recent two studies showed the role of SCF in the transition in mouse meiosis. One study showed the role of SCF in the activation of Wee1 kinase, which negatively regulates Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) in anaphase-I onset (Gray et al., 2020). The other showed that the role of MPF (Cdk) activation in both spermatocytes and oocytes (Guan et al., 2020). The role of SCF in metaphase-I-to-anaphase-I transition seems to be conserved from yeast to higher eukaryotes.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nStrains and plasmids\n\nAll strains described here are derivatives of SK1 diploids, NKY1551 (MATα/MATa, lys2/”, ura3/” leu2::hisG/”, his4X-LEU2-URA3/his4B-LEU2, arg4-nsp/arg4-bgl) except cdc4-3 strain, which is a congenic strain. An ectopic recombination system with the URA3-ARG4 cassette was provided by Dr. Michael Lichten. SK1 cdc4-3 strain and CENXV-GFP strains were a kind gift from Drs. D. Stuart and D. Koshland, respectively. The genotypes of each strain used in this study are described in Supplemental Table S1.\n\nStrain Construction\n\npCLB2-3HA-CDC53 were constructed by replacing an endogenous promoter with the promoter from the CLB2 gene. The addition of the HA tag is important to deplete Cdc53 during meiosis. pch2, zip3 and ndt80 null alleles were constructed by PCR-mediated gene disruption using either the TRP1 or LEU2 genes (Wach et al., 1994). REC8-3HA, PCH2-3Flag (−3HA) and CDC53-3Flag were constructed by a PCR-based tagging methodology (De Antoni and Gallwitz, 2000).\n\nAnti-serum and antibodies\n\nAnti-HA antibody (16B12; Babco), anti-Flag (M2, Sigma), anti-tubulin (MCA77G, Bio-Rad/Serotec, Ltd), anti-GFP (3E6; Molecular Probes), and guinea pig anti-Rad51 (Shinohara et al., 2000) were used for staining. Anti-Cdc53 is a generous gift from Dr. M. Blobel. Anti-Zip1, -Zip3, -Zip2, -Mer3, -Spo22/Zip4, -Msh4, -Msh5 as well as anti-Red1 were described previously (Shinohara et al., 2008). Anti-Rec8 antibody was described previously (Rao et al., 2011). Anti-Hop1 serum was described in (Bani Ismail et al., 2014). Anti-Sic1 (sc-50441, 1:1000) and anti-Cdc5 (sc-33635, 1:1000) antibodies were purchased from SantaCruz Biotech. Anti-Cdc6 (Cdc6 9H8/5) was purchased from Abcam. The second antibodies for staining were Alexa-488 (Goat) and −594 (Goat) IgG used at a 1/2000 dilution (Themo Fishers).\n\nAnti-Pch2 was raised against recombinant N-terminus 300 amino acid of truncated protein purified from E. coli. An open-reading frame of the truncated Pch2 was PCR-amplified and inserted into pET15b plasmid (Novagen) in which an N-terminus of the PCH2 gene was tagged with hexa-histidine. Pch2 protein with the histidine tag was affinity-purified using the Nickel resin as described by manufactures and used for immunization (MBL Co. Ltd).\n\nFor double staining the following combinations were used; anti-Rad51 (guinea pig) and anti-Zip1 (rabbit), anti-ZMM (Zip2, Zip3, Zip4/Spo22, Msh4, Msh5, all rabbit) and anti-Zip1 (rat); anti-Red1 (chicken), anti-Rec8 (rabbit); anti-Zip1 (rat), anti-Rec8 (rabbit); anti-Zip1 (rat), anti-Pch2 (rabbit); anti-Zip1 (rat), anti-Hop1 (rabbit).\n\nCytology\n\nImmunostaining of chromosome spreads was performed as described previously (Shinohara et al., 2000; Shinohara et al., 2003). Stained samples were observed using an epi-fluorescent microscope (BX51; Olympus) with a 100 X objective (NA1.3). Images were captured by CCD camera (Cool Snap; Roper) and, then processed using IP lab and/or iVision (Sillicon), and Photoshop (Adobe) software. For focus counting, more than 100 nuclei were counted at each time point.\n\nHigh-resolution images were captured by a computer-assisted fluorescence microscope system (Delta vision, Applied Precision). The objective lens was an oil-immersion lens (100X, NA=1.35). Image deconvolution was carried out using an image workstation (SoftWorks; Applied Precision).\n\nPairing of chromosomes was analyzed in the whole yeast cells with two homologous LacI-GFP spots at CENX locus. Following fluorescence microscope imaging, the number of chromosomal locus-marked GFP foci in a single cell was counted manually.\n\nThe distance between two GFP foci on chromosome IV on a single focal plane in a intact yeast cell taken by the fluorescence microscope system (Delta vision, Applied Precision) was measured by NIH image J program.\n\nZip1 polycomplexes (PCs) were defined as a relatively large Zip1 staining outside of the DAPI staining region.\n\nWestern blotting\n\nWestern blotting was performed as described previously (Hayase et al., 2004; Shinohara et al., 2008). Western blotting was performed for cell lysates extracted by TCA method. After being harvested and washed twice with 20% TCA, cells were roughly disrupted by Yasui Kikai (Yasui Kikai Co Ltd, Japan). Protein precipitation recovered by centrifuge at 3000rpm for 5min was suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer adjusting to pH8.8 and then boiled for 95°C, 2min.\n\nSouthern Blotting\n\nTime-course analyses of DNA events in meiosis and cell cycle progression were performed as described previously (Shinohara et al., 1997; Storlazzi et al., 1996). Southern blotting analysis was performed with the same procedure as in (Storlazzi et al., 1995). For the HIS4-LEU2 locus, genomic DNA prepared was digested with XhoI (for crossover) and PsfI (for meiotic DSBs). For the URA3-ARG4 locus, the DNA were digested with XhoI. Probes for southern blotting were Probe 155 for crossover and Probe 291 for DSB detection on the HIS4-LEU2 as described in (Xu et al., 1995). Image gauge software (Fujifilm Co. Ltd., Japan) was used for quantification for bands.\n\nPulsed field gel electrophoresis\n\nFor pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), chromosomal DNA was prepared in agarose plugs as described in (Bani Ismail et al., 2014; Farmer et al., 2011) and run at 14 °C in a CHEF DR-III apparatus (BioRad) using the field 6V/cm at a 120° angle. Switching times followed a ramp from 15.1 to 25.1 seconds.\n\nStatistics\n\nMeans ± S.D values are shown. Datasets (Fig. 2 K; Fig. 4 F) were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test (Prism, GraphPad).\n\nOn-line supplemental material\n\nFig. S1A shows a protein level of Cdc53 during meiosis. Fig.1B-D shows meiotic cell cycle analysis of the CDC53mn mutant; S-phase, meiosis I and protein expression. Fig. S1E shows PFGE analysis of meiotic chromosomes for DSB repair.
