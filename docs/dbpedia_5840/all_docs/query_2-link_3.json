        "text": "Mir News 296: American EVA outside Mir - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-23, STS-76 Mir NASA-1.\n\nThe EVA made by Clifford and Godwin on 27.03.96 lasted 6 hrs and 2 mins. The Mir crew experienced this EVA passively: their involvement consisted of observing and filming the event through some portholes. It was not easy to cover all activities of the American astronauts fully. They could see a part of the EVA through a porthole in de airlock of Module-D. The best view they got was through the porthole of the cabin of the board engineer in the Base Block. During the EVA the communications went via American channels. On the EVA frequency 279.000 mc Clifford and Godwin could be heard now and then. The same transmissions could be heard via the CNN relay from a TDRS. The Americans installed the experiments on the outer surface of the Docking Compartment at the Kristall-module. (The Russians speak about the 'SO'. The 'O' stands for Otsek, which means 'compartment'. So the do not speak about 'module'.) Atlantis-Mir-combination: During the period in which Atlantis and Mir were linked together many activities took place during the night in our area. We were lucky that this was not so during the EVA, which took place during our morning hours. The operations during the precursor flights cast a gloom over the future. It becomes obvious who will be in command during the flight of the International Space Station: undoubtedly this will be the Americans. Immediately after the docking the Americans took over the attitude control of the whole complex, and most of the communications and the control of the operations were theirs. Undocking of Atlantis. This took place on 29.03.96 at 0108 UTC. After the undocking Atlantis made a flight around the Mir complex and moved away at abt 1 hour later. Onufriyenko could be heard on the Mir-frequencies 130.625 and 143.625mc speaking about the attitude (movements-) control of the Mir station which was now under full control of FCC Kalingrad again. (TsUP-M). The transmissions of the images from Mir about the Atlantis were relayed by tracking stations inside Russian territory.\n\nMir: The passes of Mir for our area take place during the night hours and so there is not much to report about the life on board. Module Priroda: The launch of this module has been put back again. Latest available planned launch date: 23.04.1996. Chris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202\n\nMir News 297: Mir - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-23, STS-76 Mir NASA-1.\n\nPlans for the near future:\n\nThe first operation will be the launch of the module Priroda. The Russians want to launch this module on 23.04.1996, but further delay might be possible. In fact all is ready for that launch, but specialists responsible for the power supply of that module want to be sure that the accumulators are fully reliable if unexpected the Priroda has to fly longer than the estimated period between launch and docking. The Priroda has not been equipped with solar panels and if the accumulators show failures there are no alternatives. That is why the experts responsible for the power systems and energy consumption take more time for tests. The dates for some important operations can be set only after the launch and successful docking of Priroda and the redocking thereafter. Priroda has to dock to the forward axial port (-X axis) and will be repositioned from there to the radial port (+Z axis). After this the date for the launch of the freighter Progress-M31 can be determined.\n\n2d Spacewalk (EVA) 21st Main Expedition Mir: Possibly this operation will be executed in May this year. The cosmonauts will have to transfer one of the solar panels which have been brought to Mir by Atlantis (STS-74) and who are still attached at the outer surface of the Docking Compartment (SO - so not Docking Module. SO stands for 'Stykovochnyy Otsek'). They will have to transfer that solar panel to the astrophysical module Kvant-1 (Module-E). During this operation they will use the 2d Strela, which they installed during their first EVA. With this 2d Strela-crane they have the possibility for movements between the SO and the Kvant-1. Originally the Russians planned to install on Kvant-1 the solar panel which is still at the outer surface of the Kristall-module, but they preferred the installation on Kvant-1 of a brand new one. The Russians hope to accomplish this task during that 2nd EVA, but they are ready to insert a 3rd EVA if necessary. The solar panels which have been brought to Mir on the outer surface of the SO will not be deployed from there, but will be used on parts of the Mir-complex.\n\nVDU: This abbreviation stands for External Engine Installation. This is the box, which can be seen in the top of the long Sofora mast which has been erected on Kvant-1. Nobody was sure about the use or the usefulness of that engine. In an interview Thomas Reiter told me that this VDU often is used for the orientation of the complex during periods in which the gyrodynes have to be silenced for repositioning. These gyrodynes cannot turn through 360 degrees and so now and then repositioning is necessary. There is a problem for the future: when the fuel of the VDU has been spent refuelling will not be possible. Perhaps the Russians hoped that fuel would be sufficient for the VDU at least until the end of the operational life of Mir in 1997 or 1998. So if they want to prolong the use of Mir by some years they will have to find a way to refuel that VDU or to install a new one.\n\nChris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202.\n\nMir News 298: Launch Priroda - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-23, STS-76 Mir NASA-1.\n\nThe planned launch date/time for the Module Priroda is 23.04. 1996 at 11hrs 48mins 43secs UTC. If all goes according to plan the Priroda will dock to Mir (forward docking port transition section -P.Kh.O.-, -X axis) on 26.04.1996 at 1203 UTC.\n\nPriroda: The module for remote sensing Priroda is also known as TsM-I and 77KSI. In space Priroda has a mass of 19.5 tons. The mass of the payload is 10.5 tons, among which 1.2 tons as a supplement for the equipment of the Mir-complex, the remote sensing equipment has a mass of 4.7 tons and Priroda can transport 1.8 tons cargo. The original planning foresaw in a solar array in the front of Priroda (axial), but the place of the array is now used for the installation of extra equipment and experiments. So during the autonomous flight Priroda has to depend on the nickel cadmium accumulators for her power supply. Priroda must have an active lifetime of more than 3 years.\n\nCargo: Priroda will also deliver additional equipment to the Mir station, experiments for Shannon Lucid and the SAFEX-2 transceiver for radio-amateur activities.\n\nChris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202.\n\nMir News 300: Priroda successfully docked with Mir - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-23, STS-76 Mir NASA-1.\n\nAfter an automatic approach guided by the system Kurs Priroda linked up with Mir complex on 26.04.1996 at 1243 UTC. Quite an achievement to aim and dock a mass of 20 tons (like a huge locomotive) with a precision of less than millimetres. Priroda can take a breath for a while at the forward axial docking port of the transition section (P.Kh.O.). During the first pass of both objects for our position in Mir orbit 58195, 1235-1239 UTC, it was obvious that there were no intentions to switch over to the manual remote control TORU. At 123530 UTC Onufriyenko reported that Priroda was hovering for a while in a distance of 182 M and that all was going well. From that distance Priroda started the final stage of the approach and flawlessly docked with Mir. Just like during the whole autonomous flight the Telemetry transmitters of Priroda in het UHF band could be monitored. During the passes after the docking these transmitters remained active. Reason for this is the fact that Priroda will remain electrically autonomous until the accomplishment of the repositioning to the +Z axis.\n\nOn 27.04.1996 at 0800 UTC Priroda will remove itself with a manipulator arm (the Lyappa) to the +Z axis. After that operation the airseal can be checked before the opening of the hatches. The repositioning will take place out of our range.\n\nA part of the cargo of Priroda consists of biological experiments for the production of clean medical preparations and 900 KG equipment and experiments for the American astronaut Shannon Lucid. Priroda has been equipped by a lot of equipment for scientific research of the earth (all kinds of devices and camera's for remote sensing) and the atmosphere.\n\nChris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202.\n\nMir News 311: Progress-M32 - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-23, STS-76 Mir NASA-1.\n\nThe launch of this freighter has been put back again and is now on schedule for 22.07.1996. The Progress-M32 has to deliver new supplies of water, fuel, oxygen, food, etc. to the Mir-space station. The reason for this delay are two failures with the Soyuz-U rocket, which also is used for the launches of Progress-M ships.\n\nSoyuz-U: Within the period of some weeks 2 launches of reconnaissance satellites with the carrier Soyuz-U failed. The first time this was on Baykonur on 13.05. 49 seconds after lift off the payload fairing came loose and the control-system gave the command for self-destruction. The commission to investigate the accident failed to find a unanimous conclusion. 4 different possibilities had been suggested even the rather bizarre idea that a big bird collided with the rocket. Normally all launches of analogue rockets are suspended until the experts know for sure the cause of the accident. This time they did not wait until a definite conclusion and launched another spy-satellite, now from Plesetsk using the rocket Soyuz-U. And again exactly after 49 seconds the fairing came loose and rocket and satellite were destroyed. This time the commission started a thorough investigation, which is still going on. So possibly the launch of the freighter Progress-M32 will be put back again.\n\nMir-routine: Life goes on: the 2 Russians and Shannon Lucid are still in a very good mood. They do not seem to worry about the 'rocket' problems. The relief crew for Onufriyenko and Usachov has to fly with the Soyuz-TM24 on 14.08.1996. This crew consists of the Russians Manakov and Vinogradov and de French cosmonaut Claudie Andree-Deshays. For this launch a modified rocket, the Soyuz-U2 is needed. Financial problems might put a spoke in the wheel. During the last week Shannon Lucid worked with the Glove box. She met some problems with contacts and switches but resolved these by the help of an expert at TsUP Moscow. Shannon Lucid will be relieved by John Blaha during the 4th Shuttle-Mir docking mission STS-79 by Atlantis in the beginning of August.\n\nChris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202.\n\nMir News 318: Progress-M32 - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-23, STS-76 Mir NASA-1.\n\nThe launch of this freighter is now on schedule for 31.07.1996 at 20.00.04 UTC (For Moscow summertime 4 seconds after midnight on 1.08.96). The decision to give the green light for this launch has been taken on 29.07.1996 during a meeting of the state committee. The first attempt to launch the Progress-M32 failed due to a tank pressurisation problem. During the inspection afterwards a problem was revealed in one of the engines of a booster. The possibility to change that engine has been considered but finally the decision was taken to replace the whole booster. If all goes according to plan we might be able to hear the signals of the beacon- and telemetry transmitters of Progress-M32 at abt. 3 hrs after launch in the 922, 166 and 165 mc bands.\n\nThe estimated docking time of Progress-M32 at Mir: 2.08.1996 at abt. 2159 UTC.\n\nSoyuz-TM24: The launch of this ship with the relief crew and the French spacionaute is now on schedule for 20.08.1996. We hope to get an eventual confirmation or additional information by CNES during this week.\n\nChris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202.\n\nMir News 319: Progress-M32 - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-23, STS-76 Mir NASA-1.\n\nThis freighter was launched from Baykonur on 31.07.1996 at 20.00.06 UTC. All went well and during passes within our range the signals of the beacon- and telemetry transmitters in the 166, 165 and 922.755mc could be monitored. During the pass in orbit 4, 020700-021220 UTC TCA (Time Closest Approach) for the Hague was 020808 UTC (922.755 mc Doppler dip).\n\nIf all continues to go according to plan the Progress-M32 will link up with Mir on 2.08.1996 at 2158 UTC. The first pass (of that sequence) of Mir and Progress-M32 in Mir's orbit 59727, will last from 2147 until 2154 UTC. So during this pass the final approach is going on and radio communications regarding this operation possibly can be monitored in the VHF-band.\n\nThe Progress-M32 will deliver to the Mir-station a cargo of 2478 KG. 328 KG of this cargo consists of experiments and equipment to be used by the French spacionaute Claudie Andre-Deshays during her Cassiopeia mission to Mir this month. The cargo further consists of water, food, fuel, oxygen, letters, equipment, software, spare parts etc.\n\nProgress-M31: This freighter is still docked at the forward (-X axis) port of the Mir-station and this port has to be free for the arrival of Progress-M31's successor Progress-M32. For that reason Progress-M31 will separate from Mir on 1.08.1996 at 1642 UTC and after a short autonomous flight this freighter will be put on a destruction course and burn up in the atmosphere over a designated area of the Pacific East of New-Zealand.\n\nChris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK-3202.\n\nMir News 320: Progress-M32 - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-23, STS-76 Mir NASA-1.\n\nDocking at Mir:\n\nProgress-M32 docked at the Mir-station (-X axis, forward port transition section) on 2.08.1996 at 22.03.44 UTC. So 6 minutes later than planned. Approach and docking were executed in the automatic mode by the use of the system Kurs.\n\nRadio traffic: As always during such operations the radio traffic was very interesting. During the pass in orb. 59727, 2149-2156 UTC , the approach was still going on. The crew just accomplished a test of the TORU-system (for eventual manual guidance by the Mir-crew). They did not use this system. At 215520 UTC the distance between Progress-M32 and Mir was 180 M. The cosmonauts monitored the images made from Progress-M32 of the station on their displays. They also observed the approaching Progress-M32 via illuminators. The traffic revealed that, though somewhat slower than planned, the operation was proceeding well. During the next pass in orb. 59728, 2327-2333 UTC, radio traffic revealed that Progress-M32 had docked at Mir. The preparations for the opening of the hatches were going on, i.e. airseal checks, the equalisation of the pressures in Progress-M32 and Mir, deployment of an air hose, and so on. During the pass in orb. 59729, on 3.08.1996 from 0057-0107 UTC, the hatches were open and de cosmonauts already had entered the freighter to remove things which had to be transferred to the complex as soon as possible. After checks of the systems of Progress-M32 and the work to be sure that Progress-M32 was fixed at the station tight and safely the crew could go asleep. And so did, tired but satisfied, your 'observer'.\n\nThe Progress-M32, will -relatively- remain a part of the Mir-complex for a short period: If the operations with Soyuz-TM24 (relief crew) will proceed according to plan (of this moment) Progress-M32 has to depart on 20.08.1996 to free the forward docking port for the Soyuz-TM24, which has to be launched on 19.08.1996. Progress-M31: This old freighter separated from Mir on 1.08.1996 at 16.44.54 UTC. and burnt up in the atmosphere. (Further details in a next Mir-report.)\n\nChris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202.\n\nMir News 321: 22d Main Expedition to Mir - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-23, STS-76 Mir NASA-1.\n\nDue to serious hearth rhythm problems Manakov, the commander of the main crew, had to be hospitalised. So the core crew has been replaced by the stand ins. The French spacionaute Claudie Andre-Deshays will stay in the main crew. The crew of the 22d ME will consist of: Valeriy Grigoryevich Korzun (Commander), Aleksandr Yuryevich Kaleri (board engineer) and Claudie Andre-Deshays, (cosmonaut-researcher, guest cosmonaut CNES. ) Vinogradov and Leopold Eyharts remain available for the eventual replacement of respectively Kaleri and/or Andre-Deshays. There is no reserve commander available.\n\nLaunch of Soyuz-TM24: The launch of this ship with the above mentioned crew members has been put forward and will now take place from Baykonur on 17.08.1996 at abt 1317 UTC.\n\nThe service call sign of the crew is FREGAT, so resp. Fregat-1. -2 and -3).\n\nThe names of the new crew and the earlier launch date had been given by a recorded message of Shannon Lucid transmitted from Mir on 437.925 mc.\n\nProgress-M31: As already has been reported this freighter ceased her existence on 1.08.1996. The exact times of this operation were: Separation from Mir: 16.44.45 UTC, start reentry burn: 19.44.30 UTC and burning up over a designated area in the Pacific East of New Zealand: 2033 UTC.\n\nProgress-M32: This freighter is still docked at Mir. If the launch and first part of the flight of Soyuz-TM24 will proceed as planned Progress-32 will undock from Mir on 18.08.1996 and burn up in the atmosphere.\n\nChris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202.\n\nMir News 326: Progress-M32 redocked at the Mir space station. - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-24, STS-76 Mir NASA-1.\n\nToday Progress-M32 concluded her autonomous flight. This flight began on 18.08.1996 , so 1 day before the docking of Soyuz-TM24. Approach and docking took place 1 orbit later than originally planned and was executed in the automatic mode with the system Kurs. The docking at the aft docking port (Kvant, +X-axis) was accomplished on 3.09 at 09.35.21 UTC. For those monitoring operations like this the delay of this operation until orbit 60212 from 0927-0932 UTC was a piece of good luck because of the fact that they could monitor the final phase of the operation. Commander Korzun observed the approach via the displays of the systems LIV and TORU and reported distances, approach speeds and manoeuvres around the X-axis. When both objects disappeared behind the horizon the distance was 95 meters and the appr. speed 0.8 M/sec. During the pass in orb. 60213 from 1102-1108 UTC it was obvious that Progress-M32 was a part of the Mir-complex again. Meanwhile Korzun had corrected the attitude of the complex. He got orders not to carry out the airseal checks and the opening of the hatch today.\n\n(So in a relative short period the Russians successfully accomplished crucial operations. As far as Russian spaceflight is concerned Aleksandr Lebedj has nothing to worry about!!)\n\nChris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202.\n\nMir News 328: Start Atlantis - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-24, STS-76 Mir NASA-1, STS-79, STS-79 Mir NASA-2.\n\nWithin 20 minutes after the launch of Atlantis on mission STS-79 on 16.09.1996 at 08.54.49 UTC commander Readdy could be heard in a contact with Houston via a relay station in Spain. This was on 259.700 mc (AM) between 0913-0919 UTC. For ballistic reasons lift-off took place 46 seconds later than originally planned.\n\nRendezvous and docking operations:\n\nBegin Mir rendezvous operation: 18.09 2134 UTC TI Burn 19.09 0003 Arrival on R-bar (Earth radius vector) 0153 Hovering at 170 feet from Mir 0235 Begin final approach 0310 Atlantis docks with Mir 0317 Hardmate Atlantis/Mir 0337\n\nFor observers in Western-Europe the passes of Mir (and -the then being in a short distance- of Atlantis) begin during Mir's orbit nr. 60468 with a pass between 0307-0315 UTC, maximum elevation 11 degrees. So communications between Mir and Atlantis might be possible on the well known VHF frequencies. Whether there will be TV-images -for instance via CNN- or not is not sure at this point. If the Russians use Altair-1 (Cosmos-2054) over 16 dgs West images seen by Mir of the approaching Atlantis might be possible between 0230-0324 UTC. During the last docking mission of Atlantis (STS-76) those images could be seen via CNN together with images of Mir seen by a camera in Atlantis. It is also possible that the Russians will use Altair-2 (over 96 dgs East) during the window from 0306-0402 UTC.\n\nChris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202\n\nMir News 329: Atlantis docked at Mir - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-24, STS-76 Mir NASA-1, STS-79, STS-79 Mir NASA-2.\n\n'Readdy was ready' and he controlled the free drift with a speed of appr. 2.5 cm/sec of Atlantis to Mir during the final phase of the approach. The result was a perfect soft docking on 19.09.96 at 0313 UTC. The original operation schedule was almost executed on the minute, except for the time of the 'touch', which had been put forward by 4 minutes. For friends in Western Europa who use to monitor radio transmissions during such operations this was a blessing for it meant that the docking could take place within the window for both objects on Mir's orbit nr. 60468, 0307-0315 UTC. So at 031330 UTC they could hear Readdy reporting in Russian: 'KASANIYE' (touch). For this report he used the 130.165 mc FM and immediately after his report commander Korzun in Mir reported on 143.625 mc that he had a positive indication about the docking. Monitoring people always hope that they can pick up that important word 'kasaniye' during dockings of Soyuz- and Progress-ships, but mostly the moment of that touch takes place just a few minutes after LOS of their position, in the past this occurred a few times during Soyuz-TM dockings. Of course it is always possible to log the traffic during such dockings in the final phase of the approach. This time there was not much radio traffic before the 'touch' for Readdy had to do his job with concentration and everybody was watching the operation silently. TV-images transmitted by TV-stations revealed that there were no direct images from camera's on board Mir. So possibly the geostationary Luches: Altair-1 and 2 were not in use. During the first 3 docking missions these images could be seen simultaneously with the images from Atlantis , relayed by TDRS-s. Certainly we will get images made from inside Mir during the docking operation, but these were recorded and transmitted to earth later. During the next pass of the enormous space-complex (in orb. Mir nr. 60469, 0441-0453 UTC) the Mir-crew already had accomplished the air-seal checks and opened 2 hatches of the SO (docking compartment). They also had removed things which had been necessary during the docking and now had to be stowed away. Just before LOS for our position Korzun tried to communicate via 130.165 mc with Atlantis to get information about the proceedings there. Opening of the hatches from Atlantis to Mir took place at 0539 UTC, so not in our VHF-range. Via TV-stations receiving relays via a TDRS we could see nice images of the meeting of both crews and the first gathering on board Mir.\n\nSAREX STS-79: During this mission there might be radio-amateur activities by the astronauts-radio-amateurs Jay Apt (N5QWL), Carl Walz (KC5TIE) and John Blaha (KC5TZQ). Sarex VHF downlink is 145.840 mc FM with uplink frequencies: 144.450 and 144.470 mc FM. Please do not use 145.840 mc FM for 'uplink' or -during Atlantis passes -local bragging. Chris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202\n\nMir News 330: Progress-M33 - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-24, STS-79 Mir NASA-2.\n\nThe launch of this freighter was planned for 15.10.1996. Due to problems with the carrier-rocket the launch has been put back possibly to 2.11.1996.\n\nMir-routine: Mir's passes for our position are gradually shifting from the night to the late evening hours. So still not much traffic via VHF. Now and then the Russians use the geostationary Altair-1 (Cosmos-2054) for Mir-communications. On 5.10.1996 the crew spoke with TsUP about a lot of condenstation in a cable compartment. Possibly this problem has been resolved as they did not mention it the next day. During conversations with TsUP on 6.10.1996 the cosmonauts mentioned the dismissal of Gen. Ivanov from his command of the VKS (space forces). They supposed that this also means that Gen. Ivanov also has been relieved of his chairmanship of the State Committee for Spaceflight. This committee always selects which crew will fly and the chairman takes the oath of departing crews. General Ivanov has a long and excellent career in spaceflight and the relinquishment of his command must be a heavy blow for Russian spaceflight. At least this is my opinion, but I am sure that the cosmonauts will share this opinion with me. John Blaha: He is like his predecessor very active and from conversations in Russian as well in English with specialists on earth can be derived that he is very enthusiastic. He still has to accustom himself to the differences between his training in replicas on earth and the practice in space. On earth things in training modules have been put straight in contradiction to the situation on board. Often it takes him a long time and consultations with the earth to find things he needs for his experiments. During passes of the Mir-station during working hours it might be possible that Blaha uses the 130.165 mc while his Russian colleagues use 143.625 mc. The arrangement for the use of 130.165 mc will be made on 143.625 mc. They speak about UKW-dva , they mean 130.165 mc.\n\nRadio-amateur traffic: The 145.550 mc is fully in use for Packet radio and often Korzun can be heard in phone with amateurs on earth. Korzun is a skilled and enthusiastic radio-amateur. It is also worth while to monitor the 437.925 and 437.950 mc for traffic via the Safex installation in the Priroda module. The 437 mc band is primary for ISM-purposes (Industrial, Scientific and Medical). In my neighbourhood this band is fully blocked by a hospital using that band for health monitoring equipment. I would be very pleased to hear experiences in this field from friends in other parts of our globe.\n\nChris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202.\n\nMir News 334: Successful launch freighter Progress-M33 - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-24, STS-79 Mir NASA-2.\n\nThis long-expected freighter blasted off from Baykonur on 19.11.1996 at 23 hrs 20 mins and 35 seconds UTC (for Moscow-time and for MEWT already on 20.11.1996). After some orbits the beacon- and TLM-transmissions could be monitored over here. The cargo of Progress-M33 consisting of post, food, spare-parts, containers for human waste and materials for experiments weighs 1650 KG. In the tank-compartment of Progress-M33 547 KG oxygen, fuel and water has been stored. Fuel for the Mir-complex itself weighs 2462 KG. Also among the 547 KG a new supply of nitrogen for the pressurising and purging of the oxygen-producing Elektron systems. Because of the fact that there will be no further deliveries of supplies before New Year the mail-bag also contains the Christmas- and New Year post for the crew.\n\nProgress-M32: This old freighter has to free the port at which she is docked now for the arrival of the Progress-M33. This is the aft docking port (Kvant-1, +X-axis). Progress-M32 can abandon the Mir-station for the systems of her successor are working normally. This will take place on 20.11.1996 at 1945 UTC. After a few orbits Progress-M32's engines will be fired for the de-orbit manoeuvre after which Progress-M32 will burn up over a designated area in the Pacific East of New Zealand.\n\nExpected time of arrival and docking Progress-M33 at Mir:\n\nThis will be on 22.11.1996 at 0100 UTC. Progress-M33 has to approach and dock in the automatic mode by the system Kurs. If this system fails commander Korzun is ready to conduct the freighter manually with the system TORU.\n\nChris v.d.

Flight: Soyuz TM-24, STS-79 Mir NASA-2.\n\nThe crew of the 22d M.E. to Mir, Korzun and Kaleri, will do this EVA on 2.12.1996 between 1550 UTC (opening hatch) and 2130 UTC (closure hatch). During this EVA they will have to install extra cables and contacts for a solar panel on the outer surface of the astrophysical module Kvant-1 (Module-E). This solar panel had been installed over there in May 1996 by Onufriyenko and Usachov. This panel had been delivered to Mir by Atlantis on 15.11.1995 during mission STS-74 as cargo on the docking compartment. At the outer surface of that compartment 2 solar batteries had been stowed, 1 Russian and 1 American. In May 1996 the American one had been installed and partly connected. That is why the solar panel could deliver not more than 3 kW. If the work during the 1st EVA will be accomplished successfully the panel can deliver 6 kW electrical power. During the EVA John Blaha will remain inside the complex to assist and take care for the communications.\n\nRadio communications during this EVA:\n\nDuring passes on 143 mc, but somewhat lower than 143.625 mc and possibly via the 2 available geostationary Altair-satellites.\n\nChris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202.\n\nMir News 337: 1st Spacewalk (EVA) crew 22d Main Expedition - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-24, STS-79 Mir NASA-2.\n\nKorzun and Kaleri did this EVA on 2.12.1996 between 1554 and 2151 UTC (duration 5 hrs. 57 mins). They had to deploy and connect cables to the American solar panel on the outer surface of Kvant-1. They accomplished their task successfully and without problems. The solar panel has been checked and can deliver a current of 80 Amperes. When Mir for the first time came within our range (orbit 61636, 2015-2022 UTC) the cosmonauts were still working near the Sofora girder. Somewhat later they returned to the airlock. During the 2d pass for our position (orb. 61637, 2149-2159 UTC) Korzun reported the closure of the hatch at 2157 UTC. Regularly John Blaha could be heard in contacts with TsUP and the cosmonauts. Inside the Mir- complex he assisted the cosmonauts, checked systems and executed commands given to him by TsUP. While Korzun and Kaleri were still in the airlock to equalise the air pressure Blaha in co-ordination with TsUP loaded control-data in the central computer. On 3.12.1996 at abt. 0108 UTC, everybody, your scribe inclusive, though tired but satisfied, went to sleep. 2d EVA 22d M.E.: This EVA is on schedule for 9.12.1996. During this EVA Korzun and Kaleri will have to accomplish the following tasks: 1st: The mounting of Rapana on the 3d truss construction at the outer surface of the Kvant-1 module: 2d: The installation of a new Kurs-antenna on the transition section (P.Kh.O.). Chris v.d. Berg, NL-9165/A-UK3202\n\nMir News 338: 2d Spacewalk (EVA) 22d Main expedition - . Nation: Russia. Program: Mir. Flight: Soyuz TM-24, STS-79 Mir NASA-2.\n\nThis EVA took place on 9.12.1996 between 1352 UTC (opening hatch) and 2028 UTC (closing hatch). So a duration of 6 hrs 36 mins. The EVA lasted longer for Korzun wished to accomplish all what had to be done and there also was a problem with something which bungled loose. Before return they restored the connection of the radio-amateur antenna for the 145 mc. Probably this antenna had been disconnected by accident during the 1st EVA. They connected the antenna again and while they were flying over Chile and Brazil they asked John Blaha to listen out on the 145.800 mc to check whether the antenna was working or not. There was no traffic on that frequency in that area and so they had to wait until they came in range of European amateurs. I asked the English radio-amateur Pat Gowen (G3IOR) to give calls on 145.800 mc as soon as Mir would come in range (at abt. 1934 UTC). So he did and these signals could be heard by John Blaha while Mir was flying over France. He reported this to the still being on EVA Korzun and Kaleri and congratulated them with their success. Korzun urged John not to transmit, but to listen only. The cosmonauts fully accomplished their tasks: installing the truss construction Rapana at the truss Ferma-3 and the replacement of the Kurs-antenna on the outer surface of the P.Kh.O. (transition section). John Blaha who stayed inside the complex took care of the communications and executed commands given to him by TsUP. He gave the cosmonauts all possible moral and technical help. The cosmonauts and Blaha did an excellent job during this EVA, they gave an example of fruitful international co-operation and so they all deserve a loud: 'MOLODTSY' (very well done). Of course the cosmonauts were very tired after the EVA and back in the airlock they had to do hard labour to put off their spacesuits. Just before midnight Korzun could be heard in a contact with a Portuguese radio-amateur via the repaired antenna for the 145 mc.\n\nThus far there are no more EVA's on schedule for this crew.\n\nChris v.d.
