        "text": "Participation in multilateral effort to develop high performance integrated CPC evacuated collectors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWinston, R.; Ogallagher, J. J.\n\n1992-05-01\n\nThe University of Chicago Solar Energy Group has had a continuing program and commitment to develop an advanced evacuated solar collector integrating nonimaging concentration into its design. During the period from 1985-1987, some of our efforts were directed toward designing and prototyping a manufacturable version of an Integrated Compound Parabolic Concentrator (ICPC) evacuated collector tube as part of an international cooperative effort involving six organizations in four different countries. This 'multilateral' project made considerable progress towards a commercially practical collector. One of two basic designs considered employed a heat pipe and an internal metal reflector CPC. We fabricated and tested two large diameter (125 mm) borosilicate glass collector tubes to explore this concept. The other design also used a large diameter (125 mm) glass tube but with a specially configured internal shaped mirror CPC coupled to a U-tube absorber. Performance projections in a variety of systems applications using the computer design tools developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) task on evacuated collectors were used to optimize the optical and thermal design. The long-term goal of this work continues to be the development of a high efficiency, low cost solar collector to supply solar thermal energy at temperatures up to 250 C. Some experience and perspectives based on our work are presented and reviewed. Despite substantial progress, the stability of research support and the market for commercial solar thermal collectors were such that the project could not be continued. A cooperative path involving university, government, and industrial collaboration remains the most attractive near term option for developing a commercial ICPC.\n\nEngineering development studies for integrated evacuated CPC arrays\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWinston, R.\n\n1982-04-01\n\nAn evacuated tube concentrator which achieves respectable high temperature performance (100 C to 300 C) was developed. The design concept utilizes nonimaging CPC type concentration integrated into each tube by shaping the outer glass vacuum envelope. The detailed design, prototype fabrication and preliminary test measurements are reviewed. In addition the results of this first study specifically devoted to engineering development questions related to practical applications of this collector concept are summarized. Questions having to do with the deployment of medium to large area arrays, optimizations of the manifolding of individual tube panels, selected near term applications (with an emphasis on residential cooling based on Rankine driven chillers) and long term performance projections are addressed.\n\nCPC_ACEENA\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFan, Mei; Pekour, Mikhail\n\nThe condensation particle counter (CPC 3772 or 3010, TSI) measures the number concentration of aerosols from 10 nm to 3 microns. On the G1, it was operated using an external pump and maintained at 1 LPM using a critical orifice. CPC_CVI was installed after CVI inlet, and CVI inlet was operated between two modes: under-kinetic mode and CVI mode. CPC_Isok (3772) and CPC3025 were installed after iso-kinetic inlet and CPC_TD was after the thermal denuder (TD). The infomation about the TD can be found from FIMS dataset.\n\nSkylight: a hollow prismatic CPC\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFernandez-Balbuena, Antonio Alvarez; VÃ¡zquez-MolinÃ­, Daniel; Garcia-Fernandez, Berta; Garcia-Botella, Angel; Bernabeu, Eusebio\n\n2009-08-01\n\nMany applications involve the use of a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) like, natural lighting, thermal applications, optics for illuminators, optical fibre coupling and solar energy. The use of a CPC in reverse mode for natural lighting gives the chance to use it as a lighting skylight in ceilings because light output is controlled inside the design angle, on the contrary having a low flux transfer ratio because of the reduced area of the entrance pupil regarding exit pupil. The authors propose an innovative 3D hollow prismatic CPC (HPCPC) made of a dielectric material, which has a high efficiency comparing it with aluminium CPC. The basic idea is to use a hollow prismatic light guide with CPC shape. This paper reports 2D, 3D design and numerical analysis by raytracing software, also experimental results are shown. The system works almost like a true CPC when light enters through standard entrance pupil and also collect light that enters outside entrance pupil. Performance and efficiency of the prismatic CPC is in average 300% higher than standard aluminium CPC for collimated light in a range from 0ÃÂº to 85ÃÂº. A prototype has been developed and tested.\n\nBehavioral Health and the Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) Initiative: findings from the 2014 CPC behavioral health survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nZivin, Kara; Miller, Benjamin F; Finke, Bruce; Bitton, Asaf; Payne, Perry; Stowe, Edith C; Reddy, Ashok; Day, Timothy J; Lapin, Pauline; Jin, Janel L; Sessums, Laura L\n\n2017-08-29\n\nIncorporating behavioral health care into patient centered medical homes is critical for improving patient health and care quality while reducing costs. Despite documented effectiveness of behavioral health integration (BHI) in primary care settings, implementation is limited outside of large health systems. We conducted a survey of BHI in primary care practices participating in the Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) initiative, a four-year multi-payer initiative of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). We sought to explore associations between practice characteristics and the extent of BHI to illuminate possible factors influencing successful implementation. We fielded a survey that addressed six substantive domains (integrated space, training, access, communication and coordination, treatment planning, and available resources) and five behavioral health conditions (depression, anxiety, pain, alcohol use disorder, and cognitive function). Descriptive statistics compared BHI survey respondents to all CPC practices, documented the availability of behavioral health providers, and primary care and behavioral health provider communication. Bivariate relationships compared provider and practice characteristics and domain scores. One hundred sixty-one of 188 eligible primary care practices completed the survey (86% response rate). Scores indicated basic to good baseline implementation of BHI in all domains, with lowest scores on communication and coordination and highest scores for depression. Higher scores were associated with: having any behavioral health provider, multispecialty practice, patient-centered medical home designation, and having any communication between behavioral health and primary care providers. This study provides useful data on opportunities and challenges of scaling BHI integration linked to primary care transformation. Payment reform models such as CPC can assist in BHI promotion and development.\n\nThe performance of solar collector CPC (compound parabolic concentrator) type with three pipes covered by glass tubes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGaos, Yogi Sirodz; Yulianto, Muhamad; Juarsa, Mulya; Nurrohman, Marzuki, Edi; Yuliaji, Dwi; Budiono, Kabul\n\n2017-03-01\n\nIndonesia is a tropical country that has potential energy of solar radiation worth of 4.5 until 4.8 kWh/m2. However, this potential has not been utilized regularly. This paper will discuss the performance of solar collector compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) type with water as the working fluid. This CPC solar collector utilized three pipes covered by glass tubes. This paper has contribution to provide the temperature achievement between three pipes covered by glass tubes with and without glass cover of solar collector CPC type. The research conducted by varying the water flow rate of 1 l/m up to 6 l/m with three pipes arranged in series and parallel. From the results, the used of solar collector CPC type in the current study shows that the decrease of solar radiation, which was caused by climate change, did not influence the heat absorbance by water in the pipe. Therefore, the design of the solar collector in this research has potential to be used in future when solar radiation are used as the energy source.\n\nOutdoor Performance Analysis of a Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) Collector with Jet Impingement and Compound Parabolic Concentrator (CPC).\n\nPubMed\n\nJaaz, Ahed Hameed; Hasan, Husam Abdulrasool; Sopian, Kamaruzzaman; Kadhum, Abdul Amir H; Gaaz, Tayser Sumer; Al-Amiery, Ahmed A\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThis paper discusses the effect of jet impingement of water on a photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collector and compound parabolic concentrators (CPC) on electrical efficiency, thermal efficiency and power production of a PVT system. A prototype of a PVT solar water collector installed with a jet impingement and CPC has been designed, fabricated and experimentally investigated. The efficiency of the system can be improved by using jet impingement of water to decrease the temperature of the solar cells. The electrical efficiency and power output are directly correlated with the mass flow rate. The results show that electrical efficiency was improved by 7% when using CPC and jet impingement cooling in a PVT solar collector at 1:00 p.m. (solar irradiance of 1050 W/mÂ² and an ambient temperature of 33.5 Â°C). It can also be seen that the power output improved by 36% when using jet impingement cooling with CPC, and 20% without CPC in the photovoltaic (PV) module at 1:30 p.m. The short-circuit current I SC of the PV module experienced an improvement of ~28% when using jet impingement cooling with CPC, and 11.7% without CPC. The output of the PV module was enhanced by 31% when using jet impingement cooling with CPC, and 16% without CPC.\n\nOutdoor Performance Analysis of a Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) Collector with Jet Impingement and Compound Parabolic Concentrator (CPC)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJaaz, Ahed Hameed; Hasan, Husam Abdulrasool; Sopian, Kamaruzzaman; Kadhum, Abdul Amir H.; Gaaz, Tayser Sumer\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper discusses the effect of jet impingement of water on a photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collector and compound parabolic concentrators (CPC) on electrical efficiency, thermal efficiency and power production of a PVT system.

The program involved a series of interrelated tasks. Past studies of the impact of crystalline silicotitanate (CST) and monosodium titanate (MST) on DWPF were reviewed. Paper studies and material balance calculations were used to establish reasonable bounding levels of CST and MST in sludge. Following the paper studies, Sludge Batch 10 (SB10) simulant was modified to have both bounding and intermediate levels of MST and ground CST. The SCIX flow sheetmoreÂ Â» includes grinding of the CST which is larger than DWPF frit when not ground. Nominal ground CST was not yet available, therefore a similar CST ground previously in Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was used. It was believed that this CST was over ground and that it would bound the impact of nominal CST on sludge slurry properties. Lab-scale simulations of the DWPF CPC were conducted using SB10 simulants with no, intermediate, and bounding levels of CST and MST. Tests included both the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) cycles. Simulations were performed at high and low acid stoichiometry. A demonstration of the extended CPC flowsheet was made that included streams from the site interim salt processing operations. A simulation using irradiated CST and MST was also completed. An extensive set of rheological measurements was made to search for potential adverse consequences of CST and MST and slurry rheology in the CPC. The SCIX CPC impact program was conducted in parallel with a program to evaluate the impact of SCIX on the final DWPF glass waste form and on the DWPF melter throughput. The studies must be considered together when evaluating the full impact of SCIX on DWPF. Due to the fact that the alternant flowsheet for DWPF has not been selected, this study did\n\n[Reversed clinicopathological conference (R-CPC)--interpreting laboratory data in the same way as physical findings].\n\nPubMed\n\nSugano, Mitsutoshi; Shimada, Masashi; Moriyoshi, Miho; Kitagawa, Kiyoki; Nakashima, Hiromi; Wada, Hideo; Yanagihara, Katsunori; Fujisawa, Shinya; Yonekawa, Osamu; Honda, Takayuki\n\n2012-05-01\n\nRoutine laboratory data are discussed by time series analysis in reversed clinicopathological conferences (R-CPC) at Shinshu University School of Medicine. We can identify fine changes in the laboratory data and the importance of negative data (without any changes) using time series analysis. Routine laboratory tests can be performed repeatedly and relatively cheaply, and time series analysis can be performed. The examination process of routine laboratory data in the R-CPC is almost the same as the process of taking physical findings. Firstly, general findings are checked and then the state of each organ is examined. Although routine laboratory data are cheap, we can obtain much more information about a patient's state than from physical examinations. In this R-CPC, several specialists in the various fields of laboratory medicine discussed the routine laboratory data of a patient, and we tried to understand the detailed state of the patient. R-CPC is an educational method to examine laboratory data and we, reconfirmed the usefulness of R-CPC to elucidate the clinical state of the patient.\n\nContinuous professional competence (CPC) for emergency medical technicians in Ireland: educational needs assessment\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground As in other countries, the Irish Regulator for Pre-Hospital practitioners, the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC), will introduce a Continuous Professional Competence (CPC) framework for all Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), Paramedics and Advanced Paramedics (APs). This framework involves EMTs participating in regular and structured training to maintain professional competence and enable continuous professional developments. To inform the development of this framework, this study aimed to identify what EMTs consider the optimum educational outcomes and activity and their attitude towards CPC. Methods All EMTs registered in Ireland (nâ=â925) were invited via email to complete an anonymous online survey. Survey questions were designed based on Continuous Professional Development (CPD) questionnaires used by other healthcare professions. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. Results Response rate was 43% (nâ=â399). 84% of participants had been registered in Ireland for less than 24Â months, while 59% had been registered EMTs for more than one year. Outcomes were: evidence of CPC should be a condition for EMT registration in Ireland (95%), 78% believed that EMTs who do not maintain CPC should be denied the option to re-register. Although not required to do so at the time of survey, 69% maintained a professional portfolio and 24% had completed up to 20Â hours of CPC activities in the prior 12Â months. From a list of 22 proposed CPC activities, 97% stated that practical scenario-based exercises were most relevant to their role. E-learning curricula without practical components were considered irrelevant (32%), but the majority of participants (91%) welcomed access to e-learning when supplemented by related practical modules. Conclusion EMTs are supportive of CPC as a key part of their professional development and registration. Blended learning, which involves clinical and practical skills and e-learning, is the optimum\n\nArmy Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPC) Program for Facilities and Infrastructure\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2010-02-01\n\nFY2009 - 2011 â¢ Benefits: Reduced corrosion due to elimination of metallic rebar , reduced weight equates to reduced dead load and increased dynamic...Decks as Replacement for Steel Reinforced Concrete Decks F09AR04: Corrosion Resistant Roofs with Integrated Sustainable PV Power Systems â¢ Where...Army Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPC) Program for Facilities and Infrastructure Dr. Craig E.

P.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nA method for applying the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) to Chopped Photometric Channel (CPC) IRAS additional observations is illustrated. The original CPC data suffered from problems with repeatability which MEM is able to cope with by use of a noise image, produced from the results of separate data scans of objects. The process produces images of small areas of sky with circular Gaussian beams of approximately 30 in. full width half maximum resolution at 50 and 100 microns. Comparison is made to previous reconstructions made in the far-infrared as well as morphologies of objects at other wavelengths.

(ADI; Berkeley, USA) versatile water condensation particle counter (vWCPC), TSI 3777 nano enhancer (TSI Inc., Shoreview, USA) and modified and boosted TSI 3010-type CPC from UniversitÃ© Blaise Pascal called a B3010. The performance of all CPCs was first measured with charged tungsten oxide test particles at temperature settings which resulted in supersaturation low enough to not detect any ions produced by a radioactive source. Due to similar measured detection efficiencies, additional comparison between the 3777 and vWCPC were conducted using electrically neutral tungsten oxide test particles and with positively charged tetradodecylammonium bromide. Furthermore, the detection efficiencies of the 3777 and vWCPC were measured with boosted temperature settings yielding supersaturation which was at the onset of homogeneous nucleation for the 3777 or confined within the range of liquid water for the ADI vWCPC. Finally, CPC-specific tests were conducted to probe the response of the 3777 to various inlet flow relative humidities, of the B3010 to various inlet flow rates and of the vWCPC to various particle concentrations. For the 3777 and vWCPC the measured 50 % detection diameters (d50s) were in the range of 1.3-2.4 nm for the tungsten oxide particles, depending on the particle charging state and CPC temperature settings, between 2.5 and 3.3 nm for the organic test aerosol, and in the range of 3.2-3.4 nm for tungsten oxide for the B3010.\n\nEfficacy of the biomaterials 3wt%-nanostrontium-hydroxyapatite-enhanced calcium phosphate cement (nanoSr-CPC) and nanoSr-CPC-incorporated simvastatin-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic-acid) microspheres in osteogenesis improvement: An explorative multi-phase experimental in vitro/vivo study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMasaeli, Reza; Jafarzadeh Kashi, Tahereh Sadat; Dinarvand, Rassoul; Rakhshan, Vahid; Shahoon, Hossein; Hooshmand, Behzad; Mashhadi Abbas, Fatemeh; Raz, Majid; Rajabnejad, Alireza; Eslami, Hossein; Khoshroo, Kimia; Tahriri, Mohammadreza; Tayebi, Lobat\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe purpose of this multi-phase explorative in vivo animal/surgical and in vitro multi-test experimental study was to (1) create a 3wt%-nanostrontium hydroxyapatite-enhanced calcium phosphate cement (Sr-HA/CPC) for increasing bone formation and (2) creating a simvastatin-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (SIM-loaded PLGA) microspheres plus CPC composite (SIM-loaded PLGA+nanostrontium-CPC). The third goal was the extensive assessment of multiple in vitro and in vivo characteristics of the above experimental explorative products in vitro and in vivo (animal and surgical studies). Physical and chemical properties of the prepared Sr-HA/CPC were evaluated. MTT assay and alkaline phosphatase activities, and radiological and histological examinations of Sr-HA/CPC, CPC and negative control were compared. X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that crystallinity of the prepared cement increased by increasing the powder-to-liquid ratio. Incorporation of Sr-HA into CPC increased MTT assay (biocompatibility) and ALP activity (P<0.05). Histomorphometry showed greater bone formation after 4weeks, after implantation of Sr-HA/CPC in 10 rats compared to implantations of CPC or empty defects in the same rats (n=30, ANOVA P<0.05). METHODS AND RESULTS PERTAINING TO SIM-LOADED PLGA MICROSPHERES+NANOSTRONTIUM-CPC COMPOSITE: After SEM assessment, the produced composite of microspheres and enhanced CPC were implanted for 8weeks in 10 rabbits, along with positive and negative controls, enhanced CPC, and enhanced CPC plus SIM (n=50). In the control group, only a small amount of bone had been regenerated (localized at the boundary of the defect); whereas, other groups showed new bone formation within and around the materials. A significant difference was found in the osteogenesis induced by the groups sham control (16.96Â±1.01), bone materials (32.28Â±4.03), nanostrontium-CPC (24.84Â±2.6), nanostrontium-CPC-simvastatin (40.12Â±3.29), and SIM-loaded PLGA+nanostrontium-CPC (44.8Â±6.45) (ANOVA P\n\nMeasuring Psychological Capital: Construction and Validation of the Compound PsyCap Scale (CPC-12)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLorenz, Timo; Beer, Clemens; PÃ¼tz, Jan; Heinitz, Kathrin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWith the Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ) being the standard measure to assess psychological capital (PsyCap) in the context of organizations, this paper aims to broaden this domain-specific approach by introducing a measure with universal claim. Two studies were conducted to create and validate a German self-report scale (CPC-12) measuring PsyCap. We performed confirmatory factor analyses and correlations with other positive psychological constructs on the data of two German samples (N1 = 321; N2 = 202). The twelve-item CPC-12 exhibits the anticipated factorial structure with a very good model fit and associations to other constructs concur with previous findings with other measures of PsyCap.

L.; Plamann, M.; Kruger, D.; Barthelmess, I. B.; Yanofsky, C.; Perkins, D. D.\n\n1990-01-01\n\ncpc-1 is the locus specifying what is believed to be the major trans-activating transcription factor that regulates expression of amino acid biosynthetic genes subject to cross-pathway control in Neurospora crassa. Mutants altered at this locus are incapable of the global increase in gene expression normally seen in response to amino acid starvation. Using polymerase chain reaction methodology we have cloned and sequenced the inactive mutant allele, cpc-1 (CD15). The cpc-1 (CD15) mutation was found to be a single base pair deletion in codon 93 of the cpc-1 structural gene. A second, presumed lethal, allele, cpc-1 (j-5), also was investigated. Northern analyses with strains carrying the cpc-1 (j-5) allele revealed that no cpc-1 mRNA is produced. Southern and genetic analyses established that the cpc-1 (j-5) mutation involved a chromosomal rearrangement in which a break occurred within the cpc-1 locus, normally resident on linkage group VI; a small fragment from the left arm of linkage group VI, containing the cpc-1 promoter region and ylo-1, was translocated to the right arm of linkage group I. Other studies indicate that the cpc-1 locus itself is not essential for viability. Lethality previously attributed to the cpc-1 (j-5) mutation is due instead to the production of progeny that are deficient for essential genes in an adjoining segment of linkage group VI. Molecular characterization of cpc-1 (j-5) X ylo-1 pan-2 duplication progeny indicated that cpc-1 is normally transcribed towards the linkage group VI centromere.

A GÎ²-like protein called Gib2 has been shown to function as an atypical GÎ² in Gpa1-cAMP signaling in Cryptococcus neoformans. We found that the previously reported CpcB (cross pathway control B) protein is the ortholog of Gib2 in Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus. In this report, we further characterize the roles of CpcB in governing growth, development and toxigenesis in the two aspergilli. The deletion of cpcB results in severely impaired cellular growth, delayed spore germination, and defective asexual sporulation (conidiation) in both aspergilli. Moreover, CpcB is necessary for proper expression of the key developmental activator brlA during initiation and progression of conidiation in A. nidulans and A. fumigatus. Somewhat in accordance with the previous study, the absence of cpcB results in the formation of fewer, but not micro-, cleistothecia in A. nidulans in the presence of wild type veA, an essential activator of sexual development. However, the cpcB deletion mutant cleistothecia contain no ascospores, validating that CpcB is required for progression and completion of sexual fruiting including ascosporogenesis. Furthermore, unlike the canonical GÎ²SfaD, CpcB is not needed for the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin sterigmatocystin (ST) as the cpcB null mutant produced reduced amount of ST with unaltered STC gene expression. However, in A. fumigatus, the deletion of cpcB results in the blockage of gliotoxin (GT) production. Further genetic analyses in A. nidulans indicate that CpcB may play a central role in vegetative growth, which might be independent of FadA- and GanB-mediated signaling. A speculative model summarizing the roles of CpcB in conjunction with SfaD in A. nidulans is presented.

C.; Zamecnik, J. R.\n\n2013-06-25\n\nThe Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) accepted a technical task request (TTR) from Waste Solidification Engineering to perform simulant tests to support the qualification of Sludge Batch 8 (SB8) and to develop the flowsheet for SB8 in the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). These efforts pertained to the DWPF Chemical Process Cell (CPC). Separate studies were conducted for frit development and glass properties (including REDOX). The SRNL CPC effort had two primary phases divided by the decision to drop Tank 12 from the SB8 constituents. This report focuses on the second phase with SB8 compositions that do not contain themoreÂ Â» Tank 12 piece. A separate report will document the initial phase of SB8 testing that included Tank 12. The second phase of SB8 studies consisted of two sets of CPC studies. The first study involved CPC testing of an SB8 simulant for Tank 51 to support the CPC demonstration of the washed Tank 51 qualification sample in the SRNL Shielded Cells facility. SB8-Tank 51 was a high iron-low aluminum waste with fairly high mercury and moderate noble metal concentrations. Tank 51 was ultimately washed to about 1.5 M sodium which is the highest wash endpoint since SB3-Tank 51. This study included three simulations of the DWPF Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) cycle and Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) cycle with the sludge-only flowsheet at nominal DWPF processing conditions and three different acid stoichiometries. These runs produced a set of recommendations that were used to guide the successful SRNL qualification SRAT/SME demonstration with actual Tank 51 washed waste. The second study involved five SRAT/SME runs with SB8-Tank 40 simulant. Four of the runs were designed to define the acid requirements for sludge-only processing in DWPF with respect to nitrite destruction and hydrogen generation. The fifth run was an intermediate acid stoichiometry demonstration of the coupled flowsheet for SB8. These runs produced a set of\n\nDissatisfaction of Compact Picard Condition (CPC) with GRACE satellite data and its treatment by Generalized Tikhonov in Sobolev subspace\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAllahTavakoli, Y.; Bagheri, H.; Safari, A.; Sharifi, M.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThis paper is mainly aiming to prove that the stripy noises in the map of earth's surface mass-density changes derived from GRACE Satellites gravimetry, is due to a dissatisfaction of Compact Picard Condition (CPC) with the GRACE data in the inversion of the Newton Integral Equation over the thin layer of earth; and hence the paper proposes the regularization strategies as efficient tools to treat the Ill-posedness and consequently to de-strip the data. First of all, we preferred to slightly modify the mathematical model of earth's surface mass-density changes developed creatively first by J. Wahr and et.al (1998), according to the all their previous assumptions plus taking into consideration the effect of the earth topography. By the modification we expect that some uncertainties in the prior model have been reduced to some extent. Then we analyzed the CPC on the model and we demonstrated how to perform Generalized Tikhonov regularization in Sobolev subspace for overcoming the instability of the problem. Then we applied the strategy in some simulations and case studies to validate our ideas. The simulations confirm that the stripy noises in the GRACE-derived map of the mass-density changes are due to the CPC dissatisfaction and furthermore the case studies show that Generalized Tikhonov regularization in Sobolev subspace is an influential filtering tool to de-strip the noisy data. Also, the case studies interestingly show that the effect of the topography is comparable to the effect of the load Love numbers on the Wahr's model; hence it may be taken into consideration when the load Love numbers have been taken into account.\n\nTD-60 links RalA GTPase function to the CPC in mitosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPapini, Diana; Langemeyer, Lars; Abad, Maria A.; Kerr, Alastair; Samejima, Itaru; Eyers, Patrick A.; Jeyaprakash, A. Arockia; Higgins, Jonathan M. G.; Barr, Francis A.; Earnshaw, William C.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTD-60 (also known as RCC2) is a highly conserved protein that structurally resembles the Ran guanine exchange factor (GEF) RCC1, but has not previously been shown to have GEF activity. TD-60 has a typical chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) distribution in mitotic cells, but associates with integrin complexes and is involved in cell motility during interphase. Here we show that TD-60 exhibits GEF activity, in vitro and in cells, for the small GTPase RalA. TD-60 or RalA depletion causes spindle abnormalities in prometaphase associated with abnormal centromeric accumulation of CPC components. TD-60 and RalA apparently work together to contribute to the regulation of kinetochoreâmicrotubule interactions in early mitosis. Importantly, several mitotic phenotypes caused by TD-60 depletion are reverted by the expression of a GTP-locked mutant, RalA (Q72L). The demonstration that a small GTPase participates in the regulation of the CPC reveals a level of mitotic regulation not suspected in previous studies.

In this study, we explored and characterized U(VI) reduction by strain 2CP-C. Cell suspensions of fumarate-grown 2CP-C cells reduced U(VI) to U(IV). More-detailed growth studies demonstrated that hydrogen was the required electron donor for U(VI) reduction and could not be replaced by acetate. The addition of nitrate to U(VI)-reducing cultures resulted in a transitory increase in U(VI) concentration, apparently caused by the reoxidation of reduced U(IV), but U(VI) reduction resumed following the consumption of N-oxyanions. Inhibition of U(VI) reduction occurred in cultures amended with Fe(III) citrate, or citrate. In the presence of amorphous Fe(III) oxide, U(VI) reduction proceeded to completion but the U(VI) reduction rates decreased threefold compared to control cultures. Fumarate and 2-chlorophenol had no inhibitory effects on U(VI) reduction, and both electron acceptors were consumed concomitantly with U(VI). Since cocontaminants (e.g., nitrate, halogenated compounds) and bioavailable ferric iron are often encountered at uranium-impacted sites, the metabolic versatility makes Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans a promising model organism for studying the complex interaction of multiple electron acceptors in U(VI) reduction and immobilization.

There are six additional CPC-like MYB sequences in the Arabidopsis genome, including TRYPTICHON (TRY), ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC1 and 2 (ETC1 and ETC2), ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC3/CPC-LIKE MYB3 (ETC3/CPL3), and TRICHOMELESS1 and 2 (TCL1 and TCL2). We independently identified CPC-LIKE MYB4 (CPL4), which was found to be identical to TCL2. RT-PCR analysis showed that CPL4 is strongly expressed in shoots, including true leaves, but not in roots. Promoter-GUS analyses indicated that CPL4 is specifically expressed in leaf blades. Although CPC expression was repressed in 35S::ETC1, 35S::ETC2 and 35S::CPL3 backgrounds, CPL4 expression was not affected by ETC1, ETC2 or CPL3 over-expression. Notably, several chimeric transcripts may result from inter-genic alternative splicing of CPL4 and ETC2, two tandemly repeated genes on chromosome II. At least two chimeric transcripts named CPL4-Î± and CPL4-Î² are expected to encode complete CPC-like MYB proteins.

As patent databases maintained by them went online for free access to public as also for global search of prior art by examiners, the need arose for a common platform and uniform structure of patent databases. The diversity of different classification, however, posed problems of integrating and searching relevant patents across patent jurisdictions. To address this problem of comparability of data from different sources and searching patents, WIPO in the recent past developed what is known as International Patent Classification (IPC) system which most countries readily adopted to code their patents with IPC codes along with their own codes. The Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) is the latest patent classification system based on IPC/European Classification (ECLA) system, developed by the European Patent Office (EPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) which is likely to become a global standard. This paper discusses this new classification system with reference to patents on bioremediation.\n\nResolution of singularities for multi-loop integrals\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBogner, Christian; Weinzierl, Stefan\n\n2008-04-01\n\nWe report on a program for the numerical evaluation of divergent multi-loop integrals.

The results from in vitro cell experiments and in vivo implantation in femoral defects manifested that incorporation of PRP into PLGA/CPC scaffold improved in vitro cell response (cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation), and markedly boosted bone formation, angiogenesis and material degradation. The incorporation of PRP into scaffold showed more outstanding improvement in osteogenesis as the scaffolds were used to repair the segmental radial defects, especially at the early stage. The new bone tissues grew along the unidirectional lamellar pores of scaffold. At 12 weeks postimplantation, the segmental radial defects treated with PRP-PLGA/CPC scaffold had almost recuperated, whereas treated with the scaffold without PRP was far from healed. Taken together, the PRP-PLGA/CPC scaffold with unidirectional pore structure is a promising candidate to repair bone defects at various sites.

Among them, Î± subunit of C8 (C8Î±) is the first protein that traverses the lipid bilayer, and then initiates the recruitment of C9 molecules to form pore on target membranes. In this article, a full-length cDNA of C8Î± (CpC8Î±) is identified from the whitespotted bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium plagiosum) by RACE. The CpC8Î± cDNA is 2183 bp in length, encoding a protein of 591 amino acids. The deduced CpC8Î± exhibits 89%, 49% and 44% identity with nurse shark, frog and human orthologs, respectively. Sequence alignment indicates that the C8Î± is well conserved during the evolution process from sharks to mammals, with the same modular architecture as well as the identical cysteine composition in the mature protein. Phylogenetic analysis places CpC8Î± and nurse shark C8Î± in cartilaginous fish clade, in parallel with the teleost taxa, to form the C8Î± cluster with higher vertebrates. Hydrophobicity analysis also indicates a similar hydrophobicity of CpC8Î± to mammals. Finally, expression analysis revealed CpC8Î± transcripts were constitutively highly expressed in shark liver, with much less expression in other tissues. The well conserved structure and properties suggests an analogous function of CpC8Î± to mammalian C8Î±, though it remains to be confirmed by further study. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary focusing concentrator can be a parabolic reflector, an array of Fresnel mirrors, a Fresnel lens or some other lens. Silicon solar cell grid structures are proposed that increase efficiency with concentration up to 10 suns. A ray tracing program has been developed to determine energy distribution at the exit of a compound parabolic concentrator. Projected total cost of a CPC/solar cell system will be between 4 and 5 times lower than for flat plate silicon cell arrays.\n\nDesign of solar adsorption refrigeration system with CPC and study on the heat and mass transfer performance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDu, W. P.; Li, M.; Wang, Y. F.; He, J. H.; He, J. X.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nTo overcome the problem that the heat source temperature is limited and the lower part of the adsorption tube cannot effectively absorb the solar radiation when solar radiation as the heat source of the adsorption refrigeration system. From the perspective of enhancing the adsorption refrigeration unit tube to absorb solar radiation, thereby strengthening the heat transfer characteristic of adsorption bed, which can improve the efficiency of the refrigeration unit refrigerating capacity and system refrigeration efficiency. Solar adsorption refrigeration system based on CPC was designed and constructed in this paper. The heat and mass transfer performance of the adsorption refrigeration system were studied. The experimental results show that the temperature of the adsorption bed with parabolic concentrating structure can rise to 100Â°C under low irradiation condition. When the irradiation intensity is 600 w/m2 and 400 w/m2, the average temperature rising to desorption temperature reaches 0.67Â°C and 0.50Â°C, respectively. It can effectively solve the problem that the conventional adsorption bed is difficult to reach the required desorption temperature due to the low power density of the sunlight. In the experiment, the system COP were 0.166 and 0.143 when the system in the irradiance of 600 w/m2 and 400 w/m2.\n\nA mathematical procedure to predict optical performance of CPCs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYu, Y. M.; Yu, M. J.; Tang, R. S.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nTo evaluate the optical performance of a CPC based concentrating photovoltaic system, it is essential to find the angular dependence of optical efficiency of compound parabolic concentrator (CPC-Î¸e ) where the incident angle of solar rays on solar cells is restricted within Î¸e for the radiation over its acceptance angle. In this work, a mathematical procedure was developed to calculate the optical efficiency of CPC-Î¸e for radiation incident at any angle based radiation transfer within CPC-Î¸e . Calculations show that, given the acceptance half-angle (Î¸a ), the annual radiation of full CPC-Î¸e increases with the increase of Î¸e and the CPC without restriction of exit angle (CPC-90) annually collects the most radiation due to large geometry (Ct ); whereas for truncated CPCs with identical Î¸a and Ct , the annual radiation collected by CPC-Î¸e is almost identical to that by CPC-90, even slightly higher. Calculations also indicate that the annual radiation on the absorber of CPC-Î¸e at the angle larger than Î¸e decrease with the increase of Î¸e but always less than that of CPC-90, and this implies that the CPC-Î¸e based PV system is more efficient than CPC-90 based PV system because the radiation on solar cells incident at large angle is poorly converted into electricity.\n\nIn vitro CPC retention and VSC adsorption by IPM oil droplets: possible mechanisms of action of a two phase mouthwash.\n\nPubMed\n\nSterer, N; Slutzky, H; Kohavi, D; Matalon, S\n\n2013-09-01\n\nTwo phase oil-water mouthwash has been previously shown to efficiently bind oral microorganisms, relying on their cell surface hydrophobicity. The aim of the present in vitro study was to test the cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) retention and volatile sulfide compounds (VSCs) adsorption abilities of the oil droplets created by mixing of a two phase oil-water solution. VSC adsorption was assayed using a salivary incubation assay and garlic powder solutions, and demonstrated using microscopic sulfide assay. CPC retention was assayed by kinetic and endpoint measurement of Streptococcus salivarius outgrowth using microplate (ELISA) reader. Results showed that the isopropyl myristate (IPM) oil droplets in the two phase solutions were able to adsorb 68-80% of VSCs. CPC at a concentration of 0.05% was most affectively retained by the oil droplets showing a significantly increase in residual antibacterial activity against Streptococcus salivarius. These results taken together, suggests that VSC adsorption and CPC retention by IPM oil droplets may be two additional mechanisms in the activity of the two phase mouthwash formulation.\n\nReduze - Feynman integral reduction in C++\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStuderus, C.\n\n2010-07-01\n\nReduze is a computer program for reducing Feynman integrals to master integrals employing a Laporta algorithm.

Using 312 sputa, we evaluated the performance of the two reagents using culture on LÃ¶wenstein-Jensen medium after sputum storage in CPC or OMNI for up to 28âdays. In addition, the viability of M. tuberculosis isolates stored in both reagents was assessed. The contamination rates for freshly processed samples and those stored in CPC were not statistically different, while the contamination rate for OMNI was significantly lower than that for fresh sputa (P=0.026 for 8âdays and P=0.002 for 28âdays of storage). The culture positivity for fresh sputa (81.7â%) was similar to that for samples stored in CPC, regardless of the storage time (89.8â% for CPC-8 and 73.0â% for CPC-28). For OMNI-preserved samples, the culture positivity was similar after 8âdays of storage (84.2â%), but decreased significantly after 28âdays (42.7â%; P<0.0001) compared to fresh sputa, CPC-8, CPC-28 and OMNI-8. There was a significant loss of viability for the H37Rv strain when it was stored in OMNI at room temperature beyond 8âdays compared to CPC, but storage at 37âÂ°C decreased recovery from both CPC- and OMNI-stored suspensions. Culture from sputum stored for 8âdays at room temperature in OMNI or CPC gave comparable culture positivity rates to culture from fresh sputum, but after 28âdays of storage the performance of OMNI decreased significantly compared to CPC.\n\nCascade and parallel combination (CPC) of adaptive filters for estimating heart rate during intensive physical exercise from photoplethysmographic signal\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIslam, Mohammad Tariqul; Tanvir Ahmed, Sk.; Zabir, Ishmam; Shahnaz, Celia\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPhotoplethysmographic (PPG) signal is getting popularity for monitoring heart rate in wearable devices because of simplicity of construction and low cost of the sensor. The task becomes very difficult due to the presence of various motion artefacts. In this study, an algorithm based on cascade and parallel combination (CPC) of adaptive filters is proposed in order to reduce the effect of motion artefacts. First, preliminary noise reduction is performed by averaging two channel PPG signals. Next in order to reduce the effect of motion artefacts, a cascaded filter structure consisting of three cascaded adaptive filter blocks is developed where three-channel accelerometer signals are used as references to motion artefacts. To further reduce the affect of noise, a scheme based on convex combination of two such cascaded adaptive noise cancelers is introduced, where two widely used adaptive filters namely recursive least squares and least mean squares filters are employed. Heart rates are estimated from the noise reduced PPG signal in spectral domain. Finally, an efficient heart rate tracking algorithm is designed based on the nature of the heart rate variability. The performance of the proposed CPC method is tested on a widely used public database. It is found that the proposed method offers very low estimation error and a smooth heart rate tracking with simple algorithmic approach.

This technique was coupled with counter-current chromatography (CCC) and centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) and then applied to the continuous extraction and online isolation of chemical constituents from Paeonia lactiflora Pall (white peony) roots. The mechanical parameters, including the pitch and diameter of the shaft, were optimized by means of mathematical modeling. Furthermore, the configuration and mechanism of online UADE coupled with CCC and CPC were elaborated. The stationary phases of the two-phase solvent systems from CCC and CPC were utilized as the UADE solution. The extraction solution was pumped into the sample loop and then introduced into the CCC column; the target compounds were eluted with the lower aqueous phase of the two-phase solvent system. During the CCC separation, the extraction solution was continuously fed in the sample loop by turning the ten-port valve; the extraction solution was then pumped into the CPC column and eluted by the mobile phase of the two-phase solvent system mentioned above. When the first cycle of the UADE/CCC/CPC was completed, the second cycle experiment could be carried out, and so on. Four target compounds (albiflorin, benzoylpaeoniflorin, paeoniflorin, and galloylpaeoniflorin) with purities above 94.96% were successfully extracted and isolated online using the two-phase solvent system comprising ethyl acetate-n-butanol-ethanol-water (1:3.5:2:4.5, v/v/v/v). Compared with conventional extraction methods, the instrumental setup of the present method offers the advantages of automation and systematic extraction and isolation of natural products.

David; Ingham, William H.; Herman, Ralph D.\n\n2011-05-01\n\nPreviously, Pruett et al. (2003) [3] described an N-body integrator of arbitrarily high order M with an asymptotic operation count of O(MN). The algorithm's structure lends itself readily to data parallelization, which we document and demonstrate here in the integration of point-mass systems subject to Newtonian gravitation. High order is shown to benefit parallel efficiency. The resulting N-body integrator is robust, parameter-free, highly accurate, and adaptive in both time-step and order. Moreover, it exhibits linear speedup on distributed parallel processors, provided that each processor is assigned at least a handful of bodies.

However, this process is limited by the small volume treated and there is no indication of treatment efficacy for the user. Low cost glass tube reactors, together with compound parabolic collector (CPC) technology, have been shown to significantly increase the efficiency of solar disinfection. However, these reactors still require user input to control each batch SODIS process and there is no feedback that the process is complete. Automatic operation of the batch SODIS process, controlled by UVA-radiation sensors, can provide information on the status of the process, can ensure the required UVA dose to achieve complete disinfection is received and reduces user work-load through automatic sequential batch processing. In this work, an enhanced CPC photo-reactor with a concentration factor of 1.89 was developed. The apparatus was automated to achieve exposure to a pre-determined UVA dose. Treated water was automatically dispensed into a reservoir tank. The reactor was tested using Escherichia coli as a model pathogen in natural well water. A 6-log inactivation of E. coli was achieved following exposure to the minimum uninterrupted lethal UVA dose. The enhanced reactor decreased the exposure time required to achieve the lethal UVA dose, in comparison to a CPC system with a concentration factor of 1.0. Doubling the lethal UVA dose prevented the need for a period of post-exposure dark inactivation and reduced the overall treatment time. Using this reactor, SODIS can be automatically carried out at an affordable cost, with reduced exposure time and minimal user input. Copyright ÃÂ© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

M.; Rabl, A.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nAnalytic expressions are derived for the angular acceptance function of two-dimensional compound parabolic concentrator solar collectors (CPC's) of arbitrary degree of truncation. Taking into account the effect of truncation on both optical and thermal losses in real collectors, the increase in monthly and yearly collectible energy is also evaluated. Prior analyses that have ignored the correct behavior of the angular acceptance function at large angles for truncated collectors are shown to be in error by 0-2 percent in calculations of yearly collectible energy for stationary collectors.\n\nDecontamination of industrial cyanide-containing water in a solar CPC pilot plant\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDuran, A.; Monteagudo, J.M.; San Martin, I.\n\n2010-07-15\n\nThe aim of this work was to improve the quality of wastewater effluent coming from an Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) power station to meet with future environmental legislation. This study examined a homogeneous photocatalytic oxidation process using concentrated solar UV energy (UV/Fe(II)/H{sub 2}O{sub 2}) in a Solar Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) pilot plant. The efficiency of the process was evaluated by analysis of the oxidation of cyanides and Total Organic Carbon (TOC). A factorial experimental design allowed the determination of the influences of operating variables (initial concentration of H{sub 2}O{sub 2}, oxalic acid and Fe(II) and pH) on the degradationmoreÂ Â» kinetics. Temperature and UV-A solar power were also included in the Neural Network fittings. The pH was maintained at a value >9.5 during cyanide oxidation to avoid the formation of gaseous HCN and later lowered to enhance mineralization. Under the optimum conditions ([H{sub 2}O{sub 2}] = 2000 ppm, [Fe(II)] = 8 ppm, pH = 3.3 after cyanide oxidation, and [(COOH){sub 2}] = 60 ppm), it was possible to degrade 100% of the cyanides and up to 92% of Total Organic Carbon.

However, premature loss of primary teeth on account of dental caries still remains a common problem among children. The pulpotomy technique has been the choice for treating vital primary and young permanent teeth with carious, mechanical and traumatic pulp exposures. The ideal pulpotomy medicament should be bioinductive or at least biocompatible, bactericidal and harmless to the pulp and surrounding structures. It should also promote healing of the radicular pulp and prevent bacterial microleakage with the least interference in the physiological process of root resorption. Since the best criteria for judging the effectiveness of a medicament when used for vital pulp therapy is the response that it produces in the pulp. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the response of human pulp tissue to recently developed Indian material, Sree Chitra-Calcium Phosphate Cement (Chitra-CPC) and formocresol, used as pulpotomy agent in deciduous teeth. Chitra-CPC has been compared with formocresol, taking into account that formocresol is still considered the gold standard in primary tooth pulpotomy. The study was conducted among 10 children in the age group of 8 to 12 years focusing on 20 noncarious primary canines indicated for serial extraction. Each patient received two different pulpotomy proceduresâone in each of the primary canines using formocresol and the other with Chitra-CPC as pulpotomy agents. After 70 days, the teeth were extracted and subjected to histological examination. The results did not reveal statistically significant difference between the two groups. But Chitra-CPC gave more favorable results, in respect of pulpal inflammation, dentin bridge formation, quality of dentin bridge and connective tissue in dentin bridge.

The stationary nature of non-imaging optics collectors, commonly called compound parabolic concentrators (CPC's), present a unique design challenge when orienting them to collect sunlight. Many facilities throughout the world that adopt CPCs are not situated to orient the collectors in the ideal angle facing the sun. This East-West misalignment can adversely affect the optical and power performance of the CPC collector. To characterize how this misalignment effects CPCs, reverse raytracing simulations are conducted for varying offset angles of the collectors from solar South. Optical performance is analyzed for an ideal East-West oriented CPC with a 40-degree acceptance angle. Direction cosine plots are used to develop a ratio of annual solar collection by the CPC over the total annual solar input. From these simulations, average annual collector performance is given for offset angles ranging from 0 to 90 degrees for different Earth Latitudes in 10 degree increments.\n\nSolar CPC pilot plant photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A in waters and wastewaters using suspended and supported-TiO2. Influence of photogenerated species.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaggioro, Enrico Mendes; Oliveira, Anabela Sousa; Pavesi, Thelma; Tototzintle, Margarita JimÃ©nez; Maldonado, Manuel Ignacio; Correia, FÃ¡bio Verissimo; Moreira, Josino Costa\n\n2014-11-01\n\nPhotocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) in waters and wastewaters in the presence of titanium dioxide (TiO2) was performed under different conditions. Suspensions of the TiO2 were used to compare the degradation efficiency of BPA (20 mg L(-1)) in batch and compound parabolic collector (CPC) reactors. A TiO2 catalyst supported on glass spheres was prepared (sol-gel method) and used in a CPC solar pilot plant for the photodegradation of BPA (100 Î¼g L(-1)). The influence of OHÂ·, O2 (Â·-), and h (+) on the BPA degradation were evaluated. The radicals OHÂ· and O2 (Â·-) were proved to be the main species involved on BPA photodegradation. Total organic carbon (TOC) and carboxylic acids were determined to evaluate the BPA mineralization during the photodegradation process. Some toxicological effects of BPA and its photoproducts on Eisenia andrei earthworms were evaluated. The results show that the optimal concentration of suspended TiO2 to degrade BPA in batch or CPC reactors was 0.1 g L(-1). According to biological tests, the BPA LC50 in 24 h for E. andrei was of 1.7âÃâ10(-2) mg cm(-2). The photocatalytic degradation of BPA mediated by TiO2 supported on glass spheres suffered strong influence of the water matrix. On real municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP) secondary effluent, 30 % of BPA remains in solution; nevertheless, the method has the enormous advantage since it eliminates the need of catalyst removal step, reducing the cost of treatment.\n\nPhotocatalytic mineralization of commercial herbicides in a pilot-scale solar CPC reactor: photoreactor modeling and reaction kinetics constants independent of radiation field.\n\nPubMed\n\nColina-MÃ¡rquez, Jose; Machuca-MartÃ­nez, Fiderman; Li Puma, Gianluca\n\n2009-12-01\n\nThe six-flux absorption-scattering model (SFM) of the radiation field in the photoreactor, combined with reaction kinetics and fluid-dynamic models, has proved to be suitable to describe the degradation of water pollutants in heterogeneous photocatalytic reactors, combining simplicity and accuracy. In this study, the above approach was extended to model the photocatalytic mineralization of a commercial herbicides mixture (2,4-D, diuron, and ametryne used in Colombian sugar cane crops) in a solar, pilot-scale, compound parabolic collector (CPC) photoreactor using a slurry suspension of TiO(2). The ray-tracing technique was used jointly with the SFM to determine the direction of both the direct and diffuse solar photon fluxes and the spatial profile of the local volumetric rate of photon absorption (LVRPA) in the CPC reactor. Herbicides mineralization kinetics with explicit photon absorption effects were utilized to remove the dependence of the observed rate constants from the reactor geometry and radiation field in the photoreactor. The results showed that the overall model fitted the experimental data of herbicides mineralization in the solar CPC reactor satisfactorily for both cloudy and sunny days. Using the above approach kinetic parameters independent of the radiation field in the reactor can be estimated directly from the results of experiments carried out in a solar CPC reactor. The SFM combined with reaction kinetics and fluid-dynamic models proved to be a simple, but reliable model, for solar photocatalytic applications.\n\nBOKASUN: A fast and precise numerical program to calculate the Master Integrals of the two-loop sunrise diagrams\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCaffo, Michele; CzyÅ¼, Henryk; Gunia, MichaÅ; Remiddi, Ettore\n\n2009-03-01\n\nWe present the program BOKASUN for fast and precise evaluation of the Master Integrals of the two-loop self-mass sunrise diagram for arbitrary values of the internal masses and the external four-momentum.

In the current study C-phycocyanin containing protein extract (C-PC extract) of Spirulina platensis have been studied for its effect on human matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2). In the present study, breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB 231) and hepatocellular cancer cell line (HepG2) were examined for inhibition of MMPs at different levels of expression after C-PC extract treatment. Herein, we have demonstrated that C-PC extract significantly reduced activity of MMP-2 by 55.13% and MMP-9 by 57.9% in HepG2 cells at 15Â Î¼g concentration. Additionally, the treatment has reduced mRNA expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at 20Â Î¼g concentration by 1.65-folds and 1.66-folds respectively. The C-PC extract treatment have also downregulated a mRNA expression of TIMP-2 by 1.12 folds at 20Â Î¼g concentration in HepG2 cells. Together, these results indicate that C-PC, extract successfully inhibited MMP-2 and -9 at different levels of expression and TIMP-2 at a mRNA expression level; however, extract did not have any effect on MMP-1 expressed in MDA-MB231 and TIMP-1 expressed in HepG2 cells as well as the exact mechanism of inhibition of MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 remained unclear.\n\nNitrate induction of root hair density is mediated by TGA1/TGA4 and CPC transcription factors in Arabidopsis thaliana.\n\nPubMed\n\nCanales, Javier; Contreras-LÃ³pez, Orlando; Ãlvarez, JosÃ© M; GutiÃ©rrez, Rodrigo A\n\n2017-10-01\n\nRoot hairs are specialized cells that are important for nutrient uptake. It is well established that nutrients such as phosphate have a great influence on root hair development in many plant species. Here we investigated the role of nitrate on root hair development at a physiological and molecular level. We showed that nitrate increases root hair density in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that two different root hair defective mutants have significantly less nitrate than wild-type plants, suggesting that in A.Â thaliana root hairs have an important role in the capacity to acquire nitrate. Nitrate reductase-null mutants exhibited nitrate-dependent root hair phenotypes comparable with wild-type plants, indicating that nitrate is the signal that leads to increased formation of root hairs. We examined the role of two key regulators of root hair cell fate, CPC and WER, in response to nitrate treatments. Phenotypic analyses of these mutants showed that CPC is essential for nitrate-induced responses of root hair development. Moreover, we showed that NRT1.1 and TGA1/TGA4 are required for pathways that induce root hair development by suppression of longitudinal elongation of trichoblast cells in response to nitrate treatments. Our results prompted a model where nitrate signaling via TGA1/TGA4 directly regulates the CPC root hair cell fate specification gene to increase formation of root hairs in A.Â thaliana.

Building on scale practices in measuring compulsive sexual behavior, two cut-off points were identified. While most (76-80%) MSM do not report compulsive symptoms, about 16-20% report levels of problematic SEM consumption, including 7% with extreme scores consistent with DSM criteria for compulsive disorders. Demographic, sexual, and HIV risk differences were identified between the three groups. Researchers and clinicians are encouraged to consider using the CPC scale for comprehensive assessment of compulsive sexual behavior.

M.; Nissen, S.; Liu, X.; Chourey, K.; Vishnivetskaya, T. A.; Hettich, R.; Loeffler, F.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nAnaeromyxobacter dehalogenans is a metabolically versatile Deltaproteobacterium and conserves energy from the reduction of various electron acceptors, including insoluble MnO2 and ferric oxides/oxyhydroxides (FeOOH). The goal of this study was to identify c-type cytochromes involved in electron transfer to MnO2. The characterization of deletion mutants has revealed a number of c-type cytochromes involved in electron transfer to solid metal oxides in Shewanella spp. and Geobacter spp; however, a genetic system for Anaeromyxobacter is not available. The A. dehalogenans str. 2CP-C genome encodes 68 putative c-type cytochromes, which all lack functional assignments. To identify c-type cytochromes involved in electron transfer to solid MnO2, protein expression profiles of A. dehalogenans str. 2CP-C cells grown with acetate as electron donor and MnO2, ferric citrate, FeOOH, nitrate or fumarate as electron acceptors were compared. Whole cell proteomes were analyzed after trypsin proteolysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Distinct c-type cytochrome expression patterns were observed with cells grown with different electron acceptors. A. dehalogenans str. 2CP-C grown with MnO2 expressed 25 out of the 68 c-type cytochromes encoded on the genome. The c-type cytochrome Adeh_1278 was only expressed in strain 2CP-C grown with MnO2. Reverse transcription PCR confirmed that the Adeh_1278 gene was transcribed in MnO2-grown cells but not in cells grown with other terminal electron acceptors. The expression of the Adeh_1278 gene correlated with Mn(IV) reduction activity. Adeh_1278 has three heme binding motifs and is predicted to be located in the periplasm. The identification of Adeh_1278 as a protein uniquely expressed when MnO2 serves as electron acceptor suggests its utility as a biomarker for MnO2 reduction. This example demonstrates the value of the LC-MS/MS approach for identifying specific proteins of interest and making functional assignments\n\nIntegrating Learning and Performance.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\n1998\n\nThis document contains four papers from a symposium on integrating learning and performance in human resource development (HRD). \"Action Imperatives that Impact Knowledge Performance and Financial Performance in the Learning Organization: An Exploratory Model\" (Gary L.

S.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nVery early in the Space Launch Initiative program, a small team of engineers at MSFC proposed a process for performing system-level assessments of a launch vehicle. Aimed primarily at providing insight and making NASA a smart buyer, the Vehicle Integrated Performance Analysis (VIPA) team was created. The difference between the VIPA effort and previous integration attempts is that VIPA a process using experienced people from various disciplines, which focuses them on a technically integrated assessment. The foundations of VIPA s process are described. The VIPA team also recognized the need to target early detailed analysis toward identifying significant systems issues. This process is driven by the T-model for technical integration. VIPA s approach to performing system-level technical integration is discussed in detail. The VIPA process significantly enhances the development and monitoring of realizable project requirements. VIPA s assessment validates the concept s stated performance, identifies significant issues either with the concept or the requirements, and then reintegrates these issues to determine impacts. This process is discussed along with a description of how it may be integrated into a program s insight and review process. The VIPA process has gained favor with both engineering and project organizations for being responsive and insightful\n\nComparative c-type cytochrome expression analysis in Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 and Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans strain 2CP-C grown with soluble and insoluble oxidised metal electron acceptors\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNissen, Silke; Liu, Xiaoxin; Chourey, Karuna\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe genomes of Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 and Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans strain 2CP-C encode 40 and 69 putative c-type cytochrome genes, respectively. Deletion mutant and biochemical studies have assigned specific functions to a few c-type cytochromes involved in electron transfer to oxidised metals in Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1. Although promising, the genetic approach is limited to gene deletions that produce a distinct phenotype, and organism for which a genetic system is available. To more comprehensively investigate and compare c-type cytochrome expression in Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 and Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans strain 2CP-C, proteomic measurements were used to characterise lysates of cells grownmoreÂ Â» with soluble Fe(III) (as ferric citrate) and insoluble Mn(IV) (as MnO2) as electron acceptors. Strain MR-1 expressed 19 and 20, and strain 2CP-C expressed 27 and 25 c-type cytochromes when grown with Fe(III) and Mn(IV), respectively. The majority of c-type cytochromes (77% for strain MR-1 and 63% for strain 2CP-C) were expressed under both growth conditions; however, the analysis also revealed unique c-type cytochromes that were specifically expressed in cells grown with soluble Fe(III) or insoluble Mn(IV). Proteomic characterisation proved to be a promising approach for determining the c-type cytochrome complement expressed under different growth conditions, and will help elucidating the specific functions of more c-type cytochromes that are the basis for Shewanella and Anaeromyxobacter respiratory versatility.Â«Â less\n\ni-PI: A Python interface for ab initio path integral molecular dynamics simulations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCeriotti, Michele; More, Joshua; Manolopoulos, David E.\n\n2014-03-01\n\nRecent developments in path integral methodology have significantly reduced the computational expense of including quantum mechanical effects in the nuclear motion in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. However, the implementation of these developments requires a considerable programming effort, which has hindered their adoption. Here we describe i-PI, an interface written in Python that has been designed to minimise the effort required to bring state-of-the-art path integral techniques to an electronic structure program. While it is best suited to first principles calculations and path integral molecular dynamics, i-PI can also be used to perform classical molecular dynamics simulations, and can just as easily be interfaced with an empirical forcefield code. To give just one example of the many potential applications of the interface, we use it in conjunction with the CP2K electronic structure package to showcase the importance of nuclear quantum effects in high-pressure water.

Reliability of these systems, when desired, must be obtained by remodeling the system in a different tool. This has obvious drawbacks: (1) substantial extra effort is required to create the reliability model; (2) through modeling error the reliability model may not reflect precisely the same system as the performance model; (3) as the performance model evolves one must continuously reevaluate the validity of assumptions made in that model. In this paper we describe an approach, and a tool that implements this approach, for integrating a reliability analysis engine into a production quality simulation based performance modeling tool, and for modeling within such an integrated tool. The integrated tool allows one to use the same modeling formalisms to conduct both performance and reliability studies. We describe how the reliability analysis engine is integrated into the performance tool, describe the extensions made to the performance tool to support the reliability analysis, and consider the tool's performance.\n\nA Brief Scale to Measure Problematic Sexually Explicit Media Consumption: Psychometric Properties of the Compulsive Pornography Consumption (CPC) Scale among Men who have Sex with Men\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNoor, Syed WB; Simon Rosser, B. R.; Erickson, Darin J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAlthough the phenomenon of hypersexuality has been described in the literature, and scales of compulsive sexual behavior have been published, the existing measures do not assess compulsive sexually explicit media (SEM) consumption. This study tested the psychometric properties of a new scale, the Compulsive Pornography Consumption (CPC). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses results showed good psychometric performance of a five item two factor preoccupation-compulsivity solution. As hypothesized, the scale correlates positively with compulsive sexual behavior, internalized homonegativity, and negatively with sexual self-esteem. The scale will enable researchers to investigate the etiologic factors of compulsive SEM use, and enable clinicians to assess problematic consumption.

Total organic carbon (TOC) reduction by heterogeneous photocatalysis (TiO(2)) and homogeneous photocatalysis with photo-Fenton was observed. The influence of TiO(2) concentration (200 or 500 mg/L) and also of combining TiO(2) with H(2)O(2) or Na(2)S(2)O(8) on heterogeneous photocatalysis was evaluated. Heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO(2), TiO(2)/H(2)O(2) and TiO(2)/S(2)O(8)(2-) is revealed to be inefficient in removing TOC, originating TOC degradation of 10%, 11% and 25%, respectively, at best. However, photo-Fenton experiments led to 46% TOC degradation in simulated wastewater prepared with diluted wine (WV) and 93% in wastewater prepared with diluted grape juice (WG), and if ethanol is previously eliminated from mixed wine and grape juice wastewater (WW) by air stripping, it removes 96% of TOC. Furthermore, toxicity decreases during the photo-Fenton reaction very significantly from 48% to 28%. At the same time, total polyphenols decrease 92%, improving wastewater biodegradability.\n\nProbing sensorimotor integration during musical performance.\n\nPubMed\n\nFuruya, Shinichi; Furukawa, Yuta; Uehara, Kazumasa; Oku, Takanori\n\n2018-03-10\n\nAn integration of afferent sensory information from the visual, auditory, and proprioceptive systems into execution and update of motor programs plays crucial roles in control and acquisition of skillful sequential movements in musical performance. However, conventional behavioral and neurophysiological techniques that have been applied to study simplistic motor behaviors limit elucidating online sensorimotor integration processes underlying skillful musical performance. Here, we propose two novel techniques that were developed to investigate the roles of auditory and proprioceptive feedback in piano performance. First, a closed-loop noninvasive brain stimulation system that consists of transcranial magnetic stimulation, a motion sensor, and a microcomputer enabled to assess time-varying cortical processes subserving auditory-motor integration during piano playing. Second, a force-field system capable of manipulating the weight of a piano key allowed for characterizing movement adaptation based on the feedback obtained, which can shed light on the formation of an internal representation of the piano. Results of neurophysiological and psychophysics experiments provided evidence validating these systems as effective means for disentangling computational and neural processes of sensorimotor integration in musical performance.

The integration of the diverse knowledge of the health professions in shared mental models is a precondition for effective teamwork and team performance. As it is known that different groups of health care professionals often tend to work in isolation, the authors compared the perceptions of knowledge integration. It can be expected that based on this isolation, knowledge integration is assessed differently. The purpose of this paper is to test these differences in the perception of knowledge integration between the professional groups and to identify to what extent knowledge integration predicts perceptions of teamwork and team performance and to determine if teamwork has a mediating effect. The study is a multi-center cross-sectional study with a descriptive-explorative design. Data were c"
