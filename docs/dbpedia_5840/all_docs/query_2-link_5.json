        "text": "Site Uses Space Launch Complex 1E/W (SLC-1E and SLC-1W) (SLC-1E June 1959 – September 1968)\n\n(SLC-1W January 1959 – December 1971)\n\nBoth sites were built in 1958 for the never activated 75th Strategic Missile Squadron for Thor-Agena A launches. SLC-1E was 75-3-5, SLC-1W was 75-3-4. Both were upgraded to a Space Launch Complex (SLC) in 1966. Inactivated with phaseout of Thor-Agena. SLC-1E inactivated in 1968, 45 Launches; SLC-1W inactivated in 1971, 56 launches.[2]\n\nSpace Launch Complex 3 East (SLC-3E) (July 1961 – November 2022)\n\nPreviously used for Atlas II (1999–2003); Atlas-H (1983–1987); Atlas-F/G, Atlas-Agena since 1961. Originally an Atlas test facility, designated PALC1-2, then LC1-2, and finally upgraded to a Space Launch Complex (SLC) in 1966.[2] Used for Atlas V launches from March 2008 to November 2022.[5] Undergoing modification in preparation for future use as Vulcan Centaur launch site.[6][7] Space Launch Complex 3-West (SLC-3W) (October 1960 – March 1995)\n\nActivated in 1960. First designated LC1-1 and used to launch Atlas-Agena B with Samos payloads. When Samos was cancelled, rebuilt in 1963 for Corona reconnaissance satellites atop Thor-Agena. Upgraded to a Space Launch Complex (SLC) in 1966. Used for later Thor-Agena and Delta I launches in the 1960s and early 1970s. Refurbished in 1973 to accommodate surplus Atlas ICBMs in space launch role. Inactivated in 1995 with last Atlas E launch of a weather satellite. SLC-3W's tower was demolished on 22 January 2000.[2] SpaceX briefly used SLC-3W in 2005 during the early development of the Falcon 1.[8][9] Space Launch Complex 5 (SLC-5) (April 1962 – May 1994)\n\nDedicated Scout rocket launch pad from 1962 to 1994. 69 launches.[2] Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC-6) (August 1995 – September 2022)\n\nSLC-6 was built as a Space Launch Complex (SLC) between 1966 and 1969 for Titan III, Gemini-B Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) flight.[2] After the program was canceled, the pad sat unused for 10 years. It was then upgraded between 1979 and 1989 for Space Shuttle polar orbit launches before being mothballed again due to the Challenger accident and many unresolved technical issues. It was considered for a second Titan launch facility, but was not selected.[2] Supported Athena 1 and 2 launch vehicles (1995–1999). Delta IV launches began in June 2006 for commercial and military payloads going into polar orbits.[2] Vacated by ULA following final Delta IV launch from SLC-6 in September 2022.[10][11] On 24 April 2023 it was leased to SpaceX for its Falcon 9 launches from the West Coast.[10][2] First Falcon launch planned for mid-2025.[12]\n\nSpace Launch Complex 10E/W (SLC-10E (former LE-7) and SLC-10W) (SLC-10E June 1959 – 1961) (LE-7 1961 – March 1962)\n\n(SLC-10W August 1959 – July 1980)\n\nSpace and Missile Heritage Center\n\nSLC-10E (launch pad 75-2-7) and SLC-10W (75-2-6) activated as a Thor-Delta (DM-18A) pads in 1959. Upgraded to a Space Launch Complex (SLC) in 1961. From 1961 to March 1962, SLC-10E was known as LE-7 (Launch Emplacement 7). It was inactivated in March 1962. SLC-10W continued launch operations with various configurations of the Thor-Delta until the phaseout of the vehicle in 1980. Declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986, SLC-10 is the best surviving example of a launch complex built in the 1950s at the beginning of the American effort to explore space. It is home to the Space and Missile Heritage Center, which is open by appointment through the Base Public Affairs office for public tours.[2]\n\nSite Uses 395-A1, 395-A2, 395-A3 395 Alpha 1 (September 1961 – December 1964)\n\n395 Alpha 2 (March 1963 – March 1965)\n\n395 Alpha 3 (January 1962 – January 1965)\n\nHGM-25A Titan I, 3 operational alert sites.
