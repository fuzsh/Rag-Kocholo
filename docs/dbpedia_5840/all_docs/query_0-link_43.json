Work was begun on the construction of a large recreational resort on the spit in the early 1900's. A.t the outset, the resort appeared to have a promising future. However, a three-year delay in the completion of the railroad to Tillamook created financial instability and lawsuits which continued up to the depression of the early 1930's. There soon followed severe erosion of Bayocean spit leading to its breaching in 1952 and forcing the abandonment of the deteriorated resort. The erosion appeared to have been initiated by the construction and sub- sequent lengthening of a north jetty to the Tillamook Bay channel. Rapid sand deposition north of the north jetty indicated that the structure had blocked a predominant north to south longshore sand transport, thus depriving the spit of sand and resulting in erosion. Similar occurrences have been documented at other coastal locations. However, analysis of historical shoreline changes and aerial photo- graphs taken in 1971, 1972, and 1973 show that sand eroded from beaches to the north and to the south of the jetty has been transported and deposited immediately adjacent to both sides of the structure. This symmetrical pattern of erosion and deposition on both sides of the jetty indicates a reversing longshore sand transport with a near- zero net annual drift. The shoreline conditions at Bayocean demon- strate that beach erosion can result from the construction of a jetty transverse to a seasonally reversing longshore sand transport with a near-zero net drift. DEVELOPMENT AND EROSION HISTORY OF BAYOCEAN SPIT, TILLAMOOK, OREGON CHAPTERI INTRODUCTION Bayocean spit, on the northern Oregon coast separating the Pacific Ocean from Tillamook Bay (Figure 1), has had a long history of beach erosion. Early in the century, work was begun on a large beach resort on the sp it. Financial problems caused the decline of the resort, and it was abandoned in 1952 as severe erosion and breaching of the spit threatened the few remaining residents. The erosion was believed to have been caused by the construction of a north jetty to the Tillamook Bay channel. The jetty is thought to have blocked the prevailing north to south littoral sand transport thus de- priving Bayocean spit of sand. The purposes of this study are: (1) to recount the growth and decline of Bayocean Park, the resort development on Bayocean spit; (2) to investigate the erosion of Bayocean spit from the earliest accounts up to the present; and (3) to interpret the erosional and depositional patterns on the spit and neighboring -beaches to determine the cause of the severe erosion of Bayocean spit. Information on the Bayocean Park development and erosion history was gathered from a microfilm study of Tillamook and 460-60: Figure 1. 1969 aerial view of Tillamook Bay and Bayocean spit. 3 Portland newspapers dating back to the. late 1880's The Tillamook County Clerk and Surveyor provided historic deed records and maps of the reso rt. The Tillamook County Pioneer Museum, Oregon State Archives, Oregon Historical Society, and Special Collections at the University of Oregon library supplied many early photographs and ,original documents of the Bayocean resort and subsequent erosion of the spit. Tillamook County Tax Assessor maps served as a valuable source for measuring shoreline recession for selected areas of the spit. The Portland District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provided numerous engineering reports and aerial photographs of the spit taken as far back as 1939. Recent physical changes to the spit were monitored by aerial photography taken in 1971, 1972. and 1973 under contract by Western Aerial Contractors specifically for this study. CHAPTERII PHYSICAL SETTING AND LAND USE Tillamook Bay and its adjoining lowland (Figure 1) are bounded on the east by the Oregon Coast Range, which parallels the coast from the Columbia River south to the Klamath Mountains. The Coast Range varies in width from 25 to 65 miles, locally reaching elevations of 3, 000 to 4, 000 feet. Baldwin (1964) summarizes the geologic com- position of the northern Coast Range as primarily composed of thick submarine volcanic flows, breccias, and tuffaceous sedimentary rock of the Eocene Siletz River Volcanics. This volcanic material is overlain by Tyee sandstone. Many dikes and sills intrude major formations of the Coast Range, forming resistant features. Much of the seaward side of the Coast Range is composed of Oligo-Miocene sandstones. These sedimentary rocks are the most widespread strata along the northern Oregon shoreline. At points, these sediments are pierced by Tertiary intrusions that form some of the major headlands such as Cape Meares, south of Bayocean spit. The Hydrographic System Five rivers flow down the western flanks of the Coast Range and empty into Tillamook Bay; the Miami, Kilchis, Wilson, Trask, and Tillamook rivers. Prior to entering Tillamook Bay, the latter 5. four rivers converge in the Tillamook lowland, one of the largest lowlands along the northern Oregon coast. The lowland has a.:soil zone of approximately 6 feet, the uppermost horizon of which is composed of silt nearly 2 feet thick. Below the upper horizon is a mottled clay horizon varying from 3 to 4 feet thick. Cr6ss-bedded .gravels underlie the soil zone to a depth of 200 feet. Schlicker et al. (1972) found post -Pleistocene estuarine mud and silt that had been deposited on the lowland prior to the deposition of the flood plain sediments, The five major rivers have a combined drainage area of 535 .square miles and produce combined discharges as summarized in Table I (U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Tillamook Bay, 1970). Table 1. Freshwater Discharge into Tillamook Ba.y.

As is the case with most of Oregon's estuaries, 6 Tillamook Bay is slowly filling with land derived sediments. More- over, beach and dune sands may be contributed to the bay by littoral and aeolian processes, much as is the case withlYaquina Bay (Hulm. and Byrne, 1966). In the case of Yaquina Bay, substantial amounts of sand are being supplied to the Yaquina Bay chiefly during the winter and spring from inland rivers, littoral drift, and nearby dunes. Kulm and Byrne found the rate of sediment deposition in the channel between the entrance of the jetties and the upstream end of the turn- ing basin to be 9. 1 inches of sand per year. Thomas Murray and Associates (1972) found alarge decrease in depths in the upper and lower Tillamook Bay by comparing old and recent U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey maps. Tillamook Bay and Bayocean spit are believed to have been formed from the eustatic rise of sea level and partial drowning of stream valleys. Figure 2 illustrates a.geologist's conception of the development of the spit and bay. The late Pleistocene transgression of the sea drowned the lowland and extended up the tributary valleys. The sea's transgression is believed to have initiated a straightening of the shoreline as waves eroded back promontories and beach deposits closed off inlets. Evans (1942) stated that the growth of spits is always in the direction of beach drifting, and that the more material carried forward by the process the more rapidly-the spit grows. It appears that Bayocean spit thus evolved and grew from the northward 7 WAR CGFARTICZNT W\"S OF Z101143=111ILS. V 8.

Presently, Bayocean spit is approximately 4 miles long and varies in width from 1, 000 feet in its m-idsection to over 3, 000 feet at its northern and southern extremes. The south end, in the past much narrower, has been artificially diked and widened. Similarly, the north end has recently been widened by 2, 000 feet due to sand accretion south of the new jetty at Kincheloe. Point. Elevations vary from a few feet above mean lower low water at the southern end of the spit to 140 feet on the highest dunes located near the midsection. Bayocean's low hummocky surface is typical of most spits that [lave developed from loose sediments. The surf-borne sands become dried on the exposed backshore where winds accumulate it into small dunes that grow and migrate. Dicken (1961) describes the northern portion of the spit as marked by a low hummocky foredune with a broad sand flat in the interior. Several northwest -southeast trending hum- rhocks are found on the bay side of the spit. The midsection of the spit has a high foredune and a complex of vegetated ridges and swales also trending northwest -southeast. The southernmost area of the spit is broad and flat with sparse grass cover, Dicken (1961) found an embryo of a foredune along some areas of the southern section of the spit indicating dune building on the sand flat. 9 Vegetation Cover Nearly the entire spit is covered with vegetation. The densest cluster is found in the midsection where the dominant types are Shore pine (Pinus contorta (Dougl. ) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong. ) Carr, ) with an undergrowth of European beach grass (Amm-ophila arenaria (L.) Link. ), Kinnikinnick (Arctostaphylos uva- ursi (L. ) Spreng and Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius (L. ) Link.). In the past, trees extended from their present location in the mid- section of the spit, to its southern limits. The breach in 1952 completely eroded the southern end of the spit and destroyed all of the vegetation. A 75 -acre sand flat now occupies the breach site. Plantings of European beach grass, Scotch broom, shore pine and Sitka spruce have been made to stabilize this zone. However, recent photographs of the area reveal little evidence of the planted vegetation, which has experienced repeated washover. The northern section of the spit is covered with grasses, low shrubs and sparsely scattered shore pine which appear to be stabilizing the loose sand. Climate Because of its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, the Tillamook area has a.marine climate with cool summers and moderate winters. The annual temperature range is from approximately 40 0F in January 10 to 60OF in July and August. Precipitation is predominantly associated with cyclonic activity, with maximum rainfall occurring during the winter months. Over 70 percent of the total annual precipitation occurs during the five months of November through March, and less than 7 percent during the three summer months of June through August. Recorded precipitation at Tillamook for the @rears 1927-1959 shows an average annual rainfall of 89. 33 inches with extremes ranging from 130. 29 to 64. 62 inches. The month of December typically has the highest monthly rainfall with extremes ranging from 35. 78 inches to 4. 89 inches. July generally has the lowest rainfall averaging 1. 19 inches for the recording period. The increasing elevations in the Coast Range east of Tillamook effect an increase of annual precipitation, Some of the heaviest rain- fall areas in the United States are found in the Coast Range. Figure 3 illustrates the abundant precipitation that annually occurs within the Tillamook Bay drainage basin. The copious winter precipitation pro- vides high runoff and river discharges into Tillamook Bay (see Table 1). Conversely, the relatively dry, summers are reflected in low river flows. Responses to the seasonal extremes in precipitation within the Tillamook Bay drainage basin are reflected in the average monthly discharges of the Trask and Wilson rivers (Figure 4). .The interaction of pressure systems within the north Pacific Ocean largely determines the seasonal wind conditions along much of P,Zdftc Ocean Tillammh Bay (D CD (D pr CD 0 0 ;j (:::: 0 0 0 td 0) ,< o'Q oil (D 001 (D tz to T I CA 0 (A 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 RIVER DISCHARGE (ft3lsecond) ........................ --- ------------------------ .......... ........... ..... .......................... ........ ......................... ............... . -- --------------- ....................................... 0............. ........... ----------- &:-..*o ----------------- ....................... ............. , :6*..:*:..*.:::..,:::..:::::::::::::::.:.:.:.:....0.........- - - - - - ... 0 . 0 ... .................................... ....... ... .......... .......... ..... ..... ...................................... ............................. bb c@ ril Cb cn q 0 40 rv, cb @o co cn r?l 113 CID 2T 13 the Pacific Northwest coast. Cooper (1958) found north to northwest winds predominating over the nearshore and coastal areas of Oregon during the summer. During the winter, south to southwest winds are most frequent. Bourke (1971) presents wind data for Tillamook gathered from 1943-1945 by the U. S. Weather Bureau. During that period, northwesterly -winds dominated. in March and May through September; -while south and southwesterly winds were most frequent from October through February and April. Thus, Tillamook winds show a six-month seasonal --rreversal. Drainage Area and Runoff The Miami, Kilchis, Wilson, Trask and Tillamook rivers originate in the upper reaches of the Coast Range and flow through forest lands to the coastal lowlands and. finally into Tillamook Bay (Figure 5). They have a combined drainage basin area of 535 square miles and an annual combined runoff of 2, 849, 100 acre feet at an average discharge of 3, 500 cfs, Table Z illustrates the individual characteristics of these rivers. The generous normal precipitation experienced in the Coast Range and the copious downpours associated with major winter storms generate high potential for flooding in the Tillamook area (Table 1). Recent flooding occurred in January, 1972, December, 1964 and January, 1965. The flooding of January, 197Z was classified as a Pacific Ocean Tillamook Bay 0 M QQ 0 tj CA W ----------- Q Lnu 0 w 4 15 Table 2. Tillamook Bay Drainage Basin Hydrographic Characteristics.

The flooding of December, 1964 and January, 1965 was classified as a 70-year flood, or a 1. 4 chance in 100 of occurring in a given year. Schlicker et al. (197Z) states that contributing to lowland flooding in the area are the following: high tides, strong onshore winds, low permeability of highland soils, siltation of lower reache.s of major streams and bays, .rapid runoff due to the loss of vegetative cover from the Tillamook Burn, and extensive logging. Tides Tides within the 9, 000 acre area of Tillamook Bay have the diurnal inequality typical of the Pacific coast. The mean diurnal tidal range within the bay is 7. 5 feet. This range is somewhat reduced to a minimum of 5. 2 at the extreme southern end of the bay, farthest 16 from the channel entrance. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (1970) has calculated a tidal prism for Tillamook Bay of 2. 49 x 109ft3 Tidal current velocities at the channel entrance were measured by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (1970) on July 29 and 30 and August 5 and 6 in 1969. Three complete ebb-flood cycles were observed, with the results tabulated in Table 3. The freshwater dis- charge during the measurements was very low. In order to make proper design requirements for the construction of the south jetty, a flow of 257, 000 cfs was used as the combined tidal and freshwater dis- charge at the strength of ebb during a 50-year flood of 90, 000 cfs. The south jetty, which is presently under construction, is designed to allow for a 1, 475 -foot wide channel entrance that will be nearly self - maintaining to a depth of 18 feet. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers is surveying and taking aerial photographs to monitor the effects of the construction of the south jetty on the tidal prism and currents in the entrance and also the effects on erosion of Bayocean spit. Furthermore, the Corps of Engineers is conducting tests with a small fixed-bed hydraulic model of Tillamook Bay with the purpose of studying the interrelationships of jetty spacing, tidal prisms, and regime of the bay. Sediment is transported into and. out of the channel by tidal currents. Some of the material that enters during the time of tidal flood is carried through the entrance and deposited within the bay. cn 0 cr P r- (31, Lrl Un N N (71 1 110 10 D (D t- n ID (D if 11 C@ U, + + + Cf) Ln 0 00 ED Fj (D > C, -I ID 'D 0 CD C) C> .4 p C) 0 C@ (D C) 0 CD C) orq C) C) CD C) m P W (D (D C) 0 p I-- 0 \" 0 U) cn (D (D 0 0 co + + + V N Lo u.)

S. Army Corps of Engineers (1.970) suggests that a considerable portion of that material remains and must be removed by dredging. Waves and Shore Currents Winter storms develop in the Gulf of Alaska and eastern Pacific. These storms create winds that circulate counter- clockwise around deep low pressure centers. The storms approach the Oregon coast from the south and southwest driving the sea surface into large waves with significant deep water wave heights of 20 to 30 feet or more; -these waves attack the shore from. the same direction (Figure 6). In the summer months, lower and longer-period waves arrive at the Oregon coast predominantly from the northwestern quadrant. One of the most detailed wave studies for the Pacific Northwest was conducted by National Marine Consultants in 1960 and 1961. They employed wave hindcasting techniques to determine seasonal wave conditions. Data were grouped by seasons, winter including the months of December, January and February; spring - March, April and May; summer - June, July, Augustand September; and autumn October and November. General conclusions were drawn from the data: 1) The predominant direction from which local seas approached was SW-SSE during autumn and winter and N-NW during spring and summer. Mph ft 1.4 W A- 0.

(1969) found a sirailar seasonality to the littoral drift in his investigations. off Newport, Oregon. The drift direction from November -December to March is northward, reversing from April to October-November. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (War Dept. Dist. Eng., 1940) conducted monthly observations of currents along the foreshore plunge line of Bayocean spit from May, 1939 to April, 1940, except December. Observations were taken 0. Z5 and 0. .5 miles north of the jetty and along the spit at South Gap and Natatorium Gap. Currents were recorded as flowing to the north or south, parallel to the beach. .The average northerly and southerly current velocities at all stations were about oni@ foot per second. From May to.November, except,June and July, a southerly current predominated; whereas, a northerly current predominated from January to April. Land Use Forests occupy nearly 90 percent of the drainage basins that discharge into Tillamook Bay. Large areas of deforestation or clear cutting, however, have exposed the soil surface to increased runoff and erosion, substantially adding to water-borne sediment loads. Moreover, Tillamook County has experienced large forest fires that have incinerated vegetation, further exposing the soil to rapid water runoff and erosion. The \"Tillamook Burns'' deforested an estimated 300, 000 acres during the years 1933, 1939, and 1945. Approxi- mately 233, 000 acres of the burn area lie within Tillamook County, nearly all of which drains into Tillamook Bay. Formerly forested land was laid bare to heavy precipitation and runoff. Soil erosion undoubtedly increased stream sediment loads many-fold and resulted in increased deposition into Tillamook Bay., Reforestation of the \"Burn'' area began in 1949 and is scheduled for completion in 1973. Farm and croplands occupy approximately 30, 000 acres and are found primarily along the Miami and Tillamook rivers, The major production is in forage crops; however, there is a trend toward intensive agriculture. Earthen dikes have been built along some of the water courses of the lowland to prevent flooding and silt erosion. These dikes are often breached allowing floodwaters to erode valuable topsoil and add to the heavy sediment load of Tillamook County's rivers. zz CHAPTER III EARLY SETTLEMENT HISTORY One of the earliest observations of Tillamook Bay was given by a passenger aboard Captain Robert Gray's 90-ton sloop, \"Lady Washington. \" On August 14, 1788, the \"Lady Washington\" crossed the bar and anchored in Tillamook Bay. The following passages are excerpts from the passenger's diary (Bancroft, 1886). August 13th, latitude 450561 at noon; in evening passed a tolerable harbor, -with a bar. August 14th, returned to explore the harbor, which, after exploration by the boat, the sloop entered, anchoring half a mile from shore in two and one-fourth fathoms. Murderer's Harbor, for so it was named is I suppose, the entrance of the river of the West. It is by no means a safe place for any but a very ,small vessel to enter, -the.shoal at its entrance being so awkwardly situated, the passage so narrow, and the tide so rapid that it is scarcely possible to avoid danger. 'Captain Gray thought it likely that here was the mouth of the famous River of the West. Before his departure, he had good reason to name his anchorage \"Murderer's Harbor. \" Here, a group of the ship's company battled with natives and barely es.caped with their lives. The diary, written by this woman passenger, describes the dangers of the bar crossing, and notes only a small vessel may enter. However, it is significant to note that Captain Gray was willing and able to negotiate the bar and channel with his 90 -ton sloop. His 23 crossing indicates that the channel conditions were sufficiently safe in his judgment to allow for passage. Early Land Claims In 1867, Webely Hauxhurst clairned. the southern part of the sand spit. After his death, the claim was passed on to his wife, Mary Hauxhurst (Tillamook County Deed Records, June 15, 1877). The center and point of the sand spit were claimed respectively by A. B. Hallock and George Elliott on the same day, February 19, 1883 (Tillamook County Deed Records, February 19, 1883). .Hallock named his small holdings Barnegat, after a popular 'Atlantic coast beach resort (West Shore, 1882). Hallock welcomed tourists to the spit. An early newspaper account states that the spit 'was frequented by pleasure seekers and that A. B. Hallock had con- structed a \"Commodious wharf and warehouse here\" (Tillamook Herald, May 22, 1891). Hallock also established a post office within his home on the spit near present-day Jackson Gap. The primary purpose of the post office was to serve the Cape Meares Lighthouse (The Oregonian, April 5, 1953). Ownership of the original claims changed over the following several years. A. B. Hallock died passing ownership to his son, Edward. Following Edward Hallock's death, Annette B. Cotter, Edward's sister, inherited the land. The Elliott property was passed on to Scott Bezerth (Tillamook County Deed Records, February 19, 1883). 24 BaXocean Resort While visiting the Tillamook area in the early 1900's, T. B. Potter, president and general manager of the T. B. Potter Realty Company of San Francisco and Kansas City, recognized the recrea- tional potential of the sand spit. An early newspaper account desc,ribes Mr. Potter's professional prowess thusly (The Oregonian, June 2 9, 1970): @Mr. Potter has the reputation among his friends of never having touched an investment that has not forged to the front, an unqualified success. It is said that his greatest accomplishments are due to the fact that his observations are wonderfully discriminating; that he is quick to grasp opportunities for development and.that his subsequent action is quick, well-directed and gets results. It is said of him that he has enabled more people to make more money in suburban realty than any other individual in the United States. Potter's idea was to establish an elegant resort on the spit which he called Bayocean Park. He put his plan into action by purchasing the Bezerth holdings on May 18, 1907 and the Cotter claim on January 29, 1908 (Olsen, 1937). A deed of dedication and plat map were recorded with Tillamook County on June 29, 1907 (Deed Records Tillamook County, June 29, 1907). The plat map is an impressive display of approximately 3, 000 50 x 100 foot lots with a large block of land mid-way on the spit .reserved for the future hotel and bathhouse. Approximately 200 acres of land along the northern seaward side of the spit were to remain as a government reservation (Figure 7). Figure 7. Plat map of Bayocean Park dated June 29, 1907. Courtesy of Tillamook County Surveyor's Off ic e. Ln 26 The only access to Bayocean Park was by boat; therefore, a pier, pavilion and boathouse were planned mid-way on the bayward side of the spit. Several miles of public streets and boulevards were platted. The principal north and south roads were Bayocean Boule- vard, along the seaward margin of the spit, and Bay Street, parallel- ing the entire bay front. Avenues numbered 1 through 40 intersected the major thoroughfares. The same day the deed and plat map were recorded (June 29, 1907), a four column article appeared in the Sunday Oregonian detail- ing the splendor of the planned beach resort (The Oregonian, June 29, 1907): This most attractive vacation spot eclipsing all the resorts four tourist travel in Europe, excelling anything on the Atlantic Coast and outstripping the best on the Pacific shores is to be only a bit over a couple of hours ride from the very heart -of this city (Portland). E. E. Lytle, who is building The Pacific Railway and INavigation Company's line states that he is under obligation to complete the road next year, and places himself on record by saying that his trains will be able to run to Tillamook Bay in less than two and a half hours from the heart of Portland. By chance or design, a shorter article appeared in the same issue of The Oregonian (The Oregonian June 29, 1907) reporting that E. E. Lytle, President of the Pacific Railway and Navigation Com- pany, had inspected the progress of the line from Hillsboro to Tillamook and found the work progressing to his satisfaction. Portlanders' access to Tillamook was limited and time consuming. 27 Lytle's return trip to Portland took 9 hours and 15 minutes, and was considered a new record for automobile travel (The Oregonian, June 29, 1907). It was clear to the developers that the success of Bayocean Park depended to a large measure upon the completion of Lytle's Pacific Railway and Navigation Company railroad (Olsen, 1937). Lytle fully expected to complete the Portland to Tillamook line by 1908 (The Oregonian, June Z9, 1907)., -By plan, the train would run as far as Bay City. -Wharves had been built in Garibaldi and Bay City to accommodate the passenger traffic. At Bay City, Bayocean visitors .would then have a 15 -minute ferry ride to the resort. In spite of the depression of 1907, and the lack of a railroad line from Portland, Bayocean Park.lots sold readily with prices ranging from $150 to $1800. The high cost of the property was justi- fied on the grounds that improvements such'as grading and paving of streets, water lines and sidewalk construction. were included in the price. .Bayocean Park was widely advertised to offset its relative isola- tion from metropolitan centers, Figure 8 is an advertisement from Bonville's Western Monthly believed to have been published in 1909.* The fame of Bayocean spread and in March, 1908 seve.ral promi- nent Spokane, Washington investors visited the development with intentions of investing in the enterprise (Tillamook Herald, March 24, 1908). All of the visitors s-poke optimistically about the resort.

Courtesy of Oregon State Archives, Z 9 intended to build bungalows at the resort and live during the summer months. T. I. Potter, one of the party and no apparent relation to T. B. Potter, stated that T. H. Kiser of Portland would take, pictures of the resort . . . with a large moving picture machine. When these pictures are completed, Bayocean Park will be shown in its entirety. The views will be used for stereopticon lectures in the inland cities throughout the United States, giving the people an opportunity to see the. wonderful .beauty of Bayocean Park as well as if they were visitors in person (Tillamook Herald, March 24, 1908). At this same time, Dr. Mott of Salem, one of the investors, announced the purchase of a site for the construction of a heated salt water natatorium. Enthusiasm regarding the future of Bayocean Park grew as developmental plans and prophecies increased. Channel Improvements Tillamook was experiencing an economic upswing during 1907 and 1908 as the Bayocean development progressed and E. E. Lytle's railroad grew closer to completion. Moreover, local industrialists, led by the lumber interests, were lobbying state and federal politicians to improve the Tillamook channel and create a deep water port at Tillamook Bay (Tillamook-Headlight, December 31, 1908). Attempts had been made in the past to appeal to the federal government to construct jetties at the entrance to Tillamook Bay to stabilize the channel passage. Under storm conditions, the channel 30 was subject to rapid shifts of position up to one mile. One such account -was written in local. newspapers as told by the Captain of the \"Sue H. Elmore, \" a 131 -ton steamer which made weekly runs between Astoria and Tillamook (Tillamook -Herald, December 16, 1909). Tillamook Bay and Bar were surveyed and reviewed several times during the late 1800's and early 1900's. Early Corps of Engineers Reports (1887-1888 and 1898) clearly stated that there was no apparent need to improve the channel entrance (U. S. Congress, House., 1888): It is believed that the development of Tillamook Bay com- merce is in no way hindered by the present condition of the bar and entrance, in that any vessel that can navigate the bay will find no difficulty in crossing the bar. Tillamook Bar has always been considered by mariners as one of the safest along the coast on account of its generally uniform depth and position, and no wreck is known to have ever occurred in crossing it. It appears as though the findings of the Corps of Engineers and the experiences of the captain were opposed. However, in a subsequent report, the Corps of Engineers revised.their stand regarding possible channel improvements. The report introduced the possibility not only of a north jetty but a south jetty as well (U. S. Congress, House, 1903). After careful study of the map and local conditions, the following project for obtaining 15 feet at mean lower low water is submitted. It involves the construction of a north high tide jetty of rubblestone from the permanent North Head near Green Hill, running seaward in a gentle curve concave to the ebb. This jetty would act partially to prevent the greater part of the sand movement on the north side, but chiefly as a retaining wall to gently control the ebb current a.nd to keep it from spreading out to the north, and to confine it between this jetty and the shoal south sand spit. . . .At 31 the same time it would seem desirable to build a shorter high- tide south jetty extending out from Kincheloe Point 4, 400 feet from high water mark, to check the cyclic sand movement into the harbor from the south. The Corps of Engineers appeared to acknowledge the ephemeral positioning of the channel and shoals. However, economics dictated that Tillamook's proximity to the Columbia River's major port facilities and its lack of a railroad severely limited its port potential, thus precluding channel improvements as of 1904. Tillamook's economic upswing of .1907-1908 prompted another reappraisal of channel improvements by the Corps of Engineers (U. S. Congress, House, 1908). The-.primary emphasis was a study of the ship .traffic at Tillamook Bay in order to determine if the traffic was large enough to warrant channel improvements. Jetty construction was again rejected; however, it ''would be reconsidered when Tillamook would receive its long-hoped-for railroad\" (U. S. Congress) House, 1908). The thought was that the railroad would inQre&.se commerce and shipping traffic for Tillamook Bay, thus.justifying the channel improvements. .Bazocean Park 1910-1914 The planned completion of Lytle's railroads in 1908 was central to the developmental plans of Bayocean Park and the desired increase of commerce for Tillamook (The Oregonian, June 29, 1907). The 3Z railroad was not completed in 1908 nor in 1909, delaying developmental plans of Bayocean's investors. In May, 1909, in preparation for the coming of the railroad, a 37-foot launch, \"Bayocean\" (Figure 9), was inaugurated into the enterprise to shuttle passengers and goods between the resort and the rail lines at Bay City and Garibaldi (Tillamook Herald, May 6, 1909). Property continued to be sold primarily by an active advertising campaign. During 1911-1912, Potter had a monthly published in Portland called The Surf (Figure 10). Its primary purpose was to tell of news of the resort development. Property exchanges and some improvements continued; however, not at the pace desired, as Lytle's railroad was behind schedule thus delaying the full promotion of the res ort. Physical improvements promised to the property owners decreased. Dissent among the property owners began (Olsen, 1937). .However, on October 9, 1911, the Lytle railroad at long last reached Bay City (The Oregonian, Jautiary 1, 191Z). Bayocean Park took on renewed life. Moreover, with the arrival of the railroad, the Corps of Engineers re-examined and approved the construction of a north jetty to Tillamook Bay channel; however, the question of a south jetty was delayed for future consideration (U. S. Congress, House, 1911). Tillamook residents and investors grew optimistic with the encouraging developments. Potter had published a ZZ page booklet promoting the beauty of Bayocean Park (Bayocean, 1907 ?).

R. & N. rail lines to Bay City and the Bayocean Park docks. T. B. Potter's predictions about the attractiveness of the resort illustrate the.vigor of this promotional .campaign (Bayocean, 1907?): These natural attractions should of themselves be sufficient to draw the tourists from all parts of.the world, but in addition we are expending over one million dollars in high grade improvements, and when completed we challenge the world to produce another such resort as Bayocean. The arrival of the railroad finally allowed the scheduling of an official opening of the resort for June IZ, 191Z (Olsen, 1937). Photo- graphs of the resort taken at its high point of development illustrate its attractiveness. Wide sandy beaches were backed by stable vegetation- covered foredunes (Figure IZ). The large salt water natatorium was constructed mid-way on the spit, at the base of the foredunes (Figure 13). Upon the foredune and near the natatorium was the 40-room Bayocean Hotel (Figure 14). Other humble yet adequate temporary bungalow housing and tents were available to the visitor. Many large private vacation homes and permanent residences were scattered throughout the park (Figure 15). A pamphlet prepared about 1913 provided the following information about the resort (Bayocean Park Resort, 1913?): The natatorium is a 136-foot tank of artificially heated salt water. 41, MWO ;Z ly MR - rl p A2 CD -M :\".4k'fq@g -e, Rl At Ali-VI w jzlj A 71 11 El\" I ee 'izN t @J it L.,, mtky v Os CD CD Er) IV 39 W-, 't A@ 41 MR, 1@7, &gw q@ NT A U 4@ M ro for *4 Figure 14.

Also, 10 tents, furnished and equipped like the bungalows, for $9. 50 per week (10 days, $15). Round trip tickets on P. R. & N. line $5,.67 good from Friday to Monday. Construction of the North Jetty In June, 1914, work commenced on the construction of the north jetty to the channel entrance of Tillamook Bay. Rock for the jetty was quarried near the Miami River and hauled by train 7 miles to the jetty site (Tillamook Herald, December 1, 191.4). The 5, 400 -foot -long jetty projected straight seaward from the base of the hills on the northern side of the channel. The essentially straight structure with a slight southward curve at its terminous has a crest height of approxi- mately 16 feet above mean lower low water. The north jetty was completed in October of 1917, utilizing a total of 429, 000 tons of stone at a total construction cost of $76,6, 000 (War Department District Engineer, 1940). Decline of Bayocean Park All outward signs pointed to the future prosperity of Tillamook and Bayocean Park; however, as time passed, the comparative prosperity and improvements to the resort were apparently not 41 sufficient as there were numerous complaints by investors. In 1914, complaints from land holders and investors grew (Olsen, 1937). The complaints culminated in charges that the enterprise was bankrupt; a petition was instituted for a -receiver (The Oregonian, December 11, 1914). Affidavits were filed by H. L. Chapin, general manager of the T. B. Potter Realty Company, citing that there was no cause for a receiver to be named, as the assets of the company were far in excess of the liabilities. Chapin submitted as evidence that 1, 648 lots had .been sold for $890, 336 and of this amount $573, 000 had been paid; that net assets were $929, 172 (The Oregonian, December 11, 1914). Although the Chapin evidence appeared convincing, the plaintiff's evidence was, strong enough that the judge appointed a receiver. S. B. Vincent was appointed receiver with three members of each opposing faction to work with him (The Oregonian, December 11, 1914). Another suit occurred in 1917 when dissatisfied stockholders im the Bayocean Natatorium Company, a stockholders' enterprise organized to construct the natatorium, charged the T. B. Potter company with fraud in an alleged misrepresentation of the value of property of its share of stock in the natatorium corporation (The Oregonian September 20, 1917). Years of litigation followed receivership and claims of fraudulent practices. The newspaper accounts of the alleged practices on behalf of T. B. Potter undoubtedly downgraded the creditability of the 42 T. B. Potter Realty Company and value of Bayocean Park property. Improvements to the resort came slowly. The depressed resortwas in operation; however, its isolation from. the automobile during an era of road building and increased auto access to other resorts further depressed Bayocean.Park (Olsen, 1937). The long litigation which clouded the affairs of the Potter Company appeared to be nearing settlement when, in 1926-1927, a group of Tillamook residents were reviewing the requirements .established by the court for assuming the assets of the T. B. Potter Company's Bayocean holdings. The court's requirements obligated new owners to construct a good road from Tillamook to Bayocean by April.1, 1927 and spend at least $100, 000 \" in general improvements, and in straightening out the affairs of the Potter Company\" (The Oregonian June 3, 1926). F. D. Mitchell, a long time reside.nt and investor in Bayocean Park, had long recognized the need for a road link to Tillamook if the resort were to establish economic viability. His attempts to induce public officials to aid in road building met with disappointment. Mitchell and his wife assumed the responsibility for completing a road. In July, 1926, they succeeded in their self-imposed task and completed a portion of a dirt and plank road to the resort (The Oregonian, July 18,, 1926). In July 1927, a revival of the deteriorating resort appeared 43 imminent as the road had been constructed and the group of Tillamook residents, recently organized under the name of the Tillamook- Bayocean Company, has assumed the entire assets of T. B. Potter's Bayocean Park holdings (The Oregonian, July 13, 1927); The acceptance of the court's terms for the settlement of the delinquent taxes and the agreement to build a road of market standard into Bay Ocean brings that resort, once the pride of Tillamook County's beaches, with its paved streets, huge natatorium and attractive summer homes and hotel a renewed bright outlook. The optimism was short-lived as the stock market crash and depres - sion of 1929 halted all hopes for revival of the resort. One by one, the cottages were abandoned, the hotel closed and numerous other structures were vacated (Olsen, 1937). -Depression Bayocean spit and resort remained essentially dormant from 1929 to 1933. Discussion was opened in 1933 for the construction of a south jetty. The proposed jetty would create a channel of ZZ feet depth at mean low water through the bar and a turning basin 20 feet deep at mean low water (Tillarnook Herald, February 23, 1933). Local interest was generated in support of the proposal. However, it appears that funds for the south jetty were diverted to the rehabilitation of the north jetty which was in need of repair after 13 years of weaken- ing by wave and tidal activity. The north jetty was also extended 44 300 feet for a total length of 5, 700 feet (War Department District Engineer., 1940). The depression did bring some interesting news regarding Bayocean Resort. In 1934, two or three families and several single men, drifters and products of the depression, obtained permission to move into the deserted Bayocean Hotel (The Oregonian, April 11, 1935). Recognizing the possibilities of their surroundings, they organized a communal living group, calling themselves The Artisans Cooperative Community. Work among its members was divided equally, men doing fishing and gardening, women cooking and house- work, children doing small chores. The colony found a market for some of their seafood products (The Oregonian, October 6, 1935). The efforts of the group came to the attention of Washington, D. C. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration granted the colony .$3, 900 to purchase fishing equipment and building materials. They were also given possession of a government owned 65-foot cutter docked at Astoria. With the new cutter the group planned to fish for tuna far off the Oregon coast (The Oregonian, October 6, 1935). The colony appears to have flourished for a short period of time and then .departed. No mention of the colony was found following the 1935 reports. One final glimmer of hope was presented to the investors of Bayocean Park when in 1936 the Wilson River Highway was opened 45 providing easy automobile travel between Tillamook and Portland (The Oregonian, December 6, 1936). The report states that the hotel which the Artisans' colony had taken occupancy of two years earlier, was totally gone, \"now nothing remains but a gapping foundation and stark reminder of what had been\" (The Oregonian, December 6, 1936). Property owners were warned that real estate men had been approaching the investors with discouraging reports about the resort and following with offers of small sums of money to assume owner- ship. The 1936 newspaper account clearly illustrates the deteriora- tion of the resort. A 193Z photograph of the undermined sidewalk fronting the natatorium is one of the first illustrations of erosion damage to resort structures (The Oregonian, December 6, 1936). Summary The historical evidence suggests that T. B. Potter did have grand designs for his Bayocean Park Resort.. However, the success of his plan required quick and easy access for city dwellers to the resort via the planned railroad to Tillamook. Potter did what he could to offset the three-year delay with the rail line's completion. He advertised widely and even transported Portlanders by boat to Bayocean. It appears, however, as though his efforts were inade- quate. Funds for promised resort improvements dwindled as sales 46 lagged. The ensuing years brought court actions and further decline until the depression of 1929 ended all hope for the ill-fated Bayocean Park Resort. 47 CHAPTER IV EROSION AND PHYSICAL CHANGES TO BAYOCEAN SPIT The decline of Bayocean Park up to the decade of the 1930's appears to have occurred as a result of poor developmental planning and the effects of a severe depression. Further deterioration of the resort and spit itself is believed to have begun as waves began to erode the spit, eventually undermining and destroying some of the large structures at Bayocean Park. Early Erosion It is difficult to assess, when noticeable erosion began on the spit. A discrepancy exists between Corps of Engineers r e por t s @' and T ac c ouht s of the residents. The Corps of Engineers maintains that not until 1930 was erosion of the foredune noticeable and not until 1937 did its rate of retreat become a threat to the residents of the spit (War Department District Engineer, 1930). This account conflicts with another state.- ment made several pages later in the sam.e publication in which the Corps explains that a total of 11 houses had either been destroyed or moved since 1927 (War Dept. Dist. Eng.., 1940). This latter declara- tion indicates that the threat to residents began in 1927 rather than 1937 as reported earlier in the same document. Moreover, the U. S. 48 Army C orps of Engineers reports storm damage to BayQcean spit in 1908, 190 9, 1915 and 1920 (War. Dept. Dist. Eng. , 1939). An exhaus - tive attempt to substantiate this information was unsuccessful. Residents of Bayocean Park contend that there was no erosion or property loss prior to 1932 .(see Appendix, p. 136 and 140). They maintain that erosion of the spit began following the rehabilitation and 300-foot extension of the north jetty in 193Z-1933. Photographs of 1932 and 1936 of the natatorium published in The Oregonian (December 6, 1936) show the progress of its erosional destruction. In 1932, the sidewalk fronting the structure was undermined and nearly gone. By 1936, the seaward portion of the structure had been undermined, weak- ening the walls and causing the roof to fall in. Figure 16 is an undated photograph of the natatorium taken sometime between the first on- slaught of erosion in 1932 and the roof destruction in 1936. The side- walk is totally destroyed and erosion was beginning to undermine the building itself. The photos of the natatorium destruction clearly show that erosion was not only threatening, but destroying structures on the spit prior to 1937. Dicken (1961) reports that a resident of the spit used stakes at an unknown location to mark the progress of erosion for a period of. 7 years, 1926-1933. He found that the rate of retreat of the foredune was an average of I foot per year from 1926 to 1931. The rate increased markedly to 6 feet per year during 1932 and 1933, coinciding with the 300 -foot lengthening of the north jetty. 4.9 A f _V V,6 s, Figure 16.

Corps of Engineers. 50 The Corps of Engineers maintained that the north jetty construc- tion and subsequent lengthening had little impact upon Bayocean spit. They countered the residents' claims with geomorphological evidence that the Oregon coast is undergoing a recessional change without the influence of man-made structures and that erosion may be normally expected anywhere on the coast (War Dept. Dist. Eng. , 1940). It is clear that the north jetty had trapped large amounts of sand and caused a rapid seaward advance of its northern shoreline (Figure 3 6, p. 94). It is difficult to assess whether the 300-foot extension to the north jetty reached some critical length depriving the spit of littoral sands, thus initiating its rapid erosion in 1932-1933. The problem is, there exists very little information regarding erosion of the spit prior to 1932-1933. The absenc-e of published erosion informa- tion suggests: (1) that little noticeable erosion had been occurring prior to 1932; (2) erosional destruction to the abandoned buildings such as the natatorium had been occurring but met with little concern. Within a few years of its completion, the north jetty had trapped an estimated 6, 000, 000 cubic yards of sand to the north of the structure (War Dept. Dist. Eng. , 1930). The concensus among the residents was that the littoral sands were prevented from reaching the spit and replenishing winter losses. They also believed that the jetty initiated added currents and offshore eddies which aided erosion of Bayocean spit (The Oregonian, February 19, 1939b). 51 A 1939 Corps of Engineers. report does acknowledge the possi- bility of a deflecting effect of the north jetty upon littoral sands (Huff, 1939). The report hypothesizes that southward drifting littoral sands may have been deflecting beach sands into deep water where they were lost to Bayocpan's beach and nearshore. Depth changes offshore from Bayocean spit indicate sand losses and offshore deepening (Figure 18). .From 1885 to 1939, the 3 -fathom contour migrated an average of 1, 500 feet closer to Bayocean's shoreline (War, Dept. DI-st. Eng. , .1940). Greater nearshore depths allow waves ofAncreased energy to approach the shore with less shoaling, refraction,. and energy loss. A greater 'concentration of wave energy in the nearshore zone would allow for increased beach erosion potential. .The apparent increased erosion rates of 1932-1933 alarmed the residents of Bayocean Park. They proposed that the construction of a south jetty would afford protection to the spit as well as benefit naviga- tion in the channel (The Oregonian, February 19, 1939b; War Dept. Dist. Eng. , 1941). Their reasoning was that a south jetty would trap sand to the south along Bayocean's beach front and replenish sand losses. Moreover, the suspected offshore currents created by the north jetty would be driven farther out to sea preventing the erosive effects of offshore eddies. The Corps of Engineers countered, explain- ing that they believed a south -jetty would create only local accretion south of its land connection and would be of no value to the protection pocific 0 c e c n 1885 .18.9f C) (D -1926 -1927 0 m --- 1939 - tri (D 0 CD '&4 yo C -Ti 1&4 (D CD 0 0 0 (D X 0 0 CO 00 C: U-1 ZZ m 1@8 @wTr>ll 53 of the inhabited portion of the spit (War Dept. Dist.. Eng. 194 1). Erosion - 1939 Erosion along much of Bayocean's beach occurred through the late 1930's. Erosion during the winter of 1939 was particulary severe and caused considerable damage. On January 3, 4 and 5, 1939, a severe storm and high tide combined to lash the spit. The Headligh Herald (January 5, 1939) details the destruction: At Bay Ocean, the ocean carried huge timbers, rocks and debris out onto the highway, blocking it in many places. Water poured through the gaps. water poured through in a torrent, digging a new deep furrow, carrying great boulders weighing a ton or more. Further on, at the second opening, the surf pounded along the beach tearing through,, bearing huge trees and rocks with it, the gap there becoming a part of the ocean at high tide leaving a C) drop of nine feet to the concrete road, leading to Bay Ocean City. The gaps discussed in the newspaper account are found along the narrow southern neck of the spit (Figure 19)... Two were awash with waves carrying debris and gravel into Tillamook Bay. The largest washover, Jackson Gap, was about 50 feet wide and 7 feet below the general ground level (Figure 17). Natatorium Gap had also been awash. The natatorium which stood on the seaward side of the gap had been totally destroyed (Figures 20 and 21). Considerable damage was done to the paved road along the foredune between Cape Meares and Bayocean Resort. The road's surface was littered with debris washed in by the high waves (Figures 22 and Z3). 54 0 tk Ar Natatorium Gap BAYOCEAN Rock Crush Gap _j Small Gap -Jackson Gap SCALE 1000 50 00 ft T 6- 3 Figure 19.

Army Corps of Engineers. 57 Subsequent high tides and storms in January and February of 1939 continued the destruction (The Oregonian, February 19, 1939b). During the winter of 1939, maximum recession of the top of the fore- dune bank was 25 feet, with an overall of 7. 3 feet for the entire spit (War Dept. Dist. Eng. , 1940). In the Village of Cape Meares, wave action had cut deeply into the clay seac.liff., later causing a slide of 150 feet long making a 60-foot indentation in the cliff. Sandbag, wood and concrete bulkheads had been built at various times to protect local areas along the foredunes; none withstood the onslaught and erosive action of storm waves. Nor did these various structures remain in place long enough to be considered at all effec- tive in retarding the erosion rate in the area which they were intended to protect (War Dept. Dist. Eng. , 1940). The conclusion of the 1939 erosion saw four houses undermined and destroyed, nine houses were in precarious positions, and six had been moved back from the foredune. The natatorium had been completely destroyed (War Dept. Dist. Eng. , 1939). There still remained approximately 30 dwellings at Bayocean, ten of which were permanently occupied. There were two small stores and an auto camp with 35 cottages located mid-way on the bay side of the spit. The 1940 population was 32 permanent and approximately 150 peak population during the summer (War Dept. Dist. Eng. , 1940). 58 The destructive erosion of January 1939 initiated much concern and fear, not only among residents and investors in Bayocean Park but also Tillamook citizens. The fear was not only of further erosional destruction but also of possible breaching of the spit. A breach in the spit would allow sand and gravel to enter the bay, covering shellfish beds, and would permit wave activity to disrupt shipping and flood low farm lands (Tillamook Herald, February 19, 1939b). A group of con- cerned citizens organized the Bayocean Erosion Committee (Appendix, p. 133). Their stated purpose was: To devise ways and means of securing protection against ravages of Pacific Ocean now going forward at Bayocean on the west shore of Tillamook Bay, which if let go will ulti- mately merge the ocean and bay following which certain destruction impends for all lowlands adjacent to bay which will include towns of Garibaldi, Bay City and eventually the City of Tillamook. Figure 28a (p. 71) is a mosaic of vertical aerial photographs of Bay- ocean spit taken May 8, 1939. The winter storms of 1939 had eroded much of the foredune of the spit and washed over the spit at Natatorium Gap (1) and Jackson Gap (2). The fear was that the narrow sand ridge would continue to erode and weaken while washovers widened and deepened the gaps, eventually breaching the spit. Figure 24 is a low oblique aerial view of the spit taken from a position inland of Cape Meares. The arrow points to lighter colored beach sands washed through the gaps and into the bay during former storms. The barren eroded seaward face of the foredune in 1939 is sharply z44 C@ td Cf) 0 U4 C, 6S 60 contrasted to the pre-erosion vegetated seaward face of the foredunes about 1910 (Figure 12). A shoal area nearly. one square mile Ln area is often marked by the wave activity within the channel. entrance to Tillamook Bay (Figure 25). The most severe waves are often formed at the seaward projection of the shoal just south of the end of the north jetty. The shoal is bounded on the north and south by relatively deeper channels with less wave activity. Both channels are believed to be formed by ebb and flow tidal currents. Both are plotted on USC and GS chart Figure 25; however, aerial photos taken of the spit over several years show the south channel is an ephemeral feature. Bayocean Boulevard, the main access road to Bayocean Park, was cut along the narrow sand ridge (Figure 26). At Jackson Gap, the road descended and turned bayward within the gap. Beyond the gap, the road continued northward to the park. Use of the gap as a con- venient turning point for the road may have increased its vulnerability to widening and deepening as the passage of vehicles would prevent vegetation growth and sand accumulation. Th-e road should have avoided use of the gap. The road should have descended the ridge south of Jackson Gap and have been diked along its bayward margin. Sand stabilizing vegetation should have been planted within the gap to trap all beach-derived sand. 61. w @7 Doi WX IN Figure 25. 1971 U. S.

A news - paper account details the conditions on the spit (The Oregonian, January Z8, 1940): The cuts made across the peninsula a year ago are being deepened and widened by the water of the ocean passing through, and the higher parts of the peninsula are being cut out continuously. More of the residences on the ridge have been endangered as to require their abandonment and others soon will be, at the rate of erosion. The Bayocean Erosion Committee appealed to state and federal representatives and, in one case, the President of the United States, for emergency assistance (Appendix, p. 140). Unfortunately, they received little support. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers prepared at least three research reports regarding erosion of Bayocean spit between 1939 and 1940. The largest and most comprehensive research report was pre - pared August 26, 1940, entitled \"Report on Beach Erosion Studies, Tillamook Bay, Oregon. 11 The report suggested four courses of action to retard the erosion (War Dept. Dist. Eng. , 1940): (1) Construction of a short south jetty to check the movement of longshore drift from Bayocean spit into the bay and afford storm wave protection to the channel and lower bay; (2) Construction of a full length south jetty to more positively check 64 the flow of longshore drift into the channel, better control the channel, and provide greater depths for navigation over the bar; (3) Construction of a groin, system throughout the length of the spit to preserve and trap beach sand; (4) Construction of a south entrance to the bay. The existing jetties would be allowed to deteriorate and close the present channel entrance. A new channel entrance at Jackson Gap would be stabilized by north and south jetties. It was hypothesized that such an improvement would result in accretion along Bayocean spit and eliminate storm damage at the present channel and north end of the bay as Cape Meares would provide better protection from storm driven southwesterly waves. The war years postponed work by the Corps of Engineers on the Bayocean erosion problem; however, erosion continued (Table 4). Table 4 shows that from 1939 to 1946 erosion was concentrating on the narrow sand ridge between Natatorium and Jackson gaps while the bank at station 146 along the northern one-third of the spit accreted. Figure 27 graphically illustrates the recession of the seaward face of the foredune by a series of surveyed cross-sections. The surveys were taken May, 1939, September, 1939, May, 1940 and January, 1946 at points along tlie beach shown in the inset map of Figure Z7. From May, 1939 to January, 1946, the foredune receded along the entire length of the spit where a pronounced vegetated 65 a Table 4. Top of Bank Changes .

North of station 159 + 94, the foredune bank lowered to a series of low profile berms rounding Kincheloe Point; it was here that shoreline accretion was surveyed between 1939 and 1946. Rela- tively small amounts of erosion were measured at station 159 + 94 and to a lesser extent at station 180 + 00, recession of the foredune increased abruptly to approximately 50 feet at station 200 + 00 and nearly 90 feet for station 220 + 00. Many of the major structures of the Bayocean Park Resort were located between these two survey stations. The most severe erosion attack from 1939 to 1946 occurred to stations 240 + 00 and 260 + 00 located mid-day on the narrow sand ridge. The foredune scarp retreated over 100 feet during the 7-year interval. South of station 260 + 00,. the erosion decreased to 50 feet at station 280 + 00; 20 feet and 30 feet respectively at stations 200 + 03 and 310 + 08. At many of the stations, not only did the seacliff retreat but the beach level was lowered as much as 10 feet. Two minor points of interest are exhibited by the cross-sections. The erosion from May, 1939 to May, 1940 at stations 200 + 00 and 280 + 00 accounted for nearly half of the total cliff recession from 1939 to 1946. The cross -sections also show that in all but one station, the foredune cliff has retreated parallel to its former slope angle. At station Z60 + 00 the retreat from 1940 to 1946 became subparallel as the erosion likely destroyed the crest of the sand ridge and its stabilizing vegetation, thus changing the angle of slope. 68 A survey and report were authorized by a resolution adopted September 16, 1946 by the Committee on Rivers and Harbors of the House of Representatives. The Corps of Engineers' report (Dept. of Army Corps of Engineers, 1946) reviewed conditions at Tillamook Bay and Bayocean spit and discussed- the four possible courses of action to retard further erosion of the spit which had been enumerated in the 1940 report. The opinion of the Corps of Engineers with respect to the suggested improvements was: (1) That the construction of either a short or full length south jetty would result in impounding of sand south of the jetty, but neither improvement would have an appreciable effect on the shorelines south of Natatorium Gap; (2) The construction of a system of groins and bulkheads would be an undertaking of such magnitude as to preclude any possible justification; (3) That the construction of a south entrance to the bay would be expensive and unnecessary from the standpoint of navigation. The Corps of Engineers made it clear that it was not going to undertake any projects to retard further erosion to the spit. Although the shoreline evidently continued to erode through 1946, the perception of any immediate increased erosion danger among some individuals had apparently declined since 1939. A 1947 newspaper report optimistically describes hopes for the revival of the resort (Headlight Herald, September 7, 1947): 69 Judging from the way people are buying property at Bayocean it will not be long before most of the desirable and usable lots which the County has long carried on the books for taxes will be back on the tax rolls as an asset to the County as well as the taxpayers. The old belief that Baypcean has been carried out to sea is being exploded and the more hardy souls who take time to look around and see what an enormous pile of sand is still to be washed away to eradicate Bayocean have come to the conclusion that it will be a long time if there is any further erosion at the rate that has been eroded in the past. The optimism for a revival of the resort was again held only briefly as one year later, Tuesday, November 2, 1948, a storm lashed the spit. The gaps along the narrow sand ridge were again awash with waves pouring into Tillamook Bay. Two new gaps were cut through the narrow sand ridge approximately mid-way between Jackson Gap and Natatorium Gap (Figure. 19). The largest newly formed gap, Rock Crusher Gap, was about 250 feet wide (The Oregonian November 7, 1948b). The erosion of the gaps undermined roads and severed the waterline. Storm, wind and high waves reap- peared Friday, November 5, 1948 to further erode the spit and isolate its 80 residents from the mainland, Food and water were ferried to the residents. Saturday, November 8, 1948, city engineers restored water service by attaching fire hoses to each side of the broken pipe and suspending it over the large gap (The Oregonian, November 8, 1948b). The following week storms battered the spit and endangered the aerial waterlines. Emergency preparations were made in the event the residents of the spit were isolated (The Oregonian, November 25, 1948e). A telephone cable was installed so the residents had some 70 means of rapid communication with the mainland. January Z, 1949, a major article on Bay6cean spit appeared in The Oregonian entitled \"A Queen Dies: Victim of Time and Tide\" (The Oregonian, January 2, 1949). It appeared as if the residents and investors of Bayocean finally had to acknowledge the downfall of Bayocean spit. Breaching of the Spit The 1939 fears of the spit's breaching became a reality on November 13, 195Z (The Oregonian, November 23, 1952b). Storm waves aided by high tides penetrated the.gaps, weakened and finally destroyed a 4, 000 foot long segment of the narrow sand ridge (Figure 28c). At high tide the water-filled breach was nearly three-quarters of a mile wide. At low tide the break became several smaller channels, the largest about 500 feet wide with a water depth of 6 feet. The ebb and flow of subsequent tidal periods deepened and widened the breach (The Oregonian, November 23, 1952b). Eight residents remained on the spit through November; in December two more residents were evacuated leaving the total resident population of Bayocean at six (The Oregonian, January 18, 1953). The breach severed all communi- cation between Bayocean and Tillamook, save by boat, A system of bonfire signals was established between the residents on the spit and the Coast Guard at Garibaldi in the event of an emergency (The Oregonian January 18, 1953).

During high tide, waves rolled through the break and spread out in a fan-shaped pattern. This action produced a troublesome surge action at both the south and north end, operations at the log-booming grounds had several log rafts broken up each winter. At the south end, levees along the lower reaches of the tributary rivers were weakened by the additional wave wash and threatened with complete failure or over-topping by salt water due to the increased tidal range and surge effect. Sand carried in by storm waves soon covered over one-third of the approximately 3000 acres of tide-lands leased for oyster beds. A natural channel along. the east side of the bay was shoaled to such an extent that rafting of logs could be accomplished only during the higher tides each day. The major portion of the tidal flow entered and departed through the new entrance. With the loss of scouring current action through the improved entrance, the remaining \"island\" portion of the peninsula spread to the north and northwest, threatening to choke off the federal nevigation channel along the north side of the bay. Inspection of Figures 28c, d, and e reveals the rapid growth of the sand plumes within Tillamook Bay and the. well-defined channel that resulted from the breaching of the spit. The rapid infilling of sand into the bay initiated fears among the Tillamook residents of lowland flooding (Headlight Herald, December 4, 1952a). Comparison of Figures 28c with 28d and e shows significant progradation of the 75 Kincheloe Point shoreline from August, 1953 to April, 1956. Follow - ing the break in the spit, Kincheloe Point extended by accretion of sand and gravel to the north and northwest, narrowing the usable channel to not over 150 feetat low tide (U.S. Congress, Senate, 195Z). The shoreline progradation probably resulted from decr,eased tidal scour and sub- sequent sand deposition as the breach assumed a large part of the tidal action (The Oregonian, January 8, 1953a). Figure Z9 illustrates the major shoreline changes to Bayocpan spit resulting from the breaching. As the sand plumes within the bay grew from 1953 to 1956, the shore- line adjacent to the breach receded significantly. Diking of the Breach Funds were made available in December, 195Z to the Corps of Engineers for field surveys and an economic study of the breach problem (The Oregonian, December 19, 195Za). The survey and study resulted in a $1, 500, 000 proposal to dike the breach. The plan called for a rock and sand fill to connect a point east of Cape Meares with the townsite of Bayocean (The Oregonian, September 25, 1953g). A federal agency is not empowered to spend money for the protection of private property. Therefore, Colonel T. H. Lipscomb, with a tone of urgency, recommended the following benefits from the closure of the breach: (1) preservation of existing navigation facilities; (2) saving of future maintenance expense; (3) protection of remaining oyster beds ITI OrQ ,D En @r 0 ID r) orq (D cn CD In GQ 0 UD Cl) rfl r.0 (.0 ..1956 0 @-h t3i 0 0 CD 9 L 77 and agriculture lands; (4) general benefits, including recreational advantages (U. S. Congress, Senate, 1952). In November, 1953, the Corps of Engineers board of review for rivers and harbors rejected the emergency action to close the Bay- ocean breach (The Oregonian, November 21, 1953h). Two months later, however, they reversed their. decision and approved construc- tion of a $1, 775, 000 dike to close the breach (The Oregonian, January 22, 1954). Further conditions contingent to the approval were that Tillamook Bay interests furnish without cost all land, easements and rights of way necessary for the construction, Moreover, local interests had to contribute 15 percent of the construction costs, an estfmated $250, 000. Final design studies and preparation of contract plans were begun in the fall of 1955 with the intention of awarding the contract in the spring of 1956 (The Oregonian, February 28, 1956a), It was realized that the closure of the breach h:@d to be completed in one summer season, for a partially completed dike would be severely damaged by winter storms. The alignment of the rock dike was set back from the beach line of Bayocean spit (Figure 28f). It was anticipated that the pocket in the shoreline formed by this setback would fill chiefly by erosion material from Bayocean spit and to a lesser extent by material moving northward from Cape Meares. With the pocket filled, it was expected that a more or less uniform shoreline would be reestablished forming a protective sand beach in front of the 78 dike. Figure 33a, b and c (p. 87-88) show that this assumption proved to be correct. Materials for the construction of the rock dike were locally available. Basalt riprap of sizes up to 5 tons was available from quarries at Cape Meares, armor stone of 2 to 5 tons size from a quarry on the Trask River. A relatively soft, friable sandstone was available from the ridge along the bay southeast of the site. Easy access encouraged use of this material capable of withstanding wave action for several seasons. The fine sand dredged from the north end of the dike site provided an adequate foundation material. The dredge site is visible in Figure 28f approximately 4, 000 feet north of the dike..s northern terminus. Figure 30 is an aerial view taken in 1955 of the remaining Bayocean Park buildings which occupied the southern end of the breached spit. Construction of the dike and necessary sand fill required razing of the structures. By October, 1956 (Figure Z8f) virtually all signs of the former resort had been destroyed. Some difficulty was experienced with engineering the closure; however, in the fall of 1956, the closure was accomplished. Holland beach grass was planted in November, 1956 to stabilize the sand fill to the north and northwest of the dike (Brown, 1958). Immediately following the closure of the breach, commercial fisherryien reported marked increases in tidal velocities in the naviga- tion channel and rapid erosion of sand bars which had been building 79 4@0@ A J Figure 30. 1955 aerial photo of breach. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 80 inside the bay since 1952 (Brown, 1958). Sand filling of the former embayment seaward of the dike has progressed as shown in Figur es 33a, b, and c. At times, high waves are able to wash into Biggs Cove; however, this appears to offer little immediate danger. Recent Erosion Since the 1956 closure of the beach, erosion has continued along much of the seaward face of Bayocean spit. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers has periodically surveyed the spit's shoreline changes. An abbreviated tabulation of their surveys is presented in Table 5. For cross reference purposes, station numbers 4 and 6 in Table 5 coincide with stations 146 and 1,90, respectively, for Table 4. Erosion has continued unabated save at station 2 where progradation of the shore- line occurred following the dike construction. Rapid rates of erosion are occurring north of the former breach site along a mile long stretch of the spit's mid-section. The continuing rapid rates or erosion at station 4 has raised some concern as it is the narrowest part of the spit, most subject to future breaching. The Corps of Engineers fore- sees the average rate of -15 feet per year declining as sand accretes south of the new south jetty, constructed from 1969-1971, slowing the erosion process (Figure 32).

South Jetty The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey maps for 1904 through 1971 illustrate the growth of shoals within the channel entrance .to Tillamook Bay. Figure 35 (p. 92) illustrates that the shoals extend northwesterly from Kincheloe Point with a small intervening channel. The shoals migrate within the channel entrance causing increased wave activity and turbulence. Winter conditions are most severe as south- wester ly storm waves break over the shoals making the entrance impas- sable for periods ranging up to 10 days (U. S. Congress, Senate, 19.65). The vessel delay has forced cancellation of water carrier service; moreover, the unpredictable channel conditions discouraged many fishing boats from basing at Garibaldi. As a result, Tillamook Bay suffered a decline in water-borne transport and fishing activities (U. S. Congress, Senate, 1965). The hazardous channel conditions which developed prompted renewed consideration for construction of a south jetty at the channel entrance to Tillamook Bay. Construction of a 3, 700-foot long jetty westerly from Kincheloe Point was commenced in April, 1969. As the construction progressed it was recognized that the large shoal the jetty was designed to contain extended well beyond the proposed length 85 of the jetty; the jetty had to be lengthened for more complete protection within the channel. Work is now underway to extend the south jetty by 2, 830 feet to a total length of 6, 525 feet with a projected completion date of October, 1974. It can be expected that the south jetty will modify the local .water currents and drift of sand on the beach at Bayocean spit. The Corps of Engineers predicted the following impacts of the south jetty upon the spit (U. S. Congress, Sena,te, 1965): It is believed that a south jetty at the entrance to Tillamook Bay would have a general beneficial effect on the shoreline between the jetty and Cape Meares, 6 miles to the south. Sand would be moved into the shadow of the jetty by northward littoral transport due to the draw of the inlet, thus causing accretion for a short distance south. The jetty would eliminate or greatly reduce the continuing loss of material into the inlet and consequently should have some beneficial effect on the shoreline south to Cape Meares. This effect would be accre-. tion for a short distance south of the jetty and a decrease in the erosio n rate within that area south to Cape Meares. The Corps of Engineers maintains that the south jetty will create a beneficial straightening of the Bayocean shoreline as demonstrated in Figure 32 with continued erosion in some zones and deposition in others. As illustrated, the beach near survey stations 146 and 190, which lie approximately 7, 500 feet and 11, 500 feet, respectively, south of the south jetty, will likely continue to experience erosion as this zone supplies sand to the accreting beach immediately south of the south jetty. 86 Figures 33a, b, and c illustrate the very rapid accumulation of sand that occurred in Z3 months during the first phase of construction of the south jetty from April, 1969 to June, 1971. Accretion appears to be continuing at a declining rate as shown in the aerial photographs for the two-year period, November, 1971 to February, 1973 (Figures 34a, b, and c). The August, 1972 photo reveals greater sand accumu- lation, typical of the summer period. More comparable are the November, 1971 and February, 1973 shorelines under winter condi- tions. Omitting some tidal and seasonal variations to the shoreline, the beach immediately south of the jetty has accreted approximately 400 feet seaward from November, 1971 to February, 1973. In summary, it appears that the south jetty will continue to impound sands to the south and cause a progradation of the beach. Erosion will probably continue along the narrow midsection of the spit and will require continued surveillance. Erosion and Deposition Summary Figure 35 represents mean lower low water shoreline con- figurations of Bayocean spit taken from United States Coast and Geodetic Survey charts for 1867, 1904, 1920, 193Z, 1949, 1960, 1965, and 1971. Very little change occurred between 1867 and 1904; however, between 1920 and I 93Z erosion is indicated by the narrowing of the southern sand ridge.

Only the northern part of the spit was revised in tile 1949 survey. This is unfortunate,. for the shoreline is known to have retreated significantly between 1932 and 1949. The 1960 and 1965 charts show the diked breach and subsequent filling and formation of a new shoreline west of the dike. Finally, the 1971 chart shows no revision since 1965 except for the projected position of the south jetty from Kincheloe Point. The construction of the north jetty resulted in the rapid prograda- tion of the shoreline to the north and west (Figure 36). The shoreline prograded approximately 2, 5.00 feet seaward within 3 years of its completion in 1917 (U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1970). It is sub - sequently receded as the jetty deteriorated and became less of a barrier to littoral drift. The shoreline again advanced after the jetty's 1933 restoration and 300 -foot extension. By 1940, the shoreline had prograded seaward a total of 3, ZOO feet; since that time it has remained relatively stable. Figure 37 represents shoreline changes to Bayocean spit as taken from 1939 and 1973 aerial photographs. Most of the seaward face of the spit has retreated several hundred feet since 1939. The most severe recession has occurred where the former narrow sand ridge connected Bayocean to Cape Meares.

Some people still hold claim and pay taxes on land formerly located on the narrow sand ridge. Their claims are now several hundred feet seaward of the present shoreline (Tillamook County Tax Assessor maps). The north- ward facing seacliff of Cape Meares appears also to have retreated between 500 and 100 feet during the 34-year period (1939 to 1973). Very recently, rapid shoreline progradation has occurred south of the new south jetty at Kincheloe Point. The shoreline adjacent to the jetty has advanced over 2, 000 feet since 1969. The shoreline will probably advance even farther as the jetty is lengthened. 97 CHAPTER V INTERPRETATION OF EROSIONAL AND DEPOSITION PATTERNS The purpose of this chapter is to identify and attempt to explain the erosional and depositional patterns that have developed along Bayocean spit and neighboring beaches. Historical shoreline changes presented in the previous chapter will serve as the primar@r evidence. Sedimentary sources and losses to Bayocean spit and neighboring beaches will be identified and, where possible, quantified to account for the major areas of beach erosion and deposition. Figure 38 is a schematic representation of sedimentary sources and losses to the spit and adjoining beaches. Such a \"budget of sediments'' is an application of the approach of Inman and Bowen (1966) who assessed various sedimentary contributions and losses to the nearshore zone in the area of Point Arguello, California. Budget of Sediments for Bayocean Spit Figure 38 illustrates the major potential sediment sources and losses to Bayocean spit. Potential sediment sources include: land- slide and headland erosion, and fluvial discharge. Major sediment losses are erosion to Bayocean spit, deposition in Tillamook Bay, and trapping by jetties. The identified sediment sources and losses to Bayocean spit will be discussed in order of the above presentation. (b Oro ri) ri) Cb ZZ, OOX ul 0 r) 86 99 Sediment Sources Landslide and Headland Frosion. Cliff erosion and landsliding at Cape Meares south of Bayocean spit appear to serve as sources of littoral sediments. Cape Meares is a 350-foot high promontory composed of basalt capped with terrace sands. The relatively slow but continual erosion of Cape Meares can be seen where areas of instability- -soil creep and debris fall- -contributes sediments to the surf below. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (War Dept. Dist. Eng. , 1940) conducted a petrographic analysis of beach sediments north and south of Cape Meares to determine the effectiveness of the Cape as a source of Bayocean beach sediments. On Bayocean spit, roughtly 20 to 25 percent of the minerals comprising the beach and bottom drill samples were minerals common to basaltic rocks. Thus, at least one-fifth to one-quarter of Bayocean sediments have been derived from basaltic sources. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (War Dept. Dist. Eng. , 1940) concluded that Cape Meares, because of its proximity, is the largest source of basaltic minerals. Twenhofel (1946) analyzed beach sands along much of Oregon's coast. He also suggested Cape Meares as the source of basaltic boulders and cobbles comprising the beaches north of the Cape and at Bayocean spit. Figure 39 outlines a large landslide on the north side of Cape Meares. Aerial photos for 1939 and 1955 showed no advance of the 100 k4l' t-o Figure 39. 1972 aerial view of landslide north of Cape Maeres. U. S.

Conversely, 1965 and 1972 aerial photos clearly illustrate mass movement onto the beach. Schlicker et al. (1972) discuss the landslide: A major landslide is located on the north side of Cape Meares. The slide is more than 300 feet long and 1000 feet wide; the elevation of the head of the slide is about 400 feet above mean sea level. The toe of the landslide is on the beach and erosion of the toe is rapid and continual. During the summer of 1971, a segment of the beach rose about 30 feet as a result of rotational uplift at the toe. The block was completely eroded by autumn. At the toe of the slide, trees lean ZO to 30 degrees seaward indicating the ground movement. The landslide is undoubtedly con- tributing much sedimentary material to the littoral transport. Fluvial Sediment Discharge Among the largest potential sedi- ment sources for Bayocean spit are the fluvial sediments carried down the five major rivers that empty into Tillamook Bay. The Langbein and Schumm (1958) method for estimating the sediment discharge was employed to quantify this sediment source. Langbein and Schumm (1958) correlated the effective annual precipitation to drainage basin areas throughout all the climatic regions of the United States (Figure 40). The effective precipitation eliminates that part of the total precipitation which is lost through evaporation and transpira- tion. Several studies have shown that sediment yield per unit area decreases with increasing drainage area, resulting from flattening ANNUAL SEDIMENT YIELD m3 sediment / km2 drainage area) On E5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 M V) M 0/ .1e.00, 0 ooe cyl 0 U) loe > M 0 z n -n M 0 CD rrl 0 , M Ln > 0 z 0 U) t7' M 2 Ln M 3 0 K 0 M z < 0 CD 0 z < M 0 ZD z > wl 0 90 oo, 0 201 103 gradients and lower probability that an intense storm will cover the entire drainage area. The curves of Figure 40 have been normalized to a drainage area of 100 kilometers utilizing the results of Brune (1948) which show that the sediment yield is inversely proportional to the 0. 15 power of the drainage area. In application, this effect of drainage must be taken into account. For example, if the drainage area of the river in question is 750 square kilometers, then the sediment yield rates by Figure 40 must be divided by the factor 0. 15 (750/100) = 1. 35 to obtain the proper yield rate for the area. Each point shown in Figure 40 represents an average of from 5 to 38 individual correlations grouped according to effective precipitation. The averaging has the effect of removing some of the variability due to differences in geology, degree of cultivation and vegetati"
