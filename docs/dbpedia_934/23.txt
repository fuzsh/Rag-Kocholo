He was the eldest son of Peregrine Bertie, 2nd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, and Jane Brownlow (a daughter of Sir John Brownlow, 3rd Baronet).[1] Among his younger siblings were Lord Albemarle Bertie (a gambler and sportsman who was blinded early in his youth), Brownlow Bertie, 5th Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, Lady Mary Bertie (wife of Samuel Greatheed), Lady Albinia Bertie (wife of Francis Beckford), Lady Jane Bertie (wife of Gen.

For some time in the 1750s, he sought to establish a series of mines in the upper Conwy valley in Wales. For this purpose, he engaged the German immigrant, Diederich Wessel Linden as his agent.[2]

He married, firstly, Elizabeth (née Blundell) Nicoll (d. 1743), widow of Charles Gounter Nicoll, on 22 May 1735. Elizabeth was the daughter of William Blundell of Basingstoke, Hampshire, whose mother, Alice Blunden, was the alleged victim of a notorious premature burial.

After her death in 1743, he married, secondly, Mary Panton, on 27 November 1750. Mary was the daughter of Thomas Panton of Newmarket, who was an equerry to King George II and master of the Thurlow Hunt. They had six children:[3]
