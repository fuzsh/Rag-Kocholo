On the north west wall of St Margaret's church Westminster is a memorial to Peregrine Bertie who died in 1721 and his wife Rachel. At the top is a coat of arms, and crest of the Barons Willoughby. The Latin inscription can be translated:

Sacred to the memory of Peregrine Bertie to whom the first Peregrine of the Berties, Baron Willoughby de Eresby, was great grandfather and Robert, First Earl of Lindsey was great-uncle. The former, on account of reformed religion of England, was born abroad and fighting stoutly for king and country without thought of yielding died an honour to himself and his posterity. This later Peregrine of ours, no unworthy descendant of such forebears, himself a worthy parent friend and husband leaving a wife, daughter of John Ernle, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and by her three children, died in the year of Our Saviour 1721 in the 67th year of his age. Near to him lie the bones of his father and mother Nicholas and Mary Bertie, and Rachel that devout delightful caring daughter, wife and parent alas too quickly following a devout husband is buried nearby. She died August 17 A.D. 1724 aged 63.

Peregrine was buried on 5th September 1721 and he and his wife were buried in the middle chancel area of the Church. The registers seem not to mention the burials of his parents.
