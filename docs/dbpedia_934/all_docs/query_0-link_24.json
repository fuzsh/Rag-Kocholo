He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\". His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare in Wikipedia\n\nLibraryThing author page\n\nThis is a general description. It is not a review."
