        "meta_description": "Wimpole Estate is a large estate containing Wimpole Hall, a country house located within the civil parish of Wimpole, Cambridgeshire, England, about 8+1⁄2 miles (13.7 kilometres) southwest of Cambridge. The house, begun in 1640, and its 3,000 acres (12 km2) of parkland and farmland are owned by the National Trust. The estate is regularly open to the public and received over 335,000 visitors in 2019.[1] Wimpole is the largest house in Cambridgeshire.\n\t\n\tHistory\n\tSited close to the great Roman road, Ermine Street, Wimpole was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086. At that time there was a moated manor house set in a small 81 hectares (200 acres) deer-park.[2] Situated to the north and south of this were three medieval villages: Bennall End, Thresham End and Green End.\n\t\n\tThe estate was held by the Chicheley family for over 250 years,[3] beginning in 1428 with Henry Chichele who was Archbishop of Canterbury.[4] The last of this family to hold the house was the politician Thomas Chicheley, who was responsible for the \"new\" house that was completed in 1650.[5] Chicheley established the \"formal gardens and architectural landscape\".[2] He enjoyed the house for 36 years until, weighed down by financial problems, he was forced to sell to Sir John Cutler.[6] In 1689, Sir John gave it as a marriage settlement to his daughter Elizabeth and her husband Charles Robartes, 2nd Earl of Radnor.[6] Lord Radnor extended the formal gardens and dug out fishponds.[2] On the death of Elizabeth in 1697, without an heir, the estate passed to Edmund Boulter, nephew of Sir John Cutler. In 1710 it was in the possession of John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, who left it to his daughter Lady Henrietta Cavendish Holles upon his death the following year.[7] Upon Henrietta's marriage, in 1713, it became the possession of her husband Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer.[8] In 1740, Edward sold Wimpole to Philip Yorke, Earl of Hardwicke, in order to pay off his debts.[9] The Earls of Hardwicke held it until it passed into the hands of Thomas Agar-Robartes, 6th Viscount Clifden,[10] and then his son, Francis Agar-Robartes, 7th Viscount Clifden[11] who, in 1930, departed to Lanhydrock upon the death of his father.[2]\n\t\n\tOn 27 October 1843, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert visited the hall. They listened to speeches by local politicians including the Earl of Hardwicke, and dinner was served for 26 people. A ball was held in the evening. On 28 October 1843, Her Majesty visited the farm in the morning before departing for London.[12]\n\t\n\tIn 1938, Capt. George Bambridge and his wife, Elsie, daughter of Rudyard Kipling, purchased it after having been tenants since 1932.[11][13] They used the inheritance left to them by her father, and the royalties from his books, for the long-needed refurbishment of the house and grounds. During the War, for instance, the house had no running water nor electricity.[13] During her time at Wimpole Hall, Elsie was known to become irritated by members of the public gathering too close to the house for picnics, so much so, she once returned to the offending couple's property and had her own picnic on their lawn.[13]\n\t\n\tOver the centuries many notable architects have worked on it, including James Gibbs (between 1713 and 1730), Henry Flitcroft (around 1749), John Soane (1790s), and H.
