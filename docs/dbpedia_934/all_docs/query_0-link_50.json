Witt Library, Courtauld Institute of Art. x\n\ncknowledgements\n\nhroughout my academic career at the various incarnations of Anglia Ruskin University, I wrote numerous essays, articles, and entries to reference works, and edited, and was included in, several collections; but until Mrs Delany re-entered my life in the late summer of 2009, I had never written a monograph or contemplated a biography, in spite of quite a lot of my essays being built around a single figure. It seems appropriate now to acknowledge a few of the people whose example and advice led me to this exception that proves the rule, as well as mentioning gratefully the help and collegiality which have brought this project to fulfilment. The first person I should mention is a teacher whose name I no longer remember, and who was not an historian or writer of any kind. For sixth form I attended King’s High School for Girls in Warwick – yes, the female counterpart to the school attended by Mrs Delany’s three nephews. It was re-founded in 1879 to add to the number of grammar-type schools for girls who wanted the same – or nearly the same – grounding in mathematics, classics and the sciences as their brothers had been receiving since AD 914. On Friday afternoons we were allowed to choose between art, music, sport and needlework; I chose the latter. We were not required to sew the same garment but whatever we had chosen, we had to make it to the highest standards of our teacher, who gave us plenty of expert tips. I was soon making a matching coat and dress for a family wedding; I can still recall the particular shade of blue I chose. But I took a short cut with the lining causing the top and bottom colour of the seams’ lining thread, which would be completely invisible when the garment was finished, to have a white xi\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nas well as a blue thread. I had to undo this and start again with the correct colour on both pieces of material. Well. This was a counsel of perfection! It made me realise that I might like the creative part best – choosing pattern and cloth, cutting out and fitting – but that you always need a third set of skills, the finishing off, and this is where I was inclined to tail off with a slapdash, ‘won’t this do?’, attitude. But a benchmark had now been irreversibly set and, as skills are transferable, every piece of subsequent writing has made me switch gear into perfectionist mode and follow the guidance on referencing and bibliography required by different publishers. In the case of Yale I have been incredibly fortunate in a talented team. First came Marika Lysandrou, who kept a steady hand on the tiller throughout and quickly enlisted a typesetter when Microsoft upgraded and closed access to earlier versions. She also inaugurated the initial round of slimming my manuscript, and expertly advised on improving the Introduction. Rachael Lonsdale was an eagle-eyed and very patient editor, and Sophie Richardson not only sorted out systematic referencing but miraculously managed to shave off six words here and twenty words there to reach an appropriate word length when I could no longer see for looking. Finally, Matt James assisted with obtaining illustrations and permission to reproduce them. Sparing the reader the full story of my intellectual formation at King’s High School, I will mention only that the sixth form culture encouraged wide reading and engagement with current affairs, just as Mme LePrince de Beaumont did for her pupils, as the reader will find out. One thing we debated vigorously was C.P. Snow’s essay on the two cultures, which made me recognise and regret how divided A-Levels were between the humanities and the sciences at that time. I was studying English, History and Latin at A-Level. But the literature curriculum was never restricted to a few set texts – we didn’t even read them until the second year – so we all knew that Romanticism included a large number of writers, for instance Mary Shelley as well as her husband. (These days it’s the reverse: most students know a lot about Gothic literature and Frankenstein, but are barely aware of Percy Bysshe either as a poet or a literary critic.) Much later, my Anglia Ruskin colleague Professor Nora Crook roped me into helping edit Mary Shelley’s essays on French literature, leading me to delve into the era of Louis XIV and letter-writers such as Mme de Sévigné, and many other writers of the seventeenth century that Mary Delany knew and loved. xii\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nAt King’s High there was a cultural rebellion brewing against Oxford, which our headmistress had attended, and the Leavisite diet of Cambridge English – i.e. literature and its cultural and historical background. I abandoned the goal of Law and reading for the Bar. Part I English proved something of a disappointment but I knew that a Part II option existed in History and Philosophy of Science, which proved a tremendous gateway to the more rounded kind of cultural history I had been seeking. Eventually, I had the enormous privilege of studying for a year with Professor R.A. Leigh, the editor of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s correspondence, and one of the greatest European scholars of his time. Who knew that his magnum opus would help me understand the attractions of Rousseau to Mrs Delany’s brother so many years later, and show me that a decent immersion in a collected correspondence would include not only letters to and from the main subject but also between third parties about the main subject. At this point I barely knew what I was doing – essentially a History of Science project – so it was very daunting when Professor Leigh commented that if I admired Voltaire so much, why didn’t I emulate his wit? Imagine! I was only about twenty-four at the time! However, here was a second example of extremely high standards, this time of scholarship rather than needlework. And it turned out that Professor Leigh was a great cat-lover, so that made him seem less daunting. I hope that some Attic salt does get sprinkled through the pages these days too. Later academic debts are owed to Roy Porter, who made me write on Swiss Romanticism; Jane Rendall for her mentoring on women’s history; Mary Abbott for introducing me to family history; Frances Harris and Elaine Chalus for illuminating conversations; Amy Meyers and Amanda Vickery for roping me into an exhibition, then inviting me to be a Senior Research Fellow, at Yale Center for British Art; Jonny Yarker at Lowell Libson & Jonny Yarker Ltd, for helping me understand the eighteenth-century art world as well as the contemporary one. On a more personal note, there are many friends I need to thank not just for being friends, in many cases for a lifetime, but for their practical help and wisdom. Chronologically, the first was probably Helen Sykes, whom I have known since we were both recent graduates needing to find our footing in the world of work. She established herself in East Sheen and has been a long-time hostess when I visited my many friends in south-west London over the years. It dawned on me eventually that however hard I tried I would never feel fully at home in Cambridge, despite the many advantages there were for my professional role, such as a firstxiii\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nclass research library for which I had borrowing rights a mere ten-minute cycle from my home, and a ten-minute walk to work. This was simply a geographical issue – I never felt at home under East Anglian skies. Eventually I recognised this was incurable and one New Year, we discussed the fact I should do some research about selling up in Cambridge and relocating to the Thames Valley. Within a year this came about and there I was, warmly welcomed into her vibrant extended household and neighbourhood. This included the gentlemanly Obi and the hyper energetic rescue-cat Pixie, who was expected to grow up lean and lithe but somehow turned out a little fuller of figure. Helen swung into action as hostess and provider of invaluable contacts. First of all this meant that a terrific team of Polish craftsmen, headed by the inimitable Adam Jackowski, immediately started work and within a week I had a functioning library and a study. Grown women paled at the scale of unpacking that remained, as the house was much like a Rubik’s cube: one could seem to sort things out in one area without much appearance of anything being assimilated. But it was a start, and eventually there was a net reduction of bag and baggage, and the rediscovery of my jewellery in the last box to be tackled. My house is en-route to the seventeenth century Ham House and the family that runs the ferry across the river still speak of Mrs Delany’s cousins, the earls of Dysart, attempting to oust them in the 1880s as though it all happened very recently and not about 140 years ago. It is not improbable to think that Mary walked very near my home as she certainly knew the wife of one of her Dysart cousins and the 3rd Earl and Countess of Bute, who resided in the street parallel to mine. I am grateful for many warm welcomes in the neighbourhood, including from the Parry Wingfields, busy trustees of Turner’s House, and the Reverend Jeff Hopkin Williams of St Mary’s parish church. Also deeply rooted among my acquaintances is the Hayward family, Charles, Julie and their sons Guy and Hugh, who after briefly living in Cambridge moved to Bath. I couldn’t number my visits there in total, but they have often been combined with working visits when I was using the Lansdowne Archives at Bowood House near Calne, and later on the Newport Public Library where the manuscript versions of Mrs Delany’s letters and autobiography are stored. I could not have asked for more congenial company to look at the manuscript originals and, as I am a non-driver, Julie kindly drove me to several Delany-related locales. I am grateful to the vice-chancellor of St Mary’s University, Twickenham, for accepting me as Senior Visiting Fellow, and to Professor Glenn Richardson xiv\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nfor facilitating this. It was invaluable to have all of Horace Walpole’s correspondence available through open access and to have up-to-date IT for processing electronic proofs. Dr Emma Jay was the first to read the complete version of Mrs Delany, an heroic task given its original length. As always, libraries and rare book collections have been indispensable adjuncts to all stages of research. I must thank the staff at Cambridge University Library, the Huntington Library (Brenda in particular) and British Library Prints and Manuscripts, especially Kim Sloan for a happy, sunny summer looking at the original paper-cuts pictures.\n\nxv\n\nxvi\n\nJohn Carteret 2nd Earl Granville and 2nd Earl of Bath statesman = (2) = (1) Hon.

Superficially she seems isolated, impoverished and resigned to her fate as long-grieving widow. John Opie’s 1782 painting of Mary as an elderly woman would memorialise her in history, but shows Mary in only one light, and, as such, misrepresents her. Opie was not alone in perceiving Mary to be a poor, friendless widow. Her friend, Lady Louisa Stuart, when recollecting who had benefited from George III, drily observed: We are told that the king heard by chance of an old gentlewoman of the name of Delany in distress and made some provision for her . . . All in charity you would think – the old gentlewoman who bye-the-bye was née Granville and the last of that noble family had been familiarly known to the K and Q for several years, and peculiarly the object of their respect and affection.1\n\nMary was far from the charitable case she was made out to be by her later contemporaries – an image that has held fast in public perception. She was, in fact, a vibrant, multi-talented and well-connected woman throughout her long life. She was not solitary: she was constantly at the heart of family life and something of a matriarch with four nieces and nephews, several great-nieces and nephews and two godchildren who had children of their own. Mary took her role as godmother seriously, and among her own kin ensured the Granville name was preserved. Most importantly, in her later years, between 1\n\nMRS DELANY\n\n1772 and 1782, the time of Opie’s portrait, Mary Delany invented an extraordinary new kind of flower portraiture by using collaged paper cut-outs on a black ground. This new art form in turn gave her great esteem in her circle of intimates, who also admired her skill as a letter-writer. Mary Delany’s collages are the achievement for which she is best known today, a result of Ruth Hayden’s 1992 charming biography, still the best short introduction to her, and the 2009 Yale Center for British Art exhibition. But despite her success, Mary did not regard the collages as true art, and was always of a mind that friends like the connoisseur and scientific patron Margaret Cavendish-Bentinck, 2nd Duchess of Portland, or her sister Anne, were much more knowledgeable than she was about plants. Arguably, Mary even preferred collecting fossils and shells to making what became known as the Flora Delanica, twenty of which were given to the queen. Far from being the central achievement of Mary’s existence, her paper cut-outs were a by-product of her life as an amateur artist working in oils, pencil and crayons, and as a talented decorative artist who enriched her homes and those of her friends. As a young woman, Mary Delany defied expectation. She first became a widow at the young age of 24, and, instead of quickly remarrying as would have been the norm in Georgian society, soon adapted to single life and relished her independence. In about 1742 Mary’s Anglo-Irish friend Anne Donnellan wrote a penportrait of Mary as a ‘Contented Aspasia’. The term was derived from a legendary classical figure, the companion of the Greek statesman Pericles, but in the eighteenth century was used to denote a cultured, wise woman with great conversational gifts, and with no overtones of a sexual nature. But Mary’s contentment was hard won, and seemed especially unlikely after her uncle, Lord George Lansdowne, had mismanaged her original marriage settlement. As a happy single woman, Mary may not have had to earn her living in the modern sense, but she hated being idle and was extremely self-disciplined with her time. She was a keen observer of fashion and designed many of the dresses she wore at court. She was also as keenly observant of manners and morals as she was of landscapes pictures and gardens. She was a stickler for propriety but did not believe that being a good Christian meant leading an ascetic life. Being profoundly devout did not mean being dull. Mary was well-read and interested 2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nin the status and education of women, the nature of marriage and even whether women ought to marry at all. The term ‘feminist’ had yet to be invented, but there were already conversations between moralists, opinion formers and theologians about how to regulate sexual behaviour and what made a happy marriage. These were directed more to women than to men, but questions about both sexes were in the air, and Mary never stopped pondering them and observing how variously women experienced wedlock. And so a portrait of Mary’s life, and the circles in which she moved, sheds much light on the wider issues and debates of the day. The first part of this biography will explore how Mary’s talents developed and how her familial and personal resources, spiritual, intellectual and cultural, enabled her to become a pattern gentlewoman in a libertine age, an era that could be brutally exploitative of young women, many of whom were more vulnerable than Mary. She never found herself in financial straits (even so her relatives tried to obtain a courtier role for her, with a salary and a pension); indeed she was more worried about how to find formal positions and thus financial security for two of her Granville cousins. As to marriage, Mary had more than eight proposals during the course of her lifetime, and most of them were from entirely suitable and sometimes well-off suitors. But she turned them all down, sometimes to the annoyance of men who thought they knew what she wanted better than she did herself, and often to the frustration of her family. The question then arises, if she was so happy to stay unmarried, what was it about Patrick Delany, an Anglo-Irish clergyman and noted public intellectual in Dublin, that in 1743 he persuaded her to change her mind? The second part of the book explores how Mary became an Anglo-Irish wife, how her new husband put his egalitarian principles into practice, how their marriage turned out, what their households in Dublin and County Down were like and how much her nieces, nephews and godchildren meant to her, as well as friends of long standing who recurred during her long life. The third and final part of this book looks at how Mary became a matriarch, and how she ensured that the Granville name would be perpetuated. She was pleased to be an artist praised by Horace Walpole for inventing her new form of art. Not everyone in her extensive network of relatives and connections will be 3\n\nMRS DELANY\n\ndiscussed – if they were, this book would be too heavy to pick up – but I hope something of an intricate web of kin and friendship can be glimpsed, as well as the many-faceted character of her simultaneous interests, as we follow her dance through the music of time. In 1861–2 Mary’s great-great-niece Lady Llanover introduced her to the mid-Victorian reading public by publishing two substantial volumes of letters from the family’s collection. This is a great resource, which will be drawn on throughout the book. Although the oeuvre has been endlessly cherry-picked for quotes on Georgian social and cultural life (frequently cited out of context by subsequent historians), it nonetheless sheds light on the wide number of figures Mary was related to and met, including the young John Wesley; the flamboyant Georgiana, 5th Duchess of Devonshire; and composers, writers and philosophers such as G.F. Handel, Jonathan Swift, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Charles Burney together with his daughter Frances. The Llanover volumes present a rich selective picture, as so many intimate letters were destroyed because of conventions of decorum, and still others because they revealed too much of a patron–client society constantly engaged in string pulling. The biographer becomes constantly aware of these gaps, but nonetheless hopes her readers will enjoy this exercise in making Mary’s wider context, and particularly her musings on marriage and family life, more evident.\n\n4\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\niss ary ranville\n\nne morning in mid-November 1715 15-year-old Mary Granville was asleep with her 9-year-old sister Anne – they were sharing a bed, a very usual custom for the time – when her parents’ house in Poland Street, London, was disturbed. Her first thought was that she was being woken up early to continue her sittings for a portrait commissioned by her father, but instead there were two armed soldiers in the room. ‘I shrieked with terror, and started up in my bed. “Come, Misses,” cried one of the men, “make haste and get up for you are going to Lord Townshend’s” ’ – the new Whig Secretary of State, one of two responsible for security and foreign affairs. Mary recalls that as she cried out, the soldiers tried to calm her, and the maid was allowed in to help the sisters dress. The sisters found that at least twenty soldiers had entered the house, and their mother was equally shocked and hysterical. Mary recalled that her father, Colonel Bernard Granville, tried to soothe the whole family. He knew that his imminent abrupt departure to the country, which had clearly been leaked to the authorities, was chiefly to economise. At this juncture, Mary’s aunt, Lady Anne Stanley, arrived, and insisted on being let in. A former Maid of Honour to Queen Mary II, co-monarch (1688– 94) with her husband William (1688–1702), Lady Anne was now housekeeper, that is, manager, of Somerset House, the palace given to royal consorts – an honorary not a menial position. Her intercession was effective, and within a short time the girls and their parents were travelling along terrible muddy winter roads to the depths of the Gloucestershire countryside – a journey that took five days. Their glory days in the metropolis were over. 7\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nHow had it come about that Mary’s father was suddenly leaving London with his family in an apparently suspicious manner? His great-uncle, John, 1st Earl of Bath, had succeeded in getting ever closer to the centre of British politics and the royal court, and now a spate of deaths and childless marriages was bringing Mary’s branch of the family close to inheriting his title. What had gone wrong? Answering these questions entails following of the intertwined fortunes of the Granvilles and the royal Stuart dynasty in the first fifteen years of Mary’s life, and the reckless misjudgement of her uncle Lord George Lansdowne, which was at the root of the problem.\n\nA WILTSHIRE CHILDHOOD\n\nMary’s parents had been married since 1690 the year when King William’s victory at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland had secured the Protestant succession and prevented a French-supported invasion by the deposed James II from establishing any ‘Jacobite’ claims there. It would have seemed a propitious moment for a serving officer, albeit the youngest son of a younger son, to marry and become a ‘spare’ Granville, and to strengthen the family succession, from descendants of the 1st earl’s brother. None of Bernard’s brothers was married yet, and his eldest cousin John was childless. Bernard’s bride was Mary Westcombe, daughter of the former consul in Cadiz, Martin Westcombe, who had been knighted for his services and had an estate in Gloucestershire. It is impossible to know whether this was a love-match or a partnership of strategic calculation or something in between, as almost no papers have survived. Young Mary’s memory of the contrasting responses of her parents to the dramatic departure from London in 1715 is virtually the only description of the chemistry between the two: he affable and calming, she more highly strung – not a bad balance. The silences about Mary Westcombe are, however, deliberate, since the marriage concealed a secret that remained hidden until research by Dr Francesca Suzanne Wilde in the papers of Mary’s descendants. The fact is that it was Mary Westcombe’s second marriage – and her first one had been very irregular, and not really a marriage at all: she had been a mistress of Ireland’s only duke, the princely seigneur James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, who was also Bernard’s former commanding officer.1 All that can be gleaned from the surviving papers is that having wooed her as though he was single, some kind of financial settlement was made to Mary Westcombe, and 8\n\nMISS MARY GRANVILLE\n\nthat this was deemed to be a dowry and/or a pension for Bernard’s military services, to be paid from the Ormonde estates. Marriage of a regular sort was unavailable, as the duke was already married legally.2 But it would be consistent with the code of honour of a man like Ormonde to treat his mistress as the gentlewoman that she was. Clearly Westcombe did not repudiate his daughter for her ‘lapse’ from strict virtue. When she and Bernard Granville married, her father allowed them to live in his house in London’s Holles Street.3 It must be underlined how fortunate Mary Westcombe had been to have had a surviving father who seems to have protected her interests, and to have found an affable spouse from a good family after her amorous interlude with a grand seigneur. Such was seldom the case for women, even gentlewomen, in her situation. In 1700 when Mary, the third child of Col. Bernard and Mary, was born on 14 May, her parents were living in a small estate in a village in Wiltshire, two counties further east than the Granville family base, Stow, on the border of Devon and Cornwall, which had been lavishly rebuilt after the Restoration by the 1st Earl of Bath. East Coulston was about 25 miles south-east of Bath, which was already visited for its reinvigorating waters. Coulston was a tiny village of sixty-two adults in 1676.4 Why her father had chosen to acquire or rent a small estate there is unknown. But one good reason was that it was only a few days journey from London, yet it was less expensive, and may only have been a summer residence when Parliament was in recess, before important families returned to the capital when parliamentary and legal life revived in November. Another reason for choosing Coulston was that it was the home of one branch of a large Cornish family, the Godolphins, with whom the Granvilles were well acquainted, through their overlapping networks at court and in the army, and this would prove congenial company for Mary’s mother whenever her husband was absent. The Granvilles and the Godolphins were both Norman French in origin, reaching Cornwall soon after the 1066 conquest. The latter’s wealth derived from tin mines more than farming and their family seat was near Helston in the far south-west of Cornwall. If the Granvilles were known proverbially for their loyalty to the crown, the Godolphins were famous for their wit – a term used at that time to denote quick, adroit intelligence, not just a capacity to amuse. By 1700, an Elizabeth Godolphin and her husband and cousin Charles had inherited the Manor House in Coulston. They were childless but had adopted a great-niece of Charles’s, whom they brought up as their own daughter. This was 9\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nnot uncommon in the eighteenth century and would have been an early example to young Mary of how important a great-aunt could be. With further inherited wealth the Godolphin couple each founded a school; Elizabeth’s was for the daughters of poor gentry, and still flourishes today as a private school for girls emphasising high academic standards and leadership qualities. Charles Godolphin’s brother was Sidney Godolphin, created 1st Earl of Godolphin in 1706, and one of the greatest statesmen of the era following the Glorious Revolution of 1689, described as ‘Glorious’ as it was relatively peaceful. James II had been ousted in favour of his daughter Mary and her cousin and husband William III. When out of office Godolphin mixed increasingly with the future Queen Anne, and her favourites, Sarah and John Churchill; once Queen Anne came to the throne, and with a strong recommendation from the Churchills, she made Sidney Godolphin Lord High Treasurer. A second key political figure after Godolphin was Robert Harley, who had all the vices and virtues of a deal-maker trying to hold contrasting strong personalities together in the cause of stability. In due course Harley’s granddaughter, Margaret, would become the 2nd Duchess of Portland and Mary’s great friend. The third in the ‘Triumvirate’ was John Churchill, soldier, diplomat and future duke.5 For Mary’s parents it was exceptionally useful to know the kin of such a powerful statesman as Godolphin, who was also a man of great integrity, Anglican piety and devotion to the public administration. Although he was familiar with the libertine court of Charles II and not immune from its gambling mania, Godolphin found that his wife, the devout Margaret Blagge, had helped him keep his religious faith steady. Margaret had had a close platonic friendship with the horticulturalist and civil servant John Evelyn, and there was a member of the Evelyn family living in Coulston as well, to add to the small circle of the genteel.6 In financial terms Mary’s parents were not all that wealthy, but in social terms they belonged to a thick web of family connections formed from Cornish relatives, together with political and military associates. They would provide Mary not only with valuable ‘social capital’ in the form of useful connections at the top of British society, but also some genuine, lifelong friends.\n\nWAR AND PATERNAL ABSENCE\n\nWithin eighteen months of Mary’s Wiltshire birth, a series of deaths in her own family and those of the royal families in Britain, Spain and Germany quite liter10\n\nMISS MARY GRANVILLE\n\nally changed her life and that of the nation. The deaths meant on the one hand that Mary’s branch of the Granvilles came ever closer to inheriting the earldom of Bath; but, equally, as army officers, they were in danger of losing their lives in defending British claims to the throne. For the British, the first significant death was that of William, Duke of Gloucester, Princess Anne’s longest surviving child, who died in 1700, aged 11, following his birthday party. Louis XIV now withdrew his prior recognition that William III was ‘in fact’ (de facto) the king on the British throne, by recognising as a superior claim that of James II’s son, James Stuart, as the true heir by right (de jure). ‘Jacobites’ like Denis Granville, great-uncle of Colonel Granville and a high-ranking churchman, accepted this, and when James II died in 1701 Denis considered the rightful king to be James III, crowned or not, and in spite of his being a Catholic. He and some Anglicans believed they could not repudiate their allegiance to James II and his offspring while they were alive. But most English folk wanted to keep the throne Protestant and accepted Parliament’s nomination of Sophia, Dowager Electress of Hanover, a direct descendant of James I, and her heirs as the rightful Protestant rulers, who would take over after Princess Anne succeeded her brother-in-law William on the English throne in 1702. On the wider European stage, conflict was looming between the French dynasty, the Bourbons, still under the leadership of Louis XIV, in alliance with the Spanish Habsburgs, led by Carlos II in Spain, and their opponents in the Austrian Habsburg monarchy, led by Leopold I. Based in Vienna, the latter included a variety of inherited lands, such as the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia. Intermarriage between the two Habsburg branches had made Carlos infertile, crippled and an imbecile – but he had nonetheless been king for thirty-five years. As his death finally seemed imminent, various attempts to partition the vast and varied Spanish inheritance (which included land in the Americas as well as the Philippines) or to find a neutral candidate had failed, and when he actually died in 1700 Carlos opted to leave all the hereditary lands to either the French Bourbon candidate, Philippe, Louis XIV’s younger grandson, or Leopold’s younger son, Karl. For the English, this meant their chief political and colonial rivals, the Bourbon dynasty, would be ruling two powerful adjacent kingdoms. War with the Bourbons became almost inevitable, and the last years of William III’s reign were spent constructing a military alliance between Britain, the Austrians and a number of German princes, including the Hanoverians, to challenge the Bourbons on behalf of Karl. As 11\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nJohn Granville said in Parliament in 1701 after the young Duke of Gloucester had died, the nation should rally ‘for the safety of England, the Protestant religion and the peace of Europe’. In the new year he drew up an address pledging support against the claims of the ‘pretended Prince of Wales’ – that is the Jacobite ‘James III’ – and to reduce ‘the exorbitant power of France’.7 The war that ensued, the War of Spanish Succession (1702–13), would establish Britain as one of the great powers of Europe. From having had few continental involvements, the country would begin to achieve an astonishing range of victories. Successful generals and admirals would attain peerages and wealth, so the war gave new opportunities, as well as risks. But equally significant for Mary’s life, this war was the context in which her other uncle, the poet and playwright George, Lord Lansdowne, would move into a successful political career, serving eventually as Secretary at War – the minister responsible for the administrative support of the English military and naval forces – and get his own English peerage title at long last. As with the European monarchs, the older generation of Granvilles was leaving the scene: in 1701, Mary’s grandparents died, then her great-uncle John, the Earl of Bath since 1660 when the monarchy had been restored after the civil wars and the republican interlude of 1649–60. Great-uncle John and his cousin, General Monck, had been central to this Restoration and both had been elevated to the peerage.8 As 1st Earl of Bath, John Granville successfully began reconstructing the Granvilles’ wealth and standing. But the 2nd Earl of Bath, Charles, died two weeks after his father. With cousins John, Bevill and George all unmarried, Mary’s father Bernard, and her eldest brother, also Bernard, moved closer to inheriting a peerage. By the time Mary was 3 her father and uncle were once more on active military service. Bevill had gained the favour of William III during the Flanders campaigns, in the build-up to the war with Spain, and the king made him Governor of Barbados in the West Indies. The appointment was confirmed by Queen Anne, and in 1703 he set sail, taking his brother Bernard with him. Their tour of duty lasted until 1706, but sadly Bevill died on the voyage home, aged only 41. With Mary’s father and other uncle on active duty as soldiers, George would be the acting head of the family. He now repositioned himself to enter political life, and also pursued his literary career as a poet and playwright. Mary would be as proud to be the niece of a writer who was considered to have inherited the mantle of the Poet Laureate, John Dryden, just as much as she was proud to 12\n\nMISS MARY GRANVILLE\n\nbe the daughter and niece of brave soldiers. George had exquisite French manners, literary sensitivities and dreamy allegiances to a tiny handful of beloved, idealised mistresses. His literary talents were a political asset, as public issues could take cultural form, in various media – literature, plays, opera, even garden design.9 UNDER THE SIGN OF MINERVA : THE APPRENTICESHIP OF A MAID OF HONOUR\n\nFor Mary, her mother and her siblings, it must have been an intense relief to have Bernard home, unscathed. But it may also have been a challenge to assimilate him into the dynamics of their household. Mary was now 6, so those first formative years in any child’s life had been spent without a consistent paternal presence. Paternal authority might well have been invoked in disciplining her, along the lines of ‘your father will not like that kind of behaviour when he comes home’, but exhortations to please an absent father, who may have seemed a very hazy figure in her life, may not have been all that effective. In her autobiographical fragment she recalled that her Aunt Anne found her impetuous as a teenager: Her penetration made her betimes observe an impetuosity in my temper, which made her judge it necessary to moderate it by mortifying my spirit, lest it should grow too lively and unruly for my reason. I own I often found it rebellious, and could ill bear the frequent checks I met with, which I too easily interpreted into indignities, and have not been able wholly to reconcile to any other character from that day to this; nevertheless, the train of mortifications that I have met with since, convince me it was happy for me to have been early inured to disappointments and vexations.10\n\nMary also recalled, though, how much she loved her father and wanted to please him: ‘I loved him excessively, and admired everything he said and did.’ He disapproved of young women who were too extrovert and immodest: ‘He loved gentleness and reserve in women.’11 She would please both parents by being prepared for a court career. Monarchs had a formal household, or court. A Maid of Honour could expect to have her dowry paid for by her employer and being at court would give her and her family a wider ‘pool’ of potential husbands. The Lord Chamberlain’s department had a 13\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nwhole range of subordinate departments, and Sir John Granville became Groom of the Stole. He therefore managed the most immediate attendants on the king, his Gentlemen and Grooms of the Bedchamber. The greatest advantage of these groups was their constant access to the monarch. Sir John was pivotal to anyone seeking to get his relatives or protégés some kind of advantage: a military or naval commission, advancement in the Church, royal enthusiasm for a composer, artist or scientist, or some kind of administrative post in the range of boards, commissions or committees that managed public business.12 He duly used his position to secure more for his family. His brother Bernard became one of the Grooms of the Bedchamber, and he managed to wed Anne Morley, an heiress from Yorkshire, for the court was a good marriage market for people from all over the country. She was an earl’s granddaughter, and brought five healthy children into the family: three sons, George, Bevill and Bernard, Mary’s father, and two daughters, Mary and Anne.13 The libertinism of Charles II’s court was widely recognised and also deplored. After William and Mary had become co-monarchs in 1688, the king encouraged his wife to become a figurehead for the moral purification of court culture. He discouraged her from attending the public theatres, with their sleazy atmosphere. She also associated herself with the Societies for the Reformation of Manners, which were encouraged by the Church of England as a means of practising charitable works and checking vices such as promiscuity and gambling. Their activities included the founding of schools for poor Anglicans, boys and girls alike, and the dissemination of Bibles.14 The queen’s immediate entourage, which included Anne, later Lady Stanley, as a Maid of Honour, also set a moral tone. According to one clerical panegyrist, when the queen and her Maids sat together embroidering, someone read devotional works out loud to inspire them in their charitable activities.15 Aunt Anne’s most prized possession from her stint at court was a seal made of amethyst set in gold, with the figure of Minerva wearing a helmet carved into it, the crown and the initial M in one corner, and an inscribed motto.16 Minerva was the Roman version of Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, who in legend sprang fullformed from the head of Jove. She was associated with poetry, with female learning and cultivated self-improvement, as well as with the ability of women to govern well (Plate 3). For Anne Granville this gift must have signified the approval by a queen for women who were intellectually and religiously serious, who wanted to lead honourable lives, and bring up their families likewise. 14\n\nMISS MARY GRANVILLE\n\nDON ’ T BE A TULIP : ANGLICAN FEMINISM AND THE GRANVILLE FAMILY\n\nQueen Mary and then Queen Anne were used both as a figurehead and desired patron by English women, and some men, who advocated better education for women. The first priority was to teach young Mary French, the language of courtly life and polite society, rather than attempt to imbue her with the kind of classical learning admired in the first half of the seventeenth century. She was therefore sent, aged 6, to a school run by a Huguenot refugee, Mlle Puelle. The latter was part of the diaspora of French Protestants (Huguenots) who had taken refuge in England when Louis XIV revoked their rights of religious toleration in 1685. She taught a select group of twenty young girls, daughters of peers and also of ‘new money’. One school friend was the Scottish Lady Jane Douglas, who admired young Mary’s already budding dexterity in cutting out paper shapes of flowers and birds, and to prevent their being crumpled in her pocket would pin them to her dress.17 Social boundaries were becoming fluid: another pupil was Miss Dye Bertie, who was illegitimate, but nevertheless ‘after leaving school, was the pink of fashion in the beau monde, and married a nobleman’.18 As court life revived, the theatre was re-established, and all kinds of discussion between men took place in clubs, coffee houses and the Royal Society. There was consequently an increasing need for aristocratic and gentlewomen to have enough of an education to be able to take part with their families in the broader cultural conversation. New magazines such as The Tatler and The Spectator included short essays on literary criticism, and popularisations of recent scientific and philosophical achievements, aimed at women, and men who had not had a university education. Mary’s education reflects new arguments about the role and potential of women, expressed in the sprightly essay by Judith Drake entitled An Essay in Defence of the Female Sex, published in 1696, and dedicated to Princess Anne, then heiress presumptive to the throne. Drake encouraged them to converse with wit and verve in English and French, and to keep up with modern authors, and argued they could keep abreast of new writers by attending the theatre. She thought girls and boys should share the same education until they were about 6 or 7, and asserted that women who went visiting with their mothers and therefore had the advantage of hearing good conversation, also had more time to enrich their vocabulary by reading novels, romances, plays and poems, whereas boys were already being drilled in their Latin and Greek.19 15\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nAnother advocate of women’s education was Mary Astell. Her perspective derived from an austere self-disciplined High Anglicanism. This strand of ‘womanist’ argument was also likely to have influenced Mary’s family educators, both in her early years in London and when the family was forced into their rustic exile. Both Drake and Astell could be described as Tories, but Astell’s loyalty to the Stuarts veered off into Jacobitism: she was a close friend of Bishop Atterbury of Rochester, who by 1722 was plotting along with George Lansdowne to replace George II with James ‘III’. Astell belonged to the wing of the Church of England that led the way in reforming ‘manners’ and founding schools after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Drake and Astell differed very substantially on their beliefs about how humankind acquired knowledge, and the implications this had for female capacity. Whereas Drake had embraced John Locke’s theory that knowledge was derived initially from sensory experience, upon which reasoning capacities should be exercised to organise this data into coherent patterns, Astell was an adherent of the French philosopher Descartes’ belief in the rational capacity of the unsexed human mind to reason clearly from first principles. Her Serious Proposal to the Ladies, whose first part appeared in 1694, was a bracing call to women of quality to value their intellectual abilities. She advocated the formation of a college for women, who would thereby have the opportunity to spend some of their later adolescent years prior to marriage in a secluded, sisterly environment, unharassed by marriage suitors.20 Astell was earnest and high-minded, but managed to convey her elevated moral message to her own sex in an attractively pithy style. Near the start of her essay, she challenged her reader: ‘How can you be content to be in the World Like Tulips in a Garden, to make a fine show and be good for nothing; have all your Glories set in the Grave, or perhaps much sooner?’ But even a childless, unmarried lady could regard the whole world as her family; ‘her opportunities of doing good are not lessen’d but increas’d by her being unconfin’d’. Astell recognised that a bad marriage could in fact be a kind of prison. In these circumstances, the only solution was for a Christian woman to see in this arduous experience a spiritual discipline preparing her for her future life beyond the grave. Sometimes obscured by Astell’s religious fervour and philosophical polemic, her fundamental urge is to get women to value themselves, and thus be valued by others.21 Great-uncle Denis had several relatives and friends who were devoted High Tory Anglicans, who supported the moral and spiritual re-education Mary 16\n\nMISS MARY GRANVILLE\n\nAstell advocated. One of them was his nephew through marriage, the landowner, cleric and polymath, Sir George Wheler. The French Bishop Fenelon’s Traité de l’éducation des filles (1687) was another book advocating women’s education. When translated into English by George Hickes, a cleric and Anglo-Saxon scholar, he also recommended Astell’s Serious Proposal to the Ladies in his notes. Ironically he dedicated the translation to Anne, Duchess of Ormonde – the rival, legal wife to Mary’s mother when she was associating with the duke.\n\nCHELSEA AND WHITEHALL\n\nAfter Mary had spent two years with Mlle Puelle, her parents moved from Poland Street to the village of Chelsea, where the fresher air was considered more beneficial to her mother’s health. Chelsea was still a separate village on the Thames, upriver from the city of Westminster, with many trees and houses with large gardens. There were market gardens whose produce supplied the capital, and the Chelsea Physic Garden, founded in 1673 by the Society of Apothecaries to teach apprentices about medicinal plants. It soon became a centre for cultivating specimen plants from all over the world. Plant specialists and seedsmen were also attracted to the area. The flowers Mary cut out for her school friends might have been based on those she saw growing in various locales in the neighbourhood. The most prominent building was the Chelsea Hospital, founded in 1682 by Charles II for ‘the succour and relief of veterans broken by age or war’. Mary Astell ran a charity school in rooms in the hospital so it is very possible that she met Colonel and Mrs Granville in person. This was the point at which Mary, now 8, stopped living consistently with her parents and stayed in the West End with her Uncle and Aunt Stanley. As respite from the smells and dirt of London they cherished their country villa, Northend, in rural Fulham, a short distance away from Chelsea. The Stanleys spent the summers there and visited at weekends during the year, so Mary was not completely cut off from her parents and young sister. Her aunt now supervised her education, supplemented by specialist masters. What did Mary learn? Music was considered more important for her to learn than drawing or painting. Courtiers needed to know how to dance, which in turn instilled elegant posture and movement in boys as much as girls. Music pervaded court life: at chapel worship, as military fanfares for ceremonial entrances and exits or parades, as background or ‘chamber music’ in the evenings or while dining, and through opera and plays. Her oldest brother Bernard 17\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nhad an extremely good ear, and she might have started learning keyboard music very young when he was also being instructed. A lady with a fine voice might perform in private to entertain her family and friends, though she would lose caste if she sang in public, or for money. Nevertheless there was no stigma attached to an amateur performing privately to a professional standard. In 1710, Mary met the composer G.F. Handel, who was making his first exploratory visit to London after his patron, the Elector of Hanover, future King George I of Great Britain, had made him his Kapellmeister in Hanover. He was introduced to her uncle, Sir John Stanley, by the musical impresario Heidegger. Mary already had a little spinet, ‘on which that great musician performed wonders’. As soon as he left Mary sat down and tried to recreate what she had heard. When her uncle teased her whether she would ever play as well as Mr Handel she replied, ‘If I did not think I should I would burn my instrument!’ It was a telling indication of Mary’s intensity of spirit.22 Mary’s first visual training probably came through needlework rather than painting or drawing. As the future manager of a household she was expected to know many household skills in order to instil good standards in her servants, and supervise them correctly. Mary would have started by being shown the basic stitches for plain sewing, used for undergarments and household linen, before being taught more specialist stitches and embroidery in silk or wool. The close decorative stitching necessary to produce the right effects would have encouraged attention to exact colour matching and pattern: an excellent training for the eye, even if such practical applied work was not valued as ‘fine art’. Ladies were also traditionally associated with supervising the dairy, making preserves and concocting remedies to assist in the health of anyone in the household. Religion would have permeated her schooling, as well as being a matter of specific instruction. Many a young girl wove in her Scripture with her needlework lessons when embroidering a sampler, which demonstrated her mastery of various stitches and usually included a religious text as part of the design. A lady would also be expected to have a good ‘hand’, that is to say, to be able to write consistently and attractively. Some families were less bothered if girls had weak grammar and spelling but this was not the case with Mary’s family, and she would later insist on her niece attaining high standards. Reading out loud, important as evening entertainment, often entailed listening to a book, poem or play being so read, and as Judith Drake would have recommended, Mary must eventually have been reading modern authors, some of them her Uncle George’s friends. 18\n\nMISS MARY GRANVILLE\n\nTHE GRANVILLE SUCCESSION QUESTION : ENTER THE MATRIARCH\n\nThe Granvilles had almost as many problems ensuring their own succession as did many of the ruling families of Europe in the first decade of the eighteenth century. When Queen Anne’s ministry was remodelled in 1710, with Harley at its head, George Lansdowne finally gained an important political job as Minister of War. His family influence in Cornwall at the election that year had been particularly important, and he personally had been able to unseat Hugh Boscawen, nephew of Sidney Godolphin, as MP for the county, as well as to secure the election of Mary’s father Bernard as MP for Fowey, an important Cornish borough. He also obtained the governorship of Hull for his brother. Their patron Harley was raised to the peerage as Earl of Oxford, and George had hopes he too would get a title. In May 1711 the young Earl of Bath had died. After so much promise, the 1st Earl of Bath’s attempts to create a glorious chapter in the history of the Granville family through his direct descendants seemed to be faltering. However, to George Granville this was an opportunity to press his own claims and he petitioned Queen Anne to revive ‘the honours of my family in myself’.23 He was not yet successful. What he did do, though, in preparation to receive a title, was to marry. This increased his wealth, as his wife was the widowed Lady Mary Thynne, who had an exceptionally large jointure of £12,000 p.a. She also had good court connections as she was a member of the Villiers family. She was young enough to create a second family for George, and they had four daughters. Mary would remain friendly with all her Carteret cousins, especially Georgina. The following year George finally attained a title when Queen Anne created twelve peers to ensure sufficient government influence in the House of Lords to pass the peace preliminaries at the end of the Spanish War. Referring back to his great-grandfather’s gallantry in the Civil War, George chose the title of Baron Lansdowne, the hill near Bath where the latter had been killed defending the troops he was bringing from Cornwall to Charles I in Oxford. George made sure his brother Bernard and his heirs were mentioned in the patent.24 But he had reckoned without the drive and Granville loyalty of the female side of the family. The 1st Earl of Bath’s only surviving daughter, Grace, thought the earldom should descend in the female line, which was not unprecedented. New marital allegiances did not preclude daughters from claiming succession rights in their birth families where there was no male heir, and 19\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nGrace claimed a share in the estates for herself, and the heirs of her sisters Jane and Catherine. Grace was married into the Carteret family, another AngloNorman family; their power-base was in the Channel Islands, which they had defended for centuries against invasion. From 1711 to 1715 Grace, already a widow, pursued her claims and was awarded a share of the Granville lands, together with the title of Countess Granville in her own right. Such litigation was not a modern pursuit of equal legal rights for women: nevertheless, it shows how women in elite families were constantly alert to the ‘family business’ of getting and maintaining status, when the opportunity arose. To the family she was ‘the Dragon’, and her son John was an influential statesman in the reigns of both George I and George II.25 Mary Granville also became very friendly with some of her Leveson-Gower cousins, which linked her through marriage to the royal family. Jane LevesonGower’s daughter, another Jane, married her first cousin, Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Rochester, and his cousins were none other than the Stuart princesses Mary and Anne. But of all the Hyde family, the cousin and playmate of Mary’s to whom she was closest was Catherine (Kitty) Hyde, Jane and Henry Hyde’s daughter. Mary Granville and Kitty remained in touch for many years in court circles. The other playmate Mary remembered was a relative of her uncle Sir John Stanley, Judith Tichborne. The diffident Judith remained her friend and her marriage into the Churchill network was later regarded as a useful connection for Mary’s family.26 For girls as much as for boys, those with whom you were schooled with could be as important and useful as what you learnt.\n\nEXPULSION FROM EDEN\n\nThe Granville hopes to get Mary placed at court were dashed when Queen Anne died in 1714. George Elector of Hanover now came to Britain with his entourage. His son and heir, George, Prince of Wales and his wife Caroline of Ansbach, accompanied the king with three children, leaving the oldest, Frederick, in Hanover, to represent the Electoral family. The fact that George I was divorced meant there would be no queen’s household requiring Maids of Honour, and the only opportunities that would occur would be in the Princess of Wales’s household, which was much smaller than a consort’s. But aside from a shortage of female opportunities, Mary was now handicapped by her family’s Tory affiliations. The king felt that Queen Anne’s Tory ministers had betrayed the 20\n\nMISS MARY GRANVILLE\n\nalliances with German princes like himself by initiating peace moves in 1711, and he preferred to appoint Whigs to his ministry and household. George Lord Lansdowne lost his job as Treasurer of the royal household in October, and Mary’s father was dismissed from his military position as Governor of Hull. Coupled with the arrears on the payment of her mother’s dowry, the family’s financial position was disadvantageous. Their two sons were not at home: Bernard was ‘at the academy’ – that is, a military academy – and Bevill was still at Westminster school, popular with families who wanted their sons to have a role in politics. Mary was now mainly domiciled with her parents. Then in 1715 the exiled James Stuart’s supporters staged a rising in his favour. George Granville’s known Jacobite leanings made him a figure of suspicion and he was arrested. So it was that Mary experienced the family drama of near arrest on suspicion of treason themselves, and the family hurried to remote Gloucestershire. Instead of being in the charmed circle of court life, with Lord George regarded as the premier poet of a new peaceful era under Queen Anne, his misjudged sympathy for the Pretender’s claims had blighted the lives of his brother Bernard and his children, and young Mary’s career as a courtier had apparently finished before it really started.27\n\n21\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nornish ride\n\nFIRST VISIT TO LONGLEAT HOUSE\n\nwo years after Mary’s family had been obliged to move to the Gloucestershire countryside, her uncle Lord George Lansdowne made a decisive intervention in their life. Now a free man, he invited her to his home at Longleat House in Wiltshire, about 20 miles away.1 The estate was not that far from the Lansdowne site where the cavalier Sir Bevill had died fighting for Charles I. In the late seventeenth to early eighteenth centuries it was recovering after political upheaval and war. Two features of the estate would be especially influential to Mary – its gardens and its libraries. When Mary was an infant, its owner, Thomas Thynne, MP and diplomat, created 1st Viscount Weymouth (1640– 1714) commissioned a truly magnificent garden in the formal French style, using 70 acres to the east of the house. His granddaughter, Frances Thynne, later Lady Hertford, whom Mary knew, followed her father and grandfather’s example of being a literary patron.\n\nMARY GRANVILLE ’ S LITERARY EDUCATION\n\nAfter the quiet two years at Buckland, this Longleat visit was both a social initiation to sophisticated society, and also a kind of informal further education for young Mary Granville. Lord Lansdowne was too recently implicated in Jacobite plotting for him to be inclined to attend the royal court yet, or be welcome there, so neither he nor his wife could reintegrate Mary back into the 22\n\nCORNISH BRIDE\n\nmetropolitan world she had been forced to leave so abruptly. But the range of guests, the conversation and the entertainment at Longleat would nonetheless prepare her for when this might happen. However, after Mary’s father had accompanied his daughter to her uncle, the latter took him on one side and explained he was reducing his brother’s allowance, as he should have lower expenditure in the countryside. Downcast at this, Col. Granville could not help confiding this new trouble to his daughter. The episode is ambiguous: was Lord Lansdowne preparing to make Mary more open to an arranged marriage if she was aware of her parents’ straitened means? Was her father speaking spontaneously or deliberately to help her see how important it might be to follow up the opportunities the Longleat visit might bring? Yet there is no clear evidence that her father was aware of Lansdowne’s ultimate plans. For some time after her father had left, Mary wished she had returned with him, ‘that I might by my duty and tender affection show him that I preferred his house and company to all the flattering views that were laid out before me; but it was his pleasure I should stay’.2 His reasons must have included the fact that with less income he would have less ability to introduce her at court with the help of Lady Stanley: Longleat might substitute for London husband-finding. The one positive result was that Mary’s uncle became her literary mentor. There was regular shared reading out loud, which would have included reading of plays: Shakespeare, Dryden, the French masters of tragedy such as Racine, and Lansdowne’s own, including Heroick Love (1697), based on a brief incident in book one of Homer’s Iliad (as translated by Dryden). True to the spirit of Judith Drake, there was now an increasing number of modern translations of the classics. One important new translation was put together by the poet and critic Samuel Garth and dedicated in 1717 to Caroline Princess of Wales, praising her dignity and forbearance during the political estrangement of the heir and his wife from King George I between 1717 and 1720. Garth had commissioned some of the best writers of the day to translate the Latin poet Ovid’s Metamorphoses. The translators included Lansdowne’s hero, Dryden, the essayist Joseph Addison and the satirist and wit, John Gay. Each of the fifteen sections of the book was dedicated to an elite woman, including the Princess of Wales’s daughter, Anne, princess royal, and the countesses of Hertford and Burlington, both Ladies of the Bedchamber to Princess Caroline. Such women were clearly among the target audience for the book. Perhaps this recent deluxe publication had followed Lansdowne down to Longleat. 23\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nOther books shared by her uncle could have been more of the heroic French romances that had been so popular at the court of Louis XIV, written by women like Mlle de Scudéry and Mme de Lafayette, Italian stories from the Renaissance by Boccaccio or romance epic poems by Ariosto. In a more modern vein there were the new literary magazines, The Tatler and The Spectator. Lansdowne’s friend Jonathan Swift had been a leading light in the former magazine, while the latter, edited by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele, was more strongly associated with the Whigs. The aim of this magazine was to ‘bring Philosophy out of closets, to dwell in Clubs and Assemblies, at Tea-Tables and in coffee-Houses’.3 In other words, it aimed to reach women and non-university educated men, in addition to gentlemen with the expected classical education, and give them an entrée to the current cultural conversation. The magazines were part diversion, part conduct book, for a newly mobile society. More specifically sermonising were the actual conduct books, such as the one edited by Sir Richard Steele in 1712, The Ladies Library. Though appearing under his name or as simply ‘By a Lady’, it was actually compiled by a young clergyman Mary would soon know and admire, the theologian and philosopher George Berkeley. Notwithstanding its title, the three volumes it comprised were written for men as much as women, with exhortations to both sexes to live in a spiritually responsible and godly way – advising, for instance, how they used their time or their wealth. Its advice to women dealt with the different stages of their lives, as daughters, wives and widows. Berkeley strongly advised young women whose destiny was marriage to think of themselves as having legal agency; after all, they would resume legal independent identity as widows. This legal personality would therefore be much more powerful than before marriage, when daughters were normally under a father’s supervision. Thus Berkeley’s advice discourages women from ignorance of financial matters: T’is very necessary that women of Quality, and of Estates, should know exactly what those Estates are, what part in Land, what in Houses, what in Money, where and in whose Hands: They should be as well acquainted with the Rentals of their Lands, the Draughts of them, the Situation, Leases and condition of their Houses, as their Husbands; what debts they owe, as well as what are owing to them. By this they regulate their domestic and other Expenses, provided for the future Settlement of their Children, and answer the Ends of Marriage, to be Helper to their Husbands in the Discharge of Paternal Duties.4\n\n24\n\nCORNISH BRIDE\n\nThis legal knowledge, as well as good taste in books, is in Berkeley’s view much more important than ability in household management or domestic medical remedies, which he takes for granted they will also possess.We cannot know if Mary Granville was given The Ladies Library to read, but it is not unlikely, and the example of Lady Anne Stanley, clearly an able partner in her marriage to a courtier and landowner, exemplifies the type of woman who is both respectful of her husband’s position while being an effective manager if he were absent. Most gentry marriages were, arguably, based on this model.5 The literary world of Lord Lansdowne was mainly a male one. The women who wrote for the commercial press were not considered ladies, however successful they were. But exceptions included a relative by marriage of Mary Granville: this was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689–1762), who was the most prominent female literary figure at this time. One of her sisters, Evelyn, was married to Mary Granville’s cousin John Leveson-Gower, 1st Baron Gower, while the other, Frances, was the second wife of the Jacobite conspirator, John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar. So Lady Mary, like Mary Granville, knew what it was like to belong to a family divided by recent political events. As a woman of quality, Lady Mary had no financial need to write, but she did have a strong vocation to do so. Many of her poems and letters circulated in manuscript, not print, but nevertheless some must later have been known to Mary Granville once she became friends with Henrietta, Lady Harley, an exact contemporary of Lady Mary. The two had grown up near each other in Nottinghamshire, and as young women they had anxiously written to each other and their circle of friends about whether their arranged marriages would lead to Paradise or Purgatory. Lady Mary was what was known as a female wit: a woman renowned for being able to hold her own in conversation with some of the cleverest literary men in the country. Lord Lansdowne’s protégé Alexander Pope wrote idealising love poems to and about her when she was in the Ottoman Empire, accompanying her husband on a diplomatic mission (1716–18). However, Lady Mary was an uncomfortable paradox, to herself and others. Such women might not only scare the gentlemen, they could also discomfort their less well-read and less morally serious female contemporaries. When it was increasingly evident that Lord Lansdowne was enjoying the interest his niece was taking in their literary conversations, it certainly displeased his wife and his unmarried sister Elizabeth who lived with them. Mary Granville quickly perceived this: 25\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nMy two aunts soon grew jealous of the great favour shown me by my uncle, and would never suffer me to spend an hour with him alone, which mortified me extremely; for though I did not pretend to much penetration or any judgement, I soon found their conversation much less instructive, as well as less entertaining than his. I had been brought up to love reading; they never read at all, or if they did, idle books that I was not allowed to read. . . . Alcander [Lord Lansdowne] delighted in asking me read to him, which I did every day, till the ladies grew angry at my being so much with my uncle.6\n\nNevertheless perhaps it was during this winter that Mary began to have tentative aspirations to being considered a wit herself: a literary-minded woman, a good letter-writer, a fluent conversationalist. It would have been an ambition to cherish much more keenly than any facility with her needle or scissors, let alone her paintbrush. Her aspirations to a literary life might also have originated in the long winter evenings at Buckland as the family read aloud with only the Rev. Tooker for company, or in conversations with her friend Sarah Chapone: she would later tell John Wesley that as a girl she had once sworn she would only marry a wit.7 But although Mary’s immediate family was bookish, her uncle’s discussions with her must have given her a much deeper and wider engagement with the life of letters. In her autobiography she characterised Lansdowne as having ‘learning and wit . . . with the greatest politeness and good humour imaginable’.8 Perhaps this was her beau ideal – but it set the bar high. However, her hopes would come to some level of fruition from an unexpected direction when she met Patrick Delany and his circle on her first visit to Ireland in 1731. The literary life she shared with Patrick would be integral to their later marriage. But first her life was painfully moulded to quite another pattern, consistent with her upbringing and family ties. ENTER ‘ GROMIO ’\n\nMary was young enough, spirited enough – and attractive enough – to be able to tease and laugh, as well as converse soberly with her uncle. Also of the party that winter was her aunt’s younger brother, the Hon. Henry Villiers, who had a scornful turn of humour.9 He and Mary soon had someone to amuse them. One stormy winter evening a visitor was announced while the household was at dinner: her uncle immediately welcomed him delightedly to the table. 26\n\nCORNISH BRIDE\n\nI expected to have seen somebody with the appearance of a gentleman, when the poor, old, dripping almost drowned Gromio was brought into the room, like Hob out of the well, his wig, his coat, his dirty boots, his large unwieldy person, and his crimson countenance were all subjects of great mirth and observation to me. I diverted myself at his expense several days, and was well assisted by [Henry Villiers].10\n\nThis was the first impression she had of Alexander Pendarves, a wealthy 57-yearold Cornish landowner, who was to become her first husband. Hob in the Well was a comic-pastoral farce written in the 1720s, featuring a young country bumpkin.11 Arriving like this on horseback in bad weather, Pendarves might have seemed like a visitant from a different world. In fact he was more sophisticated than he seemed, and he was very much from Mary Granville’s world. He was from an old Cornish landowning family intermarried with those considered the best families in the county, including the Granvilles, and he was also a close political ally of Lansdowne. The Pendarves came from the Helston area and had tin-bearing lands; they had been settled at a Cornish village, Pendarves, since the Elizabethan age, when Mary’s ancestor Sir Richard Granville was already a dashing buccaneer. They had political influence and financial clout, managed their estates well and, in addition to being an MP for various Cornish constituencies – Helston, Saltash, Launceston – in 1714 Alexander had been appointed Surveyor of Crown Lands by George I. He was a childless widower, his first wife, Lady Dorothy Bourke, having been a wealthy Irish heiress, and daughter of the 8th Earl of Clanricarde. Pendarves’ own estate was at Roscrow, above Falmouth Bay, more than halfway to the south-east tip of Cornwall. Pendarves’ mother, Bridget Carew, was a sister of Sir John Carew, 2nd Baronet, who like the Granvilles were a prominent family with marriage ties to the Prideaux family. Alexander’s brother John was a wealthy clergyman whose daughter Mary was set to inherit her father’s and her uncle’s money. This Cornish Mary had married into another of the old Cornish families, the Bassets, and their son, John, later married a Prideaux lady. But here was Alexander Pendarves’ grievance: Mary and John Basset were stalling at allowing their son and heir to incorporate the Pendarves name as a condition of his inheritance. Including the name would be a recognition and perpetuation of Alexander’s branch of the Pendarves family and his wish was not at all unusual (and eventually they agreed on this). But when 27\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nAlexander arrived at Longleat he was, he declared, en route to London to sell his estates, to forestall the inheritance going to his recalcitrant niece altogether. Again, it is not altogether clear that the Longleat stop-over was as spontaneous as it seemed, though given the customs of hospitality of the time it would not have been unusual. Lansdowne’s Jacobite initiative had damaged Pendarves: he too had been arrested for suspected conspiracy in 1715 and there had been some sequestration of his estates. Mary’s uncle therefore felt some obligation to help his political crony. There were two ways he could do it: he could dangle his pretty young niece before Pendarves, who as a second wife might give him the heir he lacked and frustrate the Bassets altogether, and he could also point out that Mary had a very useful connection, who could help restore Pendarves’ estates. This was because her old school friend, Judith Tichbourne, had just married as his third wife Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland. He was the most important statesman in the land, combining the roles of First Lord of the Treasury and Lord President of the Council: effectively, though neither the concept nor the term yet existed, Sunderland was prime minister.12 Any parliamentary bill he chose to support would receive little opposition. At one stroke Lansdowne could help his friend and provide for his niece. Even if Lord Lansdowne had not completely thought out this plan before Pendarves arrived, it must have soon occurred to him when he saw that Pendarves was very taken with his vivacious young niece. For her the farce of his arrival soon turned into something much darker. ‘Gromio’ was supposed to stay for a brief respite on the way to London . . . but he stayed . . . and he stayed . . . and he stayed. Inexperienced though she was it was soon quite clear he was lingering because of her: ‘I (to my great sorrow) was after some time convinced I was the cause of this delay: . . . and I could easily perceive I was the only person in the family that did not approve of it.’13 She was emotionally isolated: her father gone, her aunts hostile, her uncle busy manoeuvring. The more charming Pendarves tried to be, the more she squirmed literally and metaphorically away from him. His bulk, his gout, his sullen temper were all distinctly off-putting, and she reacted by being sure to dress unattractively and never be in a room alone with him in case he proposed. Her aunts told her she was being ‘childish, ignorant and silly and that if I did not know what was for my own interest, my friends [that is, her family] must judge for me’.14 Recollecting the two months of suspense and cringing, as she wrote all this down Mary began to shake with nerves, and was unable to continue her section about this episode. 28\n\nCORNISH BRIDE\n\nResuming the story, Mary revealed how, after they were married, Pendarves told her how much he had hesitated to make his proposal, and how much her deliberately displayed hostility had nearly broken his nerve. Equally intolerable to him was the amusing banter between her and Henry Villiers: to an older man aware that he might be humiliated by a young girl, it was pure torment. In the end, Pendarves appealed to Lansdowne to do the main work for him. One evening all the guests and family seemed of one accord to go into the music room, leaving Mary alone with her uncle. She tried to follow but her uncle requested she stay back as his gout impeded him. My spirits foreboded what he was about to say and when he bid me shut the door, I turned as pale as death; he took me by the hand, and after a very pathetic [that is, affecting] speech of his love and care for me, and of my father’s unhappy circumstances, my own want of fortune, and the little prospect I had of being happy if I disobliged those friends that were serving of me, he told me of Gromio’s great passion for me, and his offer of settling his whole estate upon me; he then, with great art and eloquence, told me all his good qualities and vast merit, and how despicable I should be if I did refuse because he was not young and handsome.\n\nFinally, after the velvet glove came the mailed fist: her normally so polite and urbane uncle finished with the threat that if she were still harbouring romantic inclinations towards her first Gloucestershire admirer, Robert Twyford, whom she had actually put right out of her mind, he would ensure Robert would be dragged through the horse-pond if he ever came near Longleat.15 This bluster made her realise how futile it was to try to argue with her uncle: the threat to Twyford was surely hypothetical, but the manner in which Lansdowne made it forced her to realise how determined he was that she should obey him. Perhaps the intensity of his insistence was to arm himself against any counterpersuasions from Mary; he must have realised he was being cruel, and felt guilty. She said she would do what he asked and that she was aware of his concern for her, but begged to be allowed the privacy of her room. When she reached it, she wept for two hours, but that was all the respite she had for this brusque determination of her future. Any hopes or dreams she might have had of finding a soulmate of whom her family might approve, a wit who would take her penniless as she was, were abruptly curtailed. Nor was she left alone to weep the night away: a succession of 29\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nservants made it clear she had to join the family at supper. She went down, holding onto a single shred of hope that someone in the household might sympathise with her, or that she could even persuade Pendarves not to force the issue. But, as she put it, ‘no-one considered the sentiments of my heart’. They could only discuss the financial and social advantages opening before her.16 Effectively, the bargain Mary was being given was this: she was a penniless daughter of a younger son, overshadowed by political disgrace, with no money for his daughter to make her debut. This marriage would make her comfortably off, relieve financial pressure on her family and give her a fortune once she was widowed. Like her great-aunt Lady Joanna Thornhill (Plate 2), also forced into an early marriage to a wealthy man, she could then become a philanthropist and patron, or divert herself in other ways of her choosing. Meanwhile she would have the status of a wife in a circle of Cornish peers and gentry, and a footing in London polite society whenever her husband needed to be at Westminster. The social freedoms accorded married women and their female friends would enable her to enjoy London’s amenities when her husband did not require her company. Nor she was a passive beneficiary in the bargain: her own Granville kin would confer social capital on the Pendarves family. Her aunt and uncle Sir John and Lady Stanley were in good standing with the royal court, as were her Carteret cousins, which might help rehabilitate her husband provided he stayed aloof from Jacobite scheming. This he was likely to do while negotiating for the restitution of his estates. And here, above all, she was absolutely pivotal in her own right, insofar as she was an old school friend of Lady Sunderland, third wife of the prime minister. His second wife had been a daughter of John and Sarah Churchill. Mary was in her own way a route to the Whigs, the current party of power – and fashion. This did not make the terms of the bargain any less intolerable. She was being forced to marry someone she thought was completely incompatible, but the combination of her uncle’s pressure and her sense of obligation towards her family made it impossible for her to refuse. She had not really been in the metropolitan social world, which might have given her more room to agree to a managed choice, and now the door was firmly shut. And the most repellent prospect of all was that of obligatory intimacy with this elderly man, who was physically disgusting to her, but who was besotted with her. He was hopeful he could leave his money to his own heir, and not his niece and her son, if he could only father a boy by his new bride. 30\n\nCORNISH BRIDE\n\nIn her own words, this was like the sacrifice of Iphigenia in Euripides’ Greek tragedy, in which King Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter in order for the winds to change so that his ships can sail to the Trojan wars. Mary knew her classics well: Iphigenia willingly permits her father’s plans, just as she bowed to her uncle’s demands. But in the play, a deer is substituted at the last moment and Iphigenia lives. But for Mary there was no last-minute substitution: as she was led to the altar in the Longleat chapel, ‘I wished from my soul I had been led, as Iphigenia was, to be sacrificed. I was sacrificed. I lost, not life indeed, but I lost all that makes life desirable – joy and peace of mind . . .’17 Yet, insofar as she had agreed to the bargain as an act of unselfishness towards her parents, she had not been an entirely passive victim: she had been able to choose the moral high ground, albeit in a much attenuated and excruciatingly difficult way. She knew that they would have supported her in a refusal, but that this might have rebounded on them all; she was able to console herself that she had prevented further troubles. To the modern mind, she had internalised too strongly a desire to please her affable father, clear proof of female abjection: but we must remember that she did not see it like this. Rather, ‘[my] considerations gave me courage, and kept up my resolution’.18 She felt that she was, just a little bit, in control. Her feelings had been ignored, but she could still clothe her enforced choice with moral reason. Lord Lansdowne had evidently not made Mary’s parents privy to his plans, but as soon as he had exacted her consent he sent a messenger to Buckland summoning them to Longleat, giving them the impression that Mary was entirely pleased with the arrangement. She realised she would now have to act consistently with her decision. ‘I had now nothing to do but to submit to my unhappy fortune, and to endeavour to reconcile myself to it.’19 I think we must presume that one way she coped was to consider this as a trial sent by divine providence: that it was a spiritual challenge as well as an emotional one. How she must have wished that Mary Astell’s college for women was a reality, and that she might have had a few more years secluded from pressures to marry, sharing congenial female company, practising her music, doing some quiet charitable work . . . But if this was not God’s will, she must have told herself it was a means of developing patience and grace, and of doing good to others. If her reward was not on earth, it would be manifest in the hereafter. Struggling against these good resolutions were her natural feelings of despair at her ‘imprisonment’. Pendarves now had the right to court her – to compliment her, 31\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nenjoy her company alone, make himself personally agreeable with some restrained amorous gestures such as kissing her hand or her forehead and fondling her a little – but he ‘saw too well my insurmountable dislike’.20 Her uncle showered money and clothes on her and the wedding in Longleat chapel on 17 February 1718 was full of pomp. ‘Never was woe drest out in gayer colours’, she recalled.21 Everyone around her saw how pensive and forlorn she was, but all, her parents included, chose to interpret this as her apprehension over leaving familiar scenes as well as her family to go into an unknown part of the world. Her little sister was a consolation to her because of her utter ignorance of what this marriage entailed: we can imagine Anne as entranced with the generous trousseau her aunt and uncle now authorised for her sister, and excited at the mere thought of Mary being a bride and chatelaine of an estate. It is a testament to Mary’s generosity of heart that, recalling these events twenty years later, she emphasises what threads and scraps of silver lining she was able to find at the time. She explained Mr Pendarves ‘showed me all the respect and tenderness he was capable of’ and she reciprocated as pleasantly as she was able. This probably alludes to his consummation of the marriage – doubtless an excruciating experience – and not just to his general behaviour.22\n\nFROM LONGLEAT TO ROSCROW\n\nMary and her husband stayed on at Longleat, she painfully adjusting to the status of bride, which in social etiquette gave her first place at table. Then it was time to leave for the distant ‘country’ of Cornwall. Her parents and sister left for Buckland, but she was to have the consolation of her elder brother, Bunny (Bernard), to accompany them and stay for a time. It was not unusual for a bride to have some family or friend to keep her company in the early days of marriage, but more usually a sister would be chosen. However, Bunny was available, as he was trying to sort out his financial status as a half-pay officer,23 and as well as adding to the social life indoors, he could ride out with his sister for exercise when Pendarves’ gout kept him confined. The journey to distant Roscrow took two weeks. It was a fortified castle rather than a country home, hidden behind high walls and entered through an old-fashioned gatehouse. It looked like a prison, and moreover a near derelict one that had not been inhabited for thirty years. The hall was dark, the windows high and the parlour leading off it had rotten floorboards and a collapsed 32\n\nCORNISH BRIDE\n\nceiling. Her tense, overwrought nerves gave way completely and she burst into tears of shock and dismay. Mary soon made the effort to dry her tears, and to busy herself. Her husband, disturbed by her violent sobbing, immediately agreed she could refurbish some of the castle. For someone of her artistic talent it must have been a pleasure to think out these improvements: ‘the liberty of fitting it up conveniently to my own fancy . . . helped amuse me greatly’. As the castle was altered and considerably reduced in the nineteenth century it is impossible to know exactly what changes were made. Visiting in 1861 Lady Llanover explored the remaining bedrooms, one of which had a little closet leading off it, with a good view. She supposed this must have been Mary’s, which she could use as a dressing room and also a room where she could read, sew and create her paper-cut pictures.24 As the lady of the house, Mary had her sphere of activity and authority that must have helped her regain some kind of self-possession. The routines of each day must have given some consoling shape to life in Roscrow, no doubt beginning and probably ending with prayers. As with the abrupt transition to Gloucestershire from London, Mary was able after a while to take pleasure in the landscape. As the days grew longer she and her brother made a joint effort to make the most of nearby sights, so unfamiliar to them both, and she regretted that their rides were often curtailed by her sense of obligation to ‘hasten home many a fine evening that I had rather have spent anywhere than in the castle of Averno’ as a courtesy to gout-ridden Alexander.25 Mary had used the term ‘Averno’ or hell to describe her first impressions of the gloomy castle; Lake Averno near Naples was believed by the Romans to be the gateway to the Underworld. But looking towards the sea was a glimpse of paradise; to ‘every eye which beheld it at a distance the whole appeared a garden, and in great bloom at its proper season. Indeed nothing could be more delightful or beautiful in the months of May and June: the whole terminated in an unlimited view of the sea.’ Also cheering was the constant harbour activity.
