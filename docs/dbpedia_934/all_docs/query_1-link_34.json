        "text": "Extra-illustrations in Letters to and from the Late Samuel Johnson... are tipped in throughout the two volumes. The extra-illustrations include letters, engraved portraits, a few tickets and other ephemera, and numerous clippings and manuscript notes by William Dorset Fellowes. They span the years ca. 1746-1847. This finding aid does not itemize the clippings or Fellowes's notes. Items listed are in the order in which they appear in the volumes. The volume and page number at which each item is placed can be found in the column at the left. Where more than one item is placed at one page, the page numbers are listed as 1.1, 1.2, etc.\n\nThese volumes originally belonged to Sir Horace Mann (1744-1814). According to Fellowes's notes, Mann left them to Hester Lynch Piozzi, who gave them to Fellowes in 1819. Both volumes contain bookplates of Sir Horace Mann and William Dorset Fellowes. Fellowes added the extra-illustrations, generally placing them near passages which mention or relate to the author or subject of the item.\n\nClippings throughout both volumes document current events during Johnson's lifetime, such as the riots of 1780 and public perception of Lord Shelburne, as well as after it, such as the death of Fanny Burney. Extensive manuscript notes by Fellowes concern his family's friendship with Mrs. Piozzi, his position at court, his memories of people mentioned in the text, and his political opinions. Some of the clippings and several of Fellowes's notes relate anecdotes about Johnson or Mrs. Piozzi, but the majority of the extra-illustrations bear little relation to Johnson. There are several letters or notes from Mrs. Piozzi to Fellowes's parents and one to Fellowes himself, which document her friendship with the family.\n\nThe rest of the letters, including one from Piozzi's daughter Queeney (Viscountess Keith) to Baron Gwydir, document Fellowes's career as Secretary to the Lord Great Chamberlain and as Deputy Great Chamberlain. The letters are addressed to the Duke and Duchess of Ancaster, Lord Gwydir, and Fellowes, and they mainly concern admission to Westminster Hall for various trials or for the coronation of George IV. A few concern court business, including a letter from Edmund Burke informing the recipient of an adjournment during the trial of Warren Hastings."
