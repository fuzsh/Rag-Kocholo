In September 1653 the King recommended him to the Duke of York, with whom he served under Turenne. At the Restoration he was admitted to the Middle Temple, but he did not pursue his legal studies, receiving a commission in the Irish army from the Duke of Ormonde. His brother described him as of unblemished integrity, both to church and state, signal loyalty and obliging candour, and he was hospitable to his neighbours, despite apparently limited means. At the general election of 1685 he was returned for Woodstock on the interest of his half-brother, the 1st Earl of Abingdon. He was a moderately active committeeman, being appointed to the committee of elections and privileges and to six others, including that to recommend expunctions from the Journals. On Monmouth’s landing he raised a troop of horse and took an active part in operations against the rebels. ‘The King calls my brother Dick his old fellow-soldier, and intends him more than a troop’, wrote Charles Bertie. But he lost his commission in December, with two of his brothers, for voting against the grant of dispensations to Roman Catholic officers. He died in his fiftieth year on 19 Jan. 1686, ‘a stout, worthy, honest English gentleman’, and was buried at Edenham.\n\nRef Volumes: 1660-1690\n\nAuthor: Leonard Naylor\n\nNotes"
