But the truth is, by other trobles, I have yet hard nothinge of that matter worthie the sendinge, yet did I thinke not to lose so muche occasyon, since I know not whan to recover it agayne, as to let understand how uncurteously I am delte with by my Lord your brother, who, as I heare, bandeth against me and sweareth my death, which I feare nor force not, but lest his displeasure should withdraw your affectionn towardes me, otherwise I thinke no way to be so offended as I can not deffend. And thus good Lady parsuade your selfe no lesse than you shall find I will give cause or perfourme. Above all thinges if you wishe me well let nothing greve you whatsoever you shall heare do happe. For my owne parte my good or ill fortune consisteth onely in you, whom I must request to accept as well this scribled well meaning as better eloquence, excusing my imparfections with my trobled mind, which am locked upp so fast as I could skace get pen and paper to be the present messengers of my pore good will, and thus end a wyfull man, having received new occasyon by your letter at this instant to troble you more hereafter withall. From Willoughbie house. Yours more than his owne and so till his end.\" Draft.\n\n* This would appear to have been written before rather than after their marriage."
