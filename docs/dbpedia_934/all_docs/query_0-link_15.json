As a family history mostly concerned with the births, marriages, and deaths of its members, the target audience is limited. Occasionally events of a public nature in which some family member or other was involved are included. And, even though most of the persons noted here left scant if any evidence of themselves, we have been able to recover enough about them to give us some idea of their lives.\n\nThe time period covered is from the end of the seventeenth century to the middle of the nineteenth.\n\nBecause this ‘paper’ has been prepared by David Man, who is a descendant of Richard Cradock’s sister Susannah, note will be made of a Man connection which would probably not otherwise have been made.\n\nThe font used here is New Courier but for a direct quote or where the text is taken from some other source the font is Calibri.\n\nAll the parishes mentioned are located in London unless otherwise stated. Female family members who marry are written First Name (Maiden Name) Married Name e.g. Susannah (Banner) Cropp. If married twice then First Name (Maiden Name)(First Married Name) Second Married Name, e.g. Elizabeth (Tyers)(Roffey) Boulter.\n\nThe illustrations of London churches, buildings, and views are mostly taken from: A New and Universal History, Description and Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster … by Walter Harrison (1776); as well as the British Museum’s collection of prints and drawings. These reflect the architecture of the period in which the events described here took place.\n\nThe word ‘baptised’ or ‘baptized’ has two spellings. Earlier English records use baptized which is current in American English whereas present day British English uses baptised. Both forms will be found here reflecting British usage over time.\n\nModern spelling of the name ‘Craddock’ is commonly with two d’s. Earlier forms were written Cradock or Cradoc or Cradocke. Craddock is used on the Man family website www.manfamily.org. However, because earlier members of the Craddock family more often used Cradock, that form is used in this ‘paper’. The name ‘Blunt’ sometimes appears as Blount but here Blunt is used while the name ‘Cropp’ is sometimes Crop although here Cropp is used. Where a farther and son share the same name as in the case of Richard Cradock and George Cumberland the suffixes Snr. and Jnr. are used to distinguish father from son and vise versa.\n\nThis paper contains some narrative and a lot of numeric and calenderal quantitative data and descriptions of genealogical relations and so it is more a work of reference to be dipped into on occasion rather than read for anything like pleasure. Since it has a unique perspective much of what is gathered here has never before been seen or if it has then not displayed in a similar context.\n\nIn order for what little ‘narrative’ there is to flow and for the main point to be made more easily, a large amount of detail has been placed in the appendices. The genealogical charts are intended to display connections among families in order to support and clarify the text and are not intended to be exhaustive depictions of each and every family membership. Furthermore, the order in which the individuals appear in relation to one another on a chart may not reflect their actual chronological relationship.\n\nThe Arms of the City of London\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn about 1635 Tobias Cradock (1603-1671), barrister at law of Gray’s Inn, married Susannah Bourne (1605-1697/96) and they had at least two children: Susannah (1637–1710) and Richard (1640-1712).\n\nGrays Inn where Tobias Cradock was a barrister\n\nRichard Cradock, Snr. married Hester Palmer on 26th July, 1666, at St. Andrew, Totteridge in Hertfordshire. We do not have a baptismal record for Hester but we know that she was the youngest daughter of Andrew and Elizabeth (Hamey) Palmer . Richard and Hester (Palmer) Cradock had number of children (all baptised at St. Mary’s, Hornsey) among who were two daughters: Sarah (1667-1748) and Susannah (1668-1743) and two sons: William (1676-1746) and Richard Cradock, Jnr. (1684-1748).\n\nSusannah Cradock married three times: John Banner, Benjamin Tubman, and John Blunt. Although thrice married, Susannah only had children by her first marriage. Her sister Sarah married Jonathan Boulter but had no children.\n\nRichard and Hester (Palmer) Cradock’s eldest son William married Mary Sheldon and by her had two children who reached adulthood. Richard and Hester (Palmer) Cradock, Snr.’s youngest child, Richard, Jnr., did not marry. Of these four children (Susannah, Sarah, William, and Richard) this paper examines the lives and families of only two: Susannah and Sarah.\n\nSt. Mary’s, Hornsey, in the 18th Century where all of Richard and Hester (Palmer)\n\nCradock’s children were baptised\n\nRichard Cradock, Snr.’s sister, Susannah, married Dr. Henry Barnes (1631-1701) and they had a daughter Susannah (1663-1737) who married John Balchen (1658-1721). John and Susannah (Barnes) Balchen had a son Richard (1692-1738) who married Martha Hitchcock (1698/99-1766) and they had (among other off spring) two daughters: Mary (1721-1798) who married John Man (1718-1783) and Elizabeth (1719-1796) who married George Cumberland, Snr. (i.e. Cradock > Barnes > Balchen > > Man/Cumberland. See chart).\n\nAn important source of information on what follows comes from The Cumberland Letters edited by Clementina Black and published in 1912. Clementina began work on her book by visiting the British Museum and perusing several large leather-bound volumes comprising a remarkable set of correspondence sent to and from George Cumberland, Jnr. (1754-1848), as well as his brother Richard Dennison Cumberland (1752-1825). (George and Richard’s mother was Elizabeth Balchen whose sister Mary married John Man .)\n\nChoosing only from the first of the sixteen volumes of family correspondence and covering just thirteen years, 1771-1784, Clementina produced a book – The Cumberland Letters – that she felt reflected the typical concerns of a large family living during the latter half of the eighteenth century.\n\nConsidering that George Cumberland, Jnr. went on to live another sixty years after 1784, one can only wonder at how much more material lies unmined among the fifteen volumes that Clementina left unopened, not least from a genealogical point of view. However what she did find and publish has made much of what follows possible.\n\nMs. Black notes in her introduction that, before marrying George Cumberland, Snr., Elizabeth Balchen lived with Mrs. Sarah Boulter, Richard Cradock, Snr.’s daughter, who was Elizabeth’s first cousin twice removed.\n\nIn The Cumberland Letters, Sarah (Cradock) Boulter is described by George Cumberland, Jnr. as:\n\n… a lady of large fortune, who resided in St. Mary Axe, London, was a widow and sister to Lady Blunt [Susannah Cradock] of Stratford, both their husbands had been directors in the South Sea Company, and the chief of their property devolved to Rich Cross [Cropp], Esq., their nearest relation, a man of large fortune who lived in Grosvenor Square London, & Richmond Hill and who always considered my mother [Elizabeth Balchen] as a distant relation. p. 19\n\nGeorge is correct in saying that Susannah Cradock’s husband (John Blunt) was a director of the South Sea Company, indeed he was the founder and chief architect of the disastrous scheme that led to the South Sea bubble, but there is no evidence that Susannah’s sister Sarah’s husband, Jonathan Boulter, was connected to the South Sea Company. He was instead an extremely successful distiller / brewer.\n\nAs for the relationship between Elizabeth (Balchen) Cumberland and Richard Cropp which her son George describes above as “distant”; we can more precisely state that they were third cousins, their great grandparents (Richard Cradock, Snr. and Susannah (Cradock) Barnes) being siblings.\n\nThe Thames looking West toward Blackfriars Bridge and Saint Paul’s\n\nSUSANNAH CRADOCK (1668-1743) AND THE BANNER FAMILY\n\nSusannah Cradock, the daughter of Richard and Hester (Palmer) Cradock, was baptized on 4th April, 1668, at St. Mary’s, Hornsey. The baptismal record below shows her as Susan although most other records have her as Susannah or Susanna.\n\nSusan Cradock the daughter of Mr. Richard baptised the 4th day of April 1668\n\nSusannah married John Banner on 11th February, 1690/91, at St. Paul’s, Covent Garden, Westminster.\n\nSt. Paul’s Church, Covent Garden\n\nJohn was born in 1665 and baptised on the 8th August of that year at St. Andrew Undershaft, his parents being Richard and Elizabeth (Chambers) Banner.\n\nAugust 8 John Banner the sonn of Richard Banner and Elizabeth\n\nhis wife, was baptized the 8th day of August 1665\n\nAlthough John had several siblings, none survived to adulthood; a fact confirmed by his father Richard’s will in which it is stated that John is an only child.\n\nThe Banners originated from Birmingham in Warwickshire, and were engaged as ironmongers, bellow-makers, and long-cutlers (sword makers). Their early establishment of furnaces to work iron at Birmingham helped that city become one of England’s first industrial centers.\n\nLess than a month before Susannah’s marriage to John Banner, a settlement was drawn up on 21st January, 1690/91, in which her father, Richard Cradock (Merchant), agreed to pay Richard Banner (Gent of London) father of John the sum of £2,000 while Richard and John Banner agreed to spend £4,000 on the purchase of freehold land for the use of John for 99 years and after his decease for the use of Susannah .\n\nThe marriage between the Banner and Cradock families was also a mercantile union of sorts. In his capacity as a member of the Court [Board] of Directors of the Hudson’s Bay Company, Richard Cradock, Snr. had become acquainted with Samuel Banner, ironmonger of Birmingham, uncle of John, and supplier to the Hudson’s Bay Company of its long knives and swords.\n\nIn 1684 Cradock was appointed Assistant (i.e. Director) to the Royal African Company (RAC), thereby adding to his portfolio of directorships that included not only The Hudson’s Bay Company, but also The East India Company and the Bank of England. Richard held his post with the RAC for almost eleven years\n\nAs part of its trade with the African continent, knives and swords were used by the RAC and, up until 1690, these had been bought either in Holland or from London merchants. However, after 1690, the year John Banner married Susannah Cradock, the company began to obtain its requirements instead from the Birmingham ironmonger Samuel Banner.\n\nThe Birmingham knives produced by Banner were cheaper than those that the RAC had been buying from London and Holland: less than two and a half pence and only one and a half pence for wooden-hafted varieties: the swords were three shillings each, all prices inclusive of carriage by wagon from Birmingham to London. Between 1690 and 1701 Samuel Banner supplied the RAC with over 400,000 knives and 7,000 swords .\n\nIn 1681 the great Turkey merchant and economist Sir Dudley North bought 500 RAC shares and later joined Richard Cradock, Snr. as a director of the company (see DNB). More than one hundred years later, the great grandson of Dudley North and the great great granddaughter of Richard Cradock would marry in 1786 (see North Family Appendix).\n\nAccording to Thomas Hughes, it was Richard Cradock Snr.’s involvement with the Royal African Company that led Daniel Defoe to comment that Cradock: … slept with his prayer book in his left hand and a company prospectus in his right, without letting either know what the other held .\n\nWe should also note that Hester (Palmer) Cradock’s niece Elizabeth, the daughter of her brother Ralph Palmer, married Sir John Verney who, served when a young man (as did Sir Dudley North) as a factor for the Levant Company in Aleppo . A ‘paper’ on the Palmer family and its connection with the Verney and other families is in the offing.\n\nJohn and Susannah (Cradock) Banner had at least eight children: Esther (18th January 1691/92 ); Susannah (14th February 1692/93); Elizabeth (21st April 1694); Sarah (23rd May 1695); Richard (26th May 1696); John (4th July 1697 but he died soon after); and John (16th February 1698/99) (but he likewise died soon after) all of whom were baptised at St. Laurence, Pountney Lane. Two sons were baptised at St. Peter le Poer: Samuell on 30th May, 1700, and a third son named John on 30th November, 1704.\n\nOn each of the first five records from St. Laurence, Pountney Lane, in the left hand margin is written John Banner’s occupation ‘drie/dry/drye salter’; such a notation in such a position is not typical among baptismal records.\n\n1694\n\nElizabeth Banner daughter\n\nof John & Susanna Banner\n\nwas Baptized April ye 21 1694\n\n1695\n\nSarah Banner daughter of John & Susana Banner was Baptized May ye 23 1695 by doctor Whinrop\n\n1696\n\nRichard Banner son of John & Susanna Banner was Baptized May ye 28 1696 By Whinrop\n\n1697\n\nJohn Banner son of John and Susanna Banner was Baptized July ye 4th 1697 by Dr Whinrop\n\n1698/99\n\nJohn Banner son of John & Susana Banner was Baptized february ye 16 1698 by doctor Whinrop\n\nSamuell son of\n\nJohn and Susanna\n\nBanner Born\n\n21 Baptized\n\nmay 30 1700.\n\n[This baptism and the one below took place at St. Peter le Poer]\n\nJohn son of\n\nJohn & Susannah\n\nBanner Born\n\n18 Baptized the\n\n30 of november\n\n1704\n\nThe naming pattern of the Banner children is typical of the times thus Esther is named after her maternal grandmother, Susannah is named after her mother and her maternal great aunt, Elizabeth is named after her paternal grandmother, Sarah after her mother’s sister, Richard is named after his maternal and paternal grandfathers, John after his father and Samuell after his father’s uncle.\n\nJohn Banner’s occupation ‘dry salter’ is defined by the OED as:\n\nA dealer in chemical products used in the arts, drugs, dye-stuffs, gums, etc.; sometimes also in oils, sauces, pickles, etc.\n\nDefoe described a dry salter as someone who …\n\nunderstands very well the buying of cocheneal, indigo, gauls, shumach, logwood, fustick, madder, and the like.\n\nThese are the raw materials needed to produce different paint colours.\n\nJohn’s uncle, Samuel Banner, the ironmonger, in his will dated 7th March, 1714, bequeaths legacies to his late nephew John Banner’s widow Mrs. Susannah Blunt and to her third husband John Blunt as well as to his late nephew John’s four surviving children: Susannah (Cropp), Esther (Purcell), Richard, and John Banner.\n\nElizabeth and Sarah Banner, although both named in their father’s will dated 1700, do not appear in their uncle Samuel’s of 1714 nor their mother Susannah’s of 1742, and so probably did not survive to adulthood.\n\nOn 19th March, 1703, John Banner was nominated a governor of Bridewell Hospital as recorded among the minutes of the board of governors:\n\nBridewell Royal Hospital: Minutes of the Court of Governors [last page]. 19th March, 1703\n\nLadd a Gov. Also Att this Court Mr. John Lad of Southwark was\n\nnominated a Governour of these Hosplls by Mr Lawrence Parker.\n\nBanner nominated a Govr\n\nAnd Mr John Banner Salter in Frogmorton Street by Mr\n\nWesterweize:\n\nBridewell Hospital at the time of John Banner’s appointment as a Governor\n\nJohn Banner died in July, 1707, and was buried at St. Vedast in Fosters Lane. The registry entry runs:\n\nMr. John Banner, Merchant, a Stranger, Dyed & was buried in ye North Ile of this Church by [next to] his Father [Richard] July 25th, 1707.\n\nIn her will John’s widow, Susannah (Cradock) (Banner) (Tudman) Blunt, states that she wishes to be buried in St. Vedast near the remains of her late husband John Banner (see her will below).\n\nA later burial record indicates that another John Banner, one of the surviving adult children of John and Susannah (Cradock) Banner, was also buried at St. Vedast:\n\nJohn Banner was Buried in ye North Ile in ye Church by a Certificate from ye Parish of St Edmond ye King Feb ye 6th, 1722.\n\nJOHN BANNER’S PARENTS AND SIBLINGS\n\nJohn’s parents, Elizabeth Chambers and Richard Banner, were married at St. Christopher le Stocks, on 31st August, 1664.\n\nRichard Banner of ye parish of St And: Undershaft & Elizabeth Chambers of St Allhallowes ye wall were married pr. Licence August ye 31th 1664\n\nRichard Banner was Clerk to the Saddler’s Company from 1671 to 1702. The image here shows the gateway to Saddler’s Hall which was torn down in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nAccording to the Saddler’s guild website, in 1698, Richard gave:\n\n.. a capital sum to the Company to enable apprenticeship premiums to be paid on behalf of poor boys who would otherwise have been unable to enter the saddlery trade. With the addition of later benefactions, Banner’s Charity was subsequently renamed the Apprenticing Charity. Today its income is primarily used to support the training and progression of young saddlers.\n\n(See the Appendix for more details on Richard’s and other Banner charities.) Richard is referred to in Thomas Cradock’s will and elsewhere as ‘Banner of Saddler’s Hall’.\n\nWe have already noted that Susannah’s husband John was the eldest and only surviving child of Richard and Elizabeth (Chambers) Banner. Below are the baptisms and some of the burials, of John’s siblings; the first four are from St. Andrew Undershaft:\n\n1. Richard Banner was baptised on 16th September, 1667.\n\n16 Richard Banner ye son of Richard Banner\n\n& of Elizabeth his wife was\n\nBaptized on ye 16th of September.\n\n2. His burial took place on 4th October, 1667 (last line):\n\n4 Richard Banner ye Son of Richard Banner and of Elizabeth his wife\n\nwas buried the 4th of October\n\n3. In 1668 a Sarah was born and although her baptism has not been located her burial occurred on 6th March, 1669.\n\n6 Sarah Banner daughter of Richard Banner\n\n& of Elizabeth his wife was Buried ye 6th day of March\n\n4. In March, 1669, twin girls were born. One was named Rebeckah and the other was named after the recently deceased Sarah (above). The twins were baptised on 28th March, 1669.\n\n28 Rebeckah Banner & Sarah Banner Daughters\n\nof Richard Banner & of Elizabeth\n\nhis wife were baptized ye 28th of March\n\nPictured below is St. Andrew Undershaft where John Banner and four of his siblings Richard, Sarah (probably), and the twins Rebeckah and Sarah were baptised. After 1669 all Banner baptisms and burials occurred at St. Vedast in Foster Lane.\n\nSt. Andrew Undershaft St. Vedast in Foster Lane\n\nThe original parish records of St. Vedast were destroyed during the Second World War and so images of these do not exist. Fortunately, the records had been previously transcribed and to this extent preserved. The following baptisms and burials of John Banner’s siblings are among the St. Vedast transcriptions. Note that two of the deaths were attributed to ‘ye Teeth’ and one to convulsions.\n\nYEAR NAME DETAILS\n\n1671 Louis Sonne of Richard Banner and Elizabeth his wife was borne the first and Christened ye 4th February 1671.\n\n1671 Rebeckah daughter of Richard Banner was buried in ye Church June 13th 1671.

He identifies himself as being of Sadler’s Hall and a Gent. He wishes to be buried in St. Vedast Foster’s Lane as near as possible to his wife (Elizabeth), although the manner of his internment he leaves up to his son. To each of his grandchildren he bequeaths £4,000 which, if he had four surviving grandchildren (Richard, John, Elizabeth and Sarah [based on his brother Samuel’s will]) would have meant a considerable sum of money for those days.\n\nOthers in his will that he names are his daughter in law Susannah who receives fifty twenty shilling pieces of broad gold. He names his brother Samuel the ironmonger of Birmingham and gives to each of Samuel’s three children (Richard, Elizabeth, and Samuel) ‘a piece of silver plate of value of ten pounds’.\n\nHe refers to an indenture bearing the date 5th July, 1698, made between him and the Wardens and Keepers of the Saddler’s company whereby eight pounds a year would be used ‘for the putting forth yearly of one poor Boy be an apprentice’[see appendix on what happened to Richard Banner’s charity]. He also gives the Saddler’s Company a piece of silver Plate worth twenty pounds.\n\nHe names his nephew John Brierly; his sister Sara Brierly now the wife of John Howall or Howell; and their brother Samuel Brierly\n\nHe names his nephew Edward Synge and forgives him the debt he owes him (Richard). He names Edward’s brother Richard Synge who is in trade as a Goldsmith in Cary-lane. Likewise he forgives the debts of his nephew Robert Banner and he names his two servants.\n\nHe ends his will as follows:\n\nI do make name and appoint my said son John Banner Executor of the station God hath placed him and be a kind and tender husband and father to his wife and children God almighty bless my son his wife and children and what I have and intend for him and his.\n\nRichard adds a codicil about a month later in which he increases the amounts of money he leaves to his nephews and nieces. Probate was granted to son John in 1702, however administration of the estate did not take effect until 1st December, 1708, because John had by then deceased.\n\nJohn’s gifts to the Saddler’s company included:\n\nA pair of Silver Candlestick, 13 inches high, in form of a Roman Doric column, with hollow and cabled flutings, on octagonal bases. In the hollow moulding of the base is, on one side a coat of arms, viz., ermine nd azure a fleur-de-lys counterchanged, a canton Or; on the other side an inscription, The Gift of Richard Banner to the Worshipful Comp. of Sadlers Anno 1702. The illustration below is from A Concise Historical Account of the Worshipful Company of Saddlers. John’s candlesticks can be seen on either side of the silver plate in the middle.\n\nBelow the procession of Mary of Medici, mother of King Charles I’s wife, along Cheapside in 1639 with the Saddler’s Hall on the very right.\n\nIn 1780 a letter appeared in The Gentleman’s Magazine, which fleetingly refers to Richard Banner’s nephew Richard Synge. The writer is identified only as AB.\n\nCapt. Richard Synge, mentioned in [issue] No. 41 [of the Tatler], was a goldsmith in Cary-lane, near Goldsmiths-hall. He was the second husband of my grandmother by the mother’s side; he died in 1734; she died in 1761, aged 83. She was a woman of good education, very intelligent, and full of anecdote. I have frequently heard her say, that Capt. Synge, who was a man of some humour…\n\nBefore we look at the lives of Richard’s surviving grandchildren (Richard, Esther, and Susannah) being the children of his son John and Susannah (Craddock), we shall briefly note a niece Elizabeth and a nephew Richard who were the children of Richard’s brother Samuel.\n\nELIZABETH BANNER THE DAUGHTER OF SAMUEL.\n\nWe have already noted some of the legacies left by Richard’s brother Samuel Banner, the ironmonger and sword maker of Birmingham, and here we briefly note that Samuel also named in his will his daughter Elizabeth and Richard Croft his son in law.\n\nElizabeth was born in 1680 and baptised on 7th March, 1680, at St. Martin, Birmingham in Warwickshire.\n\nIn October 1914, some two hundred years later, the following letter appeared in the Notes and Queries section of The Connoisseur:\n\nUnidentified Portrait No. 150.\n\nDear Sir, I should be very much obliged if your readers could give me any information as to the portrait of which I enclose a photograph. It measures 2 foot 3 inches by 1 foot 2 inches and is of a woman with brown hair and eyes, in a red dress lined with grey, with gold stripes and a white vest. Upon the back of the picture are the words, “Third wife of R. Croft.” There is nil artist’s signature. It was purchased some years ago at the sale of the effects of the late Mr. Kelynge Greenway, near Warwick .\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Elspeth\n\nA response to this inquiry appeared in The Connoisseur for January-April, 1915.\n\nUnidentified Portrait (No. 150), October, 1914.\n\nDear Sir,— I can identify the portrait (No. 150) as that of my great-great-great-grandmother, Elizabeth Banner, daughter of Samuel Banner, of Birmingham, and third wife of Mr. Richard Croft. They were married in 1710. The name of the artist I do not know. Should the owner of this picture wish for further details of their descendants, I can supply them privately.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH. D. J. K. Greenway\n\nTHE REV. DOCTOR RICHARD BANNER & THE SACHEVERELL FAMILY\n\nAnother child of Samuel Banner’s, Richard, also mentioned in his father’s will was born in 1680 and may have been the twin of the above Elizabeth. He eventually became the reverend doctor and his entry in Alumni Oxonienses is as follows:\n\nSon of Samuel of Birmingham, Warwickshire, gent. University College, matriculated 31st March, 1696, aged 16; B. A. 1699; M.A. 1702; B. & D.D. 1727, minister of Marston Chapel, co. Worcester, 25th May, 1704 (the day on which it was consecrated), until his death, author of ‘The Use and Antiquity of Musick in the Service of God. (See Rawlinson, xvi. 125; & Gutch, i. 68.)\n\nIn The Diary of Francis Evans, Secretary to Bishop Lloyd 1699-1706, an entry appears where the bishop consecrates a new church:\n\nOn 25th May, 1704, Richard Banner, M.A., subscribed and took the oaths in order to be admitted and licensed to preach and perform all other Divine Offices in the Chapel of Marston in the Parish of Yardley, County and Diocese of Worcester. On the same day (Ascension Day), my Lord [Bishop Lloyd] went from Sir John Burgoigne’s and consecrated Marston Chapel in the Parish of Yardley. Mr. Rich. Banner (the new Incumbent) preached. My Lord Digby, Sir Charles Holt, and many Persons of quality attended the Solemnity. In the afternoon my Lord consecrated the Chapel yard.\n\nThe title pages of the two books that Richard Banner authored are reproduced below: A Treatise of Simony … published in 1716 (45 pages) and A Sermon Preached …. The Use and Antiquity of Musick in the Service of God published in 1737 (38 pages).\n\nBelow is the entry for Richard’s marriage to Susanna Sacheverell at St. Andrew’s, Holborn, on 14th February, 1716. There appears to have been no issue.\n\n14 The Rev Rich Banner & Susana Sacherval\n\nAs happened quite frequently in the 18th Century, the Banner’s home was broken into and items removed:\n\nFrom the newspapers 4th March, 1727.\n\nWhereas the House of the Rev. Mr. Richard Banner in Birmingham in Warwickshire, was broken open on Monday Night the 27th of February, and besides several fine laced Heads and Ruffles, there was taken away one white Damask Gown and Petticoat lined with Scarlet, one embroidered white Satten Gown and Petticoat lined with green, one full Night-Gown striped with small purple Stripes, faced and robed with a sprigged Linnen, six Tea Spoons mark’d S.S. Whoever gives Notice of them and can discover any of the Persons who took them away, so as they may be brought to Justice, shall have Ten Guineas Reward; or if any of the Accomplices will discover any of the Gang, he shall have his Pardon and the same Reward.\n\nRichard died at St. Giles in Oxford on 10th May, 1750 and he was buried in the chapel of University College.\n\nHenry Sacheverell The Public Advertiser, 2nd May, 1763.\n\nOn Tuesday died in St. Giles’s in this City, aged 94, Mrs. Susannah Banner, Relict of Dr. Richard Banner, formerly Fellow of University College, and Sister of Dr. Henry Sacheverell, who in the Reign of Queen Anne so much distinguished himself.\n\nBy ‘distinguishing himself’ the newspaper notice above refers probably to the fact that Richard Banner’s brother in law, Henry Sacheverell, by means of his incendiary speeches against the low and dissenting churches incited, among other things, the greatest riot that London had ever seen in the eighteenth century.\n\nThe Whig broadside below shows Sacheverell riding the lead horse of a carriage driven by the devil. Sacheverell blows a horn while Moderation, Toleration, Liberty, and Property are all crushed beneath the carriage’s wheels.\n\nA Whig cartoon against Henry Sacheverell\n\nIn the next section we will look at the families of John and Susannah (Cradock) Banner’s three surviving children: Richard who married Mary Davies, Esther who married John Purcell, and Susannah who married Abraham Cropp. For various editorial reasons this does not follow their birth order.\n\nRICHARD BANNER AND THE DAVIES FAMILY\n\nJohn and Susannah (Cradock) Banner’s son Richard was born in 1696 and baptised on 28th May at St. Laurence, Pountney Lane. Some of Richard’s life can be pieced together from various sources.\n\nFor example, the admissions register of Lincoln’s Inn for February 1714/15 has the following entry: 17th February: Richard Banner, son and heir of John Banner of the City of London Gent, deceased.\n\nIn The National Archives a number of records refer to Richard, for instance there is a marriage settlement dated 26th July, 1718, between Richard Banner and Mary Davies with her uncle, Griffith Davies of Birmingham, Doctor in Physick .\n\n1. Richard Banner of Birmingham, Warwickshire Esq. 2. Mary Davies of Birmingham. 3. Griffith Davies of Birmingham, Doctor in Physick. Henry Hinckley of Smithwick, Staffs, Esq. Richard Banner of Birmingham, Clerk. £3,500 1. to 3. £2,000 2. to 3. to buy estates in Warwickshire, Staffs. Leicestershire, Salop, or Worcestshire, to use of 1. Richard Banner for his natural life. 2. Rents to value of £300 to use of Mary for her life for jointure. 3. 1st son of Richard Banner and Mary. 4. Lands not conveyed to Richard Banner then his heirs in default to Trustees. 5. Use of daughters £6000 when 18 or married and £150 p.a. for maintenance – if more daughters then £6000 to be equally shared. 6. £2500 for portions of children born after Richard Banner’s decease.\n\nThe fact that Mary is the daughter of Griffith Davies’s sister (unnamed so far) and yet has Davies as a last name, as well as the absence, so far, of any record of her parents would suggest that she may well have been orphaned and perhaps adopted by her Uncle.\n\nWe noted earlier that, as part of the marriage settlement between Richard’s parents Susannah Cradock and John Banner, John’s father Richard purchased the manors of Boughton (Bowton) and Southoe. The manors eventually devolved to Richard’s grandson Richard as noted by The Victoria County History for Huntingdonshire: “By 1718 the manors of Boughton and Southoe were in the possession of Richard Banner”. On 2nd June, 1718, Richard leased the property and in 1751 he sold the manors to William Finch.\n\nRichard’s various places of residence can be followed from a series of agreements that he entered into so that, for example, between 1721 and 1728 Richard is residing at Hamstead Hall in Staffordshire.\n\nHamstead Hall in Staffordshire\n\nOn 2nd January, 1743, Richard Banner Esq., along with his wife Mary, is of Little Aston in Staffordshire.\n\nBelow adapted from: Miscellaneous Antiquities … By Henry Sanders:\n\nAfter the Scotts’ family left [little] Aston-hall it was in the tenure of Richard Banner, of London … He was a person of good breeding, and great humanity, especially towards the poor, shewn, besides his continual benevolence in giving a whole beef and three guineas at Christmas, yearly, to the distressed of his own parish. His study was fitted with a collection of the most choice and valuable books, which were when he left this place, sold by ________ Purcell, of Worcester, his nephew, for several hundred pounds to Thomas Anson (1695-1773), of Shuckburgh, in the county of Stafford, esq. Richard’s wife was [Mary] _____ sister [niece] to Griffith Davies, of Birmingham, an eminent physician, distinguished too for her charities, one instance of which we remark, which was the keeping a shop of physical drugs, in the management of which she was directed by Samuel Swynsen of Swynsen, esq. M. D. afterwards of Birmingham, well known, and yet remembered for his skill in his profession, and his care in his prescriptions; this good lady died of a cancer in her breast. Her niece [cousin], Mary [Elizabeth] Griffith, only daughter and heir to Griffith Davis*, M. D. with a fortune of 300001. was, upon May 26, 1736, married in Shenstone church to Sir Thomas Cave, of Stanford, in Northamptonshire, baronet; her residence being then at Aston, as ward to her uncle Richard Banner, esq.\n\n* Lord of the manor of Thedingworth in Leicestershire; where a monument is placed to his memory..\n\nIn the collection of The National Trust’s Shugborough Estate, home of the Anson family, there are a number of eighteenth-century armorial bookplates belonging to Richard Banner, with the motto: “Nil sine numine”. When part of this collection was put up for sale in 1842 the catalogue listed one item, Antiquities of Constantinople, as being “… a presentation copy to Richard Banner of Perry Hall [Handsworth] in Staffordshire Esq., the former proprietor of this library to whom this volume is inscribed Lond, 1729”. The catalogue for the second day of Anson’s book sale included “The subscription copies of Richard Banner of Perry Hall County of Stafford, Esq. whose library was purchased by Thomas Anson.”\n\nThomas Anson Richard Banner’s Bookplate\n\nBelow left the title page for Antiquities of Constantinople and right Perry Hall which was demolished by Birmingham City Council in 1927.\n\nAbove, Perry Hall in Staffordshire and left the title page from The Antiquities of Constantinople.\n\nBelow (left) the village of Shenstone at the time that Richard Banner was residing at Aston Hall (right), just outside the village.\n\nView of Shenstone from the Litchfield Road Little Aston Hall, occupied by Richard and Mary banner from about 1743 to1746\n\nOn 22nd December, 1744, Richard and Mary (Davies) Banner are found at Hatton Garden in Middlesex. On 30th August, 1745, Richard Banner, late of Little Aston, Staffs. Esq. is now of St. Andrews, Holborn in Middlesex along with Mary his wife.\n\nBut Richard appears to have run into financial difficulties. One indication of this is that his mother in her will forgives him all his debts. His selling of the two manors of Boughton and Southoe to William Finch in 1751, as well as his book collection to Thomas Aston is another indication. As is a ‘Deed of Defeasance on Mortgage Bond & Judgment entered into by Richard Banner & Sir Thomas Cave’, for £1,200 owed by Richard Banner on 31st August, 1745 [148/2/174]; Sir Thomas Cave having married Elizabeth Davies, cousin of Richard’s wife Mary.\n\nGRIFFITH DAVIES AND THE BURGOYNE, VERNEY, AND CAVE FAMILIES\n\nMary (Davies) Banner’s uncle Griffith Davies was born in 1668 probably at Dryslwyn in Carmarthen. He married Elizabeth Burgoyne and they had one daughter also Elizabeth who was born in 1716 and baptised at St. Philips, Birmingham, on 18th February, 1716. The death date of Griffith Davies is not certain. Between January, 1721 and August, 1722, he wrote his will and some sources base his death on the date of his will, which is incorrect. Another claim based on his wall monument at Theddingworth would have him dying in 1772 which would make him 104 years old. Elizabeth (Burgoyne) Davies died on 29th July, 1726, aged 47.\n\nSt. Philip’s Birmingham Griffith Davies\n\nElizabeth Davies married Sir Thomas Cave 5th Bart. (1712-1748) in November 1735. They had two sons and two daughters however, however the baronetcy became extinct on the death of their son Sir Charles Cave.\n\nSir Thomas Cave’s mother was Margaret Verney whose mother was Elizabeth (Palmer) Verney the niece of Hester (Palmer) Cradock. Thus Richard Banner was the second cousin of Sir Thomas Cave’s mother.\n\nBelow Mary (Davies) Banner’s uncle Griffith Davies is seated far right next to his daughter Elizabeth (Davies) Cave. Her husband Thomas Cave is standing to her right with their children in the grounds of Stanford Hall. It was painted by Arthur Devis in 1749. Baptisms of two of the Cave’s children have been located at Wandsworth (IGI P01901-1): John Cave baptized on 7th November, 1734 and Charles James baptized 20th May, 1739. Also, at Gilmorton in Leicestershire Thomas Cave was baptized on 18th June, 1738 (IGI Index I04340-0).\n\nSir Thomas Cave and his family\n\nIn the church of All Saints, Theddingworth, on the south side is a large mural monument to Griffith Davies and his wife Elizabeth (Burgoyne). It is without figures or ornaments, except a fluted border and an urn at the top, and having on it the arms of Davies and Burgoyne as shown below.\n\nThe top of the monument (left) at All Saints showing the Burgoyne and Davies arms. The monument (right) shows the arms of Cave (red hand) and Davies below.\n\nElizabeth (Burgoyne) Davies was the aunt of the British army general John Burgoyne who, on 7th October, 1777, suffered the first major British defeat during the American War of Independence at Saratoga, New York.\n\nThe British surrender at Saratoga and General Burgoyne, Elizabeth (Burgoyne) Davies’ nephew.\n\nBelow Stanford Hall the home of the Cave family.\n\nStanford Hall\n\nThe only time Thomas Cave spoke in parliament was on 22nd March, 1777, which was against the bill to abolish the observation of the execution of King Charles I.

Margret and Richard Banner were second cousins.\n\nESTHER BANNER (1691-1720) AND THE PURCELL FAMILY\n\nIn January, 1691, John and Susannah (Cradock) Banner’s first child, Esther, was born and on the 18th of that month she was baptised at St. Laurence, Pountney Lane.\n\nEsther Banner daughter of John & Susanah Banner was Baptized January 18th 1691\n\nNote again in the left margin John’s profession as ‘drie salter’.\n\nEsther married John Purcell, although as yet no record has been located, and they had the following five children: Maria Teresa, James, John, Edward, and Thomas. Of these children we know nothing except for Maria Teresa and of her we know very little.\n\nEsther (Banner) Purcell died aged 29 at the end of May, 1720, and was buried on 1st June, 1720, at St. Pancras Old Church. The notations after her name (recorded as Hester) indicate that she is from foreign parts (For.) and a Roman Catholic (R.C.) which would comport with what little we know of her life. Her death in 1720 would also explain why she is not mentioned in either her husband’s or her mother’s wills.\n\nJune 1st Hester Purcell For. & R.C. Affid –\n\nSt. Pancras old church where Esther (Banner) Purcell was buried on 1st June, 1720\n\nTHE PURCELL FAMILY\n\nJohn Purcell had seven siblings: four sisters, three of whom did not marry – Winfred, Mary, and Anne. The fourth, Catherine, married Thomas Penson. And then there were three brothers Thomas, Edward, and Philip.\n\nThe Purcell family was Catholic and adhered to its religion with tenacity, bearing fines and suffering discrimination through the centuries. Six of John‘s seven siblings refused to take the Oath of Allegiance to George I in 1715, and as a result were fined. On the other hand, John and his brother Edward did take the oath, which allowed them certain legal rights denied the others. These rights had some bearing on who could inherit what and who taxed or not when it came to inheritance. As a result we shall see the ‘taking of the oath’ would be an issue for John in writing his will.\n\nBecause the Purcell family was a fractious lot some used their wills to express their frustrations with each other. As a result, we are able to piece together (although not always very clearly) some of the issues that pitted one against the other.\n\nFrom his will, we learn that John is particularly vexed by his sister in law Catherine (Brooke) Purcell, the widow of his brother Thomas Purcell. She appears to have somehow ‘obstructed’ the administration of John’s father’s estate as well as that of his brother Thomas’s. In particular, he believes that she is obliged to pay out certain monies by order of the courts, although his point is somewhat obscure:\n\n….but be paid by Catherine Purcell my brother Thomas’s Widow pursuant to an award made about the fourteenth of July 1726 by Mr. Baron Cummins and Sarjeant Darnall consented to by the said Catherine and by Mr Edward Webb of Grays Inn council for all the annuitants which said award is filed and proved by affidavits in the Kings Bench and may if necessary be confirmed in Chancery and if the said Catherine should withdraw herself or prove insolvent or even if she should not – sufficient proofs will be found amongst my writings to make Walter Stubbs of Borkbury Con Salop attorney at Law and William Ashwood of Madeley County Salop Gent […] lyable to such or far greater sums and it is my Request that as soon as money can be spared to do it my Executors will take admin and endeavour to recover all they can for my children from my said Brothers Widow ….\n\nOn her part, John’s sister-in-law Catherine (Brooke) Purcell, gives us no clue in her will as to why John Purcell was so aggrieved by her as there is no reference to the Purcell family anywhere in it. Instead Catherine has a bone or two to pick with her own Brooke family.\n\nDetails of Catherine’s will, as well as those of John’s sisters Mary and Winifred Purcell, and other members of the Purcell and Brooke families are given in the appendix.\n\nThe Purcell family and Catherine Brooke share a common ancestor both being descended from Robert Brooke (d.1558) who was Speaker of the House of Commons during the reign of Queen Mary and who was knighted by her husband King Philip of Spain. The Purcell family is descended from Robert’s daughter Mary who married Thomas Leveson while Catherine is descended from his son Basil Brooke (see Appendix)\n\nThe Will of John Purcell, Snr., being the Father of John\n\nJohn Purcell of Madeley in the County of Salop in his will, dated 25th February, 1711, names his wife and all eight of his children and makes the following bequests:\n\nTo his wife Catherine: One Hundred Pounds a year during her natural life according to a Rent charge I formerly made unto her and now in her hands.\n\nTo son Thomas fifty pounds.\n\nTo sons Philip and Edward twenty pounds a year each.\n\nTo daughters Mary, Catherine, Winifred, and Anne twenty pounds each. He then writes:\n\nAs to my son John [who married Esther Banner] to whom I have already given what I am able I desire he may have fifty pounds if my estate will bear it. …\n\nWhereas there is the sum of fifty pounds left as a legacy to my daughter Mary by her uncle Richard Giffard I desire the same (fifty pounds) may be paid to her as it conveniently can be raised And whereas my daughter Catherine has a legacy of Forty Pounds left by her aunt Dorothy and Ten Pounds by her aunt Elizabeth Purcell I desire the said sum be paid to her as soon as it conveniently can be raised.\n\nThe reference to ‘uncle Richard Giffard’ supports the notion that this Purcell family is that which is depicted on the Visitation of Staffordshire shown below. Likewise, the aunts Dorothy and Elizabeth mentioned by John, Snr. also appear on the Visitation.\n\nJohn Purcell, Snr. warns the beneficiaries of his estate, i.e. his children, that if:\n\nAny difference should hereafter arise about the performance of my will betwixt my executors and Legatys or any person herein concerned. My will and meaning is that such difference be referred to the Arbitration and Award of Thomas Whitegrave of Madly in the County of Stafford aforesaid Gentleman.\n\nHe appoints as his executors his wife Catherine and sons Philip and Edward. The will is witnessed by John Ashwood, William Ashwood, and Mary Poole. A codicil was added on 31st January, 1712, which did not alter the provisions of the will.\n\nThe Career of John Purcell, MD (1674-1730)\n\nAccording to The Roll of the Royal College of Physicians of London, Esther (Banner) Purcell’s husband John was:\n\nA native of Shropshire and a doctor of medicine of Montpelier of 29th May, 1699, and was admitted a Licentiate of the College of Physicians 3rd April, 1721. His name disappears from the College lists in 1731. He was the author of A Treatise of Vapours or Hysterick Fits, London, 1702 and A Treatise of the Cholick, London, 1714.\n\nPurcell’s medical training in France may well have been because Catholics in England were denied the opportunity of becoming physicians although his subsequent ability to practice in England might have been because he, unlike most of his siblings, ‘took the oath’.\n\nFrom the first edition of the Dictionary of National Biography:\n\nPURCELL, JOHN (1674 – 1730) physician was born in Shropshire about 1674 and in 1696 became a student of medicine in the university of Montpellier where he attended the lectures of Pierre Chirac (image right) then professor of medicine for whom he retained a great respect through life (see Of Vapours p. 48). After taking the degrees of bachelor and licentiate he graduated MD on 29 May 1699. He practised in London and in 1702 published A Treatise of Vapours or Hysteric Fits of which a second edition appeared in 1707. The book is dedicated to the Honourable Sir John Talbott his ‘near relation’ and gives a detailed clinical account of many of the phenomena of hysteria mixed up with pathology of the school of Thomas Willis. His preface is the latest example of the type of apology for writing on medicine in the English tongue so common in books of the eighteenth century. He shows much good sense pointing out that there are no grounds for the ancient belief that the movement of the uterus is related to the symptoms of hysteria and supports the statement of Sydenham that similar symptoms are observable in men. Their greater frequency in women he attributes to the comparative inactivity of female life. He recommends crayfish broth and Tunbridge waters but also seeing plays, merry company, and airing in the parks. In 1714 he published at J Maphew’s A Treatise of the Cholick dedicated to his relative Charles duke of Shrewsbury of which a second edition appeared in 1715. This work shows less observation than his former book but contains the description of an autopsy which he witnessed at Montpellier giving the earliest observation in any English book of the irritation produced by the exudation in peritonitis on the hands of the morbid anatomist. On 3 April 1721 he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London. He died on 19 Dec 1730. [See: Munk’s Coll of Phys ii, 77. Astruc’s Memoires pour servir a l’Histoire de la Faculte de Midecine de Montpelier Paris 1767 Works NM]\n\nThe ‘near relative’, Sir John Talbott, to whom John Purcell dedicates his first book is puzzling. In ‘Genealogy of Shropshire’ by Joseph Morris there is a record for a marriage between John Purcell of The Hay and Catherine Talbot; where Catherine’s father is John Talbot. If these two John Talbots are one and the same then he is John Purcell’s maternal grandfather.\n\nHowever other sources indicate a Thomas Talbot as Catherine’s father. For instance at the Shropshire archives there is a:\n\n‘.. drawing of a monumental inscription (with coat of arms) of John Purcell (d. 1713), who married Catharine Talbot, daughter of Thomas Talbot and Catharine Talbot. And a monumental inscription of Thomas Purcell (d. 1719). All at Madeley’.\n\nThis Thomas Purcell was probably John’s elder brother who married Catherine Brooke. The confusion around Catherine (Talbot) Purcell’s ancestry is regrettable.\n\nAs for his ‘relative Charles duke of Shrewsbury’ to whom John Purcell dedicates his second book, the connection must have been through the Talbot family since this is the family name of the dukes of Shrewsbury, but how exactly is not yet known.\n\nJohn Purcell appears below on a one page broadsheet dated 1728 in the last column as a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, where he is the only member whose address is shown as just Country.\n\n1728\n\nThe tile pages of John’s two books are reproduced below:\n\nBelow an advertisement for A Treatise of Vapours:\n\nA Treatise of Vapours, or Hysterick Fits, Containing an Analytical Proof of its Causes, Mechanical Explanations of all its Symptoms and Accidents, according to the newest and most Rational Principles: Together with its Cure at large. By John Purcell, M.D. Printed and Sold by N. Cox, at the Bible without Temple Bar, 1702.\n\nThe preface of A Treatise of Vapours contains an extended justification of his position as the following passage shows:\n\nTo please all Men is absolutely impossible; and I am so far from imagining I have done it, that I expect more Criticks upon this small Treatise, than upon any Book of its kind which has come out these many years: Besides the general ones, I expect the particular Censure of two sorts of men; The first are, the Galenick Old-fashion’d Doctors, who explicate all things by Hidden Qualities, which give others just as clear an idea of what they would explain, as they themselves have of the true Mechanism of Man’s Body, which they know nothing at all of; but these I fear not, all the Learned of this Age are sufficiently convinc’d of their Errors, and ’tis long since that all these Occult Qualities have been banished from Minerva’s School; and nothing is now acceptable, but what is explain’d Mechanically by Figure and Motion. The second are our Modern Physicians, who though they are convinc’d that the Body of Man is a Machine, which is acted all by inward Springs and Motions, yet may think it Arrogance for a young Physician to pretend to explain to them by other Notions than what Ingenious Willis and his Followers have deliver’d to us: But I must beg their pardon if I lay aside his, to ground my self upon the more solid and Rational Principles of that Penetrating Philosopher Doctor Chirac Professor of Physick in the University of Montpellier, to whose Works (which will shortly be publish’d) I referr them, to be convinc’d of the Solidity of those Principles, which the brevity this Treatise requires, will not permit me to establish.\n\nAs for those Ingenious Gentlemen who are well-vers’d in Modern Philosophy, Geometry, and the Structure of Man’s Body, ’tis them I’d chuse to be my Judges. And I hope the Fair Sex (for whose benefit this Book was chiefly design’d) will, in requital of my Labour, excuse the Impoliteness of my stile, and some hard words, which the subject render’d impossible for me to avoid.\n\nPurcell gives as complete an analysis of the symptoms, causes, and treatment of ‘Vapours and Hystericks’ as could be imagined for those days, not that this makes much, if any, sense to us these days. On page three he describes some of the symptoms of ‘The Vapours’ which appear to be analogous to an epileptic fit:\n\nThose who are troubled with Vapours, generally perceive them approach in the following manner; first, they feel a Heaviness upon their Breast; a Grumbling in their Belly; they Belch up, and sometimes Vomit, Sower, Sharp, Insipid, or Bitter Humours: They have a Difficulty in breathing; and think they feel something that comes up into their throat, which is ready to choak them; they struggle; Cry out; make odd and inarticulate sounds, or mutterings; they perceive a swimming in their heads; a Dimness comes over their Eyes; they turn pale; are scarce able to stand; their Pulse is weak, they shut their Eyes; Fall down; and remain senseless for sometime; afterwards by little and little, their Pulse returns; their Face regains its natural colour; their Body grows hot as before; they Open their Eyes, Sigh, and by degrees come to themselves.\n\nThere are many who when these Accidents are over, come quietly to themselves by degrees; and in others, when the violent Cold is ended, a no less violent Heat succeeds; which casts them again into many of the former Accidents, as Palpitations of the Heart; Headaches; Giddiness; Difficulty in breathing; and into some new ones, as Flushing of the face; Raving; Convulsions; Foaming at the Mouth; Violent Beating of the Muscles and Arteries; and a Tingling Sensation in the Thighs, which were Paralytick during the Cold fit, nay sometimes the Palsy will continue in the Hot fit too.\n\nWhat was ‘new’ in Purcell’s thinking was that traditionally ‘The Vapours’ were blamed on fumes given off by a ‘distempered womb, rising up through the organs’, instead Purcell argued that they were the result of an organic obstruction located:\n\nIn the Stomach and Guts; whereof the Grumbling of the one and the Heaviness and uneasiness of the other generally preceding the Paroxysm, are no small Proofs.\n\nBecause he detached the source of ‘The Vapours’ from the womb this meant that men, as well as women, could become susceptible to them. Consequently both genders could experience ‘hysterick fits’.\n\nOn 22nd August, 1719, John lent his name to the following reassuring public notice:\n\nBath, Aug 22. 1719.\n\nWHereas it has been maliciously and industriously reported in and about London, as we have been inform’d, that there rages in this City a malignant Distemper; These are to inform the Publick, that the City of Bath is free from any such Distemper; and that the said City was never healthier than at this Time, and that the said Report is entirely false and groundless. Witness our Hands. …. John Purcell, M.D. [et al].\n\nAmong papers titled Tower Records, iii, 1722, is the following:\n\nOrder for letting Doctor Purcell to visit Lord North and Grey in his illness. N.B. He chose Purcell a papist who attended Lord North and Grey for a fever.\n\nWilliam Lord North and Grey was committed to the Tower of London for treason on 27th October, 1722 . The fact that the Keeper of the Tower refers to Purcell as a ‘papist’, would indicate that John retained his faith while yet taking ‘the oath’. This needs clarification.\n\nThe following is from A Survey of London, published in 1900 by The London County Council:\n\nDr. John Purcell, a prominent London physician, who published A Treatise of Vapours …. and A Treatise of the Cholick was living at No. 10 Denmark Street in 1730. He died in the same year. The door case at No. 10 shown here [photograph] is an 18th-century addition.\n\nA publication below: Essays upon Several Subjects by Sir Richard Blackmore is among several contemporary works that refers approvingly to Purcell’s ideas and his practice as a physician.\n\nSir Richard Blackmore\n\nThose who would see this Subject [hysteria] treated more fully, and with more Accuracy and Method, I refer to Dr. Willis on Hysterick Affections, and to Dr. Purcell, a learned Gentleman, not only well vers’d in the Theory, but likewise skilful in the Practice of Physick, in whose Treatise on this Distemper the Reader will find many useful Observations, and instructive as well as curious Experiments.\n\nOn 20th December, 1730, John’s death was announced in the newspapers:\n\nA few Days since died Dr. Purcell, an eminent Physician, Author of a Treatise on the Vapours\n\nThe Will of Doctor John Purcell\n\nWe have already extracted one passage from John’s will, regarding his sister in law Catherine, the widow of his brother Thomas. Here we detail some of the legacies that John left.\n\nJOHN PURCELL, of the Hay, in the parish of Madeley, co. Salop, Doctor in Physic and of the College of Physicians in London, writes his will dated 3rd April, 1729. He divides his estate equally among his four sons James, John, Edward, and Thomas and his daughter Mary Teresa. Esther, his wife, having died nine years earlier is, of course, not mentioned.\n\nHe bequeaths one hundred pounds a year to his mother Catherine and his brother Edward.\n\nHe bequeaths fifty pounds a year to ‘my brother Richard Banner’s now wife [Mary Davies]’. [i.e. Richard being John’s late wife Esther’s brother]\n\nHe also writes that should all of his children die without issue then he bequeaths:\n\n… all the Remainder and Remainders of all my estate both Real and Personal to my brother in law Richard Banner Esq who I leave and constitute Guardian of all my five Children …. Lastly I leave unto my Mother in Law Lady Blunt and my Brother in Law Richard Banner Esquire Executors of this my last will Testament.\n\nOf course Lady Blunt was Susannah (Cradock) Banner, the mother of John Purcell’s wife Esther.\n\nJohn Purcell claims in his will that his estate is not liable to certain taxes that it would otherwise have been because he had “taken the oath”. As a result, he is free to take:\n\n…. all my Estates freehold and Leasehold by Right and by inheritance as firmly and as legally as any Subject of all England ever did nor can there be any objection to me on the penal statutes I having insured any such penalty nor ever refused taking the oaths or been summoned so to do the —— which may be pretended by any of the annuitants on my Estates ought not to affect my children…\n\nJohn believed that since he had taken the oath his beneficiaries were entitled to receive their annuities without additional fines that Catholics might otherwise have been liable to. And, as often happened, in order to ensure that the beneficiaries of his will did not question or challenge one another or argue among themselves, he suggests that those fines could be re-imposed on any one among them who would argue or question:\n\nMy will and desire is that the penal statutes [against Catholics] be never taken against my mother [Catherine], or any of my brothers and sisters (except my brother-in-law Thomas Penson) to deprive them of the annuities left them by my father’s will, but if they sue for more than such annuities, or for a receiver on my estates, or for any distribution of my estates, my express will is that those penal statutes be then taken against them which hinder Roman Catholics from taking interest in lands, and that rather because several of them have unfairly obstructed the probate of my brother Thomas Purcell’s will.\n\nJohn’s complaint against his brother in law Thomas Penson suggested above by the fact that he was willing to have Thomas Penson bear fines leads him to write further that should Thomas challenge or argue then he should: … pay double taxes to the utmost extent for his annuity and that he never be suffered to have any management or to intermeddle in the ——- of my estate.\n\nThere is nothing in Thomas Penson’s will, nor in any of John’s siblings’ wills to help clarify John’s complaint (see Appendix).\n\nJohn’s will was probated on 20th November, 1732. On 9th December, 1751, administration of the estate was handed to John Purcell’s son John because Susannah Blunt had died before she had ‘taken on the execution thereof’ and Richard Banner had chosen not to carry out his executorial duties.\n\nAs seen below, a total of seven members of the Purcell family including John’s siblings Thomas, Philip, Winifred, Mary, and Anne appear on a list of Roman Catholics who were forced to “register their names and real estates” and subsequently fined because they had refused to take the oath. For his fellow Catholics John’s willingness to take the oath was enough to have him named an apostate (see – Records of the English Catholics of 1715).\n\n15 cords of the English Catholics of 1715) Records of the English Catholics of 1715\n\nMiscellaneous Jottings on the Purcell Family\n\nEnglish Catholics often sent their children abroad to receive a proper Catholic education. And, in the case of the Purcell family, some were sent to Lisbon in Portugal to attend the English College. In the Historical Account of Lisbon College is a list of students who attended the school, including:\n\nPURCELL, Edward, son of Edward Purcell, of Stafford, gent., by his wife Elizabeth Langley; admitted on Revell’s Fund, Nov. 5, 1730. [The nephew of Doctor John Purcell]\n\nPURCELL, James, brother of Edward, q.v.; admitted on Revell’s Fund, June 9, 1730. [Likewise the nephew of the doctor]\n\nPURCELL, Philip, son of John Purcell, of The Hay, Madeley, co. Salop, Esq., and of his wife Catherine; admitted (1696?); ordained a priest and was chaplain at Arundel Castle, in 1717. [The brother of doctor]\n\nAlso a deed dated 30th December, 1690, held at the Birmingham Archives shows: Edward Revell, of Shifnal, Shropshire, in pursuance of his right to nominate students to the English Catholic Colleges at Douai and Lisbon, devises power of nomination after his decease to John Talbot, of Longford, Shropshire, and Thomas Giffard, of Chillington, Staffordshire; signed and sealed and witnessed by John Purcell and Will Turner. [This John Purcell being the ‘senior’ not the MD]\n\nAmong the records at The National Archives is the following:\n\nCATHERINE PURCELL, widow [Mother of John Purcell,MD etc.] Annuity out of “Yieldfields” by indenture, dated 4th October, 1675, between John Purcell, of Madeley, co. Salop, of one part, and George Talbot, of Worfield, of other part.\n\nThe last line above shows Edward Purcell’s marriage to Elizabeth Langley\n\nThe Hay Farm\n\nIn their wills, some of the Purcell family, including John, state that they are ‘of The Hay in Madeley’ in Shropshire; The Hay being a large red brick farm house which is still standing above Coalport and commanding enviable views along the Severn valley. In 1544 the Hay was sold to Sir Robert Brooke who later built himself a new house at Madeley Court. In 1683 the Hay past to the Purcell family. In 1705 the Hay was bought by John Ashwood and William Phillips but the following year it was resold to the trustees for the heirs of John Purcell, Snr. In the 19th century it was owned by the founder of the Coalport china company.\n\nThe Hay, home of the Purcell family\n\nOn a portrait of the composer Henry Purcell there is drawn some arms (barry wavy of six argent and gules on a bend sable three boars heads couped of the first) which according to the Dictionary of National Biography (DNB) (1st Ed.) connects the composer with the family of Purcell of Onslow, Shropshire, from which the Staffordshire Purcells are supposed to be descended. Whether it does or not has yet to be shown.\n\nThe last mention of this Purcell family in the newspapers occurs in The London Evening Post on 23rd July, 1752, almost twenty years after the decease of the doctor, and concerns a claim against various family members’ estates as a result of a mortgage having been taken out on John Purcell, Snr.’s estate and owing to a Mr. Fowler.\n\nAll Persons who are Creditors to John Purcell of the Hay, in the Parish of Madeley in the County of Salop, Gentleman, deceased, and of his Sons Thomas and Doctor John Purcell, late of the same Place, both also deceas’d, are desir’d to send an Account of their respective Claims to Mr. Alexander Jesson, at his Chambers, No. 11, in the Paper-Buildings in the Inner-Temple, London; or to Mr. Homer, of Sutton Coldfield in the County of Warwick, on or before the 1st of August next. And whereas there is suspected to be a Mortgage subsisting, made either by the said John Purcell or Thomas Purcell, to one Mr Fowler, suppos’d to be late of St. Thomas’s in Staffordshire, sometime before the Year 1715: Whoever has the same in Custody, or can give any Intelligence of the same, or has any Claim in Respect thereof, is desir’d to send an Account thereof in Manner above-mention’d.\n\nThe Purcells, being armigerous minor gentry, returned a pedigree for the Visitation of Staffordshire (1663) where John Purcell’s father (John, Snr.) is shown not yet married. The pedigree was made by his brother Richard who appears on the page below married to Elizabeth Chetwynd, etc. John, Snr.’s names his four daughters after his sisters shown below: Anne, Catherine, Winifred, and Mary.\n\nFor more details on the Purcell family see the Appendix.\n\nDespite having had four sons all of whom reached adulthood, no further records have yet been located that would throw light on their lives. There is a brief mention of a _______ Purcell, the nephew of Richard Banner, who disposes of his uncle’s book collection. Only the daughter, Maria Teresa, has left a trace of her existence.\n\nMARIA THERESA PURCELL AND THE COTTON FAMILY\n\nJohn and Esther (Banner) Purcell’s only daughter, Maria Teresa, married Thomas Cotton on 27th May, 1746, at Westminster Abbey as the entry in The Marriage, Baptismal, and Burial Registers of the Collegiate Church or Abbey of St. Peter, Westminster … indicates:\n\nThe marriage was noted by the newspapers:\n\nMr. Thomas Cotton, an eminent Merchant in Tower-Street, London, to Miss Maria Teresia Purcell, a young Lady possessed of every Accomplishment capable to make the Marriage-State happy, with a Fortune of 12,000 pounds.\n\nThomas and Maria Teresa (Purcell) Cotton had two children. A son Thomas was born on 15th March, 1748, and baptised on 3rd April, 1748, at St. Dunstan in the East.\n\nThomas son of Thomas & Maria\n\nTheresa Cotton born March 15th 1747-48 & baptiz’d April\n\n3d 1748.\n\nA daughter, Elizabeth, is mentioned in Richard Cropp’s will and elsewhere although a baptismal record has not yet been located.\n\nWe know little of Maria Teresa (Purcell) Cotton. She is mentioned in a number of relations’ will such as her cousin James Cropp’s dated 1767 where she is living as a widow at Kensington Gore. She inherited from her aunt Winifred Purcell an ‘unaltered tabby’ cat and a green damask dress.\n\nAt the National Archives she appears alongside her brothers and her husband in a legal case involving land at Madeley:\n\nTrinity 26 George II (circa 1753) Robert Fox Plaintiff. John, Edward and Thomas Purcell, Thomas Cotton and Maria Teresa, defendants: 6 houses and 220 acres of land, etc., in Madeley.\n\nThis case may have had to do with the claim of an outstanding mortgage on the estates of John Purcell, Snr. and John Purcell, MD mentioned in the newspaper notice above dated 23rd July, 1752.\n\nApart from the above records, and a few others not noted, no other documents relating to Thomas and Maria Teresa (Purcell) Cotton have been found.\n\nWestminster Abbey where Maria Teresa Purcell\n\nmarried Thomas Cotton in 1746\n\nThomas Cotton, Jnr.’s Letters to George Cumberland, Snr.\n\nIn The Cumberland Letters there are two letters by and some references to a young man called Thomas Cotton. Clementina Black does not identify how Thomas might be connected to the Cumberland/Balchen families but, as we have shown, he is the son of Thomas and Maria Teresa (Purcell) Cotton, grandson of John and Esther (Banner) Purcell, and the great grandson of John and Susannah (Cradock) Banner. He was thus the third cousin once removed of Elizabeth (Balchen) Cumberland.\n\nThomas’s letters were written to George Cumberland, Snr., Elizabeth Balchen’s husband, and from them we learn that he is a soldier serving in India.\n\nLetter No. I\n\nEllore Garrison Circars (or Circass) [India] Jan 22 1771\n\nDear Sir\n\nYour Letter dated June 10 1770, I did not receive Till June 21 1771 you mention your sending it on board the ‘Dolphin’ Frigate of War, but it came to me by the ‘Queen’ East Indiaman, For the future should be much oblidg’d to you to put them in at the India House, & they come to me much safter, than by Private Hands, was I settled at the Presedency, it would do very well to send them that way but am Eight Hundred miles from it, when they are Thrown about in the offices, & seldom come to hand. I hope you to excuse the Liberty I take in desiring you to put them in the India House, as it will be the means of my allways receiving them safe & directly as there Landed. The Trouble you Take for my Dear mother [Maria Teresa], sister & self lays me under the greatest obligations to you, which I hope to God I never shall be Unmindful, as at Present all I have in my Power is to acknowledge them, which I hope you think sincere as I assure you they are. Mr [Beeston] Long & Mr Cross [Richard Cropp] our kind Benefactors all we can do is to offer up our Prayers for there Healths & Happynesses, as it will be out of our Powers ever to return those numberless Obligations we lay under To them. It gives me great Pleasure to hear Mr Cross [Cropp] has concented To their going to France, for they’ll not only live cheaper, but it will be the means of my Sister improving of her Education, I enjoy my health here, to the full as well as in England, India is made Twenty Times worse in England than it really is, the heat is very Great, To be sure, but refrain from Excess of Drinking, & you’ll weather it very well, its drinking that kills Two thirds of our Gentlemen here, not the Climate, we have been at Peace ever since I been here, only a few skyrmishes, with the Poligars, & Cottires & they do not Trouble us much, we expect, To hear of a war, by every ship that comes in. Let it come as soon as it will we are prepared for it here in this Part of the World, and only wate for another [order] to March to Manila, Pray my best Respects To Mrs. Cumberland & complements To your sons. And believe me,\n\nYour much oblidged, humble Servt,\n\nThomas Cotton.\n\nTo Mr. Cumberland:\n\nI forgot to mention to you that I gott some friends at Madrass who has gott me removed into a Battlion of Seapoys which is Ten Pagodoes a month addition to my Pay, which makes it about Thirteen Pounds Sterling a month, this I send down to Madrass to go by the duke of Portland, if not too late, if it is am not certain what ship it will go by, shall Take the Liberty of sending you another Packett in a few weeks.\n\nLetter No. 2\n\nELLORE, Sep. 28, 1771.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI take the Liberty of Troubling you with another Packett, which comes to you by the Stag frigate Sir John Lindsy [Lindsay] Commander. I still preserve my health very well I have no news here to send you only that we have sent an army of thirty thousand men under the Command of General Smith against the King of Tanjore, they marched the 1st of this month To lay siege to his fort, the Particulars will acquaint you with in my nextFF FF, I have never received a line from Mr. Redman or my Uncle Edward Purcell it gives me great concern, he should refuse to Write to me as I am conscious I never disobliged him pray my best compliments To Mrs Cumberland & family,\n\nAnd am,\n\nSir\n\nYour Obliged Humble Servant\n\nThomas Cotton\n\nGeorge Cumberland, Jnr. maintained contact with Thomas Cotton after George’s father died in November, 1771, and he kept his brother Richard up to date with Thomas’ Indian adventures:\n\n… T. Cotton is well & I believe succeeds …\n\nAnd, in response to George’s updates about Thomas, Richard remarks that he is:\n\n… very glad to hear Mr. Cotton is so happily situated; & if He goes on at the rate you mention, shall very soon expect to see Him a Nabob.\n\nHowever, through The Cumberland Letters we learn that in January, 1781, George Cumberland, Jnr. received news of ‘poor Cotton’s fate’. Clementina Black comments that:\n\nIt is probably safe to assume that, while serving with his regiment in India, Thomas was killed in battle. George, helpful as usual, had been looking after some property in Westminster for the benefit of his mother [Maria Teresa (Purcell) Cotton] and sister [Elizabeth].\n\nNext we turn to Esther’s sister’s family Susannah Banner who married Abraham Cropp.\n\nSUSANNAH BANNER AND THE CROPP FAMILY\n\nJames Cropp – The father of Abraham\n\nJames Cropp was born in Holland and emigrated to England. Toward the end of the 1670’s, he married Abigail Bush, probably after he emigrated. (Cropp may be a short form of Croppenburgh)\n\nJames and Abigail had at least three children of whom two survived, Abraham and Elizabeth. The burial of a daughter, Abigail, at St. Margaret Pattens took place on 22nd March, 1679.\n\nAbigail ye Daughter of James Crop was buried ye 22d of March in St. Margaret Pattens 1679.\n\nWe know very little of James’s life other than his being a successful merchant and an elder of the Dutch church at Augustin Fryars in London.\n\nJames died in December, 1723, and on the 9th of that month he was buried in the Dutch Church at St. Augustin Fryars, in accordance with his wishes expressed in his will. The armorial shown here is from the floor of the church beneath which James is buried. The inscription is only partially visible as the floor has been raised, covering the rest of the gravestone.\n\nThe Dutch Church at St. Augustin Fryars\n\nJames wrote his will in 1723. In it he refers to himself as a merchant living at Richmond. He bequeaths to his wife Abigail the sum of two thousand pounds as well as his house at Richmond.\n\nHe makes various bequests to his son Abraham and his grandchildren James (who was his godson), Richard, and Sarah. He also names his daughter Elizabeth who is the wife of Abraham Henckell, a Dutch merchant living in London, as well as their six children: James (also his godson), Abraham, Tilman, Isaac, Elizabeth, and Susannah.\n\nJames leaves bequests to the Dutch Church at St. Augustin Fryars in London, as well as the Dutch Reformed Church in ‘in parts beyond the sea’ at Hamborough (Hamburg) and at Altona .\n\nIn April, 1727, six years after James Cropp’s decease, his widow, Abigail, died and her death was noted in the parish records of St. Laurence, Pountney Lane at Thames Street. The record also indicates that her burial took place, not at St. Laurence but ‘in ye dutch Church’ on 28th April.\n\nMrs Abigail Cropp Widow died in this parish and was Buried in ye dutch Church April 28 1727\n\nHer burial at the Dutch Church was also recorded among the parish records of St. Peter le Poer:\n\nAbigail Cropp in the Dutch Church April 28th 1727\n\nIn 1724 Abigail Cropp, Widow and Relict of James Crop late of Richmond in the County of Surrey Merchant deceased, wrote her will. In it she states that she wishes to be buried in the Dutch church of St Augustin Fryars with her late dear and loving husband, James. To her son Abraham Cropp she gives one thousand five hundred pounds. She also requests that a further sum of one thousand five hundred pounds be held by her son Abraham, together with Mr. William Houghton of Beames Building in Chancery Lane and her grandson James Henckell, and invested by them on behalf of her daughter Elizabeth Henckell (the now wife of Abraham Henckell) the interest therefrom to be paid by them to Elizabeth for her sole use and benefit and that her Receipt alone shall be sufficient discharge for her trustees.\n\nInterior of the Dutch Church Exterior of the Dutch Church\n\nAbigail gives and devises to her daughter in law Susannah (Banner) Cropp, wife of her son Abraham, the sum of five hundred pounds. To her Henckell grandchildren James, Abraham, Tilman, Isaac and Susannah one hundred pounds a piece. She gives to her brother James Bush Esquire of Red Lion Square in Holborn ten pounds for mourning and also to James’s daughter in law the widow and relict of her nephew Levinus Bush deceased the sum of ten pounds for mourning. And also to Mrs. Judith Bennett (Abigail’s brother’s sister in law) ten pounds. To her cousin Anna Henckell, the widow and relict of Jacob Henckell her goddaughter, one hundred pounds. Also ten pounds for Mourning to Mr. William Houghton and to her cousin Olimpea Houghton his wife (see the appendix on more about the Houghton family).\n\nShe also names her nephews Isaac Henckell, John Shoemaker, and Frederick Shoemaker. She names her cousin Mary Booth wife of _______ Booth and her two daughters Susannah and Mary Booth. Also, her cousin Lucy (?) Pocock (?) of Deale in Kent as well as her cousin Mrs Martha Seabrooke widow one Guinea as well as Martha’s daughter in law Susannah Handy who is Abigail’s god daughter. Another god daughter is named ______ Crop who is the daughter of Manfred Cropp of Amsterdam. Abigail’s two children Abraham Cropp and Elizabeth (Cropp) Henckell receive all her plate, jewels, linen, household goods, furniture, etc. to be shared equally between them. She appoints her son Abraham and her son in law Abraham Henckell as Executors. She signs her will on 11th July, 1724.\n\nA year later Abigail wrote a curious codicil which can be found in the appendix and which leads to a number of genealogical connections.\n\nDuring the second World War the Dutch church was eviscerated by bombs The restored interior of the church today.\n\nSUSANNAH BANNER (1692-1759) AND ABRAHAM CROPP (1675/76-1744)\n\nSusannah, the daughter of John and Susannah (Cradock) Banner, was born in 1692 and baptised at St. Laurence, Pountney Lane as shown below:\n\nSusanna Banner daughter\n\nof John & Susanna\n\nBanner was Baptized\n\nfebruary ye 14 1692\n\nSusannah Banner married Abraham Cropp on 18th March, 1713, at Holy Trinity, The Minories. The same church in which Mary Balchen would marry John Man some thirty years later.\n\nMarch 18th Mr. Abraham Crop Batch and Ms Susanna Banner Spinster, the former of ye Parish of St Bennett Sherehog, ye latter of St Edmonds ye King\n\nBelow Holy Trinity the Minories which was destroyed by bombs during World War Two and not restored.\n\nAbraham, the son of James and Abigail (Bush) Cropp, was born in 1676 and baptized on 7th March, 1675/76 at St. Gabriel, Fenchurch Street.\n\nAbraham Crop the sonne of James Crop and of\n\nAbigail his wife was baptized on and the seventh\n\nday of March 1676\n\nIn the porcelain collection of the Reeves Center at Washington and Lee University in Virginia is the dish or plate shown below. The Cropp arms are on the left side of the shield with the bird, while the Banner arms are on the right with the fleur de lis. The plate may have been painted to commemorate the Banner-Cropp marriage.\n\nAbraham Cropp’s Career\n\nThere are a number of references to Abraham Cropp in the newspapers of the age. For instance, he was one of the commissioners appointed on 21st June, 1711, to manage and direct the ‘One and a half million lottery and the adventure of two millions’.\n\nAbraham is listed as a lottery commissioner below in the left hand column about half way down. The lottery, known at the time as The Classis, was the brain child of Sir John Blunt, Susannah (Banner) Cropp’s step-father. Blunt regarded this lottery as … his masterpiece, and as ushering in a new era of finance not only in England, but also in Western Europe. (See Carswell , p. 44).\n\nA view of a typical 18th century lottery-drawing can be seen below (from the British Museum) showing the interior of the Guildhall, London, where a raised stage has two large lottery wheels on either side of it from which boys from Christ’s Hospital are drawing tickets which are handed to the Commissioners seated at a long table; clerks sit at a table below and in the foreground is a crowd of men, women, and children awaiting results. Portraits of the king and queen hang against the gothic windows above. This is a latter lottery drawing circa 1727 but captures the sort of scene that Abraham Crop may well have partaken in as a lottery commissioner.\n\nList of ‘The Commissioners appointed for managing and directing of the Lottery of One Million and an half, and the Adventure of Two Millions.’ An Eighteenth Century Lottery-Drawing\n\nOn 3rd November, 1718, Abraham placed the following advertisement in The Daily Courant:\n\nWhereas a Bill of 100l. drawn by Mr. Thomas Brearey upon Mr. Abraham Cropp, Merchant, in London, was taken out of a Letter directed to Mr. John Allen, and Company, in Friday-street, London, that was delivered into the Post-Office at Stockport in Cheshire on the 26th of September last; and whereas the said Bill was carried to the said Mr. Cropp’s House for Payment, on Wednesday the 15th of October last: If the Person that carried the said Bill will come to the Post-Master-General, at the Post-Office in Lombard street, and give an Account how he came by it, so as to detect the Person that took it out of the Letter, he shall receive 20 Guineas Reward.\n\nOn 20th January, 1719, the ‘General Court of the Societies of Mines-Royal, Mineral and Battery Works’ appointed Abraham Cropp to the committee managing the ‘Affair of insuring Ships and Merchandize’ by.\n\nOn 24th June, 1720, he was named a director of the Royal Exchange Assurance Company.\n\nFifty years later George Cumberland, Jnr. began working as an office clerk at the Royal Exchange Assurance Company until, at a still quite young age, he inherited a large enough fortune which allowed him to escape the drudgery of clerical work. Not so fortunate was his cousin Henry Man who remained tethered to his secretarial desk at the South Sea House until his early death aged 51 in 1799.\n\nThe Royal Exchange Assurance Company\n\nAbraham was also heavily involved in the South Sea Company although he was not a director. For instance, a meeting of the shareholders and officers of the company was held on 8th September, 1720, and was reported on two days later by The Weekly Journal. In the report, Cropp’s appointment to a committee to examine the company’s bylaws is noted.\n\nThursday there was a General Court of the South Sea Company held at Merchant Taylors Hall, where the Sub Governor acquainted them that the intended Subscription for the Proprietors was laid aside, it being judged more for the Interest of the Company so to be; and that the last Subscription that was taken in was for 1,250,000 l. And he also assur’d them, that there was a perfect Harmony among the Directors; which confutes the malicious Calumny that has been industrially spread concerning their Feuds and Disagreements among themselves. Upon this there appear’d a great Unanimity in the Assembly, which entirely acquiesced in all Things that the Court of Directors have done since the last; a Committee was appointed to inspect the bylaws, viz. Mr. Gumley, Mr. Deputy Skinner, Mr. Alexander Cleeve, Mr. Richard Turner, Mr. Abraham Cropp, and two others. The Duke of Portland, the Lord Carpenter, Mr. Craggs, and Mr. Hungerford, moved for the Thanks of the General Court to be given to the Directors, which was immediately complied with, and then the Lord Orkney moved to adjourn.\n\nThis meeting was significant in the annals of the South Sea Company as it was the last meeting of the shareholders before the bubble burst. The purpose of the meeting was to cover up the cracks that were fast appearing and to try to convince investors that all was well with the company and their money.\n\nAbout this meeting (described above) John Carswell writes:\n\nA General Court of Proprietors of the South Sea Company which now had to be held was organized with the utmost care to preserve an impression of continued confidence. Although the proceedings were not due to begin till midday, the hall was filled at nine in the morning of 8 September with a reliable crowd, so that hostile groups arriving later could not get in. Apart from endorsing the proposed dividend for the next ten years, the main business was a vote of confidence in the directors, which was proposed by Postmaster-General Craggs and seconded in a long speech by the MP John Hungerford, the promoter of the Bubble Act, who assured the meeting that in all his experience he had never known such wonderful results to be produced in so short a time. The universal wealth flowing from the original scheme, he asserted, had washed away all party differences [Whig –v- Tory], and the country was at peace with itself for the first time in a generation. Town, country, and Church had all benefited – ‘not a few of the reverend clergy having got great sums’ and he only hoped the directors had done as well for themselves as they had done for the nation. At this point an interruption by some August annuitants was howled down and a motion that they should be allowed to withdraw from their disastrous bargain defeated. The concluding speech was made by the Duke of Portland, who said he could not understand what reason anyone had to be dissatisfied. This impressed everybody, for the Duke’s holding was known to be large, and much of it had been bought at long prices.\n\nOn 11th June, 1725, Abraham, as an officer of the Company of Copper Mines in the Principality of Wales, was responsible for issuing stock in the company.\n\nIn 1731, Abraham was chosen, along with seven other gentlemen, to audit the accounts of St. Thomas’s Hospital. Abraham’s involvement with the hospital lasted a number of years.\n\nIn 1735 he was nominated Sheriff for the County of Surrey.\n\nIn 1740 Abraham Cropp was appointed by Captain John Balchen (Mary Man and Elizabeth Cumberland’s uncle) as the executor of his will. Balchen died on 26th July, 1742, at Canton while commanding the East Indiaman The Onslow (named after the Speaker of the House of Commons). Note that in the two notices above (1719 and 1720) Lord Onslow appears as Governor of the Societies of the Mines Royal Mineral, etc. and The Royal Exchange Assurance.\n\nIn 1742, Abraham was appointed one of the executors of his mother in law Susannah (Cradock) Blunt’s will.\n\nOn 3rd June, 1743, an advertisement appeared in a newspaper:\n\nLost out of the House of Abraham Crop, Esq; in Fenchurch-Street, (within these four or five Years past) or misplac’d, (while Workmen were employ’d in the House) a square Box, with Parchment Deeds and Writings relating to a Leasehold Estate, (of no Use but to the Owner.) Whoever brings the said Box to the Bar of Garraway’s Coffee-House in Exchange-Alley, shall have Three Guineas Reward, and no Questions ask’d.\n\nThis is the last appearance that Abraham makes in the newspapers. Abraham died in February, 1744, and his burial at the Dutch Church is recorded on the 24th of that month as being ‘In het graf van Mrs Abigail Crop’.\n\nA view down Fenchurch Street with Ironmonger’s Hall on the right\n\nAbraham Cropp’s Will\n\nAbraham Cropp wrote his will on 10th February, 1743, in which he refers to himself as a merchant of Fenchurch Street residing in the parish of St. Gabriel, Fenchurch. He appoints his wife Susannah as the sole executrix of his will.\n\nHe first states that he wishes to be privately buried at the Dutch Church of St. Augustin Fryars ‘in the same grave where my late dear father and mother lye buried at the foot of the Communion Table or as near to them as may be.’ As can be seen from above, his wishes were carried out.\n\nThe first three pages of his twelve-page will are taken up with describing how his marriage settlement had been disposed of over the years.\n\nAbraham names his wife, Susannah and his three children James, Richard, and Sarah, who together receive the bulk of his estate and who are bequeathed handsome amounts of cash as well as income derived from annuities in stocks as well as rents received from various properties. Among the latter are collections ‘of messuages, tenements, hereditaments, copyhold and freehold lands’ located at:\n\n1. Manchester Court and Chancel Row in the parish of St. Margaret’s, Westminster.\n\nWestminster Bridge and Manchester Court on the right\n\n2. A certain court called Foster’s in or on or adjoining Whitecross Street in the parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate.\n\n3. Property in St. George, Hanover Square.\n\n4. Marshlands and hereditaments at Tide or Tyd Saint Mary in Lincolnshire.\n\n5. Likewise property in Lathbury and Bunstye in Buckinghamshire.\n\nHis three residences include two houses at Richmond, one on the Hill and the other on the Green. The latter Abraham purchased from William Pirie, coal merchant and which he had lately entirely rebuilt ; as well as his dwelling house in Fenchurch Street.\n\nThen there are plates, linens, bowls, rings, a coach chariot and coach horses, etc. that are distributed among his legatees. He also names:\n\nHis nephews and nieces being the children of his sister Elizabeth (Cropp) Henckell:\n\nJames Henckell and his son Abraham and Tilman Henckell the brother of James.\n\nThe Balchens: Henry Balchen (my cousin); Mrs. Martha Balchen widow (of Henry’s brother Richard) and her two sons William and James and also to Susan, Elizabeth [Cumberland], Mary [Man], and Ann the four daughters of the said Martha.\n\nInstitutions that benefit include: The Dutch Church in St. Augustin Fryras, St. Thomas’s Hospital, the charity school at Richmond, and the charity school of Lambourn Road for the use of the charity children thereto belonging to Mrs. Sarah Boulter, widow.\n\nMourning rings go to:\n\nRichard Banner Esquire and Mary [Davies] his wife, Maria Theresa Purcell, Mr. Richard Cradock, Matthew Pitts, The Reverend Doctor Richard Banner of Oxford and his wife [Mary Sacheverell].\n\nThe fortunes inherited by Sarah (Cropp) Long and her brother Richard Cropp came in large part from the various properties owned by their father Abraham and grandfather James.\n\nSusannah Cropp and John Man\n\nIn the British Library’s manuscript collection is a series of indentures running from 1729 through to 1753 mostly concerned with the transfer of a piece of land known as Baron’s Yard on Tower Hill and which, over the years, involved John Blunt and his wife Susannah (Cradock), Abraham Cropp and his wife Susannah (Banner), Abraham Cropp’s brother in law Abraham Henckell, and John Man.\n\nBelow are shown some of the signatures of the parties on indentures dated 1729. The first is a receipt for £2,100 received by Sir John Blunt from Abraham Cropp.\n\nReceived the day of the date of the Deed within written by me Sir John Blunt within named of and from the within named Abraham Crop the Sum of Two thousand one hundred pounds Consideration money within mentioned to be by him to me paid Witness my hand —————— John Blunt Witness John Gee Lewis Hansen\n\nAssignment from Sir John Blunt Bart To Messrs . Crop and Henckell, the Six messuages or Tenements North of Tower Hill call’d Baron’s yard. dated 4 Oct. 1729\n\nAssignment from Sir John Blunt Bart to Messrs. Crop and Henckell 4th October, 1729, of The Lease From St Catherin’s Hospitall in Trust for Dame Susan Blunt\n\nSusannah (Cradock) Blunt’s signature\n\nA later indenture dated 8th November, 1753, records an agreement between Susannah (Banner) Cropp and John Man whereby John agrees to lease from Susannah for a thirty year period two newly built brick houses at the north end of Tower Hill in the parish of St. Allhallows, Barking, abutting to the east of certain warehouses occupied by the East India Company and northeast of the house of Joseph Poole wine cooper. This is the same property known as Baron’s yard recorded above in the 1729 indenture.\n\nThe first half of an indenture between Susannah (Banner) Cropp and John Man\n\nAccompanying the indenture, possibly produced by John Man himself, is a plan of the property showing one of the houses as thirty four feet wide. The property runs sixty three feet east to west and fifty feet north to south.\n\nThe location of two houses John Man leased\n\nfrom his cousin Susannah (Banner) Cropp in 1753\n\nJohn Man’s signature on the indenture\n\nhe made with Susannah (Banner) Cropp\n\nSussanah (Banner) Cropp’s signature on the identure she made\n\nwith John Man\n\nA bemused royal lion looks out from the indenture made\n\nbetween John Man and Susannah (Banner) Cropp\n\nSealed and delivered by the within named John Man (being first duly stampt)\n\nin the presence G. Cumberland,[Snr.] and T. Edwards South Sea House\n\nThe Death of Susannah (Banner) Cropp\n\nSusannah (Banner) Cropp died on 17th December, 1759, and was buried on 24th of that month in the chancel at St. Margaret Pattens.\n\nSusannah Crop Widow of Abraham Crop was buried in the chancel 24 Dec 1759\n\nSusannah (Banner) Cropp’s will available from the National Archives online is incomplete consisting of three pages mostly taken up with the terms of her marriage settlement. However, in one short passage she directs that she wishes to be buried in the church of St. Margaret Pattens ‘as near to my five [in fact six] children as may be’. These would be: James, Richard, Abraham, John, John, and Susannah.\n\nThe following transcription of a wall monument in St. Margaret Pattens made in 2011 by an unnamed source indicates that six of her children are indeed buried in the church. The transcription on the right would appear to be from over Susannah’s grave on the chancel floor. A visit to the church itself should confirm this.\n\nTHE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM CROPP AND SUSANNAH BANNER\n\nA"
