He was the son of James Ryther and Elizabeth Atherton.\n\nIn William Atherton's will dated 17 January 1578 in Harewood , Robert Ryther was named as heir. He and Cicely Atherton, John Ryther, Edith Ryther, Mary Ryther, Cotton Tempest, Hellen or Ellen Ryther and Francis Maude were beneficiaries in William Atherton's will proved 19 January 1577/78.\n\nRobert Ryther and William Atherton and John Ryther were mentioned in a court case in February 1581/82 in London . 1581-2: Bill of complaint in the Star Chamber of James Rither of London, Esq. administrator of the goods and chattels of William Atherton of Harewood, gent, deceased, during the nonage of Robert & John Rither, the plaintiff's sons, executors appointed by William Atherton's will. Atherton in his lifetime delivered to Anthony Mawde of Helthwayhill £100 to be safely kept for Atherton's use, and to be paid to him or his assigns on demand, and by his will gave all his goods, etc. not otherwise bequeathed (and therefore including the £100) to the said Robert & John Rither, and made them executors. John has since died, but Robert is alive and still under 21. The plaintiff, as adminstrator, demanded the £100, but Mawde refused to repay it. The plaintiff, about two years ago, complained before the Council of the North at York, when Mawde appeared, and falsely swore that the £100 was a gift. He asked for a supoena against Mawde for perjury. Mawde demurred, on the ground that the cause of complaint arose before the Council of York, and could therefore be best tried there..\n\nHe was not mentioned in the 1585 or 1612 visitations. aet fourteen 1585 - but as Richard?.\n\nHe inherited Harewood from his father James who died in 1596 and sold it to Thomas Wentworth in 1601.\n\nHowever the Rythers & Redmans sold Harewood to the Gascoignes in 1578.

For many centuries after that the properties belonged to the Gascoigne Family. It then\n\npassed to the Wentworth Family through marriage. In 1656, after the execution of Thomas Wentworth, the first Earl of Strafford, his son lost possession of the estate and it came to the Cutler Family. When Sir John Cutler died in 1693, he divided his estate between his daughter, Elizabeth, who was married to the Earl of Radnor, and a relative,\n\nJohn Boulter. Elizabeth died three years later without children and the entire estate was in the hands of John through the mechanism of primogenital inheritance.

Further he has of long time and still does assist Wormall with his counsel and countenance. For Sir Tho. Bland, he was sometimes my father's under-sheriff, for which office, the very foundation of his advancement, he paid no penny nor entered bond to discharge it. Notwithstanding, my father dying shortly after, he left me utterly alone to go through with the account to my extreme trouble and loss. At this instant he pretends to sue me for certain old nomine penees (fn. 1) alleged to be due out of land that I had lately bought, albeit he have received all the annuities due.

In May 1660, there was again violent confrontation between commoners and Reading over the distraint of goods for tax arrears. Once again, Belton men led the attacks. Robert Ryther, esquire, had been involved in actions in the 1650s. His father, also Robert, was not a native of the manor, but had inherited his Belton estates from his mother, daughter and heiress of Mr. Thomas Browne. Another participant in these 1660 actions was George Gilby, who later married Ryther's sister, Belton yeoman and grocer and receiver of half the tithe income of Belton parish when he died in 1686. As in earlier confrontations, the commoners were supported by local officials. Thomas Wakefield, Belton constable, refused to act against them, and Michael Monkton, by now in trouble as a Quaker, was said to have declared the commoners' actions to have been lawful and justifiable. He was appointed Robert Medley's guardian in 1662.\n\nIn June 1663, Robert Ryther, Thomas Vavasour and John Bernard submitted a petition to the Lords on behalf of 'above a thousand householders & tenants and Inhabitants within the Mannour of Epworth', in which they claimed that 'some of them have been put to neare 300£ charges'.\n\nIn August 1668, an alliance between a large contingent of men from Hatfield, four Belton men and three men from Epworth in an attack against Reading's house at Sandtoft.

It appears that the Commoners managed to keep possession of the disputed ground until 1681, when Nathaniel Reading obtained a writ of assistance from the Court of Exchequer, on the ground that Mr Ryther, of Belton, had threatened to pull down his house and the houses of several other Participants....\n\nIn 1681, Reading directed his attention again to the manor of Epworth. In obtaining a writ of assistance from the Exchequer to protect his house at Sandtoft against the commoners, he extended the writ to cover the 7400 acres of commons granted to the Participants by the decree of 1636. The following year the sheriff's men drove the commoners' cattle from the grounds to allow Reading to enclose, with predictable results. Fences were pulled down and cattle turned into the lands, and Robert Ryther appeared before the Exchequer in January 1683 to answer for his part in the action. Court action in the Exchequer continued in defence of the commoners' title, with the commoners denying the legitimacy of the 1636 decree. A common purse was again organised to pay the legal costs, including payments to the man now acting as their solicitor, John Pinder, gentleman, of Kinnall Ferry in Owston parish. Robert Ryther said in January 1683 that £25 had recently been paid by the inhabitants of Belton to John Pinder 'for and towards the Defrayinge the Chardges about ye Suites for ye said Lands'.\n\nThe Rt. Honble. John Earl of Mulgrave, the Honble, George Lord Carterett, Baron of Hawne, Lord of the Manor of Epworth, in the Isle of Axholme, in the county of Lincoln (an infant), by the Right Hon.

Robert was steward to the Manor from 1684 to 1693, Epworth, Lincolnshire .\n\nReading, meanwhile, continued to distrain the commoners' livestock, leading to indictments against him for impounding cattle and horses in the commons of Haxey, Epworth and Belton. Commoners retaliated by taking Reading's horses and harvested oats, and in May 1686 Robert Ryther led an action to fill in his ditches. The following year horses and cattle of Reading's tenants were impounded at Belton, and Robert Ryther led two attacks on Reading's house, the second involving an assault on his wife, daughters and servants. John Pinder was one of those cited as taking part. Two years earlier Reading's wife Sarah had, in company with two other Sandtoft women, thrown stones at some of the commoners and set dogs on them. The two attacks on Reading's house included a number of women, some with their husbands. Women had not taken part in earlier attacks against houses and families, but Reading and his family were, not surprisingly, an exception. Robert Ryther and nine gentlemen from Belton, Epworth and Owston, including John Pinder, were accused of masterminding the attacks and raising funds. Ryther and Edmund Mawe, now chief constable of Epworth, had themselves taken part in actions in the 1660s, and most of the other men can be identified as the sons, cousins or brothers-in-law of earlier activists.

Representatives for the commoners were chosen at a meeting in Owston, attended by 'many of the principal commoners from all parts of the mannor', according to John Laughton, maltster of Epworth, who was present. This witness and several others later claimed that these representatives were expressly instructed not to enter into any agreement. The representatives: John Pinder, gentleman, of Owston, acting as the commoners' solicitor; Robert Ryther, esquire, of Belton; and John Maw and Robert Coggan, gentlemen of Epworth, 'and others', travelled to London with instructions to 'proceed to hearing the Cause'. In London these men agreed to a settlement in which the 7400 acres were divided into 3868 acres for the commoners of Epworth manor, 664 acres for Misterton commoners and 2868 acres for the Participants, who were to retain responsibility for maintaining the drainage and safeguard the commoners against any claims that might be made by Nathaniel Reading. The agreement resulted in an Exchequer decree on 14 May 1691.\n\nAs in the 1630s, a decree based on a settlement agreed to by some of the leaders of the commoners was discredited and rejected by large numbers of commoners and other leaders. As in the earlier period, there were accusations of bribery, treachery and self-serving persuasion against some of those who had agreed to the settlement. Upon the return of the representatives from London, it was apparently made clear to them that large numbers of commoners were opposed to the terms agreed. John Maw promptly recanted, accusing Ryther, Coggan and Pinder of having accepted bribes, and was claimed to have said that, although he 'was there and consenting or did not Obstruct the same it was merely thro ye said Mr Pinders perswations and ag't his own Inclinations and Judgm't'. Robert Ryther was reported to have been offered 100 acres out of the Participants' allotment, and over twenty years later his former servant and tenant claimed to have heard Ryther admit to it. Ryther was also accused of revealing the commoners' secrets to their opponents. Robert Coggan was to receive 50 acres, and John Vause, Epworth yeoman, said that 'to Confirm ye said report and to Induce this Depon't to believe ye same, He very well remembers That ye said Mr Coggan Did begin to Inclose his said ffifty Acres which is ever Since called Coggan's peice'. John Pinder was said to have been offered 1000 guineas.\n\nThe men accused of signing their neighbours' names to an agreement in 1636, Hezekiah Browne and William Torksey, had been prominent leaders in direct actions against the drainers. In 1691, of the men accused of taking bribes, John Pinder, Robert Ryther and John Mawe had been among those said to have masterminded attacks on Sandtoft and the level, and Robert Ryther had a long history of leading actions against the settlers. These representatives who entered into the agreement on the commoners' behalf in 1691 were now discredited and ceased to act for them.\n\nThose commoners who rejected the agreement, and who had rejected one set of leaders, were able to find alternatives. Three Belton gentlemen, Richard Taylor, Robert Popplewell and Richard Kinman, 'and several other Commoners' brought a Bill in the Exchequer court against Pinder, Ryther, Coggan and Mawe 'for a Discovery of their Irregular and fraudulent proceedings', but failed to get the decree reversed. Richard Kinman had been involved in actions in the 1660s, his brother had led actions in the 1680s, and his father William had earlier been an activist. Richard Kinman was a cousin of Robert Popplewell, and Robert Popplewell was a second cousin of Richard Taylor. Robert Popplewell was married to Robert Ryther's daughter Katherine, and both husband and wife were to become leaders in subsequent actions.\n\n. In this court action, the commoners employed Mr. Edmund Whitehead 'of Furnival Inn, London' to act for them, but later used Robert Popplewell, who was serving as steward of the manor in 1694. Popplewell acted as the commoners' solicitor until his death, shortly before the final settlement in 1719. Another man prevailed upon to aid the discontented commoners was Mr.Thomas Mawe, probably the Epworth gentleman of that name listed among the ringleaders in 1687. According to Richard Massey, chapman of Epworth, the commoners approached Thomas Mawe, who brought a suit against the Epworth representative Robert Coggan for starting to enclose his 50 acres, whereupon Coggan desisted. Robert Bird, Epworth husbandman, said he had heard 'Mr Thomas Maw and some other Comoners complaine of ye Manner of obtaineing it [decree], to the said Mr Ryther, Mr Pinder and Mr Coggan and Asked them by what Authority they consented to it'.\n\nRobert Ryther, esquire, another of the commoner's representatives, had one surviving son in 1691. This son, Robert, served as deputy steward of the manor, 'Councillor-at-Law', and Deputy Recorder of Lincoln before his death in 1696. Robert Ryther, too might well have been suspected of greater concern for his son's ambitions, both within and outside the manor, than for the commoners' cause..\n\n10 October 1691 re property to the east of the 2 acre close, Manor of Epworth, Lord Carterett, Baron of Hawnes, Steward Robert Ryther Esq.

He was summoned to meet the King at Battlebridge cum equis et armis, in 1312; and to a council of defence against the Scots by Archbishop Greenfield in 1315. He joined the Earl of Lancaster in revolt, and was taken prisoner.\n\nOn Dec 16 1318 he was called upon to raise and arm all his men able-bodied tenants. Soon after the battle at Myton against the Scots, he was ordered to assemble is men and lead them to York. Constant warfare impoverished the family patrimony. He had, moreover, been mulcted in the heavy fine of 400 marks for joining in the Lancaster conspiracy against the King. After the execution of the Earl in 1322 he was released from prison and the fine paid.\n\nRobert Ryther married Maud Unknown (Ryther) before 1315.\n\nHe was Lord of Ryther in 1316.
