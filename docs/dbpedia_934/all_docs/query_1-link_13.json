Ambrose BERTIE\n\nParegrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby of Eresby\n\nBy Robert Peake the Elder\n\nThe Weiss Gallery, London\n\nSon of Catherine Willoughby, Duchess of Suffolk and Baroness Willoughby dEresby in her own right, and Richard Bertie, the Duchesss gentleman usher (or steward) whom she married after the death of her first husband, Charles Brandon. Born on 12 Oct 1555, he was baptized at the church of Saint Willibrord in Wesel on 14 Oct. On Elizabeth I's accession to the throne in 1558, his parents returned to England and applied for a patent of naturalization for him. He formally became English on 2 Aug 1559.\n\nSusan and Peregrine Bertie were educated at Grimsthorpe with ten children of honor (nine boys and one other girl). They were tutored by Miles Coverdale, who had translated the Bible into English. They also became friends of Mary Grey since their mother was one of her jailers.\n\nHe married Mary de Vere, daughter of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, between Christmas 1577 and 12 Mar 1578. When his mother died in 1580, he succeeded to her barony and he took his seat in the House of Lords on 16 Jan 1580.\n\nIn 1582, he was commissioned to escort the Duke of Anjou from Canterbury to Antwerp. The French royal Duke had arrived as a suitor of the un-married Elizabeth. In the same year he was sent to Denmark to invest Frederick II with the Order of the Garter. Lord Willoughby de Eresby arrived at Elsinore on 22 Jul and left on 27 Sep 1582. His ulterior purpose was to obtain an understanding whereby English merchant ships would not be molested while in Danish waters. In 1585, he returned to Denmark on behalf of Elizabeth in support of Henry III of Navarre and to obtain Danish help for England's efforts on behalf of the independent Netherlands."
