        "text": "The English landscape in art, as in real life, is contentious, open to interpretations, with the term Picturesque being a visual recycling and improving of the landscape for consumption by various audiences. Ironically a term prevalent in late 18th century Britain as a mediator between Burke’s ideas of the sublime and beautiful, it depended on the roughness and ruin of a certain pictorial view inducing a sentimental and nostalgic response in the viewer of the painted and graphic representation. I use a photo-real style of painting as an attempt to avoid certain manners in painting that tend to deflect aesthetically from perhaps unpalatable truths about situations behind the image and subject matter: the paintings are rooted in the day to day exigencies and tussle of painting. In his essay for the 1983 Arts Council exhibition Landscape in Britain 1850 – 1950 Ian Jeffrey points out that painters, watercolourists and etchers were more upholders of tradition, worried about not losing their audience and buyers, by holding back from ‘satire and parody and pandemonium’ whilst writers of the times did not. Ruskin uses the phrase ‘heartless’ picturesque, of making a virtue of the observation of poor or low subject matter which ‘adds questions concerning the truth of imitation that are at the heart of the Western tradition’. This may be more about taste and sensibility of the observer and social and political predilections of the times, of the required response of sentimentality and nostalgia for the ruined and lost in the face of improvement. The Tate Britain exhibition a couple of years ago, British Landscape: Photography After the Picturesque presented a counterpoint to its Romantic exhibition at the time, a Post-Picturesque as Nicholas Alfrey put it. This may be recognition of the content on display; the signs of economic tension and decline, the ubiquitous use of the mundane landscape as subject matter, or perhaps a disinterested academic fixation on so called ‘non spaces’. My picturesque destabilises through ‘surprise and humour, friction rather than rapprochement’ (Robert Smithson 1973) by conflations of site specific views and their actualities, contradiction of tradition with progress. Modernity, loss and change is expressed through the playful ‘bubbleworlds’ of miniature diorama (why go hunting for views when I can make my own). These ‘landscapes’ are then painted in a Photoreal manner. This may smack of the Ruskinian ‘heartless’ picturesque, but I would argue that the Picturesque is, and has always been, more about the dialectical nature of landscape , my paintings continue and expand this discussion through visual language. I refer to Robert Smithson’s essay Frederick Law Olmsted and the Dialectical Landscape in Artforum 11, Feb1973, cited in Robert Smithson and the Anglo-American Picturesque Martin, Timothy D 2011, also Cosgrove, Denis Modernity, Community and the Landscape Idea UCLA.\n\nAbstract The parliamentary enclosure movement in England in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century marked the final transformation from feudalism to capitalism in the English countryside. This dissertation looks how enclosure and the capitalist revolution in agriculture were represented in the poetry and painting of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century and asks why much of the poetry and art appeared to ignore the profound social and economic changes taking place in this period. For the most part, poets and painters in this period depicted the English countryside as picturesque, rural life as idyllic, and rural labourers as happy and contented. Yet, as this dissertation will show, there were challenges to this viewpoint, poets and painters who resisted the ideology of improvement, enclosure, and capitalist ethos of the agrarian revolution. The dissertation looks at these dissenting poets and painters and focusses in particular on the poetry of John Clare, the most important and cogent anti-enclosure poet of the period. It explores the correlation between Clare’s poetry and contemporary landscape paintings by Peter DeWint, William Turner of Oxford, John Crome, John Linnell, and J.M.W. Turner. The dissertation will strive to show how and why these poets and painters challenged the prevailing ideology of landscape and, it is hoped, will contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of enclosure and the agrarian revolution as seen through the eyes of contemporary poets and painters."
