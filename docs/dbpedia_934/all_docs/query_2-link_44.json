        "text": "The original source for Hamlet is a 13th century text Amlethus which appeared in Gesta Danorum (Deeds of the Danes) by Saxo Grammaticus. Several Latin versions were printed in the 16th century and it was later translated into Italian by Matteo Bandello with a French translation by François de Belleforest published in 1570 who extended the text to twice the length of the original and introduced several elements that are found in the later Hamlet of 1602.\n\nAn earlier version of the play, known as Ur-Hamlet, is thought to have been performed in the late 1580’s based on a comment by Thomas Nashe in his introduction to Robert Greene’s Menaphon (1589),\n\n‘English Seneca read by candle light yields many good sentences, as Blood is a beggar, and so forth; and if you entreat him fair on a frosty morning, he will afford you whole Hamlets, I should say handfuls of tragical speeches’.\n\nThis mention of Hamlet, in the context of ‘tragical speeches’ immediately excites comparisons to the later play and the phrase ‘entreat him fair on a frosty morning’ appears to refer to the opening scene of the play and the appearance of the ghost of Hamlet’s father.\n\nA play called Der bestrafte Brudermord oder: Prinz Hamlet aus Dännemark was performed at the official opening of Kronborg castle on Sunday, 13thJune, 1585, and it is this play which provides us with the lost Ur-Hamlet.\n\nIn 1582 the Duke of Anjou and Alençon had been in England soliciting for the queen’s hand and Peregrine Bertie was commissioned to escort the ‘little frog’ from Canterbury to Antwerp and in the summer months, when the crossing was easiest, he was sent to Denmark to invest Frederick II with the Order of the Garter. The Dane was a cultured but extravagant man, patron to the Astronomer, Tycho Brahe, but his love of alcohol would lead him to an early grave before the end of the decade. Arriving at Elsinore Castle on 22nd July, Peregrine was sumptuously entertained, all the while pressing his secret purpose to obtain an agreement protecting English merchant ships from being molested while in Danish waters, and, after several weeks of toasting and dancing, Bertie finally departed for England on 27th September.\n\nThe original play is now lost but the text survives in a single copy of 1710 which was first published in the periodical Olla Potrida in Berlin in 1781. The play was written in German by an anonymous author – apparently an Englishman as many English words are substituted for the German (eg. Castel instead of Schloss) and many Latin loan words are used that were not normally used in German.\n\nCarl Nordling has pointed out several unique elements that make Prinz Hamlet undoubtedly the pre-cursor to our English Hamlet, and we do know that two of William Shakespeare’s ‘Ffellowes’ were among the company that performed at Elsinore that summer, and both were listed in First Folio among the other players who had performed in Shakespeare’s plays.\n\nThe unknown author was familiar with Danish constitutional law and the political situation circa 1583-6; Nordling highlights references to the Danish succession and a rebellion that was brewing in April, 1585. Some scholars have attempted to date the play later, to 1589, based on a line spoken by Hamlet ‘just send me off to Portugal, that I may never come back again,’ which is thought to be a reference to the disastrous English mission to Portugal in 1589, but as Nordling points out ‘the actual event behind these allusions is probably the death in 1578 of the English Captain Stucley when on duty in Portugal. The same allusion appears in an English play from about 1585, The First Part of Jeronimo and George Peele’s The Battle of Alcázar of 1590 also deals with this incident. Nordling notices that the plays prelude, which is based on the Senecan model, was a feature of some English dramas of the time, but did not appear in any contemporary German plays.\n\nThe dumb show (play-within-a-play) in Prinz Hamlet depicts a King murdered by poison, a feature also found in the first English tragedy Gorboduc written by Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville, Earl of Dorset, circa. 1561. It is possible that this Hamlet was written by Thomas Kyd, who had worked as secretary to the Earl of Sussex, or it may have been penned by Peregrine Bertie himself. The existence of this Hamlet in 1585 takes away much of William Shakespeare’s connection to the play. Carl Nordling notes that when the King tells Hamlet ‘We have determined to send you to England….so that you may cool down there somewhat, since the air is wholesomer, and may aid your recovery better than here’ this is a very English sentiment, and was not the continental opinion of English weather! Nordling concludes ‘So many allusions to English circumstances and such tangible influences from English usage cannot be pure coincidence. We are forced to assume that Prinz Hamlet was written in German by an Englishman.’\n\nThe German play contains two striking similarities to the first and second quartos of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, in Q 1 we find the queen’s advisor is called Corambus, as he is in the German play, but he later becomes Polonius, and in Q 2 we have a second friend besides Horatio, who is called Francisco, who also appears in Prinz Hamlet and shares some of the dialogue later divided between Hamlet and Horatio. These two minor, but marked, differences are enough to conclusively prove the debt owed to Prinz Hamlet by the later Hamlet. Polonius is a caricature of Lord Burghley which is confirmed even in the German version, as Corambus appears to be a derivation from the Latin cor ambis meaning ‘double-hearted’, which seems to be taking a swipe at Lord Burghley’s own motto Cor unum, via una (one heart, one way). There are several differences between the two plays; the death of Ophelia has none of the poetry of the later version as she falls from a hill rather than drowning and the play lacks the famous gravedigger scene and the multiple deaths at the end – scenes which reflect on the events surrounding Mary, Queen of Scots death and the destruction of the Tudor line which allowed James VI accession to the English throne.\n\nThe Earl of Leicester’s attempts to woo Elizabeth and prove himself a worthy suitor gained some impetus when the queen appointed him commander of the English troops in the Netherlands in 1585, finally allowing her favourite and boon companion to prove his mettle at the head of an army. Elizabeth was in an awkward position, she had been offered sovereignty over the Dutch States if she provided them with protection against the Spanish, but this would lead to immediate war, a war she could ill-afford with continued trouble in Ireland, Scotland, as well as her support for Navarre all taxing her coffers. But the ‘grievous cruelty’ of the Spaniards could not be ignored. When the Duke of Parma took Antwerp – thereby destroying England’s cloth trade – she promised the States General that she would provide 5000 foot and 1000 horse, under a General of notable character. Elizabeth’s decision to protect the Netherlands led the King of Sweden to say that she ‘had now taken the Diadem from her head, and set it upon the doubtful chance of war’.\n\nLeicester’s Men ceased touring in 1583 and it appears that the Earl’s patronage had shifted, as his household accounts only record payments to The Queen’s Men, a new troupe created for the queen by her Master of the Revels, Edmund Tilney. With his military success a foregone conclusion, Leicester set about enamoring his queen with a lavish gala week of parties, pageants, and plays held at Oxford, but Leicester was about to commit a grievous error of judgement by accepting the governance of the Dutch States, contrary to his express instructions from his queen.\n\nPeregrine Bertie returned to Elsinore in the summer of 1585 on a mission to press the Danish King to aid Elizabeth and Henry of Navarre against the Spanish in the Low Countries. Peregrine wrote to Sir Francis Walsingham to complain about the cost of his embassy and begged for money to relieve his situation. After several weeks of badgering the Danish King, Bertie managed to convince Frederick to provide 2,000 horse to aid the English forces and to write a letter to Philip II asking him to retreat from the Low Countries. After ten weeks of hard negotiations, Peregrine set sail for England, by way of Hamburg, Emden and Amsterdam.\n\nUpon the removal of the Earl of Leicester he was made General of the English forces in the United Provinces following the Battle of Zutphen, taking command of the army when Leicester was recalled by his irate monarch. Peregrine commanded well, winning respect for his actions in Flanders prior to the Armada, and the following year he went at the head of an auxiliary army to assist Henry of Navarre and the French Huguenots. He might have risen high as a courtier, but was wont to say that he ‘was none of the reptilia’; he therefore preferred a life of retirement.\n\nIt has also been suggested by Carl Nordling that the two female parts mentioned by Charles, the leader of the actors, could have been played by the King’s two daughters, Elizabeth and Anna. It is this Danish princess who would later marry James VI at a ceremony in Oslo on 23rd November 1589. During the couple’s nuptial celebrations James made four ‘negroes’ dance naked in the snow before the Royal carriage and the watching crowds, all of whom died within a few days from the cold. The couple stayed at Kronborg Castle in Elsinore before returning to Scotland in June 1590 and Anna would become Queen of England in 1603. Two of the male parts may have been acted by noble boys attending the Court, such as Frederik Rosenkrantz (1571-1602) and Knud Gyldenstierne (1575-1627) who both journeyed to England in 1592. It was under the patronage of Frederick II that Tycho Brahe undertook his observations of the stars that led to his discovery of Supernova 1572A (named after the year of its discovery) and his detailed observations of the Great Comet in 1577. This appears to be mentioned in the first act of Hamlet:\n\nLast night of all,\n\nWhen yond same star that’s westward from the pole\n\nHad made his course to illume that part of heaven\n\nWhere now it burns\n\nAnd later in the same scene Horatio says:\n\nAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\n\nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star\n\nUpon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands\n\nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:\n\nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events,\n\nAs harbingers preceding still the fates\n\nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\n\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated\n\nUnto our climatures and countrymen.\n\nThe comic actor William Kempe was a member of the newly augmented Leicester’s Men who accompanied the earl on his mission in the Low Countries. Kempe and his fellow actors arrived at Dunkirk on 15th November, while Leicester landed at Flushing on 10th December. As he made his progress to Utrecht, the actors heralded him with lavish pageants praising their noble lord and master, and here they performed The Forces of Hercules on 23rd April, ‘which gave great delight to the strangers’ and they then traveled on to Leiden and The Hague. The company of fifteen included Robert Browne, from Worcester’s Men and Robert Wilson who had left The Queen’s Men to join Leicester’s Men in the Netherlands, but despite these additions to his acting roster, the remainder of Leicester’s Men still continued to tour in England in his absence.\n\nSir Philip Sidney had sent letters home by ‘Will, my Lord of Lester’s jesting player’, sometimes thought to have been William Shakespeare, now proven to have been Kempe, who returned to England with Sidney’s letters (which he delivered to the wrong person!).\n\nKing Frederick’s love of English plays continued the following year when seven English actors performed at Elsinore, in August of 1586 Will Kempe and his lad ‘Daniel Johns’, accompanied by the fellow actors Leicester had recommended to Frederich II, Thomas Stephens, Thomas King, Robert Percy, George Bryan and Thomas Pope,[1] went on an embassy to the Castle of Elsinore.\n\nThomas Heywood, in An Apology for Actors (1612) reports, ‘at the entertainment of Cardinal Alphonsus and the Infanta of Spain into the Low Countries, they were presented at Antwerp, with sundry pageants and plays: the King of Denmark, father to him that now reigns, entertained into his service, a company of English Comedians, commended unto him by the Earl of Leicester.’"
