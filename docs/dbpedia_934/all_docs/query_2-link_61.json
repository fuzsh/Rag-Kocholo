        "text": "e Peregrine Smith Controversy\n\nWhen I started tracing my Mother's side of the family she told me a story that had been passed\n\ndown to her.We were descended fromCapt. John Smith and Pocahontas.Indeed I found a Capt. John Smith, but he lived in the 1830's, not 1607.On my Dad's side I found alot of people saying we were descended from John Smith and Pocahontas.I didn't see any identified sources, no documents, records, or books to substantiate this claim, so I decided to try and find some.When I googled Peregrine Smith the only reference I found was in connection to him being from Hiett-Smith descendents saying that Peregrine was the father of their ancestor and mine, William Smith, with no sources noted.Here's what I found:\n\nCapt. John Smith:\n\nBaptized at St. Helens Church 9 Jan 1580.Son of George Smith and Alice Rickard.\n\nHis family were poor tenants who lived on land owned by Peregrine Bertie, the 13th Baron\n\nBaron Willoughby de Eresby.After Smith's father died his mother remarried and Peregrine\n\nBertie looked after young Smith.Bertie later hired him as an attendant (clerk) to Bertie on a\n\ntrip to France.Being bored after a year or so Smith was sent back to Lincolnshire.Being\n\nadventurous, Smith then spent several years traveling, engaging in battles, etc. before going\n\nto Jamestown, VA inJune 1607.He returned to England4 Oct 1609.After more adventures to New England he was in London where he died in 1631.\n\nPocahontas:\n\nBorn in a village about 16 miles from Jamestown in ca. 1595 to Chief of the Powatans.She\n\nwas about 10 or 11 when Smith arrived, 12 or 13 when he left.She was in 1608-1609 a\n\nwelcome guest to the English settlers, bringing food from her father.In 1613 she was taken\n\nand held for ransom.In 1614 she married a commoner, John Rolfe, a tobacco farmer.They had a son, Thomas and in 1618 and they left for England.She died on the return trip to Jamestown 21 Mar 1617.Rolfe went back to Jamestown without Thomas who returned many years later to receive his inheritance of thousands of acres from his grandfather.\n\nPeregrine Smith:\n\nBorn in Jamestown in 1608.Son of John Smith and Pocahontas.There are no death records, no records of marriage or children, no records of where he lived in England.Some suggest that he married Mary Bertie in 1640.\n\nLady Mary Bertie:\n\nBorn in Lincolnshire in 1615 to Robert Bertie, the second son of Peregrine Bertie, (Smith's landlord).She married Dr. John Hewitt in 1640.He was a Catholic priest and chaplain to Bertie, the Earl of Lindsay.He was loyal to Charles II and lost his head on Tower Hill, London in May 1658.She secondly married Sir Abaraham Shipman, Governor of Chester.Since she was from a very aristocratic family there are records toprove these marriages, which make it impossible that she married Peregrine Smith.\n\nJohn Hiett:\n\nBorn 27 April 1676 in Butleigh, Somerset, England.He married Mary Smith, daughter of William Smith (this we know from his will of 1706 in Maryland).The Street Parish Records show that John Hiett and William Smith were on the list of Overseers of the Poor, Butleigh Court from 1681-1699 when thay both disappear from the records.One record lists John Hiett, late of Butleigh and now in Pennsylania (where the Hiett and Smith families show up in the early 1700 records) and also prove there is no German connection to Jost Hite, and that the Hietts were in Somerset, England for many years before leaving for America, so they weren't in Ireland and son George was not born there.Wm. Smith had a certificate from Glastonbury, Somerset ( 4 miles from Butleigh) to Philadelphia 14 Jun 1699.We don't know the dates of Mary or William's birth as the Vicar of Butleigh didn't keep any records of bmd's for the that time period.Also on the Overseers list are Smiths George, John, Abell, and Thomas.Could they have been brothers, sons, or a father?Only George Smith shows up after 1700.\n\nQuestions about Peregrine Smith:\n\nPocahontas would have been about 13 when he was born,that's possible, but what happened to him after that?No records to show that she tookhim to England when he would have been 8 in 1616.He supposedly married Lady Mary Bertie...records show that can't be correct.Peregrine is not listed in any British records or in any of the oral traditions passed down from her tribe.He was never mentioned in any of John Smith's books about Virginia or in his will.Neither John nor Thomas Rolfe mention him.I have found no records at all to show that he ever existed.Many of the historians of Smith and Pocahontas don't believe there even was a romantic relationship between them, she thought of him more as a father figure.When she saw him again in England she called him Father.She was 11 and he was 27 when they first met.In the\" Full Text of Capt. John Smith\" it is suggested that he wasn't all that interested in women, that's possible, since he remained a bachelor all his life.\n\nThe Smith-Pocahontas contoversy remains a subject for further analysis.There are many versions with many different outcomes but there are none that I found that include Peregrine Smith in them.Therefore, until someone can find any records to verify that he did exist I have think that this story is a myth (every family has at least one), not o mention that probably most families have a John Smith in them.It is most likely the most common name in the US.So, I can't say that he was the father of my ancestor William Smith.From what I've seen of the DNA results from my branch of the Hiatt family there appears to be no Indian DNA found.I guess the only way to prove it would be a DNA link between Thomas Rolfe's descendants and William Smith or John Hiett's descendants.\n\nI did find another interesting story (with records)that may have helped to contribute to or confuse the Smith and Pocahontas legend if you have Hiatt and West ancestors.My ancestors of the Jamestown era are Raleigh Croshaw, George Percy, Thomas West, and John West.Col. John West was married to Ursula (Unity) Croshaw in 1654.She was the daughter of Raleigh Croshaw.John and Unity had several children, thenJohn committed udultery by living with and having children with Cockacoeske, the Indian Pamunkey Queen (who was related to Pocahontas).They even had a son named John West.He wouldn't be in our Hiatt bloodline because we are from the children he had with Unity Croshaw.\n\nPlease reply if you find any evidence that I missed about Peregrine Smith.There is a huge amount of information out there.I would really like to know who was the father of William Smith.\n\nSources:\n\n1.butleigh. orgunder Butleigh People for Hiett, Smith\n\n2.en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bertie,_Richard_(DNB00)Info on Richard Bertie\n\n3.zipworld.com.au/~nbdds/home/smythwinchester.htmInfo on Peregrine Bertie, John Smith,\n\nand Pocahontas.\n\n4.rotherhamweb.co.uk/h/jhewett.htmAbout Dr. John Hewitt\n\n5.archive.org/stream/captainjohnsmith00braduoft/captainjohnsmith00braduoft_d\n\nFull Text of Capt.
