        "text": "One thing always surprised me, there were very few accidents on the line. The only one I remember was when \"Auntie Minnie\" was knocked over by the train-he wasn't even hurt-why? Because he was drunk as a cool. Dada said that if he had been sober, he would have been killed, he rolled with the train.\n\nJohnny Hoskins, who had a cobblers shop, next door to The Antelope, took great delight in telling Dada, your kids were on the line again. How he thought we were going to get across otherwise I'll never know, but when Mr Frank Dunkin was the driver he would always slow down and wave to us. Even though we had moved out of the area, anything exciting, we were there, after any carnival they had dancing on the green by floodlight. They had competitions and I think it was Winnie and Ethel entered the waltz for the under 16s and, believe it or not, they won first prize - a bar of chocolate between them!! It was as if they had won the cup. In those days they always had an annual regatta and yachts came from everywhere to enter the race. In those days the Bristol Chanel Yacht Club was the place - very upper class, they also had water sports-swimming - a greasy pole and sandcastles, grotto's etc. Who nearly always won the grotto competition? Edna - no wonder- she had five slaves fetching and carrying for her sand, seaweed, coloured pebbles, and thousands of oyster shells. She always gave them titles and think it was her perfect writing that gave her the prize (what it was I don't know) Edna says it was money. As time went by, we stopped going back and made the Castle Field our playground - and by this time Mama had got herself a few cleaning jobs so looking after the four little ones fell on us. I always said we were brought up on stale cakes (Mama cleaned Whites -then the cake shop) and rotten fruit (she also cleaned Davies the fruiterer).\n\nI think we had now left our old life in Village Lane and started a new one in Walters Crescent which was a street consisting of 10 houses branching off Newton Road (or Castleton as we knew it). At the end of the Crescent was the Pines End of Varleys the chemist. didn't know this but Edna said that where Varleys is now there used to be a bank (I don't remember this) and when the bank closed down, Mr Varley took over the whole premises. Today you can see the division in the middle of the chemist where the bank and the chemist met.\n\nThe chemist was owned by Mr Edwin Varley - a very religious Plymouth Brethren his wife was Norwegian and was a sister to Mr Werner Sivertsen's father a local Councillor, who later on became Lord Mayor of Swansea. Mr and Mrs Varley had four children, Irene, a pharmacist, who helped run the pharmacy, Sybil, who ran the house, and then the twins Edna and John. Next door to the chemist shop there was some vacant land, Mr Varley bought this and built a chapel of his own there (Plymouth Brethren) still well supported to this day. As children we went to Sunday School there (they had the best summer outings always to Pennard) and to Wednesday evening Band of Hope (best magic lanterns).\n\nWhen war was declared John Varley joined the RAF much to his father's disgust, went to Canada to train and came back as a Flying Officer (it caused quite a rift in the family) particularly as he brought a WRAF home as his wife!!\n\nBack to the Crescent in No. 1 lived Mr and Mrs Isaac. They seemed quite old when we arrived there (they were probably around 50). They had one daughter Doreen, who when she got married, moved up to Castle Street. I can also remember a brother and sister spending quite a lot of time at No. 1. \"I don't know whether they were relations or were fostered. Bert and Eve Moore they were a lot older than us. Bert was a leading scout master and had thousands of badges sewn on his shirt. We now move next door to No.2, Mr and Mrs Meach, Idris, John and Elizabeth. I can't remember which school they went to, but do remember that Idris was an errand boy for Greenslades the grocer things turned out very sadly for them. I can't remember what date it happened, probably the late 1930s, there was an outbreak of Polio, all the schools were closed down, and I can remember the medical officer for health checking on all the visits Idris had made during his deliveries. Unfortunately, Idris died. I can remember quite a few of the children who had polio, but luckily got over it. Dada made us go up the Castle Field to play and insisted that we kept to ourselves and not to play with anyone else and when we got home, he made us all take a dose of snuff - it's a wonder we didn't all become addict.\n\nNext door to the Meaches lived Mrs Cobey Thomas with her boyfriend (partner toy boy who knows!)? She was a very eccentric lady and was still living in the 1920s flapper style, long cigarette holder etc. Her boyfriend about 20 years younger than her was a jobbing gardener - what a change!!!\n\nNext door to them at No. 4, another Mr and Mrs Harris, with one daughter Beryl. I can't remember too much about them. I think they moved on. Whether the Hoskins family moved in there don't know. There was Mr and Mrs Hoskins, Doreen the same age as me and Olive the same age as Winnie. Another thing Edna told me that she always got tied up with Johnny Hoskins and the Railway line. Johnny used to sit in the shelter at the end of the part with all the old fishermen, and one day as she was crossing the line to go to the beach, she caught her foot in the line and fell over. One of the old fishermen came across to pick her up and said \"ne'er thee mind maid thee hasn't hurt theeself now get on with thee\" old Mumbles dialect (according to Edna) thee and thou, not you and me.\n\nWe now come to No. 5, Mrs Madeley, one son Ted, one daughter Marjorie Ted worked for the Parks Department looking after the bowling green etc and I think that Marjorie worked down The Osborne, they too were quite a bit older than us. I never heard any mention of Mr Madeley.\n\nWe now come to No. 6, Mr and Mrs Palmer, John, Ivor, Molly and Alan again all older than us, we were the youngest family in the Crescent - no other young children living there. John and Ivor got married and moved on Molly was a post lady for years - very smart - dyed her hair black until the day she died!! Alan was an electrician. They were a great friend of Auntie Ethel's and when Auntie Ethel went for 2 weeks respite holiday to Porthcawl, Molly went as her carer.\n\nNext door to the Palmers at No. 7 were Mr and Mrs. Taylor, one son again, much older than us - none of us was very fond of Mrs Taylor. I don't think that she liked the idea of a gang of children arriving next door to her.\n\nNow we come to the most important house in the Crescent, No. 8 (the Harris abode) since we had moved up from the lane a lot of things had changed, Dada no longer worked for Billy Howells. He had finished the coal business and just took any job that came along - despite months of sickness, Mama had started more cleaning jobs - she had besides White and Harry Davies Gertie John (newsagent), Dolly Smale (confectioner) we loved this one: because half her wages was in sweets and chocolate, cleaning for Mrs Cummings (she lived in a flat over Wallace the shoe shop) and any others she could get. One bad memory I've got was when Dada was offered a job as a night watchman - if you refused a job you got no dole money - I can remember it to this day - it was in Sketty, Dada cycled up to Sketty (with his chest!!) and Mama and I put the children to bed and sat up until 6am waiting for him to come home result - Dada in bed for weeks with pneumonia. It was this time that Edna will never forget she has told me time and time again how she'll never forget Clifford Bale. Dada was so ill he was too weak to walk, when Clifford heard this he knew if you didn't sign on the dole (in Devon Tea) you wouldn't get any money. Clifford was also a coal man he brought his lorry up to the house, practically carried Dada down, and took him to sign on. Edna said that when they arrived at the office where the queues were waiting to be paid, they all moved out of the way so that Clifford could take Dada up the front. Edna said it was because they all thought so highly of Dada those few shillings save Mama's life for the next week!!\n\nI can also remember that if ever there was any form filling to be done - Edna was always there. She said she was Dada's secretary. I said it then and I will say it forever, Edna was Dada's best friend. She was the one he took on walks on a Sunday morning, he loved talking to her (they were on the same level). I can always remember Rene Ace (the butcher's daughter) telling me that she had seen Edna out with her college boyfriend. I said she hasn't got a boyfriend. Rene said I saw them - he had a green and white scarf on- but he's much too old for her. I suddenly realised and told Rene she was with my father who was wearing Edna's High school scarf - great joke. I can also remember Edna telling me Dada used to take her for walks over to the golf links and showed her the mushrooms growing before her eyes.\n\nDada was having good and bad times-more bad than good.\n\nOne day a letter arrived from Nottingham, from Gran, she wanted to come for a week's holiday and to bring her Granddaughter, our cousin Joan Webber with her, Dada was thrilled to show her our new abode, a bedroom of her own, for a week she arrived, tears all round, but none of us took to our cousin, a tall, skinny girl, who wasn't very impressed with any of us. We did our best to entertain her, took her up the Castle Field (she didn't like the ruins), we took her down the beach (water was too cold), we tried. I think the only place Gran went to was Village Lane, for old times' sake. We weren't too sorry when the week was up. We know that Gran didn't really want to go back. think it was a couple of years later that Dada had a letter from Nottingham (his sister Maggie) saying Gran had had a fall and she thought he had better get up there. Gran had fallen in the snow and had broken her hip and had pneumonia, she didn't last very long after that. Dada came back devastated, all he said she kept saying to me, Alb take me back home, take me back home. It took him a long time to get over that we couldn't sit together because it was so full.\n\nSo many things seemed to happen in the Crescent, but with eight of us, one would get over it, and another one would start up. remember having a big scare with Bertie, he was about 6, always had a bad chest, but this time we had to have the Doctor Dendy, things looked bad for a long time, but he came through it and don't think he had any chest trouble after that. When he was getting better, we took him out in his pushchair, he was too weak to walk, and he met one of the children in his class Geoff Banford from West Cross, he asked Bert when he was coming back to school, Bert looked at him and said \"I've left\" a future Headmaster!!!\n\nBy this time, we had more or less stopped going down to Village Lane, and Mama seemed to be more friendly with Mrs Davies (Aunt Minnie's wife) same number of children as us. My job was to go up to Castle Street every Friday to get a bag of fish- they sold it from the house. I'd knock the door and the first thing would say was is your father in- if I'd get yes didn't mind, he'd only charge me 6d for a full bag, but if it was no, Mrs Davies would charge me 1/- (what a friend!).\n\nAnother thing that Edna told me about was that Dada came home one day and said fill a bucket with coal and take it up to 'Auntie Minnie's - they've got no fire - i don't know who went up with Edna (I don't know where I was) but Edna always remembers - that when she arrived up at Castle Street (worn out) she was taken into their kitchen where Dorothy Davies was doing her ironing (a pair of white gloves).\n\nI think we will leave No. 8 for the time being and go on to No. 9, Mr and Mrs Phillips, one son Frank and one daughter Madeline. I think Frank was a carpenter. What Madeline did never knew except that she was a dyed blonde who no one ever saw her without her makeup on. I can't remember her working to this day. I used to do most of their shopping for them, something every day, but on Saturday, potatoes and bread regularly. This was the best day. She always gave me 3pence. I always gave this to Mama and she would give me a penny back-riches!!! They were a very nice family and we all got on well with them.\n\nNow to the last house in the Crescent where Mrs Glasbrook lived, a very elderly widow always dressed in black, who seemed to spend all her time sweeping her front steps (never saw her without her sweeping brush). I think that she was quite lonely had no close relatives - one distant niece only visited her once in a while. She became very friendly with Marna, and can always remember her asking Mama if she could come in every Friday night, bath night, to help dry her hair, of course Mama said yes - how long to bath us lot ?? Bath in front of the fire, Mama kept topping the bath up, as each one got out, with a kettle of hot water. Happy days!!\n\nAnother thing that Mrs Glasbrook asked Mama was to send Bertie into her on New Year's Day- a male had to be the first to enter her house (for luck). I can always remember him coming back well rewarded.\n\nThat was all the houses in the Crescent, and the other side of the road were the long back gardens of the houses/shops in Newton Road, the first one which was opposite us was I think Beynons the plumbers. This was divided into 2, the first part used for storage by Beynons and the 2nd part was a long yard and workshop used by Mr Grimshaw, a monumental mason, Dada used to spend hours talking to Mr Grimshaw sitting on the wall in the sun - we always seemed to have lovely summers. What the dust must have done to Dada I'll never know - no masks in those days.\n\nMr Grimshaw lived in Rotherslade Road. I think he was Keith Rosser's Grandfather, a lovely old man who think talked more than he worked-lovely company for Dada. Edna always remembers the day that she heard that she had passed the scholarship, she and her best friend, Pikey (Doreen Wright) ran home to give them the good news. Dada was sitting on the wall with Mr Grimshaw and when they both said, \"we've passed the scholarship\" Mr Grimshaw said \"you clever girls - you've passed the scholarship\" and gave Edna a shilling- untold wealth. Edna said she'd never seen a shilling before!!\n\nNow let's go back to No. 8, a lot had happened from the time we left Village Lane the family had doubled, Eileen (Lena), Ethel, Leslie and David all arrived. Bertie no longer the only boy with five sisters 2 more boys arrived, 5 girls and 3 boys. I can always remember the day that David was born, Dada said to me \"go upstairs to see your mother\". went up and I'll never forget it, Mama said \"look at what I had for my birthday - her birthday was 31 May and David was born 1 June. had the honour of being the first to nurse him some honour-I can see his black hair now. He didn't have it for long. It changed colour in days.\n\nObviously, lots of things must have happened with 8 of us growing up-too many to remember. I think Dada was more out of work than in work sickness and unemployment.\n\nI know that Mama then got yet another cleaning job. She used to walk down to Southend to clean for Harry Libby, a local Councillor. She came home one day and said she had to get tea for a special guest (Harry Libby was a bachelor). She said he was a tall thin gentleman who was so nice to her and thanked her for his tea (it was Sir Edmond Hilary) she was very impressed.\n\nI can't remember the date, but do know that the war had started so Gran Windsor wanted to come back from London and as they owned No. 8 Walters Crescent, obviously wanted their house back. Mama had a few offers of renting one in Chapel Street, one in Newton and then Harry Libby told her about Brooklyn Terrace - Dada said yes immediately - Edna told me years later that Dada was not very happy in Walters Crescent. I didn't know that.\n\nAgain, I can't remember moving, 5 bedrooms and a bathroom-what luxury.\n\nSo goodbye to Walters Crescent and another life begins at Brooklyn Terrace.\n\nAddition:\n\nOriginal tenant of 7 Village Lane (paternal) Grandmother Gran Harris.\n\nVillage Lane from 1921-1929/30.\n\nDada - Bell Ringer in St Paul's before 1914-18. Played cricket for Sketty.\n\nAlso, played rugby and lost his front teeth at Neath!.\n\nTwo stamps short!!\n\nYou have a very persistent daughter (accused them of \"stealing\" the little he'd paid into the stamps scheme when they paid that back to my father saw that they'd turned down any chance of the new NHS era pension (1947/8). Nightwatchman, Driving a Lorry, some jobs to try to get some money. Taken in the back of a coal lorry with hot water bottle and blankets in terrible pain with pleurisy, to the Municipal /Corporation Health offices? Opposite the \"Bible College\" on left going up.\n\nThings now started to change, evacuees returned home, houses in the Terrace changing hands and Mama achieving her lifelong ambition (I didn't know this). Edna told me that Mama had always wanted to have a shop, and this she did. No more cleaning jobs, she rented a room in a house next door to the Board school and then opened her shop. Can you imagine it?\n\nShe took over a paper round covering Langland, Rotherslade and various other streets around that area. It was a very hard area to cover, and the four younger ones were each given a round to cover, with Mama having the biggest and worst round. The four of them all went straight to the shop from school, dumped their bags, and then went on to deliver the papers. She also sold cigarettes and other knick knacks, which she stored in the middle room, in the house, so we had to insure that one room. She also put goods for sale (second hand) notices in the windows and it was amazing what she sold for people. She loved that shop, and it became quite a meeting place for many people. Dada used to wait to hear all the local gossip when she came home. remember Jan Davies (Hullin) telling me that when she was a little girl, she spent a lot of time being comforted by Mama, that family had a very unhappy childhood and she told me that Mama was more than a mother to her.\n\nAnother thing remember was that Mama had for years neglected her teeth and suffered with terrible toothache. No dentist, as she couldn't afford it, and one day she arrived home with a scarf covering her mouth. Dada thought she had a cold, but nearly died of shock when she took the scarf down- she didn't have a tooth in her head. The pain must have been driving her mad, the dentist was only a few doors down from the shop. Mr Lewis, a very nice, kind man. He asked her which tooth she wanted out and she said all of them, just imagine it was the best thing she had ever done and she could eat better without them than with those bad teeth. The only thing she couldn't handle was an apple. If ever we went out for a meal, no-one ever saw her take her teeth out, talk about a sleight of hand, but one of the worst things I remember is that she didn't arrive home at her usual time, Dada sent me out to look for her, when we finally arrived home I thought she had been attacked, but she had fallen coming down Newton Hill, pitch dark, and she had smashed her cheek bone. No doctor and that face troubled her until the day she died. can't remember how long she was in the shop, but things were changing. The four younger ones were now more involved in schoolwork, exams etc. and Mama couldn't possibly do all the rounds, so the time came when she had to close down and by this time Dada was very frail. One thing Edna said (she did all the paperwork) that Mama had certainly not made a loss, and did come out of it with a profit, and if she had had a backing financially, it would have been a little gold mine- that speaks for itself.\n\nThings were changing in the Terrace again - new tenants - National Service - College, and started work, a safe job with Swansea Corporation. The first earner in the family 25 shillings a week. I felt 6ft tall when gave Mama my first earnings. She kept £1 and gave me 5 shillings back to cover my expenses, season ticket etc. As my earnings went up, was able to give Dada pocket money, 10 shillings once a month. I'd put it in his waistcoat pocket on a Friday and Mama would borrow it the following week. I don't think he ever spent it.\n\nI'm now coming to the end of my time in the Terrace but will try to go to the memories of each house. The first house, the old Westfa school was sold and was bought by John Noel from an old Southend family, and he was in school with Bert and became quite a well-known architect. It was empty for some time and one evening it was taken over by a family of squatters. John Noel got all his children together and placed them outside every window and door around the house, half the squatters were inside, the other half lighting fires on the lawn to cook supper. The police could do nothing except stopping any more going in. The squatters eventually gave up and moved out at about 3am -leaving their usual mess. When the house was cleaned up, decorated etc. he decided to let it and the first tenants I remember were Roger and Jill Woollacott and children. We never saw much of Roger, he was working, but.\n\nJill took over the house, decorated all the downstairs flat, papering, painting, tiling floor and walls and one day a lorry arrived with a load of ready mixed cement-they tipped it on the lawn-out came Jill plus children with buckets, spades, rakes, and started making a driveway up to the house, before the cement dried she finished it that day- no sign of Roger. I don't know how long they stayed there, but the next tenant to arrive were Roger and Pam Blythe and children. They weren't there very long; all remember about them was one night we had a very bad snowstorm and Roger came down and cleared all our path for us - they were quite nice neighbours.\n\nNo. 5 was bought by Norman Hunt, a baker and confectioner from Morriston. He let it to his brother and sister-in-law, Reg and Edna Jenkins, he had retired from the Metropolitan Police and came back home to Mumbles with their 2 sons. Soon after they came there Roy won the Australian pools and they then bought the house from Norman Hunt. There was quite a lot of movement in the Terrace and most of the houses were being changed into flats.\n\nWe moved into No. 6 and we let the bottom flat. Mama had also moved out of No. 8 and had bought No. 7, which was already in flats. Mama lived upstairs and for a time let the downstairs flat. She had sold No. 8 to Carl and Christine Redmond who had 2 children and got on very well with Mama. We next have Raymond and Pat Harris and 4 children, Raymond proved to be a great asset to the Terrace - he was a wonderful handyman and was always ready to help everyone. We then had Harry and Millie Jeffries and 2 children, Pauline and Brian. Harry was a lifeboat man and always asked Mama to come and call him if she heard the guns go off in the night and then Millie would tell Mama not to call him, she didn't want him going out on the lifeboat. Most times he heard the guns going off himself. No cars bikes or running, but there were always plenty of volunteers ready to man the boat.\n\nWe now come to the next house occupied by Mrs Bennett and her 2 daughters. Mr Bennett had been gardener and general handyman for Miss Richards, one of the so-called gentry living in West Cross House, known as Miss Dickie Dick. They lived in a tied cottage and when he died, they had to get out then they came to the Terrace. After Mrs Bennett died, another sister came to live with them with her husband, they had been missionaries\n\nin Bogota for many years but had now retired, as time goes on only two of the sisters were left, who by this time were getting frailer, but so independent, but nearly every time Mrs Easton (the ex-missionary) went down to Mumbles she would fall, refuse the ambulance but she always carried Joe's telephone number with her so that he could go and pick her up. I don't know how many times he was called out to her. But there came a time when they weren't able to cook for themselves, they ordered meals on wheels, but couldn't eat them - too big and unappetising, so Mrs Griffiths (another neighbour) and I used to take dinners down to them. It was very sad at the end. found them practically dead - so rang the doctor and he said they either had to go to hospital or a home it turned out to be Campian Gardens. I contacted Mrs Easton's son- in Scotland (I can't remember what he was called, he was Head of the Church in Scotland) he said he would fly down immediately but arrived 10 minutes too late to see his mother. A week after her funeral, her sister died. It was all for the best in the end.\n\nNow we come to the last house in the Terrace. This again was bought by Norman Hunt. I think he must have been a very kind man because he installed his mother and father in laws in the downstairs flat and an elderly aunt upstairs flat. They all seemed to be very happy there.\n\nThere are obviously lots of experiences that I have omitted but there were good times- there were bad times- there were happy times and there were sad times. We were so lucky to have the caring parents that we had. When I think back from a 2-roomed fisherman's cottage to a 5-bedroomed terraced house, all obtained by hard work and many sacrifices, no help from anyone. To this day I am so proud when people say to me \"of course I remember little Mrs Harris\" - what more praise do you want.\n\nSong of Village Lane\n\n'WE ARE THE VILLAGE LANE BOYS WE NEVER MAKE ANY NOISE\n\nWE ARE INVITED WHEREVER WE GO\n\nWE KNOW OUR MANNERS\n\nWE SPEND OUT TANNERS AS WE GO\n\nMARCHING DOWN VILLAGE LANE\n\nTHEN YOU HEAR OLD SOUTHALL SHOUT\n\nPUT THOSE WOODBINES OUT\n\nWE ARE THE VILLAGE LANE BOYS'\n\n# Southall was the local Bobby /policeman\n\nAddendum\n\nI don't know whether it's old age but I'm becoming quite butterfly-minded getting lots of flashbacks, completely out of date, but on the other hand they are all memories. I always remember when I first went out with Joe, every Sunday walking around the cliffs to Pwlldhu. Dada would make sandwiches for us to take (unheard of in Joe's family. Ebenezer Chapel was No. 1 priority) one Sunday I couldn't make out why my haversack was so heavy Dada had put a bottle of beer in for Joe (I was teetotal) I think Joe fell for Dada before he fell for me.\n\nAnother thing I remember, Wynne and Pat used to enjoy walking and they used to take Sandy with them, this particular Sunday afternoon a thunderstorm broke out. Sandy disappeared - they hunted high and low for him and about 2 hours later soaked through to the skin they arrived home afraid to tell Dada that they had lost Sandy, when the first thing she saw sitting in front of the fire was Sandy. Wynne said she didn't know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nAnother thing that always surprised me was how Joe's friends came from every section of the community from the highest to the lowest. An example of this was his Saturday morning meetings in The Waterloo. This was a ritual that couldn't be broken from 11am to 2pm every Saturday, always warmly welcomed by Vince the Italian Landlord. As far as I can remember, these were the regular friends, Gilbert John (I'm not quite sure of his surname) he was quite a tough diamond, a roadsweeper and Joe said he was one of the most knowledgeable men he had ever come across.Norman Lloyd, a carpenter, ex-Merchant navy, a survivor of the Russian convoys, a big strong individual but as kind and gentle as a lamb. Ivor Jones, a very distinguished gentleman, who seemed to do more listening than talking. He was a tax inspector and had a senior position in the Swanse Office.\n\nAlex Peters who was Joe's mentor, a very fine carpenter and after his wife died, Joe practically adopted him, always finding jobs for him to do, and of course always staying for dinner. John Pritchard joined the group later don't know how. He was a retired newspaper correspondent (I think with Reuters) and was also one of the Kardomah gang-fame indeed.Norman Colle a very gifted individual, he was a craftsman in every way, his hobby was growing bonsai trees - they were always perfect, he could paint, write poetry, don't think there was anything he couldn't do. He also was at Dunkirk and came halfway out in a rowing boat and then transferred to a troopship that brought him back to this country, but he had terrible wartime experiences sent out east, captured by the Japanese in Singapore, was transferred to Japan, was torpedoed by the Yanks, captured again, and sent to a Japanese PO.W. camp, there for 3½ years and still much to Joe's disgust always bought Japanese cars. Pat used to join them occasionally when he had nothing else to do. The leader of this little group was Joseph Peregrine, kind, gentle, caring, who could quote anything from the bible and who knew all the words of all the Sankey hymns, but only in Welsh, influence of Ebenezer Chapel. Very well read and could quote so many passages from Shakespeare plays. Once a year, Vince used to organise a coach trip to all the pubs in Carmarthen, with a slap-up dinner at its end, which he paid for. Needless to say, this was always well attended, and thoroughly enjoyed by all. What they used to talk about, I'll never know, but it certainly wasn't about their wartime experiences. I didn't know anything about Joe's army life until lago and Matthew (great nephews) had to do projects in school about the war, it was only then that knew anything about Joe's terrible experiences. He eventually lold me that as far as he was concerned his worst experience was when they released all the men, women and children from the concentration camps. Joe never got over that. He had nightmares about them until the day he died (no counselling in those days).\n\nSaturday morning it was meeting in The Waterloo. Sunday morning a change of scenery- The Newton Inn - a completely different set of friends and acquaintances. It started off with a few of Joe's friends from Mount Pleasant, the first one was Dick Lewis, who was in the infant school in Mount Pleasant, and then Dynevor and were friends for a lifetime. One cockney gentleman joined them-quite a character, who was so proud to tell them that he started work sweeping the floors in Dagenham and ended up as Managing Director opening the Swansea factory. I only remember him as Frank.\n\nAnother occasional visitor was Wynford Vaughan Thomas, who presented Joe with one of his books and wrote in it \"from one Terrace Road boy to another\" Joe loved that. When Pat heard that he had autographed a book for Joe, he asked him if he would do the same for him, which he did, writing \"from one Gower lover to another\" Pat was over the moon!!\n\nLooking back, I never remember being hungry. know that neither Mama n Dada were Cordon Bleu cooks, but always good plain food. Every Sunday lovely roast dinner always starting off with a piece of bread dipped in the lovely beef dripping that the meat was being cooked in. I never remember buying fish and chips from the chip shop - we had plenty of fish (if Aunt Minnie was sober).\n\nMama had a very good appetite and would eat anything you put in front her, but Dada was quite different. A small dainty appetite, one thing that was very partial to was a fried bloater. I can remember being sent over Newton Road to Mr Chambers, fishmonger and greengrocer, to get a bloater for Dada's tea. I think it cost sixpence, but had to have a hard roe, if arri home with a soft roe back had to go to change it. We also had quite a lo rabbit stew (I can't stand rabbit to this day).\n\nDada was also a dab hand at Welsh cakes, pancakes, suet puddings also started making bread, but that turned out to be too long a job and then started having bread delivered twice a week. Mr Tom Davies from Davies Bakers called with his basket full to deliver bread and to have a with Dada. I know did say I never remember buying fish and chips, bu remember buying faggots and peas. Always on a Friday, one of us went up to Mr Treharne the butchers, at the top of Castleton, with two jugs, one for the faggots, the other for the gravy and walked down the hill very carefully. not to lose a drop. Mr Treharne always filled the jug to overflowing because we were a large family. remember he had four sons, Glyn, Gwyn, Noel and Norman. Norman, who was the youngest, was in Evan Davies' class in the Board School, and he and were monitors together until we left. He went to Dynevor and went to the High School.\n\nAnother favourite meal of ours was freshly boiled cockles with bread and butter. Dada made us all a small hand rake- a strip of wood with 6 inch nails nailed into it. I know it was Wynne and me, Edna away, the others were too young. We'd carry our buckets and rakes, walk down to the front and then (the tide had to be out) out to the nets, being warned never to touch any fish that was in the nets, they were rented privately. With our bucket full and the lide coming in back home we came. Mama would soak the cockles in a big in bath out the back and then boil them all in a big saucepan, no standing on ceremony, cockles tipped into a big bowl in the middle of the table and from there on all help yourselves. Nothing in this world ever tasted better than big warm juicy cockles a free meal enjoyed by everyone. Cockling eventually had to finish. Pollution took over and cockling was banned - a sad loss.\n\nAnother seafood that we all enjoyed was Laverbread - most people bought it from the cockle woman who had a pitch outside Johnnie's fish shop on a Saturday morning. She would have walked in from Penclawdd carrying one basket under her arm, the other one on her head, she was always there by gam and had sold out by 1pm. Dada suggested that we should go and pick our own Laverbread (black seaweed) we couldn't go down the front - only sand, no rocks, therefore no seaweed, so off we went to Rotherslade. We filled our bags - more sea water than seaweed and wended our weary way home. Tin bath out the back-seaweed had to be washed about half a dozen times to get rid of all the sand, then chopped up and then boiled for about an hour. Dada had the first taste and really approved - we all agreed that it really was tasty, but no more gathering Laverbread, it was much too hard a job. Dada then had another of his brilliant suggestions, he was going to make some stinging nettle pop up to the Castle Field, armed with a pair of scissors, industrial gloves and a bag - filled the bag and back home. Out comes the tin bath, more washing and chopping. don't remember how it was made, but do know that the end object was not to everyone's taste - no more experiments.\n\nAll our married life Joe had ups and downs health wise, then came a really bad turn, called the doctor (it was Easter time) he told me to contact him after Easter for the results of the X-rays (Dr John Lewis, Joe's family doctor, not mine) he told him to gargle etc. as he had Tracheitis. I wasn't too happy about this and rang the clinic for Joe's x-ray results-shock after shock-pulmonary TB, one lung very badly damaged, the other also in a bad state. Home to bed, but Joe decided that he would like a run round Gower if he was likely to be grounded for some time- the only one with a car was Bert, who took Joe for an afternoon round all Joe's Gower haunts. Back home to be assessed by TB doctor either Craig y Nos or Sully Hospitals, \"Neither\" said Joe. \"I'm staying here.\"- panic the doctor gave him an ultimatum, 3 months trial at home, if no better, hospital - he turned out to be the best patient ever. Now living in 3 rooms, change the lounge into bedroom - bed brought down from top story and 3-piece suite taken up. slept on the couch at the top of the house for the next two years who was the organiser for all this- there was only one person - Mama.\n\nDada had died in the January. Tim was born in February and Mama looked after him so that Edna could go back to work and Joe was taken ill in the March. She took everything on - how would have managed without her I'll never know. After a time, Joe's salary was stopped so had to go to work part-time. Joe told me that the first day I went back was the longest day of his life. It was at this time that realised how close Joe was to Mama, I always said he was closer to her than to his own mother. On the other hand, what a good son he was, visited his mother every week, did all her shopping and aways saw that she was well looked after - he also took all responsibility for his brother Ben and visited him regularly at Cefn Coed. think it was over 25 years and when his sister Bessie was left on her own, he made sure that she was also well taken care of and when she became very ill at the end, he brought her down to live with us, so that she didn't die alone - and she didn't he was with her. After 12 months in bed, Joe was allowed up for 15 minutes, his first walk was into No. 8 to Mama and this he did every day. They each knew all the others secrets.\n\nTime goes on - things change- children grow up - College, Army, new jobs, marriages everything happens and then much to our surprise, Mrs Peake wanted to sell No. 8. Mama had first choice, no money, couldn't get a mortgage, so what happens Joe was a member since childhood of the Rechabites (he'd never stopped paying the annual fee) they willingly offered Mama a mortgage, but she had to have a guarantor. What did Joe do? Gave Mama the deeds of our house, which the Rechabites willingly accepted. Can you imagine the deeds of our house Joe said he had no worries about it. knew that Mama would never let me down and as he said it was the only way he would ever be able to pay her back.\n\nI know that at the back of my mind lie many more memories, good, bad and indifferent, but I'm afraid I shall have to let them lie dormant at the moment. There may come a time when will want to reminisce, we'll wait and see, but all know is that there can't be many people who have been as lucky as I have been - a husband in a million together with a mother who to this day everyone speaks about with love and affection. Neither of them will ever be forgotten, and speak to them both every day.\n\nWhat more could I want.\n\nNotes\n\nI can't visualise any houses on the right as you go up, i.e. before Hall bank! Explanation? No. 1 and 2 on left at bottom-empty land never built on?\n\nAmerican Jones's\n\nMrs Stainton on Mumbles Road (Tom/son cricket)\n\nAmelia Brock (donkey... was a Jones)\n\nJoyce Medwin (mother Marie Jones). [Joyce married Terry Madwin (\"Spurs\") Tottenham Hotspur].\n\nTex Llewellyn (mother) Ivy married Bob [Tex became a Cambridge don]\n\nEvan Jones was an Am. Jones lived next door down from The Orphanage.\n\nCopyright: Doreen Peregrine 2021\n\nThe Regent cinema which seemed to decline, due to television and many other kinds of entertainment and by 1940 it became the HQ of ’C’ Company of 12th Battalion, Home Guard. After the war it reopened as The Casino Dancehall, which was very popular for many years. It was sold and then completely gutted and rebuilt as a nice little arcade with two small cafes and various other businesses. A new upper floor of the same building, held several discothèques or nightclubs, including: The Showboat, Tiffany’s, Nutz, Stud’s, Howard’s and Bentley’s. This is now a venue for children's playgroups, parties etc. There have been quite a few changes, but on the whole, it has seemed to be quite successful. Next door there was another small kiosk, which is now a cobbler's shop, doing all sorts of leather repairs, batteries for watches and clocks, Together with many other sundries. Lena is one of his best customers, as she started by taking all Auntie Violette’s shoes there and now continues with her own.\n\nTime goes on and the mind wanders, I realised that I have left out one or two shops, so will go back, to Harry Davis the fruiterer who had one son, who wasn't interested in the business, so when it came for Mr Davis to retire, the shop was sold and was taken over by a very smart and modern shoe shop. I remember buying a pair of shoes there and I must have had a mad moment,as they cost me £12!!! After a few years trading, the owner, who lived in Llanelli, decided he wanted to open a shop in his hometown, so sold his business and moved on. The person who missed him most was a young Spastic girl, Sheila, who I first met when I helped to run the club for the handicapped in Mumbles. She could only hobble around on crutches, completely crippled, not a miserable bone in her body, pretty is a picture and you never heard a word of complaint from her. She used to tell me that her body was a mess, but tapping her forehead she would say, 'but there's nothing wrong up here.'. How right she was, giving the education, she would have gone a long way. Every morning she would hobble down Newton road on her crutches to the shoe shop, and the young man waited for her to arrive, so that he would put her specially adapted shoes on, no carers in those days. I think of all the people that I know she is the one that I admire the most. Today that shoe shop is a very thriving wine shop called cheers.\n\nNext door is a very small shop a Delicatessen, selling all kinds of unusual foods, relative to modern day diets, olives various cheeses, herbs of all kinds and is always very busy.\n\nWe now come to another high-class Gown shop, run by Mrs Marjory Gissing. It's amazing how many classy Gown shops we had and I think Mumbles was quite a wealthy little place. I think she used to change her windows every day and she herself was a very good advert, very tall and smart, I can see her now. I don't think she would be too happy knowing that her shop is now a charity shop, which it is. But before the charity shop, it was Hodges the men's outfitter. I remember Dorothy Cope (the wife of Di Cope, who ran the DIY shop in the top of Newton Rd) worked there for a lifetime.if you wanted any news go in and see Dorothy.\n\nI remember most people had a Christmas club, and Mama made Leslie start one when he started work at 2/6d a week, every week when he had his wages, Mama waited for his 2/6d. He forgot one week and when Mama reminded him, he said very seriously, mam I'm saving more than I'm earning. Those are the days.\n\nWe now come to another butchers, Reese the butcher, Mr and Mrs Reeves, one assistant and one son John, who was not interested in the business, she eventually left home and went to Australia which devastated his parents, who then sold the business and moved on. I don't know where they went. I can't remember who took it over, but funnily enough it is once again a butcher shop.\n\nIt's amazing that there were three butchers in Mumbles, two in Newton, two in Southend, one in Queens Road and the same with grocers shops, I have counted about eight. Mumble's must have been quite a thriving little place. I can also count four banks, one of which we know come to, Barclays. I remember when John Jones was made manager, two quite well-known Mumbles people changed their banks (no names) because they did not want him to know their financial state. I wonder if they were fiddling the tax people, who knows?\n\nWe now come to the next shop, Mr and Mrs O'Neill, they had a daughter Rhona, who was a year older than me, but unfortunately, she died when she was about fourteen, I think she had TB. She was their only child and of course they were devastated. from what I can remember there was a radio shop and he seemed to do all the repairs in the shop, it was there for quite a long time, and I think it's now another craft shop. Our next shop is a fishmonger and greengrocer, owned by Mr Chambers, his wife, daughter. Mary used to work with him in the shop and he had one assistant, Jean Thomas, from Thistleboon, who worked for him for use. It was a shop that I never liked, it never seemed to be clean, the only time we ever went in there was to buy a Bloater, which had to have a hard Roe, which Dada loved to have fried for his tea. Why a Bloater when we used to have a frail full of fish from Auntie Minnie? none of us liked Bloaters and I even disliked having to go and buy one.\n\nWe now come to another bank, Lloyds, what do you think about it four banks in a small place like Mumbles and then next door another chemist, four chemists in Mumbles this was Mr Stratford. I cannot remember anyone working with him, all I know is that Dada got on very well with him, as he did with Mr Moss the other chemist and funnily enough after all these years it is once again a very busy chemist shop.\n\nThe next shop I remember is Mr Withey, fruiterer and greengrocer. One son Ron, he did all the deliveries, one of our neighbours in Brooklyn Terrace Millie Jeffries worked there part time for many years and every Saturday night after finishing work she brought Joe a bunch of watercress. she said it was good for his chest, I wish!!! I think this is probably Greg's the Baker and confectioner, A very popular takeaway."
