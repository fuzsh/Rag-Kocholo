        "text": "There are several ways to have more than one language in your world. Here are some ideas:\n\nYour characters might be conversant in more than one language. If your characters are high-born or a hereditary merchants, it makes perfect sense for foreign languages to be part of their education. You can even mention they have an accent, or have trouble understanding expressions.\n\nThere might be a lingua franca - a language that people learn as a second language for the explicit purpose of communicating with other people whose language they don't share.\n\nPeople might actually not understand each other, communicate through hand gestures, seek a translator, etc.\n\nThere is the option of magic/translator microbes/babel fish - a fantasy tool fitted to the setting, that just lets people understand each other. But that, in my opinion, is the least interesting solution. (Not that it's always bad. Sometimes it's boring but practical - handwaves the problem, and lets you get on with telling the story.)\n\nSome books in the fantasy genre make use of these tools. Look, for example, at the \"Lord of the Rings\": \"Common Speech\" (a.k.a English) is a language all characters are at least conversant in, it is the lingua franca of western Middle Earth, as well as the MCs' mother tongue. However, the hobbits have their unique dialect of \"Common\", with some unique words. Frodo, the MC, knows enough Quenya (one of the languages of the elves) for a polite greeting, but not much more than that (basically \"please\" and \"thank you\"). While elven nobility are fluent in Quenya, Sindarin and Common, we also encounter elves who do not speak Common, and Legolas, an elf, serves as translator.The Rohirrim (a human nation) have their own language, which the hobbits recognise as being somewhat related to where their unique words come from. When the Rohirrim choose not to address visitors in Common, it is considered lack of courtesy, but they certainly talk and sing in their own language among themselves (Aragorn is the one to translate this time). There's also the language of the Dwarves, which they keep secret from strangers so we only get glimpses of it in place names, Dark Speech (with multiple dialects), whatever languages the Southorns and Easterlings speak (we know nothing of those save that they are not the Common), and so on.\n\nYou can work around the language barrier the same way we do in real life: have someone act as a translator. There are three ways of introducing such a character:\n\nOption 1: The moment the need for a translator arises, one of your characters randomly sticks his hand up and goes, \"Oh, I speak language X!\" Don't do this, except for comedy value (see: Airplane!). It's a lazy deus ex machina.\n\nOption 2: The characters know they'll need someone who speaks language X, and seek them out in advance. This may mean having to create a new character just to fulfil the \"translator\" role, though.\n\nOption 3: The people who speak language X bring a translator along with them when they meet the protgaonists. This is my personal preference: it's a much less jarring handwave than Option 1.\n\nNone of these options are perfect, but of course, there's a reason many fantasy works use the \"everyone speaks the same language\" handwave: sheer convenience. It annoys me too, though, so kudos to you for breaking the mould.\n\nIt may or may not be true that every crisis in the real world is an opportunity, but it is true that every writing challenge is a writing opportunity. The challenge of multiple language isn't an obstacle to overcome, it's a chance to show things about the world your characters live in, the mindset of your world's difficult cultures, the relationship between societies, the developing relationships between characters who speak different languages, and so forth.\n\nOf course, doing that well would take a lot of work. If you don't want to put that effort in --no judgement --the best choice is probably to just do what everyone else does and ignore the implausibility of it. Like other standard choices, it becomes invisible that way. Any other way of addressing it will probably just call unwanted attention to it.\n\nIt's worth noting however, that quite a large percentage of the real world population is in fact fluent in multiple languages. If you're willing to foreground this aspect of your worldbuilding, the possibilities are endless. Which language is high status? Which is low status? Who knows multiple languages, and who doesn't? Who secretly understands a language she pretends not to? Who secretly doesn't understand a language as well as he pretends? What happens when you absolutely have to communicate with someone whose language is utterly alien? The storytelling possibilities are wide open. (Samuel Delany even developed an entire, critically acclaimed novel around this very issue --a linguist was his hero.)\n\nYou really misunderstand how fiction works.\n\nIn most novels and short stories the characters never visit the toilet. Does that mean that Frodo, Macbeth, or Odysseus never defecated? No. It just means that everyone knows that people have to move their bowels, and that since it is irrelevant to the story it is not mentioned. Just like breathing, wearing clothes, and everything else that people do on a regular basis and take for granted.\n\nNow everyone knows from personal experience that people speak different languages and that you have to learn foreign languages to communicate internationally. It is such a common and therefore banal fact of everyday life, that you don't have to mention it in fiction for readers to understand that it is going on when people from different countries interact.\n\nThat said, languages do play a role in many works of fantasy and science fiction, when they are relevant to the storyline. A recent example is the movie Arrival in which the attempt to communicate with aliens is the driving \"antagonistic\" force of the plot and the heroine is a linguist.\n\nTranslation devices, such as Star Trek's \"universal translator\", are a common gadget in SF, but there are quite a few fantasy novels in which language learning or translators play some role, as well. And if they don't, just think of how often you heard of interpreters in history class in school â€“ probably never, although they are just as much a part of trade and politics, both in the real world and in fantasy novels, as aides, chauffeurs, or speechwriters (of which you don't hear much in reality or fantasy, either).\n\nFarscape Translator Microbes.\n\nIn the SyFy series Farscape, Translator Microbes infected everybody, including the human thrust into this alien universe. In the pilot episode, John Crichton pops out of a wormhole and ends up on an alien ship. Everybody on it is talking gibberish. He clearly does not understand them, then a little floor robot thing injects him with something. A few minutes later their speech is interspersed with English and then they all seem to be talking English.\n\nYour exact point is made by Crichton about this; they explain somehow he was raised without the translator microbes so they ordered the robot to inject him. Everybody speaks their own languages, but it is automatically translated.\n\nNear the end of the series (1993) astronaut John Crichton finally makes his way back to Earth, and can understand every language on Earth.\n\nWrite what people intended to say, not the sounds of the words.\n\nWe don't write character accents phonetically (hopefully). We don't add every \"umâ€¦\" and pause that's used in normal speech. Instead we write what characters meant, not the individual phonems coming out of their mouths.\n\nBy extension, we don't need to hear that lizardmen lisp the letter S, and that werewolves have trouble with P and M because fangs don't allow their lips to close. Unless there is some specific comedy of errors because of a mispronunciation, or the accent makes them the butt of a joke, it's better to just write what they meant.\n\nSpeaking a different language is a bit of a leap, but really it is the same idea. It doesn't matter which language they use at any moment, they may be bilingual or working among others in a common language of borrowed words, what matters is what they intended to communicate. So just write what they meant.\n\nWhen the POV is third-person limited, your MC will either understand what was said or not, as the plot dictates. The longer she hears a foreign language the more words she'll pick up, and the meaning will start to come across before she becomes a fluent speaker. You can show this by having her understand only a few words at first: \"Stephanieâ€¦ airlockâ€¦ come!\" It's not that someone is speaking to her in a pigeon language, it's that she is only picking up familiar words.\n\nCharacters in a bilingual environment will share words from both languages mid-sentence, and fluent speakers will be comfortable speaking in both languages, so consider it a skillset among your characters rather than a realworld detail you need to show the audience.\n\nNot likely. Languages don't work like that, over long periods of time, and especially not when they evolve naturally.\n\nLook at how language evolved in our world. From Wikipedia or the entire subsection of scholarly research into it. Boiled down to basics, before there was language, there were proto-languages. These proto-languages got more and more complex as our need for new words to describe new things expanded (that's not just a source of meat, that's a bear, and it can kill you if you're not careful!) The thing is, they sprung up in different places, and spread with those groups. That's why tonal languages (some African languages, Chinese) are so different. Why Slavic languages (Russian, for example) are so different. Why sentence structure in Japanese is different from English, let alone what you can omit in a sentence and still have it make perfect sense.\n\nNow, that isn't to say there won't be a commonly agreed upon language of trade. But that gets tricky, because of the vast majority of languages on offer. Today the languages of engineering and commerce are (and please feel free to add any one you feel I've omitted):\n\nGerman\n\nChinese\n\nSpanish\n\nEnglish\n\nAnd it gets even more complex if you get into certain fields. In IT (programming especially) the main language (of the west) is English. In medicine it's Latin. So there still isn't a universally agreed upon language.\n\nPeople might learn a simple constructed language when they are older which has a fixed set of rules. (Old enough, that it isn't a native language.) Together with rigid rules this should prevent the language drifting.\n\nThis works similar to a lingua franca but you can justify more people knowing it because the language can be easier to learn than natural languages. You still have native languages and the locals can discuss secrets which your protagonists can't understand.\n\nAs an Example, the constructed language Esperanto has \"la Fundamento\" which enshrines its grammar and basic vocabulary. La Fundamento is 113 Years old now and (apart from some disagreement on gender neutral pronouns) still applies to modern day Esperanto. Details around it evolve, but the core remains stable. This is despite people marrying inside the Esperanto community and raising \"Denaskuloj\" which learn Esperanto as a first language.\n\nOf course this brings its own set of problems: Why that language and why a constructed one. Its not like Esperanto is that successful in our World. But if you like this option, the folks in the Worldbuilding stackexchange would surely love to help you with ideas.\n\nWhen I wrote a Sci-Fi novel a couple of years ago (humans visiting a planet with human-lookalikes and a civilization like ours), I solved this problem by letting the crew get a 'Language transplant', a direct modification of the language-center of their brains.\n\nThe language itself was recorded from human satellites orbiting the planet, and translated and understood by an AI. Then all words and phrases was modified in the brain, and the crew would now talk and understand this language, but no longer their own.\n\nThis should be changed back to their original language when they returned. Obviously, they could not read and write this new language, but that didn't matter.\n\nI made this up out of laziness, because I just wanted to come around the language-problem in a fast way. It did not have anything else to do in the story.\n\nUnfortunately the language-issue did play an important role later in the story, which made the process shine a little to the eyes, but I thought 'Hey, this is Sci-Fi, isn't it?'"
