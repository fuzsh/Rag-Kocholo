        "text": "Assalomu alaykum\n\nYou are using the prep in in order to make adverb, with a help of a structure: in + adj + way/manner or in a way/manner that is....\n\nShe is dancing in a beautiful way/manner. (It is {the structure} only describing a verb which adverb always does.)\n\nIn this case you can't use by because it cannot give the meaning that in gives, that's why your 1b and 2b sentences are wrong.\n\n“In a way that …” is idiomatic. “By a way that …” is not.\n\nThe answer that you cite does not really address the question asked. Notice that the answer has not been upvoted once in almost nine years. Furthermore, the question itself involved communicating about mathematics, a field with a specialized jargon of its own.\n\nLet’s try from scratch.\n\nShe explained it by a simple method\n\nShe explained it in a simple way\n\nBoth mean the same thing, and either may used in formal writing, but the second probably would be far more common in speech or an email.\n\nPrepositions are frequently constrained by usage rather than some distinction in the formal meaning of the prepositions themselves.\n\nUsage favors “in a manner” or “in a way” rather than “by a manner” or “by a way.”\n\nhttps://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=in+a+way+that%2C+by+a+way+that&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cin%20a%20way%20that%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cby%20a%20way%20that%3B%2Cc0\n\nSimilarly, usage favors “by a method” rather than “in a method.”\n\nhttps://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=in+a+method+that%2C+by+a+method+that&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cin%20a%20method%20that%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cby%20a%20method%20that%3B%2Cc0\n\nWhich preposition goes with which verbs or nouns is not always subject to logical rules. Sometimes, you just have to learn from experience, which is of course how native speakers learn to use prepositions. The peculiarities of English prepositions must be exasperating to learners. I certainly found the subtleties between “en” and “dans” in French exasperating.\n\nI do venture a general guideline, however. Prepositional phrases that describe the manner or emotion of an actor often use “in”\n\nShe spoke in gentle tones\n\nShe raged in grief\n\nPrepositional phrases that describe the means an actor used often use “by.”\n\nShe taught by the Socratic method\n\nHe reached his conclusions by uncannily prescient intuition rather than by carefully designed experiment.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not some adamantine rule.\n\nHe taught in parables\n\nor\n\nHe taught by parables\n\nare equally idiomatic. They may imply virtually subliminal differences in meaning, but 99.9% of native speakers would have difficulty in identifying, let alone justifying, any difference in meaning."
