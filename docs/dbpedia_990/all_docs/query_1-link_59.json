Unlike babies learning their mother tongue, our learners have complex minds. Lists of definitions and rules fail to engage that complexity, and so most of them fall into forgetfulness. Critical thinking learning activities engage more of their brain’s interconnections. As a result, new words and grammatical patterns stick and become more available for productive language.\n\nUsing thematic units in the EFL classroom is a great way to attach interesting and relevant content to language learning. Of particular interest to many learners are themes related to the culture and society of English-speaking countries. However, because of English's unique role as the global lingua franca, teachers must remember that skills of awareness and adaptation to unfamiliar contexts are just as important as factual information. We cannot predict where, when and with whom our learners will use English. It is entirely possible that they may never use English with native speakers!\n\nStill, all language use is related to culture in one way or another and, as such, culture must be part of what we teach. To that end, this webinar will demonstrate how teachers can use one theme in American culture and society, Baseball, to give learners a toolkit for deciphering and using messages that contain a deep cultural context, no matter their source.\n\nThis session, \"Connecting to Learn: Growing Professionally through Teacher-to-Teacher Engagement,\" explores how connecting and conversing with peers can offer teachers great opportunities for professional growth.
