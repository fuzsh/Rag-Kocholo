        "text": "Formal and informal language serve different purposes in written communications depending on the reader (Audience) and reason for writing (Purpose). The tone, the choice of words and the way the words are put together vary between the two different styles.\n\nFormal language is less personal than informal language. It is used when writing for professional or academic purposes like graduate school assignments. Formal language does not use colloquialisms, contractions or first-person pronouns such as “I” or “We.”\n\nInformal language is more casual and spontaneous. It is used when communicating with friends or family either in writing or in conversation. It is used when writing personal emails, text messages and in some business correspondence. The tone of informal language is more personal than formal language.\n\nExamples of formal and informal language are shown below:\n\nContractions\n\nInformal:The improvements can’t be made due to budget cuts.\n\nFormal: Improvements cannot be made due to budget restrictions.\n\nPhrasal Verbs\n\nThe balloon was blown up for the experiment.\n\nThe balloon was inflated for the experiment\n\nSlang/Colloquialism\n\nProfessors still count on students to use correct grammar and punctuation in essays.\n\nProfessors expect students to use correct grammar and punctuation in essays.\n\nFirst Person Pronouns"
