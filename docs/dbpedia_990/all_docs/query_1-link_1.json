Or, if you're offering it as evidence, you can simply say \"as evidence\", or otherwise indicate the reason you are including this extra information.\n\nRegardless of what phrase you choose to use, it would be a good idea to indicate why you are including the information in the first place, even in just these brief ways. Better to make the viewer think you are expanding your point, rather than drawing away from it to talk about something else.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it. It will seem like you are sidetracking, and in important/formal times, you certainly don't want to sidetrack!\n\nI don't know about the film thing, but certainly not in formal settings.\n\nYou'd probably have said something like:\n\nAlso, there is..."
