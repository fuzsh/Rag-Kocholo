        "text": "Affect or Effect?\n\nBoth of these words are verbs and nouns and their meanings overlap. This can be confusing to those whose first language is English. It can be baffling to those whose first language is one other than English.\n\nHere is a basic guideline for affect or effect that can help clarify how to use the two words correctly:\n\nGenerally, we use affect as a verb (an action word) and effect as a noun (an object word).\n\nWhat Does Affect Mean?\n\nThe verb affect means “to act on; produce a change in” as in, “The cold weather affected the crops.”\n\n(The cold weather produced a change in the crops.)\n\nThe verb affect can also mean “to impress the mind or move the feelings of,” as in “The music deeply affected him.” (The music changed his feelings or thoughts).\n\nIf you can substitute affect with another verb, you are using the right word:\n\n“The cold weather damaged the crop.” “The music deeply moved him.”\n\nSo, when you want to use a word to express a change or to describe an action, choose affect.\n\nWhat Does Effect Mean?\n\nEffect is most commonly used as a noun, meaning “result” or “consequence.” One way to decide if effect is the correct word to use is to replace it with another noun. For example, “His sunburn was an effect of exposure to the sun.” Another way to say it is, “His sunburn was a result of exposure to the sun.”\n\nHow to Remember the Difference between Affect and Effect\n\nThere is one trick to help you use the right word in almost every case: the word RAVEN:\n\nR = Remember\n\nA = Affect is a\n\nV = Verb\n\nE = Effect is a\n\nN = Noun\n\nHere is another way to remember when to use affect and effect:\n\nA is for action (affect); E is for end result (effect). But to fully understand a word's meaning, it helps to see it in action. Let us review some of the grammar rules that regulate affect and effect with some tips and examples.\n\nAffect\n\nAffect is almost always used as a verb to mean to influence someone or something, rather than to cause something.\n\nHow does one’s personality affect success on the job?\n\nThese weather conditions will affect the number of people who will come to the outdoor concert.\n\nAffect can be used as a noun in one particular situation: when referring to a display of emotion.\n\nThe young man's facial expressions had a humorous affect.\n\nGeorgette took the news of her company moving to Chicago with little affect.\n\nEffect\n\nEffect is most often used as a noun. It points toward an event or a thing. It is often used when an end result is being discussed.\n\nWhat effect did the schedule of games have on the team?\n\nDid his retirement have any effect on his family?\n\nEffect can follow these words: the, any, an, into, on, take, or. (Affect cannot!)\n\nThe prescribed medication had an effect on the patient's symptoms.\n\nWe have to give the changes time to take effect.\n\nEffect can be used as a verb in one particular situation. It can be used to mean to accomplish something or to cause something to happen.\n\nThe new manager is bound to effect positive changes in the office.\n\nAll this rain will effect a great harvest.\n\nAffect and Effect in Sentences\n\nHere are some affect or effect example sentences for an even clearer picture of the difference between the two words and how they are used.\n\nUsing affect in a sentence:\n\nAn early frost in Florida can affect the orange crop negatively.\n\nSmoking tobacco can adversely affect your lungs and blood flow.\n\nHugs can affect a person's immune system in a positive way.\n\nHow much a student studies will affect his or her grade point average\n\nMy first-grade teacher affected my self-image and helped me believe in myself.\n\nUsing effect in a sentence:\n\nThe new law prohibiting texting while driving will go into effect tomorrow.\n\nA dark paint color will have the effect of making the room seem smaller.\n\nThe special effects in movies today are aided by computers.\n\nNews broadcasts can have a huge effect on public opinion.\n\nA good night's sleep has a positive effect on your day.\n\nRecap: When to Use Affect or Effect\n\nWorth repeating:\n\nUse affect as the verb in a sentence when talking about producing change or making a difference. For example,\n\na new discovery can affect a scientific theory, and failing a test can affect someone’s mood.\n\nHere are some synonyms of affect: alter, change, influence, modify and impact (the verb version). That list should affect your understanding of the word. In this case, affect would mean “improve.”\n\nEffect is a noun, and it is the outcome of an event or situation that created a change. The effect of the change can be big or small, but the fact that something changed is what makes the noun form of effect so important. For example, you can feel the effects of a cold or an earthquake, and the sun coming out can have a positive effect on your mood.\n\nSome synonyms of effect include words like result, repercussion, consequence, outcome, aftermath and the noun version of impact.\n\nThink RAVEN:\n\nR = Remember\n\nA = Affect is a\n\nV = Verb\n\nE = Effect is a\n\nN = Noun"
