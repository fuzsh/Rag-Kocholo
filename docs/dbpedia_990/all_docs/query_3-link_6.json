Thank you.\n\n\"Do you speak English?\" is perfectly fine. I would not use \"Can you speak English\" because it has a slightly more blunt sound.\n\nHi, Would you please help me find out the possible difference between them?\n\nIf I meet a stranger ,which way is polite? Both? Thank you.\n\nThey both look fine and seem equally polite to me.\n\nEDIT: Actually, I'm tending towards Dimcl's suggestion that \"Can you speak English?\" is a little blunt.\n\nThe only thing I'd say is that \"Can you speak English?\" might be interpreted sometimes as meaning \"Could you speak English?\" rather than \"Are you capable of speaking English?\" I think \"Do you speak English?\" would be completely safe and you could use that without fear of causing offence or confusion.\n\nBy the way, welcome to the forums and have you had a look at the FAQ/rules? One of the rules is that we are not to use abbreviations such as \"plz\" instead of \"please\".\n\nThey both look fine and seem equally polite to me.\n\nThe only thing I'd say is that \"Can you speak English?\" might be interpreted sometimes as meaning \"Could you speak English?\" rather than \"Are you capable of speaking English?\"\n\nAs when someone begins to talk in a language you don't understand. I agree.\n\nI prefer \"Do you speak English?\" too. But I've been asked \"Can you...\" (meaning \"Are you capable of...\") so many times that I don't mind it.\n\nJust a little off-topic advice - it's highly impolite when you use either with someone you know is a native speaker of English\n\nI'd ratchet that up a notch to \"highly insulting\"!\n\nThey both look fine and seem equally polite to me.\n\nEDIT: Actually, I'm tending towards Dimcl's suggestion that \"Can you speak English?\" is a little blunt.\n\nThe only thing I'd say is that \"Can you speak English?\" might be interpreted sometimes as meaning \"Could you speak English?\" rather than \"Are you capable of speaking English?\" I think \"Do you speak English?\" would be completely safe and you could use that without fear of causing offence or confusion.\n\nBy the way, welcome to the forums and have you had a look at the FAQ/rules?

Thanks.\n\nHi, cycloneviv, I think I understand more after reading your guys' posts, but I want to ask more similar sentences if you don't mind, examples like \"Do you swim?\" vs.\"Can you swim?\" the later means \"Do you know how to swim?\" ,Am I right? Thanks.\n\nSheila, another one of those rules that you haven't got around to reading yet )) is that we are supposed to start new threads for new questions. I will say, though, that you're right - \"Can you swim?\" means do you have the ability to swim."
