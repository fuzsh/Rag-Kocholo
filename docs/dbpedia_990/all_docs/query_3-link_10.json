        "text": "Cactus\n\nunread,\n\nto Night ESC\n\nHi all,\n\nI found 7 rules to speak English automatically.. without thinking on\n\nthe internet, and share to everybody. Enjoy it!\n\n- Rule 1: ALWAYS STUDY AND REVIEW PHRASES, NOT INDIVIDUAL WORDS:\n\nPhrases are group of words that naturally go together. In fact,\n\nwhen you learn phrases you learn both vocabulary and grammar - easily\n\nand automatically.\n\nWhen you find a new word, always write down the Phrase it is in.\n\nAlways. When you review, always review all of the phrase... not just\n\nthe word.\n\n- Rule 2: DON'T STUDY GRAMMAR\n\nGrammar rules teach you to think about English, you want to\n\nspeak English automatically - without thinking. So Don’t study\n\nGrammar. (I’ll tell you later)\n\n- Rule 3: THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE - LISTENING FIRST\n\nYou must listen to UNDERSTANDABLE English. You must listen to\n\nEnglish EVERYDAY. Don't read text book. Just listen.\n\nLearn with your ears, not your eyes. In most school, you learn\n\nEnglish with your eyes, you read text book, you study grammar rules.\n\nSo try to listen 1-3 hours a day, spend most of your study time\n\nlistening - that's the key to great speaking.\n\n- Rule 4: SLOW- DEEP LEARNING IS BEST\n\nThe secret to speaking easily is to learn every word and phrase\n\ndeeply. You learn a lot of words in the short time, your learning is\n\nshort and shallow, that's why you quickly forgot the words. It is not\n\nenough to know a definition, It's not enough to remember the text, you\n\nmust put the word into your brain. To speak English easily, you must\n\nrepeat each lesson many times.\n\nHow do you learn deeply? Just repeat all lesson or listening\n\nmany times. For example. If you have an audio book, listen to the\n\nfirst chapter 30 times before you go to the second chapter. You could\n\nlisten to the first chapter 3 times each day, for 10 day.\n\n- Rule 5: USE POINT OF VIEW MINI – STORIES TO PERFECT GRAMMAR\n\nYou must learn grammar by listening to real English. The best\n\nway is to listen to the same story... told in different times (points\n\nof view): Past, Perfect, Present, Future.\n\nHow do you do this? Easy! Find a story or article in the\n\npresent tense. Then ask your native speaker tutor to write it again\n\nin the Past, with Perfect tenses, and in the Future. Finally, ask him\n\nto read and record these stories for you.\n\nThen you can listen to stories with many different kinds of\n\ngrammar. You don't need to know the grammar rules. Just listen to\n\nthe Point of View stories and you will improve grammar automatically!\n\nYou can also find Point of View lessons and use them to learn grammar\n\nautomatically. You will use correct grammar naturally and\n\nautomatically.\n\n- Rule 6: ONLY USE REAL ENGLISH LESSONS & MATERIALS\n\nIf you want to understand native speakers, you must stop\n\nlearning English from textbook tapes and CDs. To learn real English,\n\nyou must listen to English that native speakers listen to. You must\n\nwatch what they watch. You must read what they read. Use real\n\nmagazines, audio articles, TV shows, movies, radio talk shows, and\n\naudio books.\n\n- Rule 7: LISTEN AND ANSWER MINI-STORIES (NOT LISTEN AND REPEAT)\n\nIn each Mini-Story Lesson, a teacher asks a short simple story.\n\nIn other words, he creates a story using a lot of questions.\n\nQuestions, questions, questions,.... and more questions! Every\n\nquestion is very easy. Constantly answering these questions QUICKLY\n\ncauses you to think in English.\n\nBecause the teacher constantly and quickly asks easy questions,\n\nyou don't have time to think about grammar. You just immediately shout\n\na couple of words-- which teaches you to respond faster, and faster,\n\nand faster. You learn to answer questions very fast-- without\n\nthinking. Your English becomes automatic. You learn to speak and\n\nrespond quickly and effortlessly.\n\nHow can you use Listen & Answer Stories? Easy! Find a native\n\nspeaker tutor. Ask him to use this method: Ask him to tell a\n\nstory... and to constantly ask you easy questions about it. This will\n\nteach you to think quickly in English!"
