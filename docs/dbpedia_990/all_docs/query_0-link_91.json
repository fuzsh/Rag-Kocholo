This gives everyone everywhere an equal chance of getting on the air, including podcast listeners.\n\nWe consider all of the many calls and messages, and what we don't put on the air, we save to help plan episodes and shape the program.\n\nwords@waywordradio.org\n\nIn the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ and Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, call +1 877 929-9673 toll-free 24/7.\n\nText/SMS to +1 619 800 4443.\n\nSend a voice note or chat message via WhatsApp 16198004443."
