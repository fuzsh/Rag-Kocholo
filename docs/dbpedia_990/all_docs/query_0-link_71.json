        "text": "Learning a new language can seem as daunting a task as performing brain surgery or assembling a jet engine. But it is absolutely doable with the right mindset and proper tools, and the rewards can be significant. With a second (or third) language under your belt, you can earn more money, climb the career ladder, expand your mind, make friends, boost your confidence and improve your chances of getting into grad school.\n\nThere are lots of reasons to learn a new language and many ways to do it, but what’s the best way to learn a language? Truthfully, you won’t know which method is best for you until you start. Read on if you’re ready to start a fun, exciting and challenging new chapter in your life.\n\nWhy Should You Learn a New Language in College?\n\nOne obvious reason to learn a new language is to travel with greater confidence, but the benefits don’t stop there.\n\nCareer Opportunities\n\nDid you know learning another language can lead to a higher salary? Research by Preply found that multilingual employees earn 19% more than those who speak just one language.\n\nPlus, more companies today are hiring multilingual workers, and job seekers whose résumés boast a second or third language are proven to stand out from the crowd. A report from the Language Connects Foundation found that 90% of employers rely on workers to speak languages other than English, and most expect this reliance to grow in the coming years.\n\nKnowing another language can also provide more opportunities in the job you already have, as multilingual employees can help clients and business partners be understood in their native languages.\n\nMental Health and Personal Achievement\n\nThere are more personal reasons to learn a language, as well. It can help keep your mind sharp and improve your understanding and appreciation of music, art and culture. You can read your favorite literary work in its original form, rather than the translated version. And as you progress on your learning journey, you can enjoy the satisfaction of achieving small incremental goals and ultimately, a major milestone.\n\nWhatever your reason for learning a new language, now is an ideal time to do it. Technology has greatly improved instruction methods and allowed for real-time communication among people around the world.\n\nHow To Learn a New Language\n\nThere’s no one right method for learning a new language, and people learn in different ways. But experts consider a few key language learning methods to be the most effective. These include conversations, games, one-on-one tutoring and consuming media in another language.\n\nSpeak Up\n\nHaving conversations with native speakers is an important component of language learning, even at the beginning of the process. Language exchanges provide opportunities to converse in a new language with native speakers, while you help others learn your native language. Many learning programs and apps connect speakers via video chat.\n\nImmersion Therapy\n\nSurrounding yourself with your new language is a common and effective approach to learning. You can reset the language in your cell phone or web browser and use subtitles while watching movies and TV. You can label objects around your house with sticky notes. You can read foreign-language books (children’s books are easiest) and keep a diary in your new language.\n\nImmersion is considered a natural way to place new words and phrases in context and learn functional grammar.\n\nSmall Bites\n\nHaving a clear goal to work toward can help keep learners motivated. Many effective language programs and apps break learning into small lessons, often ranging between 10 and 20 minutes. Bite-sized lessons encourage learners to dedicate a set time and place to studying their new language.\n\nThis approach can help instill good learning habits to help learners push through when motivation starts to wane.\n\nPositive Action\n\nMany learners are held back by a fear of making mistakes, so remember to go easy on yourself. Learning a language is a major project, and whatever path you take, you won’t finish it in a day. Also, remember that different people learn differently, so it might take a few attempts to find a program that works for you.\n\nLanguage Learning Programs To Try\n\nFinding a structured program for learning a new language can help with motivation and discipline.
