That is not something people normally say about a living language like English, but it would make sense for a classical scholar to say:\n\nI know Ancient Greek very well.\n\nbecause Ancient Greek is a language people learn for the sake of having knowledge about the language.\n\nWhen you refer specifically to a rudimentary knowledge of English, it is possible to use “know”:\n\nDoes he know any English?\n\nNo, he knows very little English.\n\nNevertheless, if you speak about any other situation, such as when someone understands a language but doesn’t speak it, it is better to describe the situation in full, i.e. “he understands English but isn’t able to speak it”, instead of using the verb “know”."
