        "text": "Before heading to Austria, Germany, Slovenia, and Croatia this summer, I wanted to get at least a little understanding of the languages. I focused primarily on German, as that’s what’s spoken in Austria and Germany, where we were spending the bulk of our time. My mom had heard about an app at her library called Mango Languages. Mango Languages aims to prepare learners for realistic conversations and strengthen their everyday communication skills. This review of Mango Languages covers how well that went!\n\nLearning German for Free\n\nMango Languages offers the ability to learn over 70 world languages. The best part, it was FREE with my library card! So I recommend you check with your local library if they have this available for you as well. If they don’t, you can still sign up for Mango through a subscription plan which has a two-week free trial.\n\nI started with the Mango Languages app about three months before I left. The software is available on desktop, but I used the app. It was incredibly helpful for someone like myself who’s learning German as a beginner.\n\nIt didn’t try to teach me phrases like “the boy is running” or “the donkey ate the carrot.” They aren’t phrases I would use on a fourteen-day trip. Instead, they teach you practical examples like “Are you from around here?” or “Excuse me, do you have the time?”\n\n70+ World Languages and Dialects\n\nThrough the use of building blocks, Mango Languages helps to increase your proficiency. Each lesson breaks down full sentences into digestible pieces. Gradually helping to build sentences as well as reinforce the language and vocabulary. With new words being introduced with each section.\n\nThis really helped me understand the language rather than regurgitating some memorized sentences. By the time we left, I was also able to piece together some sentences myself.\n\nLanguage Lessons Online\n\nOne of the best things about Mango Languages was the Voice Comparison feature. I could practice pronouncing words and see if they matched their native-speaker recordings. Another feature is their Memory-Building exercises, which help review and retain the material learned.\n\nThey also show you the Understood & Literal Meanings. Direct translations don’t always convey the meaning of a word or phrase, which is why it’s important to recognize understood versus literal meanings. Finally, Semantic Color Mapping helps to show the relationship between the target language and the native language, illustrating the structure and mechanics.\n\nA review of mango languages\n\nBeing able to have German lessons online instead of in class was supremely useful. I won’t say I was fluent by the time I flew to Austria. But I had the basics down well enough for me to get around and say the pleasantries. I completed only the first two chapters and then skipped around a bit to sections like ‘Getting Around’ and ‘At the Restaurant.’\n\nI highly recommend Mango Languages for anyone wanting to learn a new language. Give it a try, even if you aren’t visiting a new country anytime soon. And do check if your library has a free subscription!"
