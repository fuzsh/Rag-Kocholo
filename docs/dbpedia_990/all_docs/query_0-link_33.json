In addition, we also have an American Sign Language (ASL)/English dual language program at the Horace Mann School for the Deaf. Most recently, BPS has added dual language programs in Vietnamese/English at Âu Cơ Preschool and the Mather Elementary School.\n\nAre dual language programs the same as two-way immersion programs?\n\nYes, dual language programs as defined in BPS are also known as two-way immersion programs.\n\nAre there any recommendations to enroll my child in a dual language program?\n\nIt is recommended that students enter the dual language programs at K0-K2. The child must be proficient in either English or the target language of the program (for the Haitian Creole, Spanish, and Vietnamese dual language programs). In some cases, a new student who has proficiency in the target language (Haitian Creole, Spanish, or Vietnamese) may be enrolled into a DLP beyond grade 1.\n\nEnrollment in the ASL Dual Language program at the Horace Mann School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing is available for students who are deaf or hard of hearing and does not require proficiency in ASL or English.\n\nConsult your local dual language program school for details and enrollment procedures."
