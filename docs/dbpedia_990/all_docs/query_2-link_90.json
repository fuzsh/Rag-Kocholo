        "text": "Writing a novel that includes multiple languages can be a great way to add depth and complexity to your story and characterization. But it can also be tricky to get right.\n\nFor instance, how do you make sure your readers can understand what’s being said in another language without taking away from the authenticity of the story and characters?\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore some ways to include foreign language dialogue in your novel and some things to avoid.\n\nAuto-Translate for the Reader\n\nYou can keep the dialogue within quotation marks, write it in Language A, and add, “they said in Language B.”\n\nThis lets your reader (who might not speak Language B) know that the dialogue just spoken was in another language, while still allowing the reader to know what was said.\n\nThis allows you to auto-translate different languages for the reader. You can think of this method as offering subtitles or dubbing to your reader on the page.\n\nNarrate Foreign Language Dialogue\n\nYou could also narrate the foreign language dialogue rather than have it in quotation marks.\n\nInstead of writing out the dialogue of Language B within quotation marks, you could narrate for the reader what is being said in another language.\n\nThis also helps translate for the reader what is being said while still letting them know another language is being spoken.\n\nWrite Foreign Language Dialogue in the Foreign Language\n\nYou could write dialogue in the foreign language being used. If you don’t speak the other language yourself, you might need some help to make sure you get it right.\n\nBut this is also a great idea!\n\nYou could even provide a translation of the foreign language dialogue in the character’s narrative thoughts if you want to make sure the reader still understands.\n\nWhen to Not Provide a Translation\n\nYou might not want to provide a translation of any kind if the main character is supposed to be unable to understand the language being spoken.\n\nIn this case, you might want your reader to experience not understanding what’s being said alongside the main character.\n\nSo instead of translating for the reader in some way, you want to avoid putting any dialogue in quotation marks, and instead narrate that a foreign language the character doesn’t understand is being spoken. The narrating character might notice other things, like body language, facial expressions, or hand gestures instead.\n\nThis will keep your reader in the dark alongside your main character if this is a crucial part of your plot.\n\nIncluding the foreign language dialogue written in the foreign language wouldn’t help in this case, because your reader might understand the foreign language. Then, your reader will know crucial plot information you might want to keep hidden for now.\n\nAlternatively, writing the foreign language dialogue in the foreign language can be a great way to give your reader information the main character doesn’t have. This can increase suspense and even encourage readers to learn a bit about a different language.\n\nWrite Foreign Language Dialogue Fluently\n\nForeign languages only sound “foreign” to those who don’t speak or understand the language. Remember this whenever you are dealing with multiple languages in dialogue.\n\nFor example, if you are writing a book in Language A, but there are characters in the story who speak Language B in some of the dialogue, then there are a few things you want to avoid.\n\nIn my experience as a manuscript copyeditor, I sometimes come across this problem when editing foreign language dialogue:\n\nAn author will want to write the dialogue in Language A, so that the reader understands, but the language actually being spoken is Language B.\n\nSo far, we’re all good.\n\nBut then, to note that a different language is being spoken, the author will write as if the person is speaking a broken, heavily accented version of Language A.\n\nIf a character is speaking Language A, but Language B is their first language, then this could make sense.\n\nBut if the dialogue is supposedly being spoken in Language B, and is just being auto-translated to the reader in Language A, write as if the character is speaking Language A fluently.\n\nIf the character is speaking the language fluently, then write their dialogue fluently as well.\n\nAvoid Using Speech Characteristics to Perpetuate Stereotypes\n\nSomeone has a certain dialect or accent because of where they’re from, not due to their personality. Likewise, some speech characteristics can be a factor of someone’s physical body rather than their personality.\n\nSometimes authors are tempted to use a dialect, accent, or other speech characteristics that they attribute to a certain personality trait to characterize their characters.\n\nNext time you are writing a character’s dialogue, think about how you write the way they talk and look for any personal assumptions (subconscious or otherwise) that might be leaking through your dialogue writing choices.\n\nAvoid using speech characteristics to perpetuate stereotypes about those dialects or accents. If your character speaks with a certain accent or dialect, make sure it’s because of where they are from, and not to use a speech stereotype for characterization.\n\nDon’t let speech characteristics in your dialogue happen by accident. Instead,\n\nBe purposeful and thoughtful behind all the speech traits you give your characters.\n\nTake an extra-long look at any and all speech characteristics and the whys behind them. How does each character speak and why?\n\nWhatever speech characteristics you choose to use, make sure they are purposefully portraying something important, and not just a stereotype that has been used to death.\n\nWhat are some other tips for including other languages in your novel?
