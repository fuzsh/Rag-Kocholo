Don't forget to prepare yourself.\n\nIt's correct, you can use \"by the way\" both at the beginning and at the end of the sentence:\n\nBy the way, there's an exam tomorrow.\n\nThere's an exam tomorrow, by the way.\n\nIn more formal texts you'd typically separate it with a comma, in chat/text lingo it's often omitted, especially if you're abbreviating:\n\n?btw there's an exam tomorrow\n\n?there's an exam tomorrow btw\n\nanswered Aug 2, 2019 at 9:50\n\nMaciej StachowskiMaciej Stachowski\n\n10.3k11 gold badge2525 silver badges3333 bronze badges"
