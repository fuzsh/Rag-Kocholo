Hearing the voices of loved ones from afar, sharing life-saving information and life-affirming stories, words have helped communities stay bonded, children educated, colleagues engaged and people safe. We are proud that our words help keep people connected.\n\nSince 1946, the UN family has recognized the importance of harmonious communication by prioritizing multilingualism. By promoting tolerance, multilingualism ensures fruitful and greater participation of the UN country teams work worldwide.\n\nArabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish are the six official languages of the United Nations.\n\nToday, we are happy to announce that the UNSDG global website is now available in these six languages. Now, under this one umbrella, the UNSDG website can share more results, more achievements and more voices. Making the site available in six languages will give our readers more access to blogs, announcements, stories, research documents and much more in more languages than ever before. The addition of these three new sites increases the transparency and accountability of the UN by making this information available to as many communities as possible.\n\nThe UNSDG is aiming to lead the way in multilingualism. This launch is a step towards this direction.\n\nMore stories, one voice\n\nThe new fully multilingual site is an invitation for greater collaboration and partnership with UN country teams across the globe, as well as a more holistic means of communicating with one voice.\n\nUN country teams work tirelessly worldwide to support countries in the achievement of the 2030 Agenda. As part of the teams, agencies, funds and programmes work jointly together to ensure people across the world are living healthy, secure and fulfilling lives.\n\n“United” is not just part of the name of the United Nations, it’s part of our very purpose. At the UN, nations and peoples work together for a better today — and tomorrow.\n\nWe encourage you to visit UNSDG.UN.org in French, Spanish, and now in Arabic, Chinese, and Russian."
