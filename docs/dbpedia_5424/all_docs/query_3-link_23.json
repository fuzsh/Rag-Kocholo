        "meta_description": "The boy wonder who became the great, wandering titan of international cinema, writer-director-actor and all-around force of nature Orson Welles began his filmmaking career with some of the most dazzling and innovative opuses ever made within the Hollywood studio system—but his vision was always too iconoclastic, too grand to be constrained by the limitations of commercial moviemaking. Roaming the world—from South America to Europe—in search of the financial and artistic freedom to realize his often quixotic ambitions, Welles let his boundless visual imagination run riot in defiantly personal dream projects like the byzantine thriller MR. ARKADIN, the monumental Shakespeare adaptation CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT, and the trickster meta-documentary F FOR FAKE. Relentlessly fascinated by questions of free will, human fallibility, and the line between illusion and truth, many of Welles’s lofty, brilliant films have, like the man himself, passed into the realm of myth.",
