        "text": "In early 1970, director Orson Welles returned to Hollywood after more than a decade in Europe, and later that year he began work on his innovative comeback movie—The Other Side of the Wind.\n\nThe movie was the story of a legendary director named Jake Hannaford, who returns to Hollywood from years of semi-exile in Europe with plans to complete work on his own innovative comeback movie—also entitled The Other Side of the Wind.\n\nWelles said it wasn’t autobiographical.\n\nThe story line of The Other Side of the Wind was supposed to take place during a single day. At one point, Welles intended to shoot it in eight weeks. Instead, it took six years, and the film remains unfinished nearly four decades later.\n\nBased on a script Welles revised nightly, the film was financed principally by the Shah of Iran’s brother-in-law and offered possibly one last shot at topping Citizen Kane. The making of The Other Side of the Wind began as a tale of art imitating life, but ultimately morphed into life imitating art, on a set where it sometimes became difficult to tell the difference between the movie and real life.\n\nDuring production many people asked Welles what his movie was all about. To his star, John Huston, he once replied, “It’s a film about a bastard director…. It’s about us, John. It’s a film about us.”\n\nThe answer, however, was different one evening when comedian Rich Little, who was also in the cast, found Welles propped up in bed, making script revisions.\n\n“Orson,” Little asked, “what does The Other Side of the Wind mean?”\n\nLooking down over his reading glasses, Welles, in his rich baritone, said, “I haven’t the foggiest.”\n\n1970\n\nThe story behind the making of The Other Side of the Wind begins at Schwab’s drugstore, the Hollywood soda fountain where: Charlie Chaplin played pinball, F. Scott Fitzgerald had his first heart attack, and, according to some versions of the story, Lana Turner was discovered while cutting school to grab a Coke.\n\nOn July 3, 1970, a young, unknown cameraman named Gary Graver stopped for coffee at Schwab’s and picked up Variety, where he read news of Laurence Harvey’s fractured knee, Patty Duke’s honeymoon, and then this: “Orson Welles, looking very well, visiting friends here and in San Fran, says he soon returns to film his yarn, ‘The Other Side of the Wind’ … ”\n\nThough he’d learned camerawork in a naval film unit during the Vietnam War and earned his living on low-budget movies, Graver had said if there was one director he’d always wanted to work for it was Orson Welles.\n\nOn a hunch, as Graver later recalled to film critic Joseph McBride, for his book What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?, he walked to the pay phone and called the Beverly Hills Hotel.\n\n“Orson Welles, please,” he told the hotel operator.\n\nThe line began to ring. And then—that voice.\n\n“Hello,” rumbled a man who was unmistakably Orson Welles.\n\n“Uh, Orson Welles?,” Graver stammered.\n\n“Yes,” Welles said. “Who is this?”\n\n“My name’s Gary Graver,” he said. “I’m an American cameraman and I know you have some projects. I’d sure like to be involved with you as a cinematographer.”\n\nOrson brushed him off, explaining that he was headed to the airport.\n\n“Give me your name and your phone number,” Welles said.\n\nGraver gave them to him, but knew he’d blown it. Somewhere at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Welles was surely not writing down his number.\n\nAfter he hung up, a dejected Graver left Schwab’s and went home.\n\nAs he pulled into his driveway in Laurel Canyon, the phone was ringing. He ran. It was Orson.\n\n“Get on over here to the Beverly Hills Hotel,” Welles said. “I’ve got to talk to you right away!”\n\nPropelled by Orson’s undeniable force, Graver sped to the hotel and was soon standing at a bungalow door, face-to-face with Orson Welles, clad in a black silk bathrobe.\n\nOffering Graver coffee and a seat, Welles settled on the edge of a bed, and they chatted for a while before Orson said that he was working on a new movie called The Other Side of the Wind and wanted Gary to work with him.\n\n“You are the second cameraman to call me up and say you wanted to work with me,” Welles explained. “First there was Gregg Toland, who shot Citizen Kane … ” and now there was Gary Graver, who was absorbing that information when—suddenly—Welles grabbed him by the shoulders and tossed him to the floor. Moments later, Orson crashed beside him and threw a beefy arm over Graver’s back to pin him down.\n\nUnable to move, Graver began to wonder if maybe this hadn’t been such a great idea. But then—after what seemed like forever—Welles slowly crept to the window and peered over the sill. He stood up and then helped Graver to his feet.\n\n“I saw the actress Ruth Gordon out there,” Orson began to explain. “If she’d seen me, she’d have come in here and talked, talked, talked.” But Orson didn’t want to talk to Ruth Gordon. “Right now,” he told Graver, “I want to talk to you.”\n\nFrom that day forward, Orson Welles was the central figure in Gary Graver’s life: more important than his wife, his children, his bank account, and his health.\n\nFor the rest of Orson’s life (and his own), Graver belonged to the great director. And he also belonged to The Other Side of the Wind.\n\nThe initial inspiration for The Other Side of the Wind can be traced back to an event that took place more than 30 years before Graver walked into Schwab’s that summer day and found Orson in the pages of Variety.\n\nIt was May 1937 and Welles entered a Manhattan recording studio to narrate a Spanish Civil War documentary whose script had been written by Ernest Hemingway—who happened to be in the sound booth when Orson arrived.\n\nOnly 22, Orson was not yet the Orson Welles, but he was on his way as a talented voice actor earning $1,000 a week during the Depression and a Broadway wunderkind who’d had the audacity to stage an all-black Macbeth.\n\nLooking at Hemingway’s script, Welles suggested a few changes, as he recalled to a reporter decades later. Wouldn’t it be better, for instance, to eliminate the line “Here are the faces of men who are close to death,” and simply let those faces speak for themselves?\n\nHemingway was outraged that anyone would dare tamper with his words and went after Orson, implying that the actor was “some kind of faggot.” Welles responded by hitting Hemingway the best way he knew how. If Papa wanted a faggot, Orson would give him one.\n\n“Mr. Hemingway, how strong you are!” Welles said, camping it up with a swishy lisp. “How big you are!”\n\nGrabbing a chair, Hemingway attacked Orson, who picked up a chair of his own, sparking a cinematic brawl between two of the great creative geniuses of the 20th century, who duked it out while images of war flickered on a screen behind them.\n\nEventually, however, the pair realized the insanity of their fight and soon slumped to the floor laughing, cracked open a bottle of whiskey, and drank their way into friendship.\n\nTwenty years after this encounter, Welles would work on a screenplay about a hyper-manly, middle-aged, American novelist living in Spain who has lost his creative powers and become obsessed with a young bullfighter in whom he sees the promise of youth and perhaps something more. Meanwhile, a Greek chorus of sycophantic biographers, worshipful grad students, and literary critics trailed the writer, reminding him of his own greatness.\n\nSometime after Hemingway killed himself, on July 2, 1961, Welles changed the locus of the film to Hollywood and turned the novelist into a sadistic man’s-man filmmaker who may also be a closeted homosexual. He decided that all of the action would take place on a single day—July 2—which became his main character’s birthday and the last day of his life.\n\nPitching the movie to a group of admirers in 1966, Welles also explained that he was going to take a unique approach to filming a story for which he’d written several scripts and, as he’d say later, had enough material to fill a “three-volume novel.”\n\n“We’re going to shoot it without a script,” he said, his face lighting up with excitement. “I know the whole story…. But what I’m going to do is get the actors in every situation, tell them what has happened up to this moment … and I believe they will find what is true and inevitable.”\n\n“Have you done that kind of thing before with other films?” one man asked.\n\n“Nobody’s ever done it,” Welles replied.\n\nWelles also planned to make two films and fuse them into one. First, there was Hannaford’s movie, which he conceived as an old man’s failed attempt to make an arty, sexy, symbolic picture aimed at the younger audiences of New Hollywood. Beautiful, but without a plot or any sense of purpose, the film was Orson’s way of taking a shot at Blow-Up director Michelangelo Antonioni, whom he once referred to as “an architect of empty boxes.” The footage from this film within the film would be shown to producers and party guests during the other movie Orson was making.\n\nThat other film was the story of Hannaford’s 70th-birthday party, which is being thrown by a famous golden-era actress (modeled on Orson’s friend Marlene Dietrich) as a way of introducing the denizens of New Hollywood to an old master and in hopes that one of them will fund his comeback movie.\n\nIn stark contrast to Hannaford’s film, Welles was determined to shoot this portion of the picture (the movie’s actual story line) in a multi-layered, documentary style comprising footage from still, 16-mm., Super 8, and other cameras—all of which he would knit together to form a fractured picture of Hannaford on the last day of his life.\n\nBeginning in August 1970 and continuing into December, Welles filmed portions of The Other Side of the Wind, despite the fact that he had yet to cast anyone as Hannaford. Standing in for the main character whenever needed, Orson had his small, young crew shoot around Hannaford, sometimes filming one half of a scene that would be finished several years later on a different continent.\n\nThe first day of shooting took place on August 23, 1970, at Orson’s rented home in Beverly Hills, where critic Joe McBride (whom Welles had met the day before) and critic turned director Peter Bogdanovich (a Welles protégé) played a pair of critics who bicker about film at Hannaford’s party. Both characters, Welles explained, were writing books about Hannaford. In real life, McBride and Bogdanovich were each at work on books about Orson.\n\nWearing a white robe, smoking a big Cuban cigar, and drinking one of the countless Frescas he downed each day, Welles had the pair develop their own film-nerd dialogue, some of it inspired by McBride’s theory that John Ford’s movies were “an oblique reflection of the changes in American society.”\n\nBatting it back and forth, McBride and Welles reshaped the theory and went to a typewriter, where Welles punched out a preposterously cinéastic monologue which contends that “during the thirties Hannaford’s predominant motif was the outsider in absurd conflict with society. In the forties he achieved salvation. In the fifties … ”\n\nThe next day, Welles sent Graver off to Utah to scout locations. When he returned, they resumed shooting and didn’t stop until Christmas.\n\n“We never had a budget,” Graver said. “We just started filming. What I didn’t fully understand was … that Orson worked seven-day weeks, every single day.”\n\n“He just loved the filmmaking process more than anyone I’ve ever met,” said crew member Michael Stringer. “His vision was what everyone else was focusing on—and that’s an intoxicating process.”\n\nIntoxicating, yes, but it wasn’t for everyone. If you had thin skin or defied Orson, you disappeared quickly or were eaten alive. As a result, there was an extremely high daily turnover rate during the first several months of shooting.\n\nBut there were those like Graver, Stringer, and other stalwarts who later called themselves VISTOW (Volunteers in Service to Orson Welles). They weren’t there for money or recognition, both of which were in very short supply. Nor did they care about the unsafe, sometimes illegal working conditions. Instead, only one thing mattered: helping Orson make the movie he wanted to make.\n\nThis meant submitting completely to Orson’s demands and never, ever, saying no. And in return you were lifted up, like a sideman playing with Charlie Parker or a spot-up shooter flanking Michael Jordan.\n\nOrson would stalk the set, looking through a circle made with his fingers and explaining precisely which lens and focal length he wanted. Without ever peering through a camera, he always seemed to know which image would be captured, and those who did as they were told wound up doing the best camerawork of their lives.\n\nConceptually, it seemed, Orson used each frame of film as an easel on which he was creating individual works of art that he would then string together in a way that multiplied their impact.\n\n“The concepts Orson had for shots were utterly astounding,” said crew member Eric Sherman. “And each shot had something to do with the larger creation.”\n\nBut still, there were times when even Orson was overwhelmed by executing his own vision, once waving off Graver’s idea for capturing an image they’d tried to shoot over and over.\n\n“No, Gary,” Welles said. “God doesn’t want me to make this shot.”\n\nIn the fall of 1970, Orson shot Hannaford’s movie in Century City and on the crumbling back lot at MGM, two places where he could film on the cheap and with little interference.\n\nStill in its infancy, Century City was nothing more than a few mirrored buildings and lots of construction dirt when Welles arrived. He transformed it into a neo-futuristic landscape by putting large mirrors on rolling platforms, then positioning them in ways that turned the reflections of the existing buildings into a strange world that existed nowhere but in his own mind and then on celluloid.\n\nSecuring a permit for Gary Graver Productions, Welles skirted additional fees by having Graver erase the date each time it expired and enter a new one. By Christmas, they’d rubbed a hole right through the permit.\n\nSince Hannaford’s film was supposed to be beautifully composed, faux-symbolic nonsense, Welles ran wild in Century City, conceiving visuals and then taking them to extremes. With no sound and Orson directing him on the fly, actor Bob Random (who played the lead in Hannaford’s film-within-the-film) recalled, the experience was like “a silent movie, except you never knew what you were going to do.”\n\nDuring this period, Welles also fell in love with the idea of creating his own wind and had the crew load a Ritter fan (an airplane propeller on a giant motor) onto a truck and haul it around to various locations, where Random would drive his motorcycle into a blistering dust storm they’d manufactured or spend half a day walking into a blizzard of garbage that crew members were tossing into the fan.\n\nGraver was able to rent the MGM back lot for $200 a day by having the crew pose as U.C.L.A. film students and making Orson duck whenever they drove past the security gate. Once inside, Welles filmed on half-demolished Western sets where tumbleweeds blew across the street, and shot as much footage as humanly possible, culminating in a final, 72-hour filming spree that took place over a three-day weekend.\n\nEven more free-form than the Century City shoot, filming at MGM heightened Orson’s frustration over glitches, and he seemed to make up for lack of inspiration with rants about “losing the light” which included a notable outburst that took place when someone was sent for dinner for the crew and returned with wrapped plates of food and plastic utensils.\n\n“I wanted sandwiches!,” Orson screamed as the light dissipated behind him. “So they could eat with one hand!”\n\nWhat seemed like madness, however, was tempered by the knowledge that Welles was carrying the entire film in his head.\n\n“He knew exactly what he needed,” said cameraman Leslie Otis.\n\nDennis Hopper arrived at Orson’s home one night in November 1970 to play a director much like himself who is being interviewed during a power outage at Hannaford’s party.\n\n“Where’s the lighting?,” Hopper asked Welles when he saw that everything was illuminated by kerosene lamps.\n\n“This is it,” Welles replied.\n\n“That’s cool, man,” Hopper said.\n\nHaving recently completed shooting his strange, cocaine-fueled directorial disaster, The Last Movie, the clearly stoned Hopper sat down by a fire and rambled, on-camera, about the F.B.I. visiting his house, getting John Wayne fans to see his films, and the idea of the “God-director,” which he describes as a “very dangerous area.”\n\nDuring the scene, however, Hopper also unintentionally lands on the great unspoken theme of Orson’s movie and his life. Everything, Hopper said, “becomes a movie in front of that camera.”\n\nThat evening, Welles also shot an explosive conversation between directors Paul Mazursky and Henry Jaglom, who weren’t getting along at the time. Plying Mazursky with brandy and cigars, Welles filmed the pair for hours while they became more and more agitated with each other as Jaglom (instructed beforehand by Welles) accuses Mazursky (whose first film, Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice, had been a surprise hit) of being a sellout, before launching an all-out attack on Hannaford, played by Orson off-camera.\n\nThe next morning Mazursky awoke and realized he had no idea how he’d gotten home, but remembered that he’d had a wonderful time shooting scenes for Welles, who called him later that day.\n\n“Now I have a film,” Welles said. “You’re the greatest improviser I’ve ever seen. Unlike Dennis Hopper. He can’t improvise.”\n\nMazursky told Welles that it had been an honor to work with him and he hoped that they could get together sometime to talk about filmmaking. Orson said that he’d love to and promised to be in touch once he’d finished The Other Side of the Wind.\n\nPaul Mazursky never heard from Welles again.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1973, Welles followed a pattern of working on other people’s projects—movies, television shows, and lucrative advertising work for a fee reportedly in excess of $10,000 a day—and then resuming production when he’d earned sufficient money to continue.\n\nAmong those projects was a 1972 film version of Treasure Island, in which he took the role of Long John Silver for a salary of $150,000. During that project, Welles met a young European producer who became a partner on The Other Side of the Wind and allegedly agreed to put $150,000 into the film while helping to secure additional funding from German investors.\n\nBut the most significant development was Orson’s partnership with Les Films de l’Astrophore, a Paris-based production company under the direction of the Shah of Iran’s brother-in-law, a deeply cultured man named Dr. Mehdi Boushehri. Launched as part of the Shah’s modernization plan and an attempt to form lucrative partnerships with famous directors from the West, Astrophore initially invested $150,000, giving Orson a nice war chest with which to resume shooting the film in January 1974.\n\n1974\n\n‘You’ve been in this picture for three years?” an incredulous John Huston asked Joe McBride when they met at the house Orson was renting in Carefree, Arizona, in early 1974.\n\nFinally hired at the end of 1973 to play Hannaford, Huston had made three movies since Welles had begun shooting The Other Side of the Wind and was about to start working on The Man Who Would Be King.\n\nLongtime friends, Welles and Huston were similar men (great artists who were rebellious by nature and horrible with money) who had had divergent careers. Each made his first film in 1941, and both movies became classics (Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon), but since that time, Welles had completed fewer than a dozen features, while Huston had finished nearly 30.\n\nThe difference, it seemed, was that Huston could walk away from a film when it was done—rather than when it was perfect. He also cut his films in the camera, learned to work the system, and was willing to trade directing a few decent films for the chance to make a classic.\n\nBut, more than anything, Huston succeeded because he had the air of a man who valued the adventure of filmmaking as much as, if not more than, the final product—something embodied by the unifying theme of his work, once described as “an adventure shared by desperate men that finally came to nothing.”\n\nHe found just such an adventure in Carefree, where Welles was living and shooting in an architecturally significant home that he’d rented from a wealthy New Jersey family under the pretense that he would be sitting quietly by the pool and writing his memoirs. Shortly thereafter, he turned their vacation house into a film set.\n\nWhen Huston arrived, Welles introduced him to comedian Rich Little, whom he’d hired to play Hannaford’s protégé, Brooks Otterlake, a critic turned hot young director who loves to do celebrity impressions—much like Bogdanovich.\n\n“John, I want you to meet Rich Little,” Welles told Huston, according to Peter Tonguette’s book Orson Welles Remembered. “He’s probably the world’s greatest impressionist.”\n\n“Oh, well then, we’re going to get along fine,” Huston replied. “I have a lot of paintings and that’s one of my hobbies and we’ll have many great discussions. I’m thrilled.”\n\n“No,” Orson screamed. “Not that kind of impressionist!”\n\nOn the set, however, Welles handled his old friend with enormous delicacy, knowing that the film would turn not only on Huston’s performance but also on his own ability to extract the sense of loneliness that lay beneath the 67-year-old director’s courtly swashbuckler persona.\n\nThus, despite the fact that Welles arrived on the set each day (now in a purple robe) toting a huge script and new pages of dialogue he’d written the night before, Orson told Huston not to memorize his lines. Instead, Welles said, “the idea is all that matters,” and he trusted Huston to embody Hannaford when the cameras rolled, something that seemed to work quite well, except on the occasions when his lead actor got lost or forgot the purpose of a scene.\n\nIn those situations, Bogdanovich recalled in a 2007 interview, Huston tended to say something—anything—with enormous authority before exiting with great confidence. Meaning that when the line might be “I’m going to talk to Billy about that,” Huston would say, “We’ll set it up for Tuesday. I’m going to the kitchen,” and then walk off, leaving a bewildered scene partner alone in the frame.\n\nWhen Orson would finally yell “Cut!,” Huston would re-enter and innocently ask, “Was that the line?”\n\n“Well, not exactly,” Welles would say, laughing. “I dunno what the hell you just said.”\n\nOn the day that Huston had to shoot a drunken, self-loathing monologue into a bathroom mirror, Welles treated him with the kind of care reserved for a young actress filming her first nude scene. Closing the set, he assembled only essential members of the crew to film the sequence.\n\nHaving encouraged Huston to drink throughout the day, Welles wanted a sense of both fragility and power, which he squeezed out of Huston by filming the scene 14 times (from the top, middle, and bottom) before they nailed it.\n\n“That’s the one, John,” Welles said.\n\n“That’s the only one,” Huston responded.\n\nBut after his emotionally and physically depleted lead actor left, Welles said, “Print them all,” knowing there were great moments in each take that he could edit together to create a scene of even greater depth and impact than the one Huston had executed perfectly.\n\nTo the crew filming in Arizona, Orson was like the Wizard of Oz, by turns a gigantic omnipotent force who infused the set with electricity the moment he arrived, and also a mere mortal, prone to outbursts of childish emotion when things didn’t go his way.\n\n“One minute you’d feel this whirlwind of power,” said crew member Constance Pharr. “And then there were moments when he pouted like a two-year-old.”\n\nThough he was frequently self-aware and sometimes gave meta-commentary on his own tirades (“You need to do this … We need to change the lighting … And for God’s sake we need to get Orson to shut up … ”), Welles felt entitled to his dark humors, particularly in moments of creative impotence while the crew sat for hours waiting for him to find inspiration.\n\nActress Susan Strasberg, who played a film critic based on Pauline Kael, recalled an incident when a crew member asked him where to place a camera. “Idiot,” Welles bellowed, “can’t you see I haven’t the foggiest notion of what I want? I wouldn’t be sitting here if I did.”\n\nBecause he was so demanding, Welles also created a sense of frenzied chaos on the set that had everyone so busy scurrying around to please him that a production assistant ran through a sliding glass door while trying to fulfill one of Orson’s requests.\n\nDespite the craziness, however, the atmosphere was exhilarating, and there were certain crew members who wouldn’t desert Orson even after being fired, something that happened on a regular basis to line producer Frank Marshall.\n\nEach time Orson told him to leave, Marshall would simply go to his room at the nearby Desert Forest Motel, get on the phone, and talk someone through his job until Welles summoned him back.\n\nOnce, having replaced Marshall with actor Peter Jason, Welles demanded, “Nineteen hippies! I want beards on them! And I need them today!”\n\nJason immediately called Marshall, who sent him to Arizona State University, where he could round up students with the offer of free hot dogs, beer, and a chance to meet Rich Little.\n\nThen, however, they needed a generator, and Jason told Orson he had no idea how to get one.\n\n“Well! Who does!?,” Welles screamed.\n\n“Frank,” Jason told him.\n\n“He’s in Hollywood!,” Orson replied.\n\nJason then explained that Marshall could be there in five minutes, and Orson immediately roared, “Well! Get him back here!”\n\nWhen Marshall returned, Welles didn’t apologize. Instead, he said, “Frank, what we need is a generator, and we need it in … ” Marshall, however, understood. He knew Orson needed him, which is why he never left.\n\nBy March 1974 they’d made serious progress, but there was also confusion, since almost nobody seemed to understand the plot beyond their own role. Huston knew more than others, but every scene seemed to exist primarily in Orson’s head. And there were even days when Welles seemed confused by what he was filming and why he was filming it.\n\nHad that not been enough, Welles faced a massive crisis when Rich Little was fired (according to some) or, as the comedian tells it, simply left the set in order to fulfill several sold-out, scheduled stand-up gigs that Orson had known about when he’d hired Little.\n\nEither way, Frank Marshall says, Little was suddenly gone. Finding himself left with a mountain of useless footage, Welles went into a tailspin, and everything shut down. Then, however, Orson gathered his energy, refocused, and moved forward.\n\n“Orson used it as a way to start over,” Marshall said.\n\nIn order to do that he needed a new Otterlake, which he found in the form of the man who’d inspired the character in the first place: Peter Bogdanovich. Though now an important director, with three consecutive hit movies (The Last Picture Show, What’s Up, Doc?, and Paper Moon), the brash, confident Bogdanovich still worshipped Welles, and they frequently spoke on the phone at lunchtime—calls during which Orson had no problem letting others hear how cruelly dismissive he could be to his protégé. Welles demonstrated this one day when Bogdanovich sought his advice on an upcoming film and Orson suggested that he “shoot it in black and white,” echoing guidance he’d given him on The Last Picture Show. Hanging up the phone, Welles turned to the crew and exploded into laughter, “Black and white!”\n\nBut on March 13 the tone was different as Orson explained his situation and Bogdanovich immediately offered to take on the role of Otterlake.\n\n“That never occurred to me,” Welles said.\n\n“The guy’s a young film director who’s had three hits and he does impressions all the time—and it never occurred to you?” Bogdanovich asked.\n\nWhen Orson mentioned that Bogdanovich (who later recounted the conversation for Bright Lights Film Journal) was already playing one of the critics, the young director said they could just re-shoot those scenes with someone else.\n\n“My God,” Orson replied. “Of course you could do it. You’d be great for it. My God, will you? You just saved my life.”\n\nArriving the next day, Bogdanovich added a strange new element to the set, where everyone knew that Orson had cast the person on whom the character was based.\n\n“When Peter came in to play Peter, it was bizarre,” Marshall said.\n\nIt was more than bizarre. It was so surreal that you couldn’t make it up.\n\nToward the end of March, Huston got behind the wheel of a convertible to film a scene in which Hannaford drives to his birthday party. Bogdanovich sat next to him in the front, while Orson and Graver squeezed in the back with cameras and strapped another one to the side of the car.\n\n“Don’t worry,” Welles assured crew member Larry Jackson, who was lying on the trunk and holding a boom mike. “We won’t even be going that fast.”\n\nBefore the cameras began to roll, Huston confessed that he’d long ago concluded that drinking and driving didn’t mix, so he’d decided to choose one or the other. Drinking won and for decades he’d barely been behind the wheel. He was, however, willing to give it a shot.\n\nUndeterred, Orson yelled “Action!,” and Huston (who’d already consumed a fair amount of vodka that day) swerved onto the road—and promptly drove the wrong way up a highway exit ramp, which sent them directly into oncoming traffic while Jackson clung to the trunk thinking, The obituary won’t even mention that I was here.\n\nWith the cameras rolling and everyone shrieking in terror, Huston swerved around the oncoming cars until he saw an opening and jumped the median, calmly joining the flow of traffic on the other side.\n\nWhen they got off the highway, Huston pulled over, and Welles emitted a gigantic sigh.\n\n“Thanks, John,” he said. “That’ll do.”\n\nThe Arizona shoot didn’t end well. Beset by financial problems and with the supply of funds seeming to dwindle, Welles suddenly found himself without money. Soon there were allegations that someone had been stealing from the production account.\n\nOrson returned to Los Angeles and continued filming that spring before heading to Paris, where he spent the summer and fall editing the picture. While he was there, tension began mounting between Welles and his editing crew. He’d also grown mistrustful of Boushehri’s Astrophore (now his sole partner after rescuing him from the situation in Arizona and providing new funding for the film) and feared they were going to seize creative control of his picture—as others had done in the past.\n\nToward the end of 1974, the editing crew arrived one morning to find that the film was gone. Not long afterward, the producers discovered that Orson had taken it to Rome, where he was editing clips that he intended to show at an American Film Institute Life Achievement Award ceremony in his honor early the next year. Welles believed the event would be his salvation, and planned to use it as a showcase for The Other Side of the Wind and a way to fund its completion.\n\n1975\n\nThe beginning of the end came when a small committee from A.F.I. met at the Beverly Hills Hotel to choose the recipient of its third Life Achievement Award. Options included everyone in Hollywood who wasn’t named John Ford or Jimmy Cagney (the first two recipients). The group chose Welles because it considered him a superlative artist and wanted to make a statement about the organization.\n\n“We made the choice on the grounds that it was a choice of great integrity,” said A.F.I. founding director George Stevens Jr. “It was a way of saying we were serious about this award and that it wasn’t going to be a popularity contest.”\n\nA popularity contest it was not, as there was negative feedback from several A.F.I. members, some factions of the Hollywood press, director Henry Hathaway, and Kirk Douglas, who, according to Stevens, was outraged.\n\nThen, however, there was potential recipient William Wyler, who went out of his way to congratulate Orson, and there were also many staunch defenders, including Bogdanovich, Charlton Heston, and Frank Sinatra—who was hosting the February 9 ceremony.\n\nThough he was excited about the opportunity afforded by the A.F.I. award, Welles had initially been conflicted when the honor was offered, and agreed to accept it only after being assured that its intention was to show that he was still a vibrant filmmaker.\n\nThere was also the fact that Orson hated awards shows.\n\nFour years earlier, when the Academy had offered him an honorary Oscar, Welles was almost offended since—at 55—he was receiving the same award as Lillian Gish, who’d been in more than 40 movies before Orson was even born. The Oscar, he thought, was Hollywood’s way of sending him to the old directors’ home. But he had no interest in accepting his gold watch.\n\n“They’re not going to get me to do that,” he told Bogdanovich.\n\nThat year (1971), George C. Scott flatly declined his best-actor award for Patton, declaring the ceremony a “two-hour meat parade.” But with Orson it was more complicated. Everything with Orson was more complicated. And in this case his intention was to accept the honorary Oscar without actually accepting it.\n\nSo, instead of saying no, Welles claimed he was making a picture in Europe and sent Huston to accept the trophy in his stead. But when his friend raised the Oscar and said he’d drop it off for Orson in Spain while “on my way back to Ireland,” Welles was only 10 miles away, watching it all on television in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel.\n\n“Thanks, John,” he said with a laugh. “Bring it over!”\n\nBut A.F.I. was different. Approaching 60, Orson hadn’t changed his mind about awards and gave Stevens a rough ride by insinuating that he might not show up for the show unless things were arranged the way he wanted them—and then didn’t return from Europe until a few days before the ceremony.\n\nThat said, Welles had honed several clips from The Other Side of the Wind right up until the last minute, at a time when he was experiencing massive anxiety over some tax problems that he feared might lead to an embarrassing confrontation with a revenue agent or process server during the ceremony. This only added to Orson’s fear and apprehension about his future, the film, and everything else as he headed back to Hollywood with his beautifully edited scenes.\n\nJoining Orson in Los Angeles was Boushehri and one of the French producers from Astrophore, which had taken out an ad in Variety trumpeting the film as “Nearing Completion” and had scheduled numerous screenings of a rough assemblage of what they’d shot for the following week—hoping that they’d be able to secure distribution and financing quickly thereafter.\n\nOn February 9, 1975, 1,200 people gathered in the ballroom at the Century Plaza Hotel for the $125-a-plate A.F.I. dinner, where the guests included Rock Hudson, Groucho Marx, Jack Lemmon, Natalie Wood, Ryan O’Neal, Janet Leigh, Rosalind Russell, Jack Nicholson, and many other stars and industry power players.\n\nIn the ballroom, giant blowups of Welles hung behind the stage. Rendered in black and white, they showed Orson in different roles at different ages and at vastly different sizes. There he was, huge, bearded, and hearty as Falstaff, then young and handsome as Michael O’Hara in The Lady from Shanghai, commanding as Charles Foster Kane, and despicable as the bloated Quinlan, *Touch of Evil’*s corrupt cop, who doesn’t have any future because his is all used up.\n\nBut, on this evening, Orson was there to show that, in contrast to Quinlan, his future still lay before him. And because of this, Welles came to the Century Plaza that night ready to play ball, which meant showing genuine, heartfelt emotion during tributes from Johnny Carson, Ingrid Bergman, Edgar Bergen, and others. It also meant sitting through Sinatra singing “The Gentleman Is a Champ,” which began:\n\nThere’s no one like him,\n\nBut no one at all.\n\nThere have been legends,\n\nBut none quite as tall.\n\nWhat if his girth,\n\nIs—like—wall-to-wall;\n\nYou know this gentleman is a champ!\n\nWhen the camera turned to Orson, he was laughing louder than anyone.\n\nAfter Sinatra, A.F.I. director George Stevens Jr. introduced Welles by addressing the status of artists in an industry that was obsessed with box-office receipts. Reminding the crowd of the trials Orson had endured in creating stunning films under difficult circumstances, Stevens explained that they were gathering on this evening to recognize his “courage and the intensity of his personal vision,” and pointed out that the man they were there to honor “reminds us that it is better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.”\n\n“A great man never reminds us of others,” Stevens said. “Mr. Orson Welles.”\n\nRising from his table, Orson steamed toward the stage like a locomotive and arrived at the podium nearly breathless. Genuinely moved, he smoothed his beard while everyone applauded.\n\nThen, when they sat, Welles launched into a clever, emotional, and risky speech. “My father once told me that the art of receiving a compliment is of all things the sign of a civilized man. And he died soon afterwards, leaving my education in this important matter sadly incomplete,” Orson began. “I’m only glad that on this, the occasion of the rarest compliment he ever could have dreamed of, that he isn’t here to see his son so publicly at a loss…. My heart is full. With a full heart—with all of it—I thank you.”\n\nThen he spoke about “contrarieties,” using that topic to explain that while he might be considered difficult, or temperamentally unlike other directors, those things were part of what made him Orson Welles, one of a dying breed of filmmakers who chose to “trudge stubbornly along a lonely rocky road,” not unlike the small family farm that hobbles along doing its thing in a world of corporate agriculture.\n\nThese qualities, he said, didn’t make him special or better, “just different.”\n\nIn the end, Welles explained, he was nothing more than that most American of all archetypes: the maverick.\n\n“This honor,” he said, “I can only accept in the name of all the mavericks. And also as a tribute to the generosity of all the rest of you,” meaning the studios, producers, and other people who provided the money to make movies.\n\nIn just a few short minutes, Orson Welles had turned himself from an enfant terrible and profligate artist into a humble, lovable old rebel who just wanted to make movies the way he wanted to make them. What was so wrong with that?\n\nNow, with the crowd in his hands, Orson went further, neutralizing his image as “crazy Welles” by speaking directly to it and explaining that his maverick ways meant that “some of the necessities to which I am a slave are different from yours. As a director, for instance, I pay myself out of my acting jobs. I use my own work to subsidize my work. In other words, I’m crazy.”\n\nThe room exploded. He had them.\n\n“But not crazy enough to pretend to be free,” Orson said. “But it’s a fact that many of the films you’ve seen tonight could never have been made otherwise. Or, if otherwise, well, they might have been better. But certainly they wouldn’t have been mine.”\n\nWith that, he offered a toast: “[Let’s] drink together to what really matters to us all—to our crazy and beloved profession. To the movies—to good movies—to every possible kind.”\n\nWhich is where he probably should have stopped, in a moment of brotherhood, triumph, and goodwill. Welles had already shown a clip from The Other Side of the Wind, and he could have just gone to the after-party, had a few drinks, smoked some cigars, and gathered a rapt audience to whom he could have casually mentioned needing end money for his remarkable new film. But, instead, Orson showed one last scene, which he introduced in a voice that seemed barbed with arch humor.\n\nThe scene takes place in a screening room where a Hannaford associate tries to sell the director’s unfinished movie (for which he—just like Orson—needs end money) to a handsome young studio boss based on Robert Evans, which made things uncomfortable. But, worse, the sequence revealed that Hannaford’s film has no dialogue, no story line, and is nothing but a gorgeously shot disaster that even his own representative can’t explain.\n\nThe end of the scene plays out as follows:\n\nStudio Boss: I’d better read the script. [Silence.] You haven’t got one? … Jake is just making it up as he goes along?\n\nHannaford’s Associate (weakly): He’s done it before …\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, Welles and Sinatra hopped into an elevator up to the after-party. But, before the doors could close, a man stuck his arm inside and slapped a subpoena on Orson’s chest. Casually, Welles stuck the envelope in his pocket, the doors closed, and off they went.\n\nWelles always claimed that there had been an offer of end money after the A.F.I. event, and that the offer was then rejected by Astrophore, in expectation that there were going to be other—even better—offers. Bogdanovich, however, doesn’t recall a single studio or producer wanting to give Orson money to finish his movie about the director who needs money to finish his movie.\n\n“That was the horrible irony of the whole thing,” he says. “Everyone applauded wildly, but no one came up with a cent.”\n\nOrson spent the rest of his life battling for control of the film and seeking money for its completion. It’s a fight that continued after his death, in 1985, when it was taken up by Graver and countless others who thought they might be the one to finally complete Orson’s last movie.\n\nWhat each and every one of them experienced was a project that seemed under a curse comprising greed, peculiar French copyright laws, jealousies and grudges, bad judgment, complicated ownership disagreements, a messy estate, and a list of individuals who believed they had some legal, financial, moral, or artistic right to the film itself.\n\nGary Graver died of cancer in 2006, after having spent more than 35 years of his life working on the film. Seeing Joe McBride at a Welles festival not long before, Graver talked about how he was still working for Orson. “I never stopped,” Graver said.\n\nLast fall, producers Filip Jan Rymsza, Jens Koethner Kaul, and Frank Marshall (now one of Hollywood’s most successful producers) struck a deal with Astrophore and Welles’s heirs that has put them closer than anyone has ever been to getting The Other Side of the Wind out of the can and onto movie screens.\n\nUntil the final credits roll, however, Orson’s last movie continues to bear an eerie resemblance to the plot of his own film and the fate of Hannaford’s picture.\n\nAnd as for questions as to what The Other Side of the Wind was really all about? Welles may have supplied the answer in a conversation he once had with Mike Nichols. Though the pair weren’t specifically discussing the film, Nichols recalled Welles saying this: “Leave it to the other guys, the people whose whole job it is to do that, to make patterns and say what the thread is through your work and where you stand … Let somebody else worry about what it means.”\n\nAdapted from Orson Welles’s Last Movie: The Making of The Other Side of the Wind, by Josh Karp, to be published this month by St. Martin’s Press; © 2015 by the author."
