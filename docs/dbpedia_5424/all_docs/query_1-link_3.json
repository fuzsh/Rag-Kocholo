        "text": "The Correspondence series contains letters written mainly by Orson Welles to his wife Virginia Nicolson from 1937-1952. They were married in 1934 and separated in 1939 when Orson moved to Hollywood and Virginia visited Ireland with her friend Geraldine Fitzgerald. By 1940 the couple legally divorced. The letters are a combination of handwritten and typed letters and some include drawings in the margins by Welles. A significant series of letters are the ones written between July-August 1939 to Virginia. They provide insight into Welles's professional transition from New York to Hollywood, describing his first month on the West Coast and his introduction to the world of movie-making. Responses from Virginia Nicolson Welles are not included. The early photographs, wedding announcement, and Christmas card of 1937 had been housed together in an album.\n\nThe Clippings and Articles series includes newspaper clippings from 1936-2004 on both Orson and Virginia, but the majority are about Orson Welles’s career. Also included are clippings from society pages from the 1930’s announcing Orson Welles and Virginia Nicolson's marriage, the birth of their daughter Christopher, and the couple’s divorce. Some clippings include annotations in the margins by Chris Welles Feder.\n\nThe Photographs series includes a wedding portrait of Virginia and Orson Welles’s marriage in 1934. Also included are childhood photographs of Chris Welles Feder with Orson Welles along with photographs of Rebecca Welles Manning, Orson Welles’s daughter with Rita Hayworth. Also included are headshots of Orson Welles for different productions and some photographs of him as a child. Production photographs from \"Too Much Johnson\" (1938) and \"Macbeth\" (1948) both directed by Orson Welles are in the collection.\n\nAudiovisual Material is an assortment of audio cassette tapes and VHS tapes. Included are three Smithsonian Historical Performances audio cassettes of the radio dramatization of \"Les Miserables\" recorded by Orson Welles in 1937. VHS tapes include movies Welles made guest appearances in and television shows, and Criterion Collection material about his life and work.\n\nThe Miscellaneous series contains an assortment of legal documents, press packets and exhibit and awards programs from Orson Welles tributes and retrospectives.\n\nRelated Materials\n\nThere are three other collections at the University of Michigan that complement the Chris Welles Feder collection. The first, the Richard Wilson-Orson Welles Papers, contains 1930s-1950s Mercury Theater material and other papers kept by Welles's friend and long-time associate, Richard Wilson. The second is the Orson Welles-Oja Kodar Papers that documents the creative activities of Orson Welles during the last two decades of his life. The papers also contain a smaller amount of materials from the 1930s through the early 1960s. The materials in this collection were obtained from Oja Kodar, his companion and creative collaborator from the 1960s until his death in 1985. Last is the Orson Welles-Alessandro Tasca di Cutò Papers, that reflect the working and personal relationship between Orson Welles and Alessandro Tasca di Cutò. He was a producer for many of Orson Welles’s films but two were especially significant for Orson Welles: The Chimes at Midnight (also known as Falstaff, 1965) and Don Quixote (1955-73, unfinished). The papers consist of daily correspondence with Tasca di Cutò on the daily task of filmmaking. The collection dates from 1947-1995 with the bulk of correspondence from 1964."
