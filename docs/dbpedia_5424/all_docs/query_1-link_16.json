        "text": "The Hatcher Graduate Library has unveiled an exhibit titled Orson Welles as Family Man: Son, Husband, Father, showing from Jan. 11 until April 29. The exhibit highlights the life and legacy of the famous American filmmaker Orson Welles and comes from the Screen Arts Mavericks and Makers collection. The collection was curated by Phil Hallman, University of Michigan film studies field librarian, and Pablo Alvarez, U-M outreach librarian and curator of manuscript collections for the Special Collections Library.\n\nIn an interview with The Michigan Daily, Hallman said the exhibit aims to highlight a side of the director not often seen by the public. Welles is considered to be a revolutionary in filmmaking, so this exhibit was intended to show a more personal side of a man who many consider to be a genius.\n\n“The intention behind it is to not celebrate this genius which always gets talked about,” Hallman said. “I feel like that’s kind of overplayed, that hand has been played and we know that side of him, but we don’t know this more personal side as well. I have arranged the show to include a section on Welles as a son, Welles as a husband, Welles as a father and so it’s arranged in those three matters.”\n\nThe exhibit contains a wide variety of personal mementos such as letters and family photos, all of which were compiled from the U-M archives. Hallman particularly highlighted the contributions from Richard Wilson, a long-time friend and work partner of Welles.\n\n“They worked together on stage and radio and then started making films together,” Hallman said. “They had a lifelong friendship. For Welles scholars, Richard Wilson is the unsung hero, the wind beneath the wings because he’s the one who actually saved the materials. If it hadn’t been for him, Orson Welles — from what I understand, didn’t really value keeping things — so without Wilson, we wouldn’t have these documents.”\n\nThe exhibit looked at Welles’ early life and the environment in which he was raised. Hallman said the first section of the exhibit looks at Welles in the context of being a son and the relationship he had with his parental figures, Dr. Maurice Bernstein and Roger “Skipper” Hill. Hallman said the main focus of this section was the many letters he wrote to Bernstein and Hill throughout his lifetime.\n\n“Welles had a very complicated familial life, he had parents, but they both died when he was quite young and he had these two men who served as kind of surrogate parents,” Hallman said. “One was Dr. Maurice Bernstein, he was a family friend, and he was the one who encouraged Welles to learn music and read Shakespeare all these things because Welles showed immense talent from a young age. The other father was this man named Skipper Hill who was the headmaster of the boarding school that Welles attended. Hill also encouraged him to perform and interact, so together, he allowed Welles to put on plays; they wrote an introduction to Shakespeare together, which is still available.”\n\nLSA senior Kevin Waldman said the showcase of the father figures highlighted the importance of mentorship in Welles’ success.\n\n“One of the things that stood out to me was the two father figures that were in his life that were not related to him biologically, but they sort of took him under his wing for different reasons, not just career-wise,” Waldman said. “It helped him become a better man and a better father and husband and I think that one of the things that I walked away with is how important mentoring is and how important it is to learn from those who come before us. You need to look up to those who have kind of paved the way even if it’s not in your career, but it’s just someone who has the perspective of life.”\n\nLSA junior Hannah Dando said the exhibit taught her about aspects of the director’s life she did not previously know about, such as his strong background in theater and how that inspired him to see more connections between the two mediums.\n\n“I had no clue that he started in theater and I think it’s really interesting considering from a film perspective because I know there’s quite a gap between film and theater, especially in what’s considered bridgeable between the two art forms,” Dando said. “So the fact that he was able to start in theatre and transform it, his skills into film was really, really interesting.”\n\nAlvarez, the exhibit coordinator, said in an interview with The Daily it felt important to showcase the more familial side of Welles because many elements of his personal life and experiences inspired his films.\n\n“I like the connection between biography and work,” Alvarez said. “I think this is something that people sometimes forget that it is not only the film or the book or the poem you read, but there is also a life behind it.”\n\nLSA sophomore Patrick Semales said he was very drawn to the artifacts because he could see the connections between moments in his later life and his most famous work, “Citizen Kane.”\n\n“I was drawn to a lot of the photographs,” Semales said. “There’s this photograph in the exhibit of Orson Welles with one of his daughters and it’s showing her on a sled or a toboggan in some sort of snowy landscape, vacation home setting. It struck me as interesting just because it has a significance with ‘Citizen Kane,’ the sled appears to be a very catalytic object for Orson Welles. ‘Citizen Kane’ could arguably be said to be the film that launched his career, and I wondered looking at the photograph, was Orson Welles able to just be in this moment with his child on this sled?”\n\nWaldman said he thought the exhibit was very interesting, and that he appreciates the work the curators put into arranging the exhibit.\n\n“It’s extremely hard to go through those boxes and pick out things that kind of flow,” Waldman said. “So seeing the elements that are behind the scenes … that’s the thing that I think is the most important thing to walk away from realizing that and how it’s really rare to have access to these things because I tried googling certain things in there but they are only at the University of Michigan, in the archives here.”\n\nThe Orson Welles as Family Man exhibit is open to the public in Hatcher until the end of April, with a lot of personal artifacts that can only be seen at the University and gives a deep dive into a more personal side that is not usually seen. Dando said the exhibit successfully personalized the life of a celebrity and he enjoyed the material on display.\n\n“One of the initial things that stuck out to me that I thought was really interesting is how personal it was,” Dando said. “I feel like it’s quite hard to kind of see celebrities and famous people in such a sense that isn’t directly related to their career. I felt like this exhibit did an excellent job of showing who Welles was outside of his work. I love that there were a ton of letters and on the very letters you can see he drew little doodles on every single letter that he wrote to people. I thought that was adorable and it was just the biggest part that stood out to me was just the fact that it was so personalized.”\n\nDaily Staff Reporter Audrey Shabelski can be found at audres@umich.edu."
