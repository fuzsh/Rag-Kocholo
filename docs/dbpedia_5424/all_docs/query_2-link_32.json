He gave away his Oscar.\n\nWelles won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Citizen Kane in 1941. While filming The Other Side of the Wind in 1970, which was never finished, Welles was unable to afford to pay his cinematographer Cary Graver. He gave Graver his only Oscar as payment.\n\n5. He hired ambulances to drive him around New York City.\n\nAn extremely busy many with many radio shows in different parts of the city, Welles needed a sure-fire way to get from place to place in bustling Manhattan.\n\n6. He wanted to play Don Corleone.\n\nWelles was adamant about playing Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather, but Director Francis Ford Coppola already had his heart set on Marlon Brando for the part.\n\n7. He was nominated for Best Actor.\n\nWelles was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for the 1941 film Citizen Kane, which was also his first acting role. He lost to Gary Cooper, who took the award for his work in Sergeant York, a film which, unilike Citizen Kane, is on exactly nobody's list of the 100 Best Films of All Time\n\n8. His favorite meal was two rare steaks and a pint of Scotch.\n\nAnd this was a very typical meal for Welles.\n\n9. He was the voice of Unicorn in 1986's Transformers: The Movie.\n\nHe also narrated several trailers for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979).\n\n10. He had a lot of unfinished projects.\n\nDuring his career, Welles completed 13 feature films. At the time of his death in 1985, he had 15 more that were left incomplete."
