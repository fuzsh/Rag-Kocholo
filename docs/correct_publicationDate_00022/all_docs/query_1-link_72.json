        "text": "Philosophical science fiction at its best\n\nAn engaging story, even if I didn't know where it was going for a while. Excellent ideas and an exploration of AI and its consequences. Nice nods to The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and other classics. Recommended.\n\nLunar living under an AI rule\n\nJohn Varley's Steel Beach takes place within his Eight Worlds universe. Humanity has been displaced from the Earth by 'invaders.' The lunar refuge, run by the Central Computer (aka CC), is the largest in the solar system. The CC functions as the government with life somewhat idyllic, but the population has turned to destructive pastimes. The main character is a reporter who has been trying to commit suicide and enters into long philosophical discussion with the CC. Halfway through, he elects to change his sex which is quite common. He/She also becomes aware of a splinter group attempting to live on the lunar surface away from the prying eyes of the CC. This eventually leads to violent confrontations.\n\nVarley explores the sudden rupture of societal mores and traditions that accompany the displacement from Earth. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence has reached a stage where human involvement is unnecessary. This leads to two situations: 1) humans have little to do as the CC takes care of everything leading to perverse behaviors; and 2) the AI makes decisions for the 'good' of its human charges leading to abuse and corruption.\n\nThe narration is quite good with reasonable character distinction, although a female narrator after the sex change would have been preferred.\n\nTop notch writing; Voice actor needs some work\n\nJohn Varley is one of the best storytellers out there; and here his talents are on full display. The plot is a wandering jumble, full of dead ends, weird twists, and inconsistent pacing. BUT, that's all because the main character/narrator is that kind of person, and there's a ton of personality infused into the narrative. This character would never tell a story without asides, and off-topic background.\n\nThe plot itself is a complicated interwoven mix of at least 2 separate stories that need each other I order to resolve. This is not an audiobook to put on in the background--it depends your attention.\n\nIf I have one complaint it's with the audio performance. Like most audiobook performers, the narrator tries to give each character a certain voice--or sound. This book has many female characters, and they're critical characters. But this actor--when he voices a female--affects a high-pitched, breathy voice. Every female character sounds like a voice like someone imitating an airheaded-teenager in a comedy skit. It makes it hard to take the characters seriously--and you NEED to take these characters seriously.\n\nan old favorite\n\nIt has been many years since I read it for the first time. I mostly had only remembered that I liked it a lot. But now, having reread it, it is really exceptional, especially for us die-hard Heinlein fans. I would particularly recommend that people should re-read Moon is a Harsh Mistress right before this. And maybe also The Rolling Stones. Varley makes a lot of references to Heinlein, especially those two. ;-)"
