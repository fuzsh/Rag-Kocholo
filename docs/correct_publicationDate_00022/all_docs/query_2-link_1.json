        "text": "We Bought a Tesla!\n\nHere’s what happened. Lee came across what looked like a tiny, yellowing IOU at the bottom of some ancient records. It was from the Tooth Fairy, and she said she was a little short of cash and would pay me a dime the next night. It was dated May 8, 1954. I was seven! She’s still in business, you know, the Tooth Fairy, so Lee tracked her down and demanded payment. The old biddy was not ...\n\nMore details »\n\nThe Alex\n\nI seldom buy Los Angeles magazine. If you’re seeking a place where you can pay $100 for a plate of sushi, this slick mag rag is where to start looking. Or if you’re shopping for a $150,000 Patek Philippe wristwatch, you can’t go wrong in the pages of LAMag. (I have a question for anybody who might know something about $150,000 ...\n\nMore details »\n\nMammoth\n\nMultibillionaire Howard Christian is one of the wealthiest – and most eccentric – men in the country. Not content with investing his fortune and watching it grow, he buys rare cars that he actually drives, acquires collectible toys that he actually plays with, and builds buildings that defy the imagination. But now his restless mind has turned to a new obsession: cloning a ...\n\nMore details »\n\nThe Mountain Between Us\n\nThis is an okay, if pretty unlikely, story of survival. A small plane crashes high up in the mountains when the pilot suffers a fatal heart attack. The passengers, Idris Elba and Kate Winslet, survive, but he is badly hurt. A dog survives, too, and will be important in their later ordeals. They have to make their way down the mountain. It ain’t easy. This was okay until they tacked on a ...\n\nMore details »\n\nBlue Champagne\n\nA collection of eight stories, four of which are award winning.\n\nThe cover art and illustrations are by Todd Cameron Hamilton.\n\nMore details »\n\nA Short Overview of Titan\n\nHere's a very short but quite impressive video made by Jean-Paul Verne, a fly-through of Gaea from my trilogy. M. Verne wants to be involved if a movie ever gets made. Over the years many, many people have written to me wishing these books would be made into a movie. Naturally, I'd like that, too. Let's hope this is not as close as we'll ever get.\n\nMore details »\n\nAccidental Hippies\n\nSometime not long after my high school graduation I was studying at Michigan State University when my long-time girlfriend dumped me. I entered such a state of depression that I could not continue in college. So I dropped out and decided to hit the road with Chris Kingsley, my best friend in the world. Chris had much more experience of life on the road than I did, had actually hitched to ...\n\nMore details »"
