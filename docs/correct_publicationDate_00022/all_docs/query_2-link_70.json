        "text": "I’m a huge science fiction fan, and, having read a list of what are alleged to be the top 200 science fiction novels, I decided to next tackle a read-through of all the Hugo Award winners and nominees for best novel. Let me know your thoughts and favorites. I’ve marked the winner as well as my own choice for which novel would win, had I the choice among the nominees. At the end I have a brief summary comment on the year’s nominees.\n\nA Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge (Co-Winner, My Winner) Grade: A\n\nThe main plot is a first contact story, largely, between some dog like species (the Tines) who exist as kind of individual pack hive minds and humans. Dancing around this core plot is a much, much bigger plot involving, you know, the fate of the galaxy. A malevolent AI, issues of traveling through space and what that might mean for the capacities of species at different parts in the galaxy, and inter-species conflict abound. Questions about what it means to be an individual, to be intelligent, and more come up as the story goes on. It’s a simply phenomenal read that demands additional read-throughs just to be sure one catches more details. It is definitely space opera on a high level, but it’s also managed to be a fairly personal space adventure type story that is deeply intimate. It’s the kind of book that every fan of science fiction should at least give a try once to see if they like it. Also I really wish that that awesome illustration on the cover had some bearing somewhere on the contents, because a manta ray space city thing would be a ridiculously over the top and awesome story bit.\n\nDoomsday Book by Connie Willis (Co-Winner)- Grade: B\n\nDoomsday Book is a beautiful tale of someone traveling back in time to the Black Death only to be caught there and try to do the best she can with the technology at hand–which is to say she can’t do very much. It’s a heart-rending tale that I remember even years after first reading it as one I enjoyed enormously. The biggest issue with the book is that basically every “modern” scene is an absolute slog. I hate to do this to you, dear reader, but I’ll share something I wish I hadn’t thought of or heard at some point about Willis’s writings. She’s incredibly gifted, but she’s utterly obsessed with telephony and I don’t know why. I can’t unsee it. Several of her books have multiple scenes of people just missing someone else based on a land line phone, or talking about phones, or being on the phone, and it’s compounded here by some of the most frequent and annoying scenes of missed phone calls I’ve ever read. Like… can someone please pick up the damned phones!? And that’s basically the most memorable part of the book that isn’t the Black Death side of the story. That’s unfortunate, because the Black death side of the story is one of the first stories that made me cry as an adult reading a novel. It’s just so good. But wow, points lost for the phone-obsessed present era. I don’t want to visit it again.\n\nDoomsday Book ends up as a mixed bag with a solidly superb past plot combined with a pretty forgettable and even annoying modern plot.\n\nRed Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson- Grade: C+\n\nA short summary of my opinion of this book would be: “cool science, boring plot.” I’m willing to accept I’m in the extreme minority here–the book got Hugo, Nebula, BSFA, and Arthur C. Clarke Award nominations/wins so it is clearly an accepted classic across the board. For me, though, the people making up the core of the story were bland. It’s difficult to make up for that, as I found myself caring little for the action and even intense sequences in the plot. The characters simply did not grab me. And that’s a shame, because the science ideas in this novel are so cool. Robinson delves deeply into the technology and speculative science behind what could drive colonization of a world like Mars. Exhaustive sequences describing some of this going on make for, in my opinion, some of the most interesting reading of the whole book. I enjoyed these sections very much. But the human element was not enough to sustain the book, especially for such a lengthy reading. I honestly prefer Ben Bova’s Mars and following books to these by Robinson.\n\nChina Mountain Zhang by Maureen F. McHugh- Grade: C\n\nI don’t know what to think about this enigmatic work. It has some big ideas in it–the United States also experienced a communist revolution; the future is dominated by communism; etc.–but those big ideas never translate to anything on the page. Is it an exercise in making something that should be fascinating boring? Or is it a masterful play on science fiction expectations, basically giving readers a ho-hum look at a different world? I lean a bit towards the latter, but I have read the book twice now and haven’t experienced any stunning moments of insight or revelatory “getting it” that I have had with other novels that I’ve enjoyed more. Maybe I still don’t “get it,” but I don’t think I’ll give the book another try. If you really enjoyed it, I’d love to read about what struck a cord with you in the comments.\n\nSteel Beach by John Varley Grade: B-\n\nVarley’s skill as a satirist is on full display in this novel that perhaps best serves as a way to convey that dark sense of humor throughout. The central plot is narrated by a decidedly unreliable Hildy Johnson, who vascillates between wishing for suicide and delighting in whatever life throws at him. The whole story is wonky–a word that sounds just as strange as it ought to for the description of the book. Examining the plot too closely reveals many holes, and Varley himself has a rather funny afterward (at least in the addition I read) in which he tells readers not to bother sending him letters about how things should have or didn’t work because he doesn’t care. That’s very clear. This isn’t meant to be on the science side of science fiction, but rather leans heavily into the fictional side, utilizing readers’ suspension of disbelief to poke at assumptions about gender, capitalism, and more. I’m not sure where Varley lines up on most of these topics, but having read this book I bet he’d be pretty interesting to talk to.\n\n1993- 1993 is a very ’90s feeling year at the Hugos. Varley is probably the best example of this, with a sardonic plot that absolutely captures the spirit of the time. China Mountain Zhang is one I see a lot of people listing as a favorite book, and I’ve read it twice now and I struggle. Red Mars is emblematic of 90s sci-fi, with a strong hard sci-fi bent and light on characterization. I also have already talked about phones enough so we’re going to skip one of these. Okay, fine Doomsday Book is another I’ve read multiple times, but I can’t unsee the issues with it. If it were just the Black Death portion, it’d be an A+ from me. Finally, Vinge’s offer is a fantastic book that I think has something for most fans of sci-fi, though some will be put off by the length and the sometimes stilted prose.\n\nLinks\n\nMy Read-Through of the Hugos– Read more posts in this series and follow me on the journey!

Let me know your thoughts and favorites. I’ve marked the winner as well as my own choice for which novel would win, had I the choice among the nominees. I’ve also dropped a short reflection on the year’s Hugo list at the end.\n\n1984\n\nMillennium by John Varley (My Winner)- Grade: B-\n\nThe concept here is pretty awesome. On a future Earth, the present is bleak, so they send back time travelers to grab healthy humans from the past to try to reinvigorate their present. They’re spotted, and hijinks ensue. It’s a great thread, and one of the better uses of time travel. I love time travel abstractly as an idea for a story, but it’s so rarely used in ways which make it actually integral to the plot. Varley, however, uses it in a way that is impactful without ever feeling like it’s just there for the sake of the plot or throwing people into past situations. The characters aren’t terribly compelling, which makes it difficult to get into the book. Ultimately, the ideas behind the story are what kept me going as a reader. It’s definitely of the better time travel-themed novels I’ve read recently.\n\nStartide Rising by David Brin (Winner)- Grade: C-\n\nConceptually, Startide Rising–and indeed, the rest of the series–has quite a bit going for it. The idea of “uplifting” other species to sentience and then traveling through the stars with them is a good one that I have surprisingly not really run into much anywhere else. My issue with this book and the others in the series is that it drags out the concept for far too long and without as much payoff as I’d like. The cacophony of viewpoints becomes more than a bit annoying to try to follow as aliens, dolphins, and humans each chime in on galactic affairs and the events surrounding one specific ship, the Streaker, on which the humans and dolphins reside. The reader is shifted back and forth so frequently that settling in and trying to experience the story is impossible. The book is also quite lengthy, which adds to the difficulty of trying to manage so many sporadically appearing characters. I found myself wondering occasionally if I should remember a character encountered in one or another part, and it became a chore to read after a while. With a more tightly focused narrative, I think this would have been a much better read. As it stands, it shows flashes of brilliance throughout.\n\nTea with the Black Dragon by R. A. McAvoy- Grade: C-\n\nSometimes you read a book and you can tell it’s probably much better than it feels. For me, Tea with the Black Dragon was one of those books. There’s a quietude in the novel that is both appealing at times and also off-putting at others. I found myself feeling a bit bored. I know that’s a strong indictment, but its nevertheless true. I found my mind wandering off to other novels or locales, hoping that some action would occur, or that something would break the tone of the novel. I don’t really know how to describe it; I was underwhelmed here. I acknowledge the craft while at the same time noting it’s not for me.\n\nMoreta: Dragonlady of Pern by Anne McAffrey- Grade: B-\n\nMcAffrey takes readers back to an earlier time in Pern, making this book one of the potential entry points into the series. The science fantasy world of Pern has humans using dragons to fight voracious alien invaders known as Thread which falls whenever a sister planet gets close enough for them to cross the space between planets. In Moreta, a disease is spreading throughout the Weyrs to the point where effectively fighting against Thread is in danger. That puts the whole planet at risk, and Moreta must muster up the people of the Weyr to finally fight off the incursion, which is only successful when they rediscover vaccination. Reading the novel post-Covid makes it feel like a somewhat pointed and possibly refreshing science fantasy defense of vaccination as a proper way to combat disease. The book is, as I said, a good entry point into the series, but for those who’ve read everything so far, it could feel formulaic. At this point McAffrey definitely has a pattern in the stories of the novels and even in tropes of characters that show up. Fans of the series will enjoy it, and those who are new to the series may find it a good point to jump in. Those already unimpressed or with waning interest in the series will find this one another tough read. I enjoyed it pretty well, and continue to find the series a kind of comfort read. You get what you expect to get out of them.\n\nThe Robots of Dawn by Isaac Asimov- Grade: C\n\nI enjoy Asimov’s Robots series overall. They tend to have stronger characters than the Foundation series (let’s be honest, basically any characterization is stronger than that series) and I enjoy mystery novels, so combining that with sci-fi makes for a potent mix. We revisit Elijah Baley and see what he’s up to as he tackles yet another mystery, this time mixed with a heaping helping of agoraphobia. It’s a fairly good mystery story in which Asimov continues to use the setting to his advantage. The problem is that it seems almost interminably long with very little action to drive the plot forward. It’s a fine novel, but it serves much more as a springboard for discussions of Asimov’s pet issues than it does anything else. It’s a fine read, especially if you enjoyed the other books in the series, but there’s nothing extraordinary about it.\n\n1984- A somewhat disappointing year for the Hugos. None of these books are runaway winners for the award, but none are egregiously bad, either. It’s more of a milquetoast feel to the whole thing. I chose Millennium as my personal winner over Moreta only because the former feels much fresher as a read. Each book on this list has some difficulties, but each has enough qualities to make them worth at least sampling. Not a bad year, nor a good year. Look, even the cover of the winner, Millennium, is boring! What did you think?\n\nLinks\n\nScience Fiction Hub– I have scores of reviews of Hugo nominees, Vintage Sci-Fi, modern sci-fi, TV series, and more!

I’ve marked the winner as well as my own choice for which novel would win, had I the choice among the nominees.\n\nThe Ringworld Engineers by Larry Niven- Grade: D+\n\nTake the longest, most drawn-out parts of Ringworld, in which the characters are slogging through endless terrain. Now, turn that into an entire book. That’s what it feels like I just read. Yes, I know there was a plot there to try to ratchet up the tension. Something about some aliens trying to find treasure so they can impress other aliens or whatever. But realistically, the plot here absolutely drags. I mean, it’s the sloggiest of slogs. I found myself barely caring about what was happening about halfway through, and then forcing myself towards the end, which manages to be, insultingly, a cliffhanger-ish ending. A cliffhanger! After a book that did almost nothing with its characters for 300 pages! I admit I groaned a bit. Finally, something happened, and it was right as I turned the page to run into the epilogue.\n\nBeyond the Blue Event Horizon by Frederik Pohl- Grade: A-\n\nA small group of humans goes to explore an artifact left by the Heechee, a super-advanced race that mysteriously disappeared. There’s a surprising amount of plot tucked into this book that starts with a kind of razor focus on four main characters and ultimately has galaxy-wide implications. As I read, it seemed there was plenty left unexplained. It’s possible I missed some explanations. I just thought that more questions were opened near the end than were closed. I didn’t realize that this opens up more of a series from Pohl, though, and I’m interested in whether the next few books live up to the first two.\n\nThe Snow Queen by Joan D. Vinge (Winner, My Winner)- Grade: A\n\nI had a number of abortive attempts to read this a few years ago and then just gave up. I picked it up for the fourth or fifth time on a vacation for this read-through and it all started to click together. This is a retelling of Hans Christian Anderson’s “Snow Queen…” kind of. It doesn’t really strike me as having too many similarities, but my only experience with Anderson’s version is, to be fair, a few cartoon versions somewhere (I think) and the Wiki page. So I basically read this on its own merits, and it stands up very well. The world building here is at a level akin to some of the all time greats. The characters are complex, though a few get lost on tangents here and there along the way. The star is the Snow Queen and Moon, her pseudo-progeny slash rival for power. Political intrigue, questions of connection to a greater universe, and more abound throughout the novel. It’s not an easy read. This is one you’ll need to sit down and pay attention to, which thankfully lent itself to a couple long drives across South Dakota and Wyoming for me (I wasn’t driving, before you get too worried). I think I can now say I understand why this is considered a great by so many, and I may even dive into it again in a year or two because I enjoyed it immensely. It’s dense, though, almost to the point of being unbearably dense.\n\nLord Valentine’s Castle by Robert Silverberg- Grade: A-\n\nA science fantasy epic follows the story of Valentine, a man who’s memories have been repressed as he finds himself in a major city with a pile of coins but little knowledge of what to do. He becomes a juggler with a traveling party of humans and aliens for lack of anything better to do. As the novel goes on, layers of this fantastical world are peeled away and readers are swept into the adventure of Valentine as he rediscovers himself and his place on Majipoor. I used the terminology “swept” on purpose, because this is a novel that, if you’ll allow it, will take you up and carry you on an adventure across the massive planet. There are parts where the plot could drag, such as the lengthy descriptions of the juggling. However, if one lets oneself truly dive into those parts and see the flow, the rhythm, and the beat for what they’re intended to be, it’s enthralling. A slow burn read that builds on itself over its lengthy stay, I believe readers will largely get out of it the amount of emersion they’re willing to allow.\n\nWizard by John Varley- Grade: B-\n\nA significant improvement over the first book in nearly every way. Wizard tells the story of the world of Gaea, which is somehow sentient and also personal and… has many other singular qualities. Readers follow the story of a few pilgrims to Gaea, each seeking their own answers, who get drawn into a kind of epic journey trying to figure out and possibly overthrow some of the mechanisms behind Gaea’s workings. Along the way, no small amount of Weird Sci-Fi conventions get thrown into the mix. Whether it’s the pseudo-centaur-like creatures on Gaea engaging in explicitly detailed sex with a human, many, many other sexual comments and scenes, the constantly pseudo-feminist-yet-weirdly-male-gaze-y narrative of a certain character, or any number of other scenes, the reader is treated to a veritable cacophony of strangeness. At times, the feeling of “other” is overwhelming to the point where it becomes almost prosaic to have an actual plot happening. Happens it does, however, and the story itself is fine enough, though I found some if its elements (such as Gaea’s boredom and attempts to cure it) a bit disappointing. Still, this is a singular work that, so far as I am concerned, vastly surpasses the first in the series.\n\n1981\n\nWhat a weird year. Wizard headlines the weirdness by being among the more strange pieces of science fiction I’ve read–but it remains readable. I had fun reading it as I walked circles around a local pond. Snow Queen is a book that felt a monumental task to finish, and I’m glad I did. I doubt if I’ll ever attempt it again, though, despite it being my pick for a winner. It’s majestic, but overbearing. Silverberg’s entry is somehow a traditional-feeling fantasy novel, something I haven’t really encountered from him (which shows both his range and my need to read more of his works!). I was hoping to find a newfound love of the Ringworld books, as I always hear them raised as longtime favorites. I especially felt this way after having finally “figured out” the first book in some ways. But alas, I found Ringworld Engineers to be boring and mostly pointless. Finally, Beyond the Blue Event Horizon is full of big ideas and cool happenings. While it never reaches the highest of heights, its a supremely worthy read. 1981 is a solid year for the Hugos. It’s not the best, but it certainly isn’t the worst year. It also is one of the few years so far in which my winner was the same as the actual winner. I should keep track of how often this happens.\n\nLinks\n\nScience Fiction Hub– I have scores of reviews of Hugo nominees, Vintage Sci-Fi, modern sci-fi, TV series, and more!

I’ve marked the winner as well as my own choice for which novel would win, had I the choice among the nominees.\n\nThe Fountains of Paradise by Arthur C. Clarke (Winner)- Grade: D\n\nThe Fountains of Paradise is dull almost beyond words. It’s served with a heaping helping of ‘religious people are stupid’ on top. Hey, maybe you think religious people are stupid, but if you do, can you at least acknowledge that some of them are thoughtful instead of making them all into cardboard caricatures? There’s a decent premise, I guess. Let’s build an elevator to the stars. Of course, only one place on Earth is suitable for some extremely dense hard sci-fi reason. I love science fiction. And I have enjoyed books by Clarke, but this one was aggravating and boring. That’s an accomplishment. Clarke has done much better.\n\nTitan by John Varley- Grade: D\n\nTitan is a combination of some hard science fiction themes along with some fantasy elements. It’s a recipe for something that I love, but when you add something awful into the mix, it all goes sideways. Here, that something awful is a heaping dose of misogynist sexual fantasies. The amount of ink spilled upon how women look and just how good they might be because of a shapely thigh or somesuch is just… so over the top. It was distracting all the way through to the extent that it, along with the assumptions about how men and women in general would act, detracted entirely from my enjoyment of the novel. But then I started to notice some of the other issues with it–some big plot holes, somewhat annoying characters, and nonsensical twists. I’ll be reading the next book, entirely because it also got an award nomination, so I’m hoping that I like it more.\n\nJem by Frederik Pohl- Grade: D\n\nI did not like this book very much. A planet is discovered and humans want to peacefully colonize it as a kind of idyllic vision. Back on Earth, things go south and the new colony turns into a kind of last hope for humanity. On the colony, the alien races there are more (or less, in some ways?) than they appear. Honestly, the last 5% or so of the novel was good–it shows the consequences of even well-intentioned colonialism. Everything else was a slog. The first 80 pages or so seem to be half tribute to Pohl contemporaries, half boring meetings of people talking about or seducing each other as they try to figure out colonizing. The whole thing just ends up feeling extremely boring and even chore-like to read, though the bit of payoff at the end made me less upset about paying the fee to interlibrary loan it.\n\nOn Wings of Song by Thomas Disch- Grade: D+\n\nHow do you grade books that clearly demonstrate talent while also being nearly unreadable because they feel caught in the past with ideas that are sometimes cringe and sometimes just silly? I don’t know, but here’s where I settled on this frustrating, strange book. The premise is that the United States has turned, in parts, into ultra-conservative dystopias while at the coasts there exist some kind of hippy-ville that also has its share of problems. Someone has developed a way to have astral projection and trigger spiritual experiences, and Daniel Weinreb, our protagonist, has no small amount of trouble because of this “flying.” Ultimately, the book climaxes in a kind of revelation of the capacity to fully leave the body with the mind even as many conservatives and non-flyers reject the reality. It seems to clearly be a parable of a kind, but one that is so hidden behind layers that it’s difficult as to what Disch is trying to get at. Is he warning of the dangers of ultra-conservativism? Probably? Is it a broadside against religion? Perhaps? Is astral projection via machine a metaphor for drugs? I don’t know? It’s such a strange read set in sometimes strong prose that makes it all the more frustrating. I didn’t like it, but I understand why many might.\n\nHarpist in the Wind by Patricia McKillip (My Winner)- Grade: B\n\nHarpist in the Wind is the third and concluding volume in the Riddle-Master trilogy by McKillip. Like the other books in the series, the focus is pretty narrow, largely following a group of characters on an adventure as they quest to discover the mysteries behind some shape-shifters that have been dogging them, along with the mystery of the Kingdom in which they travel. There are moments of great revelations, especially when the magic is revealed in various parts. There are also moments of tenderness that are surprisingly strong in characterization. I have to express some disappointment, though, in that despite the massive focus on riddles as ways to control and even do battle with others, there is very little by way of actual riddles in the novels themselves.\n\n1980- Uffda. This was a rough year for the Hugos. Several familiar names headline these nominations, but none of them delivered the goods, imo. McKillip’s novel is a worthy choice for a nominee, but would not win a stronger year. The winner chosen at the actual ceremony–Clarke’s The Fountains of Paradise–is a tedious slog. The other books don’t fare much better. It’s almost like the voters just nominated favorite authors for the sake of seeing their names yet again on the ballot. One of the worst years, in my opinion.\n\nLinks\n\nScience Fiction Hub– I have scores of reviews of Hugo nominees, Vintage Sci-Fi, modern sci-fi, TV series, and more!
