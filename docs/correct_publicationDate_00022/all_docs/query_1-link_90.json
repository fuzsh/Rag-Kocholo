With the original unclipped pictorial dust-jacket. Ever so slightly foxed to endpapers and fore-edges. otherwise very clean, tight, square and free from annotations an inscriptions. Unclipped dust-jacket lightly rubbed to edges and back panel, retains bright and vibrant colouring and is free from tears. A Near Fine copy in a Very Good dust-jacket. Varley's Locus Award winning imaginative Sci-Fi in the tradition of Arther C. Clarke's 'Rendezvous with Rama' and Larry Niven's 'Ringworld'.\n\nOctavo, printed wrappers. Letter from the publisher's senior editor to author Michael Bishop soliciting a favorable comment laid in. First book of the Gaean trilogy. 1979 Nebula and 1980 Hugo nominee. \"Huge, enjoyable, detailed and rambling account of a NASA expedition to a newly discovered moon. The moon eats all the crew, who wake up inside and discover it to be a sort of living spaceship which has created various beings derived from Earth myths it's seen on television.\" - Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, second edition (1995), p. 380. [Reference: Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-1173]. Slight lean to spine, a nearly fine copy. (29317) Advance copy (uncorrected proof) of the first edition.\n\nHardcover. Condition: Fine.

Text block edges are white, with a little dustiness and a couple of feint spots tot he top edge. Feels lightly read. Fine condition. Jacket very tidy without any tears or chipping, has sunning to spine that has affected the red titles, otherwise nice and clean. Due to sunning the jacket grades very good. This book is fitted with a non adhesive archival quality book protector to make a quality addition to your collection. Note we do not use stock images, the book pictured is the book described. A near fine example of this first edition first printing title, Varley's first novel in the Gaean series, followed by Wizard and Demon. This is a very uncommon issue, especially in this condition (the other two copies I was able to locate offered in the last 12 months were exlib copies). Does not have an entry in ISFDB. Shame about the sunning to spine, but still a scarce Sidgwick & Jackson SF title to add to a collection.\n\nHardcover. Condition: Near Fine. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good+. First edition. 8vo.
