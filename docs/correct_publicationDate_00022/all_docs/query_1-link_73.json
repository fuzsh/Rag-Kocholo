        "text": "☆☆☆☆☆ (.5 Stars)\n\nI collect pulp: out of print, obscure, odd paperbacks from yesteryear with funny names and titles. The Barbie Murders delivers beautifully on both of those points, and to try and bust through some mental stress, I picked it up to read it for fun. Cleanse it from my library of unread books. I know old pulp can be tricky: there is often a level of racism and sexism present which genuinely can be treated as ‘of the time’ (though it hardly excuses it). It’s not the most accessible escape because of that, but it can be an interesting one.\n\nJohn Varley’s The Barbie Murders is a collection of short stories that left me desperate to google the author and learn what was wrong with him. What I did learn is he’s still alive, which makes it a bit harder to safely roast him. Oh well, I don’t need deep reflections to understand what made this man write these stories: I have his stories, and oh boy do they reveal too much.\n\nThis review will cover each short story in the collection with a few overall thoughts throughout. It will comment on without explicit quotes a number of very difficult topics which Varley seems to have an undue fascination with, namely incest and pedophilia, which even in light detail may be disturbing for some. Watch out.\n\nFirst, some context: Almost all of these stories are set in Varley’s ‘eight worlds’ universe. I appreciate when collections function like this, expanding a universe-wide setting with various glimpses. The order of the stories too is relatively deliberate: it introduces certain concepts that later reoccur in a sensible way, and it also starts with the better stories before its… descent.\n\nI’m also going to discuss something off the bat about the very controversial topics which appear in later stories. Pedophilia is a slightly inaccurate term, but only slightly. Multiple stories are concerned specifically with adults in children’s bodies having sex with each other and adults… and children. In this world, puberty is said to be accelerated, with children being mentally grown before the age of 5 and sexually mature by the age of 7. These however are excuses: multiple of these stories, again, have a focus on childhood and the innocence of childhood and growing up, treating children supposedly mature by the age of 7 as… children, narratively. Even the adults in their ‘second childhood’, surgically, have much of the mental processes of children. These are excuses: in universe, it is legal and excused and vaguely meant to be Fine, but the narratives don’t support this claim and it’s very clear it’s all an excuse to write some highly specific content.\n\nIt’s worth noting pulp sci-fi from this time has such topics as a theme fairly commonly. It’s hardly the first time I’ve encountered a pulp book which makes some reference to acts which we would find morally reprehensible as now acceptable. It seems many men in the 70s tried to picture a future society with grand social change and could only picture that pedophilia and bestiality would be normal- though racial slurs wouldn’t have changed at all. Odd visions of the future, these men had.\n\nThere is thus some argument to be had about art VS artist, about when a vision of the future heavy with transhumanism and change has an excuse to depict things as different from now. After all, it is hundreds of years in a strange alien future where humanity was banished to the stars by Cetacean-loving aliens: who is to say what morality looks like in a world where age, sex, and identity is entirely malleable? Depicting reprehensible acts in media is not the same as endorsing it, and media has to be able to depict the full expanse of human experience- good, bad, gross- to be free. That’s why Mallworld, one of my favourite pulp sci-fis, can get a pass to me with the one reference it has to sex with children- it is not meant to be anything but a shock to a modern audience, to show how weird and strange the future is. It’s a storytelling throwaway.\n\nWhat makes Varley different is that it is not a throwaway, it is not a one off, it is less a literary choice and more a fixation. The last four stories in this 9 story collection prominently feature sex with children as a theme. One story meant to show how Wildly different societal norms are would be one thing, four is a pattern. Even then, the detail and focus is… prominent. These are not short stories, most of them counting as ‘novelettes’, and the author seems to have simply made a universe where certain acts are the norm as a way to write certain acts. On the subject, he specifically loves writing mother/child incest: yes, he stacks the two together often and freely.\n\nSo with that in mind, I know too much. I had to skim some of these later stories, growing just too uncomfortable, and even acting here as a very forgiving media-savvy neutral party, I think I can freely say Varley’s interest in the topic goes beyond what is acceptable. I’m not accusing him of anything: art and artist are different, and writing like this is allowed to explore taboo topics. But it’s far, far too much focus on a subject most people would find difficult to write one story about. It makes you think. It makes you viscerally uncomfortable.\n\nBagatelle\n\n★★★☆☆ (3/5)\n\nIt’s weird to jump from dunking on the author to giving the first story an okay rating, but I am here to be honest, and it’s an okay story. Bagatelle follows a police officer called in to deal with a very polite bomb. She calls on a very flippant bomb expert, and the rest is the process of the expert acting ridiculously but eventually solving this stray nuclear bomb. The world of tubes under the surface of Luna and the utter reliance on technology is interesting throughout, but that is the highest praise to be given.\n\nIt’s an okay story. The ideas and world are the best part, the characters are not much: a policewoman mostly naked (in the future everyone is, generally) and an overconfident man who does all the work. It turns out the bomb was once a man, who had himself turned into a bomb after going through a crisis. He realized his entire life was run by machines, but rather than hate the machine he hated humanity for being the weakest piece in that machine. An interesting twist. The ending is fast and nothing, failing to stick the alright ending in any way. It just ends and doesn’t leave you feeling like the story really was complete. This is a running theme: the man really can’t write endings.\n\nThe Funhouse Effect\n\n★★☆☆☆ (2/5)\n\nAnother story where the execution is flat compared to the idea. A man is on the last cruise of a comet that has been turned into a spaceship to view the sun up close, and he seems to be the only one noticing a series of strange events. The crew is incompetent and disagrees with each other constantly, the engines are missing, and there’s not enough lifeboats. He meets a woman with hands for feet and they try to investigate, encountering increasing oddities. The main character, a science fiction author, notes it feels a bit like the pulp serials he writes, and feels he’s increasingly going insane by how surreal things are. There’s mutiny, and then a terrorist group takes over the bridge. Then another, and another.\n\nAs the comet begins to fall apart and he nearly falls into the sun, the story shifts from third to first person and we receive the twist. This was a thrill ride all along, an entirely safe and pre-written disaster, which involves all those participating to first wipe their memory and gain a new one to make it feel more ‘genuine’. The last section of the story is essentially a review, where the lead notes the story wasn’t very believable or well written, and then confusingly goes off on the company for inventing such a ‘cheap thrill’- which again, he signed up for in the first place.\n\nThe idea here is something. If instead of ending on a complaint against humanity for making cheap thrills it just ended like an angry yelp review, it’d be funnier. Instead, it’s just sort of headscratching. The time before the ruse is revealed is as a chaotic and badly written as the lead complains, and as an audience, well… the reveal doesn’t change that. It’s just not an enjoyable story, but the base idea is sound.\n\nThe Barbie Murders\n\n★★★★☆ (4/5)\n\nThe titular story is the best one of the lot. It still suffers the same problems, however, with a poor and sudden ending and uninteresting leads. The world and ideas are good though.\n\nIt involves a murder, committed in front of a camera, involving two ‘Barbies’- a cult of surgically identical people who similarly have forsaken all personal distinction. They believe they all must be as identical as possible in every way, and so use only plural pronouns (we, not I) and have fully fluid identities (one committing an act is the same as them all committing it). Their group identity is a very interesting idea, as is the notion of solving a murder in such a community. There is no way for the police to tell any of them apart and they do not draw a distinction between any of them, offering one up to serve as the guilty party regardless of which one actually did the murder.\n\nSome parts of this society don’t hold up well to scrutiny- what happened to DNA? Surely if one was committing murder, the rest would want the ‘different’ cell in their sameness eliminated? But overall the story is an exploration of this society set to a frustrating police investigation. It is eventually learned the killer was targeting those who developed a fetish for individuality, who would secretly meet at night to pretend to be unique beings. Interesting again! But the ending is just sudden, floundering again and leaving the reader unfulfilled.\n\nEquinoctial\n\n★★★☆☆ (4/5)\n\nI read the first three in one day and the rest starting from here another. The fourth story takes a turn which will reflect the rest in the collection, though we’re still not on that stuff yet. This one is rather a transhuman story with a fixation on bodies and pregnancy (pregnancy is another reoccurring fascination for Varley).\n\nThere exists a creature called a Sym, or Symbiote, which can attach to humans. But rather than merely be a parasite, it is a full 50/50 split which entirely redefines the human host: the sym connects on every level and every place to the human, enveloping them in a green morph suit of sorts. The human loses all ability to use their senses, relying on the sym’s vastly alien senses to understand the world. The sym takes root in the mind, growing from a sort of child to an adult born entirely from the human’s knowledge, feeding on radiation and waste while allowing the human to survive in hostile environments they couldn’t otherwise. In this case, the rings of Saturn where war between a cult painting the rocks red and those against that is brewing.\n\nThe sym connection is deep and whole, with the lead viewing her sym as her ‘mate’- the two organisms can exist without each other, but once fully fused perceive themselves as the same entity, and no one willingly quits their sym once fully fused. It’s an interesting parasite-host relationship which is written as a romance (with of course the note the sym, while not really a child, first begins with a child-like mindset learning from the host’s brain- Varley again has a thing for parent-child incest, even when it doesn’t really count here).\n\nThe sym also allows the human to live for hundreds of years, and this story takes place over years of slow time drifting between the rings of Saturn. The two together are entirely self-reliant and with the sym-human connection, there isn’t loneliness either. The main character has just given birth to five children, but wakes to find they have been stolen by the red-ring cultists. As has her sym. Between a flashback to her first mating with her sym to her seeking her back, we get to explore this very weird world. She gets a new sym and infiltrates the cult, which is currently under orders all members spend 90% of the time as women and deliver at least three babies a year. Her sym, which is both her and not, is desperate to find her old sym and jealous of the fact she will be replaced. It’s mostly just this odyssey of months and years.\n\nEventually, she finds her five children, who are now all adults at the age of seven, and again it all simply ends. While not the best story in many ways, it’s a good exploration of a very transhuman future.\n\nManikins\n\n☆☆☆☆☆ (0/5)\n\nAlmost in this collection by mistake, this story does not seem to be set in the same universe and is absolutely nothing. Set in a mental hospital- a great start- a junior doctor interviews a delusional woman about her delusions. The story is just her conspiracy theory that all men are parasites, specifically that penises are parasitic aliens infecting womankind. By the end, the lead seems to be delusional as well.\n\nThis story is nothing and unclear what it even is trying to be, besides vaguely maybe mocking feminist movements at the time- the only something I can see in it is the notion of a crazy woman-hating man, and how crazy it is for that to exist.\n\nBeatnik Bayou\n\n☆☆☆☆☆ (0/5)\n\nOkay, here we go. You’ll be seeing a lot less details from here on out.\n\nThis introduces the notion that on the moon, in their normal society, the role of a teacher now is to ‘grow up’ alongside the child. The lead has two teachers in a mock-bayou biome who have been surgically age-regressed to be 7 when he was 7. Now he is 14, and the story is sort of him outgrowing them, but rather than do anything interesting, it’s specifically mostly about sex. The fact he has been having sex with his teacher since he was 7, which is seen as normal, and now his mother has hired a teacher who is an adult for his next life stage, who is also having sex with him.\n\nThe plot is supposedly about outgrowing things, but again, it’s just really an excuse for a lot of really unnecessary uses to write This stuff. I wound up having to skim sections because I was growing too uncomfortable.\n\nGood-Bye, Robinson Crusoe\n\n☆☆☆☆☆ (0/5)\n\nA boy living on a disnDisneyort being built on Pluto likes to play games, pretending to fight pirates and live on a deserted island. He actually shuns having sex, unlike others of his age (10 or 14) who encourage him. Then, an adult woman shows up who plays games with him like a child. Then they start having sex. Then he also views her as a mother figure. It is revealed he is actually an adult, the finance minister of Pluto, and she’s a therapist sent to get him out of his ‘second childhood’ phase and fix Pluto’s economy.\n\nYou can see by two in a row I was starting to get a bad feeling about all this.\n\nLollipop and the Tar Baby\n\n★☆☆☆☆ (.5/5)\n\nThis one could nearly get a pass. But of course it can’t.\n\nA girl and her ‘mother’- actually the woman she was cloned from- travel the far reaches of space hunting for black holes, which are tethered as energy sources. She is 18 (was that so hard?) and resents her ‘mother’ now, though in flashbacks they were- of course- having sex from a young age. Sigh.\n\nThe lead finds a black hole, which begins speaking to her through radio frequencies, explaining it is sentient. This is new information and she’s not sure if she’s just mentally unwell. It tells her having clones is illegal, and she is one of many her creator has made over the years for company, killing them whenever she reenters society. The lead thus kills her creator and assumes her identity, while the black hole consumes her and runs away. There is nearly an interesting idea here again, but Varley can’t help making it weird.\n\nPicnic on Nearside\n\n☆☆☆☆☆ (.5/5)\n\nA boy and his friend run away to the ‘nearside’ of the moon because he’s angry at his mother for not letting him get the ‘change’ yet- that is, a sex change. The future here is very free with sex and gender, with most people changing it many times over the course of their life, and only 10% being said to have any preference. (And yes, as you can guess, it is mentioned he has sex with his mom and yes he is about 14).\n\nHe and his friend meet there one of the last surviving humans from before the Earth was taken over by those cetacean-loving aliens, a man who is even still Christian. They hang out with him, learn some stuff about his weird old morals (like underage sex and incest being bad!) and then he dies and they head home.\n\nIn the end, well. You shouldn’t read this.\n\nIt’s again one of those things where we do have to weigh art and artist, the reasons why pulp often goes places and experiments with morality and acts which we find reprehensible. But there’s also a big difference from a sentence or two to actually depicting such acts, there’s a big difference form one story meant to make readers uncomfortable and a significant number of words of different scenarios on the theme. I don’t like reading books which make me actively feel like I’m committing a crime, how about that?"
