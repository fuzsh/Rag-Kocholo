        "text": "Excellent addition to my Varley library\n\nI've been reading John Varley for at least 20 years. The pages of the paperbacks I picked up after first checking them out of the public library are now yellowing and their covers cracked eith use. Hearing the author's voice added so much to my enjoyment of this audio book, but will greatly enhance reading his work in print as well. If you're a fan of this brilliant writer, get this book.\n\nHow did I miss this guy?\n\nI’ve always been a huge sci-fi fan. How did I miss this guy?\n\nI really enjoyed these original works by John Varley. They fulfilled a need I have for taking my imagination in a completely new direction of conceivable future possibilities. And they don’t denigrate anyone in the process. The story concepts age well.\n\nOften on older sci-fi I have found a slight distaste that I have to chock up to ‘sign of the times’ when there are few, (if any), references to strong women characters. It’s a turn-off if the female characters are weak. These stories are balanced well.\n\nI really enjoyed the authors introductions. They made the stories feel more interactive.\n\nI also enjoyed the narrators. They did a great job and it was a good idea to have different voices in the delivery of - was it 22+ hours of delivery.\n\nThis book is great sci-fi for mature young adults to open minded mature adults. It might be a little too much for immature readers.\n\nWell done!\n\nGreat Writing\n\nI was really dazzled by some of the stories, and the narration was superb. Warning though, there is a lot of mention of sex, and some involving children or young adults in some of the stories.\n\nInventive, engrossing, poor technical production\n\nI enjoy John Varley's stories and these are no exception. They are thought-provoking. The narrators did a decent job and I warmed to each of them over time. What I found frustrating was the production of the audio. Little things like no pause between sentences when going from one subject or section of a book to another, causing some significant confusion until you realize what happened.\n\nVery good\n\nRuns the gamut of human experience, a delight to savor. All about people's reaction to their lives done in SF styling. You're gonna love it.\n\na charming walk down memory lane\n\ngood stuff, charming and nostalgic 60's and 70's scifi. while listening i had several moments of recognition like, \"oh so Varley wrote that!\". for instance I have fond memories of the made for TV movie \" overdrawn at the memory bank\" from my youth. It was like a weird gem i had found, special and mine, and over the years it seemed not many people remembered or saw it. I did skip a couple stories because I got bored or the reader was annoying. eh, can't knock it out of the park every time. if you like predictable and gratuitous casual sex and nudity there is plenty to go around.\n\nSome of Varley’s best\n\nI love John Varley’s work and this collection is great reading that sticks with you. I especially enjoyed Jane Eyre’s reading of several of the better stories.\n\nvery good\n\nNot all the stories were amazing but overall I really enjoyed them as a whole. Easy recommend for any science fiction fan.\n\nboo\n\nto woke. for my liking\n\ntried to finish but just to woke for me"
