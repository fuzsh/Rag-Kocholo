        "text": "(1778–1842). English artist John Varley inspired a British school of watercolor painting. Varley was an enthusiastic, charming individual who painted landscapes and taught a number of important younger artists. The author of a book about astrology, Varley became a friend of the great poet-artist William Blake. Varley’s younger brother Cornelius was also a skillful draftsman and watercolor painter.\n\nJohn Varley was born on August 17, 1778, in London, England. He believed that artists should draw from nature, and as a young man he made several sketching journeys to northern Wales as well as to Yorkshire, in northern England, and to western England. The scenery Varley viewed on these tours inspired his finest paintings, which all come from early in his career, such as Sunrise from the Top of Cader Iris (1804). For 20 years, beginning in 1800, he studied with Thomas Monro, who had also taught artist J.M.W. Turner. Varley had to make and sell many paintings in order to support his large family. In time he became a conventional artist, painting landscapes according to a formula, in the styles of classic painters. Late in his life he spent periods of time in debtors’ prison.\n\nA talented teacher, Varley included important younger artists—such as the Romantics Samuel Palmer, John Linnell, and William Mulready and landscape painter Peter De Wint—among his students. Varley wrote manuals on landscape design and on drawing in perspective. Beginning in 1818, he was a friend of William Blake, who drew spirits he had envisioned for Varley’s sketchbooks. Varley was also an astrologer and author of Zodiacal Physiognomy (1828), which was illustrated with engravings of Blake’s spirits. Varley died on November 17, 1842, in London.\n\nOn occasion John Varley used a graphic telescope to trace objects. The graphic telescope was an invention of John’s younger brother Cornelius Varley (1781–1873). Th instrument reproduced scenes on a sheet of paper. Cornelius himself used it to make a drawing of Turner. Besides inventing electrical and optical items, Cornelius, like John, was a masterful landscape painter who worked in watercolors."
