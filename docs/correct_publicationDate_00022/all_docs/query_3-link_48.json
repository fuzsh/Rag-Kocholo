        "text": "A sci fi masterpiece!\n\nI gave read the Gaean trilogy many years ago and loved it. It was creative and very well developed without being overly wordy or overly descriptive. The world is clearly painted without becoming dull in endless descriptions. Very interesting and well developed characters that leave you wanting more. The narrator did an excellent job. Her voice is very clear. The characters voices are distinct and it is not difficult at all to tell which characters are meant to be speaking at the time. I highly recommend this book series.\n\nbit too technical for me\n\nWhat did you like best about Titan? What did you like least?\n\ni like the creativity however it was too technical for me to listen to while i'm at work bcuz so much of the book was just describing the torus in such a way that i felt i needed to be an architect to really visualize what john varley was trying to to convey\n\nWhat about Allyson Johnsonâ€™s performance did you like?\n\ni liked that she accurately fluctuated her voice depending on which character she was reading from.\n\nCould you see Titan being made into a movie or a TV series? Who should the stars be?\n\nyes. me! (why not?) *shrugs*\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nnope\n\nFirst of Varley's classic Gaean Trilogy\n\nTitan is the first part of the classic Gaea Trilogy; the Lord of the Rings of Sci-fi. (Mild spoilers ahead!) Consider an insane goddess obsessed with Earth religions and Hollywood cinema who creates new kinds of creatures for her amusement, and alleviates her boredom by dropping humans from bottomless elevators, offering miracles to pilgrims in return for heroics, and inciting thermonuclear wars. It has amorous blimps and submarines, holy zombies, smiling cattle, a giant Marilyn Monroe, and a story thread that would honor Joseph Campbell with the rise of the hero, the hero's fall, and the hero's redemption. I've long been convinced that Cirocco Jones had to have been the inspiration for Alien's Ellen Ripley (although both appeared about the same time), and her partner Gaby must have been an inspiration of Xena's Gabrielle. They're just too darn close. Of course I was thrilled when I spotted the series on Audible and I snatched it right up. The narrator has a comfortable voice and does fine work with the voices of Gaby, Cirocco, and the others. Although the books can stand on their own, they work best taken sequentially with Titan giving the introductions, Wizard the tragedies, and Demon the triumphs. Titan starts the series a bit slowly, but they are all worth repeated reads. I recommend them.\n\nA good if dated SciFi Story\n\nMy apologies, I wrote my review on book 2 and meant it to be on book 1!\n\nI read a lot of SciFi and this book was a good listen. The narrators voice was a bit difficult for me at first, but once I got used to her, she was actually a very good story teller. The book was written in 1979, so some of the themes are quite dated (The Soviet Union for example), however while dated, it was an entertaining read. I have just purchased the second book and will be listening to it right after I finish Neil Gaiman's latest book.\n\nLoved it when I read it years ago\n\nAnd loved the entire series again in audio. The characters are compelling and the world of Gaea is inventive and the creatures Gaea made inspired by Earth movies are wonderful. The Titanides are centaurs with a complex reproductive system involving up to 4 parents and they are particularly appealing. They use the names of the Greek musical modes (Aeolian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian) coupled with the words \"solo\", \"duet\", \"trio\" or \"quartet\" to describe the number of parents the individual has, and the ways in which genetic material is transferred between them. They are also brightly colored with intricate patterns.\n\nI never forgot the Titanides or the Blimps or Cirroco Jones from my early reading of the trilogy and it was great fun to relive the experience in the audio version."
