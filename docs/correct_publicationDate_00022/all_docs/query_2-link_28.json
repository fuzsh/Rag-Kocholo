        "meta_description": "John Varley joined Clinton Devon Estates in 2000 after varied career in senior management with BT plc, mainly in the global and operations divisions. The estate comprises 10,000 hectares across east and north Devon and in addition to farming and forestry, operates a range of rural businesses and also a portfolio of residential and commercial property. The estate has won the Queen’s Award for Enterprise 3 times and is a Sunday Times top 100 company to work for. John’s current non-executive positions include board member of the Environment Agency, where he also chairs their £2.3 billion pension fund. In May 2015, John will chair the Estates Business Group. John is a fellow of the Royal Agricultural Society. Recently, John was an independent member of the Lawton Review: “Making space for nature” which was a major influence on the government’s Natural Environment White Paper. In March 2011 John was appointed to the Defra Independent Forestry Panel and in September 2011 he was appointed as a judge on the government’s Nature Improvement Area competition panel. Until 2002, John spent 22 years as an officer in the Territorial Army, Royal Artillery in his “spare time” and he now spends most of it with his family, helping to bring up 3 children. John has been appointed to the Natural England board until 30 March 2018.",
