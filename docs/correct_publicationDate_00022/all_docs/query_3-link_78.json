        "text": "Rendezvous with Rama\n\nBy Arthur C. Clarke,\n\nFrom my list on peaceful alien contact.\n\nBy Wil Mccarthy Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been a science fiction writer since I was old enough to read, and I’ve spent probably way too much of my life reading and writing and researching and thinking about aliens. I’ve worked in the aerospace industry, launching rockets to the moon and Mars and Saturn, and five of the books I’ve published have touched on alien life in one way or another. I’ve worked as a contributing editor for WIRED magazine and the science and technology correspondent for the SyFy channel, and I hold patents in seven countries, including 31 issued U.S. patents.\n\nWil's book list on peaceful alien contact\n\nWhy did Wil love this book?\n\nOf all of Clarke’s works, this one had, for me, the grandest sense of adventure and mystery. We never do find out who the aliens are or what their goals might be, but we get to join them for part of their journey.\n\nThere are puzzles to solve, wonders to behold, and dangers bravely faced. I first read the book when I was nine years old, and it communicated to me just as clearly then as it does today.\n\nBy Arthur C. Clarke,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked Rendezvous with Rama as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn the year 2130, a mysterious and apparently untenanted alien spaceship, Rama, enters our solar system. The first product of an alien civilisation to be encountered by man, it reveals a world of technological marvels and an unparalleled artificial ecology.\n\nBut what is its purpose in 2131?\n\nWho is inside it?\n\nAnd why?\n\nPreview\n\nA Wizard of Earthsea\n\nBy Ursula K. Le Guin,\n\nFrom my list on stories about naming and language.\n\nBy Stephen B. Heard Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by the names of people and things. Why do we use the names we do? What do they mean? Who made them up? Is there power in knowing something’s name? I later discovered that all these questions are very old—the idea that names have power goes back at least to ancient Egypt. When I became a biology professor, I found that my students and colleagues mostly didn’t know or care why animals and plants have the Latin names they do. But those names are fascinating, and there are stories to uncover whenever we tug on a name’s meaning like a loose thread.\n\nStephen's book list on stories about naming and language\n\nWhy did Stephen love this book?\n\nI know, another “children’s book”—but another with plenty to say to me as an adult (and later books in the series are more obviously oriented to older readers). The adventures of the young man Sparrowhawk at a wizarding school dive deeply into the power of names and naming. (Earthsea predates by 30 years that other boy-coming-of-age-at-wizard-school book.)\n\nI love the richly detailed fantasy world, with a society that’s like ours but also not, and the wise but real characters with human failings they struggle to overcome. Along the way, there are lots of interesting ideas about language. I still get lost in the world of Earthsea, as I do in a few other books.\n\nBy Ursula K. Le Guin,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n19 authors picked A Wizard of Earthsea as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe first book of Earthsea in a beautiful hardback edition. Complete the collection with The Tombs of Atuan, The Furthest Shore and Tehanu\n\nWith illustrations from Charles Vess\n\n'[This] trilogy made me look at the world in a new way, imbued everything with a magic that was so much deeper than the magic I'd encountered before then. This was a magic of words, a magic of true speaking' Neil Gaiman\n\n'Drink this magic up. Drown in it. Dream it' David Mitchell\n\nGed, the greatest sorcerer in all Earthsea, was called Sparrowhawk in his reckless youth.\n\nHungry for power and knowledge,…\n\nPreview\n\nSmall Gods\n\nBy Terry Pratchett,\n\nFrom my list on cultivating meaning in the face of societal absurdity.\n\nBy Robert Pettus Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nGrowing up in a rural area influenced by both Protestantism and Catholicism, I found that the daily habits of devoutly religious people were often contradictory to the basic practices of their religion. I also discovered that people were every day forced to adjust their beliefs and behaviors depending on which microcosm within the culture they were in at a given moment participating. People unable to play by these ever-shifting cultural rules would quickly lose respect. This scared the hell out of me, as I was never good at adjusting to different social situations on the fly, but I also found it interesting, and it therefore became the primary theme of my book.\n\nRobert's book list on cultivating meaning in the face of societal absurdity\n\nWhy did Robert love this book?\n\nMost all of Terry Pratchett’s books do an excellent job of turning absurdity into humor while remaining thought provoking, and this one is probably my favorite.\n\nIn terms of style and humor, I really found myself thinking of Kurt Vonnegut and Douglas Adams while reading this, which is obviously good company to be in. Essentially, the book deals with the question: “What happens to religion when no one believes in its God?”\n\nBy Terry Pratchett,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Small Gods as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFans of Sir Terry Pratchett will love this stunning graphic novel adaptation of his bestselling standalone Discworld novel Small Gods. Beautifully brought to life by illustrator Ray Friesen, it takes a close look at religion's institutions, its people, its practices and its role in politics in Pratchett's unique way...\n\n'An intriguing satire on institutionalized religion corrupted by power...' - Independent\n\n'Deftly weaves themes of forgiveness, belief and spiritual regeneration' - The Times\n\n'I loved this book. I wish it could go on and on and on because it was so enjoyable to read. I wish more books are like this…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\nBy Douglas Adams,\n\nFrom my list on when you really need to get away, without actually getting away.\n\nBy Ben Forta Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI read and write lots and love doing so. So when I need a break, the last thing I want is another book, right? Wrong! I take a break with books, and I love fun books that are an escape from the normal day-to-day, ones that won’t lull you to sleep, ones that end too quickly. It’s a sickness, I know, and I’ll deal with it as soon as I have worked through this pile of books on my desk.\n\nBen's book list on when you really need to get away, without actually getting away\n\nWhy did Ben love this book?\n\nOh, what’s not to love? Space travel, poetry writing aliens, a criminal galactic president, the end of the world, a depressed robot … this book has it all, and I reread it (and the other 4 volumes in the trilogy, yes, trilogy) every year or so.\n\nThis is a fun escape, I discovered this volume as a kid, fell in love with it, and it’s my favorite book still to this day all these centuries later.\n\nBy Douglas Adams,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n34 authors picked The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis box set contains all five parts of the' trilogy of five' so you can listen to the complete tales of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod Bebblebrox and Marvin the Paranoid Android!

I’m glad I did. The world-building and lore that is woven into this genre truly sets it apart from the usual stuff. On top of needing an intricate technological imagination that has some grounding in the real world, these kinds of books also need to have characters that are believable and a narrative that is not so futuristic that it strains credulity. It’s a tough mix to get right, but when I find a story that nails these aspects it really immerses me into the world and narrative like nothing else.\n\nKaeleb's book list on sci-fi fantasy crime stories that will blow your mind\n\nWhy did Kaeleb love this book?\n\nI enjoy this book because it essentially serves as a link between the older 60s post-modernist dystopian science fiction and the more contemporary, technology-driven, emotionally burdened weariness that has characterised authors since the 80s.\n\nThis book was outstanding; I found it impossible to stop reading. Gibson masterfully crafts an edge and tension that permeates the entire story, gripping the reader and refusing to let go.\n\nArguably, Neuromancer not only defined its genre but also left a noticeable imprint on literature and film ever since.\n\nBy William Gibson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n10 authors picked Neuromancer as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe book that defined the cyberpunk movement, inspiring everything from The Matrix to Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nThe sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.\n\nWilliam Gibson revolutionised science fiction in his 1984 debut Neuromancer. The writer who gave us the matrix and coined the term 'cyberspace' produced a first novel that won the Hugo, Nebula and Philip K. Dick Awards, and lit the fuse on the Cyberpunk movement.\n\nMore than three decades later, Gibson's text is as stylish as ever, his noir narrative still glitters like chrome in the shadows and his depictions of…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Golden Compass\n\nBy Philip Pullman,\n\nFrom my list on YA books that do not insult our intelligence.\n\nBy Johnny B. Truant Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always had a healthy dose of skepticism, having been a scientist before I was an author. I look for the con when something’s too good to be true, even in fiction…so don’t insult me by saying, “a magic amulet that makes everyone nice all the time.” If you want me to believe in pixie dust, tell me what’s in place to keep pixie dust smugglers from rigging the system. I raised smart, critical-minded kids, so I always pointed them to my own favorite young-audience books: those that felt real, even if they were fantastical, instead of ones with the more common “just trust me” attitude.\n\nJohnny's book list on YA books that do not insult our intelligence\n\nWhy did Johnny love this book?\n\nI love how Lyra’s world is so different from ours, yet doesn’t require a huge leap of faith to believe. The science-like attention to detail somehow makes it sensible. Are there talking polar bears who shape metal with their paws and claws? Yes. Are my objections to that bizarre idea addressed so well that I accept it as normal? Also yes.\n\nThe amount of thought put into the world makes the unreal feel very real, in other words. Yes, there are subtle magical forces, witches, and humans tethered to literal spirit animals…but scientists have studied and invented machines to work with all of it the same way we work with forces in our own world that we don’t understand. This series respects its readers' intelligence, regardless of age.\n\nBy Philip Pullman,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n29 authors picked The Golden Compass as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe first volume in Philip Pullman's groundbreaking\n\nHIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy, now a thrilling, critically\n\nacclaimed BBC/HBO television series. First published\n\nin 1995, and acclaimed as a modern masterpiece, this first\n\nbook in the series won the UK's top awards for children's literature.\n\n\"Without this child, we shall all\n\ndie.\"\n\nLyra Belacqua and her animal daemon live\n\nhalf-wild and carefree among scholars of Jordan College, Oxford.\n\nThe destiny that awaits her will take her to the frozen lands\n\nof the Arctic, where witch-clans reign and ice-bears fight.\n\nHer extraordinary journey will have immeasurable consequences\n\nfar beyond her own world...\n\nThis…\n\nPreview\n\nRingworld\n\nBy Larry Niven,\n\nWhy did Stefan love this book?\n\nSet in man’s far future and vast in scope, I was plunged into this novel without managing to catch my breath. This is science fiction that epitomizes the best in the genre: a powerful story, strong characters, vast vision, and lots of drama.\n\nIt is a hard book to put down, and I did not want to! I enjoyed the intricate tapestry the story weaves and, importantly, entertains. The interaction between the main characters is vividly real, as are genuine emotions vented when it is revealed an alien species manipulated man’s development. I would be kind of sore at that as well. This novel left me appreciating powerful writing and gave me a lot to think about, influencing my own writing.\n\nBy Larry Niven,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked Ringworld as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPierson's puppeteers, strange, three-legged, two-headed aliens, have discovered an immense structure in a hitherto unexplored part of the universe. Frightened of meeting the builders of such a structure, the puppeteers set about assembling a team consisting of two humans, a puppeteer and a kzin, an alien not unlike an eight-foot-tall, red-furred cat, to explore it. The artefact is a vast circular ribbon of matter, some 180 million miles across, with a sun at its centre - the Ringworld. But the expedition goes disastrously wrong when the ship crashlands and its motley crew faces a trek across thousands of miles of…\n\nPreview\n\nRevenger\n\nBy Alastair Reynolds,\n\nWhy did James love this book?\n\nRevenger is a ripping space pirate yarn, but grounded in solid science. Amid all the yo-ho-ho tropes it includes a gripping section in which a rag-tag crew of scavengers penetrate into a sealed asteroid tomb-world. They must survive perils, find what they're looking for, and get out before it seals itself up again. I expect this book will be considered a classic in future decades.\n\nBy Alastair Reynolds,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Revenger as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe galaxy has seen great empires rise and fall. Planets have shattered and been remade. Amongst the ruins of alien civilisations, building our own from the rubble, humanity still thrives.\n\nAnd there are vast fortunes to be made, if you know where to find them . . .\n\nCaptain Rackamore and his crew do. It's their business to find the tiny, enigmatic worlds which have been hidden away, booby-trapped, surrounded with layers of protection - and to crack them open for the ancient relics and barely-remembered technologies inside. But while they ply their risky trade with integrity, not everyone is…\n\nPreview\n\nStarplex\n\nBy Robert J. Sawyer,\n\nWhy did Steven love this book?\n\nThe book starts small(ish).\n\nA single starship crewed by three different species and captained by a human explores space using a series of wormholes created by… whom, exactly? No one knows.\n\nThen an unknown ship with no visible propulsion system drops out of a wormhole and we're catapulted into an adventure that brings us to the mind-twisting origins of the universe as we know it.\n\nRob Sawyer lives across the river from me in Canada, and we ran into each other at several local science fiction conventions.\n\nHe gave me a copy of Starplex, and I accepted it with a vague, “I look forward to reading it.” I didn’t actually intend to. But a couple weeks later, I idly flipped it open and started reading—and couldn’t stop.\n\nBy Robert J. Sawyer,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Starplex as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTwenty years after the discovery of artificial wormholes launches Earth space exploration to unforeseeable heights, Starplex Director Keith Lansing investigates a mysterious vessel that soon threatens the station with intergalactic war. Original.\n\nPreview\n\nAll the Colors of Love\n\nBy Jessica Freely,\n\nWhy did Steven love this book?\n\nI actually got to read this book before it was published because Jessica Freely was in my writer's group.\n\nI fell in love with the characters and was thrilled whenever we got a new chapter. The plot twists and turns, and the finale is nail-biting suspense with mind-altering twists along the way.\n\nIt’s a book I wish I had written. Jessica passed away last year, but this novel is a powerful legacy.\n\nBy Jessica Freely,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked All the Colors of Love as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIt sucks being the son of a super villain.
