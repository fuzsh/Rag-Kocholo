        "text": "Who Goes There?\n\nIf any one author is to be associated with a subgenre, it wouldn’t be outrageous to associate Harry Turtledove with the alternate history subgenre. He didn’t invent it by any means (he explicitly pays respects to L. Sprague de Camp on that front), but Turtledove has, over the past four decades, worked more prolifically in alternate history than any other writer. If someone brings up what-if scenarios for the American Civil War wherein the Confederacy won it’s likely Turtledove will get mentioned at some point. He’s also a prolific Twitter user. Since Turtledove turned 75 this month I figured I should review something of his, and “Autubon in Atlantis” is a concise and decent (if not great) example of his specialty. As is to be expected, this is an alternate history story, really only nominally SF, in which the real-life 19th century naturalist John James Autubon returns to an Atlantis which is very much real, albeit lacking the magic in so many depictions. Seems like a random combination of subjects (I’m not even sure I’d heard of Autubon before this), but actually reading the novella, I got a whiff of autobiography, making it both personal and compelling.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the December 2005 issue of Analog Science Fiction, which is not available online. It’s since been reprinted in The Year’s Best Science Fiction: Twenty-Third Annual Collection (ed. Gardner Dozois) and the Turtledove collection Atlantis and Other Places.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nThe year is 1843, and John Autubon and his friend Ed Harris Edward Harris are about to leave a decidedly French-occupied New Orleans (it’s unclear if the United States were ever founded in this timeline) for an expedition. They board the steamer Maid of Orleans whereon Harris meets up with a woman with whom he seems to be in a friends-with-benefits relationship, although Autubon, being a good Catholic and loyally married, just rolls his eyes at his friend. (It’s worth mentioning that Harris was also a real person who really did accompany Autubon on his travels.) “Audubon admired a pretty lady as much as anyone—more than most, for with his painter’s eye he saw more than most—but was a thoroughly married man, and didn’t slide from admiration to pursuit.” This early stretch of the novella shows us the somewhat vitriolic friendship between the two middle-aged men, but also gives us a glimpse into this somewhat altered 1843, in which the Louisiana Purchase apparently never happened and Atlantis as a landmass not only exists but serves as a place for human settlement. Autubon and Harris complement each other such that the former is the brains while the latter is the brawn, Autubon being an artist while Harris fancies himself a hunter—an introvert and an extrovert respectively.\n\nAutubon sails to Atlantis to draw some local birds there, but he also voyages out with the expectation that this might be his final trip to Atlantis; he’s deep in his fifties at this point, and is paranoid that he hasn’t much longer to live. “Audubon wondered if he had ten years left, or even five, let alone a hundred.” The real-life Autubon would die in 1851, aged 65, which in those days would’ve been a fine old age; but given that he’s traveling with Harris, who was about a decade younger, it’s easy to understand how Autubon would feel insecure about his own age. We’re shown in several ways how Autubon and Harris act as foils for each other, and how the latter unintentionally makes Autubon think of the man he could’ve been; but Autubon simply doesn’t have the temperament to be a big game hunter or mountain man, nor even to sleep around were he not already married. This resentment builds somewhat over the course of the story but never boils over, and I’m not sure if that’s for the best or not. If this story has an Achilles’s heel, aside from the occasional clunkiness of Turtledove’s style (this is already a short novella, but you could probably cut a whole page or two of just redundancies), it’s the lack of actual drama or even tangible stakes. Turtledove tries to inject stakes into the thing once we get to Atlantis, but the result ends up being a lot more melancholic than thrilling—which I’m willing to concede may be the point. This story clocks in at about maybe 20,000 words but could’ve definitely been shortened to a novelette.\n\nAside from our two leads there are only a few incidental characters, such as Harris’s lady friend on the steamboat and later Gordon Coates, “the man who published his work in Atlantis,” who appears for a bit of exposition but is otherwise not much of a character. For the most part this is a two-man show, which in itself is not exactly a problem. Butcher’s Crossing is just four dudes in the wilderness for at least half of its 260-page duration and that worked out fine. Obviously the other “characters” that are supposed to fill the void are the local wildlife of Atlantis, namely the red-crested eagle and Canada geese, the latter usually being called honkers (I struggle to get my mind out of the gutter when the characters call these birds “honkers”), with the red-crested eagle going after other birds for food. Atlantis used to be more abundant with native life, but a mix of human settlement and rat infestation has endangered the natural order of things. “Atlantean creatures had no innate fear of man. The lack cost them dearly.” The “upside” to this is that going gaming, or hunting for the sake of drawing the native life, is not that dangerous. Still, it’s a nasty situation which sends Autubon into a crisis of conscience, on top of his anxiety over the fact that he’s no longer a spring chicken. The way Autubon works is he doesn’t try drawing live birds, but rather has them killed first and uses wiring to pose the corpses, such that he can draw a still subject and try to give the impression of what the bird would’ve looked like in life. In the days before photography became both widespread and practical this would’ve been the best way (or at least Autubon’s preferred way) of capturing wildlife for research, not to mention artwork.\n\nSo there’s the dilemma: in order to draw his subjects accurately Autubon has to kill them first. This in itself is far from ideal, but you also has an ecosystem that’s being endangered, with the red-crested eagle possibly being on the verge of extinction. Autubon’s passion as an artist and scientist butts heads with the reality that his work requires him to toy with lives which may be on the brink of extinction. This is, at its heart, the problem of all would-be settlers: the destruction of the natural environment which comes from human industry. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the steamboat in the story’s opening stretch is framed in a rather unflattering light, as are the guns Autubon and Harris take for their expedition, including “newfangled” revolvers. This focusing on the environmental ramifications of colonialism is a double-edged sword. On the one hand it’s rather convenient that there’s no indigenous human popular on Atlantis, such that Our Heroes™ don’t have to worry about the abuses settlers inflict on indigenous peoples; maybe Turtledove did this to keep his leads sympathetic, or maybe it just wasn’t considered. But then by focusing wholly on man’s relationship with nature (of the man vs. man/man vs. self/man vs. nature options the story goes with the second and third), Turtledove is able to zero in on the inherent tragedy of Autubon’s profession; that he chooses to not provide a clear answer to this dilemma is not a mistake but simply a choice. As such the story ends up being less about plot and more about… vibes. Autubon’s brooding. You may or may not have a soft spot for such a thing.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nGiven the story’s rather episodic and amorphous structure it’s actually hard to spoil, so I’ll leave just it at that.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nIf science fiction can be considered a marriage between art and the sciences then “Autubon in Atlantis” is quintessentially a science fiction story, even if it reads closer to historical fiction or even late 19th century adventure fiction than SF. Undoubtedly it’s a throwback to an extent, with Turtledove even using some outdated terminology to better fit the setting (the third-person narrator calls black people in New Orleans “Negroes,” which can be jarring from a modern perspective, but would’ve been perfectly innocuous in 1843), and so I can’t say I’m surprised that it was published in Analog. Taking its faults into account, it’s still an effective story in that it raises lay interest in a historical subject most people would not know anything about. I certainly knew nothing about John Autubon before reading Turtledove’s story, but now I have this absurd feeling (as I’m sure Turtledove felt when writing it) that Audubon was a kindred spirit. This is basically what I think historical fiction should do: make people of the past seem like we could’ve gotten to know them—not as footnotes but as people.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nWe last covered Greg Egan with his 2002 quantum computing novella “Singleton,” which was very typical Egan; now we have something more atypical. Egan is one of the quintessential transhumanist writers in SF and one of the leading figures of the post-cyberpunk era in the ’90s; but “Oceanic” is not cyberpunk at all. Here we have a coming-of-age story on an alien planet, about a young man’s crisis of faith through both religion and sex, apparently inspired by Egan’s own disillusionment with Christianity in his youth as recounted in his autobiographical essay “Born Again, Briefly,” which I highly recommend reading as a kind of double feature with “Oceanic.” Indeed despite the exotic locale this reads as one of Egan’s most personal works, and while it isn’t cyberpunk it does manage to veer back into some go-to Egan themes. The gambit paid off, as it remains Egan’s single most decorated story, having won the Hugo for Best Novella as well as placed first in the Locus and Asimov’s readers’ polls for that year. It might also be my favorite Egan story I’ve read so far.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the August 1998 issue of Asimov’s Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. Gardner Dozois liked this story so much he bought it for Asimov’s, but then reprinted it in The Year’s Best Science Fiction: Sixteenth Annual Collection and The Best of the Best Volume 2: 20 Years of the Year’s Best Short Science Fiction Novels. It’s in the Egan collection Oceanic, and of course it’s also in The Best of Greg Egan. You can read it free online at Egan’s site, so you don’t have an excuse!\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nSometimes when I’m reviewing a story I feel like I’m struggling to come up with things to say about it, but with “Oceanic” there’s no such problem—especially if you know how autobiographical it is. But first some context. We’re on the planet Covenant, over a thousand years after humanoids (I say “humanoids” because it doesn’t look like normal humans had come to the planet in the first place), and we follow Martin, who as narrator is writing what you might call a fictional memoir, recounting from the time he was about ten to when he was deep in his twenties. Martin and his family are “Freelanders,” in that they live on the vast waters of the planet, unlike the “Firmlanders” who live primarily on land. Martin’s family are Transitional, that is to say mildly religious, but Martin’s older brother, Daniel, joins the Deep Church, a fundamentalist sect, when he’s fifteen (David being five years Martin’s senior). Daniel tries to convert Martin, and in a scene ripped straight from Egan’s own life (his older brother having split from their Anglican family and converted to Catholicism as a teenager), the two kneel by Martin’s bed one night and pray to Beatrice, the Christ-like figure of the religion. But Martin hasn’t really been converted yet. “I wasn’t sure that I wanted Beatrice to change my mind, and I was afraid that this display of fervour might actually persuade Her.” The practice starts as more out of respect for Daniel than believing his faith, but Martin will soon go through a rite of passage that will turn him into a firm believer—for a while. This is all told with melancholy hindsight.\n\n“Oceanic” is a coming-of-age narrative, or a bildungsroman, about a boy crossing the shadow-line (to steal Conrad) into maturity—a crossing that tends to be not one experience but several key turning points. The first major turning point for Martin is arguably not kneeling with Daniel that one night, but taking part in the Drowning, a ritual in which someone is submerged in the depths of Covenant’s waters—so far down that it would seem suicidal, and yet this near-death experience is euphoric, at least if the person accepts Beatrice in their heart. Martin is Drowned one day, with Daniel as his second, and this experience in the depths, by his lonesome, makes him feel like he’s somehow become one with Beatrice. A switch gets flipped inside his head. Getting Drowned is something only the Deep Church people do, as others see it as dangerous and an aberration, something fundamentalists do; but his Drowning causes a religious awakening in Martin. As he struggles in the depths he recounts the story of Beatrice and the “Angels” as written in the Scriptures. This is where things gets pretty strange, and dense, in the sense that Egan seems to have developed a whole origin story for the people of this planet—one that is clearly adjacent to Christianity, although there’s a transhumanist twist that’s more implied than explained. While submerged, Martin takes in a gulp of the seawater, and at this moment light floods his vision, leaving “a violet afterimage” once it recedes and Daniel brings him back to the surface, the Drowning successful.\n\nThe irony is that after this point Martin and Daniel’s relationship weakens, granted that part of this is to be expected given their age gap. Martin gets involved with Daniel’s Prayer Group, but soon grows tired of it. “What did I have in common with them, really?” The brothers grow apart. Daniel gets married young to a fellow Deep Church person named Agnes and the two lead a boring, traditional life thereafter. Some years pass and now Martin’s a teenager. It’s at this point that I should probably mention the eccentric biology of the humans in this story. Something I noticed only after the fact is that Egan refrains from giving physical descriptions of characters really, and this could be for a few reasons, but one reason I can think of is that the characters are physically androgynous—they, in fact, have physical traits of both male and female, and even functioning sex organs that would normally be unique to either. They’re true hermaphrodites, “women and men were made indistinguishable in the sight of God.” What gender someone identifies as really does come down to their self-perception rather than their sex. I’m bringing this up now because it’ll soften the blow for when we get to what is perhaps the most important scene in the story—and also the most unusual. When Daniel gets married Martin meets up with one of Agnes’s cousins, Lena, a Firmlander who nonetheless is very interested in the way Freelanders live. The two hit it off and enter a sort of casual relationship, and it doesn’t take long for sex to enter the picture.\n\nSo, in a bildungsroman, it’s not uncommon for the protagonist’s first sexual experience to serve as a turning point in the narrative, as a euphoric or traumatic experience. One’s first time is rarely all that. I myself didn’t lose my virginity till I was 21, and it was with someone I was not in a relationship with; it was a one-time thing, but the important thing is that we were nice to each other and there was certainly no pain in it. A lot of people aren’t so lucky. Poor Martin over here has one of the strangest first times possible—not because the sex with Lena goes wrong exactly but because there’s a certain part of the exchange nobody had thought to warn him about in advance. Remember how I said that the people of Covenant are hermaphrodites? Not only that, but the penis is apparently detachable. If sex happens between someone with a penis and someone with a vagina there’s a literal exchange of “the bridge,” so that after he climaxes inside Lena Martin finds, to his horror, that Lena now has his cock and that Martin, with blood on his groin, finds that a pussy has formed where his cock once was. (There’s no mention of testicles that I can recall—and no, don’t ask me to go back through to see if there is. I would have to think then that the testes are internal, somehow, but still functional. For better or worse Egan doesn’t go into great detail as to how the anatomy of these future humans could function. The effect is akin to one of Dali’s paintings, or one of the more nightmarish scenes in a Buñuel film.) Eventually Martin and Lena have sex a second time so that Martin can get his dick back; but the relationship has done sour because of that first time and they seemingly never talk again.\n\nA lot is happening, so let’s rewind the film and take this step by step. We’re never outright told this I believe, but it’s implied pretty heavily, even early on, that the humans on Covenant are the descendants of the so-called Angels, who apparently had foregone flesh-and-blood bodies but then decided to build organic yet artificial bodies for themselves so that they could experience bodily pleasures and even mortality again. The Angels, being basically noncorporeal, are now spoken of as if they were literal angels, the “present” of the story being so far into our future that even the far future of the Angels is spoken of as if it were ancient history or myth. Egan has gone out of his to imagine a future humanity that in some ways is not so different from us, but then there’s the biology of these people. Martin losing his virginity is a traumatic event for more than one reason: it gives him gender dysphoria, makes him feel ashamed because he’s had not only had sex while unmarried but lost his “bridge” in the process, and it’s the first time in his life where the hard reality of biology shakes his faith. I probably should’ve also mentioned “Oceanic” nearly made the shortlist for the Tiptree Award. Now, transphobes might read this story and be repulsed by its implications, because it becomes obvious that, as is regularly the case with Egan’s fiction, biology is framed as tyrannical. Martin and his kind are not beholden to biology but victims of it. (I saw someone theorize that Greg Egan is actually a woman, and while it’s true we’ve never seen or heard Egan, I find this a bit far-fetched.) Indeed Martin deciding to study microbiology, under an affable but ultimately dead-end professor named Barat, will prove to make him only more miserable.\n\nSomething I’ve had to do in writing this review is go back through “Oceanic” and reread some passages, which I’m not prone to doing for these—in no small part because I know with certainty there are details I had missed on my first reading. On the one hand you could try boiling this story down to a “religion sucks” narrative, but that really would not be doing the world Egan has built justice, nor would it encapsulate the thematic depths. Granted that showing “Oceanic” to a transphobic Christian would disgruntle them, it’s more a dramatization of Egan’s own coming of age; this is his Go Tell It on the Mountain. A mild criticism I have of Egan’s writing is that when it comes to first-person narrators they tend to have more or less the same voice, which I have to take to some extent as Egan’s own voice: brooding, seemingly teetering on the line between macho and a little feminine, a sort of overly sensitive film noir detective cadence. Martin might be the most Egan-ish of Egan narrators, and yet rather than distract me this ended up being more of an asset than a negative—indeed Martin being the quintessential Egan narrator might well be the whole point. The result is that despite not having anything to do (at least directly, though it’s very much part of the backstory) with computing or quantum uncertainty, “Oceanic” manages to be thematically kin with Egan’s other work, even if on the surface it seems to hark to a kind of old-school planetary science fiction. As someone who’s not very literate in computer science (like most people) I thus found it accessible by Egan’s standards.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nAs he ages Martin distances himself more from organized religion—first from the Deep Church and even the Transitionals, increasingly finding fault and hypocrisy in the arguments of theologians. Among his own scientific colleagues he finds himself siding more with the earnest atheists than with whom he sees as weak-willed believers. “Theology aside, the whole dynamics of the group was starting to get under my skin; maybe I’d be better off spending my time in the lab, impressing Barat with my dedication to his pointless fucking microbes.” And then tragedy strikes. Martin’s mom comes down with a severe illness, and by the time he gets to hospital she has already died. Daniel was there, but this ends up being the final straw for Martin’s perception of him, for according to Daniel’s own faith their mother is destined for Hell since she was never drowned; but upon confronting him about this bit of theology Martin finds that his fundamentalist older brother has softened—for his own sake if nobody else’s. “There was no truth in anything he said, anything he believed. It was all just an expression of his own needs.” By this point Martin has become one of those devout but rebelliously individualistic religious people, but even his personal faith has been eroding, slowly but surely. “The God of the gaps,” to use an edgy atheist phrase. What breaks the camel’s back turns out to be Martin’s own work in the microbes of Covenant’s oceans.\n\nSo, to make a long story short, the microbes in the planet’s water have this hallucinatory fucky-wucky effect if taken into one’s body in concentrated form. The humans on Covenant have adapted to these microbes in moderation, but it’s still dangerous to interact with too much, which would explain the religious experiences had by those who have Drowned. Martin’s religiousus experience, which he had kept close to his heart all these years even as his understanding of the natural world expanded, has a scientific explanation: he saw some freaky shit because he had inhaled a concentrated amount of these microbes. It’s like the SFnal version of how people who suffer from epilepsy are prone to having “religious” visions—or indeed people with schizophrenia who claim to be in touch with the divine. Biology has its way with Martin; it caresses him, withers him, takes the moon and the sun from him, takes what is in front of him and even behind from him, and at the end of the day it takes God from him.\n\nI was lucky: I’d been born in an era of moderation. I hadn’t killed in the name of Beatrice. I hadn’t suffered for my faith. I had no doubt that I’d been far happier for the last fifteen years than I would have been if I’d told Daniel to throw his rope and weights overboard without me.\n\nBut that didn’t change the fact that the heart of it all had been a lie.\n\nAt age 25 Martin becomes an atheist, incidentally around the same age when Egan gave up his own faith. This is not a victory for atheism or any dumb bullshit like that, but rather a melancholy crossing of the shadow-line, from youth to manhood. Something is lost and gained, at the same time, like a passing of the torch. While “Oceanic” is by no means Egan’s first “mature” story (he had already written Permutation City and Disapora at this point, not to mention some pretty great short fiction), it’s a reflection on the artist (or the scientist, who anyway is adjacent to the artist) coming into his own. Maturity is not sunshine and rainbows.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nI ended up reading “Born Again, Briefly” after I had read “Oceanic” but before starting this review, which turned out to be a good idea since it helped explain the strong personal touch of this story. It’s also a bit of a mind-bender, but not for the reasons typically associated with Egan, in that you don’t have to be an amateur computer programmer to understand the point he’s trying to make. Still, it’s a dense novella that almost demands a second reading, for pleasure but also so one can soak in all the details. Egan could’ve gone farther with the gender aspect, but for 1998 it’s still pretty wild and forward-thinking. People forget that even in 1998, which for some of you was not that long ago, queer representation in SF was very… mixed. And also nearly always evidently from a cishet perspective. With that in mind, “Oceanic” has aged pretty gracefully; it also happens to be a story people new to Egan can read without issue.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nMichael Shea had a pretty interesting career, being one of those authors who started out writing novels before branching out to short fiction; his first novel, A Quest for Simbilis, preceded his first short story by a few years. The result is that by the time of his first short stories he was already a seasoned writer, although I’m still surprised that his most famous story, “The Autopsy,” was only his third published. Today’s story is his fourth. I have to admit I feel bad, because I don’t have a great deal to say about “Polyphemus.” Not to say it’s a bad story—it’s a curious throwback that tries to combine Golden Age planetary adventure with scientific plausibility, plus a generis dose of symbolism and literary references. It can be thought of as almost a companion piece to “The Autopsy,” being concerned with alien biology and, to some extent, an SF-horror hybrid, although “Polyphemus” leans much more on the Sf side of the equation.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the August 1981 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. It’s been reprinted only a few times, in The 1982 Annual World’s Best SF (ed. Arthur W. Saha and Donald A. Wollheim), and the Shea collections Polyphemus and The Autopsy and Other Stories. The former has gotten a very recent reprint from Valancourt Books—so recent ISFDB hasn’t consistently listed yet.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nHumans have begun colonizing the planet Firebairn, which is technically hospitable but not exactly welcoming, what with the volcanic activity and the sea life. We have a “sand-hog,” a ship with a few smaller scout boats attached, along with a crew of people hunting “delphs,” which are the native food of choice for the colonists. It’s here we run into our first problem with the story, which is that within the first few pages we’re introduced to over half a dozen characters, a few of whom have no personality to speak of. We have Captain Helion, technically the leader of the expedition although he ends up not being the protagonist. We have Nemo Jones, who does end up being the closest this story has to a protagonist, along with his love interest Sarissa Wayne. We have Japhet Sparks, the ship’s cartographer. We have Orson Waverly, a biologist who will come to be the story’s leading expert on that language we avid readers know: Expositionese. And there are several other named characters I don’t care to dwell on.\n\nMind you that this is a short novella, and we’re expected to become familiar with at least a few of these characters. Obviously the same can’t be said for some others, since early on we lose a couple redshirts to the monster Waverly comes to call Polyphemus—after the cyclops. It’s fitting, considering the giant tentacled alien the colonists face off with also has one eye, and turns out to be not a very intelligent creature, instead basing its power on size and a complex sensory network. Polyphemus is a carnivore and a competitor for the delph food supply, on top of seeing the humans as potential prey. Thus we have a basic conflict of those who want to kill the alien juxtaposed with Waverly, who wants to study Polyphemus more than kill it. Of course, trying to understand how the monster works on the inside may be the key to killing it, which is how we get into lengthy passages of scientific jargon, most of which (it shames me to say) flew over my head. It would be inaccurate to call this story “hard” SF, but it takes a modern (for the time) approach to what would’ve been an old-fashioned premise even in the early ’80s. Funny thing is that is “Polyphemus” is an update of an Campbellian space adventure published in 1941, there’s now more of a time gap between “Polyphemus” and now than “Polyphemus” and that hypothetical story. The “modernized” update now seems to be old-fashioned itself.\n\nLet’s talk references. Polyphemus itself is named after a cyclops in Greek mythology; and speaking of Greek mythology, we have a piece of equipment called a medusa, which contributes to the climax. Nemo Jones is presumably named after Captain Nemo of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, although he has very little in common with his namesake. And of course any story of this nature is gonna invoke comparisons with Moby-Dick and, more recently (indeed it would’ve been recent when Shea wrote the story), Jaws. Here’s the problem: the actual whale-hunting in Moby-Dick takes up maybe a third of the novel. If you were to cut Moby-Dick down to “the essentials” you would be left with a brisk 250-page adventure on the high seas—and also a far less interesting novel. There’s so much character and world depth (never mind the beauty of Melville’s language) you would be missing out on that you may as well be reading a different novel. And at the same time “Polyphemus” is too long for having such a simple plot and such thinly drawn characters, which I understand sounds like a contradiction to what I had just said. Take for instance the romance subplot between Nemo and Sarissa: we know basically nothing about either of these characters, the result being that we aren’t allowed to care much if they live to reunite at the end. This could be fixed by either removing the subplot, if we were to shorten “Polyphemus” by several thousand words, or we could flesh it out if we expanded the story into a full novel—only that would raise more problems.\n\nMy point is that Shea was ambitious with this one, and yet somehow he also didn’t go far enough. It lacks the perfect self-containment (never mind the layers) of “The Autopsy,” but it’s also possible I’m just saying that now and might feel different later. It’s possible I’m underestimating this story and as such am not putting the necessary work into it.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nI wish I had more to say…\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nA criticism I often throw at modern SF novels is that they could’ve been shorter; we don’t necessarily need something to be 500 pages. This also sometimes applies to novellas, such as “Polyphemus,” which is about 20,000 to 22,000 words but could’ve been finessed with to have been turned into a novelette, or about the same length as “The Autopsy.” There are a few too many characters and ultimately there’s not enough of a plot to chew on. Shea’s attempt at making the movie monster at the heart of the story seem scientifically plausible is worth commending, but ultimately Prometheus is still that—a movie monster. Similarly the characters are a case of spreading too little peanut butter over too wide a slice of bread, so that the humans at times also seem like their B-movie counterparts. It’s possible I’ll come away feeling different on an eventual future reread, but my first impression left me sort of at a loss. Sorry to say.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nIt’s May 3, 2024, and I’m being forced to live in interesting times. College students are protesting an ongoing genocide in a country that the federal government and American military contractors support, and the antediluvian head of state is calling for protests—not real protests, but more like when a bunch of people sit in a circle and chat like it’s a fucking book club or AA meeting. Conservatives want protesters’ skulls crushed, liberals also want protesters’ skulls crushed but are usually much more “polite” about wishing violence upon people who were born literally this century and who are committing the “crime” of being disgusted with American complicity in atrocities. And worst of all, it’s an election year. Is this 2024 or 1968? You may be thinking, “Brian, you’re being awfully political right now, and also you’re dating your review.” You’re right on both counts. In fact I dated it at the very start. Of course people might not know about this blog in five years, or even know what America is—or was.\n\nNot that the above is strictly irrelevant either, since today’s story is also about the folly and immorality of empire, although its conclusion is much more optimistic than what I’ve been able to consider for the current real-world situation. I haven’t said anything about April Smith yet because unfortunately I can’t say anything about April Smith, although I can say a good deal about the fact that I have nothing to say about her. Smith has two stories to her name, with “Birthright” being her only solo work, and in neither case do we get any biographical information in the introductory blurb. We don’t know when she was born or when she (probably) died, where she grew up, what non-genre work she might’ve done, or even if “April Smith” is her real name. She is, like too many lady authors who were active in ’50s genre SF, a ghost of that era.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the August 1955 issue of If, which is on the Archive. It would not be reprinted in any form for over sixty years; for better or worse Smith let it fall out of copyright, so the full story is on Project Gutenberg. It would finally be reprinted in book form in Rediscovery: Science Fiction by Women (1953-1957), editor unknown.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nCyril Kirk is an ambitious young man, top of his class, and while some dudes might want a fancy car or a high-powered gaming laptop, Kirk wants a planet that he sees as worthy of patronage. And theoretically at least he has options: the Galactic Union contains dozens of worlds, mostly for the purposes of colonization and resource mining. Unfortunately Ross, Kirk’s superior, makes him a planetary advisor on one of the most obscure and least valuable worlds in the Union: Nemar. Even someone as well-read as Kirk can’t remember this planet off the top of his head, and further research doesn’t help much. “The documents on Nemar, all the information he could dig up, confirmed Ross’s statement that the planet held nothing of commercial value.” So he’s been assigned a planet that, at least as far as the Union is concerned, is basically worthless. It won’t be a short assignment either: five mandatory years, plus five optional, although Kirk suspects he won’t be using those extra years. He won’t be the only Terran on Nemar, but that won’t help him much either, since we soon learn the people he’ll be working with are as enthusiastic about making the natives useful as he is.\n\nOnce we land on Nemar, a few things become clear: the natives have no interest in contributing to the Union, and perhaps more importantly, they seem like they have no need to. I have to stop for a second here to say that “Birthright” is overtly a narrative about colonialism, about a member of the empire trying (and spoilers, failing) to “enlighten” the indigenous population. Overall it’s a pretty progressive-minded story, actually far more left-leaning for the ’50s than I had expected, but it does also play into Orientalist fantasies, what with the natives of Nemar being perpetually semi-nude (although they consider it to be normal attire), conventionally attractive yet exotic, and they’re described several times as “naive” and “childlike.” Nemar is clearly supposed to be like a paradise, like vacationing on one of the Hawai’ian island. Incidentally it’s noted at the beginning that the natives are basically homo sapiens, just with a unique skin complexion, and that Nemar itself is very similar to the tropics on Earth. If you were to adapt “Birthright” for film or TV (and you could do that without the headache of securing rights, since it’s public domain), you would probably shoot in Hawai’i, or maybe Samoa if you’re feeling a little more adventurous. My biggest gripe with the story, aside from its lack of a solid ending (will get to that), is that while it’s a cutting criticism of colonial arrogance, this criticism is also undermined by now-outdated racial politics.\n\nWhile reading I was reminded most of Joseph Conrad, and also the movie Fitzcarraldo. Both Apocalypse Now and Fitzcarraldo are movies about arrogant white men in exotic locales, with the explicit and implicit comments on colonialism; and there’s also the fact that both are infamous “I will kill everyone on this set and then myself for the bit” movies. “Birthright” is nowhere near as daunting; if anything it comes close to being a fish-out-of-water comedy. Kirk has a native woman, Nanae, who looks after the house he’s been given, and he practically trips over his own cock trying not to ask for this woman’s hand in marriage upon first seeing her. He cannot come to terms with the fact that he is super-horny over Nanae and it embarrasses him, not least because fellow Terrans in the village (including Jeannette, an actual Earth woman) see his plight for what it is immediately. Indeed everyone seems to see right through Kirk except for Nanae, although it’s possible she knows and is too polite to say anything. The lax attitude of the other Terrans, who at this point are more expats than workers of the Union, also troubles Our Hero™, as if something in the air has changed them, made them forget their purpose here. “Somehow, the planet had infected them.” There must be some secret “weapon” the natives use to pacify the PAs, and Kirk’s gonna find out what it is.\n\nNot to get nostalgic over an era I was not even close to being alive for, but I admire that at this time in SF history you could have stories with meaty ideas that were still only short stories or novellas. Nowadays it seems like if you wanna draw any attention in the field you have to write, bare minimum, a long novella (say close to 40,000 words) that would be too lengthy for magazine publication but just the right length for an overpriced Tor chapbook. “Birthright” just barely meets the SFWA criterion for novella length and, truth be told, it could’ve been a few thousand words longer; not saying this as a negative criticism. Smith’s style is breezy and on the side of minimalist. The story can be thought of less as a “story” and more like a series of Socratic dialogues, although these dialogues individually tend to be brief and there was never a point where I wondered if or when Smith would “get on with it.” This is not an action narrative; it’s about a man’s slow but sure transformation from an agent of the empire to someone who’s wondering if his bootlicking has been worth the effort—or even if it’s been well-intentioned. Nemar is basically a socialist utopia in the mode of what Ursula K. Le Guin might’ve envisioned (which has its own problems, but we’re not getting into that today), a society where there’s no fixed hierarchy, where parents respect their children, where money seems to be a non-issue, and where’s almost no industry to speak of.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nThis leads to Kirk figuring out the planet’s “secret,” which is really that there is no secret. The natives have cultivated a society that’s founded on compassion, as opposed to most Union societies (and by extension our society) which are founded on protection of property. When Kirk tries to convince the village council on voting in favor of mining operations on the planet, the council votes no. The council’s rationale for this denial of industry is pretty hard to argue with, for both Kirk and the reader. An unnamed member of the council goes on by far the longest monologue in the story, and I may as well quote “all” of it here. I say “all” because the paragraph the monologue is a part of is even longer, if you can believe it:\n\n“As you said, the mining is very hard, disagreeable work. We feel that when you begin to do disagreeable things for an end that is not valuable in itself, you are beginning to tread a dangerous path. There is no telling where it will end. One such situation leads to another. We might end up cooped up in a room all day, shut away from the sun and air, turning bolts on an assembly line to make machines, as we have heard often happens on Terra. […] Being surrounded by technical conveniences isn’t worth that. […] On Terra and on most of the other planets we have had word of, people seem to spend their time making all kinds of things that have no value in themselves, because they can be sold or traded. Other people spend their time trying to persuade people to buy these useless things. Still other people spend all day making records of how many of these things have been sold. No! This path is not for us. […] We don’t know how it came about that all these people spend their time at these unpleasant, useless things. They can’t have wanted it that way. No human being could want to spend his time doing silly, pointless things. How could you believe in yourself? How could you walk proudly? How could you explain it to your children? We must be careful not to make the mistake of taking the first step in that direction.”\n\nSo capitalism does not flourish on the planet, at least for now. Kirk is, at least professionally speaking, a failure; but at the same time he comes to realize he may have won on a personal and moral level—that by “giving in” to the ways of these people he seems on his way to redeeming himself. He accepts that he has become like a child again. He even ponders, at the very end, the possibility of earning Nanae’s affections and returning to Earth with her. This ending sentiment is fine, but also the story doesn’t so much “end” as it comes to a stop, which bothered me initially.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nI’m sort of dismayed it took seven decades for “Birthright” to appear in book form; surely this has nothing to do with the sexism of anthology editors in the ’50s until at least the ’80s. There are some pretty rotten stories from this era that have been reprinted multiple times, but not a genuinely interesting yarn like this one. It’s flawed in a couple ways, and I wish April Smith had continued trying her hand at genre writing (this was her second story and it would be her last, at least under the April Smith name), but it shows a level of ambition not too often found in ’50s genre writing. I get pretty sentimental about the ’50s in the context of genre SF because it really was like the Klondike gold rush for pulp writers, each author looking to make some kind of living off writing what was often perceived as childish at the time, looking to get lucky and even publish a bestseller. Most of the attempts would be failures, of course, but there are so many hidden gems from this period that I’m convinced that despite being so often mined for anthologies, we have not even come close to drying this particular well.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nChristopher Priest had a pretty long and dramatic career, and it pains me that (as far as I can remember) this is the first time I’ve read any of his fiction. I tried reading his novel Inverted World a couple months ago but had a false start with it; the timing wasn’t quite right. Inverted World is one of the cult classics of ’70s SF, even getting an NYRB paperback edition. (NYRB is like the Criterion Collection for book snobs, sorry but it’s true.) His novel The Prestige would be adapted for film by Christopher Nolan, which on the one hand must’ve brought some extra attention to Priest’s work but which he also didn’t seem to appreciate much—probably because Nolan told people to not read Priest’s book before watching his movie, which you have to admit is an asshole move. Speaking of assholes, I think the first time I heard of Priest was through the decades-long wait for Harlan Ellison’s The Last Dangerous Visions, the most famous SF book to never be published—until this year. I have thoughts on that. But Priest had spearheaded the controversy over Ellison seemingly refusing to finish his anthology with an essay called “The Last Deadloss Visions,” which got Priest a Hugo nomination. Incidentally, the final version of The Last Dangerous Visions had its publication announced shortly after Priest’s death. What timing, huh? I mean what are the odds J. Michael Straczynski would announce the upcoming release for TLDV one month after the death of its most ardent critic?\n\nAnyway, “Palely Loitering” is my first Priest story, and while I’m ultimately mixed on it, I do have to admit it’s impressive. It’s a melancholy and mind-boggling time travel coming-of-age narrative that, given Locus classified it as a novella and the Hugos classified it as a novelette, seems to be one of those borderline cases in terms of length. I wish I had an ebook copy so I could run it through a word processor. I’m gonna be a bit liberal and side with Locus; it might come out to 18,000 or 18,500 words. People at the time were certainly impressed with “Palely Loitering,” as it won the British Science Fiction Award for Best Short Fiction.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the January 1979 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. It would reprinted in the Priest collection An Infinite Summer, named after the story Priest had given to Ellison for The Last Dangerous Visions and then retracted. It was anthologized in The Best Science Fiction Novellas of the Year #2 (ed. Terry Carr), The Mammoth Book of Time Travel SF (ed. Mike Ashley), and As Time Goes By (ed. Hank Davis).\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nMykle starts out as a ten-year-old boy, moody even for his age, the sole son in a well-to-do British family who sometimes wants to get away from his sisters. It’s the future, in what is called the “Neuopean” Union (Priest never explains this), and the UK seems to be stuck, or at a crossroads between different eras. “We lived in the age of starflight, but by the time I was born mankind had long lost the desire to travel in space,” Mykle tells us. A big way to pass the time is to go to Flux Channel Park, a park in the Victorian British fashion that started out as a rather quirky invention. The Park was originally a “flux-field,” built for experimental space flight, which the government decided to have converted into a tourist attraction after the last ship to be launched from the flux-field did not return after several years. The Park is basically home to a time distortion field, with the Flux Channel having three bridges, each with different time properties. One bridge acts normally, while another would send you 24 hours into the past, and the third would send you 24 hours into the future. The flux-field, the “channel” itself, is not to be played with.\n\nSo of course Mykle jumps onto the flux-field.\n\nThe stunt lands him not 24 hours into the future but 32 years, wherein he meets an older (although not by that much) man who helps him get back to his own time. I’m not really spoiling anything by saying this older man is a future version of Mykle, which even Mykle admits is an obvious turn of events. “Although the answer seems obvious in retrospect it was some years before I realized it,” he says. The older Mykle is, as the younger one puts it, “pompous and over-bearing,” being preoccupied with a young woman he considers to be the most beautiful in the world—so beautiful that he dares not talk to her. Listen, I think a lot of us went through “simp” phases in our youths. At the same time young Mykle isn’t wrong when he thinks his older self is being self-serious, although the Mykle now narrating (whom we can infer is much older than either past self) is more sympathetic to the young man’s plight. Something to keep in mind when reading this story is that Mykle-as-narrator is telling us about events that would’ve happened many years in the past, and that he ends up referring to multiple past selves across different points.\n\n“Palely Loitering” is interesting, historically, as a very telling work of ’70s British literature. Mind you that at this point, in the late ’70s, there was basically no market for short SFF to speak of in the UK; the major outlets like New Worlds and Science Fantasy had gone the way of the dodo, and while several notable SFF magazines would be born in the ’70s in the US, the same cannot be said for the UK scene. No doubt “Palely Loitering” would’ve been published in the UK first had there been a viable option, as it is quintessentially a British narrative, being obviously written in the wake of an economic recession, the waning of public interest in space flight (the last people would’ve walked on the moon about five years prior to Priest writing “Palely Loitering”), some of the worst flare-ups of violence in Ireland, and all setting the stage for the Thatcher administration which came about shortly after this story’s publication. There are scars in the British character still very much lingering from World War II three decades later. It’s little wonder then that those with enough money would try to jump into either the past or the future, and also that the fashion and manners of these people would be out of step with what we would expect from people of the future. Mykle’s own style of narrating is rather mannered, even for an Englishman—unless he were emulating the speech of an Englishman of the 1870s and not the 1970s.\n\nI do have a few questions regarding the logistics of the flux-field and the Park, which Priest does not answer. Mykle breaks away from his family and jumps onto the flux-field itself pretty easily, apparently without any railing or fencing to stop people from landing on it. This seems like an obvious security oversight. If touching the flux-field directly lands you at some point in the distant future, then how would you hope to get back to your time? Mykle gets lucky with help from his future self, but most people wouldn’t be so lucky. How often would this sort of thing happen? For the sake of legal drama surely it must not be a common occurrence, and yet it’s hard to imagine people not constantly going off the beaten path out of curiosity and stepping on the flux-field often, damn the consequences. Wouldn’t it also be easy to run into past and future versions of yourself, given how the bridges work? Of course, this last point plays into the story: it does make sense, to a degree, for Mykle to meet past and future versions of himself, although then one wonders why we don’t see this happen with other people in the story. The Park seems like a Jurassic Park-level disaster waiting to happen, built with what Mark E. Smith would call “the highest British attention to the wrong detail.” But then maybe its dubiousness is also part of the point.\n\nOf course, any story involving time travel will inevitably become a heady matter, what with how the rules of the story’s interpretation of time travel work. Sometimes meeting a different version of yourself would cause a time paradox and make the universe reset itself, or something like that, but time paradoxes are obviously common in the world of “Palely Loitering”—possibly even encouraged by the builders of the Flux Channel Park. Mykle’s chance meeting with the young-adult version of himself and seeing the woman (named Estyll) the latter is obsessed with plants a seed in his head, which will eventually make him map out the exact spot in the flux-field where he landed the first time so he can go back to that same point in the future. Despite seeing her again, however, as Mykle gets older he becomes more withdrawn, more introverted—in a way more pathetic. “As I grew older, and became more influenced by my favorite poets, it seemed not only more sad and splendid to glorify [Estyll] from a distance, but appropriate that my role in her life should be passive.” Slowly but surely he becomes the young man he had previously written off as a hopeless romantic. He is his father’s son.\n\nMykle’s sister drift in different directions as they get older, but more importantly there’s a tragedy in the family as the father dies before his time, and for better or worse Mykle’s father was an important man. Still only a teenager at first, Mykle matures and learns to run his dad’s business, eventually becoming one of the more important men in England—yet still he can’t bring himself to say another word to Estyll, seeing her as some kind of ideal even after he marries a different woman and by all accounts is happy with her. The obsessions never leaves his mind for long; it’s the kind of longing that probably doesn’t happen in real life and certainly doesn’t happen in the modern age, rather being the sort of longing Lord Byron and his ilk would’ve written about a whole century prior. It’s clear that Estyll does not fascinate Mykle strictly as a person, but rather symbolizes something which cannot be found in the present moment—only either in the past or the future, which the Park literally has bridges to. It’s tempting to think Proust helped inspire the story, especially Mykle’s ponderous and at times melodramatic narrative voice, but Priest is dead now and will not be answering anymore.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nGood news, the ship that mysterious vanished all those years ago is now returning! Bad news, it can only land on the flux-field and that means the Park will have to be dismantled! This happens when Mykle is now 42 years old, so 32 years after that fateful day when he jumped onto the flux-field and landed… 32 years into the future. Hmmm. The back end of this story is a bit convoluted, since it involves a middle-aged Mykle realizing that not only can multiple versions of himself exist in the same space but that these different versions don’t necessarily come from the same continuity. Yes, we’re getting into multiverse shenanigans with this one, although it wasn’t called that at the time and was pretty far off from becoming a worn-out concept. Looking at the cover for this issue of F&SF again, I realize it’s technically a spoiler, as the shadowy men in coats and hats are different versions of Mykle; but it’s out of context, so it’s fine. The ending, wherein Mykle basically plays matchmaker and gets an alternate past version of himself to finally go out with Estyll, is honestly moving, even despite the matchmaking antics being confusing to read in the moment. My heartstrings were pulled.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nPart of me wonders what this story would’ve read like had it been written by an American, but after a couple days of thinking on it that has more to do with my bias against Victorian-style narration than a fault with the story. It does get rather convoluted, but Priest got a lot done with this short novella, implying a whole future world whilst keeping the action more or less restricted to a single stage. It’s moody, just the right amount of bittersweet at the end, and perhaps most importantly for modern readers, it hasn’t aged much because of the deliberately anachronistic setting. After reading “Palely Loitering” I decided to read all of “The Last Deadloss Visions,” and these two tell me I might be a Priest fan in the making. I should get back to Inverted World, and maybe check out The Affirmation…\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin: you may have heard of her. She’s one of the most acclaimed authors in all of modern SFF, at times daring and yet somehow free of controversy (for the most part, as I’ll explain). She got started fairly late, only starting to write SFF when she was already in her thirties, but given that she lived to be almost ninety her career would be exceedingly long and varied. She’s also one of those rare authors to leave a major impact on both SF and fantasy, primarily with her Hainish and Earthsea cycles. The former might be her best work, when taken as a whole. My relationship with Le Guin has changed a good deal over time, ever since I first read The Left Hand of Darkness a little over ten years ago. As I’ve drifted closer to her politics over the past few years and become more familiar with her work I’ve come to have more mixed feelings on her as an artist, which I know is almost like a paradox. I think Le Guin is often great, and that of the Great™ SFF writers she’s one of the most versatile; but she’s also an idealist who doesn’t seem given to passions other than said idealism.\n\nI’m gonna use her Four (later Five) Ways to Forgiveness as an example. Three of these stories were published in Asimov’s, with “A Woman’s Liberation” being the final one. It’s not a direct sequel to the previous stories, “Forgiveness Day” and “A Man of the People,” but it definitely complements those stories and more specifically could be seen as the yang to the latter’s yin. They share a few characters, but more importantly “A Woman’s Liberation” feels like a flipped-perspective retelling of “A Man of the People.” I’m not sure if this would work better as its own thing or if read immediately after the previous story like it would be in the collection. I enjoyed “A Woman’s Liberation,” but somehow feel it’s a weaker installment.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the July 1995 issue of Asimov’s Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. It then appeared in Four Ways to Forgiveness and by extension Hainish Novels and Stories, Volume Two. For anthologies we have The Year’s Best Science Fiction, Thirteenth Annual Collection (ed. Gardner Dozois) and A Woman’s Liberation: A Choice of Futures by and About Women (ed. Sheila Williams and Connie Willis).\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nThe story is the fictionalized memoir of a former slave named Rakam, who having been freed years ago is now writing about her early years. We know at the start that things will turn out well for her in the end, which is good to know because to say Rakam had a rough childhood would be understating it. She was raised on Werel, as a slave, although her pitch-black skin suggests (indeed other characters take note of it) that she might be of noble heritage. Right, so on Yeowe and Werel dark skin is considered more desirable while light-skinned people are considered “dusty,” which seems to be an inversion of the dark-light dynamic among blacks that goes back to the days of chattel slavery. I suppose Le Guin is trying to make a statement about the arbitrary nature of skin complexion and desirability. Anyway, Yeowe has had a successful slave rebellion; its people are now free—or at least the men are. Slavery is still alive and well on Werel.\n\nRakam’s first sexual experience is as basically a sex toy for Lady Tazeu, the matriarch of Shomeke. Lady Tazeu is a curious character: she treats Rakam gently, all things considered, but is quite possibly a pedophile and also has a jealous streak. Lord Shomeke and Lady Tazeu also have a son, Erod, who is a young abolitionist and, as it turns out, Rakam’s half-brother. When she reaches a certain age Rakam’s mother tells her that there’s a reason for her dark skin: she is Lord Shomeke’s illegitimate daughter. But if Lady Tazeu ever finds out about this then she never tells Rakam. Lord Shamake falls fatally ill and the manor is placed under quarantine, and Lady Tazeu kills him and then herself; whether she does this so as to put the man out of his misery or out of revenge is left unclear. With both of his parents dead, Erod takes over the manor, and he signs papers that will free the slaves and allot them each a bit of money. This has disastrous consequences, as many of the slaves are killed overnight by neighboring slave-owners who think a rebellion is underway. Rakam is freed of her bondage, only to be forced into more servitude. Despite having her freedom papers, said papers mean basically nothing. “The government would not interfere between owners and those they claimed as their assets.”\n\nYou may notice that similarly to “A Man of the People,” this is less a proper novella and more like a compressed novel, giving us only the essentials for this narrative of one person’s life. We follow Rakam from her birth to not long before she would’ve started writing her memoir. One major difference between this and the other Yeowe-and-Werel stories (the ones I’ve read, anyway) is that “A Woman’s Liberation” is written in the first person. Despite this change in mode, Rakam’s style is actually not that different from the third-person narrators of the other stories, the only real difference being that those other narrators are omniscient, whereas there are little gaps in Rakam’s narrative—information she was never able to obtain. “I did not learn to read or write until I was a grown woman, which is all the excuse I will make for the faults of my narrative.” She still comes off as firmly literate, though, despite being a late bloomer when it came to reading. This is indicative of Le Guin’s long-winded style that she had developed by the ’90s, simultaneously craftine labyrinthine paragraphs that cram more information into overall less space. I’m not sure what inspired the change, but the Le Guin of the ’90s is quite different from how she was in the ’70s.\n\nLe Guin’s style evolved, but so did her worldview it seems. The Dispossessed remains the quintessential left-libertarian SF novel, but I think it’s fair to say it’s not a feminist novel—or at least women’s liberation is not a chief concern. (The short story “The Day Before the Revolution,” a sort of distant prequel to The Dispossessed, could by contrast be considered an explicitly feminist narrative, although Le Guin doesn’t quite connect the dots with feminism and anarchism.) With the stories that make up Four Ways to Forgiveness Le Guin makes it pretty explicit that the notion of human liberty is incomplete without feminism—indeed freedom under a hypothetical socialism would be freedom only for a fraction of the population if women’s liberation is not a high priority. Erod starts out as a sympathetic character, albeit one who makes an error out of shortsightedness that gets a lot of people killed, but when we meet him again some years later he’s shown to be a low-key misogynist, much to Rakam’s displeasure. (Not sure where to put this, but isn’t it convenient that despite finding Erod attractive in her youth and even being offered to him as a bed-warmer, the half-siblings never get intimate?) Good news I suppose is that Rakam does meet a few decent men in her life, including Ahas, a fellow slave at the manor, and much later we meet a face or two that should strike us as familiar…\n\nThe thing about Le Guin that makes her a favorite of literary types and classroom discussion is that she’s such a pious writer—she’s so virtuous that she seemingly has never done anything wrong in her life. Her politics are very far on the left, which should on paper make her a no-no for those who try to keep literary discussion “apolitical,” but she’s so gentle about said politics. She might’ve become aware of this purer-than-pure status because—and I’m not sure when exactly this happened—she gets super-horny in the later Hainish stories. Oh sure, sexuality is integral to The Left Hand of Darkness, but in a clinical, anthropological sense. Women’s sexuality is also at the heart of “The Day Before the Revolution,” but we have not yet reached maximum levels of horny. Then we get to Rakam’s story, which at its core is about her political and sexual awakening, the two coinciding and indeed feeding off each other. Consider this passage, in which Rakam (and I have to think this is also Le Guin responding to critics) explains why much of her memoir is concerned with sex:\n\nNow you may say in disgust that my story is all of such things, and there is far more to life, even a slave’s life, than sex. That is very true. I can say only that it may be in our sexuality that we are most easily enslaved, both men and women. It may be there, even as free men and women, that we find freedom hardest to keep. The politics of the flesh are the roots of power.\n\nRakam has been freed, but while she is technically a freed woman on Werel, she’s still a slave sexually; up to about the halfway point of the story the only sex she’s known has been through rape. Her orientation is a grey area: she’s probably bisexual, or even more likely pansexual since she doesn’t seem to think along gender lines when it comes to attraction. Le Guin is funny when it comes to sexuality because, given that she was most likely straight (I don’t recall reading about her ever being attracted to anyone who was not a man, and anyway she was very happily monogamous), her interest in queer yearning and relationships often has this sense of detachment—like she empathizes, but maybe she doesn’t know what it’s like to live as a man who sometimes has crushes on other men, who is always anxious about these crushes because coming out to another man could result in something far worse than a rejection. With the exception of the unrequited romance in The Left Hand of Darkness, I don’t usually buy Le Guin’s characters being attracted to each other—which brings me to spoilers.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nI said earlier that that a few characters from “A Man of the People” reappear here, although you don’t have to have read that story to understand what’s happening. The first is Old Music, the Hainish bureaucrat who has appeared in all the previous Yeowe-and-Werel stories in small but pivotal roles; and here he comes again, this time to help Rakam get off Werel, although she doesn’t discover until after the fact that he was Old Music. Once Rakam gets to Yeowe, which as I’d said is a liberated planet, we meet “Mr. Yehedarhed,” who you may recognize as Havzhiva, a Sub-Envoy for the Ekumen and the protagonist of “A Man of the People.” Finally there’s Dr. Yeon, a major character from that story and perhaps Havzhiva’s closest friend. Being an outsider, Rakam only knows so much about these people, but if you’ve read “A Man of the People” then you know a lot has happened. Rakam impresses Havzhiva and convinces him to let her found a publishing house, and in the process the two fall in love—the first time Rakam’s ever fallen in love with someone and had that affection returned.\n\nThe development of Rakam and Havzhiva’s happens over the course of maybe ten magazine pages, and if that sounds rushed, that’s because it is. It could be that, taken on its own, we simply don’t know enough about Havzhiva to trust him; oh sure, we’ve read “A Man of the People” and can carry that information over to this related story, but Rakam doesn’t know all that shit. The big things Rakam gets to know about her love interest is that he’s an abolitionist, a women’s lib sympathizer, and that he took a knife to the gut the fucking day he landed on Yeowe. From Rakam’s perspective, Havzhiva is basically perfect—which makes him boring. Because “perfect” people are boring. Le Guin admitted to dislike writing evil characters, which is why you can count the number of total scumbags in her fiction on one hand; but conversely she has a tendency at times to write characters who are seemingly bereft of human flaws. Goody-goodies, ya know. Rakam has trust issues and anxiety (understandably), but Hazhiva in the context of this story is a bit of a cypher, which hurts the romance.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nAs I was reading “A Woman’s Liberation” I couldn’t help but feel like something was missing—indeed it’s the same reservation I have with the other entries in this “story suite” but even more so here. It’s good fiction but not good science fiction. Of the Yeowe-and-Werel stories I’ve read this one is the least SFnal, in that it could be most easily rewritten as a realistic narrative. Le Guin was clearly inspired by real-world slave narratives when writing it, but I think the lack of original input is to its detriment. I also think that while it does work well in concert with “A Man of the People,” it does feel redundant to some degree. Granted, I might be saying the same thing about that other story had the two been published in reverse order. Ultimately the problem could be that they’re too similar. I’m curious for when I eventually read Four/Five Ways to Forgiveness and see how these stories work together when taken as pieces of a larger narrative.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nLisa Tuttle and George R. R. Martin were baby-faced new writers, part of the post-New Wave era, and were even nominated for the Astounding Award for Best New Writer (Tuttle won) the same year. The two were lovers in the early ’70s, and while I haven’t looked into this, I’m pretty sure they were still together when they were writing “The Storms of Windhaven” (although they had broken up, and Martin was on his way to getting married, by the time it was published). This was probably the first thing of Tuttle’s a lot of people had read, and this might still be the case given the Martin connection; but these people would be in for a nasty surprise, since Tuttle’s writing is much more in touch with horror than SF. As for Martin, I need not elaborate, only to say that the Martin of the ’70s and ’80s is quite a different beast from one of the most famous authors in the world. I can’t call myself a Martin fan (because I’ve been unimpressed by what little I’ve read of A Song of Ice and Fire), but I do like most of his early stuff.\n\nTuttle and Martin came up with the Windhaven setting and apparently wanted to turn it into a novel, but only after they had written this first novella, which is a self-contained narrative. And why not? It would take almost five years for a follow-up to “The Storms of Windhaven.” This was pretty popular too, getting nominated for the Hugo and Nebula and placing first in that year’s Locus poll for Best Novella. I like it a good deal myself, for the worldbuilding more than the actual plot, and because it lacks some of Martin’s less savory habits. I have a theory or two about who wrote what, but I’ll get to that in a minute. And rest assured we’ll eventually tackle One-Wing, the much-anticipated sequel to this story.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the May 1975 issue of Analog Science Fiction, which is on Luminist. Unsurprisingly most of its reprints predate Windhaven. We’ve got The Best Science Fiction of the Year 5 (ed. Terry Carr) and The 1976 Annual World’s Best SF (ed. Arthur W. Saha and Donald Wollheim). Windhaven itself is still in print, for obvious reasons.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nThe plot itself is rather simple, but some context is needed. A sloppy reading of this story might make one think it’s fantasy, and certainly without some pieces of backstory it could be construed for fantasy. I myself barely noticed the origin of the humans of Windhaven on my first reading, along with a couple other things. Windhaven is a livable but not totally hospitable planet, mostly covered with water and prone to fierce gales and some pretty nasty local wildlife. The humans are descendants of space colonists, who had crash landed on the planet and could no longer use their spaceship; and apparently as a result the descendants have most lost touch with their far-future past, having descended into barbarism. There are basically two types of people: flyers and “land-bound.” The flyers have constructed their wings out of metal from the crashed spaceship, so needless to say it’s a precious resource; losing wings is considered just as bad, if not worse, than losing a human life. I’m putting this all up at the front since Tuttle and Martin sort of sneak in this context in breadcrumbs of exposition, which can be easily missed, although you don’t need it to understand the plot.\n\nAnyway. Our Heroine™, Maris, is a skilled flyer; the problem is that she’s not “supposed” to be a flyer. She’s the daughter of a fisherman (long dead) who got adopted by Russ, who really is a flyer, although having lost the use of one of his hands he can no longer fly, and at the time he was seemingly sterile. “He and his wife had taken her in when it seemed that he would never father a child of his own to inherit the wings.” Luckily for Russ but unluckily for Maris, a child was eventually born. Coll is Russ’s son and, having turned thirteen, Coll has now come of age to inherit his father’s wings. But Russ had previously told Maris that she would inherit his wings! Conflict is now well underway. This is made worse by the fact that flyer laws state that wings can only be passed on to family members (unless the flyer has no next of kin or gives up their wings), preferably blood-related. The Landsman, a local authority, sympathizes with Maris’s wish to become a flyer, but rules are rules and Russ is a traditionalist. To make things even worse, Coll doesn’t really want to become a flyer; he would rather be a balladeer, like Barrion, a mutual friend of theirs and sort of a rebel.\n\nMaris is a bit of a mixed bag as a character, because on the one hand she seems to be one-note: she wants to become a flyer and doesn’t seem to have any other serious aspirations. She has a boyfriend in Dorrel, a flyer himself, but we only see them together in a few scenes and it’s not a relationship that’s made that important. She doesn’t seem to have any hobbies, although in fairness she lives in a world without movies, TV, video games, or even common literature. But, to give some credit, she is driven, has a clear goal in mind, and is not objectified at any point. I suspect that Maris’s assertive characterization came mostly from Tuttle, although I can’t prove this. There’s a bit of steaminess with Maris and Dorrel, but it’s tasteful. Unfortunately one or two of the characters are not written as delicately. Russ is your typical boomer dad who doesn’t approve of his daughter’s wild ways, and he also happens to be very angsty about his disability. Obviously Russ wants to do the sports parent thing and recapture his glory days as a flyer vicariously by forcing his son, who is a square peg, into a round hole. Corm, a senior flyer and the closest the novella has to a villain, is almost a cartoon character, so zealous is he about keeping with tradition.\n\nUnsubtle and at times problematic character writing would dog Martin for the rest of his career (some people will challenge me on this, but I think those people are wrong), but one thing Martin and Tuttle both had nailed down from very early in their careers is a sense of location. “The Storms of Windhaven” is not hard SF, but it is a vivid and plausible (assuming you’re not a stickler for details) planetary adventure that gives us a plot that, yes, could work perfectly fine in a fantasy context, but whose SFnal background gives credibility to this far-future society that has descended somewhat into barbarism. It makes sense that the survivors of a crashed spaceship would scatter over a ton of small islands, traveling by glider or boat, and having to rebuilt society from the ground up. It makes sense that a few centuries later the descendants would remember these original explorers through myth and song, and that lineage would become very important. Balladeers like Barrion would hold an important place in society because they are entertainers, for one, but also they chronicle history—and rewrite it, if need be. Barrion says he’d like to write songs depicting Maris as a virtuous rebel after all has been said and done, and he has the power to do this.\n\nUltimately this is a story about tradition vs. progress, or more specifically, how we should handle the past. It’s unsubtle; it’s even more unsubtle than the character writing, not that I disagree with Tuttle and Martin’s obvious pro-progress stance. Russ and Corm are bound to tradition, even to the point of making Maris’s life worse, and they need to be shown the error of their ways. This is also a story about racism and classism, by way of metaphor, because it’s pretty clear that a) the people of the different tribes don’t get along too well, and b) flyers and land-bound don’t like each other. Understandable: flyers are rather up their own asses about their wings. Our Heroine™, of course, has no bad intentions and doesn’t even know what those are. She does briefly consider killing Corm when the latter confiscates her wings, but she quickly turns this down, and that’s as dark as her character gets. I’m not really complaining—just pointing out how much of a girlboss Maris is. I don’t remember a great deal from One-Wing but I do remember it focuses a bit less on her, which I might appreciate on a reread. “The Storms of Windhaven” technically has a sequel hook, but it would still feel like a flesh-out world even if we never got a sequel.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nMaris steals back her wings from Corm, and there’s a chase. Despite being younger and not a “true” flyer, Maris proves to be a better flyer than Corm, which lets her escape his wrath for the moment but also results in her being put on trial before a council. The back end of this novella is weird for me because I totally forgot about the stealing part (despite it being crucial to the plot) and also remembered the trial taking up more of the story than it does. Memory is flexible, and often tells us things that aren’t quite true. I also realized, looking at my notes again, then I occasionally misspelled Corm as “Corn.” Imagine being hunted down by some conservative zealot named Corn. Anyway, the trial is technically to judge whether Maris be exiled from her hometown (or I guess home… rock?), but really it’s supposed to be a kangaroo court of humiliation, as Maris thinks:\n\nCorm is a proud man; I injured his pride. He is a good flyer and I, a fisherman’s daughter, stole his wings and outflew him when he pursued me. Now, to regain his pride, he must humble me in some very public, very grand way. Getting the wings back would not be enough for him. No, everyone, every flyer, must be present to see me humbled and declared an outlaw.\n\nAt first everyone is against the notion that wings should be earned in some way rather than just inherited, but naturally Maris is able to convince enough of the council that what has been done for generations isn’t the only correct way to do things. “The Storms of Windhaven” is not some deep “literary” achievement but a well-crafted planetary adventure that wears its thesis and emotions on its sleeve. Its point is obvious, but entertaining to read (there’s not a dull moment here), so unsurprisingly it was quite popular with readers. It’s just a shame that Windhaven, like Dying of the Light and Tuf Voyaging, is doomed to semi-obscurity by virtue of not being the thing that made Martin one of our most famous living authors. Of course, it’s totally possible these books wouldn’t even be in print if not for Martin’s name being attached to them. It’s also a shame that Windhaven would be Martin’s last SF novel if we’re not counting Tuf Voyaging as a novel.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nObvious sequel hook aside, this is a nicely self-contained story that theoretically could’ve stopped here; but it’s a good thing they didn’t. This is a masterclass in worldbuilding, and it’s impressive especially given how young both authors were at the time. It’s vivid, if also old-fashioned even for 1975. It could’ve been published thirty years earlier in Planet Stories, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s justifiably a classic piece of SF adventure writing. We will return to Windhaven, in One-Wing, which was serialized in Analog in 1980. For some reason I remember very little of One-Wing despite having read it not that long ago. Ominous…?\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nLeigh Brackett debuted in 1940, with her first couple stories being printed in Astounding, but quickly she found other magazines more enticing despite the smaller paycheck. She stopped submitting to John W. Campbell for the same reason her future husband Edmond Hamilton did: creative differences. Campbell wanted science fiction of a new, more technical, more cerebral sort, while Bracket and Hamilton were devotees of a school of adventure fiction that predates Campbellian SF. Brackett, by her own admission, was also pretty indifferent to keeping up with real-world scientific discoveries. It might be considered strange, then, that nowadays Brackett is most known for her post-nuclear novel The Long Tomorrow and her work as a screenwriter. She also wrote a fair amount of detective fiction, which does show its influence in her SF somewhat. She wrote the first draft of the screenplay for The Empire Strikes Back in the last months of her life, which saw her return to her planetary romance roots.\n\nRay Bradbury is one of the most famous writers in all American literature, especially for his novel Fahrenheit 451 and his fix-up “novel” The Martian Chronicles. Bradbury didn’t think of himself as an SF writer and it’s probably best, if anything, to understand much of his fiction with a horror lends; indeed his first collection, Dark Carnival, was horror-focused. In the ’50s Bradbury would gain mainstream recognition, but in the ’40s he was a fledgling short story writer and fan, with Brackett and Henry Kuttner (who were only five years older than Bradbury) acting as mentors. “Lorelei of the Red Mist” is a Brackett story at heart, but for better or worse Brackett was unable to finish it before trying her luck at screenwriting, leaving Bradbury to write the second half of the novella by himself. For what it’s worth I think Bradbury did a good job paying respect to Brackett’s style, although even without the latter’s word on who did what it’s not hard to figure out where the Bradbury part of the story begins.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the Summer 1946 issue of Planet Stories, which is on the Archive. It’s been reprinted a fair number of times, including in Three Times Infinity (ed. Leo Margulies), The Best of Planet Stories #1 (ed. Leigh Brackett), The Great SF Stories Volume 8 (ed. Isaac Asimov and Martin H. Greenberg), Echoes of Valor II (ed. Karl Edward Wagner), and the Brackett collection Lorelei of the Red Mist: Planetary Romances. This is all for collecting’s sake since you can read the story for free on Project Gutenberg. Sadly there was never a sequel to that Planet Stories anthology.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nHugh Mongous Starke is a space robber who has made off with the biggest pile of money he’ll probably ever see in his life—only he’s on the run from authorities and it looks like he won’t live much longer. Indeed it doesn’t take long for a mishap with his ship to send his body packing, although his mind proves to be much more resilient. Left dying on Venus, Starke is confronted by a strange woman named Rann, who has the power to spare Starke and give him a new body if only he would hold up his end of a certain deal. Rann is a sorceress, the Lorelei of the title (I thought for a while it was the name of a character, but it’s referring to Rann and her role as a sort of temptress), who has powers beyond Starke’s understanding. Starke gets his new body, but he quickly finds he’s been thrown into a conflict he can scarcely fathom, among people who want him dead.\n\nA while ago I reviewed Brackett’s “Enchantress of Venus,” one in a series starring the futuristic barbarian Eric John Stark (Starke and Stark are very different characters, I might add), and Brackett’s Venus in both stories very much takes after early 20th century depictions of the planet. Even in 1946 the Venus of this story must’ve seemed a little far-fetched. Think Zelazny’s “The Doors of His Face, the Lamps of His Mouth.” It’s not exactly hospitable, but it’s livable for humans who are tough enough; there’s local wildlife, and as expected this Venus is swampy, with the Red Sea (the red mist of the title) being home to a very dense gas as opposed to water. The gas is dense enough to buoy ships but breathable enough that a human could traverse the bottom for several hours without scuba gear. This is all stuff Starke will learn much later but which will be familiar to those of us who have read one or two of Brackett’s Venus stories before.\n\nStarke’s mind has been transplanted to the body of Conan, a warrior who has been kept in chains (“Starke’s new body wore a collar, like a vicious dog.”) and tortured in the dark corridors of Crom Dhu, an island surrounded by the Red Sea and connected to the mainland only with a jetty. Crom Dhu is home to the Rovers, a group of humans (like Starke) who, unlike Our Anti-Hero™, have stuck to a borderline medieval way of living. There’s Romna, the local bard, and Faolan, the leader of the pack who has been rendered blind, both literally and with hatred for Conan. Then there’s Beudag, Faolan’s sister and, as it turns out, Conan’s lover—or rather former lover. Conan, despite being one of the Rovers, has been tortured because he betrayed his own people in a recent battle: he was set to marry Beudag but turned his back on her in favor of Rann. It’s unclear if Conan had planned this from the start or if Rann had put some kind of spell on him. He would’ve run off with the sorceress had he not been captured, and apparently Conan’s mind broke under the torture (possibly also combined with guilt), making his body an ideal vessel for Rann to slip Starke’s mind into it.\n\nTo get the obvious out of the way, this is in part a Conan homage. The fact that the Rover hideout is called Crom Dhu doesn’t help. Something clever Brackett does is that she makes the protagonist a typical space opera character (a lovable rogue in the mode of Han Solo, you could say) and puts him in the body of a sword-and-sorcery hero. Eric John Stark takes after Conan (not to mention Tarzan) while Hugh Starke is basically a civilized man (albeit a remorseless criminal), only he’s been thrown into a scenario that would not be unusual for Robert E. Howard to conceive. We also don’t get to know much about the Conan of Brackett’s story, since his consciousness is MIA (although not as absent as was first thought, as we’ll discover later) and he can’t get a word in edgewise. The other characters tell us what sort of man Conan was like and it’s up to Starke to fill in the blanks; he’ll have to do his homework pretty quick, after all, or else he might get killed by one of the Rovers who are out for vengeance. Faolan suspects Starke might be an agent for Rann—a rational concern, considering Rann does want Starke to destroy the Rovers from the inside.\n\nTo complicate things further, Beudag clearly misses her former lover, and seeing him returned to a somewhat normal state (or rather seeing his body again inhabited by a working mind) immediately draws her to Starke. Starke is similarly taken with Beudag, who is a warrior lady who could probably crush his head with her thighs. Romance is not exactly Brackett’s strong suit (I remember criticizing the romantic aspect of her Eric John Stark stories that I’ve read), but the off-the-cuff romance in “Lorelei of the Red Mist” feels more justified since Starke is in the body of a man who was in love with Beudag, and he eventually finds that his memories are actually becoming intertwined with Conan’s, on top of Rann’s power over him. This story apparently drew some controversy among the Planet Stories readership for its overt (for 1946 pulp fiction) sexuality, and true enough Brackett and Bradbury are eager to describe human nudity (both male and female) in as much detail as was possible under the circumstances. It’s also unambiguous that both Beudag and Rann find Conan (or rather his body) very attractive. This is not just titilation. There’s some irony in the fact that Starke has a strong mind but originally had a weak body, while Conan has a strong body (even under torture) but a relatively weak mind.\n\nBut wait, there’s more! There’s a threeway conflict going on. There’s the humans, the sea-people who dwell in the Red Sea (they’re humanoid but they have gills and thin webbing between their fingers and such), and Rann’s people, who are descended from the sea-people and are apparently racist toward their own ancestors. All three sides hate each other, but right now shit is not looking good for the humans, as Crom Dhu has been under siege and there’s no way of getting off the island. The island is fortified such that Rann’s people will have a hard time getting in, but Faolan’s people can’t get out, and if Faolan dies then the humans will have no choice but to surrender. All Starke would have to do is kill Faolan and Rann will get what she wants and Starke will get his million credits. Rann is held up in the city of Falga, and there was a battle there recently that left the humans retreating and Conan becoming a traitor. There’s a whole backstory that’s partly given to us through exposition but which remains partly up to the reader’s imagination, the result being that Brackett (and I say her specifically since she wrote the first half and thus did most of the legwork with world-building) makes the world of the story feel bigger than it is.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nStarke, under the influence of Rann, nearly kills Faolan, Romna, and Beudag before being “rescued” by Rann’s people. The deal was that if Starke did what he was supposed to then he would get a million credits, but obviously Rann has no intent of actually following through on this, resulting in Starke narrowly surviving the double-cross and retreating into the Red Sea. It’s at this point that the story takes an unusual turn, and this is because Bradbury is now in control. Brackett said she didn’t know where the story was heading when she passed the torch to Bradbury, and admittedly you can still predict the rest in broad strokes. The details are what matter, though. The story doesn’t descend into horror exactly but it does get noticeably spookier, and the language becomes a bit more poetic as well. (I don’t see Brackett using “ebon” as frequently as Bradbury does here.) Bradbury does his best to mesh with Brackett’s style, but still there’s a switching of gears that you’d probably notice even if you didn’t know the nature of this collaboration. The SFnal part of the story was already tenuous, but by the time Bradbury takes over it has all but evaporated. I do like the idea, however, that within the bast universe of this distant future, with his spaceships and laser beams, that there are pockets of civilization that lag centuries behind that future. The Rovers, for example, have no issue with slavery, nor do they seem to have any weaponry that’s on par with even 20th century American standards. Jack Vance would basically make a whole career on such far-future medievalism.\n\nAt the bottom of the Red Sea, Starke comes across a pack of hounds, and a shepherd, one of the sea-people who apparently has the power to bring the dead back to life—not to their full selves, but as zombies. This is something that was not alluded to at all previously. The sea-people wanna use an army of the undead to take both Crom Dhu and Falga, which naturally doesn’t please Starke. Using a nigh invincible army would be nice, but Beudag has been taken hostage by Rann and Starke does feel that he ought to redeem himself in the eyes of the Rovers. It could also be that his personality has meshed with that of Conan’s to the point where he’s seeing himself in Conan’s shoes. “That part of him that was Conan cried out. Conan was so much of him and he so much of Conan it was impossible for a cleavage.” He manages to convince the shepherd to at least have the sea-people strike Falga first, to buy the Rovers time and maybe convince the sea-people that they have a common enemy! Which works! Although the ensuing battle at Falga—really a massacre more than a real battle—is depicted as horribly grotesque. “It was very simple and very unpleasant.” Still, he convinces the sea-people to spare Crom Dhu the same fate. The climax of “Lorelei of the Red Mist” has Starke do the typical heroic things, like rescuing Beudag, saving Crom Dhu, and killing Rann, but it’s also about him coming to terms with the fact that he is no longer entirely Hugh Starke, but “Hugh-Starke-Called-Conan,” host to that second personality and vicariously offering Conan the chance to redeem himself. Starke eventually finds his old body and gives it a proper burial, saying goodbye to his old self literally but metaphorically also saying goodbye to his former life as a rogue. He will work to become an honorable warrior now, with Beudag (who is in love with both Starke and Conan) at his side.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nThis is a very interesting story, even if it is structurally wonky. It doesn’t help also that I was very tired (from work and a sprained ankle denying me much-wanted sleep) when I was reading it. It does seem a bit long in the tooth, not helped by the obvious divide between the Brackett and Bradbury material. At the same time this is exactly the sort of story that would never see print in Astounding, because it’s a little too fun-loving, a little too horror-inflected, a little too unscientific, and a little too erotically charged. Despite taking place on the same version of Venus as the aforementioned “Enchantress of Venus” this feels less like Edgar Rice Burroughs and more like Robert E. Howard, which of course is not a bad thing! (Makes me wonder what might’ve happened had Howard lived to see the sword-and-planet boom of the ’40s and early ’50s.) If you’re interested in old-school planetary romance, something which predates Dune and which is a lot less sophisticated but also less heady than Herbert’s take, this is a good start.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nHe was not the most prolific writer, but Michael Bishop was one of the most eye-catching new authors to come out of the post-New Wave period, debuting in 1970 and spending the rest of that decade making a name for himself. I had been meaning to get more into him, but unfortunately I did not get much of a chance while he was alive. Bishop died in November last year, leaving the field just slightly emptier. “The Samurai and the Willows” is one of Bishop’s most acclaimed stories, having solidified this by placing first in the Locus poll for Best Novella. It’s part of a series—a fact I genuinely had forgotten about prior to reading it, which would go to explain my confusion with some details in the world he constructs. Bishop is clearly hunting big game here, intellectually, and while I have a few qualms with this story I have to admit it also left me with a lot to think about.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the February 1976 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. It was anthologized by Best Science Fiction Stories of the Year, Sixth Annual Collection (ed. Gardner Dozois), and… that’s it? It was collected in the fix-up “novel” Catacomb Years, which has all the stories in that series along with interludes. I know it was reprinted in a couple more recent Bishop collections, but Bishop had the tendency to revise his works decades after the fact and “The Samurai and the Willows” was no eception. We’re reading the magazine version.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nFirst, about the worldbuilding, because context is important and if you’re going into this story then you should know a little about the future Bishop creates here first. “The Samurai and the Willows” is one entry in an episodic series about a future Atlanta that, for some reason, is domed “surfaceside” and has several underground levels. This story here is set on Level 9, which as you can imagine is a good deal underground. Simon Fowler is a 38-year-old man of at least half Japanese descent (on his mother’s side), a “samurai without a sword” who runs a floral shop, and is cubical mates with Georgia Cawthorn, an 18-year-old black “Amazon” who clearly has ambitions that involve moving out of the catacombs. They have nicknames for each other: Simon is Basenji and Georgia is Queequeg. If you know your Moby Dick then congratulations, Bishop has already planted an idea in your head in the first couple pages. I’ll be calling these characters by their nicknames henceforth since it’s clear to me Bishop wants us to understand them on a symbolic level. There’s a good deal of symbolism at work in “The Samurai and the Willows,” and not all of it is obvious.\n\nThis is a short novella, only about 19,000 words, so in the threeway tug-of-war between plot, character, and worldbuilding, something has to give; in this case it’s plot that draws the short stick, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Bishop drops us off at the deep end of what already seems like a fully developed Atlanta of 2046 (and no, there’s no way major cities across the US would become domed go partly underground within seventy years of the story’s publication), with characters who usually do not explain the obvious to each other for the reader’s benefit. There’s some blatant exposition thrown in, but this is pretty much all through the third-person narration as opposed to what characters are saying. Basenji has been living like this for many years and Georgia doesn’t even really have memories of life before the dome. It’s never said explicitly why cities have become “Urban Nuclei,” with the honeycomb structure, but it’s implied that an environmental catastrophe has rendered much of the world unwelcoming to human habitation; at least that’s what I assume is happening. There are several questions about the background of this story that go unanswered.\n\n(You may be wondering why I bothered mention Basenji and Queequeg’s ages at the start. All I can say is get ready for a tangent in the spoilers section, it’s gonna be awesome I promise.)\n\nSo what’s the plot? Kind of a trick question. Basenji is a florist who also happens to keep a diary, plus a lot of guilt over something that is not revealed to us until very deep into the story. There’s clearly some unspoken sexual tension between Our Heroes™, but this is put aside momentarily as a third wheel enters the picture: Ty, who happens to be around the same age as Queequeg (I think a year or two older) and has the same job as her. (I find it curious that Basenji, or rather Bishop, gives a black woman the name of a Polynesian man, even calling her a harpooner. There’s something to be said about the racial and cultural politics here, but I’m putting a pin in all that for a second. [Yes, I understand the possible symbolism of naming her Georgia, given the setting.]) There’s evidently a generation gap at play: Basenji has memories—or at least a dconnection via his parents—of life before everything changed, and now he has to play nice with people two decades his junior, who were born and raised to understand a city that has changed radically even from our understanding of it in 2024. The point is that this is not an action narrative; the world is not at stake; rather this is the story of one man coming to terms with his personal demons.\n\nLike I said, Basenji keeps a diary, where he does what you normally do in a diary, but he also dabbles in poetry. Early on we get a telling note in said diary about Yukio Mishima, who of course was probably the most famous Japanese author in the west at the time. I’m not gonna tell you the whole story, because you can look it up yourself and anyway he was quite the character, but Mishima was something of a paradox: he was a hardcore conservative, to the point where he wanted Japan to its pre-World War II imperial era, but he was also gay, never mind an artist in the truest sense. Was Mishima a samurai who wanted to be an artist, or an art"
