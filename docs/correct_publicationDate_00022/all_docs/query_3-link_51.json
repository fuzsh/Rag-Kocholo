        "text": "\"John Varley was, throughout this period, a central figure, not only of the Society but of the school of water-colour painters. We have seen that at the birth-time of the former he was living in Broad Street, Golden Square, and had for some years past been giving lessons to amateurs. In 1813 he moved from No. 15 to No. 5. In 1814 or 1815 he migrated to 44 Conduit Street, and in 1817 to 10 (afterwards called 10) Titchfield Street, and there built a 'gallery for the display of his works.' He also educated students for the profession; and in course of time a goodly company of artists yet to be named, and some of great distinction, had profited either by his direct tuition or enjoyed the benefit of his kindly and sometimes gratuitous advice.\n\nHis pupils lodged in his house as apprentices, his own family circle increasing round him at the same time. Turner of Oxford has been mentioned as one of his earliest pupils. In its proper place will be described his generous reception of the modest stranger David Cox, who came to him very early in the century for lessons; and it has been stated above how freely a little later he gave his help to Copley Fielding; and how even the art of Peter De Wint was bettered by Varley's judicious counsel. Among other Members of the Water-Colour Society who derived like fatherly benefit from him were William Hunt, F. O. Finch, and Samuel Palmer. John Whichelo is also believed to have been an early pupil of Varley's, and at a late period of the latter's career his influence is said to have rescued from a clerk's Elmes's Annals of the Fine Arts (1817), desk the distinguished painter W. Holman Hunt, now a Member of our Society. Among the more eminent of his pupils were also John Linnell and William Mulready, and among the less the landscape painter H. B. Zeigler.\n\nMany are the stories of his generosity to young artists, arising in part from the kindliness of his open disposition, and in part from a vehement desire to infuse into others the ardent spirit with which he pursued his own vocation. One of them has recently been told of a well-known northern architect, John Dobson, who came to London from Newcastle in 1810 to obtain the best instruction he could get in water-colour drawing, before commencing his profession. He went to Varley. But 'Varley,' writes Dobson's daughter and biographer, 'declined to be troubled with young pupils, and at first declared that he could not spare even half an hour. Observing, however, the intense disappointment of the youth, he at last consented to give him lessons at five in the morning, his time during the day being fully occupied. This concession, made at some inconvenience, marked the recognition of a kindred spirit.\n\nThe master soon perceived the uncommon qualities of his pupil, and not only agreed to give him daily instruction, but invited him to stay in his house, and would hardly part with him when, six weeks later, suitable lodgings were found.’ Master and pupil worked all day together,' and 'a mutual esteem sprang up which continued in afterlife.' It is said that Varley wished him to devote his talent to water-colour painting. Dobson's view of Seaton Delaval at the Royal Academy in 1815 has already been mentioned as the first coloured drawing exhibited there of a strictly architectural subject; drawings sent there by architects before that time having been in Indian ink, without artistic effect.'\n\nJohn Varley despised secrets. He would freely tell what he knew, to the mortification of the illiberal, and the profit of most artists of his acquaintance. When he met with congenial soil, he liked to cultivate it. Discovering a taste for art in a lad employed to clean his boots, he took him in hand and made an artist of him. His enthusiasm was infectious. At a house where he gave lessons 'not only his pupils painted,' say the Messrs. Redgrave, but the very servants took brush and paper to try their skill at landscape painting.\n\nVarley knocking at the door on one occasion was delayed a minute or two, and on the servant opening it, the painter found that the delay had been occasioned by John's being engaged at the moment washing in a sky at the hall table; the work did not please Varley, so he stopped on his way to the parlour, seized the brush, and immediately began to exemplify the necessary changes in the work before him.' The lady whom Varley had been engaged to teach on this occasion was a Miss Edwards, of Bedford Square; and to make the story more complete, it is believed that the footman whom Varley helped, afterwards became a professional artist.\n\nHe was very outspoken, and sometimes would give his advice when it was not asked; a dangerous practice, but one not always to his disadvantage, as in the following instance: Varley,' writes Constable, R.A., in a letter, 'has just called on me, and I have bought a little drawing of him. He told me how to do landscape, and was so kind as to point out all my defects. The price of the drawing was a guinea and a half to a gentleman, and a guinea only to an artist; but I insisted upon his taking the larger sum, as he had clearly proved to me that I was no artist.'\n\nVarley's benevolence was not restricted to brethren of the brush. He could be kind to some whom many artists regard as natural enemies. He not only encouraged children when they tried to draw, but attracted them with cakes to gambol near him as he sketched from nature and to scramble around for his very loose halfpence.\n\nAt the period at which our history has now arrived, Varley's terms for teaching amateurs had risen to a guinea an hour. He and his wife's brother-in-law Clementi had arranged to start guinea lessons at the same time, one in painting, the other in music. Varley's, and it may be Clementi's too, were probably worth the money. It was remarked that he could not give a lesson without some advantage being derived by the pupil; and he said himself that he could teach many parts of his art in a lesson, which it had cost him years to learn. For Varley's teaching was not mere instruction in methods and processes, and the laying down of rules to imitate objects and paint in a set style.' It was addressed to the mind. If ever an artist painted with brains as well as colour, it was John Varley. 'As a preceptor,' says Pyne, we know of no one to prefer to Mr. Varley when he 'sets to it doggedly,' for no artist perhaps has ever studied his department with more abstract reasoning upon cause and effect.'\n\nHappily, we are not left wholly in darkness as to the nature of his tuition, and the kind of truths which he inculcated; for he set down the one and exemplified the other in several published writings, designed for the use of students out of the reach of his personal superintendence. The chief of these, which came out in numbers, is in its complete form entitled A Treatise on the Principles of Landscape Design, with General Observations and Instructions to Young Artists. Illustrated with sixteen Highly Finished Views. By John Varley. Sherwood, Gilbert, and Piper, Paternoster Row.' The sixteen views are engraved in aquatint, and printed in brown ink, two on a plate; and the eight plates, each with its explanatory letterpress, were issued as the serial numbers at 5s. apiece. They bear dates of publication from 'February 20, 1816,' to 'May 1, 1821;' the first seven, down to the date February 1st, 1818,' being published by Varley at his successive addresses, the eighth by his old friend J. P. Neale at 'Bennett Street, Blackfriars Road.'\n\nThe titles given by the author to the several landscapes (which are of course from his own designs) indicate to some extent his classification, such as it is, of the whole subject. They are as follows: i. (1 & 2), Principles of Light and Shade. ii. Principles of objects reflected in water. iii. (E) Epic [Pastoral]; (F) Pastoral. iv. (6) River Scene; (H) Ouse Bridge, York. v. (1) Sunshine; (K) Twilight. vi. (L & M) Principles of Skies in Fine or Stormy Weather. vii. (N & o) Marine. viii. General Landscape; Mountainous Landscape. This work appears to have been the first attempt to write systematically on the theory of effect.' The author is not content with stating rules of composition, but explains the object of each device; one, it may be, to conduct the eye from point to point; another, to arrest the gaze, or heighten an impression by the sense of contrast. And we find in his writing the same happiness in illustration, and ready wit in the perception of analogies, which are said to have characterised his verbal instruction, and, indeed, his ordinary conversation. Odd and quaint as he often was in his way of expressing himself, and unpolished in style, he was always apt, familiar, and original.\n\nMany of his sayings remained in the memories of his pupils, and some have been handed down by tradition. Nature,' he would say, 'wants cooking, though there was no warmer advocate than he of studying the raw material. Every picture ought to have a look-there, was his way of saying that the spectator's eye must be directed to the point of interest. He had a pretty similitude wherewith to point out the value of flat tints, and how the points of dark and light tell upon quiet even ground. Flat tints,' said he, 'are like silence, in which you can hear the faintest whisper.' To a lady whose drawing was too smooth and timid in its execution, he said, wishing to impress her with an idea of dash and vigour, 'Did you ever notice a barber sharpen a razor? That's what it wants, the decision and the whacks.'\n\nJohn Varley had illustrated his own principles by the display of no less than 435 works in the Society's galleries from 1805 to 1820, during which period he had abstained from exhibiting elsewhere. But these are unequally divided between the periods of eight years. In the first, or water-colour period, he had 330, or an average of about 41 a year; in the second 105, or an average of about 13. A large proportion of the first must have been small drawings, no doubt often executed as pupils' lessons. But among them were probably included many of his happiest and most characteristic works.\n\nIt was of his small drawings more particularly that Pyne wrote thus: 'There is a classic air pervading his best compositions which savours of the boldness of Poussin, united with the elegance of Claude; a happy combination of mountain, wood, lake, and river, that cannot fail to delight the eye of taste: the buildings, too, in his designs, are so judiciously placed, whether on a promontory, embosomed in a wood, or insulated on a plain, and so aptly formed and well-proportioned, that they are never out of place.' He further characterises them as 'admirable in the arrangements of their parts ... powerful in effect ... vivid in colour,' and 'intelligent and full of expression.'\n\nIt is of drawings of this period that the Messrs. Redgrave give the following summary of his way of painting, and just remarks on the character of his art: Varley's tints are beautifully laid, with a full and free pencil, and stippling is not resorted to, to flatten the masses; but he said that he got very fine qualities and suggestions in his skies by pumping vigorously upon them; yet the washing is not apparent, the tints of clouds being generally very sharply defined, and this is the case also with his foliage, which is massive and large, rather than imitative; he sometimes resorted to taking out the light in his foliage with bread, but did not use body colour in his best works. Varley's art was based on that of Girtin, rather than of Turner, but his study and appreciation of the old masters, Claude and Poussin, enabled him to give a classic air to his landscapes that quite removed them from any imitation of Girtin's style.\n\nTurner's pictures consist of multitudinous details properly subordinated to breadth of treatment; but Varley's compositions, on the contrary, have few parts: the details are passed over, and great breadth and simplicity is the result, sometimes it is true with a tendency to vacancy and emptiness, and in his works for the dealers often verging on a sort of stereotyped conventionalism. 'When he laid himself out to do his best, and when he studied his subjects on the spot, his pictures have qualities that we find in no other painters-freshness, clearness, largeness of manner, and a classical air, even in the most common and matter-of-fact subjects. Though no slavish imitator of natural objects, he was so minutely truthful as to the general aspects of nature that in his representation of distances it was said, 'you might decide the number of miles each object was from the foreground.'\n\nThough he constantly made use of the same subjects, and even 'searched the prints and etchings of the old masters for portions to introduce into his compositions,' he never could repeat a work identically, but always varied the effect or arrangement, perhaps by adding a new foreground, and sometimes patching his paper and adding pieces to the top or sides of a drawing.\n\nThroughout the whole series of exhibitions, Varley had been very constant to his Welsh subjects, though he varied them, but in smaller numbers, with views in the home counties; in and about Oxford; in Yorkshire, &c.; and, from and after the year 1809, in Northumberland. In the above cases it may be presumed that he painted from his own sketches. A few subjects come from Scotland, the Lakes of Killarney, and Devon and Somerset. These, being smaller in number than one would expect had he been known to have travelled in the districts named, may be conjectured to have been made up at second-hand. In and about 1814, there were, as above stated, views in Spain and Portugal, confessedly from sketches made by others on the spot. A view of Windsor, exhibited in 1809, was reproduced in a coloured print in Ackermann's Repository? Some subjects on the banks of the Thames between Battersea and Vauxhall, apparently those exhibited in and about 1812, are singled out by the Messrs. Redgrave as displaying the best qualities of John Varley's art.\n\nSometimes he made a more ambitious effort. There were, in 1814, a 'Curfew,' and 'Thomson's Grave, from Collins's Elegy,' each with accompanying verses in the catalogue; and in 1820 another Curfew' sounds, to the same lines as the first. To one work in particular, 'The Burial of Saul,' exhibited in 1819, special attention had been drawn. But this, it is believed, was a large oil painting. It was in illustration of the sublime passage, quoted from the first chapter of the Second Book of Samuel, containing the words, 'How are the mighty fallen!' The motive is said to have been suggested to the painter on hearing his daughter play the Dead March from the oratorio of 'Saul.' The work was engraved by Linnell, who is understood to have painted the figures on the left of the picture.\n\nIf, with all his prolific power and industry, the patronage he enjoyed, and the high contemporary estimate of the merit of his work, John Varley failed as he did to realise a competency by his exertions, this failure must be set down partly to domestic circumstances beyond the fact of his having eight children to support, and partly to a certain hopeless inability on his own part to remain solvent. He used to say himself that whatever money was put into his pocket was sure to run out at the bottom. The latter defect arose in some measure from the careless generosity of his disposition, and it appears to have been aided as a source of extravagance by the habits of his first wife,' and the conduct of a sometime son-in-law. For himself, he lived from hand to mouth, never put by a farthing, and indeed was always in difficulties. But he declared that his home troubles, 'which would have worried any other man into his grave, were beneficial to him, as just preventing him from being too happy.' On Linnell's asking him, one day, how he was getting on, he answered, 'Much better, much better; there are only four men, I think, now, who could put in executions.'\n\nA friend met him one day racing along at great speed, somewhere near Cavendish Square, and would have stopped him, but Varley pushed by, saying, 'I am in great haste, I cannot stop now. I have found a man who only takes 35 per cent.' The Messrs. Redgrave relate that Varley had an original way of getting paid by rich but forgetful debtors - a way he used to say which saved the unpleasantness of law. I send in a new bill,' said the painter, making a mistake in the amount of a guinea or two against myself, and the money comes in directly.'\n\nIt was not only in matters of art, but in everything which he undertook, that Varley showed the enthusiasm of his nature. Whatever irons he had in the fire, he heated them hot. For a long time he busied himself in the attempt to produce perpetual motion; but at last he allowed his brother Cornelius to convince him that the thing was impossible. And so he was content to take out a patent for a carriage with six wheels. But he could not regulate the wheel of Fortune, and lost his money.\n\nA strong passion for the marvellous, which induced him to cultivate his credulity, led to the acquaintanceship which he formed with the great visionary, William Blake. To John Varley's simple and enthusiastic nature the spiritualism of Blake afforded a special fascination. He was some twenty years older than Varley, and approaching sixty years of age when the friendship was first cemented. They came together through Linnell, and from about 1818 had been constant companions. During the two succeeding years, it was Varley's delight to assist at this weird artist's visions, and encourage him to produce in graphic form the figments of his brain. Blake was then living in South Molton Street. It was at Varley's house in Titchfield Street as a studio, that in midnight hours he received his ghostly sitters. Historical, fabulous, even typical personages,' seen in the mind's eye of Varley's strange guest, were believed by the simple and credulous host to have been personally present in the dingy artists' quarters about Fitzroy Square.\n\nGilchrist gives the following account of these extraordinary séances. Blake's 'visionary faculty was so much under control, that at the wish of a friend he could summon before his abstracted gaze any of the familiar forms and faces he was asked for. This was during the favourable and befitting hours of the night, from nine or ten in the evening, until one or two, or perhaps three or four o'clock in the morning; Varley sitting by, sometimes slumbering, sometimes waking! Varley would say, \"Draw me Moses,\" or David; or would call for a likeness of Julius Cæsar, or Cassibellaunus, or Edward the Third, or some other great historical personage. Blake would answer, \"There he is!\" and paper and pencil being at hand, he would begin drawing with the utmost alacrity and composure, looking up from time to time as though he had a real sitter before him; ingenuous Varley, meanwhile, straining wistful eyes into vacancy and seeing nothing, though he tried hard, and at first expected his faith and patience to be rewarded by a genuine apparition. A 'vision' had a very different signification with Blake to that it had in literal Varley's mind. Critical friends would trace in all these heads the Blake mind and hand, his receipt for a face. John Varley, however, could not be persuaded to look at them from this merely rationalistic point of view.' He accepted all Blake said of them, added in writing the names, and in a few instances the day and hour when they were seen.'\n\nShortly after Blake's death, which occurred in 1827, Varley published the following particulars of one of the strangest of these fancies, called 'The Ghost of a Flea,' with an engraving of the portrait referred to. This spirit visited his ' (Blake's) 'imagination in such a figure as he never anticipated in an insect. As I was anxious to make the most correct investigation in my power, of the truth of these visions, on hearing of this spiritual apparition of a Flea, I asked him if he could draw for me the resemblance of what he saw: he instantly said, 'I see him now before me.' I therefore gave him paper and a pencil, with which he drew the portrait. I felt convinced by his mode of proceeding, that he had a real image before him, for he left off, and began on another part of the paper, to make a separate drawing of the mouth of the Flea, which the spirit having opened, he was prevented from proceeding with the first sketch until he had closed it. During the time occupied in completing the drawing, the Flea told him that all fleas were inhabited by the souls of such men as were by nature bloodthirsty to excess, and were therefore providentially confined to the size and form of insects; otherwise were he himself, for instance, the size of a horse, he would depopulate a great portion of the country. He added, that if in attempting to leap from one island to another, he should fall into the sea, he could swim, and should not be lost. This spirit afterwards appeared to Blake, and afforded him a view of his whole figure.'\n\nThe existence of this supposed creature, Varley actually treats as a fact, to reason from inductively, in support of the science of astrology. But human credulity knows no bounds. Nearly all of these visionary heads mostly dated 1820, became the property of Linnell, who made coloured copies of three of them for Varley. Blake, Linnell, and John Varley, writes Gilchrist, were 'a curiously contrasted trio, as an eye-witness reports, to look upon in animated converse: Blake, with his quiet manner, his fine head-broad above, small below; Varley's the reverse: Varley, stout and heavy, yet active, and in exuberant spirits - ingenious, diffuse, poetical, eager, talking as fast as possible; Linnell, original, brilliant, with strongly marked character, and filial manner towards Blake, assuming nothing of the patron, forbearing to contradict his stories of his visions, &c., but trying to make reason out of them. Varley found them explicable astrologically-'Sagittarius crossing Taurus'--and the like; while Blake, on his part, believed in his friend's astrology, to a certain extent. He thought you could oppose and conquer the stars.'\n\nThe last reference touches upon another and a more lasting phase of Varley's superstition, namely, his firm belief in 'the vain science of astrology,' the pursuit of which he carried to a fanatical length. Many were the stories told of his practice in casting nativities, and predicting future events. It has even been alleged that he made a profit of his supposed skill as an astrologer, and took regular fees for telling fortunes. That, however, was not the case. On the contrary, he is known to have returned a note which someone sent him in acknowledgment of a favour of this kind. Yet there is no reason to doubt the correctness of Messrs. Redgrave's statement as to his being 'shrewd enough to see,' and 'candid enough to own, that his astrology was one of the causes of his popularity as a drawing master. 'Ladies come to take drawing lessons,' said he, 'that they may get their nativities cast.' Varley rarely was introduced to anyone without in a short time asking him for the day and hour of his birth. His pockets were always crammed with old almanacks to refer to for the sign of the Zodiac rising upon the horizon at the time.\n\nHis theory was that the 'house' (as it was called) influenced the life, and that even a personal likeness could be traced to the sign. And this he afterwards made the principal theme of the extraordinary book above quoted, whereof he published but one out of four projected parts. The full title is 'A Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy, illustrated with engravings of heads and features; accompanied by tables of rising of the 12 signs of the Zodiac; and containing also new and astrological explanations of some remarkable portions of ancient mythological history. By John Varley - London. Printed for the author, 10 Titchfield Street; and sold by Longman & Co., Paternoster Row. 1828. Price Five shillings.'This rare and curious book contains sixty-four octavo pages of letterpress, and five plates, four at least of which were engraved by Linnell. Some of them are filled with outline heads of Varley's friends supposed to exemplify the author's theory, and among them is the 'Ghost of a Flea from Blake's Vision' above mentioned. The whole figure is promised in a forthcoming part. The portraits, with others not engraved, were taken by Varley by means of a camera lucida. Varley considered this science of Zodiacal Physiognomy' as a 'branch of natural philosophy,' distinct from Judicial Astrology,' which deals in prediction. It is in relation to his practice in the latter branch that the following anecdotes are related. Some of them are said to be authentic, but for the truth of others it would perhaps be hazardous to vouch.\n\n'Calling one day on a well-known picture dealer, he sought to dispose of some of his drawings, which he had brought in a portfolio. The dealer declined, but only to be again and again urged; at length Varley exclaimed: 'I shall sell before I leave the house,' mentioning as the ground for his assertion some particular relation which existed between the planet under which he was born, and another of the celestial luminaries. The dealer invited him to tea, still refusing to purchase; but as Varley was on the point of leaving the house, a friend of the dealer's came in, and on being introduced to the artist, then and there bought his pictures. 'Ah!' said Varley, 'I told you I should sell before I left your house.' Sceptics might answer that he was determined not to quit the premises till he did sell.\n\nIt was said that the death of Collins, R.A., came, to the day, as the stars had told Varley that it would, and that 'Scriven the engraver was wont to declare that certain facts, which could be only known to himself, were nevertheless confided to his ear by Varley with every particular.' Then 'he cast the nativities of James Ward the famous animal painter's children. So many of his predictions came true, their father, a man of strong though peculiar religious opinions - for he, too, was a 'character' began to think the whole affair a sinful forestalling of God's will, and destroyed the nativities.\n\nA reference to dates was found by the Messrs. Redgrave not quite to bear out an oft-told tale of the fulfilment of Varley's sealed prediction, confided to Mulready, and only divulged on Callcott's wedding day, that the bridegroom was to remain single until he was fifty; for the event of his marriage occurred on his forty-eighth birthday. Varley had also prophesied that Callcott would go to Italy, and so he certainly did - three months after he had been told that the Fates required it.\n\nIt has already been mentioned how Varley considered his being tossed by Taurus in early life as a predestined event. On a later occasion, Aquarius seems to have been his persecutor: warned of danger from water, he remained at home all day, and then fell over a pail and hurt his leg. On another, as will have to be related in due place, it was the element of fire that was set against him by the Fates. Records of predictions that come true are more durable than those of failures. But there is still some evidence that Varley's were not always right. The Rev. William Harness used to declare that in his case they were entirely wrong; and the Duke of Sussex, P.R.S., laughed at his astrology; asking him whether the position of the stars would account for some corns with which his Royal Highness had lately been troubled.\n\nBesides his more important work, the Treatise on Landscape Design,' Varley also published the following works on the practice of Art: A Practical Treatise on the Art of Drawing in Perspective, adapted for the study of those who draw from nature; by which the usual errors may be avoided. By John Varley. London: Printed for Sherwood, Gilbert, and Piper, Paternoster Row, and Ackermann and Co., Strand.' The book, or pamphlet, or whatever it may be called, which is in quarto size, and bears this title, is in fact a collection of four folio broadsheets of letterpress, accompanying two plates of diagrams of the same size, engraved by W. Lowry, pl. i. bearing in the imprint the date of publication 1 Dec. 1815, and Varley's address in Conduit Street, and pl. ii. the date 1 Sep. 1820, with the name of 'J. P. Neale,' Varley's early friend and fellow-sketcher, and his address 'Bennett Street, Blackfriars Road.'- Precepts of Landscape Drawing, exemplified in 15 Views; with Instructions to Young Artists. By John Varley.\n\nThis consists merely of two folio plates, folded in quarto, one engraved by J. C. Lewis, the other by Josh. Gleadah; the first comprising nine and the second six pretty little aquatint views, with a note to each pointing out some plain principle or device involved in the composition. Pl. i. has the date 1 Jan. 1818, and pl. ii. 22 Dec 1818, with Varley's then address in Titchfield Street (the number being changed in the interval from 10 to 10). Varley's List of Colours, otherwise described as 'Specimens of 19 Permanent Colours, with particular instructions for mixing and using them.' This is likewise a broad sheet of the same size, folded; with the several colours painted by hand in oblong spaces under one another. The quality of permanence would certainly be denied to some of them in the present day. It is not known when this sheet was first published. It is believed to have been reissued many times,' and much used by Varley's pupils. Allibone mentions Studies for Drawing Trees, 4to, by J. Varley.\n\nThere is yet another book, entitled 'Observations on Colouring and Sketching from Nature,' which has been, erroneously, attributed to John Varley, both by the Messrs. Redgrave and by Mr. Gilchrist; and it is possible that the mistake may have led to some depreciatory remarks by the latter on Varley's writings, which they do not deserve.\""
