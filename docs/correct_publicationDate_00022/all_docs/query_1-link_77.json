        "text": "Demon is the final book of The Gaea Trilogy and it brings the story to a very satisfying conclusion. Author John Varley is easily the most whimsical of all science fiction writers for the past 30 years and even though this series begins with its feet on the ground, it ends up tearing a hole in the sky.\n\nFor a synopsis of the previous two novels, Titan and Wizard, please click on the links.\n\nIn Demon, the planetary brain, Gaea, has reconstituted herself as a 50 foot tall image of Marilyn Monroe. She has created new subsets of creatures designed to serve her needs as a movie studio, moving about the countryside, scouting locations, milling timber, building sets and so forth. There are even small creatures called Bolexes and Panaflexes that can film events as they happen. So Gaea now has a roving studio moving across the wheel making movies.\n\nGaea has also started a war among the powers on Earth and as the number of nuclear explosions mount, it becomes apparent that Earth is going to destroy itself. Gaea helpfully begins evacuating humans to her wheel and using them in many insidious ways. Among the bizarre creatures that Gaea has created, there are religious zombies, which attack anyone at any time.\n\nRocky has become Gaea’s enemy and lives by hiding, moving from place to place, making allies among the creatures on the planet, such as the Titanides, a centaur like race whose sex is determined by front sexual organs, but who also have both sexes in the rear. The Titanides are the exact opposite of humans and possess all the skills to have a peaceful and loving civilization, but they have become caught up in the struggle against Gaea and are strong allies with Rocky. Chris, who became romantically involved with a Titanide female in <I>Wizard</I> is now turning into a Titanide himself, gradually. Robin, who returned to her Coven, returns now with a grown daughter (Chris is the father) and a baby boy. Through some genetic trick, Gaea has somehow managed to make Chris the father of Robin’s new baby boy, Adam. They were both immaculate conceptions.\n\nAlso, Gaby’s spirit has returned to help Rocky in her war against Gaea, who is now clearly insane. Rocky sets about raising an army from the destitute humans arriving from the ravaged Earth and the battle is pretty well set up.\n\nIt should be clear from much of the synopsis above that John Varley writes great, big and vibrant female characters. This is also a feature of his bizarre short stories.\n\nBut the most prominent aspect of his writing is the creativity and whimsy that he brings to the art. When he exploded on the SF scene in the late seventies, he was a tremendous breath of fresh air in a field that had become a little stagnated. More recently, after gaps in writing, he has produced fun SF that hearkens back to the early days of SF, while still keeping it modern and entertaining.\n\nIn reading this trilogy, however, it is great to reminded of the vitality, the pure wacky spirit that made his early work so much fun to read.\n\nI highly recommend this novel and the entire trilogy.\n\nThis is the second book of the Gaea Trilogy and this review is intended for readers who have already finished the first novel of the trilogy, Titan. To read my review of that book, click HERE.\n\nJust as Titan begins in a somewhat normal universe and escalates into an absurd universe, so Wizard picks up at the same gonzo level where the first book ended and escalates into something even more absurd.\n\nThis book takes place roughly 75 years after the end of Titan and the two main characters return, Rocky Jones and Gaby Plauget. When Gaea made Rocky the Wizard of Gaea, she also gave her certain powers to go with Rocky’s new station. Rocky can now talk to all of the creatures that live on the wheel, she has been given eternal youth, and she has been made the sole method of ferterilizing the Titanide’s eggs, making her essentially responsible for the survival of the species. Gaby, in order to remain on Gaea with Rocky, has had a tougher road. She works for Gaea on a piecemeal basis, project by project, and her principal reward from Gaea is eternal youth, bit by bit. She must constantly keep re-earning her prize and is none too happy about it.\n\nMost of the novel, however, deals with two new characters and their exploits on the giant living body of Gaea. Both of them are fairly young and both of them have incurable diseases. It has been Gaea’s policy for some time now to ask certain humans to come to her (she calls them pilgrims) to be cured. But Gaea likes her good deeds to be a two-way street – you do something for me first and if I find you worthy, I’ll cure everyone who has your disease. The something that Gaea always demands is an act of heroism (or death trying).\n\nThe young man, Chris, has a disability where he temporarily goes insane and cannot recall his actions while gonzo. When crazy, he can harm innocent people and has a bad problem with rape. He always feels bad afterward, but what can you do? He finally screws up his courage and decides to approach Gaea.\n\nThe young woman, Robin the Nine-Fingered, comes from a Coven of witches which lives in a habitat at the L2 LaGrange orbit of earth. Long separated from other humans, these women have lived in Lesbian harmony for many years and recreated human culture from their own perspective. All men are insane rapists running an earth where women are kept as sex slaves. Human literature, which was all written by women, has been co-opted to seem as if it was mostly written by men. And so forth.\n\nRobin has a disease in which she periodically has intense siezures where she loses all control. She has become a hateful, violent 19-year-old who hopes eventually to have children, if Gaea can cure her. She comes before Gaea with a serious attitude problem.\n\nThese two unlikely characters are joined together with Rocky and Gaby on a cross-Gaean trip hoping to find situations requiring heroism. Those who have read Titan know that opportunities for heroism exist in abundance on Gaea, but so do the opportunities for death.\n\nAnd death does play a prominent role in this novel. Varley pulls no punches in his descriptions.\n\nLike Titan, this novel is also largely picaresque as the foursome venture around the rim of Gaea, accompanied by four Titanides, one of which has fallen in love with Chris. The Titanides are truly amazing creatures, created by Gaea because she wanted Centaurs. All communications between them are sung and they a truly unique sexual perspective (they are composed of one frontal sex and two rear sexes. This novel is strictly for mature readers. It contains graphic descriptions of Titanide sex and alien-human sex.\n\nAnd finally, like Titan, it is a huge, sprawling, comic and yet deadly serious story about survival, godhood, humanity and heroism. While it is possible to say that it is not quite as good as Titan, it is nonetheless a page-turner and it does amaze and delight. The scope is huge. At his finest, John Varley is one of the most challenging, awe-inspiring and shocking science fiction writers of the past thirty years.\n\nThis book meets all of those criteria and I highly recommend it–and the Gaea Trilogy–to all mature fantasy/sf readers.\n\nTitan is an amazing science fiction book, the first one in the Gaea Trilogy, and it deserves a place among the 100 best science fiction books of all time.\n\nJohn Varley has had my attention ever since I ran into The Persistence of Vision many years ago. In that collection of short stories I was awestruck with his creativity and unique approach to science fiction. Each story was challenging with innovation and new ways of thinking about old problems.\n\nAlthough Titan isn’t so much cutting-edge as some of his more whimsical short stories, it definitely has it’s moments when you have to slam the book closed, stand up, and walk around in a circle laughing. It is part science fiction, part comedy, part fantasy and part homage to great and not-so-great science fiction of the past.\n\nThe book is set in the not-too-distant future of the next 200-300 years. It tells the story of the Deep Space Vehicle Ringmaster and her crew on a mission to Saturn.\n\nThe captain is a woman named Cirocco “Rocky” Jones (an homage to the old serial “Rocky Jones”) who was born in a corporate wandering family that travelled the globe at the beck and call of corporations who actually run Earth. Brought up by her mother, Jones always wanted to be an adventurer and ended up becoming an astronaut so that she could – hopefully – see things no one had seen before.\n\nHer navigator is Gaby Plauget, a small woman who has been fascinated with space since childhood and really cares for nothing else. Other crewmembers include a doctor, engineer and pilot (males) and two cloned sisters. Sex is a rather open prospect on a deep space vessel, both hetero and homo and Rocky has slept with all of the men.\n\nUpon approaching Saturn, they discover a rather large space object that they at first think is a rogue moon, but when they get closer, the object appears to have been built by intelligence. They scrap their mission to investigate. In form, the object is like a huge ring with spokes attaching to a hub, but literally hundreds of kilometers in circumference and doing one full rotation per day as it makes its way around Saturn.\n\nBefore they can figure out an approach to the object, they are grabbed and the Ringmaster is pulled toward the object, smashing apart in the process. Rocky then goes through a process where she is aware of sensory deprivation for a very long time before she is finally coughed up from the ground onto the surface of the ring, with the great hub rotating hundred of kilometers above her. She finds Gaby and eventually the others and meets up with a species called the Titanides, half-human, half-equine. The crew name objects using Greek mythology, especially derived from the Titan myths and they decide to call the “planet” or “object” Titan.\n\nTitan is full of many wonderful and whimsical creatures, including a kilometer-long blimp-like flying creature that is intelligent, and creatures fashioned to look exactly like angels, flying through the sky.\n\nRocky decides that she must travel to the hub to discover if there are any builders alive or if there is a radio so she can contact Earth. Gaby travels with her on a torturous journey up the strands of cable that hold Titan together, discovering along the way that the object is actually a living creature, whom they rename Gaea (mother of the Titans).\n\nI won’t divulge what happens when they reach the hub – it must be savored by the reader when they actually reach that point and I don’t want to spoil that part. Let’s just say that it is one of those moments when you must slam the book closed, stand up, and walk around in a circle laughing.\n\nBut I will give the warning that the book contains a lot of descriptive sexual relationships, including a detailed description of the Titanides’ sexual construction and the many ways that they may procreate.\n\nI highly recommend this novel to those with open minds and who appreciate creative and whimsical writing. If you’ve ever wanted to jump into something that will surprise and amaze you with its creativity, this is a book you will want to look into. And it’s hard to put down once you get started."
