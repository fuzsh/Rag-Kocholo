        "text": "Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes, caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the back of the eye (retina). It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated.\n\nSymptoms\n\nThere are no apparent symptoms in the early stages until it is advanced. If you are diabetes for log time and experience any of the below symptoms, an eye examination is required. These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have diabetic retinopathy, but it’s important to get them checked out.\n\nGradually worsening vision\n\nSudden vision loss\n\nShapes floating in your field of vision (floaters)\n\nBlurred or patchy vision\n\nEye pain or redness\n\nDifficulty seeing in the dark.\n\nNormal Vision Vision effected by diabetic retinopathy\n\nCommon Treatment for DR\n\nRetinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare diseases affecting the retina and leading to vision loss over time. Early symptoms include decreased night vision. It is a rare genetic disorder that effects the retina.\n\nSymptoms:\n\nRP is a progressive condition, which means it generally gets worse over time. Symptoms typically appear during childhood. As RP advances, a person may notice new or worsening symptoms that affect their vision.\n\nDifficulty in seeing in poor lighting or in the dark.\n\nA reduced ability to see either central vision or side or peripheral vision.\n\nDifficulty in reading print and seeing detailed images.\n\nStumbling or tripping over objects not seen.\n\nGlare.\n\nWhen to See an Eye Doctor:\n\nA person should seek advise from an eye doctor, if they notice a slow loss of night or peripheral vision. These can be signs of RP onset. They should also contact a doctor if they experience a sudden loss of sight, as this could be a sign of other conditions.\n\nA macular hole is a rare eye condition. The condition can blur the central vision we use to do daily tasks like driving or reading.\n\nThe macula is a small area in the center of the retina. Macular holes happen when an opening forms in the macula — usually after being stretched or pulled. Most macular holes form because of changes in the eye that happen as we age.\n\nSymptoms:\n\nThe symptoms of this condition start slowly.\n\nAt first, you might notice that things look distorted or blurry when you look straight ahead. Lines or straight objects — like a window frame — might look bent, wavy, or like they’re missing a piece in the center. It might be harder to do everyday tasks like reading, writing, or driving.\n\nOver time, you might notice a blurred or blind spot in your central vision. When reading, you may see the lines but miss letters or words in the center. Or you may be able to see a person’s face but not their nose or eyes.\n\nEarly treatment with surgery can often restore vision. Without early treatment, central vision loss may be permanent.\n\nWhen to see a doctor:\n\nIf you have blurred or distorted vision, or there’s a black spot in the centre of your vision, see an eye doctor.\n\nA Rigid Gas-Permeable lens, also known as RGP lens or GP lens is popularly known as Hard Contact Lens. It is the most common type. They hold their shape firmly, yet they let oxygen flow through the lens to your eye.\n\nRGP lenses are smaller than soft lenses, fitting within the cornea rather than overlapping onto the white of the eye. This allows the tears to flow freely under the lens and this combined with the oxygen permeability of the lens material means that RGP lenses are healthy for your eyes.\n\nBecause RGP lenses are rigid, they correct for any imperfections in the shape of the cornea such as astigmatism, and in many cases give a superior standard of vision to soft lenses. They also last for many months and are rather more robust than soft lenses.\n\nRGP lenses are especially helpful for people with astigmatism and a condition called keratoconus. This is because they provide sharper vision than soft lenses when the cornea is unevenly curved. People who have allergies or tend to get protein deposits on their contacts may also prefer RGP lenses.\n\nSoft lenses are handily the foremost popular sort of contact. Most of those are silicone hydrogel lenses, which transmit more oxygen to the surface of the attention than conventional hydrogel lenses. Soft contact lenses are made from a thin and porous plastic containing hydrogels. Not like hard contacts, hydrogels in soft contacts are supple. This enables superior breathability and comfortability.\n\nIf you wear glasses frequently, and your eyes are healthy, you’re probably a good candidate for contact lenses. You may want contacts instead of eyeglasses for aesthetic reasons, or because you play sports or engage in other activities that make glasses impractical.\n\nAstigmatism can be corrected with contacts now and give you better peripheral vision.\n\nSri.

This causes an increase in internal eye pressure and subsequent damage to the optic nerve.\n\nThe disease can go unnoticed for years because most people don’t have symptoms.\n\nThis type of cataract begins as a small opaque or cloudy area on the “posterior,” or back surface of the lens. It is called “subcapsular” because it forms beneath the lens capsule, which is a small “sac,” or membrane, that encloses the lens and holds it in place.\n\nSubcapsular cataracts can interfere with reading and create “halo” effects and glare around lights.\n\nPeople who use steroids, or have diabetes, extreme nearsightedness, and/or retinitis pigmentosa may\n\ndevelop this type of cataract. Subcapsular cataracts can develop rapidly and symptoms can become\n\nnoticeable within months.\n\nThis is the most common type of age-related cataract, caused primarily by the hardening and yellowing of the lens over time. “Nuclear” refers to the gradual clouding of the central portion of the lens, called the nucleus; “sclerotic” refers to the hardening, or sclerosis, of the lens nucleus.\n\nAs this type of cataract progresses, it changes the eye’s ability to focus, and close-up vision (for reading or other types of close work) may temporarily improve. This symptom is referred to as “second sight,” but the vision improvement it produces is not permanent. A nuclear sclerotic cataract progresses slowly and may require many years of gradual development before it begins to affect vision.\n\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP for short) is an eye problem seen in some premature babies.\n\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is an eye disease that can happen in babies born 1250 grams or less and who are born before 31 weeks gestation. These babies are at highest risk.\n\nIn babies with ROP the blood vessels in the retina have developed abnormally after birth. Most premature babies do not develop any ROP. In babies that do develop ROP, it is usually mild and goes away by itself, without causing any problems with vision.\n\nBabies born at a very early gestation can develop ROP where blood vessels grow abnormally and uncontrollably causing damage to the light sensitive layer of the retina.\n\nIn the worst case scenario this can lead to bleeding and scarring that can pull the retina away from the wall of the eye (retinal detachment) putting the baby at risk of becoming blind.\n\nHow to know of your baby is at risk\n\nWe cannot predict which babies will develop ROP. All babies weighing less than 1250 grams at birth will have regular eye examinations after their gestational age reaches 30 to 31 weeks. Eye drops are used to dilate the pupils. The examination only takes a couple of minutes. Your baby may be minimally upset by these examinations and will settle very quickly once the eyes have been checked.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of retinopathy of prematurity?\n\nRetinopathy of prematurity has no signs or symptoms. The only way to find it is through an eye exam by an eye doctor.\n\nAMD is a common condition. It is a leading cause of vision loss for older adults. This eye ailment can blur central vision. It happens when aging causes damage to the macula — the part of the eye that controls sharp, straight-ahead vision. The macula is part of the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye). The condition makes it difficult to see faces, read, drive or attend to work which requires close up vision.\n\nSymptoms\n\nLargely people with age-related macular degeneration do not have any obvious symptoms until the disease progresses. People with the eye problem may experience:\n\nBlurred (low) vision\n\nBlank or dark spots in your field of vision.\n\nThe appearance of waves or curves in straight lines.\n\nTypes of AMD\n\nThere are two types\n\nDry (atrophic):\n\nUp to 90% of people with macular degeneration have the dry form. Vision loss with the dry form tends to occur gradually. Most people don’t completely lose central vision.\n\nWet (exudative):\n\nThis condition occurs when abnormal blood vessels develop under the retina and macula. This type is more severe.
