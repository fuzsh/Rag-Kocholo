        "text": "Govinda Harishankar (1979)\n\nThe greatest Carnatic kanjira player who ever lived. Still to this day, musicians are in awe of what G. Harishankar was capable of with one hand. His was born on June 10, 1958 and died on February 11, 2002. G. Harishankar started on kanjira at a very young age with his father Govinda Rao, started formal mridangam training with the legend Palghat T.S. Mani Iyer and then later with C.S. Murugaboopathy. He also studied with Ramanathapuram Sri C.S. Sankarasivam. He plays kanjira right handed but mridangam left handed (it is said that he did so to prove that playing mridangam was not as hard as kanjira so he switched to playing mridangam left handed). G. Harishankar is responsible for furthering the complexity of modern kanjira playing in terms of advanced techniques for speed, power, rhythmic complexity and beauty in phrasing (left hand bending of the skin). It is said in India by many of the senior percussionists that performed with him or witnessed him play that he could top any mridangam player he was matched with in a concert during the percussion solos (thani avarthanam). G. Harishankar on several occasions even topped tabla player Zakir Hussain when they shared the stage in Malaysia and Europe. He had only a few students that carried on his secrets and techniques. Some of his best recorded playing was as a member of Sruthi Laya with Karaikudi R. Mani on mridangam, T.V. Vasan on ghatam, and Srirangam S. Kannan on morsing in the 1980s-1990s. To many in India, his death was proof that he was in fact human and not a god. YouTube Video 1. YouTube Video 2. YouTube Video 3.\n\nPalghat T.S. Mani Iyer (mridangam on left) and Palani Subramania Pillai (left hand kanjira on right, c. 1950s]\n\nPalghat T.A.S. Mani Iyer\n\nPalghat Mani Iyer, one of two of the greatest mridangam players ever, was born in 1912 in Palghat, Kerala and died in 1981. He was named Ramaswamy during Namakaranam (naming ceremony) but when introduced to the music world as a mridangam accompanist at the age of ten, he acquired the name \"Mani.\"\n\nHe first studied with Palghat Subba Iyer and Kalpathy Viswanatha Iyer. Later with Thanjavur Vaidanatha Iyer. Mani came into prominence after accompanying Chembai Vaidanatha Bagavathar in a music concert at Madras.\n\nHe was unusually talented in rhythm and quickly mastered the technique of the art of playing mridangam from his gurus and predecessors such as Azhaganambi Pillai, Dakshinamurthy Pillai and even studied the temple drumming of Kerala (panchavadhyam, chenda, edakka, among others).\n\nBefore Mani Iyer’s arrival in the music scene, the two mridangists Alaganambi Pillai and Dakshinamurthy Pillai (also a kanjirist), dominated the art of percussion playing. The innovations of Mani changed the style of mridangam playing as Y.G. Doraisamy points out: \"It was Mani Iyer who started the now prevalent trend of the mridangam, not just keeping the time with tekkas and moras, but actively accompanying the musical phrasing, so as to be a rhythmic running commentary, reproducing on the drum all the subtleties and rhythmic complexities of the musical composition.\"\n\nPalghat Raghu, a disciple of Mani Iyer, describes his guru as a genius in that he showed music followers the manner of blending with the music of the main artist in handling the kritis of every conceivable mood and tempo. By his consistent excellence he could raise the concert to thrilling heights. It was Palghat T.S. Mani Iyer who outplayed kanjira player Dakshinamurthy Pillai and reclaimed the front seat on the stage for mridangam players. Mani Iyer also occasionally performed on kanjira.\n\nPalani Subramania Pillai (c. 1940s)\n\nBorn in 1908 and died in 1962, never recognized formally with awards for his innovations in the art of mridangam and kanjira (most likely because of prejudice that he was not Brahmin). Palani Subramania Pillai was a contemporary of Palghat T. S. Mani Iyer. Equally skilled at mridangam and kanjira, he was a left handed player.\n\nHis technique on mridangam is said to have been the first to introduce the gumki or bending of the bass head by sliding and pressing the hand into the skin. His technique is said to have featured more rhythmic complexity while Mani Iyer featured more beauty in the phrases that he played and how they fit the music he was accompanying. Both players had extremely advanced rhythmic and accompanying skill, and there really is no comparing the two with regards to which was a better performer.\n\nP. Subramania Pillai was a student of his father Pazhani Muthiah Pillai and later Dakshinamurthy Pillai. In concert, Iyer and Palani were each other's favorite to accompany with as Mani played mridangam while Subramania played kanjira. One story goes that during one of their concerts in the percussion solos they traded phrases for an entire hour each not being able to top the other.\n\nPudukottai Manpoondia Pillai\n\nBorn in 1859 and died in 1922, Manpoondia Pillai is considered to be the father of the Pudukottai school of percussion. He is also said to have invented the kanjira, which is not really true as the instrument and players existed before his time. What he is responsible for is introducing the kanjira to Carantic instrumental and vocal music beyond bhajans. His life story of a lantern bearer at the Pudukottai palace who rose to become a high ranking artist is one of triumph of the human spirit.\n\nIn his palace job in the mid-1800s he was exposed to dholak and thavil players and became fascinated with thavil. Having first learned a frame drum local to the area (known then as daff), he soon became a student of thavil (he was left handed) and learned from Tirugokarnam Mariyappan.\n\nManpoondia (he was also known as Mamundi) displayed an unusual skill in that he could play all of the patterns he was shown that required 2 hands with 1 hand.\n\nHe also redesigned the kanjira of his time by reducing the number of jingles from 3 pairs to a single pair and replaced the ghungroo pellet bells that were common as jingles at that time with coins as the pellet bells made too much sound that distracted singers and other musicians. He also may have been the first to use Bengal monitor lizard skin (Varanus bengalensis bengalensis) in place of goat skin on kanjira making the instrument more suitable for Carnatic music.\n\nIt was Manpoondia Pillai that introduced a more complex laya into Carnatic music with his kanjira in the form of korvais and moras. He began accompanying bhajans and gained attention with his skill of being able with 1 hand to repeat anything a mridangam player could do with 2 hands at that time. Manpoondia Pillai is also said to have been influenced after hearing the mridangam playing of Narayanaswami Appa. Supposedly, after hearing Appa's playing, Pillai realized the tonal possibilities of melody oriented intricacies. This may have been how the bending technique on kanjira began to develop.\n\nHe began traveling around southern India to music centers introducing the kanjira and his skill at bhajan performances. Upon reaching Madras (now Chennai), Pillai was asked to accompany the singer Tiruvayyaru Subramaniya Iyer (also known as Patnam Subramaniya Iyer). Before the concert, Subramaniya Iyer challenged him and wanted to know what he was prepared to give up if he could not play what was sung at the concert. Pillai said that if he failed to play what was sung he was prepared to throw his kanjira into the sea and give it up completely. Subramaniya Iyer then said that if Pillai did play what was sung he would give up his place in the center of the stage to him and stop singing.\n\nSubramaniya Iyer had prepared an intricate pallavi and sang it at the concert. Manpoondia Pillai heard it and played it back and started elaborating on it using his imagination. Subramaniya Iyer accepted defeat and decided to concede his place to Pillai. Manpoondia Pillai humbly declared that it was not his place, and that it was his desire to continue to accompany Subramaniya Iyer's music wherever he sang. The two went on to give numerous performances all over Madras and other places and this established the kanjira as a prominent instrument suited for accompanying in Carnatic music concerts. This is also how the kanjira player began sitting in front of the mridangam player because his skill level was higher than that of the typical mridangist at that time.\n\nManpoondia Pillai is also responsible for training the first Carnatic singer in his refined rhythmic concepts (Konerirajapuram Vaidyanatha Iyer) as well as training percussionists Dakshinamurthy Pillai, Pazhani Muthiah Pillai, and Seithur Zamindar in his rhythmic style on kanjira and mridangam. This brought a much higher level of performance to the stage in such trio concerts with the singer, mridangam player and kanjira player all trained in this more refined rhythmic style.\n\nIn his last years, he renounced worldly life, becoming a sanyasi under the name of Murugananda Swamigal.\n\nS.V. Ramani (2005)\n\nBorn on April 30, 1966, S.V. Ramani learned from his father Sri P. R. Seshamani and later became the disciple of Sri Guruvayur Dorai.

He is also a gifted composer and instrument designer. He was born and raised in Bangalore, south India, where he studied Carnatic music for several years namely the venu with G. Venugopal and the mridangam with K.K. Parthasarthy. In 1976, he moved to Canada where he studied music theory and piano privately. He took part in a variety of workshops including Cuban bata rhythms, Brazilian samba, and was a member of the University of Montreal's Indonesian gamelan ensemble for a year.

Located in Chennai.\n\nNarayanaswami Appa (c. 1800s)\n\nBorn in Thanjavur, he started his career as a copyist in state service. Later, he learned mridangam from Sivaswamy Appa. His mastery was unparalleled and melodious and even the very fast and soft patterns carried a telling clarity and balance. He embellished concerts in which both the singers and audience realized the beauty of music from the way he complimented the songs. It is said that the left head of his mridangam (bass head) was tuned to the exact lower octave note of the right head (treble head). He would play mridangam for sometime and always check the tuning of his meettu (nam), chapu and thoppi (left side) with rava before any concert. The greatness of his fingers were so that it is said that his tuning would never go off. He was never known to have tuned a mridangam in the concert hall with the stone. He kept about 8 mridangams ranging from pitches \"D\" to \"A\". Even the artistes tuned their thambura and violin to his drone note. He also realized that the tip of the fingers had a significant role in producing nadham, and he avoided touching hard materials, for example the lintel of his cart was covered with velvet and if he needed to open doors of a train, he asked somebody to open it for him. He was also an accomplished singer, composer, flautist, and jalatharagam player. He accompanied great masters like Maha Vaidyanatha Iyer (1844--1893), Patnam Subramanya Iyer (1845–1902), Sarabha Sasthri, and Veena Seshanna.\n\nUmayalpuram K.

He is the only mridangam vidwan who has explored and placed before the world of art lovers his authentic information on the techniques and nuances of mridangam for more than three decades. He has introduced the fiberglass mridangam to Carnatic music for the first time, improvised a mechanical jig to eliminate human error in the molding of skins for both sides of the instrument and has done research work on tanned and untanned skins for the mridangam.

Only after coming under his tutelage, Mani Iyer started playing the \"arai chappu\" stroke (more common in modern mridangam playing). T.K. Murthy grew up as an adopted son in the maestro’s house and often played double mridangam with him in many concerts. Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman used to play any lesson in 4 speeds immediately after learning the nuances from Vaitha Anna at the young age of 14. Like the singing culture of vocalists, T.V. Iyer imparted a unique pedagogy based on his mridangam fingering and is today considered to be the \"Father of Mridangam.\" It is said that in his playing style, one can identify whether a pallavi, anupallavi, or charanam was being performed just by hearing his mridangam accompaniment. His other disciples include Mangudi Dorairaja Iyer (who wrote a book for learning mridangam), ghatam Vilvadhri Iyer, and Krishnamurthy Rao, among others.\n\nPalghat R.
