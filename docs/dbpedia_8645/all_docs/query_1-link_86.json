        "text": "Aruna Sairam (sometimes spelled Sayeeram) was born on 30 October 1952 in Mumbai. She received vocal training from her mother Rajalakshmi Sethuraman, who was a student of the Alathur Brothers and Thanjavoor Sankara Iyer. Her father Shri Sethuraman was a music connoisseur who hosted musicians and dancers in the family home. At one of these gatherings, Aruna met Sangita Kalanidhi Smt. T. Brinda, who trained her in the style of Veena Dhanammal.\n\nTrivia: Her niece is the former Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi.\n\nAllauddin Khan, was born circa 1862 (some speculate 1882) in what is now Bangladesh, and died on 6 September 1972. He was an Indian sarod player and multi-instrumentalist, composer and one of the most notable music teachers of the 20th century in Indian classical music. He became court musician for the Maharaja of Maihar, where he founded the Maihar gharana. His famous legacy: son Ali Akbar Khan, daughter Annapurna Devi, students Ravi Shankar, Nikhil Banerjee, Vasant Rai, Sharan Rani, Pannalal Ghosh, and many others.\n\nOriginally broadcast on All India Radio on 30 April 1960.\n\nBorn on 23 July 1947 in Chennai, L. Subramaniam made his first public appearance at age 6. Went on to earn a Master's degree in music and teach South Indian music at Cal Arts. He completed medical training at Madras Medical College and registered as a medical practitioner before leaving for the U.S.\n\nHe is also the father of Gingger Shankar, Ambi Subramaniam, and Bindu Subramaniam, and a brother of L. Vaidyanathan and L. Shankar.\n\nSince the 1993 Grammy award winning CD \"A Meeting By The River\" with V. M. Bhatt and Ry Cooder, the Water Lily Acoustics label has been attempting to get lighting to strike again by bringing together all kinds of disparate musicians.\n\nThis does not always result in wonderful music."
