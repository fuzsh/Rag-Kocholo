        "text": "Among the musical instruments, I am very fond of the Karnatic Instrument Vina and the Hindustani instrument Sitar….This does not mean that I do not like other instruments….I am talking it in relative terms, which may or may not be acceptable to others, for which I may be forgiven….\n\nMy special liking for Vina started from my young days, after listening to the Vadan by the great Vina Vidwan Doraiswamy Iyengar of the famous composition of ‘Venkatasaila Vihara’ by Subbaraya Sastri (Son of the Trinity Shama Sastri) in my favorite Karnatic raga Hamir Kalyani. I do not know how many times I heard this then, when I bought this disk. The melodic delight that I derived by listening to it was something unexplainable…. Though I have listened to the Vina recital of very many other great artists since then, my life-long attachment to the Vina recital of this particular composition by Doraiswami Iyengar, remained unchanged till this date…My liking for it was so intense, I mean…. If you wish, you can listen to it from the following link…\n\nMy craze, I should say, rather than mere liking, for Sithar Vadan started with the Back ground music given by Pdt. Ravisankar in Satyajit Ray’s ‘Pather Panchali’, in which he had played Sitar along with Bansuri wizard Pdt.Pannalal Ghosh & Master Tablaist Ustad Alla Rakha Khan. There was a time when I used to listen to the entire back ground music every day. With the efflux of time, when my music horizon got widened, my interest got diversified into the other aspects of it as well. But I still remember the impact created by Panditji’s background music in Pather Panchali, which was responsible for my going in search the melodic meadows of Hindustani Music… Shall we listen through the following link one of the back-ground music pieces of ‘Pather Panchali’…?"
