        "text": "From studying the depths of the earth's crust to developing new molecular pathways for drug development, young scientists are engaged in pioneering work in different laboratories across the country. Seven such scientists were given the CSIR Young Scientist Award for 2011 on Monday.\n\nEach award consists of a citation, a cash prize of Rs 50,000 and a plaque. The awardees are also entitled to a research grant of Rs 5 lakh a year for five years and an honorarium of Rs 7,500 per month till they attain the age of 45.\n\nDr Arun Singh of the National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad, won the award for his contribution to understanding of earthquakes in relation to mantle deformation patterns of the Indian plate. Dr Rajeev Saraswat of the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa, has developed techniques for studying relative strength of northeast and southwest monsoon during the past 1,40,000 years.\n\nThe award in chemical science category was given to Dr Dattatraya Hanumant Dethe of the National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, for developing new methods of synthesising biologically active alkaloids, while his colleague Dr Rahul Banerjee won the award for research relating to designing of new materials for hydrogen storage.\n\nDr Bikash Kumar Jena of the Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology, Bhubaneswar, Dr Amol Arvindrao Kulkarni of the National Chemical Laboratory, and Dr Kaushik Biswas of the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute, Kolkata are the other awardees.\n\nEleven winners of the prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize - India's highest science award - for 2011 were also announced by CSIR director general Samir Brahmachari.\n\nThe winners in different categories are Mahan Maharaj (Ramkrishna Mission Vivekananda University), Palash Kumar (Indian Statistical Institute), Amit Prakash Sharma (International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology), Rajan Sankaranarayanan (Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology), Balasubramanian Sundaram (Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research), Garikapati Narahari Sastry (Indian Institute of Chemical Technology), Shiraz Minwalla (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research), K. Narayanaswamy Balaji and Upadrasta Ramamurty (both of the Indian Institute of Science), Sirshendu De (IIT Kharagpur) and Shankar Doraiswamy (National Institute of Oceanography).\n\nThese awards will be presented by the Prime Minister later. The CSIR Diamond Jubilee Invention Award for School Children for 2010 was given to two inventions selected out of the 353 proposals received in various categories.\n\nShantanu Gangwar (on right in pic with science and technology minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and MoS Planning Ashwani Kumar) of Delhi Public School, R. K. Puram, won Rs 10,000 for developing an infra-red based path guidance system (smart stick) for the blind. Ankit Kumar Mittal (on left) of Dr Raghubir Parkash S. D. Sen Secondary School Barnala, Punjab, got Rs 5000 for developing a modified lock for zips that are used in travel bags and jackets. No entry was considered for the first prize worth Rs 50,000."
