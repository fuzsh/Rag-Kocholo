        "text": "Sairam Shankar and Adonika starer 'Romeo' will hit the screens on Oct 10th and Touchstone Doraiswamy, the producer of the movie, is excited about the release of the film.\n\nHe talks about the film, Sairam Shankar, Puri Jagannadh, Ravi Teja etc in an interview.\n\nExcerpts from the interview....\n\nVery impressive\n\nI'd completed my Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) at JNTU and I know Gopi Ganesh for many years. When he said that he is going to direct a film with the story provided by Puri Jagannadh, I said I will produce the film. he line narrated by Puri Jagannadh is very impressive and the film has a very new love story. We are very happy with the output of the film and the audiences will sure love the film.\n\nIt was the reason\n\nThe story of the film starts in Verona, where the lead pair meets. We'd shot the major part of the film in Switzerland at -9 degrees temperature. When we came back to India, we want to re-shoot some scenes in Switzerland. But as it was summer in Switzerland then we couldn't shoot those scenes. I don't want to compromise any where. So we have waited and it is the reason behind the delay.\n\nSairam looks very handsome\n\nGopi Ganesh is a workaholic and he has directed the film 10 times better what I expected. He took special care for the look of Sairam Shankar. Sai will be seen in a very handsome look compared to his previous films. He has acted superbly. Heroine Adonika is a born actress. She is very energetic and her expressions are very good.\n\nHe added value\n\nMadhura Sreedhar met me at an airport two to three months back and said that he wanted to talk with me about the film. He said that he loved the trailer of the film and after the discussions, he said that he wanted to release it. Puri has also agreed for it and Madhura bought it. After the inclusion of Madhura Sreedhar, the value of the film increased.\n\nThankful to Ravi Teja\n\nThe director and Puri Jagannadh thought Ravi Teja would fit the hero's brother role well and I should really thank Ravi Teja for immediately agreeing to act in the film. He has got a few scenes in the film, but his character is very important. He will entertain the audiences well.\n\nPuri is happy with him\n\nSunil Kashyap has provided a wonderful music score for our film. Puri is very happy with the music and said that all the songs are superb. The background score will also be good.\n\nLike 'Mathrudevobhava'\n\nAfter this film, I am going to make a film on how the problems between parents can affect children and the film will be hearttouching like 'Matrudevobhava'. I was really shocked and moved with the recent incident of an assistant professor killing his children because of problems with his wife.\n\nDoraiswamy assured that the film will give the audiences a very fresh feel and requested everyone to watch the film in theatres."
