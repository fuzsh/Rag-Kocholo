        "text": "This July, one feels Ragasudha is richer than a Swiss bank or the Ali Baba’s cave, rich with something far more precious than money- rich with chaste, sublime , uplifting and soothing music. We have the meeting of generations as Shri D. Balakrishna, son of the legendary Vainika Doraiswamy Iyengar, performs for Guruguhaamrta and young Ramya Kiranmayi Chaganti, granddaughter of the legendary Musician Shri Ivaturi Vijayeswara Rao sings for Sarvani Sangeetha Sabha. Naada Inbam, too, has some choice programs to offer. Sangita Kala Acharya Smt.Seetha Rajan is going to perform for Semmangudi mama’s birthday. A rare occasion indeed! July also heralds the birthday of Parama Rasika and the diehard fan of this hall- Nick Haynes. Nick is celebrating his birthday in true rasika style with a special ‘All Neravel’ concert by his favourite artiste Sumithra Vasudev. Shri Arunprakash is going to be performing a Lec Dem for Smt and Sri V Ananthanarayanan Memorial program with Amritha Murali and R K Shriramkumar and we all know how gripping his presentations are. Kalyanapuram Aravind is celebrating his grandfather’s memory with a concert by Saketharaman and Pushkaram Trust is celebrating with scintillating concerts by Kashyap Mahesh and Nanditha Kannan. The anniversary of Kedaram is always a very grand occasion at Ragasudha and this time, Heart beat drums, Madurai Sivaganesh, Amritha Murali and many others will be raising heart rates and serotonin with their enthralling performances. My friends Varalakshmi Anandkumar and Durga Venkatesh are dedicating the Ramapriya concert series to our dear SAFE Ramabhadran mama’s memory. Their Guru, the legendary Musician DKJ sir’s Birthday is celebrated with warmth by the DKJ family and disciples on 22nd July. This year, our Ragasudha favorite youngster V. Subashri is going to be performing on that occasion. Smt Mythili Ashok Kumar of Mathangi Chamber is in love with the bubbling enthusiasm of the young talents and as she flies from New Zealand to enjoy the golden era of Carnatic music at Ragasudha, she bubbles with youthfulness too. I have already marked in her series the duet concert of both my favorite Kutti Vainikas!!! The memory of the great Sathur is kept aloft by his children, the Sathur sisters year after year, and this year, Brindha Manickavasakan is the artiste chosen to sing a concert dedicated to him . Our friendly Ragasudha rasika from Calicut, Shri Nochur Narayanan, is celebrating Puthokode Krishna Iyer’s memory with a concert by Prasanna Venkatraman who never fails to pass in flying colours. Dear Rasikas, be with us in this celebration of music this month that is brimming with the richness of music!\n\nWhen musicians become organizers, the Ragas become the Sabhas!! June begins at Ragasudha with a lovely Flute concert by Sikkil Mala Chandrasekhar. This is a special event- for the inauguration of the new sabha “Bahudari” by Vidushi Meera Sivaramakrishnan, in memory of her mother Vidushi Radha Narayanan. This is taking place at Ragasudha on the 1st of June. The following day we have the Arangetram of a disciple of Vidwan Manoj Siva. An arangetram of a sabha followed by the Arangetram of an Artiste on the 1st and 2nd of a month respectively. History is made in the journey of Raga Sudha! The first Smt Andal and Sri.V Ananthanarayanan’s concert of this month will fill our ears with the strong and sweet tones of Vidwan Sunil Gargyan . This reminds me of the happy moment when he became a proud father right while he was giving his Karaharapriya concert for Kedaram at Ragasudha on 9th February 2024! The 2nd concert is a grand Instrumental Ensemble by talented young artists. To add to the musical breeze at Ragasudha, rasikas can enjoy the concerts of the talented young ladies Padmashree, Shreya Kolathaya and Athreyi Krishna this month. Tiruvarur Girish, who is presently touring the US and expected back anytime soon is organizing a marvelous concert series in his Brinda Repertory. Just like the majestic legend in whose honour the series is being conducted, there will be some magnificent programmes in this series- concerts of Vidwan R. K. Padmanabha, Vidwan Nagai Muralidharan, Vidwan T. M. Krishna. And then, Carva Trust is organising a wonderful concert. Madrasana’s 2nd enchanting episode is going to be the next attraction. We have excellent Lec Dems for Vidwan L. Krishnan and Vidwan MN Kandaswami Pillai’s Memorial Day. Our regular performer, rasika and friend, Dr.Ushalakshmi is going to give us a musical treat. This month ends on a very high note too! Vidwan Vignesh Ishwar will be performing for Shri B. Shivaraman centenary concert and Vidwan Shriramkumar is going to give us a sweet and interesting Lec Dem for the Shri. B. Shivaraman centenary Lec Dem. Dear Rasikas, do attend the Ragasudha concerts whenever you can. Hope to see you all at Ragasudha\n\nThe month of May symbolizes summer in its fullness. Music, as always, is cool and refreshing, and at Ragasudha, we do have this May filled with invigorating music! The month starts with Sarvani Sangeetha Sabha celebrating the Birthday of Late Smt. S. Vasanta (Founder, Sarvani Sangeetha Sabha) with a top-notch concert by Dr. Pantula Rama. Poongulam Sabesa Iyer’s family and Disciples remember his Birthday with a Grand concert by Vid.Amritha Murali.The young husband and wife team Y. G. Srilatha & Nikshith are giving a lovely Veena concert for Smt & Sri V.Ananthanarayanan memorial program. We have a splendid MadRasana program, too, dear Rasikas, which you may not want to miss out! A regular rasika who doesn’t want his name mentioned has planned a novel concert based on Thiruppugazh hymns with Vid.Bhavya Hari on sashti this month. Ramapriya Arts Foundation is presenting a concert by JS Sriram from Hyderabad.\n\nThe second half of this month is going to be a celebration of youth music!! All the youngsters have taken up the theme for their concert enthusiastically, and we are going to embark on a divine trip with them! Pushkaram, as the name suggests… auspicious flowing rivers and Guru in the various constellations, is bringing another uplifting youth concert series for this summer. We are celebrating the memories of the Great stalwarts of yesteryears Palani Subramania Pillai, Flute Mali, Shri Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar with musical programs.\n\nLet’s enjoy music this summer! Do try to be at Ragasudha in the evenings.\n\nApril is the birth month of Sri.S.V.Krishnan, the Founder of Naada Inbam and Ragasudha and we celebrate his Birthday along with many more celebrations.\n\nKURAL, the vibrant voice of the youth by an inspired team of youngsters is celebrating its first Birthday on the first of this month!\n\nWe cannot forget Rajamma mami and Kalyanaraman mama of Music Circle, who regularly conducted youth concerts at Ragasudha. On the 2nd we are remembering them fondly.\n\nThamarakkadu Govindan Nambudiri sir, an amazing musician from a far away village Thamarakkadu in Kerala on his way to receive the prestigious award and participate in the world famous Cleveland Festival is going to perform an unique 3 kriti concert of Dikshitar on the 3rd. This concert is supported by the family of Dr (Smt) Andal Ananthanarayanan & Sri. V. Ananthanarayanan in their loving memory.\n\nVidushi Suguna Purushothaman mami with her beaming smile and her uplifting music inspires us forever. We are celebrating her Birthday with a concert by her disciple Ramya Sarika. Vidushi Suguna Varadachari would be with us for the celebration.\n\nJega, a great connoisseur of music from Malaysia and his love for Violin can never be forgotten and Vidwan V V Ravi would give a solo concert in his memory.\n\nDr.R.S.Jayalakshmi mami has instituted an endowment to celebrate her father’s memory with an excellent Veena concert by Vidwan R.Parthasarathy.\n\nSVK Birthday festival itself, starting with the concert of CR Vaidyanathan, is a mix of young and experienced artists.\n\nVidushi Amritha Murali who is performing on SVK’s Birthday, on our request, is helping two groups of bright youngsters to present thematic group presentations for Tamil New Year and Sri Rama Navami.\n\nDr. Sumithra Vasudev, is going to present a very interesting concert with the theme ‘Avataaram sheididuveere’ based on characters in Ramayana.\n\nWe are very happy to be celebrating the Birthday of Sangitha Kalanidhi T.K.Govinda Rao with his disciples. We have some wonderful concerts by Rukmini Trust, and Kedaram this month. Padmakumar from Kerala too is organising some wonderful concerts this month. Dear Rasikas, let us celebrate music at Ragasudha in this birth month of SVK.\n\nDear Rasikas,\n\nDecember season is coming and every day is a celebration of Music! Though Ragasudha hosts concerts almost the entire year, a December festival is special and an enchanting magical time! We have artists, organizers and listeners coming in person from all around the world, and of course, our own Chennai rasikas spoilt for choice, wondering which concert to attend, and often Sabha hopping! This is the Margazhi Magic that makes Chennai the one stop destination for music lovers all around the globe, year after year. Naada Inbam and Ragasudha are delighted to be a part of this Grand Festival along with Parivadini, Kedaram, Sound Creed, Lakshmi Kuppuswami Trust, Sarvani Sangeetha Sabha, JB Cultural Foundation, Mathangi Fine Arts, Hamsanadam, Guruvamsham and Pushkaram Trust.\n\nWe sincerely hope that you will join us in this Royal celebration of Classical Music and make it a resounding success as you have always done in the past. For after all, what is a concert without rasikas!\n\nWe use this opportunity to thank all our patrons and donors who have given us unstinted support throughout. They are like pillars of strength not just for us as organisers,but are contributing to the propagation of Carnatic music at large.\n\nAs you may be aware of, our sponsorship amounts are used entirely for hosting concerts. We are open to donations however big or small, from rasikas, to take our efforts to greater levels.\n\nAll donations are exempt under Sec. 80G of I.T. Act.\n\nThank you in advance and wish you a glorious December, at the Raga Sudha!\n\nThanks to a lot of well-wishers and staunch Music rasikas, November has become a full month of beautiful concerts at Raga Sudha!\n\nVidushi Ramani mami wished 4 of Sangita Kalanidhi Vedavalli Amma’s senior disciples to perform, since this month happens to be the birthday month of her late husband, a great admirer of Vedavalli Amma’s music. It’s a lovely coincidence that Vedavalli amma’s birthday is also in November! The whole of 5th November is a date, with Muttusvami Dikshitar! Our ardent rasika (actually we should call him a great promoter, in his own quiet way) from Kerala, Padmakumar has arranged a lovely concert again. Ramapriya concerts, Sarvani concert and Sangeetha Mahotsavam concerts are all good concerts to attend. Aditya Balasundaram’s Sound Creed is presenting a star concert, right in the middle of this month and in the middle of Skanda Sashti celebrations also!! There is a theme to that too!! We are celebrating Shasti with Shriramkumar’s wonderful presentation thanks to the support of Lokanayaki Srinivasan, and Karthikai deepam with P.Akshaya’s thematic concert. Shri Shankar Raja was a great friend of my father, SVK. And his 90th Birthday is going to be celebrated in a way that would please him,our founder and the rasikas as well with Kalyanapuram Aravind’s superb music. This month ends with two bright youth concerts for Smt & Sri V Ananthanarayanan’s memory.\n\nSo rasikas, hope to see you at Ragasudha often in November!\n\nAugust definitely is a vibrant month at Ragasudha. With an abundance of young talents, Mythili Ashok Kumar’s Mathangi Chamber series is growing in number of days, as is her love for all the young talents. Sound Creed Aditya Balasundaram always comes up with unusual themes for his concert and thus Vignesh Ishwar is going to get philosophical this month. Don’t miss his interesting concert! Pushkaram concerts are always glorious.The Ananthanarayanans concerts this time, features vocal by Varalakshmi Anandkumar which would be a showcase of all that is tradition and DKJ, while the other by a team of brilliant young artists each with their own special talent is going to be a grand nextgen musical. Smt Aruna Ranganathan of Rukmini Arts and Music Trust is celebrating her Guru, the Legendary Vidwan, Bombay Ramachandran’s memory with four lovely concerts this month. Lakshmi Kuppuswami Trust celebrates 23rd 24th and 25th of August every year, with Music and Music Education, as its Convener is a great Academician as well as a Mridangam artiste Sri T K Venkatasubramanian from Delhi. This month’s real vintage treat would be from stalwart musicians Violin Sri M.Chandrasekharan sir, Sri Thamarakkadu Govindan Namboothiri sir, Smt.Suguna Varadachari madam and Dr.RS Jayalakshmi madam. Dear rasikas, do attend these programs and enjoy your time with good music. Hope to see many of you at Ragasudha.\n\nJuly seems to be a very happening month at Ragasudha.\n\nThe day 1 itself starts with the fine concert of Usha Padmanabhan, a highly talented disciple of Guru Smt Vedavalli Amma whom we rarely get to listen to.\n\nIf Ragasudha rasikas are asked to give star ratings to concerts, Pushkaram concerts always would be with 5 stars! This time it’s Pranathi Ganapuram and Vignesh Ishwar!!\n\nOur Ragasudha resident English gentleman is celebrating his birthday with a Vedavalli Amma’s disciple’s concert, and he has requested Sumithra to sing neravals from start to finish!!!\n\nThe Kalyanapuram Aravind family have arranged a concert by our Ragasudha favorite Amritha Murali to celebrate his grandfather’s memory.\n\nSarvani Sangeetha Sabha has arranged two senior concerts in memory of Sangita KalanidhiSri BMK.\n\nSound Creed Aditya Balasundaram always comes up with unusual and unique concerts. Srivathsan has taken up the challenge this month.\n\nSunil Gargyan, our Ragasudha favorite young star, is all set to take us on a fantastic trip to the six abodes of Lord Muruga. Kedaram bagged the highest rating this month by featuring the concert of superstar N.Vijay Siva and many more excellent concerts. Ramapriya Foundation being run by two amazing Vidushis care for quality more than glamour in their 3 days concert series. They have featured a really rare Thruppugazh musical by the veteran Vidushi Smt.Shyamala Venkateswaran. Mathangi Trust is back in action with two most vibrant concerts by Vidya Kalyanaraman and by Shruthi Shankar Kumar this month. This year at Music Circle, Rajagopal day is celebrated with the highly talented Lakshmipriya’s concert. Smt & Sri Ananthanarayanan remembrance concerts are going to be very delightful this month with the gifted youngster Nanditha Kannan performing on an amazing theme, and Shreelakshmi Bhat all set to give her solo concert at Ragasudha(first time at Ragasudha) Semmangudi Family is awarding our celebrated young star Ramakrishnan Murthy in the Doyen’s memory , followed by his concert. Sangita Kalanidhi DKJ’s Birthday is celebrated with a concert by the talent Girijashankar Sundaresan. We are going to have a most eagerly awaited concert by Sangita Kala Acharya Smt.Seetha Rajan on the Doyen of Carnatic Music Shri Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer’s Birthday. GURUGUHAAMRTA Mid-Year Music Festival at the end of the month is wonderful. Dear rasikas, do keep your evenings free to enjoy this eventful month at Ragasudha.\n\nThe May 2023 schedule is finally ready after all the hurdles!!\n\nSummer is the time when families plan holidays in cooler hill stations. Definitely the fine music in the air conditioned comfort of the Ragasudha Hall will be cooling physically and spiritually. We have lots of refreshing variety of concerts by youngsters this month to look forward to. To borrow their vocabulary, thats really cool! The regular Dr. (Smt) Andal & Sri. V. Ananthanarayanan Memorial concert features the bright Shakthi Muralidharan on 10th May and equally pleasing Veena Venkatramani with her traditional recital on the Veena on the 23rd. Veena on the Veena- not many artists are lucky to have their instrument as their name too!! Aditya Balasundaram’s Sound Creed is featuring two brilliant young artists Smt.Bhargavi Venkatram and Sri. Abhishek Ravishankar together on 13th May. I am sure this would definitely be challenging for both the artists. Both are planning for this with gusto. M.Shrikanth, Ragasudha’s favorite Violin accompanist is going to give a much awaited Solo concert this month on 12th May. Some of our favorite young artists from other cities are also going to perform this month – Ramya Kiranmayi from Hyderabad, Bhavana Iyer and Subhadra Sridharan from Bangalore, Shreya Kolathaya from Mangalore. And then Pushkaram ( even the name is cooling!) is back with its super Summer Fest 2023! Kedaram, Sarvani and Rukmini Trust are also presenting lovely concerts this month. I must say, May is packed with good music Dear rasikas, do try to attend as many concerts as possible!\n\nRagasudha looks like a delightful destination this March too! This month begins with the most anticipated Vechoor Harihara Subramania Iyer Remembrance concert (supported by his family) by Vidushi Smt.Suguna Varadachari. At Naada Inbam we are proud to have this concert of hers after which she is on her way to the US to receive the prestigious Sangita Ratnakara title at Cleveland! Next we have GCMA concerts and another delightful concert dedicated to Dr.P.K.Vaidyalingam. This month Naada Inbam is introducing many first timers with interesting thematic concerts, which would definitely be a sort of exam time for the youngsters, but I am sure they are going to be winners! Shri Arun Prakash has perfected a team of young Instrumentalists to perform a beautiful Instrumental Carnatic Orchestra. This amazing project has been supported by the family of Smt.Andal and Sri.V. Ananthanarayanan, to be presented on their wedding day. We have great programs dedicated to some of our most favorite musicians supported by their loving family – Vidwan Sethalapathi Balu sir and Vidwan Karaikudi Sri V.M.Ganesan. Mathangi, after the successful Gentlemen series in January is now presenting the Voice of Instruments series! Kedaram always upholds our value based sangeetham in all its Festivals. Sri Rama Navami is going to be a grand musical celebration with an absolutely fantastic finale on Rama Navami day by our amazing musician Thamarakkadu Govindan Nambudiri! Rasikas do make time for music and attend as many concerts as possible!!"
