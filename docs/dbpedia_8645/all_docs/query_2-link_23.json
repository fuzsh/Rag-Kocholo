        "text": "Start a venture during your MBA The fresh batch of MBA students will be joining their b-Schools this month. Life as an MBA student is exciting and time is always at a premium. Mostly, you will see you time awake being roughly equally divided between the following: 1. Acads 2. Placement prep 3. Committees and clubs 4. Case competitions and events 5. Fun socializing 6. Watching grass grow. I would like to convince some of you to bump 3 and/or 4 off this list and add ‘Venture’ to it. Advantages: 1. Low risk way to check out the viability of your venture idea 2. You don’t lose additional years of your life chasing a venture 3. You can leverage the expertise of your hostel mates, classmates, etc 4. Access to Profs and alumni is better when in campus 5. Access to campus resources like incubator, software, library, etc 6. You do pick up skills and connections over and above the usual 7. Being an MBA student opens doors which would be more difficult to open as a founder or corp exec 8. In case it doesn’t work out, it still is an amazing differentiator on your CV On day 1 of an MBA when I ask students – ‘How many of you want to start an enterprise?’, about 30% of the class raises their hands. The enthusiasm for their own venture peters out during the two years doing an MBA but still, over half of all MBAs start their own venture before the age of 50. So give your dreams a headstart. #startup #pgdm"
