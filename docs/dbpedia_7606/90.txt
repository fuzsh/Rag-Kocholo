Critical Conversations

Friday, October 15, 2021

Moderated by Linh Huynh

In honor of Latinx Heritage Month, join for a special movie discussion about the documentary Stolen Education.

Stolen Education documents the untold story of Mexican American school children who challenged discrimination in Texas schools in the 1950s and changed the face of education in the Southwest. The film documents not only a significant moment in Mexican American history, but also provides important context to understand our current educational system’s enduring legacy of segregation, discrimination, and racism.

Watch the movie on Vimeo before the movie discussion and come ready to share your thoughts.
