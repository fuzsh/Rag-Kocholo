Sinclair Broadcast, whose stock price has been battered over its plans to broadcast a documentary critical of Senator John Kerry, gained back some ground on Wall Street yesterday after it appeared to reduce how much of the film it would show.

The company's critics, which have included institutional investors, consumer groups and representatives of Mr. Kerry's campaign, were not mollified.

At the same time, the producer of the film, "Stolen Honor: Wounds That Don't Heal," which presents former prisoners of war denouncing Mr. Kerry's statements against the Vietnam War, said he was disappointed that the film might not be seen as fully as he had hoped.

Sinclair announced on Tuesday that it would not broadcast the entire film and that it planned to use segments in a special news program on 40 of its 62 stations tomorrow night. According to a press release, that program, "A P.O.W. Story: Politics, Pressure and the Media," will examine how politically charged films like "Stolen Honor" are being used in the campaign and how the news media treat their content.
