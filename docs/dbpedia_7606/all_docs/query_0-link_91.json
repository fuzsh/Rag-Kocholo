CItizenship and military service have been very difficult to research and yes, the Immigration Act of 1924 shut down almost all legal avenues for non-European citizens to emigrate. However, it seems nothing, not even the aforementioned Act of 1924, would have necessarily prevented him from moving to Hawaii as a young man.

It seemed odd, as there were a large number of first and second generation Japanese living in the US by the time of the war.\n\nThis is lifted word for word from an article on Cracked. As such, it has the same problems as the article did.\n\nFirst, it is not strongly implied that Miyagi was born in America to Japanese parents. He explicitly says that he grew up in Okinawa and he has a heavy accent. He shows Daniel a picture of his pregnant wife and says, \"look, look, first American born Miyagi waiting to be born.\"\n\nSecondly, there is no mention anywhere in any of the movies that Mr. Miyagi ever attended UCLA or any other university. I found this thread because I did a Google search on Miyagi attending UCLA. The only mentions of this anywhere, it seems, are on the original Cracked article and on sites where people have copied it.\n\nThird, there is nothing in any movie in the franchise that even hints at him being forced into an internment camp. His wife was held at the Manzanar Relocation Center while he was serving. That was a common situation for many of Japanese descent who were serving in the military during the war.\n\nBorder security in the US in the 1920s or 1940s was nothing like it is today - and even today it is still evidently not that difficult to beat. We are also talking about a period in time where records were kept on paper and weren't nearly as difficult to fake. Miyagi already demonstrated that he didn't exactly hold the law in high regard. He drove around for years without even having a driver's license. In those times, it would have taken very little effort for him to come to the United States, especially if he came through Hawaii, which wasn't even a state at that time, where there was already a large Japanese population that would have readily taken him in.\n\nPat Morita may have only been 52 when the first movie was made, but he looked a hell of a lot older than that. Miyagi was clearly meant to be a person in his late sixties or early seventies at the time of the first movie. That aligns perfectly with someone who came to the US as a young man shortly before the war."
