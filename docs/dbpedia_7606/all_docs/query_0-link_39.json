        "text": "Callahan County, an agricultural region outside Abilene, Texas, is a place where people pay attention to their neighbors. Bart Kendrick, whose family has lived in the county since the nineteenth century, takes particular notice of vehicles. (When I visited him, he greeted me by saying, “Nice truck. What year is it?”) Last summer, Bart saw something odd at a nearby house. In the morning, a pickup truck was parked in front of the garage. In the evening, the truck had been replaced by a patrol car. When Bart went to introduce himself to his new neighbors, no one answered the door. The yard was weedy; the windows were covered with aluminum foil.\n\nIn December, Bart and his wife, Amber, read in the local paper that Leroy Foley, a police officer in the nearby town of Clyde, was running for sheriff of Callahan County. In Foley’s public filings, he listed the neighboring house as his residence. To Bart, it seemed obvious that Foley didn’t live there but was merely using it as a place to switch out his vehicle after work. The Kendricks did a little digging and discovered that Foley lived fifty-five miles away, in another county, which under Texas law made him ineligible for the position.\n\nBart is a deliberate man with a long, wiry beard. If something strikes him as wrong, he feels obligated to fix it. Just before my visit, one of the family’s cats was killed by a raccoon. After Bart buried her, he reviewed his security-camera footage to identify the culprit, then spent several nights perched in a tree with a pistol until he got his revenge. Foley’s apparent lie about his residence offended Bart. He began to film himself knocking on the door and getting no answer. He photographed the trash can by the road to show that its contents never changed.\n\nFoley promised to professionalize the sheriff’s department. He called the current deputies “a bunch of yahoos” and mocked them for wearing cowboy boots instead of tactical shoes. A tall man with a square jaw and closely cropped hair, he touted his eleven years as a member of the 75th Ranger Regiment, an élite special-operations Army unit. He talked about his sniper training and the bullets he’d taken for his country. On his campaign Facebook page, he displayed his medals: a Silver Star, for valor in combat, and a Purple Heart. “I was born a protector and an overwatcher,” he told a local television station.\n\nFoley’s opponent in the Republican primary was Rick Jowers, a mild, approachable sheriff’s deputy with a handlebar mustache. Jowers was well known, and largely well liked, throughout the county; I heard stories of people calling him for help wrangling loose goats and managing family disputes. “He was a darn good deputy,” Terry Joy, who had been the sheriff of Callahan County since 2013, told me. “He did his job good, got along with people good.” Jowers had worked for the sheriff’s office for eight years, five of them as chief deputy. “He was just a good old country boy who wanted to help you. Someone you could actually call and feel comfortable about it,” said Marcia Shumway, a local stay-at-home mom and home-school teacher, who, with her husband, Paul, supported Jowers in the race.\n\nFoley repeatedly invoked his time in the Army. “I’m not cop-trained, I’m military-trained,” he said, during a debate in Cross Plains, in January. “I’m on time, like all military people are. I’m respectful, like all military people are.” Jowers seemed thrown by his opponent’s tough-guy posturing, and offered a different vision for law enforcement in the county. “My military doesn’t have nothing to do with what I’m doing for the county right now,” he said. He added that he, like Foley, was an Airborne Ranger with combat wounds: “I served my country, I took a bullet for my country . . . but we’re not going to try to run our sheriff’s department like the military.”\n\nAround Christmas, Bart Kendrick went public on Facebook with his accusation about Foley’s residency, sure that it would tank his candidacy. Instead, people called Bart a stalker. He was disheartened by the community response, but his wife was energized. She scoured Foley’s social-media accounts, trying to find other holes in his story. One evening, she mentioned Foley’s military medals to her father, a retired colonel in the Air Force. “He said, ‘A Silver Star—that’s, like, never given out,’ ” Amber told me. “And he said, ‘There are places out there that will research things like this.’ ”\n\nOn January 13th, Amber filled out a form on Military Phonies, one of a number of Web sites dedicated to exposing people who invent or inflate their military service. “I am concerned that he may not have received [the medals] but is implying that he has,” she wrote. “My father served 30 years in the Air Force and I have regard for servicemen. I just need help in finding out if he does indeed have these medals.”\n\nThat night, a representative from Military Phonies e-mailed Amber, saying that it usually took the group several weeks to put together a complete record, and pointing her to a list of Silver Star recipients compiled by a military historian named Doug Sterner. Foley was not on the list.\n\nThree weeks later, Military Phonies published the results of its investigation, concluding that Foley was indeed an Army veteran but that his career was much less élite than he had claimed. There was no evidence that he was an Airborne Ranger or a sniper, that he had received a Purple Heart or a Silver Star, or that he had been wounded in combat.\n\nThe Facebook page for the Clyde Police Department was soon flooded with comments from angry people across the country: “Hey Clyde PD, you have a POS Poser in your midst”; “Leroy Grant Foley those brand new cuff links will look good on you.” Foley was placed on administrative leave. It turned out that he had submitted a doctored DD 214—the record of military service—when he applied for his position, crediting himself with such honors as the Saudi Arabian Liberation Medal and the Sniper Badge, neither of which exist. Within a few days, Foley resigned. “I can’t answer why somebody would do those types of things. In reality, he’s an honorably discharged military veteran,” Robert Dalton, the Clyde police chief, told me. “It doesn’t make sense.”\n\nPoliticians lie to get us into wars; generals lie about how well things are going; soldiers lie about what they did during their service. In 1782, when George Washington awarded ribbons and badges to valorous Revolutionary War troops, he was already worrying about pretenders. “Should any who are not entitled to these honors have the insolence to assume the badges of them they shall be severely punished,” he wrote. When Walter Washington Williams, thought to be the last surviving veteran of the Confederate Army, died, in 1959, President Eisenhower called for a national day of mourning. It turned out that Williams had fabricated his service, and that the second-longest-surviving Confederate soldier probably had, too. In fact, according to the Civil War historian William Marvel, “every one of the last dozen recognized Confederates was bogus.” But it’s only recently that lying about military service has been considered a particularly heinous form of lying, one with its own name: stolen valor.\n\nThe phrase originated with B. G. (Jug) Burkett, a Texas stockbroker and a Vietnam veteran, whose attempts, in the nineteen-eighties, to raise funds for a memorial to Vietnam veterans from Texas were made difficult, he wrote, by the stereotype that soldiers who returned from the war were “losers, bums, drug addicts, drunks, derelicts—societal offal who had come back from the war plagued by nightmares and flashbacks that left them with the potential to go berserk at any moment.” In 1988, Burkett read a story in the Dallas Times Herald about Carl Dudley Williams, a homeless man who had shot and killed a police officer. The Times Herald reported that Williams was a Vietnam veteran; one of the paper’s columnists wondered whether “Vietnam did that to him.” On a whim, Burkett filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain Williams’s military records and discovered that he had never served in Vietnam.\n\nBurkett began FOIA-ing with abandon. He requested the records of a Green Beret who signed autographs for kids at parades: faker. He looked into the Navy SEAL and the Green Beret who operated San Antonio’s Vietnam War Museum: both liars, although each thought that the other was legit. He found that the actor Brian Dennehy, famous for playing Rambo’s law-enforcement antagonist in “First Blood,” had lied about suffering combat wounds in Vietnam. (Dennehy served five years in the Marines, but never in Vietnam; he apologized after Burkett went public with his accusation.) Burkett caught so many people distorting or inventing their military service that he wondered whether the dissemblers might be evidence of “a national phenomenon, a weird ripple in the American psyche.” By 1989, Burkett was averaging one FOIA request a day. He wrote that an official at the National Archives told him that he was “probably the Archives’ number one individual FOIA user.”\n\nIn 1998, Burkett self-published “Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation Was Robbed of Its Heroes and Its History,” which he wrote with the investigative journalist Glenna Whitley. The nearly seven-hundred-page book explored many of Burkett’s preoccupations—that P.T.S.D. was an overdiagnosed condition cooked up by antiwar leftists; that accusations of war crimes in Vietnam were overstated—but what captured readers’ attention was his exposure of military fakers. “This was pre-social media, and it started going kind of viral,” Whitley said.\n\nEven so, there were only a handful of people regularly investigating false military claims. “Basically, there were three of us—myself, Jug Burkett, and a couple out of Missouri,” Doug Sterner, who calls himself an “accidental stolen-valor researcher,” told me. Sterner, who returned from Vietnam with two Bronze Stars, learned how to navigate the military-records system while compiling a database of people who’d been given the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military award. Like Burkett, Sterner verged on the obsessive. By day, he managed an apartment building in Pueblo, Colorado; in his spare time, he maintained lists of medal recipients and wrote eighty-one books, the majority about military history. (His best-sellers are not about war, however. “My wife is a big fan of ‘Fifty Shades of Grey,’ so I wrote some books in that vein for our fortieth anniversary, and they sell more than all my other books combined,” he told me, sounding a little abashed.)\n\nSterner had never intended to expose fakers—he was more interested in the real heroes—but he kept running across them. At a gathering for honorees, in the nineties, a short man approached Sterner, holding a photograph of a man wearing a medal. “I hear you’re something of a Medal of Honor historian,” he said. “Can you identify this man for me?” Sterner peered at the image. “I said, ‘Well, that’s the Air Force design of the Medal of Honor. There’ve only been thirteen Medals of Honor awarded by the Air Force in history. Only five of them are still living, and he’s not one of them, so this guy’s a phony.’ And he stuck his hand out and said, ‘Glad to meet you, I’m Tom Cottone with the F.B.I.’ And that started our friendship.”\n\nWhen Sterner learned of a fraudulent Medal of Honor claim, he’d pass the information along to Cottone. The work sometimes made him uncomfortable. When a woman wrote to Sterner insisting that her husband be added to his Medal of Honor database, Cottone asked Sterner to pretend to believe her. “I felt I was doing something really pretty dirty—leading this woman on to help her incriminate her husband so the F.B.I. could go in and take his medal,” Sterner said. When he shared his anxieties, Cottone told him that, if a person was lying about his service, he was often lying about more substantial things, too.\n\nAt the time, wearing an unearned military medal was against the law, but there was no particular consideration given to lies about military service; the same chapter of the federal statute also made it illegal to proffer a fake police badge, pretend to be a member of 4-H, or misuse the likeness of Smokey Bear. That began to change in 2004, after an Arizona man was featured in a local newspaper as a highly decorated veteran who had, among other improbable exploits, assisted in the capture of Saddam Hussein. Sterner helped expose him as a liar, but he was frustrated that there was no criminal penalty. It wasn’t illegal to lie about a medal—it was only when you pinned it on your lapel that you broke the law. Pam Sterner overheard her husband and Cottone ranting about the current law’s toothlessness. “It was a venting session that at times became very loud, earnest, and hard to ignore,” Sterner wrote in “Restoring Valor: One Couple’s Mission to Expose Fraudulent War Heroes and Protect America’s Military Awards System.” His vehemence at first irritated Pam, who had gone back to school to study political science and had an assignment due the next day; then it inspired her. In her final paper, she proposed criminalizing false claims about the nation’s highest medals. She got an A. Then she decided to try to get the legislation passed.\n\nThe Sterners’ timing was fortuitous. In the period after 9/11, ninety-one per cent of Americans were proud of U.S. troops, according to a Pew survey, and the military was the most trusted institution in the nation. Accompanying that trust was mounting anxiety that it could be abused. The Stolen Valor Act of 2005, written in part by Pam Sterner, was introduced the year that millions of filmgoers watched “Wedding Crashers,” in which Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson’s characters lie about being Purple Heart recipients. On September 7, 2006, the act, which made it a federal crime to falsely claim receipt of a military award or decoration, passed in the Senate by unanimous consent; President George W. Bush signed it into law soon afterward. But, six years later, in United States v. Alvarez, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Xavier Alvarez, a water-district official in Southern California, who had been convicted of lying about receiving the Medal of Honor. (Alvarez had also falsely claimed to be a professional ice-hockey player and to have been married to a Mexican movie star.) The Court found that the Stolen Valor Act violated the First Amendment. Congress passed an amended statute, which made it illegal to fraudulently wear medals, embellish rank, or make false claims of service in order to obtain money or some other tangible benefit, making stolen valor an issue of fraud rather than of speech. But, in his majority opinion in Alvarez, Justice Anthony Kennedy had suggested another way forward. “Once the lie was made public, he was ridiculed online,” he wrote. “There is good reason to believe that a similar fate would befall other false claimants.”\n\nIn 2015, Eric Lindinger, a Gulf War veteran, had a job that involved a lot of cross-country driving. He kept having odd interactions with strangers. He’d be enjoying an All-Star Special at Waffle House, where veterans can get a ten-per-cent discount, when a man would start asking questions about his military service. The guy would usually be polite, but the interactions felt more like interrogations than like conversations. “They’re always loaded questions,” Lindinger told me. “They’ll be, like, ‘You were over there in 1992, right?’ Because, if I say yes, he’s caught a phony.” I asked him how often these encounters happened, and he gave a rasping chuckle. “I’m laughing because it happened a lot,” he said.\n\nAs Justice Kennedy predicted, public shaming has become the de-facto response to suspected stolen valor. Last year, a Montana judge required that, as a condition of their parole, two men who had falsely claimed veteran status must stand at the Montana Veterans Memorial with placards that read “I am a liar. I am not a veteran. I stole valor. I have dishonored all veterans.” Typically, though, punishment is meted out online.\n\nResearching potential phonies was once a lonely enterprise; now there are a dozen Web sites, message boards, and Facebook groups that provide instruction and crowdsource the work. The activity has become a type of bonding exercise for former service members; some even seem to be reliving their war experience when hunting down phonies. (On StolenValor.com, exposed liars are “secured targets.”) In a forum called Special Forces Brothers, which is associated with Guardians of the Green Beret, fifty-seven hundred current and former Green Berets help vet claimants. Military Phonies gets more than a hundred thousand unique views on a good day, according to the Web site’s administrator.\n\nDocumenting and debunking fakers has become easier as more of our lives have moved online. People lie about their service in YouTube clips, Facebook posts, and text messages; researchers have exposed a man who claimed on a dating site to have been on the SEAL team that took out Osama bin Laden, and another who posted photographs of himself wearing a Green Beret uniform on his wedding day. A few of Military Phonies’ half-dozen volunteer researchers are registered private investigators, which allows them access to specialized databases. “We look at what they post on the Internet, who they’re talking to, what they’re saying,” the Web site’s administrator told me. “We’ll do a FOIA, and we’re very specific about the information we ask for—what units they may have been in, what awards they could’ve had, the time they served, what their discharge rank was, and their combat history.”\n\nEd Caffrey began following stolen-valor Web sites when he was on active duty in the Air Force. He set up Google news alerts for key phrases: “prisoner of war,” “Navy Cross.” “I started coming across these guys putting themselves in local media as heroes,” Caffrey told me. “The first one claimed he served in the unit from ‘Band of Brothers’ and also stormed the beach at Normandy—it just didn’t make any sense.”\n\nThe lies that people tell shift with the appetites of the era. Veterans of the Second World War placed themselves at the sites of iconic battles, even when they were stationed far away. People falsely claiming to have served in Vietnam often used the war to explain some failure or trauma in their personal lives—their homelessness or their struggles with addiction. With the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq came a surge in young men who said that they were élite commandos; in the weeks after the raid that killed bin Laden, phony SEAL claims doubled, according to one researcher.\n\nCulture shapes lies, too. “When ‘Rambo’ came out, everyone was a Green Beret. After ‘The Hunt for Red October,’ everyone was a submariner,” Don Shipley, who investigates fake Navy SEALs, told me. Shipley is one of the most prominent figures in the field, the closest thing it has to an influencer. “I’m lethal with a keyboard—you can’t lie to me,” he has said. After more than two decades with the Navy, he worked as a contractor for Blackwater in Afghanistan and Pakistan, then ran Extreme SEAL Experience, a camp where civilians paid more than two thousand dollars for a week of simulated SEAL training. A decade ago, Shipley began posting YouTube videos debunking false SEAL claims. “There were other guys doing this before me, but I’m the guy that took it to YouTube,” he told me.\n\nShipley studied how to make a video go viral. “You gotta be entertaining, you gotta be funny,” he said. “You always want to put a pretty young lady in a video if you can swing it.” He started telephoning suspected liars, baiting them into telling ridiculous stories, and exposing them. “It went big really kinda quick,” he said.\n\nWhile Sterner and other early stolen-valor researchers worked largely behind the scenes, Shipley’s videos were as much about his life as about the men he exposed. His wife, Diane, a platinum-haired straight-talker, was a regular guest, as were the couple’s many dogs, ducks, and grandchildren. The YouTube channel quickly grew popular with veterans, police officers, and firefighters. “I have entire National Guard units that spend their weekends watching my videos on a big screen in an auditorium, seeing what Don is doing,” Shipley said. He’s been surprised by how many older women watch, too. By last year, his videos had been viewed fifty million times.\n\nThe interviews present a satisfying moral clarity: Shipley, a broad, deep-voiced man with lush hair, plays the role of the good soldier, confidently asserting his dominance over the dissembling faker. When a liar’s story starts to spin wildly out of control, Shipley cocks an eyebrow. The liar inevitably starts calling him “sir.” “I took lessons from Patton,” Shipley said. “If you want to keep people’s attention, you start cursing.”\n\nWhen the phone calls became routine, he and Diane travelled to a half-dozen states, sometimes staking out phonies’ houses and confronting them on camera. Shipley tried to keep things more or less professional, but his fans could be less scrupulous. “Some guys were just really out for blood,” he said. “They would track down the guy’s family, his mother, his wife. They would send them harassing e-mails, or they’d get a phone number and post that up on YouTube, and people would be calling it really late.”\n\nShipley’s videos belong to a genre known as justice porn, which Urban Dictionary defines as “getting off on watching someone get their due for being a scumbag piece of shit.” Justice porn allows us to indulge our baser instincts, ostensibly in the service of righteousness.\n\nSince Shipley started his channel, confrontations between service members and potential impostors have become wildly popular on YouTube. They amass millions of views and are re-aired on Fox News and on the program “Tosh.0.” They tend to follow a standard template: the accuser confronts a suspicious stranger in uniform in a big-box store or a mall food court, barraging him (or, rarely, her) with questions about where and when he served. The accused mumbles nonsensical answers before slinking off, exposed and humiliated. The videos, with their blend of vigilante justice and public callouts, hit several social-media sweet spots; watching them makes me feel both rapt and queasy, particularly when the accuser’s anger feels disproportionate to the situation. “It’s clear this is about way more than just stolen valor,” the comedian Ian Fidance, who has made a series of parody stolen-valor videos, told me. “They served their country, now they have to get a normal job, maybe they have P.T.S.D., maybe they’re not getting help from the V.A. It’s like cancelling someone online—you can’t fix the bigger problem, so you just attack this stranger.”\n\nShipley partly blames himself for seeding these confrontations. “I came out swinging so hard at these guys on the Internet that I brought on flocks of these junior G-men who have nothing to do but patrol Walmart and accost people,” he said. On Reddit, civilians share stories of getting called out for wearing military-themed hoodies, and worry about whether they’re stealing valor by wearing camouflage pants. An Iraq War veteran was jumped and had his leg broken outside a Sacramento bar by two men who thought he was lying about being a marine. Bob Ford, a former marine in his seventies, was harassed in front of a crowd by two men who were suspicious because his belt buckle appeared too ornate for his rank. “I thought I was going to have a heart attack on the spot,” Ford told the podcast “Reply All.” Some of the most uncomfortable stolen-valor videos involve confrontations with people who appear to be confused, mentally ill, or homeless. “On the Reddit boards, people will talk about what makes them suspicious that someone is not a real vet,” Kristiana Willsey, a folklorist at the University of Southern California who studies military narratives, said. “Often, if someone is not a paragon of traditional masculinity—if you don’t look like Bradley Cooper playing Chris Kyle—your claims are more suspect.” (After the death of Kyle, the soldier whose story was the basis for “American Sniper,” the Intercept revealed that in his memoir he had awarded himself one more Silver Star and one more Bronze Star than he had earned.) “The hard part,” Shipley said, “is that nobody believes anybody anymore.”\n\nLast February, YouTube suspended Shipley’s channel for harassment. Shipley admits that he sometimes broke the platform’s rules against releasing individuals’ personal information, but he contends that he was deplatformed for political reasons: he had been digging into the background of Nathan Phillips, a Native American veteran who appeared in a viral video with a student from Covington Catholic High School. (Phillips has claimed that he served during “Vietnam times,” but he was actually a reservist who never served in Vietnam; he also went AWOL a number of times.) These days, subscribers pay ten dollars a month for access to the Shipleys’ video library, along with regular live streams, Diane’s recipes for “Big Ass Meatballs” and “ass kickin cornbread,” and Don’s duck-hunting tips.\n\nSome of the so-called valor thieves busted by Shipley and others fit Tom Cottone’s description—their lies about their military service are part of a larger pattern of deception. Con men posing as military heroes trade on the respect and deference granted to veterans, using claims of service to win investors’ confidence, receive veterans’ benefits, or secure government contracts. Grifters lie about being war heroes, then steal money from women they meet on dating sites. People in positions of trust use military credentials to bolster their authority; pastors, sheriffs, and politicians are regularly featured on stolen-valor Web sites. (Other patterns Shipley has noticed: there is a disproportionate number of phonies in Georgia, liars tend to be junior enlisted men, and stolen valor is “primarily a white problem.”)\n\nIn many instances, though, the motivations are muddier. An agent at the Naval Criminal Investigative Service told me that most cases of stolen valor don’t involve career criminals. People who lie about having served often seem less interested in money than in belonging to an esteemed group. Marc Feldman, a psychiatrist who specializes in factitious disorder, a diagnosis that is given primarily to women who feign or produce illness or injury for emotional gratification, sees stolen valor as a less-studied offshoot of the same syndrome. “The role of ‘patient’ is well defined in our society,” he said. “One of the appeals of patienthood is the special dispensation—we reduce our expectations of that person, we give them attention.” The role of veteran, which comes freighted with its own set of expectations and benefits, is similarly alluring. Most stolen-valor cases don’t involve master criminals but, rather, average men who want to be treated as if they were extraordinary.\n\nAfter Leroy Foley’s lies about his military service were exposed, Rick Jowers seemed certain to win the Republican primary and therefore become Callahan County’s next sheriff, since no one was running as a Democrat. Then people started bringing up the comments that Jowers had made during a debate with Foley. “Has anyone looked into Chief Deputy Rick Jowers past?” someone asked on Facebook. “He also stated that he was a military veteran that was shot while serving his country.”\n\nIn response, Jowers posted an image of his DD 214, but it was oddly cropped, with key information outside the frame. Bart and Amber Kendrick were taken aback. “We were so focussed on Foley, we didn’t even think about Jowers,” Bart said. Military Phonies was already looking into Jowers’s background. “As soon as I watched that video” of the debate, the Web site’s administrator told me, “I was, like, Let’s FOIA both these guys.”\n\nThat evening, Jowers, on a call with his supporter Paul Shumway, started weeping. “He’s, like, I screwed up, I told a little lie and it got big,” Shumway, a veteran of the Air Force, said. Jowers knew that Military Phonies was about to release his military records, which would show that he was not an Airborne Ranger, and that he had not been wounded in combat. In fact, he had served as a private in the Army, gone AWOL in Germany, and received an “other than honorable” discharge. Jowers told Shumway that he’d left Germany when his father suffered a heart attack, and had been kept away by a series of tragedies: his mother’s death in a car crash, his sister’s suicide, his brother’s death. “He struck me as sincere,” Shumway said.\n\nJowers released a statement, apologizing for misleading the community and claiming that he had distorted his record because he had been “upset and angry at a certain person”—presumably Foley. Some Callahan County residents were ready to forgive him. “I think he just got caught up in the moment,” Sheriff Joy said. “He made one little mistake and look what happened.” But when Shumway’s wife, Marcia, Googled Jowers’s siblings, she discovered that they had died more than a decade after his military service. And as far back as 2007, when Jowers applied to work at the Taylor County jail, he claimed to have been an Airborne Ranger. Jowers withdrew from the race and resigned his job with the sheriff’s department. “He lied till the end,” Shumway said. ♦"
