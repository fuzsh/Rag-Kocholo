        "text": "Sandwich Day\n\nLiz (Tina Fey) gets a phone call from her ex-boyfriend Floyd (guest star Jason Sudeikis), whose flight has been cancelled and needs a place to stay overnight. After a decision by the Board of Directors, Jack is demoted down to the 12th floor causing him to question his future with the company. Meanwhile, itâs Annual Sandwich Day at TGS, and the Teamsters give delicious sandwiches to the staff from a mysterious sandwich shop in Brooklyn. Liz is furious when her sandwich is stolen forcing Tracy (Tracy Morgan), Kenneth (Jack McBrayer), Jenna (Jane Krakowski) and Frank (Judah Friedlander) to uncover the secret location from the Teamsters leader Mickey J (guest star Brian Dennehy). Scott Adsit, Lonny Ross and Maulik Pancholy also star. Rip Torn, Jason Sudeikis and Brian Dennehy guest star.\n\nScheherezade\n\nStabler visits dying lung cancer patient Judson Tierney who's itching to clear his conscience before he goes. Unable to get estranged daughter Sheila to come visit, Benson serves as her replacement as Tierney fesses up to his career in crime before 1971. It was in that year that he murdered his partner and took baby Sheila in to raise as his own to protect her from the hate in that household and give her a better life. However, with an innocent man now imprisoned on murder charges for 35 years, Novak and company fight to get Tierney's confessional testimony into evidence. Tierney helps clear the man's name and catches a momentary glimpse of his daughter before he passes away.\n\nNinety Miles Away\n\nSpeculations surround the nexus between Communist Cuba and the democratic United States. Bartlet is propelled into a dubious conundrum--continue secret talks with Cuba's ailing dictator and lift an antiquated embargo or yield to bipartisan political fallout and reaffirm 40-year-old sanctions. Meanwhile, Leo and Kate discover they have more in common than politics. Brian Dennehy guest stars as Senator Rafe Framingham.\n\nA Defense Of Marriage\n\nAlicia and Diane agree to let a famous liberal lawyer (Jeremy Breslow) aid them on their latest case, but they soon realize he may not have their client's best interests in mind. Meanwhile, Alicia's mother (Stockard Channing) arrives for Thanksgiving seeking moral and legal support from Alicia and her brother Owen. Brian Dennehy returns as Lawyer Bucky Stabler and Bebe Neuwirth returns as Judge Friend.\n\nThe Art Of War\n\nWhen a female military officer (Amanda Peet) accuses a civilian contractor of attempting to rape her in Afghanistan, Alicia tries to prove that he is not protected by a law prohibiting servicemen from suing the military. Meanwhile, a surprising new obstacle appears in Peter's quest for the governorship. Maura Tierney and Denis O'Hare return as guest stars, and Brian Dennehy guest stars as Opposing Counsel Bucky Stabler. Series Star Josh Charles makes his directorial debut."
