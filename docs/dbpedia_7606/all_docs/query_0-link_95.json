        "text": "I recently got sucked down into the stolen valor rabbit hole and came across something sobering. It is easy to get caught up in it all. To see someone claiming honor and service falsely, man, it's infuriating. Insulting. Look at this guy. Apparently, he was a service member at one point but was discharged for one reason or another. He had done this sort of impersonation often after being removed from service. Clearly, he knows this is wrong. You can see it in his eyes. He's also dead. He died in 2014. Even after his death, he has been mocked and abused online. His family has requested that the sites exposing his ongoing lies remove the content, and most have refused, mocking them in the process. The comments section of his obituary was littered with vile abuse. I'm not posting this picture to further shame him or his family. I want you all to look right at it and see someone who is clearly struggling with some serious issues: mental health, substance abuse, whatever. Something simply isn't right. I want you to see someone with a family who loved him. It is important to expose those who seek to benefit from stolen valor, whether it be for attention or monetary gain. We must discourage and denounce this kind of behavior. But how far must we drag them? Is there a balance, here?"
