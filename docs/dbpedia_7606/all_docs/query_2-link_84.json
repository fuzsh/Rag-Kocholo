        "text": "25 Books That Need To Be Immediately Adapted Into A TV Show Or Movie (And Who Should Be Cast In Each)\n\n\"There was a point not far into the book where my brain stopped reading the text and it all flowed into cinematic mode — because the story would translate so perfectly to film.\"\n\nI recently asked the BuzzFeed Community which books they desperately want to be turned into a series or movie and the responses were filled with really great suggestions. Here is what some people said.\n\n1. \"Jackpot: High Times On The High Seas by Jason Ryan. This book is a fascinating true story of the so-called 'gentlemen smugglers.' Matthew McConaughey would be perfect to play Les Riley. Great book, great story!\"\n\n2. \"Sea of Rust by C. Robert Cargill and its prequel, Day Zero. There was a point not far into the book where my brain stopped reading the text and it all flowed into cinematic mode — because the story would translate perfectly to film. I've never experienced that before and now I need this to happen.\"\n\n—perenti\n\n3. \"Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman. I feel like a lot of lonely, introverted people like myself can relate to the quirky protagonist, Eleanor. As she comes to realize her way of living is unsustainable and even painful at times, she attempts to step out of her comfort zone in order to build relationships with others and regain her sense of self. The book deals with a certain sense of loneliness, isolation, social struggle, and maladaptive coping mechanisms written in such a way that is both hilarious and relatable. Movie, please!\"\n\n—Anonyomus\n\n4. \"After We Were Stolen by Brooke Beyfuss. Omg, I read it this summer and I am DYING to see this made into a movie. Playing the lead Avery, I see someone like Sadie Sink or Elle Fanning.\"\n\n5. \"Aristotle and Dante Discover Secrets of the Universe by Benjamin Alire Sáenz. A movie for it is in the works and I hope it really does the book justice.\"\n\n—gabby333\n\n6. \"The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller. This book perfectly described what it is like to grow up being a gay little boy before you even know what that means, like being magnetized by another boy you are totally enamored with but have no idea why and growing into that. It's such a good example of growing up gay and how it feels being compared and discriminated against and knowing why. I just totally loved this book and the visuals (taking place in Greece) would be so amazing to see on the screen.\"\n\n7. “The Nickel Boys by Colton Whitehead, a recent Pulitzer Prize winner, who I will suspect will be a Nobel laureate before his career is over. A great, harrowing book. It’s based on the historic Dozier school, a terribly abusive school that actually murdered many of its young charges for no good reason. There’s a great deal of difference between how most black and white students were treated — Black students were treated much worse.\"\n\n8. \"My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite. It is a short but hilarious and fantastic read about two Nigerian sisters who love each other but one of them has to live with the reality that their sister is a straight-up murderer, specifically of men. So if you’re on your 'men ain't shit' grind, this book is for you. Since it’s short it should just be a movie but I’d be interested to see the author expand the story for a limited series.\"\n\n—laidedahunsi\n\n9. \"Red Rising by Pierce Brown. It’s as thrilling as Game of Thrones with far more heart. Like, Hunger Games set in space with aerial battle tactics and old-school sword fights. There’s something for everyone.\"\n\n10. \"The Running Man by Richard Bachman (actually a pseudonym for Stephen King) but a more faithful adaptation than the '80s Schwarzenegger film. It's actually a well-written story about class inequalities in the future. When you consider it was written in the '80s, that future could very well be now.\"\n\n—jonsharky\n\n11. \"The Crossfire series by Sylvia Day. The first book, Bared to You, is one of my favorite romance novels. It has been optioned for a series multiple times but each time, the studio does nothing with the option. I'm still holding out hope for an adaptation.\"\n\n—lisalionheart12\n\n12. \"The Kushiel series by Jacqueline Carey. Epic fantasy with a well-developed world, with enough titillation to keep fans of the Bridgerton-like series happy. I think the mantra of 'love as thou wilt' is a message a lot of people need to hear these days.\"\n\n13. \"The Betsy-Tracy books by Maud Hart Lovelace. I don’t know if many people have heard about or read them, but I would love those books to be made into a series. It follows the author’s life growing up in the early 20th century in southern Minnesota, her travels abroad, and her wedding. They’re my comfort books, and I’ve read them probably 10 times. I’m actually reading them again now! Highly recommend it if you haven’t read them.\"\n\n—pandabear14\n\n14. \"The Off-Campus books by Elle Kennedy. For anyone who loves a hockey romance, this series is perfect. The storyline, characters, and tropes just complete my reading needs. Every fan cast I see of these books is amazing and makes me wish it was really a movie or show.\"\n\n—peynor\n\n15. \"Final Girls by Riley Sager should be a miniseries. I would love to see Jodie Comer nail the role of Quincy Carpenter. She would be so good at it.\"\n\n16. \"The Blue Is For Nightmares series by Laurie Faria Stolarz. I haven't read them in years but I remember it being so good that I would love to see it on screen.\"\n\n—beckichino\n\n17. \"The Uglies series by Scott Westerfield. It’s campy and cheesy, but I think it would make such a good series. It’s a little twisted, spans so many settings, and has characters with really complex motives and processes.\"\n\n—strangerthanitseems\n\n18. \"Lost Stars by Claudia Gray. It's a Star Wars story based on the time of the original movies. The characters and overall story are fantastic! Hoping for a Disney+ series.\"\n\n19. \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue by V. E. Schwab. I will die on this hill that these books deserve to be seen by more people no matter how popular they are on #booktok. \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" is a beautiful book with a great story that I think would translate great to the silver screen. And \"The Inheritance Games\" is such a fun story with so many different odd characters that just tug on your heartstrings as you see them go through their ups and downs.\"\n\n—kalenaherrera8\n\n20. \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A Heinlein. It's an older book, but I think we needed special effects to catch up anyway. I've always felt that, with the right script and director, would make an excellent film. Rufus Sewell as Manny, Paul Giamatti as Doc, and Hayley Atwell as Wyoming Knott would be reasonable casting. I might trust Denis Villeneuve to direct.\"\n\n21. \"I'll Give You the Sun by Jandy Nelson. This book is a moving story about a twin brother and sister, told from the boy's perspective in the first half and then from the sister's perspective in the second half. It's about love, family, discovering yourself, and overcoming grief and trauma. It's a beautiful vivid story with vibrant characters. I love the way it's told and I've never read a book quite like it.\"\n\n—Anonymous\n\n22. \"Beach Read by Emily Henry needs to be a movie! When I was reading it, I mentally cast Hannah Simone and Jake Johnson as January and Gus. I love New Girl and binge-watch it a lot so the cast gets stuck in my head when I read books.\"\n\n23. \"The Sunshine Vicram books by Darynda Jones. I would watch the hell out of a limited series of them. I'll also accept a longer series of her Charlie Davidson books.\"\n\n—lambnic18\n\n24. \"Verity by Colleen Hoover. My dream cast for it would be — Lowen played by Dakota Fanning, Jeremy played by Luke Evans or Ben Barnes, Verity played by Blake Lively, or Amanda Seyfried. And Corey played by Chase Crawford or Andrew Garfield.\"\n\n25. “I Remain in Darkness by Annie Ernaux. Originally written in French, Ernaux writes from the first-person perspective of her actual struggles watching her mothers decline due to Alzheimer’s disease. This is the only 'real' book I’ve found on the subject. It’s raw, emotional, and not made to 'please' the reader. I love that about Ernaux — she writes about life, just how it is.\"\n\n—Anonymous\n\nAre there any books that you wish would be turned into a limited series or movie?
