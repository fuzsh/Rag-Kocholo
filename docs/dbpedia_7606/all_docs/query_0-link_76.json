        "text": "Some contemporary and modern sources refer to the film’s title as Wintersoldier. The title of the film and the name of the Winter Soldier Investigation that it documents are based on the famous quote from The American Crisis, written by Thomas Paine and read to the soldiers at Valley Forge in the winter of 1776. The quotation is heard in voice-over narration by filmmaker Rhetta Barron over the film’s title: “These are the times that try men’s souls: The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it NOW, deserves the thanks and love of man and woman.” Only the title card appears in the opening credits. Although the opening title card includes a 1972 copyright statement for Winterfilm, Inc., the picture was not copyrighted until 18 Oct 2004, under the number RE-902-239.\n\nThe end credits feature only the names of the veterans who appear giving testimony, although during the film, few of the speakers are identified by name. The still photographs at the film’s conclusion are of veterans participating in the week-long, Apr 1971 Operation Dewey Canyon III demonstration at Washington, D.C., which culminated in the soldiers’ throwing away of their ribbons, medals and commendations. The end credits contain a written statement reporting that all the testimony from the Winter Soldier Investigation appears in the Congressional Record of 6 and 7 Apr 1971. The end credits also contain a written thanks to the filmmakers and friends whose participation made the film possible. Winter Soldier was shot in 16mm black-and-white, although the photographs of the soldiers in Vietnam, provided by themselves, are in color. Also in color are the 8mm “home movies” shot by the soldiers in Vietnam and the newsreel footage of civilians and military personnel.\n\nThe Vietnam War marked a bitter time in American history. U.S. involvement in the conflict began in 1950 with the sending of military advisors to aid France, which was attempting to retain control of Vietnam, its former colony. During the 1960s, the deployment of actual troops dramatically increased as the U.S. supported South Vietnam against the Communist government of the north. The war ended with the Fall of Saigon on 30 Apr 1975, and Vietnam was reunified as one country under the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in Jul 1976. Among the many contentious issues surrounding the U.S.'s involvement in Vietnam were the war-time draft, student protests, the treatment of prisoners of war and atrocities committed by the combatants.\n\nAs noted in the onscreen credits, the Winter Soldier Investigation, organized by the VVAW, was held 31 Jan—2 Feb 1971 at the Howard Johnson’s New Center Motor Lodge in Detroit, MI. The conference, offering testimony by more than one hundred veterans about atrocities they had witnessed and participated in, was an attempt to enlighten the public about what the VVAW called long-term “Official United States Military Policy,” according to the invitation sent out to veterans. Although the VVAW did maintain a policy of personal responsibility, leaders of the organization felt that individual soldiers, including Lt. William Calley, who had been convicted of pre-meditated murder after the 1968 massacre in the Vietnamese village of My Lai, were being scapegoated for crimes that were suggested and sanctioned by the soldiers’ military training, commanding officers and high-level military policy.\n\nThe VVAW hoped that having such a large group of veterans speak out would make it clear that no individual could be held culpable in isolation without taking into consideration the general policies of the government, and that the My Lai massacre was not an isolated incident sparked only by the brutality of specific soldiers. In addition to investigating carefully the legitimacy of the soldiers set to testify, the VVAW researched the possibility that they could be arrested for the war crimes they discussed, and it was determined that the veterans could not be charged or tried for crimes committed while they were on active duty. The veterans were instructed, however, not to give specific names other than their own.\n\nAfter testifying, the veterans, who were grouped together by unit in order to corroborate one another’s statements and unit policies, were questioned by members of the press and audience. The number of testifying veterans listed by contemporary and modern sources ranges from 109 to over 200, with most contemporary sources reporting 125. Over 700 veterans, as well as many civilians of various ages, were in attendance.\n\nDuring the conference, the U.S.’s secret incursions into Laos were publicly acknowledged by soldiers who had participated in them, as were the devastating health effects of Agent Orange upon the Vietnamese people. In addition to the veterans’ testimony, civilian doctors and experts spoke about the psychological and physical effects of the war. Although VVAW documents inviting veterans to the conference announced the intent to include statements from Vietnamese victims via a closed circuit television broadcast from Windsor, Canada, the Canadian government denied entry visas to the Vietnamese participants, according to the opening statements to the investigation given by William Crandall, a VVAW leader. At the end of the investigation, some of the veterans did travel to Windsor to sign a “peace treaty” with three Vietnamese representatives.\n\nAccording to the Var review of the film, “the hearings were aired via eight hours of tape on Pacifica [Radio] Foundation’s listener-sponsored stations.” Although numerous print and television journalists were present at the investigation, very little of it was written about or shown on television, and Winter Soldier remains the only audiovisual record of the event. An abridged transcript of the hearings was published in book form in 1972 as The Winter Soldier Investigation: An Inquiry into American War Crimes, and a 1971 book, The New Soldier, written by John Kerry and the VVAW, featured testimony from the hearings, as well as photographs from it and Dewey Canyon III.\n\nFunds to conduct the Winter Soldier Investigation were raised in part by celebrities such as Jane Fonda, Donald Sutherland, Joan Baez, Graham Nash, David Crosby and author-attorney Mark Lane, who held concerts, speaking engagements and benefits for the VVAW, according to contemporary sources and information included as added content on the 2006 DVD release of the film. In her autobiography, Fonda noted that she and Sutherland were the main civilian coordinators of the hearings in conjunction with the VVAW. Although the Winter Soldier Investigation became the target of much scrutiny and controversy, contemporary sources reported that the Pentagon and reporters attending the conference investigated the authenticity of the testifying men and their statements, and were unable to refute any of it. The VVAW continued to hold other Winter Soldier hearings throughout the 1970s.\n\nNone of the filmmakers involved is credited onscreen; the names of the crew members listed above were taken from the press materials for the 2005 theatrical re-release of the picture. The Var review of Winter Soldier’s 5 May 1972 Cannes Film Festival screening noted that the picture had been “made by a team of 18 filmmakers who have decided to remain anonymous.” In a 2004 interview with the filmmakers, included as added content on the picture’s DVD release, they related that they decided not to include any credits for themselves in order to keep the focus on the veterans.\n\nAlthough each of the collective members performed several functions on the film, including directing, producing and editing, Frederick Aranow and Robert Fiore served primarily as cinematographers; Nancy Baker, Lucy Massie Phenix and Rhetta Barron as editors; Barbara Kopple, Roger Phenix and Lee Osborne as sound recorders; and Michael Lesser as lighting director. The collective was organized after the Sep 1971 Operation Raw march on Valley Forge, organized by the VVAW, at which the intention to hold hearings was announced. Some of the collective members were present at the Pennsylvania demonstration and upon their return to New York City, contacted friends and colleagues to see if they wished to participate in documenting the conference.\n\nIn modern interviews, the filmmakers reported they had four separate film units shooting throughout the hearings, that they worked for no salaries and that their equipment and film stock were mostly donated. A May 1972 Var article estimated the picture’s final cost as “around $55,000.” According to an Aug 2005 NYT article, the filmmakers shot more than one hundred hours of film during the course of the three-day hearings and spent six months editing it. In modern interviews, the filmmakers recounted that the editing process took more than eight months, and that during that time, duties among themselves revolved, depending on family and work obligations, with five or six of them working on the post-production at any given time. Also, several of the veterans from the hearings participated in the editing.\n\nWinter Soldier first screened at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, 27 Jan—2 Feb 1972, as part of the New American Filmmakers Series. It played at the Cannes Film Festival during Critics’ Week on 5 May 1972 and then had a week-long, theatrical run in New York City beginning 8 May 1972. Although the picture played widely in Europe, according to modern sources, it received a very limited theatrical distribution in the United States during the early 1970s. According to the 10 May 1972 Var article, Donald Rugoff of Cinema 5, Ltd. was personally distributing the film in New York City, where it was being exhibited at his Cinema II theater. The article reported that Rugoff was relying on word-of-mouth to advertise the film, with the publicity being supervised by Mark Lenix, one of the testifying veterans. If the film did well, Rugoff announced, he would continue distributing it across the country, with the VVAW to receive fifty percent of the profits after fees and costs were recouped. No source to confirm Rugoff and Cinema 5’s nationwide distribution of the film has been found, however.\n\nWhen Winter Soldier played at The Los Angeles International Film Exposition (Filmex) in Los Angeles on 15 Nov 1972, the print was supplied by National Talent Service. According to the added content on the DVD release, Joan Baez, in addition to helping with the fundraising for the investigation, undertook the financing of the film’s initial distribution, but no contemporary sources confirming her involvement have been found.\n\nThe Var review noted that the film had been offered for television broadcast, but “all three commercial networks and public tv” had declined to air it. The May 1972 Var article added that the television stations rejected the film because of its subject matter and the “strong language” used by the veterans. According to the Var review and NYT’s television schedule, portions of the film were aired, along with a panel discussion, on WNYC’s All About Television series on 19 Feb 1972. The Var review added that the film was broadcast once on New York City’s public television station, WNET, in Feb 1972, after the WNYC airing; a 16 May 1972 NYT article indicated that the picture was shown on WNET’s series Dateline 13. According to modern interviews with the filmmakers, WNET was expecting a late-night, live news feed from President Richard Nixon’s historic, late Feb 1972 trip to China, but due to technical problems, the feed could not be shown, and so Winter Soldier was broadcast, unannounced, to fill the time gap. The unscheduled broadcast provided the film with its largest American audience.\n\nIn a modern interview, the Winterfilm Collective members recounted that the picture was never intended for theatrical release, but to be shown wherever possible. A 13 Feb 1972 NYT ad for a free screening, with a panel discussion, to be held at the First Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn illustrates the type of distribution the VVAW and Winterfilm Collective originally had in mind. The filmmakers also noted that, at the request of the VVAW, after the investigation, they quickly assembled a seventeen-minute documentary for use by the veterans to promote political action. The short was also shown to raise money to continue post-production on Winter Soldier. That short, comprised of the testimony given by the 1st Marine Division, was included on the DVD release of Winter Soldier, as was another, longer short focusing on the Americal Division, which was the same division in which Calley served.\n\nIn addition to the conference testimony, Winter Soldier features one-on-one interviews conducted by the press and the filmmakers with the veterans. Scott Camil is the primary focus of the individual interviews. His testimony at the hearings inspired singer-songwriter Graham Nash to write the song “Oh! Camil (The Winter Soldier),” which was included on his popular 1974 album Wild Tales. After his appearance at the Winter Soldier Investigations, Camil’s activism intensified and he became one of the most prominent anti-war protesters of the 1970s. He was part of the trial of the Gainesville 8, which concerned a student- and VVAW-led demonstration conducted in Florida, and after his acquittal, was shot and wounded by federal agents in a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sting. In 1994, Camil returned to Vietnam as the U.S. representative for the Vietnam Friendship Village Project. A documentary specifically about Camil, entitled Seasoned Soldier: A Winter Soldier Looks Back, was produced in 2002 and was included as added content on the DVD release of Winter Soldier.\n\nWinter Soldier marked the first, major feature-film work for several members of the Winterfilm Collective members, including Barbara Kopple, David Grubin, Nancy Baker and Lucy Massie Phenix. Kopple won Oscars for directing the documentaries Harlan County U.S.A. (1976) and American Dream (1990). Grubin went on to win several Emmys for his work on television documentaries, and Baker was the editor of the Oscar-winning, 2004 picture Born into Brothels. Phenix was an editor and co-writer of the Oscar-nominated, 1999 documentary Regret to Inform, about the widows of both American and Vietnamese soldiers. According to a modern interview with Phenix, Winter Soldier was “used in the research and the foundation for the narration” for Regret to Inform.\n\nThe Winter Soldier Investigation and the film Winter Soldier came under scrutiny again during the failed campaign of 2004 Democratic candidate John Kerry against incumbent president George W. Bush. Kerry, who appears very briefly in the film as a registrar, also served as a moderator at the investigation and was one of the organizers of Dewey Canyon III. On 22 Apr 1971, he appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, becoming the first Vietnam veteran to testify before Congress about the war, to present testimony from the Winter Soldier Investigation and propose scenarios for U.S. troop withdrawal.\n\nSeveral groups spoke out against Kerry during his campaign, claiming that his accusations and those of the other Winter Soldier veterans were false, and scenes from Winter Soldier were included in the 2004, anti-Kerry film Stolen Honor. Kenneth Campbell, one of the Vietnam veterans appearing in Winter Soldier, sued the producers of Stolen Honor for defamation, according to the Aug 2005 NYT article, but the outcome of the suit has not been determined. Documentary filmmaker George Butler used portions of Winter Soldier in his 2004, pro-Kerry documentary Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry in order to support the candidate.\n\nOn 10 Aug 2005, Village Voice reported that Dennis Doros and Amy Heller, the co-founders of Milestone Film and Video, had purchased the rights to Winter Soldier after another company, worried that the film would harm Kerry’s campaign, dropped it. Doros and Heller stated that in order to protect Milestone’s assets from any potential litigation by Kerry’s opponents, they formed a separate company, Millarium Zero, to distribute Winter Soldier both theatrically and on DVD. The 12 Aug 2005 re-release premiere in New York City was attended by many of the original filmmakers and veterans, as well as representatives of Iraq Veterans Against the War. Numerous 2005 reviews of the re-issued picture compared the Vietnam atrocities to similar reports concerning Abu Ghraib in Iraq in 2002-2004.\n\nLess\n\nOn 31 January 1971, more than one hundred American veterans of the Vietnam War meet at a Howard Johnson’s Motor Lodge in Detroit, MI, and over the course of three days, testify about their wartime experiences before an audience of their peers, civilians, members of the media and documentary filmmakers. As the men, representing numerous branches of the military, register for the gathering, which is called the Winter Soldier Investigation, they present documents verifying their service. They discuss their intended testimony with the registrars, who question them about specific atrocities they have witnessed and instruct them on how to testify clearly. One soldier, Rusty Sachs, a former helicopter pilot, tells his registrar that some men in his company would have contests to see how far they could throw bound Vietnamese prisoners out of helicopters. Another participant, Scott Camil, is recognized by Kenneth Campbell, with whom he served in the 1st Marine Division, and Campbell reminds him about a particular village that the company razed in a notorious incident that occurred before Campbell arrived “in country,” as the veterans refer to Vietnam. While they reminisce, Camil describes Operation Stone, during which 291 Vietnamese, including women and children, were killed. Steve Pitkin, questioned about why he wants to testify, offers that he “didn’t like being an animal and seeing everybody else turn into animals,” and expresses his belief that the biggest atrocity of the war is how deeply it has hurt a “whole generation” of Americans and Vietnamese. As a group of soldiers discuss attention from the media, Scott Shimabukuro asserts that if just one soldier was to comment on the atrocities committed by U.S. troops, “they’d hang him,” but with so many men giving testimony, they cannot be denied. At the hearing, Joseph Bangert describes how, on his first day in Vietnam, he was riding in a truck carrying other Marines, and the men, angry about being “given the finger” by a group of children, opened fire, killing at least five of the children. Bangert then details an incident in which a wounded woman captive was killed, after which her interrogator disemboweled her and peeled off her skin, leaving her mutilated corpse as a warning for other enemy combatants, called VC (Viet Cong) or NVA (National Vietnamese Army). Explaining further, Bangert relates that the “last lesson” Marines were given at Camp Pendleton before being shipped overseas was by a non-commissioned officer who killed, disemboweled and skinned a rabbit to demonstrate how to treat the enemy. When Camil testifies, he reports on “artillery games,” during which forward observers would pick out specific “hootches,” or huts, targeting them for mortar and artillery fire. Whoever was the most exact in his instructions, resulting in the most destruction with the least ammunition used, “won” the game, although no thought was given to inhabitants of the hootches. When the moderator asks Camil how soldiers distinguished between civilians and VC, Camil replies that anyone who had weapons was considered to be VC, and anyone who was killed was automatically counted as VC. During his testimony, Sachs notes that if there was someone senior in rank present at an incident, it was assumed that if what was happening was not “S.O.P.,” or standard operating procedure, the men would be ordered to stop, but because the order was never issued, committing atrocities became part of policy. Sachs also asserts that the only training the men received in Geneva Convention regulations was how to behave if they were captured, but their own treatment of prisoners was never addressed. Several men describe the vicious treatment of women, and Camil states that from the beginning of basic training through their tours of duty, soldiers were conditioned not to think of the Vietnamese as human beings. Later, as he is talking with other veterans, Camil is asked about the morality of his actions, and he admits that he used to believe that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki proved that the killing of civilians was acceptable if it was done for “the good of the nation.” Camil recounts the first time he killed a man, during an ambush on his post, and that afterward, as he looked at the bodies of his dead buddies, he realized that he could not make any mistakes or he also would be killed. He then decided that upon entering a village, regardless of the possible presence of innocents, if he had “to kill one hundred people just to make sure that there was no one there to shoot me,” then he would do so. Back at the hearings, Nathan Hale of Americal Division describes various methods of interrogation and torture, including the use of heated tin spoons, clubs, knives, gas grenades and white phosphorous, known as Willie Peter. Several men testify about the cutting off of ears, which served both to intimidate survivors and to prove how many people the soldiers had killed, and Camil describes how ears could be traded for beers. During their testimony, the men show slides of themselves and others in uniform, sometimes relaxing with their friends, sometimes committing acts of torture or posing with mutilated corpses. The mistreatment of wounded prisoners is discussed, as is inflation of the body count of dead combatants. Several soldiers attribute lying about body counts to intense competition between different companies, the desire of high-ranking officers to prove their efficiency, and the U.S. government’s need to rally public support for the war. Pitkin testifies about men maiming themselves to get relieved from duty, and that the sustained terror of combat has been difficult to overcome now that he is home and is expected to have a “purpose,” such as going to school or holding a job. William Hatton also recounts his difficulties in adjusting to civilian life and how it took him more than a year to be able to recall an incident in which he and his comrades stoned a young boy, probably to death. Hatton and others describe methods that were used to dehumanize civilians, such as throwing heavy cans of food at them from moving vehicles, randomly injuring children and raping women in front of their families. One night, after that day’s testimony, two African-American soldiers protest rampant racism in the military, not only against the Vietnamese but against any U.S. soldier of color. At the hearings, Thomas Heidtman, Allan Akers and Mark Lenix testify about the routine burning of villages, during which occupants had no time to gather their belongings, and if they attempted to flee, they were gunned down. James Henry, a Marine sergeant, then describes a massacre of nineteen women and children, and Native-American soldier Evan Haney compares the Vietnam War to the Indian wars in 19th century America. When he is questioned later, Camil admits that he has attended “sensitivity courses,” to redefine his conceptions of masculinity and moral behavior, but worries that he cannot change. Later, after the investigation, Lenix relaxes with his wife and child as he relates how difficult it has been to come to terms with his wartime experiences. Describing himself as an “average, middle-class American,” Lenix confesses that there was no justification for the wrongs he committed, and that others need to be informed before they make the same mistakes.\n\nLess"
