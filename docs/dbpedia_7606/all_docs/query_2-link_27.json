        "text": "SYDNEY (Gray News) – Detectives in Australia have charged a man after they said he stole more than $600,000 worth of unreleased “Bluey” coins.\n\nAccording to a news release from Fairfield City Police Area Command, officers received a report on July 12 that a large amount of currency had been stolen from a warehouse in the city of Wetherill Park, a suburb of Sydney.\n\nResponding officers were told that 63,000 unreleased limited edition $1 coins with Bluey on them had been stolen from the warehouse.\n\nThe coins were produced by the Australian Mint.\n\n“Extensive investigation” led officers to a nearby property on July 31, police said.\n\nDuring a search, detectives said they found unreleased limited edition “Bluey” coins as well as some stolen electronic devices.\n\nDetectives arrested a 47-year-old man on Wednesday. He was not identified by name.\n\nPolice said the man sold most of the coins online for 10 times their face value just hours after he stole them, totaling more than $600,000.\n\nThe man was denied bail and faced his first court appearance this week."
