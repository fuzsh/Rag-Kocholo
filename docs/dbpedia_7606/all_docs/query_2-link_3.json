        "text": "I witnessed the growing hatred toward our military during the early 1970s and eventually was on the receiving end of it when I joined the U.S. Marine Corps. Because I was so young in 1971 I did not witness the birth of this attitude toward our military as it unfolded in the news. This film documents this process and helps the viewer understand this painful but important part of our recent national history.\n\nThe film uses actual audio recordings of John Kerry's testimony before congress as well as current testimony of decorated former POWs who heard that very testimony played to them by their captors in North Vietnam. The former POWs and their families describe the impact that John Kerry, Jane Fonda and other protesters had on them and their families by painting our military as common criminals.\n\nAfter watching this film I better understand how things degenerated to what I experienced in the mid and late 1970s. As a U.S. Marine, I was called a \"baby burner\", spit upon and treated with contempt and hatred by nearly all civilians I came into contact with from one end of our country to the other.\n\nWhen I thought about it after watching the film, I realized that the title is appropriate. My honor was indeed stolen by the activities documented in this film.\n\nThe distinguished heroes in the film, including a Medal of Honor recipient, give an important perspective to the viewer. America must make a huge decision on November 2, 2004. This film will help make that decision an informed one. It will also help the viewer better appreciate the bravery and sacrifice of the former POWs and their families."
