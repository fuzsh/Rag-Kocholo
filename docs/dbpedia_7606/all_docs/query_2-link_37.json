        "text": "And Other Briefs\n\nCARRIE JONES AND SHAUN FARRAR\n\nAUG 08, 2024\n\nThe Bar Harbor Story is generously sponsored by Paradis Ace Hardware.\n\nEach week (sometimes twice), we compile briefs and public service announcements and share them in one large article.\n\nHIKERS’ NAMES RELEASED\n\nACADIA NATIONAL PARK—According to a Bangor Daily News article by Bill Trotter, the three people who hiked a closed trail in Acadia National Park are facing criminal charges. The park has released their names.\n\nLevi Brown, 22, of South Portland; Cooper Boucher, 20, of Saco; and Jillian McLellan, 19, of Saco, now face criminal charges after hiking the trail, which had been closed so that nesting falcons were protected.\n\n“Each will be charged with a federal violation of a superintendent’s closure, a misdemeanor that is punishable by up to six months in prison and a $5,000 fine,” Trotter wrote.\n\nCHANGES IN SOUTHWEST HARBOR\n\nThe Southwest Harbor Select Board released a statement thanking its current Town Manager Marilyn Lowell for her service to the town since 2013 and announced her retirement date as September 30. There will be an open house in her honor and so that people can wish her a happy retirement. That will be held on September 27 at the town office from 4 to 6 p.m.\n\nEllsworth Police Department has hired Franklin Burke, who had been an officer in Southwest Harbor for almost a decade and was a correctional officer at the Hancock County Jail prior to that. The Quietside Journal has a larger article about Burke’s tenure in Southwest and his departure.\n\nBar Harbor Parks and Recreation Committee\n\nBAR HARBOR—The Bar Harbor Park’s and Recreation Committee had a quick meeting that lasted just over a half hour on Monday, August 5.\n\nAfter a public comment period with no speakers, the committee elected its officers with for the next year, with no changes. John Kelly remains the committee chair, Greg Veilleux remains as vice chair, and Jeff Dobbs remains as secretary. All of these votes were unanimous. Member Erin Cough had initially been nominated to be the secretary but she declined the nomination. Member Ann Tikkanen was also in attendance.\n\nThe Vettes of Coastal Maine applied for a park use permit for their annual car show on the town’s ball field. The show is sponsored by the Wonder View Inn and will be May 31, 2025, from 8:00 a.m. until 12 p.m. The application was approved unanimously with little discussion.\n\nBruce Cates was at the meeting to represent the Vettes of Coastal Maine and said that this year’s event went very well and was well attended by both car owners from Maine, and elsewhere, and viewers.\n\nNext up for park use permit applications was Island Connections applying for a park use permit for Grant Park on October 5, 2024, for the Mary Parker’s Run/Walk/Wag 5K event. After some discussion between the committee and Island Connections Executive Director Carissa Tinker it was determined that Island Connections did not need a permit for what they were planning on doing in the park.\n\nTinker said that the route of the run has been altered a little and participants will be simply entering the park at the Albert Meadow Road entrance, running down the gravel walking path and then running down the shore path toward town. They will not have any tables set up and will have a few volunteers to guide participants and keep them on the correct route. Tinker also added that last year, unfortunately, there were only 30-40 participants in the event, so it may not be a lot of people.\n\nChair Kelly said that the runners will simply be running through the park and will be doing an activity that anybody can do without need for a permit so the committee decided that there was no need for a permit to be issued for this event. Kelly then suggested that perhaps the town should even refund the $50 application fee that Island Connections had already made. Secretary Dobbs made the motion to return the check with Vice Chair Veilleux seconding and the motion passed unanimously.\n\nPrevious to the committee appointments taking place, Veilleux had asked to place an additional item on the agenda so that they could speak about furniture being placed in the gazebo at the Village Green. Veilleux said that he has noticed that beyond the piano and folding chair that belong to the Congregational Church, people have started leaving other items of furniture and there is now a table and chair in the gazebo.\n\nKelly said that both the piano and the folding chair do belong to the church and that Pastor Rob Benson had received permission from the council to put them in the gazebo so that the public may utilize the piano. However, the other furniture had no permission to be there. Member Cough made a motion to direct Public Works Director Bethany Leavitt to remove all of the furniture in the gazebo with the exception of the piano and the folding chair. Veilleux seconded the motion and it passed unanimously.\n\nThe last order of business was a public works update by Leavitt. She said that the town is still moving forward with the plan to cut the marked trees in the tree line between the ball fields and Ledgelawn Avenue but they have been waiting for baseball to wind down and will probably do it in the fall when the ballfields are less busy.\n\nLeavitt said that the town has been meeting with the Bar Harbor Village Improvement Association and together they are determining representation for the Glen Mary pool project and moving forward with planning.\n\nThe Life Flight helipad plans for the new landing pad at the ball field are getting close to being done but certain aspects are still being finalized such as lighting for the pad, Leavitt said. Once the plans are finalized, they will be given to Life Flight so that they can start fundraising for the project. The area for the pad will probably be weighted with dirt in the fall so that the ground can be compressed and settled before construction begins.\n\nThe next meeting of the Parks and Recreation Committee is tentatively scheduled for August 19, 2024, but that is dependent on the need for a meeting.\n\nSunset Cruise to benefit the SPCA of Hancock County\n\nvia SPCA of Hancock County\n\nBAR HARBOR – Enjoy a two-hour sunset cruise while supporting the animals at the SPCA of Hancock County’s animal shelter.\n\nThe SPCA Critter Cruise will be held on Sunday, September 8, aboard Acadian Boat Tour’s 149-passenger vessel, the Acadia, and includes a Happy Hour hors d’oevres, raffles, and a cash bar, with all proceeds benefitting the animals. Tickets for the cruise are $60 each.\n\nThe cruise will depart at 5 p.m. sharp from the Atlantic Oceanside Hotel dock at 119 Eden St., Bar Harbor. Guests are encouraged to dress warmly and to arrive 20 to 30 minutes prior to departure to allow time to park and board the boat. Guests are required to check in at the ticket booth at 119 Eden St. to ensure the captain and crew have an accurate count of cruisers.\n\nThe Acadia will go along the shoreline of Bar Harbor and will include views of the summer mansions, Egg Rock Lighthouse, seals, harbor porpoise, and eagles. An Acadia Boat Tours experience naturalist will narrate the tour with history and anecdotes. The boat will stop in the bay during the last portion of the cruise to watch the sunset at 6:57 p.m.\n\nThe event will be postponed to Sunday, Sept. 15, at the captain’s discretion in the event of severe wind or fog. Pets are not allowed on the boat.\n\nThe event is made possible by Acadian Boat Tours and Atlantic Oceanside Hotel with support from Machias Savings Bank and Bar Harbor Bank and Trust.\n\n“This will be a really fun and beautiful event. It will be a rare opportunity to see the Bar Harbor area from the water, enjoy some great food and drink while supporting the SPCA,” said Michelle Allvin, SPCA board president. “Please join us for this incredible excursion.”\n\nTickets may be purchased online at spcahancockcounty.org/donations/critter-cruise-tickets/\n\nFor more information, contact Jamie O’Keefe at (207) 299-8732 or jamieokeefe67@gmail.com\n\n“What Makes a Memorable Story”\n\nConversation at the Causeway with ML Flynn, former NBC Nightly News producer, and Martin Fletcher, former NBC News foreign correspondent & Tel Aviv Bureau chief.\n\nvia Southwest Harbor Public Library\n\nSOUTHWEST HARBOR—On Tuesday, August 20th at 5:30 p.m. at the Causeway Club Red Barn, the Southwest Harbor Public Library will host a Conversation at the Causeway with Mary Laurence, “ML” Flynn, former Senior Foreign Producer of NBC Nightly News, and Martin Fletcher, former NBC News Foreign Correspondent and Tel Aviv Bureau Chief. In this conversational setting, their discussion will touch on the current Middle East crisis, the journey of a foreign correspondent, and what makes a memorable story. Limited seating. Registration required.\n\nMartin and ML first met in 1982, while covering the Israeli invasion to drive the Palestinian Liberation Organization out of Lebanon. They have teamed up for many stories over the decades, but perhaps teaching their acclaimed writing classes to the newest generation of NBC News correspondents and producers has been the most rewarding.\n\nML was the Senior Foreign Producer of NBC Nightly News for nearly twenty years. In that role she directed and managed the broadcast’s daily overseas and special event coverage including wars from Bosnia to Iraq, several Mideast Intifadas, coups in Russia and Haiti, genocide in Rwanda, environmental disasters, funerals for a princess, a saint and a pope, as well as producing marquee interviews with world leaders. From the Atlanta 1996 Games through London 2012, ML developed and managed the editorial story coverage for eight Olympics for NBC Nightly News.\n\nBefore she retired, ML was the Senior Producer of Editorial Strategy for NBC News and in that role, developed a range of projects from the network’s Opioid coverage, to a British Royal Wedding, and Town Halls on criminal justice reform, gun control and education, as well as, working on the 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate debates. ML has been honored with almost every award in TV journalism including a Peabody, several du Ponts, many Emmys, and much more.\n\nMartin Fletcher is known to many as the long-time NBC News Mideast bureau chief and correspondent, based in Israel. He has won almost every award in TV journalism, including five Emmys, three for his work in Israel and Gaza, and others for his work in Rwanda and Kosovo. He won the du Pont, known as the TV Pulitzer, for his work in the West Bank and Gaza, several Overseas Press Club awards and the Edward R. Murrow award for excellence several times. Anderson Cooper called Martin Fletcher “For decades the gold standard of TV war correspondents.” He was the only reporter to enter the American embassy in Tehran when Iranians held American diplomats hostage for 444 days.\n\nSince retiring Martin has worked as a Special Correspondent at NBC News and PBS Newshour, and devotes himself to writing books including his newest published in 2023 “Teachers: The Ones I Can’t Forget”. His second book “Walking Israel” won America’s National Jewish Book Award for non-fiction. His novel, “Promised Land”, was a finalist.\n\nRegister to attend at https://tinyurl.com/4fa8az3d.

His current project is a documentary-in-progress called “Birds of America: How Birds Save Us,” It is a feature film with an ambitious conservation agenda that seeks to fundamentally change the way that people look at – and engage with – the natural world in the face of climate change and habitat loss. He calls it a “film and conservation mission.”\n\n“I’ve seen the best of the planet’s wildlife from the Arctic to the Antarctic and everything in between…Increasingly my job comes with a down side and that is I get to see the collapse of our planet’s biodiversity in ever-deepening ways, and on every filming trip. It’s a real curse,” Aeberhard says. He wants his new film to make people aware and get them involved.\n\nBirds, and filming them, are a real passion for Aeberhard who thinks there are few scenes in wildlife films that are more uplifting than birds in flight. “They also give us a warning – where are we with the state of our planet?” He wants to use this film to build a powerful community of people agitating for change. “Change for the planet, for the birds, and for humanity. Because the deceptively simple question is this: Can we live on a planet without birds?” This project has the support of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, among many others.\n\nLearn more, meet the filmmaker and the film’s writer, Melanie Finn, and get a peek at some footage that has already been shot by attending this event at the Gilley. This will be an in-person event beginning at 7 p.m. and it will be simultaneously livecast. There is not fee, but in-person spots are limited and registration is required. Sign up at http://www.wendellgilleymuseum.org/calendar to reserve your seat. For in-person attendees there is a reception for Aeberhard and Finn that begins at 6pm. Please indicate when you sign up whether you will attend in person or online. There is no charge to attend.\n\nPeople-Nature-Art is a free monthly series that brings artists, writers, carvers, and creative types of all kinds to the Gilley to explore how nature and art interact in their work, and how their art impacts their own approach to nature. It is sponsored by our friends at Bar Harbor Bank & Trust.\n\nCRITERION GALA!\n\nvia Criterion Theatre\n\nBAR HARBOR—Join us for an unforgettable evening at The 1932 Criterion Theatre’s Annual Gala!\n\nDate: August 22, 2024\n\nTime: 5:00 PM\n\nLocation: The Bar Harbor Club\n\nIndulge in an open bar, delectable hors d’oeuvres, and experience the thrill of our silent and live auctions.

Registration is required for both options and can be accessed at coa.edu/coffeeandconversation.\n\nWhite’s newest book, Unaccompanied: Stories of Brave Teenagers Seeking Asylum, tells the true experiences of brave teens fleeing their home countries to seek asylum in the U.S. Utilizing extensive interviews, White helps us understand why some young people would literally risk their lives to seek safety in the U.S. Each one of them has been backed into a corner where emigration to the U.S. seems like their only hope.\n\nWhite’s first graphic novel, How I Made it to Eighteen: A Mostly True Story (Roaring Brook Press, 2010) was a Bank Street Book of the year, a Yalsa Great Graphic Novel, and a Texas Maverick Graphic Novel. Her webcomic TRACED was nominated twice for an Ignatz and was a TV series for Oxygen TV. When not making comics, she’s a mom, cat wrangler, and daily dark chocolate eater who enjoys nature walks even though she lives in a city.\n\nTaneja teaches an array of courses at COA dealing with postcoloniality, identity, belonging, borders, and culture. One of the popular ones, “The World of Ms. Marvel,” is a writing seminar focusing on the Marvel comic book series Ms. Marvel, with Pakistan-American teenager Kamala Khan as its superhero. Her research interests include postcolonial literature and theory and digital humanities, with a particular focus on South Asia. She earned her B.A. and M.A. from the University of Delhi and her Ph.D. in English Literature with a graduate certificate in digital scholarship and media studies from Emory University. In her leisure time, she enjoys reading webtoons and watching soccer with her tuxedo lapcat, Syaah.\n\nCoffee & Conversation is held every Tuesday morning in July and August on the COA campus, with options to participate virtually. Sessions are one hour long and include a Q&A. Coffee and pastries are served prior to each session.

From the peaks of Katahdin to the lakes of Mount Desert Island and the Casco Bay islands, Butterfield’s love of Maine shines from every page.\n\nBlue Butterfield is a woodblock printmaker who grew up in Bar Harbor and found her footing on the trails of Acadia. She has works in permanent collections around New England, including Maine Medical Center, Maine General, and the New England Cancer Center.

Through the first full-length biography in three generations, Fuller emerges as a humane and disciplined figure. Full of fresh details and surprising facts, Calm Command depicts a strong progressive streak in our third-longest-serving Chief Justice, with concern for death row inmates, victims of lynching, and citizens of Spanish-speaking territories like Puerto Rico, who despite his best efforts are still condemned to second-class citizenship. Melville Fuller helped create the U.S. Courts of Appeal, pioneered American involvement in international arbitration, and as an attorney won the case establishing a “public trust” for America’s waterfronts, beaches and harbors.\n\nThe dramatic events of his times, including strikes, the rise of industrial capitalism and imperialistic wars are given extended treatment. Retired Maine Chief Justice Daniel Wathen calls it “comprehensive and balanced,” while historian Paul Mills says “Rooks has given us a great book.”\n\nThis event is free and open to the public.
