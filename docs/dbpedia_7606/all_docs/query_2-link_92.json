        "text": "As an Indigenous child growing up in the '90s, I struggled to find Native American movies and representation in the media. Back then, the only character in a movie that I felt looked like me was Disney's Pocahontas — an animated film that completely changed and romanticized her real history. This lack of representation continued well into the ‘90s; apart from a few notable groundbreaking stories, such as Smoke Signals, Indigenous-led narratives in the film industry didn’t begin to gain more momentum until the 2000s.\n\nThankfully today, the list of Indigenous-made cinema continues to steadily rise each year. The expansion of this work is specifically recognized by Indigenous-centered film festivals, including the American Indian Film Festival and ImagineNATIVE.\n\nThroughout history, narratives in the media — in the movies and on TV — have told a romanticized tale of first contact between Indigenous Americans and colonizers during Thanksgiving or Columbus Day (a humorous example that calls this out is the Thanksgiving play scene in 1993's cult-classic Addams Family Values). These false narratives contribute to the perpetuation of the systematic oppression of Native Americans and Alaska Natives in the United States. The push for Indigenous narrative sovereignty is vital in the Indigenous fight for equity and social justice frameworks.\n\nIn honor of Native American Heritage Month, here is a guide to a few Indigenous-led films and shows that share a range of the values of resilience, sisterhood, language preservation, and climate justice amongst Indigenous communities, juxtaposed alongside ten films that focus on the United States' history of systemic violence, relocation, media erasure, forced sterilization, and boarding school brutality of Indigenous peoples.\n\nBelow, check out the 15 Native American movies and shows that will teach you about the real history and culture of Indigenous communities.\n\nReservation Dogs\n\nReservation Dogs is a comedy from co-creators and executive producers Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi and features a range of Indigenous screenplay guest writers. Launched by FX on Hulu in 2021, the show follows four Indigenous teenagers in a small community in Oklahoma following the death of their close friend. A coming-of-age story, the show explores the modern Indigenous youth experience. It is a breakthrough in Indigenous representation with its cast and crew and has been recognized and critically acclaimed in its run. Thus far, Reservation Dogs has won The Gotham Award for Breakthrough Series – Short Form, two Independent Spirit Awards, an AFI's Television Programs of the Year, and a Peabody Award.\n\nAccording to the show's Hulu landing page: “The show is also among seven programs recognized in 2022 by the Television Academy as part of its 15th Television Academy Honors, showcasing exceptional television programs and their producers who have leveraged the power of television to fuel social change.\" Recently picked up for a third season; you can stream it on Hulu.\n\nDark Winds\n\nDark Winds is a 2022 series created by Chickasaw producer and writer Graham Roland and directed by Chris Eyre. Based on the Leaphorn & Chee book series written by Tony Hillerman and set in the early 1970s, this series follows Navajo police officers stationed on a remote outpost of the Navajo Nation near Monument Valley. The show explores the difficulties that Tribal Police on reservations might face regarding Indigenous spiritual beliefs while undergoing an investigation of a double murder. You can watch Dark Winds on AMC+ or Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe Body Remembers When the World Broke Open (2019)\n\nThe Body Remembers When the World Broke Open is a 2019 film directed by Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers and Kathleen Hepburn. It tells the story of two Indigenous women from very different circumstances and explores the experience of domestic violence from their perspective. Part of the film's description reads as follows: “Taking its title from an essay by Indigenous poet Billy-Ray Belcourt, and based on a watershed moment in Tailfeathers' life, this story of a chance encounter between two women — living in the same Vancouver neighborhood, but coming from distinct worlds of class and lived experience — reveals the necessity for Indigenous people to look out for each other in a society that's too often indifferent to their existence.” You can find the film on Netflix.\n\nThe Stories for Climate Justice Collection (2021)\n\nThe Stories for Climate Justice Alaska Native Filmmakers collection was produced in 2021 during the inaugural Alaska Native Filmmaker's Intensive, made possible with a partnership between the nonprofit Native Movement and the University of Alaska Fairbanks Department of Theatre and Film. The all-Indigenous Alaskan-made films examine how Indigenous Alaskans respond to climate change's impacts on their families and communities. You can watch the collection on the Always Indigenous Media Youtube page.\n\nSG̲aawaay Ḵʹuuna/The Edge of the Knife (2018)\n\nSG̲aawaay Ḵʹuuna/The Edge of the Knife is a 2018 film co-directed by Gwaai Edenshaw and Helen Haig-Brown and is the first feature-length film made entirely in Xaat Kíl — the Haida language, an endangered language spoken by Indigenous people in Southeast Alaska and Haida Gwaii/British Columbia. Taking place in the 1800s, the story follows a man that lives in the Temperate Rainforest of Haida territory after the accidental death of a child and brings in a character of Haida stories: the Gaagiixid, the Wildman. SG̲aawaay Ḵʹuuna is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, and the Roku Channel.\n\nDawnland (2018)\n\nDawnland is a documentary that focuses on the systematic separation of Wabanaki children from their families by government agents, children that were then placed with white families during most of the 20th century. Many of these children suffered devastating emotional and physical trauma after being taken from their family and many of the people interviewed for the documentary share how they have lost a sense of their identity due to these experiences. A major part of the film is about Maine's government-sanctioned Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which gathered testimony from Wabanaki families who were affected by this practice. Directed by Adam Mazo and Ben Pender-Cudlip, you can rent Dawnland, here.\n\nThe Canary Effect (2006)\n\nThe Canary Effect is a documentary that explores a variety of topics, including various policies from the United States government that have negatively affected Native American people over the years. It touches on the economic marginalization these communities have faced, along with the media's refusal to report on various stories of death by suicide and Columbine-style school shootings that have occurred among Indigenous youth. Directed by Robin Davey and Yellow Thunder Woman, it premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2006. The Canary Effect is free to watch on Youtube, here.\n\nProject Chariot (2013)\n\nProject Chariot puts a spotlight on when the United States government wanted to experiment with nuclear testing in Alaska during the 1950s and '60s. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission planned to detonate thermonuclear bombs at a site near the Indigenous village town of Point Hope. People from Point Hope protested the plan and eventually stopped it from happening. While no detonation happened, it was later revealed that the site was radioactively contaminated by another secret experiment in which the government buried several thousand pounds of radioactive soil in the same area without telling nearby people. A 1996 report from The New York Times points out that the cancer rate in the area was much higher than the national average. Project Chariot is free to watch on Vimeo, here.\n\nThe Long Walk: Tears of the Navajo (2009)\n\nThe Long Walk: Tears of the Navajo is a documentary that tells the history of when the United States Army marched over eight thousand Navajo men, women, and children at gunpoint through three hundred miles of desert in the Southwest to a prison camp in eastern New Mexico. Hundreds of people died from starvation and exposure to the winter elements. You can order it or watch parts on YouTube.\n\nUnspoken: America’s Native American Boarding Schools (2016)\n\nUnspoken: America’s Native American Boarding Schools focuses on the history and brutality of American boarding schools that tried to \"kill the Indian\" in Native peoples, as put by U.S. cavalry captain Richard Henry Pratt. These institutions forced assimilation onto people who were unwillingly taken from their families; their hair was cut, they were made to wear military uniforms, along with being forced to learn and speak English. Many were punished physically and sexually abused at the boarding schools. The documentary is broken into two parts and can be viewed for free here.\n\nOur Spirits Don't Speak English (2008)\n\nOur Sisters in Spirit focuses on the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) epidemic, a crisis that hard largely gone uncovered by the media. There is systemic violence that has led to a disproportionate number of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, many cases which have never been solved. According to information from the FBI’s National Crime Information Center database, Native Americans and Alaska Natives represent only 0.8% of the U.S. population, but in 2017, they made up 1.8% of missing persons cases. The documentary is free to watch on YouTube.\n\nWe Shall Remain: The Trail of Tears\n\nWe Shall Remain: The Trail of Tears tells the story of the forced relocation by gunpoint of thousands of Choctaw, Creek, and Cherokee people between 1830 and 1840 due to provisions of the Indian Removal Act under President Andrew Jackson. Some of these people were forced to march more than 1,200 miles. As a result, thousands of people died due to cold, hunger, and disease. The Trail of Tears is the third in the five-part American Experience miniseries We Shall Remain by documentarian Ric Burns. It is available to rent on Apple TV.\n\nAmá (2018)\n\nA film to watch for: Amá is a forthcoming documentary about the involuntary sterilization of tens of thousands of Native American women across the United States over the 1960s and 1970s. Due to poor record-keeping, this number is estimated to be much higher. Directed by filmmaker Lorna Tucker, part of the synopsis of Amá reads as follows: “The film features the testimony of many Native Americans, including three remarkable women who tell their stories — Jean Whitehorse, Yvonne Swan and Charon Aseytoyer — as well as a revealing and rare interview with Dr. Reimart Ravenholt whose population control ideas were the framework for some of the government policies directed at Native American women.” The film is available to watch on OVID.tv."
