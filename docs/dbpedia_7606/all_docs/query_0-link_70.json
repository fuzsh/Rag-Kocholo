        "text": "A company that owns U.S. television stations plans to air a film highly critical of presidential challenger John Kerry.\n\nThe Sinclair Broadcast Group has ordered its 62 stations to air the program next week, less than two weeks before election day - November 2.\n\nThe film, entitled Stolen Honor, focuses on Mr. Kerry's 1971 testimony to Congress criticizing the Vietnam War.\n\nIt features former U.S. prisoners-of-war who say Mr. Kerry's comments about American atrocities led their Vietnamese captors to treat them more harshly.\n\nThe Kerry campaign has called the film a smear on Mr. Kerry's reputation.\n\nNews reports say The Sinclair Group has made large donations to President Bush's re-election campaign. The company made news in April when it ordered seven stations not to air another program that featured a roll call of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq."
