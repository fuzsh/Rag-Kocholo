        "text": "Dothan Mayor Mark Saliba, President of the Alabama League of Municipalities, (ALM), will welcome the 124th National Black Business Conference, (NBBC), and The World Conference of Mayors, (WCM) 40th Anniversary Breakfast Meeting, on Aug. 21, at the Municipal Complex in Tuskegee.\n\nMayor Saliba, the son of the late Mayor Alfred Saliba of Dothan, is a former 1993 “Builder of the Year” in Alabama. He has carried on the family business in Dothan successfully, and is considered one of Alabama’s most outstanding builders and real estate developers.\n\n“As president of the Alabama League of Municipalities, it gives me a lot of opportunities to be out there in the state,” said Mayor Saliba. “It’s an honor to be in Tuskegee, to celebrate with the World Conference of Mayors and the National Black Business League. Tuskegee has a tie to Dothan with Dr. Carver and the peanut project. So there’s a lot of connections there that I’m proud of.”\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBy coming to welcome the breakfast, along with Alabama League Executive Director Greg Cochran, he will be joining two other former presidents of the Alabama League: Tuskegee Mayor, Lawrence “Tony” Haygood, now President of The Alabama Conference of Black Mayors, (ACBM), and former Tuskegee Mayor, now Councilman, Johnny Ford, along with other Mayors, and officials from the State, and from Alabama cities and towns.\n\n“I am happy to join Mayor Haygood in welcoming Mayor Saliba to this business conference, because he is a successful businessman, and he knows the importance of business and government working together,” said Ford.\n\nFord said it was great working with Saliba’s father Alfred when he was mayor in 1989, and now to have the opportunity to work with his son, Mayor Saliba in 2024, as president of the Alabama League, representing 450-plus cities across Alabama.\n\nThe kick off breakfast for the event will be followed by a tour of historic Tuskegee sites, which will include the Tuskegee History Center, developed by longtime Civil Rights leader Fred Gray, and Tuskegee University, now led by Dr. Mark Brown as its 10th President. One of the highlights of the tour will be the laying of a wreath at the tomb of Dr. Booker T.
