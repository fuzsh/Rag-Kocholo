        "text": "Critical Conversations\n\nFriday, October 15, 2021\n\nModerated by Linh Huynh\n\nIn honor of Latinx Heritage Month, join for a special movie discussion about the documentary Stolen Education.\n\nStolen Education documents the untold story of Mexican American school children who challenged discrimination in Texas schools in the 1950s and changed the face of education in the Southwest. The film documents not only a significant moment in Mexican American history, but also provides important context to understand our current educational system’s enduring legacy of segregation, discrimination, and racism.\n\nWatch the movie on Vimeo before the movie discussion and come ready to share your thoughts.\n\nWatch the Trailer\n\nThis event is hosted in partnership with Gladstone’s community group, Elevated Voices.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nAt Gladstone, we are committed to providing events and professional development activities that resonate with our community’s diverse members. Our goal is to develop creative programming that encompasses a wide variety of ideas and perspectives to inspire, educate, and engage with everyone within our walls.\n\nWe want to effect positive change through our events and activities by providing a platform for discussions on important topics related to increasing diversity and inclusiveness in the sciences."
