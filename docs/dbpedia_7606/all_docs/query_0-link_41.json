The Countess Collona of Italy hopes to win Robert for herself, and to this end, she plots with Signor Conte to frame Virginia for the robbery of a valuable Italian painting that the Italian government has allowed Virginia to copy. In the meantime, Virginia's friend Betty marries Belfield, but government concerns demand so much of his time that the young wife is frequently left alone. When Betty runs away with Paul Hollister, Virginia pursues the two and convinces Betty to return home. On the same night, Conte steals the painting, replacing it with Virginia's copy. Because her alibi would implicate Betty, Virginia accepts the blame in silence, but later, she traps Conte and the countess into revealing their guilt.
