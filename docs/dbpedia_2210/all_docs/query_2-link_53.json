        "text": "PAUL Lawrie's kids are into golf. Craig, 12, and Michael, eight, intended following the Scot as he began the British Open here yesterday. But their focus would not have been solely on their father.\n\nLawrie was partnered with Tiger Woods, the world No. 1 and winner of the past two Opens, for the first two rounds. \"I would imagine every little boy wants to be Tiger Woods, and mine are no different,\" said Lawrie.\n\nIt's been a bit like that for most of Lawrie's long professional career. This time eight years ago, he bobbed up and surprised everyone by winning the 1999 Open in a play-off, making two birdies to defeat Jean van de Velde of France and American Justin Leonard. Then just as quickly, he slipped back into anonymity.\n\nHe has won only two tournaments since in Europe, and is 113th on the money list this year.\n\nHe's still a decent trivia question, for most people remember the 1999 Open first for Van de Velde's amazing collapse at the final hole of regulation play, and second for the brutal set-up of the course that tortured most of the players.\n\nVan de Velde needed only a double-bogey six at the difficult final hole to win; he took a seven, forcing the three-way play-off.\n\nBut here's another trivia question worth throwing up: what did Lawrie shoot on that final day at Carnoustie? Answer: a 67, surely one of the great rounds of golf by anyone, carved out of a course that was canned by virtually every player who competed on it.\n\nWoods is one who believes Lawrie never received due recognition for his own performance that day in 1999. \"No, he never did. I think everyone probably looked at the fact that Jean lost the tournament,\" said Woods this week.\n\n\"Just like I said, Paul was the champion and he ended up having his name on the claret jug, but people remember Jean for what he did, rather than Paul coming from 10 down and winning a play-off.\"\n\nLawrie and Van de Velde are acquainted, since they are both European tour veterans, but have never talked about what happened. \"We're not go-out-for-dinner friends,\" said Lawrie. \"We say 'hello' and when we play together, we always have good fun. I've never been to dinner with him, so that conversation has never taken place, and I wouldn't imagine it ever would.\"\n\nThe 38-year-old Scot, who hails from Aberdeen, has made no secret of the fact he believes his own performance was underplayed by the media. \"When you have a six to win down 18, you would fancy your chances,\" he said.\n\n\"Golf has a funny way of getting the ball in the hole and playing 72 holes, not 71, is very much a part of what we do. And I would have liked to have seen a little bit more of 'Jean van de Velde blew the Open, but my God, Paul Lawrie shot 67 to win the tournament by two shots by hitting the best shot anyone has ever seen down the last hole', but that didn't happen very often.\n\n\"I didn't read a lot about how well I did the last day. But that's not my job.\"\n\nLawrie is the last European to win the Open; indeed the last from his continent to win any major. Nick Faldo, a multiple major champion, recently opined that the European players were a little too friendly with each other around the circuit, bringing Ryder Cup success but not so much good fortune for individuals in majors.\n\nIt is an interesting theory that Colin Montgomerie expanded on. \"That's why we do well in the Ryder Cup, because we're familiar with each other,\" he said.\n\nLawrie is hoping that a breaking of the drought will lead to a flood. \"I don't like being the last European,\" he said. \"I'm a European. I want to win majors. If I'm not winning them, I want one of my guys winning them.\n\n\"I'm sure if one of them win, maybe a few of them might win. Maybe that's the hurdle some of the team need to get over. We have so many on this tour who can win majors.\"\n\nSELECTED HIT-OFF TIMES\n\nRichard Green\n\nErnie Els4.25"
