        "text": "Paul Lawrie's improbable victory sets off celebration in homeland.\n\nThe bleachers rocked with delight, fans soaked with rain and drink singing and screaming in the mist. The clock on the Carnoustie Hotel neared 9 p.m., but at any moment, you thought a soccer game might break out.\n\nOne of their own had just won the Open Championship, a native-born Scotsman claiming the British Open for the first time since 1931, and the celebration raged on.\n\nPaul Lawrie would have joined them, if it were not for all the other duties he had to perform. One was trying to reach his wife, who was at home in nearby Aberdeen, less than an hour's drive away, taking care of their two sons.\n\n\"I'm a local boy,\" he told the crowd afterward. \"Thanks a lot. It is a huge thing to win the Open anywhere, but when you live just up the road it's like a fairy story. Every youngster dreams of winning the Open, but to win so near your home is so special.\"\n\nLost in the chaotic ending was Lawrie's superb final round, 4-under-par 67, that was the best of the day. It included a birdie at the par-4 17th and a par save from a bunker at the 18th, giving him the chance to catch France's Jean Van de Velde, who triple-bogeyed the final hole.\n\nLawrie came from nowhere to win the year's third major championship, having been ranked 159th in the world and bringing back memories of John Daly, who was an alternate before winning the 1991 PGA Championship. Lawrie didn't even realize he would be in the field a week before the tournament, first having to endure 36-hole qualifying.\n\nNow he's set for life, sure to reap the benefits of being an Open champion. He has earned spots in the Masters, U.S. Open and PGA Championship _ events in which he has never played _ for the next five years, as well as moving to second on the European Ryder Cup standings, assuring himself a spot on this year's team.\n\n\"There's no way I'm going to sit back just because I've managed to win the Open title,\" he said. \"This is just the start _ and I want more than one British Open. It's in my own hands now. I'm going to work even harder so that I can go on to win more tournaments.\"\n\nSo who is this man who before Sunday had just two PGA European Tour titles and had never competed in a major championship other than the British Open?\n\nLawrie, 30, the son of an Aberdeen taxi cab driver, learned golf on the seaside links of Cruden Bay. He enjoys playing in the wind and had finished sixth at the 1993 Open won by Greg Norman. He even had captured a title at Carnoustie, a pro-am in 1991. He turned pro at 17.\n\nFor four years, he was the assistant pro to the late Doug Smart at Banchory Golf Club, before getting support from some local businessmen and trying to play tour golf.\n\n\"I don't know what it was that he spotted in me, but I seemed to get preferential treatment,\" Lawrie said. \"While the other assistant stayed in the shop and sold tees, I was given time to go and practice and play in assistants' events. He was always trying to get me into tournaments and pro-ams so that I could gain experience. I'd like to think that he's looking down on me now with pleasure.\"\n\n\"I always knew he could do it,\" said George Mitchell, one of Lawrie's original sponsors. \"We are absolutely delighted. The response to him winning was just unbelievable and everyone was glued to the TV as soon as we realized he was in with a real chance. We always said anything could happen at Carnoustie. Well, it has.\"\n\nIt took the biggest comeback in major championship history for it to occur. Lawrie was 10 behind Van de Velde when the final round began, with the final three strokes not made up until the Frenchman's adventure at the last. The previous record was held by Jack Burke Jr., who overcame eight shots on Ken Venturi at the 1956 Masters.\n\nLawrie also became the first qualifier to win the Open since exemptions were started in 1963. Before that, even Ben Hogan and Arnold Palmer had to survive the qualifying round.\n\nHe also is the second player _ Daly being the other, and he did it twice _ to win a major from outside the top 100 since the World Ranking began in 1986. Lawrie jumped from 159th to 48th with his victory.\n\nBut Lawrie's reputation was one of an underachiever. \"People say that about me,\" said Lawrie, who considered quitting the tour in 1995. \"I practice hard, I practice my chipping and my short game a lot. Sometimes I don't get as much out of my game as I should, but I don't really know why that is. But I don't think I'm an underachiever. I think my career is just starting.\"\n\nLawrie described his final round as the best he had ever played. Only one other score all week was as low.\n\n\"I felt in the mood, as if I was going to have a good day. I felt relaxed and kind of thought I was going to have a low one.\"\n\nAfter bogeying the first two playoff holes, Lawrie birdied the final two, winning the playoff by three shots.\n\n\"When I birdied the 17th, that was the moment I thought I could win,\" he said. \"I couldn't see myself bogeying the last. I had practiced too hard for that moment. I can't explain it, but I had a feeling at the start of the week that someone could come through who wasn't supposed to. With the knee-high rough and some of the big names complaining about it, which they are entitled to do, I felt if I kept quiet and did my own thing, I could come through.\"\n\nLawrie was considered a 150-1 long shot to win the Open, which didn't stop many people who know him from placing a wager. One poor guy, however, could manage only 16-1 odds on Lawrie.\n\n\"He must be gutted,\" the new Open champion said.\n\nMajor final-round comebacks\n\nPLAYER SHOTS TOURNAMENT\n\nPaul Lawrie 10 1999 British Open\n\nJack Burke Jr. 8 1956 Masters\n\nGary Player 7 1978 Masters\n\nArnold Palmer 7 1960 U.S. Open\n\nJohn Mahaffey 7 1978 PGA\n\nNick Faldo 6 1996 Masters\n\nLanny Wadkins 6 1977 PGA\n\nJohnny Miller 6 1973 U.S. Open\n\nFOR JUMP:"
