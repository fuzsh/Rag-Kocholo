        "text": "With four events in the professional Challenge Tour now under his belt Craig Howie from Peebles Golf Club has already found his way into the prize money. In his second event Craig carded a very respectable two under par which earned him a tied 35th place finish and his first prize money for the 2019 season.\n\nCraig is delighted to announce that Cullen Kilshaw, the largest solicitor estate agency firm in the Scottish Borders, have signed up to be his main sponsor for the next two years. Craig has also recently signed with former Open Champion Paul Lawrie’s 5Star Sports Agency, meaning that along with sponsors Stobo Castle and Cullen Kilshaw Craig is well on his way to securing the financial backing required for this season. With funding for travel and logistics in place Craig is focussing on his events and performance to hopefully secure that first win on this year’s European Challenge Tour.\n\n“I am really pleased to have the support of Cullen Kilshaw for the next two years and I feel proud to be a part of their team. Cullen Kilshaw have been a large supporter of Peebles Golf Club for a number of years now and I am delighted they have extended that support further as I try to climb up the professional ladder.”\n\nCullen Kilshaw, now run by founding partner David Kilshaw and his son Ross Kilshaw, have signed up to be Craig’s main sponsor for the next two years. Both David and Ross are golfers from Peebles who have watched as Craig has come up through the excellent youth development system at Peebles Golf Club before moving on to an exceptional spell in the amateur ranks, representing his country at various levels and then winning the Pro Golf Tour last year at his first attempt.\n\nDavid Kilshaw comments “When we all sat down recently to have a chat about how Cullen Kilshaw might support Craig in the coming season, Ross and I were hugely impressed with Craig’s professionalism and quiet determination. His pursuit of excellence and his aspiration to get the best out of himself are very much a reflection of our own attitude to our business, and we were delighted to be able to support Craig in this very exciting venture”.\n\nWith offices in seven of the main Borders towns Cullen Kilshaw is the largest solicitor estate agency in the region. Cullen Kilshaw provide sponsorship in all of the towns in which they operate, including sponsoring the flagship Thorburn Cup tournament at Peebles Golf Club for a number of years. David Kilshaw adds “Almost all of our clients and our staff are from the Borders, and we are pleased to be in a position to support a number of Borders clubs and sports teams with which we have had an association going back over many years. If we can play our small part in helping Craig to achieve his dream of establishing himself as a Borders based professional golfer competing against the best in the world, that would be a splendid achievement. We wish Craig all the best on the Challenge Tour, and we have every confidence that he will do us all proud.”\n\nCullen Kilshaw 1 Rowan Court, Cavalry Park, Peebles, EH45 9BU\n\nT. 01721 723999"
