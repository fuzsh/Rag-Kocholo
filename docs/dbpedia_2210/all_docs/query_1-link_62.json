        "text": "Former Open champion Paul Lawrie has teamed up with the Loch Lomond Group for a creative partnership that includes the release of a signature Scotch whisky.\n\nPaul Lawrie has joined Loch Lomond Whiskies as an ambassador for the brand\n\nThe Scotch whisky brand, which is the official spirit of The Open tournament, has partnered with Lawrie, who joins fellow golfing star Colin Montgomerie as an ambassador for the brand.\n\nLawrie has been working with the master blender at Loch Lomond Whiskies to create the Paul Lawrie Autograph Edition, which will go on sale in the lead up to the 147th Open tournament at Carnoustie in July.\n\nLawrie said: “I’m genuinely thrilled to begin working with the experts at The Loch Lomond Group, who share my passion for arguably two of the country’s most loved exports – golf and whisky – and I’m impressed with how they’ve established themselves in the sport in such a brief period.\n\n“In the short term I’m looking forward to developing my Autograph Edition before returning to Carnoustie – a course which is obviously very close to my heart.”\n\nColin Matthews, CEO of Loch Lomond Group, said: “To be able to bring a player of Paul’s calibre and reputation on board really demonstrates the commitment we have to both growing our brands around the world and growing our presence in golf.”\n\nAs part of the pair’s partnership agreement, Loch Lomond Whiskies will also participate at the Scottish Par 3 Championship, which takes place at the Paul Lawrie Golf Centre, where players will have the chance to win a cask of Loch Lomond whisky."
