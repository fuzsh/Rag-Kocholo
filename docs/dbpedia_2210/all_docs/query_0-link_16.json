        "text": "International Sports Management (ISM) has become the representative of golfer Paul Lawrie.\n\nThe 48-year old Scotsman joins the management company with immediate effect. Furthermore, Lawrie’s son Craig, who plays on the second-tier EuroPro Tour, has also agreed terms with ISM.\n\nFounded in 1989 by retired European Tour golfer Andrew ‘Chubby’ Chandler, ISM represents some of the tour’s leading names, including reigning Masters champion Danny Willett and former world number one Lee Westwood.\n\n“I’ve known Chubby Chandler ever since I’ve been out on tour and it will be great to be working with him and the guys at ISM,” said Lawrie. “I’m coming into an interesting phase in my career. I’m convinced I’ve got a lot of good golf ahead of me and I’m looking forward to some exciting times with Chubby and ISM.”\n\nTurkish Airlines extends sponsorship of European Tour event\n\nChandler added: “Paul has been a significant figure on the European Tour for a long time and showed only last week in South Africa what he is still capable of [when he won the Dimension Data Pro-Am]. He has done so much in and for golf, he’s a great guy and we’re proud to be working with him.”\n\nLawrie won the 1999 Open Championship in a playoff over Justin Leonard and Jean van de Velde, whose infamous triple-bogey at the last hole triggered the four-hole shootout. Lawrie has also won eight European Tour titles and represented Europe in two Ryder Cups.\n\nInternational Sports Management (ISM) has become the representative of golfer Paul Lawrie.\n\nThe 48-year old Scotsman joins the management company with immediate effect.
