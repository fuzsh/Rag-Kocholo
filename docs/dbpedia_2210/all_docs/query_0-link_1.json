        "text": "When the name Paul Lawrie is mentioned on GolfWRX, it is usually on a forum thread where the question of the worst major winner of all time is posed. Recognition of sorts, but recognition, which is beginning to slip away at least in minds of many who have replaced Lawrie’s name with that of Danny Willett.\n\nThat Lawrie is treated in that way is as disappointing as it is wrong. The Home of Golf has not produced many major winners in the last 100 years. Sandy Lyle aside, Paul Lawrie is it. So how can it be that the winner of The Open, eight European Tour events, and a two-time Ryder Cup player has been relegated to such to an afterthought amongst golf fans, commentators, and tournament organizers. In spite of his efforts to get invited, he is now being regularly ignored by Champions Tour events and he faces a yearly ghosting the PNC Father-Son Challenge that he so dearly wishes to play in with one of his sons.\n\nThat things have seem to be going this way for Lawrie has perhaps been inevitable. A “lucky” major winner who only happened to shoot a 67 on the final day, around the most difficult Open course in recent memory before then birding the toughest two holes on the toughest closing stretch of the toughest test in golf. The most recent high point in his career is inarguably his qualifying for the Ryder Cup in 2012. 13 years after making his debut and a number of years after seemingly having slipped into obscurity he was back on golf’s grandest stage. His play that week was solid before a spectacular Sunday saw him beat Brandt Snedeker in singles.\n\nSince that time, age and injuries have caught up with him with a particularly problematic foot condition preventing him from playing much at all during 2018. He is now 50 and into the senior ranks. Thus far, he has not caught the attention of the Champions Tour with his first start looking likely to be April at the Insperity Invitational.\n\nCan you imagine one-time major winners such as Stewart Cink, Lucas Glover, or Mike Weir being similarly ignored when their time comes to compete with the over 50s? If it was starts on the Champions Tour that Lawrie is looking for, it seems that he would have been better off playing professional baseball like John Smoltz, as opposed to winning the games oldest major.\n\nOver and above his own professional achievements, the stellar work of his Paul Lawrie Foundation in attracting juniors to golf and encouraging them into its competitive arena should be recognised. Founded in 2001, the Foundation has grown steadily over the years and provided support, mentoring and places to play for juniors all over the north and north east of Scotland. To date, the Foundation has been a huge success with David Law, a player long under the wing of Lawrie now making it on to and winning on the European Tour and recently turned professional Sam Locke who won the silver medal at Carnoustie perhaps the most famous graduate.\n\nThe successes of Law and Locke and the motivation that provides for those coming behind them is as a direct result of Lawrie’s vision in creating the foundation. The foundation itself indicates that it would be great if players who have come through its ranks end up winning on Tour or even a major but before all of that, the goal is simple — get clubs into the hands of youngsters and get them playing.\n\nThus far, Lawrie has been able to achieve that with great success, embarrassing the efforts of organizations such as the R&A and Scottish Golf Union. A major winner who genuinely has had a massive impact on getting people to play the game — surely that is something worth recognizing and remembering!\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE205\n\nLEGIT10\n\nWOW6\n\nLOL1\n\nIDHT0\n\nFLOP1\n\nOB2\n\nSHANK4\n\nIn 2016, at the Olympic Games in Rio, Golf’s reintroduction as an Olympic sport stood as a landmark moment in the game’s storied history, marking its evolving recognition and global importance. That development was not only significant in terms of the prestige it brings, but it crucially validates golf’s status as a sport that resonates across different cultures and geographies.\n\nBeing part of the Olympics magnifies golf’s global appeal. While the sport has long-standing traditions in countries like the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan, the Olympic Games expose it to a broader, more diverse audience. Countries where golf is not typically popular are more likely to take notice when their athletes compete on this grand stage. This visibility can spark interest and investment in the sport in regions previously untapped by golf’s reach.\n\nThe Olympic stage provides an unparalleled level of attention and viewership. Billions tune in to watch the Olympics, meaning millions who may have never watched a golf tournament are introduced to the sport. This exposure is invaluable for attracting new players, particularly young ones. For a sport often perceived as elitist or inaccessible, showcasing golf in the democratic, unifying context of the Olympics helps alter these stereotypes.\n\nThe Olympic spotlight helps emphasize the sheer athletic prowess required in golf. It highlights the focus, precision, and mental endurance necessary to excel, aligning golf with other sports celebrated for their physical demands. Golfers can now be recognized not just as skilled athletes within their own circles but as part of a broader community of world-class competitors.\n\nGolf’s Olympic inclusion also presents opportunities for countries to invest in developing their athletes. With the incentive of Olympic glory, nations are more likely to fund training programs, build facilities, and support golf associations dedicated to nurturing young talent. This, in turn, leads to higher competitive standards and a richer diversity of playing styles and personalities in the sport.\n\nThe return of golf to the Olympics—starting in 2016 after a 112-year hiatus—also provided seasoned professionals and emerging talents the opportunity to compete in a team dynamic distinct from traditional tournaments. Playing for one’s country adds a layer of passion and a sense of duty, often resulting in compelling performances that resonate deeply with fans.\n\nGolf’s inclusion in the Olympics bolsters its global presence, attracts diverse new audiences, and provides a platform to showcase the athletic demands of the sport. It injects fresh enthusiasm into the golfing world, inspiring nations to nurture their golfing talent, thus enriching the game’s global tapestry. This milestone symbolizes much more than a place in the competitions; it represents an expansive future for golf as a universally celebrated sport.\n\nAs John Bodenhamer, the USGA’s Chief Championships Officer and Board Chair for USA Golf, told me in an interview I conducted for RG.org,\n\n“Golf as part of the Olympic Games has and should continue to grow and inspire the game, especially as governments provide funding for the sport in their country to encourage medal-winning.\n\n“For golf to maintain its success on the Olympic stage, it is crucial to ensure that the best players participate, fans attend the on-site competition, and viewers across various media platforms tune in. These metrics are key to sustaining the sport’s relevance and appeal in the Olympic context.”\n\nWatching the golf competition at the Paris Olympics is a must if you are a fan of sports and competitions at the highest level. Whether it’s a replay of the Men’s competition or tuning in live this week for the Women, Olympic Golf promises thrilling action with top golfers from around the globe showcasing their skills on a world-class course. The strategic challenges and picturesque landscapes of Paris’s Le Golf National Golf Course offer an extra layer of excitement.\n\nWith the Olympics’ spirit of unity and excellence, the golf competition offers a unique opportunity to witness historical moments and intense yet friendly rivalries take place at an incredible venue. Whether you’re a seasoned golf fan or new to the sport, golf at the Paris Olympics is an unforgettable experience that combines athletic prowess, global representation, and a cultural celebration—all in the spirit of this ancient game we call golf.\n\nYour Reaction?\n\nLIKE2\n\nLEGIT2\n\nWOW0\n\nLOL1\n\nIDHT1\n\nFLOP2\n\nOB2\n\nSHANK2\n\nAnother Open Championship has come and gone and links golf was once again in the spotlight at Royal Troon! For those who have never played a links course (like myself), it sparks a desire to fly across the pond to experience it for ourselves. While a golf trip to the UK or Ireland is a bucket-list item, most people look to play the big-name courses (Old Course, Carnoustie, Lahinch, Royal Portrush,etc.), but don’t realize they can get a similar experience by traveling to some of the lesser known destinations where you will find some of the purest links courses in the world. With this in mind, here are our picks for the best hidden gem links courses you should play when you book a UK or Ireland trip:\n\nIRELAND\n\nBallyliffin\n\nWe start our list off with a 36-hole club in the Northwest of Ireland, a remote area of the Emerald Isle that is known for its rugged terrain and spectacular scenery. Bordering the Wild Atlantic Way, Ballyliffin is relatively newer (est. 1947) but offers golfers one of the purest links golf experiences anywhere in the country. While not easy to get to, the two courses onsite (Old and Glashedy) are well worth the travel with large dunes shaping the fairways that overlook the North Atlantic Ocean and a myriad of pot bunkers everywhere you look. Even Rory McIlroy believes that “Ballyliffin’s two courses are a must play on any golf trip to Ireland.” and we tend to agree.\n\nHow to incorporate Ballyliffin in a golf trip:\n\nStay:Ballyliffin Lodge, Hotel & Spa\n\nPlay: Old Links & Glashedy Links at Ballyliffin, and Old Tom Morris Links or Sandy Hills Course at Rosapenna\n\nEnniscrone\n\nThe next course on the list is in the Sligo area of the Northwest where we find Enniscrone, roughly 3 hours (by car) south of Ballyliffin. Like many links courses, Enniscrone was originally a 9-hole course when it was opened in 1918 before an additional 9 holes were added 12 years later. In 1970, Eddie Hackett was tasked with redesigning the course to help the two 9-hole courses flow effortlessly into one 18 hole layout. A big feature that can be seen throughout your round here are the towering dunes that shape the course and protect some holes from the ocean winds. Built right out of the landscape of the dunes bordering the sea, the course has a lot of undulation in the fairways and greens with some elevated tee boxes providing unreal views of the natural land.\n\nHow to incorporate Enniscrone in a golf trip:\n\nStay: The Glasshouse Hotel, Sligo\n\nPlay: Enniscrone, County Sligo, and Donegal\n\nAdditional Courses: Strandhill, Carne, and Narin & Portnoo\n\nSt. Patrick’s Links\n\nAnother fantastic gem on the Northwest coast of Ireland is the NEW (2020) St. Patricks Links at Rosapenna Hotel & Golf Links. The land was purchased back in 2012 which was already a 36-hole facility and Tom Doak was brought in to reimagine the property to the layout it currently is today. Large sand dunes shape the front 9 holes before heading back through some more subtle dunes back towards the clubhouse. The course offers elevation changes with some tee boxes sitting atop the dunes offering spectacular views of Sheephaven Bay and beyond. With two other courses and a fantastic hotel on property, this destination is all you could ever ask for.\n\nStay: Rosapenna Hotel & Golf Links\n\nPlay: St. Patrick’s Links, Sandy Hills Course , and Old Tom Morris Links (all at Rosapenna)\n\nIsland Club\n\nFor our last hidden gem in Ireland, we head 30 minutes north of the country’s capital, Dublin, to The Island Club. Built along rugged terrain and the highest sand dunes on the east coast of Ireland, the Island Club is situated on a small peninsula surrounded by water on three sides providing a difficult challenge, especially with the winds. Founded in 1890, the Island Club continues to be ranked in the Top 10 courses in Ireland and has held some Amateur Championships and Open Championship Regional Qualifiers.\n\nHow to incorporate The Island Club in a golf trip:\n\nStay: The Grand Hotel, Malahide\n\nPlay: Island Club, Portmarnock Old, County Louth\n\nAdditional Courses: Royal Dublin\n\nSCOTLAND\n\nDunbar\n\nLocated along “Scotland’s Golf Coast” of East Lothian is where we find the classic links of Dunbar. Opened in 1856 with only 15 holes, this is one of the many courses in Scotland that Old Tom Morris had a hand in crafting. Laid out along rocky and rocky terrain, the course is only 6500 yards long and while not long by modern standards, the course requires shot making and proper club selection to play well. The course has held many national and international tournaments including a few rounds of The Open Final Qualifying.\n\nHow to incorporate Dunbar in a golf trip:\n\nStay: No. 12 Hotel & Bistro\n\nPlay: Dunbar, Gullane (No.1), North Berwick\n\nAdditional Courses: Craigielaw, Kilspindie, Gullane (No.2, No. 3)\n\nCruden Bay\n\nThe next course on our list brings us to the Scottish Highlands, one of the lesser traveled destinations in Scotland, but still home to some amazing links courses including Cruden Bay! Located 25 miles north of Aberdeen on the east coast of the Highlands, Cruden Bay was opened in 1899, although history would indicate golf has been played at the property since 1791. Another Old Tom Morris design, the course is consistently ranked in the Top 25 of courses in Scotland and it is easy to see why. At only 6600 yards, it is relatively short, but the natural lay of the land provides elevation changes, punchbowl greens, and some large, 3-story high dunes that offer spectacular views for a classic links experience.\n\nHow to incorporate Cruden Bay in a golf trip:\n\nStay: Leonardo Hotel Aberdeen\n\nPlay: Cruden Bay, Trump International Links, Royal Aberdeen\n\nAdditional Courses: Murcar\n\nBrora\n\nWe head back to the Highlands just north of Dornoch to where we find Brora Golf Club. Similar to a lot of links courses, Brora opened as only 9 holes in 1891, but that only lasted for 9 years before an additional 9 was added in 1900 before a James Braid redesign in 1924. At just over 6200 yards, this is one of those courses that will make you appreciate links golf in Scotland with cattle and sheep roaming freely around the property. The course is a typical links routing with the front 9 going out and the back 9 coming back to the clubhouse. The defense of the course is the wind (naturally), but the greens are relatively small with pot bunkers standing guard to catch errant approach shots.\n\nHow to incorporate Brora in a golf trip:\n\nStay: Royal Golf Hotel, Dornoch\n\nPlay: Brora, Royal Dornoch – Struie & Championship\n\nAdditional Courses: Golspie, Tain\n\nNairn\n\nStaying in the Scottish Highlands, the last Scotland links gem on the list is just outside of Inverness at The Nairn Golf Club. The narrow fairways are fast and firm leading to decent sized, tricky greens that roll true, but are guarded by devious pot bunkers. The first seven holes play right along the water and with not a ton of elevation changes, spectacular views across the Moray Firth can be seen throughout the course. With fantastic course conditions throughout the season, this fantastic links is an absolute must-play when visiting the Highlands.\n\nHow to incorporate Nairn in a golf trip:\n\nStay: Kingsmills Hotel, Inverness\n\nPlay: Nairn, Castle Stuart (Cabot Highlands), Fortrose & Rosemarkie\n\nAdditional Courses: Nairn Dunbar, Moray\n\nGolfbreaks by PGA TOUR highly recommends you start planning your trip across the pond AT LEAST 12-18 months in advance in order to secure tee times and hotel rooms over the dates you desire. With more and more people taking up the game of golf, these bucket list trips have already become extremely popular and will continue to gain interest so make sure to start planning early!\n\nRELATED: Open Championship courses you can play (and when the best time to book is)\n\nEditor’s note: This article is presented in partnership with Golfbreaks.

Golf’s original major dates all the way back to 1860 and has been played at 14 different courses throughout the United Kingdom (yes, this includes Northern Ireland) providing countless memories including celebrations, heartbreak, and unique moments that will never be forgotten (looking at you Jordan Spieth).\n\nWith The Open teeing off less than a week from now, we wanted to highlight some of The Open Championship’s finest links courses that should play when you make the journey to golf’s homeland:\n\nOld Course at St. Andrews\n\nCarnoustie\n\nMuirfield\n\nRoyal Portrush\n\nRoyal Troon\n\nRoyal Birkdale\n\nRoyal St George’s\n\nOld Course at St. Andrews\n\nDo we even need to say anything else? The “Home of Golf”, host of 30 Open Championships, the most coveted tee time in the WORLD, there are a million reasons to have St. Andrews on your links golf bucket list. From the double greens, to the tee shot over the Old Course Hotel, to the walk up 18th fairway with the town buildings framing a picturesque scene (especially at dusk), every golfer should make the voyage to St Andrews at least once in their life.\n\nCarnoustie\n\nRoughly 25 miles north of St. Andrews lies the devious links of Carnoustie, often recognized by the large white Carnoustie Golf Hotel as the backdrop of the 18th green. While the course has only hosted The Open 8 times, it is considered to be one of the hardest layouts in The Open rota (just ask Jean Van de Velde) although not that long, playing just under 7000 yards from the tips.\n\nMuirfield\n\nLocated right next to this week’s host of Scottish Open (The Renaissance Club), this fantastic links layout has hosted the prestigious Championship 16 times since 1892. The narrow fairways and penal rough requires precise shots off the tee while avoiding the devious pot bunkers is a must. The course is set away from the coastline so you won’t get the sweeping ocean views, but a round at Muirfield is one the premier tee times in all of Scotland (so make sure you book early – 12-18 months at least).\n\nRoyal Portrush\n\nOur next stop brings us across the Irish Sea to the northern coast of Northern Ireland and the popular Royal Portrush. Having hosted The Open only twice in its illustrious history, Royal Portrush is a golfer’s dream with 36 holes of pure links golf set against a gorgeous backdrop of the ocean and cliffs. The Open Championship will return to Portrush in 2025 and YOU CAN BE THERE to watch it all in person!\n\nRoyal Troon\n\nThe host of this year’s Open Championship, Royal Troon is home to one of the best par-3 holes in all of golf, “The Postage Stamp.” A downhill 125-yard tee shot to a minuscule green surrounded by bunkers on all sides makes it one of the more challenging holes. Another hole that adds to the challenge is the 601-yard par 5 that used to be the longest golf hole in Open Championship history. This year will be the 10th Open Championship held at Royal Troon, the first since 2016 when Mickelson and Stenson had a battle for the ages in the final round.\n\nRoyal Birkdale\n\nFor the next course on the list, we have to head down to the northwest coast of England just outside of Liverpool. Consistently ranked in the Top 10 courses in all the UK, this 10-time host of The Open has hosted many other prestigious events such as Ryder Cups, Women’s Opens, and more! The course is laid out with fairways running through flat-bottomed valleys surrounded by high dunes which provide many blind shots throughout the course. The Open returns to Royal Birkdale in 2026 so it won’t be long before it is back in the spotlight.\n\nRoyal St. George’s\n\nFor the final course on our list, we are staying in England, but heading across to the southeastern side of the country to Kent. Royal St. George’s is 4th on the list of most Open Championships hosted with 15 (1 behind Muirfield) the most recent being Collin Morikawa’s victory in 2021. RSG is the only active course on The Open rota in this part of the UK, but two former hosts (Prince’s and Royal Cinque Ports) are within 3 miles of the property. The expansive course is laid out with holes separated by dunes with heavy rough, undulating fairways, and deep pot bunkers to challenge your game. While it may not be mentioned in the discussions of St. Andrews, Carnoustie, and the like, Royal St. George’s is still a Championship layout that is worth the trip across the pond.\n\nWith these big-name courses in such high demand, it is important to note that if you want to play them, you need to start planning your trip early.
