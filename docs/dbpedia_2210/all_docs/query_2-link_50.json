        "text": "I’m not a fan of the phrase “favorite student” but I do like celebrating the successess of ALL my students, and after 22 years I know of a few 🥇 and they are the “memorable” ones, the ones who never stop being a student, who know that experiencal “failure” is the only true path to success, otherwise it is all theory with no application. They are often the ones receptive to building an entrepreneurial MINDSET/SKILL SET. Guest speakers spark their imagination, and I nurture their creativity and confidence. I also teach collaboration skills and hold students accountable for their success. The concept of “grading” is fading fast, I prefer the portfolio approach and grade the project AND the process. Students also peer and self assess. The weekly reflection is my usual go-to. And yes, I still have to turn in those A’s and B’s with an occasional C, D or F. If you get below a B it is not my fault btw. Some students (and parents) still see good GPA’s (aka Godly Professor A’s) as the path to a great ROI, and turn to US News and Reports as their “financial advisor.” But a better way to think about “investing in someone’s future” is to learn about what those “creative kids” are up too. News flash, they are not all art students but most of mine are. Granted, less are Art History majors, most are Studio who take an art history class or two! Chris Sainato was one such student. After Modern Art and a paper on Russian Revolution Graphic Posters, he took my Business of Art and Entrepreneurship. I had to wait till after I got the “golden ring” to unwed myself from worrying about what others think and develop this course, yes, I got tenure in 2008. I have to admit, it felt good to title my course with those two words; I can’t tell you the number of times I heard “we’re not a business school, you are teaching at a Liberal Arts College Lorraine.” Some I knew had not yet wrapped their head around teaching #entrepreneurship and that was ok. But the students….that was a whole different story. Class had waiting lists, taught it every other year now every year for past four and may teach 2 x a year given the demand. But I digress….this is not about me being spiteful, holding grudges or complaining or any of that, who has time !? It’s about the STUDENT. And the ones who are happy (THAT is what success looks like) they tend to be the creative, compassionate, kind and dedicated ones, not deterred by the naysayers, the “what are you going to do with an art degree?” kind. No, these are the students who knew that hard work is not a sprint but a marathon. The students who knew it might take a few years to get to the “starting pay of a STEM grad” (also a myth btw). But at the end of the day, I do have “favorites” and they are the ones who make me a better Professor. And here is one such former #Union student. Congratulations Chris. You have no idea how much joy this brings me!! Bravo my friend, bravo! Can’t wait to see what you and your team do next. 🏆🐳🌊⛵️👏✌🏼"
