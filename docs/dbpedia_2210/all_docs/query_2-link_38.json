        "text": "CARBON Financial was proud to support an initiative teed-up by 1999 Open champion Paul Lawrie to nurture the next generation of Scottish golfing talent.\n\nWhen the country was taking the first tentative steps back to normality post-lockdown, the Aberdonian decided to create the Tartan Pro Tour to provide professionals with an environment to compete at some of the country’s leading golf courses.\n\nAs a long-time corporate sponsor at Blairgowrie Golf Club, Carbon Financial was pleased to support the inaugural “Blairgowrie Perthshire Masters,” which was played out over two days on the Lansdowne and Rosemount championship courses.\n\nRyan Campbell (29), who developed his game at Falkirk Golf Club and now enjoys an attachment to The Renaissance Club, enjoyed his first pro victory, with a tricky four-foot putt at the last securing a single shot victory over St Andrews Classic winner Danny Young (Craigie Hill), Michael Stewart (Troon Welbeck) and Fraser Moore (Glenbervie).\n\nManaging director Gordon Wilson was on hand to congratulate Campbell, who secured a four-figure cheque and a range of sponsors’ gifts for impressive rounds of 67 (-5) and 68 (-4).\n\n“It’s fantastic that Paul has thrown his weight behind this Tour to help the professionals get competitive action under their belt at some of the country’s top courses,” said Gordon. \"In a busy schedule, Paul made time to play both rounds and it is clear his support for younger players in particular is highly valued. We have a long-standing relationship with Blairgowrie Golf Club as a corporate partner and it was great to hear the glowing feedback from the pros.”\n\nWinner Campbell revealed he had enjoyed a memorable win on what was now home turf.\n\n“It’s my first professional win over a tournament that was more than one round. It’s good to get it over the line,” he said. “I have played a lot here in the past (with Blairgowrie’s Challenge Tour player Bradley Neil) and I decided to become a member this year. The courses and facilities are fantastic. It is one of my favourite places to play golf. I absolutely love it here.”\n\nCampbell has been playing on the PGA EuroPro Tour in recent years and has enjoyed European Tour and Challenge Tour invitations this season.\n\n“There were a few players on my tail and I knew I had to hole a four-footer on the 18th to win,” he said. “The standard is very high. There are a lot of very good golfers playing in these events.”\n\nLawrie was delighted that Carbon Financial and a string of businesses have backed his vision.\n\n“We already have a number of excellent young pros making a name for themselves and the more the merrier,” he said. “Hopefully we will see another Scottish player winning The Open in the near future. The quality is certainly there at all levels, as we saw demonstrated at the Perthshire Masters. It’s great that companies like Carbon Financial have come on board to support us.”\n\nStuart Wilson, managing secretary at Blairgowrie, added: “We enjoy close ties with Gordon and the Carbon Financial team so it was lovely to team-up to support the Blairgowrie Perthshire Masters tournament.\n\n“The green staff deserve all the kudos coming their way from the competitors. That’s what we want to hear from visitors. They are accustomed to presenting golf courses in superb condition for our members but it was nice to hear many of the pros saying Blairgowrie is their favourite inland golf venue.”"
