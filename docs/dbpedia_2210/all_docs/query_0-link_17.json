        "text": "Paul Lawrie's legacy at the Open Championship will stand the test of time.\n\nThe remarkable win at Carnoustie in 1999 cemented Lawrie's status in the history books. Not only is he the last Scot to have lifted the Claret Jug, but the most recent to do it on home soil since James Braid at St Andrews in 1910.\n\nLawrie is among the former champions who will be returning to the famous old town and the home of golf for the 150th Open Championship this week.\n\nWith that in mind, here is a look at Lawrie's record at the world's most prestigious golf tournament over a 30-year period:\n\nREAD NEXT: University of Aberdeen ranked 4th in the UK for student satisfaction\n\n1990's\n\nA fresh-faced Lawrie made his Open Championship debut at Muirfield 30 years ago this year. The Aberdonian turned professional in 1986 and was a steady performer.\n\nLawrie joined the European Tour in 1992 and in the same year, took his Open bow with aplomb. He tied 22nd at the championship, won for the third time by Nick Faldo.\n\nThat experience would stand the Scot in good stead for what would follow the next year at Royal St George's. Lawrie finished tied for sixth alongside future Open winners Ernie Els and Nick Price after a superb final day round of 65. Greg Norman would claim the Claret Jug, two shots ahead of Faldo.\n\nLawrie would finish tied 24th at Turnberry in 1994, won by Price and tied 58th in his St Andrews debut the following year. Disappointment would follow in the late 90's after missing the cut in 1996 and 1998.\n\nHowever, life for the man nicknamed \"Chippy\" would change forever on a breath-taking final day at Carnoustie.\n\nStarting the final day 10 shots behind, a stunning final round 67 was enough to get him into a play-off with Jean Van de Velde, of France, and American Justin Leonard.\n\nVan de Velde's mind-boggling collapse after a comfortable lead is one of the most infamous in golfing history. The Frenchman only needed a double-bogey six on the 18th to become the first French winner of a major tournament since 1907.\n\nHe suffered three dropped shots including bizarrely removing his socks and shoes in an effort to chip the ball out of the Barry Burn water hazard. Lawrie kept a cool head and performed sensationally to win the play-off.\n\nThe Scot's win is all the more astonishing given he was neither leader nor co-leader at any point during the four days, only sharing the lead once he had completed his final round.\n\n2000's\n\nLawrie was hoping to kick-off the millenium by retaining the Claret Jug. However, a certain Tiger Woods claimed his first Open Championship and fourth major title aged just 24 at St Andrews.\n\nWoods swept away the chasing pack with the aforementioned Els and Thomas Bjorn nine shots back. Lawrie failed to make the cut but bounced back at Lytham St Annes the following year after tying 42nd.\n\nHe dipped slightly to tied 52nd in 2002 and missed the cut until 2005 where Woods again triumphed at St Andrews.\n\nLawrie finished the decade at Turnberry by finishing tied for 47th. The great Tom Watson looked set for a glorious renaissance but was pipped in a play-off by Stewart Cink.\n\nAnd Lawrie himself made history at the Ayrshire course by scoring what is believed to be only the eighth albatross (double eagle) in Open history after holing his second at the par five seventh in the final round.\n\n2010's\n\nAfter failing to make it through to the weekend action in 2010, Lawrie produced an improved display 12 months later at Royal St George's. Darren Clarke's unforgettable victory in Kent stole the headlines in an event that saw Lawrie tied 66th.\n\nIn 2012, Lawrie would card his best score at Open since his win 13 years earlier. Lawrie was tied for second after the opening round at Lytham St Annes on five-under-par, one shot behind Adam Scott.\n\nDespite a 71 on day two, Lawrie was still in the hunt on four-under-par but Brandt Snedeker reached 10-under-par after a bogey-free round. Lawrie fell out of contention thereafter, however, and Els eventually claimed the Claret Jug.\n\nLawrie would better his score from 2012 at Gullane by finishing tied 26th. He didn't make it to the top 10 of the leaderboard at any stage but enjoyed a solid tournament, won by Phil Mickelson.\n\nThe Scot failed to make the cut in 2014 but finished tied 40th and 63rd in the following years. He missed the cut in 2017 and was cruelly denied an emotional return to Carnoustie in 2018 through injury.\n\nHe last played the Open at Portrush, won by Irish hero Shane Lowry, in 2019. He missed the cut after posting a five-over-par score in Northern Ireland.\n\nLawrie will undoubtedly be thrilled to have the chance to play at St Andrews in the 150th Open. Even better, he'll be teeing it up alongside one of his proteges and fellow Aberdonian, David Law.\n\nAnything can happen at a major tournament and time will tell if Lawrie can roll back the years at the home of golf.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
