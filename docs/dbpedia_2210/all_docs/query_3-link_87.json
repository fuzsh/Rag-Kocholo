        "text": "Paul Lawrie romped to his second European Tour win of the season and 13th career title with a final round four-under 68 Sunday in the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles.\n\nThe 43-year-old Scot had already clinched his place in Europe’s Ryder Cup side, but underlined his selection with a superb performance in front of his home fans to finish on 16-under 272.\n\nLeading by a shot overnight, Lawrie extended his advantage to four stokes over runner-up Brett Rumford of Australia.\n\nBelgium’s Nicolas Colsaerts, who needed to finish in the top two to claim his automatic place in the team, faded to tie for 19th.\n\nIt left Germany’s Martin Kaymer secure in the top 10 qualifiers with captain Jose Maria Olazabal due to name his two wild cards for Medinah Monday.\n\nColsaerts is still favorite to win the nod alongside England’s Ian Poulter, who has an outstanding Ryder Cup record.\n\nLawrie, the 1999 British Open champion, won the Qatar Masters in February and has been consistent all season to seal his second appearance for Europe in the team competition against the United States.\n\nDutchman Maarten Lafeber (69), France’s Romain Wattel (72) and Sweden’s Fredrik Anderssen-Hed (65) shared third place on 11-under par.\n\nFormer European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie also gave the home fans more cheer with an excellent three under 69 to finish in a tie for sixth, his best performance in 2012."
