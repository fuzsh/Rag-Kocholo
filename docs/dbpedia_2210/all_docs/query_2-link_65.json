        "text": "HE is the last European to win a Major after claiming his home Open the last time it was staged at Carnoustie.\n\nHe is a proud Scot who showed his raw courage in the bearpit of Brookline at the Ryder Cup.\n\nAnd he is a dedicated husband and father still living in the town of his birth.\n\nBut despite these undoubted achievements and attributes, after eight long years, like it or not, Paul Lawrie has finally come to accept an unmistakable fact of life.\n\nHe will always be known as the bloke who won The Open when Jean Van de Velde collapsed at the last in 1999.\n\n\"You live and learn,\" he said with the stoicism bred of a lifetime supporting Aberdeen FC.\n\n\"Whether you are upset by it or not, the only person who is damaged by it is you. It is damaging your golf. I gave up a long time ago trying to change history.\n\n\"I think it bugged me for a while the way the media saw it and latched on to what he did rather than what I did.\n\n\"But you can't change the world so you get on with it. I know my name is on that jug and it is not coming off and that is all that matters at the end of the day.\n\n\"I wish I had that mentality at the time. If I had thought that earlier, it would have been better for me.\n\n\"But Nick Faldo was handed a couple of Masters - that is just the way it is. He was our best ever player and he was given a couple. I am the way that I am. I think I am a good person and you have just got to get on with it.\"\n\nThe charismatic Frenchman stole the headlines to start a trend which has continued, but illness has ruled him out of trying to make this year's Open.\n\nBut Lawrie's story was remarkable, having come through local qualifying on the Monday and driving an hour down from his home in the Granite City every day.\n\n\"Michael was only seven months old and Craig was four so I was going home and changing nappies every night and hoovering and all sorts,\" he recalled. \"I remember giving Michael his breakfast on the morning before the last round. You have got to help out.\"\n\nThe leaders were only on the 11th hole when Lawrie posted his four-under 67 total - \"my best ever round\" - on that final day.\n\nBut he never led or co-led until Van de Velde concocted his logic-defying triple bogey at the last. With the Frenchman still shellshocked, Lawrie won the four-hole play-off - which also included Justin Leonard - to set a record of closing a 10-shot deficit on the final day to win a Major.\n\nSo has he ever spoken to Van de Velde about the incredible events of that day? \"No,\" Lawrie stated without emotion.\n\n\"We have never really been in the same circles. I remember at the World Series in Ohio later that year, I was sitting having breakfast and he came and sat with me and we chatted away. But no mention, obviously, of Carnoustie. He is a good enough sort of lad. It has never been a problem.\"\n\nBut does Lawrie feel sympathy. \"It doesn't enter my thoughts at all about him or any other player,\" he said. \"I look after my ball and that is all I can do.\"\n\nBut in different ways, both the main protagonists that day were scarred by the experience. The winner did not take it all. While Van de Velde is now No.203 in the world, Lawrie is 276.\n\n\"I have never been overly comfortable with the spotlight because I am not that kind of person,\" admitted Lawrie, who has won only twice since. \"I am a back-of-the-room person rather than a front-of-the-room person. I don't really need it. I don't have an ego. I am unbelievably normal, as I should be.\"\n\nIs that how he would like to go down in history?\n\n\"I would like to be remembered as honest and a good father,\" he said."
