        "text": "The Scot collected the honour at The PGA’s annual fundraising lunch at the Grosvenor House hotel in London on Friday, December 18.\n\nLawrie, who as a young golfer qualified as a PGA Professional before establishing himself on tour, has tasted many career highlights, notably winning the 1999 Open, at Carnoustie and as a key member of Europe’s Ryder Cup team at the Miracle of Medinah in 2012\n\nBut despite his personal success, Lawrie has always found time to support golf in Scotland both at grass roots with the Paul Lawrie Foundation and up to elite level where he is a mentor to a number of promising players in their bid to succeed on tour.\n\nDespite winning arguably golf’s greatest tournament, and playing a vital part in one of the most memorable Ryder Cups ever, thoughts of playing tour golf were not a high priority for a teenage Lawrie.\n\nBut his fledgling talent was spotted by the late Banchory pro Doug Smart during one of Lawrie’s outings with the taxi drivers of Aberdeen – one of whom was his dad who owned a cab firm\n\nEagle-eyed Smart was impressed by the young Lawrie and hinted to his father that a potential career route with The PGA beckoned.\n\nFrom raw beginnings, Lawrie turned himself into one of the finest ball-strikers on tour and with 25 years on tour under his belt, can reflect on an impressive career which has brought eight European Tour wins and most memorably his famous Open triumph at Carnoustie in 1999.\n\nAn Honorary Life Member ofa the European Tour, Lawrie’s commitment to golf was highlighted this year by hosting his own Tour event - the Saltire Energy Paul Lawrie Match Play at Murcar Links.\n\n“I’m honoured to receive the PGA’s Recognition Award as I’m proud to be a member of The PGA,” said Lawrie who joins an illustrious list of names to have won the award including the late Seve Ballesteros, Colin Montgomerie and current Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke.\n\n“I started my career as an assistant at Banchory, training under Doug Smart, and learned skills that I still put in to practise today.\n\n“It means a great deal that the work that my wife Marian and I have done building the Foundation to the level it is at today is being recognised by The Association, alongside my playing career.”\n\nSandy Jones, PGA chief executive, said: “I’m delighted that Paul has received the PGA Recognition Award. Having known Paul since he was a young PGA assistant, I know how hard he has worked to scale the heights of the game and no-one deserves their success more than him.\n\n“What is even more remarkable is his determination and dedication to give something back to the sport through the Paul Lawrie Foundation.\n\n“He is a credit to the PGA, the European Tour and the wider game of golf.”"
