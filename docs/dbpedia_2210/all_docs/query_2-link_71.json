        "text": "This year's major tournaments may be consigned to history, but 2023 marks the return of one of the greatest events not only in golf but in team sport.\n\nThousands will jet into Rome in September to watch the finest men's golfers from Europe and the United States do battle for the Ryder Cup.\n\nScotland and the north-east has its own legacy with that famous trophy from Bernard Gallacher's captaincy at Oak Hill, Sam Torrance's stewardship at The Belfry to Paul Lawrie's unforgettable part in the Miracle at Medinah.\n\nREAD MORE: English Championship quartet 'preparing' bids for Aberdeen star Duk\n\nWhile Lawrie, understandably, receives the deserved recognition for his phenomenal achievements in the modern era, one Aberdeenshire man's Ryder Cup legacy will stand the test of time.\n\nMethlick-born George Duncan is arguably the greatest golfer to have ever come out of the north-east of Scotland and his accomplishments in the game are shamefully overlooked.\n\nThe regard in which he was held within the sport led him to be nicknamed \"the pro's pro\", thanks to his unrivalled teachings and swing analysis for his era.\n\nDuncan, the son of a policeman, was born in September 1883 and his sporting talents as a youth were not restricted to the burgeoning national game, having rejected the chance to play football for Aberdeen.\n\nHe was a carpenter to trade but turned professional at 17, missing the cut in his first three Open Championships before securing top 10 finishes back-to-back between 1907-08.\n\nDuncan finished third in 1910 and again secured top 10 places until the outbreak of World War One. In a remarkable turnaround, Duncan was victorious in the 1920 Open at Royal Cinque Ports.\n\nHe shot 80 in his first two rounds, 13 behind the leader, but produced an astonishing comeback to lift the Claret Jug and remains the last player to win a golf major with a score of 80 or more for a round.\n\nThe north-east man seldom played in the United States but found top 10 success at the US Open in 1921 and 1922, and would soon become more acquainted with his American cousins a few years later.\n\nIn early 1926, the idea for a match between British and American professional golfers was proposed - partly by Duncan - to golf fanatic and entrepreneur Samuel Ryder, who sponsored the event.\n\nAn informal match was held at Wentworth, Surrey and was the pre-cursor to the inaugural 1927 Ryder Cup in Worcester, Massachusetts where 43-year-old Duncan was part of the first British team.\n\nDuncan was the only Scot selected in the team and Great Britain were demolished by a star-studded squad of Americans, captained by the legendary Walter Hagen. He also had the honour of being the only Brit to win a singles match in the tournament.\n\nHowever, fortunes would change dramatically two years later when the Ryder Cup was held on British soil for the first time.\n\nDuncan was named captain for the event at Moortown Golf Club, Leeds, and would again come up against Hagen who hoped to lead the USA to back-to-back victories.\n\nRevenge would be sweet for Duncan who cemented his legendary status as player-captain, defeating Hagen 10-and-8 in singles as part of an overall 7-5 win. He holds the distinction as the first ever victorious British captain in the tournament.\n\nDuncan, who was a club professional in Stonehaven, would play his last Ryder Cup in 1931 but it would be in a losing effort in Columbus, Ohio. Hagen would have the last laugh in a 9-3 triumph.\n\nAlthough best remembered for his Open win, Duncan's contribution to the early incarnations of the Ryder Cup are worthy of greater recognition. He continued playing in his later years and died in Leeds aged 80 in 1964.\n\nDuncan was hugely respected by his peers with the legendary broadcaster Peter Allis - whose father Percy played with Duncan in the first Ryder Cup - saying: \"Together with Abe Mitchell, George Duncan was the best British player of the era that linked the Great Triumvirate with the age of (Henry) Cotton. But Duncan won the Open Championship, Mitchell didn't.\""
