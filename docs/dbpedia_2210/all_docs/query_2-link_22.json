        "text": "Lawrie, sits fourth in the table that will supply 10 players in September after his run of four top-10 finishes reached a climax with victory at the Qatar Masters.\n\nBut even though he could quickly be overtaken as golf’s run of World Championships and Majors gets under way this month, Olazabal clearly wants Lawrie in his team.\n\n“I have always seen Paul as a very solid player,” he said, as the pair limbered up for today’s start of the Dubai Desert Classic.\n\n“He is the type of player you need to have on a Ryder Cup team – a player who you can combine and pair with other players.\n\n“It is going to be very important for Paul to be in the Majors and the WGCs because, first of all, the Ryder Cup points are huge.\n\n“But then guys like Paul, who have already won over ¤1million in the qualifying period, are already well on the way and, by getting into those events, you only have to play half-decent and you’re going to increase your points.”\n\nAlthough after winning The Open at Carnoustie Lawrie played alongside Olazabal in the 1999 Ryder Cup at Brookline, winning three and a half points out of five, his mediocre form since has limited him to just one more team appearance.\n\nThat was under Olazabal’s captaincy of the European team that took on Asia in The Royal Trophy in Thailand in 2009 but, even so, the Spaniard has clearly followed him closely since, even remarking of the sad death of Lawrie’s long-time coach Adam Hunter last summer.\n\n“Paul has been playing well ever since Adam passed away,” said Olazabal, who is clearly not worried that Lawrie will be 43 by Ryder Cup time.\n\n“Age is only a figure,” he said. “And even with Paul being into his 40s makes no difference.”"
