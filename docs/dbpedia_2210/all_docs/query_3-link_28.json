        "text": "We grabbed a minute with 1999 Open champion Paul Lawrie to discuss greatest shots, dream cars, and what he can knock up in the kitchen…\n\nBest ever shot?\n\nThe 4-iron in the playoff at The Open at Carnoustie in 1999. All I was thinking about was taking it away smoothly.\n\nBest ever round?\n\nThe singles match again Brandt Snedeker at Medinah. It was the most pressure I’ve ever felt. I was 6-under for 15 holes. In that situation, on that course, in that tournament, it doesn’t get better than that.\n\nWorst nightmare you’ve witnessed from an amateur in a pro-am?\n\nIt was just after I’d won The Open. This guy had been told to play by his boss, but he wasn’t a regular golfer. He was shaking like a leaf on the first tee and completely fresh-aired it. He looked up and said, “Where did it go?” I said, “It’s still on the tee”.\n\nDream car?\n\nFerrari 550. I was so chuffed when I got one. And you can get your clubs in the boot without taking the woods out!\n\nLeast amount of sleep before a round?\n\nI got about 30 minutes sleep the night before I played with Seve for the first time. He was my ultimate golf hero.\n\nLongest you’ve gone without hitting a ball?\n\nI didn’t hit a ball for about six weeks after I trapped a nerve in my neck. Normally I hit balls every day.\n\nSpeciality in the kitchen?\n\nI’m hopeless. I can’t cook, apart from tea and toast in the morning. My wife’s bolognese is my favourite, with a nice pint of Belhaven.\n\nIf you hadn’t been a golfer, what would you have done?\n\nI’d love to have been a rally driver, but I doubt I’d have had enough talent. I would’ve been more than happy being a club pro. I went through my PGA training and if I couldn’t have made it playing, I’d have been the best club pro I could be.\n\nHow many holes-in-one have you had?\n\nFour, I think. I had one when I was a junior at Kemnay as a young boy, and I’ve had three on tour. I won an Audi for one in the Irish Open a few years ago."
