        "text": "Paul Lawrie fears that the Ryder Cup captaincy selection could be \"a joke\" if Thomas Bjorn is named Europe's replacement skipper for 2023 despite being on the voting panel.\n\nLawrie, the 1999 Open champion and two-time Ryder Cupper, is one of the contenders to replace Henrik Stenson after the Swede relinquished the role to join LIV Golf.\n\nThe Scot was vice captain to Darren Clarke at Hazeltine in 2016 and will be near the top of the selection list alongside the likes of Bjorn, Luke Donald and Robert Karlsson for the newly-vacant Rome 2023 job. However, Lawrie has heard of Bjorn becoming captain again \"being bandied about\" and has implied that he shouldn't get the job due to being on the selection panel\n\nThe process is the process,” Lawrie told The Telegraph at last week's Senior Open.\n\n“My situation has not changed, I assume they just go back to the way they did it before, with the five guys voting on the other three people who were up for the job initially.\n\n“I’m led to believe that might not be the case. And if it’s not the case then it’s a joke, to be honest.\n\n“You hear Thomas' name being bandied about now. I don’t see how that can be the case. He’s voting. How can you get the job when you are voting? Now that Henrik is out of the picture, surely the same five people vote for the three who were up for the job in the first place.\n\nGet the Golf Monthly Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to the Golf Monthly newsletter to stay up to date with all the latest tour news, equipment news, reviews, head-to-heads and buyer’s guides from our team of experienced experts.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n“You can’t change the rules. The process is the process. Let’s see. It’ll be fun and games if it’s not, I’m telling you.”\n\nIt remains to be seen who Europe's next Ryder Cup captain will be, with an announcement expected soon ahead of the match starting in just 14 months' time.\n\nElliott Heath is our News Editor and has been with Golf Monthly since early 2016 after graduating with a degree in Sports Journalism.
