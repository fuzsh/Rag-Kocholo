        "text": "It is far easier said than done, but one obvious way to earn the acclaim of golfing aficionados in the United States is to win the Masters. Paul Lawrie rightly insisted in the immediate aftermath of a first-round 69 that no thoughts of claiming the Green Jacket have entered his head. Nonetheless, few players are more deserving of being catapulted back into the game's consciousness on this side of the Atlantic than the Scot. Thankfully, Lawrie did not let a quest for recognition earlier in his career manifest itself to the extent that he became bitter.\n\nThe 2009 Open Championship will forever be remembered for the performance of the veteran Tom Watson, with the fact Stewart Cink actually won being a mere afterthought. Likewise, the Open of a decade earlier is instantly identified by the ludicrous image of Jean van de Velde splashing about in Carnoustie's Barry Burn in his bare feet. Lawrie lifted the Claret Jug that day and he is correct to believe due credit has never been handed out during the intervening years.\n\nLawrie regards himself as a superior player to 1999, a matter emphasised by his Thursday performance at Augusta. \"I'm older now and I would like to think a little more mature, although some would argue that point,\" said the 43-year-old. \"I kind of feel this course is all about the speed and patience. I struggled with that on the front nine but then got into it in the back nine.\"\n\nIndeed, two inward-half moments of brilliance were central to his score; a 240-yard approach to the 13th, and chip-in from off the green two holes later. Both ensured eagles. After finishing on three-under par, Lawrie addressed the age-old issue of recognition, or a lack of it. By his own admission, he has spent years being irked by what he viewed as a diminishing – or ignorance – of what he achieved at Carnoustie in 1999. To this day, Americans will routinely pronounce Lawrie's name incorrectly.\n\n\"I tried for a while to change the way people saw it and I failed miserably, to be honest,\" the Scot said. \"It doesn't bother me any more. I just sort of do what I do and get on with it. [Lawrie's late coach] Adam Hunter used to get so frustrated with me. He used to pull his hair out with the way I saw things when people said something negative about me. It used to cause me so much grief.\n\n\"I kind of lost that a long time ago so it doesn't bother me any more. It doesn't alter my life if someone doesn't think I should have won and Jean should have. It used to, but not any more. We just get on with it. One day I just thought, 'man, what are you battling against this for?' There is just no point. People will respect you if you win tournaments.\"\n\nHunter, needless to say, would be proud of Lawrie's start in the 76th Masters. The respected coach lost his battle with leukaemia last October, aged only 48.\n\n\"He's on my mind every day,\" Lawrie admitted. \"I think of him all the time, as you can imagine. It's just a pity he's not here. He would have been walking around, taking notes. We would have gone through it in the house at night. Obviously we can't do that anymore but I think of him every day.\"\n\nLawrie credits an upturn in his golfing fortunes over the past 13 months – he has won twice in that period – to a change in approach. Yet he secured this trip to Augusta with only weeks to spare, having also suffered from bronchitis in the lead up to the season's first major.\n\n\"There was a spell where I was playing tee to green as good as I could hit it, then having 34 or 35 putts,\" Lawrie recalled. \"So I put an awful lot of effort, when I'm at home, into working on my putting. I put more into that now than I ever did, meaning that I work on the right things. I do a lot of short game.\n\n\"I used to hit a lot of balls. I would hit 500, 600, 700 a day. That's not the way you are going to be a better player. The way to be a better player is to spend three hours a day chipping and putting, then working on the mental side at night. I've been doing a lot of that, so it is much better.\"\n\nThat confidence does not extend to any sentiment from Lawrie – publicly, at least – that he can win the Masters. \"I am not thinking about winning at all at the moment,\" he insisted. \"Obviously I've had a good day but I know there is a long way to go. I am not thinking about Sunday at all – that's a long way off.\"\n\nStill, Lawrie's showing compared favourably with more fancied competitors from Great Britain and Ireland. Justin Rose had an opening-round 72 and Ross Fisher a shot fewer. Padraig Harrington, who was an early leader on Thursday, also signed for a one-under 71.\n\nLawrie sent a text message to Craig Brown, the manager of his beloved Aberdeen football team, on Saturday evening to upbraid him – in jest – for the side's 3-0 loss to Heart of Midlothian. For now, Brown has absolutely no grounds to offer a cheeky reply."
