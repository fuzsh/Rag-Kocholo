        "text": "Paul Lawrie needs to win the second Open Championship of his career this weekend to qualify for his own tournament.\n\n1999 Open champion Lawrie is hosting the Saltire Energy Paul Lawrie Match Play in his home town of Aberdeen at the end of the month.\n\nThe new European Tour event will see the top 64 players in the Race to Dubai invited to play, and the two-time Ryder Cup player is currently down in 116th place.\n\n“I think I might get in if I win here this week - maybe it’s too late, I don’t know,” he laughed.\n\n“As I stand, I need to invite myself to my own tournament — which I will do, obviously.”\n\nLawrie shot an opening 66 at St Andrews on Thursday. He only fell off the top of the leaderboard when he made his only bogey at the 17th.\n\nThe 46-year-old needed just 16 putts on his first 13 holes and only needed one more at the 14th after nearly holing a wedge shot out of the rough from 123 yards.\n\nHe has already won once here this week in the Champions Challenge on Wednesday for Arnold Palmer’s team.\n\n“It was unbelievably cool to play with him - I absolutely loved it,” said Lawrie. “It was a dream come true.”"
