        "text": "Click here to sign up to our free newsletters!\n\nTOP GOLFER Paul Lawrie’s good deed for this week is to invest a four-figure sum in the future of Grantown’s EuroPro Tour player Duncan Stewart.\n\nThe 1999 Open champion is supporting a personal shares scheme set up by 27-year-old Stewart, a Scotland boys’ cap in 2002.\n\nHe is assisting Stewart through the Paul Lawrie Foundation, which has rookie pros David Law, Kris Nicol and Philip McLean under its wing,\n\nThe Grantown man, who turned pro in the autumn of 2007, was a winner on the EuroPro Tour last year but just missed out on the Challenge Tour.\n\nStewart said: “Paul texted me within an hour of me releasing the news of my shares scheme. He said he thought it was a good idea and that he wanted to buy ten shares at £100 each for his foundation and to have its logo on the chest of my golf shirts.\n\n“He also asked if I got any free clothing and, as I don’t, he has kindly said he will send me Glenmuir shirts and sweaters with his logo on them.\n\n“I really can’t thank Paul Lawrie enough. The work he does for Scottish golf, plus his support, is outstanding.\n\n“Having someone of his stature texting me and saying he would like to support me gives me a huge confidence boost for the new season.”\n\nStewart just missed out a Challenge Tour card for 2012 and he will be campaigning mainly on the EuroPro Tour.\n\nBut he says he will be trying his hardest to get invites to the Challenge Tour and will also try to qualify for The Open at Royal Lytham.\n\n“I am going to sell shares in myself to try and raise funds to pay for my season. I am trying to sell 150 shares at £100 per share,” said Stewart.\n\n“Depending on how many shares I sell will determine the percentage of my winnings that go back to the shareholders.\n\n“If I only sell one to 50 shares I will take 70% and 30% of my winnings will be divided out between those who have bought shares.\n\n“If I manage to sell between 101 and 150 shares, then my winnings will be split 50-50 between myself and the shareholders.”\n\nIf a company or an individual were to buy 10 or more shares they would be entitled to have their, or their company, name somewhere on my clothing or equipment.”\n\nHe added: “It is a great opportunity for someone to advertise, especially with the highlights of every event on the Europro tour being shown four times on Sky Sports.”\n\nStewart is also in the process of setting up his own website. There will be a link on it with the names of everyone who purchases one share or 50 shares.\n\nThe website should be up and running within the next week. It will have all the details of how the shares work with a copy of the contract for anyone interested to download.\n\nIf anyone is interested in following Paul Lawrie’s lead by investing in Stewart for the 2012 season, they can email him at duncanstewartgolf@hotmail.co.uk or call 07890 881042.\n\nLast week, the Scottish Golf Union announced that the Paul Lawrie Foundation was sponsoring this year’s Scottish boys’ championship at Murcar Links from April 9 to 14."
