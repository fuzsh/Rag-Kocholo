        "text": "My name is Lawrie. I am 70 and I have been married to Brenda for nearly 50 years. I have always been very active and I love bowling, dancing and gardening. We have a daughter, Jo, and two lovely granddaughters, Beth and Erin.\n\nThis is my journey before and after being diagnosed with a pituitary tumour. My story began in 1992. I was driving home on the M1 when I noticed a shadow over one of my eyes as I was overtaking a vehicle.\n\nOn the hard shoulder I noticed that it disappeared and then reappeared. I made an appointment with an optician who told me it could possibly be a neurological problem and referred me to Moorfields in London. I went straight there to the walk in clinic and was told I could possibly have inflammation of the optic nerve, or a pituitary tumour and would need further extensive tests. After this I was referred to The National Hospital Queens Square. I couldn’t imagine that I had a pituitary tumour. When the doctor came in after the brain scan and saw me he said ‘I afraid you have a tumour and we are going to admit you straight away – you need emergency surgery to save your eyesight.’\n\nI was under the care of Michael Powell who performed the operation the next week and I was discharged three days later and convalesced. I had a follow up appointment with Mr Powell who said the operation had been a success but he could not remove the root and I would need radiotherapy in the future. I was put on a high dose of hydrocortisone as soon as I had my operation but after scans and a check-up I was taken off the tablets. I would continue to be monitored.\n\nThe next year, 1994 – I was sent to the Middlesex hospital where I was then measured for my mask and started a 6 week programme of radiotherapy. I felt tired afterwards but had my treatment in the morning and went back to work in the afternoon – I tried not to give in.\n\nI had a good few years where I went for check-ups and had no problems. My daughter, Jo, got married to Paul and I have two wonderful granddaughters, Beth and Erin and I felt very lucky to have no problems.\n\nIn 2006, at my yearly check-up, I meet Dr Stephanie Baldeweg who commented that I looked tired. I had recently retired and was looking forward to a busy year, she suggested that I have a gold standard test that would check how my cortisol levels were working. After the results I was put on Thyroxine. At this point, I was having brain scans every 5 years and everything was fine. I had just had my 70th birthday celebration with my wife Brenda who is also 70 this year. I felt particularly tired and not myself so the endocrine doctors at University College Hospital decided to do a glucagon test which measures the cortisol level in the blood. I received the results by phone which told me what I had suspected that I now needed hydrocortisone replacement which I started straight away.\n\nMy wife and I went on holiday to Ironbridge for a few days on my return. I felt fine but a couple of days afterwards I started to feel off colour with back ache and tummy cramps which came and went. I took extra hydrocortisone but didn’t realise what was round the corner. I went to the out of hours doctor who thought I had picked up a virus. She asked for a urine sample and told me to take paracetamol and Buscapan. I went home and had a good night sleep but when I woke in the morning I felt light headed with a back and tummy ache. My wife was very concerned as I felt sick, light headed and dizzy. She said she was going to phone for help when all of a sudden I went rigid and had a seizure. My wife phone 999 and put me in the recovery position. 2 ambulances arrived with 4 crew!\n\nI was taken to Watford General Hospital and do not remember anything of this. I woke up in intensive care where I was for 4 days after which I was transferred to a ward for 5 days. I was told I had an Addison crisis and am now recovering at home. I will be going to the University College hospital endocrine department for follow up appointments.\n\nThis is a cautionary tale – we were aware of this condition, but we missed the signs. I thought I had minor tummy pains. It is a very serious condition and both the hospital and my GP said I am lucky to have survived. I am lucky that my wife Brenda was at home and able to get help so beware – it creeps up on you and bang! It’s upon you – so please beware it can happen to anyone and don’t ignore the signs.\n\nI would like to thank the ambulance crew, doctors and nurses at Watford General Hospital, my GP Dr McHugh and lastly my wife Brenda who is my angel. I am looking forward to celebrating my golden wedding with family and friends next April.\n\nLawrence Stebbeds"
