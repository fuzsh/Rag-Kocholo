        "text": "Paul Lawrie, The 1999 Open Champion, has confirmed he will play The Sinclair Invitational, which takes place at Hanbury Manor Marriott Hotel and Country Club from August 30-September 1.\n\nLawrie, who turned 50 earlier this year, adds to what is expected to be an extremely strong field of Ryder Cup stars and European Tour winners, with 2003 Open de France champion Philip Golding already confirmed for the tournament.\n\nLawrie famously won The Open Championship at Carnoustie Golf Links in 1999 as he defeated Justin Leonard and Jean van de Velde in a play-off and has a total of seven European Tour titles to his name.\n\nThe two-time Ryder Cup player is excited to continue his maiden season in the over-50s game and expects The Sinclair Invitational to be a great spectacle.\n\n“Duncan and Corrine Sinclair deserve enormous credit for building such a fantastic tournament and I am sure it will be a brilliant week on the Staysure Tour. Hanbury Manor is a wonderful venue and the perfect setting for one of the year’s biggest tournaments.”\n\nTo purchase tickets for The Sinclair Invitational, click here.\n\nFor information on the Pro-Am, Pro-Am Alliance sales and sponsorship packages, please contact Rhys Ford at Sportingclass: Rhysf@sportingclass.com\n\nFor more information:\n\nhttps://sportingclass.com/events/sinclair-charity-seniors/\n\nFollow latest updates @Sportingclass @SInvitational"
