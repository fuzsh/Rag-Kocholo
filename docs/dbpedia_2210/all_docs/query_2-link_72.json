        "text": "Whoever subbed victorious Ryder Cup captain, Colin ­Montgomerie’s new book should be in hot water with the Scot after getting Paul Lawrie’s name wrong in his book – ‘Monty – An Autobiography’\n\nAccording to the Sunday Mail, and one of the newspapers I contribute, Monty refers to his 1999 Brookline team-mate as Peter.\n\nPeter Lawrie is the Irish-born European Tour golfer who captured the 2008 Spanish Open.\n\nThe howler is repeated on at least five occasions in the book that was ­published last month.\n\nOn page 133, in a reference to Lawrie’s dramatic British Open win in 1999 at Carnoustie, Montgomerie boasts: “Mind you, there was one thing I could have not got more right.\n\n“I predicted very early on the Sunday that Peter Lawrie would win the Claret Jug.”\n\nIt was wrong again in a ­section on his own career ­statistics at the back of the book.\n\nLogging his successes as a player, he refers to his Ryder Cup partner in 1999 again as Peter Lawrie and not Paul.\n\nThe Sunday Mail indicate publishers Orion were unavailable for comment ­yesterday.\n\nMontgomerie’s management company, London-based IMG, were also unavailable."
