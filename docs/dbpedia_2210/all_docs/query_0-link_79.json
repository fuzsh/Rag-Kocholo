        "text": "It’s golf week (plus a few days) in North-east Scotland from 16-23 June 2018 with not one, but two major golfing tournaments taking place on our soil. The schedule will commence with the ASI Scottish Par 3 Championship from 14-15 June at local Aberdonian Paul Lawrie’s own golf course. Followed very closely by The Amateur Championship from 16-23 June at Royal Aberdeen Golf Club and Murcar Links Golf Club.\n\nHere’s five things you should know before you visit:\n\n1. Golf was born here\n\nScotland is the birthplace and home of golf. Today it is known to have some of the most prestigious golf courses in the world. Golf may well have started in North-east Scotland, as the first ancient mention of the sport was in 1625 at the Links of Aberdeen. Step back in time when you visit Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire to play golf as it was always intended.\n\n2. Courses for champions\n\nIn this part of Scotland you’ll find some of the world’s oldest and most challenging golf courses. The Amateur starts at Murcar Links – originally designed by local legend Archie Simpson and later revised by renowned golf architect James Braid. Royal Aberdeen, the host of the final of the competition, is the 6th oldest golf club in the world, founded in 1780, it was even given the ‘Royal’ designation by Edward VII in 1903. Head a little further inland to one of our newest Championship courses in majestic Royal Deeside. And as the name suggests, the nine-hole Paul Lawrie Golf Centre and host of the ASI Scottish Par 3, is owned by former Open champion and Ryder Cup player, Paul Lawrie.\n\n3. Cheering doesn’t cost a thing\n\nYou can attend both of these major golf tournaments for free. So get ready to join the crowds as you cheer on some of the best Scottish and international PGA professionals as well as Paul Lawrie and Michael Campbell at the ASI Scottish Par 3. Show your support for the 288 up-and-coming golfers playing at the Amateur. You don’t have to be a professional golfer to appreciate the skill of these contestants!\n\n4. You can play long in to the evening\n\nSummer days this far north are long, in fact, near endless. So no matter how packed your day, there will still be time to get out on the course first thing in the morning or late at night. Here is a preview of what to expect when you tee off from one of our links or parkland courses:\n\n5. You will also have the chance to sample our produce\n\nAs if seeing world-class and emerging golf professionals live wasn’t enough, you can also indulge in our famous local food and drink. Kick start your day with a full Scottish breakfast (black pudding and tattie scone included) or try one of our local delicacies, the rowie/buttery. Enjoy freshly caught seafood at a fine dining restaurant at the beach or in the city centre or tuck into Aberdeen Angus beef at restaurants throughout the region. Make sure to sample our ‘water of life’ at one of our eight whisky distilleries, traditional whisky bars or snugs. And enjoy a locally produced BrewDog beer at the central flagship bar!"
