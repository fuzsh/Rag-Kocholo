        "text": "SCOTS Golf ace Paul Lawrie has put his luxury mansion complete with its own ‘mini golf course’ up for sale for more than £2.2 million.\n\nThe former Open champion is selling the stunning property in Aberdeen and it could be a dream home for sports fanatics.\n\nAs well as a five bedroom Victorian villa, the home comes with a US Golf Association standard chipping and putting green with a bunker in its three acres of grounds.\n\nThere is also a small fairway and two driving range nets for those who want to practice their swing in the comfort of their own backyard.\n\nRoyal Aberdeen Golf Club votes to allow women members after 238 years\n\nThe house is also kitted out with a gym and a games room with full-sized snooker table.\n\nLawrie, 49, snapped up the house in his home city for £855,000 shortly after winning the Open at Carnoustie in 1999 - the biggest victory of his career.\n\nIt has now been put on the market for offers over £2.2 million after he and his wife Marian moved to another property nearby.\n\nThe Ryder Cup star revealed last year that he thought the baronial-style home was haunted after spotting a ghost in his bedroom.\n\nWhen an interviewer asked if he was more scared of bees or ghosts, he replied: “Ghosts, 100 per cent - because I’ve seen one.\n\n“I have one in my house and I saw it one night and man, it’s not a good feeling. I wouldn’t recommend it.\n\nThe 5,000 sq ft home in the city’s upmarket Bieldside area also features a library, a conservatory and a self contained cottage.\n\nEstate agents Savills say the home’s ‘amazing mini golf course’ makes it one of the ‘star properties’ currently on the market.\n\nA sales brochure states: “Magnificent detached late Victorian villa in about 3 acres, with garages, gymnasium, self contained cottage & USGA specification practice chipping green and fairway.\n\n“An imposing detached Scot baronial house with pitch slate roofs complete with picturesque tower. Reflecting the era of the house, many examples of the period style are still evident.\n\n“These features include high ceilings, deep skirting boards, ornate plasterwork, intricate picture rail friezes, panelled doors, column style radiators, brass power plates, open fireplaces, decorative fireplace surrounds, stained glass windows and an abundance of beautifully preserved oak woodwork, including parquet flooring and staircases.\n\n“There is the perfect balance of old meets new which is complemented by a luxury, modern dining kitchen, contemporary luxury shower rooms and a wonderful conservatory.”"
