        "text": "Join a Discussion on Golf\n\nBy CLIFTON BROWN\n\nARNOUSTIE, Scotland -- It was an astonishing victory, made possible by a horrific collapse.\n\nThe unlikely winner of the British Open today was Paul Lawrie of Scotland, who started the day 10 strokes off the lead, but pulled off the greatest final-round comeback ever in a major championship. The loser was Jean Van de Velde of France, who started the day with a five-stroke lead, and who had the tournament virtually won before he experienced every athlete's worst nightmare. He succumbed to the pressure.\n\nAssociated Press Paul Lawrie took home the claret jug that had Jean Van de Velde's name engraved on it.\n\nLeading by three strokes as he reached the par-4, 18th hole, Van de Velde did the unfathomable. He triple-bogeyed. He hit bad shots. He made terrible decisions. And he allowed what should have been the greatest moment of his career to become the worst.\n\nVan de Velde's collapse at No. 18 led to a four-hole, three-man playoff that included Lawrie and Justin Leonard, who nearly won his second British Open in three years.\n\nWith the Scottish gallery cheering on its 30-year-old native son, Lawrie birdied the final two playoff holes, sending Scotland into celebration, and ending a bizarre, exciting and unpredictable week that added to the legend of Carnoustie.\n\nShooting even par (17) during the four pressure-packed playoff holes, Lawrie prevailed by three strokes over Leonard and a heartbroken Van de Velde, who tied for second.\n\nAll three players had finished at six-over-par 290 for 72 holes, the tournament's highest winning score since Sam Snead won with a 290 at St. Andrews in 1946. It was the first major championship for Lawrie, who shot a brilliant final-round four-under-par 67, and who became the first Scottish player to win the British Open since Sandy Lyle in 1985.\n\nLawrie's comeback from 10 strokes down was the biggest swing in the final day of a major since Jackie Burke Jr. won the 1956 Masters, coming from eight strokes down to defeat Ken Venturi, an amateur, by one shot.\n\nThe tournament officials had engraved Van de Velde's name on the championship trophy, then had to scrape it off.\n\nThis tournament will be remembered most for the way Van de Velde self-destructed at No. 18. A bogey would have been wonderful. A double-bogey would have worked. But a triple-bogey was shocking. And while he smiled on the outside and bravely answered questions when it was over, there was pain in his voice..\n\n\"Maybe next time I'll be better able to handle the pressure,\" said Van de Velde, who has not won a tournament since 1993 and who had never been in contention before at a major. \"It's difficult, but there are worse things in life.\"\n\nYet for many years, Van de Velde will replay No. 18 repeatedly in his mind, and he should have played it differently. Leonard and Lawrie were already in the clubhouse at six over par. Van de Velde was at three over par, needing only a six or better on the par-4, 487-yard hole to win.\n\nBut Van de Velde was shaking, and it showed. His tee shot drifted more than 20 yards right of the fairway, yet he got a break when the ball sailed over the water in Barry Burn and landed safely on dry ground, sitting up on low rough.\n\nAt this point, Van de Velde made a crucial strategic error. He could have safely taken a wedge and chipped back into the fairway, then hit an approach shot onto the green, followed by two putts for the championship.\n\nAgence France-Presse Jean Van de Velde at No. 18.\n\nInstead, he went for the green with a 2-iron. \"I only had 185 yards to carry the water,\" Van de Velde said. \"The ball was lying so good. Maybe I should have hit a wedge. Next time I hit a wedge, O.K.?\"\n\nVan de Velde's 2-iron sailed wildly right, hit the grandstand in front of the creek, then ricocheted backward about 25 feet into knee-high rough. Now Van de Velde had real problems. He still had not cleared the water, and his ball was buried terribly, limiting the option of pitching into the fairway with his next shot.\n\n\"I couldn't go backward,\" Van de Velde said. \"The only thing I could do was try to go forward. I had to hit it hard. Obviously, I didn't hit it hard enough.\"\n\nAs the gallery gasped in horror, Van de Velde's next shot flew weakly out of the deep rough and landed in the water. It was now clear he could lose the tournament. Leonard rushed to the driving range to warm up for a possible playoff. And Lawrie, who had been in the clubhouse for more than 90 minutes, realized that he could still win as well.\n\n\"I saw him hit the grandstand, then chip in the water,\" Lawrie said. \"Your mind is racing. You don't know what to think. Obviously, Jean had the tournament in his pocket. He chips it on the 18th fairway, hits the green, makes five, he's the Open champion. I'm not here to criticize him. I feel sorry for him. He really should have won. Thankfully for me, he didn't.\"\n\nVan de Velde had to scramble just to make the playoff. With his third shot at No. 18 in the water, he had two options. He could either take a penalty stroke and a drop, or avoid the penalty stroke and play the ball from the water. As the crowd roared, Van de Velde removed his shoes and socks, raised his pants legs over his knees and climbed into the water.\n\nIt was a remarkable scene, with photographers climbing down the creek bank trying to take pictures, and marshals trying to control a huge crowd that had stormed the 18th fairway.\n\nReuters Justin Leonard nearly won his second British Open in three years.\n\nVan de Velde seriously considered trying to hit a 60-yard pitch shot from the water onto the green, but as he stepped into the water, his ball sank lower. \"I could see the ball sinking, telling me, 'Hey you silly man,' \" Van de Velde said. \"The ball was underneath the water 2 inches. There was no hope.\"\n\nVan de Velde was forced to take his drop and penalty stroke, once again in deep rough about 60 yards from the pin. His pitch shot cleared the water, but it landed in the front green-side bunker. If Van de Velde failed to get up and down from there, he knew he would not even make the playoff. But he hit a nice bunker shot from about 25 feet that rolled 6 feet past the cup, then made the pressure putt to secure his spot in the playoff.\n\nAll three players started the playoff poorly at No. 15, hitting drives left of the fairway. Van de Velde's was the worst, and he hit a provisional second tee shot in case his first shot could not be found. The ball was located, but Van de Velde made a double-bogey, while Leonard and Lawrie bogeyed.\n\nThen Lawrie took the lead for good at the difficult 17th hole, hitting a beautiful 4-iron from 225 yards that landed about 25 feet left of the pin. Lawrie made the putt for birdie to take a one-stroke lead, and Van de Velde also made a 26-foot birdie putt at No. 17, tying him with Leonard, one stroke behind Lawrie as they went to No. 18.\n\nThen Lawrie clinched the title. His drive was in the middle of the fairway, as was Leonard's. But knowing he probably needed a birdie to keep the tournament going, Leonard went for the green on his next shot, but it was short and sailed into the water. Van de Velde's second shot was short of the water, then Lawrie ended the suspense with another terrific 4-iron from 221 yards that stopped 3 feet from the pin.\n\nAs Lawrie walked to the 18th green, his supporters shook the grandstand with noise. After Leonard and Lawrie both bogeyed, Lawrie sank the clinching birdie putt, and the fabled claret jug given to the winner belonged to him.\n\nLeonard, who won the British Open in 1997 at Royal Troon, will regret not having played better in the playoff. And he also hit into the water twice for two bogeys at No. 18 -- once in regulation, and once in the playoff. But Leonard knew his heartache could not compare with Van de Velde's.\n\n\"I basically lost the British Open twice in one day, which is maybe twice as hard to take,\" said Leonard, who scrambled to a final-round 72 today. \"As bad as I feel, Jean feels worse, to have a lead on that hole and not be able to win. It had to be a sick feeling for him, in the playoff as well.\"\n\nVan de Velde hoped that one day he would be in position to win a major again. But at least tonight he could still find something to laugh about. \"I made plenty of friends, because a Scottish man won,\" Van de Velde said. \"At least that's something.\""
