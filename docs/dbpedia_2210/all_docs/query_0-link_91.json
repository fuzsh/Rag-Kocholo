        "text": "LIKE every mission control centre should, Paul Lawrie’s newly-refurbished practice bay has all the mod cons and comforts he could need.\n\nThere’s a state-of-the-art Trackman system that provides information about his ball flight, swing speed and video analysis. There’s also a putting green, a fridge and comfy chair in which to enjoy his secret stash of shortbread.\n\nBut the most significant thing in his new bay at the Paul Lawrie Golf Centre on the edge of Aberdeen can be found inside two small frames.\n\nOne picture of his family and another of him and his friend and former coach, Adam Hunter.\n\nIt’s three years since Hunter died after a brave battle against leukaemia but his influence on Lawrie remains.\n\nSo as the 1999 Open champ strives to revive his game after a disappointing 2014 season that saw him slip to his current world ranking of 284th, he draws on the words of straight-talking Hunter to inspire him to get back to the top.\n\nHe’s done it before. In 2010 he was in a similar low ranking when he took up an offer from Sky to commentate on the Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor.\n\nOn returning, he visited Hunter in hospital and was savaged by his pal, despite his weakened state, for taking a role that suggested he had accepted his career was winding down.\n\nJolted back into action, Lawrie doubled his efforts and recorded a stellar 2012 season to earn his place in the next Ryder Cup side. Now in the week that most of his former team-mates are in Dubai battling for mega money, Lawrie is in Aberdeen working hard in his new practice bay to plot his return among the big boys.\n\nHe said: “The new bay’s fantastic. It’s just finished but there’s only going to be a couple of pictures in there.\n\n“There’s a picture of the four of us – me, Marian and the kids – and one of Adam and I when he gave me a hug at The Open.\n\n“That was the moment and the person that made me the golfer I am and looking at it just makes me wants to hit balls and keep going.\n\n“I remember going to see Adam in hospital and he had tubes coming out of him and was having a real go at me for doing the Ryder Cup commentary at Celtic Manor.\n\n“I was out of shape and not practising hard enough. You need someone like that now and again to tell you get the work done and stop moaning.\n\n“Everyone has moments they get down on themselves and I’m the same. It doesn’t last long but it is hard to be positive when you are coming off the back of just 16 events and finishing 117th in the Order of Merit.\n\n“But those are the moments that Adam’s picture is there for. It makes me get up off my backside and hit more balls. I’m ready to get going.”\n\nLawrie’s commitment to giving something back to the game can make it harder to practise as much as he wants. But the demands of his junior golf foundation, his golf centre and a number of events he sponsors on the men’s and ladies’ Tartan Tours just got bigger.\n\nLast week he launched the Paul Lawrie Saltire Energy Matchplay, which will provide an interesting new dimension to the European Tour schedule next July at Murcar Links.\n\nGetting this new event off the ground will put more demands on his time but the 45-year-old isn’t ready to ease up on his playing schedule.\n\nHe added: “Bernhard Langer and Miguel Angel Jimenez are an inspiration that you can still be competitive with the young guys.\n\n“I’d like to play in one more Ryder Cup team. I feel I’ve got that in me.\n\n“This year I went to Gleneagles on the Saturday. I had never been a spectator before and I hated it.\n\n“The good thing is I went home and hit more balls and went into the gym more.”"
