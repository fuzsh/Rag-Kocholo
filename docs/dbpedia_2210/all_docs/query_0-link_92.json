        "text": "At last night’s 24th Annual Dinner for the Scottish Region of the PGA Paul Lawrie received three awards from PGA Captain Alan Walker. The awards, normally presented at the Volvo PGA Championship at Wentworth in May, all arose from Paul Lawrie’s Open Championship victory at Carnoustie last year.\n\nThe Ryle Memorial Medal is only awarded when a PGA member wins The Open and was last presented to Nick Faldo in 1992. The Braid-Taylor Memorial Medal is awarded\n\nto the PGA member who finishes highest in The Open Championship and The Tooting Bec Cup (it is actually a medal, despite its name) goes to the PGA member who returns the lowest single round score in The Open. Paul Lawrie’s 67 on the final day at Carnoustie secured him this award."
