        "text": "\"We are here for the golfers, and without them, there is no golf club. That is our main driver for using feedback\". - shares Anna Wickberg, Golf Club Manager at Idrefj√§llens Golfklubb. Effective teamwork and the use of feedback have greatly facilitated her role as a Golf Club Manager. üìä Wickberg considers it crucial to provide data-driven arguments when suggesting potential improvements to the golf course and presenting these proposals to the Board or other club decision-makers. And the Players 1st Surveys offers exactly that: Clear, documented insights into what golfers enjoy and dislike. #sverige #customerexperiencemanagement #golfindustry #growthegame\n\nIn this video I share what TOP PROFESSIONALS actually do to shallow the golf club, and how this can help you. You don't need big fancy moves to shallow the club or be blessed with an incredible physique. In actual fact, if you can get the club in an appropriate position in the backswing, it makes shallowing the club very simple.\n\nLIV Golf has recently taken a significant step forward by securing its first major TV deals, marking a significant milestone for the new tour. This strategic move positions them strongly on the global golf stage and provides them with the opportunity to reach a broader audience through various TV platforms. Simultaneously, the PGA TOUR and DP World Tour have intensified their efforts to compete and maintain their positions as leaders in the golf world. By constantly evolving their events and adapting to changes in the industry, they aim to retain and attract new fans. The ongoing efforts of these major players in the golf sphere create an exciting dynamic within the industry. Notably, this development has also strengthened the position of players in the golf landscape. As the competition between these entities heats up, players may find themselves in a more advantageous position, with increased opportunities and support in the ever-evolving world of professional golf. #sportbusiness #golf\n\nü•≥ Company Events: We believe in the power of camaraderie.

With the Solheim and Ryder Cups coming up, we were thinking about our first Gather White Paper which looked into golf's reliance on avid and core golfers. These two showcase events bring a partisan crowd to golf and can help bring new fans into our sport. The question is, how do we capitalise on this? #GatherInsights https://lnkd.in/e_RH-xcQ\n\nWant to know about the golfparticipation in your country?

There are other ways that can lead to to the dreaded top, check this video out to see what are tend to see in the coaching bay! #golfclinic #golf #golftop #golfcoach #livelesson #benemersongolf\n\nThe long-awaited 44th edition of the biennial Ryder Cup returns to Europe (Sept. 29 to Sunday, Oct. 1) at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Rome, Italy. Founded in 1927 as a match-play tournament between the US and Great Britain, the competition pits the best golfers from the United States against their European counterparts in a pressure-cooker format. It‚Äôs a master class in course and team management, strategy, tactics, gamesmanship‚Äîand mind games‚Äîwhere fervent fans cheer bad shots and missed putts. Although the United States leads the series 27-14, the era of American domination is long past. In fact, the US team hasn‚Äôt won on European soil in 25 years. Pressure? Yes, indeed. That‚Äôs the opposite of this matchup of six international homes (three in the United States and three in Europe) that offer world-class golf just steps from the fairways‚Äîwith all the creature comforts of home."
