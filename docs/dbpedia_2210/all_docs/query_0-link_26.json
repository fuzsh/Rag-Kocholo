        "text": "Paul Lawrie's famous victory at The Open over 20 years ago still lives long in the memory.\n\nLifting a major golf title, arguably the most famous of all, was the Aberdonian's finest hour in the game.\n\nDespite his best efforts, however, Lawrie never came close to winning another major honour.\n\nREAD MORE: Golf heroes heading to Donald Trump's Aberdeenshire course for Legends Tour event\n\nThe 2023 Masters Tournament, America's premier major tournament, is back on Thursday, April 6 at the world-famous Augusta National.\n\nFor all Lawrie was never able to replicate his success on home soil, his Masters record is respectable.\n\nLawrie played in seven Masters tournaments between 2000 and 2013. During that period, he made the cut on four occasions.\n\nFresh off his maiden major triumph, Lawrie would have been hoping to make an impression when he stepped on the greens at Augusta for the first time in 2000.\n\nLike many before him and many after, it wasn't the start he was hoping for.\n\nLawrie failed to make the cut at the new millennium event which was won by Vijay Singh.\n\nAnd for the next two years after, missed cuts would follow.\n\nIn 2003, however, the tide would turn - even as the heavens opened.\n\nPlay was cancelled on the traditional Thursday start so the first and second rounds began on Friday.\n\nLawrie performed impressively during difficult conditions, scoring two rounds of 72 to keep him even par and tied for fifth heading into the third round.\n\nOn Saturday morning, \"moving day\" lived up to its name and the leaderboard quickly changed.\n\nLawrie returned two scores of one-over-par for the final two days which left him tied for 15th.\n\nHe finished two-over-par alongside a certain Tiger Woods.\n\nThat was to be Lawrie's highest-ever finish at the Masters but he again made the cut in the 2004 event, won by Phil Mickelson, with the Aberdonian finishing tied 37th with fellow Scot and Masters winner Sandy Lyle.\n\nFrom 2005 until 2011, Lawrie didn't play in the Masters until 2012 after climbing back into the top 50 rankings.\n\nAnd he brought some Granite City gold dust to Augusta with a stunning opening round of 69, including breaking his eagle duck.\n\nLawrie broke 70 for the first time and his three-under-par opener was only bettered by Lee Westwood, that year's runner-up Louis Oosthuizen and Peter Hanson.\n\nAlthough he made the cut, Lawrie's scores would slide and finished tied 24th on one-over-par.\n\nLawrie had hoped 2013 would be lucky number seven as he entered his last Masters to date.\n\nInjuries hampered his preparation but the Scot was still buoyed from his Ryder Cup victory with Europe from the previous year.\n\nAn opening round 76 got Lawrie off to a bad start but recovered well to make the cut and tie 38th.\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nAnthony Stewart makes MK Dons debut as Aberdeen defender faces his former club in heated derby clash\n\nAberdeen player ratings in 1-0 away win v St Johnstone as Kelle Roos puts in stellar showing\n\nBarry Robson hails Aberdeen's 'resilience' after away victory at St Johnstone\n\nGraeme Shinnie keeps lid on Aberdeen future as captain insists focus is on push for Europe"
