I am pushing the key straight down as always before turning it but still no luck. I have a 05 Busa. Anyone ever experienced this before?? Thanks for your support.\n\nSteve\n\naussiesuzukirider\n\nNever Forgotten\n\nAug 23, 2010\n\n#2\n\nSpray a bit of CRC in the hole I had this happen on my 750 and it freed it up\n\nMC MUSTANG\n\nPeace Keeper or Ban Hammer-it's up to you; IDMBT#9\n\nAug 23, 2010\n\n#3\n\nSee if you can push the bars as far left as they will go and try to turn the key...\n\nAug 24, 2010\n\n#4\n\nSee if you can push the bars as far left as they will go and try to turn the key...\n\nwiggle the handle bars as far as they can move both ways aswell\n\nSep 7, 2010\n\n#6\n\nalso pay close attention to the key, if you sat on it or anything and it got twisted just a LITTLE it will be a major pain. . Happened twice to me already and i don't even keep my keys in my back pocket lol"
