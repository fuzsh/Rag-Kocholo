        "text": "Almost half of the vehicles affected by the recalls are still on the road with the safety defect\n\nOctober 22, 2014 - Ottawa, Ontario - Transport Canada\n\nTransport Canada today reminds owners of General Motors (GM) vehicles affected by the recall of ignition switches to take their vehicles into GM dealers for repairs as soon as possible.\n\nGM recalled 368,073 vehicles in Canada last winter due to a risk that the ignition switch may move out of the \"run\" position, resulting in a partial loss of electrical power and turning off the engine. In the event of a crash, air bags may not deploy if the ignition switch is not in the “run” position, increasing the risk of injury.\n\nThe department notes that GM has contacted owners of the affected vehicles, including sending re-notification letters to owners in many cases. Despite notification efforts, as of October 16, 2014, there were still 168,026 vehicles on Canadian roads with this safety defect. This represents 45.6% of the affected vehicles in Canada.\n\nUntil the ignition recall repairs have been performed, it is very important that all items from the key ring be removed, as the risk is increased when it is carrying added weight. The key fob (if applicable) should also be removed from the key ring.\n\nOwners of potentially affected vehicles should visit the GM website (https://recalls.gm.com/#/) and enter their Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to determine whether their particular vehicle has been recalled for the problem. The vehicle’s VIN can be found on top of the dashboard near the windshield, and also on the certification label located on the door latch post next to the driver’s seating position.\n\nFor more information on Transport Canada’s Defect Investigations and Recalls Division, please visit www.tc.gc.ca/recalls or call 1-800-333-0510.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nAs of October 16, 2014, 168,026 of the 368,073 affected Canadian vehicles had not been repaired.\n\nThe ignition switch may move out of the \"run\" position, resulting in a partial loss of electrical power and turning off the engine. Air bags may not deploy if the ignition switch is not in the “run\" position.\n\nA list of the GM vehicles that have been recalled for the ignition switch/cylinder defect can be found on the GM Ignition recall website: http://www.gmignitionupdate.com/canada/en/?adv=142761.\n\nBuyers of new or used vehicles can consult TC’s website at www.tc.gc.ca/recalls to verify if their vehicle is affected by a recall.\n\nRoad safety is a shared responsibility involving governments, vehicle manufacturers, and the public. Vehicle owners must act on the recall notices received, so as to safeguard themselves, their passengers, as well as pedestrians and the occupants of other vehicles. Please refer to the following web-page entitled “The Importance of Having Recalled Vehicles Repaired”: http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/motorvehiclesafety/tp-tp14665-v201101-1152.htm\n\nContacts\n\nMedia Relations\n\nTransport Canada, Ottawa\n\n613-993-0055\n\nTransport Canada is online at www.tc.gc.ca.
