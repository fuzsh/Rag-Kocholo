        "text": "Registered\n\nJoin Date: Nov 2014\n\nPosts: 155\n\nIgnition Switch / Dash wiring questions\n\nHello,\n\nThe car is a 1979 911 SC that I bought as a rolling chassis. I'm beginning to test the electrical in preparation to install the rebuilt engine. Currently, I have a few questions:\n\n1) There were three of five 6 pin plugs that weren't plugged behind the ignition switch. One comes out of the ignition switch and it was easy to match since it only has 5 of 6 pins. Can anyone help with the other two? See pictures (these are looking up). Looks like one is from the hazard switch (I think this one should plug next to the headlight switch) and the other comes from the passenger side of the dash (but have not traced it back because it goes up behind the dash). I took a look at the wiring diagram for the 1978 911SC on pelican but i couldn't locate the these connectors on the drawing.\n\n2) Also, pin #1 on the 14 pin engine connector is +12volts on \"acc\" or \"on\" ignitions positions instead of only during the \"start position\".. I also thought i could have had the wrong pin so i checked each of the 14 pins and none changed from 0v to 12v upon turning to the \"Start\" position.\n\n3) When reading current flow diagrams, is there a legend for the symbols used or any other helpful hints to better understand these?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nKelly\n\nRegistered\n\nJoin Date: Dec 2002\n\nLocation: So Cal and So Oregon\n\nPosts: 2,025\n\nFound this on another post.\n\n\"On my 75 911 the plugs go as follows. Starting on the top left w/top being towards windshield and left being towards drivers door #1 headlight switch #2 emergency flasher.\n\nNext row below -#1 ? #2 wiper switch #3 ignition switch. I did not mark #1 on the lower row, when reconnecting put the one that is left over here.\"\n\nPlease post if that works for you.\n\nRegistered\n\nJoin Date: Nov 2014\n\nPosts: 155\n\nThanks. Did it as above. More things worked as i plugged them in one at a time. However, there are still quite a few loose ends: power window switches getting hot but aren't working, lights aren't working (yet - gauge back lights come on and one of the parking lights sort of work, no blinkers), and seems the starting circuit isn't working correctly..\n\nI was hoping to find more \"formal\" information on these or more details for what these 5 plugs are for since there is always potential to melt down things when guessing. Does anyone know where you'd find info on which plugs go where or is it simply a wire tracing game?\n\nAlso, any help with #2 or #3 is appreciated.\n\nRegistered\n\nJoin Date: Dec 2002\n\nLocation: So Cal and So Oregon\n\nPosts: 2,025\n\nThat Ignition Switch one has most of the power going through it. It acts as the main power distribution switching. Power also goes from there to the Light Switch and from the light switch off to all the lights.\n\nHere are a few posts form when I redid my electrical scheme:\n\nunderstanding the ignition switch\n\nUnderstanding the Emergency Flasher Switch\n\nI can't help on 2 as I haven't worked wiring back there in the engine area. Although you might find a clue looking at my link regarding the Ignition Switch.\n\nPost pictures of the symbols you question and you will get answers. I am unaware of a legend.\n\nMike\n\nRegistered\n\nJoin Date: Dec 2002\n\nLocation: So Cal and So Oregon\n\nPosts: 2,025\n\nHey Dennis,\n\nNice find! By any chance, do you know the proper identification/function of the 5 bulkhead connectors under the dash by each location? It has come up in three posts very recently. I haven't come across this information and I think it would be nice to know. I figure if anyone would know it would be you. If not, then I might just unfasten my loom there and figure it out.\n\nMike\n\nRegistered\n\nJoin Date: Nov 2014\n\nPosts: 155\n\nUpdate on #2\n\nFurther troubleshooting on #2\n\n-previously, I was testing without having a \"coil\" or solenoid wired to the #1 on the 14 pin at the engine bay. I used a spare relay as a dummy starter solenoid and the voltage dropped down to 6volts in the \"on/run\" position. but I still think it should go to zero\n\n-I removed the ignition switch and pin 50 only had continuity during start position. Switch is good\n\n-I checked continuity on the plug for the ignition switch (with switch removed). And found continuity to the 30 pin. I believe this is incorrect\n\n-I began tracing backwards. Ignition switch plug to bulkhead was good. Remove some of the HVAC stuff in the luggage compartment to begin on the other side of the bulkhead. Found that there is one wire off of the main yellow line that is causing this problem. After removing it from the circuit, the #1 pin at the engine bay goes between 0v and 12v from run to start.\n\nNow, my problem is I can't figure out where this problem wire goes. It looks like it could be into the cruise control bundle but I'm not sure. The wire is pictured below - it is the smallest of the yellow wires. Any idea what this one is for and where it might go?"
