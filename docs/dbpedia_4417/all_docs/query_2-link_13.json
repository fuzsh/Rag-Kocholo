        "text": "Documentation is Not Action\n\nIn a public SEC filing dated Tuesday, June 3, 2008, a company's CEO referred to a document called \"Winning With Integrity: Our Values and Guidelines for Employee Conduct,\" which read like a proto-sustainability report. It covered the code of conduct in a plainspoken and straightforward manner, and included straightforward \"Do\" and \"Don't\" guidance. It was a powerfully worded piece, including passages such as:\n\nIt all comes down to personal responsibility–mine, yours, and all of ours–for the way we work and conduct ourselves as [company] employees. Winning with integrity requires a commitment by every member of the [company] team. I know I can count on all employees to do their part; you have my commitment to do the same. [...]\n\nThe Winning With Integrity guidelines are organized by major themes: Personal Integrity, Integrity in the Workplace, Integrity in the Marketplace, Integrity in Society and Our Communities, and Integrity Toward the Environment.\n\nIn a 19 page document, it would use the word \"integrity\" 67 times.\n\nIt is a document which addresses themes found in many Codes of Conduct as nested into sustainability reports. The language could come from almost any CSR of a major corporation, as it reflects many common themes, guidance items, and areas of emphasis. To put it bluntly, this document could be found within practically any Fortune 500 company. In this specific case, the company is General Motors.\n\nTwo years after this specific document was released, the death of a 29 year old woman related to a defective ignition switch and findings from the ensuing lawsuit would lead to one of the most visible product recalls in American history. As the recall, lawsuits, and congressional hearings would progress, reports of internal whistleblowers–in some cases years before–would begin to arise. In some of those cases, the whistleblowers were believed to have been either suppressed, ignored, or both.\n\nWe need look no further than some of the headlines over the last year to see some of the impacts of suppressing potentially negative information:\n\n\"GM Ignition Switch Death Claims Rise to 67\"\n\n\"GM Whistleblower was told to 'not find every problem,' report says\"\n\n\"GM Officials Ignored Alert on Car Stalling\"\n\n\"Just How Much Will the Recall Storm Cost GM?\"\n\n\"Attorney Says Legal Action Against GM will Continue\"\n\nWhile we may be making ourselves dizzy shaking our heads with righteous indignation at GM's failure to elevate the early signs of a major engineering flaw, we should each take a moment to introspect and be honest with ourselves:\n\nThis could happen anywhere.\n\nMaybe the scope and scale would be far smaller, maybe it wouldn't result in deaths, but these types of situations can happen anywhere. All it takes is one person or a very small group of people. Perhaps even more disconcerting is that the actor's position within the company doesn't matter: It could be a line worker not reporting a chemical-contaminated batch at a food processing facility out of fear for their job, it could be a product quality inspector overlooking flaws so that a time-crunched factory could meet its production targets, it could be a CEO hiding negative findings to elevate share value.\n\nConsider that if even five employees were directly complicit in the General Motors ignition issue, this would represent some 0.00024% of General Motors employees. Put in physical terms, if you were to fill the average bathtub with water, those employees would represent one fifth of one drop. Such is the potential toxicity of a tiny fraction of the whole.\n\nIn the efforts to encourage honest, and potentially anonymous whistleblowing, it is essential for one to realize that the goal is not to necessarily persuade or otherwise move masses of people, it is to provide the pathways and process to enable a single person to call attention to a dangerous situation they otherwise might not.\n\nHow Sustainability Relates to Whistleblower Protection and Anonymity\n\nWhile whistleblower protection may seem to be one very tactical concern in the very broad field of sustainability, consider the types of issues on which a whistleblower could report, and the direct impacts to sustainability aspects:\n\nWhistleblowers and sustainability Potential issue raised Sustainability aspect Financial fraud or misappropriation Profit: Overall health and financial viability of the organization Illegal disposal of chemicals Planet: Responsible disposal and use of hazardous materials Forced overtime and other improper labor practices People: Fair labor practices and working conditions Changes in important materials or safety specifications Planet: Potentially dangerous chemicals; People: Potentially unreported hazards to employees or customers Use of sweatshops or child labor People: Working conditions\n\nWhile some may consider whistleblower programs and measures to ensure anonymity as little more than an evolution of the trusty \"Comment Box,\" The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners offers an interesting forensic view on the importance and impacts of whistleblowers and programs designed to facilitate anonymous whistleblowing. Below are a few whistleblower related tables and commentaries from the 2014 version of their fascinating Report to the Nations on Occupational Fraud and Abuse:\n\nCredit: 2014 Report to the Nations on Occupational Fraud and Abuse. 2014 Global Fraud Study.

For example, in the performance review process, employees can be held accountable not only for meeting their goals and objectives but also for doing so in accordance with the stated values or business standards of the company.\n\nGet Endorsement From Top Management\n\nTop management, starting with the CEO, should demonstrate a strong commitment to encouraging whistleblowing. This message must be communicated by line managers at all levels, who are trained continuously in creating an open-door policy regarding employee complaints.\n\nPublicize the Organization's Commitment\n\nTo create a culture of openness and honesty, it is important that employees hear about the policy regularly. Top management should make every effort to talk about the commitment to ethical behavior in memos, newsletters, and speeches to company personnel. Publicly acknowledging and rewarding employees who pinpoint ethical issues is one way to send the message that management is serious about addressing issues before they become endemic.\n\nInvestigate and Follow Up\n\nManagers should be required to investigate all allegations promptly and thoroughly, and report the origins and the results of the investigation to a higher authority. For example, at IBM, a long-standing open-door policy requires that any complaint received must be investigated within a certain number of hours. Inaction is the best way to create cynicism about the seriousness of an organization's ethics policy.\n\nAssess the Organization's Internal Whistleblowing System\n\nFind out employees' opinions about the organization's culture vis-à-vis its commitment to ethics and values. For example, Sears conducts an annual employee survey related to ethics. Some questions are: Do you believe unethical issues are tolerated here? Do you know how to report an ethical issue?"
