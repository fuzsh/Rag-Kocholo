        "text": "I read your PM.... The powerpack and stator have nothing to do with the function of the ignition switch excepting the kill circuit (connection between the two \"M\" terminals) of the powerpack depending on the setting of the ignition switch.\n\nTo start with... make sure that the small RED wires at the starter solenoid are attached to the same large solenoid terminal that the RED positive battery cable is attached to. Is it? <-- Need an answer.\n\nI am under the impression that your problem is that although you're positive that you have the ignition switch wired properly, it WILL NOT engage the starter solenoid or crank the engine over which is of course needed in order to start and have the engine running. If this is not the case and the problem is of a different nature.... explain fully in detail with nothing lacking, NOT in generalities such as \"It's doing the same thing\" or something like \" the thing isn't working right\"... some boaters do that unintentionally of course BUT unless we're standing right there, it means nothing to us.\n\nNow.... The short 20 ampere power fuse is a inline fuse located in one of the smaller RED wires leading from the starter solenoid. Is this the one you're speaking of?... If so, there should be 12v at that fuse area to the RED wire on the other end of that fuse... is 12v present there? <--- Answer needed to all questions !!\n\nIf so far so good and 12v is present... you should have 12v present at the \"B\" terminal of the ignition switch... Do you?\n\nIn the ignition switch ON position, there should be 12v present at the \"B\" terminal, the \"A\" terminal, and the \"I\" terminal if the \"I:\" terminal exists... BUT if the \"I\" terminal exists, there should be NO wire(s) attached to it. Do you have 12v present at the \"B, A, & I\" terminals?\n\nIf still so far, so good, Now, with the ignition switch in the START position, you should still have 12v to the \"B, A, & I\" terminals... BUT... you should now have 12v to the \"S\" terminal of the ignition switch to which the \"White\" wire should be attached that leads to the \"Neutral Safety Switch\" AND there should be 12v in the white wire that leads from the Neutral Safety Switch that leads to the small 3/8\" nut terminal of the Starter Solenoid.\n\nWith the above information spelled out as simply as I possibly can, the 12v route and function of the ignition switch should be corrected. Let us know how it goes."
