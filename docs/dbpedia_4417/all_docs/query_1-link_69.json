        "text": "Generally a car type switch that cranks a starter, sends power to the starter relay from the relay to ground.\n\nOn the stock starter switch, push button, power is sent to the relay then the button grounds the circuit.\n\nAs far as wiring goes ignore the accessories position, one left click. Wire the main power out to the red wire of the harness.\n\nAt the starter relay unplug the red/white wire, hook the car switch output for the starter relay to the bike relay R/W wire. Unplug the blue/white wire and hook it to ground.\n\nLeo\n\nLeo, thanks a ton! I have the wiring all tore down and simplified according to one of the diagrams on this site. Everything is run from a panel that will be kept in the battery box. I need a little clarification on what you said.\n\n\"Leave the accessory post empty\" got it.\n\n\"Wire the main power out to the red wire in the harness\"\n\nHelp me out here.....\n\nThere is a main power that is black and goes directly from the battery to the starter relay and is a fairly heavy gauge, from there a red wire is spliced in and runs to the fuse box this wire is normal gauge. Another main power goes from the relay to starter also a heavy gauge.\n\nI am just not sure which one you are referring to when you say main power....?\n\nWill this kill all the power when the switch is in the off position?\n\nAttachments\n\nimage.jpg\n\nOk so after further investigation, I found that the red that comes off the main battery connection goes into the fuse box to a 20amp fuse then out to the on/off stock inanition key.\n\nSo the red wire that goes to the stock ignition key is the one I hook to the battery post on the new keyed ignition?\n\nThen there is a brown wire that runs from the stock ignition back to the all the reds and fuse box...... Should I hook this to the ignition post on the new ignition key?\n\nThen there is a blue wire on the stock ignition that runs to a black box........ not sure what to do with it?\n\nHook the red/white wire from the starter relay to the (st)start terminal?\n\nAnd hook the blue/white to the ground?\n\nAm I close?\n\nYes, the red wire to the stock switch goes to the BATT terminal on the new switch.\n\nYes, brown wire of harness goes to ignition terminal of new switch.\n\nThe blue wire on the stock switch feeds power to the tail light. Hook this to the ignition terminal. You want the tail light to light with key on.\n\nYes, red/white to start terminal, ground the blue/white.\n\nVery good.\n\nThis should get the new switch to work everything.\n\nLeo\n\nq1445,\n\nNot meaning to spoil your birthday, but the use of an automobile style ignition switch has come up before and there are a few issue when used on a motorcycle. The problem comes up when you start a left turn in front of an oncoming beer truck and the engine quits in the middle of the intersection. What to do?\n\n1. Use your left hand to operate the ign switch, but first you must put it in neutral. (don't forget!) The suggested mod will leave you without a clutch or neutral safety so you will probably start the engine in gear with just one hand on the handle bars and the bike will hurtle through the intersection, leaving you sitting on your butt on the hot pavement with the beer truck coming straight at you.\n\n2. Use your right hand to operate the ign switch, but that means starting without operating the throttle or the front brake.\n\n3. Be a hero and kick start the bike like a real man. (Don't forget the beer truck! )\n\n4. Drop the bike right there and take up a life of poetry and booze.\n\nI like #4.\n\nBooze allows you to transition through the \"zone of truth\". Your mind is all confused when you are sober. Prejudice, lack of confidence and ennui rule the sober mind.\n\nAs you consume booze, one after the other, you pass through the \"zone of truth\" where all mysteries are solved, all women are hot, and the skies are not cloudy all day.\n\nYou do your most imaginative work while in the zone of truth, but it is short lived, because the zone requires a continuous flow of booze to keep the lamps aglow, which soon dim as the flow drowns the flame of truth and beauty and all becomes blurry and uncertain, just as it is when you are sober.\n\nSo, be prepared...take notes and have lots of witnesses as you move rapidly through the zone, because it's truth is fleeting, and the fall is steep, and all those hot women will soon cool down, and the empties will rattle around the floor reminding you that the truth is a transient...\n\nPamcopete,\n\nThanks for the reply. These are all things that I have thought about. I come from the dirtbike world where there are no push button starts, at least on my bikes. One even being the old Yamaha 426 with the decompression lever (find neutral, find top dead center, pull lever, and kick it as hard as you can)\n\nMy question is:\n\n#1 why are you stalling your engine in a turn (clutch control) .....\n\n#2 why are you trying to beat at beer truck through an intersection with chopped XS650\n\nThis bike is going to be a slow roller, take no chances kind of bike.\n\nI am still not sure which side I will put the keyed switch on yet, there are cost and benefits either way. I still have the push button and switching a few wires is no big deal down the road if the key becomes too much of a hassle."
