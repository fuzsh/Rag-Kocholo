        "text": "Waveform notes\n\nIn this waveform we can observe the output voltage from the Crank Angle Sensor (shown in red) at the same time as monitoring the Ignition's Primary trace (shown in blue). The main reason for evaluating these two waveforms together is to identify the cause of any impending misfires at higher engine revs.\n\nThe picture shows the 'missing tooth' reference point and the primary induced voltage. The offset between these two points will vary between different vehicle manufacturers as the 'missing tooth' is not always in the same position.\n\nAs the engine speed is increased, the distance between the reference point and the induced voltage alters due to the engine's ignition timing advance. The gap in the red trace is due to the 'missing tooth' in the flywheel or reluctor and is used as a reference for the Electronic Control Module (ECM) to ascertain the engine's position. Some systems use one reference point per revolution while others use two. The trace from the crank sensor should maintain a constant voltage at a given engine speed, while the primary ignition trace shows the firing of the ignition circuit.\n\nShould the engine start to misfire at speed, ensure that the crank sensor signal is not breaking down: this may be seen as an intermittent trace or as a reduction in amplitude. If the CAS output remains constant, the primary picture may falter: this could be due to either a fault coil or amplifier."
