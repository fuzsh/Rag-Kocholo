        "text": "David Maloufâs Ransom and Stephan Frearsâ The Queen was a brand-new text pairing added to the study design in 2020. It is a unit with many nuances and intricacies to discuss, making it a perfect pairing to unpack in an essay topic breakdown!Â Â\n\nFor some context, backstory and a plot summary of both Ransom and The Queen, head to an earlier post Understanding Ransom and The Queen. This may help with your understanding of the essay prompt later in this post. And if you need a refresher on what the Comparative is, see our Ultimate Guide to VCEÂ Comparative.\n\nOverall, both Ransom and The Queen overlap fairly heavily in terms of key themes, ideas and messages. Even if you havenât watched The Queen or read Ransom yourself, the essay topic I have chosen can give you an idea of how to seamlessly integrate such thematic overlaps and similarities into your own writing, whilst also acknowledging the differences in both texts.\n\nBreaking Down the Prompt: THINK\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out inHow To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nThe Essay Prompt:\n\n'it is true that the gods made me a king, but they also made me a man, and mortal.' â Priam (87-88)\n\n'Your Majesty, thereâs a last minute addition from Downing Street. Theyâre suggesting adding and as a grandmother here.' â Janvrin (Script, 87th Minute)\n\nHow do both texts explore the tensions that are created between a personâs public and private life?Â\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: AnalyseÂ\n\nThis prompt is both a quote-based, and a how-based prompt (learn more about the five types of prompts here). This means that the examiner wants us to explain how the text creators (Frears and Malouf) convey tensions between oneâs public and private life, using the quote to help us do so.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nFirst, letâs break down the prompt part of the essay question. Here, the keywords are:\n\nâtensionsâ - we have to focus on the contrast, and the hardships, that stem from the characters in both texts as they juggle their roles as leaders and individuals of their own accord. These difficulties are explored in more detail in an earlier LSG blog Ransom and The Queen.\n\nâpublic and private livesâ - invites us to consider the individuals in both texts, specifically leaders such as Queen Elizabeth and Priam, who have distinctly different public and private personas. Specifically, we want to focus on how the differences that arise between these two âlivesâ suggest that compromises must be made in order for leaders to perform their role to its greatest potential.\n\nNow itâs time to break down the quote itself!\n\nBoth the quotes from Ransom and The Queen illustrate points of tension in the lives of leaders.Â Â\n\nPriamâs quote occurs toward the climax of Ransom. The examiner is directing you to discuss how being âa manâ, and therefore seemingly unremarkable in nature, challenges Priamâs existence as a âkingâ, thus creating a point of tension in his reign.\n\nSimilarly, Janvrinâs quote also highlights how being a âgrandmotherâ is a role that must be performed by Queen Elizabeth in conjunction with her existence as the Queen of England. Yet, the inclusion of âDowning Streetâ in this quote also moves you to consider how the queenâs own private affairs, such as Dianaâs death, must be handled in conjunction with an outside team such as Tony Blair as British Prime Minister, thus entangling both her public and private personas.\n\nThrough both quotes, it is evident that when responding to how Frears and Malouf explore tensions in their respective texts, you should analyse the key characters of each text and their roles as both leaders and individuals in their own right.Â\n\nIâve grouped my ideas in a logical order so you can easily identify how each idea relates to my essay plan in Section C. During your own brainstorming, this will be difficult to achieve, so just keep in mind that you donât need a logical layout of ideas until the planning stage!\n\nAt the beginning of both texts, each protagonist fails to recognise and adequately perform their role as a âmanâ and âgrandmotherâ respectively, due to their duties as a leader. This leaves them out-of-touch with the people around them, suggesting that being a leader can negatively impact oneâs relationships with those they care about most.\n\nPriam refers to himself as âmortalâ in the prompt, revealing his own vulnerability. Furthermore, the inclusion of âDowning Streetâ encourages discussion surrounding Tony Blair and his role as a public figure. In both cases, these men express their emotions to their people and those closest to them, leaving them open to backlash and criticism of their authority as leaders.\n\nFor Queen Elizabeth, expressing her grief âas a grandmotherâ allows her to connect emotionally to her people and regain their support, whilst for Priam, appearing to Achilles simply as âa manâ enables him to return to Troy both successful in his mission and respected by his people. This reveals that leaders should not let their public and private lives evoke tension, but rather should harness elements of each respective realm to build a modern, effective and relatable leadership style.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nBy dissecting the promptâs keywords and briefly analysing the quote and its meaning, I have come up with three main points:\n\nParagraph 1: In both texts, Frears and Malouf suggest that in allowing themselves to be controlled by their public personas, leaders may struggle to connect with both their people and their own families\n\nRansom: Somax is initially unable to connect with Priam due to his adherence to royal protocol and tradition\n\nThe Queen: Queen is unable to provide emotional support to her grandsons following their motherâs death, due to her own stoicism and emotionally distant natureÂ\n\nParagraph 2: Yet, in revealing an aspect of their personal lives, leaders risk compromising their public authority\n\nRansom: When Priam breaks protocol and leaves the walls of Troy, the Trojan people question the strength and competence of their leader\n\nThe Queen: Tony Blairâs unconventional style means he initially fails to gain respect from the Royal Family, despite being elected British Prime Minister\n\nParagraph 3: This delicate balance between oneâs public and private lives is achieved most successfully when leaders reveal an element of their private selves and make themselves vulnerable and relatable to their people.\n\nRansom: Priam recognises the importance of being a father as well as a leader, allowing him to bury Hectorâs body whilst retaining respect and admiration from his people\n\nThe Queen: By adopting Blairâs suggestions and addressing the British people in an honest, vulnerable way, Queen Elizabeth is able to regain their trust and respect.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nEssay\n\nStephen Frearsâ film The Queen, set in contemporary England, and David Maloufâs novel Ransom, taking place in Ancient Greece, both explore the concept that oneâs public identity can create tensions between their ceremonial constructed persona, and their own private identities. In both texts, Frears and Malouf (1) suggest that in allowing themselves to be controlled by their public personas, leaders may struggle to connect with their people, and their own families. Yet, in revealing an aspect of their own lives, they may also risk compromising their own public authority. This delicate balance between oneâs public and private lives, therefore, is conveyed throughout Ransom and The Queen to be achieved most successfully when leaders reveal an element of their private lives and make themselves both vulnerable and relatable to their people, harnessing aspects of both their public and private lives in order to confidently perform their roles to the greatest extent possible. (2)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(1) Make sure to refer to the author/director in your introduction and continually throughout your essay. This helps to ensure you are considering their purpose and its intended effect/message to the audience (see Views and Values for more on this).\n\n(2) This is where I have included the broader implications of the topic â it will be my final paragraph where I somewhat challenge the prompt\n\nIn both Ransom and The Queen, leaders that allow themselves to be dictated by their public identities and subsequent rules, protocols and expectations, are portrayed to express difficulty in connecting with their constituents and their own families. In The Queen, Queen Elizabeth finds comfort in placing 'duty first, self second', as in performing in her role as a monarch for many years, she foregrounds such identity over her ability to connect personally with those around her. However, this struggle to formulate intimate connections is conveyed by Frears (3) to, at times, be at her detriment. Upon meeting the Royal Family, Cherie Blair, who symbolises the wider British society (4), describes that family as 'a bunch of free loading, emotionally retarded nutters'. This blunt description serves to indicate that in acting according to 'how [she] was brought up' and 'all [sheâs] ever known', the queen compromises her public image and relatability to her people. In a similar manner, in Ransom, Somax describes only having 'seen King Priam at a distanceâ¦he is surprised at how old he looks', clearly illustrating the emotional and physical distance between the king and the people of Troy. Such distance is portrayed by Malouf to not only affect the way the people view their king, but also the manner in which Priam himself is able to formulate and express basic human emotions, as 'royal custom â the habit of averting his gaze', initially prevents him from connecting with Somax on a more intimate level. Through this, both Malouf and Frears highlight how, (5) in allowing themselves to be consumed by their roles as leaders, both Priam and Queen Elizabeth have sacrificed their ability to truly connect and engage with those around them, leaving them out-of-touch with the same people they govern. However, this lack of connection is also shown to extend to their families, as the queen is pictured by Frears to be physically disconnected with her own grandsons. Upon learning of Dianaâs death, Prince Charles is depicted delivering the news to his sons, whilst the queen watches on from the corridor, as Frears uses a mid-shot with the door frame obstructing the audienceâs view of Queen Elizabeth herself. This can be seen to symbolise (6) the âbarricadeâ between the queen and her own family, as her role as monarch separates her from those she loves. (7) In a similar manner, Priamâs only recollection of the birth of his son is 'recall[ing] a series of small squalling bundles', as his 'roleâ¦to hold myself apart in ceremonial stillness' directly prevents him from understanding, and becoming involved with his family, emotionally distancing himself from his own sons. Consequently, Frears and Malouf convey to their audience that the role of being a leader can negatively impact upon oneâs relationship with others, serving as a constant burden and barrier to achieving intimate emotional connections.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(3) In writing âconveyed by Frearsâ as opposed to âconveyedâ I am trying to demonstrate that I am aware the film is a construction made by a director (in this case Frears) for a purpose â he is trying to communicate with the audience through the actions of his characters. See LSGâs Views and Values blog post or How To Write A Killer Text Response (the Views and Values section) for more on this.\n\n(4) In this case, I am attempting to go âbeyondâ what is simply portrayed in this scene and incorporate the setting of the text â in this case, highlighting my awareness of the time and place in which the film is set (i.e. context). While aimed at Literature students, this blog on context is helpful as it walks you through some contextual aspects you should consider.Â\n\n(5) This is one of the main ways I would link my two ideas in Year 12, and draw âmini conclusionâ or a link (think of the TEEL structure) back to the topic. Yet, in beginning with âMalouf and Frearsâ, I am keeping the purpose of each text central to my link.\n\n(6) When using film techniques, try to analyse their meaning. Rather than simply stating âFrears uses a mid-shotâ, tell your assessor WHY he does this and what its intended effect is on the audience. This not only acts as a form of âtextual evidenceâ but also demonstrates your understanding of the text itself.\n\n(7) In this sentence, I have tried to draw connections between the physical world and the authorâs purpose in portraying the isolation of the British Royal family. Here, Iâm referring to the ideas, views and values of the author/director.\n\nOn the other hand, however, in revealing oneâs private life and expressing humility, leaders are also shown to risk their public authority. In Ransom, Priam becomes determined, following the death of Hector, to try 'something impossible. Something new' and allow for an element of vulnerability to be expressed, in order to successfully ransom his sonâs body. Such an unusual, unconventional method of leadership, however, is depicted to take the people of Troy by surprise, as they witness their leader dressed 'in plain white' (8), stripped of his former royal gown. Therefore, the Trojans, who 'crowd the ramparts of the city' and 'line the walls of Troy' each day, in an attempt to view and 'cheer' their leader, 'do not know how to react' upon viewing Priam in such a common, ignoble state, reconsidering the way in which they regard and respect him. In a similar manner, in The Queen, Tony Blair is a Prime Minister whose âunconventional' style of leadership is seen to initially unnerve the Royal family. Upon being elected, Blair is described in a montage scene (9) to be a 'wonderful new Prime Ministerâ¦a compassionate young manâ¦such a breath of fresh air', a different style of leader to previous Prime Ministers whom the queen previously worked with. The description of Blair as a 'compassionate young man' is significant as such compassion, combined with his youth, acts as a deterrent for the Royals in showing him respect as a leader, taken aback by his unusual views and values. Consequently, upon the death of Diana, although Blair attempts to advise Queen Elizabeth on behalf of the British People, Prince Phillip declares 'who does he think heâs talking to? Youâre the sovereign. The head of state. You donât get dictated to' clearly symbolising their lack of respect and willingness to consider Blairâs perspectives and ideas. In this way, Frears highlights how, in adopting an unconventional style of leadership, those in power may struggle to gain the respect of others around them, particularly their fellow leaders, with the Queen Motherâs statement of 'silly Mr Blair and his Cheshire cat grin' clearly portraying Tony Blairâs lack of authority within the Royal Family. Whilst, in Ransom, the people of Troy struggle to come to terms with Priamâs own change in his leadership style, wondering 'is the king deserting them?', those in The Queen are seen to accept Blairâs leadership style, evident through his 'landslide victory', as, unlike the people of Troy, they are seen to be open to a more progressive form of leadership. In both texts, however, Frears and Malouf demonstrate that leaders who illustrate an element of vulnerability, such as Priam and Tony Blair, may struggle asserting their authority over those with more traditional standards and views, such as the Trojan people and the Royal Family, and thus sacrifice an element of their public image and reputation.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(8) This is a brief quote â these are useful to âreplaceâ your own words. It ensures you are remaining relevant in your analysis (aka not going off track!!) and acts as a way to âshow offâ to your assessors that you know your text. However, as these quotes are so simple, I would rarely go into depth with my analysis of them â save this for your longer quotations.\n\n(9) Although naming the scene as a âmontageâ isnât entirely necessary in this case, it shows the assessor that you remember where this scene takes place and gives a bit of context, further achieving that first criterion.\n\nYet, both David Malouf and Stephen Frears examine the notion that in revealing an element of their private life and making themselves vulnerable, a leader may be able to become more relevant, thereby easing the tension between their public and private personas (10). In The Queen, Queen Elizabethâs adamant refusal to 'dance to their tune' and abide by the requests of her people leads her to proclaim 'I donât think I have ever been hated like that', with Frearsâ depiction of her crying outside Balmoral evident of her realisation that she needs to adapt to the 'changeâ¦shift in values' occurring among her constituents. This private expression of vulnerability by Elizabeth is the catalyst for her change in leadership style, with the setting of Balmoral itself, and subsequent events that take place there, symbolising the ability for leaders to harness an element of their personal lives and use it to adapt and connect with their people. In a similar manner, Priamâs declaration that coming to Achilles 'as a man of sorrow' gives him the 'chance to break free of the obligation of always being the hero' highlights Maloufâs view that, at times, leaders must 'break free' of the overwhelming 'obligation[s]' of their public life in order to achieve their objectives and desires within the private sphere. Priamâs realisation that the 'gods made meâ¦mortal' (11) and subsequent appearance as 'a man of sorrow' allow him to successfully bury the body of his son, as he places his identity as 'a man' at the forefront. Priamâs ability to use his emotion in order to fulfil the desires of both him, as 'a father', and the wider people of Troy in allowing their most esteemed warrior to receive a proper burial, is mirrored in The Queen, where Queen Elizabeth adopts the use of emotion to regain the respect of British society. In returning from Balmoral, the queen directly interacts with the people outside Buckingham Palace, with Frears using a long shot to capture the extremely large numbers that had gathered outside the palace gates to emphasise the scale of public sorrow occurring. The queenâs interaction with her people, combined with her public address 'as a grandmother' (12), symbolises the way in which she was able to harness her identity both 'as your queen, and as a grandmother' to appeal to her people, gain their respect, and successfully lead them through an unprecedented, tumultuous event, thus easing the strain between her public and private personas. Likewise, Priamâs claim 'that the gods made me a king, but also made me a man' (13) highlights that he too has developed an understanding that in order to lead most successfully, one must express an element of vulnerability and humility, allowing for the people to emotionally connect and relate to those whom they admire. Therefore, both Malouf and Frears highlight that expressing elements of their private lives through their public identities is a method most effective in gaining leaders the respect and admiration they crave, as those they lead are able to find an element of commonality and relatability within such esteemed individuals.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(10) Here is where I begin to go beyond simply the limitations or âobviousâ points made in the prompt and consider its wider implications. One strategy I used to help plan and write these paragraphs in Year 12 was to ask myself âWhy is this a topic? What is the author/director trying to tell me as a member of the audience?â It usually helps to closely consider the authorâs purpose, thus ensuring you achieve a coherent and comprehensive analysis.\n\n(11) Here, I am using part of the quote in the prompt to serve as evidence and back up my point regarding Priamâs combination of both his public and private identities. See How To Embed Quotes in Your Essay Like a Boss to learn how to seamlessly include quotes in your writing.Â\n\n(12) It is here where I have used the quote from the prompt to influence my reasoning and my overall argument.\n\n(13) Now I am moving on to explain the significance of the quote in the prompt.\n\nUltimately, both The Queen and Ransom explore the various tensions that can occur throughout the public and private lives of leaders, and their need to grapple with and understand such a concept in order to perform their duties most effectively. Whilst being constrained by oneâs public persona may create emotional distance between an individual and those around them, in revealing an element of vulnerability, both texts illustrate that leaders risk losing respect and authority within public society. However, Frears and Malouf suggest that despite the difficult balance between oneâs public and private lives, in order to lead most effectively, esteemed individuals should not allow each respective realm to create tension and unease, but rather harness elements of both their intimate and public personas in order to create a modern, effective and relatable leadership style (14).\n\nAnnotations\n\n(14) My final sentence aims to focus on the âbigger pictureâ.

Without being overly hyperbolic, here are a four essential tips that will ensure your assessor sees you as a high-scoring student right from your first sentence.\n\n- Answer the question in your first sentence (even if it is in a broad manner) and always link back to the essay topic â this will show the assessor that you are answering the question given rather than presenting them with a sneaky memorised essay!\n\n- Utilise the right terminology when outlining the type of poet and era they wrote in (i.e. metaphysical poet, Renaissance era, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth)\n\nâ\n\n- Outline the main poetic techniques for which the poet is known for (i.e. playful wit, rich imagery, language, challenging intellectual argument) as well as the ideas and values they endorse (i.e. elevation of reciprocal love, belief in the resurrection of Christ, celebration of eternal life)\n\n- Wow your assessor with unique vocab (i.e. illuminate, emanate, meditate)\n\nAnd hereâs a sample introduction to help you even more:\n\nJohn Donneâs anthology, âSelected Poetryâ illuminates the human condition and thus provides much commentary on life and death. A metaphysical poet of the Renaissance era, Donne combines a playful wit, rich imagery, and perhaps most importantly language, to challenge intellectual argument and celebrate various aspects of sexual desire, mutuality and faith. Immersed in the Christian traditions of his time, Donneâs exploration of Death emanates from the Elizabethan acute awareness of the brevity and vanity of human life; however, with his sensual elevation of reciprocal love and his deep spiritual belief in the resurrection of Christ, Donne meditates upon his belief and celebration of eternal life.\n\nâ\n\n2. Strong topic sentences are Crucial (with a capital C)\n\nâ\n\nTime and time again students fall into one of two traps. They either try to start each paragraph with a lengthy (and often beautiful) phrase trying to encapsulate every idea they plan to introduce in the paragraph. Or on other occasions, they have no introductory sentence and instead launch straight into their poetry analysis. Your assessor may be blown away with your A+ worthy introduction and then reach this weak opening to your paragraph and have to reconsider! Your topic sentence is the frame for the whole paragraph so please, keep it clear, succinct, and relevant to the essay question.\n\nHere are three âDOsâ and âDONâTsâ to consider when crafting one of the most important sentences of your essay (again, sorry about the drama!)\n\n- DONâT mention the poem you will use as evidence in your topic sentence\n\n- DO answer and link directly to the essay topic\n\n- DO use linking words to link the ideas in different paragraphs\n\nAnd here are three STRONG topic sentences for each paragraph of this essay (note how I always link back to the topic of human experiences and link ideas between paragraphs)\n\n- Rewriting the conventional trope, Donneâs oeuvre explores the joy of erotic love and onesâ lustful desire to engage in these sexual experiences.\n\n- While much of Donneâs oeuvre comments on the pleasure of carnal experiences, his more harmonious poems reveal the beauty of relationships in which one can experience a deep sense of mutuality and stability.\n\n- Silhouetted against the backdrop of the Elizabethan reign, Donneâs more metaphysical poems demonstrate the struggle of the process of dying and individual corruption, and the manner in which it leads to the acquirement of Godâs love and grace.\n\n3. Organise paragraphs by IDEAS\n\nâ\n\nWhat makes a poetry essay so unique is that your paragraphs are based on broad ideas rather than the motifs and behaviours of characters in novels. This means that when planning your essay you must ensure that each paragraph has only one idea and that each paragraph is based on a different idea. From there you can work out which poems best represent each concept to work out which poems you will use for each paragraph. This is why I love poetry essays as planning for them is so easy! All you have to do is think of three or four different ideas for the essay topic and then find your textual evidence by working out which poems best reflect these ideasâ¦. Simple! Right?\n\nHere are the three ideas that I plan to discuss in each of my paragraphs of this essay as well as the poems I would use:\n\n- Sexual/physical human experiences\n\n- âElegy 19: To His Mistress Going to Bedâ & âThe Fleaâ\n\n- Mutuality and reciprocity as an experience/element of spiritual love\n\n- âA Valediction: Forbidding Mourningâ\n\n- The innately human experience of dying and being embraced by God in heaven\n\n- âHymn to God My God in My Sicknessâ\n\nâ\n\n4. Analyse, not summarise\n\nâ\n\nIf there was one thing that was playing in my head over and over while writing a poetry essay it was âanalyse, not summariseâ. It is so easy to fall into the trap of simply summarising the poetic techniques and language of the different poems rather than analysing their meaning and linking this directly to the essay question. Even if you have the best plan and ideas going for you, if an assessor notices you going into summary mode theyâll assume youâre just rewriting a memorised essay rather then answering the exact essay question givenâ¦. DISASTROUS! To prevent this utter catastrophe, I urge you to please, link to and answer the specific essay topic EVERYTIME you introduce a new poetic technique/piece of evidence. Verbs such as demonstrates, elucidates, illustrates, exemplifies, illuminates and augments are âmust havesâ in your poetry tool-box as they will ensure that you are analysing not summarising.\n\nHere is a sample paragraph for you to consider (notice how I always link back to the idea of mutual/reciprocal love and experiences every time I introduce a new poetic technique or quote)\n\nWhile much of Donneâs oeuvre comments on the pleasure of carnal experiences, his more harmonious poems reveal the beauty of relationships in which one can experience a deep sense of mutuality and stability. The poem, ââA Valediction: Forbidding Mourningââ explores the sense of security and harmony which spiritual love and experiences permit. Adopting a hush, reverent tone manifested by the use of sibilance, through the enjambment of the phrase ââDull sublunary lovers love, / (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit / Absenceââ, Donne elevates mutual love to a higher plane, one that transcends the lines of poetry. When accompanied by the stability of the ABAB rhyme scheme that works to echo the coupleâs settled love, this presents the experience of reciprocity and mutuality of love to be higher than the dull and earthbound nature of love that is solely physical. Hence, Donne reveals the bliss that mutual love permits mankind, given it eclipses the desire for any form of physicality. Further elucidating the strength of mutual love, Donne illuminates how when couples are separated it is âânot yet a breach, but an expansionââ, thus celebrating the manner in which deep, reciprocal love not only eclipses the divisions of the clock but how it expands ââlike gold to airy thinness beatââ when separated. By connoting spiritual love to the pure and malleable nature of gold, this simile characterizes mutual love to be the prime of human experiences and relationships. Intertwining the elegant conceit of a compass to represent the love that connects the speaker and his mistress, Donne garners the notion that no matter how far ââone doth roamââ the intellectual bond between the couple will remain ââfirmââ and enable the pair to overcome any form of physical separation. Hence, Donne illuminates the complex and impermeable bond that this serene form of human experience can foster.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n5. Vocab and metalanguage are the easiest ways to SHINE\n\nâ\n\nTo say it plainly, writing with unique and refreshing vocabulary is enough to send your grade SOARING. It will not only render your ideas and discussion ever more complex, but has the power to enlighten and stimulate your assessor (and this is something we all want to doâ¦ right?). Utilising the correct poetic metalanguage every time you introduce a new quote or line of poetry will ensure that your analysis remains both specific and detailed. As seen in the paragraph above, discussing the poetic techniques provided me with another form of evidence (rather than just the quotes from the poem) to elucidate how these different forms of human experience are illustrated in each of Donneâs poems.\n\nTo assist you further, here is some metalanguage for the poetic techniques and structures that frequent John Donneâs poetry:\n\n- Sibilance, alliteration, imagery, paradox, conceit, metaphor, simile, personification, rhyme structure, tone, volta, enjambment, metre (i.e. iambic pentameter, trochaic tetrameter), monosyllabic phrasing\n\n- Stanza, verse, quatrain, cinquain\n\n6. Finish with a jaw-dropping conclusion\n\nA mediocre conclusion is like leaving your assessor with an unpleasant aftertaste that unfortunately, will not go away. So please, finally give your conclusion the attention it deserves and follow these five tips to ensure you leave your assessor waiting for that mic to drop!\n\n- Pan out to the broad, abstract ideas that the poet wrestled with\n\n- Discuss the aspects of the poet that set them apart from other poets at the time (i.e. for John Donne that is his intellectual imagery, arresting voice, wit, fusion of passion and logic and the manner in which he challenged intellectual argument and strongly held societal conventions)\n\n- Short and sweet not long and wordy!\n\n- Reinforce the period and society in which the poet wrote\n\n- You can include a secondary quote if you want, however only if it relevant to the essay topic and ideas you discussed\n\nHere is a sample conclusion to assist you:\n\nRailing against the societal value of religion prominent during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the originality of Donneâs ideas about love, death and God along with his strikingly intellectual imagery and rich language incite and interest his more religious readership of the joys of sexual, mutual and religious experiences. The poet and playwright Ben Jonson once wrote that John Donne ââwas the first poet in the world in some things.ââ Hence, it is through his witty and authentic form of expression that Donne allows us to reflect on and celebrate precisely what it means to be human.\n\nStories We Tell is a different beast to anything many of you will have encountered previously in your English studies. This blog is a continuation of the above Stories We Tell YouTube video so make sure you watch it first!\n\nWith interviews, archival footage, extradiegetic film and sound elements alongside recreated scenes, the documentary can seem very overbearing and convoluted upon first viewing. However, once you have a holistic understanding of the text a plethora of opportunity for high-level analysis and discussion presents itself. Stories We Tell is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nTo begin, watch our introduction covering background and themes below:\n\nVideo Transcription\n\nBackground\n\nStories We Tell centres around director Sarah Polley attempting to piece together her family history. While she endeavours to understand who her mother Diane was and finally learn the identity of her biological father, Director Polley also poses a number of questions to viewers surrounding the nature of the truth and the importance of stories in our lives. The film is comprised of interviews with Dianeâs loved ones, home movies from the Polley family, extra-diegetic newspaper clippings, recreated Super 8 footage and excerpts from other productions - all of which contribute to Sarahâs inquisition into the notion of truth, and demonstration that how a story is told can shape how it is received.\n\nNB: I have used âSarahâ when discussing Sarah Polley as a character, and âPolleyâ when describing her as the director.\n\nThemes\n\nTruth\n\nThe idea of the truth, and what comprises it is a constant question being answered through the documentary. Before exploring Polleyâs depiction of the truth, itâs important that we fully understand what the truth is. One definition characterises it as the burden of confirming with fact or reality, and with this in mind it becomes easier to appreciate and analyse the intricacies of Stories We Tell. Polley creates a distinction between universal truths - which are accepted by all as fact, and subjective truths which can vary on individual interpretations. For example, Michael conflicts with the rest of the family while discussing his relationship with Sarah after Dianeâs passing. Mark details Michaelâs obsession with âplaying solitaireâ, Susy depicts the house as one of âcomplete and utter disuseâ, while Joanna observed him âsmoking all dayâ and perceived Sarah as âjust a little kid who nobody was looking after.â Michael, however, has fond memories of his time spent with Sarah - he believed he was âlucky to have her to look after as well as himselfâ, called their time together a âgreat periodâ - eventuating in him feeling âcloser to [Sarah] than any of the other children.ââ\n\nIndividual recollections of Michaelâs actions and demeanor during this period belong to each storyteller, and form the basis for what they consider to be the âtruthâ regarding Michael and Sarahâs relationship. By presenting contrasting accounts of the same event, Polley reveals her stance on the idea of truth - being that it is entirely subjective and open to interpretation, centred around the perceptions of each individual at any moment in time. It is entirely possible that Michael did âsmoke all dayâ and feel a sense of increased âclose[ness]â with Sarah, but due to the variability of the human memory, this is impossible to state with any certainty - illustrating the fallible nature of universal truths.\n\nâ\n\nStorytelling\n\nStories and how they are told are a constant factor during the documentary - beginning with the title, âStories We Tellâ and concluding with Geoffâs admission that he and Diane did sleep together during their days acting in Montreal. For example, Polleyâs use of the inclusive âweâ signifies her interest in storytelling on a grand scale; not merely the stories she unravels onscreen. As a result, one can argue that her purpose for the documentary extends far beyond the action captured onscreen and in fact involves Polley encouraging others to share their own stories - enabling them to âcreate shape out of messâ as she has done through the presentation of her own family story.\n\nBy placing Geoffâs confession at the conclusion of the documentary (and casting doubt on all of the discoveries she has made throughout Stories We Tell) Polley emphasises how storytelling allows a âclearer pictureâ of the past to develop - as he had previously denied any sexual history with Diane, labelling them just friends. As such his admission of a relationship with her symbolises the manner in which the truth can be ârefractedâ over time, leading to many âshifts and fictionsâ while clouding âwhat really happened.â Therefore, Polley reveals how storytelling can provide some semblance of closure to us, in a world where the truth is âephemeralâ and âdifficult to pin down.â\n\nâ\n\nFamily\n\nWhile Polley undoubtedly utilises Stories We Tell to express her views on truth and storytelling, fundamentally it remains a story of the Polley family, and what holds it together. The narrative begins with the âstorytellersâ providing loving, yet somewhat conflicting recollections of Diane as Polley seeks to understand who she was. Family members buoyantly describe her as âinfectiousâ and âenthusiasticâ, while friends paint a more mysterious picture of Diane as a âwoman of secretsâ, alluding to her alleged infidelity. The closeness of the Polley family is evident throughout their discussion of Dianeâs first marriage, universally criticising the outcome of the court case in which she was labeled âunrepentantâ for âallow[ing] her desire for a career to overtop her âdomestic dutiesâ - resulting in Diane losing custody of John and Susy, which proved to be a major strain on Diane and the family.\n\nDespite this closeness, Mark expresses his disappointment in Diane following the confirmation of Harry being Sarahâs father - detailing the she âbroke the rulesâ and âbroke a kind of tabooâ when she had the affair. This is the only real example of any member of the family disapproving of Dianeâs past - indicating Polleyâs desire to demonstrate that families are not perfect, and bring their own faults and shortcomings. In spite of this, however, their care the family shows for one another is clearly demonstrated through their interviews with Polley, highlighting to the audience that by staying close, families can better cope with the trauma of losing a loved one and in time, be able to honour their memory by sharing their stories.\n\nâ\n\nPutting it all together\n\nWhile analysing the themes in isolation can provide a good foundation for success studying Stories We Tell, looking at how they interact and interrelate enables students to demonstrate their higher-order skills. Truth, storytelling and family are intrinsically linked - for example: Polleyâs presentation of conflicting accounts and recollections of Diane demonstrates the complexity of her family, while showcasing her stance on the inability of individuals to find universal truths. As a result of this, the importance of storytelling is highlighted as a means to provide some understanding of our past - and how it affects us in the present and shapes who we are. Including different interpretations of the text and the context in which Polley grew up and created the text can also help to improve your writing to A+ standard - and this will be covered in the blog post that acts as a continuation of this video! *end video*\n\nFollowing on from the video, the content below is an expansion upon Stories We Tell.\n\nAuthor views and values\n\nOne of the golden rules of A+ essay writing is to understand that everything contained within the text is seen to be a deliberate choice by the author. With this in mind, we can start considering how Polleyâs choice to include certain snippets or position footage in a particular way highlights her views.\n\nViews\n\nThe truth is ephemeral - can it ever be known?\n\nThroughout Stories We Tell, Polley continually emphasises the impossibility of knowing a truth with absolute certainty. Her stance is shaped by the clouded nature of her paternity and family history, exemplified within the text by the varying accounts of Dianeâs personality. Portraying her as âinfectiousâ and âenthusiasticâ, Polley captures Diane dancing - cleverly lighting up her face, thus symbolising her warm nature. However, juxtaposing this is Deidreâs assertion that Diane was a âwoman of secretsâ - bolstered by Polleyâs recreation of a covert phone call in which Diane ponders the identity of Sarahâs biological father. Through her presentation of contrasting recollections of her mother, Director Polley showcases the relativity of truth within her own family, inviting the audience to question the meaning of truth in their own lives, highlighting that âyou can never get to an answer.â As a result, Stories We Tell predominantly displays the impossibility of one knowing a singular truth.\n\nâ\n\nSubjective truths can be found\n\nContinuing the theme of ambiguity within her synthetic documentary, Sarah Polley demonstrates that individuals can develop their own interpretations of the truth, in spite of her stance on the validity of singular truths. Within Stories We Tell, Polley illustrates this by depicting the contrasting recollections of Michaelâs relationship with Sarah as a child. Supporting Joannaâs assertion that Sarah was âjust a little kid that nobody was looking afterâ, Polley ironically captures a full shot of Michael in the middle of the couch, portraying him as a distinctive presence in the scene in spite of Joannaâs belief that Michael isnât present in Sarahâs life. Conversely, Michael recalls his time with Sarah as âa great period in [his] lifeâ - a claim reinforced by Polley, via recreated Super 8 footage of the pair assembling a snowman, symbolising their construction of a new beginning following Dianeâs death. Through this interaction, Polley portrays Michael as a compassionate and loving father - juxtaposing this with Joannaâs description, revealing to her audience the ability of individuals to find subjective truths - encouraging them to do so in their own lives in spite of searching for universal truths.\n\nâ\n\nThe importance of stories\n\nBuilding on her depiction of the truth as fallible, Polley thus emphasises our need to tell stories, illustrating how they allow one to better understand themselves, their families and the world around them. Within Stories We Tell, unearthing the âstoryâ of Diane takes centre stage for a majority of the production, and Polley hints towards this goal via her inclusion of Bon Iverâs folk ballad Skinny Love. The line âpour a little salt, we were never hereâ plays on the use of salt to heal wounds - implying that the storytellers aim to âhealâ their pain felt from Dianeâs death via telling âthe whole storyâ they have developed from their memories of her. Moreover, the phrase âwho the hell was Iâ addresses Polleyâs attempt to âform [Diane]â by piecing together the various second hand accounts and layers of connected stories from her loved ones - allowing her to ascertain a clearer understanding of her family history. Polley utilises stories to â[clear] up...the smokeâ in her past,â praising the idea that such tales shed a light on areas of confusion and uncertainty - while also allowing one to â[cope]â and make sense of their heritage. Through her demonstration that stories enable individuals to move past the âsmall and large details that varyâ, Polley prompts the audience to seek more information about their own families, and relay their own family stories.\n\nValues\n\nThroughout the documentary, Polley demonstrates, both explicitly and implicitly, a number of her inherent values. Drawing upon these, referring to them in your essays and (most importantly!) connecting them to your analysis of the text is a great way to get ahead of the pack and maximise your marks both in your sac and the exam.\n\nNB: Much of the excerpts contained here are analysing specific scenes/motifs, and then linking such thinking to the theories listed below. I found this to be a coherent and structured way of including this deeper level of thinking in the publication of my own essays!\n\nâ\n\nFeminist lens on the social values of 1960âs Canada\n\nBy depicting extradiegetic footage of Diane singing Ainât Misbehavin, Director Polley provides a feminist commentary on the dominant social values of 1960âs Canada; the lyrics âI walk the streets to balance the sheetsâ and âwhat is an honest girl to doâ metaphorically representing the perception of Diane by the court and wider society - denied âcustodyâ of her children due to her âadultery.â\n\nBy inserting a newspaper clipping criticising Dianeâs choice to let her âdesire for a careerâ to supercede her âdomestic dutiesâ, Polley illustrates the difficulties faced by aspirational women in such a restrictive society - condemning the treatment of her mother while calling on female viewers to continually campaign for equality of opportunity in their societies.\n\nOutlining the fact that Diane was not considered âladylikeâ, Polley sardonically ridicules the âcontrollingâ nature of such rigid gender stereotypes and their effect on Diane losing her children - exhibiting her desire to empower her female audience to âsave [themselves]â from similar situations and âma[ke] a choice to live.â\n\nâ\n\nPostmodernist interpretation of the truth\n\nAs Iâve discussed at length in this blog post, Polley continually reminds us as an audience that the truth is not set in stone and is in fact a flexible, relative concept. Such a line of thinking directly correlates to the postmodernism literary theory - notable for being hostile to absolutes such as truth, and not creating a text in isolation.â\n\nâ\n\nTruth\n\nPolley continually blurs the line between fact and fiction within Stories We Tell - an ode to the postmodernist school of thought she is following. Depicting recreated Super-8 footage capturing herself directing the actress Rebecca Jenkins who âplaysâ the âroleâ of the younger Diane, Polley seeks to somewhat deceive her audience as to what is real and what is derivative - prompting the audience to âconsider what was real and what wasnâtâ¦ in their own minds.â As a result, she seeks to promote the validity of the postmodernist critical theory, prompting philosophical discussions between individuals about the variability of memory and whether any absolute truths can ever be truly known.\n\nâ\n\nIntertextuality\n\nAnother feature of postmodernism in literature is the relationship between one text to another. In her creation of Stories We Tell, Sarah Polley exacerbates this relationship, including a number of extradiegetic elements such as newspaper clippings, emails, songs and segments from other productions in order to add greater meaning to the documentary. For example, Polley presents her email exchange with Harry, illustrating her desire for the story to include âeveryoneâs point of viewâ, as it is only then that the âwhole pictureâ can be established. While reciting the email aloud, Polley delicately pauses when articulating that the story must include â[her] experience, [Harryâs] experienceâ and her âfamilyâs [experience]â, emphasising her desire to give âequal weightâ to all versions of the story.\n\nâ\n\nDifferent Interpretations\n\nâ\n\nIn my experience studying the text, this documentary can be interpreted two ways:\n\n1. as a self-reflective memoir following the journey of Sarah finding her father and gaining a more mature understanding of her mother, or;\n\n2. A philosophical and, at-times political commentary on the way stories are told and the nature of truth. Both interpretations (and others you find or develop through your own viewing) are great to use in your writing, just ensure that they are relevant to the specific prompt/idea you are discussing!\n\nLet's dive into each a little further:\n\nâ\n\n1. Stories We Tell is a commentary on how stories are told - specifically, how the way a story is told can shape how it is received and the meaning one can draw from it\n\nUpon first glance this point may seem rather convoluted, and several viewings of the text are necessary to fully engage with this line of thinking. Essentially, this centres around the idea that the different forms, mediums and extradiegetic elements present in the documentary can significantly influence how we as an audience react to the story that is being told.\n\nThe best way to explain this is to acknowledge the level of credibility and the associations attached to each individual medium used to tell the story.\n\nFor example, what impact does the newspaper clipping (detailing her custody battle and fight for equality in a restrictive society) have on our sympathy for Diane? Does the sense of credibility and validity drawn from an upstanding publication such as a newspaper elicit a greater sense of trust and acceptance of fact from viewers - therefore making us as an audience more inclined to view her in a positive light? Conversely, are viewers more accepting of Dianeâs affair with Harry following testimony from those who witnessed her unhappiness with Michael first hand - her friends and family?\n\nMoreover, in spite of her declaration that âequal weightâ will be given to all experiences, does Polleyâs use of Michael as narrator and his constant presence in the formal setting of a recording studio provide his version greater significance than Harryâs - who notwithstanding his involvement in the story as Sarahâs biological father, is resigned to providing his interview somewhat informally in a home setting, in the same vein as the rest of the storytellers?\n\nFeel free to apply this line of thinking to other aspects of the text - such a deeper engagement with the philosophical ideas of the text are far more likely to score highly, as opposed to shallow pieces that merely discuss the storytellers in isolation - and not what they represent.\n\n2. Stories We Tell is a commentary on the ephemeral nature of truth\n\nThe notion of truth seems to be just as much of a theme through this blog as it is in the documentary!\n\nThis is for good reason, however, as I found this to be the primary theme running through Stories We Tell, through the journey to discover Sarahâs paternity, the affair and conflict over whose story it is to tell. Truth affects a number of other ideas within the texts, such as storytelling, intertextuality, the variability of memory, production and identity - thus, using the ephemeral nature of the truth to explain why certain ambiguities exist in Harryâs âfaultyâ recollections, for example is an excellent way to show a greater depth of understanding of the interrelationships in the documentary.\n\nâ\n\nEssay Topic Breakdown\n\nâ\n\nEssay Topic from the 2018 VCAA Exam:\n\nâTo save all hurt, why not leave things as they are?â\n\nWhy does Sarah not âleave things as they are?â\n\nâ\n\nInitial thoughts:\n\nThis prompt does not ask you to discuss a specific theme or character - instead it guides you toward providing an analysis on Sarah Polleyâs purpose for creating Stories We Tell. While authorial intent should always be included in any text response essay, it is essential that the purpose is central in response to this type of prompt - essentially, providing points of discussion as to why Sarah is unable to âleave things as they are.â\n\nâ\n\nEssay Plan:\n\n1. Unable to leave things as they are - wanted to question the concept of traditional family structures, by contrasting the influence of biological connections and emotional relationships on her development.\n\nâ\n\nI discussed the effect of both Harry and Michael on Sarahâs development - concluding that while both of them had a significant role to play in her becoming the woman she is today, Michaelâs influence was significantly stronger. Polley implies this by giving him a greater voice in the documentary through his role as the narrator.\n\nâ\n\n2. Unable to leave things as they are - wanted to comment on the ephemeral nature of the truth in our lives.\n\nâ\n\nCentral to this paragraph is Polleyâs use of recreated Super-8 footage. Using three prime examples (the opening scene with Diane and Michael crossing the bridge, Polley directing the actress that âplays the roleâ of Diane in recreated footage, and the staging of Dianeâs funeral) I aim to display Polleyâs postmodern perspective on the truth and how this is conveyed through her deliberate creation of Stories We Tell.\n\nâ\n\n3. Unable to leave things as they are - Emphasise the importance of storytelling in our lives to gain some understanding of the past.\n\nâ\n\nDue to her depiction of the truth as a âmystery of nothingnessâ, Polley highlights the role that stories play in our lives. Within Stories We Tell, Polley attempts to understand herself by recreating Dianeâs story on screen - allowing her to create âshape out of messâ and form a clearer picture of how she became who she is. Moreover, Polley also reveals how stories enable individuals to maneuver through the âwreckageâ of the truth and ârecreate the past.â"
