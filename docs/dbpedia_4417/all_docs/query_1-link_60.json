The keys are made from soft nickel plated brass and grind down over the years from vibration. So does the lock.\n\nIf a key (and lock) has worn so far as to be able to just pull it out in any position, the car can probably be started with just a screwdriver. Super easy to steal. My old Toyota pickup I could start w a screwdriver. Key would just fall out.\n\nRockAuto has a new aftermarket ignition cylinder (lock) which comes with two new keys. Toyota's is discontinued. I replaced my worn out one with it and it worked great. Key won't match the other locks though.\n\nLast edited: Nov 13, 2018\n\nSpike Strip\n\nGoblin Mode Activated\n\nJoined\n\nNov 22, 2005\n\nThreads\n\n369\n\nMessages\n\n17,150\n\nLocation\n\nLost Angeles\n\nNov 13, 2018\n\n#5\n\nI would recommend @RAGINGMATT services, however he is in MA and your location says, L.A. ... so if you can afford to have the truck down (or swap in a diff cylinder) while it's being repaired, I'd go with Matt to keep the keys all the same...\n\nOr (don't know where you are in L.A.), but I've used this old-skool Reseda locksmith and he's great.

Yeah, retaining the original key functionality is a priority for me if it can be done. As Spike Strip points out, I'm in LA so would like to go local if possible to minimize the downtime. I guess sending it out to a locksmith for repair while I have it down for the knuckle and axle seal replacement would be best timing-wise.\n\ncruiserdan\n\nSupportingVendor Emeritus\n\nJoined\n\nMar 27, 2003\n\nThreads\n\n153\n\nMessages\n\n26,283\n\nLocation\n\nLand Cruiser Heritage Museum broom closet\n\nNov 13, 2018\n\n#7\n\nIf you have the key code you can get your local dealer to cut a new key to the original dimensions. That will solve the problem in many cases.

Getting cold here, nights are dropping into the teens and days aren't getting above the 50s. When I go out to turn the truck on and warm her up in the morning the key is VERY hard to turn in the ignition, almost to the point where I am afraid I may break the key off or bend it.\n\nIs there something I can do, add, squirt, etc. in the ignition cylinder that will help this out?

I'm going to pull it out and take it to a local locksmith as a first option.\n\nAnd yep...fairly new to the LC, but have ordered the knuckle bearings and axle seals and planning to tackle it myself based on all the info provided by the forum here and YouTube. Now just need to order some of the basic specialty tools for the job like seal puller and brass drift.\n\nJust in case you don't know, these ignition key cylinders come out so easy it's scary - It would be very simple for you to remove and mail or take to local Smith.\n\nDo the knuckles and seals yourself, if you have a driveway/Garage. Plenty of info for a DIY\n\nToyotaMatt\n\nFactory Focus-Point Mind-Set Approach\n\nJoined\n\nAug 12, 2007\n\nThreads\n\n1,604\n\nMessages\n\n27,076\n\nLocation\n\nEAST COAST\n\nWebsite\n\nvintageteqparts.com\n\nNov 14, 2018\n\n#17\n\nThanks @RAGINGMATT I'll check out my options and let you know if services are needed.
