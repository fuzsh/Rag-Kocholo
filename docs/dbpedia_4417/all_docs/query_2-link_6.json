Let me start with the positives:\n\n- It's got a modern Ui & UX, true to its name it's similar to a space game dashboard\n\n- The Mission Control dashboard provides you with a nice overview of the product including key dates, countdown, calendar, promo timelines such as website updates, social posting, in-app notifications, trial/paid etc etc\n\n- The mission control also provides you with the next upcoming task which it deems as a priority\n\n- Integrations are availble with Jira, Linear, Roadmunk and Product board\n\n- Ability to add custom modules to your launch plan\n\n- It's got a build in Ad copy AI tools - Hit “Generate” and Copilot will instantly generate a recommended asset plan for you, based on the promotional channels you’re using. As you add new channels, our AI will update this automatically. There are more than a dozen elements here that I haven't fully explored\n\n- The in-built task management feature is also very extensive. You can either build from scratch or give its AI co-pilot inputs and use that as a springboard\n\n- The release notes feature enables you to make these notes as internal or public\n\nAnd Finally, my favourite - Competitive Intel\n\nYou enter a website URL and it draws out the following information:\n\nTotal Funding\n\nLocation\n\nEmployees\n\nCompany type\n\nAnnual Revenue\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nThen it further gives you talking point prompts for Strengths, Weakness, Watch-outs, how we win, pricing, products, custom titles.\n\nSome areas for improvement in the coming weeks and months:\n\n- Definitely need some onboarding videos and tutorials\n\n- In Mission control, can we customise the terminology? For example, instead of Minor Tier 3, I would like to call it Beta launch\n\n- Similarly with the date, ability to change it to d/m/y\n\n- For the copy & asset page, there are many valuable tools there but absolutely no instructions\n\n- For the competitive intel talking points if you could integrate your co-pilot AI here, that would just be out of this world\n\nOverall, I feel Ignition is going to be a great product that grows before our eyes during its campaign on Appsumo. the team is super responsive and the founder got an enginner talking with me to resolve my issue in a matter of minutes (pro tip: don't activate your licence from a mobile device. It will result in a weird bug where you then can sign in only via Google)\n\nAll the best!\n\nps: please do consider integrating co-pilot AI into talking points and fleshing out comp Intel :)))"
