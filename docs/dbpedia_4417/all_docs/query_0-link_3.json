This terminal is energized at the same time as the \"ST\" start ign switch terminal which feeds the yellow wire to the \"ign\" terminal on the starter relay. These have to be seperate (not connected to each other) terminals on the ign switch otherwise current would feedback from the coil to the ign switch to the starter relay yellow wire \"ign\" terminal which might keep the starter solenoid partly or wholly engaged at all times as opposed to just when starting & one of our left coast members just had a problem with that cuz the \"awesome wiring diagram\" in the archives improperly shows the yellow starter relay wire being connected to the ballast/coil. The seperate ign2 \"full voltage\" and ST \"start\" terminals on the ign sw are either both hot (when cranking) or both dead (in ign1 run)\n\nThat is right. Ign-1 is key on power like to the ballast and alt field. Ign-2 and ST both get the power in the start position as was said and as was also said they cannot be hooked together as when the key would be turned to the on (ign-1) the ign-1 power would go through the ballast and then backfeed to the starter relay and if enough volts get through the ballast to work the starter relay it would crank in the run posistion. I know as years ago I had an old ign switch and tried it as it was a Ford switch and had no ign-2 on it since Ford bypasses its primary resistor wire with the starter solenoid.

Black wire. feeds out accesories just in RUN ( Ign 1 ) position, and Acc position ( when its available ). Runs to fuse box\n\nSt... Start Position, yellow wire. Runs straight to starter relay, no other splice. Works in Ign 2 position, cranking\n\nIgn1... Its acually the RUN position. Blue wire. Feeds just in RUN of course. All engine sources ( ballast, reg, ECU if pressent ) and some stuff into the cab ( cluster brake light, sometimes voltage limiter ) is sourced from here.\n\nIgn2... Start Position. Brown wire. Bypass the ballast to feed the full 12 volts at this moment. No splices around, just the ballast splice into the coil wire to bypass the ballast.\n\nNOTE:\n\nwhen ballast is conected, both Ign wires are hot, just with diff voltages on different stances, meaning with this:\n\nIn RUN... Ign 1 is full 12 volts and Ign 2 is getting back the power throught ballast, so anything between 5-9 volts can be there.\n\nIn START... Ign 2 is full 12 volts, and Ign 1 is getting power back through the ballast, so anything between 5-9 volts can be there.\n\nFor this reason is why you see the cluster brake light dimming when cranking\n\nTO TEST THE IGN SWITCH RIGHT OUT THE PRONGS:\n\nOne tester lead allways on BATT\n\nIgn 1 and ACC will get continuity with BATT prong on first switch position\n\nIgn 2 and Starter will get continuity with BATT prong on second ign switch position ( the one being pushed ).\n\nAcc will get also continuity with BATT on ACC position.\n\nANY OTHER continuity test will get you no continuity reading\n\nWith a Charger born in Chrysler assembly plant in Valencia, Venezuela\n\n383man\n\nToo Many Posts\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 27,421\n\nBalt.

Most Fords use a magnetic pole starter that has no solenoid on the starter as they use one of the field pole magnets to pull the starter drive into the flywheel and they use the small Ford type starter solenoid on the fenderwell. You know as it has the pos battery cable to one side and the other cable goes to the starter. Then it has to small terminals as one is marked (S) and it is from the ign switch and NSS to work the solenoid in the start position. The other small terminal is marked (I) and it has a small contact finger in there that the solenoid contact hits while cranking and it sends 12 volts to the coil bypassing the Ford resistor wire which is part of the primary wire harness between the ign switch and the coil. Sure you could use the Mopar ign switch with the ign-2 terminal but you dont need it on that type of Ford system so if you wanted to use the Mopar ign switch you just dont have to hook anything up to the ign-2 terminal. Ford did use a resistance in their point ign systems as it was a resistance wire in the wire harness to the coil primary pos side that basically does the same as the Mopar ballast resistor but I dont believe the wire type resistor changes some with heat like the Mopar ballast.

It has no resistor wire since this is home made stuff.\n\n8258208-image.jpg (373 downloads)\n\nLast edited by AZ_A12_BEE; 09:01 PM.\n\n69.5 A12 Bee, first purchased in 1976, car 169 on registry 69 Coronet R/T 440/4 spd 69 Coronet 500 Conv H code 383 4bbl/auto 37 Plymouth PU Find your spot on earth and ride it.\n\nHotwheelsjr\n\nI Live Here\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 10,697\n\nSurface of the Sun, AZ\n\nQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nIGN2- not sure what this is, is it the same as IGN1?\n\nno, it sends fire directly to the coil positive primary terminal when starting, bypassing the ballast that the current has to go thru in ign1 (run).

The seperate ign2 \"full voltage\" and ST \"start\" terminals on the ign sw are either both hot (when cranking) or both dead (in ign1 run)\n\nThat is right. Ign-1 is key on power like to the ballast and alt field. Ign-2 and ST both get the power in the start position as was said and as was also said they cannot be hooked together as when the key would be turned to the on (ign-1) the ign-1 power would go through the ballast and then backfeed to the starter relay and if enough volts get through the ballast to work the starter relay it would crank in the run posistion. I know as years ago I had an old ign switch and tried it as it was a Ford switch and had no ign-2 on it since Ford bypasses its primary resistor wire with the starter solenoid. Ron\n\nI'm rewiring the Ford 302 in my 37 pickup, are you saying that Fords don't need Ign-2, only Ign-1? Do Fords even need a ballast resistor with a points distributor ?\n\nYes. Most Fords use a magnetic pole starter that has no solenoid on the starter as they use one of the field pole magnets to pull the starter drive into the flywheel and they use the small Ford type starter solenoid on the fenderwell. You know as it has the pos battery cable to one side and the other cable goes to the starter. Then it has to small terminals as one is marked (S) and it is from the ign switch and NSS to work the solenoid in the start position. The other small terminal is marked (I) and it has a small contact finger in there that the solenoid contact hits while cranking and it sends 12 volts to the coil bypassing the Ford resistor wire which is part of the primary wire harness between the ign switch and the coil. Sure you could use the Mopar ign switch with the ign-2 terminal but you dont need it on that type of Ford system so if you wanted to use the Mopar ign switch you just dont have to hook anything up to the ign-2 terminal. Ford did use a resistance in their point ign systems as it was a resistance wire in the wire harness to the coil primary pos side that basically does the same as the Mopar ballast resistor but I dont believe the wire type resistor changes some with heat like the Mopar ballast. Ron\n\nRon, can I use a generic ignition switch with just Bat, Start and Ign1 and make this work with the Ford 302? Do I still need a ballast resistor before the coil? It has no resistor wire since this is home made stuff.\n\nThat exact switch is all I run in my Rat. And why stay points? Get rid of that POS and go elec.\n\nAZ_A12_BEE OP\n\nI Live Here\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 18,575\n\nDreaming of the 808\n\nQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nIGN2- not sure what this is, is it the same as IGN1?\n\nno, it sends fire directly to the coil positive primary terminal when starting, bypassing the ballast that the current has to go thru in ign1 (run). This terminal is energized at the same time as the \"ST\" start ign switch terminal which feeds the yellow wire to the \"ign\" terminal on the starter relay. These have to be seperate (not connected to each other) terminals on the ign switch otherwise current would feedback from the coil to the ign switch to the starter relay yellow wire \"ign\" terminal which might keep the starter solenoid partly or wholly engaged at all times as opposed to just when starting & one of our left coast members just had a problem with that cuz the \"awesome wiring diagram\" in the archives improperly shows the yellow starter relay wire being connected to the ballast/coil.

It's simple and it runs, besides I would have to buy an electronic ignition, I'm cheap remember\n\n69.5 A12 Bee, first purchased in 1976, car 169 on registry 69 Coronet R/T 440/4 spd 69 Coronet 500 Conv H code 383 4bbl/auto 37 Plymouth PU Find your spot on earth and ride it."
