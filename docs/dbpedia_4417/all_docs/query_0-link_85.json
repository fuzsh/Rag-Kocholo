One thing you mention, the ballast on the coil. I have that and a Lucas Sport Coil as well. Would that be a problem? It has worked in the past as it stands so I am a bit puzzled. I'll try rapping on the solenoid to loosen it and check my wires. My 6 is Mimosa Yellow also.\n\nAloha Perry,\n\nI see your relay is on top, so the relay operating circuit is on the right and the wires to the starter and coil are on the left. The big brown wire supplies +12V from the main battery cable to the center blade connector. That center connection also has a second blade for a small brown wire to connect to the fusebox. In my earlier photo, you can see it powers the purple, or always hot, circuit. I wonder if your horns/hazard lights, etc has power, as I don't see a small brown wire in there - can you widen the shot to include the fusebox?\n\nCan you hear (or feel) the relay operate when you turn the key to start? The relay could be stuck on, but there are other possibilities. Where does the big red wire go - hopefully not to the coil. Although both the starter and coil circuits are powered when the relay closes, they are electrically separate, This is very important, because when the car is running, the coil is still powered by the ballast wire (or a home-made direct wire). This will supply power to whatever else is connected to the + side of the coil. If you're a cheapskate and adapt a spare horn relay as a starter relay, you'll be surprised at how hot the wires get, as the wire to the starter solenoid will still be powered. A ballast wire won't have enough voltage to keep the solenoid closed, just get real hot (ask me how I know). If the coil had full 12V it might keep the starter going.\n\nI'd pull the relay out and give it an ops check on the bench. You can carefully un-bend the 4 tabs and pull the metal case off. I must have tossed my broken relay out, but there is a small spring that keeps the output contacts apart until the relay operates. If that fails, they probably won't open back up.\n\nJeff\n\nFirst, I have to say thanks to everyone helping, I appreciate it. Second, I hate, and am horrible at electrical issues. I will re-attach the brown wire and disconnect the red and see what I have. I will also check the Hi-beams and glove box as it currently stands to see if they work or not. There are a few more wiring mods than I thought. I have add on wires that go to the horns, one that goes to the positive side of the coil, and maybe one other. When I restored it 15 years ago, I re-used the harness. Now I wish I had replaced it. I haven't really had many problems before.\n\nAfter the initial run in, I pulled the plugs and the front 3 looked white, number 2 was like it never fired. The back three were better color wise. I know I need to adjust the carbs. I turned the mixture nuts all the way up, then out 1 1/2 turns as recommended. I'll start there. I have a spare cap and rotor and will try that to remedy number 2 not firing. That's all I can think it could be as I checked the wire and it was in solid. I need to find out the right routing for the heater lines in the back of the motor, to the heater as it seemed to not circulate well. A few things to do then off to sleep for the winter.\n\nPerry"
