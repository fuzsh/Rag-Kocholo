        "text": "I've been wanting to document how the internals of the (electrical) ignition switch work and also show the weak spots to demonstrate WHY a \"hard start relay\" could be needed. Hopefully this will answer questions some may have and correct some misconceptions. So here goes....\n\n{any \"funny colored\" pics are because I tried to lighten them so you could see the dark/shaded areas better}\n\nOuter View\n\nThe electrical portion of the ignition switch is located inside the ignition lock assembly metal body (#1 below). This lock assembly is installed in the steering column housing. This is what the ignition lock assembly looks like:\n\nThe shape has changed over the years, but related to the ignition switch, this housing has three parts:\n\nA : The ignition switch (left) that controls the flow of electricity to different components of the car.\n\nB : The lock cylinder (right) where you insert the key.\n\nC : These dimensions are meant to help you drill a hole to press the release spring for the lock cylinder.\n\nD : The lock assembly which extends/retracts a steering column lock bolt depending on the key position. The other two parts fit INTO this housing.\n\nThis is the (failed) 2yr-old ignition switch from my '75 RHD 1200LS (non-US). It uses a 1971 ignition switch (why?... because it uses a 1971 steering column -- the last year without the steering column mounted wipers -- so you can still fit the earlier style steering wheels).\n\nNotice the bump at the bottom used for proper alignment and the threaded tab at the top where the small screw holds the switch into the lock assembly (#2 in the pic above). If the tab breaks off, this switch is probably not worth fixing. No amount of glue will work to hold the tab in place and prevent the switch from falling out of the lock assembly body.\n\nNote the center keyed slot. The end of the key tumbler assembly passes through the entire lock assembly and fits in this slot. When a key is inserted, a small pin extends and touches a brass tab inside. This causes the Brown/Blue (#SU) wire to become grounded to the body of the lock assembly.\n\nIf this keyed slot is badly chewed up, the switch may not work properly.. or at all.\n\nThe whole switch is a nice fit into the key assembly body. If you think you can glue or tape the electrical switch together... you may find you can no longer insert it all the way into the lock assembly body. So be careful to preserve the outside of the case and not break any tabs/clips.\n\n{Continued in the next message...} So what are all the wires for?\n\nRed - (#30, Battery)(4.0mm^2 ~ 11AWG) 12v+ power from battery (center post)\n\nGray - (?, Key OUT)(1.5mm^2 ~ 15AWG) 12v+ output while ignition switch is OFF (alarm)?\n\nBrown/Blue - (#SU, Key IN)(0.5mm^2 ~ 20AWG) ground output while ignition key is inserted\n\nBlack/Yellow - (#X, ACC)(4.0mm^2 ~ 11AWG) accessories that do not need power while engine is cranking, 12v+ output only in ON position\n\nBlack - (#15, Ignition)(1.5mm^2 ~ 15AWG) 12v+ output in ON & START positions\n\nRed/Black - (#50, Starter)(4.0mm^2 ~ 11AWG) starter solenoid, 12v+ output in START position\n\nMy original switch (before this one) came with a metal case and one(?) less wire. I was afraid this plastic one would break, but I was careful when removing the cover. The internals of the original switch were much different than the below. So please realize there are different kinds of switches out there. This write up is just a guide for the one I have. But functionally, they will be similar. Careful attention to details and you can understand how any switch works.\n\nObviously this OE manufacturer was using later style switch bodies and soldering wires to them for use in earlier cars.\n\n'71 was the last year for soldered on wires. Later models used a similar switch w/ spade connectors out the bottom. If this switch fails me again in the future, I will try to use a later style switch ('72-later?, less expensive) and just crimp female spade connectors to the end of my wires.\n\nNote the terminals in the above pic. They are staked into the black plastic base. This means they could wiggle loose. Compare how much they stick out and tap any loose ones back in. Maybe even add a dab of strong glue to prevent them backing out.... be careful NOT to get glue on the sides of the housing.\n\nMy original switch appeared to be an original VW part and may have been as old as the car, but it \"died\" from the same reason as this one... burnt contacts... it just took longer for the original to fail. This OE replacement failed after 2years. I read lots of post of people having trouble getting their starters to crank. I believe many are related to old ignition switches burning out their contacts. As the years pass... it will only get worse.\n\n{Continued in the next message...} Going in...\n\nTo start dis-assembly, you pry off the white cover from the black base with a small screwdriver. Be careful NOT to crack the plastic/nylon. Slowly separate the parts, being careful to capture any ball bearings or springs that may \"pop out\".\n\nThis cover contained the return spring that forces the key to rotate back from START to ON. It also has grooves that functioned as a one-time gate so you MUST turn the key to OFF before trying to START a second time. That function seems so uniquely \"VW\".\n\nBelow you can see the black plastic mid-layer that will rotate as the key is turned. The bottom face of this mid-layer will hold springs and the conductors against contacts located in the base. The black piece flips over and into the cover. You can see the square tang that engages the return spring. This only happens between the ON and START positions so there is no rotational tension on the assembly most of the time. Also note the greasy square slot where the spring & follower sit (5-o'clock). This spring & follower are what make the one-time gate function properly. Leave it out and you can go from ON to START as many times as you wish (hint?).\n\nHere is the bottom side of the mid-layer with the springs that hold conductors against contacts. The mid-layer is properly seated inside the white cover:\n\nAnd with the springs installed:\n\nThe brass \"ring\" to the right fits between the mid-layer and the base. I've oriented the \"ring\" and it's tab so you can see how they fit into the mid-layer. Note the slot at the 8-o'clock position that will hold the ring's tab. This \"ring\" will conduct ground once the key is inserted (the key is grounded via the key cylinder and the lock assembly). The pin that extends from the key cylinder will contact the brass tab. The outer ring will remain in contact with the #SU terminal even as the whole thing rotates. There is also a small spring at 1-o'clock position that presses on the small tab located on the ring. This helps maintain pressure around the ring circumference.\n\n{Continued in the next message...} Internal contacts\n\nOnce you have the cover off you can see the internal contact pads in the base which are opposite the outer terminals and soldered wires. I have labeled their functions here.\n\nEach contact has a raised \"pad\". This small area is where electrical contact is made. Not much surface area!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: the Starter contact at the top has a black burnt pad. This is the reason WHY I took this switch apart after only 2-yrs. The current flowing through to the starter solenoid had burnt the contacts so badly they worked intermittently or delivered less than 12v. You can also see pitting on the center lead contact point.\n\nThe original switch which I took a part had much LARGER contacts for most of the circuits. The Starter contact in that switch was almost as large as the center contact above.\n\nHARD START RELAYS (HSR) - Based on my findings above, I personally believe any new OE ignition switches should be paired with a HSR. This is not for the purpose of compensating for bad/old wires (though it does do this too)... but to prolong the life of ignition switches (NOS ones, or even Chinese made ones). The HSR reduces the current that passes through the Starter contact in the ignition switch... preventing the burnt contact you see above.\n\nI cleaned all the electrical contacts w/ a small emery board before re-assembly.\n\nThe other thing to note in the above pic is the circular groove cut in the base between the outer contacts and the inner one. It runs from 11-o'clock to 4-o'clock around the bottom. This grove controls when the rotating conductor is pressed down onto the contacts. A bump on the silver \"keyhole\" shaped (SKS) piece falls into this groove.\n\nAlong the top lip of the rim are three notches. One at 1-o'clock, one at 5-o'clock and one at 6-o'clock. These are the detents (felt as ignition key positions) they keep the key in each position. One end of the rotating conductor rides this rim. When you turn the key and feel it \"click\" into the ON position.... you are feeling that conductor end fall into these detents.\n\n{Continued in the next message...} Here are the rotating metal pieces:\n\nThe silver \"keyhole\" shaped (SKS) one at the top appears to be made from tin or aluminum. It's main job is to help the Y-shaped conductor rotate soothly, but it also drops down to make contact between the battery terminal and the ignition + \"X\" circuits at the same time. This ensures current is flowing to the ignition coil as the YSC rotates between contacts. It will also lift and drop the conductor depending on which position the key is in.\n\nThe Y-shaped conductor (YSC) in the middle does almost ALL the work. It conducts electricity from the center battery terminal to the outer contacts. The two ends of the \"Y\" allow up to two contacts to be powered at the same time.\n\nThe ring at the right is the ground ring for the Key IN circuit.\n\nThis is how the top two pieces fit into the base:\n\nNote in the background the cover and mid-layer. You can see how the YSC will FIT into the mid-layer (see Y-shape slot in mid-layer). The springs in the mid-layer will press against the YSC to ensure good contact.\n\nKEY POINT !!!: this above pic with the YSC in the base is for reference only. All of the conductors are assembled in the cap/mid-layer shown in the background and then the empty base snaps into the cap last.\n\n{Continued in the next message...} Key positions...\n\nNOTE: all below pics are examples to show HOW connections are made inside the ignition switch. The actual conductors are assembled on the mid-layer in the cap, then the base is snapped into place sandwiching the conductors and springs between the mid-layer and the base.\n\nThis is what the conductor will look like in the different key positions (it looks funny because I used a paint program (Gimp2) to paste the conductors into the earlier pic for consistency). You can compare with the earlier labeled pic to determine which contacts are receiving power.\n\nThis is the OFF position:\n\nThe only contact is to the gray wire which is now connected to the center 12v+ battery source. There is no physical contact with any other terminal.\n\nThe opposite end of the YSC is sitting in the top notch around the outer rim. This prevents accidental movement. While it may look like the tip of the \"Y\" is touching the starter terminal, it is always supported along the rim edge. This end of the YSC never touches anything conductive. Even the ground ring which rides on this same rim rotates with the key so the tip of the YSC rides in the gap of the ring.\n\nThis is the ON position:\n\nNow 12v power is connected to BOTH the #X and #15 terminals.\n\nThe dimple of the SKS piece has fallen into the semi-circular groove now. A spring will hold it against the contacts and ensure the Ignition circuit (#15) has continuous contact with the 12v source as the key turns.\n\nThis is the START position:\n\nNow 12v power is connected to BOTH the #15 and #50 terminals and the engine should be cranking. In the stock configuration, maximum current is flowing through the Starter terminal to the solenoid. Without a HSR, arcing over time will burn the Starter contact (as seen above).\n\nNotice the #X terminal is no longer connected (the small tab which looks like it could be touching is actually suspended above the terminals).\n\nClosing up...\n\nIn the end, everything is assembled up-side-down in the cover and the base is finally snapped into the cover. It is likely your switch may be made differently than mine. I recommend you study the switch and understand how the contacts and springs work together.\n\nI de-greased everything and polished all electrical contacts with an emery board or fine sandpaper. I cleaned out all the filings and re-greased all friction parts w/ dielectric grease.\n\nI ran electrical checks of all contacts to make sure they were working as expected as well as tested the one-time gate mechanism.\n\nOverall, it took a bit of time (two weekends of work... going very slowly). There were a few small parts that could be difficult if you are \"all thumbs\", but in general, I think anyone could do this themselves if they wanted to revive or rebuild their ignition switch.\n\nHaving done this twice now... given a choice of rebuilding an original ignition switch vs. buying a replacement (possibly made somewhere OTHER than Germany, 30-years ago)... rebuilding would be my first choice. I feel you would get the longest life out of the part as long as there were no broken pieces to deal with.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nhttp://www.vw-resource.com/ignition_switch_replacement.html\n\nGood step-by-step for replacing the ignition switch. ashman40 wrote: When a key is inserted, a small pin extends and touches a brass tab inside. This causes the Brown/Blue (#SU) wire to become grounded to the body of the lock assembly.\n\nThat's the setup for North American ignition switches.\n\nEuropean ones (which we got here in Aus) are different.\n\nThey have S instead of SU and it does the opposite thing.\n\nWhen the key is inserted it provides 12volts to S instead of a ground like SU.\n\nAll of my 71 and later Supers have been like this as well as the replacement switches I've bought.\n\nStrangely though the 71 and later 1300 standard beetles I've owned were completely missing that terminal, just had an empty slot there.\n\nIt really is handy though as it acts like an accessories position.\n\nI just have this connected straight to the ACC wire of my headunit so it only powers up when the key is in the ignition but doesnt have to be turned on.\n\nAlso your mystery grey wire that is only live when the ignition is turned off is for the side light marker system that was used in parts of Europe.\n\nIf you leave the indicator switch in left or right position once the ignition is turned off the side repeater indicator stays lit up.\n\nThis was for when the cars were parked in those dark narrow laneways in Europe so they were more visible and didn't get side swiped.\n\nMost type3s here in Aus have that feature."
