        "text": "This article was originally published Nov. 1, 2010. Some of the information may no longer be relevant, so please use it at your discretion.\n\nThe headline might give you the impression that the subject is all about testing coils, spark plugs and plug wires, but I am referring to analyzing the electron behavior in the combustion chamber. The objective is to look at the effect of fuel mixture, valve seating, compression, carbon deposits, and other symptoms that affect this behavior. The ultimate goal is to learn the logic of scope pattern interpretation.\n\nWhy a scope if you have a scan tool?\n\nVery few shops have a scan tool for every vehicle and using a scope for drivability problems is an alternative. The scan tool might spot a misfire, but the scope does more than just find the location. It identifies under what conditions (speed or load) the problem occurs and provides a chance to evaluate the cause. Because you can compare each cylinder under the same load or driving condition, you can show the customer potential future misfires and prevent comebacks.\n\nFor practical purposes, there is no current flow until the plug fires as indicated by the firing time. When the coil output runs out of energy, the residual energy dissipates into oscillations. Because hydrocarbons (fuel) are conductors, they not only assist in the ionization process but also affect the conductivity during firing time.\n\nHow do we know it is a plug wire?\n\nLet us assume a cylinder at idle showed abnormally high kilovolt, and the firing time seemed to be shorter compared to the other cylinders. We need to find out where that high kilovolt is created, internally or externally. Play with the throttle, accelerate and decelerate and watch the response. If the kilovolt stays high, this indicates that the greatest gap was external. How should the scope respond to rpm increase?\n\nAt 2,000 rpm, the timing advance is between 30 and 40 degrees BTDC. At that time, the piston barely starts the compression stroke resulting in less compression when the plug fires. Therefore the reduced kilovolt tells us that the timing advance is functional, and there was compression. We have verified the greatest gap is indeed in the combustion chamber and not external.\n\nWhat about fouled plugs?\n\nScope analysis has a lot to do with common sense. Let us imagine what a fouled plug looks like on the scope. No picture to memorize, just use your imagination. There is no spark gap, and therefore, no nose or residual energy left. Because carbon resistance replaces the spark gap, the coil energy is drained off, as indicated by a curved slope from the kilovolt spike to the dwell line.\n\nResistance of carbon foul could be as high as 2 Megaohms demanding more kilovolts than, for instance, a wet plug caused by a dripping injector. How do we know the difference? Very simple!\n\nLeaky Injector:\n\nAt low rpm, it might look like a fouled plug, but at higher rpm, the dripper might start firing because there are fewer drips between firing events, but when this cylinder fires, the fuel mixture is still rich, and the scope shows a lower kilovolt plus a longer firing time with hardly any nose. The computer looks at that dripper as too rich and subtracts fuel, driving the other cylinders extremely lean (Figure 3).\n\nThere is one exception: the cylinder next in firing order, which benefits from the overflow of the dripper. With computer controlled engines, total engine analysis of all cylinders tells us the complete story and verifies diagnosis, and that is important to save valuable time.\n\nComparing with a good performing cylinder at the same speed or load is essential. How do we know that \"A\" is OK?\n\nNote there is no coil energy wasted in high kilovolt demand.\n\nConsider the smooth conductivity of the firing line of total combustion as long as there is coil energy available.\n\nThe nose tells us to what extent coil energy is used up to burn all the fuel. This is a perfect match of air, fuel and spark duration.\n\nWe do want to know the where, when and how before drawing a conclusion. Besides location, it helps to know how many cylinders are affected, and what the rpm or load was when the problem occurred. It does not take any skills of scope pattern interpretation to identify a shorter than normal or greater than average firing time to pinpoint the oddball.\n\nAny short spark duration indicates a higher resistance either due to high kilovolt or reduced HC. A longer firing time indicates a lower than average resistance.\n\nHelpful hints in scope pattern interpretation\n\nAnyone who knows Ohms Law understands that the effect of resistance is in direct proportion to current flow. When we have a poor connection at the battery post of as little as 0.01 ohm with the headlights turned on, it creates only 0.1V drop — not even noticeable in brightness.\n\nHowever, during cranking, that same resistance at 300A cranking load means 3V less at the starter. This certainly will slow down the cranking speed. This also holds true for air flow or fuel flow. A kink in a garden hose does not make much difference if you want a cup of water, but it becomes a problem when sprinkling the lawn. A fuel filter restricted at 80 percent will not make any difference at idle, but the car will not have the horsepower to make it uphill.\n\nThe point is simply that testing under load makes all the difference to complete performance analysis. Because you have the scope hooked up, it might take less than a minute in the bay or up to 20 minutes on a test drive. There are different options or methods of testing under load, but they all have two things in common:\n\nIt needs to be done with someone in the driver seat.\n\nThe leads need to be long enough to reach the equipment inside the vehicle.\n\nTest Results Under Load\n\nResistance and restriction or obstruction all mean the same thing and will have the greatest negative effect when the demand for flow is high. Let us explore examples.\n\nRestricted exhaust\n\nWhen the engine cannot exhale properly, all functions are affected. The firing line on the scope showing perfect at idle, becomes ragged and shows turbulence progressively getting worse under load disturbing all cylinders. Plus, EGR is doubled or tripled.\n\nUnder normal conditions, the EGR valve re-circulates about seven percent of the exhaust gasses into the intake. However, with even a small exhaust restriction this might increase to 30 percent or more. Momentarily inhibiting the EGR valve from functioning, while watching for improvement on the scope pattern, is one way to verify restriction. Restriction will cause reduced volume and is not a lean mixture as it is sometimes called. It is not affecting the air/fuel ratio.\n\nDual exhaust\n\nThis, from separate banks, can play tricks if one bank is restricted. The good (non-restricted) bank will look extremely lean on the scope pattern with a high nose, while the restricted bank seems to have a richer fuel mixture with hardly any nose. Let us assume that bank No. 1 is 50 percent restricted.\n\nThe MAF sensor will report this reduced flow as 100+50 divided by 2 is 75 percent of total flow to the combined banks. The computer distributes an equal amount of fuel to both intake manifolds.\n\nThe good bank No. 2 inhales 100 percent air and gets 25 percent less fuel allotment. The restricted bank No. 1 inhales 50 percent air and gets the same amount of fuel. That is 25 percent more fuel than this bank requires. See if you can find a lean cylinder and a rich cylinder in the figures that will match bank 1 and bank 2.\n\nWorn Cam Lobe\n\nThis problem is not a daily occurrence, but we're exploring how to interpret what the scope is trying to tell us in the waveforms. Figure 5 looks almost similar to the lean injector in Figure 4 or 7, but the difference is in the kilovolt demand, and the level where the firing line starts. We need to compare this with a good cylinder (see Figure 5). This is a case of reduced volume of HC and not a lean air/fuel ratio."
