        "text": "I have a 2000 Monterey 180 Edge. The ignition switch went out i think. When i start it the key will turn endlessly forever. I can still start it but i have to feather the key until i get it in just the right position until i hear it start, and then i have to feather it back off to disengage the starter but without going too far back and shutting the engine off. Its really a pain in the butt and im pretty sure ill mes up my starter if i keep doing it that way so i want to fix it. My question is are there any differences in the ignition switches? Or can i just pick one from the iboats store and order it? I dont have a manual or anything for my boat.\n\nThanks for any help.\n\nRe: Question about ignition switch\n\nYes there is a difference. If your boat is outboard powered, it takes a switch with the push-to-choke feature and it will generally have six terminals. A switch for an I/O is much simpler and has OFF, RUN, START position, no push to choke, and it only has three terminals. When you post questions about your boat it is essential that you indicate what power plant the boat has. Remember -- we can't see it.\n\nRe: Question about ignition switch\n\nsounds like the starter to me--the gear that rises and falls to start is not (can't recall the name). turn the key to the first \"on\" position and then take you r jumper cables and hook one end to POS on the battery and the other, touch the bolt/connection on the starter. If that is working, try the solonoid.\n\nRe: Question about ignition switch\n\nI had that happen this summer with my ignition switch. The little spring inside broke, so the key could not return to the \"run\" position. I replaced it with an all metal ignition switch. The original one was plastic and I highly recommend spending a few dollars more for the metal one. Its very easy to replace - just match up the wires from the old to the new switch.\n\nRe: Question about ignition switch\n\nThanks for the help! And just to verify, it is a mercruiser I/O, and the problem is not with the starter or anything else, just that ignition switch. When I turn the key it doesnt stop turning. It will still start and run, but i have to hold the key at the \"start\" position and then once i hear it start i have to back it up to the run position. The whole time im just feathering the position of the key into the right position since it doesn't just stop there like it should. TregoMark explained it exactly right, so it probably is something to do with a broken spring in there.\n\nSo it sounds like any I/O boat switch will do?\n\n(Also I edited my profile with the correct boat/engine.)\n\nThanks again everyone."
