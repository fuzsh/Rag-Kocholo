        "text": "Declaration of Compliance\n\nStarting on August 25, 2017, all individuals who had an ignition interlock system installed, and whose one-year ignition interlock period ends on or after August 25, 2017, will be required to have the ignition interlock vendor send the department a declaration of compliance to be eligible to obtain an unrestricted driver’s license or learner’s permit without the ignition interlock restriction.\n\nThe Declaration of Compliance is a PennDOT-controlled form that Ignition Interlock vendors will utilize to certify that an individual has not had any incidents, as defined by law (see 75 Pa.C.S. Sections 3805(c)(2) (relating to issuance of unrestricted license) and 3805(h.2)(relating to declaration of compliance)), occur in the two consecutive months prior to the date entered on the certificate. For Individuals who received an IILL as a result of a suspension for ARD, the compliance form must indicate that no incidents have ocurred in the prior 30 days to the date entered on the certificate. Before PennDOT can issue an unrestricted driver’s license, a Declaration of Compliance must be received from the Ignition Interlock vendor."
