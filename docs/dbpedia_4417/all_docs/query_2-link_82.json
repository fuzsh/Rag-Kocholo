        "text": "Did you know that one of the many amazing things that the Critical community does every year is come together and help support the stewardship of the beautiful land that hosts us? This happens through a series of Work Weekends!\n\nThe first Work Weekend is right around the corner and we’d love to have you join us! This one happens May 18th and 19th, and you’ll get to see friends, help support Critical, and get out into the woods!\n\nNot that you need more encouragement, but… The work weekends can help you can get free/reduced tickets to Critical for next year (2025). Many people fulfill a lot of their volunteer hours pre-event this way!\n\nPlease sign-up for the day(s) that work for you:\n\nSign-up here!\n\nGATE HOURS\n\nMon-Fri: 10 AM to 10 PM\n\nSat: 10 AM to 1 PM\n\n—\n\nARRIVAL\n\nYour vehicle will be marked with your arrival time, after which you have one hour to unload before parking. Pull over completely while you unpack so others can continue to use the roads.\n\nUnload and park before setting up your camp. Space to unload is limited, especially in walk-in camping, and others will be waiting to get in after you.\n\nThere is a strict 5 MPH speed limit for all roads. This includes the long road to our\n\n—\n\nAmbassadors!\n\nAdditionally, ONLY mutant vehicles and official use vehicles can drive on Electric Avenue, Pussycat Path, or Firefly lane or after 8 PM anywhere on site.\n\nIf you arrived late and didn’t get to parking before they closed, please pull off the road completely for the night and get your car in the lot when they open at 10 AM.\n\n—\n\nRE-ENTRY (IN/OUT)\n\nRe-entry is only available to those who arranged an in-out pass in advance of the event. Note that an In/Out pass is tied to ONE PERSON and ONE VEHICLE. Anyone over 18 leaving or re-entering the event must show their ID.\n\nONE: Be Prepared | The Right Tools Make All the Difference\n\n• Remove excess packaging and prepare meals at home.\n\n• Bring enough water to sustain your needs.\n\n• Reduce your water use with the wipe-spray washing system\n\n• Inspect your vehicle for leaks; we have cardboard if needed\n\n• Leave sequins, feather, glitter, and beaded finery at home\n\n• NO GLITTER, not even a little bit, not even biodegradable\n\nTWO: Manage Your Worksite …and Your Waste\n\n• Strain your gray water to remove any food scraps\n\n• Make sure your compost bucket has a tightly fitted lid\n\n• Use sawdust to absorb odors and moisture\n\n• NO dumping gray water outside the gray water tanks (Note, the gray water tanks\n\nare for small amounts of gray water only. If you have a large amount, pack it\n\nout.)\n\n• There are no dumping or collection services onsite\n\nTHREE: Respect the Canvas | Leave No Trace\n\n• Use only existing trails and campsites\n\n• Do not bushwack your way into a “better site”\n\n• Carry a bag to collect MOOP you find along your adventures\n\n• Watch for roots when from pounding stakes or rebar\n\nFOUR: Protect Your Source of Inspiration | Respect Wildlife\n\n• Do not stack rocks. Stacking rocks disrupts many species of river life.\n\n• Dish water and shower water is grey water! Reduce your use and only dump in\n\ngrey water collection tanks\n\n• Secure all trash and compost from animals\n\n• Puddles and standing water will attract MOSQUITOES\n\n• Stay on trails to avoid damage to food sources\n\n• No matter how cute they are, please do not pet or feed the deer\n\nFIVE: Embrace the Collaborative Spirit – Volunteer\n\n• Clean as you go so EXODUS is easier\n\n• MOOP sweep your site every day\n\n• Sort waste to make disposal easier at home\n\n• Pack it in, pack it out\n\n• Volunteer! Help us MOOP sweep various times throughout and after the event.\n\n• Remember, “if it didn’t come from your body, it doesn’t belong in the potty.”\n\nHAVE A SPILL? CONTACT LNT, WE WILL COME TO ASSIST\n\nSign up for a volunteer shift with LNT!\n\nPurpose: To address the health and safety of participants at Critical Northwest from the risks of respiratory viruses in a congregate setting.\n\nPolicy: Critical Northwest recommends that all participants participate in recommended vaccinations by the CDC based on age and risk factors. These include COVID and Influenza vaccination for the general population. This may include RSV and Pneumococcal vaccination in susceptible populations (those who have been privileged to age, those with impaired immune functioning).\n\nIndividuals who develop a fever of 100.4 degrees or greater AND upper respiratory symptoms such as congestion, shortness of breath, cough, or runny nose will be asked to return home and advised to seek medical care, as some infections such as COVID and influenza can benefit from antiviral treatments to reduce severity and duration.\n\nA person recovering from an upper respiratory infection should not attend Critical Northwest until they have been fever free (without fever reducing medications) for 24 hours and their symptoms are improving. These persons should wear a mask in congregate settings for 5 days (120 hours). We generally do not recommend returning to Critical Northwest after being asked to leave due to respiratory illness, but requests can be evaluated on a case by case basis. This may require release by a health provider, COVID testing results, commitment to mask wearing and a care plan in the case of symptom return/worsening.\n\nIf you become symptomatic with respiratory illness (fever of 100.4 degrees or greater AND upper respiratory symptoms such as congestion, shortness of breath, cough, or runny nose) the week before coming to the event and are unable to transfer your ticket, the INW Board will roll over your ticket to the 2025 event if you send an email to covid@ignitionnw.org prior to 11:59pm on Wednesday July 17, 2024, describing your symptoms and affirming that respiratory illness is the reason you are unable to participate.\n\nWe recognize that our presence impacts the land. We acknowledge that all actions leave traces, and we can decide what traces we do leave. Stewardship is more than just not harming our environment, it’s actively working to support its resilience and its ability to support us and others.\n\nEnvironmental stewardship is the use and protection of natural environments in responsible ways. This includes conservation and sustainable practices. The ultimate goal is to enhance ecosystem resilience, while simultaneously enhancing human well-being.\n\nResilience is the ability of an ecosystem to respond to a disturbance or change and recover, ideally back to its original state or function. Human activities have a profound effect on ecosystems. How can we be in line with these principles as we play at Critical NW?\n\nThe Stewardship team works closely with the caretakers of the Masons Family Campground to adjust the natural environment to fit the human needs AND work with the environment. We are working on invasive plant removal and tree planting to replace the diseased Hemlocks with Western Red Cedar in hopes to sustain the tree canopy. In partnership with the Masons caretakers and community we strive to protect and enhance the environmental assets.\n\nFire performers interested in spinning fire at Critical NorthWest will need to register prior to the event (registration will be posted in June). Performers are required to attend a safety class prior to lighting up at the event, and these will be posted & held at Fire Camp multiple times during the week. Ignited performances are only permitted in the performance area, at fire safety approved spaces, or with a fire safety lead present.\n\nPersonal fire insurance will NOT be required for individual performers, as INW was able to procure event insurance which includes this coverage. We look forward to lighting up and burning safely with you!!!\n\nAre you interested in joining the Critical Conclave and spinning before the Effigy burn on FRIDAY night?! Are you a performer who wants to join the open burns? Got poi and want to light it on fire?! Then let us know!\n\nCriticalNW Producers and the Fire Art Safety Team [F.A.S.T.] Leads are providing performance fuel and dip station for you once again this year! Required Safety Meeting for any who wish to perform or open burn, Wednesday & Friday @3pm at Fire Camp. Safeties will be provided by F.A.S.T. for Conclave performances and Effigy Burn on FRIDAY night, performers are expected to help safety during open burn times with at least 1 member (or designee) from F.A.S.T. present.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: DUE TO UPDATED INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS, ALL PARTICIPANTS WHO WANT TO BURN, MUST PRE-REGISTER BY FILLING OUT THIS FORM BEFORE THE EVENT AND ATTEND AT LEAST ONE OF THE F.A.S.T. SAFETY MEETINGS OR YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO BURN.\n\nRegister to be a Fire Performer here!\n\nThe Artist Support & Grants leads assist with coordinating & communicating with those who have submitted Art that has been placed, help ensure artists have requested the right amount of space, power, and/or any heavy equipment needed for them to succeed, and make sure all the granted art gets documented & photographed so we can show the community what beautiful / interesting / exciting things you helped fund. These leads ensure granted artists have submitted the necessary information to obtain placement for granted art, have a space coordinated for their granted (and non-granted) workshops to be held, and that they are aware of the deadlines and expectations associated with their Grants. This role collaborates heavily with the INW Art Grants Committee, Spacement, and DPW teams.\n\nAdditional Role Requirements:\n\nServe on the INW Grants Committee and communicate pertinent information to artists & Spacement"
