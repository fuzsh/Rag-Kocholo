        "text": "Mechanical devises that consist of two electrical contacts that control when current flows through the primary winding. When the contacts close, the electrical circuit is complete and current flows through the primary winding. However, when the contacts open, the circuit is interrupted, and the magnetic field surrouding the primary winding collapses. As the magnetic field collapses, current is induced into the secondary winding\n\nA distributor directs high voltage current produced by the ignition coil to the spark plugs.\n\nThe distributor consists of a rotating finger and a distributor block. As it rotates, the finger distributes power from the coil to the contacts mounted in the distribution block. From there, the energy passes through an ignition lead to a spark plug.\n\nA permenent-magnet alternating current (AC) generator that use electromagnetic and induced current to develop a pulse of high voltage electricity to fire a spark plug.\n\nMagneto systems are classified as either high-tension or low-tension\n\nThe earliest high-tension systems experienced a problem called flashover. What is a flashover and what can it lead to?\n\nWhat two methods are use to prevent it?\n\nThe rotating magnet in a magneto turns between two pole shoes. To complete a circuit, each pole shoe is joined at one end to the magneto coil core. What are the pole shoes and coil core constructed from?\n\nWhen a pair of poles aligns with the shoes, lines of flux flow through the coil core.\n\nThis position is known as what?\n\nWhat degree angle is this?\n\nFull register position\n\nIn this position the magnetic field is strongest and the density of flux lines is greatest\n\nThis would either be the 0 degree or 180 degree position when the current flow is changing direction\n\nAs a magnet rotates beyond full register, the magnetic field slowly collapses until no lines of flux pass through the coil core.\n\nWhat is this position called?\n\nWhat angle is this?\n\nEfficiency Gap\n\nThe specific number of degrees the rotating magnet is beyond the neutral position.\n\nThe magnetic circuit is designed to hold the flux in the core at the highest possiable value until the rotating magnet reaches its neutral position. After the magnet rotates beyond neutral, a magnetic field of opposite polarity begins to build. At this point, the greatest magnetic stress exists. This is the E-gap angle.\n\nDirects current that is coming from the secondary winding to the distributor rotor. It is mounted in the center of the distributor rotor. From the distributor rotor, current passes to the distributor block through a distributor finger.\n\nArching is the gap between the two breaker points. It is an issue because as the points begin to seperate, the electrical resistance between the two points produces enough heat to ionize the air, now allowing current to travel through the air, and can get hot enough to weld the two point together.\n\nBy installing an compacitor in parallel with the breaker points, as the breaker points begin to open, the compasitor absorbs the electrons and prevents the arching from occuring\n\nBecause the ignition switch is wired in parallel with the breaker points, switching it to OFF shorts the breaker points and grounds the primary coil, preventing the magnetic field in the primary winding from collapsing and inducing current into the second winding.\n\nBasically, both P-Leads are grounded\n\nSet engine between 1500 and 1700 RPM\n\nMove switch from BOTH to LEFT - This causes the right magneto to become grounded and a slight drop in RPM\n\nReturn to BOTH\n\nMove switch from BOTH to RIGHT - This causes the left magneto to become grounded and a slight drop in RPM\n\nReturn to BOTH\n\nIf at anytime the RPM drops to zero, there is a short between the magneto and the ignition switch\n\nBecause the ignition event normally occurs before top dead center of the compression stroke, normal ignition timing can cause an engine to kick back during start. To prevent this, some magnetos use a set of _____to delay the spark during engine starting.\n\nThis item is widely used to augment low speed ignition from magnetos. It is wound up by the magneto drive gear and then released, providing a momentary increase in rotational speed while delaying the spark.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWhat is the name of the three components?\n\nIf there is no RPM drop during during a magneto check, what could be the problem?\n\nWere of the cam follower\n\nCauses timer to retard - opens late closes sooner\n\nWere of the breaker points\n\nCauses timer to advance - opens early and closes late.\n\nWith bendix, you must adjust and set the points before you join the case halves and a slick magneto uses a timing pin or e-gap guage to lock the magnet in place\n\nSynchronized ignition timing - fires both spark plugs in each cylinder at the same time\n\nStaggered ignition timing - fires the two spark plugs in each cylinder at slightly different times.\n\nWhat is used to accurately identify that the piston is top dead center?\n\nWhat is the alternative?\n\nLycoming - front side of flywheel\n\nTCM engines - on the propeller mounting flange or an internal gear."
