        "text": "When you purchased or leased your vehicle, your vehicle may have been equipped with an active Connected Services system which operates by collecting data from you and your vehicle, including vehicle location, vehicle health and driving data, to support navigation assistance, emergency services, remote engine start, maintenance alerts, infotainment apps and more.\n\nBy purchasing or leasing a vehicle equipped with an active Connected Services system, you specifically consent to our electronic collection and use of your vehicle data and account information and our storage of such data wherever we designate. Under certain circumstances, such as prior to providing particular vehicle data to other parties for their own purposes, we may also provide you separate notice and obtain consent regarding certain processing activities. You are in control over the Connected Services system. You can choose to opt-out of Connected Services. You can also request deactivation of data transmission, which disables our collection and use of vehicle data and certain account information.\n\nSafety Connect. Your vehicle's Safety Connect feature provides roadside and emergency assistance, automatic collision notifications, stolen vehicle assistance and accident advisory services. Safety Connect uses your vehicle's Location Data to determine where your vehicle needs assistance, your Vehicle Information (such as your vehicle's model, year, and VIN) to verify your vehicle type, your Vehicle Health Data (odometer readings) to assist if you submit a claim with your insurer, your Voice Recordings (when you call our Response Center) for quality assurance, and your Account Information (such as your name, address, phone number, email address, etc.) to verify your account.\n\nService Connect. Your vehicle's Service Connect feature uses your Vehicle Health Data (such as odometer readings, fuel level, oil life battery health, and diagnostic trouble codes) and your Account Information to send you vehicle health reports, alert you of needed maintenance, and for service-related marketing.\n\nRemote Connect. Certain Remote Connect services such as vehicle finder, vehicle status, remote door lock and unlock, guest driver monitor, and vehicle alerts use your vehicle's Location Data to find your vehicle and Vehicle Health Data to provide status updates as well as facilitate repairs.\n\nNavigation. Your vehicle's navigation feature (such as Drive Connect) allows you to choose a place of interest, a location on a map, one of your favorites, a destination from your history, or enter an address or coordinates (latitude and longitude). For certain vehicles, the navigation feature is supported by Google. In certain vehicles, navigation includes the Destination Assist program, which connects you with a live agent to provide navigation directions. Your vehicle's Location Data, Profile Data (such as in-vehicle preferences, favorites, and usage history), and your Account Information are used to verify your account and to offer these features.\n\nWi-Fi Connectivity. Certain vehicles offer a trial of Wi-Fi connectivity (such as Wi-Fi Connect, a service offered by AT&T), which provides up to ten compatible devices with in-vehicle wireless connectivity. If you opt-in, these services may use your Voice Recordings, Location Data., Vehicle Information, Device Data, and Account Information. Use of Wi-Fi connectivity services are subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the applicable service provider.\n\nSiriusXM®.

Use of this service is subject to the SiriusXM® terms and conditions and privacy policy.\n\nClean Assist. Owners of eligible vehicles may choose via the Toyota app to opt-in to the Clean Assist program, through which Toyota is participating in environmental initiatives, such as the California Air Resources Board's Low Carbon Fuel Standard program to reduce California transportation emissions. If you opt-in, your Vehicle Health Data, your vehicle's Location Data, and your Account Information will be used in order for Toyota to match the electricity from your vehicle charging with eligible incentive programs, such as California- sourced Renewable Energy Certificates.\n\nDigital Key. Digital Key technology allows you to access (e.g., unlock, lock, start) your vehicle through the Toyota app. When you bring your smartphone close to your vehicle, the app authenticates an encryption key before performing a vehicle function (e.g., unlock, lock, start). Your Account Information is used to offer this feature.\n\nToyota Safety SenseTM. Vehicles equipped with Toyota Safety SenseTM use sensor and/or image data (in Version 3.0 or later) from the vehicle's exterior to provide safety features such as lane departure alerts and pedestrian detection. If you have a vehicle equipped with Toyota Safety SenseTM, the feature may use your Vehicle Health Data and your vehicle's Location Data. If you have a vehicle equipped with Toyota Safety SenseTM (Version 3.0 or later) and you opt-in to External Vehicle Video Capture , the feature may also use Exterior Image Data.\n\nTeammateTM. Vehicles equipped with TeammateTM use sensor and/or image data from the vehicle's interior and exterior to evaluate the vehicle's surroundings in order to propose and perform certain automated driving operations, including but not limited to: steering, acceleration, and braking on the highway; hands-free parking; and emergency stopping. If you have a vehicle equipped with TeammateTM, the feature may use your Vehicle Health Data, your vehicle's Location Data, Interior Image Data, and Exterior Image Data.\n\nExternal Vehicle Video Capture. Owners of certain vehicles equipped with Toyota Safety SenseTM (Version 3.0 or later) may also opt-in to participate in External Vehicle Video Capture, which uses sensors and/or image data from the vehicle's exterior to help improve automated driving operations and safety features for Toyota vehicles, as well as to develop high-definition maps.

If you have a vehicle equipped with Rear-Seat Reminder, the feature may use your vehicle’s Location Data and Interior Image Data.\n\nBattery Health Usage Services. Owners of certain battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles may opt-in to participate in select Battery Health Usage Services, in order to receive a battery health assessment for the electric vehicle. If you opt-in, your Vehicle Information and Vehicle Health Data will be used to evaluate your vehicle’s battery state of health.\n\nMileage Accuracy. For certain battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, your vehicle's Mileage Accuracy feature enables you to review your vehicle's distance traveled on the multimedia screen, in addition to your vehicle's odometer. Your Milage Accuracy indicator on the multimedia screen may be more accurate than the odometer. Your Vehicle Health Data and Multimedia Screen Data will be used to provide this feature.\n\nUsage-Based Auto Insurance. You may choose to opt-in for usage-based insurance products and services. If you opt-in, your Driving Data (such as your vehicle's acceleration, speed, braking and steering) and Location Data will be used to deliver usage-based insurance services to you, and for quality assurance, analysis, research, and product development.\n\nFace Identification. Certain vehicles equipped with an interior, driver-facing camera use sensor and/or image data from the vehicle's interior to scan your face when you open the vehicle's door. If you opt-in and link your user profile using the in-vehicle “Setup Face” process, the Face Identification feature may use your Facial Geometric Features and Profile Data to verify your identity and load your saved user profile on the vehicle. Your Facial Geometric Features will only be stored on your vehicle and are not transmitted to Toyota.\n\nLast Load Profile. Owners of certain vehicles may choose to create and save multiple user profiles on the vehicle. If you choose to save a user profile on your vehicle, the Last Load Profile feature will use your Profile Data and Account Information to reload the last saved user profile at vehicle start.\n\nExternal Device Mirroring. If you use device mirroring services, such as Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, your mobile devices may be capable of mirroring on to the vehicle's multimedia screen. During this process, in order for the device mirroring services to function, your vehicle may transmit Location Data, Driving Data, Multimedia Screen Data, Remote Data and Vehicle Health Data to your mobile device.\n\nIntegrated Streaming.
