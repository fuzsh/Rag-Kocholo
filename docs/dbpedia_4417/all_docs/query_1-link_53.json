Like the new faceplate that comes with the switch but I didnt need it as my panel is still in great shape.\n\nBrian W\n\nno comment\n\nPhilippe M\n\nThis order was satisfactory, not rescheduled like others.\n\nAirborne I\n\nReplaced my 15 year old switch. Exact replacement. Wiring diagram and diode included. Arrived quickly.\n\nTom R\n\ndelivered on time, Thanks !!\n\nBurt R\n\nIt was what we ordered and was delivered in a timely manner.\n\nJohn S\n\nWorks as advertised.\n\nTom J\n\nworks same as other I had … was hoping it was bad switch ,,,, now have mag on order... oh well\n\nStephen\n\nPerfect part for my intended use.\n\nEmilio V\n\nPerfect replacement, great value.\n\nRandal A\n\nYour staff helped me feel confident I was ordering the right item\n\nRichard V\n\nMuch better construction and operation than the Bendix/TCM switch at less than half the cost. My starter was slowing. The Bendix switch was the culprit.\n\nBen T\n\nWorks as it should. Decent price as far as aviation parts go. They always have these in stock as well.\n\nFlightschoolguy\n\nThis switch sooo much better than the switch that was in my 46 Stinson. Operates smoothly and easily.\n\nCurtis\n\nJust what I needed for my panel. I like the all in one simplicity.\n\nRichard C\n\nThe right part arrived on time and works as represented. Cant ask for more than that.\n\nAlan B\n\nNot installed yet, but looks very robust and the key clicks into quite distinct positions.\n\nGlen B\n\nTried an auto style switch first (for much less money) and ran into problems. Remembered that I had an ACS switch like this in another plane that has been working well for 12+ years and came to the conclusion that the extra expense just might be worth it. This version of the ignition switch is rugged and works well - even with dual electronic ignitions. Just wish it didnt cost so much - hence the 4 start rating :-)\n\nDavid L\n\nStraightforwad, certified and best of all matched my previous switch quite closely. If you’re like me, you will never again go without backing up your keys. It took 2hrs scrunched with head on rudder pedals (remove the seat first, makes everything so much easier!). Only 4 stars because damn, this is expensive!!! If it were for a car expect it would couldn’t 10% of this price.\n\nTim C\n\nThe screws provided are very short and when you have to place multiple terminal ends on one connection (ground wire and 2 shielded wires from the P leads onto the 1 ground stud) they are inadequate. If we had not had longer screws leftover from a previous install (from a Bendix unit) wed have had an issue completing the installation. Performance of the switch is as expected with very positive yet smooth movement from Both to Left and Right mag positions when accomplishing a mag check.\n\nJoseph C\n\nVERY IMPORTANT!!! The instructions do not tell you that if you have an engine with two impulse couplings then you must remove the jumper that is installed on terminal 1. If you dont remove the jumper then the right mag will be grounded out while starting. The instructions/schematic only says that the jumper is required when you have an impulse on the left magneto. THeres no mention ANYWHERE of what to do when you have two impulse couplings. I wasted an hour of my time between triple checking the schematic and trying to get a person from ACS tech support on the phone. Now I have an extremely pissed off customer\n\nAviation M\n\nunfortunately we received 2 ignition switch without the label\n\nMir.mat G Verified Purchase\n\nIGNITION SWITCH A-510-2\n\nReplaced the first one that broke.. seems sloppy but works fine.\n\nBrandon E\n\nSwitch is fine. Reason I gave 3 stars is because of the key. You can not have one made unless you go thru their manufacturer. I tried 6 places and even checked a locksmith who said he doesn’t have and can’t get the blank as it if foreign from overseas. So I ordered thru ACS and it cost about $35 for one key with mandatory drop ship and shipping UPS and tax. If you have to have another key order 2 as it will be only an additional $8. Also was told about 3 week lag time? This **** ain’t right as Willy Nelson once said.\n\nJack"
