        "text": "Hello,\n\nHere is my distributor wiring set up. I need to confirm where the 2 pink wires from the harness go on the Ignition switch. From what I understand, the coil has to be energized when the ignition switch is turned to the IGN position. But when the motor fires up, and the ignition switch returns back to ACC position, how does the coil continue to remain energized? I have the sketch below.\n\nthanks,\n\nAndy\n\nOlder ignition systems used a ballast resistor to limit coil current in the primary. When cranking, a separate wire, usually part of the starter solenoid circuit, by passed the ballast resistor giving more coil current when starting.\n\nAs your note says, you don't need any of this resistor stuff, and your IGN terminal should power the coil on and off, is all, via the appropriate fuse\n\nACC has nothing to do with the ignition circuit\n\nYes, my ignition switch is something like what you're describing.\n\nKey up- everything shutdown\n\nKey left -accessories come on\n\nKey right -accessories come on\n\nFar right - spring loaded ignition\n\nI just went down to the garage and checked.The ignition switch is hot when it gets back to \"RUN\" position from \"IGN\".\n\nNow begs the question, which of the 2 pink wires goes to which terminal on the Ignition switch.\n\nthanks again!\n\nReally need to know the labeling on the 2 pink wires. Neither of them sounds familiar. Trace the pink wire from the coil (what is its label); it wouldn't surprise me if it is the pink wire labeled IGN SW COIL, in which case I'd hook it to the IGN post. Then trace the other pink wire and see where it goes. Let us know.\n\nIs there a wire from the harness to the battery? Gotta get power somehow.\n\nOnly thing I can guess is : 1 pink wire [ign./coil ] goes from switch to coil while the other [ign/engine] means starter to coil ??? [which would br impossible w/ a 2 terminal starter !! [aftermarket non gm]\n\ndave\n\nHmmm. The wiring harness comes with 2 plugs, one clear plastic, and another Black plastic.\n\nThe Black plastic has the IGN SW Engine wire going to it. Another wire is a Red power wire, that is split between the black plug, and the clear plastic plug.\n\nThe clear plastic has the IGN SW Coil pink wire running to it. As you said, this wire is for the coil, that makes complete sense.\n\nI unmounted the fuse block, and traced the pink wires back to it, and it so happens that both these pink wires originate from one single 30A fuse . It looks like, I have to ignore the 2 wires in the black plastic plug- either strap then under the dash, or cut them off and \"blind\" crimp the wires.\n\nthanks,\n\nAndy\n\nReally need to know the labeling on the 2 pink wires.

Gotta get power somehow.\n\nYep, there is another wire that goes from the fuse block to the (+) side of the coil. This is how the coil gets power.\n\nThe entire fuse block has a thick red wire leading out of it. This is definitely not a 10 Ga, but a lot thicker. I've confirmed this is the power wire during the course of the wiring. The headlights are not hot if I don't connect this wire to the battery.\n\nI did trace the 2 pink wires, and I've described it in my reply to David's post here .\n\nThanks,\n\nAndy\n\nOK folks. Some old fashioned testing has given me some answers. The only flip side of the issue is that I had to unmount the fuse block to make sure that I know where the wires go. Here is my new Coil wiring diagram after I tested it with a multimeter.\n\nNot sure, why the fuel pump wire is named IGN SW Coil, but I guess the manufacturer decided to reuse a piece of wire from his bin and forgot to alter the labelling\n\nAndy\n\nYou may have this issue covered and I could not confirm by your diagram, but the fuel pump needs to be key on activated or on a switch. I am sure you have or will address this as you would not want it hot all the time. Also you may consider a high amp fuse link coming off the battery before the switch and fuse panel. Autos ran without these for years, but it could save you a melt down if something did go wrong. Never mind, saw your other post and looks like you are doing good on all bases. good job.\n\nMercy, that is one strange harness. Wonder where the the two plugs were supposed to go?\n\nYou might consider taking the 12v main power from the ACC post of the ignition switch instead of from the battery. That way, all power is off when the key is off. Otherwise everything (lights, horn, wipers, radio, death ray) would still be operational.\n\nYou may have this issue covered and I could not confirm by your diagram, but the fuel pump needs to be key on activated or on a switch.

I'm glad that my work is being vetted by so many experienced members here!\n\nAndy\n\nMercy, that is one strange harness.

At this point in time, this circuit is soft wired. I can change this from the BATT to the ACC.\n\nBut one question? The universal ignition switch has very stubby terminals. I don't think a single terminal can hold more than 2 wires.\n\nI could use a distribution block but the space under my dash is already full with a fuse block, an ignition coil,and 5 relays. How do I get around this issue?\n\nthanks\n\nAndy"
