        "text": "The design of a conventional ignition coil is basically similar to that of a transformer. The ignition coil's task is to induce a high voltage from a low voltage. Alongside the iron core, the main components are the primary winding, the secondary winding, and the electrical connections.\n\nThe laminated iron core has the task of amplifying the magnetic field. A thin secondary winding is placed around this iron core. This is made of insulated copper wire about 0.05-0.1 mm thick, wound around up to 50,000 times. The primary winding is made of coated copper wire about 0.6-0.9 mm thick, and is wound over the secondary winding. The ohmic resistance of the coil is around 0.2–3.0 Ω on the primary side and around 5–20 kΩ on the secondary side. The winding ratio of primary to secondary winding is 1:100. The technical structure may vary depending on the ignition coil's area of application. In the case of a conventional cylinder ignition coil, the electrical connections are designated as terminal 15 (voltage supply), terminal 1 (contact breaker), and terminal 4 (high-voltage connection).\n\nThe primary winding is connected to the secondary winding via a common winding connection to terminal 1. This common connection is known as the \"economy circuit,\" and is used to simplify coil production. The primary current flowing through the primary winding is switched on and off via the contact breaker. The amount of current flowing is determined by the coil's resistance and the voltage applied at terminal 15. The very fast current direction caused by the contact breaker changes the magnetic field in the coil and induces a voltage pulse, which is transformed into a high-voltage pulse by the secondary winding. This passes through the ignition cable to the spark plug's spark gap and ignites the fuel-air mixture in a gasoline engine.\n\nThe amount of high voltage induced depends on the speed of change in the magnetic field, the number of windings on the secondary coil, and the strength of the magnetic field. The opening induction voltage of the primary winding is between 300 and 400 V. The high voltage on the secondary coil can be up to 40 kV, depending on the ignition coil.\n\nIn systems with single-spark ignition coils, one ignition coil with a primary and secondary winding is assigned to each cylinder. These ignition coils are usually installed directly at the cylinder head, above the spark plug.\n\nThese coils are also connected to the primary winding at terminal 15 (voltage supply plus), and to the electronic control unit at terminal 1 (ground). The secondary winding is connected to the spark plug at the output of terminal 4. If there is also a terminal 4b, this connection is used to monitor misfiring. Triggering takes place according to the sequence specified by the electronic control unit.\n\nA single-spark coil's circuit corresponds to that of a conventional ignition coil. In addition to this, a high-voltage diode is used in the secondary circuit to suppress the \"closing spark.\" This diode suppresses the unwanted spark produced when the primary winding is switched on as a result of the self-induction in the secondary winding. This is possible because the secondary voltage of the closing spark has opposite polarity to the ignition spark. The diode blocks in this direction.\n\nFor single-spark coils, the second output of the secondary winding is routed to ground via terminal 4b. A measuring resistor is installed in the ground wire to monitor ignition; this provides the electronic control unit with a measurement of the drop in voltage caused by the ignition current during sparkover.\n\nThere are different ways of checking the ignition coil:\n\nTesting the resistance values of the coils using the ohmmeter.\n\nDepending on the ignition system and ignition coil design, the following reference values apply: (observe the manufacturer's specifications)\n\nCylinder ignition coil (transistor ignition system)\n\nPrimary: 0.5 Ω–2.0 Ω/Secondary: 8.0 kΩ–19.0 kΩ\n\nCylinder ignition coil (electronic ignition system with map-controlled ignition)\n\nPrimary: 0.5 Ω–2.0 Ω/Secondary: 8.0 kΩ–19.0 kΩ\n\nSingle-spark or dual-spark ignition coil (fully electronic ignition system)\n\nPrimary: 0.3 Ω–1.0 Ω/Secondary: 8.0 kΩ–15.0 kΩ\n\nThe following checks can be used:\n\nVisual inspection\n\nCheck the ignition coil for mechanical damage\n\nCheck the housing for hairline cracks and sealant leaks.\n\nCheck the electrical wiring and plug connections for damage and oxidation.\n\nCheck the electrics using a multimeter or oscilloscope\n\nCheck the voltage supply to the ignition coil\n\nCheck the triggering signal from the ignition distributor, ignition control unit, or engine control unit\n\nIllustration of the high-voltage curve using an oscilloscope or ignition oscilloscope\n\nTesting with the diagnostic unit\n\nRead out the fault memory of the ignition system or engine control\n\nRead out parameters\n\nDuring all testing work on the ignition system, please note that faults established during tests with the oscilloscope are not necessarily faults caused by the electronic system; they can also be caused by a mechanical problem in the engine. This may be the case, for example, if compression is too low in one cylinder, which means the oscilloscope shows the ignition voltage for this cylinder to be lower than that of the other cylinders.\n\nWe would like to demonstrate the diagnostics procedure for a dual-spark ignition coil using the following example, \"misfiring\".\n\nVehicle: Alfa Romeo 147 1.6 TS with dual-spark ignition\n\nEach cylinder has a main plug and a secondary plug. The ignition coils are triggered by the ignition output stages integrated in the engine control unit. In this example, the repair procedure is shown using a Mega Macs diagnostic unit. The schematic illustrations, figures, and descriptions are intended solely as explanations of the document text, and cannot be used as the basis for carrying out installation and repair work.\n\nCondition for diagnostics work: Engine mechanics, battery, starting system, and fuel system OK."
