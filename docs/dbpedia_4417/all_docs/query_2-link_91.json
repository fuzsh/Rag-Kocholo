        "text": "Fire management\n\nThe principal aim of fire management is to reduce the risk that fire poses to life, property, infrastructure and environmental, economic, cultural, agricultural and community assets.\n\nThe approach to bushfire risk management in NSW is coordinated on a multi-agency basis. The planning and prioritisation process is a highly strategic exercise intended to achieve the best possible protection outcomes with the resources available and limited windows of opportunity. While the legal obligation to carry out designated hazard reduction rests with the landowner or manager, the NSW RFS provides assistance in undertaking hazard reduction works.\n\nWhere bushfire risk reduction requires high modification to vegetation, environmental assessments are conducted to understand the impacts of the intended works and manage the biodiversity risks. However, compromises that result in suboptimal outcomes for biodiversity conservation may be required at times (DEC 2005), particularly in asset protection zones (see Table 22.2). Appropriate assessment is undertaken on a case-by-case basis in these circumstances.\n\nSustainable fire regimes aim to maintain and improve conservation outcomes, as outlined in the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974. Improved fire metrics incorporating inputs such as fire severity and frequency in representative ecosystems, are being developed currently by NPWS and research partners. This work will better inform conservation land managers on the appropriate application of fire regimes, particularly post 2019–20 bushfire impacts.\n\nCultural burning\n\nAmongst the recommendations put forward by both the NSW Bushfire Inquiry and the Royal Commission was that cultural burning is but one component of a larger practice of Caring for Country, and Aboriginal people should be supported to pursue Caring for Country as holistic practice. The NSW Government has formally adopted this policy.\n\nDPIE is coordinating a statewide response to the bushfire inquiry including developing a NSW cultural burning strategy. This strategy, designed under the stewardship of an expert Aboriginal cultural burning advisory group, will develop a set of guidelines and principles for cultural burning on NSW lands, including cross-tenure land management.\n\nBushfire Risk Management framework\n\nA comprehensive bush fire risk management framework currently exists in NSW, supported by legislation and the Bush Fire Coordinating Committee (BFCC) Policy. This framework provides for the development of Bush Fire Risk Management Plans by the multi-agency Bush Fire Management Committees (BFMC) set up throughout the State. There have been significant recent advances in technology, fire spread modelling, quantitative risk assessment and the availability of spatial data, which will inform the development of an enhanced bush fire risk management framework for NSW.\n\nIn response to the Final Report of the NSW Bush Fire Inquiry, the process of rolling out the next generation of Bush Fire Risk Management Plans across NSW commenced in 2021. It will allow BFMCs to better focus on prioritising treatments and protecting community assets from bush fire. The development process is interactive and includes a series of BFMC meetings and workshops, facilitated by the NSW Rural Fire Service and supported by National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and Forestry Corporation of NSW. The complete roll out of the new generation plans is expected to be a three-year program.\n\nHazard reduction\n\nHazard reduction is an important risk management strategy that helps address the threat of fire for people living in over 1.4 million properties situated on 48 million hectares of bushfire-prone land across NSW. It is part of a multi-faceted strategy for managing bushfire risk that also includes building design, defendable space, community education and fire suppression.\n\nWithin that context, the specific objective of hazard reduction works is to reduce fuel loading to a manageable level, with a view to generally reducing the spread and intensity of bushfire. Importantly, hazard reduction – no matter how comprehensive – does not (and cannot) eliminate bushfire risk entirely.\n\nHazard reduction works include a range of treatment methods which may be employed either in isolation or together. The principal treatment methods are prescribed burning and mechanical or manual removal of fuels using heavy machinery, hand-held tools and/or spraying. It may also involve other methods including, for example, grazing.\n\nThe ability of NSW RFS and partner agencies including NPWS, Forestry Corporation of NSW, Fire and Rescue NSW and Local Councils to complete hazard reduction works (particularly prescribed burning) is highly dependent on weather, with opportunities consequently limited and unpredictable. Longer fire seasons have further reduced the opportunities for hazard reduction burning in recent years and prolonged drought conditions have also complicated the conduct of prescribed burning as drier fuel loads trigger more erratic fire behaviour.\n\nNevertheless, to make the best use of all available windows of opportunity for hazard reduction burns, the NSW RFS and land management agencies conduct strategic preparatory work to ensure maximum readiness when the weather is favourable.\n\nBush Fire Environmental Assessment Code\n\nThe updated Bush Fire Environmental Assessment Code (NSW RFS 2021) provides a streamlined environmental assessment and approval process for bushfire hazard reduction works. Assessments under the code consider the impacts of prescribed burning and mechanical works on natural values, including vegetation, threatened species, heritage items, soil stability, and air and water quality.\n\nMinimum fire intervals for vegetation formations (see Table 22.2) and threatened species guidelines are both incorporated as standards for the protection of biodiversity.\n\nEnhanced Bushfire Management Program\n\nThe Enhanced Bushfire Management Program (EBMP) in 2011 was funded by the NSW Government in response to the findings of the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission to prepare for a potential increase in the threat of bushfires. Although originally funded until 2017 with a commitment of $76 million, the program has since been extended to 2022 with a further $92 million commitment.\n\nThe program aims to increase the level of hazard reduction works conducted annually and improve bushfire response capability in parks and reserves. A key component is the establishment of teams across the state to conduct hazard reduction works and respond quickly to outbreaks of fire in remote areas.\n\nSince the start of the Enhanced Bushfire Management Program in 2011, and specifically between 2012–13 and 2020–21, NPWS has undertaken 79% of the total hazard reduction burning in NSW, often in collaboration with NSW RFS and other agencies. (The overall total excludes stubble grass burning by private landholders on non-fire management zoned private tenure during the 2020–21 fire season). Consistent with the NSW Bushfire Inquiry’s recommendation to adopt an approach that is strongly guided by risk reduction, the current NPWS hazard reduction program is focused on reducing fuel in the areas of highest risk: strategic fire advantage zones and asset protection zones.\n\nFire access and fire trails\n\nNPWS manages a fire trail network with around 40,000 kilometres of roads and trails, including over 31,148 kilometres of fire trails that are used for hazard reduction work and bushfire suppression activities. During 2020–21, NPWS delivered $30 million of fire trail upgrades and maintenance, resulting in 618 kilometres and 20 bridges upgraded to standards and a further 2,110 kilometres maintained to ensure open and safe access. These improvements ensure safety, strengthen the capability of firefighters to combat bushfires and ensure that emergency services personnel have improved access to protect homes and properties.\n\nForestry Corporation of NSW manages road and fire trial network of 60,000 kilometres and makes significant annual investment in maintaining its network.\n\nRapid response to remote area bushfire ignitions\n\nThe early detection and rapid suppression of bushfires is a key control strategy for managing and preventing their spread, particularly when fires start in remote areas. To enable a rapid response and minimise the spread of fires, special remote area fire teams (RAFT) and rapid aerial response teams (RART) have been set up by the NSW RFS and the NPWS as part of EBMP. The RART have specially trained and equipped personnel with dedicated helicopters on standby to enhance the capacity for early detection and rapid suppression of fire.\n\nRemote area and aerial responses are recorded and tracked to measure performance against objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs). The NSW RFS and NPWS teams have KPIs to keep 80% of bushfires to less than 10 hectares in size and respond to 90% of fires within 30 minutes. Since the NPWS RART program began in 2012–13, 91% of all bushfires involving aerial operations have been responded to in less than 30 minutes and 83% of bushfires involving aerial operations have been contained to less than 10 hectares.\n\nSince 2011, 85% of all fires that started on national park land have been contained within the park and 68% of all park fires (with or without aerial operations) were kept to less than 10 hectares in size.\n\nThe NSW Bushfire Inquiry recommended that NPWS and NSW RFS continue the highly successful rapid response program to suppress remote ignitions throughout the landscape.\n\nForestry Corporation NSW manages two million hectares of public land and prioritises early fire detection and rapid response to fires. Forestry Corporation NSW maintains a highly trained firefighting workforce, a network of fire towers and a fleet of light firefighting vehicles, tankers and heavy plant that can be readily deployed to firefighting. Forestry Corporation is also investing in trialing fire detection technology.\n\nEnhanced aviation capability and technology\n\nPrior to 2021, the NSW RFS aviation fleet comprised one Large Air Tanker (LAT) and six helicopters used for aviation search and rescue and fire fighter transportation, including the deployment and extraction of Remote Area Firefighters. In 2021, the fleet was expanded with the addition of two Citation fixed wing aircraft. These fast jets will be used for lead plane operations, scanning and passenger transport, with their scanning capabilities enhancing the integration of these aircraft with LAT operations. Historically, the lead planes’ primary role was to guide the LAT into the retardant drop zone. The Citations will also assist with gathering fire intelligence, impact assessments, search operations and vegetation mapping.\n\nForestry Corporation NSW contracts private aerial firefighting support to be on standby and support initial firefighting response each fire season. Forestry Corporation NSW has also increased the use of drone technology in firefighting over recent years, with thermal imaging drones used to identify, map and monitor fires and enhance data collection and decision making in active firefighting.\n\nPlanning and land use\n\nLand-use planning decisions are intrinsic to fire management and environment protection strategies.\n\nIntegrating protection against bushfires into the planning and development system through compliance with the regulatory framework set out in Planning for Bush Fire Protection (NSW RFS 2019) ensures safer developments in bushfire-prone areas. A revised version of the document was published in 2019, incorporating the latest science and best practice.\n\nStrategies include providing emergency access and evacuation roadways and upgraded water supplies and requiring bushfire protection measures for buildings with developments set back from bushland at the planning stage to protect dwellings from fires. Higher building construction standards may also be adopted to offset the setback distance required.\n\nAs a plantation manager, Forestry Corporation NSW reviewed the fire resilience of timber plantations and developed guidelines for fire-resistant plantation design.\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nCommunity engagement activities and resources are a key component of the bushfire risk management program. The NSW RFS continues to promote ongoing public awareness activities about community preparedness for fires. A new public awareness campaign for the 2021–22 bushfire season highlights the need to plan and prepare for fires and stresses that individual preparation actions are important for the protection of the community as a whole.\n\nLocal engagement continues to be key to the success of communicating risk and improving the levels of engagement, especially through brigade-led activities. One of these is the annual Get Ready Weekend, during which RFS brigades educate their communities about the local bushfire risk and associated actions to make their home safer, as well having a bushfire survival plan ready.\n\nOther community engagement programs include the Hotspots Fire Project with state agencies and non-government organisations providing landholders and land managers with the skills and knowledge they need to protect life and property as well as maintaining biodiversity. The project promotes the understanding that well-informed and prepared communities complement the roles of land managers and fire agencies.\n\nThe NSW RFS AIDER program assists infirm, disabled and elderly residents living in bushfire-prone areas undertake fuel reduction activities.\n\nArson prevention\n\nA range of measures has been implemented to reduce the rate of arson in NSW. Information sharing between agencies responsible for preventing and investigating arson-related fires has vastly improved, through establishment of the Bushfire Arson Taskforce and a whole-of-government intelligence database. The development of cross-agency strategies by arson prevention district working parties has also reduced the incidence of arson-related fires in those areas where they have been detected. NSW will continue to support the National Strategy for the Prevention of Bushfire Arson implemented in 2009.\n\nKnowledge and information\n\nThe Bushfire Risk Management Research Hub for NSW brings together researchers, fire agencies and public land managers to develop new understandings that will underpin cost-effective strategies that reduce the risk fire poses to people, property and the environment.\n\nThe hub’s data repositories and management systems to date have seen updated and consolidated fire histories are available for mapping fire history and fuel load inputs the Phoenix fire simulation software and departmental databases. There have also been updates to the Fauna Fire Response Database and the draft interim Threatened Species Hazard Reduction List that is used by fire management agencies to plan prescribed burns.\n\n‘Guardian’ is replacing the Bushfire Risk Information Management System (BRIMS) and will significantly improve the way all bushfire risk mitigation activities are undertaken. It will also include a public portal that may assist individuals in analysing the risk associated with their property and identifying actions that can be taken to mitigate this risk.\n\nGuardian stores data on fires across the state and is maintained by fire authorities and public land managers. Long-term data on where fires start and how they spread will be invaluable for determining fire management strategies, the allocation of firefighting resources and the prevention of fires caused by arson and accidental ignition. Collated data on prescribed burns will also provide greater insight into how fire history affects fire management and environmental impacts.\n\nAustralian Fire Danger Rating System\n\nTo meet future fire management and communication needs, NSW is leading the development of the Australian Fire Danger Rating System (AFDRS), which is due to be operational for the 2022–23 fire season. The AFDRS uses the latest scientific understanding about weather, fuel and fire behaviour in different types of vegetation to improve the reliability of fire danger forecasts. This enables those working in emergency services to be better prepared, make improved decisions and provide better advice to the community. The system will be adaptable to take advantage of improving science, data, and information into the future.\n\nThe way that the fire danger rating system is presented to the community will be consistent in every state and territory in Australia, reducing the possibility for confusion. The new ratings system will have fewer levels, use logical colours, and simple English terms to improve people’s comprehension of both the system and their personal risk, providing concise messages to encourage people to take action to protect themselves and others in the face of bushfire risks."
