A battery terminal started to smoke and melted the negative terminal on one battery.\n\nI fixed the wiring damage, replaced starter, replaced both batteries, cleaned all remaining terminals and had no power; however, I learned the ignition fuse was popped. Yay, problem found. Nope.\n\nEvery time the fuse was replaced the boat would crank until the ignition was allowed back to the on position were the fuse would pop again.\n\nThen the coil was replaced, ignition key replaced, checked main engine ground (appeared to be in good condition), checked power at the 50amp fuse, and the alternator was bypassed to see if it was causing the fuse to blow.\n\nBut same problem persisted when the key went back to the on position.\n\nBuddy and I are at a loss where to search next for possible short/power surge. Any insight or recommendations are highly appreciated. Thanks.\n\n__________________\n\n__________________\n\nToby Barnett\n\n- 2000, Maxum 2100 SR 5.7 MerCruiser\n\n- 1985, 15ft Zodiac Pro 60hp 2-Stroke Mercury\n\nAdmiral\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2012\n\nLocation: Essex, Maryland\n\nPosts: 10,494\n\nWelcome aboard!\n\nLet’s try to isolate the issue between the cranking circuit and ignition circuit. Try Turing off the kill switch on the shifter which will remove power from the ignition circuit. Does the fuse still blow when cranking the engine over? If yes it’s an issue with the starting circuit if no it’s an issue with the ignition circuit.\n\nUnder Documents of this site you will find the Mercruiser manual for you engine which includes the engine wiring diagram. Let me know if you or your buddy are familiar with reading wiring diagrams and if not I can help you through the next steps.\n\nAlso is this a carburetor or fuel injection engine?\n\n__________________\n\n__________________\n\n1997 Silverton 362, 7.4 Crusaders\n\n1997 2400 SCR, 5.7 Vortec / Bravo 2\n\nMike\n\nEnsign\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2024\n\nLocation: Arlington, WA\n\nPosts: 8\n\nHey Captain Mike,\n\nWe went through the kill switch and it was working correctly then were able to isolate the problem to the engine side. With no real answer, the boat stopped blowing ignition fuses and would start and run for 5 - 30s before shutting off.\n\nWe continued testing was in order with the next being the oil pressure switch, oil pressure sending unit, and fuel pump which all checked out fine.\n\nWe then went back the new starter and the starter appears to have an internal short. The meter was showing short when going from the yellow/purple wire connection to the side of the starter (believe that is what my mechanic was saying as I wasn't down there).\n\nUnless, there are other ideas. I will likely pull the starter tonight and see if anywhere can test it as the boat shop can't from what they said this morning.\n\n__________________\n\nToby Barnett\n\n- 2000, Maxum 2100 SR 5.7 MerCruiser\n\n- 1985, 15ft Zodiac Pro 60hp 2-Stroke Mercury\n\nEnsign\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2024\n\nLocation: Arlington, WA\n\nPosts: 8\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by mmwjr\n\nHi Toby, sounds more like the short is in the starter solenoid but it should have come with the new starter. Most auto places should be able to test it. Any idea if you can return it?\n\nHey Captain,\n\nYes, the short was in the solenoid and the boat shop said they don't test starters yet they replaced it.\n\nInstalled new new starter last night and boat fires up, purrs like a kitten, turns off, doesn't blow fuses, and operates like normal.\n\nI'll stick around the forums and try not to be a one-stop user. Thanks for all your help @mmwjr.\n\n__________________\n\nToby Barnett\n\n- 2000, Maxum 2100 SR 5.7 MerCruiser\n\n- 1985, 15ft Zodiac Pro 60hp 2-Stroke Mercury"
