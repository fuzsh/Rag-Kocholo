Before leaving the driver's seat, always switch the ignition off, set the parking brake, and make sure the selector lever is in P position:

Leaving the driver's seat without switching the ignition off, setting the parking brake, and shifting the selector lever to P position is dangerous. Unexpected vehicle movement could occur which could result in an accident.

In addition, if your intention is to leave the vehicle for even a short period, it is important to switch the ignition off, as leaving it in another position will disable some of the vehicle's security systems and run the battery down.
