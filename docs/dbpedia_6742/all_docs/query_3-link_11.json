        "text": "THE ENVIRONMENT, JBSA-CAMP BULLIS, AND YOU\n\nJoint Base San Antonio-Camp Bullis is located on the edge of the Edwards Plateau Land Resource Area in a hilly region known as the Texas Hill Country, and locally called the Balcones Canyonlands.\n\nThe area is rich in archaeological resources, history, unique geology, and wildlife - both above and below ground. These resources can be threatened by man's activities, but are just as easily preserved. Camp Bullis is in the forefront of local preservation efforts. Not only is it our moral obligation, it is the law!\n\nArchaeological resources include prehistoric Native American campsites - some dating back 8,000 years before present, food processing sites, and quarry sites where chert (flint) could be obtained to manufacture tools and weapons. These are a record of man's past. They contain valuable information about our origins.\n\nHistorical sites date back to the 1860's and can be unique because of their architecture, function, layout, or connection with an historic person or event. Historical events and customs shaped this country, Texas, and Camp Bullis. The preservation of these sites adds to the understanding of where we are and what we have today.\n\nUnique geology in this are includes the Balcones Fault Zone, which resulted in development of the Edwards Aquifer. The Aquifer provides water for over one million people. The City of San Antonio is one of the largest cities in the United States that derives all its water form wells. Water is life. Protection of this valuable resource insures sufficient clean water to support our current and future needs.\n\nRare wildlife above ground includes the endangered golden-cheeked warbler and black-capped vireo. Below ground can be found several invertebrate species currently petitioned for endangered species status. One species, a blind ground beetle, is found only in three caves at JBSA-Camp Bullis - and no other place in the world! Endangered species are sometime referred to a s \"indicator species\". Their presence signals a healthy ecosystem. Their decline or disappearance signals a problem. It is our responsibility to recognize and correct any problems before they become disasters.\n\nThe mission of JBSA-Camp Bullis is military training. This does not mean that we cannot also be good environmental stewards. Since no more \"new land\" is being made, we are realizing that we have to take good care of what we now have if it is to remain viable and supportive of the mission during the future. The Environmental and Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) office, which is a part of the team managing JBSA-Camp Bullis training land, is constantly looking for ways to improve both training and the environmental quality of the installation. This is currently accomplished through ITAM.\n\nExecutive Officer: 295-7644\n\nTraining Operations:\n\nIf storing and using any amount of fuel for training exercises, secondary containment must be used. If assistance is needed please contact the Environmental Office.\n\nEnvironmental Office: (210) 295-7873 or (210) 391-7489\n\nWaste Turn - Ins:\n\nFor any waste turn-ins, please e-mail the environmental office at hwc@amedd.army.mil. Please include the type and amount of waste to be turned in, along with the unit and a POC and phone number in the message. All waste turn-ins must be accompanied by a Material Data Safety Sheet (if applicable), or the waste will not be accepted. If any assistance is needed please contact the Environmental Office.\n\nEnvironmental Office: (210) 295-7873 or (210) 391-7489\n\nHazwaste Procedures:\n\nIf a spill occurs on post, immediately attempt to contain or clean up the spill. After the spill is contained, call the Camp Bullis Environmental Office And the Fire Department. If a spill kit is needed, please contact the Environmental Office.\n\nFire Department (210) 295-7600\n\nEnvironmental Office (210) 295-7873 or (210) 391-7489\n\nSensitive Areas:\n\nObey signs that present a sensitive area such as:\n\n-Endangered Species\n\n-Caves\n\n-Closed Landfills\n\nIgnoring these signs could endanger you or other and my result in police action.\n\nEnvironmental Office (210) 295-7873 or (210) 391-7489\n\nGeneral Information\n\nThe Camp Bullis Outdoor Recreation Program offers the outdoorsman a variety of activities throughout the year. You can enjoy hunting in the fall, winter, and spring, ranging from our spectacular whitetail deer, to our beautiful Rio Grande turkey. Sprinkle in dove, quail, rabbit, squirrel, and Catalina goat and you can pretty much pass eight months out of the year in the woods.\n\nWhen it gets too hot to hunt, cool your heels in our swimming pool turned catfish pond. Stocked with channel catfish, ranging from three to ten pounds, it's bound to get the old adrenalin flowing. But if you really want to get a kick out of it, bring your kids and watch them latch on to a whopper.\n\nIn addition to our hunting and fishing, we offer a pistol, rifle, and shotgun range; an archery range and hunter safety classes in both archery and gun. From January to September we hold monthly 3D archery shoots. In May we also have a wild game dinner that is open to members and their families.\n\nWe have a park with a pavilion, picnic tables, barbeque pits, playgrounds, volleyball courts, and horseshoe pits, and a lodge that is available to rent for your private or unit functions. If you have an RV and can't keep it in your driveway, we can solve that problem too. We have RV storage available. Give us a try. If we don't have what you want and we can't get it, then we will help you find it.\n\nHours of Operation\n\nOur hours of operation will vary with the different hunting seasons. Our normal operating hours are from 0800 to 1600, Friday and Monday and 0700 to 1700 Saturday and Sunday. We close on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. During the deer hunting seasons, we open as early as 0400 and close after dark. For other hunts we will open according to the times necessary to get you in the field by prime time.\n\nPhone\n\nYou may reach us by calling 210-295-7577 or 7529. DSN is 421-7577 or 7529."
