        "text": "The present day Louisiana Air National Guard was originally formed in December 1940 as the 122nd Observation Squadron, a National Guard unit of the then \"US Army Air Corps.” Since its inception, the LA ANG has participated in World War II, the Korean Conflict, the Cold War, Operations Enduring Freedom, Northern Watch and Southern Watch, Kosovo War, Operation Noble Eagle, Air Expeditionary Force Deployments, Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Global War on Terrorism, Task Force New Horizon and Operation New Dawn.\n\nThe United States Air Force's 159th Fighter Wing is an Air National Guard airlift unit operationally-gained by the Air Combat Command and located at Naval Air Station, Joint Reserve Base, New Orleans. The Louisiana Air National Guard’s flying unit, the 159th Fighter Wing, is nicknamed the \"Bayou Militia” and flies F-15C and F-15D Golden Eagle aircraft.\n\nThe159th Fighter Wing is comprised of an Operations Group, Maintenance Group, Medical Group and Mission Support Group. Four geographically separated units are also attached to the 159th Fighter Wing: the 122nd Air Support Operations Squadron located in Pineville, the 259th Air Traffic Control Squadron located in Alexandria, the 236th Combat Communications Squadron located in Hammond and the 214th Engineering Installation Squadron located in Belle Chasse. Each of these geographically separated units has its own distinct mission.\n\nThe Louisiana Air Guard is unique compared to other reserve force components in that it is tasked with dual missions. The wing provides worldwide deployable aircraft and combat resources; operated, maintained and supported by professional Louisiana Airmen dedicated to supporting both Federal and State missions.\n\nThe LA ANG provides its Airmen the opportunity to enjoy civilian life while contributing to the welfare of their country, state and community.\n\nA trained force of more than 1,400 men and women, the 159th Fighter Wing is home to one of the Air National Guard's premier F-15 fighter wings.\n\nThe Louisiana Air National Guard/159th Fighter Wing was awarded the coveted \"Outstanding Air National Guard Unit\" in 2010. This prestigious award is given annually to the Air National Guard unit which meets or exceeds the criteria from the National Guard Bureau. In addition, the wing received a “EXCELLENT” rating during their Operational Readiness Inspection in both 2009 and 2010. These Airmen have shown extreme professionalism and dedication to their mission of protecting the United States and its allies.\n\n159th Fighter Wing\n\nThe 159th Fighter Wing’s Mission Statement is as follows:\n\n• Provide fully manned units prepared to accomplish all Federal, State and local missions\n\n• Provide high quality support to Airmen and their families\n\n• Add value to our communities by involvement in State and local programs\n\nThe wing is comprised of four main functional groups: operations, maintenance, mission support and medical; each with its own host of squadrons and four geographically separated as mentioned above.\n\nThe Operations Group\n\nThe Operations Group has two subordinate units, the 122d Fighter Squadron and 159th Operations Support Flight. The group trains and supports aviators to maintain regular flying schedules, to support the alert mission, for immediate worldwide deployments and employment in accordance with war plans.\n\n122nd Fighter Squadron\n\nThe 122nd Fighter Squadron is a diverse and dynamic squadron that is combat ready to deploy anywhere, anytime employing the venerable air superiority F-15C/D Eagle Fighter. This worldwide commitment is the driving force behind a sharply honed team of professionals and has resulted in deployments around the world. Together with the 159th Fighter Wing, the 122nd Fighter Squadron is tasked to provide air superiority over Louisiana and the Gulf Coast while supporting North American Aerospace Defense Command. To perform this vital role requires active air defense alert 24-hours a day, 365 days a year at NAS JRB New Orleans.\n\nMaintenance Group\n\nTo sustain this fast-paced tempo, the wing has a highly dedicated and well-trained cadre of maintenance and support personnel. The maintainers are tasked with on- and off-equipment maintenance of the Eagles, including aircraft servicing, unscheduled maintenance, pre-flight, through flights, basic post flights and combat turns with live or training ammunition. In addition, support personnel perform everything from operations life support and mobility to personnel and administrative functions.\n\nMission Support Group\n\nWith more than 500 military and civilian personnel, the 159th Mission Support Group is responsible for all base support and customer service for the wing and the geographically separated units at their sites throughout the state. The group also maintains combat and contingency readiness forces that deploy worldwide. This group encompasses the communications flight, civil engineering squadron, logistics readiness squadron, contracting, security forces squadron and the force support squadron.\n\nMedical Group\n\nThe 159th Medical Group provides the following medical services: flight medicine, physical examinations, ophthalmology and optometry, public health, and bioenvironmental engineering. This includes providing medical support services to the geographically separated units at their sites throughout the state.\n\n159th Fighter Wing Staff\n\nThe wing staff consists of several offices that fall directly under the commander: command post, chaplain, equal opportunity, judge advocate general, safety, financial management, visual information, and public affairs. The director of the Air National Guard Psychological Health Program is also part of the wing staff.\n\nFederal Mission\n\nThe 159th Fighter Wing supports national security objectives by being a part of the Air Expeditionary Force participating in real world missions, supporting active duty forces, honing combat skills and specified training to meet assigned tasks.\n\nState Mission\n\nThe National Guard’s purpose is to protect life and property, and to preserve peace, order and public safety for their state. The mission also includes information sharing with emerging countries on the importance of homeland defense.\n\nCommunity Role\n\nThe 159th FW participates year round in local, state and national programs that add value to local towns, the state and nation.\n\nThe men and women who make up the 159th Fighter Wing will continue to defend the nation while transforming into the necessary force for the future. The wing will do this in both the expeditionary and homeland defense missions while continuing to uphold our military culture and connection to the community. The men and women of the 159th Fighter Wing serve proudly in the far reaches of the globe – and here at home – and will do so with distinction.\n\nDepartment Phone Number Command 391-8602 Accessories Section 391-8465 Accounting and Finance 391-8355 Administration 391-8315 Aerospace / Fabrication Support 391-8466 Air Force Advisor 391-8608 Aircraft Generation Officer 391-8438 Aircrew Debriefing 391-8681 Analysis 391-8447 / 48 Armory 391-8403 Avionics Maintenance Shop 391-8413 / 44 Base Services Officer 391-8421 Base Services NCO 391-8421 Bench Parts & Tool Storage 391-8392 Career Control 391-8339 Chaplain 391-8343 Civil Engineer 391-8413 Civil Engineering 391-8417 Command Post 391-8682 Commander 391-8600 Secretary 391-8600 Communications Commander 391-8501 Communications Maintenance Branch 391-8302 Consolidated Base Personnel Off (CBPO) 391-8327 Data Automation 391-8313 Egress Shop 391-8474 Engine Manager 391-8462 Environmental Shop 391-8472 Executive Officer 391-8611 Flight Line Maintenance 391-8457 Flight Records 391-8646 Flying Training Instructor 391-8630 Food Service 391-8421 Fuels System\n\n391-8475\n\nGround Support Equipment (Age) 391-8477 Gun Maintenance 391-8496 Information Security Programs 391-8398 Information Services 391-8310 Intelligence 391-8628 Inventory 391-8552 Jet Engine Shop 391-4711 Jet Engine Test Cell Area 391-8525 Judge Advocate 391-8505 Legal 391-8345 Logistics Group Commander 391-8610 Logistics Support Flight Commander 391-8445 Maintenance Squadron Commander 391-8500 Maintenance Administration 391-8435 Management & System Branch 391-8376 Material Control 391-8480 Material Management Branch 391-8388 Material Storage & Distribution Branch 391-8391 Medical Administration Support 391-1408 Medical Squadron 391-1410 Metal Processing 391-8471 Military Pay 391-8361 Multimedia 391-8347 Munitions Maintenance 391-9735/9726 Nondestructive Inspection Lab 391-8476 Operations Dispatch Center 391-8682 Operations Group Commander 457-8612 Organizational Maintenance 391-8429 Pass & ID 391-8329 Photo Lab 391-8347 Pick-Up & Delivery Section 391-8393 Plans Branch 391-8443 Plans & Scheduler / Documentation 391-8442 Pneudraulic Shop 391-8470 POL 391-8365 Programs & Mobility 391-8433 Public Affairs 391-8349 Publications Distribution Office (PDO) 391-8317 Quality Control 391-8449 Recruiting 391-8319 / 20 / 21 Re-enlistments & Separation 391-8339 Retail Sales 391-8394 Safety 391-8647 Security Police Commander 391-8405 Social Actions 391-8647 Stock Control Section 391-8390 Supply Systems Branch 391-8389 Support Group Commander 391-8606 Traffic Management Office 391-8379 Training 391-8332 Training (Maintenance) 391-8434 Vehicle Maintenance 391-8363 Vice-Commander 391-8602 WCS 391-8397 Weapons Loading 391-9792 Weapons Release Maintenance 391-9774 Weapons System Office 391-9793\n\nOriginally commissioned in July 1955 and located on Lake Pontchartrain, the Coast Guard Air Station came to its present home in December 1957 at Alvin Callendar Field, Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans. Rededicated in September 1996, following extensive renovations, the Air Stations facilities provide maintenance for five HH-65C helicopters; supply and support spaces for 28 officers, 86 enlisted and 2 civilians; and quarters for 2 ready flight crews 24 hours a day. Airframes flown by the Coast Guard in New Orleans have included the HO-3S, HO-4S, HUS-1G, HH52A and the HH-3F “Pelican” helicopter.\n\nIn September 1985, Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans became the first unit in the Coast Guard to fly the HH-65A “Dolphin” in operational missions, and again led the fleet being the first among Coast Guard Air Stations to upgrade to the HH-65B. In 2006, the Coast Guard Air Station again upgraded to the more powerful HH-65C. In 2013, the Air Station New Orleans helicopters were upgraded to the MH-65D. Having a top speed of 175 knots, the HH-65D incorporates an upgraded avionics package and replacment of obsolete components. The twin turbine helicopter has an operational radius of 150 nautical miles with 30 minutes on-scene time. Flown by a crew of four including two pilots, one flight mechanic, and a rescue swimmer/EMT the HH-65D has a total gross weight limitation of 9,480 pounds.\n\nToday Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans’ responsibilities include an area from Apalachicola, Florida north to Memphis, Tennessee, west to the Texas-Louisiana border and thousands of offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Within this area, the station’s missions include homeland security (HLS), search and rescue (SAR), law enforcement (LE), marine environmental protection (EP), and aids to navigation (ATON). To meet these demanding missions, the air station flies over 3,200 hours annually.\n\nCoast Guard Air Station New Orleans was the first air station to integrate into a Coast Guard Sector organization with the inception of Coast Guard Sector New Orleans, led by Marine Safety Office New Orleans and including Group New Orleans. With an emphasis on mission effectiveness, the Sector concept is an integral component of the Coast Guard’s future command and control organization.\n\nCoast Guard air station personnel have developed strong relationships with multiple government agencies including the FBI, Secret Service, and state and local law enforcement. Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans has served as the Coast Guard’s flagship unit, introducing new HLS operational capabilities such as joint USCG/FBI SWAT team interoperability, including the first FBI live-fire sniper training from a USCG HH-65B helicopter.\n\nIn addition, Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans has led the USCG in the development and implementation of vertical delivery (hoist delivery) of USCG boarding teams to vessels at sea, a capability now used frequently with other units throughout the Coast Guard.\n\nIn 2005 following the passage of Hurricane Katrina, Air Station New Orleans briefly became “Air Group” New Orleans, supporting fleet-wide rotor and fixed wing air operations. Coast Guard helicopters flew more than 500 flight hours and hoisted more than 1,800 people to safety during both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n\nIn 2009, Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans flew 289 SAR operations, saving 59 people, assisting 46 others and preventing the loss of $40 million in property.\n\nOn April 21, 2010, Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans aircrews were the first to respond to the explosion of the oil rig Deepwater Horizon 50 miles south of Venice, La. The massive fire left 126 people in need of rescue. Leading the response, New Orleans aircrews worked throughout the night, and together with Coast Guard teams from Mobile, Ala., and civilian response teams, rescued 115 people, including 17 who were critically injured.\n\nIn 2015, Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans flew 271 SAR operations, saving 51 people and assisting 78 others while saving $863,175 in property.\n\nA majority of lives saved or assisted during 2016 were a result of historic flooding in Baton Rouge, in which Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans supported search and rescue for an area covering more than 100 square miles during a seven-day period.\n\nIn 2017, the station responded to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria; in support of Harvey the unit deployed three aircraft and 51 personnel to Houston and orchestrated rescue operations as well as serving as the logistics and maintenance hub for the area. These efforts saved 863 lives and assisted 366 others, contribution to the more and 11,000 lives saved by the Coast Guard in this natural disaster.\n\nSince its establishment in 1955, Air Station New Orleans has saved more than 13,000 lives and is considered to be the busiest all-helicopter SAR unit in the Coast Guard. Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans has been awarded 12 Meritorious Unit Commendations for its superior performance during rescue operations as well as five Coast Guard Unit Commendations for exceptional operational performance.\n\nDepartment Phone Number Duty 393-6032 Fax 393-6016\n\nMarine Air Group 42 Det. C originated in 1946 at the New Orleans Lakefront Airport under the name of Marine Air Detachment (MAD) and supported Marine Fighter Squadron 143. MAD was redesignated as Marine Air Reserve Training Detachment (MARTD) in September 1953 and in November 1957, MARTD relocated from New Orleans Lakefront Airport to its present location at NAS JRB New Orleans. MARTD was awarded the Fourth Marine Aircraft Wing (4th MAW) Commanding General’s Proficiency Award in 1969, 1971, 1974 and was runner up in 1973.\n\nMARTD New Orleans was redesignated as Marine Aircraft Group 46, Det. B in October 1979 and was awarded the 4th MAW, Commanding General’s Proficiency Award in 1989. MAG-46 Det. B provided detachment support for HML-767 from Jan. 1 to May 14, 1991 while the squadron was deployed in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm.\n\nMAG-46, Det. B was redesignated as Marine Aircraft Group 42, Det. C in June 1992 and then re-designated to MAG-49 Det. C on June 20, 2008. MAG-42 in Atlanta, Georgia was officially decommissioned on Sept. 30, 2008 as part of the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing's realignment of its force structure.\n\nMAG-49 Det. C actively supports the Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 773 Det A, Fleet Readiness Center. Mid-Atlantic and Fourth Marine Aircraft Wing, Military Police Det.\n\nSince January 2003 MAG-49 Det. C has been actively involved in the Global War on Terrorism. In January 2003, 4th MAW MP Det. activated, split and deployed to Kuwait for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and to Djibouti for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Additionally, MALS-42 Det. C activated and deployed to Camp Pendleton, Calif., in support of units deployed to OIF. During October 2003, HMLA-773 Det A activated in support of OEF and deployed to Afghanistan on three separate occasions during its two-year activation through October 2005.\n\nIn September of 2005, following Hurricane Katrina’s devastation of New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast, MAG-42 Det. C, with helicopters from HMLA-773 Det A, along with HMLA-773 from Atlanta, comprised part of the Aviation Combat Element for Special MAGTF Katrina as part of the overall Joint Task Force Katrina. During this time, they participated in rescue and relief efforts in New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast.\n\nThroughout 2006 the unit supported multiple training events throughout the region. The Military Police Det conducted its annual training in Pheodosia, Ukraine in support of Operation Sea Breeze. In September of 2007 HMLA 773 Det. A deployed to Al Asad, Iraq, for a seven month deployment in support of OIF.\n\nMAG-49 Det. C and its component detachments continue to train ensure they are ready to meet future commitments in the Global War on Terrorism.\n\nDepartment Phone Number (All area codes 504) Administration 678-3115 / 16 / 17 Admin Officer 678-7409 AIMD/Ask Chief 678-4622 Fax 678-3288 Airframes 678-3295 Armory 678-9578 Avionics Shop 678-3170 CO 678-7410 Executive Officer 678-7411 Family Readiness Officer 678-7455 Fiscal (S-4) Supply 678-3819 Flight Equipment 678-3595 Flight Line 678-3163 FRC SNCO 678-4533 Ground Supply (S-4) 678-3636/37 Hazmat/Airframes 678-3313 Intelligence (S-2) 678-3138 Maintenance Control 678-3481 Maintenance Officer 678-3712 Maintenance Control Chief 678-3388 Operations (S-3) 678-3130 Operations Officer 678-3632/33 Quality Assurance 678-3345 Safety 678-3622 Sergeant Major 678-7412 Supply Chief 678-3617/3636 S-4 678-3622 Tool Room/ IMRL 678-3638\n\nThe mission of the Fleet Readiness Center Mid-Atlantic (FRCMA) Det. New Orleans is to produce relevant quality airframes, engines, components and services to meet the Navy's aircraft-ready-for-training entitlements at improved efficiency and reduced costs. Fix it once! Fix it right! Fix it on time!\n\nFormerly known as Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department (AIMD), the Navy transformed Naval aviation maintenance in February 2006 by the formation of Fleet Readiness Centers, which integrated Naval Air Depots (NADEPs) and the Continental United States (CONUS) AIMDs into a consolidated organization for shore-based, off-flight-line maintenance.\n\nOn Aug. 1, 2006, the Office of the Secretary of Defense approved the FRC business plan, and AIMD New Orleans became Fleet Readiness Center Mid-Atlantic Site New Orleans. The implementation of FRCs is one of the Navy’s strategies to support the Warfighter and achieve cost-wise readiness in the 21st century.\n\nNavy aircraft are designed to fly hard, fast, and in the worst conditions. Squadron technicians work hard to ensure that they perform at 100 percent. When the components of those aircraft need repair or maintenance, FRC brings \"intermediate\" level maintenance expertise to the flight line and directly supports one F/A-18 Hornet squadron, one C-130T Hercules squadron, and two Marine Corps squadrons composed of UH-1Y Hueys and AH-1W Cobras. The now called FRCMA Det. New Orleans is a large maintenance operation with more than 160 Sailors, Marines and civil service employees working to keep the aircraft it supports up and flying.\n\nFRCMA Det. New Orleans has 58 work centers, organized into eight divisions: personnel, supply, avionics, power plants, airframes, life support equipment, armament, and support equipment. On average, more than 876 aircraft parts per month run through FRCMA Det. New Orleans.\n\nResponding to the unique challenges of supporting four different type/model aircraft that routinely operate in support of the Global War on Terrorism, no other ashore FRC Det. this size has responded as effectively to meet or exceed all Navy and Marine Corps mission and fleet support expectations. FRCMA Det. New Orleans met 100 percent of its commitments with unmatched success, leading other FRCs in key metrics of maintenance and logistics support, planeside performance, production, and production resources.\n\nThe unit processed 34,779 maintenance actions in fiscal year 2015, maintaining an average ready-for-issue rate of 98.3 percent, an impressive metric for any intermediate repair facility. Whether it is through outstanding maintenance support, stellar customer service, emergency response or Lean Six Sigma initiatives, FRCMA Det New Orleans sets the standard for others to follow.\n\nDepartment Phone Number (All area codes 504) OIC 678-3771 AOIC/AMO 678-3755 Admin 678-3590/3591 Airframes 678-3329/3693 Aviation Life Support 678-3043/9611 Avionics LCPO 678-3225 Calibration Lab 678-3259 Career Counselor 678-7451 Electric Shop 678-3318 IMRL 678-7482/7484 Maint.

The first is mission command of assigned forces in order to provide the United States Army Reserve with trained and ready units and individuals that support geographic combatant command requirements. The second mission is to deploy and operate as the senior Army logistics headquarters capable of planning, controlling and synchronizing operational-level Army deployment and sustainment. The 377th TSC has more than 36,000 Soldiers and civilians in 34 states. The workforce is made up of approximately 80 percent Reserve citizen Soldiers, 10 percent represent the active component and about 10 percent are civilians. It is commanded by a major general (two-star) with six brigadier general (one-star) deputy commanders in its command structure.\n\nThe unit was activated In July 1942 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 12 Port of Embarkation, at Fort Dix, N.J. It was then converted, reorganized and redesignated the 12th Port Headquarters and Headquarters Company, and assigned to the Transportation Corps in November 1942. After an inactivation in 1946, the unit was redesignated Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 377th Transportation Major Port, and assigned to the Organized Reserve Corps in November 1948. Two weeks later, the 377th Transportation Major Port was activated in New Orleans. The unit has been a part of the New Orleans community since that time.\n\nIn September 1950 the 377th was called to Fort Eustis, Va., and stayed on active federal service until Oct. 10, 1952. From 1953 until 1963, the 377th remained in a Reserve status and experienced extensive growth and several changes in unit designation.\n\nIn December 1965, the unit was redesignated as the 377th Support Brigade under the Army Logistical Concept. On Oct. 16, 1979, it was renamed the 377th Corps Support Command and retained this designation until July 16, 1981, when it was designated as a Theater Army Area Command (TAACOM). On Oct. 1, 1998, the TAACOM wartime mission expanded and the unit designation was changed to the 377th Theater Support Command.\n\nThe 377th Theater Support Command was redesignated the 377th Theater Sustainment Command (TSC) and regionally aligned to U.S. Southern Command in September 2007. Since then, the 377th TSC has generated and globally deployed sustainment forces for multiple missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn. Most recently, the 377th TSC provided earthquake relief in Haiti as part of Operation Unified Response in 2010 and provided assistance in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. As the Army transforms, the 377th TSC will continue to lead the way by integrating emerging technology with the best-trained and ready Soldiers to provide sustainment solutions to support any mission.\n\nDepartment\n\nPhone Numbers\n\n(All area codes 504)\n\nGeneral Number 552-5900 Emergency OPS Center 552-5971 Command Section CG 552-5981 Command XO 552-5940 Chief of Staff 552-5969 CMD Sgt Maj 552-5885 Executive Admin Asst 552-5888 SGS 552-5834 Public Affairs 558-5967 Staff Judge Advocate 558-5594 Chaplain 552-5991 Safety Officer 558-5960 IG 558-5580 EEO 552-5806 Surgeon 558-5872 Family Programs 558-5685 G1 Human Resources 552-5814 G2 Intelligence 552-5871 G3 Operations 552-5946 G4 Logistics 552-5868 G5 Plans 552-5928 G6 Information Technology 552-5870 G7 Training 552-5982 G8 Finance 558-5997 Support Operations 552-5913 Special Troops Battalion 558-5624 HQ and HQ Company 558-5538\n\nStrike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 204 was originally commissioned as Attack Squadron (VA) 204 flying A-4C Skyhawks at NAS Memphis, Tennessee, on July 1, 1970. VFA-204 began its long list of tactical accomplishments by winning back to back CVWR-20 Bombing Derbies in 1971 and 1972. VA-204 received the CNO annual Safety Award for 1973. The award represented more than 5,000 hours of accident free flying for the year. In 1975 the River Rattlers won the F. Trubee Davison Award as the \"Best Tailhook Squadron in the Naval Reserve.\"\n\nIn March 1978, the squadron moved from NAS Memphis to NAS New Orleans and began transitioning to the A-7B aircraft. With transition and relocation complete, VA-204 began establishing enviable records of operational readiness and safety and in 1980 won the CNO Safety Award.\n\nThe squadron earned the CNO Safety Award again in 1982 and 1983, and was nominated for the Noel Davis (Battle \"E\") in 1983. The tradition of excellence continued in 1984 by winning the CVWR-20 Golden Wrench Award and the Battle \"E\".\n\nIn 1986, VA-204 transitioned to the A-7E Corsair II and in 1990 earned its fifth CNO Safety Award. The next four years saw the River Rattlers establish a high level of tactics and excellence in the Corsair II. During this period, the squadron completed seven weapons detachments, three carrier qualification evolutions, air wing active duty to NAS Fallon and embarkation on USS Forrestal (CV 59) and USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69).\n\nThe last year of A-7E operations in CVWR-20, 1990, was one of the squadron's best years ever. Though severely hampered by numerous aircraft transfer and acceptance inspections, VA-204 flew 113% of its original flight hour program and conducted seven deployments away from NAS New Orleans. On Jan. 28, 1991, VA-204 celebrated ten years of FOD free operations. For their operational achievements and safety programs, the River Rattlers earned the CVWR-20 nomination for the Battle \"E\" and received the CNO Safety Award for 1990.\n\nAttack Squadron 204 was redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron 204 on April 1, 1991 and accepted its first FA-18, thus ending twelve years of flying A-7 Corsair. The squadron officially completed its transition to the F/A-18 Hornet in March 1993, and the next month began initial adversary training at NAS Oceana, VA. In October the squadron became the first Reserve Strike Fighter Squadron to provide adversary support to the active-duty fleet during a one-week detachment to NAS Key West. In 1993, VFA-204 received its sixth CNO Safety Award, completing 13 years and 50,000 Class-A mishap free flight hours.\n\nThe squadron received and overall grade of 98.2 on its Conventional Weapons Technical Proficiency Inspection (CWTPI) in 1994, the highest score ever achieved by a Reserve Strike Fighter Squadron, and earned its second Battle \"E\" as well as the squadron's second F. Trubee Davison Award as 'Best Tailhook Squadron in the Naval Reserve'.\n\nThe Meritorious Unit Commendation was awarded to the squadron in 1995 for its extremely successful transition from the A-7E to the FA-18 which the unit still flies today.\n\nThe River Rattlers continue to set the bar high, proving that the experience and expertise resident in this naval Reserve squadron rival those of any unit, anwhere, anytime.\n\nVFA-204 Phone (Area Codes 504) Duty Office 678-3491 CO/XO/OIC 678-3647 Command Master Chief 678-3319 CCC 678-3935 Duty Officer 678-3491 VFA Maintenance Dept.
