        "text": "Reserve activations\n\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- In response to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's request for authorization to activate tens of thousands of National Guard and Reserve troops and President's Bush's approval of the call-up, the Pentagon has announced that military planners have assigned allotments for 53,900 of them.\n\n\"These reservists are being called upon to provide port operations, medical support, engineer support, general civil support and homeland defense,\" according to the Pentagon.\n\n\"Noble Eagle\" is the name given to the operation set up to provide homeland defense in the aftermath of last week's terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" is the name given the antiterrorism campaign.\n\n\"No other single action more clearly demonstrates the national resolve than to mobilize the National Guard and Reserve forces of America,\" said Craig Duehring, principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs.\n\nRumsfeld requested the call-up as part of a Bush administration plan in response to the September 11 terror attacks on the Pentagon and New York's World Trade Center.\n\nOf the personnel activated thus far, the Army has supplied 14,300, the Air Force and Air National Guard 30,000, the Marines 610, the Navy 7,000 and the Coast Guard 2,200.\n\nThe activated units, as released
