        "text": "More: Squadron Insignia\n\nThe squadron is the basic unit in the United States Air Force. The design for the unit emblem must be on a circular shaped shield or disc with either one or two scrolls of the same size. The unit designation always appears on the bottom scroll. Squadron emblems are in the public domain in the United States because they contain materials that originally came from the United States Armed Forces badges or logos. As a work of the U.S. federal government, this image is in the public domain in the United States."
