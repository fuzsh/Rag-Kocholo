HISTORY OF RUSSIA : Anna Alexeievna Koltovskaya (before 1572 â€“ 5 April 1626) was Tsaritsa of the Tsardom of Russia and the fourth spouse of Tsar Ivan IV of Russia ("Ivan the Terrible").

After two years of marriage, Ivan began to tire of his wife due to her sterility. He repudiated her, and sent her to the convent of Vedenski-Tikhvinski where she assumed the monastery name of Daria. Only she and Maria Nagaya, the eighth wife of Ivan the terrible, outlived the tsar.
