        "text": "Ivan Vasilyevich or Ivan IV was the first Tsar of All the Russias and Grand Prince of Moscow.\n\nHe is popularly known as Ivan the Terrible or Ivan the Fearsome for his explosive temper.\n\nHe conquered the Khanates of Astrakhan, Kazan, and Sibir and under his reign, Russia had an area of over one billion acres.\n\nHe established a centrally administered Russian state and included non-Slav states in his empire.\n\nIvan also led several unsuccessful military campaigns against Sweden and Poland. He was an intelligent and able ruler who was very popular among the masses.\n\nIvan is, however; also remembered for his bouts of rage and the harsh treatment he meted out to Russian nobility in the name of establishing discipline in the state.\n\nIvan the Terrible Facts For Kids\n\nIvan IV ruled Russia from 1547-1584.\n\nHe expanded Russia’s territories.\n\nHe established the Oprichnina.\n\nHe killed his own son.\n\nHe was the first Tsar of Russia.\n\nIvan had a reputation for being cruel.\n\nHe was crowned at the age of 16.\n\nEarly Life\n\nIvan was born on September 3, 1530. His father was Vasili III, Grand Prince of Moscow and his mother’s name was Elena Glinskaya, second wife of Vasili.\n\nIvan was only three years old when his father died of frail health. He was appointed Grand Prince of Moscow at the age of three in 1533.\n\nHis mother acted as regent but she was assassinated in 1538 when Ivan was only eight years old.\n\nThe next nine years of his life were difficult as he felt neglected and offended by the clans of warrior caste called ‘Boyars’.\n\nThese families tried to control the young prince for their own benefit. This instilled a lifelong hatred for Boyars in Ivan’s heart.\n\nIn 1547, at the age of only sixteen, Ivan became the first Tsar of All the Russias.\n\nBy assuming the title he tried to send a message to all dissenters that he was now the sole ruler of all the territories.\n\nThe Great Fire of Moscow\n\nThe very first year of Ivan’s reign was marred by the Great Fire of Moscow. A large part of the city was destroyed by the fire.\n\nIn his early years as the ruler of Russia, Ivan followed the agenda of reformation and modernization.\n\nThese early years were peaceful as well. During these years, Ivan revised the code of law and introduced Sudebnik of Ivan, a new code of laws.\n\nWhat did Ivan the terrible Do and what Accomplishments\n\nHe created a standing army and established a council of nobles called Zemsky Sobor.\n\nIn 1552 Ivan conquered the Khanate of Kazan and in 1556, he invaded the Khanate of Astrakhan. In 1553, Ivan ordered the establishment of Moscow Print Yard, the first publishing house in Russia.\n\nIvan launched a military campaign to take control of Livonia (present-day Latvia and Estonia) in 1558.\n\nThe war continued for many years and despite some early success, ended in a defeat for Russia against a joint army of Sweden, Lithuania, and Poland. During the 1560s, great misfortunes befell Russia.\n\nWars against Poland and Sweden were lost and marine trade routes were blocked by Swedish flotilla. Famine and drought hit the Russian people badly.\n\nOne of Ivan’s advisors, Andrei Kurbsky defected to join the Lithuanians and commanded the Lithuanian army against the Russians.\n\nIvan the Terrible Spouse\n\nIn 1563, Ivan’s first wife, Anastasia also died which was a great personal loss for him. In 1564, he moved to Aleksandrova Sloboda and wrote a letter to announce his abdication.\n\nIn his absence, Boyars could not control the affairs of the state and requested him to reconsider his decision.\n\nIvan agreed on the condition that he would have absolute power. He then divided Russia into two parts.\n\nThe part in the north was called Oprichnina and Ivan held exclusive power in this territory.\n\nThe second part was called Zemshchina and was ruled by the Boyar Council. Ivan then treated the nobility of Russia very harshly.\n\nHow did Ivan the Terrible Die\n\nIvan died on March 28, 1584, while playing chess with his close friend Bogdan Belsky.\n\nIvan, in a fit of rage, had himself killed his heir apparent and elder son Ivan Ivanovich in 1581.\n\nAs a result, after his death, he was succeeded by his younger son Feodor, who was not as able and intellectually gifted as his elder brother.\n\nMore Ivan the Terrible Facts"
