        "text": "Founded in 1148 as a small princedom bordering on Muscovy, Uglich is one of the most beloved towns in Old Russia. The view of the town as you approach it from the Volga River is breath-taking with the Cathedral of the Resurrection and St. Johnâ€™s Church rising up on the horizon. The beautiful charm of the town and its history really sets Uglich apart from other Russian towns and cities and makes it a favourite place for Muscovites to come to at the weekends.\n\nThe history of the town is fascinating; at the end of the 16th century, Maria Nagaya, seventh wife of Ivan the Terrible, lived in honorary exile at the Kremlin in Uglich. It was here in her garden that the 10 year old Prince Dmitry, heir to the Russian throne was murdered by Boris Godunov who wanted to seize power for himself. On the spot of his death, the Church of St. Demetrius of the Blood was built in 1692 and still stands today. The death of Prince Dmitri lead to the start of the Time of Troubles, a dynastic and political crises and one of the most tumultuous periods in Russian history which ended 15 years later after the election of a new Tsar Mikhail Romanov (the first Tsar of the Romanov Dynasty). Inside the Kremlin the oldest building in Uglich, the Palace of Tsarevich Dmitry also stands which is now open to the public as a museum.\n\nAs per all old Russian towns there are several churches and monasteries lying on the banks of the Volga, including the Resurrection Monastery and the Alexeyevsky Monastery which houses the beautiful Assumption Church. Getting to Uglich can be difficult. There are buses daily from Moscow, but the journey takes over 5 hours, and the rail network to Uglich is outdated and slow. By far the best way to arrive is along the Volga, and this is one of several towns which is part of most Volga river cruises.\n\nTours in Uglich"
