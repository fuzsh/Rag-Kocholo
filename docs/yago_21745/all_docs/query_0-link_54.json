        "text": "Tsar of RussiaTemplate:SHORTDESC:Tsar of Russia\n\nIvan IV (25 August 1530 â€“ 28 March 1584), known as Ivan the Terrible, was the Grand Prince of Moscow from 1533 to 1547 and the first Tsar of Russia from 1547 to 1575 and again from 1576 to 1584.\n\nName[edit]\n\nIn Russian, Ivan IV is known as \"Ivan Grozny\", which in English directly translates to \"Ivan the Terrible\", however, not with its associated modern moral undertones, rather more so meaning \"the forceful\". This connotation is largely derived from his treatment of the Russian nobility.[1]\n\nReign[edit]\n\nIvan IV reigned for over 49 years. His reign was one of much reform, creating lasting institutions, like the Zemsky Sobor in 1549, the first Russian parliament made up the high-ranking military, and the Streltsy in 1550, the first standing Russian army, made of up professional soldiers.[1]\n\nIn 1547, Ivan IV married Anastasia Romanovna, a Romanov princess. Anastasia died in 1560. Some believe that this was Ivan's breaking point. Afterwards, his reign became one of famine and war.[1]\n\nThe Livonian War between Russia against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden began in 1558 in the Baltics. This was due to Ivan's desire to incorporate the Livonia region into Russia. It was a costly war for Russia which ended in a loss in 1583.[1]\n\nIn 1561, Saint Basil's Cathedral was finished, which Ivan had commissioned.[1]\n\nIvan had been paranoid of the Boyars, the nobles from the Oprichnina. The Tsardom of Russia had been split in two territories, the Zemschina and the Oprichnina[1], which had recently been conquered by Ivan III.\n\nAt the height of his popularity with the people, in 1564, Ivan abdicated the throne blaming the Boyars and their scheming. The Russian nobles were unhappy with this as legally they could not govern without a Tsar, they didn't want to choose a successor for Ivan, and they were unpopular with the people of Moscow. The nobles begged Ivan to return and he did on the condition that he would become an absolute monarch, which they agreed to, and thus he returned.[1]\n\nShortly thereafter, in 1565 Ivan founded the Oprichniki, a proto-police force who administered the Oprichnina and dealt with traitors.[1]\n\nThe crisis of the late 16th century struck Russia in the 1670s and 1680s under Ivan. This involved plague and famine and raising concerns that Novgorod Land, in the Oprichnina, would rebel. Ivan dealt with the latter concern with the Massacre of Novgorod[1], which involved the murder of 2,000 to 15,000 people.\n\nIn 1572, Ivan disbanded the Oprichniki due to incompetence, as while they had success as a repressive force, they had little success in battle.[1]\n\nThe last approximate decade of Ivan's reign centered around him neutering the power of the nobility in favor of his own. Ivan abdicated again in 1575, at which point Simeon Bekbulatovich, a close friend of Ivan's, became the acting ruler. Simeon reigned for less than a year, during which he seized lands from the Russian Orthodox Church, a move unpopular among the populace. Ivan returned in 1576 and condemned this move as \"un-Christian\", however did not return the lands, owing to speculation he abdicated only to not become unpopular by doing so.[1]\n\nThe Russian conquest of Siberia began in 1580 under Ivan IV.[1]\n\nIn 1581, Ivan IV got into a confrontation with his son Ivan Ivanovich and he had been mistreating his son's wife Yelena Sheremeteva. Ivan IV questioned his son's loyalty and ended up beating him to death with a scepter.[1]\n\nLegacy[edit]\n\nThe famine, war, and oppression under the Oprichniki which took place under Ivan's rule in addition to the murder of Ivan Ivanovich soured his legacy among the Russian people. However, bar the latter two, most of the troubles which underwent his reign were present in other contemporary European monarchs' reigns.[1]"
