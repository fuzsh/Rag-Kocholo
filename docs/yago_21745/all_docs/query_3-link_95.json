        "text": "Ivan IV Vasilyevich (August 25, 1530 – March 28, 1584), commonly known in English as Ivan the Terrible, “Ivan the Formidable” or “Ivan the Fearsome” was the Grand Prince of Moscow from 1533 to 1547 and the first Moscow ruler to be crownedTsar of all Russia from 1547 to 1584.\n\nIvan was the first Moscow ruler born after its independence.\n\nEarly life\n\nIvan was the first son of Grand Prince Vasili III of Moscow and his second wife, Elena Glinskaya, Elena was born in 1510 as the daughter of Prince Vasili Lvovich Glinsky (d. 1515), a member of a Lipka Tatar clan claiming descent from the Mongol ruler Mamai, and Serbian Princess Ana Jakšić from the Jakšić noble family.\n\nElena’s mother was a Serbian princess and her father’s family, the Glinski clan (nobles based in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania), claimed descent both from Orthodox Hungarian nobles and the Mongol ruler Mamai (1335–1380.)\n\nVasili III’s mother, Zoe (Sophia) Palaiologina, a Byzantine Greek princess, a member of the Imperial Palaiologos family, was a daughter of Thomas Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea and younger brother of the last Byzantine Emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos (r. 1449–1453).\n\nHer mother was Catherine, the only legitimate daughter and heiress of Centurione II Zaccaria, the last independent Prince of Achaea and Baron of Arcadia.\n\nBorn on August 25, he received the name Ivan in honor of St. John the Baptist, the day of the Beheading of which falls on August 29. In some texts of that era, it is also occasionally mentioned with the names Titus and Smaragd, in accordance with the tradition of polyonyms among the Rurikovich.\n\nIvan was appointed grand prince after his father’s death when he was three years old.\n\nOn January 16, 1547, at 16, Ivan was crowned at the Cathedral of the Dormition of the Moscow Kremlin. The Metropolitan placed on Ivan the signs of royal dignity: the Cross of the Life-Giving Tree, barmas, and the cap of Monomakh; Ivan Vasilievich was anointed with myrrh, and then the metropolitan blessed the tsar. He was the first to be crowned as “Tsar of All the Russias”, partly imitating his grandfather, Ivan III the Great, who had claimed the title of Grand Prince of all Rus’.\n\nUntil then, rulers of Muscovy were crowned as Grand Princes, but Ivan III the Great had styled himself “tsar” in his correspondence.\n\nSome foreign ambassadors—namely, Herberstein (in 1516 and 1525), Daniel Printz a Buchau (in 1576 and 1578) and Just Juel (in 1709)—indicated that the word “tsar” should not be translated as “emperor”, because it is applied by Russians to David, Solomon and other Biblical kings, who are simple reges.\n\nOn the other hand, Jacques Margeret, a bodyguard of False Demetrius I, argues that the title of “tsar” is more honorable for Muscovites than “kaiser” or “king” exactly because it was God and not some earthly potentate who ordained to apply it to David, Solomon, and other kings of Israel.\n\nDuring his youth, there was a conquest of the khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan. After he had consolidated his power, Ivan rid himself of the advisers from the “Chosen Council” and triggered the Livonian War, which ravaged Russia and resulted in the loss of Livonia and Ingria but allowed him to establish greater autocratic control over Russia’s nobility, which he violently purged with the Oprichnina. The later years of Ivan’s reign were marked by the Massacre of Novgorod and the burning of Moscow by Tatars.\n\nIvan the Terrible had at least six (possibly eight) wives, although only four of them were recognised by the Church. Three of them were allegedly poisoned by his enemies or by rivaling aristocratic families who wanted to promote their daughters to be his brides.\n\nTwo weeks after his coronation, Ivan married his first wife, Anastasia Romanovna, a member of the Romanov family, who became the first Russian tsaritsa.\n\n2. Maria Temryukovna (in 1561–1569, death):\n\n3. Marfa Sobakina (28 October – 13 November 1571, death)\n\n4. Anna Koltovskaya (in 1572, sent to monastery). This was the last of his church-authorized weddings. She was later canonized as Saint Daria (locally-venerated saint).\n\n5. Anna Vasilchikova (in 1575/76, sent to monastery)\n\n6. Vasilisa Melentyeva (?–1579) (existence disputed)\n\n7. Maria Dolgorukaya (1580) (existence disputed)\n\n8. Maria Nagaya (from 1580), widow:\n\nIn 1581, Ivan beat his pregnant daughter-in-law, Yelena Sheremeteva, for wearing immodest clothing, which may have caused her to suffer a miscarriage. Upon learning of the altercation, his second son, also named Ivan Ivanovich engaged in a heated argument with his father.\n\nThe argument ended with the elder Ivan IV fatally striking his son in the head with his pointed staff. The event is depicted in the famous painting by Ilya Repin, Ivan the Terrible and his son Ivan on Friday, November 16, 1581, better known as Ivan the Terrible killing his son.\n\nDeath\n\nIvan died from a stroke while he was playing chess with Bogdan Belsky on March 28, 1584. Upon Ivan’s death, the Russian throne was left to his unfit middle son, Feodor, a weak-minded figure. Feodor died childless in 1598, which ushered in the Time of Troubles.\n\nContemporary sources present disparate accounts of Ivan’s complex personality. He was described as intelligent and devout but also prone to paranoia, rage, and episodic outbreaks of mental instability that increased with age. After the murder of his son and hier, it left his younger son, the politically ineffectual Feodor Ivanovich, to inherit the throne, a man whose rule and subsequent childless death directly led to the end of the Rurikid dynasty and the beginning of the Time of Troubles.\n\nNickname\n\nThe English word terrible is usually used to translate the Russian word Грозный in Ivan’s nickname, but that is a somewhat-archaic translation. The Russian word Грозный reflects the older English usage of terrible as in “inspiring fear or terror; dangerous; powerful; formidable”.\n\nThe name does not convey the more modern connotations of the English word terrible such as “defective” or “evil”. Vladimir Dal defines grozny specifically in archaic usage and as an epithet for tsars: “courageous, magnificent, magisterial and keeping enemies in fear, but people in obedience”. Other translations have also been suggested by modern scholars, including ‘formidable’.\n\nIvan Ivanovich of Russia (March 28, 1554 – November 19,1581) of the House of Rurik, was a Tsarevich (heir apparent) of Russia. He was the son of Czar Ivan IV the Terrible, who killed him in a fit of rage.\n\nEarly life\n\nIvan IV Vasilyevich (August 25, 1530 – March 28, 1584), commonly known in English as Ivan the Terrible, was the Grand Prince of Moscow from 1533 to 1547 and the first Moscow ruler who declared himself tsar of all Russia from 1547 to 1584.\n\nIvan was the first Moscow ruler born after its independence. The son of Vasili III, the Rurikid ruler of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, he was appointed grand prince when he was three years old after his father’s death. A group of reformers known as the “Chosen Council” united around the young Ivan, declaring him Czar of All Rus’ in 1547 at the age of 16 and establishing the Czardom of Russia with Moscow as the predominant state.\n\nIvan was the second son of Czar Ivan IV the Terrible by his first wife Anastasia Romanovna Zakharyina-Yurieva (1530 – August 7, 1560).\n\nAnastasia was the second daughter of the boyar Roman Yurievich Zakharyin-Yuriev and Uliana Ivanovna. Roman Yurievich served as Okolnichy under the reign of Grand Prince Vasily III. The house of Zakharyin-Yuriev was a minor branch of a noble house, that had already been at court, so it’s possible that Ivan met Anastasia before the bride show, though no records of that exist.\n\nOne of her uncles had been one of Ivan’s guardians during the regency of his mother Grand Princess Elena Glinskaya, who held all the real power. Anastasia’s father was descended from boyar Feodor nicknamed “Koshka” (“Cat”), the fourth son of boyar Andrei Kobyla. The origins of her mother Uliana Ivanovna are unknown.\n\nAnastasia Romanovna Zakharyina-Yurieva was also the first Russian Czarina. She was the mother of Feodor I, the last lineal Rurikid Czar of Russia and the great-aunt of Michael I of Russia, the first Tsar of the Romanov dynasty. Her parents were Boyar Roman Yurievich Zakharyin, Okolnichi, who died on February 16, 1543, who gave his name to the Romanov dynasty of Russian monarchs, and Uliana Ivanovna, who died in 1579.\n\nIvan Ivanovich’s brother was Feodor. The young Ivan accompanied his father during the Massacre of Novgorod at the age of 15. For five weeks, he and his father would watch the Oprichniks with enthusiasm and retire to church for prayer. At age 27, Ivan was at least as well read as his father, and in his free time, wrote a biography on Antony of Siya. Ivan is reputed to have once saved his father from an assassination attempt. A Livonian prisoner named Bykovski raised a sword against the Czar, only to be rapidly stabbed by the Tsarevich.\n\nMarriages\n\nIn 1566, it was suggested that the 12-year-old Ivan marry Virginia Eriksdotter, daughter of King Eric XIV of Sweden, but this did not come about. At the age of seventeen, Ivan was betrothed to Eudoxia Saburova, who had previously been proposed as a bride for Czar Ivan. Indeed, she had been one of twelve women paraded before the Tsar in a bride-show for him to make a choice.\n\nThe Czar had rejected Eudoxia as a bride for himself but she was later married to the Czar’s son. The Czar wanted his daughter-in-law to produce an heir very quickly, and this did not happen, so the Czar banished her to a convent and got his son another bride. This second wife was Praskovia Solova, who quickly met with the same fate as her predecessor, and was also put away into a convent. The Czar then got his son a third wife, Yelena Sheremeteva, who was found to be pregnant in October 1581. That child was presumably miscarried around the time when Ivan died by his father’s hand in November 1581.\n\nDeath\n\nIvan Ivanovich is believed to have been killed by his father, Ivan the Terrible.\n\nIvan Ivanovich’s relationship with his father began to deteriorate during the later stages of the Livonian War. Angry with his father for his military failures, Ivan demanded to be given command of some troops to liberate besieged Pskov.\n\nTheir relationship further deteriorated when on November 15, 1581, the Czar, after seeing his pregnant daughter-in-law wearing unconventionally light clothing, physically assaulted her. Hearing her screams, the Tsarevich rushed to his wife’s defense, angrily shouting, “You sent my first wife to a convent for no reason, you did the same with my second, and now you strike the third, causing the death of the son she holds in her womb.”\n\nYelena subsequently suffered a miscarriage. The Tsarevich confronted his father on the matter, only to have the topic changed to his insubordination regarding Pskov. The elder Ivan accused his son of inciting rebellion, which the younger Ivan denied, but vehemently stuck to the view that Pskov should be liberated.\n\nAngered, Ivan’s father struck him on the head with his sceptre. Boris Godunov, who was present at the scene, tried to intervene but received blows himself. The younger Ivan fell, barely conscious and with a bleeding wound on his temple. The elder Ivan immediately threw himself at his son, kissing his face and trying to stop the bleeding, whilst repeatedly crying, “May I be damned! I’ve killed my son! I’ve killed my son!”\n\nThe younger Ivan briefly regained consciousness and was reputed to have said “I die as a devoted son and most humble servant”. For the next few days, the elder Ivan prayed incessantly for a miracle, but to no avail, and the Tsarevich died on November 19, 1581.\n\nIvan’s death had grave consequences for Russia, since it left no competent heir to the throne. After the Czar’s death in 1584, his unprepared son Feodor I succeeded him with Godunov as de facto ruler. After Feodor’s death, Russia entered a period of political uncertainty known as the Time of Troubles.\n\nJanuary 16, 1547 – Grand Duke Ivan IV of Muscovy becomes the first Czar of Russia, replacing the 264-year-old Grand Duchy of Moscow with the Czardom of Russia.\n\nIvan IV Vasilyevich (August 25, 1530 – March 28, 1584), commonly known as Ivan the Terrible, or more accurately, “Ivan the Formidable” or “Ivan the Fearsome”, was the Grand Prince of Moscow from 1533 to 1547 and the first Czar of Russia from 1547 to 1584.\n\nIvan IV was the son of Vasili III Ivanovich Grand Prince of Moscow (1479 – 1533) and and his second wife, Elena Glinskaya, daughter of Prince Vasili Lvovich Glinsky from Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Serb Princess Ana Jakšić, member of the Jakšić family.\n\nIvan IV, Czar of all the Russia’s.\n\nWhen Ivan was three years old, his father died from an abscess and inflammation on his leg that developed into blood poisoning. Ivan was proclaimed the Grand Prince of Moscow at the request of his father. His mother Elena Glinskaya initially acted as regent, but she died of what many believe to be assassination by poison, in 1538 when Ivan was only eight years old.\n\nThe regency then alternated between several feuding boyar families fighting for control. According to his own letters, Ivan, along with his younger brother Yuri, often felt neglected and offended by the mighty boyars from the Shuisky and Belsky families. In a letter to Prince Kurbski Ivan remembers, “My brother Iurii, of blessed memory, and me they brought up like vagrants and children of the poorest. What have I suffered for want of garments and food!!” This account has been challenged by historian Edward L Keenan, who doubts the authenticity of the source in which these quotes are found.\n\nOn January 16, 1547, at age sixteen, Ivan was crowned Czar with Monomakh’s Cap at the Cathedral of the Dormition. He was the first to be crowned as “Czar of All the Russias.” Prior to this, rulers of Muscovy were crowned as Grand Princes of Moscow although Ivan III the Great had styled himself “Czar” in his correspondence. Two weeks after his coronation, Ivan married his first wife Anastasia Romanovna, a member of the Romanov family, who became the first Russian Czarina.\n\nBy being crowned Czar, Ivan was sending a message to the world and to Russia: he was now the only supreme ruler of the country, and his will was not to be questioned. “The new title symbolized an assumption of powers equivalent and parallel to those held by former Byzantine Emperor and the Tatar Khan, both known in Russian sources as Czar. The political effect was to elevate Ivan’s position.”\n\nMonomakh’s Cap\n\nThe new title not only secured the throne, but it also granted Ivan a new dimension of power, one intimately tied to religion. He was now a “divine” leader appointed to enact God’s will, as “church texts described Old Testament kings as ‘czar’ and Christ as the Heavenly Czar. The newly appointed title was then passed on from generation to generation: “succeeding Muscovite rulers … benefited from the divine nature of the power of the Russian monarch … crystallized during Ivan’s reign.”\n\nBackground on the title of Czar\n\nCzar is a title used to designate East and South Slavic monarchs or supreme rulers of Eastern Europe, originally the Bulgarian monarchs from 10th century onwards, much later a title for two rulers of the Serbian State, and from 1547 the supreme ruler of the Czar of Russia and the Russian Empire. In this last capacity it lends its name to a system of government, Czarist autocracy or Czarism.\n\nThe term is derived from the Latin word caesar, which was intended to mean “emperor” in the European medieval sense of the term—a ruler with the same rank as a Roman emperor, holding it by the approval of another emperor or a supreme ecclesiastical official (the Pope or the Ecumenical Patriarch)—but was usually considered by western Europeans to be equivalent to King or to be somewhat in between a royal and imperial rank.\n\nIvan the Terrible Showing His Treasures to Jerome Horse, ambassador to Queen Elizabeth I of England.\n\nFollowing his assertion of independence from the khan, “Veliki Kniaz” Ivan III of Muscovy started to use the title of tsar regularly in diplomatic relations with the West. From about 1480, he is designated as “imperator” in his Latin correspondence, as “keyser” in his correspondence with the Swedish regent, and also as “kejser” in his correspondence with the Danish king, Teutonic Knights, and the Hanseatic League.\n\nIvan III’s son Vasily III continued using these titles. Sigismund von Herberstein observed that the titles of “kaiser” and “imperator” were attempts to render the Russian term “Czar” into German and Latin, respectively.\n\nThis was related to Russia’s growing ambitions to become an Orthodox “Third Rome”, after the Fall of Constantinople. The Muscovite ruler was recognized as an emperor by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I in 1514. Some foreign ambassadors—namely, Herberstein (in 1516 and 1525), Daniel Printz a Buchau (in 1576 and 1578) and Just Juel (in 1709)—indicated that the word “Czar” should not be translated as “emperor”, because it is applied by Russians to David, Solomon and other Biblical kings, who are simple reges.\n\nOn the other hand, Jacques Margeret, a bodyguard of False Demetrius I, argues that the title of “Czar” is more honorable for Muscovites than “kaiser” or “king” exactly because it was God and not some earthly potentate who ordained to apply it to David, Solomon, and other kings of Israel. Samuel Collins, a court physician to Tsar Alexis in 1659-66, styled the latter “Great Emperour”, commenting that “as for the word Czar, it has so near relation to Cesar… that it may well be granted to signifie Emperour. The Russians would have it to be an higher title than King, and yet they call David Czar, and our kings, Kirrols, probably from Carolus Quintus, whose history they have among them”.\n\nIn 1610 Sigismund III of Poland manipulated his son Władysław IV’s election as Czar of Russia while Polish forces held Moscow during the Time of Troubles following the death of Boris Godunov. His election, which never resulted in his assumption of the Muscovite throne, was part of an unsuccessful plan by Sigismund to conquer all of Russia and convert the population to Catholicism. As a young man Władysław showed ability as a military leader in operations against Muscovy (1617–18) and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn 1670, Pope Clement X expressed doubts that it would be appropriate for him to address Alexis as “Czar”, because the word is “barbarian” and because it stands for an emperor, a title reserved for the Holy Roman Emperor. Abbot Scarlati’s opined that the term is not translatable and therefore may be used by the Pope without any harm. In order to settle the matter and to assert his imperial ambitions more clearly, Peter I the Great issued an edict that raised Russia to an empire and decreed that the Latin title imperator should be used instead of Czar.\n\nBy 1815, when a large part of Poland was annexed, the title had clearly come to be interpreted in Russia as the equivalent of Polish król (“king”), and the Russian emperor assumed the title “Czar\n\nof Poland.”\n\nSince the word “Czar” remained the popular designation of the Russian monarch despite the official change of style, (from King to Emperor) it is commonly used in foreign languages such as English."
