        "text": "Ivan IV andRichard III - Part 1\n\nAbout Ivan IV and Henry VIII read hereand here.\n\na) The significance of reigns. Ivan IV reigned for 37 years (as Tsar), while Richard III's reign was extremely short, only 2 years. So trying to compare them as rulers is pretty difficult. Ivan's achievements during his reign are incompatible with ones of Richard III - Ivan was the first Russian Tsar, the one who established Tsardom of Russia, transformed the country from Medieval state to a large reformed centralized imperial state, etc. Richard III simply didn't manage to have any really important achievements during his short reign. Of course, it all has the impact as well of how these rulers and their reigns are viewed by academia and public in general. Ivan’s impact and achievements are too significant for Russian history to downplay them, just because of some of his dubious or questionable or even brutal actions. However, what was similar between them that they both belonged to old ruling dynasties, which, unlike Tudor dynasty, ruled for several hundreds of years (Plantagenets and Ruriks/Rurikids, respectively). What Ivan and Richard have also in common is the debates around them, like if they were truly despicable, maligned, to what degree, etc. Yet I might say, that while Ivan has his rich share of such debates, it’s still not comparable with debates around Richard III and, like, passion in these debates. But then frankly speaking I don’t think any other historical figure can compare in this regard with Richard III, from what I saw and read. He is some sort of curious anomaly.\n\nb) The descriptions. Both Richard III and Ivan IV were somewhat similar in that they were given pretty radical and scary description at times in some historical accounts : for example, according to one Tudor chronicle Richard III retained within his mother's womb for 2 years, was born with teeth and hair to his shoulders and was called scorpion. In another one he was called monster with talons. According to one of Russian historical accounts it was said that Ivan IV also was born with teeth, that the day he was born was a great storm with Moscow trembling in the flames of lightning and sounds of thunder. In another one it was said that Ivan ate human flesh and was referred to as vampire. Of course, such descriptions affected how these men were seen by people throughout the history. Needless to say, some of that stuff is clearly made up or exaggerated – and some stuff, like being born with teeth (if it was true), is just a show of outdated thinking and superstition when people thought that babies born with teeth were bad omen and evil.\n\nc) The family affairs. And another prime similarity of course the controversy about what they did with their relatives. While Richard's controversy is if he killed or didn't kill his deposed nephews, Ivan's controversy is if he killed or not his son and heir, also named Ivan. According to some sources Ivan IV had a very heated quarrel with his son and was believed to strike him on the head with his sceptre in a fit of rage and due to the wounds his son died several days later. Ivan was horrified of his own actions and crushed with grief. 3 years later he died himself and his another son Feodor succeeded him on the throne as new Tsar and ruled for 15 years. Other sources (and historians) dispute this version and point out that Ivan the heir was ill for quite some time and simply died because of it, and then rumours were spread that it was actually his father who killed him. While historians debate over this issue to this date, those who believe that Ivan indeed killed him (that’s frankly speaking the most popular version) usually view the situation (and Ivan himself) in the following way: 1) it was a very tragic accident; 2) it's seen in a wider context of the Rurik dynasty as a whole - Rurik dynasty from the very beginning had succession built on agnatic seniority (a patrilineal principle of inheritance where the order of succession to the throne prefers the monarch's younger brother over the monarch's own sons. A monarch's children (the next generation) often succeed only after the males of the elder generation have all been exhausted). Due to this, male members of Rurik dynasty repeatedly fought each other in order to take the throne and power – brothers against brothers, uncles against nephews, cousins against cousins and even fathers against sons (and vice versa) – and sometimes some of them succeeded and killed one another. That lasted almost as long as Rurik dynasty existed. So, in context of his forefathers, Ivan the Terrible really didn’t stand out that much. And while for Richard III the whole discourse \"whodunit\", it seems, is the prime moment for focus on him as historical figure, for Ivan the whole deal with his son is significant, but ultimately doesn't cancel out his other very important moments as historical figure.\n\nd) How they came to the throne and how they left it. Ivan was the eldest son and heir of Grand Prince Vasily III, he simply got the throne from him and was crowned as first Tsar of Russia. Thus Ivan was an undisputable legitimate ruler. Richard III on the other hand seized the crown from his nephew, Edward V. Richard's father wasn't King, Richard himself wasn't prince and his nephews were above him in the line of succession. So it affected of course how they were/are viewed as rulers. Richard was/is seen and presented by quite some as usurper , while Ivan wasn't/isn't. Another key difference between Richard and Ivan is that Richard’s dynasty, Plantagenets, ended on him and he's succeeded by the new dynasty, Tudors, which defeated him. Ivan’s dynasty, the Ruriks/Rurikids, ended on his sons. His son Feodor succeeded him, but died childless. His another son, Dmitry, was still young at the moment of his father death and died under mysterious circumstances years after his father’s death. Dmitry was the son from Ivan’s last uncanonical wife Maria Nagaya and his claim to the throne was weaker than those of Ivan’s sons from his canonical first marriage, but in the absence of any other living sons Dmitry would have become a new Tsar, and one of the most popular historical versions is that Dmitry was murdered by Boris Godunov, prominent courtier, whose sister was Feodor’s wife and Tsaritsa, Godunov after the end of the Rurik dynasty ascended the throne as new Tsar, tried to establish his own dynasty, failed and that led to years of instability and strife known as the Times of Troubles."
