Brown\n\nUser level: Level 7\n\n21,626 points\n\nFCE is very good and I assume that Avid is also good, but which is \"better\" for you depends on your personal requirements. No two people have completely identical priorities.\n\nContinuing the car analogy, one person may want speed and a raucous engine noise whilst another desires luxury, space and silence.\n\nThe best item is the one that does exactly what you want.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Dave Heron\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n0 points\n\nHello,\n\nI've been using Liquid 7.2 for about four years now, and I like it a lot. I'm just going to start with FCE on Christmas Day , well probably Boxing Day when I have my new Imac set up and FCE installed. I bought FCE mainly for HDV work as my PC needs upgrading and I haven't decided which way(editors) to go yet. The thing you need to know about Liquid is that it has reached the end of its development. There have been rumours circulating for at least two years now that it is being re developed, but there has never been any official word from Avid or Pinnacle. This is one of the reasons I am switching for the time being.\n\nAs for the program itself, it is very user friendly, extremely stable and is an all in one application in that it will author DVD's as well. It will handle a lot of different codecs, and it has a great community forum, some members of which are developing or have developed codecs which equate to Apple Intermediate.\n\nI myself am looking forward to working with FCE and seeing how different it is to Liquid.\n\nIt is said by many that Liquid is one if not the best value for money editors available and I would concur that it is excellent value for money.\n\nBtw I'm not plugging Liquid on an Apple forum, just answering the question and giving an opinion.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: ENIGMACODE\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n90 points\n\nIs Pinnacle Avid Liquid anything like the old Pinnacle Studio software?\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Dave Heron\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n0 points\n\nno it's light years ahead. Similar to FCE I guess, multi track editing for both video, sound etc.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Ian R. Brown\n\nUser level: Level 7\n\n21,626 points\n\nAt $1,499 you should really be comparing it with Final Cut Studio 3 ($999), not FCE 4 at $199.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Dave Heron\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n0 points\n\nThe basic version, i.e not Liquid pro retails at about Â£350. The pro version contains a break out box and this retails at about Â£700. I bouight mine as an upgrade from Studio for just less than Â£300.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: ENIGMACODE\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n90 points\n\nHello Ian! ðŸ™‚\n\nMy good freind! ðŸ™‚\n\nI'm sorry I haven't kept in touch. Merry Xmas to you! I've seen you here and there, and appreciate all your input! I'll drop you an email soon. Thanx for the explanation on Pinnacle. Yes that old Studio software was a real dog.\n\nHave you seen the latest trailer; http://vimeo.com/7340608\n\nAnd good luck JhnD!\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\nMike\n\nLink"
