        "text": "Hello JeffreyA2, May I know the system requirements for that Video editing software ( Pinnacle Studio 21 ) So that we can check with it and guide you with the correct edition.\n\nHere are the system requirements.\n\nInternet connection required for installation, registration and updates. Registration required for product use.\n\nWindows 10 recommended, Windows 8.x, Windows 7, 64-bit OS highly recommended\n\nIntel Core i3 or AMD A4 3.0 GHz or higher\n\nIntel Core i5 or i7 1.06 GHz or higher required for AVCHD & Intel Quick Sync Video support\n\nIntel Core i7 or AMD Athlon A10 or higher for UHD, Multi-Camera or 360 video\n\n4 GB of RAM or higher, 8+GB highly recommended for UHD, Multi-Camera, or 360 video\n\nDirectX graphics device recommended:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce 400 series / Quadro 600 (Fermi-based) or newer (CUDA-enabled required for CUDA support)\n\nATI Radeon HD 5XXX series or higher\n\nIntel HD Graphics from Ivy Bridge or higher\n\nHEVC (H.265) support requires Windows 10 and supporting PC hardware or graphics card\n\nMinimum 256MB VGA VRAM, 512MB or higher recommended\n\nDisplay resolution: 1024 x 768 or higher\n\nWindows-compatible sound card (multi-channel output required for surround preview)\n\n8 GB HDD space for full installation\n\nIn this case, if you need > 8 GB of RAM for your program, then you will have to use the Pro edition (which allows for vRAM allocation more than the Standard edition does - as stated here). You may simply test it out for yourself by installing a trial Parallels Desktop version and a non-activated Windows virtual machine, as explained below:\n\n1.) Download a new Windows disk image file from here and ensure that the download completes successfully.\n\n2.) Begin installing Windows, using the disk image file downloaded earlier.\n\n3.) In the screen titled \"Name and Location\", select 'Customize settings before installation' and click on 'Continue'.\n\n4.) In the virtual machine configuration window that appears, navigate to Hardware -> CPU & Memory and allocate 2 processors (or just 1 if the total number of available processors is just 2) and 2 GB of memory for Windows [or just 1 GB if total Mac memory is only 2 GB (or) 4 GB if total Mac memory is 8 GB (or) half the available RAM value if total Mac memory is > 8 GB].\n\n5.) Select 'Graphics' and allocate 1 GB of video memory and select 'Scaled' for 'Resolution'.\n\n6.) Ensure that 'Vertical Synchronization' is enabled and 'DirectX 10' is selected for '3D Acceleration' under 'Advanced Settings'.\n\n7.) Close the window and proceed with the installation.\n\n8.) Download and install your software within Windows."
