That was supposed to make everybody get a warm fuzzy and rush out and buy it.\n\nIt turns out that the product is a disaster with almost every post being something negative about how the product is so buggy.\n\nI'm so glad that I ditched Pinnacle Studio in and replaced it with Sony Vegas Movie Studio which works flawless for me on both of my computers.\n\nI wish that it included SmartSound though. I miss that feature.\n\nComments\n\nReport as questionable\n\nAre you sure you want to report this postuser as questionable?\n\nYou may be blocked if you misuse this feature!"
