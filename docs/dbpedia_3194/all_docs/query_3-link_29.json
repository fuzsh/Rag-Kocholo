        "text": "From time to time I get the opportunity to try out new software, and am happy to give my views about it here. In the past, I gave regular reviews of Pinnacle Studio through every version from Studio 200 - in fact, these pages were originally created to help people over the difficulties encountered getting those early original hybrid editors to work - the first versions edited using non-linear techniques, but âmade back to tapeâ using linear techniques involving an infra-red strobe to control a VHS recorder. Much depended on the make of VHS recorder - how long it took to get up to speed and so on. Those were the days. Pinnacle Studio metamorphosed several times, ultimately being replaced - as Pinnacle Studio 16 - by what was intended to be Avid Studio 2 (a different beast with a similar look, designed initially to replace Pinnacle/Avid Liquid - which went End of Line). Then it was taken over from Avid by Corel â¦ and although I have a copy of Avid Studio 2/Pinnacle 16, I never use it. I also have a copy of Serif MoviePlus which I occasionally do use, but my main editor these days is Avid Media Composer (6).\n\nIn these new pages I have resurrected a couple of reviews from the âoldâ pages that are still relevant, and will from time to time add to them, as and when I use new âstuffââ.\n\nIf youâve never used this, youâre missing out on an inexpensive yet extremely powerful titling editor that is capable of so much more than just titling.
