        "text": "Reports of the demise of this Web site are greatly exaggerated! We at sheldonbrown.com thank Harris Cyclery for its support over the years. Harris Cyclery has closed, but we keep going. Keep visiting the site for new and updated articles, and news about possible new affilations.\n\nPerspective on this Review\n\nThings I Like\n\nInstallation Issues\n\nHelp, Manual, User Interface\n\nUsability Issues\n\nAudio Issues\n\nStorage Issues\n\nAudio Issues\n\nCopying Between Files\n\nBugs and Annoyances\n\nPerspective on this Review\n\nThings I Like\n\nInstallation issues\n\nSome of the following comments are as of May 2013, and changes may have occurred since then.\n\nRegistering Pinnacle Studio 16 is can be confusing. Access to support registration is only by clicking on the \"to submit a technical question\" line in the registration e-mail. Clicking on Online Support > Technical Support from Help in Pinnacle 16 doesn't go to that same place.\n\nAvid Studio and Pinnacle Studio 16 claim to need a screen at least 1200 x 768 but it will run on a smaller screen. My primary (work) screen is 1024 x 768 and I have a second, viewing screen which is 1920 x 1080. Video playback can be moved to the second screen. Turning the primary monitor to portrait orientation can make it display the work screen better, especially when looking through a Library.\n\nWhen you have used an optional effects plugin such as Red Giant in a project, be sure to install the plugin if you are reinstalling Pinnacle or installing it on a different system. If you don't, the effects will not work and other things as well can go wrong.\n\nWhen setting up Pinnacle Studio 16, you need to be careful how you import files. Following installation, Pinnacle 16 may copy all of your video files onto your computer's C: drive. That will take a very long time and can overflow the drive if you have much video. Be sure to select \"link\" instead unless you are importing from external media -- tape, memory chip, DVD. Then you will usually want to copy the content onto a hard drive. If the data is already stored on a hard drive on your computer, you usually will not want to copy it. (An exception would be to copy from an external hard drive which you use only for archiving.) Be careful not so have \"delete original file\" selected, if you only want to copy a file or link to it.\n\nIt is better not to keep large video files on your boot drive. Use another hard drive for that data.\n\nI changed \"copy\" to \"link\" in the Import dialog box, and directed the Library function to access the folders where I keep files for my first project.\n\nI had to install activation keys to view and use files encoded with h.264 compression -- .mp4 files, and many others besides. These files all appeared with a lock icon and a play arrow, and I didn't see how to get the key to unlock the files until I clicked on the icon to play one of the the files which wouldn't play. I was then informed that I had to purchase a key, but the key installed for free. If a key is free, what is the point? (Maybe it's to assure that they are being unlocked only by people who have purchased the software legally and registered it?...) Installation of activation keys is accessed in the Help menu rather than the Control Panel. This is not exactly an example of the best user interface management, but oh well, OK, it worked. Now, more about that user interface...\n\nHelp, Manual, User interface\n\nMore Usability issues\n\nIn Pinnacle v. 15, Scorefitter is accessed by the menu item \"create background music\" in the Tools menu. In Avid, and Pinnacle v. 16, Scorefitter is accessed by clicking on a G-clef icon above the timeline. A G clef could have any of a number of meanings. Again, you need to know the right words (\"Scorefitter\", \"Audio Creation tools\") to look up the help on this topic -- \"Music\" doesn't get you there --, though in this case, the icon is shown in the Help.\n\nIn Pinnacle v. 15, the icons at the left side of the screen (already mentioned) select among video clips, transitions, still images, audio and pre-designed titles. In Avid, and Pinnacle v. 16, dissolves and fades are accessed by dragging on the upper right or upper left of a clip in the timeline, something that you aren't going to figure out until you look it up in the manual. The lookups shouldn't be necessary. The actual clicking and dragging is easier to use, once you have figured it out.\n\nIn Avid, and Pinnacle v. 16, there is no keyframe automatically placed at the end of a clip. This is an improvement, because it avoids the need to readjust parameters if those of the previous keyframe have been changed.\n\nThere are some odd, obsolete or off-topic items in the manual's glossary in Avid, and in Pinnacle v. 16 -- listings for Extended Parallel Port (most PCs don't have a parallel port at all any more); IRQ, which is something that PC users don't have to think about any more. \"Non-interlaced...A non-interlaced image (most computer monitors) flickers much less than an interlaced image (most TVs).\" Not true, the purpose of interlace is to avoid flicker at low frame rates on CRT monitors where the image goes dark between scans -- and so on. The manual needs a complete rewrite.\n\nSome Audio Issues\n\nResizing and splitting clips\n\nIn all versions, resizing or splitting a clip makes the positions of keyframe proportional to the new length of the clip. It is very unfortunate that this behavior can't be turned off. You have precisely located your keyframes, for example, to pan and zoom a clip, and if you shorten or lengthen a clip, the changes move to different times. I split clips ahead of time, either side of the place where I will be using keyframes, so as to confine the damage. Another workaround is to leave the clip the same length and overlay it on a different track, rather than to split it.\n\nYou split clips in Pinnacle Studio v. 15 using the \"Split Clip\" menu command, which appears in the clip properties right-click menu and also in the Edit menu at the top of the screen. In Avid Studio and Pinnacle v. 16, you split clips using an icon of a razor blade, an antiqued convention from the days of movie film and reel-to-reel audio tape. (like using an icon of a floppy disc for \"save...\") This difference highlights an important distinction between ease of learning and ease of use. They are not the same.\n\nIn Pinnacle Studio v. 15, if you have two clips from the same source file lined up so the transition matches, you can recombine them back into a single clip. I didn't find any way to recombine clips in Avid Studio or Pinnacle Studio v. 15, once they have been split. Maybe there is, but I have yet to find it.\n\nFile storage, backups and crash recovery\n\nCopying and Pasting Between Projects\n\nThese applications can only have one project open at a time. It is, however, possible to copy and paste material between projects by opening the source project, copying, then closing that project, opening the destination project, and pasting.\n\nBoth projects need to be in the same file format, and the source files must be where the destination project can find them.\n\nIn this way, you can copy and paste multiple clips at once, along with the the formatting instructions from the source project.\n\nOne you have exported a video, you can use it, or part of it, as a clip in another project, but you can't change the edits in it.\n\nAvid Studio and Pinnacle Studio v. 16 let you include a previous project in the timeline as a \"subproject\" --another way to copy material which has already been edited.\n\nSome bugs and pointless annoyances.\n\nThese occurred in Avid Studio. and may also occur in Pinnacle Studio v. 16, but I haven't checked them all. I'll indicate which ones I have.\n\n(Checked) The splash screen sits in front of anything else while the program is loading, taking up to 20 seconds on my fast desktop computer -- a serious case of bad manners.\n\n(Checked!) Opening files from earlier versions is not intuitive. Most software just lets you click on the file in Windows Explorer. In Pinnacle Studio 16, you must use FILE, import previous project.\n\n(Checked!) The section on \"Video Tools\" in the Help is emblematic of my issues with the Help. This section reads like a specification written for programmers assigned the task of creating a graphic user interface, when the interface does not yet exist. Each function of the Video Editor preview is described in detail in words, but there is no image to illustrate most of them.\n\n(Fixed!) All of the controls for the Preview window are described as being below it, but the time code display is actually above it.\n\nThere's nothing in Help about how to exit loop mode (which plays a clip repeatedly). You must click on the Exit Trim Mode icon above the timeline -- or click on the loop icon a second time: it is a toggle.\n\nThe timeline Marker function in Avid Studio and Pinnacle Studio v. 16 places markers in the timeline rather than inside clips, making it useless to adjust timing of one clip relative to another. However, if you place a market in a clip in the Effects Editor, that marker will stay in the same place in the clip, and even if you adjust the start or end time, and also will be visible in the timeline. This is covered somewhere in Naylor's book, but it it not intuitive and not covered in the Help -- or in Naylor's index.\n\nThe \"import from\" panel pushes everything else in the import dialog box to the right, occupying an entire column on the screen even though it only sits at the top of the column. The parameters dialog box occupies the entire right column. They could both be at one side or at the top and then the entire remainder of the screen could be filled with content. There can be hundreds of photos or clips in a folder, and it doesn't make any sense to waste screen space.\n\n(Checked this!) It is very easy to see in Pinnacle v .15 which clips are selected in the timeline: they turn a very different color. In Avid, and Pinnacle v. 16, they stay nearly the same yellow color and get a thin, almost invisible orange outline. It is easy to make mistakes when cutting or deleting clips, and have to hit the Undo button and try again.\n\n(Checked this!)In the Effects Editor, there is a File menu header but there is nothing in the menu except \"create new shortcut\" and it is grayed out.\n\n(Checked!) There is a \"back\" button in the Help, but no \"Forward button! There is a \"Forward\" menu item under 'Options\".\n\nOnce you have used the \"back one frame at a time\" arrow under the Preview window in Avid, the \"Forward one Frame at a time\" arrow also works backwards; you can get past this problem by clicking on the \"play\" arrow.\n\n(Checked.)When the playback head is snapped to a keyframe diamond, it doesn't always line up exactly with the diamond. The values of effects are those at the playback head location, not the diamond location. Clicking on \"delete\" deletes the diamond. Changing a value creates a new keyframe.\n\n(New!) The active keyframe in the Effects Editor does not \"glow\" in Pinnacle Studio v. 16 as it does in Avid Studio. You have to look at the keyframe icon to see whether the cursor is aligned directly over the keyframe.\n\n(New!) I can't get the speed function in Pinnacle Studio 16 to work. It works in the earlier products. (I think this is a usability issue. I did get it to work later but the controls are different.\n\n\"Browse for folder\" doesn't either ask for a response, or close automatically, when the program is closed.\n\nIf the frame for a title extends off the screen, a multi-line title may show entirely on the screen when editing, but extend off the screen instead when exporting the project.\n\n(Fixed!) As described earlier, overwrite mode does not work for voice-overs.\n\n(Checked) It isn't possible to remove the display from the second monitor when the program is in Export mode -- when that display is in any case frozen and useless. You must complete or abort the export and return to movie mode to clear the second monitor.\n\n(New!) Sometimes the record-playback head gets stuck so that if you move it to a new time and then try to start play, it instead only just jumps back to its earlier location. You may have to save, close and reopen the project to restore function.\n\nIn both Pinnacle 15 and Pinnacle 16, sometimes there is a gaps in the audio when audio is detached from video and butting one part of an audio clip up against another. Workaround: place one of the audio clips in a different track.\n\nIf you display a video source clip on the second monitor, and you have also put the timeline display on that monitor, your icon in the upper right of the small display only switches between these two displays on the second monitor. To clear the second monitor, you must switch to a resource which displays in its own window, such as an audio clip, or click on \"source\" above the preview window.\n\nSometimes exporting of a file will stop at 99%. The exported file will have a long number as its name. Sometimes it will play and sometimes not. You may have to change the file extension to the one you intended. I find that this happens when a Scorefitter track extends past the last video in a project. Placing a blank title at the end, extending past the end of the audio, has solved thsi problem for me.\n\nLinks:\n\nThe Garmin VIRB 360 camera\n\nThe Sony AS100V helmet camera\n\nthe Mobius M800 action camera/dashcam\n\nThe Contour HD1080 helmet camera\n\nThe GoPro Helmet Hero HD helmet camera\n\nThe GoPro Session action camera\n\nSynchronizing multi-camera shoots\n\nImage stabilization for bicycle video\n\nVirtualDub video processor\n\nImage stabilization plugin for VirtualDub\n\nDeinterlacing in VirtualDub\n\nSaving to MP4 in VirtualDub\n\nUsing VirtualDub to improve video from VHS tape\n\nPinnacle and Avid editing software\n\nFive Ways to Create a Picture in Picture in Pinnacle Studio Ultimate\n\nPinnacle overwrites voiceovers...\n\nTechmoan Web site -- reviews of action cams\n\nWhat's New\n\nSheldon Brown on Facebook\n\nSite Feedback & Questions\n\nArticles by Sheldon Brown and Others\n\nWhat's New\n\nBeginners\n\nBicycle Glossary\n\nBrakes\n\nCommuting\n\nCyclecomputers\n\nDo-It-Yourself\n\nEssays and Fiction\n\nFamily Cycling\n\nFixed-Gear\n\nFrames\n\nGears and Drivetrains\n\nHumor\n\nOld Bikes\n\nRepair Tips\n\nSinglespeed\n\nTandems\n\nTouring\n\nVideo\n\nWheels\n\nTranslations\n\nSheldon - the man\n\nReports of the demise of this Web site are greatly exaggerated!
