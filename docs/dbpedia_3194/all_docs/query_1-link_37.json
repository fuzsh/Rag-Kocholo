Improvise on the fly with Blend Modes and choose how one clip blends with another—from creating a superimposed effect, to blending masked areas, or creating light bleeds or other color and exposure effects. Each Blend Mode uses a different formula to combine the color and brightness values in a selected clip with the values in an underlying clip. Why limit your creative vision by grounding it in reality? Adjust white balance , correct underexposed scenes, and apply instant corrections.\n\nUse special effects to introduce atmosphere and character to your production—make it look like an old movie or an indie film, transform scenes from rain to shine, and much more.

Experiment with Selective Color to highlight a single hue and draw focus to an important facet of your scenery. Although there are a couple of thousand ready-made templates, transitions and effects, there are very few of them that most people would want to use unless they were trying to impress the easily pleased.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the more basic types of transition, such as fade to white, I have yet to discover. Fade to black is also missing, but can be achieved by folding over a corner of a clip - provided the clip is long enough. The preset themes now include at least some applicable to users this side of The Pond, but are still somewhat biased towards North American enthusiasts.\n\nTo be fair, most of the transitions and effects can be customised, though for some reason I could not get some of them to work at all, and there are more than a few that are duplicated under different names.\n\nWhen deciding which transition to apply, hovering the mouse pointer over the name of the transition should give you a preview of the effect, but it is very hit and miss. Importing movies is not without its faults. You can opt for them to be automatically broken down into more manageable clips called 'scenes' , either by content, date or a set length. If you choose content, you will almost certainly find that at the end of each scene there are up to a dozen frames from the front of the next scene.\n\nThese can be very irritating to remove, especially from a long movie where you might wish to move scenes around or edit them out. And while these odds and ends can be cut off one scene, there is no way to join them to another - I'm sure this was posssible in earlier versions of Studio.\n\nYou can of course place these offcuts where you want them, but then if the orphan has only a few frames, you cannot add any transitions between it and the following scene. In one instance, I separately imported three movies and elected for each of them to be broken down into scenes. This worked well for the first movie, but even though Studio was working in a discrete environment each time, the scenes displayed for the second and third movies included up to a dozen scenes from the earlier movies.\n\nTo make matters worse, some scenes from the subsequent movies were missing and had to be manually extracted. While playing back or editing individual scenes on the timeline, for reasons best known to itself, when the playback was stopped the video scrubber would often return to the start of the movie - very annoying when you are working 50 or more scenes away.\n\nAs in previous versions, menus are somewhat daunting and not always intuitive. Efforts have clearly been made to improve this area, but it just doesn't seem to work reliably.\n\nI created a Menu and Sub-menu to offer the option to view the movie all the way through, or to select to view any of the ten chapters and be returned to the Menu each time. This is a facility on the top of most users' wish lists that was missing in previous versions.\n\nI set it up very carefully, and Studio did indeed place its chapter numbers and returns exactly where I had put my markers, displaying the results in the sub-menu. But when I ran a simulation of the movie, selecting 'Play All' it jumped to Chapter 8 the first time, then Chapter 6 the second time. Choosing the option to go to 'Chapter Selection' by-passed the sub-menu altogether and went randomly to any chapter it felt like. A thorough check of my markers and the chapter numbers on the timeline showed that everything was correctly recorded, but still the menus wouldn't function properly.\n\nAt this point I gave up, saved my work, closed down Studio and went off to make a cup of tea. When I returned, I fired up Studio, loaded the movie and, lo and behold, the menus worked perfectly.\n\nDisc burning has improved, though the interface is not so user-friendly as it used to be. However, there was a worrying 12 minute wait for the writing of the lead-out file to complete. An earlier similarly structured 1. All in all, Studio 16 is an improvement over previous versions, and it feels more stable, if slower. Trying to work too quickly can confuse it, but given a steady pace it gets there in the end. As others have pointed out, this is not really Pinnacle 16 but Avid 2, and there is a bit of a learning curve even for the seasoned user.\n\nThere is no search facility, and twice it pointed me to options on the Studio menu bar which didn't exist in Version For my money, the Ultimate version is not really worth the extra few pounds, but others may beg to differ. One other very strange behaviour of Studio 16 is that, whenever it is loaded in Windows, even if it is minimised to the taskbar, it over-rides the Windows Power Settings, so that your computer and screen will not go into standby mode.\n\nAnd it constantly tries to connect to 'The Cloud', even if you have elected not to activate this facility. I wonder why? Tech Specs. About the Pinnacle Studio Trial The trial is a day period.
