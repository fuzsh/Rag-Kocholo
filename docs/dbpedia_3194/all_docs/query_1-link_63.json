While most recent video editors can import these files, in some cases, they will struggle to display the video realtime in your timeline as you move through it during an editing session.\n\nFor example, often MP4 files contain H.264/AVC video and a Mpeg4 AAC audio track. When I drop MP4 clips onto the timeline and then try and scroll through them, PEL will stutter and lag behind as it tries to render them in realtime. On the other hand, if I edit clips that are taken from my DV camcorder (which are huge), PEL sails along super smooth.\n\nSo while I agree with Andy, you can transcode the MP4 files to make them easier to edit, I personally dislike the additional step, which can be quite time consuming as well.\n\nKitsuneAndy wrote:\n\nbluechair84 wrote:\n\nWhat do you mean by transcode? I have had to save .mov files as .avi before I could edit them. Is that something like this?\n\nRight,\n\nThere's basically two parts to video file encoding. There's the Codec, which might be huffy or h.264 etc etc and then there's the container, which might .avi or .mov etc\n\nTranscoding converts the underlying codec. If you transcode it to a an editing format like Huffy, the files will be bigger, but will lose less data when you edit them. h.264 and other delivery codecs are a lot smaller, but you lose a lot more data when you edit them and they can have choppy playback in some applications.\n\nUntil recently a lot of the \"pro\" editing software wouldn't even import a h.264 file at all for this very reason.\n\nSo yes, it's similar to converting from .avi to .mov, but with subtle but important differences.\n\nhttp://avidemux.sourceforge.net/\n\nhttp://www.videohelp.com/tools/HuffYUV"
