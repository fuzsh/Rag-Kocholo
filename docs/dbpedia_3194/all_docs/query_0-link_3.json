It’s the new ZEOS Contenda. More features than the Gateway Handbook. Cheaper than a Dell 320SLi by a long shot! And with the kind of quality, performance and support you’ve come to expect from one company, and one company only: ZEOS. rnmmmmm Power ON ZEOS just won PC Magazine’s Readers’ Choice for Service & Reliability (February 9,1993). We’re the only PC vendor to earn the “Excellent” rating for both our laptop and desktop systems! Smaller than a notebook, powerful as a desktop. At only 3.9 lbs., the new ZEOS Contenda keeps you light on your feet. FEATURES THAT PULL NO PUNCHES. PC Week calls it \"the best yet of the new crop of lightweight, full- featured machines.” And the chart says it all. Smart, powerful Intel 386SL CPU. A crisp, vibrant VGA backlit screen. Enough power and memory to easily run Windows: Standard 80MB hard drive and memory all the way up to 10MB. A built-in track ball. Up to 4 hours of power. Less than 4 pounds in weight. And that’s not all. IT COULD BE THE ONLY PC YOU'LL EVER NEED! This is what you’ve been waiting for — the one PC to take with you everywhere you want to go! Because it’s impossible to find a notebook on the market today that’s this light, this small, this affordable — and still gives you so much power. But with the ZEOS Contenda, it’s all here. Like the SL processor. Accord¬ ing to PC Magazine, when it comes to notebooks, you should look for Intel’s SL processor. The ZEOS Contenda’s Intel CPU extends your battery life significantly — because it’s intelligent enough to power-down the memory, disks, modem and more when they’re not in use. And you’ll find die Contenda gives you the power and room for practically everything you’d use in a desktop system!

Why aren’t more of these bargains better known? Because of the work involved in unearthing them. Our search for the best software bargains started with 4MB of product listings and then reached to electronic bulletin boards, PC user groups, and a wide selection of retailers. We fed these prod¬ uct listings and many of the programs through a pair of massively parallel neural networks trained for years to rec¬ ognize good software. One of these neural networks was dedicated to iden¬ tifying the best $50 Windows applica¬ tions. Its name is Scott Dunn. The other concentrated on DOS programs. Its name is Steve Bass. Contributing Editors Scott and Steve came away from this experience with overloaded dendrites and fractured social lives. Thanks to them, you’ll come away knowing about some inexpensive pro¬ grams that make your PC more useful than ever. Would you grab a couple of these bar¬ gain software packages, if only your hard drive had more free space? You should read “Buyers’ Guide: 200MB Hard Disks.” Manufacturers’ specifica¬ tions of seek times and transfer rates say nothing about how drives will affect your daily business computing. We test¬ ed 14 drives to see how they affected the performance of real application pro¬ grams. Benefits were huge on some programs and trivial on others. Con¬ tributing Editor George Campbell sum¬ marizes the findings of the PC World Test Center and demystifies the other issues in¬ volved in buying a new hard disk either locally or direct. Not long ago a $2000 notebook fully outfitted for Windows was un¬ thinkable. This month we test 20 such note¬ books and report on 6 others that arrived too late for review. The price of our Best Buy notebook from Septem¬ ber 1992, the Dell Di¬ mension NL25, has dropped almost $1000 in five months — yet 7 other Windows notebooks in this roundup sell for less than the Dell. Two Views of Usability This month’s notebook review is anoth¬ er example of how the PC World Test Center is incorporating usability testing into our review process. Rather than use robots to press keys and test battery en¬ durance, we asked real PC users to fol¬ low a script driving real applications. As a result, we not only got more realistic measures of battery life, but we also gathered extensive feedback from ten users on keyboards, screens, and point¬ ing devices. The observations about keyboards were illuminating. Prefer¬ ences in keyboards varied enormously. So instead of telling you one editor’s opinion of which keyboard felt best, we provide enough information to pick the keyboard that suits your preferences. For his Business Fixtures column, Thom Foulks continually examines products to determine which should become fixtures in your business. Thom’s viewpoint complements our large group product reviews, in which we give a host of products an intense, PC World Editor in Chief Phil Lemmons systematic, but necessari¬ ly time-limited workout to bring you current com¬ parative ratings. Thom’s longer-term product usage often enables him to make observations that escape the notice of a conscientious reviewer who tests a dozen products each month. For example, Thom’s early annoyance with Delrina’s WinFax Pro 3.0 corroborated the findings of our February review of Windows fax programs, in which our panel of newcomers to fax software rated Delrina’s program strong in fea¬ tures but weak in usability. But over time, Thom’s annoyance gave way to enthusiastic endorsement of WinFax Pro 3.0 as the fax program by which all others should be measured. Thom also reports his observations on Micrografx’s ABC Flowcharter 2.0, MSI’s Cachet optical disk drive, SWFTE’s Typecase II, and Richmond Technologies & Software’s Maximizer for Windows.

I like the new no¬ frills, professional look of the magazine as well. Special kudos go to whoever made the decision to expand the “Here’s How” section. I do have one suggestion. I see lots of reviews of monitors, CPUs, and entire systems. However, I have yet to find a review of hard drives or caching con¬ troller upgrades. David Heupel, Tallahassee , Florida Editor’s response: We review 200MB and larger hard drives in this issue’s buyers’ guide. And you can look for¬ ward to a comparison of caching hard¬ ware and software in the June issue. What About that New Window? The December issue’s “Windows NT: A DOS for the ’90s” was a very thought-provoking piece. I’m not a Windows fan, but Scott Spanbauer made me want to take NT for a test run. I wouldn’t mind buying all the hardware to mn the thing either, since it sounds like NT will solve some of my basic problems. But Spanbauer says that NT’s sup¬ port for DOS will be limited. If I read the article correctly, only the major DOS applications will mn under NT. My company has invested thousands of dollars in a customized DOS data¬ base for our credit department. We’ve also invested big bucks in NetWare. Is all that investment lost with NT? Frankly, I’ve been led to believe that OS/2 would be better for us since we wouldn’t have to throw out what we already have. Am I wrong? Bill Ramsey, via PC World Online Editor’s response: Whether your ap¬ plication will run under Windows NT really depends on how it interfaces with DOS. According to Microsoft, if the application avoids direct BIOS calls and doesn’t bypass the operating system when accessing system hardware, it should run under NT. It’s too soon to tell how Windows NT will actually per¬ form and what its hardware require¬ ments will be when released. OS/2 may work for you, depending on what hardware and software you currently use — users I’ve heard from are either ecstatic about OS/2 or infuriated by it. For now, MS-DOS is still the best DOS. — Scott Spanbauer Cheaper to Toss the Computer? Just a compliment for an excellent December issue. I especially appreci¬ ated “The Complete Guide to the New CPUs,” particularly the informa¬ tion that Cyrix was considering coming out with an upgrade for 386SX comput¬ ers. I’d like to see a more in-depth arti¬ cle on this subject and what Cyrix is planning. Many people bought 386SXs because they were good entry-level machines before the Windows power drain. It seems a shame that it’s cheaper to throw the machine out than to upgrade it. But if a new chip costs only a couple hundred bucks, there’s hope. Danny Sullivan, Balboa, California CPU Enlightenment I just wanted to tell you that your December issue was one of the best that you’ve published. Especially well done was the article on current and future CPU chips and upgrade paths (“The Complete Guide to the New CPUs”) for those of us with ancient 386s. Keep up the good work — we need a magazine with timely, useful information and a minimum of gee- whiz hype. Sandy Rohrbacher, Lafayette, New Jersey Taking the Heat Your recently published criticisms of FastMicro (“Readers Rate Direct- Sale Vendors” in November, and “486SX-25s vs. 386DX-40s: The Up¬ start Fights Back” in December) took a lot of guts. My opinion of PC World’s editorial independence and integrity increased enormously after reading your comments. I read several other com¬ puter magazines and they almost never print anything negative about any of their advertisers. By the way, I pur¬ chased a FastMicro computer last August and experienced many of the problems you described. J. Grothe, via PC World Online Strange But True Strange as it may seem — and contrary to the information supplied by Paul Litwin in his “Microsoft’s Accessible Database” in December — Microsoft’s relational database Access 1.0 cannot import data from Microsoft’s FoxPro. Jonathan Cohen, Amsterdam Editor’s response: Access can read and write dBASE DBF files, which FoxPro uses, but it can’t read or write Fox’s pro¬ prietary indexes and memo fields. This is definitely a flaw in the program and an error on our part for not noting it. Taking Tiger to Task I called TigerSoftware after I saw your assurance in December’s Consumer Watch that they would honor the price on CD ROMs offered in their adver¬ tisements in your November issue. APRIL 1993 • PC WORLD 17 Contrary to what you indicated, Tiger still refused to sell the disks unless I purchased a player. Dennis Dirks, East Northport, New York Editor’s response: Tiger told Consumer Watch that, because of the mistake in their ad, they would honor the price of the CD ROMs without insisting that consumers buy the player from them. However, due to Tiger’s contract with their suppliers they were unable to honor this promise. Unfortu¬ nately Tiger didn’t tell Consumer Watch about the problem until after press time. Offended Cartographers n December’s “What’s Next,” Mike Hogan has done a disservice to the Amer¬ ican Automobile Association and its cartog¬ raphy department. He implies that AAA maps provide inaccurate information. AAA road reporters, each of whom drive between 50,000 and 60,000 miles annually on North American roads, collect information on mileage, interchange signs and designs, exit numbers, rest areas, gas, food, lodging, and travel restrictions. Their current data is inte¬ grated into all appropriate cartographic products on an annual basis. Furthermore, the comparison of hard copy to digital maps is mixing apples and oranges. Each product has a specific func¬ tional niche. Paper maps in and of them¬ selves do not predict distance, travel time, and the fastest route. They serve as an inex¬ pensive, multipurpose, geo-referential tool for human beings. An occasional traveler can hardly justify the expenditure of more than $100 on software, not to mention the cost of a portable computer, when a $3 map will do. That would be like hunting a duck with a cannon. Stan Grzeda, Director of Cartography, Travel Publishing Department, American Automobile Association Bugged by Bad Counsel y eyes bugged out of my head when I saw your advice in the January Help Line on where to find a comprehensive list¬ ing of CD ROMs. For the same price of $199, you could get a subscription to the Nautilus multimedia information service (800/637-3472 or 614/766-3165) on CD ROM for the next year (12 issues) and still <> POWER TIP.. 273 Accessing WordPerfect’s Special Characters In WordPerfect 5.x, the CHARACTR- .DOC file contains a tabular listing of special characters, their character map numbers, and a short label for each character.

Evan Morris , Vancouver, Washington Corrections and Clarifications ur February review of 486 systems con¬ tained a pricing error on the Best Buy Acma 486DX2/50. Although the $2395 December price listed for the system with a 15-inch monitor was correct, the October price should have been listed as $2495. Contact Acma at 800/786-6888 to get a cur¬ rent price quote. The same article gave the incorrect street price for the Best Buy AcerPower 486e DX2/50. The correct price is $2735. We published the wrong street price for the Best Buy Packard Bell 486SX/25 reviewed in our December 1992 issue. The price should have been $1930. In Tip #17 of the January article “75 Win¬ dows and DOS Speedup Tips,” page 126, the batch file’s second line should have read IF EXIST C:\\WIND0WS\\%1\\NUL GOTO MAIN (note the L in ‘NUL’). In the User Group Tip “Easy WordPer¬ fect Dot” on page 212 of the January issue, the correct key sequence is <Alt>-<F6>. The chart that accompanied “OS/2 Versus Windows NT” in February should have stated that neither OS/2 2.0 nor Windows NT can handle the Windows applications that require 386 enhanced mode. Contrary to the January New Products pre¬ view, the Gateway 2000 4DX2-66V does not have a 238-pin upgrade socket; the Zeos Upgradable does. Gateway plans to add an upgrade socket in a future machine.

It’s called NETROOM - the award winning memory manager that uses the newest technologies to shatter mem¬ ory barriers, giving you more memory and a faster system. CRASH-PROOF With “Customize”, NETROOM’s crash-proof installation utility, you can configure all of NETROOM’s features automatically - just type one command and you’re done! Even if you turn off your system in the middle, when you turn it back on “Customize” will pick up where it left off. Of course, you can always customize “Customize” if you like. But there’s more to memory manage¬ ment than just easy installation. NETROOM includes our revolutionary “Cloaking” technology - a technique that allows DOS drivers and TSRs to run in extended mem¬ ory as if they were running under Microsoft Windows™. Even if you never run Windows! If you do use Windows, you’ll find our cloaked utilities fully Windows-compatible. NETROOM provides a cloaked system BIOS for all compatible systems including ISA, EISA, MCA and Laptops. NETROOM’s cloaked BIOS is designed to run in the “pro¬ tected mode” of your 386/486 family proces¬ sor. This makes it safer to use. The cloaked BIOS also takes full advantage of the 32-bit power of your computer so it runs faster. And it doesn’t occupy any DOS memory, so you save up to 96K. Think of it as a free BIOS upgrade that saves memory and makes your system run faster. YOUR “FLU” SHOT IS BUILT IN In NETROOM, virus protection is integral to the cloaked BIOS. It detects when a virus or errant program tries to get at the most vital parts of your hard disk and pre¬ vents the damage before it begins. Our cloaked BIOS even stops attempts to destroy your data by reformatting your hard disk. LIGHTNING SPEED To really soup - up , your system, NETROOM in¬ cludes a cloaked Disk Cache which occupies only 5K of DOS memory, but runs faster than any other cache. That’s because our cloaking technol¬ ogy unleashes the 32-bit power of your sys¬ tem. And, NETROOM provides a cloaked text-mode screen accelerator that makes your screen run up to 20 times faster! SOME PRETTY SHARP TOOLS NETROOM is packed with other utilities as well. A cloaked graphical Screen Saver protects your screen from bum-in. A cloaked RAM disk lets you set up the world’s largest RAM drive - up to 256Mb. And, cloaked DPMI support provides compatibil¬ ity with the latest applications. Colorful screen saver features exciting graphics SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Netroom operates with any 386 or 486 system with at least 1 Mb of RAM. Limited support for 286/Neat systems is provided but does not include “Cloaking*. For Windows support Netroom requires Wndows 3.1 or later (WFW is supported).

The Hidden Costs of PC Purchases...and More Consumer Watch routinely re¬ ceives letters from mail-order shoppers who were charged re¬ stocking and/or shipping fees for incorrect or damaged orders that they later returned for a refund. Here’s a sampling of some recent let¬ ters, along with some guidelines to fol¬ low so you can avoid similar charges. Return to Sender I purchased a 486 computer with an SVGA monitor from Vektron Interna¬ tional, a mail-order firm in Grand Prai¬ rie, Texas. The system came with a 14- day money-back guarantee. I paid Unit¬ ed Parcel Service $308.92 (Canadian) in brokerage fees and customs duties for the computer, and within hours I real¬ ized it was defective. I contacted Vektron for assistance, and the company issued an RMA [re¬ turn merchandise authorization] num¬ ber so I could ship the system back (for $62). I received the computer replace¬ ment (paying another $38.58 in broker¬ age fees) and found there was another problem with the machine. I informed Vektron of the problem and asked for another RMA number. When they were late in providing this, I told them I wanted to return the whole system as part of their 14-day money-back offer. I received an RMA number and shipped the whole unit back (for anoth¬ er $81.06). Several weeks later I discov¬ ered that Vektron issued a refund to my credit card and deducted a 20 percent restocking fee and an additional 5 per¬ cent for shipping and handling. My total for the transaction was $1136.92, and I don’t have anything to show for it. Thomas T. Corat, Ottawa, Canada In February 1992 I ordered a $1000 scanner from Peach Computer Sys¬ tems of Norcross, Georgia. When it ar- By Roberta Furger rived, I discovered it was defective. I was ad¬ vised by the manu¬ facturer to return the scanner to the dealer for replacement. I contacted Peach Computer Systems and received an RMA num¬ ber. I asked when the new scanner would be shipped and explained that I had a project to complete that required the scanner. I was told the new scanner would be shipped as soon as the defective one was returned. I later found out the unit had been back ordered, so I de¬ cided to cancel the order and request a refund. I then ordered the scanner from someone else. When I received my credit card state¬ ment, I found that Peach Computer had deducted $227.05 from my refund as a restocking fee. I called Peach Com¬ puter to dispute the fee since the scan¬ ner had been defective from the start, but the company said it always applies restocking fees and shipping and han¬ dling charged on returned items. Keith Wrislet, President, KBW Typesetting and Graphic Presentations, Red Creek, New York Editor’s note: We attempted to con¬ tact both Vektron International and Peach Computer Systems on behalf of Corat and Wrislet. Phone lines for Peach Computer Systems had been dis¬ connected, however, and we were unable to obtain any additional informa¬ tion about the company or its policies. We did, however, receive a response from Vektron International’s sales man¬ ager Eric P. Robb, who said, “I sympa¬ thized with Mr. Corat’s frustrations, but I feel that Vektron has lived up to its obligations with this customer.” Accord¬ PC World Consumer Watch editor Roberta Furger ing to Robb, the chances of something being dam¬ aged in shipment are “much higher” for Cana¬ dian customers because of the increased distances involved. The charges deducted from Mr. Corat’s refund, according to Robb, were for shipping and handling, and a 20 percent restocking fee for returning a system more than 30 days old. “I believe these to be quite standard in the industry. They are not meant to defraud customers.” Certainly Vektron is not alone in levy¬ ing a restocking fee on returned mer¬ chandise or in requiring customers to pay shipping charges. But as both read¬ ers’ letters indicate, you can easily wind up spending a fairly hefty sum of money on such charges without any product to show for it. While restocking fees and shipping charges are reasonable when a customer returns an item simply because it does not meet his or her needs, such charges are not appropriate when the returned item is defective, incomplete, or not what the customer ordered.

Gateway 2000: An Uneven Service Record ateway 2000 has grown more rapidly over the past year than virtually any other mail-order PC company. The stea ly flow of Consumer Watch letters about the company attests to its increasing dominance in the market and to some of the difficulties the company has had in keeping up with its growing customer base. Not all letters are negative, however. In addition to the letters of complaint and requests for assistance from Gateway cus¬ tomers, we also regularly receive letters praising its service. First, the Good News... wish to let you know of the good service I received recently from Gateway 2000. 1 was having a problem with the internal clock in my home PC and called Gateway the next day from work. The technician I spoke with agreed to call me back when I got home in the evening and work with me to identify the problem. He talked me through the procedure, which took a couple of hours. He was very patient throughout, providing assistance without making me feel like an idiot. Kim Kramer, Salt Lake City ...Now the Bad News recently tried to call Gateway 2000, and despite several attempts, I was unable to get through to a sales representative or get one to return my calls. They may be good, but they aren’t that good. Pete Smith, Jacksonville, Florida This is what happens when you call Gate¬ way for support: You dial the 800 num¬ ber, and the phone is answered by a com¬ puter that tells you how important you are. You’re then placed on hold for about 5 min¬ utes, and an operator comes on the line and asks how to direct your call. When he or she transfers you to technical support, your call is placed in the queue, where you remain on hold for 15 minutes before you are re¬ ferred back to the operator, who tells you that all the lines are still busy and offers to take a message and have a technician call you back. Well, you figure, it’s the only way you are going to get through to these peo¬ ple, so you leave all the information. But guess what? They never call back. It took a week before I heard anything from Gate¬ way, and the only reason I did was because I called again. The only way around this mess is to get very mad on the phone and ask to be trans¬ ferred to the CEO’s office. People then start to get things moving for you. You should by no means say “technical support” when the operator asks where to transfer your call. If you do, you’ll have a long wait. Donald Poole, Waldorf, Maryland Editor’s note: Consumer Watch contacted Gateway 2000 about the type of service problems mentioned in Smith’s and Poole’s letters. We received the following response: “Unfortunately, the response time in returning calls has fallen below our nor¬ mal company and customer expectations. We are aware of the problem, however, and ; we are working daily to improve our re¬ sponse times. “Ted Waitt, president of Gateway 2000, recently solicited customer suggestions through our quarterly newsletter, The Gate¬ way Monitor. He will personally be reading all of the responses (though he cannot respond to each concern personally). All of the information received will be compiled into a database for analysis. The result will be a report card for the company that includes the top 10 or 15 problems cus¬ tomers wrote about, along with various sug¬ gested solutions. We will then involve em¬ ployees from all levels in the company to decide how to make improvements. “I would like to assure you that the situa¬ tion will improve in 1993.” Cathy True, Assistant to the President Kudos for Pacific Data Products few years ago I purchased a PostScript emulation cartridge from Pacific Data Products.

Pacific Data sent me an updated cartridge that solved the problem. I have since encountered a Access 1.0 Users report and Microsoft confirms an incompatibility between Access 1.0 , the recently released Windows database, and drivers for the ATI Graphics Ultra video card. The conflict can lead to Gen¬ eral Protection Faults or Improper text alignment on screen. Microsoft and ATI are working on a solution. Until one is available, Microsoft recommends using the 8514 video drivers included with Windows 3.1, rather than ATI’s drivers.

It will make it easy for me to choose products from Pacific Data in the future. David Johnson, Cary, North Carolina Bundled Software Doesn’t Qualify fter reading in the December 1992 issue of PC World that Macromedia would upgrade users of Action version 1.0 to release 2.0 at no additional charge, I called the company to request my upgrade. I was told, however, that since my copy of version 1.0 came bundled with my CD ROM drive, I did not qualify for the free upgrade. Instead, I would have to pay $79. I do not think this policy is fair, since the price I paid for the CD ROM drive covered all hardware and software, including Mac¬ romedia’s Action 1:0. Ronald Morgan, Santa Clarita, California Editor’s note: According to John Colligan, president and CEO of Macromedia, the upgrade offer applied only to customers who purchased the retail version of Action 1.0 (for $495 list) after May 1, 1992. It did not, however, cover users who received Action as part of a bundling arrangement with a hardware manufacturer. Missing in Action recently ordered a system from Gecco Computers of Tempe, Arizona, which was to be paid for within 30 days of receipt. After three weeks, the system finally arrived with the wrong hard drive, wrong case, and a defective monitor. Back went everything to Gecco to be fixed. Over the next few weeks I called several times to check on the status of the system and was repeatedly told “it’s being shipped today.” When I didn’t receive the computer I Have You Ever Seen A Spreadsheet Dance?

Circle 122 on reader service card called again, and Gecco’s phone lines had been disconnected, so I surmised they had gone belly-up. A phone call to the Better Business Bureau confirmed this suspicion. . Here is my dilemma: Gecco finally sent me the system back, and apparently after they had shut down. Why would they? It’s not paid for, and it seems unlikely that the company intends to honor its appealing two-year parts and labor warranty or the promised on-site service (both of which can be obtained only by calling Gecco’s now disconnected phone lines). I can’t reach them by phone, and no one is responding to my faxes. Ron Susser, Los Angeles Editor’s note: It’s likely that Susser’s expe¬ rience was the result of some of the confu¬ sion surrounding Gecco’s last few weeks in business. The Arizona-based mail-order PC manufacturer, which had been in business since 1987, shut down its operation late last year after running into severe cash-flow problems, explains Gecco vice president Eldon Thomas. According to Thomas, the firm suffered a sharp decrease in sales during the first weeks of December (shortly after Compaq and other major players slashed their prices) and, being “cash strapped,” did not have the funds to continue in business. Thomas says that all but 20 to 25 orders were filled and that company principals are working with creditors in an attempt to resolve fi¬ nancial obligations without having to de¬ clare bankruptcy. Unfortunately, owners of Gecco systems are not so fortunate. The company does not have any plans to continue its warranty cov¬ erage, and although the firm did offer on¬ site repairs through Idea Servcom, Thomas says that this service will not be available any longer. Gecco is not the only PC company to stumble or fall in battle, however. For example, Cumulus, a PC mail-order firm based in Ohio, was placed in receivership at the end of last year, and Everex, a high-per¬ formance PC manufacturer in Fremont, California, recently, filed Chapter 11. Given the turbulent times and the likeli¬ hood of additional shakeout in the next few months, we offer a reprise of our Consumer Watch tips for PC buyers. Although some of the suggestions require effort on your part, the time that you spend researching a pur¬ chase may mean the difference between getting the product you order and being left empty-handed. • Know who you’re buying from. Look for companies with a proven track record that have demonstrated some longevity in the market. Call the company’s local Better Business Bureau to see if complaints have been filed against it. Check system reviews for evaluations of both performance and ser¬ vice and support. • Don’t pay cash. Use a credit card or pay COD. You’ll have little or no recourse if you pay by check, but stand a good chance of getting your money back if you charge the purchase and never receive your order. • Evaluate the companies’ return and ser¬ vice policies. Buy only from those firms that have 30-day money-back guarantees and that offer comprehensive service and sup¬ port, such as 24-hour technical support and on-site repair service. • Document everything. Request written confirmation about pricing, warranty cover¬ age, and return policy before you place your order. Keep a record of all your phone con¬ versations, including the name and title of the salesperson who takes your order. • Verify availability and ship dates. Compa¬ nies that can’t ship an order by the prom¬ ised date are required to notify you of the delay. If you don’t receive an order on time and haven’t heard from the company, con¬ tact your credit card company and let them know of the delay. If your credit card has already been debited, cancel the order and notify your credit card company. Research assistance was provided by PC World assistant editors Michael Desmond and Christina Wood.

Aymond oversees the computing needs of some 200 in-house and field staff who monitor the state’s financial heartbeat. His experience includes 12 years working with IBM mainframes and PCs. Because Aymond is a government auditor, he did not accept payment for this article. — Ed. A Thorn in My Side Scheduling software is supposed to make the common task of setting up meetings more efficient, but it doesn’t always work that way. In my office, we took a few detours before finding the right package and establishing the nec¬ essary rules to make group scheduling work for us. Here’s how it happened: Two years ago, when I became director of informa¬ tion systems, our office was making the transition from a Wang minicomputer with terminals to a collection of PCs connected to a Novell network. Since we were losing the Wang Office schedul¬ ing system, which was very competent, my predecessor chose a new program with group scheduling capabilities: Polaris’s PackRat. But we had big problems right from the start: PackRat was slow, too com¬ plex for most of the staff, and we couldn’t put more than 70 users on it. This last restriction was a particular problem because we have 90 users in our home office in Baton Rouge, work¬ ing off of three servers, and a wide area network that connects two field offices. We also have almost 100 field employ¬ ees who need to be tracked. Polaris released a PackRat upgrade that promised to be more to our liking, but the company wanted to charge $99 per workstation, and we felt we shouldn’t have to pay more for what didn’t work correctly to begin with. That’s when I decided to make a switch. I’m skeptical when it comes to software. I’ve seen too many demos where the program runs perfectly only because it’s on a stand-alone 486. Try it on your network, and it runs like a dog. So I’ve established a few policies I follow before making a big purchase. If the soft¬ ware costs $150 or less, I buy a single copy and beat up on it for a month. If it costs more than $150, I ask the vendor to give me a free one-month trial. If the company won’t, I don’t bother with the product. In eval¬ uating Campbell Services’ OnTime for Networks, I called several companies that had used it to make sure they were satisfied, and when Campbell offered a free evaluation copy for a ten-user net¬ work version, I decided to try it. I was looking for a package that would be easy to learn and would schedule our diverse users efficiently. Along with the capability to check peo¬ ple’s schedules and report back auto¬ matically, our ideal software choice would update the availability of a room or equipment and would be accessible to remote users. Access on the Road We found that OnTime met our require¬ ments, although for employees who work outside the office, the scheduling could be better. People in our two branch offices can update their sched¬ ules via the wide area network and be scheduled for meetings as though they worked in the Baton Rouge office. For our field employees, we have set up toll-free telephone lines that allow them to use N orton-Lambert’s Close-up, a remote access package, to update their OnTime calendars. But updating data that way is proving to be painfully slow. We are waiting for a new “rec¬ onciliation” feature that will allow remote OnTime users to keep current copies of their cal¬ endars while they travel, and then com¬ plete two-way updates when they dial into the network. It would also be advantageous if the package worked seamlessly with cc:Mail, our E-mail sys¬ tem. That way people could RSVP for a meeting via E-mail and their calendars would then be updated automatically. We quickly discovered that if you want scheduling to work, you have to require employees to keep their cal¬ endars up-to-date. It’s also critical to decide which employee gets clearance to update the schedule for a room or equipment. For example, anyone can sign up to use our page scanner when it’s free, but with conference rooms, accidental conflicts would be unaccept- Roth Aymond, director of information systems for the Louisiana Legislative Auditor APRIL 1993 • PC WORLD 35 REAL PROBLEMS REAL SOLUTIO AnthroCarf A ANThRO Call for a free catalog: 800-325-3841 6:30 AM - 5:00 PM, PST, M-F AnthroCorp. • 3221 NW Yeon St., Portland, OR 9721 0 • (503)241-7113 • FAX: (503) 241-1619 AnthroCart ANThRO Call for a free catalog: 800-325-3841 6:30 AM - 5:00 PM, PST AnthroCo. • 3221 NW Yeon St., Portland, OR 97210 • (503)241-7113 • FAX: (503) 241-1 61 9 able. We avoid that by putting one person in charge of making changes to the confer¬ ence room calendar, The downside is that it takes a while for everyone on the network to put away their Day-Timers and get used to scheduling on their PCs. Still, it’s much better than han¬ dling scheduling the old-fashioned way. We’ve paid about $10,000 to license 200 users, but the convenience in managing our roving employees is worth it. .

But if you used his macro, then reduced the width of your column and used if again, the macro didn’t work. This one will: in an unused part of your worksheet type {let @CELLP0INTER (\"address\"), @TRIM(@CELLP0INTER (\"confenfs\"))}, then select /Range • Name • Create to name the cell \\R. In the cell below it, type {edit}{home} (del); below that, type '@REPEAT (\" \",@CELLPOINTER(\"w/dfft\")@LENGTH (@CELLP0INTER (\"confeflf$\")))&\" (don’t for¬ get the starting apostrophe); and below that, type (end)n(calc}~. From then on, pressing <Alt>-R when in a label cell will insert enough spaces to make it appear right-aligned, even if it already has more spaces than it needs.
