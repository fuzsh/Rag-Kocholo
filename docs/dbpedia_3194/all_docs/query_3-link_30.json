If they are DV-AVI format I would definitely edit them in that format, as DV-AVI already uses a PC friendly low compression intra frame codec. Export to MP4.\n\nMXV is designed by Magix as an edit friendly intermediate codec with minimal loss when converting back to the original or another export codec but there may not be much gain over sticking with the DV-AVI if your PC is struggling. If you were considering using it it would be better to create Proxies instead, which incidently use MXV by default for the edit for smoother handling, and the original DV-AVI would only be converted to your chosen format at the export stage.\n\nMXV is useful if you have a section of clips with heavy effects that cause the PC to stutter whereby you export the section (range) to MXV and then replace the section in the timeline with the exported clip. I think @browj2 uses them like this, quite a lot.\n\nPeter\n\n@yvon-robert\n\n@Scenestealer\n\n@CubeAce\n\nHi\n\nIt's not actually a file compatibility problem, just a question of the right intermediate format to employ to get from AVI to MP4 via MEP. And my Pinnacle days are over...(!) I uploaded the tapes some years back but didn't get around to doing something about them until recently.\n\nMy files are indeed DV-AVI. The experiment I tried involved converting DV-AVI clips to raw AVI - taking four times as much disc space as the original file! Thanks for the tip, Peter - I'll be editing in DV-AVI in future!\n\nMy computer - a venerable Sandy Bridge i5 - doesn't seem to use maximum CPU capacity or memory (8GB) when rendering, but then I've only been rendering a couple of tracks with effects (titles, transitions, noise removal, background music). I'm not clear as to why it was stuttering while editing, but given the size of the files on the timeline I suspect the limitations of the D: hard drive.\n\nAnother experiment I played around with today wasn't exactly scientific, but did give me a couple of insights into the intermediate file dilemma. I converted a couple of short DV-AVI clips to, variously, MXV, AVI and MP4 formats, and exported them as separate movies in those formats. I then imported each movie and re-exported each as an MP4 file to see if I could detect a difference on the TV screen at 720 x 576, 25fps (4K was a bit after my time...). I could have been imagining it - and you can shoot me down if you disagree with this - but I think the MP4 files derived from intermediate AVI and DV-AVI movies appeared marginally sharper than those from the MP4 and MXV intermediate movies.\n\nAlso - and I can't explain this but perhaps everyone else on this forum can - I was surprised to find that the final MP4 files were all the same size, give or take a couple of percent, irrespective of the intermediate movie format... There must be a perfectly simple explanation for this that eludes me for the moment!\n\nThanks and regards\n\nRichard\n\n@Richard-Curtis\n\nHi\n\n. . . . just a question of the right intermediate format to employ to get from AVI to MP4 via MEP. . . . .\n\nWhy is it a question of using an Intermediate format at all?\n\nI agree with @CubeAce use the DV-AVI files as is.\n\nUnless MEP cannot import the AVi files, using an intermediate format is not going to help because:\n\nit involves conversion (recoding) = time lost\n\nthere will be no improvement in the quality over the existing source files\n\nis not going to make editing easier\n\nthe export to mp4 time will show no significant difference as this is when the recoding occurs.\n\nThe only likely issue you may come across is no audio when imported into MEP, if this is the case the AVI files contain dual audio streams (Type 2 DV-AVI) which need converting to single audio stream (Type 1 DV-AVI) - this can be done with DVDate and is a lot quicker than recoding to an intermediate format and does not involve recoding the video.\n\nJohn EB\n\n@johnebaker\n\nHi John\n\nThank you for your response My original question arose from two issues I had somewhat belatedly come across (I had previously been importing and editing MP4 files for the past few months so the AVI dilemma hadn't arisen until now). First, I hadn't appreciated the distinction between AVI and DV-AVI, and couldn't understand why I was getting these huge files when working with AVI clips that resulted in slowing the program down when I tacked a few of them together. Secondly, it had occurred to me that since my final export would likely be to MP4 it might be a good defensive idea to convert clips from AVI/DV-AVI to MP4 BEFORE assembling them for final export, editing being faster in MP4. That way, only one conversion involved as well. @CubeAce and @Scenestealer put me on the right track, though, as confirmed by yourself - I'm only too happy to edit in the original format which I now know is the much more friendly and compact DV-AVI.\n\nMy observation regarding the similarity of the final MP4 files referred to their size, not necessarily the coding time, although from your comment the two properties would appear to be related. Intuitively I had expected it would take longer for the program to trawl through a 13GB AVI file than e.g. a 2GB MP4 file of the same clip, but I can now see that both arrive at similarly sized MP4 files in the end as determined by the required resolution, frame rate etc. - so that's why (as you point out) they take around the same time to recode. Is that correct?\n\nFinally, I don't have a problem importing the audio stream - thankfully...\n\nThanks again for your help...\n\nRichard\n\n@Richard-Curtis\n\nHi,\n\nWhen I edit my DV AVI files, I just use the imported source. This has always worked fine for me...except for being reminded that I'm so far behind in making proper videos out of all of these that I'll never catch up.\n\nI use the Magix mxv format usually only when there are special problems. In particular, if I need to use Neat Video (NV) to clean up noise and possibly stabilization, I do rough cuts, apply NV and maybe stabilization, export to mxv, and use that for further editing. NV is extremely heavy and slows down editing to a crawl. Exports of a complete video to MP4 or BR of an hour can take a day or two, and then fail to render properly. I also use mxv on exports from Vasco da Gamma sometimes as the wmv file seems to drag down editing.\n\nI have also exported movies to mxv that are to be put on a multi-movie BR and then import them into a final project as separate movies. Burning goes a lot smoother.\n\nThat's my experience with mxv files.\n\nJohn CB\n\n@Richard-Curtis\n\nHi\n\nI hadn't appreciated the distinction between AVI and DV-AVI, and couldn't understand why I was getting these huge files when working with AVI clips that resulted in slowing the program down when I tacked a few of them together.\n\nJust to clarify - AVI is just a container format and as such can contain compressed codecs as well as the uncompressed AVI's which Magix AVI export defaults to. Actually uncompressed should be the easiest for the PC to edit and process because a lot of the load when using compressed codecs is created by the fact that each frame needs to be uncompressed by the codec prior to effects being applied, then re-compressed for realtime preview or writing to the export file. The problem is though is that the data rate is huge about 1200Mbps or 150MB/s which can cause problems with your storage drives, as I think you alluded to, especially if you have more than one stream on your timeline.\n\nI think the MP4 files derived from intermediate AVI and DV-AVI movies appeared marginally sharper than those from the MP4 and MXV intermediate movies.\n\nWell that would make sense, although probably difficult to discern at SD resolution, because the MXV and MP4 would have gone through an extra step of transcoding - IOW the DV-AVI didn't need converting prior to loading to the timeline and the uncompressed AVI was simply in the state where it required no coding other that to the export format.\n\nWhich leads on to your subsequent comment:- My observation regarding the similarity of the final MP4 files referred to their size, not necessarily the coding time, although from your comment the two properties would appear to be related. Intuitively I had expected it would take longer for the program to trawl through a 13GB AVI file than e.g. a 2GB MP4 file of the same clip.. So encoding time could be shorter using the uncompressed intermediate and probably also the MXV which is relatively (and simply) uncompressed also.\n\n.....editing being faster in MP4.\n\nNot so as you deduced. It is probably the worst next to H.265 .MP4 because of the complex compression algorithm.\n\n@browj2\n\nExports of a complete video to MP4 or BR of an hour can take a day or two, and then fail to render properly.\n\nYou deserve a medal (or a badge at least) for what you accomplish......on a Pentium 860 at 2.8Ghz and no iGPU!! You wouldn't consider a PC upgrade anytime soon? You wouldn't know yourself!\n\nCheers\n\nPeter\n\nIntuitively I had expected it would take longer for the program to trawl through a 13GB AVI file than e.g. a 2GB MP4 file of the same clip,\n\n@Richard-Curtis To illustrate the point that size isn't related to difficulty in editing, I'm currently capturing some VHS tapes. The most recent file, which I captured with Virtual Dub into incompressed AVI format, is 89gb for a 3 hour clip, almost 500mb a minute! But MEP tears through it like there is no tomorrow. It loves it. It's even better than DV-AVI to edit. But give me a small, highly compressed MOV or MP4 from a phone and MEP is noticeably slower.\n\n@browj2, I'm curious re your use of MXV. I have always only ever used it for capturing video. Are you saying you reencode parts of your originals into MXV for processing in NV (I don't know anything about NV, BTW)?\n\nAll my forum comments are based on or refer to my System 1.\n\nMy struggle is over! I built my (now) system 2 in 2011 when DV was king and MPEG 2 was just coming onto the scene and I needed a more powerful system to cope. Since then we've advanced to MP4 and to bigger and bigger resolutions. I was really suffering, not so much in editing (with proxies) but in encoding, which just took ages. A video, with Neat Video noise reduction applied, would encode at 12% of film speed. My new system 1 does the same job at 160% of film speed. Marvellous. I'm keeping my old system as a capture station for analogue video tapes and DV.\n\nSystem 1\n\nWindows 11 v23H2 severely modified by Openshell and ExplorerPatcher\n\nPower supply: 850W Cooler Master (should have got modular)\n\nCPU: Intel i7 13700K running at 3400mhz, cooled by a Kraken 2x140mm All In One liquid cooler.\n\nRAM: 64gb (2x32gb sticks) G.Skill \"Ripjaws\" DDR4 3200Mhz\n\nGPU 1: iGPU UHD 770\n\nGPU 2: NVidia RTX 3060Ti Windforce 8gb\n\nC drive: NVME 500gb\n\nVarious other SSD and HDDs.\n\nMonitor: 27\"/68cm Samsung, 2560 x 1440, 43 pixels/cm.\n\nMEP 2021 version 20.0.1.80\n\nMovie Studio 2023 version 22.0.3.172\n\nMagix Video Easy version 7.0.1.145\n\nSystem 2\n\n(Still in use for TV and videotape capture)\n\nWindows 10 v22H2\n\nCPU: i5-750 at 2670mhz with 12gb RAM\n\nOnboard IEEE1394 (Firewire) port\n\nGPU: ATI Radeon HD 4770 (512mb) which is ignored by MEP\n\nHard drives: C Drive 256gb SSD, various other HDDs.\n\nMonitor: Dell 22\"/56cm, 1680x1050, 35 pixels/cm\n\nMEP 2021 version 20.0.1.80\n\nMovie Studio 2023 version 22.0.3.172\n\nVPX 12\n\n@Scenestealer\n\nHi Peter,\n\nThe time to export was in the context of a heavy use of Neat Video. In that particular, NV was applied to almost all clips in the 1 hour+ multi-movie project. Remember that NV can drag down rendering to less than 4 fps, in my case about 1.\n\nI bought my computer at the end of 2010 and started doing full HD in mid 2011. People were envious of my wonderful computer at the time. I'm still doing full HD projects. I changed the C drive for an SSD and increased RAM to 16Gb, making it even more powerful. Magix has stated that it has increased rendering speed and made playback smoother from one version to the next. Thus, my old computer should really fly. So, why is it slower than it was back in 2011 using the same material, doing the same things? Or is it my imagination?\n\n@AAProds\n\nI apply Neat Video to some clips, mainly VHS, digitized 8mm and Super8mm film, and full HD taken in low-light conditions. See this site for NV's gift to the video editing world. It does an amazing job, particularly on the digitized film by cleaning up the video noise and removing dust and some other imperfections. However, this requires heavy computation, having to analyze and correct each frame, and then render it.\n\n8mm and Super8 is digitized to 1080 at 20fps. I change it 16 or 18 fps, respectively, and then apply Neat Video and stabilization, where necessary. Then, I export to mxv and use the result for further editing - colour correction, effects, transitions, titles, music, narration, etc. Doing everything on the original footage would be extremely arduous. Colour correction would have to be done before applying NV, as applying it afterwards has no effect. - NV does not like that. There is no way to get smooth playback without preview rendering once NV has been applied, and doing this would take a long, long time. I do pretty much the same with VHS footage.\n\nJohn CB\n\nAll my forum comments are based on or refer to my System 1.\n\nMy struggle is over!

So, why is it slower than it was back in 2011 using the same material, doing the same things?\n\nBecause Magix have changed internal processes to take advantage of developments in hardware and processing which are not present in your older system.\n\nThey are relying a lot on the Integrated Intel GPU for a lot of accelerations of processes and effects - I noticed just yesterday that just updating the thumbnails as you scroll the timeline creates quite a bit of activity / load on the Intel GPU and without one this would fall back to the processor.\n\nYour processor does not have AVX extensions which are being exploited in the more recent i7 series for effects processing in VPX and MEP. To make things worse the workload created by VPX has been further increased in recent versions by colour processing becoming 16bit instead of 8bit.\n\nPeter\n\n@Scenestealer\n\nHi Peter.\n\nThis is why I'm not overly fond of programs like Adobe Photoshop any more. With that type of monthly payment you have to keep your machine up to spec as the program is constantly updated. I prefer to update only if I acquire new gear and the older programs don't interface any more with the newer gear. Even here I can see a time not too distant when my current system won't cope. Maybe six years if I'm lucky. The new AMD processors are going to force Intel into more changes to keep market share with gamers who outnumber people like us by a large margin. That may force companies like Magix to change how their software works on new hardware. It never ends and the upgrade cycles just get faster. There is only so much upgrading one can do unless you do it for a living.\n\nRay.\n\n@Scenestealer\n\nJust a quick retort. With new, more modern equipment, I would expect VPX/MEP to run more smoothly without any help from Magix' developers. Secondly, I expect improvements in VPX/MEP to run at least the same on existing, i.e. older equipment. Thirdly, I do not expect an export of exactly the same project to take longer with newer versions; I can accept the same, but not slower, especially when Magix says that it should be faster.\n\nThat said, the final days of VPX10 were not good; pressing play on just my simple video clips, always the same ones for years, sputtered. Playback of these did not sputter with older versions but got progressively worse with each new, improved version. I could not even get a simple cross-fade after preview rendering to play back smooothly with VPX10. Maybe my memory is going, but then VPX11 came along, and all was suddenly smooth once again. Preview rendering now worked again.\n\nI'll have to find some work before I can afford a new computer, or the old one will have to die (the computer, I mean). I'll tell Bernadette to get a real job; no one is willing to pay her for chasing squirrels. Her videos have not brought in any royalties. In the meantime, I'll just keep on going with what I have.\n\nMagix! Please fix some bugs.\n\nJohn CB\n\n@browj2\n\nHi John\n\n. . . . With new, more modern equipment, I would expect VPX/MEP to run more smoothly without any help from Magix' developers . . . .\n\nThe opposite side of the coin is the need to cater for 2.7K, 4K UHD, 4K and 8K video resolutions, higher frame rates and HEVC.\n\nThe data increase in the higher resolution formats is not linear - 4K UHD has 4 x as many pixels as Full HD with all the knock on effects of moving that data, rendering it to visible image and playing this back in real time which are not going to lead to smooth playback without the intervention of the developers.\n\n. . . . Maybe my memory is going, but then VPX11 came along, and all was suddenly smooth once again . . . .\n\nI can replicate that - your memory is definitely not going - VPX 11 really does have a big difference in playback smoothness, it works like a charm on my laptop with a 4th gen processor and HD4600 iGPU.\n\n. . . . Magix! Please fix some bugs. . . .\n\nYes please.\n\nJohn EB\n\n@browj2\n\nHi John\n\nWith new, more modern equipment, I would expect VPX/MEP to run more smoothly without any help from Magix' developers.\n\nI would too, and I think MEP/VPX do. Do you have any evidence that new or old versions of MEP/VPX only run the same or worse on more modern equipment?\n\nSecondly, I expect improvements in VPX/MEP to run at least the same on existing, i.e. older equipment.\n\nWould be nice but by making improvements Magix need to use new processes that might make the existing \"pipeline\" redundant or less efficient, or it might limit how much they are able to exploit the new hardware / technology to make improvements. We cannot keep making things backwards compatible without eventually sacrificing development possibilities.\n\nThirdly, I do not expect an export of exactly the same project to take longer with newer versions; I can accept the same, but not slower, especially when Magix says that it should be faster.\n\nI do not have any evidence to say export is slower with newer versions on the latest hardware but it is conceivable that it might be slightly in some circumstances for the reasons given in my last comment, and the fact that it is doing more during, like higher bit depth colour processing. Also Magix have not claimed VPX exports are any faster in recent years except with export of HEVC material on machines with Nvidia GTX1060 or or higher graphics cards where the New Infusion Engine in conjunction with the NVENC Hardware chip and encoder make a significant difference .\n\nSure, VPX10 had a raft of problems and I agree with you that a lot more bug fixes and a few less new features would be optimum. But as with most consumer products I think it would be unrealistic for manufacturers to need to make one model perfectly before we could move on to next with better features, because often the flaws are circumvented in the redesign.\n\nPeter\n\n@Scenestealer\n\n@browj2\n\nThe other day I was intrigued and somewhat amused to notice from a couple of posts that quite a few of us on this forum are engineers, which definitely says a lot for MEP! So if I may make a general comment on the topic of programs I would agree with @browj2 that maintaining performance across program updates and fixing bugs in rapid order is not expecting too much of programmers. In the real world we'd expect and demand it, and just because this is (for most of us!) relaxing entertainment is no reason for the program's developers to take things easy. Also, a structured program should facilitate isolated bug-fixes without any need to recode the whole thing. If a program update involves a complete change of technology that's a different matter and would excuse a lack of backward compatibility or an impaired performance, but we're not talking about that here. Before I incite another rant from someone I should make it clear that this is a GENERAL comment that applies across the board. I have four editing programs on my PC (waste of money, I know), and for my admittedly limited purposes MEP is the best of them - bugs and all."
