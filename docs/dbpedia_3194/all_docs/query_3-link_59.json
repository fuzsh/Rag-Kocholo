The Liquid Edition is also compatible with the Pinnacle Studio.\n\nThe sixth version of Liquid Edition, software for advanced video editing, takes advantage of all the capacity of current personal computers and cards video. Pinnacle software allows you to perform effects with real-time transmission quality, composition, titration, audio, DVD creation and more.\n\nPinnacle Liquid Edition 6 gives editors new tools that allow them to edit multiple high-definition (HD) content channels with effects on real time without the need to own expensive hardware, a powerful audio engine and software compatibility Pinnacle Studio.\n\nEnhanced capabilities for editing formats such as HDV, MPEG-2, DVC Pro and DV Pinnacle Liquid Edition allows you to accept almost any job that the customers require.\n\nLiquid SmartRT technology harnesses the power of the central processing unit of the computer (CPU) and image processing unit (GPU) to perform thousands of 2D and 3D effects independently of the streaming resolution, in real time, of SD and HD video.\n\nPinnacle also offers support for PCI-Express bus technology, which removes obstacles and delivers up to 30 times more bandwidth between the processor visual and CPU, than PCI-based solutions. This increase in bandwidth results in more powerful effects in real time, for all formats, including HD, without need to resort to additional expensive hardware.\n\nThe plug and play FireWire, from Pinnacle Liquid Edition, allows editors to work with HDV on site, with a laptop.\n\nThis new version of Pinnacle Liquid Edition makes it easy for users to combine multiple formats and standards all on the same timeline through the Liquid SmartEDIT. Liquid SmartEDIT provides support for a wide range of variety of codecs including DV25, MPEG-2 I-frame and IBP, and without compress. This means that users can edit HDV as well such as the MPEG-2 IBP format used for DVDs. This minimizes possibilities of quality loss in the conversion process.\n\nThe updated and flexible Post-production tools for audio improve completion. It also adds a new F.A. Porsche analog breakout box and digital, with S-Video I/O, stereo in, surround out, S/PDIF I/O and \"plug and play USB-2."
