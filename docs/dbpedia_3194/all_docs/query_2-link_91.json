        "text": "The Korn Ferry Tour continues in Omaha, Nebraska, with the Pinnacle Bank Championship presented by Woodhouse, contested at The Club at Indian Creek. This is the 21st event of the Tour’s 26-event season. As the Korn Ferry Tour Playoffs loom, check out important storylines to follow this week.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Korn Ferry Tour Championship, the top 30 players on the Korn Ferry Tour Points List earn PGA TOUR cards for the 2025 season. Entering this week’s event in Omaha, the top seven players on the points list have already clinched #TOURBound status: Steven Fisk, Tim Widing , Matt McCarty, Max McGreevy, Harry Higgs, Taylor Dickson and Cristobal Del Solar. Twenty other players in the field have the potential to cross the treshold with their finish this week, include Quade Cummins (would earn TOUR status with a two-way T5 / Five-way T4 or better) and Ryan Gerard (would earn status with a two-way T4 or better).\n\nScott Gutschewski (PGA TOUR member and three-time Korn Ferry Tour winner) , Luke Gutschewski (Iowa State golfer playing on a sponsor exemption) and Trevor Gutschewski (2024 U.S. Junior Amateur champion and rising High School senior playing on a sponsor exemption) are all in the field for the Pinnacle Bank Championship. The three family members are playing in the same group for Rounds 1 and 2. Additionally, brothers Carson Schaake (open qualifier; making his third KFT start this week) and Alex Schaake (making fourth KFT state and playing on a sponsor exemption) are both in the field. This is the second time both Schaake brothers have played in this event during the same season."
