        "text": "In all incarnations of LE, from FSDV3 right through to 6.1 you can have as many video or audio tracks as you like! Dependant of the spec of your machine.\n\nRegarding a preview full screen, dependant on wether you have the pro version or standard, you can feed a firewire feed from the BOB or PC as the case may be into a VTR or Camera that accepts firewire in & take the appropriate A/V feed out to your preview monitor.\n\nThis monitor will not allow realtime FX`s unless you have the BOB & set output from LE via BOB to analogue.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nPage 37 of the vaio manual has the following info\n\nConnecting an external display\n\nYou can connect multiple displays to your desktop, each using a different port on the back of your computer:\n\n❑ an LCD screen using the DVI connector,\n\n❑ a CRT or LCD screen using the VGA connector,\n\n❑ a TV using the TV-Out connector.\n\nSee also Setting up the monitor (page 23) and Using two screens while watching a DVD film\n\n(page 27).\n\nPlease make note of the following viewing possibilities:\n\n❑ If you have a VGA and a DVI display connected at the same time, you can switch from one display to the\n\nother (the default is VGA), but you cannot display the image on both at the same time.\n\n❑ If you have a VGA and a TV connected, the image is shown on both screens by default.\n\n❑ If you have a DVI and a TV connected, the image is shown on both screens by default.\n\n❑ If you have a VGA, a DVI and a TV connected, the image will be shown either on both the VGA and the\n\nTV, or both the DVI and the TV.\n\nTo change your display from VGA to DVI or vice versa, proceed as follows:\n\n1 Connect the display(s), as described in Setting up the monitor (page 23) or in the instructions\n\ndelivered with the display, if applicable.\n\n2 Go to Control Panel.\n\n3 Click Appearance and Themes then Display.\n\nThe Display Properties dialog box appears.\n\n4 Click the Settings tab.\n\n5 Click Advanced.\n\nThe ...NVIDIA GeForce FX... dialog box appears.\n\n6 Click nView Display Mode on the left.\n\n7 Select the Device Settings button.\n\n8 Click Select Output Device... and select the desired display.\n\n9 Click OK.\n\nIf you reboot after changing the settings as above, the default setting returns and the image is shown on\n\nthe VGA screen again. If you want the image to be shown on both the DVI and the TV after rebooting, please\n\ndisconnect the VGA.\n\nSimilarly, if you have all three displays connected and want the computer to select DVI and TV when you\n\nstart your computer, simply make your settings again.\n\nDave,\n\nLE6.1 allows full screen play back on a single monitor. I converted from Studio to LE6 PRO last Novemeber and I have to say I've never looked back. There really is no comparision, in general the stability and features are very good. I too was concerned above the steep learning curve but have found it very intuative and user friendly. I would recommend getting a tutorial DVD from DVC or the like to help with the specifics.\n\nI believe in Studio terms in v8 (don't know about v9) you can't hook up a second monitor\n\nneil"
