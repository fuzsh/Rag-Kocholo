        "text": "Studio has been around a long time. I first encountered it when I bought an analogue capture card called a DC10+, which came bundled with version 1.01. I was next aware of a free upgrade to version 7, which had some very useful addtional features including, ISTR, the ablity to perform split A/V edits.\n\nBy version 9, the program was quite well featured for the time. I was using it to make VHS showreels. Pinnacle by now also have a “professional” program called Liquid (acquired from FAST systems), more expensive but still capable of running onaffordable hardware. Studio 10 was a major rewrite; the buzz was that it used the “engine” from Liquid. By now DVD authoring was a major feature. For a numner of years after, speculation about a new combimed version of the two programs was rife, with the working title Next Gen.\n\nAvid bought out Pinnacle and proceeded to develop NGStudio, releasing it alongside Pinnacle Studio 15 as Avid Studio. This was a very different program to the “classic” Studio, with true multi-track features, a very sophisticated Library system, aimed to fit below Avid media Composer. Liquid was discontinued. The next upheaval came when Avid decided to get out of prosumer and consumer video entirely and sell the pinnacle range to Corel. Now there was no space for the classic Studio alongside Corel’s other product Video Studio (CVS). Avid Studio was given a light rewrite and renamed Pinnacle Studio 16.\n\nDevelopment has continued on what was NGStudio, with a number of fetures being shared with CVS – notably the Multi-cam editing package. Corel positions PS above CVS price-wise, but both programs have loyal user bases.\n\nAt the time of writing Studio 23 is the latest release, available in the Basic, Plus and Ultimate versions. over the last few years a new version has been announced in the late summer, so it is well established by the “Holiday Season” sales boom."
