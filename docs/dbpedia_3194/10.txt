Pinnacle Studio is a video editing program originally developed by Pinnacle Systems as the consumer-level counterpart to Pinnacle’s former professional-level software, Liquid Edition. It was acquired by Avid and later by Corel in July 2012. Pinnacle Studio allows users to author video content in Video CD, DVD-Video, AVCHD or Blu-ray format, add complementary menus and burn them to disc.

Used this a couple of years ago, and while very robust with features, it was clunky and not very user friendly. If you are an advanced user, you might get more use out of it, if you are a novice, this is not for you.

I am probably as advanced as a user can get with Studio products. I have reviewed their software and my testimony is on their website. Always a pleasure using Studio and I own every version. Pinnacle Studio is now an Avid product and has mutated to the Avid style, so it may not be as simple as some folks remember.

Software works ok but Tech support and customer service cause more problems than they solve… I ended up finding and fixing the problems myself.

Only loads plug-in’s purchased from Pinnacle. Won’t load great aftermarket plug-in’s like SoundSoap2.

Not being satisfied with the software isn’t a reason for a refund when purchased from Pinnacle.
