        "text": "IFC supports three phases of recruitment: Informal, Formal, and Semi-Formal. Informal recruitment takes place over the summer where potential new members can join a chapter prior to school. Individual chapters decide to what extent they recruit during the summer and what events they have during this period.\n\nFormal recruitment begins between Welcome Week and the first week of classes. This period begins with a recruitment fair, where potential new members have the opportunity to meet with chapter representatives. The following two days involve house tours where potential new members get to learn more about each chapter as they tour chapter facilities. Formal recruitment also includes one day of IFC orientation, where incoming potential new members are educated on Greek life at the University of Minnesota and the rush process as a whole. After this, the next three days include semi-formal events hosted either at a chapter house or around campus. Information on these semi-formal events can be found on the chapter's social media page.\n\n2024 Interest Form"
