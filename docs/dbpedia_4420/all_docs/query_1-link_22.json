        "text": "About Us\n\nLocally founded in December of 2018, our chapter is the newest fraternity on Miami’s campus. Our founders established our chapter with the vision and belief that Greek Life could be something more, something that truly enriched lives, embraced brotherhood, and cultivated an environment in which all members were valued. We pride ourselves in our high standards of membership, our commitment to our chapter’s core values, and our role in the betterment of all Greek life at Miami. Although we are a rapidly growing chapter, we never sacrifice quality for quantity, thus ensuring that each member we add is truly a Man of Wood and Deed who will help uphold our values and improve this brotherhood. Our relatively small size gives ample opportunity for leadership and contribution regardless of age and allows every brother to know each other extremely well, creating true brotherhood with strong, life-long bonds that will last long after college has ended. Our values are the cornerstone of our chapter and although we house a diverse range of individuals, we are united by our belief in integrity, initiative, loyalty, accountability, and respect, the five values that we as a chapter unanimously agreed to represent and uphold. Every semester we grow and improve and last semester we acquired a newly renovated house, hosted many social events, improved our GPA to be in the top three fraternity GPAs on campus, and ran our first major charity event.\n\nAbout Us\n\nAlpha Epsilon Pi - Alpha Tau is the Miami University Chapter of the AEPi Fraternity. AEPi is a historically Jewish fraternity and we hold those values very close, though we have brothers of many different backgrounds.

Some of the activities that we partake in include social events, philanthropic and charity ventures, food nights, organized sports, road trips, and many other activities at the discretion of the brotherhood. We are a great group of guys who truly embody the brotherhood that this fraternity provides.\n\nAbout Us\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc., the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African American men, was founded at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York by seven college aged men who recognized the need for a strong bond of brotherhood among African descendants in this country.

During a time of segregation that involved great racial and social discrimination these dedicated individuals made history.
