        "text": "I don't agree with that. All of the people that I have known who were in Fraternities were very social people. It's true that you can sometimes stereotype people by what fraternity they are in, but that is the same as saying that you can judge what kind of person you are by looking at your friends.\n\nBen\n\nNeoCortex, I agree completely with what you said.\n\njfk: You really shouldn't knock something until you try it. Joining a fraternity was one of the best decisions I made in college. It taught me how to be a leader, how to be social, how to balance time, and many other things. I found my identity through my experience with a fraternity. The experiences I had to go through taught me a lot about who I am because there were so many opportunities to participate in so many different things that you can't help but learn about yourself.\n\nDelta Sigma Pi (Kappa chapter) and Phi Theta Kappa. One's a professional fraternity and the other is an academic...so you guys might not think they count. Although not the \"typical\" fraternity/sorority experience, they're good resume builders. I didn't have much of a desire to do the whole sorority thing during college, but I don't agree with JFK about those who do not having an identity of their own. I think that's a pretty ignorant statement."
