        "text": "A “recognized” fraternity or sorority is one that is in good standing with Rutgers. All recognized fraternities and sororities have worked hard to earn their official status. These organizations have the privilege of using college facilities and equipment, tabling, posting, holding meetings and/or programs on campus, inducting new members that will be recognized by the university, and participating in campus events such as the Involvement Fair, Bed Races, and Dance Marathon.\n\nCopyright © 2024, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, an equal access / equal opportunity, affirmative action institution.
