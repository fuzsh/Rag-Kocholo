        "text": "Purpose: Order of Omega is known as the Greek Honor Society. Each year, the organization selects members from the Greek community to become members of Order of Omega. Members must be juniors and seniors and exhibit leadership within their chapter and community, display a passion for service and be at or above the all-Greek GPA or a 3.00. Additionally, Order of Omega can only take 5% of the total membership of the Greek community, meaning that the members are truly the best of the best.\n\nChapter: Omega Rho (ΩΡ)\n\nPresident: Claire Whitaker\n\nEmail: msu.ooo@murraystate.edu\n\nSocial Media: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram"
