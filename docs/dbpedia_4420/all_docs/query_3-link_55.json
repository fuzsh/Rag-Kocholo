The main objective of NPHC is to enhance the college experience, educate its membership and provide a fraternal environment.\n\nMembership selection in NPHC is an individualized process that is different for each organization. Chapters choose the time when they will take new members. This process, known as intake, generally begins with an interest meeting followed by a period of membership education. The membership process culminates with initiation and a probate, or “coming-out” show, in which the organization’s new members are revealed to the community.\n\nWe strongly encourage those interested in the Membership Intake process to contact the respective NPHC organizations for more information. To participate in the intake process with any NPHC organization, you must first attend an NPHC Convocation.
