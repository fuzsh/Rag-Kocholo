Members of our Greek-letter organizations are leaders both on and off-campus and generally participate in more than one student organization on campus. Our chapters have donated thousands of dollars to their philanthropies/charitable organizations and participated in countless hours of community service throughout the year.\n\nMake the most of your college experience and GO GREEK!"
