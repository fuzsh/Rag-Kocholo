Among our common values are Truth and Justice, Scholarship, Diversity, Chivalry, and Character.\n\nOur values and character are exhibited in everything that we do. We believe in developing well rounded men to be the next generation of leaders. Intramural sports, social events, formal events, campus groups and clubs, scholarship commitments, and brotherhood events are just a few examples of the involvement of Sigma Pi brothers."
