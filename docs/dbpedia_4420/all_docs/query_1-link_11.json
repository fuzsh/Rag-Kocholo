        "text": "At Lander University, students may join a fraternity or sorority beginning with their first semester of their first year. Students must be considered full-time and enrolled in a minimum of 12 credit hours. Some Greek organizations have a minimum amount of credits required for membership consideration not allowing them to join until their 12+ credits are complete.\n\nLander University requires a minimum GPA of 2.0 to be a member of any student organization. However, Greek organizations usually have a higher GPA requirement to remain an active member. First-time students must have a 2.5 high school GPA. All members of Greek organizations agree to release their grades in order to hold organizations and members accountable to this standard.\n\nNational Panhellenic Conference (NPC, CPC or often referred to as the Lander College Panhellenic Council) is an umbrella organization that governs 26 all-women’s organizations. National Pan-Hellenic Council (also known as the Divine Nine) governs nine historically African American fraternities and sororities. The North American Inter-fraternity Conference (NIC) represents 70 men’s fraternities. Individuals of all races, cultures and backgrounds are welcome to join an organization under any governing organization.\n\nThe best way to find out more information about joining an NPHC organization is speaking with the current members. They hold informational meetings that will provide you with all the information on the organizations’ history, traditions, and the process of becoming a member. Information/Interest meeting notifications are often sent to your Lander email account. These meetings take place on campus but do not occur every semester. Current NPHC organizations are Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., Sigma Gamma Rho,Inc., and Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. If you are interested in starting a NPHC organization that is not currently at Lander, contact the director of fraternity and sorority life.\n\nThe reality is that not everyone who goes through recruitment finds a match, but every effort is made to provide opportunities for involvement to any young man or woman who is interested in the fraternity/sorority experience.\n\nBeing a legacy to an organization means one must have a family member who is a member of that organization. Most commonly this family member is a parent, grandparent, aunt/uncle, or sister/brother.\n\nHaving a reference or being a legacy to an organization does not guarantee someone membership in an organization. It may provide an organization another perspective of an individuals character, however it does not directly impact the decision of inviting that person to join a specific organization.\n\nYes! All full time students that meet the minimum GPA requirement are eligible to go Greek.\n\nThe NPC, NPHC, NIC, and any organizations they govern do not condone hazing in any form. Each organization has banned hazing in all of their chapters and has policies stating so. Lander University also has a policy against hazing that can be found in the Student Code of Conduct Article III, section 2.e. Each Greek organization participates in National Hazing Prevention Week educational programs every September.\n\nIf you have concerns about hazing, you should speak with the director of fraternity and sorority life, located in the Office of Student Life. Hazing can also be reported anonymously at 1-888-NOT-HAZE (1-888-668-4293).\n\nYes! It is never to late to join a Greek organization, because membership does not end at graduation. Membership in a fraternity and sorority is for your entire life and has many benefits that you can choose to take advantage, even after you graduate.\n\nAll Greek organizations are welcoming of student-athletes. You may find it beneficial to speak with your coach about managing your time between all of your commitments. It is also important to inform the organization about the obligations you have as being a student-athlete so they can work with you and make arrangements for any events you might miss due to your participation on your team.\n\nEveryone is different when it comes to time management. You might talk to some Greek students on campus to find out the time commitment required for each chapter. Many students are able to manage organization responsibilities, jobs or internships, academics and involvement in other campus organizations. Each organization has academic standards that members must meet in order to remain active within the chapter. This standard varies from chapter to chapter but is at least the required 2.0 GPA that is required to be involved in any student organization at Lander University.\n\nSee the Greek Grade Reports to see chapter GPAs and academic rankings.\n\nGreek Grade Report (PDF)\n\nBeing in a Greek organization does require a payment of dues. The money is used to fund the operations, social events and programming for the chapter. It also allows the inter/national organization to continue to provide resources and support for the chapter. The cost of membership varies for each organization and can change each semester."
