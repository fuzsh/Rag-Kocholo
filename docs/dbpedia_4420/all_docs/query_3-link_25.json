The represented fraternities participate in year-long recruitment initiatives, meaning they are able to extend a bid, or invitation to membership, to any man meeting the academic requirements at any time. The Interfraternity Council holds an organized formal recruitment in September to allow interested men the opportunity to meet and get to know all organizations.\n\nIFC Organizations\n\nAlpha Sigma Phi\n\nDelta Chi\n\nKappa Alpha Order\n\nPi Kappa Phi\n\nPhi Gamma Delta\n\nSigma Phi Epsilon\n\nSigma Pi\n\nNational Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC)\n\nThe National Pan-Hellenic Council governs seven of the nine National Pan-Hellenic Council fraternities and sororities. Membership intake is different for each NPHC organization. These organizations typically look for students that have at least 12 earned credit hours, maintain a certain GPA, and have completed service hours. Potential members should look for respective chapter informational meetings as a starting point to the intake process. Those who are interested are encouraged to research the history of each organization, visit their national website, and learn of their respective membership requirements.\n\nNPHC Organizations\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.\n\nDelta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.\n\nPhi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.\n\nSigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.\n\nZeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.\n\nOmega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.\n\nCollege Panhellenic Council (CPC)\n\nThe College Panhellenic Council supports the women's fraternities and sororities that are represented by membership in the National Panhellenic Conference. The Panhellenic Council hosts its primary recruitment process in August. An Executive Board made up of eight sorority women work year-round to promote unity within the sororities, through bi-weekly delegation meetings, frequent events for the whole CPC community, hosting Formal Recruitment each year, and much more. The Executive Board works to promote the Panhellenic mission and vision of building relationships on trust through transparency, accountability and mutual respect. Innovation and core values of friendship, leadership, service, knowledge, integrity and community guide us in fulfilling our mission.
