(NIC) is the trade association representing 69 international and national men’s fraternities. The NIC serves to advocate the needs of its member fraternities through enrichment of the fraternity experience, advancement and growth of the fraternity community, and enhancement of the educational mission of the host institutions.*\n\nThe local governing NIC council at Hopkins is called the Interfraternity Council (IFC). Currently, six inter/national social fraternities make up the IFC. An executive board together with delegates from each of the recognized NIC organizations sit on this council.\n\nLearn more about the Interfraternity Council.\n\nChapters\n\nNational WebsiteLetters (Organization Founding Year)Local Chapter (Chapter Charter Year)Local Chapter WebsitePhilanthropy Alpha Epsilon PiΑΕΠ (1913)Psi (1936)Alpha Epsilon PiStop Soldier Suicide Beta Theta PiΒθΠ (1839)Alpha Chi (1877)Beta Theta PiAlpha Epsilon Pi Foundation Phi Delta ThetaΦΔθ (1848)Maryland Delta (2009)Phi Delta Theta, Maryland Delta Phi Gamma DeltaFIJI (1848)Beta Mu (1891)Phi Gamma Delta , Beta MuUSO\n\nRed Cross Phi Kappa PsiΦΚΨ (1852)Maryland Alpha (1879) Phi Kappa Psi, Maryland AlphaBoys and Girls Club of Baltimore\n\nPaul's Place Soup Kitchen Delta PhiΔΦ (1826)Xi ChapterN/AN/A\n\nIntercultural Greek Council (IGC)\n\nThe Intercultural Greek Council (IGC) is Hopkins’s governing council for our 10 culturally-based fraternities and sororities. These organizations are represented nationally by several governing organizations including the National APIA Panhellenic Association (NAPA), the National Association for Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO), the National Multicultural Greek Council (NMGC), and the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC). The IGC supports the development of brotherhood, sisterhood, leadership, community service, and philanthropy. It also helps to maintain council membership guidelines to ensure the educational and individual success of its member organizations. An executive board together with delegates from each of the chapters sit on this council.\n\nLearn more about the Intercultural Greek Council.\n\nChapters\n\nNational WebsiteOrganization Letters (Founding Year)Local Chapter Designation (Charter Year)Local Chapter WebsitePhilanthropy Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.ΑΚΑ (1908)Xi Tau Chapter (1976)Alpha Kappa AlphaThe Alpha Kappa Alpha Educational Foundation alpha Kappa Delta PhiαΚΔΦ (1989)Associate Chapter (1997)Associate ChapterAvon Breast Cancer Crusade Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, IncorporatedΑΦΑ (1906)Sigma Sigma (1991)Alpha Phi Alpha, Sigma Sigma ChapterMarch of Dimes Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.ΔΣΘ (1913)Mu Psi (1976)Delta Sigma Theta, Mu Psi ChapterDelta Research and Educational Foundation Delta Xi PhiΔΞΦ (1994)Lambda (2003)Delta Xi Phi\n\nDelta Xi Phi Facebook PageAmerican Cancer Society Kappa Alpha PsiΚΑΨ (1911)Rho Upsilon (2019)Kappa Alpha Psi The Kappa Alpha Psi Foundation Latinas Promoviendo Comunidad Lambda Pi ChiΛΠΧ (1988)Sigma (2004)Latinas Promoviendo Cumunidad, Sigma ChapterThe National Book Scholarship Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, IncorporatedΣΓΡ (1922)Rho Omega (2009) Sigma Gamma Rho, Rho Omega ChapterOperation Big Book Bag\n\nHattie McDaniel Breast Cancer Awareness\n\nMarch for Babies\n\nSt. Jude Children's Hospital Campaign Hermandad de Sigma Iota Alpha, IncorporadaΣΙΑ (1990)Beta Zeta (2014)Hermanadad de Sigma Iota Alpha, Beta Zeta ChapterChildren International\n\nOne Heartland Sigma Omicron PiΣΟΠ (1930)Lambda (2002)Sigma Omicron Pi, Lambda Chapter\n\nSOPi FacebookThe Malala Fund\n\nPanhellenic Association at Johns Hopkins (PAJH)\n\nThe National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) provides support and guidance for 26 inter/national sororities and serves as the national voice on contemporary issues of sorority life. Founded in 1902, NPC is one of the oldest and largest women’s membership organizations representing more than four million women at 655 college/university campuses and 4,500 local alumnae chapters in the U.S. and Canada. Each year, NPC-affiliated collegians and alumnae donate more than $5 million to worthy causes, provide $2.8 million in scholarships to women, and volunteer 500,000 hours in their communities.*\n\nThe governing NPC council at Hopkins is called the Panhellenic Association at Johns Hopkins (PAJH). There are five inter/national social sororities on campus. Finally, as with the other two councils, an executive board together with delegates from each of the chapters sit on the council.\n\nLearn more about the Panhellenic Association.\n\nChapters\n\nLocal WebsiteOrganization Letters (Founding Year)Local Chapter Designation (Charter Year)Local Chapter WebsitePhilanthropy Alpha PhiΑΦ(1872)Johns HopkinsAlpha PhiThe Alpha Phi Foundation Kappa Alpha ThetaΚΑΘ(1870)Xi Chapter Kappa Alpha ThetaCourt Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) Kappa Kappa GammaΚΚΓ(1870)Theta Delta Kappa Kappa GammaReading is Fundamental Phi MuΦΜ(1852)Rho PsiPhi MuChildren's Miracle Network Hospitals (CMNH) Pi Beta PhiΠΒΦ(1867)Maryland Gamma(2010)Maryland GammaRead>Lead>Achieve\n\n*Language adapted from the association or conference website.\n\nIndependent Organizations (not affiliated with a council)\n\nOrganization Letters (Founding Year)Local Chapter Designation (Charter Year)Local Chapter Website IX Society (2009)Johns HopkinsIX Society ΑΦΩ (1925)Kappa MuAlpha Phi Omega ΘΤ Engineering Fraternity(1904)Theta Delta Theta Tau ΑΚΨ(1904)Rho PsiAlpha Kappa Psi\n\nSuspended, Unrecognized or “Local” Organizations\n\nInformation on suspended, unrecognized, or “local” organizations at Johns Hopkins University can be found in the Chapter Conduct and Disciplinary Status section."
