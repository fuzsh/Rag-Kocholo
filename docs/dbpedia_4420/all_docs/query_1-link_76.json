        "text": "Recognized Student Organizations (RSOs) are made up of over 120 student-led clubs and organizations with themes ranging from academics, athletics, culture, professional, performing arts, special interest, political, spiritual, social justice, wellness, and many others. Getting involved with an RSO is one of the quickest ways to connect with other Seawolves, develop friendships, explore your passions, and gain leadership experience. All are open to currently enrolled Sonoma State students.\n\nSport clubs are competitive clubs that travel and compete against other universities in leagues, conferences, and tournaments at the local, regional and national level. They are supported by a National Governing Body (if applicable). Most sport clubs have a coach and pay player dues.\n\nRecreation clubs are sport related general clubs that meet weekly and host local and regional events. Recreational clubs can be purely recreational or compete in tournaments.\n\nYou can find and explore a directory of all active Recognized Student Organizations below.\n\nIf you donâ€™t see an RSO that fits your specific interests or needs, starting a new club or organization is easy! Please review the following basic requirements for starting the recognition process below:\n\nRecruit at least 4 other SSU students (5 total including yourself) that are interested in joining your organization.\n\nOnce you have 5 total members, decide who would like to serve as the President and who would like to serve as the Treasurer.\n\nRecruit a faculty or staff member that is interested in serving as your Advisor.\n\nSchedule a meeting with the appropriate Student Involvement Advisor to discuss the next steps of the Recognition Process.\n\nSports and Recreation Clubs: Mike Dominguez dominguezm@sonoma.edu\n\nGeneral Clubs: Chelsea Hutton huttonc@sonoma.edu\n\nThe relationships and experience you gain through your involvement in a Recognized Student Org will have an immeasurable impact on your experience at SSU and beyond. Make sure to check out the club and organization directory listed below and see all the possibilities. If you have questions about student organizations at Sonoma State, please contact Student Involvement at studentinvolvement@sonoma.edu.\n\nSee the full list of:\n\nGreek Life\n\nClubs & Orgs"
