There are currently 15 recognized fraternities and sororities on campus.\n\nNote on Unrecognized Groups\n\nRecognition of the following organizations at Monmouth University has been withdrawn by their respective Inter/National Headquarters: Delta Tau Delta, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Xi, Alpha Kappa Psi and Zeta Tau Alpha. The University supports these actions and no longer recognizes Delta Tau Delta, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Xi, Alpha Kappa Psi and Zeta Tau Alpha fraternities as part of the fraternity and sorority community. Anyone continuing to recruit new members for any of these groups would be violating the Student Code of Conduct and the Inter/National Headquartersâ policies.\n\n(Delta Tau Delta, Tau Kappa Epsilon, and Theta Xi are men’s organizations. Alpha Kappa Psi is a co-educational professional business fraternity. Zeta Tau Alpha is a women’s organization)."
