        "text": "Fraternities and sororities History:\n\nFraternities and sororities, also known as Greek letter organizations, have a long history in US colleges and universities. The first fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa, was established in 1776 at the College of William & Mary. However, it was initially a literary and debating society and did not adopt the Greek letter name until 1781.\n\nThe modern concept of fraternities as we know it today, with Greek letters and rituals, began to take shape in the early 19th century. The first social fraternity, Kappa Alpha Society, was founded in 1825 at Union College in Schenectady, New York. This was followed by the establishment of other fraternities, including Sigma Phi (1827), Delta Phi (1827), and Psi Upsilon (1833).\n\nThe oldest white sorority is Alpha Delta Pi (ΑΔΠ), founded on May 15, 1851, at Wesleyan Female College in Macon, Georgia. It was established by six women who sought to create a sisterhood that would promote academic excellence, personal development, and community service.\n\nOldest Black Sorority:\n\nThe oldest Black sorority is Alpha Kappa Alpha (ΑΚΑ), founded on January 15, 1908, at Howard University in Washington, D.C. It was established by nine African American women, led by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle, who sought to create an organization that would promote sisterhood, academic excellence, and community service.\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha has a rich history and has played a significant role in the African American community, with notable members including Maya Angelou, Rosa Parks, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Shirley Chisholm, among many others. Today, Alpha Kappa Alpha has over 1,000 chapters worldwide and continues to be a leading organization in the African American community, promoting education, empowerment, and service.\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha is also a member of the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), an umbrella organization for historically Black Greek-letter organizations.\n\nOldest White Sorority: Alpha Delta Pi has a rich history and has played a significant role in the development of the sorority system. It is a member of the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) and has over 160 chapters worldwide. Alpha Delta Pi is often referred to as the “first” sorority, as it was the first to be established at a college or university. It predates the other NPC sororities by several decades, and its founding is considered a milestone in the history of women’s fraternal organizations.\n\nOldest Latina Sorority: The oldest Latina sorority is Alpha Pi Sigma (ΑΨΣ), founded on March 4, 1990, at San Diego State University in California. It was established by a group of Latinx women who sought to create an organization that would promote sisterhood, academic excellence, and community service, as well as celebrate and empower Latinx culture and heritage. Alpha Pi Sigma is a member of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO) and has chapters across the United States. The sorority is dedicated to supporting and empowering Latinx women, and its founding marked an important milestone in the history of Latinx fraternal organizations.\n\nAlpha Pi Sigma’s mission is to “empower women, impact the community, and foster a legacy of sisterhood” and its values are based on the principles of Unity, Strength, and Pride. The sorority is committed to promoting higher education, cultural awareness, and community service, and has become a vital part of the Latinx community on college campuses and beyond.\n\nToday, there are over 9 million students participating in fraternities and sororities in the United States and Canada, with hundreds of different organizations represented on college campuses.\n\nOldest Black Fraternity:\n\nThe oldest Black fraternity is Alpha Phi Alpha (ΑΦΑ), founded on December 4, 1906, at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. It was established by seven African American students known as the “Seven Jewels,” who sought to create an organization that would promote academic excellence, brotherhood, and community service.\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha has a rich history and has played a significant role in the African American community, with notable members including Martin Luther King Jr., Thurgood Marshall, and W.E.B. Du Bois, among many others. Today, Alpha Phi Alpha has over 700 chapters worldwide and continues to be a leading organization in the African American community, promoting scholarship, leadership, and service.\n\nOldest White Fraternity: The oldest white fraternity is Phi Beta Kappa (ΦΒΚ), founded on December 5, 1776, at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. Initially, it was a literary and debating society, but it evolved into a Greek-letter fraternity. Phi Beta Kappa is considered the first Greek-letter society in the United States. However, if you’re asking about the oldest traditional social fraternity, it’s Kappa Alpha Society (ΚΑ), founded on November 26, 1825, at Union College in Schenectady, New York. Kappa Alpha Society is considered the oldest extant fraternity in the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC).\n\nKeep in mind that these organizations have evolved over time, and their purposes and focuses have shifted. Today, many fraternities and sororities prioritize community service, academic support, and brotherhood/sisterhood, in addition to social activities.\n\nOldest Latina Fraternity: The oldest Latina fraternity is Lambda Theta Phi (ΛΘΦ), founded on December 1, 1975, at Kean University in Union, New Jersey. It was established by 13 Latinx students who sought to create an organization that would promote brotherhood, scholarship, and community service, as well as celebrate and empower Latinx culture and heritage.\n\nLambda Theta Phi is a member of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO) and has over 100 chapters across the United States. It is considered one of the largest and most prominent Latinx fraternal organizations in the country. Lambda Theta Phi’s founding is significant, as it marked the beginning of a movement to create spaces for Latinx students to come together, support one another, and celebrate their cultural heritage. The fraternity has played a vital role in promoting Latinx empowerment, diversity, and inclusion on college campuses and in communities nationwide.\n\nOldest multicultural Fraternity\n\nThe oldest multicultural fraternity is Lambda Phi Epsilon (ΛΦΕ), which was founded on February 25, 1981, at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). It was established by a group of students from different cultural backgrounds who sought to create an organization that would promote diversity, inclusion, and brotherhood. Lambda Phi Epsilon has since grown to become one of the largest and most prominent multicultural fraternities in the United States, with chapters across the country and a diverse membership representing a wide range of ethnicities, cultures, and backgrounds.\n\nOldest Multi-culture Sorority: A multicultural membership that has grown beyond its original Hispanic-Latino origins Sigma Lambda Beta has also developed two 501(c)(3) nonprofits, the Sigma Lambda Beta Education Foundation and the Omega Fund ¹.The largest multicultural sorority is Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. (ΣΓΡ), founded on November 12, 1922, at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was established by seven African American women who sought to create an organization that would promote sisterhood, academic excellence, and community service, without regard to race, creed, or color. Sigma Gamma Rho has over 500 chapters worldwide, with members from diverse backgrounds, including African American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, Native American, and other ethnicities. The sorority is a member of the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) and the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC).\n\nSigma Gamma Rho’s mission is to “enhance the quality of life for all people, with a focus on communities of color, by promoting academic excellence, civic engagement, and sisterhood.” The sorority is committed to community service, leadership development, and empowerment of women, and has a strong legacy of sisterhood and service.Latina sorority\n\nNote: While sororities and fraternities are generally open to new members, they might not always be as welcoming as they seem.
