        "text": "Welcome to Fraternity and Sorority Life\n\nFraternities and sororities provide students with opportunities for personal growth and development of interpersonal skills. Scholarship, service, cultural appreciation and brotherhood/sisterhood are common fraternal principles among our fraternities and sororities.\n\nFraternity and sorority members can challenge themselves in a supportive atmosphere in which they learn new skills to enrich their lives and prepare them for career challenges and fulfilling relationships. In addition, participating students are eligible to apply for an array of scholarships offered exclusively to members of Greek organizations.\n\nJoining a fraternity or sorority is a lifetime commitment that will benefit you now and in the future. The Fraternity and Sorority Life community at SFA has so much to offer you. Each chapter is unique, but together they create a united, vibrant community. We encourage you to explore all that Fraternity and Sorority Life has to offer.\n\nMission\n\nSFA’s Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life strives to create transformative leadership opportunities in a learner-centered environment that promotes academic excellence, service to others, and promotes building lasting relationships with the university, other fraternal organizations, alumni, and the surrounding community.\n\nFraternity and Sorority Life Councils\n\nSFA is home to four governing Greek councils, which serve as a liaison between individual chapters and the university. Each council has unique chapters, traditions, and recruitment and intake processes.\n\nInterfraternity Council (IFC)\n\nAt SFA, the Interfraternity Council is composed of 15 chapters. IFC interacts among its members and the campus through meetings, social outlets, and philanthropic events. Our member fraternities have many different offerings and values to instill in these men. It is a testament to our fraternities and their impact on these young men that IFC has enjoyed revitalization in the last few years. Academic achievement has remained a focus of the fraternities. IFC continues to reach out to the community through various philanthropic events that help develop and instill values into the young men that become involved in our member organizations.\n\nIFC’s umbrella organization, North-American Interfraternity Conference, is composed of 64 member organizations nationally with over 5,500 chapters on 800 campuses. The mission of the NIC is to advocate for the needs of its members through enrichment of the fraternity experience, advancement, and growth of the fraternity community, and enhancement of the educational mission of the host institutions. The NIC is also committed to enhancing the benefits of fraternity membership.\n\nSFA’s active IFC fraternities include: Alpha Gamma Rho, Kappa Alpha Order, Kappa Sigma, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Kappa Psi, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, Sigma Tau Gamma, Tau Kappa Epsilon and Theta Chi.\n\nIFC Recruitment Registration\n\nMulticultural Greek Council (MGC)\n\nOur Multicultural Greek Council is the umbrella organization to the five recognized historically Multicultural and Latino fraternities and sororities at SFA. Though membership in this council is not restricted to students of multicultural heritage, MGC serves as a multifaceted organization whose purposes include representing multicultural interests to the university and community, managing and assisting in the expansion of future multicultural Greek organizations, promoting the concept of self-governance among fraternities and sororities, unifying the multicultural Greek groups, sponsoring large-scale community service projects, and planning various activities throughout the year with the other Greek umbrella organizations. Membership in an MGC organization is a life-long commitment. Members of MGC organizations remain active as alumni members and participate in many events nationwide.\n\nSFA’s active MGC fraternities and sororities include: Kappa Delta Chi Sorority Inc., Lambda Theta Alpha Sorority Inc., Omega Delta Phi Fraternity Inc., Sigma Lambda Beta Fraternity Inc., and Sigma Lambda Gamma Sorority Inc.\n\nNational Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC)\n\nThe university’s National Pan-Hellenic Council strives to uphold the principles of its individual organizations and works as a whole through brotherhood and sisterhood to excel in academics, service and campus involvement. NPHC promotes interaction through forums, meetings and other mediums for the exchange of information and engages in cooperative programming and initiatives through various activities and functions.\n\nBecoming a member of any NPHC organization is a lifetime commitment that should not be taken lightly. Once members graduate, they are expected to immediately activate with an alumni chapter. Being a member of an NPHC organization is a fulfilling and enjoyable experience. Prospective members are encouraged to research each organization by visiting local and national websites, attending educational and social events, and speaking with current members before deciding which organization they would like to join.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that an organization you seek to join does not define you, but rather you define the organization. Choosing and being chosen as a member of an NPC organization is an honor and a privilege. So, it is important to know who you are before you join. Remember, you make the letters; the letters don't make you.\n\nSFA’s active NPHC fraternities and sororities include: Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Inc., Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc., Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc., Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc., Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Inc., and Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc.\n\nMGC/NPHC Interest Form\n\nPanhellenic Council (NPC)\n\nThe Panhellenic Council at SFA is the coordinating body of the five NPC sororities. The Council coordinates recruitment, provides programming and activities for sorority women, promotes Lumberjack spirit, and works as a self-governing support system for our chapters.\n\nSFA Panhellenic women strive for academic success and are committed to the Nacogdoches community and furthering the cause of their national philanthropies. They contribute thousands of hours to community service and have donated over $100,000 to their philanthropies.\n\nChoosing to become a Panhellenic woman is more than four-year commitment; it's for life. Follow the hashtag #flywithpanhellic on social media to get a glimpse of the incredible things SFA Panhellenic women are doing year-round.\n\nThe National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) is the umbrella organization for 26 national and international sororities. SFA’s active NPC sororities include: Alpha Chi Omega, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Zeta and Zeta Tau Alpha.\n\nNPC Recruitment Registration\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are the STAR Standards of Excellence?\n\nThe STAR Standards of Excellence program was designed to encourage the overall improvement of individual chapters and to advance Fraternity and Sorority Life at SFA. Each year, organizations are evaluated and recognized based on a points system that includes the following categories:\n\nScholarship,\n\nService,\n\nOrganization Involvement and Leadership Development,\n\nNew Member Program, and\n\nOrganizational Management and Member Development.\n\nThe STAR Standards of Excellence are an internal accreditation program managed by the SFA Office of Student Engagement. The process is separate from the investigation and conduct processes outlined in SFA’s Code of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity.\n\nWhat is Order of Omega?\n\nOrder of Omega is a national leadership honor society for members of fraternity and sorority organizations. The society recognizes juniors and seniors who have exemplified high standards in the areas of scholarship, leadership, and involvement within their respective organizations, campus, and local communities. Members are selected from the top 3% of students at each institution. To date, over 500 chapters have been chartered throughout North America, each sharing the common goal of recognizing the many outstanding student leaders at their institutions.\n\nThe Epsilon Omicron chapter of Order of Omega is responsible for coordinating the SFA Fraternity and Sorority Life Awards each fall semester and Greek Week each spring semester.\n\nWhat is an unrecognized organization?\n\nAn unrecognized organization is a group that is not recognized by the SFA Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life, Stephen F. Austin University or the international/national organization of which the group displays letters, insignia, etc. Students are strongly discouraged from participating in unrecognized organizations, attending their events or affiliating themselves in any way with these groups.\n\nWhat does it mean to be an inactive chapter?\n\nInactive status means that a chapter is not currently on campus due to reasons such as low membership, low campus interest or the chapter members chose to become inactive.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a sanctioned organization?\n\nIf a student organization is alleged to have violated HOP policy 04-106 (the student code of conduct), the Office of Student Engagement Programs will conduct an investigation for any risk management or hazing violations. The investigation could result in sanctions but not suspension.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a suspended chapter?\n\nSuspended status means that the chapter is not permitted to be an active organization on campus, whether mandated by the university or the organization’s international/national headquarters. In most cases, there is a significant reason for such a suspension, and a specific reactivation date for the chapter is set at the time the suspension occurs. Members of suspended chapters are banned from participating in events, functions, socials, etc. that are, or are perceived to be, chapter activities.\n\nWhat is hazing?\n\nArticle V of SFA’s Code of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity defines hazing as any intentional, knowing, or reckless act, occurring on or off of the campus, by one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student for purposes of pledging, being initiated into, affiliating with, or holding office in, or maintaining membership in an organization if the act:\n\nis any type of physical brutality, such as whipping, beating, striking, branding, electric shocking, placing of a harmful substance in or on the body, or similar activity;\n\ninvolves any type of physical activity, such as sleep deprivation, exposure to the elements, confinement in a small space, calisthenics, or other similar activity that subjects the student to an unreasonable risk of harm or that adversely affects the mental or physical health or safety of the student;\n\nany activity involving consumption of a food, liquid, alcoholic beverage, liquor, drug, or other substance that subjects the student to an unreasonable risk of harm or that adversely affects the mental or physical health or safety of the student;\n\nany activity that induces, causes, or requires the student to perform a duty or task that involves a violation law; or\n\nany activity that intimidates or threatens the student with ostracism, that subjects the student to extreme mental stress, shame, or humiliation, that adversely affects the mental health or dignity of the student or discourages the student from entering or remaining registered in an educational institution, or that may reasonably be expected to cause a student to leave the organization or the institution rather than submit to acts described.”\n\nIn an effort to encourage reporting of hazing, the university may grant immunity from student or employee disciplinary action to a person who, in good faith, voluntarily reports specific incidents of hazing prior to being contacted concerning the incident or being included in the institution’s investigation of the incident. This immunity does not extend to the person’s own violation of hazing.\n\nHazing is a criminal violation under Texas law. For more general information about hazing, including types, examples and tips for recognizing the signs, visit Stophazing.org.\n\nGrade Reports\n\nCurrent SFA Organizations with Special Status\n\nInactive Chapters\n\nAlpha Tau Omega\n\nDelta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc.\n\nPi Kappa Phi\n\nSigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity\n\nSigma Iota Alpha Sorority\n\nIota Phi Theta Fraternity Inc.\n\nSanctioned Organizations\n\nThere are currently no sanctioned SFA organizations.\n\nSuspended Chapters\n\nDelta Chi Fraternity\n\nDelta Tau Delta"
