It gives you a sense of belonging and camaraderie in a new\r\nenvironment. Joining a fraternity or sorority is something many college\r\nfreshmen look forward to and recruitment is one of the most exciting times on\r\ncampus.\r\n\tFor many college students, their fraternity or sorority is\r\ntheir family away from home.\r\n\tPeople often believe that all frats and sororities are the\r\nsame. We can credit this to Hollywood&#039;s stereotyping in movies, but in reality,\r\nthere are actually several types of fraternities and sororities, and each type\r\noffers something unique. To be specific, there are five different types of\r\nfraternities and sororities that you can pledge to.\r\n\tLuckily for you, that is what we&#039;re going to talk about\r\ntoday.5 Types of Fraternities and Sororities\r\n\tAs a \r\n\tnew\r\ncollege student\r\n\t, you already know that you want to go Greek. The problem is\r\ntrying to decide which of the 123 Greek organizations is right for you.\r\n\tEvery frat and sorority out there falls within one of five\r\ncategories:\r\n\tSocial\tService\tProfessional\tHonors\tReligion/Ethnic\r\n\tif you&#039;re not sure which one of those five categories\r\nappeals to you, you&#039;re not alone. Let&#039;s take a look at each group and see what\r\nthey&#039;re all about.Social\r\n\tMost Greek life organizations fall under this category. Some\r\ngroups will do community service, while others may focus on professional goals\r\nand networking after college. The main goal of social fraternities is to build\r\ncharacter and find personal growth. It&#039;s a great option if you&#039;re looking to\r\nconnect with people with interests that are similar to your own.\r\n\tAlmost all houses under the social category will be\r\ngender-based. The largest frat in the country (Sigma Alpha Epsilon) has\r\nover \r\n\t304,000 members. The largest sorority (Chi Omega) has over\r\n300,000 members\r\n\t. That&#039;s a lot of brothers and sisters!Service\r\n\tA service-focused fraternity or sorority focuses on getting\r\ninvolved with the community, often giving back to a specific cause or purpose.\r\nThese houses can be co-ed and don&#039;t turn away members based on gender, though\r\nthere are single-gender service organizations as well.\r\n\tWhat&#039;s cool about joining a service organization is that\r\nyou&#039;re not limited to that group. You have the ability to join social or professional\r\norganizations, too. Joining a service organization leaves your options open\r\nwhile allowing you to help with a cause that&#039;s near and dear to your heart.\r\nBelow are some of the more well-known service fraternities:\r\n\tAlpha Phi Omega (APO,\r\n     A-Phi-O)\r\n\t: This is the largest collegiate service fraternity in the\r\n     United States, with over 25,000 members. It focuses on leadership\r\n     development and community service projects.\r\n\t\tGamma Sigma Sigma: This\r\n     is a national service sorority that focuses on community service,\r\n     leadership development, and sisterhood.\r\n\t\tEpsilon Sigma Alpha:\r\n     This is an international community and collegiate service organization for\r\n     anyone ages 18 and older.\r\n\t\tCircle\r\n     K International (CKI): This is a service organization for college and\r\n     university students that is sponsored by \r\n\tKiwanis International.Professional\r\n\tMembers of a professional Greek house use the group for\r\nprofessional networking. Any events held by the house usually focus on helping\r\nmembers achieve their career goals. Some examples of events can include\r\nseminars on resume-writing or continued education. They may even host job fairs\r\nand invite alumni members back to mentor current members.\r\n\tWhen college is over, members of professional groups usually\r\nstay active after graduation. There are different fraternities that aren&#039;t even\r\nbased out of a college. Whether you choose a college-based professional\r\norganization or one that&#039;s not affiliated with a school, joining a professional\r\nfraternity or sorority is a great way to network and advance in your career.\r\n\tIf you want to join these types of organizations, you&#039;ll\r\nhave to find one that includes your field. Some organizations only focus on a\r\nspecific field, so do a little research on the different organizations that\r\nexist. Here are some examples of professional fraternities:\r\n\tAlpha Kappa Psi: This is\r\n     a professional fraternity for students interested in business and\r\n     commerce.\r\n\t\tPhi\r\n     Alpha Delta: This fraternity is for students interested in pursuing a\r\n     career in law and legal studies.\r\n\t\tDelta Sigma Pi: This\r\n     fraternity is for students interested in business administration,\r\n     economics, and related fields.\r\n\t\tPi Sigma Epsilon: This\r\n     is a professional fraternity for students interested in marketing, sales,\r\n     and management.\r\n\t\tTheta Tau: This is a\r\n     professional fraternity for students interested in engineering.\r\n\t\tAlpha Omega Epsilon:\r\n     This is a professional sorority for women interested in engineering.\r\n\t\tBeta\r\n     Alpha Psi: This is a professional fraternity for students interested in\r\n     accounting, finance, and information systems.\r\n\t\tSigma\r\n     Gamma Tau: This is a professional fraternity for students interested in\r\n     aerospace engineering.\r\n\tHonors\r\n\tOf the types of sororities and fraternities, new folks will\r\nskip usual pledge process. Instead, the Honors houses invite new members based\r\non GPA. Only high-achieving students with high GPAs may receive an invitation\r\nto join.
