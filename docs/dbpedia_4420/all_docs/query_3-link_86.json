        "text": "Being Greek is hard work and there are lofty expectations, but our brothers and sisters will tell you that the friendships they make are worth the effort. From campus events, like lip sync competitions and pancake nights, to house happenings, like movie nights and weekly barbeques, members naturally form meaningful friendships. Annual events, like camping trips and leadership conventions, allow brothers and sisters to bond over shared experiences. There's always something going on - dance parties, friendly competitions, field days - and before you know it, your brothers and sisters are your family away from home.\n\nService and Philanthropy\n\nService and philanthropy play a large role in the lives of Stevens' Greeks. All chapters fundraise throughout the year for a cause, such as Special Olympics, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, to name a few. Additionally, Greek members integrate themselves into the Hoboken community by supporting local projects. Our Greeks volunteer countless hours to The Hoboken Shelter, Community Foodbank of New Jersey, and Liberty Humane Society, among others, in an effort to make their city a great place for all its residents.\n\nLeadership and Networking\n\nThe Stevens' Greek community focuses on leadership development and relationship - building skills by holding campus leadership conference each semester. Members often attend annual national and international conferences as well. Through these opportunities, and the leadership roles within each chapter, brothers and sisters learn how to articulate and communicate ideas, identify additional interests and grow as individuals.\n\nBeing a member of Greek life means you become a part of a lifelong network of brothers and sisters globally. Many Stevens' Greeks have secured internships and permanent employment as a result of the networking capacity through their Greek association."
