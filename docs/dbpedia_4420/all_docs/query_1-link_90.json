        "text": "Thanks to advice from his fraternity brothers, Parshant Mittan, a rising junior at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania knows to leave the last button open on a three-button suit jacket. As a member of the Alpha Kappa Psi business fraternity -- one of three at Wharton -- Mittan received that tip and several others, which helped him land an internship this summer at Goldman Sachs (GS). Even though Mittan got his interview through on-campus recruiting, he took part in mock interviews with brothers, which prepared him for the real thing. Senior members also taught him how to use Wharton's online career-services portal and offered guidance on his career aspirations.\n\nOpportunities to network and learn about job-related skills are enhanced in business fraternities because members are surrounded by like-minded students and alumni who work in related fields. However, many undergraduates say they make connections and learn about the corporate world through other professional organizations, social fraternities and sororities, campus career centers, and targeted recruiting efforts. With all those other organizations and networking opportunities, you're left to wonder whether business fraternities are beneficial or a waste of time."
