For other uses, see Fraternity (disambiguation).\n\nIn North America, fraternities and sororities (Latin: fraternitas and sororitas, 'brotherhood' and 'sisterhood') are social organizations at colleges and universities. They are sometimes collectively referred to as Greek life. Generally, membership in a fraternity or sorority is obtained as an undergraduate student but continues thereafter for life. Some accept graduate students as well.[1][2] Individual fraternities and sororities vary in organization and purpose, but most share five common elements:\n\nSecrecy\n\nSingle-sex membership\n\nSelection of new members based on a two-part vetting and probationary process known as rushing and pledging\n\nOwnership and occupancy of a residential property where undergraduate members live\n\nA set of complex identification symbols that may include Greek letters, armorial achievements, ciphers, badges, grips, hand signs, passwords, flowers, and colors\n\nFraternities and sororities engage in philanthropic activities, host parties, provide \"finishing\" training for new members such as instruction on etiquette, dress, and manners, and create networking opportunities for their newly graduated members.\n\nFraternities and sororities can be tax-exempt 501(c)(7) organizations in the United States."
