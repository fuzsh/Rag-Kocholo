        "text": "Beta Theta Pi, commonly known on campuses across North America simply as Beta, was founded on August 8, 1839, at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. One of the oldest fraternities in existence, it was founded by students who had previously been members of the Erodelphian and Union Literary Societies but had greater aspirations for their own organization. Founder John Reily Knox, Miami 1839, noted at the time:\n\n“There was an interest about the actions of men who bound themselves together by vows which were never broken and who pursued the great objects of their association with an energy that never tired, with a zeal which knew not-self, and with a devotedness that never counted gold.”\n\nWhen Beta Theta Pi held its first meeting in the old college building known as “Old Main” (today’s Harrison Hall), eight founders were present to establish an order they believed would embrace the good of their fraternal peers without any of their objectionable features:\n\n“of ever honored memory“\n\nThat night, Beta Theta Pi – the oldest of the three fraternities forming the Miami Triad, along with Phi Delta Theta and Sigma Chi – was born.\n\nIn its nearly 185-year history, the many generations of men who have joined the Beta band have ascribed to the words of Founder Knox:\n\n“What a few men united in object and effort will to do can be done; and more than that, such associations teach us in their records how far human friendships can carry us from the shrine of idol self.”\n\nOver the years, Beta Theta Pi became known for its entrepreneurial spirit, adopting the “Pioneering Fraternity” and “Leadership Fraternity” monikers.\n\nIndeed, by 1850 Beta had already racked up several fraternal firsts, including being the first college fraternity founded west of the Allegheny Mountains (1839) and the first to host a General Convention (1848).\n\nDuring these formative years, many of Beta Theta Pi’s signs, symbols, and traditions begin to take shape, including the creation of the Fraternity’s first badge and coat of arms and the adoption of “delicate shades of pink blue” as its colors.\n\nMost notable during these years, however, is that fraternities (Beta included) frequently faced hostility from college and university authorities and were required to operate sub rosa. This hostility was perceived to be caused by the mistaken belief that college secret societies were formed to interfere with discipline and rules.\n\nIn order to instill confidence in its campus partners of the organization’s noble ambitions, in 1879, Beta became the first Fraternity to publish an open constitution for public distribution. Therein, Beta Theta Pi proclaimed its objects, which have held true in the year since:\n\n“It shall be constituted as hereinafter provided and shall have for its objects the promotion of the moral and social culture of its members, the establishment of confidence and friendly relations among the universities and colleges of the United States and Canada, in securing unity of action and sympathy in matters of common interest among them, and the building up of a fraternity that recognizes mutual assistance in the honorable labors and aspirations of life, devotion to the cultivation of the intellect, unsullied friendship and unfaltering fidelity, as objects worthy of the highest aim and purpose of associated effort.”\n\nThis half-century in the Fraternity’s history is best defined as the period of great “Beta Spirit,” which was best described in 1905 by Brother Willis O. Robb, Ohio Wesleyan 1879:\n\n“The Beta is distinguishable and distinguished from all other kinds of fraternity men whatsoever, by just a little warmer and stronger, just a little tenderer and more enduring fraternity feeling than any of them can attain to … The first mark of a Beta will be his Beta spirit.”\n\nThere was a great reason to celebrate during this time, from having Betas occupy four out of the nine seats on the United States Supreme Court, to the wonderful centennial celebration and the establishment of the Founders Fund, which has evolved over time into the Beta Theta Pi Foundation and provided hundreds of millions of dollars in scholarships and leadership programming to members.\n\nOf course, two World Wars also made these years tumultuous and often left the future of Beta on many campuses in jeopardy. Such was the case for Theta Zeta Chapter at Toronto, which saw nearly all of its members in battle or preparing to enlist and at risk of losing their chapter house without an influx of $2,500 – the equivalent of $55,000 today – in cash to cover expenses.\n\nAfter the crisis was announced in a January 1916 edition of The Beta Theta Pi magazine, the Toronto Chapter Fund was established. Less than a year later, more than $3,000 had been collected and the Toronto chapter was saved. The Beta Spirit won out, as it so often does.\n\nThe Beta tradition continued to grow and expand during this time, with notable events ranging from the initiation of Beta’s first Black member, Bill Lowry, Kenyon ’56, to the construction of the Fraternity’s current Administrative Office in Oxford, Ohio.\n\nThis period saw the establishment of a 2.5 minimum chapter and individual GPA – a standard Beta Theta Pi has continued to raise over the years – and the Beta Leadership Fund, which began what is now a more than 50-year tradition of funding leadership programming for collegiates and volunteers.\n\nThough individual members during this time no doubt enjoyed the friendship and camaraderie afforded them by a fraternity experience, Beta and its interfraternal peers also largely fell victim to an “Animal House” mentality. For the first time, the longevity of our historic association was in doubt.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, however, the stage was set for a renewed commitment to the Beta principles that was born of necessity and nurtured by yet another evolution of young men who yearned for excellence and thrived on brotherhood.\n\nEven before the first decade of the Fraternity’s history ended, Betas raised their voices in a collection of songs. These were printed on a card and included opening and closing odes, a benediction, an initiation song, and a greeting of new members.\n\nSo essential was singing in the Fraternity’s founding and growth during the 19th century that many songs and poems emerged from that era, many of them still popular.\n\nCollections of Beta songs appeared periodically until 1902 when the publication became a red hard-cover book with gold leaf imprinted cover — a format that was followed for the next 90 years.\n\nThe Fraternity’s song collection has grown to be quite extensive over the years, containing songs written to long-familiar music and a number also set to original tunes. Additions are made from year to year, each new edition of the songbook containing new melodies."
