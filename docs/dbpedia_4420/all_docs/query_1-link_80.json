        "text": "Kappa Delta Rho is a dynamic Brotherhood of men with a common purpose. Brothers hold tight to the principles implicit in our motto, Honor Before All Things, and in being and acting as a KDR Gentleman. We strive to instill the following tenants in our daily lives:\n\nFellowship: To a KDR, the term Brotherhood represents the bonds of community and friendship that will last a lifetime. The familial bonds are strong and solidified by participation in our ritual. Membership is for life.\n\nLeadership: KDR chapters offer significant opportunities for Brothers to develop leadership skills. Members set chapter policies and standards, must meet national guidelines and expectations, serve in chapter leadership positions, manage budgets, chair committees, and plan community service and social events. These leadership opportunities help Brothers learn how to motivate others, encourage critical thinking, plan effective programs, resolve conflicts, and develop communication and organizational skills. Becoming a Brother of KDR provides the opportunity for involvement in other areas of fraternity and sorority life such as the Inter-Greek Council, Greek Judicial Board, Order of Omega Honor Society, the Interfraternity Council, Gamma Sigma Alpha Honor Society, chapter intramural teams, and so much more. KDR Brotherhood opens the door to campus leadership and involvement.\n\nScholarship: KDR is committed to the academic success of her members. Often, chapters provide academic resources for Brothers, including planned study sessions and tutoring. Additionally, many chapters offer financial awards and scholarship programs to encourage scholastic achievement. The KDR Foundation awards over $75,000 annually in scholarship monies for undergraduate and graduate study. KDR is also unique in that we offer an automatic $100 scholarship to new members during the semester in which they join and are initiated as long as the Brother is in good standing and completes the semester with at least a 3.0 cumulative GPA.\n\nService: One of the most gratifying parts of being a KDR is the sense of satisfaction and pride that comes with involvement in community service and philanthropic events. Each chapter has its own philanthropic and service events and activities. One commonality, however, is that each KDR chapter annually sponsors events in support of kids as part of our national philanthropy: KDR Kids. Each year, KDR donates thousands of dollars and hours of time to local and national charities through volunteering, fundraising, and other projects.\n\nTradition: Both undergraduate and alumni KDR Brothers come together to celebrate annual traditions such as Homecoming, Reunion Weekends, the Red Rose Formal, initiations and ritual ceremonies, philanthropic activities, and Greek Week. Mixers, formals, cookouts, theme parties, and other social events provide opportunities to socialize within the organization and to meet other students on campus. Nationally, KDR hosts, the Elmon Williams Leadership Academy, National Convention, Consuls Academy, and alumni events and trips.\n\nThe first general fraternity for which records exist was the Flat Hat Club, organized in 1750 at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. The members met periodically in an upper room of the Raleigh Tavern, and over a bowl of punch, their laughter reportedly shook the house. Thomas Jefferson, author of the U.S. Declaration of Independence and third President of the United States, was a student member of this club. The first Greek-letter society came into being because a student had been refused admission into a William and Mary organization known as PDA. The PDA club was supposedly a literary society but had long lost those purposes. The rejected man was a superior Greek scholar. With four friends, he organized a society of his own, using Greek letters to name it: Phi Beta Kappa. The first meeting of Phi Beta Kappa took place on December 5, 1776. It was a secret meeting, for the faculty of William and Mary at the time did not approve of its students discussing the pressing issues of the day and possibly straying too far from accepted beliefs. So Phi Beta Kappa developed appropriate signals of challenge and recognition. They met weekly at the Apollo room of the Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg.\n\nAfter two years, Phi Beta Kappa felt that other campuses should share in its experiment, that the higher education experience should provide consideration in preparing the student for his future responsibilities by also preparing his social skills. Thus, chapters were founded at several American colleges. As time went on, Phi Beta Kappa became purely intellectual in its aims; its original cardinal principles were “literature, morality and friendship.” During anti-secret movements of the 1830s, Phi Beta Kappa, the society, voluntarily revealed its once secret Greek name, Filosofia Bion Kuberneqes (Philosophia Bios Kybernethes), or “Philosophy (is the) guide to life.” Today, Phi Beta Kappa is a scholastic honorary society that recognizes undergraduate men and women who show superior achievement in academics in more than 184 college campuses across the nation.\n\nThe secret grip and ritual, the distinctive badge, and the use of Greek letters — all were used by Phi Beta Kappa and were adopted by subsequent Greek letter fraternities and sororities. However, the most important legacies of Phi Beta Kappa are these: high moral ideals, scholastic advancement, and the friendship of brothers or sisters with each other.\n\nFraternities and sororities are student organizations whose primary purpose is the personal development of their members, as distinguished from honorary, professional, departmental, and service fraternities. Unlike most other student organizations, membership in a social fraternity or sorority is a lifetime affiliation, and students are not permitted to be initiated into more than one fraternity or sorority.\n\nFraternities and sororities promote intimate relationship bonds of brotherhood/sisterhood and members typically refer to fellow members as “brothers” or “sisters.” Traditionally, most fraternities and sororities are designated by Greek letters; hence, they are often referred to as “Greek organizations,” “the Greek community,” or simply “Greeks.” Fraternities and sororities typically have rituals and creeds that promote ideals such as friendship, loyalty, academic achievement, intellectual development, service to the community and alma mater, honor and integrity, leadership, and personal responsibility. Many fraternities have an indoctrination and orientation period prior to initiation, and pre-initiated members are commonly referred to as pledges, associates or associate members, candidates, intakes, or new members. Some fraternities and sororities are culturally and/or community based.\n\nFraternities and sororities may select members according to subjective criteria consistent with college/university nondiscrimination policies. They are entitled to single-gender membership, provided they qualify under the provision of Section 86.14 of the regulations promulgated under Title IX of the U.S. Education Act of 1972, which require that the organizations be exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The content in this section was adapted from material created by the Office of Fraternity & Sorority Life at The University of North Carolina — Chapel Hill.\n\nAlpha (al-fah) Beta (bay-tah) Gamma (gam-ah) Delta (del-tah)Epsilon (ep-si-lon) Zeta (zay-tah) Heta (ay-tah) Theta (thay-tah)Iota (eye-o-tah) Kappa (cap-ah) Lamda (lamb-da) Mu (mew)Nu (new) Xi (zie) or (zee) Omicron (om-i-cron) Pi (pie)Rho (row) Sigma (sig-mah) Tau (taw) Upsilon (oop-si-lon)Phi (fie) Chi (kie) Psi (sigh) Omega (o-may-gah)\n\nMy son is using some words that I do not understand.
