        "text": "What will my son get out of Greek life that they would not get out of any other college organization?\n\n​\n\nComing to college is one of the major life changes that your son will go through. Joining a fraternity will help make the transition easier. The fraternity experience is unique and unlike any other experience your student will get on the Wisconsin campus. Developing life-long friendships with the members in their chapter helps make the campus smaller. For many members, these chapters become a home away from home. In addition to the brotherhood, every chapter is dedicated to enhancing leadership, scholarship, philanthropy/service, and financial responsibility through various programs and opportunities. It will be up to your son to determine the level of involvement they want to have in the organization and what kind of experience it will be for them.\n\nHow will joining a chapter now benefit my son after college?\n\nThe life long friendships your son will make through their chapter can last into post-college years. Greeks have national networks for their members to use for securing jobs and advancing their careers. Membership in a chapter is a life-long experience that the member and the fraternity enjoy together. Joining now is really an investment in your son’s future as they will reap the benefits now and for a lifetime. Sigma Pi's are members for a lifetime. Wherever a member ends up after college, chances are he will be able to find other members of his fraternity.\n\nWill my son’s academics be compromised if they join a Greek chapter?\n\nStudents often find managing their time difficult when moving from the highly structured high school environment to the freedom of college life. Greek membership assists in that transition by offering scholarship programs that may include study partners, mandatory study hours, and time management workshops. Your son can also access the network of chapter members who already know how to use campus resources like the library, study skills center, computer labs, and academic advisors. Nothing, however, can take the place of a disciplined and academically-focused student to ensure success in college. Thanks, in part, to the chapter’s academic goals and these programs, the average GPA among Greek members has been consistently higher than the All University Student’s GPA. We encourage you to take this information into consideration when helping your student decide which fraternity they may want to join.\n\nHow much time does a chapter take up?​\n\nThe time commitment varies from chapter to chapter but the first semester is the most time intensive as the new member goes through the chapter’s Foundation of Membership Education Program. The time spent in this program will give your student the opportunity to develop their leadership and time management skills, learn about the history of the Fraternity, develop friendships with their new member class, as well as the rest of the chapter, and allow them to become involved with other organizations. After the initiation into the chapter, expectations will vary. Each chapter has weekly chapter meetings and other mandatory events (philanthropic, service, initiation) throughout the year, but they are planned well in advance. The more your son puts into the chapter the more he will get out of being a member!\n\nWhat does it cost to be a member?​\n\nThe Greek Experience is an investment in your student’s future. The leadership skills, the academic assistance, and friendships will benefit your child beyond their college days. The perception that fraternities are only an option for wealthy students is widespread and false. Greek organizations are quite affordable and fees go to services that will positively impact your son. Many students work to supplement funding for their dues. Member’s dues directly support the betterment of the chapter and the national organization. To assist members, chapters may offer various scholarships and grants. We encourage your son to ask questions related to finances during the recruitment process. We also encourage you to be involved in this decision if you have any questions about the obligations regarding finances.\n\nHere are the fees associated with membership in Sigma Pi:\n\nPledge Fee: $150\n\nInitiation Fee: $350\n\nLocal Dues: This fee is determined by each individual chapter.\n\nRoom and Board: These fees will be determined by the local chapter or the college/university depending on who owns the fraternity house.\n\nAs you look into the Greek Community with your son consider the following information compiled by national studies:​\n\nFraternity affiliation can positively influence retention through graduation. Fraternity affiliation directly impacts campus involvement and overall student satisfaction with college. Fraternity affiliation can positively influence involvement in civic organizations after college. Some statistics compiled by the North-American Interfraternity Conference include:\n\nGreeks in government\n\n* 40 of the last 47 Supreme Court Justices have been Greek.\n\n* 76% of all Congressmen and Senators belong to a fraternity.\n\n* 63% of the U.S. President’s Cabinet members since 1900 have been Greek.\n\n* All but two US Presidents and Vice Presidents since 1825 are affiliated with Greek organizations.\n\n* Of the past fifteen presidents, twelve of them are members of a college fraternity.\n\n* All of the Apollo 11 Astronauts are Greek.\n\n* The first female Senator and Astronaut were both sorority women.\n\nGreeks in the business world\n\n* 85% of the Fortune 500 executives are members of fraternities or sororities\n\n* 71% of those listed in “Who’s Who in America” are Greek.\n\n* Of the nation’s 50 largest corporations, 43 are headed by fraternity men.\n\nGreeks on campus and in the classroom\n\n* More than 7 million men and women in the U.S. and Canada are Greek.\n\n* Over 85% of the student leaders on some 730 campuses are involved in the Greek community.\n\n* A University of Missouri study found that Greeks throughout the U.S. and Canada are more involved on their campuses and rate their overall university experience better than their non-Greek counterparts.\n\n* A U.S. Government study showed that 71% of Greek students graduate, while just over 50% of their non-Greek counterparts do so.\n\n* In the past ten years, more than 100 colleges and universities have opened their doors for the first time to fraternities.\n\nGreeks in the community\n\n* Nationally, Greek organizations are the largest and most visible value-based student organizations.\n\n* Over $7 million is raised every year by Greeks nationally.\n\n* Greeks form the largest network of volunteers in the U.S. Nationally, Greeks volunteer approximately 10 million hours of community service annually.\n\nGreek costs\n\n* Less than 2% of an average college student’s expenses go toward fraternity/sorority dues.\n\n* Greek Members have been found to be more successful financially as well as give more to their alma maters.\n\n* Students that are Greek are also more likely to participate in more extra curricular activities than those students who are not Greek."
