Each house has unique qualities and allows members to live in the community with their best friends.\n\nFraternity and sorority housing is designed to affirm and strengthen fraternity and sorority life as an important William & Mary tradition. We seek to create living environments that advance the highest and historical values of fraternities and sororities that members, alums and the university as a whole will respect and appreciate."
