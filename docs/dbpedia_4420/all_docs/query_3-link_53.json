Founded under the name of Senate in 1919, our purpose was intelligent debate. In 1920, our name was changed to Agora. Finally, in 1934, our name was changed to Chi Beta. During World War II, our membership decreased so the society was discontinued only to be re-founded in 1946 by seven women. It is in honor of these seven women that we start our literary meetings at seven minutes past the hour. The women of Chi Beta stress friendship, unity and sisterhood within their society. We put forth great effort in achieving our goals, but we still have a lot of fun doing it!\n\nGamma Delta\n\nLetters: ΓΔ\n\nNickname: Delts\n\nFounded: 1911\n\nLocation: Smith House\n\nColors: Pink and Green\n\nMotto: \"Crowned with knowledge, winged with power\"\n\nFlower: Red Rose\n\nBrothers: The men of Gamma Nu\n\nGamma Delta was the first women’s society to be founded on the Illinois College campus. Gamma Delta holds these three virtues as most important in running the society: tradition, creativity and individuality. In addition, Gamma Delta is unique because it focuses on individuality in productions as an integral part of its literary program. Delts are proud to be involved with many activities on campus and also within the community. We stay very busy throughout the school year by taking part in weekly business meetings, fund raisers, rush activities, service projects, literary meetings, joints with other societies and a yearly spring weekend in Missouri.\n\nSigma Phi Epsilon\n\nLetters: ΣΦΕ\n\nNickname: Phips\n\nFounded: 1916\n\nLocation: Smith House\n\nColors: Yellow and White\n\nMotto: \"Knowledge, Love and Service\"\n\nFlower: Daisy\n\nBrothers: The men of Sigma Pi\n\nSigma Phi Epsilon was founded in 1916 by three women. Since then, it has had a long-standing tradition of literary excellence, service, academics and sociability. Service is a vital part of Sigma Phi Epsilon. Throughout the year, we participate in projects such as: helping at the local soup kitchen, Big Brothers Big Sisters and the Ronald McDonald House. Sigma Phi Epsilon excels both academically and socially. We have many joints with the male societies and are actively involved in campus activities.

The men in red and white continue to work hard together toward self-knowledge and self-development through the pursuit of literary and forensic activities. The Nuers, as they are affectionately referred to, consider their bonds of brotherhood to be the strongest among the societies.\n\nPhi Alpha\n\nLetters: ΦΑ\n\nNickname: Phis\n\nFounded: 1845\n\nLocation: Beecher Hall, lower level\n\nColors: Blue and White\n\nMotto: \"Onward and Upward\"\n\nPhi Alpha Literary Society for men was founded in 1845. Today its meeting rooms are in lower Beecher Hall, the oldest college building in the state of Illinois. The men of Phi Alpha have a long-standing commitment to democratic principles, first evident in their spirited discussion of the slavery issue in the early years of the society. In 1881, Phi Alpha took the lead in organizing an interstate oratorical contest in the city of Jacksonville. Their victory of a debate team representing Knox College was the beginning of intercollegiate debate on the Hilltop. In recent years members of Phi Alpha have continued to distinguish themselves in service to our community and the nation.\n\nPi Pi Rho\n\nLetters: ΠΠΡ\n\nNickname: Rhoers\n\nFounded: 1929\n\nLocation: Edgehill\n\nColors: Blue and Gold\n\nMotto: \"Scholarship, Fellowship, Athletics, and Sociability\"\n\nSisters: The women of Chi Beta\n\nFounded in 1929, Pi Pi Rho Literary Society has already accomplished much in its lifetime. From distinguished alumni to current students, Pi Pi Rho is heading for a bright future. Some of our alumni include the president of Western Illinois University, a writer, a playwright and musical composer and owners of a successful computer business in downtown Jacksonville. The name of the society is derived from the equation of the circle, 2piR. This typifies the lasting bond of brotherhood that is built through this wide range of activities: literary meetings, business meetings, athletic competition and informal gatherings. For the social atmosphere, the Rhoers gather with each other both at their hall and throughout the community to maintain the Fourth Pillar of their motto: Sociability.\n\nSigma Pi\n\nLetters: ΣΠ\n\nNickname: Sigs\n\nFounded: 1843\n\nLocation: Beecher Hall, upper\n\nColors: Black and Gold\n\nMotto: \"Let there be light\"\n\nSisters: The women of Sigma Phi Epsilon\n\nOn Saturday, June 24, 1843, Sigma Pi became not only the first literary society at Illinois College, but also one of the very first Greek organizations in the country. Sigma Pi has continued to thrive more than 170 years later.\n\nNotable historic figures numbered among its membership include: William Jennings Bryan, three time presidential aspirant, and John Wesley Powell, first person to explore the Colorado River. Sigma Pi can claim distinguished alumni in every field of human endeavor from medicine to law to politics. These alumni are valuable assets to the current members as they continue to prove their loyalty through their support. For them, Sigma Pi creates a lasting connection to something bigger than all of us. It could do the same for you.\n\nAlpha Phi Omega - National Service Fraternity\n\nLetters: ΑΦΩ\n\nChapter: Eta Sigma\n\nNickname: APOers\n\nFounded: December 16, 1925\n\nLocation: 1010 Edgehill Road\n\nColors: Royal Blue and Old Glory Gold\n\nCardinal Principles: Leadership, Friendship, Service\n\nAlpha Phi Omega is a nationally recognized co-ed service fraternity founded by Frank Reed Horton, who based the organization on three cardinal principles: leadership, friendship and service.
