For convenience, the terms \"Fraternity\" or Greek Letter Organization (GLO) are used to refer to men's, women's, and co-ed groups. Organizations listed here include both national groups and local organizations of notability:\n\nAcademic and Social fraternities and sororities, listed as \"Traditional\" organizations, predominantly serving undergraduates\n\nProfessional fraternities\n\nHonor and Recognition societies, listed as \"Honor\" organizations\n\nService fraternities\n\nReligious fraternities, including Christian fraternities and Christian sororities\n\nCollegiate Secret Societies\n\nEthnic or heritage-themed fraternities\n\nNon-collegiate fraternities, including activist and most military societies\n\nHigh school fraternities, including those with a middle school presence\n\nCollegiate literary societies are listed in a separate section.\n\nCollegiate secret societies\n\nPuerto Rican, Philippine, and European GLOs are listed separately on this watchlist, for clarity.\n\nSee Project Notability Rules for the rationale on inclusion. See Listing syntax for an explanation of the short, one-line descriptions. Occasional editor's notes are in hidden comments adjacent to a listing. A Red link indicates an article for a notable society has not yet been written, or has been subsequently deleted; Project participants are encouraged to create and improve missing articles.\n\nNote, that this list generally does not list single, local chapters except those that have gained notability (property-owning, significant history, good citations...) There have been several hundred thousand local chapters that are known, most having merged into a larger national, but these predecessor groups are not notable for Wikipedia purposes. --At least in the view of the Fraternity and Sorority Project volunteers. These are often listed by the successor archive to Baird's Manual, managed by the University of Illinois and linked from many of the current articles here.\n\nSee also College literary societies\n\nSee also List of college literary societies\n\nSee also Category:Fraternities and sororities in the Philippines\n\nSee also Category:Fraternities and sororities in Puerto Rico\n\nSee also Category:Concilio Interfraternitario Puertorrique√±o de la Florida\n\nSee also Category:College sorority founders and Category:College fraternity founders\n\nDepending on the size of the campus Greek system, the Fraternities and Sororities Project develops four templates of Wikipedia articles for Greek Chapter lists. Two of these constitute separate articles which are linked to the main university article with a hatnote. The third type is a table in a section of the main university page. The fourth type, also on a main university page, formats a simple list for clarity and references, perhaps before further article development.\n\nThe Cornell model includes a system-wide historical summary along with a bulleted list of chapters, past and present. Besides Cornell, MIT, Minnesota and the College of Wooster use this model. It balances brevity and detail, is more condensed than a full table, and should be the long-term goal.\n\nThe Dartmouth model provides a small paragraph about each GLO or cooperative living house. Introductory text (at the top or with each subheader) may provide a system-wide historical summary. Virginia is another example. A problem with this type of list can be its attraction of puffery or promotional language by biased or newbie editors.\n\nThe Florida State model provides a table within a section of the main university article. Other examples include Iowa State and Alabama. These are candidates for standalone pages following the Cornell model, considering the size and age of the Greek systems there. Consider this a placeholder, until a standalone page can be developed.\n\nThe Trine model was an example of how past and present chapters can be identified on a main university page, without the development of a table or separate page. This section of the Trine University page has since been promoted to an article in its own right. See before and after, and compare with the standalone article. It is an example of how a list can be developed and eventually promoted to its page.\n\nMany school articles mention their GLOs only briefly on the university page or ignore the topic entirely. As these are historically significant groups that have impacted a significant population through the years, the Fraternity and Sorority Project encourages the creation or improvement of these pages as a reference locus. Note, not all of the pages or sections listed here have been updated to one of these templates.\n\nSee Category:Lists of chapters of United States student societies by college\n\nSee List of Greek umbrella organizations\n\nSee North American fraternity and sorority housing"
