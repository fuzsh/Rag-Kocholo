        "text": "Affiliation with these groups is a violation of the UB Student Code of Conduct. It puts students at risk for suspension and/or expulsion from the University. The University at Buffalo does not advise nor control the actions of these off-campus groups. Typically, the instances of hazing are high for these groups as well. University policy mandates a permanent transcript notation for students who are found to be responsible for hazing incidents that involve the injury of another person.\n\nThese groups have been advised by the University and their former national headquarters to cease all operations. This includes recruitment, education, induction of new members and the sponsoring of and/or participation in on- or off-campus programs. Failure to abide by these conditions on campus will subject students to on-campus judicial proceedings. All activities are subject to litigation by the legitimate national organizations.\n\nAs a student, if you are recruited by or have questions about unrecognized student groups, please contact Fraternity and Sorority Life."
