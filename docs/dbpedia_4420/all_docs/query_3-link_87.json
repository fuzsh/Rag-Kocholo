        "text": "The Efferson Student Union & Activities Staff understands the unique needs of fraternities, sororities and student organizations that have membership intake processes. We are committed to providing the Greek community with the tools and guidance they need to fulfill the vision of their founders. To better meet the unique needs of all student organizations that fall under \"Fraternity & Sorority Life\", the following councils have been established. The councils are designed to help the individual organizations to be successful through collaborative initiatives that are beneficial to all member organizations.\n\nThe National Pan-Hellenic Council, Incorporated (NPHC) is currently composed of nine (9) International Greek letter Sororities and Fraternities: Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc., Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. and Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. NPHC promotes interaction through forums, meetings and other mediums for the exchange of information and engages in cooperative programming and initiatives through various activities and functions.\n\nThe Professional Fraternity Council (PFC) was created in 1978 via the merger of the Professional Inter-fraternity Conference and Professional Panhellenic Association. The PIC (professional men’s fraternities) and PPA (professional women’s sororities) were each founded in the 1920’s. Membership in PFA is by fraternal organization and associated businesses. PFC members at FAMU are Alpha Chi Sigma, Alpha Kappa Psi Fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega Fraternity, Alpha Rho Chi, Kappa Epsilon, Kappa Psi, Phi Alpha Delta, Sigma Alpha Iota, Tau Beta Sigma\n\nThe Council of Independent Organizations (CIO) is the governing body for all fraternities and sororities at FAMU that are not member organizations of the NPHC or the PFA. The current CIO member organizations are Chi Eta Phi, Chi Rho Delta, Eternal Legendary Kings, Eternal Legendary Queens, Pershing Angels, Pershing Rifles, Phi Mu Alpha, Kappa Psi Psi, Sigma Lambda Gamma, SISTUHS Inc. and Progressive Black Men, Inc."
