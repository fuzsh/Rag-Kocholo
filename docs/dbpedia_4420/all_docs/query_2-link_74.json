Hofstra actively supports recognized Greek organizations in their efforts to the community on and off campus.\n\nWe would like to advise all students, parents, and guardians that there are groups that are not recognized by the University. For your own well-being, you should not affiliate with any unrecognized Greek or other student organizations. Hofstra University does not advise or control the actions of any unrecognized groups. Inactive and unrecognized Greek chapters are not permitted to recruit, hold events, or induct new members. If you have any questions about whether a group is recognized or authorized to operate at the University, please contact the Office of Student Leadership and Engagement at OSLE@hofstra.edu or by phone at 516-463-6914.\n\nChapter Nicknames Semester Removed Reason For Removal Alpha Phi Alpha, Fraternity, Inc.
