These four governing councils provide the opportunity for self-governance and structure for the 30+ chapters.\n\nThe following is a list of chapters that are active, along with which council it belongs to, contact information for the current chapter president, as well as website links and social media accounts that are available.\n\nAt the end of each academic year, each fraternity and sorority completes a chapter audit form to provide a snapshot of chapter operations. All information is self-reported by each chapter, with the exception of academic and conduct areas. These are compiled and available below."
