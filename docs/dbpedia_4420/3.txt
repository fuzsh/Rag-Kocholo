Fraternities and sororities History:

Fraternities and sororities, also known as Greek letter organizations, have a long history in US colleges and universities. The first fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa, was established in 1776 at the College of William & Mary. However, it was initially a literary and debating society and did not adopt the Greek letter name until 1781.

The modern concept of fraternities as we know it today, with Greek letters and rituals, began to take shape in the early 19th century. The first social fraternity, Kappa Alpha Society, was founded in 1825 at Union College in Schenectady, New York. This was followed by the establishment of other fraternities, including Sigma Phi (1827), Delta Phi (1827), and Psi Upsilon (1833).

The oldest white sorority is Alpha Delta Pi (ΑΔΠ), founded on May 15, 1851, at Wesleyan Female College in Macon, Georgia. It was established by six women who sought to create a sisterhood that would promote academic excellence, personal development, and community service.

Oldest Black Sorority:

The oldest Black sorority is Alpha Kappa Alpha (ΑΚΑ), founded on January 15, 1908, at Howard University in Washington, D.C. It was established by nine African American women, led by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle, who sought to create an organization that would promote sisterhood, academic excellence, and community service.

Alpha Kappa Alpha has a rich history and has played a significant role in the African American community, with notable members including Maya Angelou, Rosa Parks, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Shirley Chisholm, among many others. Today, Alpha Kappa Alpha has over 1,000 chapters worldwide and continues to be a leading organization in the African American community, promoting education, empowerment, and service.

Alpha Kappa Alpha is also a member of the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), an umbrella organization for historically Black Greek-letter organizations.

It is a member of the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) and has over 160 chapters worldwide. Alpha Delta Pi is often referred to as the “first” sorority, as it was the first to be established at a college or university. It predates the other NPC sororities by several decades, and its founding is considered a milestone in the history of women’s fraternal organizations.
