For a number of years St. Clairsville has kept up a separate school for the education of the colored children of the place. One of the old school buildings formerly used by the town is occupied by this school. A colored gentleman named West, has been the teacher for a couple of years.

UNION CEMETERY

pg. 228

The Union Cemetery Association was organized April 29th, 1871. The trustees elected were George Brown, David Brown, William Chambers, George Jepson, Samuel M. Thompson, Hon. R. E. Chambers, clerk. This cemetery is located about a half mile north of St. Clairsville, and there is about fifteen acres enclosed in the lot. The site is a beautiful one, being on an elevated piece of ground. A portion of this lot was used for years by the Presbyterians and underneath its green, beautiful sod has been interred many of the early citizens. Hundreds people this city of the dead. Scarcely a family in St. Clairsville, but is linked to this sacred spot, where repose the remains of kindred and friends. Soon after the settlement of this vicinity the dead were interred in this ground. This place is being beautified more and more every year. The evergreens planted there by kind friends above the resting place of those they loved will soon east their shade over the walks which kindred frequent. Here may come the lover and find a retreat of quiet weeping over the untimely fate of his betrothed and to deck her grave with flowers. Here let the father erect his monument to the memory of his noble child. Here let the profligate son catch the inspiration of repeatance and virtue as the gazes on the last memorials of his pious parents. Here let a daughter revive a mother's image and endearment.

"While this place of weeping still

Its lone memorial keeps,

Whilst on her name, 'midst woods and hills

The quiet sunshine keeps."

Here a grateful public can pay their tribute to talent, learning and industry, devoted to the interest of mankind. As the eyes, that from this point, look mournfully upon the surrounding landscape, may they be favored, like Moses from the summit of Pisgah, with brighter visions of the promised rest in heaven.

M. E. BURIAL GROUND.

pg. 228

In 1809 the trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church purchased from Josiah Hedges about one acre of ground for the purpose of using it for a burial place. When Mr. John Thompson came in possession of the land from which this parcel had been sold he donated a half acre joining it, to the Episcopalian brethren who used it until the society abandoned their church. Since it has been used entirely by the former society. Here rests the remains of several old revolutionary soldiers, the body of Genin and other noted persons of early days.

THE FRIENDS OR QUAKERS GRAVEYARD.

pg. 229

This burying place lies immediately north of town and contains about half an acre. Perhaps the first interment took place here along in 1810-12. It is still used for burial purposes occasionally.

OLD BUILDINGS

pg. 229

Major Thompson says that the oldest building standing in town is the corner house opposite Shepherd Davis, wagon shop, and that the second one is back of Bumgarner's shop. The west end of Fink's tavern was the first shingle-roof house in town. He also says his father, John Thompson, built one amongst the first cabins in St. Clairsville, on the lot immediately east of Judge Kennon's residence, in 1800.

HORSE MILLS AND DISTILLERIES.

pg. 229

On a lot near where the Friends' meeting house stood was erected a horse-mill along in 1807-8. A small still house was also built on the same lot in about that year. A small still house was also built on the same lot in about that year. Josiah Dillon owned them. The mill was afterwards burned down. A man from Zanesville operated the still. Mr. John Thompson purchased this distillery, and continued distilling for several years. Michael Groves run a still house on the lot owned by king. Distilleries were quite numerous in those days. Major Thompson in this connection can be related an old circumstance, which took place in the days of one-horse distilleries. A Tenton came to town with a three-bushel bag of rye, hunting market for the same. As no one seemed inclined to buy, the fellow got provoked, and said: "By jimminy! If I can't sells him, I takes him home and makes him into viskey, den I eats him!"

PRIMITIVE MEMBERS - PRESENT OFFICIALS

WILMUTH JONES

He migrated from Washington county, Pennsylvania, in about 1816, and was made a Mason in this lodge soon after his settlement. He attained to the degree of Royal Arch Mason. He held prominent places in this lodge, and was sent to the grand lodge as representative, in which body he tilled important positions on committees. He died here in 1862, greatly esteemed by his acquaintances.

WM. B. HUBBARD.

As a Mason, William B. Hubbard acquired a national reputation. He was made a Mason in this lodge. He filled the different offices of the same with satisfaction to his brethren. In 1838 he removed to Columbus. Whilst residing there, he was appointed Grand Orator for the year 1842. In 1850 he was appointed Grand Orator for the year 1842. In 1850 he was elected Grand Master of the state, which position he held for three successive years, with distinguished ability. Was elected the Most Eminent Grand Master of the General Encampment of the United States, serving in that capacity from 1847 to 1856. He died in Columbus, Jan. 5, 1866.

ROBERT H. MILLER

Came to St. Clairsville a young man, succeeded Alexander Armstrong in the newspaper business. He was considered a bright Mason, a sensational writer and a good citizen. He filled the office of clerk of the courts from 1846 to 1850. He died Aug. 15, 18i50, and his remains were interred in the "Union Cemetery."

MICHAEL RIDGERS.

Resided at Uniontown, Wheeling township. He was a devoted Mason and a humanitarian. He often made the expression that he was "devoted to his God and humanity." It was said he had a particular spot where he resorted for meditation. While here, one morning in deep reflection, he was impressed rather strangely that he ought to go to St. Clairsville. He had no rest until he started. As he entered the town he heard the cry of fire. A stable standing at the foot end of the lot where the National Hotel building stands, then owned by John Carter, was on fire. He hastened to the spot, and through his exertions prevented the fire from spreading, at the great peril of his life. All had forsaken the roof when he mounted it, called for water, and thereby saved the house; the stale was consumed. It was thought that had it not been for the bravery and exertion of this one man, the east end of St. Clairsville would have been destroyed. In his efforts to prevent the spreading of the flames his clothing was so soiled that a new suit was furnished him by the people. He returned to his home feeling that he had done a good day's work. This circumstance was often talked of the many years afterwards, referring to Ridgers with feelings of gratefulness. He subsequently removed to the far west.

ST. CLAIRSVILLE LIGHT GUARDS

pg. 231

This company, stationed at St. Clairsville, was organized and mustered into the Ohio National Guard as a company of infantry on the 3d day of August, 1877, during the "strike" of that summer, and whilst there was a call upon state troops for the protection of property.

Its membership, at that time numbering sixty-one, since increased by additional enlistments, meeting with several losses by commission and discharge.

The following is a lsit of the original muster-roll and its first officers:

ARMORY

during that time was a room 14x17 feet, in the second story of the court house. In September, 1878, a well and neatly constructed building, 30x80 feet, was completed at the expense of Richland township and St. Clairsville for the use of the company as required by statute, and has been occupied by it since as its headquarters.

On September 5, 1878, while encamped at Marietta, Ohio, with its regiment, the company won the second prize in a competitive drill, the Columbus cadets deservedly carrying off the first prize. In addition to its prize the captain received from Gen. George Crook, U. S. A., one of the judges, a letter of commendation upon the good showing of the company at the drill.

The company to-day is succeeding as well as the average state troops, receiving no support except by the occasional state appropriations, the efforts of some of its members, and by dint of the strictest economy. By observing military discipline and
