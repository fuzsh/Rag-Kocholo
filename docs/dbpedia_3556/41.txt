William Edward Pitchers, Sr., 78 of Summerville, SC, passed away on Saturday, July 15, 2023.

Born on April 13, 1945 in Evansville, IN, he was the son of Ethel LeMon Pitchers and Pearly Pitchers.

Bill, as he was called, was a retired Structure Repair Specialist out of the United States Air Force, which he was proud to have served. He loved to hunt and fish. He mainly liked to be outdoors. He had the knack for fishing best of all. I believe he could have caught a record fish out of a drainage ditch in the heat of the summer in a drought. When he wasn't fishing or hunting, he loved being with his family. He was a Dad, an Uncle and Grandfather. He wore many hats, as he loved to do, and treated everyone with Love and Respect.

William is preceded in death by his father, Pearly Pitchers; his mother, Ethel Pitchers; and sons, Jimmy Pitchers and DeWayne Edward Pitchers.

William is survived by his wife, Linda Pitchers; children: William Pitchers Jr. & Rachael Pitchers of Beaufort, Loretta Lynn Kennon & George Kennon of Myrtle Beach, Amber Rose Sorrow & Robbie Sorrow of Atlanta, Anthony Edward Pitchers of Atlanta, Raymond Edward Pitchers of North Charleston and Craig Scott Pitchers of Florida; grandchildren: Chelsea Labuda & Matthew Bryant, Adrian Labuda, Sarah Ashton, DeWayne Edward Ballard and Tristan Anderson.
