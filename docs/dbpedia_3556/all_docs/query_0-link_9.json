Cowen is a son of one of the most distinguished lawyers who has ever practiced at the Belmont county bar. Judge D. D. T. Cowen, his father, was a son of Benjamin Sprague Cowen, a noted jurist and statesman, of the same county. Judge Cowen's father and mother were natives of Washington county, N. Y., whence they removed to Ohio in 1825, settling in Harrison county, where Judge Cowen was born January 20, 1826. A few years later his family removed to St. Clairsville, Ohio, where his early education was acquired\n\nBELMONT COUNTY, OHIO - 501\n\nin the public school and at Brooks institute, of that place, his father being one of the founders of the latter institution. His classical training was received under the tutelage of Doctor McBane, of Cadiz, Ohio; later he studied medicine and surgery with his uncle, Dr. Sylvanus Wood, of Cadiz, and Dr. John Alexander, of St. Clairsville. He did not study medicine with the intention of practicing it, however, but with the idea of gaining a broader and more comprehensive education, and as preparatory to the practice of law. His chosen profession was the law, and under the wise guidance of his eminent father, and his father's partner, Hugh J. Jewett, afterward president of the Erie railroad, he was fitted for the bar, being admitted to the bar by the supreme court of Ohio, January 20, 1847. After his admission to the legal ranks, Judge Cowen began to practice at St. Clairsville, and soon attained a high standing at the bar of Belmont county, which, since its organization, has been in high repute on account of the great number of exceptionably able men who have practiced there. Notable among which are such men as William Kennon, Sr.; William Kennon, Jr.; John M. Goodenow, Ex-Governor Wilson Shannon, W. B. Hubbard, Carlo C. Carrol, Benjamin S. Cowen, Hugh J. Jewett, and many others of marked ability. In time Judge Cowen came to be the recognized leader of this association of leaders, and practiced in all of the courts of that section and in the supreme court of Ohio. Soon after the commencement of hostilities between the North and South he was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the Fifty-second regiment of Ohio volunteer infantry, of which Daniel McCook was colonel. That officer being assigned to the command of a brigade, the command of the regiment devolved upon Colonel Cowen. He participated in all of the engagements in which his regiment was involved, until the sad news of his wife's failing health forced him to resign his commission and return to her to whom he owed his first allegiance. Tendering his resignatidn he was honorably discharged in February, 1863. On his return home he was made chairman of the military committee of Belmont county, of which Judge William Kennon, Judge Kelley and Benjamin S. Cowen were members. Mr. Cowen was the prosecuting attorney of Belmont county from 1852 to 1858, he also served as clerk and mayor. of St. Clairsville, and was a member of the board of education and the board of school examiners from 1854 to 1862, at which time he resigned to enter the army. Judge John Okey resigning as common pleas judge, Colonel Cowen was made his successor, serving the remainder of the term. Judge Cowen's superior abilities were recognized by his selection as a delegate to the constitutional convention of 1873, receiving a majority of 2,300 votes in a county about evenly divided politically. Judge Cowen was twice married, his first wife being Hannah Frances Martin, and his second espousal being to Anna Martin, her sister. He was the father of twelve children. From its organization he was the president of the First National bank of St. Clairsville. April, 1884, this distinguished man passed away to his eternal rest, his death causing a sorely felt vacancy in the county.\n\nHISTORY OF THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY - 502\n\nFrank M. Cowen was born February 4, 1855, in Belmont county, and his boyhood days were passed in St. Clairsville, where he attended the common schools until he was fourteen years of age, at which time he went to live with an uncle, Gen. B. R. Cowen, of Cincinnati; Ohio. That gentleman receiving the appointment of assistant secretary of the interior, Mr. Cowen was given a first-class clerkship in the Pension bureau, at Washington city, which office he filled acceptably until he resigned for the purpose of attending college. He entered the Ohio Wesleyan university at Delaware, Ohio. After leaving college, Mr. Cowen returned to St. Clairsville, and on the completion of the study of law, and his admission to the bar, entered into a partnership with his father. He remained there until the opening of the Flushing bank in 1884; he then removed to Flushing with his family, having accepted the position of cashier of that institution. He was united in marriage to Miss Kate Meyer, daughter of Henry and Katherine Meyer. Their marriage has been crowned by the birth of one child, a bright little girl, who was born May 30, 1881. Mr. and Mrs. Cowen are both members of the Methodist Episcopal church of Flushing. Mr. Cowen is a member of the town council, president of the Gallaher tool manufacturing company, and secretary of the Building and Loan association of Flushing, and in those as well as in his position of cashier of the bank, he holds the confidence and esteem of the community at large, being a financier of much ability. This building and loan association, organized by the efforts of Mr. Cowen and other gentlemen in the spring of '88, by limiting its dividends to a low rate, and by a system of rebating excessive earnings to its borrowers originated by Mr. Cowen, certainly is one of the most liberal and equitable institutions of that character in the state, and its beneficial results are already felt and appreciated in that community. While living at St. Clairsville, he was town clerk and secretary of their building association, and he was also honored by his associates with the position of captain of the St. Clairsville Light Guards, which company 1n a competitive drill at Marietta, in the summer 1878, received the second prize for proficiency in drill; their captain afterward received a letter from the late lamented General Cooke, of the United States army, a judge at that drill, congratulating him and his command for their admirable discipline and exhibition, and speaking in high terms of the Ohio National Guard in general.\n\nAbijah B.
