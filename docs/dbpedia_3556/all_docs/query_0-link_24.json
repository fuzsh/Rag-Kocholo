That grim monster which is abroad in our land, slaying hundreds upon hundreds; that which often takes our nearest and dearest friend. We can imagine we hear the splashing of the oars while the messenger is bearing them over the river- Death come to the young as well as the old. Perhaps the young lady in the bloom of youth, or the young man in the pride of life, the aged father or mother, or the little infant snatched from its mothers bosom. How Careful then ought we to be in remembering our Creator in the days of our youth, when the evil days come not.\n\nAt Cameron, Monroe County, Ohio, Ellen, wife of John Boughner, departed this life. She was well respected by all who know her, and had faithfully followed our Lord Jesus Christ. She was in the pride of life when she was brought down to the bed of affliction, where she lay many weeks, till God, through his infinite wisdom, saw fit to send the messenger and release the dove-like spirit from the prison house of pain, to taste of the joys and mingle in the melody of Heaven. She who had walked hand in hand with God was enabled to say, at the departure of life, Come, welcome death, thou end of years; I am prepared to go. We have reason to believe that she is in the paradise of peace. We attended when the body was committed to the earth, and while we listened to the healing words of the inspired volume, saw friends weeping, and heard the clods of the valley as they fell in the grave, it thrilled our souls to think we were so fast hastening to the narrow limits of the tomb.

Then in 1866-7 he resided near Matamoras, in Washington County, when in the fall of 1867 he took up his residence near Graysville, where he died.\n\nWhile he enjoyed general good health he was a hard working man. He was the oldest of five brothers and two sisters, (one sister is dead) He had no opportunity to secure an education but perservered [sic] until he became a fair English scholar. Starting out very poor, during his early married years, much affliction in his family kept him in deep adversity, but by great energy succeeded in leaving his large family in a comfortable home. No doubt his years were shortened by his great perseverance.\n\nIn 1838 he married Jane Wright, by whom three children were born; only one of these, Rev. J.S. Covert, is living. This woman died May 1847, and in October, 1848, he married Catharine Swallow, by whom nine children were born; all of these are living.

Who will fill his place?\n\nHis remains were buried in Unity Cemetery near Antioch on Sunday, May 16. Hundreds gathered from near and far to pay this last tribute of love, among them a large family connection. A sermon was preached by Elder H.

They locked the house and left a kerosene lamp burning to light the children in their absence. Before they had got three quarters of a mile, they observed a fire apparently in their neighborhood, and fearing the worst, they rapidly retraced their steps, but only to find the house almost consumed when they reached it, the three children perishing in the flames.\n\nThe presumption is that the lamp was upset or exploded; and as the remains of the boy with an ax were found near the door, it is most likely he was trying to escape from the dwelling when the fire reached him, or suffocation from the smoke occurred.- Athens Journal, 4th.\n\nCronin, Mary J.

Inscribed upon the marble slab we see the language which speaks in unmistakable tones that sleep of death has been the visitor of some heretofore unbroken family. A father or mother, sister or brother, or some near and dear friend, has been the victim of icy fingers that grapple with all of Gods creatures and claims them as his own for a time.\n\nHere we learn a hero has fallen his victim while in the heat of battle, the statesman, the tall, the wise, the reverend head, the man of low degree. The father is snatched from his wife and prattling ones, the wife from her husband and companion, the infant rose is snapped in the morning breeze; all-all-all- must go from us at the summons of the King.\n\nAs we wend our way with slackened pace, bearing the remains of a loved one, we seem to hear the voice of the sleeper say, AS you are now so once was I; as I am now, so must you be. Entering the city of the dead our mind in its busy thought is arrested and called to answer, if we can, the question written intelligibly upon the countenance of the sexton of old, as he leans upon his earth-worn spade, his locks it may be tinged with the frosts of many winters, denoting his conflict: Wholl be the next? How deep and lasting the impression as he says, I gather them in; I gather them in.\n\nAs you pass near by, or through the cemetery, just above our little village, your attention is arrested by the slabs and monuments of marble, denoting the rapid stride of mortality. Among them we see a fine Scotch granite marble monument, pointing out the last resting place of Mrs. Rosa Goodhue, who departed this life October 4, 1874, being 33 years and 11 days of age. She was afflicted with that dread disease, consumption, from childhood. She bore her affliction with great fortitude, She has left behind her a large circle of friends and relatives to mourn her loss, and, so far as this life is concerned, lost to a kind husband, lost to an aged Christian mother, lost to sisters and brothers. LOST! No, not lost, but gone before. She has lain this tabernacle of clay down in peace. Elder H.R. Cash was called to conduct the funeral services, using as a foundation for his remarks the first part of the fifth chapter of Pauls second letter to the church as Corinth, being appropriate for the occasion: For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven, A synopsis of the discourse ran as follows:\n\nIsraels desire, while sojourning in the wilderness, was to reach the land of promise, that God had sworn to give unto them; to cross the Jordan, beyond which lay the land flowing with milk and honey, wherein they should find a place of rest from all their wearisome travels, the Holy city, the New Jerusalem, with its temple supplanting the old tabernacle of Moses while in the wilderness, which was moved from place to place at the bidding of God. To this temple Israel came to worship. So it is with man today- he groans being burdened with sin and the conflicts of life. He desires to depart and go hence. Since this tabernacle of clay is subject to all the ills of life, he desires to reach the land of eternal rest, not to be unclothed, but to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven. Paul says while we are at home with the body we are absent from the Lord, but when Absent for the body we are present with the Lord. Hence we look for a city which is out of sight to mortal vision, but seen with the eye of faith through his word, which says, I go to prepare a place for you, that where I am there ye may be also. In my fathers house are many mansions: if it were not so I would have told you.\n\nSeeing this mansion or house or rest is eternal in the heavens, whose maker and builder is God, why should we mourn to drop this, our house of flesh, and go to dwell eternally there, or mourn departed loved ones, God, who doeth all things well, is the receiver of the departed spirit and will give unto all as he wills while the body of the loved companion of our esteemed friend, A.J. Goodhue, is mouldering back to its mother dust, from whence it came, the spirit has taken its flight from the sorrows and cares of this worlds wilderness to the spirits land, to God who gave it, where no dread disease shall ever come. Oh, how good is God in come. Oh, how good is God in his greatness, and great in his goodness unto us. Jesus stands just beyond the river or Jordan of death, to stretch forth his hand as to a sinking Peter, and his loved one welcome. As Israel strove to enter the promised lad, so must we.\n\nHusband, I must be gone,\n\nPrepare thou to meet me,\n\nCold the stream, but beyond\n\nStands Jesus to greet thee.\n\nMother, the time is come,\n\nThe trump sound to call me,\n\nBe thou faithful now, and then\n\nDeaths grasp will not appal thee.\n\nSister, thy love has ever been\n\nTo me most kind and tender,\n\nBut God is love, and we have seen\n\nTo Him thy service render.\n\nBrother, what shall I say to you?\n\nMy life is ebbing fast;\n\nEmbrace the cause of Jesus true,\n\nAnd He will save at last.\n\nSister, thou wast mild and lovely,\n\nGentle as the Summer breeze,\n\nPleasant as the air of evening,\n\nWhen it floats among the trees.\n\nPeaceful be they silent slumber-\n\nPeaceful in the grave so low,\n\nThen no more wilt join our number,\n\nThou no more our songs shall know.\n\nDearest sister, thou hast left us,\n\nHere thy loss we deeply feel;\n\nBut tis God that hath bereft us,\n\nHe can all our sorrows heal.\n\nYet again we hope to meet thee,\n\nWhen the day of life is fled,\n\nThen is heaven with joy to greet,\n\nWhen no farewell tear is shed-\n\nElder H.R.

Church with which she communed. One of the gentlest of women, ever manifesting a sweet and contented spirit, which caused her to be recognized as an exemplar of Christian virtue; a regular attendant upon the means of grace, an earnest and unwearied servant of her Master; surrounded by a large circle of affectionate friends, and a family connection with whom she was in the fullest sympathy, often expressing her deep and tender regret to part from them, yet rejoicing in prospect of a better inheritance; in the bloom of youth, and with every reason to desire to live; but in the midst of all the unseen hand of the dark messenger knocked at the door of her earthly tabernacle, calling her to the bosom of Him who said:\n\nLet not your heart be troubled; I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am there may ye be also.\n\nThe last few months of her life she was a great sufferer: her affliction the much dreaded disease, pulmonary consumption, but not a murmur of complaint crossed her lips; ever patient, full of hope, trusting with child-like confidence in her Savior.

It occurred at Marietta, Ohio, several days ago, of which place he was a resident. Mr. Oldham was a native of this county, and was well and favorably known to many of our citizens. He became, early in life, a member of the bar, and was the contemporary of such men as Russell, Jacob, Fitzhug, Nelson, Hoge, William McConnell and others, all of whom belonged to the class which occupied position, both social and professional, of well merited excellence in the now olden time. Among these he was recognized as a peer, and as a lawyer far above the average ability. His intellect and social attainments were of a high order, and among his friends and associates it was universally conceded that those who knew him the longest, always liked him the best.\n\nHe was in ante bellum days an old line Whig. At the breaking out of the war, however, his sympathies were decidedly enlisted on behalf of the South. At this time, he was a resident of Moundsville, where the public sentiment was strongly averse to his own. Hence, that place becoming unpleasant for him, he took his departure of Marietta, where he has continuously lived ever since. In making this move, this State lost and Ohio gained a valuable citizen. He left many warm friends behind him to whom the news of his death was a severe and bitter shock. May he rest in peace.\n\nOldham, W. H.
