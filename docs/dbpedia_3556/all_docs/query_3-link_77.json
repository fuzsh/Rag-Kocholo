Additional information on James Jones Line is on the Geesnmore sister site.\n\nEarly Jones Families of Virginia\n\nJones families of Virginia have several distinct branches, and keeping them separate is difficult, as you can imagine. I am certain there will be errors or different interpretations to what follows.\n\nTo give some idea of the complexity of this examination here is a list of Jones members from the 1704 Quit Rents in Virginia. By contrast the same Quit Rents had only 2 members of the Gee Family listed!\n\nPrince George Surry Isle of Wight Henrico Peter 621\n\nRichard 600\n\nWilliam Sr. 600\n\nWilliam Jr. 230\n\nHenry 200\n\nRobert 241\n\nJohn 350\n\nJames Sr. 1100\n\nJames 1000 Anne 100\n\nArthur 900\n\nRichard 250\n\nThomas 100\n\nThomas 700\n\nJohn 200\n\nAbraham 600\n\nHugh 934\n\nPhilip 1,153\n\nJames City York Nansemond Accomack Frederick 300\n\nWilliam 150\n\nWilliam 50\n\nElizabeth 94\n\nOrlando 450\n\nRobert 100\n\nWilliam 70\n\nThomas 200\n\nWilliam 500\n\nEdmund 800\n\nRichard 500\n\nThomas 100\n\nMiddlesex New Kent Princess Anne King & Queen Evan 50\n\nHumphrey 150\n\nRoger 100\n\nWilliam 300\n\nFrancis 200\n\nFfrederick 500\n\nJane 200\n\nJohn 100\n\nJohn 100\n\nJohn 100\n\nFrancis 100\n\nMichael 200\n\nRichard 200\n\nRobert 200\n\nRobert, Jr. 130\n\nThomas 150\n\nWilliam 900\n\nKing William Warwick Essex Gloucester Ffrederick 2,850 Ffrancis 150\n\nMatthew 750\n\nPeter 150\n\nWilliam 70\n\nJohn 300\n\nRice 500\n\nRichard 350\n\nWalter 100\n\nWilliam 165\n\nWilliam 300\n\nCharles 225\n\nWiddo 45\n\nWilliam Jones for Northington 530\n\nWilliam 120\n\nLand Grants by the Proprietors of the Northern Neck Richmond County Westmoreland County Northumberland County John 139 acres\n\n1697Jones with Gilbert Croswell\n\nno acres 1697\n\nRoderick 1692\n\nJones with Gilbert Croswell\n\n129 acres 1699\n\nJames50-657 acres 1703/04\n\nCaptain William\n\n236 acres 1704\n\n200 acres 1705\n\n245 acres 1706\n\nHistory of Bristol Parish\n\nIn 1611, Sir Thomas Dale arrived with Rev. Whittaker founded Henricopolis (Henrico City) at Farrar’s Island which was the origin of the founding of the county of Henrico in 1634. On the south side of the James River the plantation Coxendale and Hope-in-Faith was founded with forts. Also in 1611, Sir Thomas Dale overtook an Indian village at the mouth of the Appomattox and established a plantation which he called New Bermudas. Bermuda Hundred was very close to Henrico city. Whittaker drowned in the river travelling between them in 1617 and Wickham was his successor, followed by Stockham, who was of the opinion that the Indians could not be converted until the elders and leaders were all slain. Charles City was formed around City Point as early as 1619. The northern edge of Bristol Parish was Powell’s Creek, (not to be confused with Powell’s Creek in Charles City County) and did not include Bermuda Hundred. It extended along both sides of the Appomattox River to the falls. Wood’s Church was likely the first church for this parish, although there may have been an earlier building nearby. In 1645 the construction of a fort named Fort Henry, with 600 acres was granted to Captain Abraham Wood, if he kept ten men there for the following three years and prevented fishing by the savages in the Appamattox River. Rev. George Robertson was the first minister and it is he who began the vestry book in 1720. Meeting at Ferry chapel and later at Blandford brick church, the first vestry were Robertson, Captain Peter Jones, Justant Hall, Lewis Green, Major Robert Bolling, Major Robert Munford, major William Kennon, and Captain Henry Randolph. In 1724 the south side of the parish was divided. Captain Peter Jones and his son William were tobacco counter for the section beginning at Appomattox Ferry along Monk’s Neck road to Stony Creek Bridge, then up Stony Creek to the Upper road to Nottoway River, then up between the same and the Appomattox River to the extent of the parish. Thomas Bott (Batte?) was appointed the counter on the north side between the Appomattox River and Old Town Creek. William Rowlett was the counter between Old Town Creek and Swift Creek. William Chambliss was the counter between Swift Creek and Henrico Parish. Chapels were soon authorized along the Namozine, Sapponey and Flatt Creeks as well as Well’s Hill.\n\nIn 1734 Dale parish was formed from Henrico Parish, south of the James River and Bristol parish north of the Appomattox which was in Henrico County. At the same time, Prince George County and Bristol Parish were divided from the mouth of Namozine creek up the main branch to Hamlin fork, then up the south branch to White Oak Hunting Path south to the Nottoway River, along the Great Nottoway including part of Brunswick and St. Andrew’s Parish, along the ridge between the Roanoke and Appomattox, to the Great Mountains, to the southern boundaries of Goochland and Henrico. This became the large southern district of Amelia County and Raleigh Parish. In 1738, Banister, Munford, Hamlin and Poythress chose a site for a chapel on Hatcher’s run and Isham Eppes contracted to build the chapel on the land of Allen Tye on the north side of Hatcher’s run. The following year, Bolling Poythress and Eppes chose a site for a chapel in the lower part of the parish. John Ravenscroft built this chapel on Jones’ Hole Creek.\n\nJones of Henrico County\n\nEarly Wills in Henrico County\n\nGilbert Jones 1685 Thomas Jones 1689\n\nWilliam Jones 1694 Edward Jones 1695\n\nHugh Jones 1705\n\nThomas Jones\n\nThomas Jones arrived on the London Merchant in 1619 with his wife, Margrett aboard the transport London Merchant as did Christopher Branch and his wife, Mary. He was first noted in Henrico County in 1624 at Ye College Lands. Thomas and Margrett were the parents of Thomas who was born about 1635 in Bermuda Hundred. He is the only known child. Thomas and Margrett were notorious and frequently in trouble for riotous behavior, fighting, assault and slander, as well as drunkenness. Margrett was ordered drug behind a boat in the river for her behavior. Let’s hope she learned from this without too serious a consequence.\n\nThomas Jones of Henrico County is noted in the 1656-59 in the records of Surry. In 1659 Thomas Jones of Henrico purchased an iron grey horse from William Jennings and the purchase was recorded in Surry. He may be the same Thomas Jones, countryman of Morgan Jones, who was asked to administer Morgan’s will in Charles City County. Thomas Jones was noted there as early as 1652 when he witnessed a deed in Henrico. In 1664 Thomas Ligon patented land adjacent to the land of Thomas Jones which lay along Powell’s Creek. This is in Bermuda Hundred. In 1669 Thomas Jones stood as a juror holding an inquisition into the death of Mary Pope, a servant girl. In January 1662/63, Thomas Jones declared for nine persons including William Flowers and obtained 420 acres in Henrico County on the south side of the James River and on the back of Bermuda Hundred between the land of Arundle and the land of one Clerke (Richard Jones, Clerke ?), and Eppes Hundred, where a Creek called Powell’s Creek divided them at the mouth.\n\nThomas Jones, II married Mary Repps and died before 1674. They were the parents of Elizabeth Jones who married Philip Turpin; Martha Jones who married first John Branch then Thomas Osborne; Repps Jones; and Thomas Jones, III.\n\nMary married Edward Skerme in 1680 in Henrico County. We Mary Skerm of Bermooda Hundred, Henrico Co., and Thomas Jones, my son, agree to peacably occupy land which was my husband’s, Thos. Jones, dec’d, bounded by the river and the high road, called The Hundred Path, equally. Mary Skerme to hold the part joining the creek toward Wm Ligon, and Thomas Jones, the part joining the swamp, next to Edward Stratton 9 Aug. 1684. In April, 1685 in Henrico, Mary Skerme, late widow of Thomas Jones, gives to her son Thomas, the land which he gave his brother Repps Jones near Bermuda Hundred adjacent Edward Stratton, near the swamp. Edward Skerme, evidently a son, married in 1699, Priscilla, a daughter of John Branch in Henrico.\n\nRepps Jones’ will was filed in Henrico County in 1689. Repps Jones died in 1689, unmarried. The will of Repps Jones of Henrico County, Planter gave to Philip Turpin and his wife land purchased from his brother Thomas Jones during their lives and after their decease to his cousin (nephew) Thomas Jones, unless Thomas died without a son. Then the land went to Edward Skerme. To his sister Mary Skerme, Repps left a mare foal and a heifer. To Edward Skerme he left a saddle stitched with silk. To his sister Martha Osborne he left 20 shillings to buy a ring. His mother received the residue of the estate. The witnesses were Martha Stratton and Edward Haskins.\n\nThomas Jones, III married Martha Tanner the daughter of Joseph Tanner and Mary Shippey. Thomas died in 1689, and his will notes his son Thomas Jones, not yet 16, who received the land in Bermuda Hundred called The Granary, cattle, and other items. His wife Martha received her dower of 1/3 of the estate. Their daughter Lucretia received cows and calf at the age of 16. The witnesses were Thomas Jefferson, Repps Jones, and Edward Skerme. It was written in January 1688/89. His brother Repps wrote his will a few weeks later. Both were probated in August 1689.\n\nMartha Tanner Jones married secondly, Edward Haskins, in 1686. A Henrico deed in 1701 from Edward Haskins and Martha, his wife, one of the daughters of Joseph Tanner, deceased gives 150 acres of Hell Garden Spring Bottom adjacent Kennon to Edward Haskins, Jr. Earlier, in 1694, Martha Haskins and Mary Ligon conveyed a tract of land bequeathed to them by their father Joseph Tanner, deceased on the south side of the James River on Hell Garden Bottom Run adjacent Mr. Richard Kennon which was witnessed by Thomas Ligon and Mary Platt. Mary Ligon was the sister of Martha Tanner Jones Haskins, and the wife of William Ligon.\n\nThomas and Martha Jones’ daughter Lucretia married Henry Childers, son of Abraham Childers and Anne Pew. Their son, Thomas Jones, removed to Surry County where he married Mary Mitchell.\n\nHis descendents removed to Brunswick and Lunenburg Counties. A later member of this family was likely Repp Jones, surveyor of Lunenburg, whose son Drury Jones married Sarah Lanier, daughter of John Lanier and Elizabeth Bird.\n\nIn 1715, in Henrico, Thomas Jones’ Petitioner, to take up Five Thousand acres of land in Henrico County within the following bounds viz; Beginning at the mouth of Fighting Creek on the North Side of Appomattock River, down the said River to Jeneto Creek, taking in the said Creek, running Northly to John Prides & John Towns’ Lines, taking in the heads of Butterwoods and Swifts Creeks to a place knowne by the name of Tabers path, running Westerly along the said Path to the Head of Fighting Creek, and down the said Creek to the place begun, including all the Kings Land within those Bounds.\n\nIn April, 1715 Thomas Jones of Surry County deeded to John Bolling 320 acres back of Bermuda Hundred, 220 acres that were patented by Thomas Jones, grandfather of Thomas on May 17, 1663, and 100 acres given by his father Thomas Jones in August, 1684 to Repps Jones. In 1700 in Henrico County Thomas Jones, one of the orphans of Thomas Jones, late of Henrico County, deceased, announced he was in full possession of his late father’s estate and discharged Edward Haskins his late guardian, as he was now 21 years old. Then, in 1723, the land of Thomas Jones was noted adjacent to land patented by Robert Michel on the north side of Nottaway River, east of Hardwood Swamp, in Surry County. In 1733, Thomas Jones of Surry County patented 1,020 acres in Surry County on the north side of the Nottoway River east of Hardwood Swamp, along the line of Colonel Benjamin Harrison and east to John Michel’s line to Duckinghole Branch, to the line of Peter Michel’s to 370 acres formerly granted to Thomas Jones by patent in March, 1715.\n\n~\n\nAtt a Court holden att Varina for the County of Henrico the second day of June Anno Dom 1679…An account of ye several fortye tythables ordered by this Wor’ll Court to fitt out men horse armes &c according to act, viz:\n\nAt Curls\n\nMr. Essex Bevill is ordered to give notice to these.\n\nColl Wm. Byrd 20 Wm Dany 2\n\nMr. John Goode 4\n\nEdwd Jones 2\n\nEdwd Deely 2\n\nHenry Preutt (Prewitt) 1\n\nWm. Blackman 2\n\nGilbert Jones 1\n\nHenry Serman, Sen.1\n\nRichard Pierce 1\n\nMr. Richd Ward Sen 5\n\nGilbert Jones\n\nGilbert Jones was listed among 60 person transported by John Beauchamp and Richard Cocke, Sr. in a patent in 1664 for 2, 994 acres partly in Henrico County. In 1677 Gilbert Jones helped Henry Watkins survey Mawburne Hills (Malvern) with Richard Cocke, and Colonel Ligon. Gilbert age 36 testified that he carried the chain during the survey, which places Gilbert’s birth in 1642. He married Joane about 1650 according to a deposition given in 1680. Robert Jones, born about 1643, was included in the same series of depositions.\n\nGilbert Jones was listed in Henrico County tithes in 1679 for one tithe indicating no male adult children or servants resided with him. Gilbert died in Henrico County in 1685. In 1686, Richard and Thomas Perrin certified their appraisal of the inventory of the estate of Gilbert Jones. His underage sons Richard, Robert and James were listed in his will. Henry Prewitt and John Field witnessed the will. The executors were William Blackman and William Giles. Robert Jones was placed under the guardianship of William Blackman. In 1692 Robert Jones petitioned to receive three cattle from his father’s estate.\n\nCom. Henrici pr: o die 1692: …Capt Will Farrar being by ye Last Court Appointed to see ye delry of Cattle belonging to Robt Jones an Orph late in ye Wardship of Will Blackman wch were give unto ye said Orph per Rob’t Mayfield dec’d doth Return Acc’t That ye sd Order is performed & that ye said Jones hath received in full one Cow, one Calf & one Bull.\n\nRobert Jones was due cattle from the estate of Robert Mayfield who died in 1692. In Essex County are records of litigation involving a Robert Jones and the Mayfield family during the 1720’s. (See Cadwallader Jones and James Jones of Lancaster for possible connections.) In 1684 the land of Robert Mayfield was noted on the south side of the Rappahannock River in the area that was then Rappahannock County.\n\nRobert Jones died in Henrico County in 1720. His wife Mary stated that her husband left a will and the only witness that was still alive was John Cocke. Mary married Richard Ward, son-in-law of William Blackman. Richard Ward had first married Martha Branch, then Elizabeth Blackman, and upon her death, Mary, widow of Robert Jones. (Wynne Family)\n\nEdward Jones\n\nIn 1637 Elizabeth Packer, widow, patented 950 acres in Henrico County, west of the land of Seth Ward, due her late husband Thomas Packer, and Sgt. William Sharpe for the transport of 19 persons, which included Edward Jones, Lewis Jones, William Cooke, John Ward, and others.\n\nEdward Jones married the widow Alicia Lunn in 1679 and had son Edward Jr., daughter Alicia, and others who married there. His second wife was Mary Field, sister to John and Thomas Field. Their daughter, Tabitha, married John Robertson, of Cumberland County, Virginia. In 1688 Edward Jones administered the estate of Thomas Fields.\n\nIn 1681 in Surry a judgment was entered against Edward Jones for payment to the estate of William Thompson for work done for Jones. Edward Jones was noted for 2 tithes in the 1679 Henrico County tithe list, indicating he either had a son or servant who was of age.\n\nHenry Prewitt is believed to have married Ann Fields, sister to John Field. In 1681 Henry Prewitt testified in a suit against Hugh Jones filed by Edward Jones in Varina Parish, Henrico County. In 1691, Henry Prewitt, then age 37, testified that Hugh Jones demanded John Low put his gun in the loft of Edward Jones as security for corn that Low had purchased from Hugh Jones. Later that year, Henry also testified for Edward Jones in a suit against Frances Reeves. He stated he saw a black bull which bore Thomas Field’s mark and belonged to Edward Jones floating on the river adjacent Mr. Reeves land.\n\nThe estate of Edward Jones was administered by Henry Prewitt in 1695 and in 1697, Henry Prewitt sold Mary Jones, Edward Sr.’s widow, 220 acres which was part of the 440 aces he had patented with Edward Jones, This land was adjacent to John Higledy, and on the north side of the James River, adjacent to Thomas Field’s Creek. Thomas was a brother to John and Mary. It is noted that Edward Jones held 4 spinning wheels in his inventory, likely indicating he was manufacturing cloth.\n\nHugh Jones of Half Sink\n\nHugh Jones and Edward Jones sued each other in 1681 in Varina Parish, Henrico County. Henry Prewitt testified against Hugh Jones. The same Henry Prewitt and John Field witnessed the will of Gilbert Jones of Henrico County in February 2, 1685. In 1690 in Henrico it is recorded that Hugh Jones required that John Low allow Edward Jones to hold his gun as security for the payment due on corn Low had purchased from Hugh Jones. Only Hugh Jones and Philip Jones were noted in the 1704 Quit Rents for Henrico County. The will of Hugh Jones was filed in 1705 in Henrico County and was witnessed by Henry Prewitt. It noted his wife Mary, who received 500 acres of land at Half Sink, and left his tract of land where he lived to William Britton and to John Britton. William and John were the sons of John Britton, Sr. Hugh left no heirs.\n\nPhilip Jones of Swift Creek and Wintopock\n\nPhilip Jones was born around 1661. He testified in Henrico County concerning a horse race in October, 1678.\n\nPhilip Jones, aged 17 years or thereabouts, Deposeth: That this summer this deponent was at ye Hundred and saw Abraham Womecke and Rich’d Ligon there, and afterwards say Mr. Chamberlaine’s boy upon Abraham Womack’s horse, and Thos: Cocke upon another horse, and ye s’d Cocke told ye other boy that if he did not come n at a word he would leave him behinde, and ye said boy answered him againe that if he did not at a word he would leave him, they being then at ye starting place, or going to ye starting place (which the deponent cannot certainly tell) to run a race, there being a man ordered to start them, who gave a word, at which Mr. Chamberlayne’s went, and Tho: Cocke sayed it was not a faire start.\n\nAnd further sayth not, Philip Jones.\n\nPhilip Jones married Margaret (Jones) October 12, 1684, in Henrico County. Philip Jones sold 200 acres in 1687 to Peter Rowlett, Sr.\n\nPhilip Jones of Bristol Parish, Henrico Co. states that Bartholomew Chandler his late uncle, died seized of a tract on Swift Creek and Old Town Creek, which lapsed to his majesty for want`of heirs. I, now by consent of my aunt, mrs. chandler, widow and relict, and now wife of Mr. John Piggott, have escheated the tract. Now for 2200 lbs tobacco, sell to Peter Rowlett, 200 acres of the said land, bounded by the mouth of a great`branch of Old Town Creek, 1 Aug. 1687.\n\nThe 200 acres purchased by Peter Rowlett, Sr. was located in what became Chesterfield County on Old Town Creek in Henrico County.\n\nIn 1655 Peter Rowlett went to court against Daniel Llewellyn who had employed Peter to be an overseer in his fields, for a share of the crop. Peter and Daniel disagreed about the length of Peter’s employment period and the amount he was due. The judges told Peter to work for 18 more days, and Peter to be paid 5 bushels and 1 peck of wheat which was due for threshing.\n\nPeter Rowlett, Sr. was the father of William Rowlett who married Frances Worsham and Peter Rowlett, Jr. who married Mary Ligon, daughter of William Ligon of Curles Neck, and the widow of William Anderson. Peter Rowlett, Jr. purchased 189 acres on the Great Branch of Old Town Creek from Philip Jones in 1709.\n\nLater, Peter, son of William Rowlett and Frances Worsham, would marry Elizabeth Jones, whose parentage is not identified. They lived on Beaver Pond Branch in Prince George, later Amelia County, and moved to Lunenburg about 1747 where Peter died in 1754. Philip Jones witnessed the will, and it is likely he was the brother of Elizabeth. Peter Rowlett and Elizabeth Jones were the parents of William, Philip and John Rowlett.\n\nIn 1688 Philip Jones of Bristol Parish in Henrico, sold to William Chambers a parcel granted to Philip by his late uncle Chandler. Philip’s wife Margaret, renounced her dower right. In 1691 Philip Jones was tithed for 189 acres. He would soon acquire more. The following year he was tithed for 1,238 Acres.\n\nIn 1701, Philip Jones and Robert Hudson were the security of Elizabeth Hudson, widow of Robert’s brother William Hudson. On March 14, 1701 Philip Jones and his wife Margaret sold 50 acres to Seth Perkinson, which adjoined John Perkinson.\n\nPhilip with Francis Eppes, Isham Eppes, Francis Eppes Jr., Elizabeth Kennon, Martha Stratton, George Archer, and John Hill patented 4000 acres north of the Appomattock River and along Wintopock Creek on April 24, 1703.\n\nWhereas Now know ye that I the said Francis Nicholson Esq. /Governor &c do with he advice & Consent of the Councill of State accordingly give & / grant unto Captn: Francis Epes Mr. Isham Epes Mr. Frances Epes Junior Mr. George / Robinson Minister and Mrs. Elizabeth Kennon & Mr. Philip Jones & Mrs. Martha / Stratton & Mr. Geo Archer & Mr. James Hill a tract of Land containing four / thousand acres lying and being in the County of Henrico on the North side of / Appomattock river beginning at two Corner [ ] on the said river below the mouth / of Wintopock main Creek and runeth thence into the Woods North West and / by North two hundred thirty two poles to a Corner pine thence North by East / Seventy six poles to a Corner black Oake thence North by West forty poles to a / Corner black Oake thence West and by North one hundred & fourty poles to a / Corner gum thence North-North West Eighty six poles to Corner black Oake West South West / twenty two poles to a Corner pine thence West fourty eight poles to a Corner / white Oake thence North thirty two poles to a black Oake thence North West / Seventy two poles to a Corner white Oake thence North by West ninety four / poles to a Corner hiccory thence North by East fifty two poles to a Corner black Oake thence North East fourty eight poles to a Corner hiccory thence / North two hundred twenty eight poles crossing the Northerne branch of Wintopock to a Corner black Oake thence North East by North fifty poles / to a Corner black Oake thence North thirty four poles to a Corner white Oake / thence West North West one hundred thirty five poles crossing the middle / branch to a Corner gum thence North West Seventeen poles to a Corner pine / thence North North East Seventy poles to a Corner white Oake thence / North West by North one hundred twelve poles to a Corner hiccory thence / West ninety poles to a Corner white Oake thence North West fifty six / poles to a Corner maple standing upon Wintopock main Creek thence / down the main Creek according to the meanders thereof to a Corner white / Oake standing on the South side of the said Creek thence South west and by / South thirty eight poles to a Corner white Oake thence South & by West one / hundred & ninety poles to a Corner pine thence South West and by West sixty / four poles to a Corner black Oake thence South South East Eighty one poles to a / Corner hiccory thence South by West fourty six poles to a Corner black Oake / South by East Seventy four poles to a Corner black Oake thence South / one hundred Sixty six poles to a Corner black Oake thence South West fourty / poles to a Corner black Oake & South East twenty eight poles to a Corner butter wood Corner on a small branch thence down that branch to Appomattock river thance down ye said river according to the meanders thereof to ye / place it began including the aforesaid four thousand acres of Land the / Land being due unto the Sd Cap:in Francis Epes Mr Isham Epes Mr Francis / Epes Junor Mr Geo Robinson Minister & Mrs Elizabeth Kennon & Mr Phill: / Jones & Mrs. Martha Stratton and Mr. George Archer and Mr. James Hill by and / for the transportation of Eighty persons into this Colony whose names are / to be in the records mentioned under this patent To have & to hold &c To be / held &c Yielding & paying &c Provided &c\n\nGiven under my hand & the Seale / of the Colony this 24: th day of Aprill anno Dom 1703 —\n\nExd Cap: in Francis Epes &c their patent for 4000……….\n\nG Fr: Nicholson acres of Land in Henrico County —\n\nBlessing &c\n\nIncluded in the list of those transported are familiar names: William Osborn, William Cooke, Samuel Cooke, Dorothy Brown, Mathew Jones, Fra Jones, John Brown, and Thomas Taylor.\n\nEarly landowners along Wintopock Creek (Winterpock) landowners included Samuel Goode, and William Rowlett.\n\nPhilip Jones was tithed in 1704 Quit Rents in Henrico County. In 1706 the land of Philip Jones was noted in a will filed in Henrico County. It was along Swift Creek, next to Major Field, Mr. Francis Eppes, and John Wilson. For 1000 lbs. of tobacco, Philip Jones sold to Seth Perkinson, 50 acres on the north side of Old Town Creek in 1708.\n\nIn 1716 on June 3 it is noted that Philip Jones of Henrico deeded a tract of 100 acres on the north side of the Appomattox River at Wintopock for ₤ 30 to his son-in-law Samuel Goode and Martha Goode, his daughter. The witnesses were Francis Eppes, Jr, Walter Scott, and John Folckes. It is a Goode family tradition that Martha’s family had first settled on the Eastern Shore before coming to Henrico County. It is also a tradition that Martha’s father was killed by Indians, who attacked the family in their home.\n\nThe land of Philip Jones was noted in 1725 in a deed to Francis Worsham and Thomas Tanner, for 300 acres on the north side Appomattox River and the north side John Ealam’s (Elam) path adjoining Mr. Philip Jones, Francis Eppes, Walter Scott, Williamson’s path.\n\nIn 1743 a deed in Henrico County from Philip Worsham of Dale Parish, Henrico to John Elam, Jr. of Henrico for ₤60, 120 acres at Wintopock, bounded by Philip Jones and James Hill. Then in 1744, Philip Jones and Richard Jones, of Dale Parish, Henrico for ₤5, to John Ealam, the younger, 544 acres bounded by Wintopock Creek, John Ealam (sic) the elder, Richard Eppes and James Robins.\n\nIn 1754 Peter Jones witnessed the will of Peter Rowlett.\n\nMartha Jones, daughter of Philip Jones married Samuel Goode about 1667 in Henrico. He was the eldest son of John Goode of Whitley from Cornwall. Samuel Goode’s mother was Francis Mackarness, daughter of William Mackarness of Barbados, who went from Scotland to the West Indies about 1625-40. Samuel was born in Barbados, 1655-58. John Goode’s second wife was Anne Bennett, and they had thirteen children. John Goode owned 688 acres in Henrico and 2,270 acres in Chesterfield County. Ann Bennett was the daughter of Richard Bennett. John and Ann Goode’s children were: Robert Goode who married the widow Elizabeth Curd daughter of Thomas Branch and Elizabeth Archer; Katherine Goode who married John Roberts and then Gilbert Gee; Elizabeth Goode who married about 1699 John Blackman, Sr. son of William Blackman and Dorothy Deeley; John Goode, who married Mary Harris daughter of Thomas Harris and Mary Field Jefferson (John Goode owned Falls Plantation and was killed by Indians); Thomas Goode; Frances Goode who married John Elam and then William Harris, Sr.; Susanna Goode; Joseph Goode; Anna Goode; Ursula Goode who married Samuel Branch son of Christopher then she married Walter Scott, then John Harris in 1729.\n\nPhilip Jones, Jr. was granted 200 acres in Prince George County on the upper side of Flatt Creek below the upper Tomahawk Branch in 1734/5. In 1735 a deed to John Elam in Amelia County notes the land of Philip Jones on Flatt Creek. In 1745 the land of John Elam (Ealam) and Philip Jones was noted in a Henrico County deed. John Elam was granted 200 acres in Amelia County on the lower side of Flatt Creek, on both sides of Tomahawk Branch, opposite Philip Jones, and he did not seat this land, so it was given to James Mitchell in 1747. Philip Jones, Jr. went on to Charlotte County.\n\nFrancis Jones was granted 200 acres on the north side of Swift Creek from the corner of Peter Asbrook and Jones, adjacent John Towns, north to John Bowmans land and Captain Boilings (Bolling) in 1733, and a year later he was granted 400 acres on the north side of Swift Creek from John Farmer’s line on the west side of a Great Branch of Swift Creek along Edward Bowman’s line to John Bowman’s across the main road, to the side of a branch of Parishes’ Run.\n\nDaniel Jones purchased 500 acres in Henrico County on Winterpock Branch, from Richard Gulls in July, 1715. He was the father of Thomas Jones and he held land on Winterpock Swamp which Thomas sold in April, 1733. The deed states that Thomas Jones for the sum of 15 pound current money of Virginia, sold to John Reade, a tract of land containing 500 acres which Daniel Jones, father of the said Thomas Jones purchased of Richard Grills, adjoining the land whereon the said Reade lived. The witnesses were John Hancock and William Ferguson. Two years later, Thomas Stratton, Lodowick Elam, and John Allfriend witnessed a deed for land John Reade purchased from John Grills which was in Henrico, and lay on Winterpock Swamp. That same year Martha Good sold 300 acres to John Reade on Middle Creek which belonged to Samuel Goode, her late husband.. In 1735, Thomas Jones of Amelia County conveyed to Samuel Hancock of Henrico County 400 acres of land which had originally belonged to Richard Gulls, and had been conveyed to Thomas Jones by his father Daniel Jones. His wife Sara relinquished her dower rights.\n\nIn 1735, Thomas Jones, Jr. was granted 200 acres on the branches of the South Fork of Flatt Creek, in what was Amelia County. Then in 1740, the land of Thomas Jones was noted on Flatt Creek in Amelia County. In 1746 Edward Jones was granted 654 acres on both sides of Flatt Creek.\n\nIn 1742 Thomas Tanner was granted 300 acres on both sides of Flatt Creek in Amelia County. Judith Tanner, born in Bristol Parish, Prince George, and daughter to Thomas and granddaughter of Joseph Tanner and Sarah Hatcher, married John Jones. In 1753 Thomas Jones purchased a 200 acre tract on Wintopock Creek adjoining William Roberson, James Cashon, Benjamin Cheatham, and Thomas Mann. This was witnessed by John Elam, Robert Furguson, and William Riggins. In 1759 Daniel and Thomas Jones with John Elam witnessed the will of James Cashon.\n\nRichard Jones in March 17, 1736 a deed was filed in Prince George County for 145 acres on the upper side of Flatt Creek to Richard Jones, brother of Philip Jones of Henrico County. For the sum of fifteen shillings, beginning at his brother, Philip Jones, lower corner on the said creek, adjacent Hall Creek. In 1744 Philip Jones of Henrico and Richard Jones deeded to John Ealam (sic) the younger, 544 acres on Winterpock Creek in the presence of John Hill, Leonard Cheatham, and Alexander Elam. In 1750, the land of Philip Jones was noted along Flatt Creek in Amelia County. Richard Jones witnessed a deed in 1750 for land on Flatt Creek in Amelia County.\n\nPeter Jones of Henrico\n\nRichard Jones of Ley in Devonshire, England\n\nAccording to Cadwallader Jones, A Genealogical History, Richard Jones was Welsh and married Lady Jeffreys, of the Manor of Ley in Devonshire, England. Richard Jones, a merchant in London, married Lady Jane Jeffreys and was the brother-in-law of Alderman Jeffreys, grocer of London. However, the Jeffreys did not control the Manor of Ley. Richard and Cadwallader Jones were the sons of Cadwallader Jones, a wealthy merchant adventurer and his wife, Lady Ann Blewett. Cadwallader Sr. died deeply in debt.\n\nRichard and Jane were the parents of Cadwallader, Peter, Richard, William, and Abraham Jones of Virginia and possibly Frederick who remained in England. Cadwallader Jones the younger is covered below.\n\nEarly Jones Immigrants\n\nThe first record for Richard Jones is Virginia is in 1623, when he was counted among the living at Flowerdieu Hundred. His age was given as 22 years. Richard Jones was counted among the dead in 1624.\n\nPeter Jones, age 24, and William Jones, age 23, were noted at Peirsey’s Hundred, earlier Flowerdieu Hundred, in 1625 as servants in the household of Abraham Peirsey. The Peter and William Jones, noted in Flowerdieu Hundred were older than Abraham Wood, who was 15 at the time they came to Virginia. This is not the Peter Jones who later was Major Peter Jones under Abraham Wood and his son-in-law.\n\nAlso at Flowerdieu Hundred was Elizabeth Jones who died sometime in 1624 and Anthony Jones, a servant in the Yeardly household.\n\nFlowerdieu Hundred in 1624 included twelve dwellings, three storehouse, four tobacco houses, and a windmill. Abraham Peirsey married Frances West, widow of Nathaniel West and died in 1627. Peirsey’s widow later married Col. Samuel Mathews.\n\nCaptain Samuel Mathews, Esquire was credited with several Jones headrights, no county being noted.\n\n1642 Jon. Jones by Capt. Samuel Mathews, Esq.\n\n1642 Thomas Jones by Capt. Samuel Mathews, Esq.\n\n1642 Henry Jones by Capt. Samuell Mathews, Esq.\n\n1642 Howell Jones by Capt. Samuel Mathews, Esq.\n\n1643 James Jones by Capt. Samuel Mathews, Esquire\n\nIn 1635 Abraham Peirsey’s heirs sold Peirsey’s Hundred to William Barker, mariner, who sold it to Captain John Taylor, of Prince George County. It passed from Taylor’s daughters to Joseph Poythress.\n\nCadwallader Jones, of Rock Hill, North Carolina in A Genealogical History, on page 73 stated: There were in Virginia two Jones families, both of Welsh extraction and related in the old country -one known as the Robert Jones and the other as the Peter or Cadwallader Jones family who came to Virginia with two brothers.\n\nA family history as given in a letter written October 26, 1888 by Mrs. K. Jones of Blackstone, Virginia relaying information given to her by her aunt Mrs. James Jones:\n\nThree brothers – Peter, William and Richard came from Wales to this country: Peter settled in Dinwiddie County and founded Petersburg. William settled on Indian trail, later called Namozine Rd. near Dennisville. He died unmarried and without children. Richard settled in Nottoway one mile east of the courthouse. There is a burial ground still there. (Notes on Southside Virginia by Walter A. Watson, Bulletin of the Virginia State Library Vol. XV, No. 2-4, 9/1925) (Much of the information on the descendents of Peter Jones and Captain Richard Jones are from the book by Augusta B. Fothergill, Peter Jones and Richard Jones Genealogies:1924.)\n\nNottoway was created from Amelia County in 1788 and Dennisville is located in Amelia County. This rendition appears to relate to the sons of Peter Jones and Margaret, not the initial immigrants. Peter Jones was likely transported to Virginia in 1638 along with William Jones by Abraham Wood.\n\nAbraham Wood\n\nOccasionally a common man leaps from the pages of historical records, whose life embodies all the romance and spirit which we think of when we consider our fearless pioneer ancestors. Abraham Wood is such a character.\n\nAbraham arrived in Virginia in 1620 as a ten year old boy. His passage had been paid by Thomas Osborne. Thomas Osborne arrived in Virginia aboard the Bona Venture in 1619. He soon settled in Henrico County, in the College Land. In March 1622, the attacks by the natives resulted in the deaths of about one third of the English settlers. Captain Thomas Osborne led an attack against the Indians. He was granted Coxendale and settled there in 1625. This eventually was in Chesterfield County.\n\nIt is said that on the voyage Abraham Wood’s ship, the Margaret and John, commanded by Captain Anthony Chester, was attacked by Spanish ships. Five years later Abraham was the servant of Captain Samuel Matthews at Jamestown. He lived through all that transpired during that time, the war, disease, and discontent. He was still in James City in 1632. In 1639 Abraham Wood, who had been leasing 100 acres on Kennecock Creek, which was part of Dale’s plantation, patented 200 acres. This patent was for the transport of John Evans, John Greene, Robert Taylor, and Jacob Norris. They were all likely servants of Wood and involved in the Indian trade and exploratory adventures he conducted. In 1638 Abraham Wood was granted 400 acres in Charles City County, on the Appamattox River adjoining the lands of John Baker, Joseph Brown, and the Main River. This land was in Peirsey’s Toile which became Peirsey’s Hundred, previously Flowerdieu Hundred. Included among his headrights were William and Peter Jones. It is this Peter Jones who became Captain Peter Jones under General Wood. He held 700 acres by 1642. Eventually thousands of acres would fall under Abraham’s control.\n\nIn 1644 the outposts south of the James River were attacked by the Opechancanough. In response Sir William Berkeley set up Fort Royal on the Pamunkey, Fort James on the Chickahominy Ridge, and Fort Henry at the falls of the Appomattox. Captain Fleet, who had in his youth been held for four years among the Indians, and had worked with Claiborne in the trade along the Chesapeake, was given the task of negotiating a peace. Fleet negotiated that trading in the south would be done at Ft. Henry on the Appomattox or at the home of Captain John Flood, who lived on the other side of the river. Captain Abraham Wood was placed in charge of the Southern defense at Fort Henry.\n\nAbraham Wood explored the mountains and countryside of ancient Henrico County. He led and later sponsored exploration west and south. In 1650, Edward Bland, merchant, Abraham Wood, and their associates went on an exploratory journey to the south to the Sapony and the Staunton. He traded with the natives, and fought them successfully during the times of hostile assaults on settlements. He served as a Major General and commander of the militia at Fort Henry, which was built on his land on Flea Island and which he maintained. He was an intimate of the other founders of Virginia, including William Byrd. He served both Henrico and Charles City Counties as Justice and in the House of Burgesses. In 1707 Wood’s Church was built in his honor.\n\nAt the turn of the century, along with William Byrd II, John and Robert Bolling, the primary investors in trade with the Indians lying south along the Occaneechee Path into the Carolinas were John Evans, Robert Mumford and Peter, Thomas, and Richard Jones. Thirty years after Abraham Wood’s death a 1710 list of licensed Indian traders included: William Pettypool, with Thomas Edward and Henry Tally, partners; Captain Richard Jones with David Crawly, and Captain John Evans who married Sarah Batte; Colonel Robert Munford who married Elizabeth Kennon, Captain Richard Jones, Nathaniel Evans, William Bannisters, and George and Richard Smith. Evans, Smith and Pettypool traded into Carolina. William Pettypool, John Evans and Richard Smith took out trading licenses in the Colony of Carolina. In 1711 Richard Jones, John Evans, David Crawley, William Pettypool, Thomas Edwards, Henry Tally, Nathan Evans, and Robert Hix from Woods’ Settlement gave a bond for trade in Carolina.\n\nRobert Hix, the Tailor and his son, the Indian Trader\n\nRobert was the son of Robert Hix transported in 1654 by Hugh Lee. A deed in 1701 to John Poythress notes that his neighbor was Robert Hix, Sr., the taylor, who purchased land from Hugh Lee. (See Hugh Lee) He may have been the father of Robert, the trader, and John, Thomas, and Henry Hicks. In 1693, Robert Hicks was arrested for appearing in the Charles City court in a state of drunkenness. 200 acres were sold to Robert Hix by John Fitzgerald in February, 1693, and then 600 acres was granted to Robert in April, 1694.\n\nBy 1690, Robert Hix married Winifred the daughter of John Evans. Evans gave them two tracts totaling 1,670 acres which lay between the Appomattox and the Blackwater Creek. The first was 560 acres in 1690, which adjoined General Wood’s land. Then his father-in-law 1,120 acres on the south side of the Appomattox. Robert then claimed 600 acres for transporting twelve people. Robert Hix (Hicks) was included in the trading partnership of Jones, Crawly and Evans in 1714.\n\n60 acres were conveyed to Robert Hix by Peter Jones, Jr. in, 1708, and recorded in Prince George County. 260 acres were sold to Robert Hix by Joshua Irby and Elizabeth, his wife in 1708 and recorded in Prince George.\n\nIn 1714 he was the Captain of Fort Christiana, which was located in the area that became Brunswick County. He assisted in the survey of the dividing line between Virginia and North Carolina. His homestead became known as Hick’s Ford and was located at today’s town site of Emporia.\n\nIn 1724 Robert Hix, who may have been the third of that name, patented 140 acres on the north side of the Myery Branch in Surry County. In 1730, Robert Hix patented 2,610 acres on the north side of Meherrin River, adjoining Henry Wyches and extending by the side of the Myery Branch at the mouth of the meadow. In March, 1726 Robert Hix of Lawns Creek Parrish of the County of Surry, sold to John Fitzgerald of Bristol Parish, County of Prince George, 1,120 acres on South side of Appomattox River in Bristol Parish. Robert Hix, and Frances Hix, his wife, appeared and relinquished her right of dower. (1713-1728, page 968, Prince George County, Virginia.) This appears to be the land originally purchased from Fitzgerald. It was near Hopewell.\n\nRobert Hix was the father of 13 children: Daniel, Robert, Jr., George, John, Mary, Tabitha, James, William Francis, Rachael, Charles, Martha who married a Beddingfield and Elizabeth who married a Lanier. George and John Hicks settled in Old Cheraws, South Carolina. This was done in part to improve his ability to continue trading with tribes in the area after the South Carolina government sought to restrict Virginian’s access to the fur trade within the South Carolina colony. Robert’s main trade was with the Cherokee, and some of his family married Cherokee of Georgia. It is unclear if he is also the Robert Hix who married Ruth Ragsdale May 18th, 1701/2 in Henrico County.\n\nHis will was filed in Brunswick in February, 1740 and notes his son Charles, who received 650 acres at the Indian Fort adjacent to Nathaniel Edwards and 150 acres in the for of Reeves. James received the home plantation after his wife died and the remainder of the 2,610 acre patent. George received a tract adjacent to his land. His son-in-law, Richard Ransom, received 150 acres lying in the Fork of Reeves. Benjamin Hicks, the son of Daniel who was deceased, received 150 acres in the fork of Reeves. He noted his daughters Martha Beddingfield, Frances Ransom, Elizabeth Hicks, Rachel Hicks, Mary hicks, and Tabitha Hicks. His grandson, John Beddingfield, received Robert’s interest in the Mill on Genito’s Creek. His wife, Frances was the executrix and the witnesses were Ann Poythress, Charles Rose, and John Chapman.\n\n~\n\nIn 1655 Peter Jones and Henry Randolph witnessed an agreement made by Major Abraham Wood.\n\nIn 1671, Thomas Batte, Thomas Woods, and Robert Fallam were commissioned by Major General Wood to attempt to discover the South Sea, led by Perecute, a leader of the Appomattock Indians, and Jack Wesson, a former servant of General Wood. Thomas Woods and his horse died on the journey, and they were unsuccessful in following the Ohio to the Mississippi and on to the Gulf, but they were the first to cross the Allegheny Mountains.\n\nIn 1676 Abraham was too ill to participate in negotiations with the Indians whose hostilities had led to the infamous Bacon’s Rebellion. That year Major Peter Jones commanded 57 men from Elizabeth City, Warwick, and James City counties at Fort Henry. However, by 1678, at Jamestown, Abraham met with the chief men of the nations and successfully negotiated a treaty. Abraham Wood died in 1682. His will is badly damaged, but what can be read includes references to his grandchildren in law Peter, Abraham, Richard, and William Jones. These were the children of Peter Jones.\n\nIn the name of God amen, I, Abraham Wood in the county of Charles city in Virginia, being weary and weak in spirit, but in good and perfect memory, thanks be to God, make & ordain this my last will and testament in manner & form following … soul to God etc… my body to be buried in the night by my wife…\n\nItem: I give and bequeath to my daughter Mary Chamberlaine my silver tobacco box & my plantation with all thereupon belonging to be known by the name Fleetes’ in Henrico County & also three hundred acres of land lying and being upon the uttermost line of a patent granted to me bearing date the tenth of July, one thousand six hundred and eighty, which land is known by the name of Ronhorak,(Rohowick) to her & her heirs forever….\n\nItem: I give and bequeath unto my grandchildren in law (viz) Abraham Jones, Richard Jones, Peter Jones & William Jones all my lands, housing, orchards and tenements lying and being in Charles City County… to them and their heirs forever, equally to be divided & they to make theirs according to their seniority (excepting what is already bequeathed to my daughter Mary Chamberlaine) & one hundred acres which I\n\ngive unto my godson Abraham Alley lying and being the easterly line of my dividend to him the said Abraham Alley & his brother Henry Alley equally to be divided, to them and their heirs forever. And what person or persons whatsoever by any claim of right [torn] shall disturb or molest the said Abraham Jones, Richard J[ones], Peter Jones & William\n\nJones or either of them, their or either [torn] heirs in the peaceable and quiet enjoyment thereof that [torn] or she or whatsoever they be, to pay unto Abraham Jone[s, Richard] Jones, Peter Jones & William Jones or their heirs the… ”\n\nEvidently a bequest was also made to Amy, who was Amy Bevill, widow of Essex, who received a mare. She later made a gift of …mare foal of a mare left me by Maj. Gen. Wood dec'd…\n\nIt is unknown who Abraham Wood married. We do know who it wasn’t. It was not the daughter of Daniel Llewellyn. If Margaret Llewellyn was married to James Cruse, who was executed in 1676 for his part in Bacon’s Rebellion, she died before Cruse, and left no children. Cruse was engaged in trade with the Indians, colonists, and London. His will provides the proof that he did not have a living wife or children. The settlement of his estate a few years later notes that James Cruse did not leave a legal wife or orphan. In his will, James Cruse did leave his suit of clothing to Margaret Llewellyn’s nephew, the son of her half-brother Daniel Price, which suggests they were once married.\n\nWhat we do know is Abraham Wood had a daughter, Mary who married Thomas Chamberlaine. He also held the children of Peter Jones in tender regard, as they inherited a large estate from him. Peter’s wife was Margaret, who was likely Abraham’s step-daughter. In her will, Margaret clearly notes her son Abraham Jones, deceased, and son Peter Jones and their children.\n\nMary Wood daughter of Abraham Wood\n\nMary Wood was married to Major Thomas Chamberlaine from Gloucester, England by 1675 when Abraham Wood assigned his Kennecock land to Thomas Chamberlaine his son-in-law. Thomas was the son of Edmund Chamberlaine of Maugersbury (d. 1676) and grandson of the sheriff of Gloucestershire, Edmund Chamberlaine, Esquire the son of Sir Thomas Chamberlaine, of Prestbury, Gloucestershire, and ambassador from the period of Henry VIII through Elizabeth I.\n\nIn 1679 Chamberlaine was noted for four titheables. It is stated that Margaret Powell was his first wife. Mary Wood, daughter of Abraham Wood, was his second wife. In 1686, Thomas Chamberlayne and wife, Mary, conveyed to George Archer and Joseph Royall land that had bee devised by the will of her father…. Joseph Royall was the son of Joseph Royall and Katherine Banks Royall Isham the widow of Henry Isham. His half sisters married William Randolph and Francis Eppes. Joseph married Mary Harris, widow of George Archer. Katherine’s will was witnessed by John Worsham, Littlebury Eppes, and Nathan Hill in 1686.\n\nThomas Chamberlaine was sheriff and a major in the Henrico militia. By 1708 Thomas had married his third wife, Elizabeth Stratton, daughter of Edward Stratton, born in 1665, and his wife, Martha Shippey. Thomas Chamberlaine died in 1719. His daughters were Elizabeth and Dorothy. Henry Batte became the guardian of Elizabeth Chamberlaine and Richard Jones, Jr. was chosen by Dorothy Chamberlaine as her guardian. In 1727 Henry’s Batte’s son Henry married Elizabeth Chamberlaine. In 1723, Dorothy Chamberlaine was permitted to choose her guardian, and she chose Richard Jones, Jr. William Kennan and Henry Randolph were security. Henry Batte and wife Elizabeth Chamberlaine, with Peter Jones, III and his wife Dorothy Chamberlaine, were granted the1600 acres of land in Henrico County. Soon after, Peter and Dorothy sold their portion to Henry and Elizabeth for ₤500.\n\nIn 1736, Henry Batte and his wife Elizabeth Chamberlaine, with Peter Jones, III and his wife Dorothy Chamberlaine, patented 1,600 acres in Henrico County on the north side of the Appomattox River known as Cunnecock. Patent 13 Dec. 1736 to Peter Jones and Dorothy, his wife and Henry Batte and Elizabeth, his wife …beginning at little rocks of the Appamattox, which tract was granted to Abraham Wood for 700 acres by patent Oct. 20, 1648, …the right and title thereof is vested in the said Dorothy and Elizabeth and upon survey lately made same is found to contain 1600 acres. A portion of this tract became the site of a famous horse racing track.\n\nCaptain Peter Jones of Henrico County and Margaret\n\nPeter Jones was transported with William Jones in 1638 by Abraham Wood. The next record we have for him is his witness to an agreement signed by Abraham Wood, on 1 June 1655. Captain Peter Jones is first noted at a Meeting of the Militia held at Merchants’ Hope in 1657 when, as Captain Peter Jones, he was placed in command of a company belonging to Colonel Abraham Wood, Esquire, for protection against the raids of Indians. Also commanding trained troops in Charles City and Henrico were Colonel Abraham Wood, Lt. Colonel Thomas Drewe, Major William Harris, Captain John Eppes, Captain William Farrar, Captain Peter Jones, Captain Edward Hill Jr., and Captain Francis Gray\n\nHe was with his father-in-law in 1661 for a militia meeting at William Byrd’s Plantation. Capt Peter Jones Company was formed by freemen from Cittie Creeke to the Falls of Appamattox River on the south side, and from Powell’s Creeke to the falls on the north side. Later, in 1676, Peter was in charge of the Ft Henry garrison where he was in charge of fifty-seven men who came from Elizabeth City, Warwick and James City Counties. Ft. Henry became the property of the Jones family and eventually the sight of Petersburg, Virginia. Ft. Henry became the property of the Jones family and eventually the sight of Petersburg, Virginia. Across the river was Archer’s Point (1665) which eventually became Pocahontas. Peter’s Point was later divided into lots to form the town of Petersburg in 1733.\n\nPeter was Deputy Clerk of Henrico County. The descendents of Peter Jones resided on land that was settled by Abraham Wood. This land lay along Brickhouse Run and Rohowick Creek.\n\nPeter’s wife was Margaret, likely the step-daughter of Abraham Wood. Abraham mentions in his will his grandchildren-in-law (meaning through law) Abram Jones, Richard Jones, Peter Jones and William Jones. Peter Jones died before 1687. Their children were likely born between 1645 and 1660 and were most likely born in the order listed in Wood’s will.\n\nAfter Peter’s death, Margaret married Thomas Cocke of Malvern Hill, a wealthy and influential resident of Henrico County. His first wife appears to have been Agnes Powell, and she was the mother of his children. Margaret and Thomas Cocke made a deed in 1687. Thomas Cocke was member of the House of Burgesses. The will of Thomas Cocke, was filed in 1697. Thomas Cocke was the brother of Richard Cocke, and the father of William, Thomas, Stephen, James, Agnes, and Temperance. Richard Cocke married Mary Aston and they were the parents of John, William, Edward and Richard, Jr. Cocke. (see The Cockes )\n\nThe will of Margaret Jones Cocke, 1718.\n\nIn the name of God Amen August 12th 1718.

Abraham Wood Jones who married Martha, the daughter of Thomas Batte and died about1686-87; Richard Jones, who married Martha Llewellyn and died between before 1704; William Jones who married Martha Ledbiter and died in 1694-5; and Peter Jones who married Mary, the daughter of Thomas Batte and died in 1721. There may also have been a daughter Elizabeth Jones, who was transported with Margaret Llewellyn, sister to Martha wife of Richard.\n\nDescendants of Captain Peter Jones and Margaret\n\nLt. Abraham Wood Jones, son of Captain Peter Jones and Margaret\n\nLt. Abraham Wood Jones married Martha Batte, daughter of Thomas Batte. In 1683, Nicholas Spencer, Esquire, President of the Council, granted Abraham Jones 1,217 aces in Bristol Parish, Charles City County, on the south side of the Appamattox River, near the lands of Major General Wood’s lands, known as Indian Town Lands, now Rohowick, and the main run of the southern swamp, along Wood’s Fort Lands, and back to the Appamattox. This was for transporting 25 persons including Richard Jones, and William Jones who were likely his sons, or his brothers.\n\nAbraham Jones was a Lieutenant in the militia in 1683 and died by 1687, as William Byrd I wrote that Banister had married a widow in 1687. This was Martha Batte Jones. She married the Reverend John Banister, Rector of Bristol Parish and one of the original trustees of William and Mary College. Banister was born in 1650 in Gloucestershire to John Banister.\n\nA 1690 deed in Bristol Parish, Charles City County, near Rohowick notes land belonging to the late Colonel Wood and the adjacent lands of the late Abraham Jones. John Banister patented 300 acres for importing himself and four slaves. In 1690 John Bannister patented 1,730 acres south of the Appomattox River along Hatcher’s Run in Charles City County. He was very learned and studied Virginia’s plants and insects. Also patenting land along Hatcher’s Run was Richard Bland. John Banister travelled to the Roanoke River in 1692, evidently part of an expedition made by William Byrd. He was accidently shot by one of his party.\n\nIn December, 1692, Mrs. Banister, relict of Abraham Jones and John Banister was ordered to give report of her late husband’s estate. Martha was not able to attend court as she was ill, so Richard Bland was empowered to go to her and swear her as administrator of the two estates. Martha soon married Stephen Cocke son of Thomas Cocke who had married Margaret the widow of Peter Jones and mother of Lieutenant Abraham Wood Jones. Stephen Cocke and his wife, Martha, were appointed administrators of John Bannister, deceased in 1694. In 1704, Stephen Cocke paid quit rents on 2, 406 acres of land for Jones Orphans. That year he gave a Negro girl to Martha Jones.\n\nMartha raised her children fathered by Abraham Jones, as well as John Banister and Stephen Cocke. In 1713, she and Richard Jones, Jr. who must have been Captain Richard Jones, and John Woodlief, likely the son of Captain Woodlief and his wife, Mary Wynne, gave a bond for the benefit of the orphans of John Banister, who were still not 21 years of age. Martha and John Banister were the parents of John Banister who married a Wilmouth. He was the father of Colonel John Banister of the Revolution and his sister, Martha Banister, who married Robert Bolling son of Robert Bolling and Anne Cocke.\n\nPeter Jones, Jr., of Hurricane Swamp, son of Lt. Abraham Wood Jones\n\nPeter Jones, Jr. was called Peter, Jr. to distinguish him from his uncle Peter Jones. He was raised by his mother in the household of first, Reverend John Banister, and then Stephen Cocke, as his mother remarried twice.\n\nPeter Jones, Jr. married his cousin Mary Jones, the daughter of his uncle, Captain Peter Jones, who died in 1726, and his wife Mary Batte. Peter Jones, Jr. resided in Prince George County, but purchased a large tract of land in Brunswick in 1726. He died in 1734.\n\nIn December, 1714 Peter Jones of Prince George County, son of Abraham Jones deceased, conveyed to Abraham Jones of Prince George County, 34 acres of land which lay along the line of Captain Peter Jones to Brickhouse Run, over to Burra’s (Burrow) Branch. This deed was witnessed by Peter Jones, Sr., and Peter Jones. In May 1715, Peter Jones, Jr. of Prince George County, conveyed to William Jones, of Prince George County 100 acres on the south side of Brickhouse Run, at a branch below William Jones’ house, then along Peter Jones’ old line. In 1716, Peter Jones, Jr. was appointed overseer of the road. Brickhouse Run is just east of Rohowick Swamp. Both run into the Appomattox River and lie within the current city of Petersburg.\n\nThat same year his lands on Nottoway River, Great Creek, and Hurricane Swamp were surveyed. In 1719 Peter Jones, Jr. and his wife, Mary, conveyed to Richard Smith, 200 acres being the land where he then lived, lying on the south side of Appamattox River, adjoining Martha Cocke, his mother, known as the Indian Town, then up the branch to William Jones’, his cousin’s, line on the Otterdam, to Reedy Run, then to the river. The witnesses were Robert Bolling, Robert Munford, and John Evans.\n\nPeter sold 306 acres on the south side of the Appamattox River which lay on the dividing line between Peter Jones and John Banister, his half-brother, then to Brickhouse Run, next to land purchased by Munford from Bartholomew Crowder. This deed was made the same day as the deed to Smith. A few months later, Robert Bolling, surveyed, 183 acres on the north side of Nottoway River and the upper side of Hurricane Swamp, which was deeded by Peter Jones, son of Lt. Abraham Jones, to his son Abraham Jones. This deed was recorded in 1725, and Abraham was referred to as Abraham Jones, Jr., likely to separate him from elder cousin, Abraham Jones.\n\nIn 1722, Peter Jones, Jr. conveyed to Thomas Ravenscroft, of Wilmington Parish, James City County, two tracts in Prince George County. One was 200 acres at the mouth of Reedy Run along John Ellis’ line to the river, and the other was 10 acres next to Major Bolling’s line, on the Appamattox River near the falls, then to Brickhouse Run.\n\nIn November 1726, Peter Jones, of Prince George County, was granted 974 acres lying on the south side of Nottoway River in Brunswick County lying between Robert Lyone and William Davis.\n\nChildren of Peter Jones, Jr. and Mary Jones, daughter of Capt. Peter Jones\n\nTheir children were: Cadwallader Jones; Frederick Jones; Peter Jones; Abraham Jones; William Jones; Martha Jones of Amelia County; and Agnes Jones who married Edward Jones, son of Richard Jones and Sarah Stratton.\n\nAgnes died in 1803 in Amelia County. Her two daughters were noted in the will of Martha Jones as her nieces. In 1758 Agnes Jones administered the estate of her late husband, Edward Jones, with security given by Daniel Jones and Peter Jones. Andrew Redford received 1/3; Martha Jones received 1/3 and Edward Jones, son and heir his 1/3. The will of Agnes Jones noted daughter Mary Redford, son Edward Jones, and grandchildren John and Agnes Jones Redford. The executors were Richard Jones, Peter Jones and Edward Jones.\n\nThe area of Prince George County in which their children resided became Dinwiddie County in 1752.\n\nWilliam Jones the son of Peter Jones, Jr. and Mary Jones\n\nWilliam Jones was born March 25, 1725 and died in 1801.\n\nAbraham Jones, Jr. the son of Peter Jones, Jr. and Mary Jones\n\nAbraham Jones, Jr. received a deed for 183 acres from his father, Peter, which was located adjacent to Robert Bolling, Evans, and Abraham Jones. This land was along Hurricane Swamp. He married Sarah Ravenscroft. Abraham Jones was noted in the Henrico will of Seth Ward in 1736. The will leaves to Abraham Jones, when he comes of age, a mare and cattle. It also dictates that if Seth’s 3 children, Martha Ward, Elizabeth Ward, or Seth Ward, Jr. should die before, then Abraham Jones was to inherit the Ward estate of 200 acres on Nishews Branch, etc. as well as land at Sheffields. If they all died then it was to go to Captain John Worsham and Captain. William Worsham, trusted guardians of the children.\n\nAbraham Jones, Jr. patented 2,348 acres in September, 1755 in Brunswick County on the branches of Poplar Creek, on Barlows Branch, Peahill Creek and Pidgeon Roost Creek adjacent Henry Rose, Thomas Moseley, John McInvale, William Huff, Daniel Huff and Valentine White for 11 pounds 15 shillings.\n\nCadwallader Jones the son of Peter Jones, Jr. and Mary Jones.\n\nCadwallader Jones was born in Prince George County in 1728. His sister Martha left his three Negroes and a mare. Cadwallader and his brother Peter Jones were her executors of her will. Peter Jones, Jr., Richard Jones, Jr., Daniel Jones, and Richard Hayes were the appraisers of her estate. In 1752 Cadwallader Jones of Williamsburg conveyed to Peter Jones of Prince George County for ₤200, 744 acres of land which had been deeded to Cadwallader by his father Peter Jones in 1734. This land lay on the south side of Nottoway River, being part of a tract granted to Peter Jones in 1726. The witnesses to this deed by Cadwallader were Frederick Jones and William Jones.\n\nPeter Jones the son of Peter Jones, Jr. and Mary Jones.\n\nPeter Jones lived in Dinwiddie County purchased 190 acres in 1775 along the Nottoway River below Hickory Run. This was The Oaks and it remained in the Jones family. Peter married Dionesia Ravenscroft. Peter died in 1795. He held 53 slaves, 8 horses, 32 cattle, 23 sheep, 58 hogs, 6 beds and furniture, 4 dozen silver spoons, etc. Across the Nottoway was Brunswick County, and this Peter Jones purchased 630 acres from Henry King which had been part of a grant to Peter Jones in 1726, and then sold by Peter Jones to Wynne, then to Frederick Jones, and by Frederick Jones to King. Peter Jones and his wife Dionesia, conveyed to Benjamin Jones of Dinwiddie 268 acres of land on the north side of Hickory Run adjoining his own land. They were the parents of Dionasia wife of Lewis Starke; Mary married Harrison Randolph; Wilmouth married Alexander Walker; Hannah wife of Peter Minor; and Elizabeth married Buckner Stith; Hannah married Peter Minor then Robert Turnbull.\n\nFrederick Jones the son of Peter Jones, Jr. and Mary Jones.\n\nFrederick Jones was born December 4, 1720. He married Betsy Eppes before 1749 when they sold 630 acres of land which had been a portion of a grant to Peter Jones in 1726. This land had been sold to William Wynne, and by Wynne was then sold to Frederick Jones in 1739. Frederick also received a patent on Hatcher’s Run in 1749, which originally was land granted to Abraham Jones, and inherited by his son, Peter Jones. The Quit Rents were not paid by Peter, so Frederick petitioned that the 219 acres be deeded to him, which the Governor agreed to do. This land lay along John Banister’s line and John Davis, Thomas Moore, and William Mayes property.\n\nFrederick Jones was part of the building of a bridge over the Appamattox River. In 1760, Frederick Jones and his wife Betty of Prince George County, conveyed to Peter Jones of Brunswick County 150 acres on Boochery Creek in Lunenburg County. Frederick Jones died about 1765. Peter Jones, his executor sued John Ragsdale in Lunenburg County, and also sued for the collection of business debts in Amelia County.\n\nFrederick and Betsy were the parents of Nancy who married Thomas Broadnax, Sarah who married William Broadnax of Brunswick, Frederick and Cadwallader Jones.\n\nFrederick and Betsy were the parents of Frederick Jones who was born in 1749 and lived in Dinwiddie County. He married Susanna Claiborne, the daughter of Augustine and Mary Claiborne of Sussex in 1773. Their children were Betsey Eppes Jones who married William Mason; Mary Herbert Jones who married John Withers of Dinwiddie and had Susannah Withers, wife of Governor Clement C. Clay of Alabama;\n\nFrederick and Betsy were also the parents of Captain Cadwallader Jones who married Mary Pride in Surry in 1783. Cadwallader and Mary Pride were the parents of Frederick Lafayette Jones who took the name Pride, at the behest of his uncle Halcott Briggs Pride, and thereby inherited a large estate in Northampton County, North Carolina. Frederick Jones Pride married Amaryllis Sitgraves in Halifax. She was the grand daughter of General Allen Jones of Halifax, North Carolina. Orphaned at the young age of six years Lucy Pride, a daughter of Cadwallader and Mary Pride Jones, was raised by an aunt until she was taken to Mount Gallant by General Allen Jones. She married Major Allen Green, and was left an estate by her brother Halcott Jones who also took the name of Pride and inherited from his uncle. Another son of Cadwallader and Mary Pride Jones was Cadwallader Jones. He married Rebecca Edwards Long in 1810 at Mount Gallant in North Carolina. He was born at Monte Calloux in Prince George County in 1788. He served for a time in the Navy and Army, under General Wilkinson on the Mississippi River. In 1810 he resigned and settled along the Roanoke River. He owned Mount Gallant in York County, South Carolina, and another plantation on Black Warrior in Alabama. He was president of the Roanoke Navigation Company and chairman of the Court of Common Pleas and Quarter Sessions.\n\nCadwallader Jones, son of Cadwallader and Mary Pride Jones lived at Monte Calloux near Petersburg. During the Revolution Major Cadwallader Jones was in Baylor’s Regiment and bore a sword with a coat of arms, claimed to be the entitled arms of the Jones descendents of the Peter Jones family. This sword was carried in the Revolution, the War of 1812-14, and in the Civil War.\n\nRichard Jones, son of Captain Peter Jones and Margaret\n\nOver the years it was assumed that Richard did not survive to adulthood. Richard, based on the will of Abraham Wood, was the second son of Peter and Margaret and likely was a young man when his step-grandfather died in 1682. His brother, Lt. Abraham Wood, who was likely the eldest, died five years after Major General Wood, and was married with offspring when he died. Richard evidently died around 1700, when his son Richard was granted land on the Rohowick. Richard Jones in 1673 served on a jury in Charles City County.\n\nRichard married Martha Llewellyn before the will of her father was filed in 1663.\n\nDaniel Llewellyn Family\n\nIn the 1663/4 will of Daniel Llewellyn of Chelmsford, Essex, planter was filed. Lands, tenements, hereditaments in Charles County in upper part of James River in Virginia, to wife Anne for life, then to son Daniel Llewellin. …to daughter Martha Jones… to son Daniel Llewellyn best suite, cloake, coate and hatt, second best hatt with silver hatband, all Linnen, and my sayle skinn Trunk.

To be buried in parish church of Chelmsford neare the Reading deske and friend Doctor John Michelson to preach. Witnesses: Robert Lloyd, Tim Code, senior, scrivener.\n\nIn 1633 Daniel Llewellyn was claimed as the headright of Captain William Perry along with George Baker, and John Carpenter. The daughter of John Carpenter would marry William Baker, grandson of John Baker, and Daniel Llewellyn is said to have married Ann Baker. We know that Ann was born in 1603 so it is unclear if she was a Baker of not. Daniel and Edward Baker are noted together in the tobacco records of Maryland. John Baker’s brother Richard married the daughter of Henry Perry. John Baker was a neighbor of Abraham Wood in 1638.\n\nAnne first married John Price. John Price came to Virginia in 1611 and was granted 150 acres in Henrico in 1619/20. His wife Ann came in the Francis Bonaventure in 1620. They were listed at Neck of Land in Charles City in 1623 and 1624, when he was 40 and she was 21 years of age. John was the father of Matthew and John Price. He and Ann were the parents of Mary Price. John Price died in 1628 and his widow married Robert Hallom about 1630. In 1636/37 Richard Cocke patented 3000 acres east of the land granted to John Price, now held by Robert Hallom. Robert Hallom was from Burnham, Essex. He arrived in 1620 in the Francis Bonaventure and was the servant of Luke Boyse whose widow married Mathew Edloe. In 1624 he was listed as 21 years of age in the muster at Neck of Land.\n\nIn May, 1638 Ann Hallom, widow, and the heirs of Robert Hallom, deceased, were issued a patent for 1,000 acres in Henrico County. This land adjoined the land of Mr. Richard Cocke, and the land of John Price, which was due by bargain and sale from Arthur Bailey, merchant. William Randolph later purchased this plantation along with the 150 acres tract of John Price known as Turkey Island. Robert Hallom and Ann were parents of Ann, Sarah, and Robert Hallom. Robert went to live in England with his aunt, Margaret, the widow of Thomas Hallom, and her second husband, William Mason.\n\nAnn’s third husband was Daniel Llewellyn. They were probably married between 1638 and 1642 when Daniel Llewellyn patented 856 acres on the upper branches of Turkey Island Creek. This was next to Mr. Aston’s land. Among the headrights he claimed were Robert and Frances Hallom.\n\nAnn died by May, 1666 when Daniel Llewellyn, Jr. patented his father’s land.\n\nIn 1636 Daniel Llewellyn witnessed a land transaction between Richard Johnson and Abraham Wood. He patented land adjacent Joseph Royall in 1642. Then in 1650, he claimed Edward Baker, Francis Clarke, Edward Sheppard, and John Slocomb as headrights. Adjacent to Daniel was John Llewellyn, who evidently relocated to St. Mary’s. Edward Baker was a mariner. Daniel Llewellyn purchased land at Shirley Hundred from John Baker and Dorothy Harris in 1654. He sold this land to Captain Edward Hill. In 1655, Daniel Llewellyn of Essex, in Charles City County, sold 60 acres of land to Colonel Edward Hill, which he had purchased from Dorothy Baker, whereon Daniel had lived, provided that …the said Hill shall keepe the housing free for the entertainment of one Mr. Thomas Noathway for and during the term and time of seven years.\n\nIn September, 1654, James Yates patented 1,000 acres south of the Rappahannock River for the transport of 20 persons which included Elizabeth Jones and Margaret Lewellen (sic). Margaret Llewellyn witnessed a deed in 1654 made by her half-sister Sara Hallom Woodward (wife of Samuel Woodward) for land on Turkey Island. In 1659 Samuel Woodward, the heir of Christopher Woodward assigned to Mr. Anthony Wyatt, 450 acres lying on the south side of the Appomattox River next to Woodward’s 150 acres. Margaret’s husband is said to have been James Crewes of Turkey Island who was executed for his leadership roll in Bacon’s Rebellion in 1676. Evidently, James Crewes was an agent who traded between the Indians, colonists and London merchants. The records of Charles City County note several debts to James Crewes. In 1656, Captain David Pebbles, who lived near Merchant’s Hope, was ordered to pay James Crewes 2, 640 pounds of tobacco, then 356 pounds of tobacco and 8 bushels of salt. William Short confessed judgment to James Crewes, merchant for 704 pounds of tobacco and cask, and 31 large beaver skins in 1656. Later in 1656, James Crewes accused Peebles of stabs and blows, tearing a book, and other charges. Governor Berkeley ruled that James Crewes was making false claims. Later, in 1670, James Crewes was sued by Mr. John Pleasants, attorney for James Jauncey and William Beauchamp, executors of Mr. John Beauchamp of St. Giles without Cripplegate, London, merchant, who died in 1668.\n\nIn 1662 Margaret Crewes was a witness to the will of John Rowan. John Rowan was responsible for the two orphans of John Price, Daniel and John. Margaret died before James Crewes and they had no surviving children. The will of James Crewes notes Hannah Carter and her husband Giles, who presented the will. Mary Carter, their daughter received 10,000 pounds of tobacco and household goods, to be paid three years after he died. Susan Carter received the same. Hannah received a Negro, Kate. The debt owed by Giles Carter was forgiven and he was given the life use of the plantation on Turkey Island where he and his family lived. The will also mentions Theodorick and the rest of the children of Giles and Hannah. Mathew Crews, his cousin received the balance of his estate and was his executor, and he left his best suit and coate to Daniel Price who later married Susannah Carter. Daniel Price was the son of Margaret Llewellyn’s half-brother. Later, in 1680, relatives of James Crewes, in England, would file a petition that Captain James Crewes left no widow or lawful child.\n\nMartha Llewellyn was the wife of Richard Jones.\n\nDaniel Llewellyn, Jr. lived at Rich Level in Charles City County. Capt. Daniel Llewellyn patented on March 10, 1655, 636 acres, 270 acres being part thereof beginning on the land of Shirley Hundred, commonly known by the name of Rich Level. Daniel Llewellyn held land in Charles City County near the land of Richard Jones and Robert Jones. He married Jane Stith, the daughter of Colonel John Stith. Daniel Llewellyn’s will was filed in January, 1710/11. It left his plantation to his grandson, Llewellyn Eppes and then to his cousin, (nephew) Richard Jones, the son of Richard Jones. This was Captain Richard Jones, son of Daniel’s sister, Martha, and Richard Jones. Llewellyn Eppes was the son of Daniel’s daughter and her husband Littlebury Eppes.\n\nIn William and Mary Quarterly, VIII, 237-245 are letters to Daniel Llewellyn, the elder, written in 1650-57. One of the writers, William Hallam, Salter of Burnham, Essex, was the brother of Thomas Hallam, Sr. a Salter of London. The son of Thomas Sr. came to Virginia with a letter of introduction to Daniel Llewellyn in 1655, describing how his estate had been decayed and lost by the recent, and asking the Daniel and his wife care for him and advise him. Also, the portion of tobacco due to William should go to his nephew Thomas when he arrived. This was sent from Burnham in Essex. Later a receipt was recorded in March, 1657 for 2,284 lb tobo 420 lb being on a/c of my uncle William Hallem in full of all accts betweene him and the sd Llewellin and 1384 lb upon a debt of 3750 lb of tobbo and cask due from the sd Llewellin to my mother mrs. Margarett Hallam Signed Thomas Hallam. This tobacco had been sent in February of 1650 through Mr. Arthur Bailey.\n\nIn 1657 a different receipt was recorded in April stating that Daniell Lewellin the day and yeare above written full satisfacon (by ord’r and appointmt of my father in Law and my mother mr Wm Mason and Margaret) for one bill of eight thousand seven hundred and fiftie pounds of tobbo and cask made to my sd mother sch is in full of all accts and reckonings betweene the sd Llewellin and my sd father and mother and my selfe from the beginning of the world to the present day Witnesse my hand and seale the day and yeare above written. Signed and Delivered in the presence of Christopher Woddward, William Porter. This is the true copie of that discharge w’ch I have given to my uncle Llewellin as witnesse my hand Thomas Hallam June 25, 1657.\n\nIn his 1650 letter to Daniel Llewellyn, William Llewellyn notes his despair at Daniel’s illness and also remarks that he wants Daniel to be certain his debt to his sister Mason was paid. This would be the widow of William’s brother, Thomas Hallom, Sr. His nephew, Thomas Hallam, Jr., a Salter, of London, also went to Virginia in 1657. His mother, widowed in 1656, married William Mason, of London, another letter writer. William Mason wrote to Daniel Llewellyn from London:\n\nLoveing Brother\n\nIt is fallon unto me by reason I … w’ch yo’r sister in law mrs Margaret Hallam to write yu an answer of a lre (letter) that yu writt unto her bearing date ffebr…yu…exceptions as it doth appe’ by yo’r lre of a O’rd that was writ unto y’u by my wifes sonn She gave no such ord’r as to write any thing that might justly give yu .. –sce –ent but that I shall intreat yu to passe by as proceeding from a young man, but these are to give yu to undertand that w’thin this …6 weekes at furth’st I have rec’d for the 3 hds.

Brother\n\nLondon the 21th of Aug 1650\n\nSupacr’ To his loveing brother mr Daniel Llewellin … in Virginia I pray yum r Bayly I pray Deliv’r this lre w’th yo’r owne hands Yrs Willm Mason (Recorded 14 April 1657Chalres City County Order Book\n\nThe little son in law referred to in letters to Daniel Llewellyn was Robert Hallom, the son of Daniel’s wife, as in a different letter form William Hallom in England, Robert is referred to as your son. Robert Hallam was bound to a man named Wood who had married Ann, daughter of Thomas Hallam, Sr. Samuel Woodward, of Charles City County, married Sarah, a daughter of Robert Hallam. After his death she married John Sturdivant, an Indian trader. Later, John Sturdivant and Sarah deeded 1,000 acres of land to Samuel Woodward, which was at Turkey Island, Henrico, previously patented by the relict of Mr. Robert Hallam and granted to the daughters and heir of Robert Hallam, being Sarah Sturdivant and her two sisters. Another daughter, Ann, married John Gundy of Gloucester. They sold a tract of land to William Randolph that was located on Turkey Island. It seems that Daniel Llewellyn was the brother in law of William Hallam, Salter, and uncle to Thomas Hallam of Virginia. Thomas Hallam recorded a discharge to Daniel Llewellyn his uncle in 1657 in Charles City County.\n\nCaptain Richard Jones\n\nCaptain Richard Jones was likely born after 1660 as he lived until 1747. He was noted as the nephew of Daniel Llewellyn in 1710 and the son of Richard Jones. Captain Richard Jones’ first wife may have been Amy Batte, daughter of Thomas Batte and Mary Randolph. In 1691 Richard stood surety for the marriage bond of John Farrar to Mrs. Temperance Batte in Henrico County. Temperance was the widow of Amy Batte’s brother.\n\nIn 1692 Peter Jones stood as surety for Richard’s marriage bond to Rachael Ragsdale, his second wife. They had eight children: Daniel, Thomas, Robert, William, Llewellyn, Martha, Mary, and Margaret. His will was filed in 1747 in Brunswick County.\n\nIn October, 1695, Richard sued William Hudson. In 1700 he obtained an attachment against the estate of James Basford in Henrico.\n\nRichard Jones patented 230 acres in 1698 in Charles City County, in Bristol Parish south of the Appamattox River extending to the western branch of Rohowick. This area was about 20 miles south of Petersburg in the area that is now Dinwiddie County. It was near the land of Colonel Abraham Wood and Major Thomas Chamberlaine, who had married Mary the daughter of Abraham Wood. It was also near the land of Lt. Abraham Jones. The 1704 Quit Rent Rolls for Prince George County note Richard Jones for 600 acres. This likely means that Richard had inherited land from his father in addition to the 230 he purchased in 1698. Richard’s land in 1703 was adjacent the land of Abraham Wood Jones as noted in a deed to Robert Bolling.\n\nIn October, 1703, Robert Bolling was granted 165 acres in Charles City County, Bristol parish which began at Overby’s to the Western trading path, to Ralph Jackson’s line, to the branch of Rohowick in line of Richard Jones, to the corner of Henry Wall, which was granted to Nicholas Overby in 1698, now deserted, and granted to Bolling. In 1690, Nicholas Overbee, the younger, was granted 323 acres in Charles City County, Bristol Parish, at or near the Rahowick, beginning at land now or late of Colonel Wood, corner of land late of Abraham Jones, to Henry Wall, etc. Then, in April, 1690 Henry Wall patented 275 acres at or near Rahowick, beginning at the land now or late of Major Chamberlin’s to the line late of Colonel Wood, now or late said Chamberlin’s, etc.\n\nBy 1712 Richard was referred to as Captain in the militia. He was also referred to as Richard Jones, Gentleman. Richard was an Indian Trader, who likely traded for beaver pelts, a lucrative high value product. This trade would have come naturally, given his upbringing. In 1713, Robert Hix, of Surry, John Evans, David Crawley, Richard Jones, and Nathaniel Urven of Prince George County, gave a bond to Queen Anne, for ₤300 assuring they would abide by the conditions set down for trade with the Western Indians. In exchange they received a passport to trade with all but the Tuscarora and their allies.\n\nIn 1712 the land of Richard Jones on both sides of Stony Creek was surveyed. The survey was for 521 acres adjacent other land which he already owned. In 1723 he received the patent for these 521 acres on Stony Creek in Prince George County. In 1724 Bristol Parish was divided from Monassaneck Road at Appamattox Ferry to Stony Creek Bridge between Captain Richard Jones and Joseph Wynn, then up Stony Creek and the upper road to Nottaway River, then along the river. It was in this same precinct that Captain Peter Jones, and his son Peter, were made tobacco plant counters.\n\nBy 1724, Richard Jones of Prince George County, Gentleman, held 930 acres on the south side of Stony Creek Bridge, in Prince George County about 20 miles south of Petersburg in what is now Dinwiddie County, adjacent Captain Evans and himself.\n\nHe also held another 452 acres in Brunswick County which was on the outward side of Hickory Run and the South side of Nottoway River. In 1726, William Parham, Sr. of Surry, patented 145 acres on the south side of he Nottoway River, across from land he already held, and between the lines of Captain Richard Jones and William Jones, Sr. being bounded by Captain Richard Jones’ lower corner along Hiccory Run to William Jones’ Line. In 1736 Richard Jones, Gentleman of Prince George County was granted 650 acres in Brunswick County beginning on the (Nottoway) River at the first point above the Meadow Branch and touching Robert Wynn’s’ land and Hiccory Run. He died there in 1747.\n\nHis will notes his sons Richard, Daniel, Thomas, Robert, Llewellyn, daughters Martha Evans and Mary Jones, and wife Rachael; grandson Philip Jones, son of Daniel. Richard bequeathed 1500 acres in his will. His will also lists 22 slaves, and several are noted as mulatto.\n\nWill of Captain Richard Jones\n\nIn the Name of God, Amen, the eighth day of August anno dom.

He was deeded 369 acres in St. Andrews Parish, Brunswick County by Robert Wynn and his wife Frances. In 1742 Robert Wynne and Frances his wife deeded to Llewellyn Jones 369 acres in St. Andrews Parish, beginning at Captain Richard Jones upper corner on the river.

In 1764, Lewelling Jones conveyed to Peter Randolph Bland of Blandford Town, for ₤500, 20 slaves. Lewelling Jones removed from Brunswick County after this. In Dinwiddie County there is located Llewellyn Jones Road.\n\nRobert Jones was a son of Captain Richard Jones and Amy Batte.\n\nRobert Jones was born about 1690 and received in his father’s will 480 acres on Morton Branch, in Prince George County. The will of Michael Wall was filed in Brunswick in 1749 and leaves to his friend Robert Jones a Negro Jack and land on Fountains Creek. The executor was Robert Jones, Jr. , his kinsman who was appointed guardian of his children. Evidently, Wall married a sister of Robert Jones. The Wall’s held land adjacent to Captain Richard Jones along the Rohowick. Noted with Robert Jones, Jr. in the records were Thomas and John Jones in 1744 when the court ordered the sale of the land of James Munford to William Byrd for debts.\n\nColonel Richard Jones was a son of Captain Richard Jones and Amy Batte.\n\nColonel Richard Jones was a son of Captain Richard Jones and Amy Batte as he refers to Rachel Jones, widow of his father, as his step-mother. He was born in 1691. During the life of his father he was also known as Richard Jones, Jr. He lived in Bristol Parish, Prince George County originally, in that part that became Dinwiddie, but ended his career in Raleigh Parish, Amelia County. The large plantation he established was on the edge of settlement at that time, being originally part of Prince George County, it lay in Amelia County when the county was formed. Seller Fork of Deep Creek is now called Cellar Creek in Nottoway County. West’s Creek lies in Nottoway County and Amelia County. They lie between Sweathouse Creek and South Buckskin Creek. It was this area which was settled by descendents of Abraham and Peter Jones, as well as Richard Jones, Clerk and his son Captain Richard Jones. Living near Colonel Richard Jones, who built his home on Deep Creek were Major Peter Jones, and his brother Abraham Jones.\n\nIn 1710 he, with his brother Daniel, witnessed a power of attorney from Mrs. Elizabeth Chamberlaine to William Ligon.
