        "text": "TANN FAMILY\n\nRuth Tann, daughter of Solomon Tann and Georgetta Pope of Northampton County, N.C.\n\nSolomon was the grandson of Exum Tann who was the son of Madison Tann and Elizabeth Sweat.\n\n1. John1 Kecatan, born about 1636, had been the slave of the Hoe family of Charles City County, Virginia, for about twenty-nine years on 14 October 1665 when he appealed to the governor and Council of Virginia for his freedom. He was called \"John a Negro\" when he presented a note written on 26 November 1653 by his master, Rice Hoe, Sr., deceased, that he should be free after serving eleven years, \"provided that he the sd Negro doth carefully and honestly performe his labour.\" Hoe's son, Rice Hoe, Jr., refused to release him, claiming that he had not lived up to the agreement. The General Court ruled that he should be free but referred the case back to the local court to determine if John had kept his half of the agreement. Hoe testified before the Charles City County court that his servant had been \"refractory and disobedient\" and presented the deposition of a former servant, Margaret Barker, who swore that\n\nthe sd Hoe had never a serv't maid but the sd Jack the Negro lay with her or got her w'th child.\n\nBut five other neighbors deposed that\n\nJohn Kecatan Mr Howes Negro have done Mr Hoe true and good service,\n\nand the court ordered him set free in February 1665/6 [DWO 1655-65, 601, 604, 605, 617, 618]. He was probably the \"Jack negro\" who was taxable on 2 persons in Surry County in 1670 [ D&c 1:389]. He was apparently the father of\n\n2 i. John2, born about 1670.\n\n2. John2 Kiketan/ Kicotan, born about 1670, was a seven-year-old \"Mollato boy\" bound until the age of twenty-four on 3 November 1677 when Stephen Lewis sold the remainder of his indenture to William Edwards by Surry County deed for 2,500 pounds of tobacco [DW 2:157]. He was called a \"Molatto boy Named Jno. Kikeson(?)\" when he was named in a 7 May 1678 Surry County court suit between William Edwards and Stephen Luies [Haun, Surry County Court Records, III:381]. John Kickotan was taxable in William Edwards's household from 1687 to 1694. He was head of his own household in 1695 and 1696 and lived adjacent to the Cornish family in Lawnes Creek Parish on Hog Island from 1697 to 1702: taxable on John Blackshire's tithe in 1700 [DW 4:218a, 332b, 5:22b, 60b, 109b, 121a, 134b, 191b, 194a, 208b, 234b, 258b, 291a]. He married Margaret Sweat before 6 July 1697 when they (making their marks as Jno and Margt. Kicotan) returned an account of the estate of her deceased husband Robert Sweat, valued at 2,930 pounds of tobacco. In September 1697 they were ordered by the Surry County court to present an account of the estate of Cornish Sweat, orphan of Robert Sweat. Anthony Cornish was Margaret's security. John Kecotan and Evan Humphreys were witnesses in the May 1705 Surry County court case between Roger Case and John Sugar [DW 5:129a; Haun, Surry County Court Records, V:168; VI:57]. In 1717 he sued Roger Delk for assault and battery in Surry County court [Orders 1713-18, 128]. He was paid 7 shillings by the Surry County estate of Edward Portice on 17 December 1723 and he owed Colonel Nathaniel Harrison of Surry County 8 shillings about 1727 [DW&c 7:496; 8:320]. His children were most likely\n\ni. William1 Kicatan, paid 1 shilling by the Surry County estate of John Ogburn on 25 May 1721 [DW 1715-30, 378].\n\n3 ii. Anthony1 Tann, born say 1697.\n\n3.

He was involved in a Brunswick County court case for debt on 3 May 1739 and 4 September 1740, and on 3 September 1741 he was one of the taxables who were ordered to keep the road from Flat Creek to the Meherrin River in repair [Orders 1732-41, 182, 243, 348]. His son Benjamin Tann was called an \"orphan\" on 20 February 1744 when the Surry County, Virginia court ordered the churchwardens of Albemarle Parish to bind him out [Orders 1744-9, 11, 22]. Anthony was married to the unnamed daughter of John Jeffries, Sr., of Albemarle Parish whose 3 November 1746 Surry County will, recorded on 16 June 1752, named his grandson Benjamin Tann [DW 1738-54, 798]. He may have been identical to the Anthony Tann who was granted 550 acres of land on Jeffreys Creek and the Pee Dee River in South Carolina for himself, his wife, and nine children on 6 June 1749 [Holcomb, Petitions for Land from the South Carolina Council Journals, I:266].

Thomas purchased 100 acres adjoining Allen and Newitt Edwards in Surry County on 14 September 1745 and sold 20 acres of it on 18 March 1748 [DB 1741-6, 341; 1746-9, 388].

On 21 November 1758 he and thirteen other \"Mulatto\" residents of Surry County were presented by the court for failing to pay tax on their wives [Orders 1744-64, 135]. He and his wife Sarah Tan were \"free mulattos\" who recorded the birth of their son Thomas in Bruton Parish in Williamsburg in 1766 [Bruton Parish Register, 28]. He enlisted for 3 years in Isle of Wight County on 26 December 1776 and was listed as deceased in the 1 July 1777 muster of Captain Thomas Edmunds's Company in the 15th Virginia Battalion [NARA, M246, roll 110, frame 285 of 768; roll 113, frame 189; http://fold3.com/image/9639784; http://fold3.com/image/9952883]. He left no will, but his oldest son was probably Jacob Tann who sold part of Thomas's land in 1777. His children were\n\n8 i. Jacob1, born say 1752.\n\nii. Thomas2, born in 1766 [Bruton Parish Register, 28].\n\n5. John3 Tann, born say 1730, sued Chambers Humphries in Surry County court for a debt of £2.12 on 26 February 1754 [DB 1753-7, 114, 191].
