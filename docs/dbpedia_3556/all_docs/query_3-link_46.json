        "text": "Generation No. 1\n\n1.The Immigrant Robert4 Anderson (Richard3, \"York Watershed\"2, \"Colonial Virginia\"1) was born 1613 in Great Britain, and died Aft. 1666 in New Kent County, Virginia. He married ? Bartelot. She was born Abt. 1620, and died Aft. 1664 in New Kent County, Virginia.\n\nNotes for The Immigrant Robert Anderson:\n\nRobert Anderson, \"the immigrant\" was born in Great Britain in 1613. Hottens Emigrants by John Camden Hotten provides us with the fact that Robert Anderson, age 22, embarked in \"Ann & Elizabeth\" April 27, 1635 for Virginia. In York County Wills & Deeds on 12/3/1657 Robert Andrewson is listed as a juror. In the sources discussed below; Robert Anderson, Sr. of New Kent is credited as being born between 1640 and 1645 and his family is known to use the name Bartelot Anderson. In a 1694 York County deposition Bartelot Anderson and his brother John Anderson testify that they are 36 and 30 years old, thus born in 1658 and 1664. The land of Robert Anderson is listed in the Virginia Patents as adjacent Moyses Davies at Tottopottomoyes Creek in 1666. Robert Anderson, the immigrant then likely had sons Robert Anderson, Sr. of York then New Kent, Bartelot Anderson of York, and John Anderson of York and New Kent County.\n\n_______________\n\nThis family has been researched for genealogical purposes since 1881. A Mr. Brock wrote several newspaper articles in the 1880's. Edward L. Anderson wrote the earliest book on the Robert Anderson family and published \"The Andersons of Goldmine\" which can be found in the Library of Congress. In 1936 William Pope Anderson began a re-work of the Robert Anderson family and documented that Robert Anderson,Sr. of New Kent County arrived in what is now Hanover county between 1670 and 1677 as one of 80 persons transported to Virginia by charter to George Chapman by William Berkeley, Governor.\n\nIn the mid 20th century Nell Marion Nugent published her index of the Virginia Land Patents including volume: Cavaliers and Pioneers, Abstracts of Virginia Land Patents and Grants, 1623-1666, Nell Marion Nugent, Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc., Baltimore, Maryland, 1983. My examination in 1980's of Cavaliers and Pioneers revealed that there is a patent record in 1666 that shows Robert Anderson was an adjacent landholder to Moses Davies at Totopotomys Creek in the delta of the Pamunkey River at the head of the York River, an arm of the Chesapeake Bay. In addition a Robert Anderson appears in York County records as a jurist on December 3, 1657. It is very likely then that Robert Anderson, Sr. of New Kent County had been a resident of and been born in Virginia. Additional records would be available except that after Gloucester County was formed from York it's records were destroyed in an 1820 fire and the details of land purchases and wills along the north bank of the York River and at the mouth of the Pamunkey have been lost to that fire. The most significant loss is how Robert Anderson obtained his land at Totopotomys Creek.\n\nIf the family tradition of Edward L. Anderson in \"The Andersons of Gold Mine\" and repeated in \"Ye Andersons of Virginia\", pages 231- 288, Volume 11, Old Northwest Genealogical Quarterly, Columbus, Ohio, 1908; are correct, Robert's father may be the Reverend Richard Anderson, mentioned in 1640's and 1650's York County, Viriginia Court Records. \"Burke's American Families With British Ancestry\" (Genealogical Pub. Co., Baltimore, 1977) p.2539; Excerpted from \"Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry,\" 16th ed. (London, 1939) contends that Robert Anderson, Sr. of New Kent probably descended from Richard Anderson who left England for the colonies 4 Jul 1635, being then aged 17, and was followed on 31 Jul of the same year by Richard Anderson, aged 50, who was presumably his father. The presumption is then that Richard Anderson age 17 in 1635 is the same as the Reverend Richard Anderson of York County VA and that he is the father of Robert Anderson, Sr. of New Kent. The ancestors of Robert Anderson, Sr. of New Kent given in these sources are very speculative, unsubstantiated by record and there are some conflicts between several authors' publications.\n\nYork County Wills & Deeds\n\n12/3/1657 Robert Anderson is listed as a Juror\n\nRobert Anderson, Sr. of New Kent County should have been born by 1636 to qualify as a jurist in 1657. Indeed it would have been unusual to have a 21 year old on a jury. It is also unlikely that an established resident of New Kent County would be a juror in York County.\n\nThis 1657 record suggests that there was an earlier generation of Robert Anderson living in York County and only recorded the once in the York County records. Hottens Emigrants by John Camden Hotten provides us with the fact that Robert Anderson, age 22, embarked in \"Ann & Elizabeth\" April 27, 1635 for Virginia. With the scarcety of surviving records and the fact that most of those surviving records pertain to land ownership it is entirely possible that Robert Anderson, Sr.'s father was the Robert Anderson (b.1613) of the Ann & Elizabeth and and could be claimed to be the father of Robert, Bartelot and John of York County Records. Robert Anderson, Sr. of New Kent County may not have been born until as late as 1645-1650.\n\nBy adding this ancestor I am of course creating another vague and unreliable possibility for the parentage of Robert Anderson, Sr. of New Kent County. I am doing so deliberately just to emphasize how easy it is to contrive another lineage. My claim is supported by just 3 records. The published claims that Robert descends from Richard Anderson (b.1585) and his alleged son Reverend Richard Anderson are even more contrived and are unsubstantiated by any Virginia record that I have found as of 2003.\n\nFrom the Virginia land patents\n\n1666 Robert Anderson adjacent Moyses Davies at Tottopottomoyes Creek\n\n1670 Robert Anderson adjacent John Fleming & Thomas Glass\n\nThese two records indicate that a Robert Anderson already owned land along Tottopottomoyes Creek before 1666. Totopotomy's Creek flows into the Pamunkey River from the south in the eastern part of what is now Hanover County Virginia. While these notations refer to lands significantly upstream along the Pamunkey River it is a reported tradition that Robert Anderson had as his early primary residence properties at West Point near the junction of the Pamunkey, Mattaponi and York Rivers. The western lands near Totopotomey's Creek were speculative and in the interests of his growning sons.\n\nThe 1666 record is the first that we can soundly connect to Robert Anderson, Sr. of New Kent County, as this land can be traced in his possession. Whether this record is of his ownership, or that of his father we do not know. Bartlet Anderson of York County was born in 1658 and his brother by record John Anderson of York County was born in 1664. This suggests that this elder Robert Anderson of the 1657 record was still alive at or near the time of the 1666 record.\n\nBy accepting this earlier Robert Anderson (b.1613) of York County as the father of the Robert Anderson, Sr. of New Kent we relax the burden on having Robert Anderson, Sr. of New Kent being born early enough (ca1636) to be the jurist and late enough to be a son of the immigrant Richard Anderson of 1635 (ca 1636) which in fact leaves only that year 1636 in which he could have been born and still be the source of these entries in the Virginia Records. Having this one man be the source of these records would make him older by another 5 years than anyone has claimed to date.\n\nFor this reason I contend as above that Robert Anderson, of York County, \"the immigrant\" was born in Great Britain in 1613 as found in Hottens Emigrants by John Camden Hotten. Robert Anderson, age 22, embarked in \"Ann & Elizabeth\" April 27, 1635 for Virginia. Robert Anderson settled in York County, Virginia and as appears in York County Wills & Deeds on 12/3/1657 Robert Andrewson at the age of 44 was a Juror. Robert Anderson had as his early primary residence properties at West Point near the junction of the Pamunkey, Mattaponi and York Rivers. The western lands in New Kent County he obained by 1666 near Totopotomey's Creek were speculative and in the interests of his growning sons. I attribute to him sons Robert, Bartlet and John from York and New Kent County records, but do not exclude the possible existence of others.\n\nNotes for ? Bartelot:\n\nBecause of the use of the name Bartelot as a given name in this family, and the common practice in colonial times of naming a son with a given name the same as the surname of the mother consideration should be given that this woman was a Miss Bartelot.\n\nChildren of Robert Anderson and ? Bartelot are:\n\n+ 2 i. Robert5 Anderson, Sr., born Abt. 1642 in York County, Virginia; died 1712 in New Kent County, Virginia.\n\n3 ii. Bartelot Anderson, born 1658 in New Kent County, Virginia; died Bet. 1694 - 1704 in New Kent County, Virginia.\n\nNotes for Bartelot Anderson:\n\nBartelot Anderson was born about 1658 along the York River in Colonial Virginia. His birth date derives from the followiing court entry.\n\nYork Co., Va. Deed Book for years 1694-1697\n\n....Apr. 5, 1694, deposition of Bartlott Anderson in which he deposeth he is aged 36 years and his brother - John Anderson deposeth he is aged 30 years.\n\nBecause of the common use of the name Bartelot Anderson in the New Kent County family in the next hundred years it can be farly certain that Bartelot was the son of the founder of that family in Virginia.\n\nI have not personnaly examined surviving New Kent County records. I have not as yet found any reference that indicates Bartelot had any family, however he did survive long enough to have fathered children and some of the children listed for his brother Robert may in fact belond to him. Examination should be made of early St. Peter's Parish Vestry records for reference to him.\n\n+ 4 iii. John Anderson, born 1664 in New Kent County, Virginia; died Bef. 1706 in New Kent County, Virginia.\n\nGeneration No. 2\n\n2.Robert5 Anderson, Sr. (Robert4, Richard3, \"York Watershed\"2, \"Colonial Virginia\"1) (Source: (1) William Pope Anderson, Anderson Family Records, (W. F. Schaeffer & Co., Cincinnati, Ohio; 1936)., (2) William Pope Anderson, Anderson - Overton, A Continuation of Anderson Family Records (1936) & Early Descendants of William Overton & Elizabeth Waters of Virginia & Allied Fa, (Cincinnati, Ohio; 1945.)., (3) C. G. Chamberlayne, The Vestry Book of St. Paul's Parish, Hanover County, Virginia 1706-1786, (Clearfield Company, Inc.; Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc., Baltimore, Maryland 1999).) was born Abt. 1642 in York County, Virginia, and died 1712 in New Kent County, Virginia. He married ? (Source: William Pope Anderson, Anderson Family Records, (W. F. Schaeffer & Co., Cincinnati, Ohio; 1936).) Abt. 1661. She was born Abt. 1645, and died Aft. 1685 in New Kent County, Virginia.\n\nNotes for Robert Anderson, Sr.:\n\nFrom the Virginia land patents\n\n1666 Robert Anderson adjacent Moyses Davies at Tottopottomoyes Creek\n\n1670 Robert Anderson adjacent John Fleming & Thomas Glass\n\nThe 1666 record is the first that we can soundly assigned to the family of Robert Anderson, Sr., either to himself or his father. Virginia land patents often identify the land by reference to nearby creeks and branches and whether they are above of below a river that is a branch of the Chesapeake Bay. In addition they list the adjacent landowners. These two records indicate that a Robert Anderson already owned land along Tottopottomoyes Creek before 1666. Totopotomey's Creek flows into the Pamunkey River from the south in the eastern part of what is now Hanover County Virginia.\n\nGeorge Chapman\n\n04/22/1670 4150 acres New Kent County\n\nPamunkey Neck, etc. for the transport of Robert Anderson\n\nThis reference may be from Robert returning from a trip to England. There were many reasons for such a trip including the need to see to family affairs there and for education and merchantile affairs. At this time the many landowners frequently selected a member from among them to act as an agent, who returned to England in the spring season when such trips were considered safe from hurricanes and took with him papers and power of attorney from the other landowners that allowed him to represent their interests. He would then return their monies and report to them upon his return. Such trips were burdensome and such task was rotated among landowners.\n\nIn 1677 Robert Anderson signed the petition of grievances for Blisland Parish regarding Gov. Berkley. He was a vestry man of St. Peter's Parish, New Kent County on 11/1686; and for St. Paul's Parish from 1704-1712. However these records do not imply that he had ever moved, rather they reflect the reorganization of the parishes that were occuriing at the time as the Virginia frontier expanded St. Paul's Parish having been formed from the western reaches of St. Peter's Parish.\n\nRobert Anderson\n\n04/16/1683 727 acres New Kent County\n\nPatent Book 7 page 272\n\nN of Chickahominy Swamp in the head of Holly Bush Branch adj. Thomas Glass, to mouth of Meyry Branch. For the importation of 15 persons\n\nThis 727 patent became the \"Goldmine\" plantation. The Chickahominy River spilts the ground between the Pamunkey River and the James River flowing southeast and joining the James River in the eastern portion of Charles City County. I checked for Holly Bush Branch and Meyry Branch on a current Virginia map but did not find them listed. But these lands were in the area just north of current Mechanicsville, Virginia. According to Edward L. Anderson \"Goldmines\" is on the west side of Gold Mine Creek just north of Rockville, which is 20 miles northwest of Richmond on Highway 160.\n\n1683 adj. Moses Davies at Chickahominy Maine Swamp\n\n1703 adj. George Aalvis at Totapotomy's Creek\n\nRobert Anderson Sr. appears in the Register of St. Peter's Parish New Kent County as follows:\n\n25 Nov 1686 - Will Turner hath made a complaint to this vestry that his help being too weak in clearing of ye highways - ordered that the titables of Sam'l Wady, Thom. Glass, Will. Winston, Robert Anderson & Charles Fleming be added.\n\nList of Lands to be processioned on the 4th of May 1689 - Sam'l Waddy, Mr. Boots, Rob't Thomson, Edw Bornett, John Talle, Richd Bollork, Sen, Richard Bollork, Jr, James Tate, Mr. Crawford, Andrew Davis, Edward Broxom, John Wall, William Winston, Jno Crawford, David Craford, Junr, Rob't Andrewson, Chas Fleming, Nicholas Mills, Dox Penix, Mr. Dabbony and others.\n\nRobert Anderson's signature appears repeatedly in the St. Paul Parish vestry book from 1706-1712. He usually signs as Mr. Robert Anderson, Sr., but occasionally uses a large R symbol as a mark in his signature. William Pope Anderson believed that Robert had become so frail that he could only make his mark and his name was signed for him. His son signs as Robert Anderson, Jr. and there is another signator Captain Robert Anderson claimed but unconfirmed to be Robert Anderson, Jr. I beliee that this Captain Robert Anderson was none other than \"Scotch\" Robert Anderson a presbyterian from another family.\n\nOne of the jobs of the vestry of a colonial parish was to \"precession\" the lands of the neighborhood. By this I mean that the land owners who had common borders would get together once in a while (every 5 years or so) and the would walk or ride together around the common boundaries of their land to agree on the border and to remark it freshly so that the marks would not be lost with time. The vestry would meet and name a precinct of landowners whose land bordered on each other and select from among them 2 or 3 prominent men to conduct the precessioning and report to the vestry. Each landowner was required to attend or send a representative and any disagreement was recorded and reported by those in charge of the precessioning. The parish was divided into \"precincts\" each time it was done and becasue there were new landowners over the years the precincts are not always the same, but land that was held in one family is clearly indentifiable and allows one to trace the common precincts over time. Of course the major landowners had borders on all sides so it was possible to appear in more than one precinct if you were on the edge. You might precession your eastern border in one precinct and your western border in another.\n\nFortunately the St. Paul's parish vestry book survived from 1706 to the 1780's and there are precessionings in 1708 and 1711 and so on. Robert Anderson. Sr, and Robert Anderson Jr. and Richard, David, John, Matthew and Thomas Anderson all appear in the 1708 precincts list all of them near each other between Crumps Creek and Tottopotomies Creek and Mechumps Creek to the north of current Mechanicsville, Virginia.\n\nThe Quit Rents of Virginia, 1704, by Annie Laurie Wright Smith, Virginia State Archives; 1957.\n\nAnderson, Robert New Kent County 700 acres\n\nAnderson, Robert New Kent County 900 acres\n\nAnderson, David New Kent County 300 acres\n\nAnderson, John New Kent County 100 acres\n\nAnderson, John New Kent County 100 acres\n\nAnderson, Richard New Kent County 200 acres\n\nRobert Anderson's death in 1712 is recorded in the St. Paul parish vestry book when an entry is made that he is deceased and being replaced as church vestryman.\n\nFrom the 1704 rent roll it appears likely that Robert, David, John and Richard were the oldest sons and that Matthew, Thomas were younger and had not established their own plantations as of 1704. William appears in the King William County rent roll when it is known that he had relocated. Notice also that there is an additional John Anderson in this list I suspect is his younger brother John who appears to have died about 1706 according to St. Paul's vestry book which opens with an entry about care for his children.\n\nRobert Anderson likely had daughters as well, however no record of them has been discovered to date. The sources below list daughters for him and his son as Cecelia, Mary, Sarah and Charity; but this is clearly a confusion by those researchers with the names of the widows of his sons that appear in the St. Paul Parish vestry book.\n\nTake caution, It is unproven that David, John, Richard, Matthew, William, and Thomas are sons of Robert Anderson, Sr. Indeed some may be sons of his brother Bartelot Anderson.\n\nBibliography\n\n\"Ye Andersons of Virginia\", pages 231-288, Volume 11, Old Northwest Geanealogical Quarterly, Columbus, Ohio, 1908\n\nHistorical Southern Families, Vol. XV, p. 201-202, Edited by Mrs John Bennett Boddie, P.O.

Anderson\n\nClimbing the Family Tree by Bessie Lamar Anderson Calvert\n\nCommentary on Sources\n\nWilliam Pope Anderson in Anderson Family Records 1936, The Early Descendants of William Overton and Elizabeth Waters of Virginia, and Allied Families, 1938 and Anderson - Overton 1945 documents the descendants of Robert Anderson of New Kent County. His interest lies with the family of Robert Clough Anderson of some historical fame. Robert C. served with Washington's Army (infamous at the battle of Trenton) and had a son who commanded Fort Sumter at the outbreak of the Civil War. He was considerate enough to collect and document family trees on Anderson families other than Robert's and although his text is tedious to study it contains a wealth of genealogical information. A notation in the latter volume states that copies may be obtained from \"Charitable Relief Association\", 203 West Third Street, Cincinnati 2, Ohio. However that reference has clearly expired. Both the Virginia and Tennessee State Libraries have had these books, although not all three. The first and third are available from genealogical reprint book stores.\n\nEdward L. Anderson wrote The Andersons of Goldmine, which is in the Library of Congress. It contains a family tree for the Robert Anderson family of New Kent. It was used as a source for some of WIlliam Pope Anderson's work and he quotes it where applicable. It is the best source for family traditions. However Edward tended to lump all the Andersons of Hanover in the third generation as sons of Robert Anderson, II when some of them likely belonged to his brothers. He also credited the widows of Robert's sons as daughters of the family.\n\nClimbing the Family Tree by Bessie Lamar Anderson Calvert is an additional source for this family. It contains considerable detail, particularily regarding the female descendants of the family. However some of its data is questionable.\n\nNotes for ?:\n\nCecelia Massie is the traditional name of his wife but to my knowledge it is unsupported by record. In fact, I suspect it is an error caused by the misinterpretation of the land records associated with the widow Cecelia Anderson wife of Matthew Anderson. Massie family researchers have been unable to connect her and alternative suggestions are solicited from researchers.\n\nThe son Matthew married a Cecelia Massie and the grandson Robert's wife's mother was a Cecelia Massie and therefore many Anderson family members correctly remember a Cecelia Massie as a great great grandmother, but I can find no supporting evidence that this woman was Cecelia Massie.\n\nPatrick Anderson\n\n_________________________\n\nW.P. Anderson appeared convinced that Cecelia Massie was the wife of Robert Anderson . However this appears to be based only on family traditions as show by his note 4 on page 1 of his 2nd book as shown below:\n\n\"There evidently was a tradition that a Robert Anderson married Cecelia Massie, as It is also given on the chart of (v6go) Robert M. Anderson, dated 1902, and mentioned in a \"Monograph of the Anderson, Clark, Marshall and McArthur Connection\" by (vbgl)Gen. T.M.Anderson. They however have the date of Robert Anderson's death as 1719, which is wrong. There is a Cecilia Anderson appearing in the processioning of 1719, but she apparently was the widow of Matthew Anderson.\n\nIn \"Ye Andersons of Virginia\" published 1908 by (v697) Dr. Charles Anderson it says a Robert Anderson married Cecelia Massie and places him as the father of Robert III b. 1712.\n\nThere Is nothing in the records left by (v6g) Gen. Robert Anderson,(v6o), Gov. Charles Anderson, or (v6f) Mrs. Sarah Kendrick, mentioning a Robert Anderson having married Cecelia Massie, but Gen. Robt. Anderson said \"The Massies are related to us in some way.\"\n\nIn a letter from (wqx59) Mrs.Alice M.Tyler (AFR28) to ELA dated Sept.24, 1912, she states, \"I found the information about Robert Anderson being sent to Virginia by Juxon & Co. in old records at the State Library. The fact about the marriage of Cecilia Massey was given me by my great uncle David J.Anderson. I will test its proof..\". Mrs. Tyler lived in Richmond, Va.,and addressed her letter to ELA \"My dear Cousin..'' Mrs. Tyler's great uncle .(wqt) David Anderson (AFR35) owned the old family Bible, which was sent to England to prove his title to (wz) William Anderson's estate. The Bible was never returned.\"\n\nSomewhere in some family book, I have seen it said that Robert Anderson married Cecelia Massie in London, England. But no reference was give for this and do not know if it is true. I have forgotten where I saw it. I have wanted to check this out, but so far have not. I done almost no research in England so do not at present know where to look.\n\nfrom Harry Anderson\n\nChildren of Robert Anderson and ? are:\n\n+ 5 i.

Ruth ------, who married, (ca.1714), James Trice, was a daughter of Susanna Swann was a daughter of Susanna Swann. But there's some disagreement as to who her father may have been: Cornelius Dabney, (ca.1640-1693), or David Anderson. I tend to suspect she was David Anderson's daughter, based on later dates for her descendants, but this could be wrong.\n\n____________________________\n\nOther research in Hanover Co. Wills rerecorded in 1868 (on motion of Wm Winston Dabney) show that Dorothy and James Trice were married as early as 1722 because they are mentioned in the will of Susanah Anderson of St Paul's Parish, Hanover Co. dated 4 March 1722. She devises \"to grandson William Anderson\" a young Negro which she lends to grandson's \"father in law\" [probably meaning stepfather] James Trice for benefit/education of sd William. Bequests to children: to son, Cornelius Dabney to daughter Dorothy Trice wife of James Trice  to daughter Mary Carr wife of Capt. Thomas Carr  to son David Anderson. [Source: Will Book 1 p632.] That tells me that Dorothy Dabney Anderson and James Trice married as early as 4 March 1722 and Dorothy's son William was alive that date.\n\nSource:\n\nRobert R. \"Bob\" Curlee\n\nImage Computing Co.\n\n4901 Windbrooke Ct.\n\nVirginia Beach, VA 23462\n\n[email protected]\n\n757-671-8774\n\nRe \"8.

She was born Abt. 1680 in New Kent County, Virginia, and died Aft. 1756 in Hanover County, Virginia.\n\nNotes for Richard Anderson:\n\nRichard's existence is derived from St. Paul parish precessioning records and the 1704 rent roll. He is identified in the St, Paul's parish vestry book as responsible for the cures of two different individuals so I am assuming he was considered a doctor.\n\nCuriously I have found no patents or deeds for him but he is listed as a land holder in the precessioning records. He survived for a significant period in the St. Paul Parish precessioning records and it is possible that he had purchased a plantation and never moved from it. He is superceded in those records by his widow Charity Anderson. It is possible that his widow is the Charity Anderson listed as a daughter of Robert Anderson by Edward L. Anderson and others. He lived in a precinct defined separate from his bothers but within one plantation of his brother Matthew.\n\nThe Quit Rents of Virginia, 1704, by Annie Laurie Wright Smith, Virginia State Archives; 1957.\n\nAnderson, Robert New Kent County 700 acres\n\nAnderson, Robert New Kent County 900 acres\n\nAnderson, David New Kent County 300 acres\n\nAnderson, John New Kent County 100 acres\n\nAnderson, John New Kent County 100 acres\n\nAnderson, Richard New Kent County 200 acres\n\nThis is Richard and his father and brothers.

He married Elizabeth Holland; born Abt. 1705; died Bef. 1796 in Louisa County, Virginia.\n\nNotes for Pouncey Anderson:\n\nPouncey Anderson was believed by William Pope Anderson to be a grandson of Robert Anderson I, but no researcher to date has been able to prove from which son. Of the six candidate fathers of the second generation, Robert, John, Matthew, Thomas, Richard and David we actually only know the children of Thomas from his 1757 will in Albemarle. Other evidence from deeds suggests the children of Robert, John, Matthew and David and therefore I have assigned Pouncey to Richard because Pouncey named a son Richard. In addition the Holland family and Pouncey family precessioned land in 1731 and 1739 in St. Paul's parish adjacent Richard Anderson, whom I believe to be the son of Richard Anderson senior. An examination of the widow of Richard Anderson, Charity Anderson, implies she was a Pouncey, in 1731 St. Paul's parish vestry book precessioning records she is listed in a small precinct wtih Anthony Pouncey.

The information therein is thin and no supporting data is presented but the information has been incorporated in my notes.\n\nJohn's connection to Robert is through the precessioning records of St. Paul's Parish, Hanover County, where he is superceded by his widow Sarah. The St. Paul's parish vestry book survived from 1706 to the 1780's and there are precessionings in 1708 and 1711 and so on. Robert Anderson. Sr, and Robert Anderson Jr. and Richard, David, John, Matthew and Thomas Anderson all appear in the 1708 precincts list all of them near each other between Crumps Creek and Tottopotomies Creek and Mechumps Creek to the north of current Mechanicsville, Virginia\n\n_____________________________\n\nThe Quit Rents of Virginia, 1704, by Annie Laurie Wright Smith, Virginia State Archives; 1957.\n\nAnderson, John New Kent County 100 acres\n\nAnderson, John New Kent County 100 acres\n\nNotice that this dual entry indicate that there were two John Andersons in New Kent County at this early date.

Boyle)\n\nReply-to:[email protected]\n\nTo:[email protected]\n\nPat,\n\nJust had the privelege of looking at you excellent website: Everett Anderson Memorial Collection, and want to thank you and share information on my ancestor, John Anderson, c.1670-1730, who died in Louisa Co, and who you list as child #7 of Robert Anderson and Cecelia Massie.\n\nMy own lineage, in brief, goes:\n\n1 John Anderson=Sarah Waddy\n\n2 Maj. Nelson Anderson (c.1714-1786-Hanover Co)=unknown wife\n\n3 Elizabeth Anderson=Waddy Thomson, Sr\n\n4 Anderson Thomson=(1st cousin) Ann Clopton Anderson\n\n[SEE BELOW]\n\n5 David Henry Thomson=Catherine Mary Goll\n\n6 Nelson Anderson Thomson=Mary Lucinda Davies\n\n[SEE BELOW]\n\n2 Ann Anderson (1708-1802)=David Crawford III\n\n3 David Crawford IV=Elizabeth Henderson\n\n4 Elizabeth Crawford=Nicholas Clayton Davies\n\n5 Mayo Davies=Lucinda Taliaferro\n\n6 Benjamin Taliaferro Davies=Mary Frances Shirkey\n\n7 Mary Lucinda Davies=Nelson Anderson Thomson [REDUNDANT]\n\n8 Catherine Mary Thomson=James Luke Boyle\n\n9 James Thomson Boyle=Barbara Jean Simpson\n\n10 James David Boyle\n\n2 William Anderson=unknown wife\n\n3 Col. Nelson Anderson (1735-1819, Louisa Co)=Frances Jackson\n\n4 Ann Clopton Anderson=Anderson Thomson [REDUNDANT]\n\n5 etc\n\nThus, as far as our family can tell, we descend from 3 of the 8 children of John Anderson. I have a fairly good-sized descendancy of these people, and have collected about 800 or so descendants of Nicholas Clayton Davies.\n\nMy main concern is the parentage of John Anderson (your John4, Robert3, Richard 2, Richard1).\n\nI would prefer to believe that he does in fact descend, as above, from Robert, as the genealogists in my family have believed for the past century; however, I have run into a lot of trouble trying to confirm it.\n\nRobert Anderson I had a child named John, with little said about his descendants, but I couldn't tie him into my family. Maybe you will be\n\nable to.\n\nIn W.P. Anderson's 3 books, the major note on John is in \"Early desc. of Wm. Overton, etc\", p.35, and he says that Robert I's son John was born too late to have been the husband of Sarah Waddy, but I can't find any marriage date for Robert I or that of his son John.\n\nMy John and his wife apear to be the ones who were deeded land on 28 Jan 1696 from Samuel Waddy, and John's widow conveyed these 80 acres to John Thom(p)son (7 Aug 1735--Virginia County Records, by Crozier, VII:67). In 1725 he received another grant of land in Hanover Co. My working hypothesis is that he came from Scotland, and came here either before or after his 1700 marriage. One source claimed that the Thomas Anderson of co.Northumberland who established a shipyard at Gloucester Point in the 17th century, was the ancestor of the family in Virginia, and they are apparently unrelated to the Robert Andersons of Goldmine.\n\nIf you have any further ideas on John, I would be grateful for them. If you would like me to send a printout or GEDCOM on anything I have, it would be a pleasure.\n\nThanks again for your great website.\n\n(J.) David Boyle <[email protected]>\n\nEncino, CA\n\n1.
