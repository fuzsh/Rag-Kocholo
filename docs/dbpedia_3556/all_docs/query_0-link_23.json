Ag't\n\nA SAD SUICIDE.\n\nLEWIS WOODMANSEE SHOOTS HIMSELF\n\nTHROUGH THE BRAIN, AND DIES\n\nWITHIN FORTY MINUTES.\n\nLewis Woodmansee shot himself\n\nthrough the brain, at bis heme near\n\nBridgeport, about 8 o'clock Sunday\n\nmorning, and died within forty minutes.\n\nIt is supposed the act was the result of\n\nmental aberration, caused by financial\n\ntrouble, and, possibly, to some extent by\n\nan occurrence of several days ago. At\n\ntbat time Mr. Woodmansee was sitting\n\non the portico in front of bis bouse\n\nduring a very heavy thunder storm. Tbe\n\nair was heavily charged with electricity\n\nand after a bard crash Mrs. Woodman\n\nsee prevailed upon hi m to go into the\n\nbouse. He complained of severe pain\n\nin tbe top of bis bead, and pressed it\n\nand groaned in his misery. There is a\n\nprobability that the concussion of that\n\nexplosion affected bs brain, and assisted\n\nin unsettling him at all events peculi\n\narilies were observed after that which\n\ncreated grave apprehensions in the\n\nminds of members of bis family.\n\nOn the morning of tbe suicide Mrs.\n\nWoodmansee left her husband in bed,\n\nand wbile sitting at tbe breakfast table\n\nbeard a crack which she mistook for a\n\nfire-cracker. Her son, Frank, went up\n\nstairs to investigate, and was horrified\n\nto find bis father lying across the bed,\n\nwith a ghastly wound in the temple, and\n\nunconscious. Drs. Fisber and Cook (of\n\nBridgeport) were hastily summoned, but\n\ntbe suicide never regained conscious\n\nness and died in about forty minutes. '\n\nDeceased was well known throughout\n\nthis couoty. He was a son of tbe late\n\nJoseph Woodmansee, and married tbe\n\nonly child of the late Samuel Lewis.\n\nPrior to tbe war he resided for a time at\n\nSparta. Wisconsin. Returning to SL\n\nClairsville, he went into the army, as\n\nFirst Lieutenant of company B, Ninety\n\neighth infantry, and alter returning\n\nfrom the war eagaged in the hotel busi\n\nness with Mr. Lewis at St Clairsville for\n\na year or two, and from thence they\n\nwent to Wheeling, buying tbe Monroe\n\nHouse property.wbich was enlarged and\n\ngreatly improved and christened tbe\n\ntiraut House. Financially, this step\n\nwas not successful, and it culminated in\n\ntbe destruction of the bouse by fire.\n\nMr. Woodmansee was a member of\n\nthe Grand Army of tbe Republic, Ma\n\nsonic fraternity, tbe Knights of Honor,\n\nand the National Council It is report\n\ned tbat be carried heavy life insurance\n\npolicies.\n\nTHE FUNERAL.\n\nThe remains reached town about 2\n\no'clock Tuesday afternoon, accompanied\n\nby a goodly number of relatives and ac\n\nquaintances, and were interred alongside\n\nbis father, in tbe Union Cemetery.\n\nMarshal Buffinoton bas been pros\n\ntrated for several weeks with a spell of\n\nsickness, and in tbe meantime tbe du\n\nties of bis office bave been discharged by\n\nDeputy Marshal Ducker. Most persons\n\nhave thought the town was getting\n\nalong reasonably well ; but not so the\n\nMayor. Accordingly, a few days ago be\n\ncalled upon tbe Marshal and demanded\n\nbis resignation, and be wanted it bad,\n\nand wanted it quick, too. Of course be\n\ndid not get it.\n\nTo all persons except the Mayor this\n\nseems a very bigb-banded proceeding.\n\nThe Marshal is an elective officer, and\n\nthe Mayor has no more authority to de\n\nmand bis resignation than -the Marshal\n\nbas to call for bis.\n\nThe Tuscarawas Advocate says: Dr.\n\nJ. A. Spence, of this city, (New Phila\n\ndelphia) formed a partnership with Dr.\n\nJ. A. Qobson, of Flushing, Belmont\n\ncounty, Ohio, and left to-day, Wednes\n\nday, for that place. Dr. Spence gradua\n\nted at tbe Miami Medical College, Cin\n\ncinnati, Ohio, last March, and took the\n\nhonors of bis class for standing tbe best\n\ngeneral examination. He is an indus\n\ntrious student a young man of fine at\n\ntainments and excellent character. We\n\nheartily commend him to the people of\n\nFlushing and Belmont county, as in\n\nevery way worthy of their highest es\n\nteem and confidence. Dr. Spence's ma\n\nny friends in New Philadelphia, wish\n\nand predict for him a very successful\n\nfuture.\n\nThe political Prohibitionists at their\n\nconvention in Bellaire on Wednesday of\n\nlast week, nominated the following\n\nticket:\n\nFor Representatives Jacob Maule.of\n\nColerain township, and R.
