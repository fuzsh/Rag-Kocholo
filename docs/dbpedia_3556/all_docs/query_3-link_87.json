PREFACE. \" Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\" The interest of people in their kindred is one of the meas- ures of the distances between the races of men. The cul- tivation of family history is one of the essentials to the wel- fare of society. The continued existence and prosperity of every nation depends upon the love of country and pride of race, which is true patriotism. We are commanded to honor our forefathers, that our days may be long. Our religion, civilization, and patriotism, alike require us to rescue their memory from oblivion, so that they may not perish forever as though they had never been born. And it is our sacred duty to \" gather up the fragments that remain \" before their past history has been obliterated by the effacing fingers of destruction and decay. I will give something of \" the Cabells and their kin \" in England as an introduction ; but my especial object will be to give an outline history of an American family in its vari- ous branches, showing the contribution of the various mem- bers to the history and advancement of their section and of their country. And as Americans are a mixed race, I shall sometimes trace back to emigrant ancestors, and will give the \" Seize Quartiers \" sufficiently often to convey a fairly approximate idea of the actual percentage of English, Scotch, Huguenot, and other blood flowing in the veins of the kindred, especially of this section, which sent out so many emigrants to other sections of our country. iv PREFACE Much has been written of the first settlements of the tide- water regions which lay within the reach of shipping, while comparatively little has been published about the cut- ting loose from the moorings, and the first advancement of the settlements \" within the land \" to the westward. For the first three generations, this work will be largely devoted to an outline of this movement up the James River valley, and to the earliest settlements within the north and south branches of James River. When young Dr. William Cabell emigrated with his fortunes from the land of his forefathers to become the founder of a new family in the New World, he cast his lot for his new beginning in the frontier forests of Vir- ginia along the upper valley of the James. And it came to pass that the new family and the new country grew up together, â the founder of the one was to some extent the founder of the other, â and the interests of both were in many ways, for many years, the same. The earlier members of this new family were men of affairs rather than of letters, â the times and the task before them required them to be so. They were not only among the most active founders of this region, but also among the most active builders-up of this region. They not only made the hunting-ground of the savage â a wil- derness of wild woods â to feel the yoke of the plow and to blossom as the rose, but, from the time when this section was first represented in the colonial government to the beginning of the Revolutionary period, Cabells were in the House of Burgesses, looking to its interest in the public councils. During \" the time that tried men's souls,\" Ca- bells and their kin were in the conventions guarding the rights of their home land. And from the war between the mother country and the Colonies to the war between PREFACE V the States, the Cabells and their kin were constantly rep- resenting this region in the House of Delegates, the State Senate, or the House of Representatives of the United States. But the Cabells and their kin were not among the founders of this section only, and their services have not been confined to this region alone. Many of them are found among the leading founders of the West and other portions of the Union. They have had their full share in the public and domestic affairs of nearly every portion of their country, and in shaping its destiny both under the crown and under the Republic. I have made a special effort to give to the part of the work which relates to those born prior to 1825 (\" three- score years and ten \" ago), and to many of those born since, who have gone before us, something of a memorial charac- ter, going somewhat into details. But of \" the living gen- erations \" it is mainly in the nature of a record. And I have made no effort \" to trace back \" those intermarried with after 1825, because the increasing number of these people, and the increasing length of these lines, would fill volumes. So it was necessary to leave much of the family history of the present generations for the future historians of the family. I have been more disposed to make use of matter still in manuscript than to give matter already preserved by the art preservative of arts. The material I have had to work with is necessarily un- equal. Some public (church and state) records have been preserved, others have not. The records of some counties have been destroyed. Some families have preserved their family memorials fairly well, others have not preserved them at all. Some individuals have led active lives, others vi PREFACE have lived quietly. Some have devoted themselves to pub- He, others to domestic affairs. And thus, while each one may have done his duty equally well in the life task assigned to each, â whether it was the opening up of a new country to civilization, the founding of a new republic, the estab- lishment of a new State, or the clearing of a new ground for the plow, â our knowledge of them and of their acts must be very unequal. It has been said that \" the man who makes two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, deserves better of man- kind than the whole race of politicians put together.\" Yet no class is more apt to be forgotten than the farmer, who seldom leaves any material for the biographer. Of some of the past generations I have sufficient material to make volumes ; of others I have found but little, and of others nothing. \" There be some of them that have left a name behind them that their praises might be reported. And some there be who having no memorial are perished as though they had never been born.\" Of the present generations, some wish to have a full rec- ord of their families preserved, and have furnished ample material. Others only wish brief outlines, and have fur- nished but little. Others are willing to give names, but not dates of birth, etc. Others \" do not wish to be in print at all,\" etc. At least half a dozen have taken the trouble to prepare and send me quite interesting sketches of their families \" for my own perusal,\" coupled with the request that \" they should not be published.\" \" There are many men of many minds.\" These differences in material and of opinion have made it impossible to give the work an entirely uniform character. But the main object, considering all things, â for the way of the genealogist is proverbially hard, â has been fairly PREFACE vii well accomplished. The memory of the forefathers has been preserved ; an outline of the past history of the past generations of the family has been given ; the spread of the descending stream has been shown ; the names of the descendants have been recorded quite completely down to 1861 ; and thus the initial step for the future historian of the present generations has been taken. I wish to express my especial thanks to the Hon. Edward Carrington Cabell, of St. Louis, Mo. ; Hon. George L. Rives, of New York ; Dr. Julian M. Cabell, U. S. A. ; and Edmond L. McClelland, of Washington, D. C, â the especial patrons of this book, â and to other members of the family who have patronized the work, and to all who have aided me with material for the book, or in any other way. I wished to mention each one in these premises by name, but find that I cannot do so in a satisfactory way. Some have done a great deal ; others, very little. Therefore to name all on the same footing would not be fair ; while to state what each one did would be to draw comparisons, and \" compari- sons are odious.\" But each one can rest assured that I am very grateful to all, and I hope that all may continue to take an earnest interest in the welfare of \" the Cabells and their kin.\" Alexander Brown. \"Union Hill,\" May 23, 1895. CONTENTS. \" Monuments themselves memorials need.\" A good edition of a book â the work of the Art preservative of arts â secured in many libraries, is the most enduring memorial. PART I.

THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN IN ENGLAND. \" tract of Tyme, that all consumes to dust, We hold thee not, for thou art hald behinde : The fairest sword, or mettall, thou wilt rust, And brightest things bring quickly out of minde. The trimmest towers, and castles great and gay, In processe long at length thou doest decay ; The bravest house, and princely buildings rare, Thou wasts, and weares, and leaves the walls but bare.\" Sundry papers left by Dr. William Cabell, the emigrant, in Virginia, together with sundry documents which I have found in England, make it certain that he was a grandson of William Cabell, who came to Warminster, England, about 1664, and died there in 1704. I have been at some ex- pense in the effort to find out where this William Cabell came from, but I have not been entirely successful. It seems certain that he was of the Frome-Selwood family, and probable that he came from Buckfastleigh. However, the object of this work is to treat of the founding of a new family in the New World and to trace down the descen- dants, rather than to treat of an old family in the Old World and to trace back the ancestors. And therefore some general remarks on the Cabells and their kin in England, with some particulars of several branches, will be sufficient for the introductory purposes necessary in these premises. In addition to Dr. William Cabell's papers, I have had 2 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN reference to copies of sundry documents brought from Eng- land by the Hon. James Alston Cabell of Richmond, the late Rev. H. C. Alexander, D. D., and others. A faithful re- search has been conducted there for me by the Rev. Charles Herbert Mayo, M. A., in Dorset, Somerset, and Wiltshire ; the late Rev. Beaver H. Blacker, M. A., in Gloucestershire ; and by Col. William Cabell and others in London and elsewhere in England. One of the most in- teresting documents that I have found is a book of about 100 pages, still in manuscript â \" Memoirs of the Cabells or Cabbells\" â which was compiled, as I understand, for the late Benjamin Bond Cabbell (1781-1874), of Cromer Hall, Norfolk, by Gabriel Ogilvey, Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Normandy, in 1867-1869. It relates to the family in England and in Normandy, 1066-1675. I will give extracts from it from time to time. It begins : \" The history of this family may be traced from the beginning of the eleventh century when Walter Cabel witnessed a charter of Bradenstone in Wiltshire. This Walter Cabel appears to have come over to England at the time of the Conquest with Walter d'Evreau, Earl of Rosmare and Nantu in Verein [indistinct], whose great grandson Patrick d'Evreau was created Earl of Salisbury in the time of King Stephen. That Walter Cabell settled at once in Wiltshire is proved by the fact that, some time after the Conquest, he sold his ^demesne to Adam Turgot, another Norman. This demesne was called Radeclive, which name may be now Radcliff. The successors of Walter Cabel continued in the counties of Wilts, Dorset, Devon, and Somerset. There is some con- fusion in the arms of this family : the old historian of De- vonshire attributes to the Cabells of Buckfastleigh, Sable, a horse upright argent, bridled or ; and to others of the same name, Vert a fesse argent, fretted gules. It might be that the horse must have been the ordinary arms of this family, the etymology of the name being evidently Ca- ballns as will be seen hereafter. \" Gabriel Ogilvey, F. S. A., of Normandy.\" IN ENGLAND 3 Farther on Mr. Ogilvey writes : \" It is a fact that the Normans did use the Latin term of ' Caballus ' instead of that of ' Equus ' for the noblest of quadrupeds in the world, and it is another that some Norman families took such a name from some of their ancestors having thus been designated from their strength and courage, or from some other allusion we know not. It is a fact yet that there was existing in Normandy until very recently a family of some note, bearing the name of Cheval and Queval. \" This ancient family had also taken a part in the conquest of England in the person of Robertus Cabalus, who settled himself in the county of Norfolk ; and his successors ap- pear under various alterations of the name in the rolls of the Tower and Exchequer. Thus we find there recorded Cheval, Chevall, Chivall, etc. In 1131, the great Roll of the Exchequer mentions ' Hugo Chivillus.' In 1165, the Black Book of the Exchequer, ' Henricus Chevel.' I have thus quoted these few examples in order to show that, if the families of Cabell and Chevall, which both took part in the Conquest, are not identical (and this might fairly be inferred from the above quotations) at least the etymology of both names is the same. \" I have said in the first pages of this book that Walter Cabel had come over to England with Walter d'Evreau, with whom he settled in Wiltshire. In fact, Walter Cabel must have been a ' Vavasseur ' of the same Walter d'Evreau in Normandy, if I may infer it from the following facts : There is in the vicinity of the tower of Evreau a locality, or rather a hamlet, depending from the Common of Bois- Arnand, now called Le Chable ; the name of this locality frequently appears in Norman Charters as Chablun and Chaablan. It is fairly presumable that this locality, which we find first mentioned in 1219, owed its name to the family of Cabell, a branch of which subsisted for some time in Normandy. Gabriel Ogilvey.\" The word \" Caballus \" is used for \" horse \" in Domesday 4 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN Book, and it seems certain that the family derived its sur- name from that word. As surnames were introduced into England by the Normans at the Conquest, and as they had but recently come into use in Normandy, the family, hav- ing been traced to 1066, has been traced back about as far as it could be with any certainty. Men took their surnames in various ways. Some took them from the arms which they or their ancestors had made illustrious ; and the white horse rampant, with its bit and bridle of gold, on the war- rior's black shield, may have been carried to the front on many a hard fought field of battle before it gave to its owner his name. The learned Camden, referring to the oldest mottoes he ever met with, mentions the old seal of Sir Thomas Cavall, who bore for his arms a horse, and for his motto, \" Thomse credite, cum cernitis ejus equum.\" As the name is derived from Caballus, I suppose the correct way of spelling to be Cabal or Caball, Cabel or Cabell ; but I have found it spelled in almost every con- ceivable way : Cabbie, Cable, Cabel, Cabell, Cabbel, Cabbell, Cabal, Caball, Cabbal, Cabball, Cabyll, Cabbil, Caable, Cabul, Cabull, Chaable, Cavall, Cavel, Capel, Capell, Caple, Cabelle, etc. ; Kaable, Kable, Kabell, Kabel, Kabbel, Kebel, Kebell, Kebyll, Keble, Kebble, Kebbel, Kebbell, Keeble, Kyble, Gabble, Gabbell, Gable, etc., etc. In French, I find the names Cabal and Cheval; in Spanish, Caballero and Cavallero ; in Dutch, Cabel and Kabel ; in Italian, Cabal- lero, Caballinus, Caballis, Caballo, and Caballus; and in Genoese, Caballo. In a list of foreign Doctors of the 16th century, I find the following : Francesco Caballo or Ca- ballus, Italian physician and medical writer, died 1540 ; Guillaume [William] Cappel [Cabell?], French Doctor of Medicine, born 1530; and Pierre Cabal, French surgeon and writer, who flourished in 1570. But we must return to the family in England. Mr. Ogilvey says: \"Walter d'Evreau, or Salisbury, having founded the Austin Priory of Bradenstone in Wiltshire, IN ENGLAND 5 about the beginning of the reign of Henry I. Adam Tur- got (a Norman who was certainly one of the Conquerors of 1066) was one of the benefactors, and stands recorded as having given to the said house of Bradenstone a demesne, called Radeclive, which he had previously bought of Walter Cabel. (Monastrion Anglicanum, nova editio, Vol. 6, p. 340\\ Brit. Mus. 2062 e.) Such a fact and charter prove that Walter Cabel had been present at the conquest of England in 1066, and had obtained for his share the land of Radcliffe in Wiltshire.\" Mr. Ogilvey's Memoranda, extracted from sundry records, etc., go on to show that : Walter Kabell owned land in Wiltshire in 1110. Jeffrey Cabell owned land in the county of Caux, Nor- mandy, in 1180. Gilbert de Cabel owned land in Caux in 1181-1198. Walter Cabell owned a forest in Buckinghamshire, Eng- gland, in 1198. Evermere Cabell owned land in the same shire in 1205. \" That is about the time of the secession of Normandy from England. Soon after must have lived Ranulf Cabel de Careby (what I take to be Cadeby [Cadbury] in Somer- setshire). He married a lady of the name of Sybil, who was a relative of William de Jumieges. This William de Jumieges belonged to a Norman family of some note which had settled in Somersetshire at the time of the Conquest and had come originally from the little boro' of Jumieges also in the county of Evreau, from which had the Cabells originated, as has been previously shown. This Ranulf Cabel de Careby had a son and heir of the name of Hugh Cabel, who in the year 1253 was wrongly accused of having been instrumental to the death of a certain Thomas de Skendelby, when it was clearly established that this last named had been killed by Richard son of Humfray of Edenham. [Here follows the quotation in Latin.] . . . De anno 37th Hen. III. Hugo Cabellus alias Kabel de Kareby . . . (Calendarium Genealogicum, Vol. I. p. 90. Brit. Mus. 2075. C. 80. London, 1866.) \" 6 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN North Cadbury is about fifteen miles from Frome- Selwood or Froome-Selwood. There are sundry other references to sundry other Ca- bells, in several other parts of England ; but I must con- fine myself to the Cabells of Frome-Selwood in the county of Somerset, England, from which stock the Cabells of Virginia are descended. In 1350, John Cabel, son of John Cabel of Frome, and several others, were allowed by the king for a designated sum of money to give certain tenements with their appurte- nances in Frome, to be held in mortmain, to the chaplain of that place. How long the family had then been settled at Frome I do not know ; but we may readily suppose that John Cabel, the father, was born prior to 1300. In 1408, John Cabel of Frome (possibly the same giver, but more probably his son), after an \" inquisition ad quod damnum,\" gave four messuages and certain lands, etc., with their ap- purtenances, in From e-B rami che, Somerset, to the chaplain there. An \" inquisition ad quod damnum \" was held when a person wished to endow a chantry or monastery with land, to ascertain if it would be to the king's hurt or loss if he did so. About this time, and for some time thereafter, the family seem to have been taking an especial interest in religious matters, and we find them mentioned chiefly in connection with gifts to the church, or as priests, - monks, etc., in Somerset, in Dorset, in Devon, in Norfolk, etc. \" Frome in Somersetshire, only a few miles from Trow- bridge, county Wilts, was the headquarters of the Cabell family. The church contains a chapel, called the chapel of Saint Nicholas, which was founded by John Cabell in 1517.\" I have found no description of this chapel as it originally was, but I am assured that the windows were filled with stained glass coats of arms, etc. Collingson, in his history of Somerset, describes the church of S. John of Frome as it was in 1791. It was for a time neglected, but is now a most beautiful church, splendidly decorated, restored in CHURCH OF S. JOHN BAPTIST Fro me. So m ersetxh ire IN ENGLAND 7 1862-1866, by the Rev. William James Early Bennett, who was Vicar of the church from 1852 to his death in 1886. On entering: the church, there will be seen on the north side, nearest the door, the sculptured figure of S. Aldhelm, the founder of the church. He is represented as founder, according to ancient custom, by carrying the model of the church in his hand. Underneath his statue is a brass plate commemorating: the foundation and the restoration of the church, with a Latin inscription, which may be translated th as : ^ Saint Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne, as tradition tells us, laid the foundation of this sacred house of God about the year of our Lord 680, and after many vicissi- tudes and decay, the Parishioners, with certain friends of the church, at their own cost, in the name of the Holy Trinity, offered to Almighty God its Restoration, which was begun in the year 1862, and brought to a happy con- clusion on the Feast of the Patron Saint, John Baptist, in the year of our Lord 1866. It was in the reign of Queen Victoria. Robert John was Bishop; William J. E. Bennett, Parish Priest ; Edmund Baily and William C. Penny, Church Wardens. Glory be to God alone in Christ. *%* The full particulars of the restoration, etc., are given in a little book called \" The Old Church of S. John Baptist, Froome-Selwood, ... by the Rev. W. J. E. Bennett, with a preface by the Rev. the Hon. A. Hanbury-Tracy, Vicar. Third Edition. Froome : W. C. & J. Penny. 1888.\" A copy of this was sent to me from Frome by the Rev. Mayo Cabell Martin, when he was on a visit there several years ago. This book also describes the chapel of S. Nicholas, which was founded by John Cabell in 1517. The large north window of this chapel (of six lights) is filled with handsome modern stained glass, chiefly in memo- rial of S. Nicholas, to whom the chapel is dedicated, and the apostolic commission of Baptism, â the chapel being 8 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN now used as the baptistery. But in the lower part of the two middle lights are inserted four shields of arms, ancient, which were in the chapel before the restoration. These four panels constitute all that was left of the original old glass in the church. The remainder was destroyed by the Puritans in 1649-1659, when much of the old stained glass of England shared the same fate. The splendid glow of mediaeval glass is now comparatively rare in England ; even the smallest fragments of it are put together in odd places in the lights, and preserved with a jealous devotion. The Vicar in his little book described these arms thus : \" The intervening four medallions contain the armorial bearings of the founder of the chapel, whose name was Cabell. Observe carefully the curious play upon the name. There is the letter K with a bell attached to it, and the whole surrounded by a rope or cable. The dolphin, sea-horse, and cable as appertaining to the sea, agree with S. Nicholas, pa- tron of sailors, and with our present use of the chapel, which is for the waters of Baptism. These armorial bearings are the sole remains of painted glass throughout the whole church saved from the destruction of the Puritans.\" The four shields of arms may be emblazoned thus : â I. Sable, a horse rampant Argent, bitted and bridled Or; impaling â Sable, a, chevron between three dolphins embowed Argent: on a chief Glides, a leopard's head [face] jessant-de-lis Or. II.

It may be that this impaling device should be read, Azure, a text letter K and a Bell intertwined with a Cable, Or. The colorings on the old glass are so old as not to be clear. The impaling arms on the I. and II. shields belong to families with whom the Cabells had intermarried prior to 1517. [I will insert here what I am told is the correct \" Coat \" for the Frome branch of the family at present. Crest : \"An arm in armour embowed grasping a sword, all proper\" Arms : \" Sable, a horse rampant Argent, bitted and bridled Or.\" Motto : \"Impavide.\"] The late Rev. H. C. Alexander, D. D., saw this window in 1878, and described it as being \" as fine as anything of the sort to be found in England.\" I at once tried to obtain a photograph of it, but none had ever been taken. The Vicar and church wardens were not willing for a pho- tographer to take his camera within the church, and conse- quently no photograph could be taken ; but in February, 1879, the Rev. Charles Herbert Mayo of Sherborne obtained permission from the Vicar of Frome (Rev. W. J. E. Ben- nett), and had these arms photographed (for the first time) for me. Dr. Alexander wrote in 1878 : \" Mr. Penny, the anti- quary of Frome, is satisfied that the old Cabells lie buried under the chapel floor ; that they were unquestionably, at one time, by all odds the best people about Frome ; that there can be no doubt they were one of the oldest families in England,\" etc. \" The Grove,\" a most ancient house near Frome, is pointed out as one of the old residences of the Cabells. 10 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN This is now the property of Lord Cork (of the same family as Robert Boyle, a benefactor of William and Mary College, and Charles Boyle, Earl of Orrery, the friend of Colonel William Byrd of Virginia), whose seat is at Marston House, near Frome. \" Whatcombe \" (another Cabell prop- erty) in 1880 belonged to Mr. Duckworth, and was called the Orchard Leigh Estate. I do not know to whom Caford, Foxbourne, and other old Cabell properties now belong. \" Richard Cabell of Cayford and Frome in the county of Somerset, gentyleman,\" was a man of considerable means, as the various remaining records of his buying lands, etc., from 1510 to 1528 amply prove. The last deed Mr. Ogil- vey found of him was dated in 1528, about which time he may have died ; but from 1545 to 1557 we find a \" Richard Cabelle of Cayforde and Frome, gentyleman,\" (either the same Richard or his son) buying, and leasing to others, lands near Frome. The Parish Register of Frome commences in 1538, and on May 2d, 1561, it is recorded that Richard Cabell, \" generosus \" (gentleman) was buried there. In 1562, Richard Cabell was elected a member of Parlia- ment for the borough of Heytesbury in Wiltshire, and sat in Parliament for that borough from January 11th, 1563, to January 2d, 1567. And he was again elected for the same borough to the next Parliament, which sat from April 2d to May 29th, 1571. Heytesbury is some twelve miles from Frome, and about five miles from Warminster. From Frome to Warminster by the old London road was 7|- miles. The present Caford is about 1| miles from Frome. The distance to Buckfastleigh in Devonshire is about 100 miles. Many Cabells were baptized, married, and buried in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Frome and in the region round about. In 1655, Walter Cabell was married, and in 1696 he died, at Frome. He bore the name of the original Norman who settled in the adjoining shire of Wilts six hundred years before. IN ENGLAND 11 I am sure that William Cabell, the ancestor of the Vir- ginia Cabells, who (probably born about 1630) went to Warminster about 1664, and died there in 1704, was of the original Frome stock, and that he descended from the founder of the chapel of St. Nicholas there ; but I do not know certainly whether he went to Warminster from Frome, from one of the near-by parishes, or from Buck- fastleigh in Devonshire. Richard Cabell, the first of Ca- ford, may have been the son of John Cabell, the founder of the chapel ; and the said Richard may have been the father of John Cabell, buried at Frome in 1586 ; who may have been the father of another John (a benefactor of the parish), buried there in 1630 ; who may have been the father of William Cabell, baptized at Frome in 1588, mar- ried to Sarah prior to 1636, and died in 1665 ; and this William and Sarah Cabell may have been the parents of our William of Warminster, but I have found no evi- dence of it. The only evidence which T have is circum- stantial, and it points to the parish of Buckfastleigh as the place of his nativity. Mr. Ogilvey says that Richard Cabell of Cayford, Somer- set, was the M. P. for Heytesbury, Wilts, in 1571 ; that he married Susannah, daughter of John Peter of Buckfast- leigh in the county of Devon, and finally settled there. And this may be correct, but the Heralds Visitations do not locate him so distinctly. The best pedigree of this family that I have seen was obtained by the Hon. James Alston Cabell in 1878, from Mr. William L. Cabell of Lin- coln's Inn, London, who claimed to be a descendant. It is headed \" Cabell of Brooke in the Parish of Buckfast- leigh in the County of Devon, showing the match of the son and heir in 1655 with Elizabeth second, daughter of the Rt. Hon. Sir Edmond Fowell of Fowell's Comb in the Parish of Ugborough in the County of Devon, Knight and Baronet, and M. P. for the Shire.\" Note at the end : \" From my collection towards the Genealogies of the sev- eral ancient families of the County of Devon, which fur- 12 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN nished members of Parliament durins* the Period of the Civil wars and Commonwealth, and in which the Title of Baronet has become extinct. . . . Richard S. M. Sprye. 1 London, 10th of Nov'r, 1835.\" This pedigree, with several corrections and many addi- tions from other sources, will furnish the basis for the following sketch of this family. \" Richard Cabell of manor of Brooke in the Parish of Buckfastleigh in the County of Devon, Esquire, eldest son and heir of Richard Cabell of Frome-Selwood in the County of Somerset, Esquire, was born at ; died at , Feb- ruary 17th, 1612 [0. S.], and was buried in the sepul- chre of his family in the churchyard of Buckfastleigh on March 4th, 1612 [0. S.]. He married prior to 1581, Su- sannah, daughter of John Peter of in the Parish of Buckfastleigh aforesaid Esquire. She was born at ; died at Buckfastleigh August 7th, 1597, and was buried in the Cabell sepulchre there. She was related to the very celebrated Sir William Peter (or Petre), Secretary of State under Henry VIII. , Edward VI., Mary and Elizabeth. A man of wonderful tact. ' Under Henry \" he observed his humour ; ' in Edward's time \" kept the law ; \" in Mary's \" intended wholly State affairs ; ' and in Elizabeth's was \" religious.\" As one of ' the visitors ' he acquired, and had wit enough to keep, a great deal of wealth in the disso- lution of the religious houses.\" Westcote, in his history of Devonshire, written about 1630-1640, says : \" Buckfast, Buckfaster, or Buckfastleigh, where Duke Alford erected a fair Abbey of White Monks of the Cistercian Order, dedicating it to the Blessed Vir- gin : valued at the surrender at ,Â£466 lis 2od, where now is to be seen the skeleton of a huge body, where the lM A captain in the Indian army, Captain Sprye devoted many years to Madras Presidency, and in 1833, dep- collecting material for a history of the uty judge-advocate-general of its Parliamentary families of his native Northern Division ; son of the Rev. county, Devon.

Now [1630-40] the possession of Cabell.\" Worth, in his history of Devonshire (1886), says : \" The Abbey of Buckfast, Buckfastleigk, or, as in 'Domesday,' Buckfestre, is a foundation of great age, one of the very few religious houses in Devon which had existence before the Conquest. The early history of Buckfast is lost in remote antiquity ; but the monks claimed, in the reign of Edward I., to hold the manor of Zele Monachorum by the gift of Cnut ; and ' Domesday ' shows the Abbey a flourish- ing institution with considerable possessions. . . . Origi- nally, so far as can be ascertained, Benedictine, Buckfast, became a daughter-house of Savigny, united to the Cis- tercian Order in 1148. . . . The last abbot was Gabriel Doune or Downe, who was appointed in 1535, and sur- rendered in February, 1538. He was probably ' the author of the plan which resulted in the capture, imprisonment, and death of Tyndale ; ' and Mr. J. Brooking Rowe thinks that he was foisted upon the monks of Buckfast better to carry out the designs of the King. . . . The remains of the Abbey, with the modern house built upon the site and in part with its materials, are now (1886) once more the home of monks of the Benedictine order, who are success- fully engaged in its reconstruction upon the ancient lines.\" Mr. Worth says that the Abbey and the adjacent lands were at one time \" the property of Sir Richard Baker, the historian.\" But should this not be Sir Richard Baker, the uncle of the historian, and one of the executors of Sir William Peter? Richard Cabell and Susannah Peter, his wife, had two sons, Richard (of whom hereafter) and Samuel, and three daughters. Richard Cabell, the eldest son, matriculated at Exeter Col- lege, Oxford, December 12, 1600, aged 18 ; was a student of the Middle Temple in 1604, as son and heir of Richard of Buckfastleigh, Devon, gentleman. He succeeded his father at his death in 1613 ; was arrested with other gentlemen by 14 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN writ out of the Honorable Court of Star Chamber in 1614 (Devon's Issues of the Exchequer, p. 171) ; in 1618 he held the manor of Maynebow in Warnecombe, County Somer- set, and in the same year he bought of John Caseleigh one quarter of the lands that this John held in Bowdon, Colleton, Buckfastleigh, and Ashburton ; in 1620 he gave in the pedigree of his family at the Herald's Visitation of Devonshire ; in 1639 he lent to Sir Henry Rosewell of Forde County, Devon, Knight, the sum of Â£2500, which must have been at that time a very considerable sum of money. In the original deed he is styled \" Ricardus Ca- bell de Brooke.\" Sir Henry Rosewell was one of the original grantees in 1628 of the company of the Massachu- setts Bay. From the \" Transactions of the American Anti- quarian Society,\" Vol. III., pp. xlv., etc., I extract : \" The position of Roswell, as a man of wealth, is indicated by an- other circumstance. In 1639, while Charles I. was on his way to suppress the rebellion in Scotland, the Privy Coun- cil made out a list of persons ' fit for their ability to lend the King money.' Some contributed ; others excused them- selves on the ground of previous contributions ; others took no notice of the requisition. Among the latter we find the name of Sir Henry Roswell, of Devonshire.\" If Sir Henry did not borrow the money from Cabell for the King, he may have borrowed it for use in founding Massachusetts. On January 29, 1642 (?), Richard Cabell and his bro- ther, Samuel Cabell, as church wardens, certified that \"the thirtye nine articles were publiquely read in the Church at Buckfastleigh by the Vicar.\" \" Richard Cabell of Brooke, Esq, died Augt 24th, 1655, and was buried in the family sepulchre at Buckfastleigh on Augt. 25th 1655.\" He married prior to 1620, Maria, daughter of George Prestwood of Whitcombe, in the parish of North Huish in the county of Devon, Esquire, by his wife, the daughter of Sir Nicholas Martyn, Knight of Oxton, in that shire, M. P. for the county of Devon, in the long Par- IN ENGLAND 15 liament, in whose daughter's house [Mrs. George Prest- wood's?], in Watlin Street, London, the five members were concealed when King Charles followed them into the city. Sir Nicholas Martyn was knighted in 1625, and was sheriff of Devon in 1640. Richard Cabell of Brooke, Esq., and Maria Prestwood, his wife, had issue two daughters and five sons, i. Richard, eldest son and heir, of whom hereafter. ii. Samuel, 2d son, baptized at Buckfastleigh, May 4, 1623. iii. George, 3d son, baptized at Buckfastleigh, September 15, 1628 ; buried there March 8, 1631. iv. William, 4th son, baptized at Buckfastleigh, January 4, 1630 [0. S.]. [Whom I believe to be the ancestor of Dr. William Cabell of Virginia.] v. John, 5th son, baptized at Buckfastleigh, December 27, 1636. Richard Cabell, the eldest son and heir, matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, November 15, 1639, aged 19; son of Richard of Buckfastleigh, Devon, Armierer. He was of the Middle Temple, 1649 ; was sheriff of Devon- shire (various authorities give the various dates, 1658, 1664, and 1670). I do not know which is the correct date. He may have been sheriff more than once. I have an original receipt, dated December 28, 1669, showing that he paid George Reynell of Malston in the county of Devon, Esq., Â£104, on that day. In 1672, he gave Â£20 towards constructing the pile of buildings between the public gate and the chapel of Exeter College at Oxford. He was living in 1675. (See Lyson's Devonshire, vol. vi. \" Cabell of Buckfastleigh. About six descents ; not ex- tinct in 1675. Arms : Sable, a Horse upright, Argent : bridled Or.\") He died prior to 1693. He married in Janu- ary, 165*, Elizabeth, 2d daughter of the Rt. Hon. Sir Ed- mond Fowell of Fowell's Comb, in the parish of Ug- borough in the county of Devon, Knight and Baronet, and M. P. for the Shire, by Margaret, his wife, sister of John, 16 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN the first Lord Paulett of Hinton St. George in the county of Somerset. Elizabeth Fowell was born at Fowell's Comb ; bap- tized at Ugborough, September 6, 1622. The purpose of marriage between herself and Richard Cabell was pub- lished in the parish church of Ugborough on the 14th, 21st, and 28th days of October, 1655, without exception, and they were married by a Justice on January 2, and by the Vicar on January 7 following ; she died , and was buried in linen September 17, 1686, at Buckfastleigh. Her father, Sir Edmond Fowell, of a very ancient Anglo- Saxon family, was born at Fowell's Comb in 1593 ; knighted at the Palace of Greenwich by James I., November 3, 1619 ; elected M. P. for Ashburton in the long Parlia- ment, and for the county of Devon in 1656. He was also one of the Parliamentary committee and deputy lieu- tenants of that shire, and was president of the commit- tee for sequestration. He was created a Baronet April 30, 1661. He died in October, 1674, aged eighty-one. (See Burke's Extinct Baronetcies.) His wife, Margaret Paulett, was a sister to Capt. Thomas Paulett of Virginia (see The Genesis of the United States, p. 962), and first cousin to Francis Lord Norreys of the Virginia Company of London. Richard Cabell of Brooke, Esq., and Elizabeth Fowell, his wife, had at least two sons (Richard and George), both of whom died without issue ; and their daughter, Elizabeth, became the sole heir to their property. Elizabeth Cabell, the eldest child and final heir, was born at , November 12, 1656, and baptized at Buck- fastleigh, December 9, 1656. There is a long account of some of her troubles in the \"Account of the house of D'Oyly, by William D'Oyly Bailey, London, 1845.\" Sir John D'Oyly, the first baronet, by Margaret, his wife, daughter of Sir Richard Cholmley of Whitby Abbey, in Yorkshire, had issue twelve children. About 1692, he was in quest of a wealthy heiress for his eldest son, Chohn- [onde]ley D'Oyly of Cheslehampton, Oxfordshire, to replen- > 111 CO CO < 3 u IN ENGLAND 17 ish the empty coffers of the family. \" Soon after, Sir John D'Oyly met with a wealthy heiress for his son, viz : Eliza- beth, only child of Richard Cabell, Esq., of Brooke County Devon, heiress to him, and eventually also to her uncle, Samuel Cabell, Esq., of South Petterton, Somersetshire. The lady was an heiress of landed property to the amount of Â£20,000, besides a considerable personal estate, and the intrigues by which her marriage with Cholmley D'Oyly was brought about, could scarcely be exceeded in skill and contrivance by the imagination of the novelists of the pre- sent day.\" They were married in August, 1693, and Cholmley D'Oyly bound himself to pay to his father the sum of Â£10,000 out of his wife's estate. But the worst of it Avas, \" this gay young man \" had previously (in May, 1692) privately married Margaret, daughter of Rev. An- drew Needham of Beverston, Gloucestershire ; which mar- riage \" was preserved a profound secret 'till Cholmley D'Oyly's death.\" In the language of Mr. Bailey, \"both wives were bring;inÂ£ him children at the same time.\" He had two sons by Elizabeth Cabell, both of whom pre- deceased him. The eldest was named Cabell D'Oyly. \" Cholmley D'Oyly died about March 19, [%%> much in debt and having two wives. It may be supposed a pretty tumult ensued. Old Needham immediately went to his widow, Elizabeth, and divulged her husband's marriage with his daughter Margaret, who then put in claims for a dower.\" Elizabeth immediately possessed herself of all his property she was able, and then commenced chancery proceedings to upset the settlements made on her mar- riage. About 1701, she married secondly Richard Fownes, Jr., Esq., of Stapleton, County Dorset (see Burke's Com- moners, Vol. I.), and \"with this gentleman she engaged in all her proceedings against the D'Oylys.\" But it is needless to wade through the details of these disgraceful proceedings. The Fownes were at last completely beaten ; firstly, by a decree of dismission in the Court of Chancery, March 1, 1703, from which they appealed in November, 18 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN 1704, to the House oÂ£ Lords ; and, secondly, by a dismis- sion of their petition and appeal by the Lords in January, 1705, thus ending the contest in favor of the D'Oylys. The Fownes had to pay the Â£10,000 to Sir John D'Oyly, as well as the heavy costs of the long suit. In 1715, Richard Fownes, Esq., and Elizabeth (Cabell), his wife, sold property in Frome-Selwood to George Hooj^er and others, and on September 20, 1721, William (the Virginia emigrant) and his brother, Joseph Cabell, by indenture relinquished any claims which they might have on this property. This indenture is not now to be found preserved in full in the papers of Dr. William Cabell, the emigrant ; but it is referred to in an indenture of July 20, 1731, which has been preserved. It shows a relation- ship to the Cabells of Buckfastleigh, and it shows that he was still in England (had not settled in Virginia) in Sep- tember, 1721. It may be that he was then making his arrangements to emigrate. I do not know when Elizabeth Cabell and Richard Fownes, her husband, died ; but in 1739 and 1744, their son, Thomas Fownes, was selling off the old Cabell estates â \"for payment of his and his father's debts\" â near Frome and Warminster. And in 1758, he sold the seats of the family, \"The Manor of Brooke Mainbow, with Buck- fastleigh and Button,\" to Sir Thomas Clarke, Master of the Rolls, who gave it to the Earl of Macclesfield. Samuel Cabell, the 2d son of Richard and Maria Prest- wood Cabell of Buckfastleigh, died at South Petterton in Somersetshire, in April, 1699, without issue. He owned lands in Devon, Somerset, and Wilts, some of which were in the parishes of Frome and Warminster. One of his heirs, his nephew, Samuel Wotton, Esq., of Englebourne, Devon, married a daughter of Sir John D'Oyly, who seems to have had a special eye on the old Cabell estates. William Cabell, the 4th son, and John Cabell, the 5th son of Richard and Maria Prestwood Cabell of Buckfast- leigh, have not been located with certainty by me ; but, as IN ENGLAND \" 19 I have said, I believe that the 4th son was the William Ca- bell who settled at or near Warminster about 1664. Not only because the Buckfastleigh Cabells owned land in War- minster parish, and Dr. William Cabell was in some way related to Mrs. Richard Fownes ; but, also, because the late Benjamin Bond Cabbell (1781-1874) of Cromer Hall, Norfolk (F. R. S., J. P., M. P., etc.), a man well versed in his own genealogy, not only claimed descent from Buck- fastleigh (see Burke's Landed Gentry), but, also, that the emigrant to America was of the same family as his. Ac- cording to one account, he said that the emigrant was \" his grandfather's brother;' 5 according to another, \"his grand- father's cousin.\" We find William Cabell, and Mary, his wife, living near Warminster, probably at \" Bugley,\" in 1664. They were then the parents of seven children. William Cabell was buried at Warminster, September 4, 1704. A copy of the inventory of his household chattels (valued at Â£321), taken September 29 following, was found among Dr. William Ca- bell's papers. His widow, Mary Cabell, was buried at Warminster, December 5, 1704. Her will, dated September 29, 1704, and proved in the court of the Archdeacon of Sarum (Salisbury), left remembrances to all of her sur- viving children and grandchildren. Her sons were : 1, Wil- liam ; 2, Anthony ; 3, Christojiher ; and, 4, Nicholas. William, the eldest son, never married. He died in De- cember, 1734, and his sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Yeatman, administered on his estate ; she died in February, 1739, and on May 23, 1739, Dr. William Cabell of Virginia, then in England, gave bond \"to administer on his [Wil- liam's] effects, left unadministered on by Mrs. Elizabeth Yeatman.\" Anthony, the 2d son, married twice, but left no chil- dren. Christopher, the 3d son, baptized at Warminster, Feb- ruary 21, I665, had a son John, who, in 1765, made some claim to Bugley, near Warminster, England, then the prop- 20 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN erty of Dr. William Cabell of Virginia ; but, on exami- nation, the claim proved to be invalid. I have some reason to think that this John was Benjamin Bond Cabbell's grandfather (he spelt the name with two b's, as the War- minster Cabells usually did), and that he was the father of John Cabbell of Warminster, afterwards Mayor of Taunton, and justice of the peace for Somerset. He was a doctor ; married Mary Burridge. His son, William Burridge Cab- bell, banker, of Glasgow, was the father of John Bond Cabbell (1808-1878), who was the heir to his cousin, Ben- jamin Bond Cabbell of Cromer Hall, whose three elder brothers, Richard (a soldier), Thomas (a lawyer), and George (a doctor), had all died before him, without issue. Nicholas, the 4th son, was baptized at Warminster, England, May 29, 1667; \"died July 30, 1730, aged 64\" (from mourning ring); buried at Warminster, Au- gust 2, 1730 ; inventory taken September 11, 1730, of his household chattels, valued at ,Â£375 ; will dated July 9, 1730, was proved in the court of the Archdeacon of Sarum, October 26, 1730. He married at Frome-Selwood (it may be in the Cabell chapel of St. Nicholas there) on Novem- ber 15, 1697, Rachel Hooper, daughter of George Hooper of Frome. She was buried at Warminster, October 27, 1737, and the inventory of her household chattels was taken November 11 following. She died intestate, and her estate was administered on by her \" eldest son, William Cabell of Virginia, who was then in England. His father's household chattels were valued at <Â£375, equivalent to about $7,000 in present values, and he owned a place called \" Bugley, near Warminster \" ; a small property called \" Little Colledge \" ; certain \" houses and lands at Frome,\" a small freehold estate at Road in the Parish of North Bradley, near Frome ; and other property which has not been located by me ; neither have I any idea as to the value of it. He was probably a dissenter from the church of England. The Rev. Charles Herbert Mayo says : \" Just at this time (1690-1720) there were some separate pages in IN ENGLAND 21 the Register for the ' Births and Bcqrfisms of the Chil- dren of Dissenters ' â a thing I have never noticed in a Register before â and here I found the children of Nicholas Cabell.\" They were: â i. William, b. August 24, 1698 ; d. December 8 (buried December 12), 1698. ii. William \\ b. March 9, 1699 [i. e., March 20th, 1700, present style]. He emigrated to Virginia. iii. Joanna, b. February 16, 1702; d. July 2, 1728. iv. Mary, b. December 21, 1704 ; married Mr. Christopher Carter. He died in 1771. Dr. Cabell corre- sponded with him. v. Joseph 1 , b. March 14, 170?, of whom hereafter. vi. Elizabeth, b. July 5, 1709 ; d. October 12, 1709. vii. Sarah, b. December 26, 1710 ; buried August 9, 1715. viii. Elizabeth, b. January 30, 171| ; d. 1741 ; married Mr. Davis of Wilts or Somerset. ix. Sarah, b. August 6, 1715. John Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester, was born in Somer- setshire in 1495 ; an English reformer and Protestant martyr, he was burned at the stake in 1553. He left a daughter, Rachel Hooper ; and Rachel Hooper, who married Nicholas Cabell in 1697, was probably of the same family ; but I have made no effort to trace back her ancestry. Her father, George Hooper the elder, was living in or near Frome in Somersetshire in 1693. Her brother, Hugh Hooper, had a son, Joseph Hooper, who settled in Gooch- land County, Virginia, probably near Hooper's Rock, prior to 1729. I have made no effort to trace his descendants. Her sister, Elizabeth Hooper, married first Mr. Joseph Mayo, and secondly Mr. Styles. Two of her sons by her first marriage, William and Joseph Mayo, emigrated to Vir- ginia. I have collected a great deal about their descendants. Mrs. Styles died May 20, 1740, when her nephew, Dr. Wil- liam Cabell, was in England, and he looked after the inter- ests of her sons, William and Joseph Mayo, in the settlement 22 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN of her estate. Mrs. Rachel Cabell's sister, Joan Hooper, married first Mr. Rundell, and secondly Mr. Edward Grant of Trowbridge. She died without issue in February, 1733. She was a woman of large means in her own right, and left legacies to her numerous kin and to divers chari- ties, amounting in present values to over $50,000, and \" the residue of her estate as sister Rachel Cabell shall direct.\" She left to her four nephews in Virginia about $3,000 each. Her sister, Rachel Cabell, was the adminis- tratrix of her will, and after Mrs. Cabell's death in 1737, Dr. William Cabell attended to the winding up of that estate also ; and papers relative to all these estates were preserved by him. He also preserved two printed sermons among these papers, one a funeral sermon on his aunt, Susannah Hooper, who married, about 1690, Mr. John Allen of Frome, and died prior to 1729. The title-page and first leaf being now missing, the name of the preacher and date of his sermon do not appear. He spoke of her in terms of the highest praise. He said: \"Like Saul, she was the Head and Shoulders above the common level of Christians,\" etc. \" I must in justice to the deceased, and to the Glory of God declare ; that by the Praise of God uttered from her lips, my Soul hath been often refreshed ; she was a kind and unwearied monitor to me in my youth. . . . That I so early begun with God, and ingaged in the work I am now imployed in, was, in a great measure, owing to her faithful discharge of this duty,\" etc. The other, \"A sermon preached at Haresfleld in the County of Gloucester ; by the late Reverend Mr. Richard Capell, Vicar of Haresfleld,\" was printed in 1727. In old characters and in faded ink, there is written on this, \" Mr. Richard Cabell's sermon.\" He died at Haresfield in 1712, aged 63. He was probably a nephew of the Rev. Daniel Capel, theologian and physician, who died in 1679, and a grandson to Rev. Richard Capel, who died in 1656, aged 75, a celebrated divine and physician. His grandson, IN ENGLAND 23 Samuel Capel, Esq., married, about 1710, Miss Mayo, the sole heiress of \" The Grove, Painswick,\" County Gloucester. The Rev. Richard Capel (1581-1656) and his son, Rev. Daniel Capel, are classed as Puritan divines. They gave up their livings for nonconformity to the Established Church, and practiced medicine. The Rev. Richard Capell (1649- 1712), Vicar of Haresfield, was a member of the Church of England ; but his views seem to have been very liberal. Nicholas Cabell may have been a follower of these Capells or Cabells, and this fact may account for the entering of his children among the dissenters in the parish register. And the facts that Richard Cabell of Buckfastleierh lent Sir Henry Roswell Â£2,500 in 1639, 'and that the Puritans spared the arms of the family in the window of the chapel at Frome in 1649-1659, go to show that the Cabells may have been regarded as what was then considered liberal in their views. At the same time it must be remembered that Richard Cabell of Buckfastleiffh was a church warden of the Church of England, and that Nicholas Cabell of Bugley evidently became a member of that church before his death. His kin, the Hoopers and the Mayos, were also of that church. William Mayo, the elder brother of Joseph Mayo, the first husband of Dr. William Cabell's aunt, Elizabeth Hooper, was M. A. of New College, Ox- ford, and Vicar of Romsey, Hants, and his uncle, Joseph Mayo, who matriculated at Oxford, May 31, 1655, was also a minister of the Church of England. A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF DR. 1 WM. CABELL'S YOUNGER BROTHER, JOSEPH \\ AND HIS DESCENDANTS IN ENGLAND. Joseph 1 Cabell of Warminster, England, m. (1st) 9th Novr, 1730, Miss Prudence Colton, and had by her 2 daus, both of whom married. She d. 22. Dec, 1737. Joseph l Cabell, m. (2nd) 3rd July, 1738, Miss Isabella Harris. She died 4. Augt, 1740, s. p. Joseph 1 Cabell, m. (3rd) Miss Anne (date of m. and 24 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN\" surname of wife not known to me). She d. in Jan'y, 1777. He d. 10. July, 1762, leaving by his last wife 2 sons and 2 daus. (1) William 2 and (2) Joseph, Elizabeth and Mary. I know nothing of the daughters. Of the sons, (2) Joseph had a correspondence with Col. William Cabell of Union Hill after the Revolution, with reference to \" the estate at Bugley which your father left in the hands of several Trus- tees, all of whom are now dead,\" etc. He was empowered to wind up the estate for the American heirs. They wished him to buy it himself, \" because it had been so long in the family ; \" but he sold it to others. In 1805, himself and wife were living near Bradford in Wiltshire, England. He was b. 11. June, 1753, and d. 17. Nov., 1827. I do not know that he left descendants. (1) William 2 Cabell, his elder brother, was b. 21. March, 174|, in the parish of North Bradley, Wiltshire ; went to London in 1760 and entered a school at Black-heath. On reaching manhood, he went into the mercantile business, but failed, and about 1771 became a clerk at the East India House. \"The various attempts which had been made to bring the East Indian possessions under the more immediate management of the State, after greatly agitating the Public mind, and occasioning a total change of ministry, at length terminated in the institution [Sept. 3rd, 1784] of a Board of Com- missioners for the affairs of India. This Board consisted of the first officers of the State ; but the\" most active mem- ber was the Right Hon'ble Henry Dundas.\" Mr. Cabell, on account of his especial competency, was selected as clerk to this new commission, in September, 1784, and \" was continually about Mr. Dundas, who always employed him in the most confidential manner.\" On the death of Mr. Beau- foy, the secretary, in 1794, Mr. Cabell was appointed chief clerk ; and in January, 1797, he succeeded Mr. Bradley as assistant secretary, in which station he continued until his death, May 23, 1800. \" Mr. Cabell had a memory which retained almost everything, and it was so well stored with whatever related to Indian affairs that a leading member of IN ENGLAND 25 the Board denominated him \" The Walking Index to the Board of Control.\" A memoir of him was published in \" The European Magazine and London Review \" for Sep- tember, 1800, with a portrait engraved from a miniature by Mr. Matthews. Henry Dundas, under whom Mr. Cabell served for so long, made his first speech in the House of Commons on February 20, 1775, and it was in opposition to \"Lord North's propositions for conciliating the American colo- nists.\" He was created Viscount Melville in 1802, and died in 1811. (1) William 2 Cabell (1746-1800), m. (1st) Augt 22nd, 1768, Elizabeth Watts; had three children by her, who died young. She d. Aug. 24, 1773. (1) William 2 Cabell, m. (2nd) Sept. 22nd, 1774, Martha Scutt (b. Sept. 11, 1748; d. June 19, 1810), sister of Thomas Scutt of Brighton, Esq., by whom he had thirteen children, but only four lived to marry. vii.

William 3 Cabell, born 30 Dec, 1784 ; was appointed a clerk at the India Office before his father's death. He is frequently favorably mentioned in the minutes of the Board of Commissioners, and in Lord Ellenborough's Diary. He had charge for ten years of the Military Department ; was afterwards appointed to the Secret and Political De- partment ; and then became assistant secretary. In 1841 26 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN his salary was Â£1,200 a year, and he received frequent \" gratuities \" for special services. His health became im- paired about this time, and after a continuous service of over 41 years, he was retired on an annuity of Â£1,000. He died May 29, 1853. He was married on Feb'y 4th, 1826, to Elizabeth Savage (b. 18th April, 1808) at Christ Church, Blackfriars Road, Surrey, by the Rev. Rowland Hill. She was the only daughter of William Henry Savage and Mary Ann Nedriff. She married secondly Alfred Longsdon, Herr Krupp's Lon- don agent ; he died Nov'r 27th, 1893 ; she died Feb'y 22d, 1892.

THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN IN AMERICA. \" What was in its lifetime mere moss, becomes in the lapse of ages, after being buried in its peat bed, of some value as fuel ; it is capable of yielding both light and heat. And so even the most worthless pieces of the literature of a remote period contain in them both instruction and amusement. The historical student should consult such of these as time has spared.\" Arnold. Before continuing the history of the family of which I am writing, it seems well to give the following memoranda of others of the name in America. John Cabell came to New England in 1631 or earlier ; living at Springfield, 1636 ; had son John, b. 12 Jan., 1641, and soon after removed to Fairfield, where both father and son are in the list of freemen in 1669. He m. (2dly) Ann, widow of Roger Betts of Branford. The son, who wrote his name Cable, d. in 1673. Samuel Cabell of New Haven, 1646. George Cabell of Boston, 1695. (See \" Families of New England.\") Some of the name also settled in Maine. (See Eaton's History of Thomaston, Rockland, etc., Maine, p. 170.) George Cable patented 200 acres of land in Milford Haven, Virginia, 25 Nov., 1653. I suppose this to be the George Keeble who was living in Middlesex Co., Va., in 1698, who bore arms somewhat similar to the Capels. John Cable patented 250 acres of land in Lancaster Co., Va., 4 Oct., 1653, and received other patents in 1655 and 1664. Thomas Chapell (Capell in Index) patented 904 acres in Charles City Co.,Va., 21 April, 1690. 32 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN Edward Cabell, a soldier in Capt. Andrew Lewis's Company in Col. George Washington's regiment, was wounded in the Battle of the Meadows, 3 July, 1754. Henry Chaple (Caple in Index) patented 347 acres in Brunswick Co., Va., 14 Feby, 1761. William Cabbie, Jr., patented 1703 acres in Brunswick Co., Va., in 1761. I think that this was Col. William Ca- bell, Sr., of \" Union Hill,\" but I have no conclusive evi- dence that it was. Some of the foregoing evidently left descendants. Dr. William Cabell was not the ancestor of all of the name in America. I find at various later dates a good many of the name in Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, North Carolina, etc., who evidently do not trace back to him. But he was the founder of the family of which I am writing. DR. WILLIAM 1 CABELL, THE FOUNDER OF THE FAMILY IN VIRGINIA. With Some Account of the Earliest Settlement {1726-171 '4) of the Upper Valley of James River. The eminent English historian, the late Edward A. Free- man, in an exhaustive article on Pedigrees and Pedigree- makers, which appeared in \" The Contemporary Review,\" and was reprinted in \" Littell's Living Age \" (July 14, 1877), shows that even Sir Bernard Burke was prone to begin, or introduce, his pedigrees with romance. And this is also the case with many old Virginia pedigrees. In fact, there has been a penchant for beginning with a fairy-tale a history, whether of a nation, of a city, or of a family. And thus, as is so frequently the case in old history and genealogy, we find much romance mixed up with the begin- ning of the old traditional Cabell family history (as well as with the same of many of the kin), and it is not always possible to separate the facts from the fictions. According to tradition, \" Dr. William Cabell, the common IN AMERICA 33 ancestor of the Cabell family in Virginia, was a native of the town of Warminster, England ; but graduated in the Royal College of Medicine and Surgery in the city of Lon- don, and practiced his profession there during several years with distinguished success and with great profit. He then entered the British Navy as a Surgeon, and in that char- acter went to Spain with the forces commanded by the Earl of Peterborough, or Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovel, in the amphibious Spanish campaign of the former. But, how- ever that might have been, it is certain that he was on board of a British man-of-war when an engagement took place with a French ship, which the British captured, and that a splinter, broken from a mast of the vessel by a cannon ball from the enemy's gun, struck him across his forehead and greatly injured one of his eyes, the sight of which was never restored. It produced the singular effect of considerably enlarging the injured eye, and of disfigu- ring his otherwise handsome and benevolent countenance. \" He was a man of science and of some literary preten- sion. There was an engraved likeness of him in a Maga- zine published in London, England, in which the enlarge- ment of the eye was clearly represented. \" The British man-of-war on which he was Surgeon came to Norfolk, or Jamestown, Va., and being detained there for a time, Dr. Cabell got leave of the commander to make an excursion into the interior of the Colony. After visit- ing Williamsburg, he went further up the country, and was so much pleased with what he saw and heard, that he deter- mined to make it his future home. He accordingly re- signed his post, returned to England, married a wife, and after settling his affairs there, immigrated to Virginia. This was about the year 1724 or 1725. \" He appears to have made some stay at first in Williams- burg, afterwards at the Falls of James River (now known as Richmond), and at length to have settled temporarily at Dover in Goochland, where he became a land-owner.\" But little of this collated tradition is traceable farther 34 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN back than his grandchildren. He was certainly not with the Earl of Peterborough in 1705, as he was then only five years old. It seems equally certain that his eye was injured and one side of his face disfigured some years after his settlement in Virginia, by a gun bursting in his hand. The engraved likeness referred to was not of him, but of his nephew, William Cabell, Esq., of the East India Board, which appeared in \" The European Magazine and London Review \" for September, 1800. I am familiar with the ori- gin of this mistake, and it was not an unnatural one under the circumstances ; but it requires some stretch of the imagi- nation to see \" the enlargement of the eye \" in the engrav- ing. The tradition that he was a surgeon in the British Navy, or on some British ship, is probably correct, as it is traceable to his children, and as he practiced that profession from time to time after his settlement in Virginia, and prob- ably acquired his knowledge of it before coming over. I am led by circumstances to think that the brothers Wil- liam and Joseph Mayo, and their first cousins, Dr. William Cabell and Joseph Hooper, came to Virginia about the same time, and about the year 1723 ; and I am sure that Dr. William Cabell did not marry until after his arrival ; but nearly all the data of consequence which I have seen rela- tive to him from 1700 to 1726 is traditional. The records which I have of him begin in 1726, and with them my sketch of him must begin. HENRICO COUNTY. As his whole life, from this date, was identified with the westward growth of this part of our country, it will be necessary to preface my sketch with an outline of the sec- tion prior thereto. In 1634 the Colony of Virginia was divided into eight counties or shires, modeled after the English shires. The county or shire of Henrico then formed had previously re- ceived its name from the celebrated Henry, Prince of Wales, son of James I. It extended from the present west line of IN AMERICA 35 Charles City County to the westward, on both sides of James River, being bounded on the south by the Appomat- tox River, and on the north by the Chickahominy. James River was the central or main artery (so to speak) of this county, which extended through the centre or heart of Vir- ginia. Within its bounds were eleven whole counties of the present day, and parts of three others. The sites of Rich- mond, Lynchburg, Charlottesville, etc., were included. The original boundary lines were sufficient for all pur- poses until 1710, when, some settlements having been made on the north side of James River beyond the head-waters of the Chickahominy, it became a question whether they were in the then county of New Kent (now Hanover), or Hen- rico, and on the 15th of November the House of Burgesses ordered a westward line to be run from the head of the main branch of Chickahominy Swamp, the said line to be equidistant from James River, and from the main branch of the Pamunkey River (South Anna), \" which line shall be adjudged and taken to be the line dividing the said County s.\" The line then run is, I suppose, the present northern boundary of the lower half of the present county of Gooch- land. Henrico County and Parish were in the same bounds. In 1720 the parish was divided into Henrico and St. James parishes, the latter covering the bounds afterwards formed into Goochland County. In those days, Church and State went hand in hand ; a new parish was apt to be the fore- runner of a new county, a new court-house meant a new church. In 1726 we find Dr. William Cabell in St. James Par- ish, Henrico. He was then under-sheriff, or deputy sheriff, to Capt. John Redford, high sheriff of Henrico. The high sheriff, the shire-reeve, was a very important official under the shire system of England and Virginia. The position was generally filled by one of the leading elderly citizens, but the active duties were frequently performed in Virginia by younger men as deputies, under-sheriffs, or 36 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN second sheriffs, as they were variously called. The office is of great antiquity in England. King Edward I. served as high sheriff of Bedford and Buckinghamshire. Many prime peers of the land have graced the place, and the principal gentry in every shire, of most ancient extractions and best estates, were deputed for that place. The duties were chiefly ministerial, the term brief. But the sheriff was, \" by his office, the first man in his county, and supe- rior to any nobleman while he held office.\" The office of lieutenant of a county in Virginia was similar to that of lord-lieutenant of a county in England. He was at the head of the magistracy, the militia, and the yeomanry ; the chief executive authority, forming the settled channel of communication between the government and the civil and military authorities of his county, over both of which he presided as the local representative of the Crown. The right of the Crown to issue such commissions to the lord-lieutenants was denied by the Long Parliament, this question proving the immediate cause of the breach be- tween Charles I. and his subjects. Their legality was reestablished at the Restoration by a declaratory act. This being a new country, for cogent reasons the offices of clerk and surveyor were of peculiar importance. GOOCHLAND COUNTY. In 1728, the settlements having extended so far west- ward as to be inconveniently situated for attendance on the county court at the old Court-House (\" Varina \"), the House of Burgesses determined to form another county from Henrico. Dr. William Cabell had married about two years before this Miss Elizabeth Burks, and they were then living on Licking-Hole Creek, in the upper part of the present Goochland County. The present line between Henrico and Chesterfield, Goochland and Powhatan counties was then run. All east of this line remained in Henrico, and all west of it was made a new county called Goochland (for Governor Gooch). IN AMERICA 37 It was bounded on the south by the Appomattox River, and on the north by the present line between Fluvanna and Louisa counties extended to the Blue Ridge, striking the mountain south of the present \" Brown's Gap.\" The first Goochland County court was held g*?; 1728. The county records from that day to this are fairly well preserved, and they are now in charge of the most compe- tent and obliging clerks in Virginia. The first justices were Col. Thomas Randolph of Tuckahoe, presiding ; John Fleming, Allen Howard, William Mayo, John Woodson, Tarlton Fleming, and Edward Scott. To these were added in 1728-1729, William Cabell, George Payne, and James Holman. Col. Thomas Randolph was the first lieutenant of the county ; Henry Wood, first clerk ; William Mayo, first sur- veyor ; Daniel Stoner, first sheriff, with Thomas Walker as sub-sheriff. Thomas Prosser was first deputy king's attorney. At June court, 1728, it was decided to locate the court- house on the north side of James River, near Atkinson's Ferry, and William Mayo and Allen Howard, gents, were appointed to make necessary arrangements.

At October court, 1729, 1165 tithables were reported in the county. At December court following, Tarlton Flem- ing and William Cabell qualified as coroners of the county, a position requiring medical knowledge. At January court, 1730, a petition for a town at Warwick was presented to the court by William Mayo, gent, and ordered to the Gen- eral Assembly. A proposition was at the same time pre- sented for a town at or near the falls of James River, on the north side of the river. This was the beginning: of Richmond, the natural seaport for the upper valley of the James. The settlers of this section and their descendants were the makers of Richmond. In 1730, Tarlton Fleming qualified as sheriff; William Mayo, as major ; Allen Howard, Henry Wood, and James Holman, as captains. Col. Thomas Randolph died in this year, and Col. John Fleming succeeded him as county lieutenant and presiding justice of the peace. The following justices of the peace were added to the commission from time to time during 1730-1744. In 1730, Daniel Stoner and Anthony Huggatt ; 1731, George Raine ; 1733, James Skelton ; 1734, John Netherland, Isham Randolph, and George Carrington ; 1735, Peter Jef- ferson, Thomas Turpin, William Randolph (of Turkey Island, who d. 1742 ?), Dudley Digges, and Thomas Dick- ins ; 1737, Arthur Hopkins ; 1741, Wade Netherland, Rich- ard Mosby, Nicholas Davies, Isaac Bates, Joseph Thompson, Stephen Bedford, John Hodnett, Charles Lynch, Ben Cocke, and William Megginson ; 1742, James Daniel, William Allen, and John Woodson, Jr. ; 1744, William Randolph (of Tucka- hoe ?), John Cannon, and John Hunter. In 1732, John Fleming and Dudley Digges were the Burgesses; in 1736, Edward Scott and James Holman; in 1740, Capt. James Holman and Capt. Isham Randolph. The sheriffs were John Woodson, 1732-1734; George Payne, 1734-1737; Peter Jefferson, 1737 and 1739; IN AMERICA 39 Robert Payne, 1738 ; Arthur Hopkins, 1739-1741 ; Thomas Turpin, 1741-1743 ; James Daniel, 1743-1744 ; and Isaac Bates, 1744. The James River valley, from the Falls to the Blue Ridge, belonged to the Monacan Indians, known to history as the Tuscaroras, one of the Six Nations. In 1670, their head- quarters in Virginia were near the Forks of James River (now Columbia), and although they had been gradually forced back by the colonists, they continued to frequent their old hunting-grounds for many years, and to hold on most tenaciously to the valleys between the Southwest Mountain range and the east side of the Blue Ridge. One of their last trails east of the Blue Mountains crossed the present ford of James River at Norwood Island (there are remains of Indian towns at this ford, and on the Union Hill estate just below), and went along the valley between the Buffalo Ridge and Findlay's Mountain (known to the first hunters as good hunting-grounds ; to the first settlers as \" The Savannahs \" ; and to us as \" The Glades of Nelson County \") to Rockfish River, and thence up Rockfish valley through Rockfish Gap of the Blue Ridge. There was a buffalo trail along the Southwest Mountains to the waters of the Rappahannock, and the buffaloes seen by Capt. Ar- gall in the spring of 1613 evidently belonged to this trail. During the seventeenth century the settlements were con- fined to the tide-water region. In the first quarter of the eighteenth century they were gradually extended up James River to the threshold of the so-called \"happy hunting- grounds \" of the wary savage, and there, before making an advance into the unbroken forest of \" the broken lands,\" civilization paused for a time in its \" Westward, Ho ! ' : No one, save the boldest paleface hunter, dared \" to beard \" the Indian in his mountain defiles. From May 1, 1728, to May 31, 1730 (two years and one month), Maj. William Mayo only made forty-nine surveys (for forty-three persons) in the county of Goochland, which then extended to the Blue Ridge. There were but few, if any, regular settlers above the mouth of the Rivanna River in 1730. 40 THE CABELLS AND THEIR KIN Dr. William Cabell was the first Englishman to enter the then wild mountain region west of the "
