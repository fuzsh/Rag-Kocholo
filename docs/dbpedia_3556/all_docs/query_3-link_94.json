Alexander Poe of Donegal and of Pennsylvania, bore argent shield and azure fesse and Crescent.\n\nThe Coat of Arms of the Poe family is described as follows:\n\nArms – “or a fesse between three cresents azure, issuing flames, proper.”\n\nCrest – “On a wreath of the colours, a Boar’s head, couped erect or pierced through by a\n\nbroken spear.”\n\nMotto – Malo Mori Quam Foedari\n\nTranslation – “I would rather die than be debased.”\n\nSource: Sir Edmund TK. Bewley – “The Family of Poe” , 1907\n\nName of Poe: Some genealogical researchers consider the surname Poe to be patronymical in origin, that is, taking and using his or her father’s surname Poer, which means ‘poor or poverty stricken as a result of a vow’. Different spellings of the original surname Poe, according to dictionaries of surnames, are Paye, Pea, Po, Poe, Pow, Powe, Pou, Pau, Pough.\n\nAccording to Charles Guarino in “What’s in your name”, he wrote “it could be said that the Poes are proud as Peacocks of their ancestral surname’. He stated “Poe is a nick name derived from the name of a Peacock, one of the most beautiful members of the feathered kingdom”. Furthermore Charles Guarino related: “The name of Peacock was undoubtedly derived from the inn signs which often displayed pictures of the bird upon them. Even today, modern inns and restaurants adorn their signs with the peacock”.\n\nEarly Poe History\n\nThe earliest history of the Poe family was found in Poems and Stories by Anna H. Poe, published by her sister Marianna Poe Brown, 1893. The following story was found in “Poe Pages” Vol. 7, p.4:\n\nAlmost within the shadows of the Alpine summits, as they rise in stately grandeur fifteen thousand feet above sea level, not far from the junction of the Ticino and Po rivers, as they flow onward toward the Adriatic, in the beautiful and fertile basin of the Padus, in the year 1600, stood the ivy-grown and fast decaying columns of the ancient Po homestead. The province of Lombardy had been overrun by succeeding revolutions, each revolution followed by different rulers, and the simplicity of the characteristic industries on the Alpine plantation having, in a degree, passed away, were succeeded by more modern rivals in agriculture, creating a discontent among the older patricians who remained.\n\nThe daughters of the house of Po had, in the last generations, gained a numerical ascendancy, so that at this date all that remained to represent the male line was Gustave Po, in his ninety-second year, and his four grandsons-named, respectively, Felip, Carlos, Adolph and Allesandro. A great aunt of the young men, Madame Polesia, also aged, presided over the household.\n\nOn the Ides of March, same year, Gustave Po and his sister were gathered to their fathers, and were buried within the walls of the great cathedral of Milan, where all of his ancestors and his sons and daughters, with the exception of those lost in battle, were resting in peace.\n\nWithin a few months after their grandfather’s and aunt’s death, the young men sold their estate, divided the proceeds, and took ship for other lands. Felip emigrated to Ireland, Carlos to the isle of Cuba, and Adolph and Allesandro set sail for England. Adolph located at Liverpool, embarked in trade and became wealthy, but died a bachelor. Allesandro settled in the interior, became a farmer, and his name anglicized to Poe legally, married a yeoman’s daughter, and raised a family of five sons. On the death of their father the boys came to America. Adam and Andrew Poe settled in Pennsylvania, near the Ohio river. John Poe, a sea captain, a son-in-law of Admiral McBride of the English Navy, located in the colony of Maryland, near where the city of Baltimore now stands. (John Poe was the great grandfather of Edgar Allen Poe, the author of “The Raven” , of world wide celebrity.) Agustus went to the Carolinas, and Allesandro drove his stake in Spottsylvania, Virginia, and christened the little river which ran through his plantation Poe river.\n\nThe English and Scottish Poe’s\n\nSource: Burke’s “Irish Family Records” and Edmund Bewley’s “Pedigrees of the Poe’s”\n\nRichard Poe: of Poesfield or Sherwood who in 1591 was Under-Keeper to Sir John Byron, Warder of Sherwood Forest and ancestor of Lord Byron. According to Bewley, Richard Poe is believed to have had three sons. One son was James Poe who had a son: Leonard Poe who married Dionisia Boone and was M.D. Physician in Order to King James I and Charles I. Another son Richard Poe also Under-Keeper of Sherwood Forest. The other son of Richard Poe of Poesfield was…\n\nAnthony Poe: Yeoman of Papplewick, Nottinghamshire was baptised 12 June 1593 and whose will was dated 5 January 1605/6 and proved 8 October 1612. He married Alice Frost and he died in 1612 having 3 daughters and 5 sons: William of Derrymore (Manor Poe) d. 1678, Anthony of Skreen Cko. Meath, John ( the second son who inherited the lands at Papplewick), Richard and the third son…\n\nLt. Thomas Poe: of Cloghan, Kingsa Co. Thomas Poe and two of his brothers ( William and Anthony) were attracted to Ireland early in the 17th century where Manors of 2000, 1500 & 1000 acres were created in the Plantation of Ulster subject to the condition that the English & Scotch grantees should plant them with British protestants. Thomas Poe was engaged in raising cattle for sale in Dublin and England. He served as a Lieutenant in Cromwell’s Parlimentary Army to put down the great rebellion which broke out in October 1641. Thomas Poe was plundered by the rebels and lost an estimated 3360 pounds. For his war service he was granted, under the Act of Settlement, 355a.2r.Sp. of land in the Barony of Upper Ormond and County Tipperary in fee–simple subject to the annual quit-rent of 3 pounds and 7 shillings. Thomas Poe also aquired by purchase several lands in the Barony of Lower Ormond. He married Mary (?). His grandson William Poe was appointed an executor of Thomas Poe’s will dated 19 December 1683. Thomas Poe had 3 sons: Richard of Belleen, Thomas of Clonamaghane Kings Co. and Emanuel Poe of Glankeilty ( now Glenahilty) Co. Tipperary.\n\nThe following is from “Edgar Allen Poe The Man” by Mary Elizabeth Phillips and is found in the University of Maryland Library.\n\nThe earliest trace of Poes in Scotland was at Irving, where, in 1540, the church of Irving received a grant of land in the name of Thome Powa. The spelling is Irish and appeared also in Ayrshire in 1540. Varients were Poe, Poa, Pole, Powell, and Pooe, until after 1760, when it was fixed in Ayrshire as Poe.\n\nIn 1667, a number of Scots were forced to leave Scotland following the Pentland Rising (Rullion Green) in 1666. In the Dundonald records, a David Poe in Polkelly, on a farm bordering Fenwick and Stewarton, seven miles from Irvine. On November 21, 1666 he was with others, declared an outlaw by the King’s Herald. On December 4, 1666, this proclamation was read at the Market Cross in the parish church of Irvine. David Poe and others became fugatives, hunted covenanters, hiding in Ayrshire. They were never arrested, but the King had them tried in absence on evidence of witnesses and sentenced them to be hanged. David Poe escaped to Ireland. On October 1, 1667, the King’s pardon was granted to all who had taken part in the late rebellion, but with special exception of David Poe.\n\nIn the early 1600’s William, Thomas and Anthony, of Papplewick, North-Hamptonshire, England, and near kinsmen of Dr. Leonard Poe, settled in County Tyrone, Ireland.\n\nAnthony retained his Tyrone lands and acquired interest in Sudborough Estates in County Fermanagh, Ireland, which he named Manor Poe. In the 1640’s, William and Anthony served as Captains in the Parliamentary Army; William in Cromwell’s regiment. With the rank of Major, he returned to Ireland in 1673, and he died without sons, in 1675. For Anthony’s service in Ireland, he obtained grants of forfeited estates under the Cromwell Settlement and founded Poe Court in County Louth, Ireland. Thomas stood losses in the 1641 Rebellion, served Cromwell’s forces in Ireland, received land grants in Tipparary, and founded several families of Irish Poes. The descent of David Poe of Dring, County Cavan, son of John Poe, seems probable by the records from 1641 Irish Rebellion. (Edgar Allen Poe line).\n\nSir Edmund T. Bewley of Dublin, in his “Family Poe Line”, traces the ancestry of the Poes of Ireland to Anthony Poe of the Manor Papplewick, Northhamptonshire, England. Papplewick was in the neighborhood of Newstead, the seat of the Byrons, and the adjoining Sherwood Forest. Richard Poe was underkeeper of Newstead and Blydeworth, under Sir John Byron in 1591. This Richard Poe was the only child of Richard Poe, eldest son of William Poe, both of Hoveringham. William Poe’s will was dated July 15, 1557, and his son Richard’s will was dated May 31, 1564. Besides Richard, William Poe named two other sons in his will, Edmond and Thomas.\n\nRichard Poe was underkeeper as of May 28, 1540, to Sir John Byron (whose father was granted Letters Patent to the Manor Papplewick). Anthony Poe, yeoman, was one of the tenents of Papplewick when he made his will in January, 1605. He was the grandson of William Poe of Hoveringham and a son of either Edmond or Thomas Poe. Dr. Leonard Poe, to whom many pedigree-mongers claim the ancestry of the Poes of Ireland, was his kinsman, probably his nephew. In that case, James Poe of Poesfield in the County of Derby was his brother. This theory is demolished by Dr. Leonard Poe’s burial certificate from which we learn that James Poe, his father, was a son of Richard Poe of Poesfield, Derbyshire. Richard Poe, son of William of Hoveringham, Nottingham, had only one son, Richard the underkeeper. The Poes of the counties of Nottingham and Derby were, no doubt, kinsmen, but there is not enough data at hand to establish a closer relationship.\n\nAnthony Poe of Papplewick died before 1612. His wife was Alice Frost. His children were William, John, Thomas, Richard, Anthony, Alice, Anne and Elizabeth. Three of these sons, William, Thomas and Anthony went to Ireland to the Plantation of Ulster. John, the second son, was given the unexpired lease of his father’s home. Of Richard, nothing has been learned. A Richard Poe is found married in the parish of Newark-on Trent, June 9, 1631, to Mary Laurence, and he may have been the one.\n\nWilliam Poe, eldest son of Anthony Poe of Papplewick went to Ireland and married his first wife in 1628. She was Frances, the only daughter of John Sedborough of Mount Sedborough, County Fermanagh. John Sedborough died about the time of Poe’s marriage to his daughter, Frances. This Poe had some court problems. Ostensibly, his object was to discover whether any disloyal subjects were in posession of land belonging to the Crown; but his real object was to obtain for himself a grant of the forfeited lands allotted to his father-in-law before his death. Poe was aquitted by the jury after being charged with being a public disturber of the peace, as oppressor and calumniator of the king’s subjects, and a stirrer-up of strife among them. In 1638, the case was tried again and Poe was found guilty of procuring individuals to impersonate men of value. He was held prisoner in the King’s Bench until 1642, when he was released and became a captain in the Parliamentary army in England.\n\nWilliam Poe was an officer in the Civil War and was given command of a troop of horses. He seemed to have served in Cromwell’s own regiment. In 1645, he was given command of 400 horses, but within a year, his troops suffered so heavily that it was reported as consisting of a captain, a lieutenant, two trumpeters, and three soldiers. He was advanced to rank of Major and continued to live in England until 1673. William Poe’s first wife , Frances, died within a few years of their marriage, and he was married a second time to a woman in England–Mary Jones (she was a widow, but this was her maiden name). In the records of her burial, at St. Giles, Cripplegate, London, she is called Lady Mary Poe. After a long residence in England, William returned to Ireland to continue his fight for the land of his first wife’s father, which he felt should have been handed down to her. He died in 1678, before the case was determined.\n\nWilliam Poe of “Manor Poe” made a will, “considering my great age” dated May 24, 1678, and proved December 8, 1682, naming Mary Poe, the widow, as executrix. In this will he bore himself as a man of wealth and station, and remembered his nephews and nieces with small legacies, though they would never be paid. One of his bequests to his nephew, Richard Poe, son of his brother Thomas, was curious. It bequeathed land that did not belong to William Poe with the stipulation that, when the land was recovered from the heirs of Hugh Lord Greenawley and Charles Bkalfour, it should be assigned as directed.\n\nThe third son of Anthony, Thomas Poe, of Papplewick, went to Ireland as a retainer of Thomas Bklennerhassett, who was an undertaker of 2000 acres of land in the barony of Lurg, County Fermanagh, Ireland. He started with a showing of leases, having obtained many. According to an inquisition taken at Crevenish on April 4, 1627, he had not taken the oath required from the assignees or lessees of his lease. Thereafter (1637 – 1643), he was a grazier at Donegal, County Donegal, and was extensively engaged in the buying and selling of cattle. Poe took service in the Parliamentary army during the Great Rebellion of 1641, serving as a lieutenant until the uprising was suppressed. His place of residence, in December of 1643, is given as “Donegal, County of Donegal,” in a bill of chancery filed by him against Daniel Hutchinson, of Dublin, for a recovery of debt. He finally settled at Cloghan, a village and post-town in the parish of Callen, barony of Carry Castle, Kings County. When the allotment of lands to the soldiers was made, Lieutenant Thomas Poe obtained a grant by Letters Patent, dated March 2, 1667, 210 acres profitable, plantation measure; and 355 acres statute measure, all in County Tipperary. His will was dated December 19, 1683. He lived to be a very old man.\n\nAnthony Poe, youngest son of Anthony Poe of Papplewick, seems to have gone to Ireland about the same time as his brothers, William and Thomas. He settled on the Mervyn estate in County Tyrone. He served in the Parliamentary army as a lieutenant and having attained rank of captain was sent to Derry in 1648. He served until the close of the Irish Rebellion and settled at Skreene, County Meath, where he died in 1654. His will was proved on May 12, 1654. His children were: Daniel, Anthony, and Mary. These names were found among the certificates for adventurers and soldiers.\n\nJohn Poe, second son of Anthony Poe of Papplewick, is only known to us through his father’s will, and the mention of him in the will of his brother, Major William Poe. It is not certain whether he remained in Papplewick, went into Ireland, or emigrated to the provinces of Maryland.\n\nMore than a hundred years later lived David Poe of Dring in the Parish of Kildallon, County Cavan. David is interesting to this genealogy because he was an ancestor of Edgar Allan Poe. He was the great-great grandfather of the poet.\n\nIrish Poe’s\n\n(The Edgar Allen Poe Line)\n\nDavid Poe\n\nThe following information was found in the Archive Library in Raleigh, N. Carolina:\n\nDavid Poe was the son of John and namesake and grandson of David Poe of the Scotch Covenanter of 1667. Father of Alexander, John, and daughter Anne and great-great grandfather of Edgar Allen Poe.\n\nDavid Poe, of Dring, was a tenant farmer of “fair circumstances” on the estate of the Maxwell family. At the turn of the century (1900), the townland of Dring contained 180 acres, 3r. 19p. statute measure, of which 12 acres 2r. 37p. were under water. Between 1720 and 1731 he was one of the overseers of the Parish of Kildallon and at the same period he was a member of the parish vestry. In 1741 he entered into the customary marriage bond of his son John Poe with Jane McBride, of Drumully Parrish, County Fermanagh. Among the court documents of Kimore is the original will of David Poe. His will was made August 25, 1742, and proved September 22, 1742. In his will he named his wife Sarah, his daughter Anne, wife of Archibald Scott; his son Alexander, then in America; Mary Cowan; and his son John. Sarah, his wife, was co-executrix with his daughter Anne. To his son Alexander who settled and improved lands in the Manor Maske, Marsh Creek, Pennsylvania, about 1739, was left s5 sterling. To his son John was give about 42 acres of arable land, sheep, farm and home effects. ( From “Edgar Allan Poe: The Man” by Mary E. Phillips. Copyright 1954 by Mary E. Phillips.)\n\nDavid Poe, Scotch-Irish from the Parish of Fenwick, in Ayrshire, Scotland, intermarried with Allans and Galts. They belonged to the Scotch Protestants who migrated to Ireland, Dring, in Parish of Kildallen, County Cavan.\n\nThe following information is found in “Poe Pages” , Vol. 2, p. 7 and was submitted by Janet M. Kademan, Davenport, Iowa:\n\nDavid Poe’s will, dated Aug. 25, 1742 ( died 1743) describes him as of “Dring Parish of Kildallon, County Cavan, Farmer.” In the old vestry book of Killdallon he is mentioned as the overseer of roads in the parish, and in the minutes of April 12, 1726, he signs himself as “David Pooe”. He married Sara, surname unknown. They had issue: John Poe, 1720-1756, married Jane McBride. Alexander Poe, born in Ireland and emigrated to America. Anne Poe married Archibald Scott.\n\nJohn Poe\n\nSon of David Poe of Dring\n\nThe following information is found in “Poe Pages” , Vol. 2, p. 7 and was submitted by Janet M. Kademan, Davenport, Iowa:\n\nJohn Poe, 1720-1756, son of Sara and David Poe, was born in Ireland, Donegal county, September, 17, 1739; he married Jane McBride of Ballmoney, Antrim, the ceremony being performed by John, Lord Bishop of the Diocese of Cloger. Jane McBride was born 1706 and dies 1802, the daughter of Rev. Robert McBride, and a sister of John McBride that was Admiral of the Blue and Member of Parliament for Plymouth in 1785. They had ten children, three of them born in Ireland. One of these sons was General David Poe, 1742-1816, grandfather of Edgar Allen Poe. John and Jane Poe came to America about 1743 and settled in Lancaster, PA, from whence they moved to Cecil county, MD, and later to Baltimore.\n\nThe following information was found at the Virginia archives: John Poe, younger son of David Poe, of Dring, received at his marriage one third of his father’s holdings and, under the will of his father, as much more as would make up the half, being the fourth part of Dring, together with ten head of sheep and one half of all tackling belonging to the plow. This shows that David Poe’s holdings were only half of the Dring farm. In 1748, John Poe emigrated to America with his family. It is said that he first came to Pennsylvania. It is probable that he spent some time on his brother Alexander’s farm at the Manor of Masque. Later he moved to Cecil County, Maryland. John was married in Ireland in 1741, to Jane McBride, who, it is believed, was a daughter of the Rev. Robert McBride, for many years Presbyterian minister at Ballymoney, and a sister of John McBride, fan admiral in the Royal Navy. John Poe died about 1746, and his wife in 1802. Their children were: *David, George, Jean, Mary and William.\n\nAfter his marriage in 1741, John came into touch with the Presbyterian congregation at Clogher, near Dring. Minus stray leaves, the congregation’s old baptismal register still exists, and give baptismal notes of three of the ten children of John and Jane McBride Poe. Perhaps the missing leaves noted the baptism of David, later grandfather of the poet, who was said to have been born at Dring, Parish of Kildallon, Ireland in 1742. It is agreed that John Poe, his wife and children David and George, then two years old, sailed for the New World about 1748. They landed at Newcastle, Delaware, and went at once to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where he spent some time with his brother Alexander at the Manor of Masque, Marsh Creek, said to have become the site of the Battle of Gettysburg. Thence John Poe took his family to Cecil County, Maryland, and finally to Baltimore City, where he died in 1756. The Baltimore 1776 directory located his widow’s home on German Street between Howard and Hanover. It is said she died July 17, 1802, at age 96, and rests in Lot 129 of Westminster Churchyard, Baltimore. (From “Edgar Allan Poe: The Man” by Mary E. Phillips.

Cavan, Ireland, married Elizabeth Cairnes in PA.\n\n“General” David Poe\n\nSon of John and Jane Poe\n\nThe following information was found in the Virginia archives: David Poe, the oldest son of John and Jane Poe, was born in Dring, parish of Kildallon, County Cavan, Ireland in 1742, and died at Baltimore. As a young man, he was very active in formenting the Revolution. He is credited with being the leader of the mob that ousted Robert Christie, the sheriff, and with being involved in the attack upon the printing office of William Goddard, the libeler of George Washington. He was appointed Quartermaster in Baltimore, November 19, 1777, and served during the war, giving a great deal of his time and monies for the cause. When he grew to be an old man, he was always called General Poe. After the Revolution, General Poe became a merchant in Baltimore and was very successful. David Poe was married to Elizabeth Cairnes of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Elizabeth died on July 7, 1835. David and Elizabeth’s children were: David Jr., Maria, John Hancock, George Washington, *Samuel, and Elizabeth. Maria was born March 17, 1790, and died February, 16, 1871. She was married July 13, 1817, to William Clemm and had a daughter, Virginia, who became the wife of her cousin, Edgar Allan Poe, the famous author.\n\nGeneral David Poe’s wife Elizabeth was of dark-eyed Irish ancestry and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania birth. They soon moved to Baltimore, Maryland. There the courthouse record book, page, 180, first noted, “David Poe, 1 August 1775.” as a witness to a legal paper. From a prior – January 23rd – Baltimore press notice of finding a watch, it is learned that his brother George was then located as living at Fells Point. This section of the city was the landing place for large vessels. David Poe’s first Baltimore business was said to be in a three-story brick structure.\n\nDavid Poe, Jr.\n\nSon of David Poe and Elizabeth Cairnes Poe\n\nThe following was found in the Virginia archives: David Poe, Jr. was born in Baltimore, Maryland about 1784, and died about 1811. He was intended for the legal profession and began his studies in the office of William Gwynn, Esq., but, falling in love with an English actress, a widow, he eloped with her and was disowned by his father. He adopted the stage as a profession, but was not a successful actor. He was married in 1805 to Elizabeth Hopkins, who was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Arnold, singers at Convent Garden Theatre, London. She was brought to the United States with her mother and, as Miss Arnold, became a favorite with American audiences. She died December 8, 1811. There children were: William Henry Leonard Poe, Edgar Poe and Rosalie Poe.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe\n\nSon of David Poe, Jr. and Elizabeth Arnold Poe\n\nFamous Author\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, second son of David, Jr. and Elizabeth Arnold Poe, was born January 19, 1809, and died October 7, 1849. He was married May 16, 1836, to his cousin, Virginia Clemm, daughter of William and Maria Poe Clemm. She was born August, 1822, and died January 30, 1847. They had no children.\n\nAt one time I thought we were directly related to Samuel Poe, son of General David Poe. However, I now believe the relationship goes back to ancestors in England. The dates for General David Poe’s son Samuel do not match up with the dates for theSamuel and Simon Poe we are related to. General Poe’s son, Samuel lived at a later time.\n\nThomas Alexander Poe line:\n\nSamuel Poe\n\nNorth Central England\n\nNottingham and Derbyshire where the\n\nSherwood Forest once stood.\n\nThe following information was taken from “Biographical Studies of Samuel Poe of Essex” written by McDonald Poe, 1900 which I found in the Raleigh, N. Carolina archives. McDonald Poe supplies many assumptions that are not supported by record. It makes a nice story and should be read by all interested in Poe’s just for the experience. I have gleaned the factual record gathered by Mr. Poe and ignored the rest. Mr. Poe suggests, from family legend, that Samuel and Mary Poe were from North Central England somewhere in the area in Nottingham and Derbyshire where the Sherwood Forest once stood. He claims this line is related to Dr. Leonard Poe. Historians relate Leonard Poe as a famous physician of Queen Elizabeth who reined from 1558 to 1603, James I, and Charles I. McDonald Poe says the line is of German origin. As stated on page 54 of Mr. McDonald Poe’s book, no detailed nor established records are available as to why, when or how Samuel Poe departed from England.\n\nSamuel and Mary Poe left their native land and had settled and acquired 800 acres of land by 1704 in Essex County, Virginia. Essex County was incorporated in 1729 into Caroline County, Virginia by the formation of Caroline County out of land areas formerly situated in Essex County and adjoining counties. No written records have been found of the lease and release deed, ordinarily used in land acquisition, of this 800 acres. However, the Quit Rent Rolls of Essex County Virginia for year 1704, Volume 33, page 359, reveal Samuel Poe as owner of 800 acres. Land description of other people’s land adjoining the Samuel Poe land, accurately locate and describe the 800 acre tract abutting Pumensend Swamp.\n\nAccording to court records of Essex County, Virginia, pages 53-55, February 10 1707-8, there appeared a lease and release of Matthew Collins of Essex County, Virginia to Robert Marshall with the 1000 pounds of tobacco as the purchase price, fifty acres, part of the 4200 acres, formerly granted John Meadows and Henry Peters in April 1667, in St. Mary’s Parish. ( By1704, 800 acres of this land was Samuel Poe’s land…by a branch on the north side of the South Fork of Pumensend Swamp. )\n\nOn February 10, 1707-8, Mary, the wife of Matthew Collins, who could not write, relinquished her right of dower to Samuel Poe and in all probability was his daughter.\n\nMary Collins, according to the court minutes of Essex County, Virginia, signed, sealed, and delivered a power of attorney to Samuel Poe to execute a deed and relinquish dower and homestead in certain pieces of property Matthew Collins was selling.\n\nIn Deeds, etc. No. 13, 1707-1711 of Essex County, Virginia, pages 79-81 on February 9 and 10, 1707-8, Samuel Poe acquired from Matthew Collins and wife Mary 105 acres situated in Saint Ann’s Parish. A cash transaction involving tobacco (tobacco was then accepted as a legal tender) recited to be 2000 pounds of tobacco.\n\nLease and release; for 2000 pounds of tobacco.\n\n105 acres, part of 4200 acres granted to John Meadows and Henry Peters by patten (patent) 17 April 1667\n\nin St. Ann’s Parish–Mr. Maccoo’s on the west side of the south fork of Pumensend swamp.\n\ns/Matthew (x) Collins\n\nThis area is north of Pamunkey and Mattaponi Indian’ Reservation and is between Rappahannock and Mattaponi Rivers. The land was relatively near the seashore and the Rappahannock River and was not too far away from Jamestown, Williamsburg and the home site of the Washington’s (Wakefield,birthplace of George Washington and nearby the birthplace of Mary Washington, mother of George Washington), Lees (Stratford Hall, birthplace of Robert E. Lee), and Monroe’s (birthplace of James Monroe). The area had been picked over by more influential settlers, principally the gentry. Samuel Poe’s property was often termed the leaving. Samuel Poe was settled into his home 28 years before the birth of George Washington.\n\nAt a deceased artisan’s estate sale in Essex, County, Virginia in 1704, Samuell (Samuel) Paw (Poe) purchased the artisan’s tools and equipment. The sale price of the equipment and tools exceeded four pounds sterling. In the records of the estate sale he was listed as Captain Paw. It is surmised that Samuel Poe operated a mechanical shop where he made utensils, articles and commonly used instruments and implements needed and sought by the neighboring early colonists.\n\nAt Tappahannock, Essex County, Virginia, the Probate Court records, with other records including the Essex County Archives Records at Richmond, Virginia established Samuel Poe, Sr., died August 17, 1725 and the will was probated and administered in Essex County, Virginia with Frances Browning named executor and the record title changed to the widow Mary. The entire estate was situated in Essex, County, Virginia, including the 905 acres of land on Pumensend Swamp. The children’s given names were not stated in his will. Samuel Poe was referred to as a planter (farmer).\n\nWhen Caroline County was established in 1729, Samuel Poe’s, Sr., lands became a part of Caroline County, Virginia. Mary Poe and her children became citizens and residents of Caroline County. Research was made in Caroline, County Virginia, as well as the records at State Archives at Richmond, Virginia, of all available records, including court minutes, judgments, decrees, deeds, writ of executions, and including “Colonial Caroline” by T. E. Campbell, pertaining to the surviving wife, Mary Poe, and her children and their affairs.\n\nIt is believed Samuel Poe, Sr. and Mary Poe are buried in the Saint Ann’s Parish Church cemetery on U.S. Highway 17, north of Tappahannock Essex County, Virginia. This church was later acquired by the Presbyterians and became Saint Vautier’s Church.\n\nThe research found and established the following sons of Samuel Poe, Sr.:\n\n1. Samuel Poe, Jr.\n\n2. Benjamin Poe, Wife Elizabeth Poe\n\n3. William Poe, Wife Lydia\n\n4. John Poe\n\n5. Robert Poe, Wife Anne Poe\n\n6. Marson (Mossom) Poe, Wife Mary Poe\n\n7. Simon Poe, born c. 1707, Wife Sarah\n\nThe daughter’s identifications are as follows:\n\nThe wife of Francis Browning. He served as administrator of the estate of Samuel Poe of Essex County, Virginia\n\nMary Collins, who granted Samuel Poe a Power of Attorney.\n\nThe wife of John Sutton. He had a lawsuit with Samuel Poe, Jr., in Caroline County, Virginia, circa September 9, 1743.\n\nT.E. Campbell, in his History of Colonial Caroline, page 133, wrote:\n\nThomas Lee, the builder of Stratford and father of the Lees of Revolutionary War fame, was a large planter and trader. He believed that prosperity depended on strict enforcement of the laws to limit the tobacco for export, and in keeping with his belief ordered county courts to force all constables to make oathe that they had visited every plantation in their precincts and determined if the laws stinting the number of plants under cultivation and banning the tending of seconds were being obeyed before paying them for their services. In Caroline, constables George Hoomes and Dudley lost their positions but Herndon changed his mind and in order to keep his post made a careful inspection of his precint and arrested John Smith, Thomas Pittman, Mordecai Abraham, William DeShazo, James Mastin and Titus Stevens for tending seconds. Other constables arrested Simon Poe, William Watson, John Blanton, William Bullard, Barnabas Arthur, Richard Powell and Drury Smith for the same offense. While these charges were pending, John Wiley sponsored a petition asking the royal government to change the law in favor of the small planters and homesteaders. But the Burgesses were not in session and Lee refused to take action. All the accused were fined. The next spring constables rearrested Bullard and Pittman, along with John Daniel and Ann Sanders, for violating the statute stinting the number of tobacco plants which might be set out for tithable, but a jury made up of Caroline small planters and homesteaders, angered by Lee’s attempt at strict enforcement, refused to convict them. Stinting of tobacco had to do with pulling of the spurs off the nearly grown plant and destroying them. Tending seconds was the planting of the spurs and cultivating them as the original plants.\n\nThe following is a list of court records in Caroline County, Virginia:\n\nIn 1749 Simon Poe, Sr., was fined 1000 pounds of tobacco for “tending seconds”. Later he was fined 3000 pounds for failing to obey the law relative to stinting tobacco plants. Samuel Poe, Jr., had similar judgements.\n\nIn the period between 1732 through 1745 Benjamin Poe and William Poe served on the Caroline County Court juries.\n\nWilliam Poe, before the Revolutionary War, circa, in April, 1755, and later was hailed into court for gambling, and once as a witness in a gambling case; and William Poe was charged as engaging in horse racing.\n\nIn 1776 in Caroline County, Virginia, Benjamin Poe was allowed a claim by county court, for nursing his son, a soldier sick on furlough.\n\nIn Caroline County, Virginia, in 1751, Curtis and Peter Poe, the sons of John Blaikley Poe, were taken from him and bound, because John Blaikley Poe was neglectging their education. In 1754 Price Poe, son of John Blaikley Poe, was made an apprentice to a school master, John Beverly Roy, for schooling only.\n\nOn August 9, 1753, on a charge brought by the “Lord and King” against Simon Poe for tending seconds in the jury trial, was fined 3000 pounds of tobacco which was recovered.\n\nSimon Poe, Sr., and Samuel Poe, as early as March 9, 1738, brought suit in trespass, against John Smith. On December 9, 1737, William Poe and his wife, Lydia, (Power of Attorney to Benjamin Poe) game William Taliaferro, gentry, deed of lease and release in Caroline County, Virginia.\n\nAn Elizabeth Bullard sued Marson (Mossom) Poe in Caroline County, Virginia, which suit was dropped in the 1740’s.\n\nOn September 9, 1743, Benjamin Poe was allowed 80 pounds for inspecting roads. Likewise, Sarah Poe (for 1 day witness fee, 25 pounds) along with her husband Simon Poe, Sr., (for 2 days witness fees, 50 pounds) were ordered paid September 9, 1743. This was in the criminal proceeding for tobacco law violations.\n\nOn February 11, 1743, Samuel Poe received a deed from Thomas Bullard and wife Anne and seisen indented to Samuel Poe, Jr.\n\nThe tobacco wars with the large plantation owners eventually caused the Poe families to migrate from Caroline County. By the end of the Revolutionary War all Poe families had left Caroline County.\n\nThe research found these sons surfacing in Caroline County, subsequent to 1729. These sons migrated from Caroline County, Virginia. (1) Simon Poe, Sr., and sons and daughters and inlaws moved into first Orange County, and 1771 into Chatham County, North Carolina; (2) Samuel Poe, Jr., migrated into Prince Edward County, Virginia; (3) Robert Poe and wife, Lucy migrated from Caroline County into Lunenburg County, Virginia; (4) Benjamin Poe, and wife, Elizabeth, left Caroline County, and first moved into Spotsylvania County, Virginia and later into either Wake or Chatham County, North Carolina; (5) Marsom (Mossom) Poe and wife, Mary moved from Caroline County, Virginia, into Spotsylvania County, Virginia; (6) John Poe migrated from Caroline County, Virginia, into Wilkes, later Chatham and back to Wilkes County, North Carolina; and (7) William Poe and wife, Lydia Poe, left from Caroline County, Virginia and moved into Caswell County, North Carolina.\n\nSimon Poe, Sr.\n\nSon of Samuel Poe, Sr. and Mary Poe\n\nThe following information is extracted from McDonald Poe’s book, Biographical Studies of Samuel Poe of Essex:\n\nSimon Poe. Sr. was born in 1707 and died in 1793.\n\nAfter Samuel’s death the Poe boys took over the tobacco farm. However, when Essex County was incorporated by Caroline County, the Lee family who had great influence in the Caroline County government, caused constant problems for the small planters.\n\nSimon Poe married his first wife Sarah whose maiden name is unknown. Simon Poe, Sr. and his wife Sarah are mentioned in Caroline County records as being witnesses in a government criminal proceeding against Samuel Poe, Jr. in 1738.\n\nSimon Poe, Sr. had two sons, Simon Poe, Jr. and Stephen Poe.\n\nIt is assumed that the Poes were disgusted and dissatisfied with the tobacco law enforcement and disheartened with their farm operations and the general situation in Caroline County. Stephen Poe, the son of Simon Poe, Sr. left Virginia and aquired a land grant of 194 acres in 1759, in Orange County, North Carolina. This was known as the Lord Granville Grant. These lands were later incorporated into Chatham County, North Carolina. The chain carrier for the surveyor of Stephen Poe’s first purchase in 1759 was Simon Poe, Jr., who was the son of Simon Poe, Sr. Later in 1761, Simon Poe, Jr. and Simon Poe, Sr. acquired land grants. There are no records of such grants found. After his death in 77, the wife and other executor sold 350 acres of Simon Poe’s, Jr. land. There was a James Poe, a younger son of Simon Poe, Sr. who had a 24 acre tract of land which was bounded and described as adjoining and connected with the Simon Poe’s, Sr. land. The land where the Poe’s settled is on the Haw River and its tributaries in Chatham County, North Carolina.\n\nThere are records of Simon Poe’s connections with the establishment of the church on Deep River Baptist Church on Haw River in North Carolina as early as 1764 which is the date the church was established. This was shortly after he left Caroline County, Virginia. Sarah his first wife may have been deceased by this time because she is not mentioned. There is no record to show if she died before the family moved to North Carolina or afterward. No marker has been found.\n\nWorth S. Ray, in a book titled “Clolonial Granville County, North Carolina, and its People”, page 200, wrote:\n\nDeep River Church in Chatham County North Carolina. Rev. Phillip Mulkey, a Baptist Minister of the ‘Separatist’ persuasion early established a church and congregation on Deep River in what is now Chatham but was then a part of Orange County (1759). Mulkey was born in Halifax County, North Carolina. Those who established the Deep River Church were Phillip Mulkey and wife, Stephen Howard and wife, Joseph Breed and wife, Obediah Howard and wife, Benjamin Gist and wife, Charles Thompson, Thomas Thompson and Rachel Collins. The persons named by the minister Phillip Mulkey, emigrated from Deep River to Fair Forest in S. C. before 1760, but many of the members did not accompany the contingent who moved south, and among those remaining in Chatham County in 1764 were Nathaniel Powell, Conrad Dows and his wife, Isaac Brooks and his wife, Mary Brooks, Mr. Hodge, James Steward, Simon Poe, Robert Callah and Samuel Marsh, also Nihemiae Howard (Journal of Moegan Edward).\n\nThe first court that was held in Chatham County, North Carolina was held in the home of Stephen Poe, the son of Simon Poe, Sr. The court which was moved from Stephen’s home was moved to Pittsboro, Chatham County, North Carolina where a new courthouse was constructed.\n\nTwo of Simon Poe’s sons were active in the militia. In 1773, when the Revolutionary War was the topic of conversation of the people, Stephen Poe, Sr., was the captain and commander of the local militia in Chatham County. Simon Poe, Jr. was a First Lieutenant. It is not known where they got their military training or how long they held such commissions. Mc Donald Poe states that it couldn’t have been long since Simon Poe, Jr. died in February 1773 and his brother Stephen died later the same year. There is nothing to show otherwise than that they died a natural death. Simon Poe’s two sons, Simon, Jr. and Stephen were married and left descendants.\n\nIn the 1790 cencus of Chatham County, North Carolina Simon Poe, Sr. is listed as having three slaves.\n\nSimon Poe, Sr. died in Chatham County in 1793 and his will was probated. He had been married twice and his first wife, Sarah, was the mother of his children. He later married in 1792, a short time before his death, a widowed woman by the name of Rhoda Flowers Marsh. Her maiden name was Flowers. The marriage notice was carried in the North Carolina Gazetteer. It recited that at the time of his marriage his age was 86 years. He had 167 living descendents, including children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n\nSimon Poe, Sr., in making his will, named Stephen Poe, the son of Simon Poe, Jr., as taking his father’s part and that Urlys William Poe, the son of Stephen Poe, took Stephen Poe’s part. Simon Poe, Sr. left several living children. Three of his children, two sons and a daughter, were deceased. William and James and his daughter Frances Poe, who married Robert Thompson, were given their respective parts while Simon Poe was living; and his living children and grandchildren received the remaining part of the estate at his death. Simon Poe, Sr. conveyed to his widow Rhoda Flowers Marsh, who was his second wife, a slave.\n\nSimon Poe Sr.’s will taken from Poe Pages Vol.6, p 13\n\nLast Will and Testament of Simon Poe\n\nFrom records–Chatham County, North Carolina\n\nIn the name of God Amen: I, Simon Poe, of Chatham County, and State of North Carolina, being of sound mind and memory, Blessed be God, do this 9th day of April in the year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred ninety three, make and publish this my last will and testament, in manner and from following, that is to say:\n\nFirst, I give and bequeath to my well beloved wife, Rhoda Poe, one neago girle nemed Weney, one feather bed and furniture, one bay mare, seven years old , one cow and calf, one sow and pigs, one desk and three plates pewter, three knives and forks, ten barrels of corn to be paid this five day of next December, together with one hundred acors of land on Pigs Branch where on the said Rhoda Poe formerly lived on during hur widowhood.

It is not known what the exact date of birth of Simon Poe, Jr. was nor the exact date of his marriage to Sophia, who was his wife, and who survived Simon Poe, Jr. Sophia Poe married Stephen Herndon for her second and last marriage.\n\nThe first established documentary evidence of Simon Poe, Jr. was that he acted as the chain carrier, signing his name Simon Poe, Jr., in the survey in the Lord Granville Grant dated October 23, 1759, where his brother Stephen Poe, aquired 194 acres, which acerage was finally incorporated into Orange County and later Chatham County, North Carolina.\n\nIn 1773, when the Revolutionary War was the topic of conversation of the people, Stephen Poe, Sr., brother of Simon Poe, Jr., was the captain and commander of the local militia in Chatham County. Simon Poe, Jr. was a First Lieutenant. It is not known where they got their military training or how long they held such commissions. Mc Donald Poe states that it couldn’t have been long since Simon Poe, Jr. died in February 1773 and his brother Stephen died later the same year. There is nothing to show otherwise that they died a natural death. Simon Poe’s two sons, Simon, Jr. and Stephen were married and left descendants.\n\nWhen Simon Poe, Jr. died in 1773 his estate was probated in Chatham County, North Carolina, where he was a land owner of 350 acres. No record of a will has been found. Sophia Poe, his widow and Stephen Herndon were appointed administratrix and administrator of the estate. Later Sophia Poe married Stephen Herndon. In the Chatham County Court Record of July 17, 1777 a deed to the Simon Poe, Jr. lands was filed giving over the land to Richard Kennon for the sum of 200 Pounds Current Money.\n\nChatham County Court Records in Pittsboro, North Carolina: Book B page 110\n\nTo all People to Whome the presents shall come, know ye that Stephen Herndon and Sophia Herndon my wife and administratricks to the Estate of Simon Poe Deceased of Chatham County for and in consideration of the Sum of Two Hundred Pounds Current Money to us in hand paid by Richd.

After several years of litigation involving the land and other assets of the estate, David lost the lawsuit. It may have been this family litigation that caused the Simon Poe, Jr.’s children to depart almost en masse from Chatham County, North Carolina.\n\nThe Chatham County Court Minutes (CR 022.301.1)\n\nOn the 10th day of May, 1774, an inventory of the estate of Simon Poe, Jr., deceased, returned, on oath , by Sophia Poe and ordered recorded.

He is the son of Simon Poe, Jr. and Sophia Bradford Poe. He died November 1826 in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri. This Simon Poe was in the 10th N. Carolina Continental Line of the Revolutionary War. This information was taken from the book “Roster of Soldiers from N. Carolina in the American Revolution”. The reference for this book is the North Carolina State Records, Clark, Vol. XVI, 1782-1783. Listed on page 155 is Poe, Simeon, Pt, who was in Brevard’s Company. He enlisted in 1782, served 18 months and Destd 16 Mar. 1783. In the same book it lists the Roll of Capt. Turner’s Company under the command of Col. McDowell from 15 Mar to the 30 day of July, 1779.

In the pre-war years the Poes were slave owners, and some nostalgic feeling concerning that bygone era\n\nmay have influenced their decision to build the style of home.\n\nIt was learned from locals on a visit to Gordonville in 1995 that the Poe house was the William Poe house. Bertha and Harry Poe also lived there. The house and farmground is still owned by the Poe heirs. Harry Poe, Jr. who resides in Houston, TX rents the farm ground to Jerry Lorberg.

An accident occurred where a handcar bumped his leg. It became infected (the family said it turned to cancer) and he wouldn’t have his leg amputated. He died in 1920 just before the rail strike. Minnie Propst Poe remained living in Dupo.\n\nThe following obituary was found in the East St. Louis Journal, November 15, 1920:\n\nPoe\n\nBenjamin M. Poe died at his home in Dupo, IL last night at the age of 62 years. Deceased will be shipped to Brownwood, Mo. this evening for burial.

He is buried at Valhalla Cemetery in Belleville, IL.\n\nThomas A. Poe spent his boyhood years in Allentown, MO which is approximately 5 miles from Delta, MO. The Poe’s were farmers and T.A. Poe or “Alec” helped with the farming. He grew up with an older sister, Flora Poe Dunning (Tom Dunning) born September 23, 1881 and died November 13, 1918, and a younger brother Wilson Poe born 1891 ( married Ruby Prichett). Another child, Alemer was born of this union but little is known of the child. A black woman helped with the household work and the care of the children.\n\nWhen Wilson was chopping wood with an ax, the ax head flew off the handle and hit Alec in the head. The family let it heal without a doctor’s assistance and it left a permanent dent in his skull.\n\nT.A. Poe’s mother died very early in his young life. It is suspected that his mother died in childbirth with Wilson but this has not been proven. Left with three young children, his father married shortly after the death of Margaret. The 1900 census shows his father, Benjamin, married to Marine. His new step-mother, Marine provided a step-sister, Mary Irene Poe Hubbs (Findley Hubbs) born September 1, 1893 and who died July 1, 1951 and is buried in Valhalla Cemetery ( Sec. H, Lot 163, grave 3 ), Belleville, IL. Marine did not live long after the marriage.\n\nBy 1902, T.A. Poe’s father Benjamin had married Minnie Propst. In 1900, a step-brother, Marion C. Poe was born. He married Goldie Gilbert and died March 23, 1963 and is buried at Valhalla Cemetery in the mausoleum, crypt 507. A half-sister, Cora Emaline Poe Breckenridge (Carter Breckenridge ) was born August 12, 1902. Cora died March 25, 1970 and is buried at Valhalla Cemetery, Sec. H, lot 77. Another brother, Harry, was born of this union but died very young.\n\nT.A. Poe enjoyed hunting quail and squirrels. He enjoyed being in the woods and learned to carve whistles out of a piece of sapling.\n\nLater T.A.Poe moved to Brownwood, MO where he lived with his father Benjamin and his step-mother Minnie Poe. As a young man, he was hired by the Frisco Railroad which ran between Cape Girardeau and Poplar Bluff, MO, and worked on the bridge gang.\n\nThe members of the Poe family were General Baptists and were active in their church. In this faith one of the sacraments is foot washing. Minnie Ann Long, who was 16 years and from Greenbriar, also attended the Baptist Church in Brownwood. Here she met T.A. Poe. At the time T.A. Poe was engaged to Minnie Corey, who was Minnie Long’s best friend. However the attraction between T.A. Poe and Minnie Long was strong and they were married October 15, 1915 in Brownwood.\n\nT.A.Poe built a house in Brownwood next to his father, Ben Poe. T.A. Poe continued to work on the bridge gang and Minnie Ann Poe kept house. A son, Paul Alvin Poe was born August 20, 1916. Two years later, a second son, Richard Eugene Poe, was born July 10, 1918. This son died June 21, 1921 and is buried in the Brownwood Cemetery in Brownwood, MO.\n\nIn 1917, during World War I, Alec got a job on the Missouri Pacific Railroad as a switchman in Dupo, IL. The family moved and lived in a flat on Highway #3 near the turn-off for East Carondelet, IL. During the 1920 railroad strike, Alec left the railroad and the family moved back to Brownwood, MO. There, Alec was a sharecroper on a small 40 acre farm where he raised corn and hogs. He farmed the land with a team of mules which he broke himself. They weren’t very well broken and often ran away. Alec made them run faster until they were tired and slowed down. Then he brought them home. Alec farmed this land only one year. It was at this farm where Richard became ill and died within a matter of days. He had symptoms of a cold but no antibiotics were available at that time to prevent death. Minnie, after losing her son so quickly, became depressed and didn’t want to stay at that farm any longer.\n\nThe family moved to one of Mr. Kelch’s farms, one mile away. The family took the mules and a wagon. Alec worked for Kelch at his sawmill. A neighbor, Kitty Ashcraft sold the family skim milk and Paul played with the Ashcraft children. Alec had pointer bird dogs and he like to hunt for quail. Alec grew corn on the farm for the mules but later sold the mules and the wagon and he bought his first Model T (1921).\n\nThe car, an open car with two seats, had carbide lamps on each side of the windshield and a magneto that provided power for the headlights and the ignition. The roads were not paved nor covered with gravel. The car followed deep ruts. Alec let Paul sit on his lap to drive. He tried to teach Minnie to drive but she almost hit a cow on the road and never tried to drive again.\n\nMinnie Poe’s parents lived one mile away in Brownwood. They lived one block from the church and the school on the road to Advance, MO. Later they moved from a two-story house to a large one story house, close to the Union Church, that had a bath but no plumbing. It had a hand pump on a covered porch.\n\nMinnie’s older sister Mary and her husband Lyman Royal lived on a farm near Oran, which is between Advance and Delta, MO. Lyman raised corn with extra large cobs for making corncob pipes. They lived on the farm for a year and then moved to Oran, MO. They had two sons, Gerland, the oldest, and Lyle. Paul Poe is two years older than Gerland and the boys were frequent playmates. The families could travel back and forth on the train and later by Model T.\n\nPaul, Gerland, and Lyle attended the Brownwood school. It was a two-room school divided by upper and lower grades. The desks were two-seaters and when boys were punished they had to sit with a girl. Paul claims he was never punished.\n\nIn 1924, Alec, Minnie and Paul came back to Dupo, IL and moved into the Hall two-room apartment near the Dupo Theatre. Alec’s sister Cora and her husband Carter Breckenridge, who was a railroad brakeman, lived next door. Alec took a job as a section hand on the Missouri Pacific Railroad in Dupo, IL. Leonard Dunning, Alec’s nephew and son of his sister Flora and Tom Dunning, came to live with them and he too worked on the railroad.\n\nAlec and several friends took Leonard to Detroit, MI to look for a job in the auto industry but he couldn’t find an opening. In 1926, Leonard went back to Delta to work for the Frisco Railroad and later quit the railroad and became a carpenter and started building houses.\n\nPaul attended Dupo Elementary School for a couple of years. Then Alec bought two lots in Maplewood (now Cahokia) in the Godin subdivision on Mildred Avenue. Alec built the house that had an outhouse and a hand pump. A daughter, Gladys Helen Poe was born January 21, 1928 at this house. A neighbor, Mrs. Brown helped deliver her.\n\nLater this house burned. During the fire, Minnie was seen carrying an ironing board from the house. It was on fire and a bystander knocked it from her hands. She picked it up again because she had hidden a hundred dollar bill in the cover. The neighbors, the Jim Mutchler family, took the Poe family in. One of Helen’s earliest memories is being led from the burning house to the neighbor’s house. They bought another lot, built a garage, and lived there while they dug a basement by hand, and built a house next door to the burned house. Alec bought materials for the house from the Schellhardt Hardware Store in Dupo as he could afford them. Minnie planted a garden where the burned house stood and said she had the best crop of cucumbers ever. Alec’s sister, Mary and Findley Hubbs built a house next door to the Godin house.\n\nBy this time Alec was working for the Terminal Railroad ( East St. Louis to St. Louis).\n\nIn 1928, a switchman threw a switch and broke Alec’s arm. He got in his car and drove himself to the hospital, had his arm set, and drove himself home.\n\nWhile Alec was working for Phillips 66, he bought several acres near John and Matilda Long in MO and later sold it. Minnie spoke often of a cow named Cherry that they had on the farm.\n\nIn 1935, Alec bought two lots on Jerome Lane next to Jim Mutchler, built a garage, moved into the garage, dug a basement, and built a new home. By this time Alec was working for Phillips 66 Co. Paul was about 14 years old and Alec hired him to build a second home on Jerome Lane in 1938. This is the house the Poe family lived in when Carol was born in 1942.\n\nThe family attended the First Baptist Church in Maplewood. This is the church where Helen was married and where Carol first attended Sunday School. Minnie always bragged that she potty trained Carol at the age of 3 months and took her to Sunday School in silk training pants. Mrs. Gergan was Minnie’s Sunday School teacher.\n\nWhen Carol was about four years old, Alec and Minnie bought three acres of land next door to Gus Hartline, on Imbs Station Road across form Dr. Edgar Wolf. Here he and Minnie raised many vegetables and harvested fruit from the fruit trees Alec planted. They also raised chickens and pigs. A Poe reunion was held at this farm. Alec’s sister Flora’s children, Elvis, Curtis, Leonard, Magdeline and their families attended, as well as, Wilson Poe and his family, Cora Breckenridge and her family, Mary and Findley Hubbs. Alec’s children were also present. Leonard, Elvis and Curtis entertained the group by playing and singing country music. Leonard and Curtis played the “fiddle” and Elvis played the guitar. One song that was popular was called “Sorghum Molasses”.\n\nThe Bob Grimes family visited Alec and Minnie many times out on the bluffs. Bob Grimes was Alec’s boss at Phillips 66. They had a daughter who was Carol’s age. Bob Grimes enjoyed Minnie’s cooking and especially enjoyed potato pancakes.\n\nAlec was living on this farm when he died of a heart attack in 1952. Minnie and Carol remained on the farm. Minnie remained in “her little house on the hill” until several years before her death when she resided with her daughter Helen near Dupo, IL.\n\nPaul Alvin Poe\n\nSon of Thomas Alexander and Minnie Poe\n\nPaul A. Poe was born in Brownwood, MO, Bollinger County on August 20, 1916. He attended elementary school at the Brownwood one room school for a short time. When his parents moved to Dupo, IL, St. Clair County, he attended Dupo Elementary School. Later, when the family moved to Mildred Avenue in Maplewood, IL (now Cahokia), he attended the Maplewood Elementary School on Jerome Lane. Paul was quite scholarly and quickly finished his lessons including working all of the math problems in the eighth grade textbook in a matter of weeks. His teacher made him continue with the class so that he could do well on the scholarship test and earn a college scholarship. This he did with ease. Paul attended Dupo High School and graduated first in his class. Then he went to Normal College (now Illinois State College) in Bloomington, IL, using his teacher scholarship. After graduation he returned to Maplewood to teach. This was a short-lived career because Paul joined the Army Medical Corp to learn to be a pharmacist. It was too stressful to try to teach children you grew up with. Later he was transferred to Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio where he wanted to be a pilot. He couldn’t pass the eye test and decided to go back to college but instead he took a job with Phillips 66 in East St. Louis. He later worked for Phillips 66 in East Chicago. While there he met Margaret Pilotto from East Chicago, IN and they were married July 4, 1941. Paul was recalled to the Air Corp and was sent to Wright Patterson Field in Dayton, OH. He was then transferred to Scott Air Base near Belleville, IL. He enjoyed a twenty-year career in the Air Force and retired as a Major. He received his PhD from USC in 1954. During his career he was stationed in Illinois; Miami, FL, Dayton, OH, Los Angles, CA, Frankfurt, Germany; Fort Worth, TX; Montgomery, AL, and Denver, CO. Paul and Margaret were blessed with three children Tom, Jon, and Jim. Jim was born in Germany. When Paul was transferred to Denver, CO, he and Margaret were divorced. The boys stayed with Margaret and were raised in Prattville, Al near Montgomery, AL.\n\nIn Denver, Paul met and married Gwendlyn Ann Campbell (Metro). Gwen has one son John Metro, who currently resides in Denver, CO. They lived in a townhouse in Denver where Gwen continued her job as a teacher in the Denver Public School System. She was a band instructor and later a special education instructor. For a short time, Paul was a professor for the American University and they lived in Fort Benning, Georgia. They later moved back to Denver and for a time Paul and Gwen operated a private school in Denver for children with learning and eye problems. They moved to Strasburg, Colorado where they currently reside (1998). A son David was born in 1969 and was married to Carin Redding in 1998. Carin and David have two daughters, Rachel and Laura. Paul and Gwen have been active in local community affairs and have instigated many innovative changes in their area. Paul passed away on 4 May 2003 while living in Denver. Gwen passed away one year later of cancer.\n\nGladys Helen Poe\n\nDaughter of Thomas Alexander and Minnie Poe\n\nHelen was born January 21, 1928 at the family home on Mildred Avenue. A neighbor, Mrs. Brown helped with the delivery. One of Helen’s first memories as a toddler is walking away from the family home that was burning. Helen attended Maplewood Elementary School and was a scholarly student. She had a special musical talent and played piano and the oboe in the band. She attended Dupo High School and graduated second in her class. Upon graduation she worked as a secretary at the Swift Packing House in East St. Louis, IL. Helen met Leon Garfield Stepp and they were married at the Maplewood Baptist Church on August 9, 1947 and resided on Minnie Avenue in Dupo, IL. Later they built a house in Sugarloaf Township which is now part of Dupo, IL While living in this house their children David and Barbara were born. David married Judy Saums and they have 2 children Carrie (Brian Schideffer Ch.Savannah, Jaydin and Curt Stepp ( Paula). Barbara married Gary Well and had one child Thomas Wells (Tammi Ch. Savannah, Tristen) and later married Paul Yancey (Ch. Twins Ben and Abby) Helen held important secretarial positions for several banks in St. Louis including the Mercentile Bank. When Leon retired from the Missouri Pacific Railroad, they moved to Winter Haven, FL. Several years later they moved to Columbia, IL, Monroe County where they currently reside (1998). They retain their home in Florida and go there during the winter months. Helen passed away 9 days after her brother Paul on . She was riding with her friend who had a car accident near Helen’s Columbia home. Helen died of a heart attack at the scene. Five years later Leon, who resided in a nursing home in Columbia passed away.\n\nCarol Ann Poe\n\nDaughter of Thomas Alexander and Minnie Poe\n\nCarol Ann Poe was born during World War II, December 27, 1942, at St. Mary’s Hospital in East St. Louis, IL. Dr. Marxer from Dupo, IL delivered. Minnie was 44 years old and Alec was 54. Paul was 27 years older and married and Helen was 15 years older.\n\nThe family lived on Jerome lane until Carol was about five when the moved to Imbs Station Road across from Dr. Edgar Wolf near Dupo, IL. At five years of age she was enrolled in first grade in Dupo Elementary School. She rode a school bus to school.\n\nWhen Carol was nine years old her father Alec Poe died. She and her mother Minnie remained in this home. Carol attended Dupo High School and graduated third in her class of 90 students. She attended Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, IL on a state teacher’s scholarship and lived in Woody Hall. She majored in biology and became a teacher at the Millstadt Consolidated School where she taught sixth, seventh and eighth grade science. She met Frederick Albert Hotz who taught history and geography to seventh and eighth graders at this school. They were engaged by March of this same year and married on June 19th. Fred’s father, who was a United Church of Christ minister married them in his church in Marissa, IL. They rented the old Mehrten’s house next door to Woodroe Baltz in rural Millstadt. They later moved to the Edward’s house on Sager Road. This is where a son, Michael Frederick Hotz, was born. Four years later a daughter, Cathy Ann Hotz was born. In 1972 Fred and Carol moved to 539 Parkview in Millstadt. They bought the Bob Wolz home. While the children were young Carol substituted but did not teach full time. In 1979 Carol started teaching science again at Millstadt Consolidated School until she took early retirement at age 51 in 1994.

I played with Clara Jane Jones next door. (The Jones family lived in the former T.A.Poe house.) ( This family later gave their mixed Collie dog, Toby, to the Poe family when they moved to Imbs Station Road.) Clara Jane was older and took tap dancing lessons. When she came home she taught the steps to me.\n\nI spent many hours playing under the back porch making mudpies with a neighbor boy named Jackie Gilbert. Once at Jackie’s house his Mom let us eat dry Jello.\n\nHelen was a teenager and her friends (Betty Coss, Wilamenia Biesner, Lucille Sackett) often came over to visit. Their favorite activity was to dress me and curl my long blonde banana curls. Then they took me with them to the show down the street. I was so young I usually fell asleep and they had to carry me home.\n\noften Helen caught me getting into her makeup and perfume.\n\nwhen Helen began working she often brought presents home to me. One that is remembered was a tube of plastic that could be blown into large bubbles.\n\nMom and Daddy had a big garden in the backyard in Maplewood.\n\nMom and Daddy planted crops by the sign of the moon using the “Old Farmer’s Almanac”.\n\nThe lawn was cut with a hand push mower.\n\nMom and Daddy liked to grow roses.\n\nBud Pilotto came to visit the family and brought me a large stuffed white dog which I called Pookie and I still have it.

When Helen got back with the pills, Mom and Daddy had to hold me down and even hold my nose to get me to take them.\n\nThe house on Jerorme Lane had a big front porch with a porch swing. As you enter the front door you step into a large living room with a stuffed couch, chair and a radio. From the living room you step through an arch-way into the dining room which had a large dark varnished dining table and a china cabinet and a side table. Straight back from this room was the kitchen. The stairs to the basement were in the kitchen and the back door led to a large back porch.
