HE aim of the publishers of this volume has been to secure for the historic portion thereof 4 I full and accurate information respecting all subjects therein treated, and to present the data thus gathered in a clear and impartial manner. If, as is their hope, they have suc- ceeded in this endeavor, the credit is mainly due to the diligent and exhaustive researches of Hon. A. T. McKelvey, of St. Clairsville, Ohio, whose high character and recognized ability, together with his public services to his State and County, have brought him prominently before the people of this section. Mr. McKelvey has devoted himself to this important task as a labor of love, and his patient and conscientious efforts are conspicuously manifest in every page of the historical narration. Although the purpose of the author was to limit the narrative to the close of 1901, he has deemed it proper to touch on some matters over-lapping into the succeeding year. The wide range and circumstantial thoroughness of this history ar 1,1 1' tilde by a perusal In its preparation, the editor desires to express his acknowledgments to the many friends in every township in the county for valuable assistance rendered, but in an especial sense to Drs. A. II. and Elizabeth Ilewetson for the history of the Belmont County Medical Society, to Edwin and Sarah D. Sears for their aid in preparing the account of the Friends’ Settlement, and to Ellis B. Steele for his instructive sketch of the operation of the “ Underground Railroad.” The reviews of resolute and strenuous lives, which make up the biographical department of the volume, and whose authorship is independent of the history, are admirably adapted to foster local ties, to inculcate civic virtue, and to emphasize the rewards of industry, dominated by intelli- gent purpose. They constitute a most appropriate medium of perpetuating personal annals, and will be of incalculable value to the descendants of those therein commemorated. These sketches, replete with stirring incidents and intense experiences, have been carefully revised by friends or relatives; they will naturally prove to many of the readers of this book a most attractive feature, and will increase in value as the years pass by. In the aggregate of personal memoirs, thus collated, will be found a vivid epitome of the growth of Belmont County, which will fitly supplement the historic statement; for the development of the county is identified with that of the men and women to whom it is attributable. The publishers have endeavored in the preparation of the work to pass over no feature of it slightingly, but to give heed to the minutest details, and thus to invest it with a substantial accuracy which no other treatment would afford. They have given especial prominence to the portraits of representative citizens, which appear throughout this volume, and believe they will prove a most interesting feature of the' work. To all who have kindly aided in the successful production of (he book, by voluntarily contributing most -useful information and data, are tendered most grateful acknowl- edgments. Tin: Ih’Hi.isiiKks.

THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY. History inspires patriotism. It gives a classic character, a romantic value to the scenes of sacrifice and bloodshed enacted by the pioneers in opening up the primeval forest to civilization. No people of any country or age made greater sacrifices for the benefit of posterity than the first settlers of the great North- west Territory. Virginia’s claim to the Northwest Territory, of which Ohio was a part, was based on charters granted by James I of England, bearing date April i, i bob, May 23, 1609, and March 12, 1611, but for 158 years, while not relinquishing her claim, Virginia made little or no effort to exercise authority over it, until Gen. George Rogers Clark, an eminent Virginia soldier during the War of the Revolution, while floating down the beautiful waters of the Ohio, remarked the fertility and wealth of its western bank. Repairing immediately to the old colonial capital of Virginia, he interviewed Gov. Patrick Henry and said a country that is not worth defending is not worth claiming, and thereupon laid before the Governor a com- prehensive plan for capturing the whole Northwest 'Territory from the British and their savage allies. Patrick llenry approved the scheme and the Virginia Legislature ap- propriated £12,000 for its execution. GEN. GEORGE ROGERS CLARK. Thus 25 years before Belmont County was organized Gen. George Rogers Clark of Virginia with less than 300 courageous Vir- •Y/r n't/' !-,'7 CENTENNIAL HISTORY OE BELMONT COUNTY I 2 ginians had captured every British fort in the Northwest Territory, and floated the stars and stripes over their battlements. When the Northwest Territory was thus thrown open to immigration, hundreds poured across the Ohio to occupy the land. Permit me to digress for a moment to speak of the sad fate of this gallant young Vir- ginia soldier, who achieved so much for the people of the Northwest Territory. Judge Burnett, in narrating a visit to Gen. George Rogers Clark before his death, found him poor and broken in spirit, his private property sold for supplies furnished to the needy comrades that followed him to vic- tory. He was a pauper and a bankrupt depend- ing upon his brother’s bounty. Then it was that Virginia sent him a sword in recogni- tion of his gallantry. To his friend Judge Burnett he said: “When my country was in danger I furnished her a sword; when she is in peace and plenty and I am in need of bread, she sends me a sword.” And this Revolu- tionary hero, the conqueror of the North- west Territory, died in poverty. In t888 through the efforts of Senator John Sherman, a national monument was placed above Gen. George Rogers Clark’s humble grave. It was not until the treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain that Great Britain would admit the claim of the United States to the Northwest Territory However, the American commissioners in- sisted upon their claim upon the grounds of its capture by General Clark, and that claim after much contention was admitted by the conference. Previous to this, how- ever, Virginia had organized the Northwest Territory into the county of Illinois, a countv lieutenant was appointed by Gov. Patrick Henry to regulate the unoccupied lands and. following the precedents of the French com- manders in the Northwest Territory, the court granted the settlers 48,000 acres of land and this continued until the cession of the territory to the United States by Vir -ginia in March, 1784, when land grants were forbidden by Congress. Prior to the recovery of the Northwest Territory by General Clark, there had been a long and stubbornly contested war between France and England for the possession of the Ohio lands within the territory, a conten- tion in which the Indian tribes were divided, part being on the side of each contestant England finally conquered, and France by the treaty of 1763 ceded all these Ohio lands to England, who was in turn obliged to cede them to the United States in the treaty of 1783, because of their conquest by General Clark in the War of the Revolution. After the cession of the Northwest Terri- tory by Virginia to the United States, Con- gress continued to pursue the policy of dis- couraging and preventing settlements within its limits until the Indian titles had been extinguished, and the lands were regularly surveyed and ready for sale. As early as 1785 a number of settlement’s were again attempted to be made on the west side of the Ohio, especially along the river front of Belmont County. The gov- ernment at once took action in the matter to prevent them, and finally resorted to force to expel the squatters and destroy their im- provements. The extent and location of these attempts at settlement at that early period within the present limits of Belmont County are shown by the report of Ensign Armstrong, who was sent down the river with a detachment of soldiers for the pur- pose of enforcing the government’s order. In 1785 Congress passed an ordinance for the survey and sale of certain lands in the Northwest Territory, included in which was the territory now known as Belmont County Previous to this, however, many squatters’ claims were effected, cabins built and lands occupied from the Muskingum River east to the Ohio and much trouble was antici- pated, not only with the Indians, who still laid claims to the territory, but because of the conflicting claims of settlers. Doddridge in his notes says: “Our people O' bn : .-.in, i ! 7 ' ; : : ' V ' i . <• . ; 1, '• ' • rl ' , * ! ' 1 ' Of! ! in i . f ■' ><! 1 'JO cr’,\\ I fffty ' >‘5fj ’ HOT* 8> f ! (Kin i 17 /(I 'ofnlrJ f> tinU <It n .'in >ri i AND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS. had become so accustomed to the mode of getting- land by taking it up, that for a long time it was generally believed that the land on the west side of the Ohio would ultimately be disposed of in that way.’' Hence, almost the whole tract between the Ohio and Muskingum was parceled out in “tomahawk” improvements, but these latter improvers did not content themselves with a single 400-acre tract. Many of them laid claim to a greater number of tracts of the very best land, and thus in imagination were as wealthy as a “south sea dream.\" Many of the land jobbers of this class did not content themselves with marking the trees at the usual height, but climbed up the large beech trees, and cut their initials in the bark from 20 to 40 feet from the ground. In con- sequence of the refusal of the settlers along the west banks of the Ohio to remove in obedience to the orders issued by Congress Colonyl Harniar was instructed to send a detachment of troops down the river to eject them by force, and destroy their improve ments. But many of the cabins were re built, and many of the claims re-occupied when the troops departed. This was notably true at Norristown, now Martin’s Ferry, in 1785. Indeed at Norristown there had been formed a little colony consisting of 40 or 50 souls in opposition to Congressional orders and this society had elected Charles Norris and John Carpenter, justices of the peace It was here in 1788 that Capt. Absolem Mar- tin was granted by patent the land upon which Martin’s Ferry now stands, and in 1795 he laid out a town and called it Jeffer- son, but, disappointed in his efforts to secure the county seat, he abandoned the town, be- lieving it could not succeed as a rival of Wheeling. Notwithstanding there were many squatters’ claims established as early as 1780-85 and little colonies had been estab lislied at many points, perhaps the first legal claim was 2,000 acres of land granted Cap- tain Kirkwood by the government of Vir- ginia in appreciation of his gallant services in the Revolutionary War. 13 Of this hero Judge G. L. Cranmer in a recent contribution to the West Virginia Historical Magazine, says: “a revolutionary iiero.” “During a recent visit made by the writer to the rooms of the Delaware Historical So- ciety at Wilmington in that State, among many other interesting curiosities which claimed his attention were the shouldei straps and military sash which were worn by Maj. Robert Kirkwood on that fatal field where the army of General St. Clair was de- feated by the Indians in the month of No- vember, 179 1. “The sight of these mementoes suggested the idea of collecting such data as bore upon the revolutionary life of this worthy and distinguished soldier and patriot in which we have not been altogether unsuccessful, but have secured enough to give a general idea of the deeds and character of the man upon which as upon a firm foundation rests his enduring fame and reputation. “Robert Kirkwood was born in Mill Creek Hundred on a farm near to White Clay Creek Church in the State of Delaware. “At the outbreak of the Revolution he was living with a married sister in Newark, Dela- ware, and was engaged in mercantile pur- suits. “lie abandoned his business before the formal declaration of war which at the time was threatened and enlisted as lieutenant in Col. John Haslet’s regiment, which was mainly composed of members from the coun- ties of Newcastle and Kent. This was in the month of January, 1771. “A few days after the reception of the news of the passage by Congress of the Dec- laration of Independence, orders were re- ceived for his regiment, then at Dover, Dela- ware, to march and report at the headquar- ters of the army, which were then located at New York. Upon its arrival there, it was brigaded with four Pennsylvania regiments and Smallwood’s Maryland regiment. 14 CENTENNIAL HISTORY OF BELMONT COUNTY , “On the 27th of August, 1776, young Kirkwood received his first baptism of lire in the disastrous battle of Long Island, where he showed conspicuous gallantry. The loss of his regiment in this battle amounted to 33 killed, including two officers. “The next general battle in which he was engaged was that of White Plains, followed by that of Trenton, which latter occurred on Christmas day, 1776, where the British loss in killed, wounded and missing amounted to 900 men. Nine days after this occurred the battle of Princeton, where the colonel of his regiment was killed. “Under a resolution of Congress, the quota of the State of Delaware was fixed at one battalion consisting of 800 men. The regiment known as Haslet’s regiment was never re-organized after the battle of Prince- ton. “Of this new regiment, Capt. David Hall, who had been an officer in the disbanded regiment commanded by Haslet, became the colonel, and Lieutenant Kirkwood became a captain, and his company was mustered into the service on the first day of Decem- ber, 1776. The regiment joined Washing- ton’s army in the Jerseys in the spring of 1777, and in September of the same year they were engaged in the battle of Brandy- wine, and in October following in the battle of Germantown, also in that of Monmouth. “In 1778 and 1779 they were actively en- gaged in operations in the Middle States. “In April, 1780, his regiment together with the Maryland troops was ordered south, and were assigned to the command of Baron De Kalb. The following description of the appearance of these troops, as they passed through Philadelphia on this march, is taken from the letter of a lady who was a witness of the same, and was written at the time: “ ‘What an Army, said both Whig and Tory as they saw them. The shorter men of each company in the front rank, the taller men behind them, some fit hunting shirts, some in uniforms, some in common clothes, some with their hats cocked, and some with- out, and those who did cock them not all wearing them the same way, but each man with a green sprig emblem of hope in his hat, and each bearing his firelock with what, even to uninstructed eyes, had the air of skillful training.’ “The first battle in the South in which Kirkwood’s regiment was engaged was that of Camden into which it went 500 strong, and came out with only 148. In this battle his regiment was placed in the front division as were the Marylanders. They maintained their position with noble intrepidity until the retreat was ordered, undismayed by the conduct of the panic-stricken condition of the Virginia and North Carolina militia. Both the colonel and major of his regiment were taken prisoners and sent to Charleston, South Carolina, where they were paroled, but never exchanged. “After this battle the Delaware regiment was reduced to less than two companies. This shattered remnant was placed under command of Captain Kirkwood as senior captain, who commanded it until the close of the war. De Kalb with his dying breath showered benedictions on the brave men for their stern courage and unflinching gallantry in the fierce tide of battle, and even Corn- wallis, Kawdon and the bitter and cruel Tar- leton praised their constancy and valor. “It was at the battle of Cowpens with the aid of cavalry that Kirkwood’s command saved the day. He relied much upon the use of the bayonet and amid the roar of the battle he would shout in stentorian tones, ‘Give them the bayonet, boys!’ An eye wit- ness of this last mentioned fight wrote as fol- lows: ‘Capt. Robert Kirkwood’s heroic valor and uncommon and undaunted bravery must needs be recorded in history through the coming years!’ “At the second action at Camden, which terminated unfavorably to the Americans, Kirkwood and his command showed the same indomitable spirit which characterized them in all previous encounters.

The battle of Guilford Court House, Waxhan and Ninety-Six were all scenes of his heroic fortitude and matchless bravery. “Wherever danger called or disaster threat- ened, there Kirkwood and his little band of faithful Delawareans were stationed. The bat- tle of Eutaw Springs was the last in which Kirkwood and his command participated and this was virtually the end of the war, as Cornwallis had surrendered and there was but little, if any, fighting afterwards. On the 29th of October, 1781, a resolution of thanks was passed by Congress in which the services of the Delaware battalion were specially recognized. “The State of Virginia recognized and ap- preciated his services by making a grant to him in 1787 of 2,000 acres of land in the Northwest Territory, the grant being in what is now the State of Ohio. “He married a Miss England of White Clay Creek Hundred in New Castle County, Delaware, by whom he had issue two chil- dren, a son and a daughter. Joseph, the son, removed to Ohio, and Mary, the daughter, married a gentleman of Dorchester County, Maryland. She died in 1850. Joseph, his son, married Margaret Gillespie in 1806, and during the same year removed to Ohio. They had issue, one son and eight daughters. “Major Kirkwood’s commission as 1st lieutenant of Delaware State troops is dated January 13, 1776, and is signed by John Hancock, President of Congress, and by Charles Thompson as Secretary. His brevet major’s commission is also signed by the same persons and is dated September 30, 1783. Doth of these commissions are in the possession of one of his descendants who re- sides in St. Clairsville, the county seat of Belmont County, Ohio. “Pie was engaged in 32 battles during the War of the Revolution. At its close he re- turned to Delaware and established himself in the mercantile business at Cantwell’s Bridge, and occupied a house which is still standing, or was not long since, which is situated east of the Old Tavernhouse. In 1785 he moved to St. George’s, Newcastle County, which is situated about one mile south of Kirkwood, a station on the Dela- ware branch of the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad. lie remained here but a short time, when he removed with his family to what is now Belmont County, Ohio, and located on the Ohio River imme- diately opposite the present city of Wheel- ing, where he built his cabin, cleared the land and commenced farming. Subsequently he commenced the erection of a block-house, but before it was completed in the early spring of 1789 a large body of Indians at- tacked his cabin during his absence in the East on business. It happened that at this time Capt. Joseph Biggs with his company of scouts and others were in the cabin shel- tering there. The 'savages fired the cabin and thus sought to drive the inmates out, expecting that they might fall an easy prey to their murderous ferocity. Those within, however, kept the fire in check with milk, water and damp earth. Finding themselves foiled, the Indians then attempted to burst in the door which had been firmly barricaded, in which they failed. “The rapid exchange of shots between the besiegers and besieged was heard at Fort Henry (Wheeling). The swivel gun in the fort was fired, notifying the besieged that succor was at hand. “The savages accordingly relaxed their ef- forts, and made preparations to depart, knowing full well that the inmates of Fort Henry would soon appear and that they t6 CENTENNIAL HISTORY OE BELMONT COUNTY , would suffer from an attack in the front and rear. Hence they promptly gathered their dead and wounded and hastily retreated. Five of the defenders were severely wounded — one of them mortally. The wounded were Capt. Joseph Biggs, John Walker, Elijah Hedges, John Barrett and Joseph Van Meter. Walker, who had been shot through the hip during the siege, died the following day at Colonel Zane’s cabin in Wheeling, where he had been transferred. He was buried in the old cemetery which then occupied the site of the present resi- dence of George K. Wheat, Escp, on Main street in the city of Wheeling. “When the army was organized under the command of General St. Clair to march against the Indians of the Northwest, Kirk- wood volunteered his services, and was com- missioned as captain. The rendezvous of the army was at Fort Washington (Cincinnati), from which place it took up its line of march on the 17th of September, 1791. It camped at Ludlow’s station for two weeks, about six miles from Cincinnati. There was a tree standing there as late as the year 1837 with the fact and date of the encampment carved in the bark. They were delayed in their progress by the construction of several forts which were duly garrisoned and provisioned. “On the night of November 2nd the army encamped near the Great Miami village, and on the following morning were attacked by the Indians in great force, which resulted in the defeat of St. Clair and the scattering of his forces. Of the distressing scenes wit- nessed by him on this occasion, Lieut. Michael McDonough wrote as follows: ‘We left everything behind, eight pieces of can- non, cattle, horses, flour, officers’ and 'sol- diers’ baggage, officers’ private property, in cash supposed to be of the value of £10,000, besides all their clothing. We retreated day and night for this place (Cincinnati), which is 98 miles, arriving on the 8th inst. The number of non-commissioned officers, mu- sicians and privates who fell on the field were upwards of 600. More than 60 women were killed and I saw some of them cut in two, their breasts cut off and burning, with a juunber of our officers on our own fires be- fore I left the field of action. I saw Captain Smith just after he was scalped, his head smoking like a chimney. Some soldiers have come in with all the skin and hair taken close off their heads.’ “The regiment to which Kirkwood be longed consisted of 258 commissioned, non- commissioned officers, and privates, 111 of whom were left after the battle and 42 of these were wounded, Captain Kirkwood him self falling in a bayonet charge against the enemy. But two officers, McDonough and Bissell, survived. Out of 1,200, nearly 800 officers, men and women were killed and wounded. “Thus ended the days of a brave and gal- lant officer, who gave his life for his country after having passed unscathed through 32 battles during the stormy period of the Revo- lution, leaving as a legacy to his countrymen an untarnished name and a memory fragrant with noble deeds and chivalrous impulses.’ INDIAN OCCUPATION OF THE COUNTY. Belmont County, indeed the country im- mediately bordering on the upper Ohio River, was not occupied by the Indians as homes or villages, but was rather a vast hunt- ing ground, a favorite resort where game of all kinds was found in abundance. And it is not surprising that the encroachments of the white man upon the western shores of the Ohio should be regarded with jealousy, or that the Indians should seek to repel it by driving the aggressors away. The tribal towns were located as follows: The Shawnees in the central part of the State, and extending westward to the Indiana line, the Delawares bordering on the Mus- kingum and Cuyahoga, and the Ottawas bordering the Great Lakes in the North and Northwest. There was also a number of less, prominent tribes, such as the Wvandottes Chippewas, Miamis and Pottowatomics, sur- V' i '.'lit • l( - • 1 /'■ ' MO .

However, for a period of 10 years tran- quility prevailed through the eastern section of Ohio, because of the treaty entered into by the Delawares and Shawnees, and Colonel Bouquet, the French commander. Prior to the year 1774, many emigrants had crossed the Ohio, and acquired claims in the new territory, but as previously stated, some oi these claims were only tomahawk rights. Encouraged by the peace and quiet that prevailed between 1764 and 1774, numerous land jobbers in addition to the regular settlers appropriated thousands oi acres. This of course aroused the jealousy of the neighboring Indian tribes. This jeal- ousy was intensified by the appropriation oi lands below the mouth of the Scioto River, and claimed by the Shawnees as Indian terri- tory. And now there were in circulation ex- aggerated stories of Indian outrages, re- taliatory measures, such as thieving, plun- dering and robbing, and fears were expressed that the Indians would fall upon and slaugh- ter the white intruders. In this emergency Col. Ebenezer Zane, who was in command of Fort Henry, just opposite Bridgeport, counseled peace and moderation, and if his advice had been heeded, the bloody Dun- more war would have been averted. Doddridge in his notes says: “Devoutly might humanity wish that the record of the causes which led to the destructive war of 1774 might be blotted from the annals of our country, but it is now too late to efface it, the black lettered list must remain, a dis- honorable blot in our national history; good, however, may spring out of evil. The in- juries inflicted upon the Indians in early times by our forefathers may induce their descendants to show justice and mercy to the diminished posterity of those children of the wilderness whose ancestors perished in cold blood and by the scalping knife of the white savages.” THE TRAGEDIES AT YELLOW CREEK AND CAPT1NA. In the month of April, 1774, a rumor was circulated that the Indians had stolen sev- eral horses from some land jobbers on the Ohio and Kanawha rivers. No evidences of the fact having been adduced leads to the conclusion that the report was false. This report, however, induced a pretty general belief that the Indians were about to make war upon the frontier settlements, but for this apprehension there does not appear to have been the slightest foundation. In consequence of this misapprehension of being attacked by the Indians the land jobbers ascended the river and collected at Wheeling. On the 27th of April it was re- ported in Wheeling that a canoe containing two Indians and some traders was coming down the river, and was then not far from the place. On hearing this Captain Cresap proposed taking a party and go up the river and kill the Indians. This project was ve- hemently opposed by Colonel Zane, the pro- prietor of the place. He stated to the cap- tain that the killing of those Indians would inevitably bring on a war, in which much innocent blood would be shed, and that the action itself would be an atrocious murder, and a disgrace to his name forever. His good counsel was lost. The partv went up the river. On being asked at their return what become of the Indians, they cooly an- swered, “They had fallen overboard into the river.” Their canoe on being examined was found bloody and pierced with bullets. This was the first blood which was shed in this war, and terrible was the vengeance which followed. In the evening of the same day, the party hearing that there was an en- campment of Indians at the mouth of the Captina, went down the river to the place, attacked the Indians and killed several of them. In this affair one of Cresap’s party was severely wounded. The massacre at Captina and that which took place at Baker’s, Lii ■> >> . . 10) v-.woM • ' 1 J j V.li.I'trp ■' :-'.f ! ■: ! f<*.{ , / my H o [ lo CENTENNIAL HISTORY OE BELMONT COUNTY, about 40 miles above Wheeling, a few days after that at Captina* were unquestionably the sole cause of the war of 1774. The last was perpetrated by 32 men under the command of Daniel Greathouse. The whole number killed at this place and on the river opposite to it was 12, besides several wounded. This horrid massacre was effected by an hypocritical strategem which reflects the deepest dishonor on the memory of those who were agents in it. The report of the murders of the Indians near Wheeling in- duced a belief that they would immediately commence hostilities, and this apprehension furnished the pretext for the murder above related. The ostensible object for raising the party under Greathouse was that of de- fending the family of Baker, whose house was opposite to a large encampment of In- dians at the mouth of Big Yellow Creek. The party were concealed in ambuscade while their commander went over the river under the mask of friendship to the Indian camp to ascertain their number; while there an Indian woman advised him to return home speedily, saying that the Indians were drink- ing and angry, on account of the murder of their people down the river, and might do him some mischief. On his return to his party he reported that the Indians were too strong for an open attack. He returned to Baker’s and requested him to give any In- dians who might come over in the course of the day as much rum as they might call for, and get as many of them drunk as he possibly could. The plan succeeded. Several Indian men with two women came over the river to Baker’s, who had previously been in the habit of selling rum to the Indians. The men drank freely and became intoxicated. Tn this state they were all killed by Great- house and a few of his party. I say a few of his party; for it is but justice to state that not more than five or six of the whole num- ber had any participation in- the slaughter at the house. The rest protested against it as an atro- cious murder. From their number being by far the majority, they might have prevented the deed; but alas! they did not. A little Indian girl alone was saved from the slaugh- ter, by the humanity of some one of the party whose name is not now known. The Indians in the camp hearing the firing at the house sent a canoe with two men in it to inquire what had happened. These two Indians were both shot down as soon as they landed on the beach. A second and larger canoe was then manned with a number of Indians in arms; but in attempt- ing to reach the shore some distance below the house were received by a well directed fire from the party, which killed the greater number of them and compelled the survivors to return. A great number of shots were exchanged across the river, but without damage to the white party, not one of whom were even wounded. The Indian men who were murdered were all scalped. The woman who gave the friendly advice to the com- mander of the men in the Indian camp was among the slain at Baker’s house. The massacres of the Indians at Captina and Yellow Creek comprehended the whole of the family of the famous but unfortunate Logan, who before these events had been a lover of the whites, and a strenuous advocate for peace; but in the conflict which followed by way of revenge for the death of his people, he became a brave and sanguinary chief among the warriors. The settlers along the frontiers knowing that the Indians would make war upon them for the murder of their people, either moved off to the interior or took up their residence in forts. THE DISASTROUS DUNMORE WAR. The apprehension of war was soon real- ized. In a short time the Indians com- menced hostilities along the whole extent of our frontier. Express was speedily sent to Williamsburg, the then seat of government of the colony, communicating intelligence of the certainty ' O'1' 1 ’ ' , • ' ' I 0! I ..U.; Jfll .01! ! in .'!

A plan for the campaign for the purpose of putting a speedy conclusion to the Indian hostilities was adopted between the Earl of Dunmore, the governor of the colony, and Gen. Andrew Lewis. General Lewis was ap- pointed to the command of the southern di- vision of the forces to be employed on this occasion, with orders to raise a large body of volunteers from the southeastern counties with all dispatch. These forces were to ren- dezvous at Camp Union in the Greenbriar country. The Earl of Dunmore was to raise another army in the northern counties of the colony, and in the settlement west of the mountains, and assemble them at Lort Pitt, and from thence descend the river to Point Pleasant, at the mouth of the Great Kanahwa. On the nth of September the forces un- der General Lewis, amounting to 1,100 men, commenced their march from Camp Union to Point Pleasant. The tract of country between these two points was a trackless desert. After a pain- ful march of 19 days the army arrived on the 1st of October at Point Pleasant. Gen- eral Lewis was exceedingly disappointed at hearing no tidings of the Earl of Dunmore, who was to form a junction with him at this place. Very early on the morning of the 10th, two young men set out from the camp to hunt up the river. Plaving gone about three miles they fell upon a camp of the In- dians, who were then in the act of preparing to march to attack the camp of General Lewis. The Indians fired upon them and killed one of them; the other ran back to the camp with intelligence that the Indians in great force would immediately give battle. General Lewis instantly ordered out a de- tachment of troops under Colonel Lleming and another under Col. Charles Lewis, re- maining himself with a reserve for the de- fense of the camp. The detachment met the Indians about 400 yards from the camp. The battle commenced a little after sunrise by a heavy firing from the Indians. At the onset our troops gave some distance until met by reinforcements, on the arrival of which the Indians retreated, and formed a line behind logs and trees. By this maneuver our army was completely invested, being enclosed be- tween the two rivers, with the Indian line of battle in front, so that no chance of re- treat was left. An incessant fire was kept up on both sides until sundown, when the Indians retreated in the night across the Ohio, and the next day commenced their march to their town on the Scioto. Our loss in this destructive battle was 75 killed and 140 wounded. Among the killed were Col. Charles Lewis; Colonel Lields, and Captains Buford, Mur- ray, Ward, Willson and McClenahan. Colonel Lewis, a distinguished and meri- torious officer, was mortally wounded by the first fire of the Indians, but walked into the camp and expired in his own tent. The In- dians during the battle were commanded by the Cornstalk warrior, the king of the Shaw- nees. This son of the forest in his plans ol attack and retreat, and in all his maneuvers, displayed the skill and bravery of the con- summate general. During the whole of the day he was heard from our lines shouting with the voice of stentor, “Be strong, Be strong.” It is even said that he killed one of his own men with his own hand for cow- ardice. On the day following General Lewis commenced his march for the Shawnee town This march was made through a trackless desert and attended with great privations ■4md difficulties. /Mn the meantime the Lari of Dunmore, having collected a force, and provided boats at Lort Pitt, descended the river to Wheel- ing, where the army halted at Lort Henry for a few days, and then proceeded down the river within eight miles of the Shawnee town. Before the army had reached the place the Indian chiefs had sent several mes- sengers asking for peace. With this request he soon determined to comply, and therefore sent a request to Gen- Mi ' : ; (i ' fi »•( ’ ■ i ; ! ■ ;?

The order of Dunmore was obeyed with every expression of regret and disappoint- ment. The Earl and his officers having returned to his camp, a treaty with the Indians was opened the following day. In this treaty every precaution on the part of our people was taken to prevent the In- dians from ending the treaty in the tragedy of a massacre. Only 18 In- dians with their chiefs were permitted to pass the outer gate of their fortified encampment, after having deposited their arms with the guard at the gate. The treaty was opened by Cornstalk, the chief of the Shawnees, in a lengthy speech’ in which he boldly charged the white people with having been the authors of the commencement of the war, in the massacres of the Indians at Captina and Yellow Creek. This speech he delivered in so loud a tone of voice, that he was heard all over the camp. The terms of the treaty were soon settled, and the prisoners deliv- ered up. Logan, the Cayuga chief, assented to the treaty, but, still indignant at the mur- der of his family, refusqd to attend with the other chiefs at the camp of Dunmore. Ac- cording to the Indian mode in such cases, he sent his speech in a belt of wampum, by an interpreter to be read at the treaty. ‘T appeal to any white man to say if he entered Logan’s cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat; if he ever came cold and naked and he clothed him not. During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan re- mained idle in his cabin, an advocate of peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed and said, ‘Logan is the friend of the white man.’ f had even thought^ to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man Colonel Cresap the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked, murdered all the relatives OF BELMONT COUNTY, of Logan, not even sparing my women and children.

I full glutted my ven- gence; for my country I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. lie will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.” Thus ended at the treaty ol Camp Charlotte in the month of November, 1774, the disastrous war of Dunmore. It began in the wanton and unprovoked mur- ders of the Indians at Captina and Yellow Creek anti ended with an awful sacrifice of life and property to the demon of revenge On our part w'e obtained at the treaty a ces- sation of hostilities and a surrender of pris- oners, and nothing more. The plan of operations adopted by the Indians in the war of Dunmore shows very clearly that their chiefs were by no means deficient in their foresight and skill necessary for mak- ing the most prudent military arrangement for obtaining success and victory in their mode of warfare. At an early period they obtained intelligence of the plan of the cam paign against them concerted by the Earl of Dunmore and General Lewis. With a view, therefore, to attack the forces of these commanders separately, they speedily collected their warriors and by forced marches reached the Point, before the expected arrival of the troops under Dun- more. Such was the privacy with which they conducted their march, that General Lewis knew nothing of the approach of the Indian army, until a few minutes before the commencement of the battle, and it is proba- ble that if Cornstalk, the Indian commander, had had a little larger force at the battle of Point Pleasant, the whole army of General Lewis would have been cut off, as the wary savages had left them no chance of retreat. Had the army of Lewis been defeated, the army of Dunmore, consisting of but little more than 1,000 men, would have shared ' ?/ ’ :i • j \"j ■ 'll J.G fjJ /M l' ■ 1 i .■ ? ) i l' ilj AND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS. the fate of those armies which at different periods have suffered defeats in consequence of venturing too far into the Indian coun- try. It was the general belief among the officers of our army at this time that the Earl of Dunmore, while at Wheeling, re- ceived advice from his government of the probability of the approaching war between England and the colonies, and that after- wards all of his measures with regard to the Indians had for their ultimate object an al- liance with those ferocious warriors for their aid of the mother country in their contest with us. This supposition accounts for his not forming a junction with the army of Lewis at Point Pleasant. This deviation from the original plan of the campaign jeopardized the army of Lewis, and well nigh occasioned its total destruction. The conduct of the Earl at the treaty shows a good understanding between him and the Indian chiefs. lie did not suffer the army of Lewis to form a junction with his own, but sent them back before the treaty was concluded, thus risking the safety of his own forces, for at the time of the treaty the Indian warriors were about his camp in force sufficient to have intercepted his retreat and destroyed his whole army. THE FOREMOST AMERICAN HEROINE. Perhaps the severest battle with the In- dians, fought within the boundaries of Bel- mont County, was the attack on Fort Kirk- wood in the spring of 1791, as narrated in the story of “A Revolutionary Hero.” But there were many acts of heroism and deeds of daring and danger familiar to the people of that generation that history needs to pre- serve for generations to come. Perhaps the foremost is the thrilling adventure of Eliza- beth Zane, the heroine of Fort Henry, and who was for many years a resident of Mar- tin’s Ferry, and her remains are interred there. She was twice married, first to a Mr. Me 2 1 Laughlin of Martin’s Ferry, and second to Mr. Clark, and her lineal descendants still reside in Belmont County. A few years ago President Roosevelt, in a circle of eminent literary characters in New York State among whom was William Dean Howells, pro- nounced Betty Zane the foremost American heroine. He said her daring deed in replen- ishing the_ powder supply at Fort Henry had never been surpassed, a sentiment in which Mr. Howells heartily concurred. SIEGE OF FORT HENRY. The story is briefly told in Judge Cran- mer’s report of the siege of Fort Henry. In September, 1782, a large force of Indians headed by a company of British soldiers laid siege to Fort Henry at Wheeling. East of and but a short distance from the fori stood the log dwelling of Col. Ebenezer Zane, attached to which was a small maga- zine containing the military supplies which had been furnished by the government ol Virginia, and also a kitchen or outbuilding occupied by “Daddy Sam,” so called (a negro slave owned by Colonel Zane, and tc whom he was much attached), and his wife, familiarly known by the name of “Katey.” On the occasion of the attack upon the fort by the Indians in the year 1777, Colonel Zane and his family had abandoned his cabin and sought shelter in the fort, at which time it was reduced to ashes by the besiegers. He then declared that if the Indians again made their appearance he would not abandon hjs dwelling, but would defend it to the last ex- tremity. As an outpost for the protection for the fort, and as an annoyance to an hos- tile force, it could not be excelled. Hence on the appearance of the Indian? at this time he made all necessarv prepara tions possible for its defense. Had lie re- tired from it, all the military stores and am- munition stored there would have fallen into the hands of the enemy, and have been de- stroyed or appropriated by them. The names of those who remained with I • ' ‘:±y . •> ; '■ 1 i I in / f .1 I ;■■// > ! '• . ! . ' I 22 CENTENNIAL HISTORY OF BELMONT COUNTY, him in his cabin are: Andrew Scott, George Green, Elizabeth Zane, Wallace Scott, Miss McColloch, a sister of Maj. Sam McColloch from Short Creek (who at this time was on a visit to her sister, Mrs. Zane); “Daddy Sam,” and “Katey,” his wife. The savages approached under cover of the British flag, which was unfurled to the breeze and waved in proud defiance by the color-bearer in the face of the little band of heroic defenders. Before commencing their attack they de- manded the immediate surrender of the fort, in the name of His Brittanic Majesty, to which no other reply was given than by the firing of a shot by some one in the fort at the offensive colors which were flaunted be- fore them. Thereupon the assault com- menced in dreadful earnest, the frenzied sav- ages rushing forward like mad men, and in their wild attempt striving to destroy the pickets so as to effect an entrance to the fort, and take it by storm. Colonel Zane had arranged and posted his limited force within his house to the best advantage, and where it could do the most execution. As the Indians sounded their war whoop and made their desperate rush, he opened upon them with a well directed and brisk fire simultaneously with the one from the fort, so as to cause them to fall hack in great dis- order, and to seek cover where their persons would be less exposed. But others, again, seeing' the discomfiture of their comrades, promptly with loud and deafening yells rushed forward to take the places of those who had retired, only to be repulsed again, and although these charges were repeated again and again, they suffered a recoil. These unsuccessful efforts upon their part were continued until night threw her mantle over the earth and a brief cessa- tion of conflict and a temporary rest was secured. Yet it was but for a brief time this respite was granted. Their assailants were engaged in holding a consultation and deliberating among them- selves how best to obtain possession of or destroy the cabin of Colonel Zane, which had proven so offensive to them in their repeated assaults on the fort and thus balked their efforts at its reduction. The conclusion arrived at was to make an attempt under the cover of darkness to de- stroy it by firing it and reducing it to ashes. After an interval of an hour or two, when silence had settled down upon the scene and the campfires of the savages had been put out, and it was presumed that the whites had relaxed in some degree their caution and vigilance, a savage with a half burned brand in his hand crawled in the direction of the kitchen of the house, upon nearing which he slowly rose from the ground and waving the brand to and fro, and blowing upon it to rekindle it, was about to stealthily apply it to the building, when of a sudden the quiet was disturbed by the sharp crack of a rifle which rang out in the stillness of the night, which a moment later was accom- panied by a sharp yell of pain and rage, ere the echoes of the shot had ceased to resound in the mazes of the forest. The vigilant and quick eye of “Daddy Sam” had detected the savage in time to foil him in his design and spoil his calculations, thereby saving his master’s property from destruction. Other similar attempts were made on the same night, but in every instance “Daddy Sam” was on the alert, and always frustrated them. And here we will be pardoned if in passing we say a word or two concerning this indi- vidual. He was an original importation from Guinea, and had all the characteristics of a native of the country, believing in charms, incantations and signs, and was a bundle of strange superstitions and beliefs, and these he retained until the day of his death. ITe and his wife were cared and provided for by Colonel Zane and his family until their decease. This gentleman erected for them a cozy cabin on the upper portion of the island, im- mediately opposite the city of Wheeling “Daddy Sam” died in peace and content- ment, honored and respected by the whole : ! • .

At his death he left strict injunctions to have his rifle and his ac coutrements — tomahawk, knife and silver snuffbox— buried with him, that they might bear him company to the happy hunting grounds of the African. So greatly was he esteemed that he was buried with military honors, and he was followed to the grave b) an immense concourse of citizens, composed of the most prominent as well as the humblest members of society. In stature he was small and of light frame, with arms of unusual length, and a complexion as black as coal. But to resume our narrative. At daylight on the following morning the lines of the enemy showed that they were tightly drawn and in compact order, but they were laggard in renewing the assault. However, they were not idle, but were actively employed in making preparations evidently for some im- portant event. Shortly after dark of the pre- ceding day a canoe, loaded with cannon balls from Fort Pitt and destined for the falls of the Ohio, had put ashore under the cover of the fort. It was discovered by the Indians, but its occupants succeeded in effecting an entrance for themselves into the fort, in their efforts to do which, however, one of them Daniel Sullivan, was wounded in the foot The savages secured the canoe and took pos- session of its contents. A new idea now dawned upon them — why not utilize these missiles and make them play a part in the reduction of the forts. The idea was ap- proved and the suggestion was at once put into execution. Securing a hollow log which they deemed adapted for the purpose, they proceeded to bind it with iron chains which they found in the blacksmith shop of the village. Filling it with a heavy charge of powder, they rammed home as many ol the captured balls as it could conveniently hold, and with as much accuracy as possible under the circumstances aimed it against one of the bastions. All was now ready as soon as it was primed, for which purpose a big Indian stepped forward, emptying from iiis powder horn a sufficient quantity around the vent. A crowd of Indians collected around to witness the new engine of destruc- tion, and the effect produced upon the fort by its discharge, not doubting in the least that it would prove more or less destructive in its effects. In this supposition they were not deceived, but were sorely disappointed in the nature of the result which ensued. All things being ready, an Indian advanced with a lighted brand, which he applied to the vent hole and thereby stamped “finis” on the last page of his own and the life history of his curious companions who were near by him at the time. Several were killed, many were seriously and some slmhtlv wounded, and all were terror stricken bv the unexpected re- sult. The unlooked for and unexpected havoc caused among their number, by the explosion of their wooden artillery which burst into fragments, led them to become wild and furious under their disappointment, and the loss and wounding of so many of their number, and wild with rage in their excitement they redoubled their exertions, renewing the assault with heedless despera- tion, and exposing themselves in the most careless manner to the shots from the house and the fort. At times it appeared that the Indians would succeed, but then the fortunes of the day would change, and the fortunes of the inmates of the fort appeared to be in the ascendant. Thus the conflict wavered until noon, when the forces of the Indians were drawn off temporarily. Tt was exceed- ingly fortunate for the little garrison that the savages desisted from their attack when they did, as the ammunition of the defenders of the fort was beginning to grow short. The alarm given by Finn of the approach of the enemy having, as we have stated, been so limited, and the fact that the fort was des- titute to a great extent of any large supply of ammunition to enable it to withstand a protracted siege, it was discovered that the i . . \"It ';o: M — ■ if 0 I' HJ r \\v.r ,vi;h i >fl J 5o lOtJ .'flji. ' 24 CENTENNIAL HISTORY OF BELMONT COUNTY, supply on hand was being rapidly exhausted, and some measures must be adopted to sup- ply the need. As before stated, there was plenty of pow- der stored in the magazine at Colonel Zane’s house, but for all practical purposes it might as well have been a hundred miles away. The contingency which now happened could not have been foreseen, and the emergency now upon them was a grave one. But it was one which had to be met, and the question was how could they best re- plenish their almost exhausted stock. An effort at least to obtain powder from Colonel Zane’s house it was absolutely necessary should be made, for should the enemy return to the assault in their then condition the danger of the inmates was not only immi- nent, but their doom was almost sealed. Among the many propositions which were made and the one which seemed to obtain favor, was that one of the fleetest runners among the younger men should be selected for the perilous undertaking of obtaining a keg of powder from Colonel Zane’s house and hasten with it to the relief of the be- sieged. It was an undertaking full of daring with the prospect of almost certain death to the person who should essay the task. But undeterred by the magnitude of the feat and the peril which attended it, at the call of Captain Zane for a volunteer, several brave men stepped forward, each one of whom in- sisted on being permitted to make the at- tempt. The loss of a single man at this junc- ture would have been keenly felt by the en- tire company. While Captain Zane was hesi- tating in arriving at a decision and making his choice from among those chivalric spirits who had so promptly offered their services, there came bounding into his presence his own sister, Elizabeth Zane, in the elasticity of her youthful strength, and volunteered to attempt the accomplishment of the errand, regardless of what might befall her if thereby she could bo instrumental in saving the lives of others. When told that a man would en- counter less danger by reason of his superior tleetness, she nobly replied that the loss of a man under the circumstances would be more severely felt than her own. “You have not one man to spare,” she said. “A woman will not be missed in the defense of the fort.” All the arguments adduced by her brother and others to dissuade her from making the at- tempt together with the expostulations of the other'females had the effect of only con- firming her in her resolution. Reluctantly they finally acquiesced in her purpose and her services were accepted. Di- vesting herself of all unnecessary clothing which might impede her in her progress, she appeared ready for the dangerous ordeal. The gate was swung open and the young heroine sprang out in the swelling buoyancy of hope, knowing no such word as fail in the full confidence of success, and swift as a deer she sped away on her mission, arriving safely at the cabin of her brother, Col. Ebenezer Zane, who saw her coming and promptly opened the door to receive her. When the Indians saw her bounding along at the top of her speed they were amazed at her temerity but did not offer to fire at her, but contented themselves with simply exclaim- ing with contemptuous sneers, “A squaw, a squaw.” Upon reaching her destination she lost no time in stating her business. After a brief breathing spell she announced her readiness to return, whereupon Colonel Zane, taking a tablecloth and fastening it securely around her waist with two of its ends, while the other ends were held by her in her hands, emptied into it a keg of pow- der when she again ventured forth on her return to the fort. Her black hair, like a banner, streamed out upon the air as with swift feet she lessened the intervening dis- tance. But she had not covered more than hall the space between the cabin and the fort when the savages, apprehending her pur- pose, showered a rain of bullets around her, none of which, however, did any execution, as she reached the fort in safety and deliv- ered the powder without losing any percepti- I 'H f .\" b • 1 '■;/ i'l ' m (■■■.'

Subsequently in recount- ing her experience on this occasion, she would relate how the bullets whistled around her so thick and fast that the dust thrown up by them as they struck the ground blinded and confused her so that she could scarcely distinguish her way. As she neared the fort the gate was again thrown open for her entrance when the In- dians made an unavailing effort to reach it. before it could be closed, by making a sud- den rush. Finding themselves foiled, tliej quickly withdrew. This act of heroism on the part of Elizabeth Zane doubtless saved the lives of the inmates of t lie fort, and en- abled them successfully to withstand the siege. As night closed in, the enemy re- newed their efforts to reduce the fortress, and continued them until daylight. Times almost without number, during that trying and eventful night, the enemy attempted to accomplish by the torch what they could not by superior numbers and advantage. Bun- dles of hemp and wood and rubbish were heaped by them against the pickets and set fire to at different places. The hemp, fortunately being wet, would not burn, and the dry wood and rubbish proved also vain in accomplishing their end When the day dawned after that terrible and trying nieht, it was greeted by the besieged with a renewal of hope which had been well nigh banished. When the intelligence reached Shepherd’s Fort, located at the forks of Wheeling Creek, of the investiture of Fort Henry by Indians and British soldiers, a party left the former fort with a view of rendering assistance to the inmates of the latter, but on arriving in the vicinity they found that it would be impossible to gain ad- mission and therefore reluctantly determined to return. This conclusion was arrived at in opposi- tion to the views of their leader, Francis Duke, a relative of Colonel Shepherd. He insisted that if no one else would, he alone would make the attempt to gain ingress at the fort at the risk of his life. To all per- suasions against the undertaking he turned a deaf ear. He recognized their force and complained not at the resolution of his men to return, but his chivalric character and de- termined spirit could not be curbed by argu- ment or persuasion. He did not regard the imminent danger attaching to the bold undertaking, but, sub- ordinating-this to the higher and nobler promptings of his nature tvhich enabled him only to see the peril of friends, he spurned all restraint, and taking his life in his hands and putting spurs to his horse, he sped swift as his horse could carry him toward the gate of the fort, calling aloud as he rode, “Open the gate, open the gate.” He was recognized by those within the fort and the gate was swung open for his ad- mission, but before reaching it he was pierced with bullets, and this young and gal- lant chevalier fell a martyr to his reckless daring and noble disinterestedness. On the morning of the third day the enemy, despairing of success and abandon- ing all hope of the reduction of the fort, re- solved on raising the siege. This resolution was announced to the inmates by a series of terrific yells and deafening whoops, which was the means adopted by them do give ex- pression to their disgust at their failure. Turning their backs upon the scene, they took their departure and recrossed the river into Belmont County. “whistling to start the tunes.” Tt was a trying experience for a young and refined woman like Mrs. Zane to be called upon to pass through — to sever the ties of home and kindred and forego all so- cial advantages and the pleasures of civilized life, and be deprived of much of its con- veniences, and plunge into the depth of the wilderness, the abode of savages and wild beasts.

In this dilemma Betty Zane, the heroine of Fort Henry, vol- unteered to ‘whistle’ the tunes, and those who could not sing might catch up the tune and ‘carry it along.’ The proposition was ac- cepted and the forest was soon ringing with the melody of their voices.” KILLING OF WILLIAM COCHRAN. Judge Cochran of Martin’s Ferry has often heard his grandfather tell the tragic story of his father’s death. Said he: “About the time of father’s death there were great disturb- ances on the frontier. It was customary for us to keep our horses hobbled or belled. One morning, failing to hear the sound of the bells as usual, father sent me to the block-house at West Liberty, while lie and my older brothers started out in search of the horses. It was arranged between them after starting that they should separate and pursue the object of their search in different directions, my father taking one direction and the boys in company another. The lat- ter soon discovered signs which led them to believe that the horses had been captured or driven off by the Indians, and they at once started on the nearest way leading to the block-house, upon reaching which they gave the alarm. From Billy Boggs, who was held by the Indians as a prisoner at the time, but who shortly afterwards escaped, we learned the particulars of father’s death, as told to him by the Indians while he was in captivity. “Father was a very active and resolute man, and the savages wanted to capture him. It appears that they had caught the horses, and wrapping moss around the bell- clappers had led them away to a distance, placing six of their number in ambush, to capture father, or anyone who might venture to search for them. Not finding the horses, he started on his return toward the block- house, on the way passing in sight of his own house, in expectation, as he hoped, of seeing the boys. The Indians meanwhile had gone into his cabin. Intending to enter, he was prevented by having his suspicions aroused from certain appearances around and in the vicinity, which only the keen eye of a disciplined woodsman would detect, and which caused him to change his purpose, and start for the block-house at the top of his speed. The Indians at once started in pur- suit of him, but when they found that the gap between the pursued and the pursuers was widening, and they could not overtake him, a half-breed, wearing the cognomen of ‘Dolway Jim,’ suddenly dropped on his knees and, taking fatal aim, fired and killed him just as he was crossing a piece of rising ground. His remains were afterwards found and buried by a party from the fort on the spot where he fell. His scalp had been taken by the Indians to their camp, where it was flaunted in the face of Boggs, the prisoner, who recognized it. “Boggs subsequently escaped, having run the gauntlet, and these details of my father’s death he repeated to me and my brothers, as related to him by his captor.” THE TRAGEDY NEAR KIRKWOOD’S BLOCK-HOUSE. About 1795 Lieut. Duncan McArthur and a posse of men, numbering in all a dozen, were stationed at the block-house on the lands of Robert Kirkwood. One morning they noticed a young Indian dodging along not far from the fort among the trees. He had been sent by a body of Indians, who had ambushed about three miles below, on the ■ if ■ ft li. i i*.;- ' <\"■' ■ AND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS. 27 banks of the Ohio River, to decoy the sol- diers from their fort. As soon as lie was discovered, Lieutenant McArthur and his men started out to catch him. They followed him as he ran down the river about three miles to where the In- dians had secreted themselves, when 15 of the redskins fired into their number, kill- ing six of them instantly. So unexpected was the attack that the re- maining six, completely bewildered and frightened, turned and retreated, McArthur behind. As he turned his head to take in the situation his foot caught in a grape vine and he was sent sprawling on his face just as the Indians fired a volley of bullets after him and the limbs and leaves dropned all around him. He regained his feet and started at full speed, following the course of his men. He was closely pursued Lv the savages, but be- ing very swift of foot, the latter soon gave up the chase, and the remnant of the party gained the block-house in safety. Lieutenant McArthur was afterwards made governor of Ohio. -ay • i 1 ' ';■//' ' . . ^ B£' ' >V ' I .m) ; J<i ... ■ ■ ■ ' ■ , Zt ■ \\yrr {]•< ! w .< ;i oj y-1 ; ! ! ) rrTfh t!i>. n CHAPTER. II.

THE INDIAN SUMMER. As connected with the history of the In dian wars of the Western Country, it may not be amiss to give an explanation of the term “Indian Summer.” This expression, like many others, notwithstanding its original import, has continued in general use, while its meaning has been forgotten A back, woodsman seldom hears this ex- pression without feeling a chill of horror, be- cause it brings to his mind with painful recol- lection its original application. The reader must here be reminded that during the long continued Indian wars sustained by the first settlers of the Western Country, they en- joyed no peace excepting in the winter sea- son, when, owing to the severity of the weather, the Indians were unable to make their excursions into the settlements. The onset of winter was therefore hailed as a jubilee by the early inhabitants of the coun- try, who throughout the spring and the early part of the fall had been cooped up in their little uncomfortable forts and subjected to all the distresses of the Indian war. At the approach of winter, therefore, all the farmers, excepting the owner of the fort, removed to their cabins on their farms with the joyful feelings of a tenant of a prison on recovering his release from confinement. All was bustle and hilarity in preparing for win- ter by gathering in the corn, digging pota- toes, fattening hogs and repairing the cab- ins. To our forefathers the gloomy months of winter were more pleasant than the zephyrs of spring and the flowers of May. It, how- ever, sometimes happened that after the ap- parent onset of winter the weather became warm; the smoky time commenced and lasted for a considerable number of days. This was the Indian summer, because it afforded the Indians another opportunity of visiting the settlements with their destruc- tive warfare. The melting of the snow saddened every countenance and the genial warmth of the sun chilled every heart with horror. The apprehension of another visit from the In- dians and of being driven back to the de- tested fort was painful in the highest degree, and the distressing apprehension was fre- quently realized. Toward the latter part of February we commonly had a fine spell of open warm weather, during which the snow melted away. This was denominated “Powwowing i*u»q i f fiighto !

Sad experience taught us that in this conjecture we were not often mistaken. A man of the name of John Car- penter was taken early in the month of March in the neighborhood of Wheeling. There had been several warm days, but the night preceding there was a heavy fall of snow. His two horses which he took with him nearly perished in swimming the river into what is now Belmont County. The In- dians as well as himself suffered greatly be- fore they reached the Moravian towns. In the morning after the first day’s journey the Indians sent out Carpenter to bring in the horses, which had been turned out in the evening after being hobbled. The horses had fallen into the trail by which they came and were making their way homeward. When he overtook the horses and had taken off their fetters, he had to make a most awful decision. He had a chance, ami barely a chance, to make his escape, with a certainty of death should he fail. On the other hand, a horrible prospect of being tortured to death by fire presented itself, as he was the first prisoner taken that spring, and the gen- eral custom of the Indians was to burn the first prisoner every spring. After spending a few minutes in making his decision, he re- sol veil on attempting an escape, and effected it, bringing both his horses with him. The capture of Mr. Carpenter and the murder of two families contributed materially to the Moravian campaign and the murder of that unfortunate people. ANECDOTES OF LEWIS WETZEL. On the farm of J. B. McMechen, two miles east of St. Clairsville, on the National Road, better known in the early days as the ‘‘Zane Trail,” there is a celebrated spring known as the ‘‘Indian Spring,” where in 1782, a short time before the siege of Fort Henry, occurred one of the most stirring events in our history. In the interval aftei Crawford’s defeat and before the attack on Fort Henry in September of this year, oc curred an incident of local interest, which shows the dexterity and skill of the famous Indian scout, Louis Wetzel. Thomas Mills who lived on Wheeling Creek, had accom- panied Crawford on his campaign, and on his return had left his horse on the west side of the Ohio River near the spot where St Clairsville now stands, and distant 12 miles from Wheeling. One day, securing the ser- vices of Wetzel, Mills and his companion left Fort Henry to get his horse and bring the animal home. When within a mile or two of St. Clairsville they were met by a band 1111m Bering 40 or 50 Indians, who were roaming around in search of stragglers on the return from the army of Crawford. The Indians and white men discovered each other about the same time. Wetzel fired first and killed one of the savages, which shot was promptly re turned by one of the Indians. The Indian’s fire had wounded Mills in the foot, which prevented him from eluding the savages, who soon succeeded in overtaking and kill- ing him. Four of the Indians then dropped their guns and pursued after Wetzel, who at first succeeded in keeping a respectable dis- tance between him and his pursuers, and loaded his rifle as he ran. But after running some distance one of the Indians rapidly gained upon him until he approached within a few steps of Wetzel, who wheeled around, shot him down and ran on loading as he ran. After running some distance farther a second In- dian came so close to him that, as he turned to fire, the Indian clinched the muzzle of the gun and he and the Indian had quite a tus- sle for the possession of it. He, however, succeeded in killing the savage. The pursuit was continued by the two remaining In dians, who now exhibited signs of caution, for when Wetzel would wheel to fire on them they would seek cover behind trees. After running some distance Wetzel thought he would practice a little piece of strategy, >'• .i 7.

The Indians were not far behind him, and as he was passing over this he suddenly wheeled and stopped with a view of shooting the foremost one, who as promptly jumped behind a small tree, which failed to cover his body. Wetzel shot and wounded him in the thigh, which put a stop to further pursuit on his part. The last of the Indians then gave a little yell and exclaimed, “No catch dat man — gun always loaded!” and gave up the chase, Of this noted hunter it may be said that while his home was on Big Wheeling Creek east of Wheeling, the most of his exploits took place on the Ohio side of the river and in what is now Belmont County. Lewis Wetzel was a son of John Wetzel, a German emigrant, and his education, like that of all the frontiersmen, was that of the hunter and Indian fighter. Attaining manhood, he was courageous, manly, yet cunning as an In- dian in warfare. In stature he was tall, with jet black hair, broad shoulders and deep chest; though his face was slightly pock-marked, his counten- ance was pleasing. Of this noted hunter a writer in the his- tory of Belmont and Jefferson Counties says: “In early youth Lewis Wetzel acquired the habit of loading his gun while at full run, which gave him a great advantage as an In- dian fighter, and was of immense conse- quence in the next important event of his life. This incident in his career occurred when he was but 16 years old, and was a most remakable event, an exploit rarely equaled for courage and daring in any age Some time during the summer of 1780 a party of Indians had crossed the Ohio and stolen several horses from settlers on Wheel- ing Creek and were making their way back through Belmont County. “A party of the whites were soon gathered and en route to recapture the horses and punish the savages. In the pursuit, the party passed the farm of the elder Wetzel, who was then absent. Lewis was engaged in cul- tivating a crop of corn. They urged him to join their party, but he had been forbidden by his father to leave home, but the adven- ture was too great a temptation for the spirit of young Wetzel and he was easily persuaded to join them. He accordingly took from the plow a favorite horse of his father and started along in pursuit. They had not pro- ceeded far until they came upon the enemy, who were carelessly loitering about their camp, apparently off their guard. The stolen horses were spanieled and grazing at a short distance. The Indians were easily surprised and lied, leaving the horses, which were re- covered. The party of settlers, having ac- complished their purpose, prepared to return, but their horses were jaded and hungry and they agreed that they should be turned out to grass, and three of their number left to bring them, after they had refreshed for a short time. “They had not proceeded many miles un- til they were overtaken by three of their number they had left behind to bring their horses, who informed them that soon after their departure they were surprised by the savages, leaving them no alternative in sav- ing their fives but to abandon everything and escape by flight. “A parley was called and the hasty de- termination was soon formed to continue their way homeward and leave their horses with the Indians. “To this determination Wetzel earnestly remonstrated. He protested he would never return alive to his father without the favorite horse — swore he preferred the mare without his scalp to his scalp without the mare, and urged the company to return and retake the horses. In this he was overruled. He then swore he would go alone; that the mare he must and would have, when two others who had been active in . persuading him to go agreed to accompany him. The three left their companions and soon reached the camp and found the Indians engaged at their meals, with the horses safely secured at a safe distance. The plan of attack was soon ■ . i f ; ' 1 1 • ' ‘ - 1 ! >: \"i > 1 t , ■, :■ ,;dl - f! ■! ilit *.

They were to advance in single hie, Wetzel in front until they passed two trees, behind which his companions were to ambush. When he reached the third it was a signal for attack. Wetzel reached his tree and discovered that the Indians had also treed; but in looking around for his companions he found they had retreated at the top of their speed. “His condition was really critical; to come out in an open held was almost certain death. His only hope was in strategy. He therefore placed his hat on the end of his ramrod and gently pushed it partly from be- hind the tree. This was no sooner done than all the Indians hired at it. “The hat was literally riddled, and Wetzel still secure behind the tree, quick, but cau- tiously, dropped the hat to the ground. At this the Indians, believing they had killed their adversary, all sprung from their am- bush and rushed towards him. Wetzel, tak- ing advantage of the enemy, whose guns were empty, left his tree and firing on the foremost, brought him to the ground, and then with the fleetness of the wind ran from the scene, follbwed by the survivors. Wetzel loaded as he ran and, wheeling quickly, fired into the breast of the foremost savage, again ran, loaded and fired on the last of the In- dians just as he was in the act of hurling his tomahawk at the head of Wetzel. His fire was successful, and all three were dead on the plain. Wetzel secured the evidence of his victory, obtained the horses and over- took his companions before they had stopped for the night. The news of this daring ad- venture soon made him the man of the fron- tier.” “hunting the cows.” It was during the summer of 1782 that two boys belonging to Wheeling were sent out for the purpose of driving back some stray cows which had wandered away. They concluded that they had swam the river and crossed to the Ohio side, so jumping into a canoe they paddled across, and commenced their search for them. While so engaged, they were surprised by three Indians, who were watching them, and by them taken prisoners. Cranmer says: “At once the In- dians set out on their journey, compelling each of the boys to carry a large bag, of which they had several in their possession “From the weight of the bags the boys concluded that they must be filled with gold. Urged as they were to their utmost speed one of them when he could do so unper- ceived would break off twigs from the branches of trees, to mark the direction in which they had traveled. When night came on, the Indians selected a camping place, and prepared to retire, before doing which, how- ever, they tied the hands of the boys, as well as their feet, with strips of bark. They were then compelled to lie down between two of the Indians, while the third Indian seated himself upon a fallen log in front to keep watch. Deering, the elder of the two boys, who was about 15 years of age, managed to disengage his hands from the thongs which bound them, and slyly drew a knife from the belt of one of the sleeping Indians, with which he succeeded in loosing his feet. Overcome with fatigue, the third Indian had braced his back against the trunk of a friend- ly tree, with his legs astraddle of the log upon which he sat. Whispering to his com- panion to lie perfectly quiet, Deering sun- dered the thongs which bound him. With great caution so as not to disturb the sleep- ing Indians, they quietly arose, and the elder of the two took the loaded rifle of one of their captors, placing it upon a log for a rest in a line with the head of one of the sleeping savages, and gave it in charge of the younger brother, and instructed him not to fire, until he gave the signal. “lie himself took a tomahawk, and steal- ing on the sleeping Indian who had been placed on watch instantly buried his toma- hawk in his brains, and then rushed to the Indians lying on the ground, at the same time giving the signal to his companion to fire - '>,( ' > i / i> ■ ftv ijj'.h ; . ■'! ;■ i;!-- j:>.' ?

The Indian at which the younger of the two boys had fired, sprang to his feet howling with rage and pain. The boys not stopping to ascertain the result at once took to their heels and, following the trail over which they had passed the preceding day, late in the afternoon of the day following reached the fort in safety, to the surprise of their friends who had given them up as lost A hunter who was present, and heard the recital given by the boys, who stated in the course of their narration that they believed the bags contained gold, was shortly after- ward missing. “This individual, whose conduct in the past justified the belief (which was general among the settlers), was looked upon as dishonest. The scouting party set out, and found the bodies of two Indians who had been toma- hawked, just as the boys had stated, but no signs of the bags were visible. On their re- turn to the fort they found the suspected hunter still absent, which confirmed the com- mon belief that he had anticipated the visits of the scouts, and secured the bags of gold; for afterwards he became one of the wealth- iest settlers in all the section of country in which he resided.” THE GOBBLER INDIAN. The gobbler Indian incident is so familiar to the youth of the past generation that its repetition scarcely seems necessary today But for the benefit of future generations we give Joshua Davis’ account of it, as related to 1\\. H. Tannyhill 50 years ago: “Well in January, 1783, on the twelfth day, or old Christmas which was always punctually kept at the fort, we had two large turkeys roasted and a lot of twelfth-day cake baked. Twelfth- day cake is made of unleavened dough slightly sweetened with spice, cloves and cinnamon bark worked in it and then baked in a Dutch oven. It w<ts baked a day or two before and eaten cold. When we were killing the turkeys, Wetzel had the feet of one cut off up where the feathers come on and the wings at the first joint, before it was scalded. “These he put away in his hunting bag very carefully. Now for several winters in turkey time, we had been plagued by an In- dian, who conlcl call so much like a turkey that no one could tell the difference. He would secrete himself, and when our men would be creeping along expecting every minute to shoot a turkey he would shoot them. His operations were carried on usual- ly on the ridges north or south of Wheeling Creek in Belmont County. The next morn- ing, an hour or two before day, Wetzel got up, took his riffle down, flung his hunting bag over his shoulder, and took with him the turkey’s feet. The rest I will tell you as he told me. “ ‘I crossed over the river, went up the north side of Wheeling C"
