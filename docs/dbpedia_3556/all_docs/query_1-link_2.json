All Rights Reserved. ^ To my honored friend and co-worker, Rev. John N. Culbertson, of Washington, D. C. this work is respectfully dedicated. INTRODUCTION I have given in this work as accurate and complete a history of the Culbertson and Culberson Families as could be obtained from family records sent me by various fami- lies in this country, Scotland and Ireland; by searching the Will and Deed Records in many of the counties, and assess books in a few counties ; also from records of French and Indian and Revolutionary War soldiers. I have obtained all marriages of Culbertsons given in Pennsylvania Colo- nial Archives. I have \"not left a stone unturned\" in ob- taining full and accurate accounts of various families and my labor has been unceasing and difficult. I have classified the various families into Sections, Parts and Chapters. Have not attempted to give any of the purely Scottish families that came to America until after 1800. There were a great many Irish families came to America since 1800 but I do not include them — with two exceptions — as it would take too much time and labor to trace them out- I have used a key to simplify the work, which is as follows: Letter s means that party was Scotch and emigrated to Ireland. The capitals of alphabet indicate that party emigrated to America but do not mean that parties (capitals) are re- lated. The children of each one that emigrated to America are numbered by Roman numerals I, II, &c., and the grand- children are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. I am indebted to the following parties for valuable information: John N. Cul- bertson, Thomas G. Culbertson of Wheeling, Mrs. Rev. Bigham of Plain Grove, Pa. ; Mr. Henry Culbertson, Medina, Wis.; Mrs. J. Witherspoon; Mrs. Sarah R. H.

Also \"Minute Men.\" CHAPTER I It has generally been supposed by the Culbertsons that their name was originally Cuthbertson and Cuthbert. Wil- liam Arthur in his book on \"Derivation of Family Names\" says that Culbertson comes from the Gaelic word Culb- heart, meaning crafty; and Culbertson, a son of Culbheart. In the same work he gives Cuthbert as a surname. He says that Cuthbert is from the Saxon and means \"famous, bright, of clear skill or knowledge,\" According to Camden, surnames began to be taken up in France about the year 1000 A. D. and in England at the time of the conquest (1066). Before this date in England all documents, etc., were signed thus, *Ego Edmundus (I, Ed- mund) do affirm, etc. The same author (Camden) says that in an old deed made by King Malcolm of Scotland and recorded in 1097, in which he deeds land for a church at Coldingham, one of the noblemen who witnessed the deed signed thus, S, * Culuerti fihi Doncani, etc., i. e. Culuert son of Duncan. Culbert might have been derived from Culuert, as they are spelled almost alike. The Latin Culuertus would be pro- nounced Culwertus. The \"w\" may have been changed to \"b\" for sake of euphony. Or the\"u\" on the deed may have been intended for a \"b\", as it must have been difficult, in those days, for even a nobleman to write his own name. (The Latin for Cuthbert is Cudberctus). The coasts of Scotland were infested by Norse sea-pirates about this time and the Northmen added \"son\" to their surnames in the Tenth Century. The Scotch may have taken up the Norse custom of adding \"son\" to their surnames shortly after this. One might safely say, if a name terminates in \"son,\" that it originated either in Scotland or Norway. It is possible that Culbert, son of Duncan, was the first of the (^ulberts and from some of his descendants, perhaps his son, sprang the first Culbertson. This Culbert was one of the most prominent noblemen at that date. The Duncan family (his father's) was then, and has always been a prominent family in Scotland. King Duncan Mac Crinan (1034-40) was slain in a battle with the forces of MacBeth, (Shakespeare says he was murdered by Mac- GENEALOGY OF beth), who reigned until 1057, when he was defeated and slain by Duncan McCrinan's eldest son Malcolm (Canmore) in 1057 who ascended the throne as Malcolm III and reigned until 1093. This Malcolm was a great and good king and greatly aided Scotland's welfare. It was he who made the deed to the church at Coldingham and he aided religion in every way possible. At his death he was succeeded by his brother Donald Bain, who was deposed in six months by Malcolm's son Edmund who had slain his half brother Dun- can. Edmund was deposed three years later by Edgar Atheling, nephew of Donald. There is no doubt that Cul- bert, who witnessed the deed, was a nephew of Malcolm III (Canmore) ; and that Edmund who witnessed the same deed was the son of Malcolm III. It is probable that he was a younger son, hence did not inherit the title. We are undoubtedly of Celtic origin, as the features indi- cate, i. e. the high cheek bones, blue eyes, broad chin, height, muscular development, and red hair that was found among some of those that came over in the 18th Century, but very rarely seen now. The \"pug\" nose — a Celtic fea- ture— is very rarely seen among the Culbertsons ; nearly all have good sized noses — another Scotch feature. The early, and perhaps the majority of the Culbertsons of the present time, had light hair and blue eyes. This would indicate that centuries ago they either married Sax- ons or Norse or were descended from one or both of these races. The Saxons and Norse overran Northumbria — in which Co. the Co. of Roxburgh was situated — in the Seventh and Eighth Centuries. The Celts crossed over from Ireland to Scotland about the Fifth Century and overran the Highlands defeating the Scots. It is from these that the Scotch got their red hair, likewise the Mac in their names which signifies \"son.\" I have never heard of, nor have I been able to find in history, a McCuthbert or a McCulbert and do not believe such fami- lies ever existed. This fact would tend to show that the family has always lived in the Lowlands, *If any of our name figured as chiefs of Highland Clans it must have been centuries past, as the name does not ap- pear in Burke's Heraldry or in a work on The Scottish Clans. * * * * I will mention a pecuhar fact, that the Culbertson fea- tures are the same wherever you may meet them. This peculiarity occurs in many other families. I might mention THE CULBERTSON FAMILY the most marked of these features are the prominent nose, broad chin, heavy eye brows, as a rule blue eyes, high fore- head and large frame. * * * * The earhest home of the Culbertsons that I have been able to find is in the County Roxburg at a small village named Morebattle, eight miles south of Kelso, Scotland. Here the Culbertsons have lived continuously since the year 1400 A. D. This is in the Lowlands and is about five miles from the Cheviot Hills which form the boundary between Scotland and England, and is on a small stream which empties into the Tweed River. This was the most famous part of Scotland for battles. It was along this border that Earl Percy created such terror and likewise Claverhouse and Cromwell. Also where Wallace and Bruce defeated the Enghsh. The most dreadful cruelties were inflicted on these poor borderers by the English. ** This region abounds in beautiful scenery and historical relics. A few miles west of Kelso is Melrose Abbey where St. Cuthbert Hved and preached in the Seventh Century. It was in this county that religion was first introduced to the Pagan Scots in the Dark Ages. *From the fact that St, Cuthbert hved there 1500 years ago, some might believe we are descended from the Cuth- berts, so we will make brief mention of St. Cuthbert. He was born in this Co., then a part of Northumberland Co., England, Lived at Melrose Abbey and Landisfarne. He was Scotland's Patron Saint. The Scottish battle cry was to St. Cuthbert. Pilgrimages were made yearly, by Chris- tians, to his tomb and this custom was continued for several centuries. I will add in connection with the Cuthberts, that one family belonged to the nobility, and, until about seven- ty-five years ago, was quite a noted family and lived near Inverness. They are not among the nobility now. * * * Jean Baptiste Colbert of France claimed to be descended from a noble Scottish family. There is no doubt but what his statement was true. It is probable that his ancestor went to France with those Scottish soldiers of Lords *There is no coat of arms of the Culbertsons. The Colberts of France have a serpent thereon, likewise the Cuthberts of Scotland have a serpent thereon. The serpent as an emblem is symbolical of wisdom or knowledge. (See previous reference to meaning of Cul- bert and Cuthbert.) **There is a small stream in this region called Cuthbert's Hope, why so called we do not know. *St. Cuthbert is buried in the Cathedral of Durham, England. GENEALOGY OF Buchan and Douglas who assisted King Charles VII of France in opposing the English army of Henry V, about the year 1400, some of whom were made nobles of France. Jean Baptiste Colbert was born 1619 at Rheims, France. He be- gan life as a woolen-draper, but soon after went to Paris where his talents attracted the notice of the great Cardinal Mazarin who was instrumental in making him Minister of Finance. He did more for the financial welfare of France than any Minister that country has ever had. It was under his ministry that France first took rank as a naval power. He founded Academies of Science, Architecture, etc., and instituted stupendous and beautiful public works. France never had but one man that did more for her welfare than Colbert. * Colberts ancestors may have come from Scotland ; some authors claim they did not. It was Colbert who advised Cardinal Mazarin in every- thing and after the latter's death he was the \"power be- hind the throne\" of Louis XIV, of France. Mazarin on his death bed said to Louis, \"Sire, I owe everything to you; but I pay my debt to your majesty by giving you Colbert.\" But to return to my subject, I have gotten the names of all the Culbertsons in Scotland and find that they only hve in Roxburgh Co. and Kintyre, a peninsula on the West Coast. Robert Culbertson of Kelso, Scotland, Co. Rox- burgh, informs me that his great-great-grandfather left Roxburghshire with his regiment, for Ireland about 1690, to quell a rebelhon and his regiment was stationed a long time in Ireland. His time expiring he settled in Mayo Co. and married. His great-grandson returned to Roxburgh- shire, Scotland, in 1845. (The Rebllion referred to was the war between the Prince of Orange and James 11.) The following memoir of Rev. Robt. Culbertson was written in 1826 by Alex. Duncan of Mid Calder, Scotland. In it are named two Culbertsons; two Duncans one Simp- son, which famihes have intermarried in the United States: \"James Culbertson, the father of the author, was a farmer and a Fenar (or Renter) in Morebattle, a village eight miles south of Kelso, Scotland. The mother of the author was named Janet, a cousin of James C, her husband. Robert, the author, was the eldest of seven children. He was b. Sept. 1765— d. Dec. 1823. He entered the University *Colbert's son was an Admiral in the French navy, and Minister of Marine and built the Navy to wonderful efficiency. THE CULBERTSON FAMILY of Edinburg in 1782. Licensed 1790, ordained 1791. He preached to the 'associate congregations' of St. Andrews and St. Leith. He married Elizabeth Richmond 1793. He is buried in the family vault at St. Leiths churchyard.\" He was the author of \"Lectures on Book of Revelations\", Ed. in 3 vols. Pub, London 1826, Dedicated to Marchioness of Huntley. Rev- Culbertson also pub. \"Hints in the Or- dinance in the Gospel Ministry.\" Walter Culbertson of Morebattle writes me that in the old cemetery at Morebattle there are buried many genera- tions of Culbertsons, but all the tombstones are too much worn to be legible except those named above, the first of whom (James) died in Jan. 1826, aged 98 years. The tomb- stone also says that Rev. Robert was minister of U. P. Church, St. Andrews street, Leith; and founder of the U. P. Church in the Islands of Orkney, Scotland in 1796.\" He also says that his (Walter) great-grandfather lived at Morebattle. The Culbertsons of Kintyre date their ancestry thus: Lord Loudon of Ayrshire, Scotland, had a younger son James Campbell, who went from Ayrshire to Argyleshire (Kintyre) Scotland about 1660 A. D. This James Campbell had a daughter, Jean Campbell, who married James Cul- bertson who lived on a farm five miles north of Campbel- town, Kintyre. His farm was called then, as now, Laggan Farm and Culbertsons still live on this farm. This James Culbertson had a son Robert from whom many of the Scotch families in the United States are descended. Lord Loudon was one of the five signers of the first \"Solemn League and Covenant\" in 1638 and was foremost in the cause of the persecuted Covenanters, I have not been able to trace any relation between this James Culbertson and the Scotch Covenanter brothers who went from Scotland to Ireland between 1665-1685. A grand- son of James Culbertson (first) named James lived on Skerbolin Farm near Campbeltown, Kintyre, and his de- scendants still live on this farm- ^ :): H: ^ I have had the following rare old works examined rela- tive to obtaining the names or any information pertaining to the three Scotch brothers who went to Ireland 1665- 1685: Bishop Wm, King's \"State of the Protestants in Ireland;\" \"Bailies Letters and Journals\" 1732-1737; Dodd's \"Fifty Years Struggle\"; Cotton's \"Fasti Ecclesiae Hibern- GENEALOGY OF icae\"; and others, which give no reference to the names Culbertson or Ciithbertson. In Hetherington's History of the Church of Scotland is a Hst of fines imposed by Mid- dleton in Parhament, 1662, some 875 names, and among these was a \"Robert Cuthbertson, Covenanter, fined 360 pounds.\" In the same work is a Hst of Fugitives proscribed by King Charles II, issued May 5, 1684 and containing names of 2000 Covenanters, in which the name Culbertson does not appear, but we find \"Archibald Cuthbertson, a cooper, haunting about Caldermuir in Linlithgowshire.\" The Robert Cuthbertson, before mentioned also lived in Linlithgowshire. The following books were also examined (these are all the books pertaining to the subject that can be found in Washington, D, C.) : Woodrow's \"History of the Church of Scotland\" ; McCries \"Sketches of Scottish Church History\" ; Burton's \"History of Scotland\" and other works but no ref- erence to the name Culbertson or Cuthbertson was found. A careful examination of the entire list of Divines in the Westminster Assembly of 1638, fails to reveal the name Culbertson or Cuthbertson. Family tradition of all the fami- lies in America has it that they were Scotch Covenanters. The Secretary of War of Great Britain informs me that there are no rosters of the troops sent from Scotland to Ireland during the Revolution of 1688, hence we can glean no information from this source. You will all notice that the Duncan family was intimately associated with the Cul- bertsons both in Scotland and America and intermarried with them frequently. Hannahs Scotch-Irish of America, Vol. 1, p. 356: \"Coun- ty of Cavan, precinct of Clanchy, 1000 acres Wm. Baillie. Two leases Stone Bawn Castle; building 4 leases. In 1629 there were eight leasees among whom were Guilbert Cuth- bertson— cottagers, able to produce 28 men with arms.\" Hannah, Ibid: \"In list of banished out of parish of Kil- marnock (Ayrshire) in 1670, is John Cuthbertson (Cul- bertson).\" Rev. John N. Culbertson, Washington, D. C. writes me that he copied from a rare work in Cong. Library, Hills Plantations of Ulster as follows, \"On p. 193, After the sur- vey of 1609, Wm. Baillie of Scotland, was granted 1000 Acres in Co. of Cavan, Ulster, one of the lease-holders of said land was Guilbert Cuthbertson (or Culbertson). In THE CULBERTSON FAMILY 1629, said grant was made a manor, called Bailieborough, and is still on the map in the eastern part of Co. Cavan.\" It will be seen, therefore, that the only Scotch Culbert- sons or Cuthbertsons who resided in Ireland before 1700 were Guilbert before 1609; John 1670; Robert and Archi- bald 1662 and 1684. We do not know positively whether any of these were the ancestors of those that came to America, but no doubt they were. Rev. John N. Culbertson says that, \"In Sir Walter Scott's 'Tales of a Grandfather' he speaks of part of the Campbell Clan, who made a raid across the Scotch Border the night of Queen Elizabeth's death. They met a terrible defeat, and the upshot of the matter was they were transferred to the Northern part of Ireland. There is no doubt a list of these people, but the British Museum and Guild Hall Li- brary in London possess no such list. I have no doubt some of the ancestors could be found on such a list.\" It is probable that Guilbert Cuthbertson is descended from one of these. There is no Gilbert or Archibald among the Culbertsons who came to America before 1800. CHAPTER II Of the history of the families in Ireland, we know but little. There were living in Ireland (1892) families at the following places: Ballj^scanlon and Gortnaskeagh, Co- Donegal; Dublin; Bailymoney, Co. Antrim; Bulaughmore, Co. Tyrone. The Robert Culbertson who owned the Bally- sadare Woolen Mills came from Scotland and shortly after emigrating changed his name from Cuthbertson to Culbert- son because his name had been written Culbertson in a deed. There are several families of Culberts in Ireland, and also Cuthberts. A great many of the families that lived in Ireland have emigrated to America. The Culbertsons of Ireland are, so far as I can learn Pres- byterians. Most of the families in America are Presbyterians. Most of the Culbersons in the Southern part of the United States are Methodists, while some are Baptists. Almost all the famines in the North and West are Presbyterians. GENEALOGY OF As to riches, there are some very wealthy men of our name. One descendant very beautifully and truthfully de- scribed them when she said: \"They were mostly farmers, industrious in their habits, and in quiet home life realized neither the pangs of poverty, nor the pride of riches.\" Many are moderately wealthy. Those who have attained wealth are honest and conscientious business men. Almost all who are wealthy are self-made men. Likewise they are warm-hearted, generous and progressive. The Culbertsons have adhered pretty closely to Horace Greely's advice, \"Young man go West,\" and the majority have profited thereby. * * * * No uulbertson came to America before 1700. * A writer in The Cincinnati Enquirer of Feb. 20, 1893, says of the Scotch-Irish, — \"Their beginning goes back to the invasion of Scotland by the missionary pupils of St- Patrick. He is a combination of the intellectual Irish who kept the light burning while all Europe was in dismal dark- ness; of the strong-bodied Scot; of the audacious Norman; the red-headed Dane and the conservative Saxon. The Scotch -Irish cared not for credit. Achievement was their aim. They led stormy lives in order to enjoy tranquility, that goal of human happiness that few attain. All the great Indian fighters of Ohio were of this race. Fifteen of the Presidents of the U. S. were of Scotch- Irish descent. Sixteen of our Premiers were of this race. Likewise nine secretaries of Treasury ; nineteen out of for- ty-two War Secretaries; twenty-five out of forty-five Asso- ciate Justices of Supreme Court. In the Revolution forty generals were Scotch-Irish. Many generals of our other wars were of Scotch-Irish descent.\" Let us go into the history of Pennsylvania as far as con- cerns Cumberland Valley and adjacent territory. McCau- ley says in his Hist. Sketch of Franklin Co.: \"The first counties erected in the State were Philadelphia, Bucks and Chester, in 1682. The latter extended westward' to the west- ern boundary of Penn's territorial claim, and northward I know no: exactly how far. It included however the terri- tory embraced in this county. In May, 1729, the county of Lancaster was erected out of the western part of Chester Co-, and this section of country was embraced within its Hmits, and there remained until the erection of Cumberland *^See Hotten's Work compiled from Her Majesty's Public Records. THE CULBERTSON FAMILY Co. in 1750. There were no white settlers in this region, that I have been able to hear of, in 1729. There may have been occasional visits made by hunters and scouts but we have no records of them. Bands of Susquehanna and Shawanese Indians held a nominal possession of it but were under the Iroquois or Six Nations. The lands of the Cumberland Valley were not purchased of the Indians until 1736, and were not therefore, before that time open for sale. History says that Benjamin Cham- brs was the first white man who made a settlement in what is now known as Franklin Co., Pa. He was a native of An- trim, Ireland, of Scotch descent, and between the years of 1726 and 1730 emigrated with his brothers to Pa. He push- ed bravely into the forest and was kindly received by the Indians and obtained permission to settle on the place of his choice and make it his own. This was about 1730 and in March 1734, Thomas Blounston, the agent of the proprie- taries, gave him a license to \"settle and improve 400 acres of land at Falhng Springs mouth.\" The Scotch-Irish flow- ed into the valley in vast numbers and from 1730 to 1735 settled upon and improved large tracts of land from the Susquehanna to the southern line of the province. The pre- cise date at which settlers began to locate at Greencastle, Rocky Spring, Middle Spring, Shippensburg, etc., are not known, as m many cases the earlier records of even the churches of the valley are lost; but they must have been commenced between the years 1730 and 1735, for within a few years afterwards Presbyterian congregations were or- ganied at nearly all these places. By the year 1740 churches were found dotted over the broad bosom of this valley, al- most invariably in a grove of shady trees, and near a spring of pure crystal water. In 1735 \"North Valley\" was divided into two townships, \"Pennsborough\" and \"Hopewell.\" In 1741 Hopewell was subdivided mto Hopewell and Antrim Tps- Peters Tp. was settled as early as 1730. The \"Upper West Conococheague Church\" (Presbyterian) was organized in 1738. Lurgin Tp. adjoined Peters. Settlements were made in Letterken- ny Tp. as early as 1730. Rocky Springs Church, organized about 1738, is in this Tp. Green Tp. originally within Letterkenny Tp. In this Tp. lived the Culbertsons, McClays, Hendersons, Criswells, Johnsons, etc., who lived there many years and were buried there. \"The church Records of Rocky Spring, as well as 10 GENEALOGY OF other churches, were destroyed during the Rebel raid on Chambersburg.\" Rev. Nevin, in \"Eminent Men of Cumberland Valley,\" says of the Rocky Spring Church: \"It is on the Strasburg road about four miles from Chambersburg. The original edifice stood between the present building and the grave- yard. It was erected about 132 years ago (1740) and was a rough log building a story and a half high. It had one row of windows on the lower story, the lights of which were few and small in number. The present building was built in 1794. This has been enlarged from time to time by building additions- The first minister was Rev, John Craig- head— after whom Capt, John Culbertson of Cincinnati was named — next Rev. Francis Herron D. D. who preached here ten years, then became pastor of the First Presbyterian church of Pittsburgh ; the pulpit was filled by Rev. John McKnight, who after preaching several years removed to Philadelphia. Rev. Nelson was preaching here in 1840.\" Rocky Spring Church is still standing and the name \"Sam- uel Culbertson\" carved one one of the pews. Old Fort Cul- bertson, built as a protection against the Indians, stood near the spring on Col. Joseph's farm. It has long since been pulled down. General John Rea's pew, with his name carved thereon, is still in Rocky Spring church. \"Gentleman James\" Cul- bertson's farm lay north of Col. Sam's and separated by a lane. The farm of Joseph, son of Col. Robert, lay west of and adjoining that of \"Gentleman James\". Col. Robert's farm lay between Col. Sam's and Col. Joseph's farm. Some fifteen years ago a large granite monument was erected in Rocky Spring Church yard with a bronze tablet containing the names of a number of Culbertsons who were in the Colonial and Revolutionary Wars. Rev. John N. Cul- bertson secured the money to do this by subscription. An- other tablet has been put on (1922) containing names of all Culbertsons in America in Revolutionary, Colonial and ear- ly Indian wars. This was paid for by subscriptions of Cul- bertsons in 1921-22. KEY S. See Introduction. A. B. C. D. etc. See Introduction.

Culbertson, who emigrated from Scotland to County of Derry near Londonderry, Ireland, about 1665- 1687. One of his brothers settled in Omagh, Tyrone Co., Ireland ; another at Ballygan, near Ballymoney, Co. Antrim, Ireland. The settlement of the last named brother was called \"Culbertson Row\", and it was from this the \"Row\" in Pennsylvania derived its name. These brothers were Scotch Covenanters and were driven from Scotland during the reign of James II of England. King Charles II ascended the throne of England in the year 1660 and the persecutions of the Covenanters began about 1665 and continued throughout his reign. The poor Scotch Presbyterians being hunted down without mercy, sought refuge in northern Ireland. The emnity of the treacherous and false King Charles followed them to Ire- land. Charles II on ascending the throne had promised the Scotch Presbyterians that he would protect them as his grandfather, James I, had done. (James I was a Presby- terian and was called \"Good King Jamie\" by the Scotch, he being a Scotchman.) Charles II was a Catholic, as was also his father, Charles I. On the death of Charles II in 1685, his son, James II, ascended the throne. He immediately began to persecute the Covenanters in Scotland and Ireland. The Scotch-Irish rose in rebellion against King James II, and fled to several fortified cities in northern Ireland. One of these cities was Londonderry. Within its walls 7000 men were beseiged and at the end of the seige their numbers were reduced by famine and disease to 3000, all Protestants. King James was in command of the Catholic army. William, Prince of Orange, with a large fleet then sailed into Londonderry Bay and drove King James away in 1688. The Prince of Orange was a staunch Protestant and married Mary, the oldest daughter of James II of England, and by right the heir apparent- The great Battle of Boyne was fought in 1690, by the forces of King William and King James and the latter was completely routed and James became an exile, while William ascended the throne. After this the Scotch-Irish had comparative quiet. 14 GENEALOGY OF William Culbertson (so say family records) was one of the defenders in the seige of that place in 1688. This was one of the most memorable seiges in history. The defenders were reduced to eating horse and dog flesh and even minis- ters fought on the walls. I am informed by parties in Lon- donderry, Ireland, that there are no Culbertsons living in the County Derry now, but there are Culbertsons living at Balyscanlon, Co. Donegal, which is not far from London- derry. Wrote this family but received no reply. There was also a family lived at Newton Stewart, Co. Tyrone, Ireland, that may be descended from one of (s) Culbertsons. This town is very near Londonderry. The \"Row\" in Antrim Co., Ireland, is only a few miles from the boundary between Antrim and Derry Counties, (s) John(?) Culbertson who emigrated from Scotland to Ireland. SECOND GENERATION Issue: A. John, b. 1680-90; d. Nov. 1756. (See Sec. First; Part Second.) B. Robert, b. 1692 or before : d. 1762. (See Sec. First ; Part Third.) C. Andrew, d. 1746. (See Sec. First; Part Fourth.) D. Samuel, d- 1749. (See Sec. First; Part Fifth.) E. Oliver, d. 1792. (See Sec. First; Part Sixth.) Nephew of Robert, Andrew and Samuel. The descendants of John (A) hving in Erie Co., Pa., claim that (A) John's father was William Culbertson one of the defenders of Londonderry, Ireland — before mentioned — in 1788. (Colter Genealogy of Culbertsons of Erie Co., Pa., pub. 1889.) The above or part of them may be descended from Scotch — John Cuthbertson (Culbertson?) banished from Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Scotland in 1670 (before men- tioned). The Culbertson-Colter Genealogy by J. P. Colter on page 83 says: \"The earliest record we have of them in Ireland was at the seige of Londonderry. We learn from family records that Wm. Culbertson was one of the defenders of the Seige of Londonderry.\" Whether Colter actually had any Bible record of this I do not know. His statement would not tally with a statement of John Culbertson of Duluth, THE CULBERTSON FAMILY 15 Minn., in 1892. in which he said: \"I have in my possession a cane brought from Ireland by John Culbertson, my an- cestor, and which has been handed down through the fam- ily through seven generations of John Culbertsons.\" The man who made this statement was the seventh generation. The man who settled in Chester Co., Pa., in 1712 and on tax record there 1713 (A-John) was the second John, therefore the first John who had the cane was Scotch John and very likely the John Cuthbertson above mentioned as banished from Ayrshire in 1670. SECTION FIRST PART SECOND (A) IRISH JOHN OF CHESTER CO., PA., AND CUMBERLAND CO., PA. THIRD GENERATION (A) John Culbertson, emigrated to America in 1712 or before and settled in Londongrove Tp., Chester Co., Pa. He landed at New Castle, Del., and at once settled in Ches- ter Co. with his brother Robert. Tradition says he had four sons but I here give facts taken from Will, Deed Records. First appears on tax records in 1713, in Chester Co. (Rec- ords of New Castle Co., Del. show that no Culbertson lived in Delaware at this early date.) His name does not appear on the tax books after 1726. Margaret Culbertson, who married in 1739, Robert Jackson at St. Paul's Episcopal Church at Chester (Pa. Col. Arch.) was either his daughter or niece. Whether or not he was the father of John Cul- bertson of Brandywine Tp., Chester Co., is a question, yet it is almost certain that he was. He left no will in Chester, Lancaster or Cumberland counties and no administration of his estate and no deeds to or from him. Many settlers located on lands in Pennsylvania before 1734 and paid taxes on same but could get no warrants until 1734. There is no warrant to this John Culbertson. John Esq. of Brandywine Tp., may have been his son, and probably was, and he left him in Chester Co. in 1727-8 (he would then have been 17 or 18 years of age) ; or John Esq. may have been a nephew and may have been raised in Chester Co. by his uncle An- drew or Robert, of Kennett Tp. John moved to Lancaster Co., Pa. in 1727-8 to what was later Shippensburg, Cumberland Co., Pa., Wing's History of Cumberland Co., states, \"Among the first twelve settlers at Shippensburg in 1730 were John Culbertson.\" Dr. Eagle in Queries on Culbertsons of Culbertson Row, states, \"In the Indian foray, among the settlers killed in Nov. 1756 at THE CULBERTSON FAMILY 17 Shippensburg was John Culbertson,\" John Culbertson in a letter dated at Shippensburg May 7, 1756, writes Col. Burd, \"that he had talked with an Indian at Big Cove, who had been captured at Ford Littleton and that this Indian was in the Battle of Sideling Hill, April 2, 1756, and that the In- dians lost 17 killed and 21 wounded.\" John seems to have been a scout for Col, Burd. There is no deed or court rec- ord to show that Oliver Culbertson was a son of John Sr. or Shippensburg. It is my opinion that Oliver was John's son and a nephew of Irish Andrew of Shippensburg. Issue of Irish John and wife : (I) John (Esq. of East Coin. Tp., Chester Co., Pa.) b. 1710; d. Nov. 11, 1767. (Chapter III). (E) Oliver (See Sec. First, Part Sixth). There was a John Culbertson, Augusta Co., Va. in 1753-4. This was John Culbertson of Shippensburg, Pa,, no doubt. No record of his appears prior to this in Orange Co., Va. or Augusta Co., Va. It is my opinion that he left Cumber- land Co-, Pa. in the spring of 1751 with Andrew Culbertson and went with him to Augusta Co., Va. The only record we have of him in Augusta Co., Va. is in Order Book No. 5, p. 20: \"Nov. Court 1755, David Stuart vs. John Culbertson. Defendant being removed out of the county and not ar- rested, the suit dismissed.\" John of Rowan Co., N. Car. first appears on deed records of N. Car. in 1765. I do not be- heve he was of age before 1762-3. Rev. John N. Culbertson of Washington, D. C. has suggested that this might have been Irish John (First) of Shippensburg, sent to Va. on scout duty by Col. Burd. This John seemed to have no fixed abode, or at least had no property. John removed from Augusta Co. and returned to Shippensburg, Pa. The Auditor of Taxes of Lancaster Co., Pa. informs me that they have none of the old tax books 1730-50 of the ter- ritory north and west of the Susquehanna. These have been lost or were taken to Harrisburg State Library years ago and any information therein transcribed to Colonial Archives. From these archives I have gleaned any infor- mation obtainable. 18 GENEALOGY OF CHAPTER III (I) John Culbertson came to America when a child. Was raised in Londongrove Tp., Chester Co., Pa- Was a promi- nent man of Chester Co., Pa, Was appointed Lieut, of Pa, Provincial Militia from Chester Co., Pa., in Col. Moore's Battalion in the year 1748. (See Pa. Colonial Arch.). Can find no further mention of him in Archives but presume he served in French and Indian War. 1st Battn. Capt. John McCall (Futhey's Hist.) \"By a Patent of the Penns he was, on Jan. 15, 1739, granted a tract of land in East Coin Tp., Chester Co-, Pa.\" Here he died and was buried at Brandywine Manor. A deed at date of Oct. 1770 shows his children residing in the fol- lowing Tps. : \"Andrew in West Coin ; James in East Coin ; John in East Coin; Samuel in Carnarvon Tp. — Berks Co.; Benjamin in Chester Co. and son-in-law Benjamin Wallace.\" Sometime after the death of her husband (John I) his widow lived in Lancaster Co., Pa., and made her will in that Co. in 1809. Part of her farm was in Chester and part in Lancaster counties. {1) John Culbertson was mar. to Ehza Rogers in 1731 at the First Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia, Pa. (Pa. Arch.). Part of his children were by this wife. She died. He married second, Mrs. Abigail Whitehill (from will) who had three children when he married her, namely Margaret, John and Jean Whitehill, who were named in John Culbert- son's will, made in Chester Co-, Pa., Aug. 26, 1767. His second wife, Abigail, made her will in Lancaster Co., Pa., in 1809, and in it she devises to her grandson, son of Jane Boyd ; and to John Boyd, son of Margaret. I presume these two daughters must have been the Whitehill children, as Margaret and Jane Culbertson do not appear in John Cul- bertson's will. Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 appear on his will. The other children were obtained from family rec- ords. FOURTH GENERATION Issue, by both wives: 1. Andrew, b. 1731 ; d. 1797. . 2. James, b. 1733; d. 1777. 3. Jane, b. 1735- 4. John, b. 1737 ; d.

Deed Records ol Chester Co., Pa., show that he deeded the last of his prop- erty in that Co., in July, 1775, to James Clemson, hatter. Owned a tract of land along the river below Deerstown, near Lewisburg, Pa. Was a private in Col. Hunter's Bat- talion of Associaters, from Northumberland Co., in July, 1776 and served until close of the war. Was in a battle with the Indians, on Bald Eagle Creek, Center Co., Pa., on Apr. 10, 1782, in which the whole force was killed excepting the commander. Major Moses Van Campen, Andrew Culbert- son and one other. He was a wealthy man, and at his death left 907 acres in Lycoming Co., Pa- Appointed Chief Exec- utive Officer of Northumberland Co. for carrying into ef- fect the orders of Congress. (Pa. Arch.) (2) James Culbertson was commissioned by Gov. Denny, of Pa., May 1, 1758, to be Ensign of a company, in Col. Hugh Mercer's Battalion (Regt.), the Third Bat. of Pa. Provincial Troops, in the French and Indian War. Ensign James marched to Ft. Duquesne in winter of 1758. He was in the Revolution, as well as his son, John, and while they were at home on a furlough and eating their dinners, the Indians took them by surprise and shot them down. The THE CULBERTSON FAMILY 33 son was only fifteen years old. His children (it is asserted) were granted a magnificent pension of almost a whole county in Va., or Maryland, but for some reason did not take up the claim, and their papers were foolishly destroy- ed. (I could find no evidence of this on any records.) The Pa. Archives, at Harrisburg, Pa., do not give his record, which was no doubt destroyed in Philadelphia in 1800. His descendants have his commission in the French and Indian War. There was no administration or will of his, nor deeds recorded in Lancaster or Chester Co., hence he lived in Northumberland Co. at his death. His brother Andrew probably bought his land, as deeds show that Andrew's Ex'rs., sold the ''James Culbertson tract of 213 acres in 1797.\" (4) Major John Culbertson was buried at Brandywine Manor, Chester Co., Pa. The following beautiful epitaph appears on his tombstone: \"My flesh shall slumber in the grave, 'Till the last tnamphets joyful sound, Then burst the chains with sweet surprise And in my glorious image arise.\" He was in the battle of Long Island in the fall of 1776, be- ing a Major in Col. James Moore's Battalion (First) of Chester Co., Pa., Associaters of the \"Flying Camp.\" (See Barrie's Army and Navy of the U. S., ed. de luxe, supple- mentary, p. 9.) He was commissioned Major, July 1, 1776. Stationed at Perth Amboy, N. J., under Gen. Mercer, Aug. 14, 1776; at Ft. Lee, Aug. 20, 1776 (Amer. Arch.) He was a \"delegate to the Associated Battalion Convention, at Lan- caster, Pa., July 4, 1776.\" (Pa. Arch.) His brother, \"An- drew, a private from Northumberland Co., Pa., was also a delegate to this Convention.\" (Pa. Arch.) John was com- missioned Major of Col. William Gibbons' Battalion (Sev- enth), of Chester Co., Pa., Associaters, May 17, 1777. In 1779, he was a Major of Lieut. Col. John Gardner's Bat- tahon (Fifth), of Chester Co. Associaters. This made him virtually Lieut. Col. Was commissioned May 10, 1780, Major of Lieut. Col. John Gardner's (First) Battalion of Chester Co. Associaters.\" Futhey's Hist. Chester Co. says he was born 1739. Member Pa. Assembly 1777-80. (5) Capt. Samuel Culbertson of Pikeland Tp., Chester Co., a member of the Com. of Public Safety, Oct. 23, 1775, at a meeting at which Anthony Wayne was chairman. (Pa. Arch.) Com. of Safety also published notice \"for a meeting 34 GENEALOGY OF to study the art of making a salt-petre, at the house of Mr. Culbertson at the Yellow Springs, on 4th and 5th of March, 1776.\" (Pa. Arch.). He was an inn-keeper on License Rec- ords up to and including 1782, but not in 1783, at which date his brother John's name appears. I find in Deed Records of Chester Co., that on Mar. 1776, there was recorded a deed made by Samuel Culbertson to The Proprietaries of Pa., for land in Coventry Tp., Chester Co. This was for salt-petre beds- He was present at a meeting of the Com. of Safety at Downingtown, Chester Co., Pa., on July 1, 1776, where it was \"agreed to raise a battalion of 652 men.\" (Pa. Arch.). \"Capt. Samuel was appointed, July 1776, Capt. in Col. Wm. Montgomery's Battalion of Chester C!o. Associaters of the \"Flying Camp.\" (Am. Arch. 4th ser., vol. VI, p. 1196.) The Flying Camp constituted the Brigade in New Jersey under command of Brig. Gen. Hugh Mercer. \"Col. Wm. Montgomery's Regt. was at Perth Amboy in July, 1776, and remained there until August 14, 1776 ; ; at Ft. Lee, N. J., Aug. 20, 1776. From Fort Lee, Gen. Mercer moved to Long Island-\" (Amer. Arch.) Saf fell's Record of the Revolution- ary War says of him: \"Capt Samuel Culbertson, of Wm. Montgomery's Regt. was captured Nov. 16, 1776, at Ft. Washington. He was a prisoner, with certain bounds, on Long Island until Aug. 16, 1779, when he was ordered into the city prison of New York. Lewis Pintard and Col. Pal- fry supplied him in 1776 and '77 with money. He was ex- changed Nov. 2, 1780, at Elizabethtown, N. J. and made his way to his place of abode at Yellow Springs, Pa- Capt. Culbertson was possessed of fine literary abilities and mili- tary talents.\" His administration shows that his wife died before he did. Samuel Culbertson died in East Cain township, Chester Co., Pa. Letters of administration were granted for his estate January 8, 1783. Brother John, Admnr. Inventory of his estate shows \"One silver stock buckle, one pair of silver sleeve buttons, two certificates for depreciation for pay as Capt. of the Flying Camp.\" I neglected to state that the father of Isaac Vanleer, who married Elizabeth Culbertson, was Samuel Vanleer. Said Samuel was a captain in Chester Co., Pa. militia in the Rev- olution. He married Hannah Wayne, of Chester Co., Pa., a sister of Gen. \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne, of Revolutionary fame and a daughter of Isaac Wayne, an officer in the THE CULBERTSON FAMILY 35 French and Indian War. Samuel Vanleer had several sons: Anthony W. Vanleer, who went to Nashville, Tenn., and became one of the wealthiest iron-masters of Tennessee. One of his daughters, Mrs. Polk married a cousin of Presi- dent Polk, and one of her daughters married one of the highest barons in Italy, and another a French count- Her son. Van Leer Polk, of Tennessee was Consul-General of the United States to Calcutta, India. Mrs. Polk moved to Rome, Italy, during the Civil War, and the family were intimate friends of King Humbert. Her daughter and her husband were warm friends of the Marquis and Marchioness of Lome, and exchanged visits. The descendants of A. W. Van Leer's other daughter, Mrs. Kirkham, live in Nashville, be- ing among the wealthiest people of that place. Her daugh- ter married Capt Drouillard, U. S. Army, who became a Tenn. iron-master after the war and died over 55 years ago. Another son of Isaac Van Leer was Bernard Van Leer, who was an iron-master at Nashville, another son of Isaac was WilHam who died 1895 at Downington, Chester Co., Pa., aged over 90 years. His daughter married H. M. Richards, Sec'y of the German Society of Pa., and resides at Reading. Issue Isaac Van Leer and Elizabeth Culbertson: 1. Hannah Vanleer, daughter of Isaac and Elizabeth Van- leer, b. Dec. 4, 1804. 2. Margaret Vanleer, daughter of Isaac and Elizabeth Vanleer, b. Dec. 14, 1805. 3. Linford L. Vanleer, b. Mar. 26, 1806 (son of Isaac and Elizabeth Vanleer). 4. Wayne Vanleer, son of Isaac and Elizabeth Vanleer, born June 24, 1810. (1) Hannah Vanleer married first John Kennedy, of near Pittsburg, who moved to Tennessee in 1825, and had one child, who died young. Husband died in 1846, widow re- married to Hardman Stone, and had two sons, Samuel B. Stone and Robert B. Stone- (2) Hannah Vanleer married a Mr. Nopper, and had chil- dren-— Montgomery, Margaret and Mary Nopper. (3) (Data not furnished). 36 GENEALOGY OF The Census of 1790 for Tedriffen Tp., Chester Co., Pa., gives Isaac Van Leer, self and wife, 4 sons under 16 and 2 daughters. This makes it pretty certain that Bernard and WilHam, sons of Isaac Van Leer, above were by the first wife. There were two other sons whose names I do not know, who may have died young. Elizabeth Culbertson (34) must have been his second wife. Her father was born 1744 and probably married 1763-5. If Elizabeth was born 1764-6 she would have been old enough to have married by 1783-5 and borne six children by 1790. His brother-in-law Benjamin Wallace was a captain in Col. Wm. Montgomery's Bat. of the \"Flying Camp,\" July 1, 1776, in Chester Co., Pa. Futhey's History of Chester Co., says that \"In 1785 a change of election districts was made and the polhng place of the Third Dist, was held at the sign of the Pennsylvania Arms, at the home of John Culbertson, of E. Coin Tp.\" Also, \"among the first trustees of Brandy- wine Church, at the organization in 1786 were John Cul- bertson and (his cousin) Samuel.\" This church is in the northwestern part of the county. \"Major John Culbertson was an active Whig during the Revolution.\" (Ibid). Was a fuller. (9) Benjamin Culbertson was appointed Lieut, in Col. Wm. Montgomery's Battahon of Chester Co., Associaters of the \"Flying Camp,\" July 1, 1776. (See Am. Arch., 4th ser. vol VI, p. 1196). Pa. Archives do not mention his serv- ice after Dec. 1776. Family records say he was \"drowned in the Delaware River.\" (Probably during Revolution.) (12) Wm. Culbertson was one of the early settlers of Edinboro, Erie Co., Pa., where he engaged in milling and farming. Was also Justice of the Peace. (29) WilHam served from 1778 to 1782 in Capt. CorneHus Atkinson's Co. Northumberland Co Mil.\" (Pa. Arch.). Not in Census alone or with his father, Chester Co., Pa., 1790. (See sons over 16). (37) Andrew C. was in same business and his grand- son, (102) Hon. Wm. C. Culbertson was a wealthy Congress- man, capitalist and lumber merchant, of Girard, Pa. He had business interests in Erie Co., Pa., Michigan, Minne- sota, Missouri, various places in Pennslvania, Kentucky, etc. For some time he was associated with his brother, J. A. Culbertson, in the lumber business with offices at Chicago, THE CULBERTSON FAMILY 37 111., and Covington, Ky., and they were rated by Bradstreet at over $1,000,000. They closed out their business at Chi- cago some years ago, and James A. now lives at Menominee, Mich. His brother Charles had extensive lumber and farm- ing interests in Minnesota. William M. Culbertson, a son of the Congressman, is a wealthy miller at Girard, Pa- Hon. W. C. Culbertson of Girard, Pa., was Capt. in a Kentucky (Union) Regt. during the Civil War (1892). (87) John H. Culbertson was recorder of Crawford Co., Pa. in 1854. His son John T. (195) is the owner of a cane which has been handed down through seven generations of John Culbertsons, having been brought from Ireland in 1713 and is, I presume, the oldest heirloom of any Cul- bertson family in this country. He is a prominent business man of Duluth, Minn- (1892). (181) Miss Margaret Culbertson, Supt. of the Chinese Mission Home, San Francisco, went to California in 1878 and engaged in mission work among the Chinese. Her work has been one of the noblest and yet most difficult that man or woman has been called upon to perform. \"When she first assumed charge of the home there were about ten girls. Since that time about four hundred women and chil- dren have found shelter there. She has defended these helpless ones even at risk of her life until the very police of Chinatown have come to say that she is braver than most men.\" (From Occidental Leaves). PART THIRD SECTION FIRST Irish Robert! (B) of Chester Co., Pa. (B) PART THIRD (IRISH ROBERT OF KENNETT TP., CHESTER, PA.) THIRD GENERATION (B) Robert Culbertson (Irish) of Kennett Tp., Chester Co., Pa. made his will in Mar. 1762 and will was probated May 3, 1762. Devisees were wife Jean, son Samuel, and grandson John, son of his son (I) Samuel; daughters Mary, Martha, Isabella, Sarah. Recites that one-third of his es- tate shall go to his son Samuel, also a negro boy named Dirk, providing that Samuel takes his mother and sisters to Cumberland Co., Pa. and provides for them until his sisters' marriage, and in case he does not comply his one-third shall go to son-in-law Alex Porter. His widow Jane made her will in Sept 17, 1769 (probated Oct. 1769) and died shortly after. She devises to her daughters, and grand- child John, son of son Samuel. States that owing to the fact that son Samuel has not complied with his father's wishes she cuts him out in her will. In sale bill of Robert's est. Samuel refuses to act as ex'r. and the negro was sold at sale for £55, showing that Samuel received nothing. In the final account of widow's estate in 1773 shows Elizabeth, Martha and Isabella were dead. Exrs. paid £69 each to Jane (Hill), Mary (Gordon) and Sarah Barclay. The will states that Sarah Barclay is to receive £81, but £10 is to be de- ducted from this to pay grandson John Culbertson's be- quest. This was done in settlement showing John was liv- ing. Samuel was given in the first edition of this Gene- alogy on Pages 21 and 45 as a son of Irish John of London- grove Tp. (came over 1712), but Samuel was of too late a date to have been his son, also I could not find him on tax lists of 1740 or 1730, yet he must have been born -by or be- for 1741 as he is on tax duplicate in 1762 in Vincent Tp. His son Samuel was of age in 1771 (Jan 22) as Samuel and his son Samuel were deeded 200 acres by Jane Lockart, widow, and Robt. Lockart and wife in Vincent Tp., Chester THE CULBERTSON FAMILY 39 Co., Pa., Jan. 22, 1771. Samuel's son John did not partici- pate in this transaction in 1771. This became the home farm of Samuel and son Samuel. John was not dead as he was mentioned in Samuel Sr.'s will in 1782. Not ha\\dng participated in the purchase in 1771 he would not transfer in 1791. Why Irish Robert of Kennett should have mentioned grandson John, and not grandson Samuel, I could not say, unless it be that grandson Samuel having ample means by inheritance through his wife Agnes Beatty did not need it. David Beatty had died before Irish Robert Culbertson. Neither Samuel nor his sons Samuel or John, are found on the tax list of Kennett in 1766. Widow Jane (or Robert) is on 1766. In the will of Samuel of E. Coin made 1782, the witnesses are Eliz. North, John Culbertson Esq. and wife Sarah. This was his second cousin, John of Brandywine, i. e. Major. m his will probated May 9, 1788, he says: \"And whereas I am now possessed of the one divided moiety or half part of the plantation on which I live, containing 200 acres to- gether with half of the live stock and implements and half of all the household furniture now on farm. Item, I give to my nephew David, son of my son Samuel, all of my part of the above described plantation, &c.\" This real estate was subject to specific legacies of money to other heirs.

(Sliippensburg) (C) PART FOURTH (C) Andrew Culbertson emigrated to America from Lon- donderry Co., Ireland, and settled in Kennett Tp., Chester Co., Pa., before 1726. He is on tax records of this county until 1728, but left Chester Co. in 1728-29 and settled in Hopewell Tp., Lancaster (now Cumberland Co., Pa.) Co., in 1729, being one of the very first permanent settlers of the present Cumberland Co., Pa. There is little doubt but that he was with the first party of Benjamin Chambers that went to Cumberland Co., Pa. He probably did not come to America with Chambers' party. He lived but a short dis- tance from the Row and his descendants have always been regarded as belonging to the Row, but they did not, as that term was applied to the settlement of the three Irish broth- ers, Alex., Robert and Samuel and cousin Joseph. He was an uncle of the three \"Pa. Row\" brothers. Alex., Joseph and Samuel were named as his bondsmen in the administration of his estate, filed in 1746, and his (Andrew's) son, Samuel, was his administrator. An inventory of his estate was filed in 1747, of which I have a copy. On it his name is written Colbertson. It is quite interesting and shows that he was one of the wealthiest men of the Cumberland Valley. The total value of the inventory was about $4000, a very large sum for those days. Division of his estate was made in Cumberland Co., in 1750, from which I obtained names of his children, the last five being minors at that date. I should suppose from this that he must have been born before 1700. His land was assessed in inventory at £280. About this date the Proprietaries were receiving for land in Pa. £15, 10 shilhngs per 100 acres. The names of his chil- dren are derived from inventory and division of his estate. 44 - GENEALOGY OF In May 1748 his widow Janet took out a warrant for 50 acres in Hopewell Tp., Lancaster Co., Pa. Patent not re- turned on this until Jan. 18, 1775. This patent was returned with 33 acres which evidently was allowed or purchased by her from her first husband's estate. Order of resurvey was given Mar. 5, 1767, and in this plat is 83 acres. Adjoining land is Ed. Shippen, Isaac Miller, Sam Montgomery and Jas. Silver. Pat recites \"that Janet Culbertson intermarrying with John Miller, by deed Jan. 13, 1775, granted said land to Robert Culbertson.\" This was her son. Land was in Ship- pensburg. The appraisers of his estate were John Miller, Allen Kil- lough and Robert Dwining and they filed inventory at Lan- caster, Pa., in March 1747. Janet Culbertson took out a war- rant for land in what was then Lancaster Co., Pa. in 1748. This was Andrews widow and she had not married John Miller at that time. Andrew (Irish) is first found on tax records of Chester Co., Pa. in 1726. He is not on the records of 1713. The rec- ords for intervening years between 1713-1726 are missing so we do not know just when he began paying taxes and when he was of age, or when he came to America. Five of his children were of age in 1750. He was probably married about 1720 as several of his children were married in 1740. He was an uncle, same say a cousin of the three brothers of the \"Culbertson Row.\" He received a Warrant from Gov. Edward Shippen for 240 acres of land in Hopewell Tp., Lan- caster Co., Pa. in 1740. This was partly outside and partly inside Shippensburg. Tradition says he married a sister of James Breckenridge ; also that James Breckenridge (First) was married to Andrew's sister. Also that he was a brother-in-law to Robert (Irish) Culbertson of Peters Tp. Andrew's widow, several years after his death, married John Miller. He was one of the appraisers of Andrew's estate in March, 1747. In 1751, James Culbertson of Hope- well Tp, ; Wm. Carr and Elizabeth, his wife; Andrew Cul- bertson and wife, Esther, made a quit claim to their broth- er Samuel. Jane conveyed by her g'd'n N. Wilson, 1751. In Nov., 1753, Samuel Culbertson, of Hopewell Tp., and wife, Mary, deeded this property to Francis Campble (275 A.), said Andrew having died intestate, 98 acres of said tract fell to the share of the heirs Samuel, James, Elizabeth and Andrew and Jane. The said Samuel having purchased the shares of James, Elizabeth (now Mrs. Kerr), THE CULBERTSON FAMILY 45 Andrew and wife and Jane, by her Gd'n N. Wilson and Francis Campbell, Gd'n of Robert, Sarah and Rebecca, deed for them in 1753. Andrew's son, James, moved to Chester Co., Pa., in 1751. In the old Genealogy, he was given by error as a son of Irish John of Chester Co., Pa., James willed to (Oct. 14, 1763) brothers: Samuel, Robert; sisters, Jane, Sarah (Breckenridge), Martha (Miller), Rebecca (Park). It will be seen from this that three of his brothers and sisters are not mentioned, i. e. Andrew, Elizabeth and Mar- garet. It is my behef that in 1763 the two sisters were dead. There were no deeds to Margaret, showing she died in 1750-51. In his will he mentions Rebecca (Mrs. Park). This shows that she was married to Park in 1763, but later she became a widow and married Mr. Cravenstine, some records say from Va., but Census Records show they lived in Ger- mantown, Philadelphia. Martha married Gideon Miller of Allegheny Co., Pa. (who served in Revolution with Cumb. Co. Ass'rs.) and afterwards moved to Allegheny Co., Pa. Elizabeth married Wm. Kerr of \"Culbertson Row\", Jane married OHver Culbertson (Irish) of Lurgan Tp., Cumb. Co., Pa., and later moved to Armstrong Tp., Westmoreland Co., Pa. ; Sarah married John Breckenridge before 1763 and lived in the \"Row\". Issue: Samuel, Janet (Mrs. Benj. John- ston), Sarah (unmarried), Elizabeth (Mrs. Jas. Herron), Polly (Mrs. Jas. Shoaff), Nancy (Mrs. Robert Culbertson of Ambersons Valley), Sarah (Mrs. Archibald Mahon). The estate of James, son of Irish Andrew, was adminis- tered in Chester Co., Pa. Records there show he owned no real estate. James Reynolds and Robert Peoples, appraisers, were sworn in Cumb. Co. His brother Robert named execu- tor— renounced. THIRD GENERATION Issue Andrew and Janet: I. Samuel, b. ; d. 1799, Washington Co., Tenn., (Chapter V). II. James, b. ; d.

His will made in Washington Co., Tenn. shows that he had mar- ried a second time and that his second wife's name was Jane. I think it very probable that all his children were by the first wife. The youngest child named in his will was Mary, the same as his first wife's name. He left Cumb. Co, Dec, 1753 and moved to Va. (see Second Washington Va. Reports, page 54, James Burnside vs. A. Reid, Samuel Cul- bertson, etc.). This report shows that Andrew Culbertson made settlement on a piece of land known as \"Culbertson's Bottom\", and after living on it for a time, had to abandon it because of the Indians, and he sold it to his brother Samuel in 1754,. who Kved on it for a while, but he, too, had to abandon it for fear of the Indians. Two other men set- tled on the land which led to a long law suit. It was finally settled in U. S. Supreme Court in favor of Samuel Culbert- son, because he had first settled the land. This case was con- cluded in 1786. This land in 1779 was in Rockbridge Co., Va., between the Cow Pasture and Greenbrier River. Power of Atty. was given May 19, 1779 by Samuel Culbertson of Washington Co., N. Car. to A. Reid of Rockbridge Co., Va., relative to this land. This data shows he did not hve in Va. during the Revolution and was not the Doctor of the 12th Va. line. He Hved in Washington Co., N. Car. in 1787, as shown by a deed of Power of Atty. to S. Colwell on file in Cumb, Co,, Pa,, in which he authorizes him to sell land in Cumb, Co,, Pa, Deed says he is a planter and is witnessed THE CULBERTSON FAMILY 47 by his son, Joseph. Johnston's \"Middle New River Settle- ments\" says that \"Culbertson Bottom\" is near present Hin- ton, W. Va. (Crump's Bottom). The old Washington Co., N. Car.' occupied the eastern part of Tenn. in 1787. When the State of Tenn. was formed in 1796 that portion of N. Car. in which Samuel hved was included in Tenn. Old Washington Co., N. Car. was formed in 1777 from Orange Co., N. C. Samuel Culbertson, Sr., of Washington Co., Tenn., made his will in Dec, 1798, and will was probated in Feb. 1799. Lived on Indian Creek (now Unicoi Co., Tenn.). Devisees were wife, Jean; children: Andrew, Josiah, Sam- uel, Joseph, James and Mary (Weakfield). The witnesses to Samuel's will were James Deakens, John Young and Hol- land Higgins. Will proven at Feb. Session of Court (1799). Executors D. McCray and Robert Lowe. Wife Jane and Ex'rs. deeded some land of the est. Apr. 7, 1807, to Jos. Barnes; also 117 acres to Jos. Barnes, Jan. 10, 1807. Sam- uel received warrants of N. Car. land (Washington Co.) 900 acres in 1782. This included his original location in Wash. Co., N. C. ; July 7, 1794, 400 acres on Indian Creek. Also grant July 12, 1794. His son Joseph rec'd a warrant for 120 acres on Indian Creek, Wash. Co., N. Car. July 12, 1794. Warrant states this land adjoins Samuel Culbert- son's land. Joseph made entry of one 400 acre tract. Jos. also conveyed to Barnes. Samuel's home farm has passed through many hands and a part of it is now owned by the U. S. Fishery. I neglected to state that Thwaite's \"Dun- mores War\" (1774) speaks of Ft. Culbertson \"in Culbert- son's Bottom.\" near Hinton, W. Va. and that troops march- ing to Point Pleasant, Va., stopped there. The last name of Samuel's second wife is not known, nor is that of his first wife. Someone had a record which claim- ed that Mary Duncan was the wife of Irish Samuel the third Pa. Row brother. This was an error. It is possible that Samuel of Wash. Co., N. Car., married a Mary Duncan for his first wife. The children are given as in will. Children are not i^lways given in will as per order of birth and I am positive that Samuel did not give his children in order of their birth. A lady in Texas some twenty years ago sent me a typewritten mss. taken from a newspaper printed in Daviess Co., Ind. in 1839 giving the obituary of Josiah and it said he was born in 1742 in Lancaster Co., Pa. Therefore I am going to give 48 GENEALOGY OF Samuel's children in different order from what they are given in his will. FOURTH GENERATION Issue : a. 1. James, b. 1740?; d. . Chatham Co., N. Car.

In Oct., 1782, he took out a Warrant No. 340, for 300 acres of land on both sides of Hico Creek in Caswell Co., N. C. (Caswell formed from Orange Co. in 1777). In de- scription of meets and bounds in latter warrant James, it says \"Beginning at a large pine corner of his deeded line and running along said hne.\" This refers to his warrant of 1761. Part of the lands he owned were in Chatham Co. ind close to Pearson Co. hne. It is possible that James swore he was of age in 1761 when he may have been only 17 or 18 years old. (As I have known of one instance in Pa.) James Culbertson of Orange Co., N. C. and Caswell and Chatham Co., N. C, besides Hico Creek farm owned 350 acres on Fall Creek, Chatham Co., N. C. This was deadad Nov. 19, 1824 by Josiah Culbertson acting by Power of Atty. then residing (Josiah) in Warren Co., Tenn. He deeded two-thirds interest of this 350 acres on Fall Creek, Chatham Co. to James Culbertson of Montgomery Co., N. Car. Josiah was attorney for William, Joseph, Lawrence, Andrew, Aaron and Jonathan Culbertson, all of Warren Co., Tenn., and heirs to James Culbertson of Chatham Co., THE CULBERTSON FAMILY 49 deceased.

The mss, of newspaper article printed in 1839 in Daviess Co., Ind., I have lost, unfortunately. The history of Josiah reads like a romance. Told of his wonderful feats of strength, his fights with Indians and the British, also of the great bravery of his wife in encounters with the Indians, and how she carried powder to her husband when he was beseiged by Indians, and how the Indians once cut off one of her children's hands. He married a daughter of Col. John Thomas in whose regiment he served. Pension Records at Washington , D. C, give his service. \"Served in John Thomas' Reg't., S. Car. for two years. Was in engagements Ramsours Mills, Cowpens and King Mt.\" Also \"Private in N. Car. troops, pensioned $80 a year. Pension commenced Mar. 4, 1831.\" Commissioner U. S. Land Office says no land mihtary warrant to him. Residence Daviess Co., Ind.\" Census 1790 S. Car. gives him in 96th Dist., Spartansburg 50 GENEALOGY OF Co., self and wife, four sons under 16 years, four daughters. (Numbers 14 to 22). Col. John Thomas and his sons, John and Wm. D. Thom- as, are given in 1790 Census of S. Car. in Greenville Co. This county adjoins Spartansburg Co. In Josiah Culbertson's biography (as given in Kings Mt. and Its Heroes, by Lyman Draper) he says: \"His father set- tled at Nev/ River on the frontier of Va., thirty miles from any white settlement when Josiah was about 10 years old. Was living there in 1755-6 His father shortly after moved back to the Greenbrier River Settlements.\" He also says, \"That he did not know Col. Isaac Shelby until he left N. Car. in the latter part of 1779.' I will digress here to quote from War, Dept. Reports, Vol. II, p. 11 ; Barrie's Army and Navy of the U. S.; Dunmore's War by Thwaites, etc. ; \"Isaac Shelby was a surveyor in the Western Virginia where he located in 1771 near Bristol, Tenn. In 1774 was a Lt. and in his father's company Va. troops in Dunmore's War. His bravery at Point Pleasant saved the day. Commissary- Gen. (Capt.) of Va. troops 1776; Col. in 1779. Was elected to Va. House of Delegates but after this date (1779) the line between Va. and N. Car. was extended and the survey threw Shelby into N. Car. He was then (1779) commis- sioned Col. of a Batt'n of Militia of Sullivan Co., N. Car. This was the time he first met Josiah Culbertson and they became fast friends. In 1776 east Tenn. belonged to N. Car. and v/as called Washington County. In 1784 this was called the Territory of Franklin and a governor was elected until Tenn. became a state. This data sustains Johnston's New- River Settlements in statement that \"Part of eastern Tenn. belonged to Va. before it belonged to N. Car.\" After Samuel Culbertson left Greenbrier Settlement, Va., he moved to western N. Car. Josiah served with N. Car. troops. Have not been able to get the regiment in which Josiah served in N. Car. Gen. John Sevier, of Tenn., lived only five to ten miles from Josiah Culbertson and his father Samuel. He lived at Wataugua Settlement and it is highly probable that they were personal friends of the Immortal John Sevier. Barrie's Army and Navy of the U. S., Vol. VII, p. 26, says: \"Forces from Sulhvan Co., N. Car., at Battle of Kings Mountain under Col. Isaac Shelby of Tenn.\" Josiah says in his biography : \"Removed to N. Car. before 1770, with my father, Samuel. That I (Josiah) was in THE CULBERTSON FAMILY 51 Gov. Geo. Tryon's Army in 1770, when he defeated the 'in- surgents'; afterwards (after 1779) removed to S. Car. Was married in 1774.\" Josiah's eldest son was Andrew. He witnessed a deed for his father in Spartansburg Co., S. C, Jan. 7, 1797. Josiah's wife does not participate with him in deed in S. Car. in Jan. 7, 1797 (other Culbertsons in same state at that date in making deeds the wife participates). She, no doubt was dead at that time ; Hkewase family tradition says she was buried on Fair Forest Creek in S. Car- ; also Josiah left the state in 1797. In his pension application he says: \"I was born in 'Cul- bertson Row', Pa., near Shippensburg, Pa., in 1742, My father moved to New River, Va. in 1753.\" \"EnHsted in N. Car. Flying Camp, 1776. At Siege of Savannah, Kings Mt., Ninety-Six, Musgrove's, Cedar Springs, Cowpens, etc.\" (See Dr. Lyman Draper's Kings Mt. and Its Heroes. Also Summer's S. West Va.) Dr. Lyman Draper's \"Kings Mt. and Its Heroes,\" gives some interesting reminiscenes of Josiah Culbertson, a mem- ber of Col. Shelby's Regt. (from N. Car.). In 1892 a gentle- man by the name of Scott said that his father served in the same company with Josiah Culbertson and that he often re- lated to him the bravery and heroic deeds of Culbertson during the Revolution. Col. Shelby led the charge at Kings Mt. Court records of Daviess Co., Ind., show a son of Josiah died in that county in 1862. Court records Daviess Co., Ind., show no will or settlement Josiah, Sr. No other issue given. There was one other son who ran away and whereabouts unknown, until the author received a letter from a descendant in Tennessee. He was William Davies Thomas Culbertson, named after his uncle, who moved with his father from N. Car. to S. CaroHna, then in 1797 to War- ren County, Tennessee, and after 1824 moved to Daviess County, Indiana. 1815 took out warrants for 1130 acres in Greenville Co., S. Car. This son went from Indian- apolis, Ind., to N. Car. where he married Narcissa Wood about 1829, and later to Jonesboro, Ala., later to Winston Co., Miss., where he died 1863. His descendants have an old powder gourd used by Josiah in the Revolution and which had belonged to Irish Andrew and said to be 250 years old having been brought from Ireland. They also have a Bible printed in the Welsh language which belonged to Josiah's wife's father. Col. John Thomas, printed 1561. Wm. D. 52 GENEALOGY OF Thomas Culbertson was an educated man, a doctor and also a preacher in Miss. His daughter married a Mr. Suttles and their son is J. H. Suttles, a professor in a Memphis Business College. Homes' -\"History of the Presbyterian Church\" and John- son's \"Traditions of the Revolution\" speak highly of Col. John Thomas and his son John, afterwards Col., and son- in-law Josiah Culbertson, Sr. Sullivan and Washington Counties, N. Car. adjoin and went into Tenn. when that state was formed (Sullivan formed from Washington). Josiah Culbertson, Sr-, was probablv in Col. Isaac Shelby's Regt. before he went to S. Car. Went to S. Car. 1779. Left S. Car. 1797. CHAPTER VIII (a. 3) Joseph Culbertson remained with his father until 1802. He witnessed a deed for his father in 1779 and in 1787, residence Washington Co., N. Car. He took out a war- rant in Tenn. for 120 acres on Indian Creek, Washington Co., land adjoining his father's in 1794. Also 100 acres (1797) on north side of Flat Creek on Bald Mt. Road, Bun- combe Co., N. Car., near Tenn. land. I have not been able to ascertain whether he was married or single. The census 1790, 1800, 1810, for Tenn. was destroyed 1812 when the British sacked Washington. Jos"
