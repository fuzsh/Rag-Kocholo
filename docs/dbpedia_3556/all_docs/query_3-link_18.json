Always a Òwork-in-progressÓ for which I take no responsibility for errors, but I do the best research I can. FFA Chart #189 has been combined into FFA Chart #41. Although Otho and William Morgan French are not in my line, I will continue to do research on them as time permits. My line is FFA Chart #6. Because this line comes from Sherborne, Dorset, England, and FFA Chart #11 is from an area nearby Sherborne (with the same names Jeremiah and Samuel), I was very careful not to include the Jeremiah or Samuel from that line in this FFA Chart #41. The DNA on these two lines is entirely different.\n\nCaution\n\nResearch shows that in all probability, this family emigrated from Dorset, England, but a 100% confirmation has not yet been found as an immigration record cannot be found. Otho French must have immigrated to America between 1720 and 1728; his parents did not immigrate as they died in England, and his first child was born in Maryland in 1729. Analysis of this emigration:\n\náThe Christian names of the generation immediately before emigration from Sherborne, Dorset, England, match almost precisely with the names of the next generation who were the first immigrants in Maryland, and almost in the same order depending on, of course, if they were sons or daughters. In other words, Otho who was born in England named his children in Maryland after his family abroad. As no immigration record could be found for Otho, these names and their dates of birth may be the only proof that the family came from Sherborne.\n\náThe names ÒSamuelÓ (OthoÕs father), ÒAnnÓ (OthoÕs mother), and ÒOthoÓ (himself), all born in England, are the names of OthoÕs first 3 children in Maryland.\n\náThe name Benjamin is the first named son both in Maryland and in England after the parents names Samuel and Otho.\n\náThe name ÒOthoÓ cannot be found elsewhere in England (only in Dorset) using ancestry.com or familysearch.org. This includes only the name ÒOthoÓ and not ÒOttoÓ or ÒOrthoÓ.\n\náOtho and all his siblings were born in Sherborne, Dorset, England. Otho probably immigrated while fairly young, but immigration records have not been found.\n\náThe nearby French family in Halstock, Dorset, England, have different Christian names, i.e., Lydia, Gulielmi, Egidius, Phyllis, Johannes, Visilla, Philip, Edith, Julian, John, and Henrici, all of which are entirely different than the Otho French family.\n\náThe nearby French family in Haydon, Dorset, England have some of the same Christian names, i.e., Otho, Iddeth, John, Thomas, Elizabeth, William, and Roger. The Otho mentioned here was christened 7 August 1633, the son of William, who also had daughter Iddeth (Edith?).\n\náHaydon is 2 miles SE of Sherborne. Folke is 3.5 miles also SE of Sherborne.\n\náWhen researching the surname French in England, best to also try the spelling ffrench, as that is how the capital ÒFÓ was handwritten, looking more like two lowercase fÕs in a row. You will see this spelling in following documents.\n\nLineage Outline\n\nOutline of the Entire Family in short form. The detailed version appears below. The outline acts as an index to find your ancestor by number and is very helpful.\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1.1* William French, Sr., b. ca. 1609?, m. Pretesa Browne on 22 Jul 1627 in Haydon (near Sherborne), Dorset, England, no further information except from his children below who state that their father was William. No early Browne family in Dorset.\n\nSecond Generation\n\nChildren of William French, Sr. and Pretesa Brown, 1.1\n\n2.1* William French, Jr., b. ca. 1629, m. Elizabeth who was from nearby Folke, Dorset, England. No further information except from their children below. No parents stated. Lived in Folke, Dorset, England after married, perhaps because Elizabeth was from Folke. Many women named Elizabeth, born ca. 1638, lived in Folke with the surnames Hobdich/Hebditch, Perse/Pearse, Pymm, Swetman, Syneor/Synder, Cuffe, and Fitz/Fitzsymmons.\n\n2.2 Edith (Iddeth) French, baptized 12 May 1630 in Haydon, Dorset, England, the daughter of William French.\n\n2.3* Otho French, baptized 7 Aug 1633 in Haydon, Dorset, England, the son of William French. He m. Agnes ca. 1674 as their children were born 1675 and afterwards. His wife, Agnes, died 7 Sep 1683 in Sherborne, as the wife of Otho. Otho d. 11 Mar 1699 in Sherborne, Dorset, England, as a widower.\n\nAgnes may have had one of these surnames:\n\nAgnes Barnard, baptized 6 Jan 1632, dau. of Johan, in Sherborne.\n\nAgnes Brook, baptized 23 Feb 1637, dau. of Richardi and Editha, in Sherborne.\n\nAgnes Durnford, baptized 29 Sep 1641, dau. of Henry, in Sherborne.\n\nAgnes Easton, baptized 25 Jun 1637, dau. of Robt. And Alicia, in Sherborne.\n\nAgnes Master, baptized 20 Oct 1639, dau. of Gulielmi and Jane, in Sherborne.\n\nAgnis Ashford, baptized 20 Aug 1637, dau. of Nicholas and Angetis, in Sherborne.\n\nAgnes Lamberts, baptized 29 Apr 1632, dau. of Johannes, in Sherborne.\n\nAgnes Pitman, baptized Mar 1632, dau. of Gulielmus, in Sherborne.\n\nAganes Sper, baptized 13 Apr 1639, dau. of Anthony and Ruth, in Sherborne.\n\n2.4* Roger French, b. ca. 1640, m. Elizabeth Granger in 1672 in Haydon, Dorset, England. Her father was Christopher Granger. No document as to who his father was. ÒAnÓ Elizabeth French d. 17 Mar 1734 in Haydon and was buried at St. CatherineÕs Anglican Church Cemetery (may not be same person as RogerÕs wife).\n\nThird Generation\n\nChildren of William French Jr. and Elizabeth, 2.1\n\n3.1 John French, b. 9 Apr 1657 in Folke (near Sherborne), Dorset, England, son of Wm & Elizabeth.\n\n3.2 Luce French, b. 1660 in Folke, Dorset, England, dau. of Wm & Elizabeth.\n\nChildren of Otho French and Agnes, 2.2\n\n3.3 Agnes French, daughter of Otho. Her mother Agnes died in 1683. Agnes the daughter died 29 May 1695 in Sherborne.\n\n3.4 John French, baptized 29 Nov 1676 in Sherborne, Dorset, England, the son of ÒOther and AgnisÓ, which should read Otho and Agnes. His mother died in 1683 [36], his father Otho d. 1699 in Sherborne.\n\n3.5* Samuel French, b. ca. 1675, of Sherborne, Dorset, England, parents are not mentioned. Samuel m1. Martha Balster (probably Bolster) on 20 May 1700 in Folke, Folke, Dorset, England. ÒAÓ Sarah Bolster was baptized 29 Apr 1685 in Folke, Dorset, England, the dau. of John Bolster and Martha Wood who were married 6 Oct 1674 in Folke, Dorset, England. Martha Bolster, the mother, was buried on 14 Mar 1691 in Folke, Dorset, England. Martha Bolster, the daughter, may have been born ca. 1680; likewise Samuel may have been born 1675. The Bolster family moved to Sherborne ca. 1778.\n\nShe died after having their son, Samuel, who was christened 25 Feb 1700 (1701) in Sherbourne, Dorset, England. Martha died 15 May 1702 in Sherbourne, as the wife of Samuel. Then Samuel remarried and named a daughter Martha (named after his first wife). Samuel was buried 20 Aug 1756 in Sherborne.\n\nSamuel was a widower when he married Ann Masters of East Coker, Somerset, England (which is about 5 miles SW of Sherborne) on 18 May 1703 in Sherborne, Dorset, England, exactly a year after his first wife, Martha, had died. Ann Masters died 23 Apr 1741 in Sherborne, Dorset, England. Her burial record states she was still married to Samuel and was not a widow. Ann gave birth to her last child, a son, on 2 Nov 1725 in Sherborne. Samuel was buried 20 Aug 1756 in Sherborne. The fact that both Samuel and Ann remained in England proves that they did not immigrate to Maryland as their son Otho did.\n\nFrom Dorset, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, Sherborne, 1538-1812. Here it states that Samuel was a widower of the Sherborne Parish, and that he married Ann Masters (the Old English ÒsÓ looks more like modern day ÒfÓ).\n\nSamuel was buried on 20 Aug 1756 in Sherbourne. No further information is given on the original record whereas all other records identify the person as Òson ofÓ or ÒwidowerÓ, etc., therefore he was probably an elderly man.\n\nChildren of Roger French and Elizabeth Granger, 2.4\n\n3.6* Jeremiah French, Sr., 18 Jun 1681 in Yetminster (near Sherborne), Dorset, England, states his father was Roger French. Jeremiah m. Elizabeth Chaffey in 1710 in Sherborne. Elizabeth Chaffey was baptized on 27 Feb 1694 in Sherborne, the daughter of Walter and Ann Chaffey. Walter Chaffey died in 1740 in Sherborne. The Chaffey family was extensive in Sherborne. Their children Mary, Jeremiah, Elizabeth, Samuel, and Barter all died young. Mary II died a spinster. John Òmay haveÓ moved to West Parley but records arenÕt clear.\n\nJeremiah French married Elizabeth Chaffey on 24 Dec 1710 in Sherborne.\n\nJeremiah was buried on 22 Feb 1749 at the Workhouse in Sherborne. The workhouse was a place where those unable to support themselves were offered accommodation and employment. The Abbey Priory in Sherborne served as a workhouse between 1737 and 1749.\n\nMost probably Jeremiah was unable to care for himself, and lived in a home ÒworkhouseÓ that took care of him until he died on 22 Feb 1749 in Sherborne; he would have been about 70 years old; no details given, except he was not young or the burial record would have said Òson ofÓ. Jeremiah and Otho French lived in Sherborne at the same time and were of the same generation.\n\nFourth Generation\n\nChildren of Samuel French and Martha, 3.5\n\n4.1 Samuel French, christened 25 Feb 1700 in Sherbourne, Dorset, England, was buried on 27 Jun 1701 in Sherborne.\n\nSamuel, son of Samuel and Martha, was buried on 27 Jun 1701 in Sherborne.\n\nSamuelÕs mother, Martha, was buried 15 May 1702 in Sherbourne, as the wife of Samuel. Samuel (his father) then married Ann Masters and named one of his daughters Martha.\n\nChildren of Samuel French and Ann Masters, 3.5\n\n4.2 Agnes French, christened 20 Jun 1704 in Sherbourne, Dorset, England, the daughter of Samuel French and Ann. Agnes was buried 23 Aug 1734 in Sherbourne as the daughter of Samuel and Ann; she was 30 years old and probably never immigrated to Maryland, nor did she marry.\n\nFrom Dorset, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, Sherborne, 1730-1739.\n\n4.3* Otho French, christened 15 Jan 1705 in Sherborne, Dorset, England, the son of Samuel and Ann French. The names ÒSamuelÓ, ÒAnnÓ, and ÒOthoÓ are the names of OthoÕs first 3 children. Because his mother died in Sherborne, it is obvious that Otho was the first emigrant of this family to Maryland. From Dorset, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, Sherborne, 1730-1739. Otho must have immigrated shortly before he married Emma Dowlin (or Jamemma Dowling) on 30 Jul 1727 in All Hallows Church, Westminster Parish, Anne Arundel, MD, and before their first son Samuel French was born on 11 Dec 1729 at Hallows Parish, Anne Arundel Co., MD. If he immigrated in 1726, he would have been about 20 years old.\n\nLater baptized on 12 Jan 1707 in Anne Arundel County, MD, d. ca. 8 May 1880 in Anne Arundel, MD, he m. Emma Dowlin (or Jamemma Dowling) on 30 Jul 1727 in All Hallows Church, Westminster Parish, Anne Arundel, MD, an Anglican church (the Church of England). There is no mention of an earlier French in Anne Arundel Co., MD, before Otho French. Note that Otho in Maryland named his first children Samuel and Ann after his parents.\n\nEmma Dowlin was b. 10 Nov 1709 [8], d. 5 Apr 1780. In 1776 at age 69, Otho lived in All Hallows Parish, Anne Arundel Co., MD, according to the Maryland Census, 1772-1890. For early details on Otho French (1707-1793), see ÒFrom Prairie to PalestineÓ. Marriage records listed below:\n\nBelow: Register of MarylandÕs Heraldic Families, p. 222\n\nAll Hallows Church\n\nAll Hallows Church, also known as The Brick Church, is a historic church located at 3604 Solomon's Island Road, in Edgewater (or Harwood), Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. Parish records date back to 1682, indicating that it existed prior to the Act of Establishment (1692) passed by the General Assembly of Maryland laying off the Province into 30 Anglican parishes.\n\nThe following is a brief history of All Hallows Parish. A fuller history of All Hallows, compiled and written by Parish member, Gail Enright, is available through the Parish Office.\n\nThe Brick Church: In October of 1729, the General Assembly of Maryland assessed a tax of 20,000 pounds of tobacco to build \"The Brick Church.\" The building's Interior was altered extensively during the 19th century according to needs and tastes of the time. A fire in 1940, left only the walls standing, but the subsequent rebuilding efforts restored The Brick Church to its original Georgian style.\n\nAll HallowÕs Parish, South River, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, established in 1692, construction completed in 1756, is one of the original 30 Anglican parishes (Church of England) in the Province of Maryland. The interior was gutted by fire in 1727. It was modernized in 1825 and again in 1885. After a fire in 1940, reconstruction restored the building to its 1710 appearance.\n\nThe continuous roofline around the vestibule indicates one of the differences between this church and the St. James Parish, plus the style of the windows is slightly different.\n\nAll Hallows Church, 3604 Solomons Island Rd., Harwood or Birdsville, MD (red circle); whereas, the St. James Church is at 5757 Solomons Island Rd., Lothian, MD, which is the city at the bottom of this map. No French is buried at this cemetery among the 397 interments.\n\nAll Hallows Church, July 2009 (below)\n\nSt. James Church\n\nThis plaque honoring Henry Hall (see Wikipedia) who was well-known to the French family were both of Anne Arundel County, MD. BenjaminÕs father, Otho French, mortgaged ÒWadeÕs IncreaseÓ to Henry Hall Sr. for 61 pounds and 18 shillings in 1754. The St. James Church was completed in 1765, completed 9 years after the All Hallows Church. There were 3 generations of men named Henry Hall. No French is buried at this cemetery, but 54 members of the Hall family, including Henry Hall (1676-1722), are buried here among the 1,164 interments. Henry Hall was born in Essex, England, not in the county of Dorset; therefore, the two families met in Maryland.\n\nSt. James Church is at 5757 Solomons Island Rd., Lothian, MD; whereas the All Hallows Church is at 3604 Solomons Island Rd., Harwood, MD, shown north of Lothian on the map below. The red circle shows Herring Bay.\n\nSt. James Parish Episcopal Church in 1936 (below).\n\nSt. James Parish Episcopal Church nowadays (below).\n\nChronology\n\n1705 Jan 15 – Otho French was christened 15 Jan 1705 in Sherborne, Dorset, England, the son of Samuel and Ann French.\n\n1707 Jan 12 – Otho FrenchÕs christening date as stated in Anne Arundel County, MD, after he immigrated.\n\n1709 Nov 10 – Emma Dowlin was born, the dau. of William Dowlin who was born ca. 1689.\n\n1720-1726 – As OthoÕs parents did not immigrate to Maryland, he probably immigrated during this time, but no records have been found. So far it appears as though heÕs the only sibling to immigrate. All others were buried in England.\n\n1727 Jul 30 – Otho married Emma Dowlin (or Jamemma Dowling) in All Hallows Church, Westminster Parish, Anne Arundel, MD, an Anglican church (the Church of England).\n\n1729-1749 – Otho and Emma had 10 children: Samuel, Otho Jr., Ann, Agnes, Benjamin, William, Martha, Israel, Emma, Joanna.\n\n1733 Sep 8 -- Thomas Rutland 12.25 A AA £441.19.1 £357.8.0 Sep 8 1733. Thomas Rutland d. 24 Dec 1731 in South River, Anne Arundel, MD.\n\nA second inventory is cited in the amount of £7.15.0. Received from: Humphry Meridith, John Jacob Clough, Stephen Steward, Otho French, William Witherly, John Lawson, Philip Hammond, Nicholas Watkins, Elisabeth Coyle, Abigail Hudson, Moses Adney, Thomas Hinton, William Tucker.\n\n1736 Mar 5 – Murdock Dowlin of Anne Arundel County died and was probably a relative of OthoÕs wife, Emma Dowlin.\n\n1741 May 12 – Otho, cordwainer (shoemaker), aged 33, made a written deposition to the Court attesting that he was a tenant on the plantation where Stephen Warman lived and that he knew him to be of sound mind at the time Stephen made his will and during his last days [27].\n\n1742 Jan 26 -- Deed of purchase of land in 1742 by Otho French from John Hopper of 100 acres of ÒWadeÕs IncreaseÓ which were 2 pieces of land, one was 75 acres and the other was 40 acres in Anne Arundel County, MD. It had been part of a grant to Robert Wade in 1678. On the property deeds, Otho was called a Òplanter,Ó the common term for holders of large acreage. See below Deed of Purchase.\n\n1754 – Otho mortgaged ÒWadeÕs IncreaseÓ to Henry Hall for 61 pounds and 18 shillings [27]. Henry Hall Sr. was b. May 1695 in Charles, Washington, MD, and d. 9 Dec 1773 in Frederick, Frederick, MD. Both the French and Hall families a couple generations later moved to Ohio living nearby each other; in fact, William Hall lived with Otho French (of another generation), as WilliamÕs father, Henry Hall Jr., had died.\n\n1765 – Otho mortgaged ÒWadeÕs IncreaseÓ to Nicholas Maccubbin for 90 pounds, 12 shillings. The Maccubbin family has 2 gravestones at the All Hallows Church Cemetery. No French gravestone exists.\n\n1773 Jan 1 – From the Maryland Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\n1776 – At age 69, Otho lived in All Hallows Parish, Anne Arundel Co., MD, according to the Maryland Census, 1772-1890. His household consisted of 2 white males and 1 white woman. Presumably, the two males were Otho and one of his sons, and the woman was his wife, Emma. The census also showed William French in All HallowÕs Parish, presumably OthoÕs son living separately and not yet married, as well as son Benjamin French in St. James Parish.\n\n1776 Nov 25 – Otho transferred the deed ÒWadeÕs IncreaseÓ to his son, William.\n\n1778 Sep – Otho repaid the sum of 112 pounds, 16 shillings and 5 pence to Nicholas Maccubbin and the mortgage was released.\n\n1780 May 8 – Otho died previously to this date. An inventory dated 1780 found in Anne Arundel County records, reads:\n\nAn inventory of goods and chattels of Otho French, late of Anne Arundel County, deceased, appraised in current money of this province, by us the subscribers (being thereto lawfully authorized and sworn) this eighth day of May Anno Domini One Thousand Seven Hundred Eighty (1780).\n\nFollowing is a list of household goods, tools, feather beds, furniture, and twenty-seven pounds of pewter, two yearlings, etc. are the signatures of the appraisers, Joseph Howard and Thomas Henry Hall; and in closing was written: July 29, 1780 came William French, son of Otho French and made oath to the truth of the within inventory.\n\n1780 Apr 5 – Emma Dowlin French died. In her will dated 1780, she left Òwhatever she had to son, William, daughter Ann, and daughter Joanna.Ó Apparently Otho predeceased her [27].\n\n1780 Jul 29 – OthoÕs son William made oath to the truth of the within inventory of his father [27]. Both Otho and his wife, Emma, died in 1780 and their son, William and his family, remained in Anne Arundel County. OthoÕs son Israel moved to Frederick County, and son Otho Jr. moved to Baltimore County. IsraelÕs son, Otho, moved to Ohio in 1799 and had son Otho in 1814 at the old home place on Tacoma, two miles east of Barnesville.\n\n1793 –An accounts testament list was drawn up 13 years after OthoÕs death, made by his son, William, listed the assets of Otho French. It gave a final statement of money for the accountants and showed disbursement of funeral expenses [27].\n\nDeed of Purchase in 1742\n\nDeed of purchase of land in 1742 by Otho French from John Hopper of 100 acres of ÒWadeÕs IncreaseÓ which were 2 pieces of land, one was 75 acres and the other was 40 acres.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=NDcIVQ1dHAwC&pg=PA392&lpg=PA392&dq=%22Wade's+Increase%22&source=bl&ots=6FIZg4VkED&sig=jqP0E2YKo-C9Mn-mOCegbpl-rCI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=AvQtU6e5JsaCogT_lYLgAw&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nDaniel Chester French was not related to the Otho French family as he was a descendant of Edward French, FFA Chart #4. The Jacob French of 1752 is probably FFA Chart #195.\n\n4.4 Ann French, christened 30 Jan 1707 in Sherbourne, Dorset, England, the daughter of Samuel French and Ann. She was buried at age 2 on 11 Apr 1709 in Sherbourne, and her parents used this name for a second daughter.\n\n4.5 Martha French, christened 13 Feb 1709 in Sherbourne, Dorset, England, the daughter of Samuel French and Ann. No other records can be found for Martha.\n\n4.6 Joanna French, christened 17 Jun 1712 in Sherbourne, Dorset, England, the daughter of Samuel French and Ann. Joanna m. Thomas Sansom on 5 Feb 1735 in Sherborne.\n\nThomas Sansom christened 19 Mar 1705, the son of William and Ann Sansom.\n\nThomas Sansom m1. Edith Goulding on 7 Jun 1729 in Sherborne.\n\nEdith Sansom was buried 27 Dec 1735, the wife of Thomas Sansom.\n\nThomas Sansom m2. Joanna French on 5 Feb 1735 in Sherborne. Consider old calendar where Jan., Feb., Mar. were part of the earlier year and the new year began Apr 1; therefore this date was probably 5 Feb 1736 in todayÕs calendar.\n\nThomas Sansom registered for duties as a master of carpentry for John Stacy who paid for apprenticesÕ indentures in Sherborne on 5 Aug 1737.\n\nThomas Sansom was buried 9 Feb 1743 in Sherborne.\n\nJoanna Sansom was buried 2 Jun 1760 in Sherborne, a widow. The purpose of this research is to prove that Otho French and his siblings were born in Sherborne and not all of this family immigrated to Maryland.\n\nÒOtherÓ men named Thomas Sansom in Sherborne have these records:\n\nThomas Sansom m. Susan Allin on 14 Oct 1616 in Sherborne.\n\nThomas Sansom m. Marie Fisher in Apr 1654 in Sherborne.\n\nThomas Sansom was buried 15 Aug 1677 in Sherborne.\n\nThomas Sansom was christened 6 Apr 1719 in Sherborne, parents unknown; he was probably an adult.\n\nElizabeth Sansom was buried 17 Sep 1733 in Sherborne, the wife of Thomas Sansom.\n\nThomas Sansom m. Margaret Bowditch on 22 Oct 1734 in Sherborne and had son William christened 23 Oct 1735.\n\nThomas Sansom m. Mary Parker on 15 Nov 1736 in Sherborne.\n\n4.7 Benjamin French, christened 2 Jul 1714 in Sherbourne, Dorset, England, the son of Samuel French and Ann. From Dorset, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, Sherborne, 1730-1739.\n\nBenjamin was buried 28 Feb 1765 in Sherborne. IÕm not sure what it says below his name. No other records can be found for a Benjamin in Sherborne. The reason this name was researched further was because BenjaminÕs brother, Otho, who immigrated to Maryland, named one of his sons Benjamin, who was b. 20 Nov 1738.\n\n4.8 Anne French, christened 8 Oct 1717 in Sherbourne, Dorset, England, the daughter of Samuel French and Ann. No other records can be found for Anne.\n\n4.9 Sarah French, was buried 19 Jul 1723 in Sherborne, the daughter of Samuel and Anne French.\n\n4.10 male French, was buried 2 Nov 1725 in Sherborne, the son of Samuel French.\n\nChildren of Jeremiah French Sr. and Elizabeth Chaffey, 3.6\n\nJeremiah French and Elizabeth Chaffey married 24 Dec 1710 in Sherbourne; neither immigrated to America.\n\n4.11 Mary French, baptized 23 Aug 1711 in Sherborne, probably died young as another daughter was then named Mary.\n\n4.12 Jeremiah French, Jr., baptized 5 Aug 1713 in Sherborne, son of Jeremiah French and Elizabeth had son Moses in 1735 in Sussex, Sussex, NJ, and he had a son Jeremiah, b. 1759 in NJ who eventually moved to PA. See FFA Chart #22. No verification on these descendants, but analysis is included below.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nStart of Proposed Descendants of Jeremiah if he indeed immigrated to New Jersey\n\nIt was JeremiahÕs cousin, Otho born 1705 in Sherborne, who immigrated to Maryland first from this line. Therefore, it is quite possible that both these men from the fourth generation immigrated about the same time. The descendants of Jeremiah Jr. (4.2) of FFA Chart #179 and his cousin Otho (4.11) of FFA Chart #41 have the same DNA test results in DNA Test Group 1. The name Moses must have come from someone in the U.S. Let us suppose that Jeremiah married and his wifeÕs fatherÕs name was Moses, so he would have been born ca. 1685.\n\nOtho is first noted in Maryland on 1727 Jul 30 when he married Emma Dowlin (or Jamemma Dowling) in All Hallows Church, Westminster Parish, Anne Arundel, MD, an Anglican church (the Church of England). He was age 22. He names his children the same names as his siblings.\n\nIn 1727 when Otho appears in Maryland, Jeremiah would have been age 17, and he and Otho could have traveled together, or about the same time, but Jeremiah went to NJ and Otho went to MD.\n\nCould there have been another generation born between the Jeremiah born in 1713 and the Jeremiah born in New Jersey in 1759? That is 46 years, quite old to have a child. There could have been another generation in between, say born halfway between those dates ca. 1735, and yes, that is Moses, born 1735.\n\nJeremiah French is listed in the 1790 census of Northumberland, PA, where his father Moses lived, plus Jeremiah named a son Moses.\n\n2 males under 16, Moses, b. 1783 and William b. 3 Jun 1790 in Northumberland.\n\n1 male over 16, Jeremiah, born before 1774, who was probably the one born in 1759 in NJ.\n\n2 females, wife Margaret, b. 1765, and dau. Sarah, b. 1786.\n\nJeremiahÕs children were Moses, b. 1783; dau. b. 1786; William, b. 1790; Jeremiah Jr., b. 1791, and dau. b. 1793. The rest of his line is detailed in FFA Chart #179.\n\nThe name ÒMosesÓ is a big clue, as there was a Moses French born 1735 in Sussex, Sussex, NJ, who d. 28 May 1797. No one has come up with the name of his father, but it could very well have been Jeremiah from Sherborne, Dorset, England, as they were both in NJ at the same time. The Moses who was born in 1735 married Rebecca Congleton and had son John Congleton French in 1766 and Aaron French in 1767 and she could have also had Jeremiah French in 1759. DNA from descendants of Moses and Aaron show that they are also part of DNA Test Group 1. Aaron French is in the 1790 census of Washington County, PA, showing that he, too, moved from NJ to PA. See Aaron French FFA Chart #21, and Moses French FFA Chart #22. Furthermore, note that one of the descendants of Moses was Jeremiah French, b. 16 Jan 1837 in Sheshequin, Bradford County, PA. The father of this Jeremiah was Walter, his grandfather was Aaron, and his great-grandfather was Moses.\n\nFrom ÒJourney to Day Before YesterdayÓ by Rhoda English Ladd: In Northumberland County in Pennsylvania, off the main road, Route 249 between Keeneyville and Little Marsh, is a road that winds up around the hills into an area well known as French Hill. To the north is Farmington Township and to the west, Chatham Township. French Hill was named for the French family. There was French Hill School and French Hill Cemetery. In 1919 a series of stories was written by one calling himself Òold Chathamer.Ó This early history is important because several persons are collecting data on this pioneer family. French Hill was first settled by Moses French in 1833. In 1834 his brother, William, came. Both were sons of Jeremiah French, a Revolutionary War soldier. This family moved from Northumberland County up the Susquehanna River to Bradford County, and later settled on the Chemung River near Elmira, where William French was born, June 3, 1790. These pioneers erected log houses, cleared the land, and made homes for themselves that were quite comfortable. In addition to farming, Moses French raised honey. He had two sons, Moses, Jr. and William. He also had daughters. His farm was located just below the school house (see Middlebury Township in the 1874 atlas). The farm in 1919 was owned by N.T.

Needed is burial place of Jeremiah French, his wifeÕs name, and a complete list of their children.\n\nJeremiahÕs proposed cousin, Otho, immigrated to America, and it is very likely that Jeremiah did also, as ÒaÓ Jeremiah French appears in NJ at the same time, plus the descendants of both Otho and Jeremiah in America have the same DNA test results in DNA Test Group 1. The name Moses must have come from someone in the U.S. Let us suppose that Jeremiah married and his wifeÕs fatherÕs name was Moses, so he would have been born ca. 1685.\n\n5.x Moses French, b. 1735 in Sussex, Sussex, NJ, m.

Jul 1724 in Sherborne.\n\n4.19 Deborah French, b. 22 Jun 1727 in Sherborne, the daughter of Jeremiah French and Elizabeth. She married Thomas Chant on 25 Dec 1760 in Sherborne, witnesses William Whitehead and John Simonds by bands. John Simonds also witnessed the marriages of William French of Poole, Dorset, England, and Ann Moor. This shows the connection of the village of Poole (very near Sherborne) to the French family. Daughter Mary was a baseborn daughter baptized on 9 Aug 1771; no other children are listed. Thomas Chant was buried 24 Aug 1777 in Sherborne. The Chant family was extensive in Sherborne.\n\nFifth Generation\n\nChildren of Otho French Sr. and Emma Dowlin, 4.3\n\nOtho named his children after his parents, siblings and after himself and his wife, the exact same names as those from England.\n\n5.1 Samuel French, b. 11 Dec 1729 at Hallows Parish, Anne Arundel Co., MD. He could have been the Samuel French who bought 50 acres of land in Kent County, MD, in 1752. No further records have been found.\n\n5.2 Otho French, b. 24 Nov 1731. He enrolled in the Revolutionary War militia under Benjamin Ramsey, Captain on 16 Sep 1775 [27].\n\nFor details on Otho French Jr., see ÒFrom Prairie to PalestineÓ, p. 396.\n\nChronology\n\n1731 Nov 24 – Otho Jr. was born in Hallows Parish, Anne Arundel County, MD.\n\n1768 – Otho signed a petition to the Upper and Lower Houses of Assembly to change the County seat from Joppa to Baltimore, as Joppa was considered too small of a town. If he were Otho, Sr., he would have been 61 years old; if he were Otho Jr., he would have been 37 [27]. It is assumed this was Otho Jr. as he was living in Baltimore County, whereas his father was living in Anne Arundel County.\n\n1775 Sep 16 – Otho Jr., aged 44, enrolled in the Revolutionary War militia under Benjamin Ramsey, Captain [27].\n\n1790 census – Otho French Jr. appears in Patapsco Lower Hundred, Baltimore, Maryland. His father, Otho Sr., had died by 1780. This census indicates that Otho Jr. may have married.\n\n1 male, Otho Jr.\n\n2 females\n\n1 child\n\n1 slave.\n\n(Benjamin French, OthoÕs brother, appears in a separate residence with 2 males, 1 female, 3 children, and 4 slaves).\n\nInhabitants of Anne Arundel County, All Hallows Parish. The columns to the left are: white men, white females, white children, black men, black females, black children, total, as per Maryland Records, Colonial, Revolutionary, County and Church, by Galius Marcus Brumbaugh.\n\n1791 Oct 12 – Otho and Sarah French signed as witnesses for Robert Abercrombie in Baltimore County, MD. Sarah may have been the daughter of OthoÕs brother, Benjamin, with BenjaminÕs second wife, Mary Abercrombie. But Sarah was born in 1788 and would only have been 3 years old in 1791. More research is needed. It does say that Otho French with Sarah French as Òone of the witnessesÓ, not two.\n\n1800 census – Otho is not listed anywhere.\n\n5.3 Ann French, b. 21 Feb 1733 in Hallows Parish, Anne Arundel Co., MD, dau. of Otho and Emma. She is mentioned in her motherÕs will of 1780. She wrote her will in Anne Arundel, MD, in 1785. No further information found.\n\nFrom the Index of Wills of Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 1777-1917. (3 Frenches below are probably from the 4th or 5th generations)\n\n5.4 Agnes/Agness French, 20 Apr 1736 in Hallows Parish, Anne Arundel Co., MD, dau. of Otho and Emma. No further information found.\n\n5.5 Benjamin French, b. 20 Nov 1738 in Hallows Parish, Anne Arundel Co., MD, son of Otho and Emma. He m. Deborah Gist or Geist, and perhaps had a second marriage to Mary Abercrombie on 11 Nov 1784 in Baltimore, MD, plus they may have had daughter Sarah French who was b. 1788 and d. 1811. More research is needed.\n\nChronology\n\n1738 Nov 20 – Benjamin French was born in Hallows Parish, Anne Arundel Co., MD.\n\n1760 Aug 7 -- From the Maryland Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, 7 Aug 1760. Herring Bay is very close to Calvert County which is the county immediately south of Ann Arundel County. Herring-Bay is the location of St. James Parish.\n\n1763 Oct 13 -- From the Maryland Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, 13 Oct 1763. Even though this newspaper article seems similar to the one in 1760, the location is in Calvert County. There is ÒaÓ Benjamin French living in Calvert County in the 1800 census, but he is far too young to be the Benjamin born in 1738.\n\n1775 Jun 25 -- Benjamin m. Deborah Gist on 25 Jun 1775 in Anne Arundel County, MD, at the age of 37. The surname Gist appears in early Maryland records (Elizabeth, Rachel, John, Violetta, Ellen, Anne, Joseph, David, Jonathan, Joshua, Maria, Sarah, Susannah, and Thomas Gist were all born ca. 1750 in Baltimore, MD). No children of Benjamin were recorded between 1775-1785; only children of his brother William were recorded except for ÒAÓ Sarah French, b. 1778 in Anne Arundel, MD, m. James Rusk or John P. Bell, d. 1811.\n\nAs for the list of marriages in Maryland shown below, only Benjamin and Otho are part of the family of this document. The others are listed here to differentiate them as other lines and are further explained in the Bibliography, Ref. [32].The ÒAAÓ stands for Anne Arundel. This St. JamesÕ Parish is a historic church located on SolomonÕs Island Road in the hamlet of TracyÕs Landing in Anne Arundel County, established in 1692; a newer larger church was built and completed in 1765, before Benjamin was married, and continues to serve the congregation today. This church was combined with All Saints Church in Frederick County, Maryland, in 1768.\n\nCould Benjamin m2. Mary Abercrombie? Undocumented sources indicate Benjamin married Mary Abercrombie on 11 Nov 1784. More research is needed.\n\n1776 census -- The 1776 Maryland Colonial Census shows Benjamin listed with the St. James Parish in Anne Arundel Co., MD, with 1 white woman, 6 white boys, 1 white girl, 1 Negro man, and 1 Negro woman [27]. The 1776 census of St. James Parish lists only Bazel French (or Basel) and Benjamin French. ÒAÓ Basel Gist is listed in the 1830 census of District 5, Anne Arundel, MD, as a female, age 40-50, b. 1780-1790. ÒAÓ Basil Guest is listed in military service, 1812-1815.\n\nOtho French and William French appear at All Hallows Parish, also in Anne Arundel County, MD. If Benjamin married in 1775 at age 37 -- maybe these 7 children listed below were from and previous marriage or children from a previous marriage of Deborah Gist. If they had 7 children born before 1776, one could predict the first was born 1766 or before.\n\n1 white woman – BenjaminÕs wife\n\n6 boys, must be under 18 (b. after 1758).\n\n1 girl born under 18 (b. after 1758).\n\n1784 – Benjamin m2. Mary Abercrombie on 11 Nov 1784 in Baltimore, MD.\n\n1790 -- Benjamin French appears in a separate residence from Otho French, with 2 males, 1 female, 3 children, and 4 slaves. This census record has validity simply for the fact that Otho is also listed, and he was probably BenjaminÕs brother.\n\nBenjamin lived in the 1790 census in Patapsco Lower Hundred, Baltimore, MD.\n\n1 male under 16\n\n2 males over 16, Benjamin French, born before 1774\n\n3 females, wife Deborah\n\n4 slaves\n\n5.6* William French, Sr., b. 14 May 1741 or 24 May 1744 in Anne Arundel Co., MD, son of Otho and Emma, m. Susanna Morgan in Jan 1780, the year his father died. William and Susanna had 3 children: Nicholas, William, and Emma, all born at the Westminster Parish in Anne Arundel County, MD. His wifeÕs surname Morgan is a strong connection to William Morgan French and John Morgan French who used Morgan as a middle name. William d. ca. 1800 in Anne Arundel, MD.\n\nChronology\n\n1741 May 14 – William was born in Anne Arundel County, MD. Below: Register of MarylandÕs Heraldic Families, p. 222\n\n1776 Maryland Colonial Census -- William is listed in the All Hallows Parish in Anne Arundel Co., MD, with a white male, and with one taxable male [27].\n\nInhabitants of Anne Arundel County, All Hallows Parish.

Census taken at a time before William married and when his father Otho was still living.\n\n1778 Mar 1 -- William served in the Army and took the Oath of Allegiance before the Honorable Richard Harwood, Jr. on 1 Mar 1778 and was drafted in Oct 1780 to serve in the Army until 10 Dec 1780 [27], right after his father had died.\n\n1780 Jan – William married Susanna Morgan. She was born between 1756-1774 as per the 1800 census; more precisely, she was probably born between 1756-1762. ÒAÓ John Jacobs Morgan was born 9 Jan 1763 in Anne Arundel County, MD, the son of Richard and Susanah Morgan who are also probably the parents of WilliamÕs wife Susanna Morgan. The Morgan family was also of All Hallows Parish.\n\nPre-Feb 1780 – WilliamÕs father, Otho, died.\n\n1780 Feb 26 -- From the Maryland Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, 24 Mar 1780. WilliamÕs elder brothers are Otho Jr., and Benjamin.\n\n1780 – Both of WilliamÕs parents died during this year. He is mentioned in his motherÕs will of 1780, and he was probably the executor of his fatherÕs will and inventory, also in 1780, and again in 1793 when his fatherÕs inventory was retaken.\n\n1790 census – Only 12 men named William French lived in the entire 1790 census of the U.S. Only one lived in Maryland, and that was in Anne Arundel County, with 6 family members:\n\n2 males under 16, born 1774 or after, son Nicholas b. 1781, and son William Jr. b. 1783\n\n2 males over 16, born 1774 or before, William Sr. b. 1741, and perhaps a brother (only could have been Samuel)\n\n2 females, wife Susanna, and dau.

The Quaker faith strictly opposes war. Religion was a much larger part of life back then and to change faiths was a serious commitment [28].\n\n1776 -- Israel Sr.Õs only known encounter with the American Revolution was in 1776 when he was fined 2 pounds by a Maryland War Commission for not enrolling with the local militia to train for combat. He held fast to his new Quaker faith and joined the Quaker Friends Meeting House [28], which is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, 455 Quaker Hill Rd., Union Bridge, MD, which is now over the Frederick County line into Carroll County, MD.\n\n1785 Jan 7 – Margaret Grant French, IsraelÕs wife, died when her children were all relatively young: Ann (7 Mar 1772), Emma (6 Oct 1773), Joanna (29 Jun 1775), Otho (2 May 1777), Israel Jr. (21 Oct 1779).\n\n1790 – Israel was registered at the Pipe Creek Quaker Friends Meeting House.\n\n1790 census – Israel was living in Frederick County, MD. He was age 16+ and living with 2 females age 16+.\n\n1792 Aug 1 – Israel purchased 20 acres of land in Pipe Creek, Frederick County, MD, called ÒHickory Plains.Ó The land was originally surveyed in 1760. Like his father, Israel was a farmer, perhaps a tenant farmer, until he was able to buy his own land in 1792 [27].\n\n1800 census – Israel lived in District 1, Frederick County, OH\n\n1 male age 16-25, b. 1775-1784, Israel French, Jr., b. 21 Oct 1779\n\n1 male age 45+, born 1755 or earlier, Israel Sr.\n\n1 female age 10-15, b. 1785-1790,\n\n1820 census -- ThereÕs another Israel living in Mount Pleasant, Jefferson County, OH – this is the one born in 1779, Israel Jr.\n\n1820 census -- Israel lived in Mount Pleasant, Jefferson Co., OH\n\n1 male, age 10 and 16, b. 1804-1810, Israel French 3rd.\n\n1 male, age 45 years old or over, b. 1775 or before, Israel Sr.\n\n1 female under 10, b. 1810-1820, Julia\n\n1 female between 10 and 16, b. 1804-1810, Zeruah\n\n1 female, age 45 years old or over, born 1775 or before, Deborah\n\nThe French household was the only one on its census page that owned a slave: one girl under 14. As Ohio was a free state, it is unknown how this could have been the case. Perhaps the family had a servant girl living with them that the census taker put down as a slave [27]. It listed Israel as a ÒmanufacturerÓ for his occupation. Along with occasional land dealings, he was also known as a teacher throughout the region. An interesting note in the census indicated that there was a free Black Girl living with the family and in the 1830 census a free Black Boy was residing there as well. They would be paid for doing typical household chores [28].\n\n1820 Aug 16 -- Israel died in Belmont County, OH, on 16 Aug 1820, a few days after the 1820 census and one month before his 74th birthday. The location of his burial is unknown, but in those days it was typical for someone to be buried on their own land [27].\n\nSee [30]p. 394. Stillwater is just outside Barnesville in Belmont Co., OH.\n\nFrom Jefferson County Chapter, Ohio Genealogical Society: http://jeffcochapter.com/french.html\n\nThe ÒFrenchÓ surname is an old colonial name; one branch of which settled in the Annapolis and Anne Arundel County area of Maryland in the late 1600Õs. It is not known exactly when they arrived in America. Otho French is one of the first known Frenchs in Maryland. He was born there around 1707. His son Israel (Sr.) was born in the All Hallows parish in 1746. Israel French married Margaret Grant at the All Hallows Anglican Church in 1770. Their first three children would be born in Anne Arundel County.\n\nThe early 1770Õs were a very turbulent time in the British Colony of America. It was a time of mis-trust between the colonials and the British - the talk of a revolution was in the air. It was potentially a great danger to a young family like the FrenchÕs who were living in the bustling, strategic commercial area of Annapolis. Some colonists were opposed to a war. Some became British sympathizers – Tories – and were publically ridiculed. Others were pacifists but were not British sympathizers. The French Family were not Tories but most likely did not support war.\n\nAround 1775 with a war looming, Israel Sr. and Margaret French changed their lives greatly. They left the Anglican Church – the official Church of England – and became Quakers. The Quaker faith strictly opposes war. Religion was a much larger part of life back then and to change faiths was a serious commitment. The French Family also relocated from busy Annapolis to remote Frederick County in western Maryland where warfare would probably not invade their life. Israel SrÕs only known encounter with the American Revolution was in 1776 when he was fined 2 pounds by a Maryland War Commission for not enrolling with the local militia to train for combat. He held fast to his new Quaker faith.\n\nIn Frederick County, the FrenchÕs built a homestead at Pipe Creek where a Quaker Friends Meeting House had been established in 1735. They had a few more children including Israel Jr. who was born in 1779. The family lived a quiet life farming the land in the Pipe Creek community for over 30 years. They were registered in the 1790 and 1800 census for Frederick County Maryland. Israel Sr. and Margaret died around 1820 most likely in Maryland but possibly in Ohio.\n\n5.9 Joanna French, b. 11 Dec 1749 (twin) in Anne Arundel Co., MD, dau. of Otho and Emma. She m.

In this census is also a female age 50-59, born 1781-1790 who could very well have been Rebecca Chaney. It would stand to reason that Nicholas named a son William after his father.\n\n1850 census -- Rebecca Chaney is listed in the 1850 census of Baltimore Ward 11, Baltimore, Maryland, age 69, b. 1781, living with the McKeever family and 5 unrelated people all born in England, Ireland, and Maryland.

WilliamÕs father was Henry Hall, born 21 Jul 1751 in All Hallows Parish, Anne Arundel, MD, and worshipped with Otho FrenchÕs descendants there before both families moved to OH. Otho moved to OH in 1799 when he was 22, just at the time when William Hall was born and his father Henry Hall had died. William then resided with Otho French until William became of age. Those years would probably be from 1799 until 1815 at which time William married Hannah Tipton. Belmont and Harrison counties are next to each other, but no determination has been made as to where Otho was living between 1799 and 1815 as the OhioÕs first census was in 1820 at which time Otho was living in Belmont County, OH.\n\n1800 -- Family home of Otho French Jr. built in early 1800s in Belmont County, OH, 2 miles east of Barnesville, OH.\n\n1802 Feb 18 -- Otho m.

The household consisted of a man 50-60 years old (born 1780-1790), 3 young men between 20-30, a boy between 16-20, and a young woman between 20-30.\n\n1850 census, Otho (age 72) and Elizabeth (67) were living alone on their land that was worth $2,000 [27].\n\nAmong the first pioneers of Warren Township was Otho French, and as he was conspicuous among them, firmly impressing upon early times some of the peculiarities of his own character, from the many noted incidents in his career, we will present a few of the more salient. After settling in Ohio, Mr. French, in a very brief period, became an expert hunter, surpassing all competitors, and his fame, in this respect, was so great that his neighbors, many times, would work in his clearings in order that he might go to kill game for them. In this manner he acquired a most consummate knowledge of the means to secure game. An old acquaintance and relative of Mr. French has kindly furnished us with some interesting hunting incidents in this life [27].\n\nMr. French had two modes for hunting turkeys: first, the old stratagem of hiding and then calling like one of a flock. He however, combined with it a well trained turkey-dog which would scatter the flock, calling them would bring large numbers of the disturbed flock about his hiding places, thus giving him more numerous chances to kill them. Second, to hunt out their roostings and shoot them by moonlight. He discovered at this first trial by moonlight that to shot his turkey, the main must be taken from 6 to 8 inches beyond the point desired to be hit. These nocturnal expeditions were generally successful [27].\n\nOf wolf hunting he says, ÒMr. French was the most accomplished wolf trapper ever resident in Belmont County. So expert did he become in the capture of these animals that he rarely failed, if he set his traps, to catch one of them. The wolf is your sly customer, and can only be caught in a trap by much deception [27].\n\nDuring the winter of 1815, Mr. French captured six wolves. His traps that winter were set on the Leatherwood, about two and a half miles southwest of Barnesville. His mode of trapping was to place the bait near a stream of water, so that the wolf could not get it without crossing the stream from the opposite side. He would set the trap under the water, and place a flat stone on the treadle, and lay others a short distance apart from the banks to the trap, for the wolf to step on. He never could catch any unless the trap was set under water. The last one he caught in his traps in the winter of 1815, as soon as it saw Mr. French laid down as quietly as a dog. He thought it was of the kind that they said could be handled like a kitten. French came up and touched it. It showed its teeth. He then reached his hat out to it, which was seized and torn to pieces. Mr. French then determined to take it home alive. Having, with the assistance of a friend, secured and muzzled it, he started home. As he passed through Barnesville, he caused quite an excitement by having a live wolf tied on his horse behind him [27].\n\nMr. French was also a great bee hunter. In early times there was no bee-moth, and the old hives were often very rich in honey. He very frequently obtained as much as twenty to twenty-five gallons from one bee tree. The greatest quantity he ever got from one swarm was found in a limb, the hollow of which was fully ten feet long, and over a foot in diameter. His manner of finding a bee tree, was to place bait in some convenient place, and watch the course of the bees [27].\n\nMr. French killed a great many bears within the limits of Warren Township. Once he found a bearÕs den in a large poplar. So collecting a number of youngsters to help him cut the tree, they paraded at the spot, in high glee at the coming sport. French set his gun against a tree near at hand, but as to be out of the way of the falling tree. They then commenced cutting down the old poplar. They had not chopped long before they heard some noise up the tree, and looking up, beheld the bear coming down. French thought of his gun, and started for it on the run. The boys thought he was running to escape from the bear, and so cut dirt as fast as their legs could carry them. Some of them did not stop until they were out of sight and hearing. French shot the bear, and had a hearty laugh at the expense of the boys [27].\n\nIn all his hunting adventures, he was never injured by any wild animal. The narrowest escape he ever had was from a wounded buck. He had shot it in the shoulder, and so disabled it that his dog soon brought it to bay. Before he could reload his gun, the deer had caught the dog between its horns and pinned him to the ground. French re-loaded his gun as quick as possible, and ran up close, so as to shoot it in the head. As soon as the deer saw him, it loosed its hold on the dog, threw its hair all back the wrong way and pitched at French, who barely had time to level his gun and pull the trigger, before the deer would have been upon him. His shot was fatal, and the buck fell dead at his feet [27].\n\nThe most remarkable feature of Mr. FrenchÕs life was his persistent, uniform and ceaseless opposition to the use of spirituous liquors as a beverage. There were no circumstances in which he tolerated its use, as such, either by himself or by others, and in this particular has set an example that should be followed by all who teach total abstinence: Òput in practice yourself, what you preach to others. Do not talk temperance and act whiskeyÓ. He would not walk on the side-walk in front of a tavern at which liquors were sold. Sooner than do so he would walk out into the deep mud or snow of the street, until he had passed the tavern, and then come on the side-walk again. And nother could induce him to enter such a tavern if he know it. During the latter years of his life he was in the habit of entertaining droves and drovers. His universal inquiry of the drovers was: ÒHas any of your stock been fed at a still house? If they have, you cannot stop with me.Ó [27].\n\nOtho left Frederick County with his friend and neighbor, Robert Plummer (who was also a Quaker), who was from New Market in Frederick County. They reached Marietta, the first settlement on the Ohio River, and learned from surveyors of the new land that there was beautiful land in eastern Ohio that was being designated as Belmont County. They staked out a claim of 600 acres in Warren Township, Belmont County [27]. Otho m. Elizabeth Anderson on 19 Feb 1802 in Frederick County, before he had returned to Warren Township in the spring of 1802 where he had staked out land [27]. Abraham Plummer had agreed to sell him the southwest part of Section 10 comprising 100 acres, as Abraham has returned to Maryland and moved out to Ohio immediately in 1801. This transaction was recorded on 20 Aug 1804 in the first book of deeds of Belmont County. Otho put up a crude log cabin, but not long after built a Òfine hewn log cabinÓ where they lived until he built a two-story brick house with a large cellar and high attic. It was still standing in 1993 when Martha Frasher Laney wrote the French family genealogy, and was still known as ÒThe French House.Ó Otho left Frederick County with his friend and neighbor, Robert Plummer, who was from New Market in Frederick County.

Hon. A.T. McKelvey 1801- 1901. For the complete article, see Ref. [35].\n\nA noted hunter in those days was a pioneer named Otho French, whose skill in trapping wolves, fighting wild cats, killing bears and deer, and gathering wild honey, are still listened to with entire credulity and enthusiasm by the younger generation. French was a zealot in the cause of temperance, and in those days of universal indulgence in the strong drink, refused to entertain in his cabin those carrying liquor about their persons, or shelter the drovers' hogs that were fattened at a distillery.\n\n1806 -- Belmont County tax records confirm that Otho French paid taxes in the county in 1806, in Kirkwood Township in 1807 and 1808, and in Warren Township in 1809 and 1810. He is not listed in the U.S. Federal Censuses of 1810, 1820, or 1830.\n\nOtho French was among the first pioneers of Warren Township. He was born in Frederick County, Maryland in 1777. He did not have much of an education as his parents were poor but very respectable.\n\nIn the year 1800, Robert Plummer, a neighbor, asked him to go \"West\" with him and assist him in the selection of some land for entry, and he would sell French a part of the land so taken up. They could not in those days, get less than a section of land. Otho accepted the proposition and they started on their journey. At Marietta, Ohio, they heard such glowing accounts of section 10, Warren township, that they got someone to point out the section line that led to it.\n\nFollowing this line north, they reached section ten and knew as soon as they reached it so vivid had been the description given them at Marietta. They made the entry and returned home. Robert Plummer and his family came at once in 1801. The country was all timber, and with few if any roads. It is said it took the Plummers five days to come from the open road where Morristown now stands, to the present Plummer homestead near Tacoma, Ohio. The way had to be cleared as they came.\n\nOtho French married in a short time after he returned to his home in Maryland, and they came to Warren township in 1802. Robert Plummer, as he had agreed to do, sold him the southwest part of section 10 on easy terms. He at once put up a crude log cabin but soon built a hewn log cabin where they lived for some time. Later he built a brick two-story house, with two large rooms downstairs and two up. It had small windows -- two in the front and two in the back -- with small panes of glass. A well was dug at the front of the house near the northeast corner and water was drawn by windlass. There was a cellar under the entire house. In the northeast corner, an opening was made in the foundation about two by three feet, even with the top of the well. This opening made a deep shelf and here they kept their milk and butter -- in a primitive refrigerator.\n\nThere were two or three steps up to the doors on the first floor. Large fireplaces were in the downstairs rooms. Each room, both upstairs and down, had a large closet. Shelves in the downstairs closets were used as cupboards and in the upstairs, there was one shelf the length of the closet and hooks below for clothing. The ceilings were very low and the doors so low that a man had to stoop to pass through. The closed stairway was narrow with only space for one person. The steps were straight and rather steep to a landing, then two more steps to the second floor. Under these steps was the cellar way.\n\nThe cellar has never had to be cemented as it has a solid stone floor. So this house \"built on a strong foundation\" has stood straight and solid all years. It must have been built about 1815, we have not been able to learn the exact date.\n\nThere were many wild animals in this new and unsettled country and Otho French was a noted hunter and trapper. The outstanding feature of his whole life was his strong opposition to \"spirituous liquors\". The State of Maine had passed a temperance law, the first in the United States. Otho French wanted Ohio to adopt the same law and was so strong for it, he had a sign over his front door, \"Hold on to the Maine Law forever.\"\n\nHe kept drovers and their flocks over night, and they always were asked the question, \"Are your stock fed on Brewers grains?\" If they had been, they were never allowed to stay. One evening a drover stopped. He was asked the usual question and replied \"No\", but in some way Otho had learned he had not been told the truth, and although supper was on the table they were not allowed to stay.\n\nMy mother used to tell me, when she was a little girl, she was passing with her father on horseback and she saw Otho standing at the front door gently pushing a drover away and was telling him he could not stay as his stock were fed on Brewers grains.\n\nWhen he was on his death bed, he asked his family to have engraved on his tombstone, \"Hold on to the Maine Law forever,\" which request was granted and that tombstone can still be found in the \"French\" or township graveyard, one fourth of a mile southeast of Tacoma, Ohio, across the Baltimore and Ohio railroad tracks. The epitaph reads ÒHold on for the maine law until the curse is banished from our nation.Ó\n\nHe died in his 80th year.\n\nSource: Written by: Anna Bailey Patten.\n\nNote: Otho French was not a Friend or a member of Stillwater Quarterly meeting but he was so closely connected with the early history of the Friends of Warren township, we feel his history should be recorded here.\n\nWebsite: http://strattonhouse.com/index.php?section=history&content=30013737\n\nWolf Hunting Near Barnesville, Ohio\n\nby Marie Bundy\n\nOtho French, who lived in Tacoma, east of Barnesville, was well known for his skill in hunting during the early 1800s.

Deborah ca. 1805 in the Short Creek Meeting House and had a daughter Zeruah in 1807 [28]. Daughter Juliann was born on 21 May 1813. In 1810 Israel French Jr. purchased a brick house in New Market, Frederick Co., MD. New Market was founded in 1793 by two gentlemen of the area, Nicholas Hall and William Plummer, both of whom had close ties with Israel French. Nicholas Hall sold the first lots, thereby setting into motion the plan to establish a town beside the rough wagon trail, known as the Baltimore Turnpike. The street is now a National Historic Landmark [27]. By 1812, the town had a button factory, nail factory, wheelwright shops, blacksmith shops, tanneries, dry goods, grocery stores, inns, taverns, livery stables, wagon stands, distilleries, and a house of entertainment.\n\nIsrael Jr. may have worked in the real estate business or had a partnership with a Joel Elliot. In 1812 he bought land for Elliot in Frederick County, Maryland and later in 1815 he bought land for Elliot again in Belmont County, Ohio. Israel Jr.Õs brother Otho and sister Emma had previously bought land in Ohio as well. These three French siblings all decided to relocate their families to neighboring Belmont and Jefferson counties in Ohio between 1810 and 1815. This area was the wild frontier of America back in those times but it also had a strong Quaker population [28].\n\nIsrael French Jr. decided to build a home in Mount Pleasant village in Jefferson County. The town was founded ten years earlier as a haven for North Carolina Quakers who had aligned themselves with the Anti-slavery cause. The town is only a few miles from the Ohio River and the slave-holding Virginia border (West Virginia today). Here the Quakers would be more easily able to help escaped slaves along their northward journey on the Underground Railroad. Black residents were integrated into the Mt. Pleasant society; some purchasing property on the lands bought and divided by Israel French Jr. [28]\n\n1804 Nov 16 – Israel French Jr., while living in Columbiana, OH, was admitted to the Sandy Spring Monthly Meeting in Columbiana, OH, for the Pre-Separation/Hicksite Meeting of the Quaker Friends.\n\n1800 – Israel and his sister Emma were registered at the Pipe Creek Quaker Friends Meeting House.\n\n1807 Sep 22 – Israel was rocf (received on certificate from) Pipe Creek Quaker Friends Meeting House, and attended the Concord Monthly Meeting [30].

As Ohio was a free state, it is unknown how this could have been the case. Perhaps the family had a servant girl living with them that the census taker put down as a slave [27]. It listed Israel as a ÒmanufacturerÓ for his occupation. Along with occasional land dealings, he was also known as a teacher throughout the region. An interesting note in the census indicated that there was a free Black Girl living with the family and in the 1830 census a free Black Boy was residing there as well. They would be paid for doing typical household chores [28].\n\nThe late 1820Õs would be a time of reckoning for the Quaker population through out the United States and especially in Mt. Pleasant where a revolution would take place. Oddly enough, the Society of Friends who based much of their faith in non-violence would see the potential towards violence as a reality amongst themselves. Elias Hicks was a travelling Quaker from Long Island, New York who preached about the straying of the Society of Friends. He believed that the traditional Quaker methods taught by John Woolman were being forgotten and that they should return to the faith and values of the Quaker forefathers. HicksÕ popularity was very strong in Ohio and Indiana otherwise known as the ÒNorthwest TerritoriesÓ of the US at that time. His followers would become known as ÒHicksitesÓ.\n\nIsrael French Jr. had become a respected and well-known Quaker leadership figure in Mt. Pleasant. He was in favor of the preachings of Elias Hicks and the return to traditional values along with a large number of other Ohio families. Quakers would hold quarterly meetings in regional areas of individual states and in the last quarter meeting of 1827 the separation of beliefs became evident. Israel and a few other Hicksite Friends were to be appointed as committee members but had their names erased and were excluded from holding office by the Orthodox Quakers. Israel and his colleagues were assuredly upset. Though they still considered themselves Friends, they bided their time until the 1828 yearly meeting of ministers and elders.\n\nIn September of 1828, the Quaker Ohio yearly meeting was held at Mt. Pleasant. At the first days meeting, Elias Hicks was verbally harassed following his speech and later that night a confrontation was planned. It is known that during the week of the meeting, Hicks and his supporting elders also held private evening meetings at the home of Israel French, Jr. As the second dayÕs meeting was about to begin, Israel stood up and protested that he would no longer recognize the clerks of the meeting and that new ones should be appointed. About half of the attendees agreed stating, ÒI concur.Ó Another from IsraelÕs party called for a new (Hicksite) head clerk of the meeting. Again, a large number spoke, ÒI concurÓ. After this, voices were raised for and against the disturbance then some shoving began. Order was restored shortly there after and no more physical confrontations occurred. Since Hicksites had the slight majority of numbers, the Orthodox Quakers had to vacate the meeting house and held their conference outside.\n\nThis rebellion officially would split the Society of Friends throughout the young United States. Accounts of the events from the schism have been clearly documented through transcripts of the legal proceedings that were held in 1828 and 1829. Some Hicksites including Israel French Jr. were fined a token amount and did 30 minutes of jail time for inciting riotous behavior. A retrial at the Ohio Supreme Court over-ruled the fines and determined both parties should share the blame. In an 1829 letter written by Israel Jr. to Elias Hicks, he tells Hicks about the continuing disputes between the two Quaker factions and little hope for a fast reconciliation, ÒÉbut from Ohio I fear a long course of probation awaits thee. Thy shepherds appear to have been smote with blindness and thy flock scattered while devouring wolves seek them for a prey.Ó\n\n1829 Apr 9 –\n\nLetter To Elias Hicks From Israel French Jr.\n\nBridgeport, Ohio\n\nApril 9, (1829)\n\nDear Friend,\n\nI received thy very acceptable favor of the 21st of the 2nd month last. We were rejoiced to hear of thy safe arrival at home for reports had been put in circulation that thou hadst been denied that favor and had departed this life before thou had reached the arms of thy family. But it appears to have been ordered otherwise by our gracious and kind heavenly father whom I trust thou hast been serving with fidelity in so much that the enemies of all good have thereby been incited to jealousy. And finding that thou couldst not be brought to bow down and worship the work of menÕs hands for all the kingdoms that the world could present, nor get to cast thyself down where set as it were on the pinnacle of the temple; this spirit of anti-christ hath become exceedingly enraged - pursuing with unrelenting hate every appearance of the steadfast reliance on him who alone remains to be the author and finisher of the true Christian faith.\n\nI have also seen in a New York paper an account of the departure of thy dear consort. Have felt deep sympathy on the occasion for as mortal beings, we cannot help feeling our depreciations - especially those of so tender a tie. But when we recollect, we are so soon to follow and have the appearance of a well grounded hope of reunion in that state where the wicked cease from troubling, the weary are at rest, and the poignancy of grief is abated; and this I trust dear friend, is thy liberation. And it must have afforded some consolation to thy mind that thou wast permitted to arrive in time to witness the closing scene of her with whom thou has passed so great a portion of time in that union of love that constitutes the greatest felicity allowed to us here, which we may reasonably conclude that forms an important item of the joys to be realized in a never ending state.\n\nI also heartily rejoice that thou wast favored to perform my visit or rather that we were favored to have thy company and services at the time we did. Many have been convinced of the falsity of the charges against thee, but there are still thousands in our country who having suffered themselves to be imposed on receiving too easy credulity - the false statements of their leaders - are yet sitting as it were in darkness. It is a time of great trial indeed to see so many of our friends drawn away by this dark accusing spirit and become so bewildered that they cannot receive the truth. If Òthe darkest time is just before dayÓ (as thou observed to me near our parting) surely we may hope that the day may begin to dawn ever long and I think it will in the East, but from Ohio I fear a long course of probation awaits thee. Thy shepherds appear to have been smote with blindness and thy flock scattered while devouring wolves seek them for a prey. But I will be silent perhaps – itÕs all in the ordering of wisdom by him who knows best and that these trials are permitted to work some great good at present in mercy concealed from the view of many.\n\nOur meetings are mostly attended but I think that there are many that still go with our opposers on account of them being in possession of most of the meeting houses and perhaps other reasons of a private nature & popularity. There have been a few desertions from our ranks but they were mostly where Friends are in the majority. Where Friends are small in number and have been much tried, there has been an accession to their numbers – particularly at Smithfield Friends – they at first considered themselves almost too weak to hold a meeting at all but they have gathered up and hold a monthly meeting and are preparing to build themselves a house.\n\nAt Concord, Friends have braved the storm until the Orthodox have left them and hold their meeting in the schoolhouse. Elisha Bates and Rebecca Updegraff made an appointment at Concord last first day for a meeting at 2 oÕclock in the afternoon to be Òprincipally for the SeparatistsÓ – using a great deal of ingenuity to get them by their attendance to acknowledge themselves as Separatists. They soon informed them (at the close of the forenoon meeting) that if they wanted the meeting house for themselves as Separatists from the Society of Friends, they could have it, but that they could not sanction them by giving their attendance and retired to their homes. The Orthodox held their meeting in the schoolhouse and withdrew also, but at some other meetings they have not been so guarded but have opened their meeting house and attended. I know not what is best but I am very fearful that Friends will not be sufficiently attentive to Òbe aware of the Leaven of the PhariseesÓ, and more especially as they are now assuming a softer tone better calculated to allure the innocent.\n\nI received an interesting letter a few days since from Noah Haines from Waynesville, Miami County. This dear Friend appears to continue alive in the truth. He informs us that after making great efforts to scatter and drive Friends from the meeting house (which Friends bore with patience but persevered with firmness to hold all their meetings) the Orthodox are having them in most of their meetings in that quarter. I also received a letter some time ago from dear Amos Peaslee. Not with standing his great trials, he appears to continue to be engaged as a laborer in the LordÕs vineyard – visiting the meetings in Jersey; but I think there is no place where the declaration Òthe harvest is truly great and the laborers are fewÓ is realized than in our poor Ohio. And my mind is often drawn to the junction Òpray ye the Lord of the harvest that he would send forth laborers into his harvestÓ.\n\nAnd I have been ready to say is not our case similar to that of David and his men when pursued by Saul? We have a number of raw and undisciplined men and pursued by those who have appeared in former times to be the LordÕs anointed. And oh if we may in mercy be so preserved as David was not to stretch forth a carnal hand against them although they may appear to have fallen as SaulÕs head. I hope we may yet be made to rejoice as David did not at the overthrow of those that sought his life but in the God of his salvation that preserved him from evil, so that in time all Israel were brought back – and that this may be the case with our poor deluded brethren. That they may return to their first love and put this accusing spirit from them is the sincere desire of my soul.\n\nWe are all in usual health. My dear Wife and Daughter join in much love to thee hoping that thou mayest continue to persevere in the path of perfect obedience so as to witness the sun of righteousness to gild thy evening days and receive in the end the answers of well done good. And faithful servant, enter thou into the joys of the Lord. I subscribe thy friend and brother in the truth – Elias Hicks.\n\nIsrael French\n\nPS. Please present our love to our dear friend Jesse Merritt, also to our dear friend Townsend Hawkhurst if way should open. He paid us a very acceptable visit some years ago and as well as I recollect, was the second person that the Orthodox undertook to grind because he observed in his testimony that the captain of our salvation Òwas placed in the same predicament with ourselves. Being in all points tempted as we are _______(letter torn) sinÓ, this gave offense to some of Òthe better part of societyÓ as they stated themselves at that time. And they refused to give him an endorsement though Ann Taylor told me then that she considered him a solid Friend.\n\nI think sometimes it will Òdevolve on meÓ to write a history of the Ohio yearly meeting as I recollect not to have been absent from a single meeting of it from its commencement until I was dragged away from it by the civil officers at the insistence of Orthodoxy in 1828 – a span of 16 years during which time from my peculiar situation and standing, I became acquainted with the origin of many things that would be well to be preserved as beacons to warn succeeding generations of the rocks on which our bark appears at present to have been shattered. If it is not too great a burden or if thou hast anything to communicate for our help or encouragement, I should be glad to receive a line from thee when it may be convenient.\n\nNB. It is hard to ascertain the standing of the parties as regards to numbers. The Orthodox make a great parade at meetings for discipline, going in flocks from neighboring meetings, perhaps to make a show of strength to discourage us. But from what we have ascertained by actual enumeration in some meetings, we think an equal division is not far from the truth of the case and it is quite uncertain on which side the majority would be.\n\n1830 census – Mount Pleasant, Jefferson County, OH\n\n1 male age 20-29, b. 1801-1810, Israel French 3rd.\n\n1 male age 50-59, b. 1770-1780, Israel Sr.\n\n1 female age 15-19, b. 1811-1815, Julia\n\n1 female age 20-29, b. 1801-1810, Zeruah\n\n1 female age 40-49, b. 1781-1790, unk.\n\n1 female age 50-59, b. 1770-1780, Israel Sr.Õs wife\n\nIsrael Jr. would correspond occasionally with Halliday Jackson – a Hicksite Quaker from Darby, Pa. Jackson was visiting the Mt. Pleasant meeting the day the schism took place and was called to testify in the subsequent trials. From 1830 to 1833, Israel would send letters to Jackson keeping him abreast of the SocietyÕs issues. One October 1830 letter described the split over the use of the existing meetinghouse. The Hicksite and Orthodox Friends came to an agreement for a while for both of them to use the same meetinghouse for yearly and other meetings although at different times. There were still very bitter feelings evident as Israel Jr. told Jackson, ÒWe closed the 5th day and left the house in good order for the reception of our enemies – for so I think we may justly call them. They have manifested so much enmity of late – endeavoring to assail and destroy if possibly the reputation of every minister that appears to be pointing the way to life.Ó\n\nThere is little doubt that the on-going hard feelings from the Hicksite separation put attention and stress on the French family. Young Israel III may not have supported the radical Quaker ways of his father and his name has not been found on transcribed Quaker records. Around 1829 Israel III left the family and moved back east to Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania – 60 miles from Frederick County Maryland. There he was married as a Methodist in 1830. However, Israel JrÕs daughters were known to strongly support their father in religion and in the Abolition cause. Around 1830, Zeruah French married Joel Wood who was a prominent figure in the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society. He helped form the Liberty Party which put a Presidential Candidate on the ballot. Julia French would marry Dr. Caleb Cope in 1849. He was raised on an Underground Railroad stop. He helped his father Joshua hide slaves in a clever spot behind their sawmillÕs water wheel.\n\nThe FrenchÕs became members of the Short Creek Friends Society - one mile west of Mt. Pleasant - after the Orthodox Quakers re-took control of the Mt. Pleasant meetinghouse. Israel Jr. still continued his leadership role; he was the head clerk at the Wheeling (West) Virginia Friends yearly meeting in 1831. He was also an agent and writer for the ÒAdvocate of TruthÓ from 1830 – 1833. The ÒAdvocateÓ was a monthly published news and opinion pamphlet of the Hicksite Quaker Friends Society. In one of the 1831 issues, Israel described a bit of hope for the relationship between the two factions. The meeting house was being swept out by Mr. Richards, a Hicksite, after a meeting when an Orthodox guard of the building walked up and stated, ÒÕI am appointed to keep the houseÕ to which Richards replied, ÔAnd so am I and would be as well pleased with thy help as any personÕsÕ and pointing to a broom, the guard took it and they swept it out together. This is I think the first instance I have heard of anything like the parties joining in active operations within the limits of our Yearly Meeting since 1828.Ó\n\n1830 Oct 4 –\n\nLetter To Halliday Jackson From Israel French Jr.\n\nColerain, Ohio\n\nOctober 4, [1830?]\n\nEsteemed Friend Halliday Jackson,\n\nThy very acceptable letter with the pamphlets therein mentioned came safe to hand. This interesting work of our natured friend Job Scott has been rather scarce here and was an acceptable present from you. I gave them to our Committee for Sufferings and they were divided by them among the quarters for further usefulness. I had wanted to get some of them also in the Letter of Luke Howard and have this work, LukeÕs letter attesting it and JobÕs character, and the ÒAnswer to Luke by a Friend in AmericaÓ all bound together. This would please the subject in a prominent point of view to every reader and I think be more generally useful than to have them separate. I am now supplied with about 10 of these treasures and the answer to Luke Howard but have not LukeÕs letter. If there are any of them that can be readily obtained with you, I would be glad if thee would send me an equal number (or more) to enable me to carry my design into effort. Perhaps thou can find some safe hand to send them by as I am in hopes some more of our friends will find themselves drawn to visit in gospel love their poor little weak brethren in the west.\n\nThee requested me to give thee our account of our yearly meeting. My apology for not attending to it sooner is in disposition in my family. My daughter – my only child I now have with me – was taken ill during the yearly meeting week. We almost despaired of her life for sometime. And this has been the first day that she has been able to sit up and but little at a time yet, but she appears now to be in a way to recover. Her case was fever of the rather of the typhoid type. There have been many cases of this and dysentery amongst us this summer and several deaths – mostly young people in the bloom of life.\n\nWith regard to our yearly meeting, I think it was rather larger than it was last year – especially on the sisterÕs side. We had the company of Elizabeth Cox and companions Mary Matthews accompanied by her husband Eli Matthews from Baltimore, and Joseph Cadwallader, Amos Cook and Samuel Paine from Indiana. Our dear ancient friend Hugh Judge also attended – alive in the truth – and seemed to enjoy himself as well as I have ever seen him. Near the close he bore testimony to itÕs being one of the most solemn and interesting yearly meetings he had through the long course of his life and ever been favored to sit in. And indeed I can add my testimony that for solemnity of feeling and harmony of proceeding, I have seldom if ever seen one to equal the present. Not that we were all in one opinion on matters that came before us but all seemed to be striving to advance the cause; and when after free and open discussion, the best way seemed to be pointed out. All seemed willing to relinquish their own previous views and adopt it. We closed on the 5th day and left the house in good order for the reception of our enemies – for so I think we may justly call them. They have manifested so much enmity of late – endeavoring to assail and destroy if possibly the reputation of every minister that appears to be pointing the way to life.\n\nPoor Joseph Cadwallader – a more innocent or honest man I think lives not. He has all the innocence of the dove but lacks the wisdom of the serpent which really appears to be requisite among such wolves. They have strove to circumscribe his labors in these parts, raising a report that he had twice made sale of a piece of property. And rather than be exposed, had been induced to refund the purchase money and a good deal more so as by insinuation to make him appear quite fraudulent. Now the truth appears to be Joseph sold a town lot, had a deed prepared, notified the purchaser who promised to call and get it. Joseph moved to Indiana. The purchaser (who was brother-in-law to Joseph) called on JosephÕs brother who was the person who held the deed but managed so as not to have left it - JosephÕs brother also moved to the west. And now when Joseph was with us, his brother-in-law called on him apparently in a very friendly manner and after stating that he had not got his deed, [he was told] that the lot had been sold for taxes and received from Joseph a sum as a full indemnity and satisfaction of all claims. And Joseph in that confiding way which is common to good and unsuspecting men, paid the money without ascertaining where the deed was, or taking any receipt, or clearance from his brother-in-law – after which this wicked version of a tale was put into circulation. I have been thus particular as this upright movement was made to look so bad here. I do not know how black it may appear by the time it reaches your lying friend.\n\nI have no late account of the trespass case, so conclude and remain thy friend,\n\nIsrael French\n\nPS – I would take it as a favor if thee would – when thee goes to the city – call on Marcus TC Gould and have the direction of my paper altered to be forwarded in future to Farmington, Colerain Township, Belmont County, Ohio; to which place thee will also please to direct thy letters. My present residence being about 5 miles south of Mount Pleasant.\n\nNB – It may be proper to note that the lot sold by Joseph Cadwallader had fallen in value and that his brother-in-law had offered to sell it for one-half of what Joseph now paid him. So it will appear that Evan Herford (as his name ought to be recorded somewhere) – he being the purchaser and brother-in-law – had a double purpose to effect to obtain more than the present value for his lot which might have satisfied a man merely covetous and second to injure a man whom he envies. Well, might Solomon say who can stand before envy? Joseph seems to be improving in best wisdom and nothing appears to remove the enmity of those people so much so, any of those they would wish to ____________[letter torn] because they have unjustly called them __________[letter torn] abiding in the Truth.\n\n1831 Feb 23 and 1832 Dec 19 – in Short Creek and White Water [30], p. 146.\n\n1831 Feb 24 – Time of Courts – common pleas – for Jefferson County, Ohio at Steubenville for 1831 – May 2nd, August 22nd, Nov. 21st.
