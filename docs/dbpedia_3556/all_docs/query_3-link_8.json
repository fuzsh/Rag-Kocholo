        "text": "Descendants of John Wooldridge\n\nGeneration No. 1\n\n1. John1 Wooldridge was born Abt. 1678 in England, and died 1757 in Henrico County, Virginia. He married Martha Osborne Abt. 1703 in Henrico County, Virginia. She was born Abt. 1680 in Fauquier, Virginia, and died Aft. 1757 in Henrico County, Virginia.\n\nNotes for John Wooldridge:\n\nJOHN WOOLDRIDGE (SR.), Immigrant Blacksmith and Planter\n\n(c. 1678-1757)\n\nThough not documented, family legend has it that the Wooldridges are from Scotland. Laurence B. Gardiner found in the Memphis genealogy library a paper on old homes of Shelby County, Tennessee, which says John Wooldridge Elam named his home East Lothian after the county of the settler's ancestors south of the Firth of Forth in Scotland, and that his brothers named their homes West Lothian and South Lothian. In 1982 L. Gardiner and William C. Wooldridge engaged Mrs. Kathleen B. Cory to search births in the surviving parish register of Midlothian, Scotland, for the period 1660-1680, but she found no Wooldridges either there or in her survey of available printed indices to Scottish records of the 17th century, with the exception of a family in Edinburgh (Constantine Wooldridge married Margaret Akinstall, Oct. 24, 1644; Constantine Wooldridge painter married Marjory D. of Patrick Copland mariner, Dec. 18, 1869; George Wooldridge or Woolredge joiner md. Isobel Hart, Nov. 20, 1668.)\n\nIn the early 1600's at the same time that Jamestown, Virginia, was being settled, Ulster, Ireland finally capitulated to England, and England brought in colonists from Scotland and England to colonize and subjugate Ulster. Presbyterian, they still had to pay taxes to the Church of England (in Scotland they paid taxes to the Church of Scotland) which was Anglican. They could not hold political office, have certain jobs, paid extra taxes, and suffered other discriminations. so, in the late 1600's, these Presbyterian Scots-Irish began to immigrate to the New World.\n\nA blacksmith in Ireland did quite well. He would have done the smithing work for about 200 families, covering about an 1800-acre area. All hardware needs would have been supplied by him--he would have been the local Walmart, making all metal kitchen utensils, nails, hinges, wheel hubs, keys, locks, farming tools, and so on. As an economic example, if a housewife needed a spatula, it would have cost her about a month's egg and butter money -- the money she used to run her house. Smithing was a full-time job --12 to 16 hours a day, 6 days a week. A blacksmith had no time nor financial need for farming.\n\nJohn Wooldridge (Sr.) was born about 1678 and immigrated from Scotland, Ireland or England (probably from Scotland) to Virginia in the New World probably in the 1690's as an indentured servant to Richard Kennon in Henrico County. In March 1699 he petitioned against his mistress, Mrs. Elizabeth Kennon, \"for wages according to Indenture.\" The petition was held through three subsequent sessions. The 1699 petition suggests an artisan's contract for passage -- John was a blacksmith -- as wages were more characteristic of artisans than agricultural indentures.\n\nThe Kennon establishment, Conjurer's Neck, stood on the Appomattox River about five miles from present-day Petersburg. Richard Kennon was among the newer class of merchants settling in Chesterfield County. His dwelling, known as \"Brick House\", erected at Conjurors Neck in 1685 is believed to be the oldest house still standing in Chesterfield. Conjuror's Neck is a peninsula formed by the junction of Swift Creek and the Appomattox River. Tradition says the name was given the area because it was the dwelling place of a famous Appomatucks Indian medicine man when the first white man came to Chesterfield. Richard Kennon died in 1696 and his widow, Elizabeth Bolling Kennon, ran the estate.\n\nIn 1685 a great pow-wow with the Eastern Indian tribes had been held in Albany, New York. Two of the few remaining local Appomatucks were included among the Virginia delegates to confirm the articles of peace. There were frequent acts of violence in later years, but the old fear of Indians had subsided.\n\nLaw enforcement, however, was a major concern. The pillory and whipping post were used for petty offenders and a ducking stool was available at Varina. For hog stealing in 1690, the penalty was to stand in the pillory for two hours with ears fastened to the beam by nails and then cut loose with a knife, the resulting mutilation being a sort of \"Beware\" notice. Branding in the hand for theft was a common punishment. Death was the penalty for horse stealing. John Stower was appointed constable for the large area from Falling Creek upwards to the present Powhatan line, taking in all of Midlothia.\n\nJohn Wooldridge (Sr.) worked as a blacksmith after his emancipation, staying the the Conjuror's neck area. He married Martha Osborne, (daughter of Edward Osborne) about 1704 or 1705 of the more established Osborne family, and began to raise a family. Captain Thomas Osborne came to Virginia in 1616 and took over the Coxendale tract abandoned after the 1622 Indian massacre there, and patented additional land on Proctors Creek where years later a town bearing his name was started. John (Jr.) was born about 1705, named after his father. Thomas (Sr.) was born about 1707, named after his maternal great-grandfather. William (Sr.) was born about 1709. Edward (Sr.) was born about 1711, named after his maternal grandfather. Despite his growing family, John was able to save money -- blacksmiths were scarce and were able to demand high wages for their work.\n\nThe winter of 1709-1710 was a hard one -- the whole colony was swept by disease. And in 1711 tension arose when there were rumors of an impending invasion by a French fleet. William Byrd, !!, as county lieutenant, made plans for defense, double called for after a planned Indian raid was also reported to him. The following spring the Govenor of North Carolina issued a call for 200 volunteers from Virginia for help against a planned Indian uprising. Twenty-six Young men from Chesterfield County responded, but by the time they reached Nottoway, word came that everything was okay.\n\nOn March 1, 1712, John bought his first land, 100 acres on the South side of the James River, from Bartholomew Stovall for five shillings. The land was bounded by Hugh Ligon and Edward Stratton.\n\nHis family continued to grow, and in 1715 his daughter, Mary, was born. Robert was born in 1719.\n\nIn 1725, John Sr. patented two 400-acre tracts, close to the boundaries of the Huguenot settlement that had been established in Manikin in 1700 near the present Chesterfield-Powhatan border. The first tract lay on the South side of the James River adjoining the lands Of Gilbert Gee and Mrs. Hannah Tullet. The second tract lay on the South side of Swift Creek on the Henrico Beaver Ponds. These patents began the Wooldridge coal interests. He gave the second tract to John Jr., who came of age about that time, as his own plantation.\n\nIn September 1729, John Sr. elevated his station, being thereafter called Mr. Wooldridge, dropping the assignation, blacksmith. He sold his old 100-acre tract, where he had lived, to Joseph Goode for 25 pounds and moved west to his Manikin land, bringing him closer to the Huguenot settlement than he was then ready to deal with. he was very unhappy when his daughter Mary later married a Huguenot.\n\nUp to the opening of the eighteenth century the imaginary boundary between the English settlements and the Indian lands was a line from the falls of the Appomattox River to the Manakin village on the James at the mouth of Bernards Creek. But on the far frontier of Virginia aggressive French forces with bloodthirsty Indian allies posed such a threat that a buffer was deemed desirable. Consequently a large tract of the wilderness was set aside for a new type of immigrant -- the peaceful religious refugees from France known as Huguenots. Approximately 100,000 acres of land in the old haunts of the Manakins were made available for the placement of families exiled from their French homes by religious persecution.\n\nBy the end of 1700, 800 Huguenots had settled in Virginia. While the Huguenots were Protestants and nominally under control of the Church of England, even their religious thought was alien to that of their neighbors in many respects. Radically different farming methods were brought by them, and they showed no inclination to adopt the pattern set by the affluent planters below the falls or to slip into the habits of the small inland farmers. English homes of the period wee often one and a half story homes (to avoid the tax on two-story homes) with a central hall and door. The Huguenot homes omitted the central hall (to save heat?) and used \"double doors\" -- an outside door to each room. Yet the adaptability of the Huguenots is evidenced as they left no dialect or accent as a heritage, contrary to the French in Canada or Louisiana, neither did they leave any distinctly French architecture. Soon there were intermarriages and in a remarkably short time little differences in nationalities was seen.\n\nEach of the refugee families was assigned 133 acres, and to encourage them in becoming permanently settled they were exempted by the Burgesses from all taxation for seven years, Later extended another year. Upon application i person to a distributing station at Bermuda Hundred, each of the French families were eligible to receive a bushel of Indian meal monthly to tide it over until crops could be made. The necessary monthly travel between the French settlement and Bermuda Hundred converted the old Indian trails into something resembling roads and even encouraged settlers to move into the no longer isolated interior. The manakins had been reduced to about 30 bowman and apparently were willing to leave their old hunting grounds peacefully. In 1711 Abraham Salle was one of those who moved south and received a large grant in Chesterfield. Salle's eldest daughter, Magdalene, later married John's youngest son.\n\nAlthough the move brought with it many good things, wolves during this period were a constant menace to the scattered residents of Chesterfield County. Bounties were being paid at each term of court for wolf heads and many young Chesterfield men became especially proficient in hunting down and slaying the wild beasts as a partial livelihood.\n\nAbout 1731, his eldest son, John, Jr., married Elizabeth Branch. Like his father, John married into one of the older and more prominent Virginia families. Christopher Branch had settled in Chesterfield County in the 1620's, and in 1624 his son was listed as the only Virginia born child in Chesterfield County. John Sr., soon became a grandfather with the birth of Richard Wooldridge.\n\nAbout 1732 his daughter, Mary, married Jacob Trabue, another at least occasional blacksmith who became interested in coal, but one of the strange thinking and acting Huguenots. John Sr. objected, declaring to the couple that he would give them no help or inheritance. In 1732 sons, Thomas and Edward patented land in Goochland.\n\nOn Jan. 4, 1733, grandson Joseph Trabue was born to daughter Mary Wooldridge Trabue. About 1733 another grandson, John Wooldridge, III, was born to his son John, Jr.\n\nThe area increased in importance at this time. In 1733, William Byrd, II, recorded in his diary plans to lay out two new cities, one north of the James River at Shaccos to become Richmond, and the other south of the Appomattox River near Blanford, to become Petersburg. He considered these points natural places for trade. In 1737 Major William Mayo finally surveyed the Richmond site.\n\nIn 1734, John, Jr. bought 300 acres of the Beaver Ponds land on Swift Creek, between the two proposed cities.\n\nAbout 1735, a granddaughter, Mary Wooldridge, was born to his son John Jr., and about this time son Thomas married and gave him another John Wooldridge grandson. Again the Wooldridges married into an older and more prominent family, although it is not certain that it is the Hatcher girl he married. William Hatcher had received a grant of 1050 acres between Swift Creek and the Appomattox River around 1635. On Aug. 28, 1735, son Jean/John Trabue was born to daughter Mary Wooldridge Trabue.\n\nIn 1736, John Sr. bought 650 acres on the Buckingham road from Henry Cary for 32 pounds 10 shillings. The land seemingly adjoins his 1725 patent. In 1736 John Sr. had two or three hands and John Jr. one, but sons William and Thomas had none. In 1736, when John Sr. was about 58 years old, he owed quit rents on 800 acres. His son William paid on an additional 100 acres owned by John Roberts, and John Jr. paid on 300 acres just purchased from Samuel Burton. About this time his son William started farming on his own on 100 acres of John Roberts. William married his first wife in the late 30's.\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1737, daughter Mary presented him with another grandson, David Trabue.\n\nIn 1738, grandson Richard Wooldridge, by son William, was born, and about 1740 grandson William Jr., was born. On March 22, 1739 grandson William Trabue was born to Daughter Mary Wooldridge Trabue.\n\nAbout 1740 son Thomas gave him another grandchild, Frances Wooldridge. On March 24, 1742 granddaughter Elizabeth Trabue was born to daughter Mary W. Trabue. In 1743 Mary Wooldridge was born to son Thomas, and on June 11, 1744, Thomas presented him with granddaughter Elizabeth. Mary W. Trabue gave him granddaughter Marie Trabue. Before 1744, perhaps about 1738, son Robert, about 18, married Magdalene Salle, said to be an old girl. About 1740, son Robert gave him grandson Colonel Thomas Wooldridge. Another son, Abraham? was born to son Robert in the 1740's.\n\nAbout 1745 the Wooldridge family built the first section of the family home, Midlothian, alongside an old Indian trail, then called Buckingham Road, now\n\nknown as Midlothian Turnpike. This part of the house, now known as the East Wing, was a one-and-a-half story house with a central hall, outside chimneys, and had steep winding stairs leading to two small loft rooms lit by dormers. A porch stretched across the length of the front of the House. In the latter part of the century, soon after the Revolution, the West Wing was added. This part of the house was also built as a two-over-two but the second story had a gambrel roof, the only such roof in the village, allowing more headroom upstairs. Midlothian has a long history of hospitality to travelers, continuing in some fashion even today as Crab Louis Restaurant, where the owners proudly point out its Wooldridge origins. Midlothia was renamed \"The Sycamores\" in the late 1800's by the then owners John J. Jewett and his wife Nancy Jones, who purchased it in 1875.\n\nAbout 1745 granddaughter Frances Wooldridge was born to son John Jr., and grandson Edward Wooldridge, Jr. was born to son Edward.\n\nJohn Sr. continued to add to his estate, purchasing in 1747, 314 acres \"on the French line\", South side of the James beginning at John Tillets on the north side of Falling Creek thence on Wooldridge's old line to John Roberts and Richard Dean, thence to Dean's old line to Oak cornered on Ffrench parish thence to French road. John Sr. made his first will in 1747 at about the age of 69, when his holdings peaked at 1,764 acres, including 400 acres long in the possession of his son, John, Jr. Also about 1747, grandson Simon Wooldridge was born to son Edward. On Sept. 4, 1747, daughter Mary W. Trabue gave him grandson Joshua Trabue.\n\nJohn Sr. had finally become reconciled to his French Huguenot children-in-law and Mary's marriage. According to William Lacy, \"About the year '46 John Wooldridger Sr. sent for me to write his will and told me then, when Jacob Trabue married his daughter, he was much dissatisfied with the match, and he then made a resolve never to make Jacob Trabue the better for anything he was worth, but after he found Trabue to be a good husband, he was sorry for his rash romise and had concluded to let his daughter have theuse of a Negro girl named Hannah and her increase during his daughter's life and after her death to her son Joseph Trabue. [He said] 'I will make my grandson equal to my other sons in everything exceptlandk' and so I wrote his will.\" The will is dated April 20, 1747, and was rewritten in 1757.\n\nFrom this period, if not earlier, John Sr. and his sons were directing their energies to growing tobacco, working their holdings personally with the help of some slave labor. Together, the family mastered the demands of growing tobacco. Virgin fields had to be cleared before cultivation. The trunks of trees were girdled, forcing the trees to die. Ropes were then attached to thebranches of the dead trees to pull them down. On rainy days, when the danger of fire spreading out of control was at a minimum, the fields would be burned. Plows had to then break through rooty topsoil, and the fields kept cultivated. After harvesting, the leafe had to be processed, and long sheds for drying the leaf had to be built. Oaken hogsheads had to be built or bought. When the crop was harvested and cured, it had to be transported for sale. Ten pounds of tobacco was worth about one shilling.\n\nSmall amounts of cotton and wool were also produced in Chesterfield for domestic use although spinning and weaving were technically forbidden in Virginia by British law -- the colonies were meant to consume to enrich the mother country, and all raw goods were by law to be shipped to England for manufacture. The finished products were then to be shipped back to the colonies for purchase. The women took the cleaned c\n\nJOHN WOOLDRIDGE, BLACKSMITH (by Laurence B. Gardiner & William C. Wooldridge 822 W. 52nd St., Norfolk, VA 23508\n\nIn the Henrico County Court for March 1699, the \"petn of John Woldredg against his Mistriss Mrs. Eliza Kennon for wages according to Indenture\" was presented, then held through the subsequent three sessions.\n\nThe petitioner sued in his own name (later Robert Hyde of York County became his lawyer) and he was probably near 21 in 1699.\n\n[Henrico Colonial Records 3:260, 265, 277, 280, Virginia\n\nState Library.)\n\n[It seems unlikely he was much over 21, as he lived until 1757, and an indenture often expired with the youth's 21st birthday. Richard Hofstadter, AMERICA AT 1750 (New York 1971], pp 49-50, For Hyde see WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY (hereafter WMQ), lst Sr. 6(1897-98):126; 14(1905-06):148\n\nThe suit is the first record of a new man in that part of Virginia,\n\n1. JOHN WOOLDRIDGE (ca.1678-1757), blacksmith, farmer, and founder of a long-lived and far spread family.\n\nEighteenth-century Virginia produced, besides statesmen and presidents, a vigorous population of such farmers. They and their families filled up the Piedmont, fought the Revolution, and furnished both inspiration and audience for a generation of republican political discourse. They were the yeoman of the Jeffersonian ideal. Where did they come from and where did they go? What made them different? These small farmers, perhaps 90% of the total, are familiar only in the aggregate (3) Looking at several generations of a single family adds the insight of concrete detail to tables and averages.\n\n(3) Thomas Jefferson Wertenbacker, THE PLANTERS OF COLONIAL VIRGINIA (princeton 1922), pp 53-55. Thomas Jefferson's own family originated in southside Henrico; the progress of the southside farmers provides a backdrop for his thinking.]\n\nJohn Wooldridge probably came to Virginia as a young man;\n\na headright was claimed for him by another member of the Kennon family years later, and the 1699 reference to wages, according to indenture suggests an artisan's contract for passage. (4)\n\nHe was thus part of, or at most a generation removed from, the high tide of immigration to the colony after 1650 (5) as a result of which thousands of former servants, their terms completed, faced life on their own in Virginia by the turn of the century. (6) While this background may have implied a family of middling stations in Britain, (7) in Virginia it meant starting from the bottom. But indented service or apprenticeship could be an opportunity: it apparently gave John a trade and a degree of literacy, and did not make him meek; he comes into the records demanding his due.\n\nWithout land, John plied his trade and saved his money. Not until March 1, 1712, when he was in his 30's did he buy his first 100 acres, from Bartholomew Stovall, for five shillings. (Henrico Deeds and Orders, 1710-14, p. 199, Va. State Library.) Before that, however, he was well set enough to marry, at about the age of 27. No record of his marriage survives, but the date is approximated from the dates of birth of the children beginning about 1705, the sons listed in apparent order in Wooldridge's will. His wife, Martha, (1688--after 1757), named in the will, may have been the daughter of Edward Osborne, whose 1696 will names daughter Martha. The couple's association with families like the Osbornes, Wards, and Branches points to a connection with people who had been resident much earlier in Virginia and who had already made places for themselves, although their original prominence was going into eclipse. In short, John Wooldridge seems to have made a good marriage, not into the local leadership but at least into solidly established clans.\n\nWooldridge was a blacksmith and had much to offer in his own right. Lamentations over the scarcity of blacksmiths and the high prices they exacted suggest a master of the trade would have no trouble making a living. Smithing in turn brought him in contact in a small way with coal, for that was the fuel used.\n\nA colony of Huguenots came to Virginia in 1700, taking up land at Manakin at the western fringe of settlement on the south side of the James River. In 1701 coal was found in the area, as the story goes by a Huguenot youth in search of a fowl he had brought down with his gun. He clambered into a brushy declivity and happened on the black rocks. William Byrd patented land including a \"cole mine\" within the grant of the French refugees in 1704, and Abraham Salle, a leader of the settlement, patented land by \"the cole it road\" in 1715. A contemporary wrote in about 1708 that the Manakin mine was \"us'd by the Smiths, for their Forges.\" If not already there, John Wooldridge soon joined the ranks of these \"Smiths.\" Perhaps attracted by the coal, looking westwardly, he patented two 400 acre tracts in 1725 (Patent Book 12:366, 370, Virginia State Library) close up to the boundaries of the Huguenot settlement, near the present Chesterfield-Powhatan border.\n\nCoal in the region preserved its early reputation for smithing, and perhaps a strategic location near good quality coal fostered Wooldridge's success. Certainly it was plentiful; on land he later held in the same area, wagon wheels turned it up in their ruts. There may have been a natural transition from the blacksmith's casual collection of coal for his fire to open pit mining of coal for sale. Johns son Robert was involved in one early commercial coal development: John Pankey advertised in the Virginia Gazette to sell pit coal from Robert Wooldridge's pits lying at Warwick on the James River (Virginia Gazette, Nov. 11, 1780). The business continued in the family until well into the nineteenth century. Except for William Byrd's activities, not a great deal is known abut the earliest commercial coal developments in Virginia, and the link between the blacksmith father of the early eighteenth century and the mine operator son of the late eighteenth is suggestive.\n\nAfter taking a few years to seat his new Manakin lands, Wooldridge sold his old 100 acre tract, \"land where Wooldridge lately dwelt,\" to Joseph Goode for 25 pounds in September 1729 (Henrico Deeds and Wills 1725-37, 1:246, VA State Library). The short move west brought closer connections to the Manakin Huguenots than Wooldridge was ready for. About 1732 his daughter Mary married Jacob Trabue, another at least occasional blacksmith who became interested in coal. Wooldridge objected. According to William Lacy, \"About the year '46 John Wooldridge Sr. sent for me to write his will and told me then, when Jacob Trabue married his daughter he was much dissatisfied with the match and he then made a resolve never to make Jacob Trabue the better for anything he was worth, but after he found Trabue to be a good husband he was sorry for his rash promise and had concluded to let his daughter have the use of a Negro girl named Hannah and her increase during his daughter's life and after her death to her son Joseph Trabue. (He said) I will make my grandson equal to my other sons in everything except land, and so I wrote his will.\" Another will was drawn in 1757, then changed by insertion. The changes made it questionable; it was finally order to be probated on May 5, 1759, after the Justices heard \"arguments of the counsel on both sides.\"\n\nThough not recorded in Chesterfield, the original will along\n\nwith related depositions by John Wooldridge (Jr.), John Roberts, William Lacy, and Agness Lacy age 19 are in the Chesterfield County loose or \"dead\" papers, now in the Virginia State Library in Richmond. it is dated April 20, 1757, and is witnessed by Agness, Elizabeth and William Lacy. The change may have been\n\noccasioned by the death of Joseph Trabue by 1757, and substitution of Joshua Trabue. John Wooldridge Sr. died between May 31 and Oct. 7, 1757 when his will was offered for probate. The order of depositions and the 1759 probate order are in Chesterfield OB 2:352, 364, 525\n\nThe real beneficiary was a lawyer, John Fleming, who entered in his fee book for October 1757 the sum of 10 shillings for advice on a will and in May 1759 the sum of 12 shillings sixpence for \"arguing the matter of Wooldridge will\" for Jacob Trabue.\n\nIn all, four of John's six children married Huguenots, and there followed other associations with the Huguenot outpost. John's youngest son Robert was godfather to his nephew William Trabue in 1739; about 1738 he had married Magdalene Salle, granddaughter of Abraham Salle. Edward Wooldridge married Mary Flournoy and was godfather to his nephew David Trabue in 1737; William married Sarah Flournoy and served as godfather to his niece Marie Trabue seven years later.\n\nIn 1736 Wooldridge bought 650 acres for 32 pounds 10 shillings, on the Buckingham road, seemingly adjoining his 1725 patent, from Henry Cary (of which 400 were given to his son Edward in 1753); in 1747 he patented 314 more acres, described as \"on the French line\" in his will.\n\nFrom this period if not earlier he and his sons were directing their energies to the sovereign weed tobacco. They worked their holdings personally. In 1736 John Sr. may have had two or three hands and John Jr., one, but William and Thomas had none. The initial capital could have come from smithing, and Wooldridge did not necessarily give up the trade altogether when he started farming; he bequeathed his blacksmith tools to his son William. Nevertheless, after1729 he no longer styled \"blacksmith,\" and by the time he died he was in the eyes of some \"Mr.\" Wooldridge, a more honorific title then than now. The family home was named \"Midlothian,\" perhaps (or perhaps not) In memory of a distant origin in lowland Scotland.\n\nThe movement from servant to artisan to planter bears witness to he opportunities in 18th century Virginia for people who started with nothing. Progress took time and longevity helped. Wooldridge was 33 before he owned his first acre and when the tax collector came in 1736, about 56 old, he owed quit rents on 800 acres owned by John Roberts, and John Wooldridge Jr. paid on 300 just purchased from Samuel Burton. Not until 1747, at the age of 69, did his holdings peak at 1764 acres, including 400 long in the possession of his son John.\n\nBut if progress was slow, it was attainable and probably commonplace. Success for a man of this epoch, to be sure, did not mean advancing from humble origins to a position of political leadership. Wooldridge did not rise socially in relation to his peers; they all rose together. The freedmen of 1700 became the yeoman of 1750, numerous, landed, and prosperous in relation to anything they had known before. Wooldridge's family in its beginnings in the latter half of the seventeenth century could not have been called prosperous, but everyone in it meets that description for most of the eighteenth century.\n\nMen who had, as they saw it, raised themselves from servitude to landed proprietors and established their sons on lands of their own may well have transmitted to their families a strong loyalty to the society in which they had succeeded. The Virginia economy was based on an agricultural laboring class which had made its way to prosperity by a half-century of tenacity and hard work. Such men are self-confident and resourceful. when England began to tighten the reins, she would find the Virginia yeoman, who might not seem to have much stake in the struggle, among the most refractory of the colonists. by then John Wooldridge was dead, but 16 of his 24 grandsons, including one* who had looked after him in the last years of his life and been rewarded with a 250 acre legacy, in one way or another took part on the side of the colonies, the majority in active service, and at least two more were too old for active service.\n\n*Richard Wooldridge appeared with the old man on a 1756 Chesterfield tithe list, Virginia State Library, and is remembered in his will.\n\nAs a militiaman in Lincoln County, Kentucky, he is on a 1782 payroll for an expedition against the Shannese Indians under George Rogers Clark.

William2 Wooldridge,Sr (John1) was born 1709 in Henrico County, Virginia, and died 1798 in Elbert County, Georgia. He married (1) Mary 1738. He married (2) Sarah Flournoy Abt. 1750 in Chesterfield Co., Va.. She was born Bet. 1730 - 1738 in Virginia, and died Bet. 1798 - 1799 in Elbert County, Georgia.\n\nNotes for William Wooldridge,Sr:\n\nWilliam was married #l, around 1738, name of this wife unknown.\n\nRichard Sr., was son of this union.\n\n#2 was Sarah Flournoy\n\nWilliam Wooldridge (1709-1798) was born in Henrico County, Virginia. He was apparently the second or third son of John and Martha Wooldridge of that county, and as his father's executor and legatee of his blacksmith's tools, he may have been the leader of the family after his father's death. he appears in the Henrico records from time to time in various ways but does not hold public office in the county. For example, at the April Court in 1743 together with John Wooldridge, Samuel Jordan and Jacob Trabue he was ordered to appraise the estate of Moses Ferguson, deceased.(90) The same year, \"On motion of William Wooldridge leave is given him to keep an ordinary at Samuel Jordan's home below the mount and Jordan enters himself as security.\" (91)\n\nWilliam may have started farming on his own on a 100 acres of John Roberts' on which William paid the tax in 1736. (92) (his son Richard married Jane Roberts). Then after a stint of keeping ordinary at Jordan's he patented 400 acres in Albemarle in 1748, receiving two years later 2000 acres in the same county, (93) in the part which became Buckingham. His fathers will left him 414 more acres in Chesterfield, and it is not known whether he ever lived in the Buckingham section, though a Samuel Jordan did.\n\n*90.

August 20, 1747. 400 acres on South branch of Slate River called Jones Creek. An April 8, 1749 grant to Patrick Obrian was of 1200 acres in Albemarle on the branches of Slate River adjoining Thomas Jones, William Wooldridge, and his own lines. EXECUTIVE JOURNALS OF THE COUNCIL OF COLONIAL VIRGINIA (Richmond, 1945), 5:282. The 2000 acres is from the same source, p. 341. Beginning at Stephen Saunders line on the south fork of Buck and Doe Creek, running up both Forks and thence across to the head of Jones Creek to the beginning. This was an area Henry (3) (Thomas (2) later owned land in. It is not clear how much of the 2000 acres William Wooldridge took up. On July 3, 1752, he patented for 30 shillings 300 acres in Albemarle on the north branches of Willis Creek near the head adjoining William Blackburn. patent book 31:121, Virginia State Library. The Albemarle County Surveyors Plat Book in the Virginia State Library shows the 300 acres (p. 189) and William Wooldridge is an adjoiner in surveys for Arthur Moseley and Thomas Turpin. The land fell in Buckingham and cannot be traced.\n\nWilliam Wooldridge had at least two wife's; the name of the first, whom he probably married in the late 1730's, is not known. his second wife, whom he seems to have married about 1750 in Chesterfield County, was Sarah Flournoy (94) of the noted Huguenot family of that name.\n\n*94. They named a daughter Sarah Flournoy. Mrs. Sarah Shipp Walker, Wooldridge notes, Virginia State Library, has pointed out that Francis Flournoy's will refers to his daughter Sarah only by her first name, but leaves her a slave, Rachel, who is subsequently named by William Wooldridge in his will. She also cites a 1761 deed of 200 acres from Frances Flournoy and Andrew LaPrade (his son-in-law) to William Wooldridge for very nominal consideration, suggesting the consideration flowed to LaPrade, and Flournoy's interest was a gift. William Wooldridge witnessed deeds for Francis Flournoy on June 18, 1765, to his sons Francis Flournoy, William Flournoy, Gibson Flournoy (William and Sarah Wooldridge named their first son Gibson) , Josiah Flournoy, James Flournoy and Jacob Flournoy.\n\nChesterfield DB 5:243-51.\n\nHe continued living on that land and adjoining his father and brothers in Chesterfield (95) after it was cut from Henrico, and was one of the fairly prosperous planters in that area, owning several hundred acres and some slaves. He appears on the 1756 Chesterfield County tithable list, charged with tax for himself, son William and slaves Frank and James. His oldest son Richard was, at that time, living with John Wooldridge Sr., William's father (96)\n\n*95.

Chesterfield County tithe list, Virginia State Library.\n\nSince William's two eldest sons were tithable in 1756, the eldest was born by 1738.\n\nAfter the year 1770 William and Sarah Wooldridge's family, then William and Sarah, decided to move South. while the reasons for the move is not clear as none of the rest of the Wooldridges left Virginia at this time -- in fact, William was the only one in the second generation to leave the immediate Chesterfield vicinity --- some of the Flournoys did, and perhaps Sarah wanted to go with her brothers to the new territory. beginning in 1771, they begin to show up in the records of Surry County, North Carolina, (97) though in 1777 William, Thomas and Edward are tithables in one household in Chesterfield and as late as 1778 he is called \"of Chesterfield\" when selling off his remaining land there. (98)\n\n*97. his eldest son, Richard, who as Richard Waldridge, 1 tithable, appears in Surry County in 1771,may have scouted the way. NORTH CAROLINA JOURNAL OF GENEALOGY 3(1957):344.\n\n*98. Manchester Parish, Chesterfield County tithe list, Virginia State Library. Chesterfield DB 8:274.\n\nWilliam, or his son William (3) shows in the Surry County deeds as buying and selling land; in 1777 he is on the venire from which the Grand Jury from the Salisbury District is chosen; the William Wooldridge in 1778 Captain of Militia in that district is probably his son, (99) but in any event the service in the Surry County Militia is considered service in the Revolutionary War. (100)\n\nThere was plenty for the militia to do because of the Tory element in western North Carolina. John Hudspeth, brother of William's daughter-in-law Lucy Hudspeth, was killed while serving as a tax collector in Surry (101)\n\nBy the early 1780's, William and part of his family moved on South to Elbert County, Georgia, where he again purchased land and became one of the prominent planters of the County. His land lay on Beaver dam Creek, and his sons Gibson and William owned land that adjoined him for part of the time. He lived in Elbert County for the remainder of his life, signing his will there on December 6, 1797, as a man in his eighties; it names his five sons, two daughters,and wife Sarah, and divides his estate among them, including 24 slaves, two of whom, Phebe (who was to be manumitted on Sarah's death) and Kate (or their namesakes) had been in the family for 35 years.\n\n(102) Sarah Wooldridge signed her will on February 24, 1804, and it was recorded on May 27, 1806. (103) Sarah's will names her three sons and one daughter, as well as the children of a deceased daughter.\n\n*99. Deeds of 1773, 1779, 1784, Surry County North Carolina DB A:73, 290; C:157.

Edward Mologe2 Wooldridge (John1) was born 1711 in Henrico County, Virginia, and died 1808 in Chesterfield Co., Va.. He married Mary Flournoy Abt. 1745. She was born 1713, and died 1808 in Chesterfield Co., Va..\n\nNotes for Edward Mologe Wooldridge:\n\nwill dated July 20, 1805. (proved Oct. 10, 1808)\n\nEdward Wooldridge was probably born in what is now Chesterfield County, Virginia; it was then Southside Henrico. (114) The estimated date of birth assumes he was of legal age when he patented land with his brother Thomas in Goochland in 1732. (115) On this estimate he lived to be 97, gthe oldest of a generation of notable longevity: his brother William reached 89 and brother John, 78.\n\nAn Edward \"Mologe\" (Wologe?) in the 1735 Goochland tithes may be this Edward.\n\nHe married Mary Flournoy, the daughter of Francis and Mary Flournoy and sister of Sarah Flournoy who married his brother William. The Flournoys were among the French Huguenots who came to Manakin. (116) The date of the marriage would be in the 1740's prior to July 29, 1749, when \"Francis Flournoy of Chesterfield County and parish of Dale\" deeded 200 acres in the Forks of Tomahawk in Chesterfield County to his \"beloved son-in-law Edward Wooldridge.\" Edward sold this land to Valentine Winfree a year later. (117)\n\nAltogether Edward owned at one time or another 1600 acres in Virginia and 2,000 in Kentucky, although he never moved to kentucky. (118)\n\nHe seemedcontent to live as a prosperous planter of his day, never holding public office as far as the records show. (119) His home was probably on a tract his fathergave him in 1753 (120) on the Buckingham Road about the location of the present town of Midlothian near the Powhatan line.\n\nIn January 1757 the Chesterfield County Court examined Edward Wooldridge for the \"supposed murder\" of Francis Brown. The circumstances of the alleged murder are not given, but the Court concluded he was not guilty and did not pass the case on to General Court for trial. (121)\n\nIn addition to being a planter of substance, Edward ws licensed in March 1756 to keep ordinary at his house. he paid a fee to attorney John Fleming for procuring the license. Thus three of the five brothers at one time or another kept ordinary, (122) though from their land dealings all seem to be primarily to have been tobacco planters.\n\nOn reaching his mid 60's Edward began to give land to his children. 230 acres to Edward Wooldridge Jr. and 240 acres to William Wooldridge in 1775 (both on the Buckingham Road in Chesterfield) and 140 acres to Simon Wooldridge in Prince Edward two years later. (123) On December 23, 1778, Edward conveyed a Negro boy Chjarles to his grandson Obed Hancock son of William Hancock for natural love and affection and five shillings. (124\n\nEdward Wooldridge obtained a grant of 1400 acres on the West Fork of Station Camp Creek in Madison County, Kentucky on May 10, 1793, and on August 9, 1798 he obtained two additional grants of 300 acres each at the same location. (125)\n\nOn march 29, 1799, he gave a power of attorney to Josiah Wooldridge, who may have been his son Josiah, and Elisha Wooldridge of Woodford County, Kentucky, who probably was the son of his brother Robert and husband of his daughter Hannah, to divide his Kentucky land into equal parts and deed one half to Green Clay in payment for locating (i.e. surveying) the land. (126)\n\nChesterfield Court discharged Edward Wooldridge from paying taxes on his own person because of age and infirmity in 1787. (127 He died at a very advanced age in September or October 1808. His wife Mary (Flournoy) Wooldridge is named in his will dated July 20, 1805, but had apparently died by the time the will was probated October 10, 1808. (128))\n\n*114. Wayne L.

Jacob's 1767 will gives his smith's tools to his son Daniel, and his son Joshua \"free liberty ofdiging Coles on the Land devised to son David during the term of ten yearsk\" so jacob like his fther-in-law had some earlhy interest in or at least awareness of the Midlothian coal deposits.

He married Magdalene Salle Abt. 1738 in VA. She was born 1718 in VA, and died August 1794 in Chesterfield Co., Va..\n\nNotes for Robert Wooldridge:\n\nRobert Wooldridge's birthday is estimated from his appearance as godfather for his nephew William Trabue (son of Jacob and Mary Wooldridge Traube) in 1739. He married Magdalene Salle, daughter of Abraham Salle, Jr., before 1744 when Magdalene Wooldridge served as godmother to their niece Marie Trabue. At the time of their marriage one neighbor remembered that, \"she (Magdalene) was called an old girl and said to be oler than her husband who was said to be 18 years old.\" But another person said he thought she was then under 21, \"for she was younger than he was, and he was then a young man living with his father.\"\n\nPerhaps the marriage occurred about 1738, as their first son Thomas was old enough to be bequeathed John Sr.'s \"wearing clothes\" in 1757. But apparently not yet tithable in 1756. (141) From the description of a bride of 20 as an \"old girl\" it is clear that marriage for girls of this time and class usually occurred before they were 21. On the other hand, the depositions also give the impression that Robert Wooldridge was unusually young, 17, 18 or 19 when he married.\n\nThough Robert was a younger son, his descendants were among the most prominent of the family to remain in Virginia, so perhaps the connections with the Salles proved fortunate, socially or hereditarily or both.\n\nHe bought no land until he was 36; (142) perhaps until then, as the youngest son, he stayed on to manage his father's home place, which he inherited. His name appears in the Chesterfield records of the 1760's (143) and on a 1777 tithe list of Manchester parish with five slaves. He or perhaps his son furnished service or supplies in Chesterfield in the Revolution. (144)\n\nAs noted earlier, Robert Wooldridge produced coal commercially for saleon the James at Warwick. The body of one Jehu Compton was found at the pits in 1786; an inquisition concluded that he died of drunkenness.\n\nRobert bequeathed \"my coal pitts\" in his will to his four sons, but \"In case anyonedisagrees concerning the said pitts and premises the coal pits to be set up to the highest bidder allowing 12 months of credit\" and the proceeds divided among the four. (145)\n\nLong before Robert's death in 1794, his son Thomas had become a Justice of the Chesterfield County Court. (146) The second generation, though prospering, did not hold office but prepared theway for some of the third to achieve more prominenceat the county level.\n\n*140. Brock, note 14, pp. 94, 101. Until 1987 evidence for the marriage was indirect: Abraham Salle named his eldest daughter Magdalene in his Feb. 1730/31 will. Henrico Deeds and Wills 1725-1737, 3:292. Robert's wife was Magdalene. Chesterfield DB 4, part 2:495. Salle papers descended in the Wooldridge family. \"Abraham Salle to George I, \"VMHB 334(1926):159. A grandson was Abraham Salle Wooldridge. In 1987, the suit of William Wooldridge vs Abraham Salle, Chesterfield OB 12:411 (1798) was noted. This led to the complaint, answer, and depositions in the suit, preserved in the Chesterfield County \"dead papers\" (March Court 1798, No.2, pt. 1, folder labeled Wooldridge v Salle) in the Virginia State Library; these suit papers establish the marriage. They give Magdalene's date of death as August 1794, three or four weeks after the death of her husband Robert Wooldridge. The deposition of Lewis Sublett, age 68, August 1797, has the \"old girl\" remark. The under 21 estimate is from the deposition of John Chastain in Bedford, Oxctoer 24, 1797. Elizabeth Lisuor deposed that Abraham Salle was 8 or 9 at the death of his father Abraham Salle (in Feb. 1730/1731). The deposition of Elizabeth Sublett refers to her father William Sally. The deposition of Maryan Clarke, Sept. 22, 1796, identifies her as a sister of Abraham Salle and refers to \"our sister Magdalene Wooldridge\"; and the deposition of John Godsey, age 71, 1797, says Robert Wooldridge was said to be 17 or 18 when he married Magdalene Salle, and Magdalene was thought to be older than Robert.\n\n*141. 1756 Chesterfield County tithe list, VA State Library, noted by Mrs. Sarah Shipp Walker.

She was born 1742 in VA, and died Bet. 1810 - 1820 in Green Co., Kentucky.\n\nNotes for Richard Wooldridge:\n\nThe following has been copied from draft of manuscript of WILLIAM WOOLDRIDGE, of Suffolk, VA. This draft is a continuation of his book (w. Mr. Gardiner) of JOHN WOOLDRIDGE, BLACKSMITH.\n\nRICHARD WOOLDRIDGE (John{1} William{2} b. probably in Chesterfield Co. VA ca. 1738, d Russell Co. KY March 1828, md. ca. 1764 Jane Roberts (d Adair? Co. KY 1810-20) daughter of John and Jane (Fourqurean) Roberts. He appears on a tithe list in Chesterfield County with his grandfather John Wooldridge in 1756, and his brother William was also tithable, so Richard was probably 18 by then. He witnessed Thomas Godsey's deed to William Smith in Chesterfield in 1761 (Benhamin B. Weisiger, Chesterfield Co. VA Deed Book #5 1764-68 (Rocky Ridge Press, 1990) p. 1.\n\nAs early as 1736, Richard's father, William Wooldridge, may have rented land from John Roberts in the part of Henrico which became Chesterfield. The families lived in the same vicinity. The Halifax Co. VA wills of both John Roberts (1774) and his wife Jane Roberts (1795) name their daughter Jane Wooldridge. Migrations left family members out of touch: Jane Roberts' will poignantly gives her daughter Jane Wooldridge 40 pounds specie and in case she is dead to be equally divided among her children. Jane C. Debenport, \"John Roberts 1707-1776 of Henrico and Halifax Cos. VA His Life and Some of His Descendants\" Temple TX, 1997 p. 35.\n\nRichard Wooldridge sold, for 127 pounds 10 shillings, 250 acres in Chesterfield on February 28, 1764, to his [uncle] Edward Wooldridge, part of a tract formerly the property of Henry Cary, Gent., deceased, bounded by Andrew Simpson, Francis Moseley, and the said Richard and Edward Wooldridge (Chesterfield DB 5:279-80, also in Benjamin B. Weisiger, Chesterfield Co. VA Deed Book #5 1764-68 (Rocky Ridge Press, 1990 p. 22). This would be the 250- acre bequest Richard had received from his grandfather John). His wife, not named, released her dower interest, showing that they were already married in early 1764.\n\nRichard may have led his father's family's emigration from Chesterfield to Surry Co. NC. Richard is the first to appear there, on a tithe list in 1771 (North Carolkina Taxpayers 1701-1786; 3 North Carolina Journal of Genealogy, p. 344. While William and his younger children eventually (early 1780's) moved on to Georgia and South Carolina, Richard headed west. He is on a 1777-78 tax list for Washington Co., the area of western North Carolina once known as Franklin which became eastern Tennessee. He paid taxes of 8 pounds 12 shillings and 42 pence on property worth 841 pounds, 11 shillings. Early East TN Taxpayers, p. 190. According to Claire Utt, he was a member of the first county court there, February 23, 1778. Apparently he continued to own land on Laurel Fork there even after moving on to Kentucky. Carter Co. TN was cut from Washington Co.. Later Carter Co. deeds refer to Richard Wooldridge adjacent to William Wilson (1796), and Benjamin Cuthbert Sr. and John McElyea (1800). {Mary McIver, Abstracts of the Deeds of Carter Co. TN 1796-1825 (1925), pp 5, 18.} Some of his children were born in North Carolina (i.e. western North Carolina or eastern Tennessee) 1777-81.\n\nRichard Wooldridge's name is on a 1782 Lincoln Co. KY militia payroll in Captain John Snoddy's company for an expedition agains the Shannese (Shawnee) Indians under George Rogers Clark. (Illinois Department Papers, Virginia State Library.) Lincoln Co. then included much of southern Kentucky, specifically , the territory from which Green, Adair, and Russell counties were formed. That is where Richard spent the latter part of his long life. he could have been in the same place as successive subdivisions put him in Green, Adair and Russell.\n\nSusan A. Henderson of Winnetka IL in 1999 compiled a great deal of information of Richard Wooldridge and his descendants. She cites Collins, \"History of Kentucky, vol. 1, p. 21, for the following synopsis of the expedition against the Shawnees:\n\nNov. 1782 -- Gen. George Rogers Clark with 1050 men -- one\n\ndivisionn under Col. John Floyd which rendezvoused at the\n\nFalls (near Louisville), and another under Col. Benjamin Logan\n\nat Bryan's Station uniting at the mouth of Licking -- marched\n\nrapidly up ther Miami River, 130 miles, destroyed, Nov. 10th\n\nthe principal Shawnee town, Laramie's store, and other towns.\n\nHenderson continues, \"In a deposition given by Richard Wooldridge on May 23, 1822, in connection with John Abney's suit to evict Andrew Barnett from land on Pitman Creek near Summersville (Abney v. Barnett, GC CC #5257), Tichard affirmed that he had moved to Pitman's Station in 1784:\n\nQ. When did you the deponent become first acquainted with\n\nPitman's Station and Sinking Creek?\n\nA. I think as well as I can recollect that we came down in the\n\nyear 1784 & William Vance told us that it had been\n\ncalled Crooked Creek but it was then called Pitman's\n\nCreek.\n\nQ. Did you the Deponent ever hear the name of said creek\n\nbefore you came to it in 1784?\n\nA. I do not recollect to have heard anything of it before the\n\ntime we were about to move down & then after\n\nwe came down William Vance said it had been\n\ncalled by the names of Crooked Creek, Sinking\n\nCreek & then Pitman's Creek\".\n\n(See also C.P. Cawthorn and N.L. Warnell, \"History of Pitman's Creek Church\" in \"Pioneer Baptist Church Records of South Central Kentucky and the Upper Cumberland of Tennessee 1799-1899 [1985] p. 205.\n\nIf he recalled the date correctly, this leaves it unclear where he was living from 1782-84. Moving \"down\" could mean down from central Kentucky, which is consistent with a source that says he was in Bardstown (Nelson County) prior to coming to [what became] Russell County (Russell Co. KY History and Families, Turner Publishing Co., Paducah, 1966, p. 345). He is on a July 2, 1787 tax list for Nelson Co. KY. He is on a list of Nelson Co. tithables taken by Robert Hodgen August 6, 1788 \"within the bounds of Captain William Barnet's Company, Green River on Pitman and Brush Creek.\" His daughter, Elizabeth, married there in 1790.\n\nSusanm Henderson's account proceeds, \"Richard Wooldridge appears on the tax list of Nelson Co. in 1789, prior to the formation of Green Co. in 1793 from Nelson and Lincoln Cos., and on the first tax list for Green Co. in 1795. A jury...awarded a judgment against Richard and in favor of Atkison Hill on May 14, 1794. However on the same day, a different jury awarded judgment in favor of his son, James Wooldridge and against William Skaggs. The subject matters of the two suits are not recorded, but odds are that they related to title to land (Green Co. Court of Quarter Sessions, p. 20).\n\nRichard Wooldridge sought leave to build a water grist mill on Greasy Creek in April 1799. [Green County, KY Minute Book 1792-1800, p. 117]\n\n\"Richard is listed on the tax rolls of Green Co. in 1800 and on the 1810 Green Co. census. His sons, Richard, James and William Wooldridge [and John Wooldridge], are each recorded as patenting 200 [\"second-rate\"] acres in Green Co. in 1799. Richard's patent (#1017) was for 'second-rate' land on the east side of Greasy Creek, next to Calverts. Jame's land (#1041) was on the 'Draft of Roaring Lilly,' a branch of Cumberland River. QWilliam's land (#818) was also on Greasy Creek, by Stapps. John's land (#901) was on Greasy Creek and adjoined James' land. (Randolph M. Smith, comp., \"Green Co. KY Land Entries 17965-1834 [1975], pp 79,96. Each of the plots was in a part of then-Green Co. which is now in Russell Co. KY.\n\n\"On January 20, 1802, Richard Wooldridge was given permission to erect a mill on his land (below Greasy Creek Bridge, per the Russell Co. book, p. 345). The jury that awarded damages of $9 in connection with the pond that would result, included William Wooldridge..., William Abbott (guardian of Gholson Wilson who married Richard's daughter Jenny later that year) (and others including James Stapp and Benjamin Stapp). Per Adair Co. Deed Book A, p. 398, on March 2, 1806, Richard Wooldridge 'of Adair Co.' promised to pay 400 pounds to sons James and John Wooldridge, pledging as security on the loan '200 acres on Gresy Creek and a grist mill on it, the place I now live on as taken up as headright land and 200 acres on Roaring Lilly as taken up as headright land,' \"one negro woman Hagor 60 and one negro man name Dave 25,\" and two mares, an 85 gallon still and miscellaneous personal property, signing with an X.\"\n\nIn 1797, his father, William, far off in Georgia, left Richard Wooldridge slaves Kate, Caesar and Phebe \"now in his possession.\" Like his fatherf, Richard lived to a tremendous age of the times, at least 90. Richard made his will in Russell Co. KY on March 4, 1828, and died in the next few days, as the will was probated March 17. It names all of his children in apparent order, giving the daughters' married names, and appoints son-in-law William Vance and son James Wooldridge as exercutors. According to Susan Henderson, his primary property was 200 acrs of land \"which included 3 or 4 good Mill Seats,\" valued at $400.50. His personl property (household goods and livestock) was sold at auction on June 16, 1828, for only $56.29 1/2. Russell Co.

These Wooldridges had come to the Skaggs settlement very early, being connected by marriage to them and to the Vance family.......\n\nVirginia turned the remainder of the military land over to the new state of Kentucky to sell at low prices to actual settlers. In 1796 Green County had a commission granting land to settlers. From the surveys resulting we see that RICHARD WOOLDRIDGE and his son WILLIAM had received 200 acres each on Greasy Creek, while James Wooldridge got his on land on Lily Creek.\n\nThe first County Court Order Book has been lost, but the second one shows \"April 14, 1799 Richard Wooldridge is allowed to build a grist mill on Greasy Creek.\" These Wooldridge men are the only ones known to be Russell County settlers who were on the first tax lists of Green County for the years 1795-96.....\"\n\nWill: signed March 4, 1828, probated April 21, 1828, Jamestown, Ky.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKY LAND GRANTS:\n\nGreen Co.

Richard Wooldridge deeded 200 acres on Greasy Creek to his son, Jesse Wooldridge. he also owned a grist mill on Lilly Creek. Greasy and Lilly Creeks are now located in Russell County. Russell County was formed from Adair, Cumberland and Wayne counties in 1826, and Adair had been formed from Green in 1802. so it seems that the Wooldridges stayed on Greasy Creek without moving from 1799 to Richard's death in 1828, when his will was probated in Russell County.
