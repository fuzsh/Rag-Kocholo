        "text": "These notes for GEORGE (R.?) DELONG, SR. were compiled by Karen Feisel, and are used with her permission. My hope is that her analysis will help others, and that somehow we can all come together to figure out Georgeâ€™s ancestors. When you are finished reading here, and want to go back to George DeLong's entry in the genealogy pages, click here.\n\nOther DeLong researchers have conjectured regarding the identity of George's father: (1) possibly James DeLong; (2) probably not of German descent; (3) possibly Scotch-Irish, an \"Ulster Man\"; (4) possibly connected to the Dutch DeLong family of New York state; (5) possibly connected to French Huguenots in the area of Kingston, Ulster Co., NY. Some researchers allege that George DeLong was born in Berks Co., PA, but there are MANY Delong families that show up in early Berks County records. John Baldwin, III - a noted DeLong researcher of many, many years states that, \"There is nothing which suggests this group (of DeLong's) was connected with the German DeLong family of Berks and Lehigh Counties, PA. These brothers and their children have names which are ethnically neutral, and none of these persons shows up in any of the Pennsylvania German church congregations, many of which kept extensive records. No records have been found in PA for any of this group until the militia records for 1777 for David, Isaac and probably Jonathan. In March 1778 George was called by the militia but did not serve, while (his brother) James was among those in arms against the United States (Tories) in August 1778. All but James (and Isaac who was deceased) appear extensively in following decades.\" Baldwin then adds that it's possible our clan of DeLongs might be connected with the Dutch DeLongs of New York state.\n\nA genealogy compilation titled \"Bernard Wintringer and His Descendants indicates that George DeLong, Sr., the father of John Francis, was born in 1750. (John Francis married Sarah Winterringer.)\n\nOne source indicates that George descended from French Huguenots with the name DeLang.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJohn Baldwin, a noted DeLong researcher, states that George DeLong, Sr. died late 1818 or in 1819 in which year his son John Delong and John Cline administered his estate. (His grave is unknown, but most researchers believe he was most likely buried on his farm.) Baldwin goes on to say that a quit claim deed of Dec. 1821 reads about the same as the 1822 deed next described (although A. Corfman inferred one of the sons and his wife were omitted). A Guernsey County deed of June 3, 1822 refers to the sale of certain property of lands whereby various children of George Delong sold these lands, to satisfy Military Services, to Ezekiel Emerson in connection with George DeLong, Sr.'s estate. The children were listed as follows:\n\n- John and Sarah of Guernsey Co. (signed Guernsey Co. Jan. 11, 1824)\n\n- James and wife Agnes of Guernsey Co. (signed Guernsey Co. 12/21/1822, her name recorded erroneously as Elizabeth. A statement of correction by Agnes was appended Nov. 1825 by Stephen Bullard, JP of Perry Co.)\n\n- Joseph and wife Elizabeth of Perry Co. (signed Perry Co. 12/21/1822)\n\n- Isaac and wife Agnes of Perry Co.\n\n- David and wife Jane of Perry Co. (signed Perry Co. 12/21/1822)\n\n- Edward and wife Rachel of Perry Co.\n\n- Ann Leeth of Fairfield Co. (signed Fairfield Co. 12/27/1823)\n\n- George and wife Mary of Floyd Co., KY (of KY, power of attorney, Perry Co., OH 11/29/1824)\n\n- Mary Davidson and husband Fleming Davidson, Ohio Co. VA (signed Ohio Co. 10/30/1822)\n\n- Elizabeth and David Hite of ___. One transcript says they were omitted, another says included. Researcher Corfman said they were included in the Dec. 1821 quit claim which preceded the 1822 deed, and that they signed in Perry Co., OH 11/17/1823.\n\n__________________________\n\nTHE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES GEORGE'S LOCATIONS PRIOR TO COMING TO OHIO\n\n__________________________\n\nThe \"History of Franklin County, Pennsylvania\" published by Warner, Beers & Co. in 1887, in a section about Fannett Township-1761 on pages 578-579, states that the greater part of this township was situated in what is known as Path Valley, in olden times called \"Tuscarora Path.\" The three valleys of the township - Path, Amberson's and Horse - by their beauty and fertility attracted immigrants who, with the consent of the Indians, with whom they maintained the most friendly relations for some time, located and commenced their life work. But in a short time so many people were migrating there that the Indians became alarmed and in 1744 they notified the colonial authorities that they objected to having their lands taken by the whites. In May 1750 the government expelled the settlers from the area. But when the land was purchased of the Indians on October 23, 1758 some of those settlers returned and again became residents of the area. The father-in-law of George DeLong, John Ward, settled there as early as 1757, along with Barnabas Clark from whom \"Clark's Knob\" receives its name.\n\nThe book also states on page 580 that George DeLong was on the List of Taxables for 1786 in Fannett Township, along with his father-in-law John Ward, and many men with the surname Campbell, and a Robert McCormick.\n\nThe book has a very nice map of Franklin County which Karen copied and has on file.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nA genealogy compilation available on the internet via Family Treemaker states that George enrolled Mar. 25, 1778 as a Private in the Eighth Class, First Company (Capt. Thomas Ashley or Askey), First Battalion, Cumberland County Militia, according to the evidence of the Fine Book of John Carothers, County Lieutenant, page 192. (However, paying the fine instead of actually serving in the military was considered a patriotic act, as the funds were used in support of the Revolution.) John Baldwin, another DeLong family researcher, states that George was called for active service in 1778, did not comply, was fined and remitted the fine, which is corroborated by a record that Carla Nash has from the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum commission dated Dec. 6, 1984 which reads:\n\n\"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\nThis is to certify that one GEOR. DELONG was called for active service as a Private in Captain Charles McClay's Company of the Eighth Class, First Battalion, Cumberland County Militia under an Order from Council dated 25 March 1778, did not comply and his fine was \"Remt.\" (remitted), according to the evidence of the Fine Book of John Carothers, County Lieutenant, page 192.\" (Karen Feisel has a copy of this record in her files.)\n\nAnother similar copy from the same source but dated Apr. 29, 1963 states:\n\n\"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\nThis is to certify that one GEOR DELONG was enrolled in 1778 as a Private in 8th Class, 1st Company, 1st Battalion, Cumberland County Militia, according to the evidence of the Fine Book of John Carothers, County Lieutenant, p. 192.\" (John Baldwin states that the R in GEOR was typed slightly above the line and was likely the cause of some people thinking that George's middle initial to be \"R\" but in fact was merely part of abbreviation of George. Baldwin goes on to say that he has edited his files to eliminate the middle initial \"R\" from George DeLong's name.)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn file at the Cumberland County, PA Historical Society in Carlisle, PA are several books called \"The Harry Foreman Collection\" by Harry E. Foreman. Quite a bit of information therein pertains to George R. DeLong, Sr. and to his father-in-law John Ward as well as others in these families. Note the following.\n\nWith regard to the \"Conococheague Headwaters of Amberson Valley\" -- \"John Ward claimed part of the McMichael land \" (land which lay on the east side of the creek against the Kittatinny Mountain) \"and became owner of part of it.\" (NOWADAYS THIS AREA IS IN FRANKLIN COUNTY, PA.) \"George DeLong, a Ward relative, sold part of this land to John Timmons in 1796, and John Timmons sold to John Taylor who secured a new warrant on his part in 1801. George DeLong was married to Elizabeth Ward daughter of John and Mary Ward. His name was included in the Hopewell Tax Lists of 1779 - 1781 - 1782 but was living in Amberson shortly after. He sold land to John Timmons in 1786 and witnessed the Adam Piper will in 1788. He removed to Bald Eagle Township, Mifflin now Centre County, where he lived when he and his wife signed releases to the Ward land. He removed to Ohio and died in Richland Township, Guernsey County. DeLong records state that seven sons of George DeLong served in the War of 1812 from Ohio. Some of these sons were born in Amberson Valley.\"\n\nThe collection provides a map of Amberson Valley as well as descriptions of it. The valley contains the extreme headwaters of the West Branch of the Conococheague Creek. \"Clark's Knob\" is shown on the map as well as a stream called \"Clark's Run\" and \"Conococheague Creek\". Also shown is \"Kittatinny Mountain\" which may sound familiar because the Pennsylvania Turnpike crosses that mountain. In fact the map shows the turnpike crossing from the southeast side of the valley to the northwest side of the valley. The stream called Clark's Run basically runs north and south through the center of the valley. \"Heckwelder, the Moravian Missionary, states that the Indian meaning of Conococheague is 'long indeed, very long indeed.' The writer has explored the Conococheague, for the greater part, from Fort McDowell at Markes to its source in upper Amberson; and therefore, realizes that the Indian interpretation is highly appropriate.\" The valley was named for Francis Amberson. The tanning industry was very extensive in the valley. Looking at a present-day map, the area discussed would be north of Chambersburg, PA.\n\nThis collection has many comments about the WARD family which will be found in the Notes section of WARD persons in this computer file.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following are notes from a DeLong compilation by noted DeLong researcher John Baldwin:\n\n- From 1779 - 1783: Another set of tax records shows a George Delong of Hopewell Twp., York Co., PA.\n\n- 1779: George Delong taxed in Hopewell Twp., York Co. - for one horse and one cow, value Â£15, no land. (PA Archives, Series III)\n\n- 1780: Taxed in Fannett Twp. on 100 acres, no animals. Taxed Hopewell Twp. on one horse and one cow, value Â£4, no land.\n\n- 1780: Taxed as Gerry Dewlong on 150 acres, Hopewell Twp., York County. Baldwin states that the \"History of York County\" shows Jerry Delong with 150 acres, value Â£155, eight inhabitants. He states that this fits George, Jane and their first six children \"which seems rather substantive evidence that the York County man was our subject and was living there in 1780.\"\n\n- 1781: Again 100 acres, no animals in Fannett Twp. And taxed in Hopewell Twp., no land or animals identified but with value of Â£1.5.0\n\n- 1781: Fannett Twp. 100 acres. Hopewell 150 acres, two horses, two cows, value Â£3.19.6\n\n- 1782: Fannett Twp. 100 acres; Hopewell Twp. 150 acres, two horses, two cows, value Â£3.19.6.\n\n- 1783: Taxed as Gerry Dewlong on 150 acres, Hopewell Twp.\n\n- 1784: Fannett Twp. became part of Franklin Twp. at its formation.\n\n- 1788: George DeLong, his father-in-law John Ward, and brother-in-law William Ward were witnesses to the will of James Brotherton of Guilford Twp., Franklin Co., PA. This same year George was a witness to the will of Adam Piper.\n\n- 1789: Baldwin states that about this time is when George moved north. His brothers David and Jonathan appear on the list of inhabitants when Upper Bald Eagle Twp. of Northumberland Co. became Bald Eagle Twp. of Mifflin Co. when it was formed Mar. 30, 1789. George was to be with them by the time of the 1790 census.\n\n- 1790: The census of Mifflin Co., PA shows George's family there, all ten children in the home. This was in the area that today would be HOWARD TWP., CENTRE COUNTY. In fact, the web site for Centre County genealogy states that \"the earliest settler was David DeLong, who located where the village of Howard now stands in 1778.\" (David was George's brother.) (A later reference by John D. Baldwin states that in 1790 George lived next to his brother David in Mifflin Co./Centre Co. The town of Howard, Centre Twp., Centre Co. was formed from Bald Eagle in 1798; it became part of the new Centre Co. in 1800, and later Howard Twp. was formed out of Centre Twp. The remainder of Bald Eagle is in today's Clinton County.)\n\n- 1791 & 1795: George was taxed in Bald Eagle Twp.\n\n- 1795 George and his wife \"of Mifflin County\" sold their inheritance rights to the estate of her father to William Ward of Fannet Twp. on Oct. 14, 1795 for Â£50. Elizabeth signed before a Justice of the Peace in Mifflin Co. on Dec. 11th.\n\n- 1796: In a Franklin Co. indenture, George and Elizabeth DeLong of Mifflin Co. sold land in Fannett Twp., Franklin Co. to John Timmons of Fannett. The land was two adjoining pieces, one by warrant right, the other by right of \"improvement\" - each about 50 acres in Amberson's Valley adjoining land of Edward ___?, Benjamin Seyor-?, William Ward and others. Witnesses were William Ward (her brother) and Edward Movity. (See more in 1799) (Also see notes on John Ward, Sr., George's father-in-law, regarding the specific location of this land.)\n\n- From 1797 - 1801: A deed book for this period in Centre County courthouse records a mortgage by George DeLong of Upper Bald Eagle to Christopher Helper of same location. It was also signed by Christian Bechdel. Bechdel's last will, proved in 1801, left to his wife a meadow cleared by George Delong.\n\n- 1799: By this time George and \"Jane\" were settled in Ohio Co., VA (today's West Virginia panhandle). An OHIO COUNTY record of Jan. 30, 1799 records the 1796 Franklin Co., PA indenture, identifies the two pieces of land as in Amberson's Valley, Fannett Twp. It indicates two adjacent pieces of property, one held by warrant (which must originally have been George's). The other was presumably Elizabeth's by inheritance; the record shows her 1796 relinquishment of right of dower, which seemingly was overlooked in the 1796 original, or at least in the transcript which reached Baldwin. Note, however, it supposedly said one piece by warrant, the other by right of \"improvement?\" which Baldwin suggests would be right of inheritance. Witnesses confirmed as William Ward and Edward Movity-?. (Another reading of this Ohio Co. record reported that Elizabeth's dower right was in Ohio Co., no doubt an error somewhere along the line.) Her signature in 1799 was before her brother William Ward, JP.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKaren Feisel located correspondence on file at the Mifflin Co. Historical Society which indicates that George DeLong was a resident taxpayer in Bald Eagle Twp. in 1791. At the Mifflin Co. courthouse an old Appearance Docket book shows a case dated June 15, 1792 involving George DeLong, evidently related to the collection of some money. Another docket entry for Nov. 1792 mentions David DeLong and George DeLong.\n\nOn Oct. 14, 1795 George and Elizabeth DeLong sold their inheritance rights to the estate of her father to William Ward of Fannett Twp. for 50 pounds. John Baldwin states that Elizabeth signed before a JP in Mifflin Co. on Dec. 11th. Her brothers Edward Ward of Mifflin Co. and Joseph Ward of Ohio Co., Virginia (now WV), also sold shares. The widow Mary Ward and her minor son John are mentioned. The property was two adjoining pieces of land in Fannett Twp., totalling about 152 acres. George Delong, Jr. marked as a witness to the Oct. 14 document (he was about 19). Thelma Palmer wrote \"Joseph Ward was the first to sign according to the JP of Washington Co.\" From this Baldwin assumes Joseph had the earliest recorded date of signing and that he crossed for convenience from Ohio Co., VA into Washington Co., PA to do so. Palmer added \"so where the six witnesses were is open to question -- I presume Franklin Co.\" (Likely George DeLong, Jr. would have signed in Mifflin Co.\n\nIn 1796 they sold land in Fannett Twp., Franklin Co., PA to John Timmons of Fannett Twp.\n\nAfter having lived in Cumberland Co. and Mifflin Co., PA - by 1799 they had settled in Ohio County, Virginia ( today West Virginia). It's possible that some of the property they owned was Elizabeth's by inheritance. Ohio Co., WV today encompasses a very small area and includes the city of Wheeling. The county originally consisted of the following present-day counties of Hancock, Brooke, Ohio, Marshall, Wetzel, Tyler, Doddridge, and Pleasants -- all situated along the Ohio River from the Wheeling area south to Parkersburg.\n\nThey moved to York Twp., Belmont Co., Ohio in 1802. (The traditional date of settlement in York Twp. was May 16, 1802, according to John Baldwin). Directly west of Wheeling, WV and Moundsville, WV is Belmond Co., OH. York Twp., Belmont Co., OH is almost due west of Moundsville. \"The \"History of Belmont and Jefferson Counties, Ohio\" by Caldwell, pg. 417, has a history of York Twp., Belmont Co. It was erected Nov. 25, 1801, as follows: \"to begin on the Ohio river at the southeast corner of the township of Pultney; thence with said township line west to the western boundary of the county; thence south with said western boundary six miles to the northwest corner of the seventh township; thence with said township line east to the Ohio river; thence up the river to the place of beginning, to be called and known by the township of York.\" In 1811 a portion of York was cut off for the establishment of Wayne Twp. In 1815 the northern part was taken off when Mead Twp. was made. Smith Township later took off some part of York as did Washington Township. York Township's present limits -- about five miles square -- is bounded by Mead Twp., the Ohio River, Washington Twp. and Monroe County to the south. \"York Twp. is watered by Captina creek ... The surface is hilly, but the soil rich and farms productive.\" Several Indian depredations took place in York Twp., most famous of which was the battle of Captina which occurred in 1794, in Section 8. Indian mounds have been found in York Twp. \"George DeLong settled May 16, 1802.\"\n\nPage 256 of \"Tombstone Inscriptions & Family Records of Belmont County, Ohio by Esther Powell talks about York Twp., Belmont Co. as follows: \"York Township erected in 1801 and was one of the original townships ..... This township was the scene for many Indian battles, including the Battle of Captina which occurred in 1794, in Sec. 8.\" Below that is a listing of \"First Settlers\" which includes in the list, \"Geo. DeLong 1802\".\n\nIn the \"History of Belmont and Jefferson Counties, Ohio\" by Caldwell, pg. 173, there is an article describing the first murder trial for Belmont County, held at St. Clairsville in April 1804. The grand jury was called and sworn on April 17th, with one of those jurors being George Delong. The grand jury presented an indictment against Peter Sunderland, Jr. for the murder of John Holtz, and then the jurors were discharged.\n\nOn record at Cambridge, Ohio is evidence that George purchased a farm in Muskingum Co., OH, exact date unknown, presumably in 1805. It was bought at the land office in Zanesville, OH and transferred to Cambridge after the forming of Guernsey Co. from part of Muskingum Co. in 1810.\n\nThe publication \"Sidelines Stories of Guernsey County, Ohio\" by the Guernsey Co. chapter of OGS, states on page 67 - which is about Wayne Township, Noble Co. - that the DeLong's came to that area in 1805 from Pennsylvania. (Karen Feisel found land records at Cambridge, OH stating that on September 14, 1807 George DeLong, whose residence at the time was Muskingum Co., purchased a piece of land located in Range Eight, Township Eight, Section Five. Today that land is situated in Wayne Twp., Noble Co., OH.) \"Sidelines Stories of Guernsey County, Ohio\" also mentions that James Law came in 1809 and was the father of 12 children; another early settler in Wayne Twp. was Robert Carpenter. The Carpenter and Law surnames are associated with people who married into our DeLong family.\n\nThe publication \"A Listing of Entrymen on Lands in Guernsey Co., Ohio\" shows a purchase of land by George in that area on Sept. 2, 1811 which was land located at Range 01, Township 01, Section 11, the Northwest 1/4 of the section, comprising 160 acres. Some researchers have been misinformed that it was in Section 02, but this official index clearly states Section 11. The land records state that at the time George purchased this land, his residence was in Belmont County. Today this farm lies in Noble County which was formed from a part of Guernsey Co. in 1851. Historical accounts state that George's old farm, one of the first ever owned by a white person in this part of Ohio, lies on the SOUTHWEST EDGE OF KENNONSBURG (see * below) in Wayne Twp., Noble Co., described as the northwest 1/4 section of Section 11, Twp. 1, Range 1, of Military Lands, OH. (See Indenture Deed described below as to when this land was later sold by George's children - which again clearly states Section 11.) Today this area lays on the northern side of Seneca Lake. To further support the fact that it was Section 11 is that Section 11 is southwest (*) of Kennonsburg, while the NW 1/4 of Section 02 would be northwest of Kennonsburg. PROBABLY SOME OF THIS CONFUSION MAY ALSO HAVE COME FROM THE FACT THAT A GEORGE SIMPSON DeLONG OWNED LAND IN RANGE 01, TWP. 01, SECTION 22 WHICH IS EVIDENCED BY DEED RECORDS SHOWING THAT IN 1839 HE CONVEYED LAND AT THAT LOCATION TO SIMPSON DeLONG. GEORGE SIMPSON DeLONG WAS OUR GEORGE'S GRANDSON.\n\nRegarding this property, John Baldwin states the following:\n\n\"On Sept. 2, 1811 he (George) purchased 160 acres of land, the NW quarter, Sec. 2 (THIS IS INCORRECT; IT SHOULD READ SEC. 11), Twp. 1, Range 1, unappropriated lands in the Military District, of the lands designated to be sold at Zanesville (re. Ohio State Auditor's office). The record says \"patent in file.\" The Auditor told Palmer that the patents were given to the individual. She thus asked whether Sept. 2 might be the patent date and not the purchase date. Her question is all the more interesting since a paper on George DeLong by Helen Hamilton of Lima, Ohio says he bought his farm, exact date unknown but presumably in 1805. Hamilton explains that this land was originally in Muskingum Co. but became part of Guernsey Co. when it was formed in 1810, and today is on the SW edge of Kennonsburg, Wayne Twp., Noble Co., which county was formed 1851.\" ---------- Again, there appear to be some errors in the conclusions reached or guessed at by Ms. Palmer/Mr. Baldwin.\n\nThe publication \"Sidelines Stories of Guernsey County, Ohio\" by the Guernsey Co. chapter of OGS, has a section on page 67 about \"The Seneca Lake Country.\" Some of the information it gives is as follows. For the first 40 years, until 1851, all of the Seneca lake country was in Guernsey county. When Noble County was formed in 1851 it was divided into 14 townships but eventually a 15th township was formed called Wayne Township. Wayne Township came from parts of Beaver Twp., Richland Twp. (which today is in Guernsey Co.), and so much of Wright Twp. in Guernsey Co. that it ceased to exist. The new Wayne Township has an awkward shape, having more than a dozen angles in its boundaries. Seneca Creek flowed diagonally across it from the southeast to the northwest. The residents of the township boasted that they had more bottom land and more fertile land than could be found in any other township of the county. An elevation that attracted attention was the Reeves hill, later known as the Ward hill. (Edward Ward, George's brother-in-law, migrated with George to Ohio.) Today this hill is almost surrounded by the water of Seneca Lake and may be seen from nearly every part of the lake. Page 67 states the following, \"The first of the Wards, who eventually added the Reeves land to that which they themselves entered, was Edward who came from Pennsylvania in 1807. Edward's grandson Edward Ward, Jr., son of John, was the first white child born in the Seneca lake country.\" So obviously Ward hill was named after the settler Edward Ward. In the early days of Wayne Township the game was plentiful, and it wasn't unusual for a bear to appear, as several stories describe on page 67.\n\nIn 1801 Cambridge, OH had but one cabin, and there were no cabins between Zanesville and Cambridge. The first white child born in what is now Guernsey County was Katherine Reasoner in the year 1805. The forests at this time contained oaks, elms, maples, cherry, sycamore, walnut, etc. Many of an enormous size covered most of the land. There were several Indian villages in this part of Ohio. The streams were teeming with fish. There was a bountiful supply of game such as black bear, wolves, panthers, deer, raccoon, rabbit, squirrel, turkey, quail, etc. The only road through this part of Ohio was the Zane Trail which was opened through what is now Guernsey County in 1798.\n\nGeorge DeLong was on the 1814 Tax List for Guernsey Co., OH.\n\nTHIS GEORGE or his SON GEORGE, or his GRANDSON GEORGE? - Land records show a Lease dated February 9, 1819 from the Trustees John DeLong, John Cline and William Edgar - \"trustees appointed according to law to take charge of the 16th Section in the 8th Township and 7th Range\" - to a George DeLong, for a 99-year period - which George signed \"with his mark\" - for the West Side of Lot #1 in Section 16, Township 8, Range 7 (which today is in Beaver Twp., Noble Co., OH). However, on Sept. 13, 1819, George assigned his rights to this land to Jacob Earick of Belmont Co., OH. (It is unknown at this time whether these transactions were by George DeLong the subject of these genealogy Notes, or by his son George who later died in Kentucky, or his grandson George. Perhaps this George intended to have his sons farm this leased land for him, but then he became ill.)\n\nAn Indenture Deed signed June 3, 1822 (after George DeLong's death) describes the sale of land by George's children and spouses to Ezekiel Emerson; the deed describes the land as \"in the County of Guernsey, State of Ohio ... being the North West Quarter of Section Eleven (or Roman numeral 2?) of Township One in Range One of the unappropriated lands in the Military District of the lands directed to be sold at Zanesville.\"\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nA family record prepared by Lucille Ellsberry indicates that George's religious affiliation was Roman Catholic.\n\nIt is believed that George DeLong died about 1820; his grave location is unknown, but it is likely - and most researchers believe - that he and his wife were both buried on his farm. After his death his farm was quit-claimed by his 10 children and sold to Ezekiel Emerson, Sr. and was in the NW 1/4 section of Section 11, Twp. 1, Range 1, of Military Lands. Information acquired from another descendant of George - Mrs. Pearl Gallagher Reischman of Barnesville, OH - also indicates that George was buried on his farm. She states the farm was next to and southwest of Kennonsburgh, OH (in present-day Wayne Twp., Noble County).\n\nGeorge's seven sons were said to have found in the War of 1812, but service for only five has been found. John Baldwin's compilation on this DeLong family states that Edward substituted for his brother Joseph's furlough which is confirmed by Edward's widow Rachel's application and approval for bounty land. Baldwin also states that George's son, George DeLong, Jr., is listed in \"Hardesty's Presidents, Statemen and Soldiers\" as having served in an Ohio regiment under Gen. Harrison, even though he lived in Kentucky.\n\nOn file at the Mifflin County Historical Society in Lewistown, PA is some 1985 correspondence from a Eugene B. Ward, age 78 or more, who writes about his \"GGP\" Edward Ward (\"GGP\" probably means Great-Grandparent). He states that Edward Ward's brother-in-law was George DeLong and says that Edward Ward and George DeLong bought land and sold it around 1800 and then migrated to the \"Ohio Country\" in 1807.\n\nThe website http://rememberus2.tripod.com/np61.htm gives the following information, cited as coming from \"The Compendium of American Genealogy 1600-1800, Vol. V Lineage Records, pg. 698. George DeLong \"(d ante 1821) said to have been a French Huguenot with wife and 10 children lived in Mifflin Co., PA 1790; removed to York Twp., Belmont Co., OH 1802. Road viewer 1811.\"\n\nGeorge and Elizabeth's son Edward eventually kept moving west until he settled in Iowa where many of his descendants remained in the vicinity of Beacon. A professional researcher located a biographical sketch regarding Edward and his family in Iowa. The first paragraph of that sketch is as follows: \"Three DeLong brothers sailed from France with DeLaFayette and came to the United States (year unknown). Two of the brothers were devoured by wild beasts, the other made a home in Pennsylvania, married and raised a family. Edward DeLong was a descendant.\" The author of the biographical sketch was Adah DeLong Hoit, but her information probably came from a family tradition of the story being passed down from person to person.
