        "text": "HISTORY OF BELMONT AND JEFFERSON COUNTIES - 225\n\ninvested the fortress on July 2nd, he abandoned it, for which act he was charged with cowardice, incapacity, &c. He was tried by a court-martial, but acquitted honorably. The facts were that the works were incomplete, and not capable of being defended against that force, and an attempt would have resulted in the loss of many of his men. He served until the close of the war with reputation.\n\nWhilst residing on his farm at Ligonier in 1785 he was elected a member of the Continental Congress, and chosen president of that august body in 1787. In 1789 he was appointed Governor of the Northwest Territory. He commanded an army which was sent against the Miami Indians, and was defeated near the Miami river, with heavy loss November, 1791. Ceased to be governor in the winter of 1802-3.\n\nThe following sketch of Gen. St. Clair is extracted from the notes of Judge Burnet, who was personally acquainted with him, and will be read with interest by the people :\n\n\"During the continuance of the first grade of that im perfect government of the territory he enjoyed the respect and confidence of every class of the people. He was plain and simple in his dress and equipage, open and frank in his manners, and accessible to persons of every rank. In these respects he exhibited a striking contrast with the secretary, Colonel Sargent, and that contrast, in some measure, increased his popularity, which he retained unimpaired till .after the commencement of the first session of the legislature. During that session he manifested a strong desire to enlarge his own powers and restrict those of the assembly, which was the more noticed, as he had opposed the usurpations of the legislative 'council, composed of himself, or in his absence the Secretary and the Judges of the General Court, and had taken an early opportunity of submitting his views on that subject to the General Assembly. * * * * *\n\n\"The effect of the construction he gave, of his own powers, may be seen in the fact that of the thirty bills passed by the two Houses during the first session and sent to him for his approval, he refused his assent to eleven, some of which were supposed to be of much importance. and all of them calculated, more or less, to advance the public interest. Some of them he rejected, because they related to the establishment of new counties; others, because he thought they were unnecessary or inexpedient. Thus more than a third of the fruits of the labor of that entire session was lost by the exercise of the arbitrary discretion of one man.\n\n\"This, and some other occurrences of a similar character, which were manifest deviations from his usual course, not easily accounted for, multiplied his opponents very rapidly and rendered it more difficult for his friends to defend and sustain him. They also created a state of bad feeling between the legislative and executive branches, and eventually terminated in his removal from office before the expiration of the territorial government.\n\nThe governor was unquestionably a man of superior tal, of extensive information, and of great uprightness of Purpose, as well as suavity of manners. His general course, though in the main correct, was in some respects injurious to his own popularity, but it was the result of an honest cxercise of his judgment. He not only believed that the power he claimed belonged legitimately to the executive, but was convinced that the manner in which he exercised it was imposed on him as a duty, by the ordinance, and was calculated to advance the best interests of the territory. * * * * *\n\n\"Soon after the governor was removed from office he returned to the Ligonier valley, poor, and destitute of means of subsistence ; and unfortunately, too much disabled by age and infirmity to embark in. any kind of active business. During his administration of the territorial government, he was induced to make himself personally liable for the purchase of a number of packhorses and other articles necessary to fit out an expedition against the Indians, to an amount of some two or three thousand dollars, which he was afterwards compelled to pay. Having no use for the money at the time, he did not present his claim to the government. After he was removed from office, he looked to that fund as his dependence for future subsistence ; and, under a full expectation of receiving it, he repaired to Washington City and presented his account to the proper officer of the treasury. To his utter surprise and disappointment it was rejected, on the mortifying ground, that, admitting it to have been originally correct. it was barred by the statute ; and that the time which had elapsed, afforded the highest presumption that it bad been settled, although no voucher or memorandum to that effect could be found in the department. To counteract the alleged presumption of payment, the original vouchers, showing the purchase, the purpose to which the property was applied and\n\n29—B. & J. Cos.\n\nthe payment of the money, were exhibited. It was, however, still insisted that as the transaction was an old one and had taken place before the burning of the war office in Philadelphia, the lapse of time furnished satisfactory evidence that the claim must have been settled and the vouchers destroyed in that conflagration.\n\nThe pride of the old veteran was deeply wounded by the ground on which his claim was refused, and he was induced, from that consideration, as well as by the pressure of poverty and want, to persevere in his efforts to maintain the justice and equity of his demand ; still hoping that presumption would give way to truth. For the purpose of getting rid of his solicitations, Congress passed an act purporting to be an act for his relief; but which merely removed the technical objection, founded on lapse of time, by authorizing a settlement of his demands, regardless of the limitation. This step seemed necessary to preserve their own character ; but it left the worn out veteran still at the mercy of the accounting officers of the department, from whom he had nothing to expect but disappointment. During the same session a bill was introduced into the House of Representatives granting him an annuity, which was rejected on the third reading by a vote of 48 to 50.\n\n\"After spending the principal part of two sessions in useless efforts, subsisting during the time on the bounty of his friends. he abandoned the pursuit in despair and returned to the Ligonier valley where he lived several years in the most abject poverty in the family of a widowed daughter as destitute as himself. At length Pennsylvania, his adopted state, from considerations of personal respect and gratitude for past services as well as from a laudable feeling of state pride, settled on him an annuity of three hundred dollars, which was soon after raised to six hundred and fifty dollars. That act of beneficence gave to the gallant old soldier a comfortable subsistence for the little remnant of his days which then remained. The honor resulting to the state from that step was very much enhanced by the fact that the individual on whom their bounty was bestowed, was a foreigner, and was known to be a warm opponent in politics to thereat majority of the legislature and their constituents.\n\n\"He lived, however, but a short time to enjoy the bounty. On the 31st of August, 1818, that venerable officer of the Revolution, after a long, brilliant and useful life, died of an injury occasioned by the running away of his horse, near Greensburgh, in the eighty-fourth year of his age.\"\n\nBUILT IN THE WOODS.\n\nAt the time Newell laid out the village of St. Clairsville, its site was covered with a dense forest. In a few years log buildings or cabins had sprung up like a mushroom. Immigrants came in on horseback and afoot. The trails were alive with pioneers bringing their small stores of household goods, packed on their beasts, . which made them appear as broad as long, and among stumps, trees and bushes, they spread out their goods and erected their habitations.\n\nFIRST PROPERTY HOLDERS.\n\nBelow is subjoined a list of the first owners of town lots in St. Clairsville, and the dates of their purchase.

By said act of incorporation the following officers were appointed :\n\nPresident—John Patterson.\n\nRecorder—Sterling Johnston.\n\nTrustees—Michael Groves, William Brown, John Brown and Josiah Dillon.\n\nCollector--Wm. Cougleton.\n\nTreasurer—James Caldwell.\n\nTown Marshal—Robert Griffeth.\n\nHow long this corporation was kept up is unknown ; but by dereliction of duty it died out, and perhaps, soon too, after the act passed. As time grew on and the town improved by the erection of frame and brick buildings, many of the log houses (for they were all log then) began to recede or diminish, the subject of incorporation commenced to be again agitated. A number of log hamlets which were unsafe from fire and otherwise, endangering .new ones built alongside of them, proved to be a great annoyance to the citizens. By having the village incorporated these could be removed. Accordingly on the 19th day of December, 1818, the following act of incorporation was effected :\n\nLETTERS OF INCORPORATION.\n\n\"Whereas the householders in the town of St. Clairsville, in the county of Belmont, having complied with the provisions of the act of the General Assembly, entitled 'An act to provide for the incorporation of towns ;' and having filed in the office of the Secretary of State, the documents required by the above recited act ; therefore,\n\n\" To all to whom these presents shall come.—Be it known, that the tract of land described in the following boundaries, beginning at a stake on the northwest corner of the commons of said town adjoining lands formerly of William Boggs (now Andrew White's out-lot); thence south 19 degrees east, fifty-eight poles to a stake on the southwest corner of the commons of said town ; and thence north 71½ degrees east, one hundred and eighty-one poles and six hundredths to a stake, a corner at the southeast corner of the commons of said town ; and thence 19 degrees west, fifty-eight poles to a stake at a corner on the north east corner of the commons of said town ; and thence south 74 degrees west, one hundred and eighty-one and six hundredths poles to the stake, the place of beginning. Also an addition to said town laid out by one Wm. Mathers, bounded as follows, to wit : Beginning for a corner at a stake on the southwest corner of the same, and on the south line of the commons of the town. plat herein first described, and thence south 19 degrees east, thirty-seven poles to a stake in the southwest corner of the commons of said addition ; ' and thence north 74 degrees east, forty-six and forty-two hundredths to a stake on the southeast corner of the said addition, and on the south line of the commons of the town plat herein first described, and thence south 74 degrees west, to the last place of beginning, as by the plat of said town and the addition thereto will more fully appear, and situate in the county of Belmont ; is hereby declared a town corporate and shall henceforth be distinguished by the name of St. Clairsville.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n\"In testimony whereof, and in conformity to law, I, Jeremiah McLene, Secretary of State, have caused these letters to be made patent, and have hereunto set my hand and affixed the seal of my office at Columbus, this 19th day of December, A. D. 1818.\n\n\"JEREMIAH McLENE.\"\n\n\"Owing to the length of the rules and regulations governing said town they are here omitted. The officers of town were president, recorder and trustees. These were empowered to appoint a town marshal, a collector and a treasurer.\n\nOFFICERS FOR 1879.\n\nMayor—H. M. Davies.\n\nClerk—R. R. Barrett.\n\nTreasuer—A. P. Blair.\n\nCouncilmen—Robert M. Eaton, Benjamin S. McBride, Cyrus H. Kirk, W. S, Kennon, John E. West and John Carlisle.\n\nMarshal—William Rice.\n\nDeputy Marshal—L. C. Neiswanger.\n\nEARLY MERCHANTS.\n\nJames Caldwell was the first person to open out a dry goods store in St. Clairsville. He came from Wheeling and started in the mercantile business in 1801. He erected a small cabin on the lot where Welday's bank now stands. He carried on the trade for a number of years and grew quite wealthy. Was the first president of the Belmont Bank of St. Clairsville in about 1816. Died about 1837.\n\nJohn Winters was the second party to engage in the store business. He commenced in 1802. These gentlemen were followed by James Barnes, in 1803; Peter Yarnald, John Patterson, and John Thompson, in 1806. Yarnald kept until 1813, when he sold out and removed from the village. The latter continued in the trade until 1824. Josiah Dillon kept in 1807. Samuel Sharp also started the same year. In 1813, Josiah Hedges started a store, and continued until 1819. He then sold out and removed to Seneca county, where, in 1821, he laid out the town of Tiffin, and named it in honor of the Hon. Edward Tiffin, of Ross county, president of the convention which formed the constitution of Ohio, and the first Governor of the State in 1803. John Carter & Co. opened out a store on the lot where the National hotel building now stands, along in 1806-7. Joseph Har- ris and Richard Freeman started stores in 1808. In 1819 Richard Charlesworth started in the dry goods business. He drove an extensive business in shipping produce to New Orleans, and dealt largely in furs and such like. He carried on the business for a number of years.\n\nHISTORY OF BELMONT AND JEFFERSON COUNTIES - 227\n\nFIRST TAVERN KEEPERS.\n\nJacob Holtz received the first license to keep a \"house of public entertainment\" in St. Clairsville, February 23d, 1802. He kept hotel until about 1806, when he removed into now Union township, and kept a tavern west of Morristown. On the 25th of May, (1802,) licenses were granted to John Thompson and Bazil Israel. James Barnes kept in 1803; the same year Wm. Gibson received a license to keep tavern. Michael Groves and Sterling Johnston in 1804; Andrew Moore, in 1805 ; Andrew Marshall in 1805; Absalom Martin, in 1807; Jacob Lease, in 1807, and John Brown, same year ; Zebulon Warner, in 1808, &e., &c.\n\nEARLY PHYSICIANS.\n\nThe first physician to begin the practice of medicine in the town was Dr. Herron. He located here in about 1804. It is said he cut the letter \"M\" out of the hand of Peter Sunderland, who had been branded by the sheriff for the murder of John Holtz. He was followed by Dr. Hughes, who practiced here a great many years. Dr. Quigley succeeded him, who remained until about 1822. He subsequently lost his eyesight, and died blind.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS VOCATIONS.\n\nIn 1803, Joseph Morrison began the manufacture of hats in St. Clairsville. A lively business was the hatter's trade in early days.\n\nRalph Heath was the first silversmith. He opened out a shop on Marietta street, continuing for a number of years.\n\nThe first tannery started was in 1803-4, by John Long. Smith & White started in 1808. Moses Morehead began, perhaps, a year earlier. Long's tannery was located in the southwest part of town, Smith and White's in the east end, and Morehead's in the southeast part of town.\n\nJohn Marchus carried on tailoring in St. Clairsville as early as 1803 of 4, and was the first man in that business in the town. He continued for a number of years.\n\nJoseph Patton started a shoe shop in 1801, and Henry Mitchell also began shoemaking near about the same time. These gentlemen were among the first.\n\nIra Robertson opened the first tin shop in 1806.\n\nSamuel Sullivan was a hatter. Ho started in the town in 1806. Had his shop where George Jepson now lives. His son, John Sullivan, was made the first president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (Ohio division).\n\nA man by the name of Jesse Magee opened out, it is believed, the first cabinet shop. He was followed by Joseph Marshall.\n\nJacob Leash, a Hessian, was the first barber who shaved and dressed hair in St. Clairsville.\n\nReese Branson was the earliest clock-maker in his section of the county, and the first Fn St. Clairsville, He located here as early as 1806. He also made buttons out of pewter, with brass ̊Yes. In that line he had quite a run. That was the style of buttons worn by the early settlers, and appropriately used with their linsey-woolsey habiliments.\n\nJohn Copeland was the first person to carry on blacksmithing. His shop was situated on or near the present site of Major Thompson's residence.\n\nRobert Dent was the first school, teacher in St. Clairsville. Ho was a member of the Methodist church.\n\nA Rev. Mr. Colderhead was the first itinerant minister in the village.\n\nIt is believed by a few persons now living, that Andrew Marshall was the earliest postmaster of St. Clairsville, and that he received his appointment from the second President of the United States, John Adams. In 1805-6, he took the contract to carry the mail, by wagon, from Wheeling to Lancaster. The mail prior to that time had been carried on horseback.\n\nThere was a horse-mill on the lot where afterwards was built the Friends' church. A stillhouse stood on the same lot. It was quite small—only having one still. Messrs. Josiah Dillon and John Thompson were the operators there for a short time. The distillery burnt down, and the land was sold by Thompson to Taylor, who sold part to the Friends, in 1807, for a church site.\n\nMichael Groves also had a distillery on the lot owned by Mr. King, in a very early day.\n\nST. CLAIRSVILLE IN 1808.\n\nFrom a letter written by a citizen of St. Clairsville to Mr. F. Cuming, dated December 30, 1808, the following is obtained:\n\nI-29--B & J. Cos.\n\n\"St. Clairsville, a post town, and seat of justice for Belmont county, was so called in honor of Gen. Arthur St. Clair, late governor of the Northwest territory ; was laid (in the woods) by David Newell in the year 1801, on the great western post road from the city of Washington to Chillicothe, then called Zane's road, and at that time was scarcely passable for wagons. It is pleasantly situated on a rising ground, eleven miles west from Wheeling, in Virginia, sixty-seven southwest of Pittsburgh, two hundred and eighty-five on the usual route and two hundred and thirty-four in a straight line from Baltimore and the city of Washington, and one hundred and fifty E. N. E. of Chillicothe. On the south side of Newell's plat and the Marietta road, is an additional part laid out by William Mathers, which, by an act of the legislature, was incorporated with Newell's plat on the 23d of January, 1807, by the name of St. Clairsville, and is governed by a president, recorder and five trustees, and a town marshal, with power to create inferior officers to execute their ordinances. There are seventy-nine dwelling houses and four hundred inhabitants. The houses, with the exception of three two-story dwellings and a one-story brick school house, are all wooden, principally two stories high, mostly weather-boarded and neatly painted, which gives the town a new and thriving appearance: On the most elevated spot, and near the centre of the town-plat, north side of Main street, in the public square, stands the court house and goal under the same roof, a strong log building of two stories high. Within seven miles of this place are seven grist mills, two of which make merchant work, eight saw mills, one oil mill, and two carding machines erecting. Our lands are rich and heavily timbered with walnut, sugar maple, poplar, (a tree of which in sight of this place is eight feet four inches in diameter) white oak, ash, hickory, &c., and peculiarly adapted to the growth of fruit trees. The last season a young tree, whose trunk was 11 inch thick, third years' transplanting, blossomed and had fifty-six apples ; but being too prolific, the tree died before the fruit came to perfection.\n\n\"The produce collected for the Atlantic ports, are flour (for the New Orleans market) hemp, flax, bees-wax, and in the fall of 1807, 12,000 weight of snake-rout, and 6,000 weight of ginseng (3,000 wt. of which being clarified) was sent from this place to the ports of Philadelphia and Baltimore.\n\n\"Inexhaustable coal banks surround this place in almost every direction, and coal is delivered here at 61 cents per bushel. Notwithstanding the variableness of the weather, there is perhaps no place in the western country that can boast of a greater share of uniform health. The diseases most prevalent are rheumatisms, and a species of bilious fever that prevails most in dry seasons. Few places perhaps can boast of a greater population since the time of first settlement. Here are horses of a tolerable breed, mostly from Virginia, cattle not excellent, sheep of good quality and fine fleeces.\n\n\"Here are two schools, five taverns, eight stores well assorted with goods, seven carpenters, three masons, two blacksmiths, two tanners or carriers, four cabinet makers, one brickmaker, two saddlers, one pottery, one tinner, two manufacturies of cut nails, two clock and watch makers, four shoemakers, three tailors, two turners in. wood, one spinning-wheel maker, (a very useful manufacture in a new country, and especially at this time when every family is a dollar the richer for every cent laid out in buying a spinning wheel, and pounds for every shilling's worth in home made garments,) one cart wright, two windsor chair makers, and one maker of split bottom chairs, two distilleries, one victualler, three physicians and two attorneys,\"\n\nEXTINCT CHURCH ASSOCIATIONS.\n\nImmediately opposite the present Methodist church stood the Episcopal church building; built 1822. The congregation becoming scattered it was used for some years by the Associate Reform church, and after that remained unoccupied; and about 1862 it fell down and the ground was sold.\n\nThe Associate Reform, now the United Presbyterian church building, was erected about 1833, on the south side of the town. In 1874 the building was removed and repaired, with modern improvements.\n\nThe Friends or Quakers, at one time numerous, have almost entirely disappeared. The meeting house .was taken down in 1875. It stood on the lot now owned by Col. Thompson. The building was erected in 1809-'10. A half acre of ground was purchased from a Mr. Taylor, of Steubenville, in 1807, by the Friends. Several years later they put up a church. Prior to holding services in their ,church they met at the house of Mr. William Mosley. His house stood on the present site of Mr. Sin-\n\n228 - HISTORY OF BELMONT AND JEFFERSON COUNTIES\n\nclair's residence. An old lady named Mitchell used to preach for them,\n\nINITIAL ATTORNEYS.\n\nThe first lawyer to locate in St. Clairsville was Jacob Nagle. lie, it is said, was a brilliant scholar and an excellent lawyer; but was addicted to strong drink to such an extent that his profession suffered thereby. He defended Peter Sunderland, the first person indicted in the Belmont county courts for murder, in 1804, and through his fine management and stirring eloquence induced a jury of twelve persons to bring in that singular verdict, (see early judiciary) thus saving his client from being hanged. He was followed by Charles Hammond, Moses Morehead, Col. George Paull, Daniel McElherron, Samuel Sprigg and others.\n\nSCHOOLS.\n\nMajor Thompson says : The first school house erected in or near St. Clairsville, stood on the property now owned by Mr. Benjamin Barkhurst. It was built of logs in regular cabin fashion, about 1802. The door of this cabin swung on wooden binges. What light reflected into the small room was transmitted through a solitary window of greased paper. The seats were made of split timber, with flat side up, resting on wooden pins and at such a height from the the floor that the teacher seldom ever was annoyed by shuffling of feet on the same. Wm. Fleeharty officiated as teacher. Books were not numerous in those days. One often supplied the whole school. The pupils, when called up to recite, stood in a row and the book from which they read was passed from the head of the class down, each reading such portion assigned them by their teacher.\n\nSchool was taught several years, when petty jealousies sprang up between the country and town, the forme' accusing their master of partiality. One night a party of the dissatisfied gathered at the cabin and completely demolished it, scarcely leaving one log on another. Thus ended the first school and building, so the historian has been informed.\n\nThe next school house was built at the west end of town along in 1803-4. It was a step farther on in improvement above the first. It is not positively known who taught there.\n\nAnother school was started in 1806-7, near the present residence of Mrs. Ferren, which, Major Thompson says, was conducted under the influence of the Presbyterian congregation and continued for a number of years.\n\nIn 1809, the Methodists, having by this time grown more numerous, in this place, started a school in a brick house on the southeast corner of the M. E. graveyard. This school was looked upon by some as an innovation. School was carried on here until about 1840. The first teacher who taught in this house was Prof. Dent. He was followed by Wm. Limberlake, Sterling; Johnston and Zadoc Masters. He taught in about 1822, and Join Taylor taught along in 1826-28; a Mr. Glasco in 1828-9 and W. Y. Ellis in about 1832, when others followed.\n\nIn 1822 or '3 Miss Ann Leech taught a school for several terms in a house which stood on the lot where is situated the residence now occupied by Jesse Burley.\n\nA school was carried on on the lot now owned by Miss Mehala Hutchison. William Sims taught here in 1824-5.\n\nThe building now used by the colored people was built for a school in 1830, and occupied as such for a number of years. Mr. G. W. Hoge tanght in this building several years and Miss Jane Edgerton taught here from 1855 to 1864.\n\nWilliam Nettleton, Gregg and White taught a school on the lot owned by Mrs. Armstrong.\n\nOn Samuel Taylor's lot, Marietta street, school was conducted for a number of years.\n\nDavid Moore taught the first graded school in St. Clairsville.\n\nPrior to June 1st, 1831, schools were mostly select. After this date a certain fund by the state was set apart for the support of common schools.\n\nIn 1868, the present large and elegant brick building was erected. It measures 74x77, three stories high, and cost $36,000 irrespective of ground. The first and second floors are occupied by the schools, The third floor is used as a hall by the Masonic Fraternity. The high school is on the second floor; Grammar, Intermediate, Secondary and Primary on the first floor. First faculty was composed of Prof. J. J. Burns, (the present Commissioner of Public Schools in the State,) Miss --. Egelson, Miss M. C. Ryan, Miss Rebecca Billingly, Miss A. Adams.\n\nThe teachers for 1879 are Prof. J. G. Black. Miss M. C. Ryan, Miss M. Davies, Miss M. Griffin and Miss A. Adams. This is an excellent corps, as well as those who preceded them in the new school building.\n\nFor many years St. Clairsville has been very fortunate in securing good teachers. Even from the introduction of the free school law its educational advantages have far surpassed many other towns of its size in the state.\n\nOLD SEMINARIES.\n\nThe building now owned and occupied by Dr. John Alexander was used for several years by Prof. F. S. Brooks as a Seminary, It was originally built for a residence by Dr. Thomas Carroll, a Quaker gentleman, who migrated from Columbiana county in about 1831. He engaged in the practice of medicine in this place a number of years. In 1841 he sold the building to Prof. F. S. Brooks, who converted it from a residence into a Seminary, and conducted it as such for a short time, but the school finally fell through for want of proper support.\n\nPrior to this Prof. Wilkinson had founded an Institute on the property now in the possession of Mr. John McClelland. He was succeeded by Brooks along about 1838. The latter bought the property and carried on a school for about a year, when the house took fire and was consumed, but he had it rebuilt.\n\nProf. Brooks undertook to carry on both schools. the one at the edge of town for gentlemen and the other for ladies. But, being disappointed in his attempt to establish such a school with pecuniary results to justify him, he failed, and the buildings were purchased by the above named gentlemen.\n\nIn 1836 the Methodists organized a Seminary in the eastern end of the old Masonic Hall. But this school, like the others, failed for want of proper support. There was also a common school taught in the west end of the same building at that time—both on the first floor.\n\nCOLORED SCHOOLS.\n\nFor a number of years St. Clairsville has kept up a separate school for the education of the colored children of the place. One of the old school buildings formerly used by the town is occupied by this school. A colored gentleman named West, has been the teacher for a couple of years.\n\nTHE UNION CEMETERY.\n\nThe Union Cemetery Association was organized April 29th: 1871. The trustees elected were George Brown, David Brown. William Chambers, George Jepson, Samuel M. Thompson, Honf R. E. Chambers, clerk. This cemetery is located about a hale mile north of St. Clairsville, and there is about fifteen acre enclosed in the lot. The site is a beautiful one, being on a elevated piece of ground. A portion of this lot was used for years by the Presbyterians and underneath its green, beautiful sod has been interred many of the early citizens. Hundreds people this city of the dead. Scarcely a family in St. Clairsville, but is linked to this sacred spot, where repose the remains of kindred and friends. Soon after the settlement in this vicinity the dead were interred in this ground. This place is being beautified more and more every year. The evergreens planted there by kind friends- above the resting place of those they loved will soon cast their shade over the walks which kindred frequent. Here may come the lover and find a retreat of quiet, weeping over the untimely fate of his betrothed and to deck her grave with flowers. Here let the father erect his monument to the memory of his noble child. Here let the profligate son catch the inspiration of repentance and virtue as he gazes on the last memorials of his pious parents. Here let a daughter revive a mother's image and endearment.\n\n\"While this place of weeping still\n\nIts lone memorial keeps\n\nWhilst on her name, 'midst woods and hills\n\nThe quiet sunshine keeps.\"\n\nHere a grateful public can pay their tribute to talent, learning and industry, devoted to the interest of mankind. As the eyes, that from this point, look mournfully upon the surrounding landscape, may they be favored, like Moses from the summit of Pisgah, with brighter visions of the promised rest in heaven.\n\nM. E. BURIAL GROUND.\n\nIn 1809 the trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church purchased from Josiah Hedges about one acre of ground for the\n\nHISTORY OF BELMONT AND JEFFERSON COUNTIES - 229\n\npurpose of using it for a burial place. When Mr. John Thompson came in possession of the land from which this parcel had been sold he donated a half acre joining it, to the Episcopalian brethren who used it until the society abandoned their church. Since it has been used entirely by the former society. Here rests the remains of several old revolutionary soldiers, the body of Genin and other noted persons of early days.\n\nTHE FRIENDS OR QUAKER'S GRAVEYARD.\n\nThis burying place lies immediately north of town and contains about half an acre. Perhaps the first interment took place here along in 1810-12. It is still used for burial purposes occasionally.\n\nOLD BUILDINGS.\n\nMajor Thompson says that the oldest building standing in town is the corner house opposite Shepherd Davis, wagon shop, and that the second one is back of Bumgarner s shop. The west end of Fink's tavern was the first shingle-roof house in town. He also says his father, John Thompson, built one amongst the first cabins in St. Clairsville, on the lot immediately east of Judge Kennon's residence, in 1800.\n\nHORSE MILLS AND DISTILLERIES.\n\nOn a lot near where the Friends' meeting-house stood was erected a horse-mill along in 1807-8. A small still house was also built on. the same lot in about that year. Josiah Dillon owned them. The mill was afterwards burned down. A man from Zanesville operated the still. Mr. John Thompson purchased this distillery, and continued distilling for several years. Michael Groves run a still house on the lot owned by king. Distilleries were quite numerous in those days. Major Thompson says, still houses could be found on nearly every other farm. In this connection can be related an old circumstance, which took place. in the days of one-horse distilleries. A Teuton came to town with a three-bushel bag of rye, hunting market for the same. As no one seemed inclined to buy, the fellow got provoked, and said : \"By jimminy ! If 1 can't sells him, 1 takes him home and makes him into viskey, den I eats him !\"\n\nEARLY MEMBERS OF THE BELMONT COUNTY BAR.\n\nCHARLES HAMMOND.—First among the names of the honored members of the bar of Belmont county, stands that of Charles Hammond, who afterward became a prominent lawyer of the state: He was a native of Maryland and a graduate of Washington College, Soon after quitting school be entered the law office and was a pupil under the celebrated Philip Doddridge.

M.\n\nITS ORGANIZATION—CHARTER MEMBERS AND FIRST OFFICIALS—EARLY LODGE ROOM—OLD HALL—HISTORY OF ITS PRESENT HALL— SHORT SKETCHES OF SOME OF ITS PRIMITIVE MEMBERS —PRESENT OFFICIALS.\n\nBelmont Lodge No. 16, of F. and A. M., was organized January 8, 1811, in the, Court House, by a dispensation from the Grand Worthy Lodge of Ohio, and on the 8th of January, 1812, a charter was granted them from that body, signed by Lewis Cass, Grand Master. This is the oldest lodge in the county.\n\nJames Kelse, Sr., Ezra Ellis, Benjamin Ruggles, Henry H. Evans, Moses Moorhead, Thomas Thompson, James Carrothers, Josiah Dillon and Joseph Patten, are the names appearing on its charter.\n\nThe following were its primitive officers :\n\nJames H. Kelse, Worshipful Priest.\n\nEzra Ellis, Senior Warden.\n\nBenjamin Ruggles, Junior Warden.\n\nThe first room occupied by this lodge for stated meetings was a small one in Michael Groves' hotel building, which is now owned by Mr. Fink. Here a few Masons met faithfully from time to time and grew slowly in numbers, notwithstanding the heavy pressure brought to bear by the anti-Masons. It was in this lodge that the germ of Masonry of Belmont county took root, and extended its branches to other towns, After meeting a number of years in their first hall, they removed to the large jury room on the second floor of the Court House. Major Thompson said they staid in this place until 1827, and then they took up their quarters in their new hall, which had in the meantime, been erected. This building was a neat two story brick 25x70 feet, and situated at the lower end of South Market street. The lower Morns were used for an academy and village school. In 1849, the hall took fire from a defective flue, and the entire building was consumed. All the lodge property, however, was secured.\n\nAfter this they removed again into the room formerly used by them in the Court House. A few years later the society purchased the house owned by Mr. Johnson, which stood on the east end of the lot now occupied by the elegant three story brick. This building was erected in 1869. The third floor is used for their hall, which is 33x84. In connection they have a banqueting room 18x30 feet, Since 1870 an annual reunion and banquet has been kept up by the lodge in this hall, for the Masons and their families.\n\nThe higher branches of Masonry which meet here are as follows :\n\nThe Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, No. 17, organized in 1827.\n\nThe Royal Select Masons, No. 54, organized in 1868.\n\nHope Commandery, No. 26, Knights Templar, established in 1871.\n\nThis lodge room is a pleasant and comfortable one. Its walls are decorated with the pictures of many of its early members, amongst which are found\n\nWILMETH JONES.\n\nHe migrated from Washington county, Pennsylvania, in about 1816, and was made a Mason in this lodge soon after his settlement. He attained to the degree of Royal Arch Mason. He held prominent places in this lodge, and was sent to the grand lodge as representative, in which body he filled important positions on committees. He died here in 1862, greatly esteemed by his acquaintances\n\nWM. B. HUBBARD.\n\nAs a Mason, William B. Hubbard acquired a national reputation. He was made a Mason in this lodge. He filled the different offices of the same with satisfaction to his brethren. In 1838 be removed to Columbus. Whilst residing there, he was appointed Grand Orator for the year 1842. In 1850 he was elected Grand Master of the state, which position he held for three successive years, with distinguished ability. Was elected the Most Eminent Grand Master of the General Encampment of the United States, serving in that capacity from 1847 to 1856. He died in Columbus, January 5, 1866.\n\nROBERT H. MILLER\n\nCame to St. Clairsville a young man, and succeeded Alexander Armstrong in the newspaper business. He was considered a bright Mason, a sensational writer and a good, citizen. He filled the office of clerk of the courts from 1846 to 1850. He died August 15, 1850, and his remains were interred in the \"Union Cemetery.\"\n\nMICHAEL RIDGERS\n\nResided at Uniontown, Wheeling township. He was a devoted Mason and a humanitarian. He often made the expression that he was \"devoted to his God and humanity.\" It was said he had a particular spot where he resorted for meditation. While here, one morning in deep reflection, he was impressed rather strangely that he ought to go to St. Clairsville. He had no rest until he started. As he entered the town he heard the cry of fire. A stable standing at the foot end of the lot where the National Hotel building stands, then owned by John Carter, was on fire. He hastened to the spot, and through his exertions prevented the fire from spreading, at the great peril of his life. All had forsaken the roof when he mounted it, called for water, and thereby saved the house; the stable was consumed. It was thought that had it not been for the bravery and exeition of this one man, the east end of St. Clairsville would have been destroyed. In his efforts to prevent the spreading of the flames his clothing was so soiled that a new suit was furnished him by the people, He returned to his home feeling that he had done a good day's work. This circumstance was often talked of for many years afterwards, referring to Ridgers with feelings of gratefulness. He subsequently removed to the far west.\n\nThe following named gentlemen are the officers for the present year (1879) :\n\nW. M.—J, F. Charlesworth.\n\nS. W.—Jesse Meyers.\n\nJ.

S. S. Baron, the regiment was soon fully equipped, Company E receiving ten additional stand of arms and equipments.\n\nFor thirteen months after its organization the company was forced to conduct its drills in open air, winter and summer, regardless of weather. It had its regular drills and good attendance as required by law. Its\n\nARMORY\n\nduring that time was a room 14x17 feet, in the second story of the court house.

CLAIRSVILLE.\n\nTHE ST, CLAIRSVILLE GAZETTE.—About the beginning of the year 1812 a paper called the Belmont Repository was started at St. Clairsville by Alexander Armstrong. The Repository had four columns to the page and was about one-fourth the present size of the Gazette. In 1818 we find the paper still under the management of Mr. Armstrong, but in August of that year its name was changed to the Belmont Journal. December 20, 1823, the name was again. changed—this time called the Western Post ; and Robert H. Miller became associated with Mr. Armstrong in the publication of the paper. The paper continued to be printed the same size and form as when started in 1812, and the subscription price was then, as it is now, two dollars a year. About the 1st of January, 1852, Mr. Armstrong . retired and R. H. Miller became sole editor and proprietor. About this time the name of the paper was changed again, and it became the St. Clairsville Gazette. The paper was also enlarged. at this time to five columns on each page. We have been unable to ascertain the exact time when the paper first became known as the Gazette, but we believe that Mr. Miller gave it that name upon assuming control in January, 1825. The oldest copy of the Gazette which we have been able to obtain is dated August 27th, 1825. This and other reasons lead us to believe that the paper was first called the Gazette about the beginning of that year. Mr.. Miller continued .to publish the paper until January, 1829, when George W. Manypenny became associated with him. On January 23d, 1830, the Gazette was enlarged to a six column paper. It was then the only Democratic paper published in. the Congressional district, and the only one in any of the river counties from Marietta to Steubenville. August. 27th, 1830, Miller & Manypanny dissolved partnership, Mr. Miller retiring, and Mr. Manypenny continuing the publication of the paper until March 9th, 1833, when it was sold to Messrs. John Y. and Jacob Glessner. Sometime in the year 1837 the Glessners sold out to Maj. John Irons. March 10th, 1838, the Gazette passed into the hands of Dr. John Dunham, whose editorial connection With it lasted twelve years, ending March 15th, 1850. February 23d, 1839, Dr. Dunham enlarged the Gazette and made it seven columns to the page.\n\nFrom February 23, 1839, to June 25, 1841, the paper was printed by Gill, Heaton & Co., and from the latter date to February 26, 1847, by Heaton & Gressinger. During all this time, however, Dr. Dunham had editorial control of the Gazette. In February, 1847, Dr. Dunham purchased a printing office of his own,. and on the 26th of that month he became both editor and publisher of the paper. From March 1, 1847, to March 2, 1849, Alexander Patton was assistant editor. February 26, 1847, Messrs. John H. Heaton and Stephen Gressinger began the publication of another Democratic paper in St. Clairsville, called The Citizen. This paper was published two years and then (March 2, 1849) it was merged with the Gazette, the consolidated paper being called the Gazette and Citizen. Mr. Heaton retired at the time of the consolidation, and Dunham & Gressinger continued in charge of the paper until March 15, 1850, at which time Dr. Dunham severed his connection with it. Stephen Gressinger was editor and publisher then until February 21, 1856, when he retired and was succeeded by John H. Heaton, January 2, 1862. The name of Citizen was dropped and the paper again became known as the St. Clairsville Gazette, which name it has retained to the present time. February 13, 1862, Mr. Heaton sold the paper to Mr. Gressinger, who conducted it for two years, and then, on February 11, 1864, Mr. Heaton purchased it again from Mr. Gressinger. Mr. Heaton then conducted the Gazette to the time of his death, August 23, 1873. Mr. S. Gressinger was then employed to manage the paper, which he did until it came into the hands of the present proprietor. November 1, 1873, the Gazette was transferred to the present editor and proprietor, Mr. C. N. Gaumer, (formerly connected with the Zanesville Signal as editor) in whose possession it has since. remained. Of the former editors and publishers of the Gazette, all are dead except. Col. G. W. Manypenny, who is now a prominent citizen of Columbus ;John Y. Glessner now the veteran editor of the Mansfield, Shield & Banner; Jacob\n\n30—B. & J. Cos.\n\nGlessner, senior proprietor of the Zanesville paper mill, and Stephen Gressinger, of Bellaire.\n\nThe Gazette, or rather the Belmont Repository, by which name it was first known, was, 80 far as can be ascertained, the first newspaper established in Belmont county. It is one of the oldest and most widely known papers in the State. The Gazette is and has always been, the recognized Democratic journal of the county. As the organ of Belmont Democracy it has done efficient service for its party, and occupies a high place among the political newspapers of the State. Some. of its editors have been among the noted politicians of Ohio.\n\nThe Gazette was enlarged on the 21st of November, 1877, to its present dimensioms—eight columns to the page. The paper is in a flourishing condition, and gives entire satisfaction to the political party with which it is identified.\n\nST. CLAIRSVILLE CHRONICLE.—The publishers of. this work express regret at their inability to obtain an appropriate historical sketch of this excellent journal at the time these pages are printed. We depended upon its editor to furnish us the necessary data, but he was unable to do so within the time, allotted after we called upon him for it. By a reference to the Ohio Statistical Report for 1877, we find that the paper was established as early as 1813. It was therefore among the. pioneer newspapers of eastern Ohio. In its career, a number of men have presided over its editorial columns, who have become prominent in the state and nation. Would that we could give a chronological list of them here. The Chronicle is the recognized Republican organ of Belmont county. Its present proprietor, W. A. Runt, Esq., is a gentleman of ability and high standing, and the paper fully meets the expectation. and requirements of its numerous patrons. It is an eight-column paper, and has a circulation of about 1600 copies.\n\nECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY.\n\nPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.\n\nBY REV. ROBERT ALEXANDER.\n\nThe first settlements were made in this region by a people who came from the southern and western parts of Pennsylvania, from Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, to seek homes for themselves and their children. They were a vigorous and energetic people of Scotch-Irish descent. It was the same element which in the beginning of the last century planted Presbyterianism on this continent.. Though they had' come into the wilderness and where living in rude and uncomfortable cabins, they were not the people to leave their religion behind them and lapse into a state of barbarism. No sooner had they found a home for themselves in the midst of the forest than they took measures to have a house for God. They felt that religion could not exist among them, apart from the public ordinances, and they determined that they would have a preached Gospel and Christian ordi nances dispensed among them. To see the spirit of the people and their zeal for God, we only need to learn that in the first year after the earliest settlement was made here a church was organized by the Presbytery of Ohio and called Richland. Of the number and names of those who entered into that organization we have no record, except that David McWilliams, William McWilliams and James McConnell were chosen to the office of Ruling Elder. This took place in the fall of 1798, about the same time that the church of Mt. Pleasant was organized under the name of Short Creek. Tradition tells us that Dr. McMillan, the pioneer minister of western Pennsylvania, assisted at the organization of one or both of these churches. Brought into existence in the same year, these two congregations have the honor of being the first Presbyterian churches planted in all eastern Ohm.\n\nThe first place of worship of this congregation in its infancy was a log cabin, which stood near the Presbyterian cemetery, half a mile north of St. Clairsville. It is probable that this was built about the time of the organization of the church in 1798. It was a rude structure, yet it corresponded in the main. with the dwellings of those who worshipped in it, and no doubt cost them as much labor and sacrifice in proportion to their ability as many an elegant church has cost a wealthy people. Money was then scarce, and, had there been convenient markets, there was nothing to sell until the land was cleared and the crops had\n\n234 - HISTORY OF BELMONT AND JEFFERSON COUNTIES.\n\ngrown; and at that day there was no excellent Board of Church Erection to assist feeble congregations on the frontier. They were compelled to rely on themselves and put up such a house as they could. It was soon insufficient for the accommodation of the people, especially on communion occasions, and they were accustomed to hold their services in the open air in a pleasant grove near by. Precious seasons were there enjoyed when thousands would come together from all the region around, some from a distance of twenty or thirty miles to attend the communion services. These strangers were entertained by the families of the congregation, and, as their accommodations were limited, a great part of the night would be spent in prayer and praise. Thus social intercourse was promoted, and \" they that /eared the Lord spake often one to another.\" That first cabin church gave place to a larger and more comfortable log building, erected on the same spot in 1808. It was a double log house, with a recess in the middle of each side, in one of which was the pulpit. This was a great improvement on the other, for, as the country was improving rapidly, the determination of the people seemed to be that God's house should be as good if not better than their own. A valuable piece of ground had been offered to the congregation if they would build in the town, which was then rising in importance as the county seat; but the offer was declined, as the people were attached to the original site near their place of burial, and also as they feared the contaminating influence of the town, and regarded it as an unsuitable place for a house of worship.\n\nIn that second house the congregation met and held their religious services till 1822, when a commodious brick church was erected within the limits of the town, at the west end. This change of location created some dissatisfaction among the people at the time, but did not prove a serious hindrance to the prosperity of the church. The building cost about three thousand dollars, a large sum at that day, and was used as a place of worship for nearly twenty years. The congregation for nearly thirty years had borne the name of \"Richland,\" but, on the 19th of January, 1827, it was incorporated under the name of \"The First Presbyterian Church of St. Clairsville,\" with William Bell, Andrew P. flapper and Dr. John McCracken as the first Trustees.\n\nThis third house was totally destroyed by fire on the 15th of October, 1841; but the congregation, instead of being paralyzed and discouraged, held a meeting on the day following and resolved to proceed at once. to build again. The necessary arrangements were made, a new site chosen, and in the spring of 1843 the present building was finished at an expense of seven thousand dollars.\n\nWe have now reviewed the progress of the congregation in their local habitation, the place where their religion took an outward form and the ordinances of God were enjoyed by them. As it is impossible to maintain long the spirit of religion without its outward form, an interesting part of the history of every church is an account of the very meeting place between them and their God; Where He displays his grace and unveils His glory, and where they manifest their devotion and worship before Him. Some of the dearest associations of Christians are often connected with the place where they have heard the Gospel and sat at the Lord's table. Many will never forget either on earth or in heaven the sacred spot where they gave themselves to the Savior. Dear as the place of birth or childhood may be, it is not so dear as the place where the soul is born to God. Even \"the Lord shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there.\"\n\nBut let us now return to the beginning of our history as an organization, and take a glance at those who composed this church and at those from whose lips they have heard the Gospel. In the midst of their trials and privations, the pioneers of this neighborhood, after seeking an organization, were not contented without one to break to them regularly the bread of life. In the winter of 1799 a call was made out for the pastoral services of Rev. Joseph Anderson, who had been supplying this place and Short Creek (Mount Pleasant) for some time. The joint call was placed before the Presbytery of Ohio on the 15th of April, 1800, and Mr. Anderson was installed August 20th of the same year. He had been licensed by the Presbytery of Ohio, October 17th, 1798, and was ordained by the same Presbytery previous to his installation over these churches. His ordination took place, it is said, under a large tree on the farm of the late Clark Mitchell, near Mount Pleasant, and the honor was his of being the first Presbyterian minister ordained west of the Ohio.\n\nMr. Anderson was a man of zeal and true piety, sound in the faith and abundant in labors, of good presence and address, but of moderate abilities. After serving both churches for many years, he was called for the whole of his time to this place; though he continued to supply Mount Pleasant for some years afterward. In October, 1830, he was dismissed from the pastoral charge here at his own request. He still continued to reside for some time on his farm, one mile north of St. Clairsville (now owned by Mr. Rankin), and in the year 1835 was dismissed to the Presbytery of St. Charles, in Missouri. There he preached for a time, and continued to reside till his death, which occurred in Monticello, Mo., in 1847, in the eightieth year of his age. During his ministry here much good was accomplished, especially in the former part of it. He labored among a people of piety, who had been trained in the sound principles of Presbyterianism. They were men of prayer, and strong in the faith.\n\nIn the thirty yeais of Mr. Anderson's ministry here, the following persons were connected with the Session : David McWilliams, Wm. McWilliams, James McConnell, Wm. Ramage, Arthur Irwin, Robert Laughlin, John Perry, Matthew Anderson, John Marquis, Robert Bell, Wm. Faris, Sr., Robert Morrison, Humphrey Alexander, George Anderson, John Rankin, Andrew \"P. Rapper, Franklin Bell, John. Culbertson, Jos, Lauglin, and Andrew Work. Besides these, as men who were prominent in the early membership of the church, though not in the Eldership, may be mentioned the names of Wm. Bell, Wm. Boggs, Wm. Faris, Mr., Alexander McConnell, Michael Grove, Joshua Anderson, Wm. Mathers, David Hutchison, Samuel Mutchmore, Samuel Robinson, Win. Robinson, Joseph Marshall, Samuel Crawford, David Rusk, and Allen Stewart. The names of Judge Patterson and Wm. Templeton may be mentioned also as among those who supported the Gospel and took a deep interest in the church in its early history, though not in the communion of it. They were both afterward leading men in the Associate Reformed church, which was organized here ir. 1832. These were all men of integrity and honor as citizens, and consistent and devoted friends of Christ and his cause.\n\nAfter the resignation of Mr. Anderson, the Rev. Alexander Logan supplied the pulpit for one year, and for three years following the Rev. Wm. Fuller and others supplied it for short periods. Things seemed to be in an unsettled state, till in July, 1834, a call was made for the Rev, Joseph Smith, and he became pastor in October of that year. Mr. Smith was a son of Rev. David Smith, and grandson of Rev. Dr. Power, who were both among the pioneer ministers in Western Pennsylvania. 110 was educated at Jefferson College, and licensed to preach the Gospel, April, 1819, After three years of Missionary labor in Virginia, he was ordained April 22d, 1822, and became pastor at Staunton, Va., and Frederick, Md., previous to coming here. His pastorate here was short but pleasant and successful. A revival of great power occurred during his ministry. A protracted meeting had been held in the begining of 1836, and God's Spirit was poured out in a wonderful manner. The church was revived, old stumbling blocks were taken out of the way, and a serious division which had existed in the church for years, was effectually healed. There were also added to the church, on the 12th of March following, fifty-nine persons, many of whom were baptized, showing the aggressive character of the work. Hitherto the church had received her increase of membership from her own children ; now a movement was made upon the _world, and the aged as well as the young were made to yield as trophies of redeeming grace. Permanent fruits followed, as they always do, a genuine work of grace, and many have died in the triumphs of faith, while others still live, and daily show the reality of their conversion. It is said that only one of all that number received to the church, dishonored his profession. Two entered in the ministry and did good service for Christ in their lifetime—Rev. J. P. Caldwell, of the Presbytery of St. Clairsville, and Rev. Ebenezer Henry of the Presbytery of Oxford. This revival was much talked of over the country, and the addition to the church was the largest that had been made to any Presbyterian church in this region.\n\nMr. Smith was dismissed October, 1837, after a pastorate of three years, to become President of Franklin College. After two years in that position, he was called a second time to Frederick, Md., and then to Elliott's Mills. For five years he served as Agent of the Board of Domestic Missions, then settled at Round Hill and Elizabeth, and finally at Greensburg, Pa., in 1856. Ten years after that be resigned, and rested from a ministry of forty-seven years, till death released him from all earthly labors, December 4th, 1868. Dr. Smith was greatly blessed in his ministry wherever he went. He was instrumental in bringing into the church five hundred souls. He Was a devoted man, an excellent, impressive and earnest preacher, and a model\n\nHISTORY OF BETMONT AND JEFFERSON COUNTIES - 235\n\nChristian gentleman. The \"History of Jefferson College\" and \"Old Redstone- are the literary productions of his pen.\n\nAfter Dr. Smith was dismissed in 1837, the pulpit was supplied occasionally for two years by Revs. Thomas J. Gordon, Jas. Kerr, John McCluskey, Wm. R. Work and others. The last named minister, now of Philadelphia, received his first call from this church, but declined it, and in October, 1839, a call was made for the service of the Rev. James Alexander, which he accepted, and soon after commenced his labors in this place.\n\nHe was born near Mercer, Pa., in 1798 ; graduated at Jefferson College in 1826; studied Theology under the Rev. Samuel Tait, his pastor, and was licensed to preach the Gospel on the 9th of April, 1828. In October of that year he was ordained and installed pastor of Salem, Greenville and Big Bend, in the Presbytery of Blairsville, where he labored successfully for six years, and received to these churches one hundred members on examination, In 1834 he was called to Hopewell, in the Presbytery of Ohio, where he labored till 1839, when he came here. During his pastorate here, there were many difficulties to contend with. The house of worship was destroyed by fire, and great financial embarrassment fell upon the congregation in their attempt to repair their loss. Nothing is more dangerous to the spiritual growth of a people than the incumbrance of a heavy church debt. They will never prosper while they are contented to lie under it, and not make a vigorous and persevering effort to throw it off. Until the new church was completed, the congregation worshipped in the Court House, and as the place was not well arranged for reading sermons, the preacher was compelled by force of circumstances to abandon the use of notes, and thus, as he has said, was \"saved from reading, as by fire.\" Resigning his charge in June, 1846—his farewell sermon being preached from Phil. 4: 8—he was settled at Martin's Ferry, in this county, where he spent a very successful ministry of thirteen years. The church of Kirkwood, now in a very prosperous condition, was organized by him during that time. He received the degree of D. D. from Jefferson College. In 1859 he was called to Allen Grove and Wolf Run, in West Virginia, and. in 1867 to Moundsville, where he labored faithfully till increasing infirmities compelled him to resign. He still resides in Moundsville.\n\nWhile Dr. Alexander was here, there were chosen to the Eldership, John Jepson, James McConnell, Robert Smiley, F. H. Brooks, H. H. Fisk, A. C. Work, John Tate, Sr., and John Porter. These were all conscioncious and reliable men, who had the best interest of the church at heart. Most of them have gone to their reward. There were also many who were useful men in the church at that time, whose names will appear in the list of trustees. There were two men, who, though not in the membership of the church, were constant in their attendance in the house -of God, and took a deep interest in all church affairs, and it is proper that their names should be recorded here. They were Hon. Benjamin Ruggles and Joseph Morrison. Judge Ruggles was distinguished for his liberality, not only in large gifts tothe church in the time of her pecuniary troubles, but in silent acts of kindness to his pastor, of which others knew nothing. Mr. Morrison rendered invaluable services, not only by his gifts, but by superintending the building of the church, in a most faithful and intelligent manner. Those were years of great trial in the history of this congregation, and as we consider them, we may well conclude that nothing has more vitality than a Presbyterian Church.\n\nSupplies were sent by Presbytery for one year after the resignation of Dr. Alexander, and then a call was given to the Rev. John Moffatt, a licentiate of the Presbytery of New Lisbon, in August, 1847. This call was accepted and he was ordained and installed pastor in June, 1848—the only pastor whose ordination took place in this congregation. Mr. Moffatt was a native of Westerhall parish, in Scotland, and came to this country in July, 1838. After uniting with the Church of Middle Sandy, in Columbiana county, Ohio, ho pursued his studies for the ministry in New Lisbon Academy and in the Western Theological Seminary, at Allegheny, Pa., and was licensed in June, 1847, to preach the Gospel. This was his first pastoral charge, and here for more than thirteen years he preached the Gospel with great earnestness and success. A season of considerable awakening was enjoyed in 1858, in which thirty-two persons were added to the church, and God's own people were greatly revived and quickened. Mr. Moffatt resigned this charge January 1, 1861, to become pastor of Rockhill and Bellaire, and in 1863 was called to the Second Presbyterian Church in Wheeling, where he labored with great acceptance. His death occurred in December, 1875. During the ministry of Mr. Moffat there were added at times to the Session, Samuel Ramage, James Hutchison, John Tate, Jr., Thomas T. Thompson, Samuel B. Work and Samuel Cunningham, and shortly after his resignation, and while the pulpit was vacant, there were added, Dr. Henry West, William Chambers and William H. McBride.\n\nThe Rev. David R. Campbell was the next pastor of this church. He was called to this field October 1, 1861, and entered on his duties in the following December, Mr. Campbell was born in Washington county, Pa., and graduated at Jefferson College in 1842. After spending a year in teaching, he entered the Theological Seminary at Allegheny, Pa., and completed the course there in 1846, in which year he was licensed to preach the Gospel by the Presbytery of Washington. Transferred to the Presbytery of St. Clairsville, he labored as a stated supply at Woodsfield and Bealsville for some time, and on the 6th of October, 1847, he was ordained to the work of the ministry, and installed pastor over these congregations. He was afterward settled at Mount Prospect, in the Presbytery of Washington, and also at Two Ridges, in the Presbytery of Steubenville, from which place he was called here in 1861. His ministry here was remarkably successful in the ingathering of souls. In the beginning of 1862 an unusual interest was manifested in religion, and at the communion in March twenty-two persons made a profession of religion. From that time the state of religion was very good, the attendance on ordinances larger than usual, and the attention of hearers marked and solemn.\n\nThis interesting state of things continued for three years, when, in 1865, the gathering clouds of mercy burst upon this people, and the most powerful and glorious revival of religion took place which was ever experienced in this whole region. The careless were aroused, the stout-hearted were humbled, and the caviller was silenced. All were forced to say, \"Behold what wonders God has wrought.\" The subject of religion was the general theme of conversation, not merely around the doors of the church, but on the street, in the store, in the shop, in the family circle, and everywhere. One who came on. business from a distance said that the people were beside themselves, and could talk about nothing but religion. This was the judgment Festus passed on Paul. In the opinion of some it is legitimate to be excited on politics or business, or even pleasure, but not on that subject which claims the first and chief attention of man. Angels are excited over one repenting sinner; devils are excited over one escaping from them. How strange that men can ever be careless and indifferent on this subject!\n\nThe immediate result of that work of grace was the addition to the church of one hundred persons. The 19th of March, 1865, will be remembered for generations, as a great day in the history of this church, when the aisles of this house were filled with those who stood up to take the vows of God upon them. Many of them were heads of families, some also in tender youth, and others in old age. It was a genuine work of God's spirit beyond a doubt. If we are told of some who have turned back and who have dishonored their profession, we may reply by pointing to as many inconsistent ones who have professed religion under the most ordinary circumstances. Let none limit the power of the Holy One, and say, \" Thus far shalt thou come and no further,\" or dictate the manner in which His presence shall be felt. Blessed be His name for the display of His power in His Church, whether like the silent dew, or the gentle show- ers, or the pouring torrent. Come, Holy Spirit, come as Thou wilt !\n\nThe successful labors of Mr. Campbell terminated here February 18, 1866, and he at once took charge of the Second Presbyterian church in Steubenville. His useful life terminated in M arch, 1873.\n\nThe present pastor, Rev. Robert Alexander, was called to this church September 22, 1866, and entered upon his work here on the 23d of December, of the same year. He was born in Belmont county, Ohio, on the 15th of Jane, 1837, and united with Rockhill church, April 1, 1854, under the ministry of Rev. Dr. Mitchell. He graduated at Washington College, Pa., June 20, 1855, and after pursuing a full course of Theological studies at Princeton, took an annual course in Edinburgh, Scotland. On the 6th of January, 1858, he was licensed by the Presbytery of St. Clairsville to preach the Gospel, and on the 7th of August, 1860, was ordained to the ministry by the Presbytery of Donegal, in Little Britain church, Lancaster county, Pa., over which he was installed pastor at the same time. His labors there continued more than six years and a half, during which time he received on profession of their faith about one hundred and thirty persons to the communion of that church.\n\nHe commenced his labors in this church in December, 1866,\n\n236 - HISTORY OF BELMONT AND JEFFERSON COUNTIES.\n\nand was installed pastor in the April following. This has been a period of great prosperity in this congregation. In the twelve and a half years of his ministry, which have now passed, three hundred and twelve persons have been received on profession of their faith. The whole membership at present is four hundred and fifty, one of the largest in the Synod of Cleveland. Within six years the church has been visited with three revivals of great power. In one there were forty persons received on profession ; in another there were sixty ; in the last there were more than one hundred. While the church has increased in numbers, there has been an increase in all forms of Christian activity. The Sabbath School has been carried on very efficiently for more than fifty years. Of other agencies employed we have a Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, organized in 1872 ; a Young Men's Home Missionary Society, organized in 1877, and a Young Ladies' Mission Band, organized in 1879. In the past forty years, as far back as the record is made, there have been contributed to the various objects of benevolence more than fifteen thousand dollars, in addition to that contributed to the building and repairing of the church and the support of the pastor.\n\nThere were added to the eldership in 1874, Joseph I. Taggart and Robert H. Anderson, and 1878 Henry Daniels, Samuel R. Finney, Wm. Lee, John A. Grove and George Jepson. These here named with James Hutchison, Wm. Chambers and Wm. H. McBride constitute the present session. There are many things in the past history of this church to excite humility and gratitude. The best men are imperfect men. But God has been gracious and his cause has been safe in his hands. The foundations of this congregation were laid upon the Rock of Ages, by the faith and prayers of godly men. God was honored by the safe denial and devotion of those who raised the standard of the Cross and published .the Gospel in these western wilds, and he has honored them by keeping his church through all the trials of these eighty years. He has fulfilled the promise : \"My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed.\"\n\nUNITED PRESBYTERIAN CONGREGATION OF ST. CLAIRSVILLE, OHIO.\n\nThis congregation was organized in connection with the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church, and in subordination to the first Synod of the West, which was constituted at Rush Creek, Ohio, April 27, 1z20. It was under the inspection of the Second Ohio Presbytery, The date of its formal organization is not known ; but it was about the year 1830. Previous to this date the Rev. William Taggart, D. D., was settled at Upper Wheeling, about eight miles northwest of St. Clairsville ; and the Rev. —. Calderhead preached in the neighborhood of Mt. Pleasant. Those adhering to A. R. P. church in the vicinity of St. Clairsville attended the above named places of preaching.\n\nIn the year 1831 St. Clairsville was granted the moderation of a \"call\" which was made out for Mr. Hugh Parks, a licentiate, which he accepted in October of the same year ; and he was ordained and installed, by the Second Ohio Presbytery, April 26, 1832. Mr. Parks was reared in Belmont county, Ohio ; entered upon his literary course at about ten years of age; graduated at Jefferson College in his seventeenth year ; entered the A. R. P. Theological Seminary at Allegheny City, Pa., in 1827, and graduated in 1830. He labored efficiently as pastor of the congregation for seven years and a half, when he resigned his charge on account of ill health. He has resided in the bounds of the congregation ever since, and exercised his ministry in Eastern Ohio and West Virginia until within the past year,\n\nThe Ruling Elders of the congregation at its organization and during the pastorate of the Rev. H. Parks, were David Wallace, William Templeton, John Patterson, John Nichol, Robert Stitt, William L. Duff—date of ordinatio—and John Stewart, ordained in 1838. The congregation first worshipped in the Protestant Episcopal Church. Its present house of worship was built in the year 1835. After the resignation of the Rev. H. Parks the congregation was vacant for nearly three years. Its second pastor was the Rev. Alex. Young, D.D. L.L. D., who was ordained and installed by the A. R. Presbytery of Steubenville, June 23, 1842.\n\nDr. Young was born in Scotland—came to this counrty with his parents, who settled in Allegheny county, Pa. He graduated at the Western University, Pittsburgh, Pa.; entered the Theological Seminary at Allegheny City in 1839 ; was licensed by the Presbytery of Monongahela in 1841 and graduated in 1842. His pastorate was a very successful one. At the meeting of the Second Synod of the West in 1856, Dr. Young was elected Professor of Hebrew and Greek in the Theological Seminary at Oxford, Ohio. Upon the removal of the Seminary from Oxford, Ohio, to Monmouth, Illinois, he severed his connection with the St. Clairsville congregation. He continued in the Seminary at"
