Hoag, aged 30, a life-long resident of Morgan Station, Fayette county, died of pneumonia in the government barracks at Columbus, Ohio, while in the military service of the United States government. Billy Hoag, as he was familiarly known to his friends, was a big, innocent boy, affectionate and tender-hearted as a mother and was never known to do harm to a living creature. He so utterly abhorred the taking of human life that he believed his conscience to be a higher law than that of the land, respecting the taking of human life. The unfortunate young man made a grave mistake which he afterwards realized and his recent death in the government service should go a long way toward redeeming him in the eyes of the American public. Now that he has passed to that mysterious over there it is hoped that all unfriendly thoughts towards the late William Hoag have generously been buried with him and his good traits remembered.

M. Oglevee, for the Commonwealth, was assisted by C. E. Boyle and R. H. Lindsey, Esqs. The counsel for the prisoner were D. Kaine, W. H. Playford, and W. A. McDowell, Esqs.\n\nThe facts of the case as elicited upon the trial, seem to be as follows:\n\nGeorge Cassidy and his two brothers, William Hoar and his brother, Jacob, Isaac and Solomon Boyd, Elijah Hawk, Henry Moody, Stephen Stewart, and others from the mountain, had been in Uniontown, April 8th, and all met at the eastern end of town on their way home. It was proposed by some that they should have some whiskey.George Cassidy furnished the money and he and William Hoar went back to town for the liquor. They drank together a couple of times in town, rejoined their companions, and all drank several times on the road home. The following was the position of the different members of the party a short distance above Ritenours mill: The two Boyds were ahead; George Cassidy and William Hoar next; Elijah Hawk and William Cassidy about forty yards further behind; Stewart and J. Cassidy, A. Moody and Jacob Hoar, about twenty to thirty yards in the rear. Cassidy and Hoar were heard quarrelling about some old boards which both of them claimed. Presently Cassidy struck Hoar, knocking him down. Jacob Hoar picked up a stone, and ran towards them, when Cassidy again struck William Hoar as he was in the act of raising up, knocking him down a second time. J. Hoar then pulled Cassidy away. Cassidy turned on him, but was taken off by H. Moody or William Cassidy. William Hoar died in ten or fifteen minutes after he had been struck the second time.\n\nDr. Walker of Uniontown, made examination of the body next day; thinks the blows, producing concussion at the base of the brain, were the cause of his death. Messrs. Hogsett, Ewing, Murphy, McLaughlin and Piper testified to the inoffensive character of the prisoner, and considered him a good laboring hand.\n\nThe case, on the part of the prisoner was then submitted to the jury in an able and eloquent address by Mr. Playford, followed on the part of the Commonwealth by Mr. Boyle.\n\nThe counsel for the defendant insisted upon the following point, and asked the Court, to charge the jury accordingly.\n\nThat the good character of the prisoner is an element which if proved, the jury must take into consideration in making up their estimate of the prisoner, and good character of itself may sometimes generate a doubt, where, without evidence of good character, no doubt would arise in the case from the other evidence.\n\nThe jury after being out for about five hours returned a verdict of guilty of voluntary manslaughter. The prisoner was sentenced to the penitentiary for a term of two years.\n\nGenius of Liberty, Uniontown, PA, Thursday, June 15, 1871, Vol. IV, No. 23, page 3, column 3\n\nContributed by Roy Lockart\n\nMary Margaret HOARD died in 1935.

Hoffman Adds Tragic Touch to Romance of Three Members of One Family Who Eloped Together.\n\nAfter a wedded life of less than three weeks, one of which was spent at St. Francis hospital, Mrs. Gertrude M. Hoffman, wife of Harry F. Hoffman of 722 Ivy street, Shadyside, died at the hospital at 11 o'clock yesterday morning. Her sudden death recalls one of the most romantic elopements of the year and has prostrated members of her family.\n\nMrs. Hoffman was a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry H. McGiffin, residents of Pittsburgh for many years. She was born on Mt. Washington, where the family is well known. Although still a young and charming woman, she was the widow of George Crosby and had a five-year-old daughter, Adelaide.\n\nLast Labor Day Mrs. Crosby, her sister, Miss Bessie McGiffin, and a cousin, Miss Mabel Campbell, who had been raised by Mr. and Mrs. McGiffin and was like a daughter to them, left their home ostensibly to attend a picnic at Rock Springs park. During the afternoon a telegram came to the McGiffin home reading:\n\n\"Have wedding supper ready for six.\" Mrs. McGiffin summoned her husband, and after a time, they saw a light. Their three girls had married, Mrs. Crosby becoming Mrs. Hoffman, Miss McGiffin, Mrs. David M. Jones, and Miss Campbell, Mrs. Thomas Highman. The six young people came home that evening, were forgiven and received the blessing of the old folks before they went to housekeeping in various parts of the city.\n\nThe sudden death of the bride of less than a month has cast a pall over the four households. Her mother and sister are prostrated by the shock and the only one unaffected is the little daughter, Adelaide, who, unable to realize what had occurred, played and chattered about the darkened home yesterday. Mrs. Hoffman's death is partially attributed to the excitement incident to the romantic triple wedding.\n\nMrs. Hoffman was a well known member of St. Paul's Roman Catholic cathedral. Besides the parents, daughter, sister and cousin, she leaves two brothers, William and Henry McGiffin. Her funeral is to take place next Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock, with the interment at St. Mary's cemetery.\n\nGlenn R. HOFFMAN (1894-1994)\n\nGlenn R.
