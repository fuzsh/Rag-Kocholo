When the light drew nearer and nearer with no apparent change of direction, I brought my Car to a stop, still expecting the motorcycle to turn out. I had my headlights dimmed. Even when the cycle's headlights was but a few yards in the front of my machine, I could see the sidecar.\n\nThe next instant the sidecar crashed into the Automobile. I immediately started on foot toward the bridge tollhouse on foot for assistance, as I could not see no one around at the time of the accident and was along in the car, but two men came running up to then.\n\nThe man in the sidecar moved a little when we came over to him, but was dead when the officers arrived a few minutes.\"\n\nAlthough the sidecar was badly wrecked, Kindleberger was not even thrown from the seat, and Bolen, driving the cycle was entirely unmarried. Both men were hurried to the City in the ambulance, where a brief examination verified that Kindelberger was dead. No examination to determine the wounds which caused the death was made last night, as an autopsy will performed today. Kindleberger's face and head were not cut.
