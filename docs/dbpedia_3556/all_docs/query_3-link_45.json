It could be a story, a biography, a photograph, an outline of a research problem — anything that focuses on one ancestor.”\n\nThis is entry #52 in Amy Johnson Crow’s Challenge: 52 Ancestors in 52 Weeks.\n\nI’d apologize for the long title but I couldn’t resist! Thank you, Amy Johnson Crow, for a wonderful journey. To all my readers, thank you for coming back time and time again. After reading the last entry for this year, I’d appreciate it if you would please leave a comment letting me know what you liked, disliked, loved, or even hated about this challenge. Thank you and Happy New Year!\n\n#52 Levina DOSS – Another Unmarried Mother and How She Helped Me Bring This Challenge Finale to an End with a Bang!\n\nOne unmarried mother in my family tree would be easy to take. But two is a bit harder especially since they were mother and daughter. In July I wrote about my 3rd great-grandmother Mary E. “Polly” DOSS being a single mother. Her mother, my 4th great-grandmother, Levina DOSS was also a single mother.\n\nThe DOSS family had strong roots in Halifax and Pittsylvania County, Virginia. In 1755 Levina’s grandfather James DOSS Sr. received a land grant for 272 acres in Halifax County, an area soon to become part of the newly created Pittsylvania County in 1767. This land grant was located adjacent to Beechtree Creek and Staunton River.\n\nPittsylvania County lies in south midland Virginia, bordering on the North Carolina line. Bordering counties are Bedford (northwest), Campbell (northeast), Halifax (east), Caswell in North Carolina (southeast), Rockingham in North Carolina (southwest), Henry (west/southwest), and Franklin (west/northwest).\n\nParents and Siblings of Levina DOSS\n\nMy 4th great-grandmother Levina DOSS was born between 1771-1775 in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, to James DOSS Jr. and his wife Elizabeth. James was born about 1742 in Amelia County, he married Elizabeth about 1771 and died 1812 in Pittsylvania. Levina had 5 known siblings:\n\nSib 1: Elizabeth DOSS (1772-1830) was born about 1772. Elizabeth DOSS married Ebenezer ANGEL (1769-1850) on 15 December 1794 in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. She died between 1830-1840.\n\nSib 2: Phillip Valorius DOSS (1775-1814) born about 1775. Phillip married Rhoda Elizabeth THURMAN (1787-1850) about 1804 in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. He died before 14 June 1814 (the date his widow Rhoda was mentioned in court records). Descendants of this line might be interested in some old photos that Vickie Beard Thompson posted on her blog I Dig My Roots and Branches.\n\nSib 3: Mary Ann DOSS (1780- ) was born about 1780 [I am not very comfortable with this estimate considering her marriage in 1811]. She married(1) Preston DUDLEY (1773-1816) on 2 January 1811 in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. She may have married(2) James BELL in about 1820.\n\nSib 4: William DOSS (1785-1820) was born about 1785. William married Martha CREWS (1789- ) on 29 April 1812 in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. He died before 1820.\n\nSib 5: Edward DOSS (1795-1850) was born about 1795. Edward married Nancy MITCHELL (1803-1860) on 19 December 1822 in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. He died before 1850.\n\nPittsylvania County censuses for the years 1790, 1800, and 1810 are lost but a substitute is available. The loss is unfortunate and the substitute is helpful but doesn’t do for me what the 1810 census would have done. I was hoping to see what the household of James DOSS looked like in 1810 and if his daughter Levina had her own household or was living in her father’s home with her three children.\n\nLevina’s father James DOSS Jr. died about 1812 in Pittsylvania County, Virginia.\n\nLevina’s Life as a Mother\n\nIn 1820 Levina DOSS was living in Pittsylvania County most likely on or near the land granted to her grandfather in 1755. She was an unmarried mother and the head of a household that included her four sons, two daughters, and most likely her mother Elizabeth who was widowed about 1812.\n\n1820 U.S. Federal Census\n\nPittsylvania County, Virginia\n\nEnumeration Date: August 7, 1820\n\nLevina Doss\n\nFree White Persons – Males – Under 10: 2 (William b. abt. 1811 & Phillip b. abt. 1814)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 10 thru 15: 1 (unknown son b. bet. 1804-1810)\n\nNote: no males 16-18 yo (therefore Thomas was 19 & under 26 yo)\n\nFree White Persons – Males – 16 thru 25: 1 (Thomas b. abt. 1801)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – Under 10: 1 (Mary E. b. abt. 1816)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 16 thru 25: 1 (unknown daughter born bet. 1795-1804)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 26 thru 44: 1 (Levina b. abt. 1775)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 45 and over : 1 (poss. mother Elizabeth b. abt. 1750)\n\nNumber of Persons – Engaged in Agriculture: 2\n\nFree White Persons – Under 16: 4\n\nFree White Persons – Over 25: 2\n\nTotal Free White Persons: 8\n\nTotal All Persons – White, Slaves, Colored, Other: 8\n\nBy 1830 Levina had given birth to another daughter she named after her mother. Young Elizabeth and my 3rd great-grandmother Mary E. were the only children still living at home. Next door was Levina’s son William with his wife and young son. Also next door was her brother-in-law Eben ANGEL, a Baptist minister, with his wife, Levina’s sister Elizabeth and their children.\n\n1830 U.S. Federal Census\n\nPittsylvania County, Virginia\n\nPage No. 348\n\nLevina Doss\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 5 thru 9: 1 (Elizabeth bet. 1821-1825)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 10 thru 14: 1 (Mary E. b. abt. 1816)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 50 thru 59: 1 (Levina, b. 1771-1775)\n\nFree White Persons – Under 20: 2\n\nTotal Free White Persons: 3\n\nTotal – All Persons (Free White, Slaves, Free Colored): 3\n\nAs can be seen in the above listing Levina’s mother, or the older woman who had been seen in her household in 1820, was no longer with her. Let’s take a look at another person who was very close to Levina on this census.\n\n1830 United States Federal Census\n\nPittsylvania County, Virginia\n\nName: Bettsy Doss\n\nFree White Persons – Females – Under 5: 2 (unknown)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 30 thru 39: 1 (unknown)\n\nFree White Persons – Females – 70 thru 79: 1 (“Bettsy” widow of James DOSS)\n\nFree White Persons – Under 20: 2\n\nFree White Persons – 20 thru 49: 1\n\nTotal Free White Persons: 4\n\nIf the lady who was the head of the household was also the older female then her age was 70 and under 80 years and could have been Levina’s widowed mother. Who was the younger lady living with Elizabeth in 1830? Was she a granddaughter with two small children? She couldn’t have been a daughter-in-law with such young children as Phillip and William died before 1820 and Edward was living in Campbell County.\n\nLevina DOSS and her mother Elizabeth both died between 1830 and 1840.\n\nLevina’s Children\n\nIn the 1830s Levina’s children Thomas, William, Polly, and Elizabeth moved to Mason County in what would later become West Virginia. The DOSS siblings were a tight bunch. It is not known if their mother Levina was still living and made the move with the group or if she had died before the children moved. Only her son Phillip remained in Pittsylvania County, Virginia.\n\nChild 1: Thomas DOSS (abt.1801-1881) was born about 1801 in Pittsylvania County. He married(1) Elizabeth EADS (abt.1802-bet.1860-1867) on 6 March 1827 in Caswell County, North Carolina. He married(2) Martha Forbes GORDON (1824-1881) on 28 April 1867 in Chariton County, Missouri. Thomas died on 1 April 1881 in Chariton County and was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in the same county.\n\nChild 2: _____ (female) DOSS born bet. 1795-1804 (inferred from the 1820 census)\n\nChild 3: _____ (male) DOSS born bet. 1804-1810 (inferred from the 1820 census)\n\nChild 4: William DOSS (abt.1811-1888) was born about 1811 in Pittsylvania County. He married Elizabeth BARBER (abt.1814-1898) on 12 May 1828 in Pittsylvania County. It is possible that his wife died as he married again on 28 December 1837 in Mason County to Elizabeth HENRY. , William died on 22 November 1888 in Mason County, West Virginia. ,\n\nChild 5: Phillip Valorius “Phil” DOSS (abt.1814-aft.1880) was born about 1814 in Pittsylvania County. He married Elizabeth BAILESS (abt.1815-aft.1880) on 25 December 1835 in Campbell County, Virginia. Phillip died after 1880.\n\nChild 6: Mary E. “Polly” DOSS born about 1816 in Pittsylvania County, died bef. 1892 in Mason County, West Virginia. She never married but had eight children with William CLONCH.\n\nChild 7: Elizabeth “Betsy” DOSS born bet. 1821-1825. She married(1) John CLONCH (abt.1810-bet.1844-1847) on 15 February 1842 in Gallia County, Ohio. She married(2) John William STEED (abt.1806-aft.1880) on 26 October 1848 in Gallia County, Ohio. Betsy died after 1880.\n\nThe only documentation I have found for Levina are the two census listings in which she was named as the head of a household. None of her children’s marriage records have their mother’s name mentioned. All of her known children died after 1880 and before 1900. Only her son William’s death record was found but it didn’t include information on his parentage.\n\nCredits and a New Cousin\n\nWhile preparing to write this last blog post for the 52 Ancestors in 52 Weeks Challenge I learned Libbie Griffin started up the Doss Family Association in 1994 for the purpose of sharing information among all Doss descendants. She should be credited for researching and compiling genealogical information that was published in their newsletter The Doss Connection. In our world of social media today it is so easy to find other researchers but what do you do when the person has “retired” from her hobby? If I can find my ancestors shouldn’t I be able to find Libbie? In the days prior to social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), we used message boards and mailing lists. I searched through them until I found the most recent email address.\n\nA Christmas Present and the Grand Finale\n\nSaturday before Christmas I got an early present. Libbie replied to my email and told me about a bundle she found which included depositions that proved many connections in the Virginia Doss families.\n\n“On one trip to Richmond for research I discovered that the information I needed to find the original papers was in Lynchburg, more than 100 miles away. I went there and obtained the detailed title of the case and case number. When I returned to Richmond the next day with that information I was handed a bundle of papers that had not been opened since a string was tied around them nearly 200 years earlier….I can’t tell you how excited I was!”\n\nReading this gave me goosebumps. Isn’t it the dream of all genealogists to find the mother lode? She told me she had written an entire issue of The Doss Connection about the find with transcripts of the important documents. She offered to scan and email it to me. YES! Thank you very much! She also wrote, “It felt wonderful to be reminded of that ‘find’.”\n\nWhat Libbie found was a bundle that has not been scanned and therefore is not available in the Library of Virginia‘s collection of Chancery Records that are online. The case details of the bundle are indexed online. In the issue of the newsletter Libbie sent me, pages 2-12, 17-18, and 22 were filled with information on the case and the families involved. A plat drawing of the land in question was included:\n\nAlthough I would love to share all of the information found in this issue of The Doss Connection I have chosen to only share excerpts, with Libbie’s permission, concerning my 4th great-grandmother Levina DOSS. First, the deposition given by Levina spelled Lavina in this excerpt, and second, the deposition of her mother Elizabeth. Words in brackets are Libbie’s and some punctuation and spelling corrections were made for easier reading but don’t change the meaning:\n\nThe Testimony of Lavina Doss\n\n“Deposition taken in Pittsylvania Co., Va., 7 May 1817: Lavina Doss … deposeth and sayeth that in the last sickness of her Grandfather, James Doss Senr. & but a Short time before his death, he sent for her Father James Doss Junr to come & see him, accordingly he went & this deponant went with him & we both went together, into the room where my Grandfather lay alone. He spoke to my father & said I am glad to see you Jamey, I have been uneasy & have sent for you to have some talk with you about our affairs. I am about soon to leave you my son & want you to have your rite. I know that I am owing you money that ought to have been paid before now but it was not in my power to do it, but I have now directed my Ext [Executor] to pay you without putting you to any trouble about it. As to the land, it is yours. It was gave to you & I wish you to have it for you have an undoubted rite to it & cannot be kept out of it after my death, your uncle Edward Nicks, gave you the land by Deed of Gift & I have no Claim to it any longer than I live; altho I have directed the land to [defer?, unclear] other ways than I ought to have done, it is not intended to keep you out of your Rite, but only to try to keep peace a little longer over my old head, for I wish to leave my family in peace & I know you will get the land after my death — altho it may put you to the trouble of goin’ or sending for the deed of gift, which I did no want you to have the trouble of. But for the sake of peace in my family, I could not help doing as I have, you know when I agreed to give you up the land below the Shop branch, what an oneasiness [uneasiness] & interruptions it made in my family, till you consented for the business to rest as it was till my death.\n\nThis deponent further sayeth that in the life time of the said James Doss Senr. he frequently said that the land belonged to his son James Doss Junr. after his death, that it was gave to him by uncle Edward Nicks and that he held no claim to it any longer than life. This deponent further states that her grandfather James Doss senr. dec’d., put her father James Doss Junr. into possession of the said land below the Shope branch, as above mentioned, & her father began to run a fence on the said land, but was stopped at the request of his father, on account of the disturbance & uneasiness it made in his family, but told my father, James Doss Junr. he would get the whole of the said land after his death. [signed: Lavina (X) Doss, her mark]\n\nNotes (by Libbie): We should keep in mind that Lavina had something of a vested interest in the outcome of this case, and might have stressed her father’s right in the land a bit overmuch. In addition to providing us with an account of James Sr.’s last day, and his love for and concern for his family, Lavina’s testimony also tells what we had previously suspected: that although Lavina had 5 or 6 children, she never married. More on her family appears later in this issue.”\n\nThe Testimony of Elizabeth Doss\n\n“Pittsylvania County, 27 September, 1816 [omitting the beginning].… the tract of land in the bill mentioned was in the possession of my husband James Doss Junr. at the time of his death but was afterward sold (sometime in the year of 1812) at publick sale to the hightest bidder, subject to my dower, by the defendant Samuel Pannill, under a deed of trust executed by my said husband James Doss Junr. to the said Samuel Pannill to secure the payment of a debt due from my husband….to David Pannill’s Estate … neither the said complainant [Nathan Thurman] nor any other person forbid the sale, but since the sale the said Complainant Nathan Thurmon [sic] hath applied to this Respondent to purchase the dower land she holds in her possession & having thus fully answered this Respondant prayes to be hence dismissed with her Costs. [signed: Elizabeth (X) Doss, her mark]\n\nNote (by Libbie): Elizabeth was taxed for 56 acres until 1827, when this land was taken by the county (see Pittsylvania Co. Deed Bk. 28, p. 121). She and her children and grandchildren may have continued to live there afterward.”\n\nThis post was ready for publication before I heard from Libbie. I did not want to change what was written and added footnotes to items that have additional remarks or information.\n\nI’m going to let Libbie have the final word.\n\n“I’m sure you can imagine how hard it was for me to keep from cheering loudly in the hushed halls of the Virginia State Library when I cut that string and read those old documents! A similar experience led me to the answers I needed about my own Doss family. It’s amazing what’s there to find if we look long enough.”"
