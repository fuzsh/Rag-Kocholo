In the early days of the Colony of Virginia, Werowocomoco, the scene of the romantic incident of the rescue of John Smith by Pocahontas, was, of course, as well known as Jamestown. But, in a few years, the Indians deserted the place, and when Strachey wrote about 1614, the Indian head-war-chief, Powhatan, had retired to a town called Orapaks at the head of Chickahominy river. The early historians were not over critical as to localities, and after the removal to Orapaks there were no great ruins to preserve the memory of the place where the frail wigwams of Powhatan once stood. So as time went on the ancient site of Werowocomoco on York River fell subject to the sport of tradi- tion and guess work. The first person to display a critical spirit in reference to the matter was Mr. Henry Howe, who, in 1843, commenced travel- ling over the State collecting materials and taking sketches for illustration. He fixed the ancient settlement at \"Shelly/5 the seat of Mrs. Mann Page at the mouth of Carter’s Creek, and his reasons for so doing appear to have been two-fold : First, \"Shel- ly” is about twenty-five miles from West Point, and John Smith had so described Werowocomoco. Secondly, the place is marked by immense deposits along the shore of oyster shells, which betoken the existence once of Indian habitations. Mr. Charles Campbell, the historian, after having adopted the above opinion, renounced it in favor of another place only two or three miles further down. On paying a visit to \"Shelly” 2 William and Mary College Quarterly. and neighborhood, he became satisfied that Timber Neck Bay in Gloucester, the ancient seat of the Manns, was the famous spot. Besides conforming sufficiently in distance from West Point and abundance of oyster deposits, it had the additional recommenda- tion of an old chimney standing at the east end thereof — a chim- ney whose massive dimensions suggested royalty, and which, it is said, was known from very early times as “Powhatan’s Chim- ney.” Mr. Campbell supposed this to be the chimney to the house made for Powhatan by some Dutchmen in 1609. If there is really any “popular belief” as to the ancient location of Werowocomoco, it seems to be traceable to the authority of Mr. Howe or Mr. Campbell. Dr. Alexander Brown was the first to substitute fact for tra- dition and guess work, and in his great work The Genesis of the United States , he locates Werowocomoco further up the river, at Portan Bay, quoting as his authority the chart of Robert Tindall drawn in 1608. On this chart “Poetan,” situated on Portan Bay, about eleven miles from West Point, appears as the capital town.* No town called Werowocomoco appears. As Dr. Brown does not go into details, the purpose of this article is to enquire into all the facts of the case and to con- clusively settle the location once and for all. I am of opinion that Dr. Brown is undoubtedly right in his statement, and that in this he is not only supported by Tindall’s map, but by many other facts which he probably had not space to mention in his book. Poetan, another spelling for Powhatan, was doubtless the real name of Werowocomoco, which in the Indian meant the “town of the Werowance,” or the capital — a descriptive name. The ending, “comoco,” meant a “meeting” or “assembly,” as is shown in the word matchacomoco — a term applied to a grand council or conference. The town was called “Powhatan” because Pow- hatan lived there, and under the various spellings of that word. Poetan, Portan, Porton, Purtan, Purton, the place has come down to us, and still abides with us. Tindall calls it Poetan (1608), Hermann Porton (1673), Pry and Jefferson Portan (1751), Dr. Madison Portan (1807), and the present coast sur- * It is marked on the chart by four wigwams. The other Indian towns by one only. Werowocomoco. 3 vey “Purtan.” In the York county records (1661) it is called Purton, and in Hening’s Statutes (1663) it has the same spell- ing. At the latter date it was the home of another John Smith, called John Smith of Purton, to distinguish him from other Smiths of that name in Gloucester county.* It was at Poplar Spring, near Purton, that some servants, who had been soldiers of Oliver Cromwell, concerted a rendevous for rebellion in 1663. But they were informed upon by Berkenhead, one of their num- ber, and the conspiracy was nipped in the bud by Sir William Berkeley, the Governor. Not much importance is to be given to the points on which Mr. Howe and Mr. Campbell rest their cases. The distance, which Smith in one place assigns to Werowocomoco from the parting of the river at West Point, was a mere guess; for in another place he states the distance to be twenty miles, and in still an- other he says that Werowocomoco was twelve miles from Chis- kiack. In this last statement William Strachey, the secretary of Lord Delaware, agrees. Now Chiskiack was a region above Yorktown, whose locality is definitely fixed. It was the name of an Indian town, and the parish subsequently established em- embracing the site thereof, called first Chiskiack Parish and afterwards Hampton Parish, extended, as the York records show, from Yorktown Creek to Queen’s Creek. The Indian town of Chiskiack being nearly opposite to Carter’s Creek and Timber- neck Bay, could not, by any possible calculation, have been twelve miles away from Werowocomoco, if the latter had been located at Shelly or Timberneck Bay. But Purton is just about twelve miles distant, and meets the requirement. That Smith hit the truth in his last statement is shown not only by his agree- ment with Strachey, but by his own map, which gives the dis- tance between the places, Werowocomoco and Chiskiack, as about twelve miles. * In 1661 Anna Bernard, “now of Purton, in Petsoe Parish, in the county of Gloster, in Virginia, widdow,” makes a deed. She was the wife of Richard Bernard, of Petsoe, Bucks. Her maiden name was Corderoy. Her daughter Anne married John Smith, who came into possession of the place. (See Bernard Family, Quarterly, V., p. 62.) In 1849, there was a renewal grant of Portan (Purton) to William John Clarke, in which it was said to consist of 1,665 acres, and to be bounded by Broad Creek, York River, and Tanks Poropotank Creek, or Adams Creek. 4 William and Mary College Quarterly. Another chart given by Dr. Brown, found in the Spanish archives, and supposed to have been the one sent to England in 1608, with Smith’s “News from Virginia,” tells the same tale. At about eleven miles from West Point and twelve miles from Chiskiack, appears on a bay “Werowocomoco.” Below Werowocomoco, on the same side of the river are two towns, Cappahowsack and Cantaunteck. There is at this day a wharf on the north side of York river called Cappahosick (Cap- pahowsack), evidently marking the old Indian district of that name; and this district, as shown on the charts, lay between Werowocomoco and Timberneck Creek. The wharf is at least seven miles above Timberneck Creek. It was this country of Cappahosic that Powhatan offered to give Smith “for two great guns and a grindstone.” Werowocomoco was above it. As to the deposit of oyster shells at Shelly and Timberneck, that proves only that Indians lived in the neighborhood, but it does not prove that the particular town called “Werowocomoco” was situated there. On the chart last mentioned appears, just above Tindall’s Point (now Gloucester Point), an Indian town called Cantaunteck. As to the sandstone chimney, there is absolutely nothing but its name connecting it with “Powhatan,” and in regard to this name there is nothing to show when it began to attach to the chimney. This stone, which is full of fossil remains, is un- doubtedly of vast age, but it does not follow that structures com- posed of it are ancient. The church at Yorktown, built in 1697, is composed of the same kind of sandstone, and, as the church stood after the fire of 1814, with all the woodwork destroyed, it must have looked a thousand years old. The records show that from a very early date stone houses and stone chimneys were not uncommon in Virginia.* Nothing then remains of Mr. Howe’s and Mr. Campbell’s surmises as to the location of Werowocomoco. That location is fixed by the charts and contemporary authority indisputably at Portan Bay, on the north side of York River. * When I last visited the stone chimney, I found it prostrate and in ruins.

Missouri Compromise. o MISSOURI COMPROMISE. Letters to James Barbour, Senator of Virginia in the Congress of the United States. The question of admitting Missouri came before the House of Repre- sentatives for the first time in 1818. At the next session it was taken up again, and, on motion of Mr. Scott, the territorial delegate, referred to a committee, who reported on the 9th of December, 1819, a bill in the usual form, authorizing Missouri to form a State constitution. To this bill a restriction against the continuance of slavery was moved by J. W. Taylor, of New York. Soon after this the subject was agitated in the Senate. A bill pro- viding for the admission of Maine, which had passed the House on the 3d of January, 1820, was amended in the Senate by a provision tacking on to it the admission of Missouri. Jonathan Roberts, of Pennsylvania, moved an amendment similar to that of Mr. Taylor’s, pending in the House. On February 1st, his re- striction was voted down in the Senate by a vote of 27 to 16. This appeared to indicate a large majority against restriction, but it was one only looking to a compromise. On the question of linking Maine with Missouri there was only a majority of one, to be counted on, and this one vote seemed dependent on another kind of restriction. On February 3d, Jesse B. Thomas, of Illinois, one of the senators voting against Mr. Roberts’ restriction, moved an amendment prohibiting slavery north of 36^2° north latitude in all the territory outside of Missouri, ceded by France and known by the name of Louisiana. This amendment passed the Senate February 17th by a vote of 34 to 10. The Maine bill, with Missouri and this restriction on its back, was returned to the House, and was taken up on the 19th day of February. On the 28th of February the House disagreed to the Thomas provision by a vote of 160 to 14. The Senate asked for a committee of conference, and a committee was appointed, of which Mr. Holmes, of Massachusetts, was chairman, and all the others Northern men except Mr. Lowndes, of South Carolina. This committee on March 2d advised that the Senate should recede from its amendments to the Maine bill, and permit the admission of Maine unencumbered by Missouri, and that both Houses should pass the House bill for the admission of Missouri by striking out the House restriction against slavery in the State, and substituting in lieu of it the Thomas provision, imposing a restriction on territory out- side of the State, as we have seen. This was the Missouri Compromise so-called. This report was agreed to by the Senate without a count. But in the House, on considering the report, the question was first taken on striking out the restriction against slavery in the State as it then stood in the House bill for the admission of Missouri. This was the test vote in that body, and on this vote the ayes and noes stood 90 for and 87 against striking out the restriction. Of the 90 votes in favor of striking out the restriction on the State, only 14 were from non-slaveholding LIBRARY OF WASHINGTON & LEE UNIVERST' 6 William and Mary College Quarterly. States. The question then came up on concurring with the Senate in the Thomas amendment, which provided for the exclusion of slavery from all the Louisiana cession outside of Missouri, and north of 36° 30' north latitude, and on this question the vote stood 134 against to 42 in favor. Of all the Southern States, it is evident from the following letters and an analysis of the vote that Virginia was the most uncompromising, that in fact if it had depended upon her action, the issue of slavery, in- stead of being postponed to 1861, would have been fought to a finish at this time. The Legislature met at Richmond on Monday, December 6, 1819. Linn Banks was re-elected speaker of the House of Delegates. A letter was read from Hon. John W. Eppes, resigning his seat in the Senate of the United States on account of ill health. In January the House of Delegates adopted, with only one or two dissenting voices, a preamble and resolutions denouncing in severe terms “the alarming attempt” to manacle the sovereign will of the people in Missouri, and pledging the State of Virginia “to interpose in their defence;” but these resolutions were not adopted by the Senate, and did not go out as the official utter- ance of the State. It seems that President Monroe was in favor of con- ciliatory action, and on February 3d addressed a letter to Senator Bar- bour, expressing himself in favor of separating the admission of Maine from that of Missouri. On the same day Mr. Thomas introduced his compromise as to the Territories. The President and his Cabinet, Adams, Crawfprd, Calhoun and Wirt, thought favorably of this measure, and the President appears to have communicated his disposition in an interview to Barbour. Indeed, Mr. Thomas, in offering his amendment, evidently acted in the confidence of some of the Southern leaders. On the 9th of February, 1820, a caucus of the members of the General Assembly convened to nominate presidential electors. Mr. Yancey, a leading member, who had received a letter from Mr. Barbour, broke the news of the President’s position to the caucus. Immediately an intense excitement prevailed; the proposed compromise was bitterly denounced, and so indignant were all with Mr. Monroe that no electors were at this time nominated, and an adjournment took place. Mr. Barbour shared in the general suspicion, and some severe com- ments were made on what people supposed to be his intentions. Even Chief Justice Marshall sympathized in the general indignation felt at this time as to the rumored compromise. Reassuring letters from Barbour contributed to calm the ferment at Richmond, which settled finally into a determined resolve to oppose to the last any restriction, let the consequences be what they may. The Senate of Virginia took up the resolutions of the House of Delegates, and substituted for them a paper written in a calm, able and argumenta- tive strain, firm as a rock, but containing no threats or violent words. This was adopted by both Houses. On the 17th the caucus met again and nominated the electors, twenty-four in all, favorable to Mr. Monroe; and on the same day a vote was taken in the United States Senate on Mr. Thomas’ compromise amendment, but among the negatives were the Missouri Compromise. 7 names of James Barbour and James Pleasants, of Virginia. Afterwards, when the vote took place in the House of Representatives on the same restriction, out of a delegation of twenty-two, seventeen voted against the compromise. There were only twenty-five from other States. Of these five were from the North and the other twenty were scattered among the other Southern States. If, in 1861, South Carolina took the lead of the Southern States in resisting the Northern majority, it is only history to say that in 1820 that position was taken by Virginia. From Judge Spencer Roane. Richmond, Dec. 29, 1819. Dear Sir: I had the pleasure to receive some few days ago your favor of the 19th, by which I am much obliged. A short absence in the country has delayed my reply. I regret that my occupations with the business of the court deny to me the leisure which is adequate to the due consideration of the great subjects which you have presented to my view. I regret it the more as I feel gratified by the confidence in me which you have expressed. I entirely concur with you in sentiment as to the Floridas, a war, and the Missouri question; and I should think that such is the general opinion here. The tendency of the general govern- ment to aggrandize itself and to sweep away the State authori- ties would derive additional fuel from a war, and from the power and patronage which it inevitably engenders. No fresh stimulus is wanting. On the contrary, if a powerful counteraction is not made, every thing will be lost. Our confederation will be but a name, and the liberties of the people will fall with the State governments. A revival of the spirit and principles of 1799 has, however, taken place here, and I think a strong mani- festation will be made in the form of Instructions to our Sena- tors in Congress. The decision of the Supreme Court will be the principal object; as that claims a right to every thing pos- sessed by the States, whereas the Missouri question is but a par- ticular measure. I think (and indeed don’t doubt) that Vir- ginia will be true to herself and to the noble cause. As for the Missouri question, we see it in all its bearings, and under all its objections. Mr. Hay is writing for us as you will see in the Enquirer ; and it is wonderful that he should, after acquiescing in the ground taken by the Supreme Court. That acquiescence 8 William and Mary College Quarterly. worked an estoppel (as the lawyers say) to his objecting any thing to the measure in question. I repeat that I entirely concur in your just ideas on these subjects, and can add nothing to them. As for the bank of the United States, I would submit to it unconstitutional as it is, for the present. I would give it more rope, and it will further develop its effects and its tendencies. I doubt whether it can as yet be shaken off. It has so insinuated itself into all our transactions, having even gotten into “our bed-chambers and our kneading-troughs,” that it cannot yet be expelled from our country. I am not well enough acquainted with the subject to pass upon your project of a bank merely of deposit. As for the right of the people to get rid of oppressive charters, I cannot doubt it. The Legislature, even has this right, as I think, under strong circumstances. My opinion on this subject (which you are pleased to compliment) has been sometimes quoted in the Virginia Assembly and, particularly, last year on the question of the James River Canal Company. It is to be seen in Hening and Mumford, in the case of Currie against the Mutual Assurance Society. Though crude and un- digested, I have not yet seen cause to retract the sentiments de- livered on that important subject. That principle it is, now, all- important to adhere to. It affords the only check against the rapid strides which are every where making to multiply charters said to be irrepealable. Certain I am that all our checks and restrictions must be put in requisition to preserve the rights of the people from the ever active and increasing encroachments of those in power. With great esteem and regard, I am, dear sir, Yr friend and sevt., Spencer Roane.* (In haste.) P. S. — I shall be glad to hear from you again. Honble Mr. Barbour. * Spencer Roane was a graduate of William and Mary College, and a leading judge of the Supreme Court of Virginia. He married Anne Henry, daughter of Patrick Henry, and was father of William H. Roane, United States Senator. Missouri Compromise. 9 From President Monroe. Dear Sir: Feb'y 3, 1820. I have reflected much on the subject of our conversation yester- day and will communicate to you the result. It appears from your statement that on the question of making the admission of Maine dependent on that of Missouri without restriction, you will have a majority of one vote only. How far that vote may be relied on in all the conjunctions that may occur, I know not. Taking the whole subject, however, into, view, my decided opinion is, that the best course for our Union, and for that also of the Southern States, will be to separate the two questions at once, and to admit Maine. You may now do it with honor, and with great advantage to the object you have in view, the unqualified admission of Missouri, but if it is delayed for a few days only the opportunity will be lost. The Southern members ought to rise and state, that they had been driven in their own defense into the measure, to save the constitution, to save the peace and tranquillity of their country, but that they had had time to reflect, and had reflected on the subject, and resolved on a different course of conduct. I would state that the undeviating patriot- ism and republicanism of Maine had a strong claim to attention, and that the magnanimous conduct' of the members to the East, who voted with you, to save the Constitution had also its weight. That you thought it incumbent on you to release them from the distressing dilemma, in which they were placed, in regard to their constituents, who had been improperly excited without a due knowledge of all circumstances. That you would leave the question of Missouri, to rest on its own merits, to be decided by a fair appeal, to the principles of the Constitution, and to the virtue and patriotism of the national councils. This course will put the Southern members on high ground. It will be a just reward to Maine, to the Eastern members with you, and secure a better result in the final arrangement of the business. It will, I think, command the applause of the Union. To give effect to this suggestion you ought to have immediately a meeting of the Southern members and act promptly. Your friend, James Monroe. Come and dine with me to-day. Gov. Floyd, Gen. Ringgold and one or two more friends will be here. 10 William and Mary College Quarterly. From Charles Yancey. Feby. 10, 1820.

From Henry St. George Tucker, M. C. Battaille, 11 Miles Above Fredg., Feb'y 11, 1820. I should have replied to your friendly letter my dear sir, before I left Richmond, but for the variety of matters which were pressing upon me previous to my departure. The session is not yet over but the necessity of moving my caravan homeward has compelled me to set out before the adjournment. I was tempted by the good weather and have already encountered a day’s rain and very deep roads. I will with great pleasure attend to the business of Madame C. I hope to hear from you soon after my arrival at Winchester on the subject. As to our public affairs, I declare to you I am unable to describe the sensation in Missouri Compromise. 11 Richmond at the intelligence conveyed by your letter. A com- promise which gives up the fairest and largest part of the West- ern Territory and leaves to us a narrow slip intersected with mountains in one direction, destroyed by Earthquakes in another, and interspersed in a third with swamps and bayous, and in- fested with mosquitoes, and bilious diseases, never can be grate- ful to us. Still less agreeable is the consideration that prompts the compromise. Is it to secure the admission to Missouri? Better that she shd wait, than that we should shut ourselves out from the Western domains of the U. S. Is it for fear the presi- dent may lose his Election? We are unwilling to purchase his service at such a price: still less willing to support him if he- can with a view to his own Election thus surrender the valuable rights of the South. The Caucus has adjourned accordingly. I trust in God if the president does sign a bill to that effect, the Southern people will be able to find some man who has not com- mitted himself to our foes; for such are, depend on it, the North- ern Politicians. Is it at all improbable that Cheves may be looked to in such an event, as we are led to fear the whole Cabinet have gone over? Such is the state of feeling that Mr. Monroe must I am satisfied make up his mind to retain his Southern friends or exchange them for those of the North. He cannot keep both. Surely the Northern People do not think he can “keep with the hounds, and run with the Hare.” If yourself and Pleasants (for whose Election it gives me great pleasure to be very solicitous) are not committed, for God’s sake let me urge you, for our sakes, and for your sakes, make no such Compromise ! I have but half a sheet of paper, and have scarce room to direct. So farewell. Love to all friends. Yours truly, H. Sh G. Tucker. From Ex- President Madison. MoNTPr., Feb. 14, 1820. Dear Sir: Your favor of the 10th has but just come to hand. It states that there is a decided majty in one House agst an unrestricted admission of Missouri, and in both for applying the restriction to all Territories West of the Mississippi, but that in a spirit of compromise Missouri will be admitted without restriction, and 12 William and Mary College Quarterly. the restriction as to Territories confined to the space Y & W of Missouri and K of Latitude 36° 30'. Between these alterna- tives the latter must be obviously preferable, as a lesser evil to those who regard both as evils : it being understood of course that they despair of a favorable change in the prospect, and see no insuperable obstacles in the Constitution Treaty. But as the advocates for restriction yield the principle they have contended for, by such a partition, ought they not on the principle of equity to make the partition correspond with the estimated propor- tions in which the common property was paid for by the two descriptions of owners? I make these brief and hasty remarks in compliance with the wish you have intimated and in the con- fidence you have authorized. Friendly respects and good wishes, James Madison. From Andrew Stevenson. Richmond, Feb. 16, 1820. Dear Sir: I had intended to have remained silent upon ye subject which has agitated us so much, for the last ten or twelve days; nor should I now abandon this determination, and take the liberty of addressing you, did I not feel myself impelled to it, as well by a sense of duty to you, as myself. I have seen, I believe, most of the many communications which have lately been poured in upon us from Washington, and I am induced to believe that a reaction from this place has produced a degree of excitement, not less strong with you, than us. I find by yr last letter to Col° Yancey which I have this moment read that you feel very strongly upon the subject of yr first communication to him, and that the excitement which you seemed to think exists here , in relation to ye part you have taken, has certainly been misunderstood ; indeed it would seem from yr letter, that you were under the impression, that ye excitement felt here upon ye subject of the projected Compromise was intended to affect you. This in some degree is true, but certainly not to the extent and in ye manner you sup- pose. I do not profess to know everything which has been written upon this subject, but this I can say, that whilst among many of yr distinguished constituents and friends the idea of anything Missouri Compromise. 13 like a compromise upon the important subject which so agitates the union was strongly reprobated, and yr supposed sanction to it disapproved ; yet there was no unfriendly feeling towards you — - of the character which you proudly oppose. In relation to my- self I have felt not less upon the importance of the crisis than my friends and associates, and am certainly as strongly opposed to any compromise with constitutional principles and rights (regardless of consequences) as any man that breathes, and would deprecate as much unjust measures; yet I hope I have integrity enough to appreciate motive and character , and inde- pendence and magnanimity enough to sustain the Repps of my country in discharging the high duties confided to them, with a firmness and energy of character which overlooks the minor con- siderations of popularity and place for the greater and more im- portant interests of the nation. I can readily imagine the situa- tion or strait the Repps from the south have been placed on this momentous subject, and justly appreciate the motives that per- mitted them to listen for a moment to anything like a compro- mise ; and though I feel, in common with my State, a determined hostility to any such measure, I will never consent to hang up the table of proscription against those who may honestly differ from me in sentiment, or consent to cast a shade over the public character and services of any patriotic and distinguished citizen. In writing this communication to you at this time and in this manner I have no other motive than to assure you as my repre- sentative that you have my undiminished confidence, and that though I should have highly disapproved of ye measure contem- plated, I yet feel proud of the very open and dignified manner in which you have treated this subject, and feeling thus impressed I cannot withhold from you the expression of my sentiments. In haste, accept the assurance of my esteem and regard, And believe me yr. obdb Sert. J. Barbour, Esqr. And: Stevenson. From Charles Yancey. Bear Sir: 16th Feb., 1820, Richmond. Your last letters which have been shown me I am glad to find have given much gratification to your friends, who had partaken of the alarm which for a time had set the whole legislature in 14 William and Mary College Quarterly. a state of fervid excitement from your first communication — such a state of indignant feeling I never witnessed in any public as- sembly. The idea that the President, the heads of the Depart- ment, the leading members of Congress and especially our sena- tors were ready, nay, about to yield the interest of the Southern States, together with the constitution itself, to the domination of the East was indeed too horrible to be tolerated. The idea prevailed that the President and other influential men had but a few days before inclined to adopt this Compromise in the final resort, and that the next day it was to be decided on. The sud- den indignation which prevailed on the first disclosure of such a state of things, I am glad to find, is gradually retiring before a better understanding of the state of things in Washington; my own opinion, as expressed on that occasion, was that you ex- pressed honestly what you conceived to be the fact in your letter to Col. Yancey, and what you believed to be the feeling of those with whom you had communicated, but that the warmth and interest which the heat of discussion had produced, together with the apprehension for the safety of the union, which was disclosed as the discussion advanced, might have led you as well as others to attach more importance to the conversations of Mr. Monroe relative to this subject than he had designed or intended to ex- press, that he ought not, and, I thought, would not, prematurely commit himself on a subject of such momentous consequences, and on which he might hereafter be officially called upon to act ; that on such occasions misunderstandings of casual conversations with our friends very often take place that I was satisfied your motives were as pure as they had always been patriotic, and that you would be ready to march forward with the republicans of ?98 to meet any extremity which had for its object the Destruction of the constitution or the security of those rights which the people of the South were bound to claim under it. I am glad to find that this has been your course, and whatever may have been the feelings and forebodings that so trying a crisis may have given rise to, Virginia will not, I trust, doubt the course nor withdraw her confidence from those who at present represent her rights on occasions like the present. The feeling which rose so high a few days ago I think is fast subsiding ; distrust is giving way to more liberal and just views as the difficulties and dangers have been better understood at Washington, and I hope we shall go on Missouri Compromise. 15 quietly and settle all things as we ought in the caucus, which is to take place here on to-morrow night. Stephenson’s resolutions, as they are called, have been laid by in the senate to rise no more of a short and pithy character are called adjourn in a few days. The marriage of Kanawha River will be sol- emnized to-morrow to re united. I have been unapprised of any I have not heard from you. Chas. Yancey. From Thos. Ritchie, Editor of the “Richmond Enquirer/’ My Dr Sir: I recd yrs by last night’s mail, and hasten to assure you that my mind is warmed by all the subjects on which you have touched. The Missouri Question stands prominent. On Saturday even- ing I sent an express to G. Hay; he is busy in replying to Mr. King. “He is mistaken in his principles and in his facts, and I will prove him to be so.” Such are the terms in which he writes me. He will probably be ready in the course of this week. To show you the feeling here, I for the first time in my life engaged in a discussion of politics with the C. Justice. “I hope (says he) the caucus will be over before the Missouri (Question) is de- cided.” He added that he was afraid of Monroe’s re-election; that the non-slaveholding States might determine to place no man in the chair who would object to the restriction. The Compromise, if it applies to a State, be it H. or S. of the dividing line, is agl the C. IT. S. Mr. Hay avers “that the power exists as to neither State nor Territory.” The word “needful” in the C. is very emphatic. Is slave restriction a needful regula- tionf Ab4 the Florida project I thoroughly agree with you, both as to the contingency of the power, and the discretionary authority transferred to the Executive. I am sorry Mr. Monroe prevailed upon himself to urge such a proposition. Negotiate or Act one at a time, not both together, is a good general maxim in politics. I think we had best lay upon our oars till the Spanish minister comes; don’t scare him away by menace. If he has any pride left, he will scorn to open his lips. We tell him, “Sir, if you 16 William and Mary College Quarterly. give us Florida, it is well ; but whether you give it or not is im- material, for we mean to take it.” Would an independent power treat under such a disgraceful duress ? Is this courtesy — magna- nimity ?' If you knew how much pleasure your letters give me you would write me very frequently, although you find in me a dull and most unprofitable correspondent. In great haste, I am compelled to subscribe myself, With great respect, your friend, Tho. Ritchie. Monday. From Charles Yancey. Feby 17th, 1820. My Dear Sir : Your favor of the 13th was received yesterday. I find you entertain a stronger sentiment of opposition here in relation to yourself, as regards the course you partly agreed to adopt on the subject of the Compromise than is right, either in relation to yourself or the members of the present Legislature. It is true that we were under a very high excitement, but something like unmanly passion was shown by some members, whose words and actions reminded me of a coward, who always feels brave while danger is far off; but much of this feeling is to be ascribed to their hostility to the Compromise, and not to yourself in any extent worthy of your notice, for the intelligent and honorable among us see how you were surrounded on all sides by difficulties that would have embarrassed Wisdom itself in making a choice, when the result must of necessity be in opposition to the will and the judgment. This feeling has all passed away and all idle clamor has ceased, reason has resumed her empire, and 'you the former hold you had to our confidence and esteem. Your long and useful services are not, and will not, soon be forgotten. The cry here is still, Yield nothing, which you say in your last letter shall be \"your law ;” it has satisfied many to whom I read your letter that before were somewhat disposed to complain. I have seen a letter from the President to Doct Everett, in which he says the Compromise was spoken of, but that he would not consent to restriction in any manner, \"even to the hazard of the Union” (I Missouri Compromise. ir quote from memory). We shall go into Caucus this evening, and I suppose designate our electors, and expect not to hear the voice of opposition to Col. Monroe. Col. Wooding desires to be affectionately presented to you. A. Stevenson and others have promised me that they will write to you. We shall probably rise the 23d, and I have some thought of visiting the city before I go home. I kindly thank you for your several favors and shall again be glad to hear from you at a leisure moment. I am, Sir, with real regard and esteem, Yours truly, Chas Yancey. The Honorable J as. Barbour. From Judge Spencer Roane. Richmond, Feb. 19, 1820. Dear Sir : I was favored two days ago with yours of 13th. I am obliged to you for the communication. Whatever events may happen or differences of opinion arise between us, I can never forget our private friendship. The many acts of your friendly attentions to me will never be forgotten I shall equally remember the very eminent services you rendered our country as our Governor in the late war. These have given you a claim to public confidence which ought not rightly to be overlooked. I am sorry to find from your letter that you have felt so deeply some late occurrences here. I was then absent in the country, and on my return found there had been a considerable ferment. Your correspondent was perhaps indiscreet. The whole cir- cumstances should have been disclosed, and it was wrong to single you out as the victim. You had acted with men of high character, according to your best convictions, and in a most try- ing crisis, and if you and they erred, I am sure it was mere error. I ^am happy to' assure you that I am informed that as to you a counter-current is taking place. Mr. Stevenson, I expect, has written you and Major Yancey, etc. You may rely on my friend- ship and exertions to do you justice. In these calamitous circumstances of our country it would 18 William and Mary College Quarterly. give me pleasure to write you fully. At present, however, I scarcely know what to say. My whole time has been occupied in judicial business. If you think worth while, I should like you to see a letter I wrote Mr. Monroe two days ago. I am sure he would show it to you. It at least speaks the general opinion here, to reject all projects of restrictions. Col. Monroe has some enemies here, and they have been at work. I expect, however, that he will receive all the support to which he is entitled. We prefer him as president to any other, but would not sacrifice our Constitution or risque our safety to ensure his election. I expect this is a general sentiment in Virginia. It may be that these Eastern intriguers hang out these things in terrorem, but do not mean to go the length (at least the great State of Pennsylvania) of dissolving the union. If they do, however, it will be their act, and the measure will be forced on us by dire necessity. You will see by the papers what has been done in the Caucus. It has been the object to get staunch men and leave them to judge under circumstances. With great esteem and regard, I am, for the present, Yr friend and seP, Spencer Roane. From William F. Cordon. RicbA 18 Feby, 1820. My Dear Sir : It always affords me pleasure to communicate with you, and particularly when I can communicate anything that I hope may give you satisfaction. I have not been an idle spectator of the events which are passing before us. There was a great excitement here on the receipt of your letter to Col. Yancey, touching the proceedings at Washington. Indeed, the information contained in it seemed to touch the chord to which every Virginia sympathy appeared to vibrate, and an almost united disapprobation of the course which the Southern politician seemed dispose to pursue was manifest. The proposed Caucus was postponed under the excitement, and the most eager anxiety watched every incident from Washington. The heat of the moment subsided, and Caucus, agreeably to appointment, met Missouri Compromise. 19 last night with great dignity and composure, and proceeded to nominate their electoral ticket, which yon will see. The sentiment against a compromise has settled into conviction that we must resist it, not perhaps on account of the value of the territory or the disadvantage of the bargain so much, as that is against principle and manifests what we consider a spirit of injustice and want of faith in the Northern politician, which if yielded to would lead only to farther and more daring and vital usurpations. I have seen your last letters to Col. Yancey. They have given me and many other of your friends great satisfaction, and I am confident I can say to you that unless it may be with those who never were your friends, that your standing in the legislature is not injured. Your resistance of the pretensions of the Northern views was applauded by all here, and the frankness and candor of your course since, in the difficult and trying situation in which you are placed, have been duly appreciated. We here have not perhaps perceived the whole ground, nor seen through all the mazes of this perplexity and unprincipled attempt to destroy the harmony and union of the States. For myself I rest with confidence on the wisdom and patriotism of our statesmen.. My own opinion is that even Mr. King will pause before he lets slip the dogs of war. The Northern interests cannot be promoted by disunion; it has everything to lose and nothing to gain in the conflict. Ambition urges their statesmen on to deeds beyond their strength, but interest, I think and hope, will keep the balance true. Our session will terminate in a few days. We passed yesterday a bill to open the great Western communication through the James and Kenawha Rivers. With every good wish for your happiness, I am sincerely Yr. friend, Wm. F. Gordon-. N. B. — Mr. Blunter, of Essex, requests me to refer you to a letter he has written to Mr. R. T. Garrett in relation to a gentle- man by the name of Richd R. Boughan, who wants an appoint- ment at Valparaiso. If you can serve him, it will be a favor to me. Mr. Hunter tenders you his respects. W. F. Gordon\". 20 William and Mary College Quarterly. From Linn Banks. Richmond, 20th Feby , 1820. Dr Sir: Your favor of the 16th inst. came safe to hand. I thought it most correct to defer an immediate reply to the inquiries which yon suggest, with a view of ascertaining as far as practicable the wishes and sentiments of the members of the Legislature. From the various conversations which I have had with members of both branches of the Legislature, my mind has been brought to the following conclusions as the sense of the present Legislature in relation to the momentous questions now before you : First. That the Constitution of the United States confers no right or power on Congress to restrict any new State about to be admitted into the Union; Congress shall only guarantee to the State admitted a republican form of government. After the ad- mission of a new State into the Union the inhabitants thereof have an undeniable right as a free, sovereign and independent people to frame their own constitution or system of government, so that that constitution or system of government is not repug- nant to, or in conflict with, the Federal Constitution. Upon this branch of the subject we all agree (with the exception of some four or five). Secondly. With respect to the constitutional right of Congress to prohibit by law the introduction of slavery into the Territories of the United States there appears to be a diversity of opinion. A majority I think of the Legislature would say that Congress possesses no such right, even if the right was conceded, humanity to the slaves themselves, and sound policy would forbid the adoption of such a measure. It is contended that it never could have been the intention of the framers of the constitution, in relation to the power of Con- gress over the Territories, by using the words all “needful rules and regulations,” that Congress in its discretion might destroy the Territories. Slaves by our laws are considered property, and if Congress have the right to say we shall not carry this de- scription property with us, Congress exercising the same dis- cretionary power might say, with the same propriety, that no person who should hereafter migrate to any particular Territory of the United States should carry with him his horses or any Missouri Compromise. 21 other property which he might possess. Again, if Congress possess the power of restricting the Territories relative to the admission of slaves, might not Congress say that no person should become an inhabitant of any Territory belonging to the United States, unless he carried with him one or five or any other given number of slaves? Can it then be considered that Congress, under the language used in the Constitution above referred to, do any act by which the purpose intended to be subserved and pro- moted, would be entirely defeated. It is, moreover, contended that if a compromise of this kind be constitutional and expedient, it would lead directly to a dissolution of the Union, by giving an unjust influence in the National Councils, by which the Southern people would become the “hewers of wood and drawers of water” for those of the North. They will have it in their power to tax the whole agricultural interest of the South for the interest of their manufactures. They would have it in their power to legis- late exclusively for our property of every description, and, I have no doubt, from the language ascribed to Mr. King, would sound the tocsin of freedom to every negro of the South, and we may live to see the tragical events of St. Domingo repeated in our own land. I have thus given you a hasty outline of what I believe to be the views and sentiments of the present Legislature. I re- gretted very much to see that inordinate and unjustifiable passion prevail which took possession of many persons some weeks ago in this place, because I did not think the occasion required it. The Legislature will not, I suspect, undertake to express any further opinion upon the subject than that contained in the pre- amble and resolutions heretofore adopted. For my part, I have entire confidence in our representatives, and I am confident that whatever they have done or may hereafter do has been the result of pure and disinterested patriotism. You are upon the spot ; you have an opportunity of knowing the views, feelings and wishes of every section of the Union much better than those who are at a distance, and whose information is generally partial and im- perfect. I see the bill has passed your House uniting Maine and Missouri also restricting the Territories west of the Mississippi, N. 36° 30'. We have nominated the members of the Electoral College, which you will see in the last Enquirer. You will perceive that Judge Roane is not on the ticket; this was owing to the circum- 22 William and Mary College Quarterly. stance of his not being considered a resident of the county of Hanover. I expect we shall adjonrn on Wednesday or Thursday next. The deficit of the late Treasurer, as at present ascertained, amounts to the sum of $122,371.86. Present my respects to your brother, and accept the assurance of my undiminished confidence and friendship. L. Banks. From John W. Eppes. Buckingham, Hear Raines, May 3, 1820. Dear Sir: It seems almost too late to acknowledge the receipt of your let- ter of the 24th of March. The duties of friendship, however, are always fulfilled with pleasure, and when from accident or other causes we fail to perform them, our feelings never cease to re- proach us until the debt is discharged. During the present win- ter I have been occasionally severely afflicted with a pain in my head, whether nervous, gouty or rheumatic the physicians have not decided. At the moment of receiving your letter I was labor- ing under this dreadful affliction, which continued rather longer than usual, and my first monitor was your letter, which I had placed in my writing box for the purpose of answering. I have seen with great interest the difficulties with which you have been surrounded. Whether, as I advance in age, I become less sanguine I know not, but I have become strongly impressed with the opinion that a disposition exists in many to slide back into the old Federal notions of 1798, which brought our prin- ciples in jeopardy. It is in your power to render real service to your country, and greatly to increase your fame by reviving in their full force the true principles of our system. Nature seems to have bestowed on you the kind of talent peculiarly adapted to enforce and diffuse the great principles of civil liberty.
