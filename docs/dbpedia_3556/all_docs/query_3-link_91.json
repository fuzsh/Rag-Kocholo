Mother: NATALIE MOSHER (003) ( - ) Father: ROBERT LYNN GRISWOLD (002) (1924-1995) Note: Born at Herrick Hospital. Computer programmer, mainly on Tandem machines, though I like to program in PHP these days. Amateur genealogist too, with 4 genealogy websites. I'm also a musician, having been a guitar player once upon a time (classical mostly, studying with people like Michael Lorimer and Abel Carlevaro) and even a composer. I've been on college radio 2 or 3 times, even got myself on TV once. I have a Bachelor's in linguistics from Berkeley, where I studied the Indo-European languages. I'm good enough with German and French to claim a reading knowledge. Other interests include evolutionary theory including the ideas of Gregory Bateson, science generally, politics etc. ID: 002 Name: ROBERT LYNN GRISWOLD Sex: M Birth date: Feb. 13, 1924 Birth place: Cleveland, Ohio Date of death: Dec. 22, 1995 Place of death: Stockton, Ca. Age at death: 71 years, 10 months, 9 days. Mother: RUTH ESTELLA DUTE (037) (1891-1952) Father: LYNN DELANSON GRISWOLD (035) (1882-1982) Spouse: NATALIE MOSHER (003) ( - ) Wedding: 6/11/1949, Erie, Pa. Spouse 2: FAYE MARIAN NEES (006) ( - ) Wedding 2: 2/17/1969 Child 1: LEWIS LYNN GRISWOLD (004) ( - ) Child 2: FREDERICK ROBERT GRISWOLD (001) ( - ) Child 3: ROGER WALLING GRISWOLD (005) ( - ) For years a psychiatrist in private practice. Before that headed the San Joaquin County Drug & Alcohol Abuse Program, and before that did medical research, mostly on schzophrenia. He was sometimes mistaken by strangers for Orville Redenbacher, the popcorn king. No foolin. He had many interests. He would stick with a hobby for a year or two and then go on to something else. They included, in approximate chronological order, airplanes (he would go down to the Cleveland airport when he was a kid and watch the autogyros and airplanes take off), playing the saxophone (he was in a jazz band in high school, led by a guy named Fred Coke. You've heard of \"Swing and sway with Sammy Kaye\"? This was \"Choke and croak with Freddy Coke\". Then when I was a kid he gave sax lessons to one of Dr. Kimmock's sons, they'd get in the kitchen and blast away), stamp collecting, the Russian language, collecting postmarks from all over California (whenever we went on vacation he would send an empty envelope back home just for the postmark), making mosaics, building electronic components from kits, making beer in the basement, playing the recorder, an abacus (he used to do his checking account on it before calculators), the Spanish language, shorthand (he invented his own), hydroponics, playing the marimba, fractals, genealogy, growing little miniature cactuses, etc. He had long-term interests in Dixielnd jazz, photography (he had his own darkroom, and for a while he had a tiny little Minox camera, not much bigger than your finger. One time he was in Berkeley during one of the riots and took a few pictures. One of the young longhairs must have thought he was CIA and tried to grab it from him), travel (they did a lot of international traveling the last 20 years or so of his life), and computing (he learned Fortran way back, then later got an Apple II on which he did a lot of programming in Basic, then got a PC for his office. When I was a kid, before mainframes were common, he used to drive a stack of IBM cards from the State Hospital down to U. C. Berkeley every Friday to get them processed.) He also had some interest in languages - besides a sketchy knowledge of Russian and Spanish, he had to learn enough French and German, I think, to get his Ph. D. Mom says he also learned some Pidgin English when he worked at the hospital in Hawaii. He had some exposure to Latin, too, as did all educated members of his generation. He knew a guy once who went over to England to go to medical school. As soon as he got there, \"the professor gave him two books in Latin, and two weeks to read 'em. And he read 'em.\" He was a typical secular humanist and a scientific empiricist. He would do experiments on rats and stuff like that at work. He didn't believe in faith, he thought you should have independently verifiable evidence for what you believed in. He was an atheist - they never even went to church when he was a kid - but in later years he developed an interest in Taoism. Once when he was in the hospital he even put that down as his religion. It was probably the wierdest thing he ever did in his life. It's a good thing he didn't start dying, they would probably have brought in some priest with beads and rattles and a stringy beard. Concerning where his academic side came from, it's true that his father was an optometrist when he was a kid, but they seem to have been mostly lumbermen, harness makers and such on that side of the family. Probably it came from the Dute side - Uncle Glenn was the first Dute who ever went to college; I believe Cousin Lois was a top student; and Gust (born Anton August Dute) seems to have been named after his father's uncle Anton, the teacher in Rotenburg. Germans in those days took such relationships seriously. And Uncle Anton had both the name and the profession of his godfather Anton Gleim, a teacher in Ottrau. Plus the Dutes were probably Huguenots, and the Huguenots did a lot to spread French culture to other countries. Professionally, after working at Walter Reed in D. C. he came to Stockton State Hospital and did research on schizophrenia, publishing a few papers in technical journals, as well as being in charge of a ward called D-2, and another later called H-8, as well as maybe one or two others, which I've been told was quite an accomplishment for someone who wasn't even a psychiatrist. He did shock treatments, too, a duty which got him peripherally involved in a big mess at the hospital once, in which the main player was his boss Dr. Gunn-Smith. Dad was on administrative suspension for a little while, but in the end Dr. Gunn-Smith permanently separated from the hospital. Dad became a psychiatrist around the time Gov. Reagan closed down the mental hospitals, and after that he ran the drug abuse program at the County Hospital and then went into private practice working mainly with schizophrenics. Dad would sometines act as an expert witness in trials, and in his later years he was in the board of some corporation that did research. Politically he was a liberal Republican when I was a kid, until Goldwater changed the party (though years later I asked him and he had completely forgotten about this), then he was a Democrat for a long time, then he voted for Reagan for President twice (though I remember him expressing surprise when he found out his father had voted for Reagan for Governor). When I was a kid he was friends with a prominent American Communist named Steve Murdock, who wrote a column for the People's World newspaper. We also knew Jessica Mitford, a colorful semi-radical English lady who stayed at our house once or twice when I was a kid. She was going to give a talk at the University of the Pacific, but the President of the University wouldn't let her because she was suspected of being a Communist. (Years later this turned out to be true.) I was probably around 9 then. Dad was never a radical, but he was the kind of person who believed in the right to express unpopular views. This liberated side may be from the part of Ohio his mother was from - Oberlin College, where Cousin Valerie teaches, was the first college in the country to admit blacks, and the first to admit women. I remember the time in Santa Barbara when he had to lie to a cop. It was the 4th of July, and we were on the street up above Grandpa's house, setting off firecrackers. Some cop drove up and asked us if we'd been setting off firecrackers. Dead silence from Grandpa. So after a few seconds Dad had to speak up: \"No, officer, we haven't been setting off any firecrackers.\" The cop gave us a little propaganda about how setting off firecrackers is against the law, and it's a fire hazard and such, then he let us go and that was the end of the fun that night. I was probably around 10 or 12. He got appendicitis when he was in med school, and diagnosed it himself. He always had a scar on his abdomen where it was taken out. He was a lifelong asthmatic. Second Cousin Virginia McKalip: \"I remember as a child when we were growing up that Bob had severe athsmatic problems and that his parents did everything possible to find help for him.\" Dr. DiPolo in Stockton tells me that he had a lot of scarring in his lungs that they could never determine the source of. Cousin Lois, in a letter she wrote me 2/7/96: \"As youngsters we spent a lot of time together but even though we lived in the same area of Rocky River our lives went in different directions. He graduated from High School in 1942 and I graduated in 1947. \"It wasn't until about 1980 that I wrote to Bob and after that we kept in touch. He stayed with us on his trips here and it was great.\" She goes on to describe some of the furnishings of Grandma and Grandpa Dute's that she still has - a clock, 2 tables, a sewing machine and so on. Cousin Elizabeth Dute Cody, in a letter she wrote Dad on Thanksgiving 1995: \"Through your mother I came to know you. Your room remains in my memory since we frequently visited there while she talked of you. On your bureau was a most marvelous figurine which I believe you had carved out of soap, a 'see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil'. I've always had the hope that you had saved it.\" I don't think he did. \"Aunt Ruth spoke proudly of your many scholarly achievements both in high school and in college (Phi Beta Kappa, no less). I knew of your being in the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, graduation from Western Reserve as an undergraduate and from its medical school, and your internship at Queens Hospital, Honolulu. When Aunt Ruth died, I heard no more news of you.\" He was the valedictorian of his high school class, though I never found that out until I was going thru his stuff after he died. His bachelor's degree was in chemistry. (He said once he would have been a chemist if he couldn't have been a doctor.) He got his MD degree in 1949 from Case Western School of Medicine in Ohio. His post-graduate training included a year at Stockton State Hospital (7/69 to 6/70) and he did his psychiatric residency there from 7/70 to 6/72. Mariln Tyler ran across an obit for him from one of the Cleveland papers, in the \"G\" obit book at the Amherst Historical Soiety. It says he was director of research at Stockton State Hospital, which he joined in 1957 (that was the year we moved out here from Washington). \"The 1949 Western Reserve University Medical School graduate served his medical internship at Queens Hospital in Hawaii.\" He enrolled at Berlekey in 1950 where he got his Ph. D. in biophysics in 1954. \"Then, Dr. Griswold investigated burn shock as a staff member at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington, D. C.\" He had Q clearance there, which means top secret. This obit is much like the one that appeared in the Stockton Record (which I helped write, along with Lew and the rest of us - Lew knows some people at the Stockton Record). Marilyn says it probably appeared in the Cleveland Plain Dealer or Press, or even the Chronicle Telegram or Lorain Journal. They must have picked it up off a wire service. ID: 003 Name: NATALIE MOSHER Sex: F Birth place: Erie, PA. Mother: MARIETTA MARSHALL WALLING (011) (1897-1962) Father: LEWIS SAXTON MOSHER (012) (1896-1973) Spouse: ROBERT LYNN GRISWOLD (002) (1924-1995) Wedding: 6/11/1949, Erie, PA. Child 1: LEWIS LYNN GRISWOLD (004) ( - ) Child 2: FREDERICK ROBERT GRISWOLD (001) ( - ) Child 3: ROGER WALLING GRISWOLD (005) ( - ) Attended Strong Vincent High School in Erie, then majored in English at Allegheny College. This was during the War years, and when she got to college in 1944 there were 300 girls in her class and only 100 boys. She met Dad at a fraternity party. Their wedding was conducted by Rev. Cyrus Moorhead, son-in-law of Uncle Will Walling, in the house on Cherry Street where she grew up. After they were married they moved to Hawaii where she worked in a photography shop. When Dad was in grad school at Berkeley she was a receptionist at a psychological clinic there. She was secretary at Bidwell School for a couple years when I was a student there. After they got divorced in 1968 she moved from Stockton to Palo Alto where she worked for a few years at a hi-tech start-up run by Bill Odell (who was the son of Carey Odell, a Hollywood set designer whose name can occasionally be seen in the credits of old movies). After that went bust, she worked for various other Silicon Valley hi-tech places including as a secretary at Xerox for 10 years, mostly at the Palo Alto Research Center, one of the highest-tech places in the Valley. Currently lives in Menlo Park, Ca. next to Rog and Silvia. She was a kid during the Depression. She says some people didn't have enough to eat and literally froze in their homes during the cold winters right next to Lake Erie. The depression didn't really end until 1939 when the war started, and then there was rationing. Along about 1943 was when it got worse; nobody could get enough gasoline to drive very far, and Mom sometimes had trouble getting back to college at Allegheny in Meadville, only 45 miles away. Sometimes she would stop off with Uncle Ralph in Corry. It paid to know your butcher so maybe he would slip in a little extra meat; you might not even know what it was til you got home. (Mom continued this habit of going to a butcher store years later, she always got her meat from the Yosemite Meat Market in Stockton when I was a kid.) But they got plenty of eggs, they could always get a few dozen from Mr. Crossman out by the farm. Work was easy to find during the war, and she had one job in accounting making out payrolls, right next to the New York Central Railroad station, so at break time she was always treated to the dramatic partings and homecomings of soldiers outside. She said she also had a job modeling clothes in a department store, and another testing bomb warheads for the last 5 or 6 weeks of the war, and then suddenly the jobs were all gone. Mom grew up in Erie with Ann Bradford Davis, the actress who played the housekeeper on the Brady Bunch. Mom calls her Schultzie. We have a kindergarten picture of them. Schultzie had an identical twin sister, Harriet. Mom was practically the only person who could ever tell them apart. They were both good actresses, in fact the whole family were born performers, all you had to do was put a microphone in front of them. Mom says that in a few of the Brady Buch episodes she thinks it's really Harriet playing the housekeeper, not Schultzie. ID: 004 Name: LEWIS LYNN GRISWOLD Sex: M Birth place: Oakland, Ca.

Worked on one or two of the space telescopes when he was at Lockheed. Used to be in a rock band that played at Keystone Palo Alto. ID: 006 Name: FAYE MARIAN NEES Sex: F Birth place: San Francisco, Ca. Spouse: ROBERT LYNN GRISWOLD (002) (1924-1995) A patron of the arts. Has konwn one or two artists who achieved some recognition, notably an Australian named Kmit. Faye worked for years as an occupational therapist at Stockton State Hospital, starting on July 4, 1950 and going til April Fool's Day, I forget what year - in the 70's, I think. (Kmit, by the way, was a patient at the State Hospital. He was sent there for slapping a priest. Faye has a few of his works, one of which is a picture probably of Dad, and one of which is the first thing he made after coming to the hospital, a little painting on a piece of wood he made when he was sent to the woodworking room that Faye was in charge of. Faye says that one time Kmit saw Rog at the age of three riding his trike up California street, so he took him back home to Mom.) She is big on music too, Arthur Fiedler and that sort of thing (even though she says she doesn't like violins). She was also an amateur ballet dancer for many years. Her mother, whose maiden name was Harriet Lucy Foster, was a nurse. She was a great old lady with a positive attitude. Faye said once that she came out west in a covered wagon. (This was probably actually her parents, since the public records say she was born in CA.) She graduated from the UCSF School of Nursing in 1921 - the 1920 census lists Harriet Foster in SF, 21, student nurse, b. CA, father b. Ill, mother b. Missouri. Two years later she was working as an office nurse in San Francisco (\"The Nugget\", CGS's semi-annual mag, Winter '98). She grew up near Ashland, OR. Faye says she was herding the cows in one day when one of them got struck by lightning and killed. After that she would always run and hide under the covers at the sound of thunder. The SSDI has her death date as Jan. 1981, last rersidence Petaluma 94952, SSN 567-40-3640, born 7/13/1897. Faye's father, George Beatty Nees, whom I never met because he died not long after Dad and Faye were married, was big on art just like Faye. He took Faye and her sister Mary to the deYoung museum once (practically their second home; they lived a few blocks north of there, west of 19th in the Sunset district) to see a van Gough exibit. The people there were all amused by and making fun of the paintings. Faye's father told her and Mary to remember that day; he knew a good artist when he saw one. He fell on hard times during the Depression. He was an accountant, and he would get up early every day, catch the bus, and go out to look for a job, with little success. Faye says this gave her a lifelong thrifty attitude as a result. Faye remembers going down to the basement, seeing 6 cans of food on the shelf, and wondering whether there would be enough food to go around for the whole family. Faye says she had an uncle who was the most important person to her while she was growing up. Well, he wasn't actually a relative, but she called him \"Unc\". His name was Walter (?) Allen Reinhardt, a German Jew who went to MIT and became an architect. His last name was originally Reinhertz, but that sounded too Jewish so he changed it because of the persecution of the Jews in those days. He taught himself to play the piano well enough to go see a musical and come home and play all the music by ear. She thinks he met her mother when his father was in the hospital at the UC Med Center. He lived with them for a while. \"Unkie\" paid for a mastoid operation in Faye's ear when she was 15 months old which her family couldn't afford, and without which she probably would have died. A few words on Faye's in-laws. Faye's older sister Mary was a nurse for years, like her mom. She effectively retired at one point but would still take the yearly nurse's exam just in case. Finally she gave up on that, deciding she had better uses for the $50 they charged her to take the test. She and her husband Irv Fumigali live in Petaluma, in Sonoma County, the ancient ancestral homeland. Irv was a high school science teacher for years, when they lived in Daly City, but was able to retire rather early to Petaluma due to some favorable investments he made. Irv and his brother Guido were both in the Navy in WW II; Guido has his own record in this database. Irv and Mary have three kids: Peter, born about 1950; Tina, born 1954; and Gina, born about 1959. Peter worked once at a naval base in the North Bay, where he had a job making tools - he would actually make specially designed, one-off tools for specific purposes. Now he works at the Federal mint in San Francisco as a supervisor. He is divorced and has two daughters, the older of whom is named Danielle and the younger Alyssa. Tina got married and moved to Dallas, got divorced, and has two daughters, the older of whom is named Laura Faye. Gina got married to Kenny Ebertus and they run a produce business in Petaluma that Kenny inherited from his father Werner \"Vern\" Ebertus. Vern was a German immigrant who was in the German navy during WW II, assigned to the Bismark. He was an intelligent and competent guy, and he attracted the attention of an older officer who needed somebody to take notes of what he said every time he gave a talk somewhere, so Vern was transferred off the Bismark - lucky him - before it sank. Vern and his wife had, besides Kenny, a couple of daughters, and they all spoke German. Tina's father-in-law was a friend of Vern's, and also from Germany.

BROWN (080) (1859-1934) Father: RALPH KING WRIGHT GRISWOLD (038) (1854-1934) Spouse: RUTH ESTELLA DUTE (037) (1891-1952) Wedding: Second wife, actually Spouse 2: JESHER URIEL GARDNER (036) (1906-1973) Wedding 2: Third wife Child 1: ROBERT LYNN GRISWOLD (002) (1924-1995) Note: Grandpa Griz, AKA \"Pop\", \"Griz\", \"Big Griz\". Died on his 100th birthday, if you can believe that. Grew up in Ohio. Was born 3 years and one month to the day after his uncle, for whom he was named, drowned. Sometimes people in positions like that feel as if they have to live life for two, and he just about did that. He was also born 10 years, 1 month, and 10 days after his grandfather Delanson Griswold died. Had a horse when he was a kid. He wasn't a religious man, but he told me he went to a Disciple church when he was a kid. I have a note that says LDG was baptized at the Christian Church in Akron (Amherst?) Ohio, age 20-25. It also says LDG's family was Methodist/Congregational. (The Disciples of Christ, headquartered in Indianapolis, were started inadvertently in the early 1800's when their founders decided that there should be a reunion of all the different Christian churches. The other churches didn't necessarily agree, so of course they wound up starting another one.) He was first married at the age of 22, on 2/14/1904, Valentine's Day, in Greenwich, OH, to Lottie Schweitzer. (She was born in Greenwich, Ohio c. 1880. Her father sold hardware and buggies.) \"That lasted four years\", he told me and Lew. He never told Dad about it until about 1972. \"I didn't divorce her, I just left her,\" he told Faye and Dad. But his diary says he was divorced in 1913 in Conneaut. Then he didn't get married again til he was about 40, on my birthday, to Ruth Dute, my grandmother. After she died in the early 50's, he married Jess Van Kampen, a divorcee, from Macon, Georgia. She was about 25 years younger than him. He outlived her. When I was down in Santa Barbara once visiting Lew, Grandpa was driving us home and Lew asked him what a good age to get married was. He said 35. Lew found this amusing. Then Lew asked him how old he was when he had gotten married, and that's when he told us about his first marriage. This was sometime in the early 70's. Faye told me later that Dad first found out about it around this time. I may have known about this before Dad did. He never fought in a war. He said he was too young for the first, and too old for the second. He was talking about the Spanish-American War and the First World War. He had a good business head and did well for himself. He was an optometrist in the 20's when he got married and when my dad was a kid, which is probably where Dad got the idea to be a doctor (though he never had any interest in business). Grandpa went into the automobile title business during the Depression. (Dad says he was too much of a workaholic.) He made beer in a bathtub during Prohibition. He liked to travel - he went to every state except Alaska, and crossed the country 20 or 25 times. He lived in Santa Barbara when I was a kid - first in a suburb called Montecito, then another one called Carpinteria, then long-term at a fancy house on Portesuello Ave. I used to think that he and Jess were in Dallas the day Kennedy was shot, and saw Oswald run into that theater, but nobody else seems to remember anything about this. Politically he was pretty conservative, but maybe that's because he was born so long ago. Coolidge was his favorite president. He didn't like long hair. He said if your hair got down to your collar, it was too long. He gave up driving when he turned 90. He grew a beard when he was 95 - he'd had a mustache all the time I knew him, but he never had a beard before. He was a skinny and stiff-necked old man, with a high, stringy voice. The neck was because of an operation he had where a bone from his leg was transplanted up to his neck. He died in Stockton, Ca., at a little hospital next to Fulton Villa, the old folks home where he spent his last years, and was buried in Macon, Ga., next to his third wife, the one he apparently liked the best, though he was moved a few years ago to make room for one of Jess's brothers. It might not be a bad idea to move him up to Ohio someday, where there is an extra gravesite where his parents are buried. Regarding the Griswold house in Rocky River, Elizabeth Ann Dute Cody wrote on 11/25/1995: \"Am sending a couple of views of the Griswold house as it was in Sept. when I visited. No one was home but I talked to the neighbor on the south side who said that 'the house is in need of a lot of love'! It is owned by a man who is absent most of the year and leases it short term to various people -- no one doing anything to keep it up. There is a rumor that the owner will sell the house soon and everyone is keeping fingers crossed. Almost all homes in the neighborhood are owned rather than rented or leased, and owners seem to be young couples with large families. One sees many 'for sale' signs when driving through, and none of the homes are as well cared for as they were in your parents time.\" She also refers to Grandpa as \"a distinctly flirtatious man\". I remember he did have an eye for the ladies. He \"most probably pursued his pleasures on his own. I have nothing to support this, but I would have to be a poor judge of individuals and human nature to believe otherwise. His work required 3 - 4 hours a day and he didn't golf but he was never at home.\" And: \"Your grandfather was considered by many in the family as very debonair -- just short of a dandy -- always nattily dressed.\" This he had in common with my grandmother. \"He was the ascots-and-spats sort with perfectly trimmed mustache which looked funny to me because beards and mustaches in those days were unpopular unless your name was Hitler or Marx (bros.)\" I remember he always had a mustache, and he even grew a beard for a while in his 90's. And he always wore these little string ties. They were once the height of fashion. And, she says that he and his wife slept in different rooms. \"To my questioning, Aunt Ruth just said it worked out better that way (what a nosy wretch).\" I remember he and Jess slept in different rooms in Santa Barbara, too. His wife Ruth wrote the following about him on Tues., Jan. 18th, 1949 to Mom a few months before Mom and Dad were married: \"Dear Natalie - Yes, pop left a week ago Sunday for Florida. Had three telephone calls from him en route, besides several cards and letters, and I gather he is having a wonderful time. He found a small apartment in a motor court, even to kitchenette, and is having himself a time fixing breakfast and before-sleeping snacks.\" Here's a poem Grandpa wrote, an echo of the old oral culture that's mostly gone now. It is written on the back a couple of forms that seem to be left over from his automobile title business. He must have kept them around as scratch paper for 20 or 30 years. Faye gave it to me. It's written for \"Fay & Bob\". It goes: I wished for a peach and a peach I got, I think it came from your back lot. It was so good you should have them by the score then I would ask for more So let me thank this little tree and next year it may have two or three I think of you quite often too when using the napkin of blue Oh - nuts here I go for better or worse I just cant help but write in vese But the day will come when I get my se-nses thn (?) I can mend my run down fences Love Pop It seems to be about Faye's backyard, which is one of the leafier backyards in Stockton - lots of trees and apples and flowers and things like that. The \"napkin of blue\" probably refers to the color of Grandpa's napkin ring - Faye keeps track of everyone's napkin by giving each person a napkin ring of a different color. \"Pop\" is what Dad always called his father. ID: 036 Name: JESHER URIEL GARDNER Sex: F Birth date: Aug. 14, 1906 Birth place: Macon? Date of death: 1973? Place of death: Santa Barbara? Age at death: 66 or 67 Spouse 2: LYNN DELANSON GRISWOLD (035) (1882-1982) Note: Jess. Her SSN was 425-16-2026. L. D. Griswold's third wife. She was something of a religious fundamentalist, believeing that certain Biblical characters lived 200 or 300 years. She was a good grandma and liked to share her memories and things she knew - I remember her showing me where the Seven Sisters were. She told about the settlers coming out West - \"they had to fight the Indians, and those Indians weren't dumb.\" Her first husband's name was Van Kampen. I believe that marriage ended in divorce. She was a nurse once. She died in about 1973 and is buried in Macon. She was big on genealogy, and was a member of the National Society Magna Charta Dames and Barons. She has a daughter named Uriel - Jesher and Uriel are names of angels in the Bible, I think - who lived in St. Helena I believe, and another named Mrs. Mary E. Thompson. St. Helena is no more than an hour or so from Stockton, and she was always talking about it, but I never met that family until I was maybe into my late teens. Mary was her successor in the NSMCDB, and the last address they have for her is in Concord, CA. There is currently on Yahoo a Mary E. Thompson living in Concord. I vaguely remember Grandma and Grandpa telling about being in Dallas the day Kennedy was shot, and seeing Oswald run into the theater. Maybe it was them, and maybe it was somebody they knew. I looked in William Manchester's book \"Death of a President\" and could find no mention of them. This undated newspaper article was found in with Grandpa Griz's stuff. The headline is \"345 Persons Attend Tourist Howdy Dance.\" It says: \"LAKE WORTH - The Tourist Howdy Club had its largest attendance of the season at its weekly dance Wednesday night at the Casino ballroom. A total of 345 persions attended the Valentine dance. \"Dance winners included Miss Jesse Van Campen, Washington, DC, L. D. Griswold, Cleveland, Ohio;... L. D. Griswold was welcomed as a new member.\" There is a Lake Worth in Florida a bit north of Pompano Beach, where Grandpa Griz lived after he moved away from Cleveland.

She played Bach on the piano, the first prelude from the Well-Tempered Clavier and things like that. An old movie exists taken with her brother Bill's movie camera in Rocky River, Ohio, showing her, my father (her son) as a kid, Uncle Bill, Uncle Glenn, his girlfriend Dorothy Cox, Grandpa Griz, Cousin Lois, and various other people in Roaring 20's attire. She probably did not graduate from high school. \"I have looked up the graduates from Amherst High School and don't find her listed anywhere.\" Valerie, 5/9/2000. A picture I have of her with a group of other women all dressed in white (which was the custom in the summertime in Ohio) is likely to be from a commercial school, Valerie adds. \"They had one in Lorain.\" One source I have shows her date of death as 8/16/1952. She died of a brain tumor. He came home one day and found her passed out on the kitchen floor. It wasn't diagnosed until after she died. Valerie Jenkins: \"Ruth was a very pretty woman who always dressed fashionably. She worked at the steel mill\" - the same one where her father worked, I guess - \"as a secretary.\" She doesn't seem to have graduated from high school, though. \"Her first marriage was short-lived and no children resulted. Ruth played the organ in the Catholic church for a while. She later met and married Lynn Griswold, better knowm to everyone as Griz. Their only child, Robert\" - also called Griz - \"suffered from asthma to such an extent that their vacations were often spent in trying to find a better climate for him.\" Elizabeth A. Dute Cody says that after Uncle Glenn joined the family business, \"Ruth and Gris were now able to spend a month at a time a couple of times a year in Hawaii where they stayed at the Royal Hawaiian (for one of those years your father was in his internship at Queens Hospital). While on one of those trips Ruth became ill, was rushed home and very quickly died. I lost my wonderful aunt and mentor and Dad was devastated - this occurred only 11 mnonths after his and Ruth's father had died.\" From 5/7/1996. From her obituary: \"Services for Mrs. Ruth E. Griswold, a founder of the West Shore Women's Club and a former member of the Lakewood Women's Club, have been set for 3 p. m. tomorrow in the Zilch (sic) funeral home, Amherst, O. Burial will be in Ridge Hill Memorial Park, Lorain, O. \"Mrs. Griswold, who lived at 240 Argyle Road, had been a Rocky River resident for almost three decades. She died Saturday night in an Oberlin (O.) rest home.\" Cousin Lois: \"She was very neat and organized and was a stylish dresser. I spent time with her in my younger grade school years, but our families didn't do much together during the High School years and then she died in 1952.\" And when my Dad visited Lois he stayed in a bedroom that \"had the furniture that his mother used when she was single and living in Amherst. I got the set in 1954 and re-finished it and my daughter Donna used it and now her daughter Jessica who is 9 is using it.\" Dad, 9/27/92: \"My earliest memories are of a yellow house on Sloane Avenue in Lakewood, where my parents lived after their marriage. Mother found it difficult take care of me, as I was full of allergies and related conditions, and I naturally passed the miseries on to her, and she had to assume them, even though she was not well equipped to do so. The toll it took on her showed up in later years, I think. \"My evidence is thin, but I somehow have the idea that mother liked to party as a single woman, and that her life revolved around her job at the steel plant office, and the friends she made there. She was actually married before she met my Dad, to John Plato, but he died of tuberculosis within one year, so she was left a widow early in life. She was a pretty woman, judging by the photos I have of her. \"My mother had a secretarial job in Cleveland, in the office of Arthur H. Bill, M.D., a prominent obstetrician. She was very proud of this association, and she bragged about it frequently. Dr. Bill delivered me. Years later, when I attended medical school at Western Reserve, I found his portrait on the wall. An imposing figure he certainly was.\" My doctor, Frank Reynolds, went to Western Reserve, and remembers Dr. Bill. Dr. Bill invented an obstetrical instrument called the Bill Handle, which was commonly used for years by doctors. He also remembers Dr. Bill's son, who was also an obstetrician, though not near as talented as the old man. Cousin Elizabeth Dute Cody wrote to Dad on Thanksgiving, 1995: \"Have thought of you many many times through the years and was shocked to learn from Lois that you thought possibly I wouldn't remember you. Oh yes indeed! Though we seldom had any personal contact you may recall that your lovely mother rather adopted me and I spent many wonderful times with her. She began visiting us when we were living in Camp Hill in the 1940's. I was in a little ice show at Hershey and she came for that. She took me shopping and bought me clothes. I can still remember the outfits and how wonderful I felt each time I wore one. A number of times she picked me up and we went up to Le Bon Air at Old Forge in the Adirondacks. What a treat that was; our family never went on vacations. I believe she was driving a gray LaSalle convertible with red leather upholstery. As we were driving along, if she were going to sneeze she wanted me to hold the wheel. She didn't want to take her eyes off the road even for a split second.\" Cousin Elizabeth wrote me not long after Dad died. She remembers meeting Mom once for about 5 minutes when she was 11: \"Your grandmother seemed to feel that your mother was the perfect choice for her son. As always Bob did EVERYTHING to perfection. Natalie was very bright, vivacious, and a beautiful girl, I believe your grandmother felt that even she could not have made a better choice. She was ecstatic with the pairing.\" Then, written on Feb. 10, 1996: \"A couple of months ago I could not have written you a very honest account of your grandmother, my Aunt Ruth. Some of my impressions might have hurt your father's feelings, had he come across the information. Harmless as it is, I wouldn't have wanted to take the chance. \"One item, not included in the Dute history by Valerie Gerstenberger,\" - formerly Valerie Eppley Jenkins - \"out of deference to your father, concerns Ruth's musical talents. She played the organ at the old Catholic Church in Amherst. There was considerable gossip because Ruth always spent so much time practicing at the church while the priest was there as opposed to being in the rectory, I guess. Of course, had she been homely no one would have taken notice; but Ruth was a very attractive young lady who received considerable attention for being well dressed and blessed with large eyes, perfect skin, and light brown hair which was always neatly coifed. If there waas a grain of truth in any of the inferences, which was unlikely since such relationships were nearly impossible to keep secret in small towns, we'll never know. Apparently she never confided in anyone nor did she leave town, as was the custom, any time during this period. To do so have certainly proclaimed her 'guilty' whether she was or not. It has always been fascinating contemplating that there are some who are able to seduce the theoretically 'unseduceable'\". She could probably get on Oprah with a story like that these days. \"Ultimately, your grandmother married John E. Plato, one of the good Catholic boys in town who owned a business.... I asked your great-grandmother a number of things about Plato but she never would talk to me about him. Later I discovered that that was her habit with everyone. Poor Plato had the misfortune of being born into a family with the wrong religion. That made it an inappropriate marriage, and your great-grandmother was most relieved when Ruth married your father -- he was well liked.\" I guess she means grandfather. Cousin Valerie has a couple of comments relevant to this in a note she sent with a picture of John Plato's store on 2/22/2000: \"Aunt Lizzie had a fit when they were married because he was Catholic. \"I remember my family talking about how Aunt Lizzie thought Ruth had disgraced the family. Then, written on March 25, 1996: \"Your grandmother, Ruth Estella, was meticulous about her person. One could never imagine her in a house dress or work clothes. Slacks were not popular with the average woman of the day, and then of course she had a maid come in weekly and a man to take care of the yard so that may have been part of the reason she appeared so 'dressed-up' all the time. She always wore makle-up (attractively, not overdone) and jewelry and dressy shoes even to sit around home. My mother being 16 years younger was prettier at the time, but I always wished my mother could be as 'elegant' as my Aunt Ruth. I admired her for her class, sophistication, and refinement. I had the feeling she had always been so, even when your father was young; whereas my mother was the harried and frazzled Mom-type, the result of trying to keep up with two wild, boisterous kids (which your father was not), and one sickly child terrified of his own shadow. \"Perhaps this is why Aunt Ruth was such a movie buff (today she might have immersed herself in romance novels). What's more, she seemed to me to be somewhat obsessed with the lives of the stars and was always conveying the latest gossip from Hedda Hopper about this star and that. Her favorites were Fred Astair, Ginger Rogers, Vera Ellen (both were his dance partners), Gene Kelly, Montgomery Clift, Carey Grant, Olivia De Havilland, Vivian Leigh, Sir Lawrence Olivier and, her idol, Clark Gable. Not surprisingly her favorite movie was 'Gone With the Wind'. One time your grandparents were having dinner in a Hollywood restaurant frequented by the stars when she realized that Clark Gable was there. She, of the impeccable manners desperately hated to intrude for an autograph, but as she put it knew she'd 'regret it for the rest of my life' if she didn't.\" I've never seen this autograph, probably it doesn't exist any more. \"The way she told the story made me quite embarrassed for your grandfather. I always felt attuned to the unsatisfied side of this dynamic woman --I loved her so much--and wanted (not being sure myself what it was) a great love for her. Perhaps she knew that earlier, I surely hope so; she was in no way ordinary and surely deserved it and would have appreciated it.\" And again, on 4/28/1996: \"Your parents were, I believe, married at your grand-parents' home as was customary in the Dute Family; and it was attended by the immediate family only.... since only immediate family attended neither of the two uncles, Glenn and William, nor their families were invited. Our family was told that if we wished we could come by after the ceremony and see the couple off. We all dressed in our Sunday best and went over at the appointed time to find the bridal couple and her parents long gone. My parents were furious (to themselves, of course); at home I heard them discussing how they thought that your grandmother deliberately told us to come at a time when she knew everyone would be gone. This time it seemed as if she wanted our whole family hidden.\" I have five letters written to Mom by Ruth during the months leading up to the wedding. From the one written Tues., June 7, four days before the wedding: \"I haven't heard from Glenn yet, but doubt they will be able to make it on account of getting someone to baby-sit.\" On 6/20/96, Cousin Elizabeth writes about her being a fan of the Cleveland Indians. \"Although she never attended the games she never missed one on T.V. How she loved those Indians. Nothing could interrupt her viewing on the nights they were playing.\" Snappy dresser, too. Competitive, maybe. \"Oddly again (as with the movies) I got the impression that it was particular players rather than the game itself that interested her. The favorites were Bob Feller, Jack Lemmon, and #1 favorite, Lou Boudreau. Lou was my favorite, too. He was gorgeous. During the 7th inning stretch she would make us her favorite summer drink, a black cow (a.k.a. root beer float): several scoops of vanilla ice cream with root beer poured over topped with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry. By the time the Indians had won the pennant the summer of 1950 (I believe it was), I had gained considerable weight.\" Dad was always a root beer float fan, as am I. For a while he would go down to A & W Root Beer regularly in Stockton to get a gallon of root beer and make root beer floats with it. \"Aunt Ruth was also a big fan of Mel Torme, ('the Velvet Fog\" as he was called), a tremendously good looking guy who had a regular spot on T.V. He has been on the circuit ever since and after about 40 years I saw him for the first time this year. What a shock. He has not aged well.\" He looks like Nikita Kruschev to me. \"Her other favorite was 'Candid Camera' with Alan Funt. If you have ever seen any re-runs, you'll know that program was quite funny. As far as I know, those were her only T.V. interests.\" ID: 038 Name: RALPH KING WRIGHT GRISWOLD Sex: M Birth date: Mar. 18, 1854 Birth place: Springboro, Pa. Date of death: Jan. 2, 1934 Place of death: Conneaut, Ohio Age at death: 79 years, 9 months, 15 days. Mother: LOVINA G. BOYCE (081) (1831-1917) Father: DELANSON M. GRISWOLD (039) (1828-1872) Spouse: CAROLINE C. BROWN (080) (1859-1934) Wedding: 6/12/1881, Ripley, Ohio Child 1: LYNN DELANSON GRISWOLD (035) (1882-1982) He was a harness maker. He owned a shop where he sold harnesses and buggy whips and stuff. L. D. Griswold said he was born in Stoneboro, Pa., but his death certificate says it was Springboro, which is probably right, since there is a Springboro in Crawford Co., Pa., and it's not far from Conneaut, Oh. It also says his mother was Lavina Boise. This info was given by Charles Brown, who was on the other side of the family. An article about Lynn D.'s funeral in the Conneaut Reporter, 1879, says Ralph was living in Greenwich, Ohio then. Greenwich was where his future wife Caroline was living in 1880. I found in the Mormon IGI database the marriage certificate for Ralph K. Griswold and Callie C. Brown, ceremony performed on 6/12/1881 by Rev. A. C. Potter in what looks like Ripley in Huron Co., Ohio. Ripley is a township a few miles from New London, where Grandpa was born. Ralph Griswold is in the 1880 census for New London. He's 26, a harness maker, b. Pa., both parents b. New York, boarding in the house of John Wells. John Wells and his son Frank are both harness makers. He is listed in the 1860 census for Crawford Co., Pa, as age 7, and in the 1870 census for Ashtabula Co. Oh. as age 16. He's in Greenwich, Huron Co., Ohio in 1900: Griswold, Ralph, b. 3/1855 (sic), 45, m. 19 years, b. Pa., both parents b. NY, harness maker, home owned free; --------, Caroline, wife, b. 11/1858 (sic), 41, m. 19 years, 1 child, child living, b. Ohio, mother b. Maryland. The following news clipping, from usgenweb's Astabula Co. section, farm book 1, is undated but I gather it's from about 1908: TOOK FOUR GLOVES FOR SAME HAND A few days ago, a man wanted some gloves, and had no money, it is presumed, to buy them. So he entered the store of Smith & Griswold and stole, as he thought, two pairs of nice, warm gloves. But alas, he got four gloves, all for the same left hand. Messrs. Smith & Griswold say that if the poor man will be kind enough to come back, they will present him with the other four gloves. In 1910, Ralph's in Conneaut again: Griswold, Ralph K., 55, m. 28 years, b. Pa, both parents b. NY, harness maker, shop owner; --------, Caroline C., wife, 50, m. 28 years, 1 child (living), b. Ohio, mother b. Maryland. He's in the 1912 City Directory for Ashtabula and Conneaut (Sutro): \"Griswold Ralph K. (Caroline) (Smith & Griswold), h 582 Broad\". The business also has a listing: \"Smith & Griswold (J P Smith and R K Griswold), harness and carriages, 222 Washington.\" Parenthetically, the Kingsville Library sent me an ad from the 1895 Kingsville Tribune for J. P. Smith's carriage & harness shop. And there is in the 1897 phone directory for Conneaut a listing for the livery stable of Smith, J.P. (Ancestor Hunt, Nov. 2009 p. 131). And in Johnson's business and professional directory of 1902 on Heritage Quest is listed Smitt, J. P., Livery , 244 State, in Conneaut. There is no mention of RKW Griswold in these three sources, so he was probably still living in New London/Greenwich then. In 1920 Conneaut, they have Grandpa living with them again: Griswold, Ralph K., 64, renter, b. Pa., father b. Conn., mother b. NY, owner of a harness shop; --------, Caroline, wife, 61, b. Ohio, father b. Ohio this time, mother b. Maryland; --------, Lynn, 36, son, single (sic), optician, wage earner. Ralph was apparently a bit on the tall side. At least one picture of him still exists. Grandpa said he got up in the morning and made flapjacks \"every day I knew him\". There was a Ralph Griswold who was a charter member of a Church of Christ in Hartsgrove in Ashtabula Co. in 1929. It was a consolidation of some existing churches (\"History of Ashtabula County\", 1985, Sutro.) That's a bit distant from Conneaut, and I suspect it may have been another Ralph Griswold. When he died, he lived at 150 Poplar St. He died of myocarditis following a heart attack. He is buried in City Cemetery in Conneaut, in section B, lot 40, along with his wife and his brother-in-law Charles. His death seems to have been front-page news in the Conneaut News-Herald. It's right next to a story about Roosevelt needing to borrow 10 billion (sic) dollars. It says he had been a harness maker in Conneaut for 25 years. \"Besides his widow, he is survived by one son, L. D. Griswold, Rock\" - sic - \"River; one brother, Herman S. Griswold of Fredonia, N. Y., three nephews, Ralph and Frank Salisbury of Conneaut, and Owen\" - Oney - \"Salisbury of Detroit;\" - sons of his sister Mary Eliza - \"and five nieces, Mrs. Phil Risley,\" - Mary Eliza's daughter Agnes - \"Mrs. Ford Cody,\" - Lester's daughter Harriet, probably - \"and Mrs. Grace Lewis of Conneaut,\" - Lester's daughter - \"Mrs. Theron Gruey of Los Angeles, Calif.,\" - Lester's daughter Alta - \"and Mrs. Glen Bartlett of Warren, O.\" - Lester's other daughter Florence. The account of his funeral says: \"The pallbearers, all nephews of the deceased, were Frank Salisbury, Ralph Salisbury, Ford Cody and Phillip Risley\". No mention of his son as having been a pallbearer, or even at the funeral. Maybe he was off on one of his many travels. He must have been named after the Ralph K. Wright who's in 1870 Conneaut, p. 4: he's a 60-year-old farmer, wife Ann was born in NY, all his kids b. Ohio. He has a 12-year-old daughter whose name looks a lot like Lovina; in 1860 she's Mary L. They're in Conneaut in both 1860 and 1850. Daughter Florence must be the one who married Lester. All this implies a connection between the two families that far predates Delanson's move to Conneaut. He was a gadgeteer, like his son and some of his other descendants. He had one of those homemade crystal radio sets, which was probably a pretty high-tech item for those days. We have a book of poems which says, on one of the blank pages in front, in fancy handwriting which looks as if it was done with a quill pen: \"L. D. Griswold Esq.\" Was drowned at \"Kellies Island\" May 28th 1879 \"Presented to\" R. K. Griswold. In memory of his \"Bro:\"Lynn\" It's called \"Farm Ballads\", by Will Carleton. The name \"Call C Griswold\" also appears on one of the front pages (Caroline Brown), and it was entered according to an Act of Congress in the year 1873. It's full of homespun wisdom and phonetic 19th-century spellings. Many of the poems seem to extoll the virtues of the common man, as opposed to the educated elite. In \"Over the Hill to the Poor-House\", an old woman is describing her son's bride: She was somewhat dressy, an' hadn't a pleasant smile- She was quite conceity, and carried a heap o' style; But if ever I tried to be friends, I did with her, I know; But she was hard and proud, an' I couldn't make it go. She had an edication, an' that was good for her; But when she twitted me on mine, 'twas carryin' things too fur; An' I told her once, 'fore company (an' it almost made her sick), That I never swallowed a grammar, or 'et a 'rithmetic. The poem \"Johnny Rich\", about a man caught out on a stormy night, is on the subject of temperance: Ah! 'twas you then, Johnny Rich, Yelling out at such a pitch, For a decent man to help you, while you fell into the ditch: 'Tisn't quite the thing to say, But we ought to have let you lay, While your drunken carcass died a-drinkin' water any way. On the inside back cover, it says: L Griswold Esq. Conneaut Ohio Dec 25 1878 And, in what must be the original L. D.'s own handwriting: L. D. Griswold Conneaut Ohio I suoppose the original L. D. must have gotten this for Christmas, 1878, and then after he drowned next year it was given to his brother Ralph. ID: 039 Name: DELANSON M. GRISWOLD Sex: M Birth date: Dec. 8, 1828 Birth place: NY (Tyrone? Otsego?) Date of death: May 18, 1872 Place of death: Conneaut, Ohio Age at death: 43 years, 5 months, 10 days. Mother: MARY GAMMET (712) ( - ) Father: DANIEL GRISWOLD (762) (1787-1863) Spouse: LOVINA G. BOYCE (081) (1831-1917) Child 1: MARY ELIZA GRISWOLD (118) (1850-1932) Child 2: LESTER GRISWOLD (119) (1851-1926) Child 3: RALPH KING WRIGHT GRISWOLD (038) (1854-1934) Child 4: LYNN D. GRISWOLD (120) (1860-1879) Child 5: HERMAN SYLVESTER GRISWOLD (121) (1862-1957) He was a tailor in Conneaut, Oh. Listed in the death records of Ashtabula Co, Oh. at the Probate Court in Jefferson, which says he died of typhoid and spinal fever at 43 in Conneaut. May Colling can't find him listed in the tombstone readings for Conneaut. A look in Crawford County might be productive. The obituary in the Conneaut Reporter for May 23, 1872 says that he was a Mason and that \"He was one of those quiet, unobtrusive men and was a favorite with all his acquaintances.\" He had been ill for about 10 days with typhoid fever. (If you ever get a copy of this, take a look at the article next to it about the ax murder.) As for other obituaries, this article implies there may also be another one in another local paper; so I checked the Erie obit index which has nothing on him; but the May 2009 Ancestor Hunt has a list of the ACGS microfilmed newspapers, some of which may be worth checking. Elsie Berg at the ACGS checked the microfilm reel for Ashtabula, the closest town to the west, but found nothing. To the east, across the PA line, the Albion and maybe Springfield papers, and any newspapers in Beaver Twp., might be worth a look, too. Crawford Co. doesn't have him in their list of obits. William B. Moore checked the CCHS master obit file there for me and couldn't find him in any of the Meadville papers. He also checked the Conneautville Courier, just east of Beaver Twp., with no luck. He's not listed as a farmer in any of the three censuses he's in, a bit unusual for those days. In two of those he's living in towns. He's found on p. 128 of the 1850 census in the town of Orange, in Steuben Co., N. Y.: Delanson M. Griswold, 22, tailor, b. NY; Lovina, 20, b. NY; Mary E. Griswold, 5/12, NY. Now that town is in Schuyler Co. It would be worth a look in the land records in Orange for him. The Schuyler Co. clerk checked the 1855 NY state census for Tyrone and Orange and couldn't find him, but he seems to be gone from NY by then anyway. A deed of 11/20/1860 (see below) states that on 11/23/1853 Daniel Griswold and wife conveyed 105 acres in Beaver to Delanson. But if you look at the deed for 1/20/1858, what probably actually happened is Daniel first conveyed it to Charles, and then in 1858 Charles conveyed it to Delanson. On ?/1/1854 (wives' statements taken 3/1/1854, recorded 6/2/1854) Delanson, Lovina, Lester and Fannie of Beaver Twp. sold 66 2/3 perches of land in Spring Twp. to Ebenezer H. Hall for $110. That's about enough room for a house, maybe. (Notice that son Ralph was born in Springboro 3/18/1854.) On 6/3/1857 Lester sold some land (that may have included his store) which was right next to some land owned by D. M. Griswold. On 1/20/1858, he bought about 105 acres in Beaver for $2500 from Charles, recorded 5/17/1858. He was living in Beaver then. It was the same land Daniel sold to Charles on 11/23/1853. In 1860, Beaver Twp., Crawford Co., are listed two Griswold families right together: Charles Griswold, 28?, lumberman, pers. estate $1200, b. NY; June (?), 25, b. NY; Mary, 1, b. Penn; Carry, 3 mos.?, b. Penn. Delanson Griswold, 30, lumberman, pers. estate $2000, b. NY; Lavina, 29, b. NY; Eliza, 10, student, b. NY; Lester, 9, student, b. NY; Ralph, 7, student, b. Pa.; Lynn, 1, b. Pa.; Sylvester Boyce, 22, b. NY. Note the presence of Sylvester Boyce. That's where Herman Sylvester Griswold's middle name must have come from. Charles is probably Delanson's brother. (There is a Charles F? Griswold in 1870 Conneaut, but it's a different Charles - maybe the Charles T. Griswold of Camp Sheridan in Montgomery AL that Dave Whipple says his grandmother corresponded with.) Not only does Delanson live next to Charles P., but there's a whole group of deeds that indicate that the Griswold brothers, the parents, and maybe some sisters all lived right near each other. Note also that Delanson and Charles are both listed as lumbermen. My guess is the Griswolds, who came to PA in about 1832, shipped their lumber to NYC down the Erie Canal which had opened in 1825, giving a big boost to the economy of the Great Lakes and of New York. Now, in the Erie Directory, 1861/62, there is listed \"James H. Griswold, lumber and staves\". James and family are in the 1870 census for Erie, though they're not in PA. 1860 or 1880. James Henry Griswold died 2/8/1884, was born 10/17/1819, and is buried in Erie Cemetery. Evidence indicates they probably came from the family of Caleb Griswold, a hotelkeeper in Conneautville Twp., Crawford Co. Anyway, on 11/20/1860 Delanson and Lovina sold 105 acres in Beaver to Truman B. Welch for $2000 (recorded 4/1/1861) - same acreage, according to this deed, that he got from Daniel on 11/23/1853, but that's not quite right - that land had originally been sold to Charles for $1300, then Charles sold it to Delanson for $2500, so Delanson actually lost money on this deal. In the 1870 census for Conneaut Borough, p. 118, are listed: Griswolde, Delanson M., 41, tailor, worth $500, b. NY; Lovina, 39, b. NY; Lester, 18, harness maker, b. NY; Ralph, 16, b. Pa.; Lynn, 9, b. Pa; Herman, 7, b. Pa. Delanson M. Griswold purchased 1 3/4 acres in lot 3, Tp 14, from Miles and Lizzie Dorman on Jan. 18, 1872, for $900, recorded in Deed Book 82, page 612 for Ashtabula County. The land was bordered on the west by Broad St. and on the east by Harbor Rd. This was probably in the northeast part of the town, about a mile and a half south of the harbor. Delanson also took out two mortgages to Miles Dorman that day, for $200 each (mortgage vol 17 p. 328) a move which was to have dire consequences for his wife later on. Even though he died in 1872, for some reason his estate wasn't administered til 1874. There is no will, and there's no inventory or anything that says what happened to his estate but there are Administrator's Letters and an Administrator's Bond, in book 1, p. 206. L. G. Griswold was named the admistratrix of his estate on 7/15/1874 (must be Lovina), there was a notice about it published in the Conneaut Reporter, and she posted $1000 bond, and she, O. R. Goddard, and P. M. Darling were named appraisers of the estate, and their signatures are affixed to the Adminisrtator's Bond. Proof about who his father was is elusive. Looking at the land records and censuses in Crawford County - who he was living next to, who he transacted deeds with - Daniel Griswold b. 1787 is most likely. Other possibilitiies are Anson Griswold who was up north in Hopkinton, St. Lawrence Co. in 1830; and Gilbert Griswold b. 1803. His birthplace is a puzzle. His death record is hastily written, but a close look and a comparison to other words in the same hand on the same page reveals that it's Otsego, NY. Otsego was \"a lake, township and county which was a way station for Vermonters moving west, particularly lumbermen\", accoring to Robert French, GFA genealogist. Grandpa said he thought it was Tyrone, N. Y. (in Steuben Co. then; now it's in Schuyler Co.). Delanson's daughter Mary Eliza's death certificate also says Tyrone; this info was given by Agnes Risley, who was I suppose Mary Eliza's daughter. Another confirmation that he lived in Tyrone is that his son Lester's death certificate says Lester was born in Tyrone (though it says Tyrone, Pa. There's a Tyrone in Blair Co., Pa. Lester's entries in both the 1910 and 1920 censuses say Pa., though 1880 says NY. Is it possible he forgot what state he was born in? One of Mary Eliza's censuses says Pa., and another says NY. Most of Ralph's say NY.) Anyway, from the foregoing, Tyrone, NY would seem most likely. The problem is I can't find any Griswolds in Tyrone in 1820, 1830, or 1840, though Delanson does first show up in Orange in 1850, which was in Steuben Co. If Daniel was his father, then he was probably born in Otsego Co. in or around Milford. The evidence above for Tyrone can be explained as follows: Delanson's children all knew that their mother was from Tyrone, and Delanson did in fact live there before he moved to PA; and she outlived their father; so they jumped to the conclusion that he was from Tyrone too. But she herself was probably the informant for the info on Delanson's death record, and she knew the right answer. One fact about the origin of the name Delanson seems to argue in favor of the Daniel hypothesis. There is a town Delanson just to the west of Schenectady, not more than 30 miles from Milford. The town Delanson, NY apparently got its name from the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. (Interestingly, the name of the town is pronounced \"dee-LAN-son\", the same way Dad pronounced it.) Railroading was a very high-tech enterprise in the late 1820's. The Delaware and Hudson Canal Company was the first American company to order locomotives, from England, in 1828, the year Delanson was born. Maybe the Griswold gadgeteering spirit was alive even in those days. (On the minus side, the town historian in Delanson says the town wasn't started until 1892; and there's no post office there in 1850 or 1857.) As for other possible leads on Delanson's parentage, records from the Church of Christ that his family attended in Conneaut might still exist. O. T. Wyman was pastor there starting in 1862 - see \"History of Ashtabula County Ohio\", 1878, by Williams, p. 169 and p. 162. It was started in 1818, and was located in a couple of other places before moving to Buffalo St. in Conneaut next to the town house in 1841. The records from when the Griswolds moved to Crawford Co. in 1832 to when Delanson died in 1872 would be the ones to get. Today there is a Christian Churh at 448 W. Main Rd, but (e-mail of 10/14/02) that's not the one from Chris Wade's youth in South Ridge - rather, Chris thinks that the church where Gilbert Griswold b. 1803 may have been married is at 924 Center Rd., where the South Ridge Baptist Church or South Ridge Christian Academy is now. Other relevant Churches of Christ were one at Beaver Center, organized by Rev. I. R. Spencer in 1870, so Delanson may still have lived there; and it was preceded by one organized \"about 1840, continuing eight or ten years, with Elder J. E. Church as its pastor. - [Information furnished by Mr. Luther Gates.\" - this from the Gazeteer and Business Directory of Crawford Co. PA, 1874, p. 39. They apparently never built a church building. Notice that this came from a Gates, which means the Gateses must have been members of the same church as the Griswolds. There was also a Church of Christ at Portlandville, Otsego Co. NY, but it was organized in 1838, after the Griswolds moved out of there. Another possible lead on Delanson's birth: Ray Dute (5/25/01) sent me a file containing a marriage date of 8/17/1832 in Otsego Co. for David Mallory Gamet (son of Sophia Griswold) and Hannah Pember Hyde. If that's from a church record it might contain birth records and such. I looked in the IGI and it's in there; it's on film 458838, which is entitled \"Sealings for the dead, couples and children...\", done by the LDS Idaho Falls Temple, so it's probably some LDS church document. The name Delanson shows up as a middle name for four different people: his grandson Lynn Delanson Griswold, his son of the same name (actually all we have for him is his middle initial, so that's really just a guess), Frank Delanson Salisbury, and Ralph Delanson Salisbury. Whereabouts of Delanson M. Griswold: 1850, Jan. 3: Tyrone, NY (birth of Mary Eliza) 1850: Orange, Steuben Co., NY, age 22 1851: Tyrone (NY?

Mother: MARY ANN EVIE (125) (1835- ) Father: ARTHUR BROWN (124) (1835-1864) Spouse: RALPH KING WRIGHT GRISWOLD (038) (1854-1934) Wedding: Prob 6/12/1881, Huron Co. Child 1: LYNN DELANSON GRISWOLD (035) (1882-1982) Note: \"Callie\" Lived at 395 Beaver St. when she died of senile gangrene and senile dementia. Buried in City Cemetery in Conneaut. Regarding the birthdate, p. 74 of some records Dave Whipple sent me say she lived 1858-1934. Her obit says pallbearers at her funeral were \"Ford Cody, Paul Whipple, Ralph Salisbury, Frank Salisbury,\" - both were sons of Mary Eliza - \"Charles Risley and Earl Ahlberg.\" Her death certificate says her doctor was C. T. Risley. She's listed with her father in the census for 1860, 1 year old, born in Ohio. At age 7 in the record for her father's estate, she's listed as living in Huron County. I can't find her in 1870 Amanda. Her guardian was Wm. McDowell. According to her guardianship record, in 1872 he paid out for her: to Miss Jay (?), tuition in music $1.35 Paid for one pair shoes for ward $2.25 Dr Marvin for professional services for ward $1.00 pd to ward at Carey and ticket to ---- $4.20 pd for trunk for ward $2.25 (Carey is in Wyandot Co.) It also says she got a couple of bucks for the rental of some pasture, so maybe she owned some land. Mr. McDowell signed his name to all this, and then it says \"Affirmed to and subscribed before me this 2\" day of March AD 1876_ \", followed by the signature of the probate judge. The word \"Affirmed\" is written over the word \"Sworn\", implying Mr. McDowell may not have been a believer. This accounting was apparently in response to a summons also in the guardianship file: \"The State of Ohio, Hancock County, ss. To the Sheriff of Said County, Greeting: We Command You That you summon William McDowell Guardian of the estate of Eliza Brown and Caroline Brown if he be found in your bailwick, to return and file in the office of the Probate Court of said County, a true account of his guardianship of said estate of said Eliza Brown and Caroline Brown according to law, by the 25th day of February A. D. 1876, or show cause before the Court why an attachment should not be issued against him said Wm. McDowell. Herein fail not, but of this writ and service make due return...\" and it's dated 2/17/1876, signed by S. R. Huffman, Probate Judge. On the back of it, there's some handwriting that seems to indicate that it was transferred over to Wyandot County, with this note: \"Your fees will be forth coming as soon as I get a little pmt (?) out of the old fellow.\", signed S. R. Huffman. Apparently Mr. McDowell wasn't the ideal guardian, even in spite of the music lessons. In 1876 she (not her guardian) got $29 from the estate of Elisha Brown. Then from her guardianship record again: \"Received of Joseph Patterson surety on the bond of William McDowell my late guardian, the Sum of twenty eight Dollars and Sixty-one cents in full of the balance found due me, upon final Settlement of said Guardianship in the Probate Court of Hancock County Ohio.\", dated 8/22/1878, and signed Caroline Brown. She's in the 1880 census for Greenwich, Huron County, Ohio, as Caroline Brown, servant in the household of J. Bishop, 21 years old, single, b. Ohio, both parents b. Ohio. Amanda Twp., Ohio is her most likely birthplace. The censuses for 1860, 1880, 1900, 1910, and 1920 all say Ohio. Grandpa's family tree that he drew says it was Hagerstown, Md., but this census and her death certificate both say it was Ohio, and the informant for her death certificate was Grandpa. ID: 081 Name: LOVINA G. BOYCE Sex: F Birth date: Nov. 22, 1831 Birth place: Tyrone, New York Date of death: May 16, 1917 Place of death: Conneaut, Oh. Age at death: 85 years, 5 months, 24 days. Spouse: DELANSON M. GRISWOLD (039) (1828-1872) Wedding 2: 9/29/1879, Conneaut Twp. Child 1: MARY ELIZA GRISWOLD (118) (1850-1932) Child 2: LESTER GRISWOLD (119) (1851-1926) Child 3: RALPH KING WRIGHT GRISWOLD (038) (1854-1934) Child 4: LYNN D. GRISWOLD (120) (1860-1879) Child 5: HERMAN SYLVESTER GRISWOLD (121) (1862-1957) She was married three times. She died about the time America was getting involved in World War I. Her first name is spelled variously as Lavina, Lovina, Elvina, and Lavinia. Her last name is given as Boyce on her death certificate; as Wright in a hand-written family tree Grandpa did; as Boise in her son Ralph's death certificate; as Sebring in her daughter Mary Eliza's death certificate; and as Boyce on her son Lester's death certificate. And in 1860 a Sylvester Boyce is listed with her family. Boyce seems most likely. Her birthplace is given as Tyrone, N. Y. on her own death certificate, and on her daughter Mary Eliza's death certificate, as N. Y. in the 1850 census; and her son Ralph's death certificate says she's of Tyrone, N. Y. On her own entry in the both the 1880 and 1900 census, it's New York, and in 1910 it says Pa. Ralph's censuses consistently say NY. Her birth and death dates given here come from her death record. (The 1900 census says she was born 12/1829, though.) She was buried in Conneaut City Cemetery, by the Marcy Funeral Home. As for her parents, the 1880 and 1900 censuses seem to say they were born in New Jersey, and the 1910 census says Pa. There is in the 1840 census for Reading township, which is right next to Tyrone, a Leonard Boyce, in his 50's, 9 people in the house, including one girl between 5 an 10, who is the right age to be Lavina Boyce. In the 1820 census for Herkimer County (just north of Otsego Co.), in German Flats, there is a Leonard Boyce, with 3 boys under 10. One of them could have been the 36-year-old David Boyce, born in New Jersey, in the 1850 census for Reading. Maybe he was Leonard's son. (There was an Ira Boyce, son of Leonard and Mary Ann, buried in the Covert Baptist Cemetery, AKA the Old Covert Cemetery, 1/16/1835, age 3-4-11. \"Some Cemeteries Between the Lakes\", CGS.) There were also some Sebrings in Steuben County before 1850. She is listed with her husband Delanson as age 20 in 1850 in Orange, Steuben Co.; as 29 in 1860 in Beaver Twp., Crawford Co. Pa, and as 39 in 1870 in Conneaut. In the estate record of her husband D. M. Griswold, L. G. Griswold is named administratrix. That's the first I've heard of her having a middle name, but it must be her because she is named as the administratrix in the subsequent court action. Her signature, apparently in her own handwriting, is in it. There are two consecutive deeds for her in Ashtabula Co. deed book 88, pp. 221-223, both done 9/12/1874. They're for about 3 acres in lot 120 in Conneaut, bounded on the north by the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway Co., and on the west by Broad St. On an 1874 map I have, there is a place that matches this description pretty closely; there's some land bordering Broad St. owned by M. Capron and next to the L. S. & M. S. R. R. Co., which is to the east. It's within walking distance of the lake. In the first deed Orange F. Capron and his wife Caroline M. sell it to Lovina for $2000; in the second she sells it back to Caroline for the same amount. They're both quitclaim deeds, which means the seller does not guarantee the title; they are often used in the settlement of estates. Go figure. She seems to have fallen on hard times after her husband died in 1872. There is a deed recorded on 1/2/1875 for the sale of her house. The seller was the Sheriff. Apparently she was obligated to pay $816 by 11/27/1874 as a result of a civil action brought by Addie J. Graham, but she missed it, so they sold the house to the said Addie J. Graham, the highest bidder, on 1/2/1875 at auction at the door of the courthouse. It was 1 3/4 acres, apparently close to the 3 acres above. Hard to see why this had to happen, a couple of her sons were grown by that time. There is a record of the civil suit in Book 17 (apparently), p. 102-105 of the Ashtabula Co. records. The court action happened 11/23/1874 (21 years to the day after her father-in-law retired) before the Hon. Milton C. Campbell. There were three causes of action. In the first, it seems that Benjamin H. Kennon had taken out an 8%, $1000 mortgage on 5/17/1869 with Luman Kennon as the mortgagee, payable 5 years from 5/1/1869 (recorded 12/16/1869, v. 15 pp. 260 & 261). This must have been before Delanson owned the house. Then Luman Kennan sold the mortgage to Martha R. Blair, who sold it to the plaintiff. Four payments of $100 were made on it, but $685 was still due. In the second cause of action, Delanson had taken out two mortgages on 1/18/1872, both for $200, both to Miles Dorman (Ashtabula Co. records v. 17 pp. 328 & 329). The first was payable 5/1/1875 and the second 5/1/1876. No payments were recorded on them. Addie J. Graham bought these too, and $50 interest was due on them. In the third cause of action, the plaintiff says that she had to pay $18 for a tax certificate to protect her mortgage, plus she paid $125 to have the house blocked up and shingled. In addition, Lovina's dower interest in the property had been quitclaimed to B. J. Graham, the plaintiff's husband. The Sheriff served a summons to Lovina on 10/8/1874 informing her that she had been sued and had to answer by 10/31/1874. In a follow-on action of 11/24/1874 (Journal T, p. 240) she had still failed to answer, and in addition to the $816 she owed, $232 would come due 4/1/1875 and $244 on 4/1/1876; so the judge decreed that if in three days the $816 plus court costs hadn't been paid the Sheriff would have the house appraised, advertised and sold, and it was, for $1000. On 9/25/1879, a few months after her son died, she was remarried to Walker S. (or Walter B.) Bennett of Monroe Twp., a little south of Conneaut. O. T. Wyman did the ceremony. \"My dad pointed out an abandoned corner shop in Amboy, OH and he told me that it was the Bennett's gas station.\" - e-mail from Dave Whipple, 4/3/2000. In 1880, she's listed with him in Monroe. p. 511B: Bennett, Walker S., 62, farmer, he and both parents b. Conn.; -------, Lovina, 49, wife, b. NY, both parents b. N. J.; Lillie, 17, daughter, b. Oh., both parents b. Conn. None of her children are listed with her, but her youngest, Herman, was 17 by that time. Dave Whipple: \"According to the Ashtabula County death records, a married farmer named Walker Bennett from Monroe, OH died from heart disease on December 26, 1883, at the age of 66-years, 4-months, & 1-day.\" She married third James Stewart in Ashtabula Co. on 9/1/1885. The license was applied for by B. E. Thayer and issued to James Stewart and Mrs. Lovina Bennett of Conneaut. They were married by Rev. Myron Tyler in Conneaut Twp. Dave Whipple: James Stewart \"owned a rather large tract of land\" - so this was probably a pretty smart move, considering what had happened to her before - \"which ultimately included the residences of my grandmother (Hazel Risley Whipple), my great grandmother & her husband (Agnes Lovina Salisbury Risley & Phillip James Risley), her brother & his wife (Ralph and Mattie Salisbury), and the last home of Lovina Stewart who was living with Frank & Mary Salisbury.\" There are two deeds involving J. Stewart and wife which I haven't gotten the land records for, but the first is in the index, v. 2. p. 350: J. Stewart and wife sold M. E. Salisbury (that would be her daughter) 31 acres in lot 20, section E, with conditions (Conneaut bk. 152, p. 626,1/12/1899). In the second (index v. 3 p. 348) J. T. Steward and wife sold Jos. Tommer lots 37 and 41 in Crittenden Plat, 7/22/1901 (bk. 160, p. 563). This second deed seems a bit doubtful, though, since she was widowed by 1900 (see below). Dave Whipple can't find any record of James Stewart's death, but Lovina's obit says he died around this time. It would be worth looking for his obit. There is a James Stewart in St. Charles MN in 1880, b. ca. 1838 (Crawford Co. Genealogy, v. 32 #2 p. 83); and on p. 92 of the same mag is mentioned a James E. Stewart, son of Adam and J. J. Stewart. In 1900 she is listed as a widow in the household of her son-in-law Frank Salisbury in Conneaut, called \"Mother\". This could hardly have been Frank's mother, who was named Sarah and was several years older, so it is probably his mother-in-law. Her name here seems to be Lavina Stewart, and she is called Lavina Stuart in 1910, where she's living at age 80 with her granddaughter Agnes Salisbury Risley and grandson-in-law Philip Risley. And there's a James Stewart near the Salisburys in 1880 Conneaut, with wife Sarah E. and son U. Grant. The \"Conneaut News Herald\", 5/17/1917, says Lovina Stewart, \"one of the oldest and most eminently respected members of this vicinity passed away at her home on the Lake road at four o'clock yesterday afternoon\", of old age, at 86. Her third husband James Stewart had predeceased her by 16 years. All her children but Lynn outlived her, and all but Herman lived in Conneaut at the time. Services were conducted by A. E. Kemp of the Christian Church. She was buried May 19, 1917, by the Chas. Marcy Funeral Home in Conneaut City Cemetery. One of Lavina's sons was named Herman Sylvester. With her in 1860 is a Sylvester Boyce, 22, b. NY, seven years younger. The following tantalizing clue is found at sites.rootsweb.com/~usgenweb in an Astabula Co. Ohio newspaper file, probably from around 1913: \"Mr. and Mrs. Wilbur Peters have been spending a few days at the home of Mrs. Peters' parents, Mr. and Mrs. S. Boyce.\" One is also tempted to look for a Herman Boyce. In 1860 Caton, NY, which is due south of Tyrone on the PA border, there are: Harmon Bois, 29, b. NY, farmer/?lumberer Pattie A., 32, b. NY Wm., 4, b. NY John, 2, b. NY Sally Ackerman, 64, b. NY Harmon would probably have been a common pronunciation of the name Herman then. Notice he's the same age as Lavina, born in the same state, and has the same occupation as her husband. Harmon Bois also shows up on ancestry.com in the Elmira directories (near Caton), 1889-1893, as a laborer or teamster, at 422 Tuttle Ave. Neither Harmon nor Sylvester is anywhere in Pa. 1850, or Steuben Co. 1850. The closest I came was Harmon Boyce in Southport, Chemung Co. NY, 1850, age 21. That's right next to Caton and Elmira. Researcher Denise Griswold says there's also a Harmon Bois, age 26, with a Barney P. Griswold in 1855 Steuben Co. From her info and mine I tentatively reconstruct the following descendant charts: Samuel Griswold 1775-1844, of Apalachin-Owego, Tioga Co. NY + Hilda Willoughby Steuben Griswold b. c. 1800, prob. d. bef. 1830 + Maria Bills - Steuben was her first husband Polly Griswold Martha Griswold Belle (?Isabelle) Griswold Jake Griswold Barney P. Griswold b. 1824 in Tioga Co; in 1845 m. + Elizabeth Ackerman - sister of Patty Ackerman --- Bois + Maria Bills Griswold - Bois was her second husband Harmon H. Bois b. 1829? 1831? 1837? in Tioga Co. NY, d. 1898 + Patty Ackerman 1836-1901 sister of Elizabeth Ackerman William b. c. 1856 John T. 1859-1925, of Corning NY Isaac Ackerman Isaac Ackerman of Saratoga Co., then Owego, then Caton + Sally --- Elizabeth b. 1826 Saratoga Springs NY; m. Barney Griswold Patty m. Harmon Bois - 2 sisters m. 2 brothers Denise believes Harmon Bois and Barney P. Griswold were probably half-brothers because Harmon is called Barney's brother on the 1855 census. That's why she postulates a Bois as Maria's second husband. It is also possible that \"brother\" in the census really means \"brother-in-law\", because Harmon and Barney married sisters, but she doubts that because she doesn't think they were married yet. And she's not certain that Steuben was the father of Barney.

SALISBURY (694) (1878- ) Child 4: ONEY SALISBURY (695) (1885- ) Note: Lived in Conneaut. Oldest of her siblings. Listed as 3/12 (3 months) in the 1850 census for Orange, in Steuben Co., NY., and as 10 in the 1860 census for Crawford Co., Pa. Her marriage certificate, out of the Mormon IGI database, says Mary E. Griswold was married to Frank D. Salisbury on 1/31/1866, in Conneaut, by Rev. O. T. Wyman. She must have only been 16. Dave Whipple has one page which must be from the Salisbury Bible, listing the birthdates of her four children. In 1870, she's in the census for Conneaut, p. 108: Frank Salisbury, 27, fisherman; Mary, 20, b. NY. There were three other fishermen living with them. In 1880, she's in Conneaut with her husband Frank: Salisbury, Frank, 36, farmer; ---------, Mary E., 30, b. NY, father b. Pa, mother b. NY; ---------, Ralph D., 8, son; ---------, Agnes L., 5, daughter; ---------, Frank, 1, son. They also had a farmhand living with them. They were also living right next to Frank's parents, as well as Milo O. Salisbury and his family. In 1900, they're still in Conneaut: Salesbery, Frank, b. 12/1844 (sic), age 55 or 56, m, 34 years, laborer; ---------, Mara E., b. 1/1850, m. 34 years, 4 kids, all living, she and both parents b.

New Jersey? Also listed are two boarders. In 1910, she's still there: Salisbury, Frank D., 66, m. 45 years, first marriage; ---------, Mary E., 62, m. 45 years, first marriage, 4 kids, all living. In 1920, she's with her husband, still in Conneaut, still right next to P. J. Risley: Salisbury, Frank, 76, home owned free, farmer; ---------, Mary Eliza, 69. Her obit from 4/30/1932 says she died at home the previous Friday from an illness of two years. She was born in Tyron, NY and was widely known in the vicinity, having lived there the greater part of her life. She and her husband are buried in Conneaut City Cemetery along with Philip J. Risley in a lot owned by Frank Salisbury. There was a Mary Eliza Griswold born 5/4/1847, in Leroy, in Genesee Co., NY., but this was apparently a different one. Her parents were William Griswold and Lucinda Bannister. Maybe they were cousins. The IGI says she married Charles Martin Kelsey in Genesee 2/17/1870. ID: 119 Name: LESTER GRISWOLD Sex: M Birth date: Oct. 20, 1851 Birth place: Tyrone? NY? Pa? Date of death: Feb. 28, 1926 Place of death: Conneaut Age at death: 74 years, 4 months, 8 days.

GRISWOLD (685) (1891-1970) Child 7: HARRY S. GRISWOLD (686) (1893-1900) Note: Listed as Lesta in 1860 census for Crawford Co. Pa., age 9. Note: Also in 1870 census for Ashtabula Co., age 18. Harness maker, like his brother. First wife was Florence S. Wright (married by Rev. O. T. Wyman), second was Blanche Eaton, third was Ida M. Turner. 4 daughters: Alta, who was living in L. A. a few years ago; Florence, of Warren, Ohio; and Harriet and Grace, both of Conneaut. He also had a son Herbert who died aged 12 - 15, probably crippled. Lived at 159 Grant St. in Conneaut. According to the Mormon IGI database, Lester Griswold married Florence S. Wright on March 8, 1871, in Conneaut, Ohio; and they had a son Herbert E. Griswold, Oct 7, 1872, in Conneaut. His death certificate says he was born in Tyrone, Pa. This info was given by Grace Lewis, who was the above-mentioned daughter. His census records in 1880, 1900, and 1910 say he was born in Pa, as does the 1910 census for his daughter Alta. On the other hand, the 1870 census says he was born in N. Y., as does the 1920 census for his daughter Alta. His obit says Tyrone, NY. The evidence is inconclusive. In the Conneaut Church of Christ member list sent me by Elsie Berg, Lester Griswold is listed - see the record of Lester 1817-1899. He may have lived in Minnesota for a while during the 1870's, since his daughter Alta's birthplace is given as Minnesota in both the 1910 and 1920 censuses. An article about Lynn D.'s funeral says Lester was living in Greenwich then (Conneaut Reporter). Listed in the 1880 census for Greenwich, Huron County, Ohio, are: Lester, 28, harness maker, b. Pa, parents b. N. Y.; Florence, 26; Herbert, 7; Alta (?), 5; Grace, 6 mos.; Armena Wright, 29, sister-in-law, tailoress. All but Lester were b. Ohio. He seems to have married Blanche Eaton after Florence died in 1884. They had children Ada (1887-1889), Florence (b. 1891) and Harry (1893-1900) according to the Ashtabula Co. birth/death records Dave Whipple sent me, and Blanche is also listed as the mother in Florence's death record. Blanche died 12/27/1895 in Conneaut. In the 1895 Conneaut city directory, he's listed as \"Griswold Leslie harness maker 8 Marshall st\". (Ancestor Hunt, Nov. 97.) In the 1895 Conneaut business directory, he's listed under Harness Makers as \"Griswold, L., Washington st.\" (Ancestor Hunt, May 1999.) In 1900, he's in Conneaut at 8 Marshall St., with a different wife: Griswold, L., b. 10/1852 (sic; probably 1851), 47, b. Pa. (sic), no birthplaces for parents, harness maker, renter, married 4 years; --------, Ida, wife, b. 12/1858, age 41, m. 4 years, no children, b. Ohio, father b. Pa., mother b. Conn; --------, Grace, daughter, b. 12/1879 in Ohio, 20, single, press operator (?); --------, Hattie, daughter, b. 3/1883 in Ohio, 17; --------, Florence, daughter, b. 6/1891 in Ohio, 8; --------, Harry, son, b. 10/1892, 8, b. Ohio. The census taker wrote in 29 for the number of years Lester was married, then crossed it out and put 4. The 29 must be the total number of years he was married, meaning he was married to Florence and then Blanche for 25 years, and then he married Ida about 1896. No children are found from the third marriage. In 1910, he's in Warren, in Trumbull Co. (where his daughter Florence wound up), at 18 Riverside Place: Griswold, Lester, 57, b. Pa (sic), father b. Pa. (sic), mother b. NY, harness maker, renter, may have been in the service, married 14 years; \", Ida, wife, 52, married 14 years. Wife Ida had a sister whose obit is on the usgenweb Ashtabula Co. section in farm book 2. She was Iva J. Lane, nee Turner. It's undated but her sister in Warren survived her. In 1917, his mother's obit says he's in Conneaut. In 1920, he's still in Conneaut, at 159 Grant St: Griswold, Lester, home owned free, 68, b. NY, father b. Pa., mother b. NY, harness maker, shop owner. His obit, from the Conneaut News Herald, 3/1/1926, says he died Sunday morning of a heart attack at 11:30 AM at his home on Grant St. He had started over to his daughter Mrs. Harley Lewis's house but turned back and died shortly after. \"He was born in Tyrone, N. Y., on Oct. 20, 1851, the son of Delance and Lovina Griswold. Mr. Griswold came to Conneaut with his parents while very young and continued to reside here until his death.... He was one of the oldest business men in Conneaut, having managed a harness shop here all his life. When a young boy he studied that business under Henry Allen... In business as well as his daily life, Mr. Griswold was held in high esteem by all, his genial spirit and straight-forward character winning him many friends. \"He was a faithful member of the Christian Church of this city. \"Mr. Griswold was one of the oldest members of Evergreen Lodge No. 222 F. and A. M. and also belonged to the Protected Home Circle of this city.\" ID: 120 Name: LYNN D. GRISWOLD Sex: M Birth date: 1860? Birth place: New York or Pa. Date of death: May 28, 1879 Age at death: 18 or 19 Mother: LOVINA G. BOYCE (081) (1831-1917) Father: DELANSON M. GRISWOLD (039) (1828-1872) Note: Drowned off Kelleys Island in Lake Erie. Age 1 in 1860 Note: census for Crawford Co., Pa., & age 9 1870 census for Ashtabula Co. He was drowned off Kelleys Island in Lake Erie. He was drowned on May 28, 1879, and my grandfather, who was named after him, was born on June 28, 1882. His younger brother Herman, on the other hand, was born on July 28, 1862. The following obituary for him appeared in the Conneaut Reporter: \"A Sad Death \"On Wednesday afternoon a dispatch was received from Capt. O. F. Capron, of the schooner M. Capron, announcing the death of Lynn Griswold by drowning. Mr. Griswold seemed to have a presentment when he left, on the Monday previous, that he should never see his mother and friends again, as he bade all farewell with tears in his manly eyes. The details of the sad acccident are contained in the following letter from Mr. B. E. Fredericks, a fellow sailor, to his father, in this place: \"Kelley's Island, May 28, 1879. \"Dear Parent: \"With regret I take my pen in hand to pen you the sad tidings, which, no doubt, you will hear before you get this. It is a terrible blow to us all; it is terrible to think of. About one o'clock as we were nearing Kelley's Island, the men were lowering the small boat, as they lowered it, they lowered Lynn in it; as it was filling with water, we suppose he thought it was going to capsize, at least he let go and jumped clear from it. The mizzen boom penant was made fast to the bow which he grabbed, and towed along very well, as long as he could. After letting go of it he kept up about two minutes, but was drifting away. The small boat was filled with water, so the man could not skull fast enough to get to him. He got to him within about three lengths of the small boat when he went down to rise no more. It was about five miles from the Island. Please excuse this short letter, for I am so nervous it is impossible for me to write. \"Bert. \"Mr. Griswold was a most highly esteemed young man, and besides his family there are many who sincerely mourn his untimely death. He was an active member of the Conneaut Commandery, No. 1, U. B., and the first member lost by death since the organization of order in Conneaut At a special meeting on Friday afternoon, May 30th, a committee was appointed to draft suitable resolutions, which we print below:\" There follow a few paragraphs of sympathy to his widowed mother, his sister, and his brothers, to \"be published in the Conneaut Reporter and Conneaut Express\". There are no copies of the Conneaut Express extant, according to May Colling. I gather they lowered Lynn D. in the small boat from the schooner, but it had a leak in it, so he jumped into the water. He grabbed the pennant, but couldn't hold on, and the schooner sped away from him. Someone else jumped into the small boat and tried to row back to him, but the boat was filling with water so he couldn't row fast enough to get to him. (In those days not many people knew how to swim, that didn't happen til leisure time became common later on.) There is also a note about his funeral services, to be held \"next Sabbath at the Christian Church at 1 o'clock P. M. The sermon will be preached by Rev. O. T. Wyman.\" There is an account of the services from the same paper from June 12, 1879: \"The funeral services of the late L. D. Griswold were held at the Christian Church on Sunday afternoon. The family were met at their residence on Broad street by Commandery No. 1, U. B., and escorted to the church, which was filled to overflowing...\" No mention of where he was buried. The family tree Grandpa drew says he is buried on Kelleys Island. Also: \"Lester and Ralph Griswold of Greenwich, O., were unable to attend the the funeral services of their brother, Lynn, the 8th Inst., on account of the illness of Lester's wife. It is a great comfort to Mrs. Griswold, the children and friends to know that the body of the deceased was recovered and properly buried.\" Conneaut Reporter, 6/19/1879. Reading the Conneaut Reporter, there seems to have been a lot of petty crime in those days. Horse thievery and stuff. \"The post-office has been rifled of three or four dollars.\" And: \"Quite a row occurred at Ashtabula Harbor o"
