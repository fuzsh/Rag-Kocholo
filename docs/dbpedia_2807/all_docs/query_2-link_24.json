However,[2] Qureshi was instead given the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani.[10][12]\n\nAfter taking charge of the office, Qureshi immediately made clear that he was committed to establishing peace in the region and that maintaining friendly ties with neighbouring India were amongst his top priorities.[13] Qureshi went on his first visit as foreign minister to China in October 2008 with then Defence Minister of Pakistan Ahmad Mukhtar and then President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari.[14]\n\nIn 2011, Qureshi faced criticism in Pakistan when it was discovered that his son, Zain H. Qureshi, was working as a Legislative Fellow in the office of Senator John Kerry[15]\n\nIn February 2011, the Government of Pakistan reduced the number of cabinet seats[16] and during the transition, Qureshi was offered the position of Minister of Water and Power. He declined, saying that he was \"not interested in water and power ministry in place of foreign affairs.\"[17]\n\nIn February 2011, he lost the portfolio of Foreign Minister following the Raymond Davis affair.[18][10]\n\nIn November 2011, Qureshi resigned from the PPP where he had been for the past 20 years.

He said he did not want to be a part of Zardari league and announced to resign from the party membership.\"[19][20]\n\nQureshi is one of three prominent politicians from Multan District, the other two being the Yousaf Raza Gillani and Javed Hashmi (Multan II) and are considered political rivals to each other.[21] It was reported that Qureshi would re-join PML-N.[21]\n\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\n\n[edit]\n\nIn late November 2011, Qureshi announced joining the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) at a rally in Ghotki.[10][22][23][24][25] On 4 December 2011, he was appointed as the first Vice Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf[26][27] as its parliamentary leader in National Assembly of Pakistan.[28] In 2016 intra-party elections, Qureshi was re-appointed as the Vice Chairman of PTI, which is considered one of the three senior most positions in the party.[29] He was re-elected to the National Assembly from Multan in 2013 Pakistani general election on the ticket of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.[27]\n\n2018 general election\n\n[edit]\n\nHe was re-elected to the National Assembly as a candidate of PTI from Constituency NA-156 (Multan-III) in 2018 Pakistani general election.[30] Following his successful election, he emerged as PTI's nominee for the office of Speaker of the National Assembly. Reportedly, Imran Khan convinced him to take the office because of his long parliamentary experience. However, Qureshi showed reluctance to take the portfolio.[31]\n\nOn 18 August, Imran Khan formally announced his federal cabinet structure and Qureshi was named as Minister for Foreign Affairs.[32] On 20 August 2018, he was sworn in as Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs in the federal cabinet of Prime Minister Imran Khan.[33]\n\nOn May 21, 2021, while he was in New York City at an emergency session held by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 May to discuss a response to the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis,[34] Qureshi conducted an interview with American journalist Bianna Golodryga on CNN. During the interview, Qureshi stated: \"Israel is losing out. They're losing the media war despite their connections\"; Golodryga asked, \"What are their connections?\"; to which Qureshi replied, \"Deep pockets.\" before elaborating further: \"Well, they are very influential people. I mean, they control media.\"[35] Golodryga responded, \"I would call that an antisemitic remark,\" and the comment sparked controversy and a public discussion of Jewish stereotypes. [35][36][37][38]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 3 July 2020, Qureshi announced he had tested positive for COVID-19 days after holding high-profile meetings including one with U.S. special representative on Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad in Islamabad.[39][40] He eventually recovered.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
