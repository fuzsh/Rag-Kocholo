        "text": "Nawaz Sharif – who has served as prime minister thrice – on Thursday said Pakistan would have progressed and much better placed at a rapid speed, if the policies initiated by his government in 1990s were implemented without any interruption.\n\nAddressing a gathering at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he recalled that India had copied the policies introduced in 1990s – the first of his three tenures – and attained economic growth.\n\nThe then PML-N government helped businesses get rid of the vicious bureaucratic circles, Nawaz said about the trade liberalisation he had brought in Pakistan, which, he added, boosted the country’s national exchequer.\n\nOther countries of the world too passed through the same phases, he noted with reference to the transition from a planned government-controlled economy to free market where the people have freedom to invest according to the needs and profitability while generating competition.\n\n“We understand the economic hardships being faced by Pakistan,” he said, adding that rescuing the people from the current record-breaking inflation and poverty was their responsibility.\n\n“It is their right if the people demand development, [if they] demand education and health. The government is responsible for providing these services,” the three-time prime minister stressed.\n\nEXILED OVER DEVELOPMENT\n\nNawaz recalled that the PML-N was not ready to form a government in 2022, but saving Pakistan from default became a priority.\n\nThe resignation speech by Shehbaz Sharif, who was leading the ruling coalition, had been prepared, which checked himself, he told the audience – a development that didn’t happen but widely reported at that time.\n\n“We develop the country, [and] then face exile and imprisonment too,” Nawaz said about his repeated experience.\n\nHe noted, “We had committed injustices against our parliament and prime minister ourselves” and “then handed over the country to someone else” – a clear reference to those who deposed him and brought the PTI chairman into power.\n\nThe rupee, the economy, the entire system had been ruined as a consequence, which resulted in a fivefold increase in prices, he mentioned. The electricity consumer receiving a Rs1,000 monthly bill during the PML-N government was currently getting Rs15,000, the PML-N supremo added.\n\nSTRONG RUPEE\n\nNawaz said Pakistan jumped in ranking and was placed 24th among the world’s economies during 2013-17. “We kept the dollar [exchange rate] at Rs104 for four years,” he said and added that the dollar would have been available for Rs40 or Rs50 if his government policies were not interrupted.\n\nAbout the nuclear tests conducted in 1998, he said the Muslim nations had started trusting Pakistan as their custodian after he resisted the pressure and decided to go ahead the move, but the things went wrong since then and the country was begging for $1 billion.\n\nThe current state of affairs was a product of “the poor decisions that we took ourselves”, as “we shot ourselves in the foot”, he remarked.\n\nNawaz also mentioned that the policy [interest] rate during his government was 6 per cent only, which had reached 22pc. “Who can do business with such a high policy [interest rate]?” he questioned.\n\nSource: Dunya News\n\nWe are exiled for developing Pakistan: Nawaz Sharif\n\nSays everything is ruined from rupee to system, who can do business when policy rate is 22pc\n\n‘Shehbaz was ready for polls after Imran’s ouster’\n\nLAHORE: PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif said on Thursday former prime minister Shehbaz Sharif was ready to dissolve the coalition government to go into polls following the ouster of PTI chief Imran Khan in a no-trust vote in April 2022, but claimed the decision was changed at the eleventh hour because “we did not want to give in” to purported threats.\n\n“Shehbaz Sharif was all set to resign and he had prepared his farewell speech as well. But we refused to give in before threats,” the elder Sharif said during his visit to the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI).\n\nNawaz Sharif was talking about the ‘difficult decision’ to form the Shehbaz-led PDM government in April 2022 following the ouster of Imran Khan.\n\nIt seems Nawaz Sharif was referring to the ‘threats’ of a long march in May 2022 by Imran Khan. Besides, there were also reports that former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa had also advised the PDM to go into elections after removing Mr Khan from power.\n\n“We were not ready to come to power in 2022. …We then decided to move forward without any fear for the interest of Pakistan. We had to save the country from default,” he said and added that “we worked for the progress of the country but faced imprisonment and exile”.\n\n​\n\n‘Shehbaz was ready for polls after Imran’s ouster’\n\nNawaz says decision to dissolve coalition, go for snap polls was reversed at last minute because they didn’t want to ‘cave in to blackmail’.\n\nPML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Saturday held a meeting with US Ambassador Donald Blome in Lahore, discussing the current political and economic landscape in the country, with a specific emphasis on his party’s preparations for the upcoming elections.\n\nThe meeting between the top PML-N leader and the US envoy coincides with Nawaz’s series of public gatherings leading up to the elections next year, following his return to the country on October 21.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by PML-N, the US envoy called on the party leader, and their discussion centred on the importance of Pakistan’s relations with the United States, among other matters.\n\nThe statement noted that Nawaz shared his views on the political and economic situation in Pakistan, with a specific focus on his party’s readiness for the upcoming elections.\n\nIn his discussion with the US envoy, the former premier conveyed to him that “the people of Pakistan would once again place their trust in the PML-N to navigate the country through the numerous challenges it currently faces”.\n\nThe two leaders also delved into bilateral ties and collaboration on mutual multilateral concerns between Pakistan and the US.\n\nThe statement highlighted that both leaders “acknowledged the significance of a steadfast and robust partnership between the two countries.”\n\nThey emphasised the importance of exploring opportunities to enhance cooperation and building upon the successful outcomes that underpin the strong bilateral relationship between the US and Pakistan.\n\nThe discussion between the duo also encompassed various domains, including trade, economy, climate change, security, and regional stability.\n\nNawaz also raised the issue of the “plight of innocent Palestinians who are being mercilessly killed by the indiscriminate Israeli bombardment and imposition of siege around Gaza”.\n\nHe called for an immediate end to hostilities and urgent provision of humanitarian and medical assistance to war-hit people.\n\nSource:

Monday ordered the National Accountability Court to PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif to record his statement in the Toshakhana case.\n\nThe NAB was given until Nov 30 to record the former premier’s statement.\n\nThe case alleges that Nawaz, former president Asif Ali Zardari and ex-prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani received luxury vehicles and gifts from the Toshakhana — a government repository that stores gifts given to rulers, parliamentarians, bureaucrats and officials by heads of other governments, states, and foreign dignitaries.\n\nIn June 2020, an accountability court issued non-bailable arrest warrants for the former premier. Months later, Nawaz challenged the warrants in the Islamabad High Court but had withdrawn the petition days later.\n\nOn Sept 10, 2020, he was declared a proclaimed offender in the case, with an accountability court initiating the process to confiscate his properties and directing the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to make his arrest through Interpol.\n\nLast month, just two days before his return to Pakistan, the court suspended Nawaz’s perpetual arrest warrants.\n\nAt the previous hearing, the court had confirmed the PML-N supremo’s bail in the case.\n\nToday, pleader Rana Irfan and Nawaz’s lawyer Qazi Misbah appeared in court.\n\nAt the outset, Advocate Misbah urged the court to issue directions to the National Accountability Bureau on recording Nawaz’s statement.\n\n“A supplementary reference needs to be filed … a reference was filed in the absence of Nawaz,” he said, adding that “we want the NAB to record Nawaz’s position”.\n\nHere, the NAB prosecutor sought time to go through the petition. However, Judge Muhammad Bashir said: “What is the problem? Call Nawaz Sharif and record his statement.”\n\nIn his response, the prosecutor said only the investigating officer could record the statement. At that, Advocate Misbah asked the former for the questionnaire. “We will give the answers,” Nawaz’s lawyer added.\n\nThe NAB prosecutor then said there were no objections to the PML-N supremo recording his statement before the IO.\n\nThe hearing was then adjourned till Nov 30.\n\nSource: DAWN\n\nIHC to begin hearing arguments on Nawaz’s appeals in Al-Azizia, Avenfield references from Nov 27\n\nThe Islamabad High Court on Tuesday said it would begin hearing arguments on PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s appeals against his conviction in the Avenfield Apartments and Al-Azizia references from November 27 (Monday).\n\nThe decision was taken by an IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb.\n\nIn July 2018, and as the then prime minister, Nawaz was handed 10 years in jail in the Avenfield properties corruption reference for owning assets beyond known income and one year for not cooperating with the National Accountability Bureau, both of which were to be served concurrently.\n\nThe Al-Azizia Steel Mills corruption reference pertains to the case in which he was sentenced to seven years in jail on Dec 24, 2018. He was also fined Rs1.5 billion and US$25 million.\n\nNawaz was released from jail in March 2019, following which he left for London in November 2019 after the LHC allowed him to do so on medical grounds. The IHC had declared him a proclaimed offender in both cases in December 2020.\n\nNawaz then remained in London for nearly four years and only returned to the country last month. After his return from the UK, the PML-N leader had filed two separate applications for restoration of appeals against his conviction in the Avenfield Apartments and Al-Azizia references.\n\nHe had contended that while he was abroad for medical treatment, the pending appeals were dismissed for non-prosecution. The applications requested the court to revive the pending appeals for a decision on them on merit.\n\nLast month, the court had restored the appeals.\n\nAhead of the hearing today, Nawaz arrived in court amid tight security. He was accompanied by brother Shehbaz Sharif and an entourage comprising senior PML-N leaders, including Khawaja Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Ishaq Dar, Ayaz Sadiq and others.\n\nAs the proceedings commenced, Azam Nazir Tarar, Nawaz’s lawyer, said his client wanted to present arguments on the appeal against conviction in the Avenfield reference today.\n\nHow much time would you need to present the arguments, Justice Farooq asked, to which Tarar replied he would need four to six hours.\n\nThe judge also asked the NAB prosecutor the same question. In his response, the latter said he would need approximately half an hour. “Does this mean that NAB doesn’t want to say anything?” Justice Farooq asked.\n\nThe IHC CJ then stated that the court would begin hearing Nawaz’s arguments on Monday (Nov 27), 12:30pm.\n\nHere, Tarar urged the bench to hear the appeals on a daily basis as the cases dated back to 2018 and 2019. He further promised that he would not waste the court’s time.\n\n“If need be, we will hear the case on a daily basis,” Justice Farooq said, adding that regular division bench proceedings will be called off on the day of the hearing.\n\nThe judge also directed Advocate Amjaz Parvez to present arguments on Nawaz’s behalf and instructed him to prepare a summary of the case.\n\nThe hearing was subsequently adjourned till Monday.\n\n​\n\nDAWN\n\nOld allies tout fresh seat adjustment\n\nISLAMABAD: As the political arena heats up in the lead-up to elections, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman after a meeting with PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday announced that both parties have reached a seat adjustment agreement in a bid to cement their relations.\n\nFormer prime minister Nawaz Sharif called on JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman at his residence in Islamabad after making an appearance at the Islamabad High Court in connection with corruption proceedings against him.\n\nThere was no statement from the PML-N regarding the meeting between the two, but JUI-F chief Maulana Fazl said both parties have reached an agreement to contest elections together.\n\nMaulana Fazl told reporters that JUI-F and PML-N have decided to “walk together in future” as well.\n\nHe said previously both parties had put up a joint front against the PTI led by Imran Khan. “There will be seat adjustments with PML-N and the rules of the game should be fair and equal for all the parties,” he added.\n\nWhile calling himself and the PML-N leadership ‘mature politicians’, the Maulana said: “We will not make the upcoming election controversial; we will move forward together with the PML-N.”\n\nThough he did not mention if the seat adjustment would be localised or across the country, Rana Sanaullah, who heads the PML-N’s Punjab chapter, told reporters in Lahore that the party was in talks with the JUI-F for seat adjustment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nHe said the PML-N would also woo electables in south Punjab to strengthen its presence. According to Mr Sanaullah, the PML-N had won 34 National Assembly seats out of 46 in south Punjab in 2013 polls, and in the upcoming polls, the party was eyeing up to 40.\n\nHowever, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui said it was premature to say both sides had agreed to seat adjustments. “Mian Sahib recently returned to the country and wants to meet all allies of the past and even those which were not part of any alliance,” he said in a comment on the meeting. “We had good ties with JUI-F in the past and we want to cement them,” he said.\n\nSince both parties face criticism from the PPP, Maulana Fazl and Rana Sanaullah said they would not pay the PPP chairperson in the same coin, with the latter saying it would lead to bitterness between the two parties.\n\n“…Bilawal should not target the PML-N as he remained with it in the PDM government,” he said and added that the PDM was not an election alliance. Maulana Fazl said, “We will not adopt an extremist attitude against the Pakistan Peoples Party.”\n\n​\n\nOld allies tout fresh seat adjustment\n\nFazl says will move forward with PML-N; Rana Sanaullah says talking to JUI-F on KP alliance.\n\nNawaz denies ambition for fourth term, rejects 'greed' for power​\n\nIn a speech delivered at the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) workers' convention in Murree, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif asserted on Thursday that his political pursuits were not fueled by personal ambitions to reclaim power for a fourth term, Express News reported.\n\nThe PML-N supremo, a three-time former prime minister, conveyed his sincere desire to witness a positive transformation in the destiny of Pakistan. He explicitly stated his commitment to avoiding misleading tactics in achieving his political objectives.\n\nDescribing Murree as his \"second home,\" the former prime minister underscored the necessity of developing the region. He commended the scenic beauty of Murree and advocated for focused efforts on its growth, particularly highlighting the construction of a picturesque road from Islamabad to Murree.\n\nDuring his address, Sharif highlighted significant achievements from his tenure, including the addition of 11,000 MW of power to the national grid and the successful eradication of power outages through diligent efforts. He specifically pointed out the initiation of coal-based electricity production in Sindh, emphasising the veracity of his political statements.\n\n\"I don't lie for politics. We initiated coal-based electricity production in Sindh, completing projects left incomplete for 20 years.\" He highlighted the utilisation of coal mines in Sindh for power generation.\n\nBoasting about economic accomplishments, Sharif credited himself with rescuing Pakistan from default and transitioning the country from the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) grey list to the white list. He also mentioned successfully concluding negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and emphasised that the country did not seek financial assistance from any other nation during his regime.\n\nWarning against deceiving the nation for political gains, Sharif stressed that divine accountability awaits those who mislead. He emphasised the importance of thoughtful and truthful communication during electioneering, underlining the obligation to fulfill promises made during elections.\n\nThe former prime minister also reminisced about diplomatic achievements during his tenure, recalling the visits of two former Indian prime ministers to Pakistan. He referred to the visits of Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1999 and incumbent Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's surprise visit in December 2015.\n\nAdditionally, Sharif mentioned rejecting a $5 billion offer from the United States in 1998, seeking Pakistan to refrain from conducting nuclear tests.\n\nSource: The Express Tribune\n\nPML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Saturday said the PTI chairman didn’t come into power on his own as he was promoted to the office, adding that those behind imposing him on Pakistan were equally responsible for the current state of affairs.\n\nWhy RTS was shut down and election results manipulated in 2018, the three-time prime minister questioned and noted that the whole exercise was designed to place a person into power who knew nothing but abusive language.\n\nNawaz said they were neither defeated in 1993 and 1999 nor in 2017 – the years when his tenures ended prematurely – and noted that his governments had always been toppled without any reason.\n\nAddressing a PML-N workers’ convention, he questioned how a country could be managed when the prime ministers were removed arbitrarily. Pakistan would have been much better placed if his governments weren’t toppled and continuity of policies had been ensured, he said.\n\nNawaz listed the positives of his 2013-17 tenure when, he said, the country was moving forward with a lot of job opportunities and low rate of inflation as well as a substantial increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio, and remarked that it wasn’t just removal of his government; in fact, the entire country had been derailed.\n\nA prime minister elected by millions of people was kicked out of the office by five persons, he said about the five-member bench which sentenced and disqualified him in the Panama Papers case.\n\n“We cannot afford repeating the mistakes again and again,” the PML-N supremo said. “We have experienced injustices but have never and would never work against the country’s interests.”\n\nIn his speech, PML-N senior leader Khawaja Asif said Nawaz would be elected prime minister for a fourth term on Feb 8, adding that those trying to remove the three-time prime minister from politics had vanished.\n\nNot a single MNA of Nawaz’s party switched his or her loyalty despite all the hardships and political victimisation they had to face, he said and mentioned that there was a long queue of individuals requesting forgiveness over their past actions.\n\nSource: Dunya News\n\nThose who propelled PTI chairman into power equally responsible for the mess: Nawaz Sharif\n\nSays they experienced injustices but have never and would never work against the country’s interests\n\nPML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Saturday said the PTI chairman didn’t come into power on his own as he was promoted to the office, adding that those behind imposing him on Pakistan were equally responsible for the current state of affairs.\n\nWhy RTS was shut down and election results manipulated in 2018, the three-time prime minister questioned and noted that the whole exercise was designed to place a person into power who knew nothing but abusive language.\n\nNawaz said they were neither defeated in 1993 and 1999 nor in 2017 – the years when his tenures ended prematurely – and noted that his governments had always been toppled without any reason.\n\nAddressing a PML-N workers’ convention, he questioned how a country could be managed when the prime ministers were removed arbitrarily.

Infact IK lost 20 seats because of the connivance of Bajwa and ECP to create a weak govt. I dont often agree with @Mamoon but he pointed this out at the time\n\nNawaz resurrects 'Mujhe Kyun Nikala' narrative​\n\nFormer prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif, on Saturday, reiterated his \"Mujhe Kyun Nikala\" (why was I ousted?) narrative that he previously used at public gatherings after being removed as prime minister in 2017.\n\nHe questioned the panel of five judges, suggesting that by removing him in the Panama case, they achieved nothing substantial but to install a person, referring to PTI Chairman Imran Khan, who, according to Sharif, lacked political finesse and often resorted to below the belt verbal attacks against his political adversaries.\n\nAddressing businessmen and industrialists at two separate events in Sialkot, the three-time prime minister criticised what he perceived as his unjust removal by a panel of five judges in the Panama case. He contended that they turned a blind eye to the repercussions of ousting him.\n\nSpeaking at the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Sharif asserted that those responsible for installing Imran Khan as the prime minister bear equal responsibility for the country's perceived damages.\n\nHe questioned the capability and accountability of those entrusted with such responsibilities, especially in a scenario where prime ministers change frequently, and cases and punishments are allegedly fabricated.\n\nThe former prime minister emphasised that political stability is crucial for achieving lasting stability in the country, steering it away from political misadventures.\n\nSharif recounted spending a total of 14 months behind bars in what he described as a \"concocted hijacking case,\" facing a potential death penalty from a Karachi court in the year 2000.\n\nRecalling the events of October 12, 1999, when his government was removed in a coup led by the former military dictator General (retd) Pervez Musharraf, the PML-N supremo regretted the swift transition from being the \"prime minister in the morning to a hijacker by evening.\"\n\nHe lamented the impact of political misadventures on Pakistan's economic prospects and stressed the necessity of stability and adherence to the Constitution.\n\nWhile boasting his party's role in the country's economic progress, Sharif expressed remorse for handing over Pakistan to a leader, presumably referring to PTI chief Imran Khan, who employed abusive language and threats against opponents, allegedly contributing to the erosion of the moral fabric of society.\n\nHe recounted the tumultuous events of 2014 triggered by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s prolonged sit-in against his government, expressing regret over announcements made to forcibly remove the prime minister from the PM house. Sharif characterised this style of politics as new and unfathomable to him.\n\nLamenting the current economic conditions of Pakistan, Sharif remarked that a person earning Rs50,000 could not cover daily expenditures. He claimed credit for ending terrorism and initiating the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), highlighting achievements during his party's governance, including a growth rate of 5.8% alongside healthy reserves.\n\nNoting positive outlooks predicted by international financial institutions during his tenure, Sharif contended that Pakistan was on the path to becoming a developed nation. However, he argued that after his ouster, the PML-N government from 2017 to 2018 existed only on paper, alleging destabilisation started immediately after his removal in 2017.\n\nProudly acknowledging his role in making Pakistan a nuclear state, the PML-N supremo asserted that the country had become invincible during their tenure. He cited positive developments in foreign relations, including visits by Indian prime ministers, but expressed dissatisfaction with the subsequent PTI government, which, according to him, had adversely affected Pakistani society, morality, and the economy.\n\nSharif insisted that continuity was crucial for Pakistan's success and lamented the reversal of the policies he initiated that helped improve the economy in 2017.\n\nReflecting on the state of Pakistan during his prime ministership, he nostalgically recalled that the nation was beautiful and valuable at that time.\n\nPledging to restore the country to prosperity, Sharif vowed not to allow individuals he deemed unfit to govern, asserting that despite facing injustices, those who truly cared for Pakistan's interests would ultimately prevail.\n\nSource: The Express Tribune\n\nThe counsel for PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Monday informed the Islamabad High Court (IHC) that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had no option except to file references against PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif.\n\nThe statement by the counsel, Amjad Pervaiz, came during the hearing of Nawaz's appeals against his convictions in the Avenfield Apartments and Al-Azizia corruption cases.\n\nThe division bench is presided over by Chief Justice Aamer Farooq today along with Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb.\n\nIt was further stated that the accountability court had been given a period of six months to pass judgment on the reference.

He was also sentenced to seven years in jail in the Al-Azizia case.\n\nThe IHC declared Sharif a proclaimed offender in both cases in December 2020 after he left for London on medical grounds. He returned to Pakistan last month.\n\nIn July 2021, Sharif filed applications seeking the restoration of his appeals against his conviction in both cases. The IHC restored the appeals in November 2021.\n\nHearing\n\nThe hearing took place at the IHC by a two-member bench headed by Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb.\n\nAt the commencement of the hearing, Nawaz's lawyer, Amjad Pervaiz, presented his arguments before the court.\n\nResponding to the court's inquiry about the origin of the presented facts, Pervaiz clarified that three facts predated the reference filing, while the rest were subsequent.\n\nDrawing upon the Supreme Court's (SC) ruling in the Panama Papers case, which led to Nawaz's disqualification, Pervaiz reminded the court of the establishment of a joint investigation team (JIT) in response to the verdict.\n\nJustice Aurangzeb questioned the relevance of Pervaiz's arguments. In response, the counsel provided the court with details about the JIT's formation and members.\n\nHe informed the IHC that the JIT submitted a comprehensive 12-volume report to the apex court in July 2017.\n\nFollowing the presentations of the involved parties, the court issued its final verdict on July 28, 2017, disqualifying Nawaz.\n\nJustice Aurangzeb sought clarity from Pervaiz regarding the specific orders issued by the SC. He inquired whether the SC had provided directives to the NAB chairman.\n\nPervaiz affirmed that the apex court had issued explicit instructions to NAB to file references against Nawaz Sharif.\n\nHe specified that the SC had ordered references against Nawaz, his daughter Maryam, sons Husain and Hasan, and Captain (rtd) Safdar in the Avenfield case, while the Al-Azizia and Flagship references were to be filed against Nawaz and his two sons.\n\nThe lawyer emphasized that according to the apex court's orders, NAB was authorized to file supplementary references based on newly discovered evidence.\n\nJustice Aurangzeb delved into the events between the SC's order and NAB's filing of the references. He inquired whether all three references were filed on the same day, to which Pervaiz confirmed, adding that the filing occurred in September 2017.\n\nThe IHC judge further questioned whether the former prime minister was present in the country when the references were filed. Pervaiz clarified that his client was in the United Kingdom along with his daughter.\n\nJustice Farooq sought clarification regarding the indictment of the suspects. He asked whether the indictment was limited to the Avenfield reference or extended to all three cases. Pervaiz explained that the indictment occurred in all three cases on the same day, but the proceedings were handled separately at a later stage.\n\nPervaiz informed the IHC that the prosecution had withheld a copy of volume 10 of the JIT report. The chief justice expressed his surprise, stating that at least some details from volume 10 should have been presented during the trial.\n\nHowever, the counsel maintained that no document from volume 10 had been brought on the record, acknowledging that a few questions were answered during the interrogation.\n\nJustice Aurangzeb acknowledged Nawaz's acquittal in one of the references. The NAB prosecutor confirmed that an accountability court had acquitted Nawaz in the Flagship reference.\n\nJustice Aurangzeb inquired whether NAB had filed an appeal against the acquittal. The NAB prosecutor responded affirmatively, but clarified that notices had not yet been issued, and the case was not yet scheduled for a hearing.\n\nNawaz's lawyer, Amjad Pervaiz, contended that accountability Judge Mohammad Bashir had issued a verdict on one of the references, followed by a plea to transfer the remaining cases to another court.\n\nJustice Aurangzeb commented on the PML-N's request for a simultaneous hearing of all three references. He noted that the judge had swiftly concluded one case while staying proceedings on the other two.\n\nPervaiz questioned the accountability watchdog's reliance solely on the JIT report for filing references against Nawaz.\n\nJustice Aurangzeb expressed scepticism, asking whether NAB had exercised any independent judgment in the matter.\n\nPervaiz asserted that NAB's actions were limited to issuing a call-up notice to Nawaz Sharif.\n\nHe criticized the bureau for failing to present any \"concrete evidence\" beyond witness statements. He further argued that the call-up notice had no bearing on the investigation.\n\nJustice Aurangzeb sought confirmation from Pervaiz that NAB had not conducted an independent investigation.\n\nSource:

The PML-N on Wednesday broke into jubilation and heaved a sigh of relief after a stunning climax of the five-year case of the Avenfield reference, leaving the country’s political future potentially up for grabs for the party’s supreme leader Nawaz Sharif.\n\nIn a major development favouring the former prime minister, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday handed down an acquittal verdict in the case, removing one of the last remaining thorns on his way back to the office.\n\nA sense of festivity coursed through party's ranks as both Maryam Nawaz and Shehbaz Sharif as well as party workers exchanged sweets and chanted victory slogans. Talking to journalists outside the court after the major legal victory, Nawaz Sharif, a three-time prime minister with sights set on a potential fourth term in the upcoming general elections said, \"I had entrusted my fate to Allah.\n\nSimilarly, in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills corruption reference, I have also placed my matters in Allah's hands.\"Asked for his reaction to PTI’s decision to pick Barrister Gohar for the post of PTI chairman. Nawaz, after a brief pause, cryptically remarked, \"This is the nature of the system.”Nawaz Sharif's journey through the legal wrangle involved a significant period behind bars, encompassing 10 months and 26 days of incarceration spanning both the Avenfield and Al-Azizia Steel Mills references.\n\nThe Avenfield trial itself extended across 9 months and 28 days.During the hearings, Nawaz Sharif's presence in court was prominent, attending more than 100 sessions throughout the trial's duration, which witnessed a total of 107 hearings in the accountability court.During the proceedings in the IHC on Wednesday, Nawaz remained seated, attentively observing the court proceedings.\n\nOccasionally engaged in conversation with Ishaq Dar or engrossed in his mobile phone, he maintained a composed demeanour.As the proceedings concluded and the court delivered the verdict, Nawaz stood up amid congratulatory gestures from PML-N leaders and legal counsel. Later, supporters of the PML-N thronged outside the court, chanting slogans while lawyers joined in the fervour.\n\nMeanwhile, Nawaz’s brother and party president Shehbaz Sharif has also expressed gratitude to the judiciary for delivering justice. “Thanks to Allah that we’re seeing this day where my leader, elder brother, party, and family have been exonerated,” he added.Shehbaz said that his brother was innocent and the Almighty today has exonerated him of all charges.\n\nThe PML-N president concluded by commending Nawaz Sharif's resilience in the face of political adversaries, saying that even in life's bitterest moments, his leader never lost courage.Nawaz’s daughter and party’s Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz also hailed the court’s decision, praising the triumph as an example of resilience in the face of oppression.\"When a person entrusts his affairs to Allah despite enduring injustice, how Allah elevates that person in the eyes of the whole world is truly exemplary!

He said the investigation will now be taken further, for which some time was required.\n\nThe defense counsel informed the court that a questionnaire was prepared in 2019 but could not be provided to Nawaz because of his ill health. However, he said corresponding answers to the questions put forth had now been provided.\n\nHe added that the reference filed presents no record of the vehicle mentioned to have been returned, or any documentation proving the PML-N supremo had put in a request seeking any vehicle.\n\nThe court, faced with the challenges presented, inquired about NAB's course of action.

Current political landscape and mutual cooperation in the upcoming elections were discussed during the meeting.\n\nThe meeting, attended by prominent members of both parties, addressed strategic collaboration and seat adjustments during the upcoming polls. Among those present at the meeting were Shahbaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz, Rana Sanaullah, Saad Rafique, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Ahsan Iqbal, from the PML-N, while the PML-Q was represented by Salik Hussain, Shafay Hussain, Tariq Bashir Cheema, and Imtiaz Ranjha.\n\nDuring the discussions, Nawaz and Shujaat emphasised the need for cooperation in the upcoming general elections. According to insiders, PML-Q sought a substantial share of seats from the PML-N in Punjab. They said that Shujaat requested more than 10 National Assembly and 22 Punjab Assembly seats.\n\nShujaat's proposal for seat adjustments included requests for seats in Gujarat, Sialkot, Mandi Bahauddin, and Hafizabad. He argued that areas where PML-Q candidates were successful in 2018 should be adjusted.\n\n“We supported the no-confidence motion without any fear or greed; now we should be compensated accordingly,” sources quoted Shujaat as saying during the meeting.\n\nShujaat stressed the importance of not losing votes in Punjab to PTI, PPP or IPP, saying that unity would be beneficial for both PML-N and PML-Q. “Aligning with the PDM had led to differences within our family, but we have no regrets about our decision; we remain satisfied with our choice,” he added.\n\nSources revealed that Nawaz Sharif expressed gratitude for the PML-Q's support during the vote of no confidence against Imran Khan in April 2022 and subsequent cooperation. Both leaders also reminisced about positive experiences of the past as well.\n\nThey disclosed that a joint committee of the PML-N and PML-Q is expected to be formed in the next few days which will present recommendations on all seat adjustment issues to the top leadership of both parties.\n\nSource: Express Tribune\n\nSeat adjustments on cards as Nawaz, Shujaat meet after 15 years | The Express Tribune\n\nPML-Q chief seeks at least 10 NA and 22 PA seats in Punjab during meeting with PML-N supremo, say sources\n\nPML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Friday said his party does not desire to win elections and form a government but demands accountability.\n\n“The nation should know that those who used to cry ‘thief’ are thieves themselves, the biggest thieves. […] This is our demand,” he said at a PML-N parliamentary board meeting in Lahore.\n\n“Our demand is not to form governments after winning elections and then roam about in big cars,” the former premier stressed, saying that while the PML-N was determined to serve the country, it also wanted the truth to be brought in front of the public.\n\n“Who ruined the country? Who brought the country to this point today? Why are the poor starving today? […] All these things are eating up the country. There should be accountability.\n\n“We are not sitting here to get into government, we want the well-being of the country and the 250 million people living here,” Nawaz asserted.\n\n“Pakistan is going through a tough time today and we have created these difficulties ourselves. We punished the people who wanted to serve the country and brought forth those who were playing an evil game,” he claimed in an apparent reference to ex-premier Imran Khan.\n\nThe PML-N leader, without taking any names, said a person was brought to power who knew nothing about politics, economy or foreign policy. “He only talked about ‘Riyasat-i-Madina’ but didn’t know anything about ‘Riyasat-i-Madina’ in the true sense,” he said.\n\nNawaz went on to say that the “biggest corruption scandal in the history of Pakistan” was the £190m case and that there was “no doubt about it”.\n\nThe case alleges that Imran and Bushra Bibi obtained billions of rupees and land worth hundreds of kanals from Bahria Town Ltd for legalising Rs50 billion that was identified and returned to the country by the UK during the previous PTI government. Last week, the National Accountability Bureau filed a reference in connection with the case.\n\n“This biggest evidence is that they waved a sealed envelope [in a cabinet meeting] and asked for signatures on it. At least show us what is inside the envelope […] but they took approval by putting on blindfolds,” Nawaz claimed.\n\nHe further highlighted that the Supreme Court had recently ordered that an amount of Rs35 billion, which was remitted to the apex court’s bank accounts maintained in the name of the SC registrar in the Bahria Town settlement, be transferred to the federal government.\n\n“This was a huge theft and corruption,” he said. “On the other hand, we were sent to jail for not taking salaries from my son.”\n\nTalking about the cases against him, the PML-N supremo said he got justice after seven years and even today he was visiting courts. “There is a court certificate that declared these cases bogus. But who registered these cases? Will anyone ask them why they registered these cases?” he demanded.\n\nEarlier, Nawaz told his party workers that politics was truly about serving the country and doing something for the people.\n\nSource: Dawn\n\nPML-N demands accountability, not power: Nawaz Sharif\n\n“The nation should know that those who used to cry thief are thieves themselves, the biggest thieves,\" says former prime minister.\n\nNawaz Sharif: ‘Wanted better relations with India, ousted for opposing Kargil’​\n\nPakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Saturday said that he was ousted from the government in 1999 by general Pervez Musharraf for opposing the Kargil as he thought that it was important to have good relations with India.\n\n\"I should be told why I was ousted in 1993 and 1999. When I opposed the Kargil plan saying it should not happen... I was ousted (by Gen Pervez Musharraf). And later what I said proved right,\" Nawaz Sharif said while talking to the aspirants of his party tickets for upcoming polls. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supreme leader said that he was removed and that he did not know why.\n\n\"I want to know why I was ousted every time,\" he asked, adding, “We have delivered on every front. During my tenure as PM, two Indian prime ministers visited Pakistan. Modi sahab and Vajpayee sahab had come to Lahore.”\n\nStressing that Pakistan needed to improve relations with India and other neighbouring countries, he said, “We will have to improve our relations with India, Afghanistan, and Iran. We need to make more stronger relations with China.”\n\nNawaz Sharif regretted that Pakistan lagged behind its neighbours in economic growth development saying, \"The economy witnessed a downfall during Imran Khan's government (2018-2202). Then the Shehbaz Sharif government took over in April 2022 and rescued the country from default.\"\n\nHe also reiterated his demand for accountability of former military generals and judges for ruining the country by ousting his government in 2017 saying, “Those who brought this country to this level should be made accountable as patriotic people can't do this to their country. We do not want to come into power to roam around in luxury cars but we want accountability of those (who) ruined this country and made false cases against us.”​\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLink: https://www.hindustantimes.com/worl...sted-for-opposing-kargil-101702116041011.html\n\nHow much closer is Nawaz to premiership?​\n\nIn the wake of the Islamabad High Court’s decision to consider former premier Nawaz Sharif's appeal on merit in the Al-Azizia reference, uncertainties loom over his participation in the upcoming general elections, triggering concerns within the PML-N.\n\nInsiders have disclosed that the party's leading legal and political strategists are currently deeply immersed in discussions, exploring a range of options to surmount the last obstacle impeding Nawaz's journey back to power. The party is concerned that any potential delay might pose a significant stumbling block, jeopardizing his eligibility and leaving it hanging in the balance.\n\nOn Thursday, the IHC decided to hear Nawaz Sharif's appeal regarding his conviction in the Al-Azizia reference on merit. The move indicates the court's intention to delve into the substantive aspects of the case — examining charges, defences, evidentiary weight, and more — instead of focusing solely on procedural or jurisdictional matters.\n\nAfter the IHC's move to deliberate Nawaz Sharif's appeal on merit, he sought counsel from the legal team,” party sources said. In a briefing to Nawaz and other senior leaders, the legal team pointed out that despite Nawaz’s sentence in the Al-Azizia reference being suspended, his disqualification remains a looming concern. There's a fear that if the reference is deliberated on merit by the IHC, further delays might ensue.\n\nThe legal team stressed that a court order for PML-N supremo’s acquittal before the submission of nomination papers was critical. A prolonged acquittal process could result in legal complexities surrounding the nomination papers, likely to be challenged in court.\n\nExploring various legal avenues, they considered seeking interim relief from the IHC to facilitate the nomination paper submission or engaging other available forums, including the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).\n\nHowever, with the reference pending in the high court, the option of recourse to the Supreme Court remains inaccessible for the party at present.\n\nWith only 58 days left until the impending general elections and the ECP stipulating a minimum 54-day election schedule, experts anticipate the imminent announcement of the election schedule, necessitating the timely submission of nomination papers.\n\nSource : The Express Tribune\n\nPakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif on Monday reiterated his disappointment over the ousting of his government in 2017, suggesting that the 2018 elections may have been manipulated to bring the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) into power.\n\n“Nation wants to know what really transpired during the 2018 elections,” he remarked while addressing the party's potential candidates for the upcoming general elections after leading the parliamentary board panel in Lahore. Nawaz stressed the importance of rectifying \"mistakes\" for the nation's benefit.\n\nDuring the session, the former prime minister underscored the significance of ethical conduct, asserting that true honour comes from serving the people and prioritising the country's improvement over personal interests.\n\nNawaz claimed that in 2017, the country was on a positive trajectory, and there were expectations of PML-N's success in the 2018 elections. He suggested that their strong performance posed a threat to other parties' prospects in the polls.\n\nExpressing deep concern about the current state of the country, Nawaz remarked on its diminished global standing, saying, \"We should regret that we are one of the worst-performing countries in the world at the moment.\" He highlighted the dependence on imports and lamented that the country, built with great expectations, was facing economic challenges.\n\nNawaz emphasised the need for redressal, noting the impact of inflation on people's livelihoods, with many struggling to pay their electricity bills.\n\nOn Saturday, Nawaz focused on diplomatic relations, advocating for improved ties with neighbouring countries such as India, Afghanistan, and Iran. He emphasised that Pakistan's global credibility relies on amicable relations with its bordering nations.\n\nDuring the sixth session of the party's parliamentary board in Lahore, Nawaz recalled the Kargil war events in 1999, stating that his government opposed it. He emphasised that subsequent reflection validated the correctness of their stance.\n\nNawaz clarified that opposing Kargil wasn't a sign of weakness and underscored their commitment to tough decisions in matters of national interest, citing the example of conducting atomic tests despite opposition from world powers to make Pakistan invincible.\n\nSource: Express Tribune\n\nNawaz questions 2018 electoral ‘wrongs’ | The Express Tribune\n\nPML-N leader says nation deserves truth\n\nIn boost to PM bid, Nawaz Sharif acquitted in Al-Azizia reference​\n\nThe Islamabad High Court (IHC) Tuesday acquitted Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif in the Al-Azizia reference, in a major boost for the senior politician's bid to become the next prime minister of the country.\n\nThe biggest hurdle now for the three-time prime minister to contest the upcoming elections on February 8, 2024, is his lifetime disqualification as a parliamentarian, with the PML-N hopeful of a positive outcome in that as well.\n\n“It is unfortunate that if a former prime minister is facing such sham cases, then [we can’t imagine] what is happening to a common man,” senior lawyer Irfan Qadir told Geo News, calling upon the judges who convicted Nawaz to apologise to the nation.\n\nHe mentioned that it was the Supreme Court that had instructed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to file references against Nawaz in light of the controversial Panama verdict.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite the case being pending since 2017, the NAB prosecutor failed to provide any evidence against the PML-N supremo for having assets beyond means, noting that the reference was filed based on directions from the JIT — formed on the SC’s direction.\n\n​\n\nAn accountability court on December 24, 2018, sentenced the former prime minister to seven years in jail and imposed a fine of 2.5 million pounds in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills reference.\n\nNawaz had submitted an appeal against the decision of the accountability court, requesting the court to annul the imprisonment and fine awarded along with the conviction.\n\nIt may be noted that Nawaz has also been acquitted in the Avenfield Apartments reference, after the high court last month accepted his appeal on the conviction in the case.\n\nSource : Geo News​\n\nIn boost to PM bid, Nawaz Sharif acquitted in Al-Azizia reference​\n\nThe Islamabad High Court (IHC) Tuesday acquitted Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif in the Al-Azizia reference, in a major boost for the senior politician's bid to become the next prime minister of the country.\n\nThe biggest hurdle now for the three-time prime minister to contest the upcoming elections on February 8, 2024, is his lifetime disqualification as a parliamentarian, with the PML-N hopeful of a positive outcome in that as well.\n\n“It is unfortunate that if a former prime minister is facing such sham cases, then [we can’t imagine] what is happening to a common man,” senior lawyer Irfan Qadir told Geo News, calling upon the judges who convicted Nawaz to apologise to the nation.\n\nHe mentioned that it was the Supreme Court that had instructed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to file references against Nawaz in light of the controversial Panama verdict.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite the case being pending since 2017, the NAB prosecutor failed to provide any evidence against the PML-N supremo for having assets beyond means, noting that the reference was filed based on directions from the JIT — formed on the SC’s direction.\n\nSource : Geo News​\n\nWas it ever in doubt.

We made a tunnel in Chitral, but when the elections took place the people voted for someone else... why?” he asked, adding that his government had also set up a 2,200MW power plant in Sindh and also made electricity from coal there.\n\nDrawing a comparison between his brother’s development works in Punjab with those in Karachi, the elder Sharif said: “Why no progress is made in Karachi... not a single water project was completed while we had initiated the Green Line work there, but buses have yet to ply. On the contrary, Shehbaz Sharif had launched a metro bus project in Punjab and the Orange Line in Lahore.”\n\nAsking Karachiites to do some ‘soul searching’ ahead of the upcoming elections, he hinted that Shehbaz may be running for election from a Karachi constituency.\n\nIf Shehbaz Sharif does run for office from Karachi, it may be on the same Baldia Town seat that he contested in the 2018 elections. However, that time around, he lost to then-PTI leader Faisal Vawda in NA-249, which has now been renumbered to NA-242 in the upcoming polls.\n\nHis candidature was one of the points agreed upon with MQM-P leaders during a recent meeting. The party had planned to field Mustafa Kamal from the same constituency, but reportedly backed down after it emerged that Mr Sharif may seek to contest from there.\n\nParty sources told Dawn that one of the main reasons why Shehbaz Sharif may contest from Karachi would be to negate the impression that the city has never been important for the PML-N.\n\nThis is the narrative that has been built by their rivals in Sindh over the years, a source said.\n\nHowever, PML-N Karachi chapter general secretary Nasiruddin Mahmood has been quite confident for some time that the younger Sharif would contest from Karachi.\n\n“Mian Sahib is for sure going to contest from Karachi,” he told Dawn a few weeks ago.\n\n​\n\nNawaz hints at bringing ‘Shehbaz speed’ to Karachi\n\nRecounting Lahore’s development under younger brother, PML-N supremo asks why voters down south have \"ignored\" their party.\n\nNawaz censures judges for legitimising dictators\n\nLAHORE: PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday lashed out at judges for legitimising military dictators and taking action against elected prime ministers.\n\n“Judges garland the ones (military dictators) who break the Constitution, rather they legitimise their rule. When the parliament is dissolved and the prime minister is sent to jail, they (judges) endorse these actions,” Mr Sharif said while addressing the ticket aspirants from Faisalabad at the party secretariat in Model Town.\n\nNawaz said the judges allowed the military dictator to amend the constitution. “These are the reasons for the situation we are in today. No one else but we are responsible for this. Neither India nor the United States and Afghanistan are behind Pakistan’s miseries,” he said.\n\nThe elder Sharif also indirectly talked about former ISI chief Gen Faiz Hamid for what he said, pressuring a judge not to give post-arrest bail to him and his daughter Maryam Nawaz as their two-year ‘hard work’ would go waste.\n\nTargeting PTI supremo Imran Khan, Nawaz said he (Khan) never tired of saying that green passport’s respect would be ensured and New Pakistan be built.\n\n“But despite all his tall claims, it (PTI) could not win the 2018 polls and rigging was done through RTS to make the selected person PM. He was made premier with a margin of four votes and to arrange these helicopters and planes were used (to transport the parliamentarians),” the elder Sharif said in reference to sugar baron Jahangir Khan Tareen whom the PML-N used to lambast for using his aircraft to buy the loyalties of independent lawmakers.\n\nNawaz Sharif said the MQM and some parties (referring to BAP) and individuals were also sent by the establishment to the PTI’s camp.\n\n​\n\nNawaz censures judges for legitimising dictators\n\nSays MQM, some parties and individuals were also sent by the establishment to the PTI’s camp.\n\n\"This Is Not Done By India\": Nawaz Sharif On Pakistan Economy\n\nDuring a conversation with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) ticket aspirants, Nawaz Sharif, who is eying to become prime minister for a record fourth time, pointed out that he was ousted from power three times in 1993, 1999 and 2017.\n\nLahore: Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday said neither India nor the US were behind the cash-strapped country's miseries but \"we shot ourselves in our own foot\", indirectly referring to the powerful military establishment for its woes.\n\nDuring a conversation with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) ticket aspirants, the party supremo, who is eying to become prime minister for a record fourth time, pointed out that he was ousted from power three times in 1993, 1999 and 2017.\n\n“Today where Pakistan has reached (in terms of the state of the economy) this is not done by India, the US or even Afghanistan. In fact, we shot ourselves in our own foot...they (a reference to the military) imposed a selected (government) on this nation by rigging the 2018 polls that led to the sufferings of the people and downfall of the economy,” Sharif said.\n\nThe 73-year-old leader castigated the judges for legitimising military dictators.\n\n“The judges garland them (military dictators) and legitimise their rule when they break the Constitution. When it comes to a prime minister the judges stamp his ouster. The judges also approve the act of dissolution of the parliament...why?” he asked.\n\nThe Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz supremo lashed out at former ISI chief Gen Faiz Hamid for his role in ousting him from power in 2017. “A case has been opened in the Supreme Court against those (Faiz Hamid and others) who had said that if Nawaz came out of jail their two-year hard work would be wasted,” he said.\n\nThe PML-N leader, who returned to the country from London in October ending a four-year-long self-imposed exile, is the only Pakistani politician who became the prime minister of the coup-prone country for a record three times.\n\nOn Monday, Nawaz said that in 1999, \"I was prime minister in the morning and in the evening I was declared a hijacker. Similarly in 2017, I was ousted from power for not taking salary from my son.\" \"They (military establishment) made this decision as they wanted to bring their selected man into power,” he said, referring to his arch-rival Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf supremo Imran Khan.\n\nIn a televised address to the nation on Thursday last, the three-time former prime minister blamed the military establishment of 2014-17 for forcing senior judges to remove him from power.\n\n\"They (a reference to the military establishment) visited the residences of senior judges and threatened them.

He also listed the grand smear campaign “ruthlessly run with insults and threats by sitting members of the higher judiciary”.\n\nThe PML-N supremo talked about the baseless frivolous cases concocted against him, which were, at the time, even mocked by legal experts but were pushed through to persecute him anyways. But, Nawaz said, he does not seek revenge for all that was unlawfully, illegally, and unjustly done against him.\n\nThe former prime minister, however, emphasised that the unimaginable damage done to his country and the people of his country would not go unaccounted for.\n\n\"Those who made survival of honest, hardworking, patriotic Pakistanis, virtually impossible, would have to answer for their horrific deeds.

The papers, however, were initially cleared by the RO after she rejected the objections.\n\nThe PTI leader argued that the PML-N supreme leader had been disqualified for life by the Supreme Court and added the RO was not authorised to approve the nomination papers. But Mr Sharif was cleared.\n\nIn Lahore’s NA-122 constituency, the nomination papers of ex-PM Imran Khan were contested on grounds of his punishment in the Toshakhana case. The objector said the court had only suspended the sentence, not the conviction handed out to the PTI leader in the case. It was claimed that the approver was not a voter in the NA-122 constituency, which meant that they could not become an approver.\n\nMr Khan’s counsel contested the claim and said the approver was registered as a voter in the same constituency, but his name was removed from the rolls due to the new delimitation on Dec 15. The lawyer further said that the ECP could not punish anyone, adding that Article 62 and Article 63 did not apply to the former PTI chairman.\n\nIn NA-127, PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari was represented by Irfan Qadir, who argued that the person who objected to the nomination papers of the PPP chief was not a registered voter in the constituency.\n\nThe returning officer reserved the decision after hearing arguments. Ali Qasim Gilani, Lahore PPP President Chaudhary Aslam Gill, and others were also present at the hearing. Mr Gill is the covering candidate for Mr Bhutto-Zardari from the constituency.\n\nThe PPP leaders believed that the RO would set aside the objections because the person who contested the papers was not authorised to do so under the election rules.

He described him as drumming the beats of retreat rather than victory, signalling a step back from active participation.\n\n“Two drums that are beaten — either of victory or retreat — Fazl seems to be beating the drum of a retreat”.\n\nPreviously, he had labelled Nawaz as a \"ladla\" (blue-eyed) and accused the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the interim government of orchestrating efforts to secure a two-thirds majority for Nawaz Sharif in the upcoming general elections.\n\nNawaz Sharif, who returned to Pakistan on October 21 after a four-year self-imposed exile, expressed disinterest in seeking retribution and emphasised embarking on a new path towards progress.\n\nRead also: Aitzaz slams 'persecution' of Imran in cypher case\n\nCommenting on the ongoing confrontations between the PTI and the ECP, Ahsan criticised the election watchdog's persistence in pursuing the matter further.\n\nHe questioned the ECP's role, suggesting it should focus on conducting elections rather than engaging in disputes.

My politics started with Nawaz Sharif, and it will end with him.\"\n\nFormer federal minister Saad Rafique, speaking on the occasion, highlighted pivotal moments in the PML-N's history, such as Maryam's march towards the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), which signalled the party's enduring strength against political victimization.\n\nFormer defense minister Khawaja Asif dismissed criticisms of ancestral politics, asserting that young leaders like Hamza and Maryam have proven themselves through resilience, resistance, and a commitment to public service.\n\nMaryam expressed gratitude to Shehbaz, Asif, and Rafique for their generous words.

However, he has been acquitted in both cases by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).\n\nHowever, before the general elections in 2024, the SC will resolve the contradiction between the judicial decision and the parliamentary legislation on whether disqualification under Article 62 of the Constitution means for life or five years.\n\nSource: Express Tribune\n\nNawaz Sharif’s nomination papers for NA-130 challenged | The Express Tribune\n\nPetition filed with appellate tribunal, prays for rejection of Nawaz's nomination papers"
