        "text": "One of the most popular qawwalis of the sub-continent, Dam Dam Mast Kalandar, Ali Da Pehla Number….. Sindhri Da, Sehwan Da, Sakhi Shahbaz Kalandar, invokes the name of the Sindhi Sufi Lal Shahbaz. The verse demonstrates the mystic’s deep love for Imam Ali, which is inscribed on his grave : “I am a slave of Ali Murtaza.”\n\nLal Shahbaz’s name was Syed Usman Shah. He later acquired the title of Lal (red) due to his habit of wearing red garments, and Shahbaz, Royal Falcon, for his soaring divinity. Born to the mystic Syed Ibrahim Kabiruddin, Lal Shahbaz’s family drew their lineage from Imam Jafar Sadiq, a descendant of Imam Ali. The family came from Sistan, an Iranian province that borders Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nOverwhelmingly adored alike by Hindus and Muslims of Sind, Lal Shahbaz arrived in Multan in 1263, eventually settling in Sehwan, a famous centre of learning. The earlier name for Sehwan was Sivistan, the city of Lord Shiva. Lal Shahbaz settled on the outskirts of the town for six years during which he provided spiritual guidance to thousands of people.\n\nLal Shahbaz resided at the site of an old Shiv temple on the west bank of the Indus. He made his home in a hollow tree trunk where he performed his ascetic exercises. The area now a walled-garden, is known as Lal Bagh, whose sweet water springs that irrigate it are attributed to the miracles of Lal Shahbaz. He encouraged his followers to use dance as a way of achieving spiritual ecstasy, a tradition still followed at is dragah, accompanied with dhamaal and drums.\n\nLal Shahbaz live during the age of the famous Sufis including Baba Farid of Ajodhan, Shaykh Bahauddin Zakariya of Multan, and Jalaluddin Bukhari of Uch. They remained close friends and came to be called “chaar yaar” —— the four companions.\n\nLal Shahbaz claimed to be the spiritual disciple of Mansur Hallaj, the 10th century martyred mystic pot of Baghdad. An erudite scholar, Lal Shahbaz was fluent in Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit and Sindhi. Several books in Persian and Arabic poetry and on philology are attributed to him. Later, Sindhi mystics, including Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, Makhdoom Bilawal, Sachal Sarmast and Qadir Bakhsh Bedil, were devout followers of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. He died in 1274 AD and a stunning mausoleum with Sindhi tiles, mirror work and gold-plated doors stands over his grave.\n\nThe Hindus lovingly address Lal Shahbaz as “Jhule Lal”, Lord of the Indus River. Even now, at the annual Urs, one of the old caretakers, a Hindu, performs the inaugural ritual for the annual festivities. Despite the Partition of India, the environment of Sehwan Sharif is an extraordinary demonstration of Hindu-Muslim syncretism of the sub-continent.\n\n———— Sadia Dehlvi\n\nEid-ul-Adha, literally means ‘festival of sacrifice’. Here, animal sacrifice is only symbolic. Real sacrifice is to be made by the people of faith themselves.. The Quran refers to a historical event, as a role model for this act of sacrifice. Prophet Abraham sacrificed an animal, but it was a symbolic sacrifice. The real sacrifice, on his part, was that he dedicated his son, for a peaceful mission. This mission is referred in the Quran as zibh azeem (37:107). It means GREAT SACRIFICE, but Prophet Abraham never slaughtered his son; he only dedicated his son for a purpose, that is, to live in a desert and to produce a new peaceful generation that is called Banu Ismail (Children of Ismail). Celebrating this event annually, means that the faithful should pledge to follow the example of Ismail.\n\nMuslims ritually sacrifice an animal, but the real purpose is to pledge that we will dedicate ourselves to a peaceful divine mission. Eid-ul-Adha is a day of pledge for a dedicated life rather than a day of some ritual act. At present, the greatest need for the divine mission , is to remove the misunderstandings developed about the religion of Islam, that is, thinking Islam to be a religion of violence. This is the zibh azeem for the present times.\n\nEid-ul-Fitr is celebrated at the end of a full month of fasting —- Ramzan. The purpose is to train Muslims to live a self-restrained life. After the completion of this period, they celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr as SHUKR; that is to acknowledge God’s help for being able to complete this month of training. On the other hand, Eid-ul-Adha is for inculcating the spirit of dedication for the peaceful Islamic cause. In Eid-ul-Fitr, the role model is Prophet Muhammad. And the model of Eid-ul-Adha is Prophet Abraham. Eid-ul-Fitr reflects the spirit of SABR (patience), while Eid-ul-Adha reflects the spirit of SACRIFICE. Both are equally important for the daily life of a faithful person.\n\nThe Quran refers to Prophet Abraham, as an exemplary character for the faithful. The Quran reminds Muslims of how Prophet Abraham, along with his family, dedicated his life for the peaceful divine mission. Muslims are required to remember this example of Eid-ul-Adha every year and pledge to follow it. ——–Maulana Wahiuddin Khan.\n\nM. Rajaque Rahman writes, “Prophet Abraham was ready to sacrifice something very dear to him. For Ibrahim (Abraham) Ismail was not just a son, but the most loved possession of an old father. Ibrahim was confronted with an internal conflict to choose between God and his only son. The moment he overcame his attachment and selfish feelings, God saved Ismail and sent a male sheep instead. And that marks the tradition of animal sacrifice around Eid-ul-Adha. –Sacrificing an animal was and is just physical symbolism. It’s important to ask ourselves if we are giving up something of intense value as Ibrahim did. Ibrahim’s act of submission was only a symbolism for genuine surrender to the will of God, which is clearly revealed in the Quran : ‘It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah; it is your piety that reaches Him (22:37). The essence of qurbani is of sacrificing something we really love, of letting go of what we think is the most important thing to us. It could be anything that stops us from remaining God-conscious, anything we are attached to or entangled with, like our family, job, power, position, ego, anger and arrogance, greed or jealousy or obsession. This Eid, let us identify and sacrifice something with which we have the same type of emotional and mental attachment that Ibrahim had with his son.’"
