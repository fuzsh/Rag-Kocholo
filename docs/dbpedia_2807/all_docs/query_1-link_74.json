        "text": "â€” Benazir Bhutto's 19-year-old son was named symbolic leader of her party Sunday, while her husband took effective control, extending Pakistan's most enduring political dynasty.\n\nThe major parties appeared to agree that the elections should take place as scheduled on Jan. 8 despite street violence and political turmoil triggered by the assassination of Bhutto. The Election Commission is to discuss the timing of the polls today.\n\nA successful vote would bolster U.S.-backed plans to restore democracy to the nucleararmed country as it battles rising Islamic extremism.\n\nRioting subsided Sunday after violence that left at least 44 dead and caused tens of millions of dollars in damage, but bitterness remained over the government's response to the gun and suicide attack that killed Bhutto.\n\nThe appointment of Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, was not without its own complications. The former Cabinet minister spent eight years in prison on corruption accusations and is viewed with suspicion by many Pakistanis.\n\nAt a news conference Sunday, Zardari said the opposition party - Pakistan's largest - had no confidence in the government's ability to bring the killers to justice and urged the United Nations to establish a committee like the one investigating the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.\n\nThe decisions on the future of Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party were made at a closed meeting in the sprawling family estate in the south of the country where the two-time former prime minister grew up.\n\nThe eldest of Bhutto's three children, Bilawal Zardari, accepted the party's leadership, but said he would remain at Oxford University.\n\nHe said his father, who was officially designated co-chairman, would be the effective party leader.\n\n\"The party's long struggle for democracy will continue with renewed vigor,\" Bilawal Zardari told a news conference that was repeatedly interrupted by emotional chants from Bhutto's supporters. \"My mother always said democracy is the best revenge.\"\n\nBhutto's grandfather was a senior figure in the movement that helped Pakistan split from India and lead it to independence in 1947. Her father - Pakistan's first elected prime minister - founded the Pakistan People's Party in 1967, and its electoral success since then has largely depended on the Bhutto name.\n\nBilawal Zardari said his father would \"take care\" of the party while he continued his studies. Asif Ali Zardari then told reporters to direct questions at him, saying his son was at a \"tender age.\"\n\nVOTE IS ON\n\nAsif Ali Zardari immediately announced the party's participation in the elections, perhaps sensing sympathy for Bhutto and her family could translate into a strong performance in the polls, but said another party leader, Makhdoom Amin Fahim, would likely be the party's candidate for prime minister if it won.\n\nHe also appealed to the party of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to reverse an earlier decision to boycott the polls. Sharif's party later agreed.\n\n\"It is up to the political parties in Pakistan to choose their leaders,\" White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said from Crawford, Texas, where President Bush is vacationing.\n\n\"We believe it is important for Pakistan to confront extremists and continue on the path to democracy by holding free and fair elections,\" he said. \"The timing of those elections will be up to the Pakistanis.\"\n\nTariq Azim, a spokesman for the pro-government Pakistan Muslim League-Q party, congratulated the decision against seeking a delay in the vote.\n\n\"We welcome it, and we are also ready for the contest on Jan. 8,\" he said after earlier predicting the election may be delayed up to four months.\n\nThe British and U.S. governments had been pushing Bhutto, a moderate Muslim seen as friendly to the West, to form a power-sharing agreement with President Pervez Musharraf after the election - a combination seen as the most effective in the fight against al-Qaida, which is believed to be regrouping in the country's lawless tribal areas.\n\nBut many of her supporters have alleged that political allies of Musharraf were behind her killing, which the governmenthas blamed on Islamic militants with links to al-Qaida.\n\nA statement from the British government said Musharraf had agreed to consider \"potential international support\" to the Pakistani investigation into the assassination, but gave no more details. It also urged Pakistan to go ahead with elections without any \"significant delay.\"\n\nAsif Ali Zardari rejected as \"lies\" the government's account of how his wife died, amid a dispute over whether she suffered fatal gunshot wounds or was killed by the force of the suicide blast that struck her vehicle as she left a campaign rally Thursday.\n\nAt Zardari's insistence, Bhutto was buried without an autopsy. The debate over her cause of death has undermined confidence in the government and further angered her followers.\n\nKARACHI QUIETER\n\nIn Karachi, residents cautiously emerged from their homes Sunday and struggled to find food and fuel amid the blackened buildings, shattered glass and burnt-out vehicles littering the streets.\n\nWith police and troops patrolling, Pakistan's largest city appeared quiet for the first time since Bhutto's assassinationsparked a wave of angry rioting.\n\nThe previous three days of clashes and looting left at least 40 people dead across Sindh Province, where Karachi is located, provincial Home Minister Akhtar Zemin said. Hundreds of bank branches were destroyed and 950 vehicles burned.\n\nThe normally bustling port city remained a virtual ghost town, shocked by Bhutto's death. Nearly all shops were closed, and streets normally packed with traffic were empty, save for boys playing cricket.\n\nMussarad Nasim Albert bought laundry detergent from a supermarket where the shopkeeper peddled goods from beneath a metal door and through bars usually open during business hours. The 49-year-old nurse said she had been unable to get to work for the past few days.\n\nShe lamented that goods were now being sold at nearly double normal prices and bought just a few necessities like potatoes and onions because of the crisisspawned inflation.\n\n\"There is nothing in the house. I am searching for things,\" she said.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed from Karachi by Burt Herman of The Associated Press."
