        "text": "Salaam,\n\nBut how can a hadith exist about visiting a shrine since the definition of a shrine is the grave of a holy person?\n\nand yes there are hadith about visiting graveyards to remember death and this is recommended, however, we are not allowed to pray in a graveyard (then why would we be allowed to pray in a shrine since shrine = grave)…\n\nin islam, we worship Allah alone and that involves directing all of our dua to Him as well and not to a grave as this goes against the fitrah and tawheed itself…\n\nit is better to visit the graveyard to remember death and that is it, any dua to the dead is strictly prohibited…\n\nyou may say we go to Allah thru these pious ppl, but how is that different than the mushrikeen arabs who used to go to Allah thru their idols…the pagan arabs also believed in one ultimate God but they wanted to make dua to others….\n\nmay Allah swt guide us all…Ameen\n\nWaslam Bro,\n\nI didnt said, praying at shrines (durgah’s) or in graveyard is not prohibited. It is. But ALLAH swt says they are not dead they are alive in their places. They get to know that you visit them; as you seen from many ayats in which prophet Muhammad PBUH says when you visit the graveyard they come to know about you, they can hear your sound of your footsteps, they hear whatever you say.\n\nIt’s good for Muslims to visit those ALLAH’s pious friends, but it’s not like you just start asking them your needs. Yes you can ask them as wasila, and trust me ALLAH always made wasila for everything in our real life. Look around and you will find many stories, when someone is in need of food and didn’t found at home then ALALH made wasila to someone and bring food at their home. So wasila is their, you can ask ALLAH’s friend to pray to ALLAH and make a dua for your (needs) to be fulfilled. And it’s not haram, don’t we ask our friends, our family members to pray to ALLAH that your xyz need fulfilled?\n\nYes I know many peoples going those places and doing a shirk by actually asking them while forgetting the fact that ALLAH is the one who can give. One you can ask them to pray for you and make a dua for you, it’s as simple as we ask our mother, father, brothers n sisters, our well wishers etc.\n\nI have given you the references links if you read them you will get the more clear concept as they have Ayats and stories related to Wasilas. Speically read visit of prophet Mossa’s to Hazarat Khuzar alhey salam, although Moosa is the prohet while Khazar alhey salam is pious friend of ALLAH. Why a prophet has to visit him why not he? There is another story in which a women asked prophet mooosa to ask ALLAH to give me a baby, and ALLAH rejects then with pioes friend of ALLAH’s dua she got the baby? Bibi Maryum was not a prophet, she was again the pious friend of ALLAH why a prophet has asked her to make dua to ALLAH to give him baby too? So read all those you will find in those books, it will clear your concepts.\n\nI am not saying I am a very good muslim but I am sharing whatever my knowledge is and books can give you more clear ideas.\n\nAOA Brothers!\n\nWell my opinion is that We Shall not debate and fight on things which are not pretty much clear to us. If any one use “Dogmetic” approach (means stick to one thing and believe he is right & others are wrong), then this approch will cause a “Firqa”, and i believe FIRQA BANDI is not good for muslims. We shall all united as one Ummat and say we are only Muslims, not belong to any specific sect.\n\nSo if we are not clear to any thing then leave it to ALLAH. Just think that many peoples dont fulfills all the necessary things for muslims mention in QURAN. So if we read Quran, act upon which ALLAH say to us and act upon Sahee Hadees, then we will see that it will be more than enough for us to spend a good life as per Shariayat.\n\nWe regarding the above debate, my heart says to me;\n\n*if u visit them then only recite Fateha\n\n*Ask any big and small things directly from ALLAH as when we call ALLAH, ALLAH replies to u.\n\n*Better to act upon their teachings (obviously were that is in Quran, Hadees & Shariyat).\n\n*Strengthen ur believe in ALLAH and try to be like those pious ppl or even better then them.\n\n*Love those ppl who love ALLAH.\n\nMay ALLAH give us better understanding of Islam and help us to implement islamic shariyat in our life, Ameen, sum Ameen."
