A heavy explosion at a weapons depot at the Shurab military base took place on Wednesday last week, a source close to the Taliban said the blast was not caused by fire; relatively, it was an airstrike that targeted the depot, followed by an airstrike that destroyed the depot. The Taliban did not release any details of the attack and kept it to be a top-secret. Because the Taliban leaders are in a precarious position now, their armed forces are still breaking ranks and starting private businesses. On the other hand, the resistance front against the Taliban in the north of Afghanistan has become much stronger. In addition, there are reports that combatants and activists of the previous republican government, who fled to Iran after August 15, have joined the resistance and battle has intensified in some districts and areas of Panjshir province.\n\nMoreover, the series continues, according to our intelligence, a group of fighters is still preparing for war in Tajikistan, and wants to start fighting after the upcoming Eid.\n\nFor the past days, Taliban military leaders and officials have been trying to complete the militant formation for Panjshir province, although none of the fighters is willing to go to Panjshir to fight. Since, those areas are all valleys and the resistance front armed services are familiar with those areas, but the Taliban are unacquainted to carry out their war tactics.\n\nOn the other hand, hardline Taliban leaders and fighters have been in a state of panic by the announcement of former US President Donald Trump’s remarks. In a statement, in which he said the US troops would once again go to Afghanistan to collect their remaining weapons, Weapons left behind after August 15 at Afghan corps, US military bases and other military bases.\n\nSubsequently, a military meeting was held in Kabul shortly after Trump’s announcement, Thereafter, Mohammad Yousuf Wafa, Governor of Kandahar and Director General of the Military Commission of 16 Provinces. He was appointed to record the weapons of the Taliban’s military bases and corps in 34 provinces of Afghanistan, as well as the weapons of the special centres, which were under the control of American and British troops before August 15. For instance Helmand province’s Shurab and Boston Billion Pound Camp, Dover Camp and Kabul Bagram Air Base, Kabul Special Intelligence Center or Tenth Department, The US Special Forces base in Kabul, now known as Blackwater, centres of the Kabul National Security Special Zero Units 01, 02.\n\nThe house of Mullah Mohammad Omar of Kandahar province, which was under the control of 03 unit for last 20 years and according to the information this place was under the control of Blackwater. In addition, weapons records of all Afghan corps. On a daily basis after the weapons registration process, large quantities of weapons and military equipment are transported to the southwestern zone districts.\n\nBesides weapons, according to Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar’s advice, Taliban’s cash-money must be protected. This means that the process of transferring cash and weapons to the southwestern districts of Afghanistan are continued, to the extent that the US and Afghan forces have not been able to enter for the past 20 years. Moreover, all the cash and weapons will be transferred to the outskirts of cities and only the required amount of money and weapons will be located in the cities and military bases.\n\nAccording to our sources, security meetings were held in all major military bases of Afghanistan from the beginning of last week to Monday or April 4 of this week, and the high-ranking Taliban are under some kind of pressure. Because, they fear that if the United States were to invade Afghanistan again to retrieve weapons, this time Pakistan would not host Afghan Taliban leaders either. Since the current security and political turmoil in Pakistan has put Pakistan on a two-way street, with the United States on one side, On the other hand, China and Russia want to expand their trade with the world through Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nChina and Russia do not want Pakistan to become a center of international terrorism this time around and once again pose a major threat to its neighbors, therefore they seek to co-operate with the Pakistani government in defeating terrorists and then expanding its trade with Europe and Africa, taking advantage of the country’s open water and geographical location.\n\nSo if the Taliban in Afghanistan witnessed an attack by US troops this time, China would not allow Pakistan to host the Taliban, and Afghanistan would once again witness a protracted civil war, because this time the Taliban have become much stronger than expected, while Taliban have more advanced weapons, and special military units.\n\nMentioned are the reasons that have frightened the Taliban leaders and politicians, On the other hand, the internal differences and strife between them are not only resolved, but also broadened.\n\nSource: Modern Diplomacy\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the text of the original story:\n\nhttps://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/04/07/talibans-islamic-emirate-came-under-the-us-airstrike-oer/\n\n--------\n\nHindu Religious Cleric Threatens Muslim Women With Rape As Crowd Cheers, Probe Ordered After The Video Went Viral On Social Media\n\nA video in which a religious leader can be heard issuing a rape threat women of a particular community has emerged on social media. (Photo: Screengrab)\n\n------\n\nApril 8, 2022\n\nIn a video that has emerged on social media, a religious leader can purportedly be heard threatening to kidnap and rape women of a particular community. He was addressing a gathering in Sitapur district in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe video was shot on April 2.

While the event was organised on March 27, videos of the same have gone viral on social media in the first week of April.\n\nOrganised by Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad (AHP), communally provocative speeches and derogatory remarks were hurled at the Muslim community. The event also saw the distribution of Trishuls as a symbolic gesture of Hindus coming together.\n\nIn a video, Manoj Kumar, AHP president Praveen Togadiya’s aide, is heard inciting the audience and provoking them to impregnate Muslim women.\n\nHe went on to recollect the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and glorified it. He then encouraged the audience to take up arms such as a Trishul and not back off when the time comes.\n\n5,000 Trishuls were distributed among the audience as part of the event. The Trishul Diksha (ceremonial distribution of Trishuls) had been banned by the Congress government. However, the BJP government overturned the ban.\n\nHe then praised Vivek Agnihotri on behalf of AHP for making Kashmir Files and requested him to make another movie on Gujarat, referring to the Gujarat riots of 2002.\n\nHe said, “What a wonderful sight it was to see ‘Bajrangbali’(Hindus) sitting on their (Muslims) chest with Trishuls.”\n\nSource: Siasat Daily\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.siasat.com/will-fight-muslims-with-trishuls-the-war-cry-at-gujarats-hate-conclave-2304341/\n\n--------\n\nAl Qaeda Chief Zawahiri Asks Muslims In The Subcontinent To Unite Over Hijab Controversy In India\n\nal Qaeda chief Ayman Al Zawahiri\n\n-----\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\nAl Qaeda chief Ayman Al Zawahiri, in a video released on Tuesday, spoke on the hijab controversy in India and asked Muslims in the subcontinent to fight the perceived assault on Islam “intellectually, using the media and with weapons on the battlefield”.\n\nZawahiri’s reference to a contemporary issue has also confirmed that he is alive, contrary to suggestions that he had died of natural causes in 2020. Although, even after the unconfirmed reports of his death, Al Qaeda had issued many videos of Zawahiri, in all of them he only spoke about historical conflicts and ideological issues casting a doubt on whether the videos were shot in the present time.\n\nIn an almost nine-minute video released by Al Qaeda mouthpiece As-Sahab media on Tuesday, Zawahiri showered praise on Muskan Khan, the Karnataka student who raised slogans of Allah-hu-Akbar after being heckled by a right-wing Hindu mob shouting slogans of “Jai Shri Ram” this February. Zawahiri said that her “defiant slogan of Takbeer” as she challenged “a mob of Hindu polytheists” had “emboldened the spirit of Jihad” and had reawakened the Muslim community.\n\nA hijab-wearing student at PES College in Mandya, after being heckled with ‘Jai Sri Ram’ slogans, retorted by saying Allah u Akbar or Allah is great.\n\nMeanwhile, the college management tried to resolve the matter.#Karnataka #hijabhttps://t.co/4eqkTBa6ko pic.twitter.com/KHO9sv7Civ\n\n— Express Bengaluru (@IEBengaluru) February 8, 2022\n\nThe video, in fact, starts with a clip of Khan taking on the mob, followed by Zawahiri’s address which for the entire duration of the video talks about just this issue. “She has unveiled the reality and unmasked the nature of the conflict between the chaste and pure Muslim Ummah and the degenerate and depraved polytheist and atheist enemies it confronts… May Allah reward her greatly for imparting a practical lesson to Muslim sisters plagued by an inferiority complex vis a vis the decadent Western World. May Allah reward her for exposing the reality of Hindu India and the deception of its pagan democracy,” Zawahiri said.\n\nHe said Khan’s video had inspired him to write a poem that he recited at the end of the video. “Her Takbeer inspired me to write a few lines of poetry, in spite of the fact that I am not a poet. I hope that our honourable sister accepts this gift of words from me,” Zawahiri said.\n\nThe Indian security establishment has taken the development with a measure of concern. “While media outlets affiliated with these groups keep talking about Indian issues, Zawahiri devoting so much time on a single issue is a development that cannot be ignored. It shows Al Qaeda views India as a serious ground for recruitment and may channelize its resources with greater vigour for the same. A message of this kind from Zawahiri is likely to energise cadres and inspire those harbouring perception of persecution,” a senior security establishment officer said.\n\nIn a message to the Muslims in the subcontinent, Zawahiri said, “We must stop being deceived by the mirage of Hindu democracy of India, which to begin with, was never more than a tool to oppress Islam. We must realise that in this real world there is no such thing as ‘human rights’ or ‘respect for the constitution’ or law or other such nonsensical conjectural ideas.”\n\nAccording to Zawahiri, it was exactly the same scheme of deception that the West had employed against Muslims, “the true nature of which was exposed by France, Holland, and Switzerland when they banned the Hijab while allowing public nudity”. “The enemies of Islam are one and the same, those fighting the hijab of Muslims in Egypt and Maghreb are the same opportunist thugs… writers, journalists, even hired turbans who vilify the hijab and the Islamic Shariah. It’s a war on Islam, its core doctrines, its laws, ethics and etiquettes,” he said.\n\n“Our Muslim Ummah in the Indian subcontinent, our battle today is a battle of awareness, a battle of discerning illusion from reality. We must understand that the way out is by holding on to our Shariah, uniting as a single Ummah, from China to Islamic Maghreb, and from the Caucasus to Somalia, a united Ummah waging a concerted war across several fronts. We must gather around sincere scholars and fight our war ideologically. Intellectually… using the media… and with weapons on the battlefield against the enemies of Islam,” he added.\n\nHe said the first step in this direction was raising awareness and revealing the facts. “We must realise that the governments imposed on us, specifically in Pakistan and Bangladesh, do not defend us, rather they defend the very enemies they have empowered them to fight against us,” he said.\n\nZawahiri also praised the “free media” for circulating the video of Muskan. “I call upon them to lay bare the injustice that is taking place, confront this oppression and spread the facts concerning the situation on the ground,” he said.\n\nThe hijab row has prominently figured in propaganda literature of some global terror groups. Last month, the propaganda outlets of both the Islamic State and Al Qaeda had the issue on their covers. IS-associated magazine Voice of Hind had carried a cover titled “The Daughters of the Companions” on the issue. Previously, AQIS had already talked about it in its latest issue of Nawa-e-Ghazwa-e-Hind, an Urdu magazine brought out by it.\n\nIn his earlier videos, Zawahiri has largely focused on Islam’s war against western powers and India has found only passing mentions. He has off and on spoken about Kashmir but never in detail or broached any particular issue referenced any incident.\n\nZawahiri’s last India-centric video was released in 2014 when he announced the formation of “Base of Jihad in the Indian Subcontinent” and said that it was a message that Al Qaeda had not forgotten its Muslim brothers in India. He said jihadists would break the borders of British India and asked for Muslims in the subcontinent to unite.\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks too Zawahiri had made mentions of Kashmir, asking Muslims to fight and once warned Muslims in Pakistan that then president Pervez Musharraf was going to hand them over to Hindus and flee the country.\n\nSource: Indian Express\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the text of the original story:\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/india/al-qaeda-chief-zawahiri-asks-muslims-to-unite-over-hijab-controversy-in-india-7856096/\n\n--------\n\nUS Congresswoman, Ilhan Omar Urges Biden To Act On India’s Anti-Muslim Prejudice\n\nU.S. congresswoman-elect Ilhan Omar of Minnesota ( FILE PHOTO - Anadolu Agency )\n\n------\n\nMichael Hernandez\n\n06.04.2022\n\nWASHINGTON: US congresswoman Ilhan Omar pressed one of President Joe Biden's most senior diplomats on Wednesday on US support for India given what she said is a long-standing campaign against the country's Muslim minority.\n\nOmar, who is Muslim, directly asked Wendy Sherman, Biden's deputy secretary of state, how US support for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is \"promoting a free and open region,\" and lambasted what she characterized as a reluctance to openly criticize his government.\n\n\"How much does the Modi administration have to criminalize the act of being Muslim in India for us to say something? What will it take for us to outwardly criticize the action that the Modi administration is taking against its Muslim minorities?\" she asked.\n\nSherman said she agrees that the administration must stand up \"for every religion, every ethnicity, every race, every quality of diversity in this world.\"\n\nOmar quickly retorted: \"I do hope we make a practice of standing up not just to our adversaries, but to our allies as well.\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" said Sherman, who also noted the US has raised concerns about India's human rights record directly with New Delhi officials.\n\nIndian Muslims have witnessed a deterioration of the right to practice their faith under the rule of Modi and his right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), according to multiple international rights groups.\n\nHuman Rights Watch reported in 2021 that the BJP’s prejudices have “infiltrated independent institutions, such as the police and the courts, empowering nationalist groups to threaten, harass, and attack religious minorities with impunity.”\n\nIt noted that Modi and the BJP have adopted laws and policies that “systematically discriminate” against Muslims.\n\nSource: Anadolu Agency\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/us-lawmaker-urges-biden-to-act-on-anti-muslim-discrimination-in-india/2557129\n\n--------\n\nSouth Asia\n\nReopening of schools for girls in Afghanistan might lead to discord within Taliban: US envoy\n\n7 April, 2022\n\nKabul [Afghanistan], April 7 (ANI): US special envoy for human rights and Afghan women and girls Rina Amiri has said that the reopening of schools for girls above the sixth grade in Afghanistan might lead to discord within the Taliban leadership, reported local media.\n\nIn an interview with Turkish TRT, Amiri claimed that within the Taliban, there is a group that is pro-freedom for people in particular the freedom of work and education for women and the reopening of schools for girls, reported The Khaama Press.\n\n“While there is another group of the Taliban that sees Afghanistan as it is in their mind not as it really is.

Supporting the government's hijab ban which was upheld by the Karnataka high court, the Assam CM said if religious clothes are not barred, then educational institutions will become a platform for the display of religious behaviour.\n\n\"If you wear hijab, I will wear something else (it will become an ideology), then school and college will become a platform for the display of religious clothes and religious behaviour. So, how can then school and college continue (with permitting hijab)? That is why the term uniform came so that there's no difference between Hindus and Muslims. There is no difference between poor and rich,\" Sarma said, as reported by ANI.\n\n\"Al Qaeda will never understand but I am sure that Indian Muslims will understand that we have to wear uniforms.

Since 2017, its term has been extended 12 times.\n\nIt was in 1980, soon after the second Backward Classes Commission — popularly known as Mandal Commission — submitted its report recommending 27 per cent reservation to OBCs in central government jobs and educational institutions, that the federal government came out with the first central list of OBCs. The list has been amended many times since then.\n\nThe Rohini Commission was originally mandated to look at the distribution of reservation benefits at the central level. Sub-categorisation of OBCs, which comprise thousands of communities, castes etc, has been a long-standing demand among some sections to ensure better distribution of reservation benefits.\n\nThe commission’s term of reference was later expanded to include examining of and recommending correction of any repetition, ambiguities, inconsistencies and spelling errors in the central list.\n\nThe four-member commission is headed by former Delhi High Court judge, Justice G. Rohini (Retd), while the other members are Dr J.K. Bajaj, Director, Centre for Policy Studies, Gauri Basu, Director, Anthropological Survey of India, Kolkata (ex-officio member), and Vivek Joshi, Registrar General and Census Commissioner (ex-officio member).\n\nPitch for OBC status to be ‘religion-neutral’\n\nAccording to highly placed sources in the government, the Justice Rohini Commission has come across around 200 religiously restricted entries in the central list of OBCs, where Hindus belonging to specific occupational communities have not been given OBC status like their Muslim counterparts.\n\nAs a result, socially and economically backward Hindus from these particular occupational classes are not able to avail of the 27 per cent reservation in central government jobs and educational institutions, they added.\n\nThe sources further said that the commission is addressing the issue to ensure that in any OBC entry in the central list, all members of the community, irrespective of religion, will be entitled to reservation benefits.\n\n“Where this type of religion-specific restriction is there, the commission has tried to make it more equitable for all religious communities, so that people from all religions are included,” a source told ThePrint.\n\nThe commission, another source said, wants to ensure that OBC status is independent of religion in general. In other words, it should remain a religion-neutral category.\n\nWhat the commission found\n\nOne of the sources quoted above said that in Bihar, for instance, the Justice Rohini Commission has come across 23 entries where Muslims from vocational communities like Dhunia (cotton carder), Darzi (tailor), Dafali (drumbeater), Sikligar (one who sharpens knives), Nalband (one who fixes horseshoes) and Mirshikar (hunter) have been included in the central OBC list, but their Hindu counterparts have not.\n\nOut of the 23 entries, the commission has come across just 2-3 entries where Hindus from a particular occupational class have been treated as Scheduled Castes (SC), instead of finding a place in the central OBC list.\n\n“For instance, while a Dhobi (washerman) who is a Muslim is included in the OBC list, a Hindu Dhobi has been included in the SC list. But such cases are few and far between,” the source said.\n\nSimilarly, in UP, while Muslim weavers (Julahas) and masons (Raj Mistry) have been included in the central list of OBCs, Hindus from the same occupational communities have been left out.\n\nIn UP, the commission has come across four entries in the central list that are restricted to a particular religion.\n\n“Non-Muslim weavers in UP have been trying to get into either the OBC or SC list, which has become a political issue in the state,” the source said.\n\n“In the case of masons, for instance, the state backward classes commission had recommended to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) to consider including both Muslims and non-Muslims in the central list,” the source added.\n\nWhile masons from the Muslim community were included in the central list in 1999 on the advice of the NCBC, no decision was taken to include Hindu masons after the NCBC said they have also applied to get SC status.\n\nThe commission has found that discrepancies in the central list on religious lines vary from state to state.\n\nIn Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, for instance, the central list has a separate category for Muslims whose occupational class qualifies them as OBCs, but their Hindu counterparts are not included as OBC.\n\n“In MP, some of the backward class Hindus have been separately added to the OBC list under the subhead ‘Hindu’. This kind of thing is not there in other states like Bihar,” the source said.\n\nHowever, it is West Bengal where the commission came across the maximum number of such anomalies. “The central OBC list of West Bengal has 39 entries that are restricted to Muslims alone,” the source further said, adding: “The commission has looked into all such entries which are restricted to a particular religion, and tried to ensure that OBCs from all religions get an equitable place.”\n\nSource: The Print\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://theprint.in/india/governance/no-more-hindu-muslim-anomaly-rohini-panel-seeks-parity-for-all-religions-obcs-in-central-list/905015/\n\n--------\n\nRecovery of IED case: NIA files supplementary chargesheet against two Kashmir residents\n\nApr 8, 2022\n\nSRINAGAR: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday filed a supplementary chargesheet against two accused in a case pertaining to interception of one Nadeem-ul-Haq with an IED in Jammu & Kashmir.\n\nA spokesman of the NIA said that the agency filed a supplementary chargesheet against the two accused in the case, Fayaz Ahmed Khan, son of Mohammad Afzal Khan of Panzat, and Tawseef Ahmed Wani, son of late Muhammad Maqbool Wani of Bangdara, in Baramulla, under Section 120B of the IPC and Sections 13, 18, 38, 39 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, in the NIA Special Court of Jammu.\n\nThe case was initially registered as FIR No. 234/ 2021 at PS Bahu Fort, Jammu, and taken over by NIA on July 19, 2021, the statement said.\n\nIt added that the case pertains to the recovery of an IED from the accused, Nadeem-ul-Haq from Bhatindi, Jammu, who on behest of his Pakistan-based handlers of TRF, a frontal organization of the LeT, had attempted to explode an IED in a public place in Jammu area.\n\nSource: Times Of India\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/recovery-of-ied-case-nia-files-supplementary-chargesheet-against-two-kashmir-residents/articleshow/90714736.cms\n\n--------\n\nBengaluru: Amid unrest, Karaga festival to be celebrated by Muslims, Hindus\n\n7th April 2022\n\nBengaluru: Amid social unrest and boycott calls of Muslim traders and sculptors, Bengaluru — the Silicon Valley of India — is all set to celebrate annual Karaga festival, known as a symbol of harmony and integrity between Hindus and Muslims since over 200 years.\n\nPreparations are on for the full-scale celebration on April 16, despite the pressure from Hindu organisations to drop rituals involving Muslim community members and dargah from the festivities. The Karaga Utsava Samithi (Karaga Festival Committee) has stated that no matter what, all the traditions would be continued during Karaga festival.\n\nAs part of the festivities, as per the traditions, a group of Muslim religious leaders and moulvis have arrived into the Sri Dharmaraya Swamy temple on Thursday and blessed Karaga Utsava Samithi members. They gave an invitation to the committee to take the procession to Mastaan Saab Dargah located in Balepet of Bengaluru.\n\nKaraga Utsava Samithi President Satish stated that the festival would be carried out in the same way as earlier and there would be no change. The procession would go to the Mastaan Saab Dargah in Balepet – as per the tradition of hundreds of years. “The moulvi of Mastaan Saab Dargah had come to the temple and spoken about it,” he stated.\n\nBJP MLA Uday Garudachar has also pledged his support for keeping the traditions which are symbolic of Hindu-Muslim integration intact. “The question has surfaced regarding whether the Karaga procession should go to Mastaan Saab dargah or not. This tradition has been followed for hundreds of years and it should be maintained in the same way,” he said.\n\nMLA Garudachar has further stated that as a Hindu he would the Karaga procession to go to Mastaan Saab dargah. The management of dargah is also ready for the worship of Karaga deity. India is a secular country and no attempt should be made to spoil the peace and harmony, he added.\n\nHindu activists have maintained that the ritual of Karaga procession visiting dargah was imposed forcefully on Hindu community and it should be stopped.\n\nKaraga festival is held at Shri Dharmarayaswamy temple in Bengaluru for nine days. Just after dusk on Karaga day, a priest dressed in female attire leads a colourful procession. Hundreds of community members of thigalars, a warrior community, including children, will take part in the procession flashing swords. Women and devotees carry earthen pots on their heads.\n\nThe priest carries a flower-bedecked pyramid and leads the procession. The procession visits the tomb of an 18th century Muslim saint at the Mastaan Saab dargah. Karaga festival is celebrated each year to mark the return of Draupadi in the form of Adishakthi.\n\nThe priest carrying Karaga, symobol of Adishakthi, will take three rounds of pradakshina (the rite of circumambulating in a clockwise direction) inside the dragah. The Muslim community members will worship the Karaga deity. People of all castes take part in the Karaga festivities.\n\nSource: Siasat Daily\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.siasat.com/bengaluru-amid-unrest-karaga-festival-to-be-celebrated-by-muslims-hindus-2304275/\n\n--------\n\nAakar Patel thanked Ilhan Omar after she repeated her Muslim Human rights narrative against India\n\n7 April, 2022\n\nOpIndia Staff\n\nOn Wednesday, the US representative for the state of Minnesota, Ilhan Omar delivered yet another propaganda speech targeted at India and PM Narendra Modi in the House of Representatives. In her typical Islamist rhetoric, Omar claimed that the human rights of people, especially those of Muslims have been trampled upon in India when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister.\n\n“How are we promoting a free and open (Indo-Pacific) region by supporting Modi? Why has the Biden administration been so reluctant to criticise Modi’s government on Human rights?” Omar asked in the House. She was seen suggesting that the US’ Cold War foreign policy of supporting dictators in the name of having a common enemy was indirectly equivalent to US’ support for India with Modi at the helm today.\n\nOmar then went on to ask, “How much does the Modi government have to criminalise the act of being Muslim in India for us to say something? What would it take for us to outwardly criticise the actions that the Modi administration is taking against its Muslim minorities in India? Because if we remain silent and the situation gets out of control – in the way that it did with the Rohingyas, we all of a sudden show our interest in the genocide that’s taking place.” Omar suggested that America now has an opportunity to lead and make sure that there is “action” against the Modi Government’s policy concerning Muslims.\n\nTo Omar’s accusations, US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman stated that it is important for America to talk to countries with which it has multiple interests. “(We do so) by meeting with the civil society that supports our human riots concerns, that we support NGOs and the freedom of journalists. When I visited India last time, I met with the LGBTQIA+ community, and I have to tell you, five years ago, no such thing would exist and it is partly because of the advocacy of NGOs and civil society and our affirmation of them that people have more freedom than they once had,” Sherman stated.\n\nAs soon as the ex-Amnesty India head Aakar Patel heard about NGOs being discussed in the US House, he grabbed an opportunity to thank Ilhan Omar for her calls for intervention in the internal matters of India.\n\nOmar who is known for peddling the Islamist narratives often directed against the Narendra Modi dispensation was seeking Biden Administration’s official help in her propaganda war. Aakar Patel replied to her in a tweet, “Thank you, Rep. Omar. Please continue to raise issues relating to human rights and civil liberties in India.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Patel was stopped by Immigration officers at Bengaluru Airport after CBI officers launched a Look Out Notice against him. Patel was supposedly travelling to the US to deliver lectures on American University campuses. The notice against Patel was concerned with a CBI case against Amnesty International India Foundation Trust (AIIFT) and Amnesty International South Asia Foundation for violating FCRA (Foreign Currency Regulation Act) provisions in the name of running a ‘non-profit’ organisation in India. However, a Delhi court today ordered CBI to withdraw the Look Out Notice against Patel, and allowed him to travel abroad.\n\nSource: Opindia\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2022/04/aakar-patel-roots-for-usa-interference-after-ilhan-omars-anti-modi-rhetoric/\n\n--------\n\nNorth America\n\nBin Laden’s niece praises Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz for backing Capitol rioters\n\nBy Emily Crane\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\nOsama bin Laden’s niece, Noor bin Ladin, has praised Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) as well as Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) for publicly defending the US Capitol rioters.\n\nIn an interview with former President Donald Trump strategist Steve Bannon on Real America’s Voice on Wednesday, bin Ladin described those accused of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as “patriots” who are being “smeared and crushed” by the media and Department of Justice.\n\nThe 35-year-old accused the US government and lawmakers of not doing more to defend those charged in the wake of the attacks.\n\n“This is traitor-level, in my opinion, that those who are supposed to represent the citizens are failing,” bin Ladin said.\n\n“We can be really grateful for representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene, [Matt] Gaetz, Sen. Ron Johnson … [they are] among the handful defending and standing up and speaking about these political prisoners,” she added.\n\nGreene and Gaetz have previously said they are unashamed of the violent insurrection and have repeatedly demanded to know how those in custody over the riots are being treated amid allegations of abuse.\n\nBin Ladin, who told The Post in her first-ever interview in 2020 that another 9/11 attack would happen if Trump wasn’t re-elected, echoed those claims of abuse — specifically arguing that the accused will not be given fair trials.\n\n“It’s so shocking to see they are being presumed guilty and have to be proven innocent,” she said of the rioters.\n\nBin Ladin, who lives in Geneva, Switzerland, went on to claim that the Jan. 6 attack didn’t amount to an attempt to overthrow the federal government.\n\n“This entire insurrection narrative is a hoax … I’ll keep saying it, this wasn’t an insurrection, it was an entrapment operation,” she said.\n\nHer comments came after she published a 1,500-word statement on her website, which she subsequently sent to the United Nations, that decried the treatment of the Capitol rioters.\n\n“The subsequent crackdown on the Jan. 6 protesters by U.S. security services, the physical abuse of arrested protesters, and the surveillance and intimidation of their political supporters throughout the United States, all constitute a massive violation of UN human rights norms,” she wrote.\n\nSource: New York Post\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2022/04/07/bin-ladens-niece-praises-marjorie-taylor-greene-matt-gaetz/\n\n--------\n\nTop US military general: Quds Force is terror group and shouldn’t be removed from FTO\n\n07 April ,2022\n\nThe top US military general said Thursday that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) is a terrorist organization and that he does not support removing them from Washington’s terror blacklist.\n\n“In my personal opinion, I believe the IRGC-Quds Force to be a terrorist organization, and I do not support them being de-listed from the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list,” Gen.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in late March that negotiations with the US were progressing positively.\n\nThe US under former President Donald Trump sanctioned Turkiye in 2020 after Ankara purchased the advanced Russian S-400 air defense system and removed Turkiye the prior year from the F-35 joint strike fighter program.\n\nThe US maintains the S-400 could be used by Russia to covertly obtain data on the F-35 and is inoperable with NATO systems. Ankara has maintained, however, that the S-400 would not be integrated into NATO systems and said it poses no risks to the F-35.\n\nNaz Durakoglu, the State Department's top official for legislative affairs, acknowledged in a letter to congressman Frank Pallone the ongoing tensions over additional arms sales to Turkiye but maintained the sanctions and F-35 removal represent \"a significant price paid\" for the S-400 acquisition.\n\n\"The Administration believes that there are nonetheless compelling long-term NATO alliance unity and capability interests, as well as U.S. national security, economic and commercial interests that are supported by appropriate U.S. defense trade ties with Turkey,\" Durakoglu wrote to Pallone, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\n\"The proposed sale will require a Congressional notification if the Department of State were to approve it. We affirm our commitment to established defense trade authorization procedures, including Congressional oversight,\" she added, according to a copy of the letter circulated on social media.\n\nDurakoglu further pointed to Turkiye's active contributions to NATO, as well as its support for \"Ukraine's territorial integrity and cooperative defense relations,\" calling them \"an important deterrent to malign influence in the region.\"\n\nThe State Department did not confirm the letter's authenticity when asked by Anadolu Agency, but a senior State Department official said the US \"strongly values its partnership with its NATO Ally Turkey.\"\n\nSource: Anadolu Agency\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/us-says-f-16-sale-to-turkiye-to-bolster-nato-boost-national-interests/2557234\n\n--------\n\nPakistan\n\nIn A Jolt To Imran Khan Supreme Court Restores National Assembly, Orders No-Confidence Vote To Be Held On Saturday\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday set aside deputy speaker's ruling to dismiss the no-trust resolution against Prime Minister Imran and the subsequent dissolution of the NA by the president on the PM's advice, with all five judges unanimously voting 5-0 against it.\n\nThe court, in its short order, ruled that the deputy speaker's ruling was \"contrary to the Constitution and the law and of no legal effect, and the same are hereby set aside\".\n\nThe apex court ruled that President Dr Arif Alvi's decision to dissolve the National Assembly was also \"contrary to the Constitution and the law and of no legal effect\", noting that the prime minister could not have advised the president to dissolve the assembly as he continues to remain under the bar imposed under clause (1) of Article 58 of the Constitution.\n\n\"It is further declared that the [National] Assembly was in existence at all times, and continues to remain and be so,\" the short order reads.\n\nThe court's verdict restored the prime minister and his cabinet in their position. \"In consequence of the foregoing, it is declared that the prime minister and federal ministers, ministers of state, advisers, etc stand restored to their respective offices.\"\n\nCourt orders NA session to be held on Saturday\n\nThe Supreme Court ordered for the session of the National Assembly to reconvene on Saturday no later than 10:30am. saying that the session cannot be prorogued without the conclusion of the no-trust motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan.\n\n\"The deputy speaker gave a ruling on April 3.

God willing, the process of no confidence will now be completed and we will conduct electoral reforms and head towards clean and transparent elections,\" he said.\n\nBilawal said where Pakistan's history was replete with \"controversial decisions\", the verdict given by the Supreme Court today would be written in \"golden words\".\n\nSecurity beefed up at SC ahead of verdict\n\nThe verdict was to be announced at 7:30pm but it was subject to an hour's delay.

We need a strong government. This will be a very difficult task for the opposition leader,\" Justice Bandial said.\n\nShehbaz said he hoped that when the deputy speaker's ruling was suspended, the no-confidence motion would be revived, adding that if the speaker's ruling is declared nullified, the dissolution of assembly ends automatically.\n\n\"I have one request ... Restore the NA,\" Shehbaz said.\n\n\"In our history, the law has been broken several times. This situation was created because blunders [of the past] weren't identified and rectified. For the sake of God and Pakistan, the court should restore the parliament,\" he requested. \"Let us vote for the no-confidence motion.\"\n\nShehbaz also presented the \"Charter of Economics\" in court. He said that in 2018, dollar was valued at Rs125. \"Today, it has reached Rs190.\"\n\nHe added that the parliament should be allowed to do its work and the members be permitted to take their decisions.\n\nJustice Mandokhail observed that the opposition wanted to conduct elections from day one, inquiring what the issue was now.\n\n\"The problem concerns breaking of the Constitution,\" Shehbaz pointed out. To this, Justice Mandokhail replied: \"We will repair the Constitution.\"\n\nHere, PML-N lawyer Makhdoom Ali Khan said that the PM had announced he would give a surprise. \"Such things shouldn't be said.\"\n\nTo this, the CJP replied: \"We have clarified our decision on surprise.\"\n\nThe chief justice also said noted that the opposition had always demanded new elections. \"Why aren't you agreeing today?\"\n\nAt this, Shehbaz said that the joint opposition would, together, make electoral amendments to ensure transparent elections. \"The common man is miserable. We want to work for them and provide them relief.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the AGP said that everyone wanted a premier elected by the people, not the assembly. \"Would those who overthrew Imran Khan spare Shehbaz Sharif?\" he asked.\n\nAGP Khan went on to say that if the opposition's election demand was being fulfilled, they should let that happen.\n\n\"We know,\" CJP Bandial said to this.\n\nThe PML-N lawyer, however, alleged that the AGP's concluding remarks sounded like a threat.\n\n\"The stock market has crashed, dollar is expensive and rupee's value has fallen,\" Makhdoom Khan pointed out.\n\nThe court observed that these were all economic problems. \"But who created them?\" Makhdoom asked.\n\nTo this, the CJP said: \"I don't think we are sitting here to give answers to questions.\"\n\nThe PML-N lawyer contended that politics was changing every day. \"Apart from dissident MNAs, the opposition has 177 members.\"\n\nUpon order of the CJP, the PML-N lawyer gave details of opposition members in the NA party-wise.\n\nMakhdoom remarked that he had an idea the court would debate the issue of elections in the end. \"I knew that it was not possible to defend the ruling of the speaker.\"\n\nHe added that the Haji Saifullah case was an example. \"It is not possible that the speaker's ruling is suspended and the assembly's dissolution not retracted.\"\n\n\"It looks like you have come prepared on this point,\" the CJP remarked.\n\nNot defending speaker's ruling: AGP\n\nThe AGP, while giving arguments, claimed that the no-confidence motion against Imran Khan was \"dismissed\" on March 28, when leave was granted to table the resolution. According to him, it was important to show the support of majority at the time of tabling the resolution.\n\nSince the opposition had 161 members in favour of tabling the motion on March 28, the AGP said the move had failed then and there.\n\nJustice Akhtar replied that according to this line of argument, if 172 members (majority) had approved the motion, the prime minister would have been ousted. To this, the AGP said the three to seven days mandated by the Constitution before a final vote on the resolution was to give the prime minister a chance to win back angry lawmakers.\n\nHowever, the CJP, at this point, said that at the leave grant stage 172 members were not required. \"They are required at the time of the voting.\"\n\nHe then added that if the speaker approved the resolution on March 28, then \"it's the end of the topic,\" noting that the speaker's counsel said his ruling can't be reviewed.\n\nIf that's the case, the AGP said, then the case is over since on April 3, the same speaker passed the ruling to dismiss the motion.\n\nBut Justice Bandial said that he wanted to hear from the AGP on the main issue which was dissolution of the National Assembly.\n\n\"The assembly was dissolved only after the no-confidence motion was dealt with,\" Khan said.\n\nWe have to see, the CJP said, the time difference between dissolving the assembly and the ruling of the speaker. Here, Justice Mandokhail said that the court could not decide on the basis of circumstances and results.\n\n\"Court has to pass a verdict keeping the Constitution in view,\" the judge said. \"This way ... any speaker who comes tomorrow will do as he pleases.\"\n\nThe AGP, at this point, said that he wasn't defending the speaker's ruling. \"My concern for now are the new elections.\"\n\nEarlier, AGP Khan — who was the last to give his arguments — began by informing the court that he would not be able to give details of the recent meeting of the National Security Committee in an open courtroom. He asserted that the court could issue an order without questioning anyone's loyalty.\n\nHe argued that prime minister was the \"biggest stakeholder\" and, therefore, had the power to dissolve the NA. \"The prime minister does not need to give reasons for dissolving the assembly,\" the AGP contended.\n\nHe also pointed out that the assembly would stand dissolved if the president did not make a decision on the prime minister's advice within 48 hours.\n\nHe argued that voting on the no-confidence motion was not the fundamental right of a lawmaker.\n\n\"The right to vote is subject to the Constitution and assembly rules,\" Khan said. He also pointed out that if the NA speaker suspends a member, they cannot approach a court against it.\n\n\"Are you trying to say that voting on the no confidence motion is subject to the rules,\" the CJP asked, to which the AGP replied that all proceedings, including the no-confidence motion, were carried out in accordance with the rules.\n\nThe AGP said that there was no \"firewall\" that gave complete immunity to parliamentary proceedings. \"The court will decide the extent to which parliamentary proceedings can be reviewed,\" he said. The AGP pointed out that the court could intervene if the speaker declared a person with the minority number of votes to be the prime minister.\n\nAt this, Justice Akhtar remarked that the speaker was the caretaker of the house. \"The speaker is not there for his personal satisfaction. The speaker can't just give his opinion and ignore the members,\" he observed.\n\nThe AGP replied by saying that political parties play an important role in a parliamentary system of government. However, he pointed out that it was the assembly that had a term limit, not its members. \"One individual has the power to dissolve the assembly.\"\n\n'Ruling did not have deputy speaker's signature'\n\nDuring the hearing, Justice Mandokhail said that even though Suri announced the April 3 ruling which dismissed the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, it was signed by Speaker Asad Qaiser.\n\nHe made the observation as Suri and Qaiser's lawyer, Naeem Bukhari, presented his arguments.\n\nResponding to the judge's statement, Bukhari replied that perhaps the documents given to him might not be \"original\".\n\nJustice Mandokhail also pointed out that the minutes of the parliamentary committee meeting, which were submitted to court by Bukhari, didn't prove if the deputy speaker was present.\n\nContinuing, Justice Mandokhail asked whether the foreign minister was present during the parliamentary committee meeting, noting that his signature was not included in the record.\n\n\"Shouldn't the foreign minister have been present?\" the judge asked, which prompted the lawyer to admit the minister should have been present.\n\nAt this, CJP Bandial pointed out that the name of the national security adviser at the time, Moeed Yusuf, was also not included in the record.\n\nBukhari began his arguments by stating that he would focus on whether a point of order could be discussed at any time. He argued that the apex court had refrained from interfering in parliamentary proceedings in the past and asked whether the court would have taken notice if the speaker had dismissed Fawad Chaudhry's point of order.\n\n\"When assemblies were dissolved in the past, the election process was not stopped even though it was declared unconstitutional,\" he said, asserting that the speaker could reject the no-trust move on a point of order. \"This has never happened before but the speaker has the power [to do so].\"\n\nHe said that the former minister had requested a point of order as soon as the session had began. \"The point of order couldn't have been taken up had voting on the no-confidence motion started,\" he said.\n\nJustice Mandokhail asked which law stated that the speaker had the power to dismiss the no-confidence motion. \"We want to understand the definition of a point of order,\" he said.\n\n\"The question is whether a new point of order can be taken up once the no-confidence motion is introduced,\" the CJP said. Justice Akhtar also asked if the point of order was included in the day's agenda.\n\nHowever, Bukhari replied that a point of order could be raised at any time.\n\n\"Voting on the no-confidence motion is a constitutional requirement,\" Justice Mandokhail pointed out. Can the rules be used to invalidate the constitutional right to vote, he wondered.\n\n\"Shouldn't the opposition have been given a chance to [respond] to the point of order?\" the CJP further asked, to which the lawyer replied that it could not be debated.\n\nBukhari also presented the minutes of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security, during which contents of the ‘threat letter’ were shared with parliamentarians.\n\nTalking about the briefing given to the committee, Bukhari said that the NA body was told that there would be consequences if the no-trust motion failed.\n\n'Where is constitutional crisis?'\n\nDuring today's hearing, Senator Ali Zafar, the president's counsel, was asked by Justice Miankhel if the prime minister was the people's representative. The lawyer replied in the affirmative.\n\nJustice Miankhel then inquired if the premier would be protected if the Constitution was violated in parliament. \"Is Parliament not the guardian of the Constitution?\" he asked. He also questioned how justice would be awarded in case someone is affected due to parliamentary proceedings.\n\nSource: Dawn\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1683857/supreme-court-restores-national-assembly-orders-no-confidence-vote-to-be-held-on-saturday\n\n--------\n\nPakistan PM Imran Khan says he will continue to fight as he faces ouster vote\n\nApr 8, 2022\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Thursday he will continue to fight as he faces a vote to oust him, and will address the nation on Friday.\n\nThe court earlier on Thursday overturned a move by Khan to block a parliamentary vote seeking to oust him.

If Imran Khan and the Pakistan government want to be a true leader of the Islamic world, the right way is supporting and helping the Uyghur Muslim brothers and sisters, who are facing genocide by China right now!” the letter added.\n\nSlamming Pakistan, the President of Japan Uyghur Union said, “As an Islamic country, it would be unconscionable and in clear disregard of your own moral values and principles to close your eyes to the terrible fate of millions of your Muslim brothers and sisters.”\n\n“If Pakistan Government continues the silence on China’s egregious crimes against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslims in East Turkistan (so-called Xinjiang), it would be not only shameful things to your country, but also it would be a terrible crime in front of Allah Suhanallah!” it noted.\n\nMoreover, it stated that the presence of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi as ‘special guest’ in the 48th Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Pakistan on 22 and 23 March comes at the time when more than three million Uyghur Muslims are in concentration camps in China.\n\nWhile condemning Pakistan for its support to China, the Japan Uyghur Union added, “Because the Pakistan government used its special title to invite Wang Yi as “special guest”, it gave him the chance to pull the wool over eyes of whole Islamic world!\n\nAll the world knows that the Uyghur Muslims of East Turkistan (Xinjiang) are facing “genocide” and cultural aggression from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), said the letter.\n\nIt expressed its condemnation towards the Chinese FM Wang and said that he not only used this occasion to push CCP’s narrative of how well Muslim minorities in China are treated, but also said, “China and the Islamic world both enjoy a profound history, seek similar values, and share historic missions”.\n\nSource: The Print\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://theprint.in/world/uyghurs-in-japan-lambast-pakistan-for-supporting-chinas-genocide-of-uyghur-muslims-hold-demonstrations/907270/\n\n--------\n\nOpposition asks nation to observe thanksgiving day\n\nAmir Wasim\n\nApril 8, 2022\n\nISLAMABAD: Applauding the Supreme Court’s verdict, the opposition parties on Thursday gave a call to the nation and their workers to observe thanksgiving day on Friday (today) and hold celebrations throughout the country over the ‘victory of democracy and the Constitution’ of the country.\n\nDozens of workers and lawyers belonging to opposition parties, who had gathered outside the Supreme Court (SC) building on the Constitution Avenue were seen celebrating and felicitating each other after the announcement of the short verdict by the five-member SC bench, headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial.\n\nA group of jubilant workers of opposition lit fireworks and raised slogans like “Wazir-i-Azam Shehbaz Sharif” and “Go Niazi Go” as the opposition leaders were seen coming out of the SC building one after the other with smiling faces and some of them making victory signs.\n\nThere was jubilation also in the Sharif camp in London as PML-N’s supreme leader Nawaz Sharif watched the news at his son’s office in Stanhope House, flanked by former finance minister Ishaq Dar, his son Hussain Nawaz as well as other PML-N workers and supporters.\n\nA number of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leaders and members of the Sindh cabinet, along with dissidents of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), also celebrated the SC verdict at the Sindh House where they watched the daylong events live on television.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the official residence of Shehbaz Sharif at the Ministers Enclave, the opposition leaders praised the Supreme Court judgment, stating that “the verdict will be written with golden words in the history”.\n\n“This (SC) verdict has buried all the past judgments given on the basis of doctrine of necessity. Now no one will be able to use the doctrine of necessity till the dooms day,” said Mr Sharif.\n\nHe termed the verdict a victory for the 220 million people of the country, democracy, parliament and the Constitution.\n\nMr Sharif expressed the hope that the joint opposition would complete the next phases smoothly in line with the SC verdict.\n\nMr Sharif, who has been nominated as the candidate for the prime minister’s office by the joint opposition, said that the word “victimisation” did not exist in his dictionary. He said the opposition would break the NAB-Niazi nexus.\n\nIn reply to a question, Mr Sharif said if the PTI members decided to resign from the assembly, then it would be their choice but it would have no effect on the outcome of the no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan.\n\nIn reply to another question, he said that they would consult and invite each and every party in the parliament for developing a consensus on electoral reforms.\n\nKhalid Maqbool Siddiqui of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) said that they were happy because they were standing at the right side on this important day of the history.\n\n“Democracy is the best revenge,” said PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari while commenting on the SC verdict during a brief media chat at the Zardari House before leaving for Mr Sharif’s residence for a meeting of the joint opposition.\n\nThe PPP chairman said that through this verdict, the stains left by the 2018 elections had been washed to some extent.\n\nHe said now they would fulfil the promise of conducting free, fair and transparent elections in the country.\n\nHe asked the party workers to hold celebrations in every nook and corner of the country.\n\nPakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) president Maulana Fazlur Rehman said the SC had given a satisfactory verdict as per expectations of the people of the country.\n\nMaulana Fazl said that earlier he had given a call to the nation to observe a protest day on Friday (today), but now they would observe a thanksgiving day.\n\nHe asked the people to offer Nawafil on the day over the SC’s historic decision which, he said, had saved the country.\n\nMeanwhile, talking to Dawn in London, PML-N leader and former finance minister Ishaq Dar praised the SC for upholding the Constitution.\n\n“We were all together when we heard the judgement and then were flooded with telephone calls. We are happy the Constitution has been upheld and the right thing has been done by the court. He (Nawaz) appreciates this and so do I,” said Mr Dar.\n\n“But while it is indeed something to celebrate, there is also a serious crisis in the country and a bigger challenge lies ahead,” the PML-N leader said.\n\nSource: Dawn\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1683985/opposition-asks-nation-to-observe-thanksgiving-day\n\n--------\n\nBloc politics may hinder steadiness of Pak-China relations, official says\n\nApril 8, 2022\n\nISLAMABAD: Though relations between the two countries had gone through a historic change since the inception of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), bloc politics may impact steadiness in the flow of relations between Pakistan and China.\n\nCPEC which is the flagship project of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims to alleviate the socio-economic woes of Pakistan.\n\nThis was highlighted by Dr Fu Xiaoqiang, vice chancellor of China Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) during a virtual conference. It was jointly organised by CICIR in collaboration with Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI).\n\nISSI Director General Aizaz Chaudhry was on the same page regarding the dangers of bloc-politics. Touching upon the recent war in Ukraine, he was of the view that the military escalation should be put to an end.\n\nIn the first session titled ‘Global and Regional Impacts of Ukraine Crisis’ Dr Shang Yue deputy director (Institute of Eurasian Studies, CICIR) maintained that the crisis marked the end of Russia’s quest of its rightful place in Europe and, with its bold move, Moscow had challenged the global supremacy of United States.\n\nDr Sameera Imran who is an assistant professor at National Defence University (NDU) argued that the Ukrainian invasion had worsened the condition of food security in post-pandemic South Asia.\n\nDr Hu Shisheng said that the global financial situation was worse due to severe imbalance in payments and disruption in the supply chain. Countries that had cordial relations with Russia were in a tight spot, the speaker said, adding, “For instance, India is heavily dependent on Moscow for its arms supply and not following the US lead, would get New Delhi in trouble. The developing countries will bear the brunt of Russo-Ukrainian military escalation.”\n\nIn the second session titled ‘Review and Prospect over the Situation in Afghanistan’, Dr Yan Shuai said after the Taliban took over Kabul, the security environment improved overall.\n\nHowever, it was still a fertile ground for terrorist organisations and in order to remain credible, the Taliban would have to comply with international norms and present a moderate face, he added.\n\nISSI Amina Khan opined that the Taliban government was confronted with a myriad of challenges right now and the biggest ones were the non-existent economy of the country and weak institutions.\n\nUnless the financial situation in the country improved, Afghanistan would remain a breeding ground for terrorist organisations.\n\nSource: Dawn\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1683989/bloc-politics-may-hinder-steadiness-of-pak-china-relations-official-says\n\n--------\n\nHawkish anti-US sentiments among workers trouble PTI\n\nImran Ayub\n\nApril 8, 2022\n\nKARACHI: It appears to have dawned upon the senior Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leadership in Sindh that the strong anti-US sentiments rapidly growing in the party rank and files over the alleged interference in internal political affairs of the country and the alleged “conspiracy hatched to oust Imran Khan government” is not going to be very helpful for the political future of the party.\n\nThe party seems to have realised that now there is a need to tone down this zealotry and rhetoric to show that the PTI is not against any foreign country and wants cordial relations with the United States as well.\n\nThe senior leaders on Thursday clearly expressed concern over the aggressive tone and asked the leaders and PTI workers to avoid any such sentiments that could affect Pakistan’s relations with the world superpower.\n\nSindh Governor Imran Ismail speaking to media at Governor House stated that the recent actions of the party lawmakers and workers that included raising anti-US slogans in the Sindh Assembly and burning of symbolic effigy of the world superpower in streets in different parts of Karachi “were not in good taste”.\n\nHe made it clear that the PTI government wanted cordial relations with all countries across the world.\n\n“We have conveyed to our workers and friends that this is not good [anti-US sloganeering]”, he said when asked about the PTI leadership reaction to recent party protests in Karachi and Sindh Assembly where the anti-US slogans were raised.\n\n“We should not go against any country. We should not burn flags of any country. It could damage our relations with any country and we don’t want to damage our relationship with the US. This is not good.”\n\nEarlier, hundreds of PTI workers led by legislators and areas leaders, gathered in Lyari on Thursday morning and staged a protest against ‘traitors of the country’ who, according to them, were trying to oust the Imran Khan government on a foreign agenda.\n\nChanting slogans “down with the US”, they also burnt effigies of those political leaders of Pakistan who had allegedly “sold out” their conscience for “the lust of power”.\n\nAlthough the Sindh governor kept himself at distance from such forceful protests of the PTI, he appeared confident and convinced that the government was facing a ‘foreign intervention’ and the information was also seconded by the National Security Council that included the military leadership.\n\nSupreme Court judgement\n\nDespite all reservations and a firm stand of the government on the alleged foreign intervention, the Sindh governor made it clear that the government would accept the Supreme Court decision, while also adding that it was the people of Pakistan who would actually decide about right and wrong in the next general elections.\n\nSource: Dawn\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1683903/hawkish-anti-us-sentiments-among-workers-trouble-pti\n\n--------\n\nAfrica\n\nPresident of Anwar-ul Islam Urges Unity Among Muslims\n\nApr 8, 2022\n\nPresident of Anwar-ul Islam Movement of Nigeria, Alhaji Mubashir Ojelade, has stressed the need to bridge the gap of disunity among Muslims.\n\nThis, Alhaji Ojelade said, will put an end to doctrinal disagreements and brings unity to the Muslim community.\n\nHe made this known during the Ramadan lecture and Prayer for the Nation at at Anwar-ul Islam Model College, Agege, Lagos.\n\nAccording to him, the prayer for the nation was meant to seek Allah’s assistance over the insecurity challenges in the country.\n\nAlhaji Ojelade described the attack on Kaduna-bound train from Abuja as callous, saying that he could have been one of the victims.\n\n“I have travelled through train along that route on a number of occasions recently.

The DUP also held a conference in the Egyptian capital seeking to unify its disparate factions.\n\nBurhan recently said the military would hand over power only after elections, and threatened to expel a United Nations envoy trying to facilitate a political agreement alongside the African Union. Ambassadors from the United States, Britain, and Norway said on Tuesday they had held a “frank and constructive conversation” with Burhan, expressing support for dialogue leading to a “credible civilian transitional government.”\n\nWestern powers have said that such a government is a key condition for any restoration of billions of dollars in international economic support for Sudan suspended after the coup.\n\nThe draft deal says political prisoners would be released as a confidence-building measure, a pledge that had also been made in a short-lived deal struck one month after the coup to bring back Abdalla Hamdok as prime minister.\n\nAmong those currently held are leaders of the Forces of Freedom and Change Coalition (FFC), which shared power with the military before the coup. They were members of a task force that worked to dismantle the political, bureaucratic and financial apparatus that ran Sudan under Bashir’s iron rule.\n\nThe agreement orders the review of the task force’s work, a process that Burhan has already launched. Many people fired by the task force have recently been reinstated by court order to posts in state media, the foreign ministry, justice department and other institutions.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Sudanese Professionals Association, which led anti-Bashir protests, warned that his dissolved National Congress Party (NCP) was beginning to hold meetings again and reorganize.\n\nSource: Al Arabiya\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2022/04/06/Draft-Sudan-deal-seeks-to-cement-military-s-grip\n\n--------\n\nTunisian president says voting in elections will be for individuals not for lists\n\n06 April ,2022\n\nVoting in Tunisian parliamentary elections that are expected to be held in December will take place in two rounds, and people will vote for individuals rather than lists as in previous elections, President Kais Saied said on Wednesday.\n\nSaied’s comments confirm that he is moving forward with political changes, although they have not been agreed upon yet with other key players.\n\nThe president also said that the Independent Electoral Commission (ISIE) would supervise the elections, although not in its current composition, referring to his intention to change some of its members.\n\nSaied, who dissolved parliament last week after taking control of executive power last summer and ruling by decree in a move his opponents called a coup, is under strong internal and external pressure to restore the country onto a democratic path.\n\nThe political crisis intensified last week when more than half the members of parliament held an online session to revoke Saied’s decrees. Saied responded by dissolving parliament, imposing one-man rule.\n\nSaied, who rejected accusations that he was perpetuating individual rule, said he would have dialogue on political reforms, but added that “traitors and thieves” would not participate in the talks.\n\nHe has previously said he would form a committee to rewrite the constitution, put it to a referendum in July and then hold parliamentary elections in December.\n\nRached Ghannouchi, the leader of the main opposition party - the Islamist Ennahda - told Reuters last week that his party would boycott any elections and referendum Saied calls to restructure the political system unilaterally.\n\nThe Free Constitutional Party, whose leader Abir Moussi is a supporter of the late autocratic president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, and a bitter foe of Ennahda, echoed Ennahda’s intention to boycott any planned elections which Mousssi said would be a “theatre piece”.\n\nSource: Al Arabiya\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://english.alarabiya.net/News/north-africa/2022/04/06/Tunisian-president-says-voting-in-elections-will-be-for-individuals-not-for-lists\n\n--------\n\nTunisian delegation will travel to Washington on April 18 for talks with IMF\n\n06 April ,2022\n\nA Tunisian delegation will travel to Washington on April 18 for a week of talks with the International Monetary Fund, the economy minister Samid Saied said on Wednesday adding that Tunisia’s reform plan was ready.\n\nThe north African country, which is going through its deepest financial crisis yet, hopes to reach a deal with the IMF in exchange for implementing unpopular reforms including reducing subsidies and freezing wages, to avoid the collapse of its public finances.\n\nSource: Al Arabiya\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://english.alarabiya.net/business/economy/2022/04/06/Tunisian-delegation-will-travel-to-Washington-on-April-18-for-talks-with-IMF-\n\n--------\n\nArab World\n\nAlleged Bucha, Ukraine massacre ‘shocking:’ UAE mission to UN\n\n07 April ,2022\n\nThe United Arab Emirates has called the alleged massacre of civilians in Bucha, Ukraine “shocking,” and an “alleged crime of utmost gravity” at a UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine on April 5.\n\nThe comments were made by the UAE Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations Lana Nusseibeh.\n\nThe ambassador called on a cooperative investigation and urged people to “not get caught up in a war of narratives.”\n\nShe added that the UAE “acknowledges” the Secretary-General’s call for that independent investigation and the appointment of the Human Rights Council’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine in the council address.\n\nNusseibeh reiterated the need to “move towards a peaceful solution to the war in Ukraine.”\n\nBucha, 37 kilometers (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv, was occupied by Russian troops for more than a month following the February 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhen the Russian forces pulled back last week, they reportedly left behind civilian dead on Bucha’s streets, inside buildings and buried in shallow graves.\n\nLocal officials say more than 300 people were killed by Russian forces in Bucha alone, and around 50 of them were executed, according to a Reuters report.\n\nGrowing numbers of Putin’s troops, along with mercenaries, have been reported moving into the Donbas, where Russia-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces for eight years and control two areas, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAhead of its February 24 invasion, Moscow recognized the Luhansk and Donetsk areas as independent states. Military analysts have said Putin also could be seeking to expand into government-controlled parts of the Donbas.\n\nUkrainian authorities are working to identify hundreds of bodies they say were found in Bucha and other towns after Russian troops withdrew and to document what they say were war crimes.\n\nThe ambassador requested that the council address relief and humanitarian needs including either “local or broad-based agreements for security guarantees to allow for the safe provision of humanitarian assistance and for civilians to voluntarily evacuate safely.”\n\nOn March 19, the UAE reiterated its commitment to providing assistance to civilians affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine during a phone call between the foreign ministers of UAE and Ukraine.\n\nThe UAE diplomat also reiterated the country’s “readiness” to support efforts being pursued to find a “peaceful solution to the dispute in Ukraine and to reach a political settlement to the crisis,” according to a WAM report.\n\nLater on March 28, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company said it was pausing investments in Russia, which represent less than one percent of its portfolio, because of the Ukraine crisis.\n\nThat was the first comment by the top executive of Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s second biggest sovereign fund, about its Russian investments after the invasion.\n\nNussebieh also touched upon the importance of preserving cultural heritage and identity, saying: “We know from our experience in the Middle East that protection of cultural sites is critical to rebuilding peace. In moments of violence and turmoil, cultural sites are essential cornerstones for collective memory and a foundation for future reconciliation.”\n\nGlobal food shortages were also pointed out as a growing concern amid the war by the UAE representative, offering “full support” to the problem.\n\n“Food shortages are aggravating situations already on this Council’s agenda, and these shortages are felt in other settings where high prices of basic commodities can lead to further unrest and instability, not just in this part of the world, but around the globe.\n\n“We look forward to seeing the UN Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance address these issues and offer it our full support.”\n\nThe comment was reflected earlier by World Bank Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnerships Mari Pangestu, who said that The Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) is in a “critical” position with food and fuel as the Russia-Ukraine war continues to unfold, in an interview with Al Arabiya.\n\nSource: Al Arabiya\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://english.alarabiya.net/News/gulf/2022/04/07/Alleged-Bucha-Ukraine-massacre-shocking-UAE-mission-to-UN\n\n--------\n\nDubai: Martial arts teacher ends fast daily with non-Muslim assistant, students\n\nBy Nasreen Abdulla\n\n8 Apr 2022\n\nIt’s 6.30pm and there is an Iftar table set up at this martial arts studio in Dubai. Huddled around it, ready to end their fast, are Master Grant Randall, a Muslim convert; his non-Muslim assistant, Master Karel Josh De Vera; instructor Elim Asangaziev and some students enrolled in the advanced athletes class.\n\nThis is the daily evening routine at the dojang (training area) of WTTU MooDuk Taekwondo in DIFC during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nAs the Maghrib Azan is given out, the students and masters share their homemade snacks and dates with each other. There are jokes, laughter, and lots of good memories being made as the little group breaks their fast together, which is seen in the video below:\n\nBritish national Master Grant Randall is the Kwan jang-nim or the master of the dojang. Master Karel Josh De Vera, the SaBumNim or guide/master is from Philippines. The Kyo Sa Nim or instructor is Elim Asangaziev, from Kyrgyzstan. It is his first Ramadan in the UAE.\n\n“I first started fasting as a sign of respect to Master Grant,” said Josh De Vera. “The first day I fasted, it was 16 hours long. I had such a severe headache that I thought I could never do it a second time. But I did it again and I started noticing huge differences to my health. That’s why I started doing it regularly. This is my fourth year fasting for Ramadan and it is a really special time for me.”\n\nAfter breaking their fast, the masters have no time to rest. Two of them rush off to finish their Maghrib prayers before getting back to training.\n\nAs soon as the children finish their training at 7pm, the adults class begins.\n\n“We don’t have time to eat,” said Elim Asangaziev. “If we eat after Iftar, we won’t be able to continue training effectively. We have our dinner later in the evening after we get home.”\n\nAs the others finish their prayers, Master Josh - pictured below - prepares a protein drink with peanut butter, milk and chocolate-flavoured whey protein.\n\n“The drink is usually something that we have after training,” he said. “But during the month of Ramadan, we have it after iftar so that we have "
