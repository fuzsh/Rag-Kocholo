        "text": "Ancient places and towns of Dadu\n\nAziz Kingrani\n\nDadu district of Sindh, a southern province of Pakistan is treasure of historical, archaeological and cultural heritages. Numerous historical and archaeological sites, places, towns and villages are situated in the boundaries of present Dadu District. Such historical richness of Dadu District is briefly discussed herein article.\n\nDadu\n\nThe historical antiquity of our district headquarter Dadu is unavailable in the pages of history, except a little town of Dadu near Jaipur city, India. It seems that Dadu itself is not as antique as the other villages and towns of the district. Dadu is not mentioned in history up to the dynasty of Kalhora. The little hamlets, villages and towns in its surroundings are more ancient than Dadu. Such as Marakhpur near Dadu is more ancient than Dadu, but now it is included with Dadu city. According to local legends Dadu was named after Dadan, Dad Muhammed or Dadu Shah. While, there is no any confirmation in this regard that Dadu Shah named person lived and died here. Because of, neither mausoleum Dadu Shah nor his grave is in Dadu. According to legends, Dadu Shah lived at his village Dadu Ja Bhaan near Dadu. Even there is no certain for village Dadu Ja Bhaan. Ustad Bukhari had told me that there is no sure about grave of Dadu Shah in Dadu. Dadu is a word of Sindhi and Hindi, which means brother. Dadu Dayal (1544-1603), a great saint, poet and follower of Guru Gorakhnath is mentioned in history who gave a new Panth of Yogi which became known as Dadu-panth. He belonged to Gujarat. India. later, he moved to Amber (city), near Jaipur Rajasthan, where he had preached his teachings. Dadu alludes to the bliss of Sahaja in his songs. Much of the imagery used in his songs is similar to that used by Bhagat Kabir, and similar also to that used by the earlier Sahajiya Buddhists and Nath yogis. Osho says, “Without Gorakhnath, there could be no Kabir, no Nanak, no Dadu, no Vajid, no Farid, no Meera — without Gorakhnath none of these are possible.”. Dadu ji spent the latter years of his life in Narayana, a small distance away from the town of Dudu, near Jaipur city (Wikipedia: web site). Dr Abdul Jabbar Junejo writes with reference of Dr Nabi Bux Baloch in “Sindhi Adab Ji mukhtasir Tareekh that he (Dadu Dayal) lived in Sindh for long time. He had good knowledge of Sindhi. He did poetry in Rajasthani, Hindi and Sindhi. Qazi Qadan influenced him. His poetry is included in Shah Latif’s Sur Berag (Junejo: 265: 1994). Dhani Bux Magsi has mentioned that two Hindus having title of “Dadunavasi”, Mr Dayo Ram (1836-1906) and Sanat Bhagat Ram. According to him they were Hindu Sanats (Saints) of Dadu. In those days, in the temples of Dadu mostly “Jagatnath” was worshiped by Hindus of Dadu (Magsi:480:2005). Probably it might have been Dadu-Vansi. In Sindhi and Hindi Vans means offspring, descendant. It is confirmed that Dadu Dayal came to Sindh and influenced by Qazi Qadan. Qazi Qadan was of Sehwan. It is suspicion that having gone to Veernath Ashram and Mandir (Temple) near Khairpur Nathan Shah, Dadu Dayal might have come here to preach and halted at Ashram or Mandir located at Dadu with his followers. After his halt, the Ashram or Mandir (Temple) might have been named Dadu by his followers. Later, these two Dadu-Vansi Sanats (Saints) might have continued preaching since ancestors. Because, the worship of Jagatnath in Dadu is clear evidence about Gorakhnath and Dadu Dayal. However, Dadu was lying on the banks of channel of water named Ghaar wah or Ghari wah flowing from Indus River. I think Ghari wah might have been connected with western Nara canal. Dadu was near to the historical way called “Sher Shah Suri route” which used to lead to Do’abo, Talti and Sehwan from Ustad Bukhari Degree College Dadu. Dadu developed quickly in British period. When it became taluka headquarter of Karachi and later Larkana districts. Dadu got position of district head quarter in 1931 but it began to become populated city from 1980s (1980). Recently Dadu district has been divided in to two districts. Dadu, Johi, Khairpur Nathan Shah and Mehar talukas have been included with Dadu district and Sehwan, Kotri and Mahaal Kohistan have been curved from Dadu and included with Jamshoro district.\n\nJohi\n\nJohi word is denoted from “Juhi” or “Joohi”, which means a little clump of trees. It is used in feminine gender. According to local traditions, a little village was on the bank of Nai (Hill torrent) near an ancient trade route. Travelers or trade caravans used to rest for some moments, under that little clump of trees. Later, some people settled near the clump and village was called Juhi. In British government record, it is also mentioned as “Juhi”. The pronunciation of name Juhi began to change in the period of British government. Now it is called Johi. When and by whom Johi was established? It is unanswered question. Because of, there is no certainty in this regard. Some historical remains near Johi can enlighten on antiquity of Johi. The stupas near Johi which is now sitting place of Najif Ali Shah and at its neighboring village Gul Mohammad Gumb indicate the antiquity of Johi that it exists since ancient time. This area was in Buddhya division (Pargano) in Rai dynasty. Buddhya was area of Buddhists. In Brahman’s dynasty Kako son of Kotal Chhana (In Buddhism legend traditions Channa is mentioned as charioteer of Buddha) was ruler of Buddhya and his fort was Sesum. (Qani’a:80:2004) So we can say that Johi existed before the Rai dynasty. In the map of 1877_78, Johi is shown as only Deh of Tapa Phulji. It means that Johi was not developed till 1878. No doubt, Johi began to develop in British government period. First Johi was in Karachi from administrative point of view. Later, it remained in Shikarpur and Larkana districts. When Dadu became district in 1931, Johi was included as Taluka headquarter. As a taluka head quarter, Johi developed. Now it is main town of Dadu district. On other hand Johi is also Zoroastrian community settled in several parts of the world. Some people relate Johi with Indian actress Juhi Chawala that her descendents belonged to Johi and some are of the opinion that Johi is derived from Juhi flower. I am of the opinion that it is only presumption.\n\nMehar\n\nMehar is main taluka head quarter of Dadu district. When it was established and how it had been named as Mehar, there is no any certainty. Local people reveal its name as Menhan-war or Menhan-waro means a herd of buffalo. Probably it was near Sindh Hallo which flowed in ancient times from Kashmore Kandhkot towards Manchhar Lake. How much this imagination is near to reality, nothing would be said. It would be said with certain that Mehar began to develop in British government era, when it has been given a level or dignity of taluka head quarter of Dadu district. Mehar is famous for Maao and Mendi (Lousonia Alba).\n\nKhairpur Nathan Shah\n\nAccording to local traditions, Khairpur is an ancient place of district Dadu. It existed before the settlement of Nathan Shah. When Nathan Shah settled here, the village was called Khairpur Nathan Shah. Here Nathan name resembles with Nath, belonging to Gorakhnath religious legends. A village, Ashram and Mandir of Veernath are also lying at a distance of 5 kilometers from Khairpur Nathan Shah towards south. However, the antiquity of Khairpur Nathan Shah would be claimed about 4 to 5 hundred years old. This village developed in British government. First this town was in taluka Kakar. Afterward, this town has been given level of taluka head quarter of Dadu district.\n\nGraveyard of Mian Naseer Kalhoro\n\nMian Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro was a massive leader of Mianwal Movement. He was a leader of Mianwal movement who had strengthened and organized the movement with high wit. Leading the movement from 1656 AD to 1692 AD, he established an interim government in Kachho that became a base of Kalhora dynasty in Sindh. He died and was buried in 1692 AD in graveyard near village Gaarhi, district Dadu. The different types of constructed toms and graves show the different eras. Probably, this graveyard existed before Mian Naseer Muhammad. After burial of Mian Naseer, the graveyard was called and renowned with his name. Graveyard is spread on round about four square acres. Except Mian Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro and his son Mian Deen Muhammad Kalhoro, the tombs of Tajo lekhi -1, Mir Fateh Khan, Bago Chandio and Rajo lekhi-1 are in this graveyard. The graves of 28 martyrs are in this graveyard, who were sacrificed their lives with Mian Deen Muhammad in Multan jail. They were martyred by prince Moiz-u-ddin, the then governor of Multan. The graveyard is notable historical visiting site in Dadu district. The architecture and fresco paintings on walls of toms are precious heritage of Sindh.\n\nKakar\n\nKakar is oldest place of Dadu district. The actual and old village is on a mound like high land. Dr: Nabi Bux Baloch is of the opinion that it is same as village of “Kaka Raj” of of Budhiya Pargano in Rai dynasty, mentioned in Chach Nama due to resemblance in their names. No doubt Kakar is an ancient place but there is no any legend or historical reference about its name and oldness. Kakar was taluka head quarter of Dadu district, but later its level has been decreased. Now it is in taluka Khairpur Nathan Shah.\n\nRadhan\n\nRadhan is a caste. Here are two villages by this caste. One Radhan village and second is Radhan Station. Radhan village is ancient than Radhan station. When railway lines had been passed near Radhan village, a station had been established here. The people settled at station. This became populated and developed as Radhan station. Radhan is in Mehar taluka of Dadu.\n\nFareedabad\n\nFareedabad is an ancient village of Taluka Mehar. Fareedabad existed before the settlement of Fareed Bhagat, who was great commander and disciple of Mianwal Movement. Mian Naseer had settled him for looking after lands and defense of the area from danger of any invasion from mountains. From settlement of Fareed Bhagat, the village had been named Freedabad.\n\nMaado\n\nMaado is probably denoted from “Maddo” which means a hut or sitting place over water made-up of wooden posts or pillars. According to Johar Brohi, a well-known poet and researcher of this area, the name of village Maado is derived from “Madd” or “Maddo”. This place was on the bank of ancient flow of Indus River flowing from this area of Kachho towards Lake Manchhar. It was also a ferry place or harbor. However, historically it is proved that a big branch of Indus River used to flow through this area. Later, it became the stream of western Nara canal. Lake Manchhar, the biggest lake of Asia, appeared in the result of this big branch of Indus River. In the period of Mian Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro a Chandia clan, belonging to Bagho chandio, a follower of Mianwal Movement settled here.\n\nWahi Pandhi\n\nWahi Pandhi is the most ancient village of taluka Johi, district Dadu. Wahi means a channel of spring, which flows from mountainous area through the stream of Nai Narri or Nalli towards deserted area near the village. So this village was called Wahi. Kotiro daro indicates its prehistoric antiquity where N.G Majumdar explored the remains of Mohan Jo Daro, Mehi, Kulli, Amri and Nal civilizations. When this village existed at present location? History whispers. In ancient time this village was called Wahi (Jiyasi of Solangi clan), here Karez (Persian artificial system for water) flows, four courses of water (Waah) flow, where people cultivate. First this was village of Machhis (Solangis), who were very disputative and refused to pay taxes of Jageers, Bakhtiar Baig Turkman invaded the village and named it Akbarabad (Mogul Emperor) and handed over to Panhwars (Merik: 123:1994). In Mogul period the name of village was “Wahi” (Qani’a:60:2004). In the time of Shamsher Uzbek this village was included with Baghban Pargano (Makhdoom Bilawal) (Qani’a: 123:1994). The name of this village “Akbarabad” was till Shah Jahan’s period (Qani’a: 219, 239:1994). The name of village is mentioned as wahi in the beginning of Kalhora period. Mian Naseer Muhammad had constructed a fort on the bank of spring channel (Wahi) with the consultation of late Wadero Jalal (Mahar: 154:1996). Later, in Kalhora Period Khoso tribe became dominant on this village. However, from ancient time the name of this village was Wahi. According to local legends, Pandhi Khan Leghari defeated Dilo Khoso and occupied the village. After the occupancy and his settlement the village was called Wahi Pandhi. This village is on a way to Gorakh Hill Station.\n\nVillage Gaha\n\nThis ancient village is remembered and mentioned in history as village “Kahan”. In Sama’s dynasty, the village and its surroundings were the Jageer of Darya Khan. When differences rose between Darya Khan and Jam Feroz, he left Thatta and returned to his village (Gaaha) and settled here. The Madarsa of this village was famous in Sindh. In those days Molana Aseeruddin Abahri, Molana Yar Muhammad Abahri And Molana Abdul Aziz Abahri came here from Hirat and taught here in Madarsa (Lakho:77: 1997) and he (Abdul Aziz) settled here (at Gaha) for ever and died here (Qani’a:80:2004) According to Janal-ul-Sindh, Darya Khan remaining some time in government, he resigned from his designation and lived at Gaha (Rahimdad: 308: 2000) In mughal period Gaha was main village and division. Fourth division is of Gaha, village of Gaha is 21 miles away from Sehwan toward north-west (Merik: 123:1994). The influence of Rai Chand Gorya (Ghorya) remained in this division in Mogul era. When the grandson of Roy Chand Ghorya was Gaagirdar of this division, he fought with some people of this area (Merik: 171:1994) Korya (Ghorya) took Sehwan division on contract and gave it in charge of his person named Jaysar (Merik: 195:1994) At the time of Khuwaja Nooruddin, Manik son of Hindu Ghorya was ruler of Gaha division (Merik: 197:19941). In this division two shares had Ghorya and third share had empire. He took third share on contract and gave it under the supervision of his son Manik (Merik: 302:1994) He (Manik) constructed fort at Gaha and lived there. He kept many riders (as Force) from mughal and Afghans, cannon man and expert archers as servant (Merik: 171:1994) Manik’s disputes remained with Panhwars in this division. Manik called sardar (Head) of Panhwars and imprisoned him in fort. He invaded on village Sekarji, after severe fighting Mir son of Essa panhwar was killed. The name of fort constructed by Manik Hindu in Gaha was Kanwar Kot (Merik: 171:1994). Influence of Manik in Gaha was at high level. In the days of Shah Jahan, Gaha was included in the jageer of Mirza Jani Baig. Manik intended to go to court of emperor but later Jani Baig gave him Gaha Pargano on a pay or tax (Merik: 191:1994).With the conspiracy of Khusro Baig and Qasim Khan Arghun’s sons, Manik was killed as pretence of guest by fateh, son of Qasim (Merik: 304,305:1994).\n\nVillage Gaha is also mentioned in Kalhora period. Mian Yar Mohammad returned from Balochistan via Zeedi and reached at Sanwah (Present village of Sawaro Taluka Johi) and Naig on the bank of Manchhar. Snatched Samtani village from Qaiser Panhwar and settled at Gaha. He sent his brother Mir Muhammad to Siraies (members of Mianwal Movement) (Mahar: 190: 1996). For the location of village Gaha the indications are clear in above discussed matter. Concept is clear that the ancient village of Gaha is present village Sayed Bahar Shah, lying in deh Gaha, taluka Johi. It is located at a distance of 7 kilometers from Johi town towards east-south, on left side of Johi-Bhan road at a high mound. Sayed Bahar Shah is famous as Gaahi pir. The local people tell that it was a village of Gahalo king (Rai Ghorya Chand), who was very powerful in his time and ruled over Gaha. Village Sayed Bahar Shah is nearest to village Samtani and it will be at the distance of 21 mile from Sehwan towards west-north. The bridge over Phakka Miner near village Bahar Shah is famous as “Gaha Mori”. Sayed Sharif Shah son of Sayed Bahar Shah also stated a tradition of Gahalo Badshah (King). He has found old currencies from village. Perhaps Gaha tribe lived here and their village was called Gaha. In present time there is no any person or village belonging to Gaha caste. Later, when Khudabad became the capital town of Kalhora dynasty, Gaha village lost its value and in the last of Talpur dynasty, this village lost its original name.\n\nVillage Sawaro\n\nThis village existed from Sama’s dynasty. This village is on the bank of Sawaro wah (a rainy water course) which had been dug by Darya Khan in Sama’s period. History has mentioned it as village “Sanwah”, “Sao” or “Saway”. Jam Nizamuddin had sent a Hindu minister named Chaglo with Darya Khan to Sehwan, who came here and started rainy water course Sawah (Sawaro), whose water was drained out to Manchhar (Merik: 283:1994) Sawah (Sawaro) was dug in Neroon Kot division for diverting the water of mountainous area (, Merik: 34:1994) Sao (Sawaro) is 38 miles (19 Koh) away from Sehwan fort and 32 miles (16 Koh) away from mountains (Merik: 286:1994). In Kalhora period it is mentioned with same name. Mian Yar Mohammad Kalhoro returning from Balochistan reached on bank of Manchhar at Sanwah (Sawaro) and Naig (Mahar: 190: 1996).I think that in those days, actual name of village was also Sawaro but historians did mistake in its pronunciation. Present village Sawaro is located at the same location, stated as in history. It is round about 20 kilometers away from Johi towards west-south. Sawaro is at a distance about 7 to 8 kilometers from the bank of Manchhar and about 5 kilometers away from village Chhini and Nai Naig towards north, on the bank of rainy wah. Sawaro is deh and union council of taluka Johi.\n\nVillage Aararo\n\nThis ancient village remained main village in Mughal period. It existed before the influence of Mughal Empire. First it was village of Solangi tribe. Later, it had been snatched from Solangis and handed over to Panhwar clan by Arghuns. Aararo is also mentioned as Aarari in history. Aararo or Aarari is a Sindhi word which means a little mound or high land. It was one of the villages of potho in Mughal’s period. Potho means high land. A village of Panhwars, Potho was near Akbarabad (Wahi Pandhi) (Merik: 32:1994) in Neroon Kot division. (Merik: 239:1994) The other villages of Penhwars of potho, such as Aarari was not in control (Merik: 285:1994) Further it is mentioned that second village Aarari and third Kharoti (?) both of that villages are related to Gaaha division (Merik: 201:1994). When Mian Naseer Mohammad became powerful here, he fought with Panhwars and snatched this area from Panhwars and gave in the charge of Lund tribes, which is still settled here. A deh and Aararo graveyard is situated in Johi Taluka, District Dadu, in the same area which is mentioned in history as an ancient village Aarari. In deh Aararo, the tombs of a graveyard are also called Butta Quba. Near this graveyard, the remains of old village Aararo can be observed. The graveyard is at some distance from village Patt Suleman direct towards north.\n\nKhanpur\n\nKhanpur is located on the both sides of Indus high way in taluka Khairpur Nathan Shah, district Dadu. This is an old village of district. When and how it was named as Khanpur? The history is silent about its antiquity. According to the legends Khan of Kalat had established a watching place here at the location of present Khanpur. Later, some people began to live and little village was named Khanpur. Why, when and which Khan of Kalat had established a watching place here? Certainty is unavailable. However, in Kalhora dynasty Khanpur got main position.\n\nGraveyrd of Paryani Pir\n\nSo called graveyard of Paryani Pir is situated near Khanpur village towards east-south. It is said that tombs in graveyard belong to Pirs who were offspring of fairy (Paree). Unbelievable traditions have been related to unknown persons who are buried in this graveyard. The fresco paintings on wall of the tombs are valuable heritage of Dadu including Sindh. Who were they? History even traditions are silent. Probably, these unknown tribal people established Khanpur village and were settled at Khanpur from Kalhora to early Talpur period. It seems that they belonged to noted tribe and were disciple of Mianwal Movement. This assumption is based on fresco painting which shows their nobility and 1812 AD year written in painting on wall shows Talpur period. However this graveyard is precious heritage of Sindh.\n\nTharari Mohabat\n\nTharari means a village or hamlet. Tharari Mohabat is located between Mehar and Radhan Station. It is main town of taluka Mehar. Nareja, Solangi, Sameja and other clans live at this town. There is no any local tradition about Mohabat whether he belonged to Narejo or Solangi tribe.\n\nVillage Chhini\n\nFrom Mughal period this village exists with same name. Chhini is a compound word of Sindhi. It is derived from Chha (Six) and Nai (Rainy stream). This means stream of six rainy Nais that drains out at one place. A village where flow of six Nais joins is called Chhanai or Chhani. Later, its pronunciation changed as Chhini. Near Chhini six rainy streams join and then flow in one stream to Lake Manchhar. These are Gaj (Through old flow of Shole), Angai, Kukrani, Naig, Khandhani and Haleli. Village Chhini is more ancient. Yousif Merik writes they (Theba) have four villages; three of them are belonging to upper division (Baghban). These villages are called, Kandhkot (not to be confused as present district Kandhkot that was Kanwarkot at Gaha village), Chhini and Theba village (Merik: 161:1994). Mir Abul Qasim himself went to Kandhkot (Kanwarkot), Chhini and Beto (Now Beto Jatoi) villages of Thebas and halted there (Merik: 201:1994) Here Chhini is mentioned as village of Theba clan. It is possible that at the time of Mir Abul Qasim Chhini might have been under the influence or occupancy of Theba tribe. However, Mian Naseer Muhammad also had occupied Chhini village and raised frown against Mughal Empire (Mahar: 154: 1996). After migration from Lahore and Multan he (Mian Naseer) lived there, where Channa clan was settled (Mahar: 154: 1996). It shows the influence of Channa here at the area of Chhini to Gaarhi village. Chhini is a still little village located on the edge of hill near jointed flow of six Nais, about 17 kilometers from Johi, towards south-west.\n\nTando Rahim Khan\n\nThis village is near Gari or Garo pass including other little passes of Khirther mountainous area. According to opinion of NG Majumdar, archeological remains at Tando Rahim Khan are contemporary to Gazi Shah (Marikhar Daro). He writes,”We examined these two chalcolithic stations, Ghazi Shah and Tando Rahim Khan. Each had its own distinguishing features (Majumdar: 86: 1933). Later Rahim Khan Son of Jangu Jamali settled at this village. Since its settlement the village is called Tango Rahim Khan. Jangu had two sons, Shahdad and Rahim Khan. Shadad lived at Haleli and perhaps in the last of Kalhora period Rahim Khan migrated to Tando Rahim. We would know his offspring from given Shujra of Jnagu Khan (Husain Badshah: 502 :2005).\n\nTharari Jado Shaheed\n\nTharari Jado Shaheed (Martyred) village had been established by Jado Shaheed Babar, who was a brave commander of Mian Naseer Muhammad. In the days of Mian Deen Mohammad and Mian Yar Mohammad Kalhoro, the governor of Multan Prince Muizuddin had attacked village Garhi. Mian Deen Muhammad had been arrested but Mian Yar Mohammad had not surrendered. He faced Mughal army along with Jado and other commanders. He fought with Mughal army at the place of Khore (actual Tore) on the right bank of River Gaj (Mahar: 170: 1996). Jado shed his blood and martyred. He was buried in graveyard near his village Tharari Jado, where a tomb is built over his grave. After, his martyrdom village Tharari Jado became Tharari Jado Shaheed. It is situated towards west of Kakar and at a distance of about 35 kilometers from Johi towards north.\n\nVillage Samtani\n\nThis archaic hamlet of Sindh is still existed with same name and it is located at distance of 15 kilometers from Johi along Johi- Bhan road. Most probably, the name of Samtani village is taken from a Hindu clan of Samtani. The place of birth of a world fame Indian scholar N.H Samtani is mentioned as Johi but I think he was born at village Samtani. Anyway, this village is near village Gaha as well as Khudabad. When Koriya (Ghorya) Hindu took Sehwan division on contract, he tried to encumber the people. Encumbering different villages in Gaha pargana, he burnt village Behan, in this way they reached at Kanhri and Samtani where Bahauddin Panhwar was settled. (Merik: 95:1994) Samtani had remained Panhwar’s village since old time. In Mughal era Samtani remained under agonies. One painful event about insult of Qazi Abdul Wahid of Samtani is stated in Tareekh-e-Mazhar-e-Shah Jahani (Merik: 242:1994). When Ahmad Khan heard about this event, he came to Samtani, which was place of Bahauddin Penhwar (Merik: 245:1994). In the beginning of Kalhora dynasty this village was prosperous. Mian Yar Mohammad snatched Samtani from Qaiser Panhwar (Mahar: 190: 1996). This village had a Madrasa for Islamic teachings.\n\nVillage Kanhri\n\nKahri or Kanhri is historical village. In Mughal and Kalhora dynasties this village was main village of Gaha division. Probably, it was named after Kahir Khan (Qahir), who is mentioned in given Shujra (Showing generation) as ancestor of Mian Chanu in Tareekh Sindh Kalhora period, volume-1, on page 49. Before and later in the days of Mian Chanu, this area had remained under the influence of Channa and Kalhora clans. In the west of village Kanhri, there is an area, which is called Patt Kanhri. Now Kanhri village is in taluka Dadu and Patt Kanhri is in taluka Johi of Dadu district. Kanhri remained a village of Seth Naun Mal. He writes, “My ancestorbelonged to Kahri. Kahri is between Bhan town and Nara canal (western). It is 5 mile away from Bhan and one mile away from Nara Canal. This was very prosperous and developed town. One of my ancestors Sajan Mal had lands here (Naun Mal: 48:1996). Naun Mal further tells that clans belonging to Panhwar and Channa tribe used to rule over this area. Kahri and Samtani were their central villages (Naun Mal: 50:1996). In present time Kanhri is a little village of Dadu district.\n\nVillage Phulji\n\nVillage Phulji is ancient village of Dadu district. Probably before Arghuns, this village was of Machhi (solangi) from Arab period to Sama dynasty. Arghuns snatched from Machhis and gave it in possession of Pahwars. Panhwars settled here and got influence at high level. When Mian Naseer Muhammad established an interim government in this area, he snatched Phulji villagefrom Panhwars and gave it under the supervision of his disciple Mureed Khan-1 Jamali of Mureed Dero. From Kalhora period the descendant of Mureed Khan-1 is settled at Phulji village. When railway lines passed from here, a railway station had been established that was named Phulji Station. Now it is a populated village of Phulji Station. According to revenue map of 1877-78 of Deh Johi, District Karachi and later Larkana, Phulji is mentioned as its Tapa. Phulji village is located towards north-west of Johi, at a distance of about 20 kilometers. The remains of ancient fort of are now vanished.\n\nSita Village\n\nThis is first ancient village in district Dadu, perhaps even in Sindh, which is named and called with the name of a woman. According to local people, sita was non-muslim woman, whose name was Sita. Probably this name belongs to mythology of Hinduism. Sita (Seeta), Sanskrit “Sītā” meaning “furrow”, is the wife of Rama, the seventh Avatar of Vishnu in the Hindu religious traditions. Sita is one of the principal characters in the Ramayana, a Hindu epic named after her husband Rama. Sita was born in Janakpur in Nepal. Her father was King of Janakpur. She is esteemed as the standard setter for wifely and womanly virtues for all Hindu women. Understood theologically in Hinduism, Sita is an Avatar of Lakshmi. The occasion of her marriage to Rama is celebrated as Vivaha Panchami. The legends are that Sita was a founded and discovered in a furrow in a ploughed field, and for that reason is regarded as a daughter of Bhumi Devi, the goddess of the Earth. She was found and adopted by Janaka, king of Mithila and his wife Sunayana. Upon her coming of age, a swayamwara was held to select a suitable husband for her, and she got married to Rama, prince of Ayodhya, an Avatara of Vishnu on Vivaha Panchami (Wikipedia: web site). Probably, here might have temple or worship place related to Sita. Thus the village was named Sita. When railway lines crossed beside this village in British period and a link road had been constructed leading to Sita village, a new village was established as Sita road near railway staion. Sita village is about 6 kilometers away from Sita road towards east near right bank of Indus River. Sita road developed in comparison to Sita village. Later, Sita road was named Rahmani Nangar but still it is called Sita Road by people.\n\nVillage Baghban\n\nThis village does not exist in now days with same name. It was named martyred Makhdom Bilawal, after the burial of the patriotic Sufi saint Makhdom Bilawal. . In past, due to gardens of different type of fruit trees village and Pargano was called Baghban. Baghban is also Deh in Taluka Dadu. Near the mausoleum and mosque of Makhdom Bilawal toward east-north an old village is located on mound like high land. This village had central position of Pargano (division) Baghban during Sama dynasty and Mughal period. This village is situated along Indus high way at a distance of 10 kilometers from Dadu city words north.\n\nVillage Beto\n\nThis historical village exists yet with same name, from Mughal period. In Mughal period it was village of Theba tribe. Tareekh Mazhar Shah Jahani writes, “Mir Abul Qasim, himself went to Kandhkot (Kawarkot was in area of presen Johi taluka), Chhini and Beto, the villages of Theba and halted there (Merik: 201:1994). Probably, this village became Beto Jatoi in Talpur’s dynasty after the dominancy of Jatio tribe.\n\nVillage Garhi and Mosque of Garhi\n\nMian Adam Shah Kalhoro has been considered historically as founder of a religious based organization or movement of Mianwal, which became most famous in Sindh as “Mianwal Movement” during the leadership of Mian Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro. Mian Naseer Mohammad Kalhoro, a legend leader of “Mianwal Tahreek” had succeeded his legacy in 1656 AD. Protesting against Mughal Empire he was imprisoned in Gawalyar prison. After liberty from jail, he settled at village Gaarhi, taluka K.N Shah, District Dadu (Mahar: 154: 1996). Village Garhi became as a central place of Mianwal movement for its strengthening and activeness. Mian Naseer established interim government and governed some area of Sindh for approximately 36 years. Here he founded the mosque in 1658 AD. It is believed that mosque had a status of University at that time. Passing 350 years, the mosque exists with its grand and dignified historical view up till now. The legends tell a myth that Garhi was name of a woman who was related to Mian Naseer Muhammad. So, the village was called after her name of Mai Garhi. When we glance at history, village Garhi existed before the settlement of Mian Naseer Mohammad. Actually red or reddish mounds are near village and red sand of mountains is also spread in the surroundings of village. Tareekh Sindh Kalhora period writes, “After leading 35,36 years Mian Sahab (Naseer) died in 1692 AD and he was buried near Garhi at red mound (Mahar: 159: 1996). Thus, due to red or reddish send the village was called “Garhi” which means a red or reddish. It is located towards west of Khanpur taluka K.N Shah and at a distance of some kilometers from graveyard of Mian Naseer Muhammad towards east near historical mosque of village Garhi.\n\nVillage Rajo Dero\n\nRajo Lekhi-1, a vice and main follower of Mian Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro had established a village Rajo Dero, near Raj wah where lands were allotted to him by Mian Naseer. It is 30 kilometers away from Johi towards north-west. Rajo Lekhi had been given Jageer up to village Rajo Gandho (Band) which is also related to Rajo Lekhi-1. He is buried in graveyard of Mian Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro.\n\nVillage Hairo Khan\n\nThis is very ancient village of Johi, Dadu. The stupa sited near village towards west gives evidence of its antiquity that this village existed from Rai dynasty but ancient name would not be guessed. Laghari tribe had been settled in Kachho by Mian Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro. Probably, after the settlement of Hairo Khan Leghari this village was called village Hairo Khan.\n\nVillage Drigh Bala\n\nHere are two Drigh villages in Johi Taluka. One is Drigh Lower (Hetheen) and second is Drigh upper (Matheen/ Bala). Village Drigh Bala is located at distance of 30 kilometers from Johi towards west-north on bank of Nai Shole or sole but after diversion band (Teer Bhit) the flow of Nai Gaj was diverted to stream of Nai Sole. Now Drigh Bala can be mentioned on bank of Nai Gaj. Here are also two villages of Drigh Bala. One is Drigh an old (Purani) and second is Drigh new (Naeen). The Talpur Amirs had been settled by Mian Naseer Mohammad Kalhoro in this vicinity of Kachho. Talpurs migrated from Dera Ghazi Khan; their first settlement was Drigh (Talpur: 161:1973). In Kalhora dynasty other Mirs had been given Jageers in different areas of Sindh but Manikani Amirs stayed here Mir Allahyar Khan, Mir Tharo Khan, Mir Chhutto Khan and Mir Saindad Khan lived and died here (Talpur: 161:1973). Drigh Bala was famous for different types of species of vegetables. Here Molvi Saalar Dahari was legend religious personality who ran Madarsa of Drigh Bala. Lived and died here. Fort built by Drigh Bala is also a monument of Talpurs.\n\nShah Hassan\n\nShah Hassan is an old village on the bank of Lake Manchhar. History does not speak about its chronological background. Dr Nabi Bux Baloch and other scholars are of the opinion that Shah Hassan might be Sesum fort of Buddhya Pargano in Brahman’s dynasty. Some have related it with Shah Hassan Baig Mirza but there is no historical proof or evidence in this regard. But, no doubt this village is very ancient. It is at a distance of 30 kilometers from Johi town towards west-south.\n\nVillage Sukhia Channa\n\nSukhio Channa was a Sardar (head) of his community. Later, Qadir Bux Channa became famous as main Sardar in this area. Village Sukhia Channa is located towards south of Bahar Shah (Gaha village) at some distance on a high mound in Deh Gaha of taluka Johi. Channa clan ruled over Kachho from Manchhar to Sibi, from Rai dynasty to Samma dynasty. A proverb is famous in Sindhi that “Sindh Samo, Kachhey Channo Bhatti Jesalmir”, which shows the influence of tribes upon areas. This ancient village is located in the boundaries of old Pargana of Gaha in Sama, Mughal and Kalhora period.\n\nVillage Thul\n\nThis village is named due to thul (stupa).Tareekh Mazhar-e- Shah Jahani indicates a geographic position and calls it Othal (not to be confused Othal of Balochistan). Yousif Merik has mentioned incorrect pronunciation “Othal” instead of “Thul”. The villages of Kachho, who are in Gaaha Pargano, those are three. One of them is village of Othal, second Aarari and third is village of Kharoti (?) Othal is at a distance of 16 miles from big mountain (Khirthar), Aarari on 24 miles and Kharoti is 40 mile away from Sehwan and 12 miles away from mountain (Merik: 285:1994). Perhaps Yousif Merik had understood village Thul as Othal or mistakenly it had been written as Othal. Near Thul village there is stupa of Buddhist which reveals its antiquity. Due to stupa it would be believed that this village existed in Rai dynasty. Thul village in taluka Johi is very famous due to distinct construction of Stupa (Thul). It is at a distance of 15 kilometers from Johi towards west-southin vicinity of Kachho region.\n\nVillage Luhri or Lohri\n\nThis most ancient hamlet is situated at a distance of some kilometers from village Chhini towards south-east, on the bank of Lake Manchhar. Here the signs of archeological remains of Amri and Mohan Jo Daro civilizations are found. At this place the symbols of Stone Age also had been explored by Bengali archaeologist Nani Gopal Majumdar (Majumdar: 68: 1933)\n\nPir Lakho (Lakhio)\n\nPir Lakho or Lakhio is approximately at a distance of 18 kilometers from Johi town towards south, on the bank of Lake Manchhar. Near this place western Nara canal or Nara valley drain (now R.B.O.D) drains out water into Lake Manchhar. The remains recorded from the site of Pir Lakho included black-on-red pottery, terracotta cone, terracotta figurines of mother godess and of the bull, perforated pottery, terracotta bangles, terracotta beads of long barrel type, terracotta toys, cart-frame, steatite beads of discoid and other shapes, a cubical stone weight and chert flakes. There is, therefore no doubt that this is another station of Indus and must be assigned to the same period as Mohan Jo Daro (Maunder: 79 to 85:1933).\n\nGhazi alias Gaji Shah Jo Daro\n\nThis place is located at some distance towards east of mausoleum of Gaji Shah, on the bank of Nai Naig in Dhaonk valley in surrounding area of Torri, taluka Johi. This site is locally called as Marikhar Daro or Piyaro-Ji-Mari. NG Majumdar and American archeologist Dr: Louis flame has declared the site of Neolithic and chalcolithic period. Majumdar had recorded here the signs of Indus, Amri, Kulli, Mehi, Mesopotamia and other civilizations (Majumdar: 87: 1933).\n\nKaloi or Ali Murad Daro\n\nThis place is located near village Ali Murad Shahani. According to local traditions it is Kaloi-Jo-Daro but NG Majumdar had recorded it as Ali Murad. This site is between Village Ali Murad Shahani and Bahleel Shah in taluka Johi. First Kaloi clan lived here, near Bahleel Shah. Therefore this mound was called Kaloi-Jo-Daro. This is most ancient place. NG Majumdar had noted it as chalcolithic (Majumdarder: 95:1933).\n\nKotiro Daro\n\nThis mound is located at a distance of one kilometer towards north-east of Wahi Pandhi village. It had been recorded as prehistoric site. Here arrow of stones had been discovered. The civilization relating to Amri, Mohan-Jo-Daro, Mesopotamia and Nal are recorded here (Majumdar: 91, 92 :1933). This mound enlightens over the antiquity of village Wahi Pandhi. Probably, Wahi Pandhi village might have been here on this mound before its present location.\n\nMian Jo Kot\n\nMian Jo kot is sited on a way to Kafir or Kaaro kot, on the bank of Nai Nalli in Khirthar mountain range, towards east of village Wahi Pandhi, Johi, district Dadu near ancient trade route. This kot is named Mian-Jo-Kot by local people. Some archaeologists state that this kot (fort) is related to Talpur dynasty. History of Sindh, Kalhora period, volume-1 writes: “Mian Naseer Mohammad Kalhoro had built kot (fort) in Nalli (hilly torrent) with the consultation of Wadero Jalal (Mahar: 154: 1996). Whereas, same history in second volume writes about Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro that, “Reaching Sewhan (in 1759 AD) he attacked on Joya and fort of Nalli (Nain Nalli) pass that was shelter of Khosas (Mahar: 530: 1996). Through these references we easily can understand that fort of Nalli existed before the Talpur period. The other historical evidences tell that the fort of Nalli near Wahi Pandhi was built also before the Kalhora dynasty. May be Mian Naseer Mohammad Kalhoro had repaired it with the consultation of Wadero Jalal. Yousif Merik has mentioned the name of this fort in “Tareekh Mazahar-e-Shah Jahani”, as Neroon Kot. It writes that, “Previously it was called village Wahi, an aqueduct (Kareez) flows through the fort. The water of an aqueduct comes through the mountains towards deserted area. It is divided into four brooks or channels. The fields are cultivated on its water. In old time it (Wahi fort) was village of Machhi tribe, but Bakhtiar Beig Turkman attacked and occupied. He named it Akbarabad and gave four channels to four Panhwar Sardars: Mossa, Essa, Daud and Jalal.Shamsher Uzbek named it Neroon Kot (Merik: 20, 163: 1994) Further this book of history writes that second state (Pargano) is Neroon Kot, for its best improvement, it will be better that 20 horsemen (riders) and ten cannonries may be settled. This village is 50 miles away from Sehwan (Merik:: 281: 1994).So it becomes clear that Mian Kot is not built in Talpur dynasty but it already existed in Mughal dynasty. Later, Kalhoras and Talpurs repaired it.\n\nPipraser\n\nThe water of natural springs of mountains flows constantly through Nai Nalli throughout the year. Pipraser is most beautiful fountain or spring near flow of this fresh water watercourse of Nai Nalli. The deepness of water of Pipraser is round about 25 ft. The banks of Pipraser are surrounded by Pipal trees. Therefore it is called Pipraser. Piprasar is a compound word of Sindhi language. Pipra means Pipar or Pipal tree and Sar means a lake, a pond or a spring. The local people tell that people of Hindu and other religions use to come for prayers. When we shall glance at history, we shall know that Pipal is religious tree of Buddhists. According to some religious legends of Buddhism, Buddha was born under Pipal tree and he had also started his preaching under Pipal tree. From Mauryan’s to Brahman’s dynasty the highest influence of Buddhism remained in Sindh. The deserted area of Kachho was centre of Buddhists from village Chhini (Johi) to Shahdadkot and beyond up to Jacobabad and Sibi. Stupas up till now exist here in Kachho region. The pictographs of stupas are chiseled here in to the rocks in hilly area close to Piprasar. So it might have remained a worship place of Buddhists. According to local people, the non- Muslims used to come here at Pipraser for prayers.\n\nKafir or Kaaro Kot\n\nKafir or Kaaro Kot is an ancient archaeological site located on a top of the hill on the bank of Nai (rainy stream) Narri or Nalli in Khirthar mountain range towards east of village Wahi Pandhi; Johi District Dadu. This fort is located on a black colored hillock of black mountain (Khirthar is also called black mountain). Thus, this was called Karo Kot (Black Fort) and Kafir refers to non-Muslims. The area of kot or fort is round about 170 square feet. The kot is built, only from east and south edges of the hillock, because these sides were easy to reach at the top of the top of hillock. Whereas the north and west sides are too difficult to cross towards the top of the hill. The walls of the kot are constructed with big bricks made from stone. Now the walls are completely collapsed. In the courtyard of the kot many stones are scattered towards north and west sides. These scattered stones show the collapsed stone made hamlets of prehistoric period. The settlement might have been of Stone Age. The ancient pottery was also found from this site. In view of this pottery, it would be believed that it may refer to first and other phases of Indus civilization. The black-on-red painted pottery referrers to the Amri, Lohum-Jo-daro and Mohan-Jo-daro civilizations. The other terracotta (without any painting) indicates the early phase of Indus civilization. The accurate dating of this site waits for archeological research and observation.\n\nTemple of Johi\n\nTemple of Johi is locally famous as “Qubi of Johi”. Very beautifully and marvelously constructed temple is monument of cultural heritage of district Dadu. Now it is residence of a family belonging to Chandia clan. Close to it, in south, there was house of Hindu priest that has been collapsed and shops have been constructed. For a long time, this house remained residence of civil judge Johi. Near Hindu priest’s house towards west, a big sun-shed was built for travelers. A well was near sun-shed for watering travelers and animals. Later, sun-shed has been demolished. Now, at the place of sun-shed, a shopping centre has been constructed. The pictures of cows, bulls, snake, men, women, gopis and incarnation and manifestations of Hindu deities are frescoed on inner walls of temple. The outer walls are also decorated with fresco paintings. On other hand, idols are made on outer walls. Later, after partition, the idols were destroyed. Some people are of the opinion that this temple belongs to Jainism. But depiction of Shiva, Vishnu, Ghanesha and Krishna is solid evidence for confirming it Hindu temple. According to local legends, before partition a fair had been held at Johi and famous Sindhi singers, Bhagat Kanwar Ram and Master Chandar mostly used to come for performing. Probably, this temple had been constructed in early British period. This temple resembles to Indian and Nepal’s temples. This is unique type of temple and symbol of cultural heritage in this area even of Sindh.\n\nGraveyard of Muridani Jamali\n\nThis graveyard is located at distance of 10 kilometers from Johi towards north. The tombs are the best type of construction. Rajputana, mughal type of art of painting was used in the paintings of tombs (Talpur: 163: 1973). The flowers, fruits, vegetables, birds, animals and other scenes are beautifully, painted in the tomb of Dito Khan (Talpur: 163: 1973). Dito or Datal was grandson of Mureed Khan-1 of Mureed Dero, a devotee of Mian Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro. Except this, paintings of other tombs are the best type Sindhian school of art.\n\nGraveyard of Shahan Fakir\n\nProbably Shahan fakir was a follower of Mianwal movement. The graveyard is more ancient. After the burial of Shahan fakir graveyard was known as Shahan Fakir. It is on the top of the hill. The graveyard is spread on area of about an acre. The paintings in the tombs are a wonderful type of art.\n\nGraveyard of Jangu Jamli\n\nJangu Jamali was disciple of Mian Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro. This graveyard is sited near village Murad Jamali (Haleli) at some distance on the top of the hill towards west-south. The painting in the tomb of Jangu Jamli as is nice as the paintings in Mir Allahyar’s and Muridan’s graveyard. The care by the offspring of Jangu, the painting is saved from damage. It seems as it has been painted recently.\n\nGraveyard of Manikani Talpurs\n\nThe graveyard is located at a distance of 5 kilometers from Drigh Bala towards west-north on the bank of river Gaj. Talpurs came in Kachho region with Mian Naseer Mohammed Kalhoro, who had allotted them Jageers in Kachho from Hetheen (Lower) Drigh to Drigh Bala (Upper). The graveyard is ancient. Its old name is graveyard of Sajan-Ji-Paee but when Mirs had been buried, graveyard became famous after them. Locally this graveyard is known with the name of Mir Allahyar khan Talpur. In this graveyard of Talpurs, Mir Suleman Khan, his sons Mir Hotak Khan and Mir Manik Khan, Mir Allahyar Khan(died in1729 AD) Mir Chhutto Khan, Mir Saindad Khan (three sons of Mir Manik Khan), their family members and others are buried. The construction of toms is very magnificent. The inner parts of walls and domes of tombs are beautifully decorated with paintings. The pictures of man, women, animals and vegetables are painted here. The scene of fighting or battle is beautifully painted. Rajputana, Mughal and other type of art is used in the paintings (Talpur: 163: 1973). Approximately 300 years old this graveyard is beautiful historical visiting point and cultural heritage.\n\nGraveyard of Aararo\n\nGraveyard of Aararo is located at some distance, towards north from village Patt Suleman. Mostly tombs and graves are destroyed. Historically this graveyard belonged to Panhwars. Panhawar’s village Arari or Araro was in this vicinity in Mughals period. Later, Mian Naseer allotted this area to Ganhwar Khan Lund. Now it is graveyard of Ganwarani Lund. The construction of tombs and graves are best type of construction. All tombs and graves are built with thin and slim baked bricks.\n\nVillage Naoshahro\n\nNaosharo is a name of an area of Kachho near Aararo. There were 9 villages in this surrounding area in the period of Mian Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro; therefore it is called Naoshahro, means nine villages. Feroz Veerar, a main commander of Mian Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro belonged to this area. Later, he shifted and settled in Sahati Pargano and established a new village “Nashahro Feroz”, which is now a district of Sindh.\n\nVillage Haji Khan\n\nThis village had been established by Haji Khan Leghari. He had born in 6th generation of Suhrab Kachhi leghari, who was the devotee of Mian Naseer Kalhoro. After Suhrab and his son Alam, Maqsoodo became Sardar of clan. This legacy went to Gul Muhammad of Patt. Haji Khan Laghari and Gul Mohammad Laghari were contemporary period. Haji Khan got influence in late Talpur period and early British period. He became Sardar of tribe and settled at his established village Haji Khan (Husain Badshah: 472: 2005)\n\nVeernath\n\nThe historical site of Veernath is located in Khairpur Nathan Shah Taluka, Dadu District, Sindh, about 5 km to the south of Khairpur Nathan Shah city. Near this place there is now a village called Veeral which seems to be a distortion of the name of Veernath or Veer. Yogi Nath\n\nBy the word “Nath” sufix with the name of Veernath, it can be said with certainty that Veernath belonged to sect of Guru Gorakhnath. It is possible that the village of Veernath became famous because of its proximity to the place of Vernath’s yoga or the Marhi (shrine type). The followers of Veer Yogi Nath might have come and settled down here. Veernath’s place of yoga or execution was later called Veernath and then Veeral. Now the people of the Arain tribe live in this village.\n\nThe opinion of Prof. Muhammad Ibrahim Jatoi provides some guidance in this regard. Professor Jatoi writes in the 2003 issue of a magazine of Government Degree College, Khairpur, “Here is the tomb of saint Veernath. During the British rule, the shrine was in the possession and maintainance of the Hindu community. It is not known when Veernath was born and when he died but his full name was Shri Veer Yogi Nath. The Hindus had built a temple here. Ganga Nath, Jumna Nath and Beja Nath were settled for the maintenance of the temple before the partition of the subcontinent”.\n\nProfessor Jatoi has written about the construction of a Hindu temple, but he has not explained the connection between the temple and the tomb of the saint Veernath, nor he has mentioned the ruins of the temple. He did not even mention the location of the temple. The notable thing is that Yogis of Nath order do not use to build temples. The temple mentioned by Professor Jatoi is probably a temple-like structure over the Samadhi of Veernath which is called Marhi in Sindhi language. I am of e opinion that Veernath Yogi was a follower of Guru Gorknath and he was himself the great yogi of Nath group.\n\nIt is also possible that he died while sitting in yoga and was buried where he died and a Marhi (shrine type) was constructed over his samadhi which Professor Jatoi has considered as shrine. It seems that the Marhi over samadhi of Veernath was built by the followers of Veernath or Veer Yogi Nath after his death. Which later came to be known locally as the temple or shrine of Veernath and it is now called the shrine of Veeral Shah by local people.\n\nThe names Ganga Nath, Jamnanath and Bejanath including Veernath mentioned by Professor Jatoi confirm the faith of Nath. It also shows that Khairpur Nathan Shah’s area was a stronghold of yogis of the Nath sect. Nathan Shah himself seems to be connected to the Nath order belonging to Guru Gorakhnath.\n\nAs far as I know, the ruins of Nath order have been found only in area of Khairpur Nathan Shah and Thar desert in Sindh. It is historically known that the places where Guru Gorknath sat in yoga, Marhis were built over such places by his followers which are still present in the world. Historically, nowhere in the world is any temple of the yogis of the Nath sect. Only, their samadhis and marhis exist in the world.\n\nIt has been already argued that the burial of the yogis of the Nath group is called samadhi and the temple-like construction over it is called marhi. It can be assumed that Shri Veer Yogi Nath alias Veernath himself was a great yogi of the Nath sect. The yogis used to sit in yoga in the jungle, by the lake, by the waters, on banks of the springs, on top of the rocks or in the deserts. Veernath or Veer Yogi Nath may also have been sitting here in the yoga near the pond of water away from town and died where his samadhi and Marhi is erected.\n\nThe yogis of the Nath Panth also often traveled. Mostly, they used to travel to Hinglach which is now in Balochistan Pakistan. In ancient times, yogis used to sit in yoga in the mountains while going to Hinglach. They had three routes from Sindh. One route used to go from KN Shah to Tando Rahim Khan, Lohi, Dureji, Lahoot Lamakan to Hanglach. Second from Sehwan to Naig, Nighawal, Dureji, Lahoot Lamkan to Hanglaj, and third from Ganja Hills and Kanbhu, Karo (black) mountain, Hub, windur to Hinglach.\n\nHowever, Veernath was not Shah but he was a great yogi. It can be said with certainty that Veernath’s Nath sect belonged to Shiva. The Nath Panth was widespread in India, Nepal, Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan Pakistan and Afghanistan. This still survives in the Thar Desert of Sindh. My opinion about Veernath is that this is not his shrine but a Marhi (shrine-like) may built over his samadhi (grave-like) which is locally known as Veernath Temple and now shrine of Veeral Shah.\n\nMany mythical traditions have been related to him. For example, it is said that bathing in a pond near Marnhi of Vernath cures itching. People do this and leave their clothes near the pond. Celebrating the festival day of Vernath have been continued since ancient times and it is now called a festival of Veeral Shah. Anyway, at present Veernath is a unique historical site and cultural heritage of Sindh, Pakistan.\n\nLohum-Jo-Daro\n\nLohum-Jo-Daro is most ancient site of Sindh. It is located at the smallest distance from Piyaro village station. A historicl village Pat is also near it. Chikan Dhandh or Chikan Lake (Now Rukan Lake) is not far from Lohum-Jo-Daro. NG Majumdar had excavated here in British period. He explored the signs of chalcolithic period and Indus civilization. He found terracotta resembling to Amri, Mohan-Jo-Daro and Jhukar-jo-Daro civilization (Majumdar: 49, 50: 1933). Now this site has been demolished and disappeared.\n\nVillage Pat Sharif\n\nPat is very ancient and recorded as an old village of education and literacy in Dadu district. This village exists before the Mughals and Arghuns dynasties but historically it had been mentioned from Mogal’s and Arghun’s period. How and when its name became famous as Pat? It is too difficult to say certainly. Here is a village Khat near village Pat. Khat and Pat are two words of Sindhi language. Khat means a hole or passage made in wall or earth and word pat means erosion by rain or stream of water. Both villages are near Indus River. Except this the ancient stream of River Gaj drained out here near Khat and Pat. Probably, Pat had been named due to erosion, either of River Indus or Nai Gaj. However, this village has been remaining a centre of Islamic education since mughals and Arghuns era. Tuhfat-ul-Kiram has mentioned that Pat is a village in surroundings of Sehwan division. Hyder Harvi came from his country in the days of Shah Hassan Baig and lived in this village forever and died in this village (Qani’a: 296: 2004).\n\nManak Taro or Manak Daro\n\nHistorically it has been recorded as an ancient place of Soomera period. History of Sindh is puzzled or confused regarding the actual name of this place. Basic reason of confusion is pronunciation of name. The foreigner historians, who wrote in Persian or other foreign languages, are sources material of history of Sindh. Being foreigners, they did mistakes in the pronunciation of names of many local persons, places and villages of Sindh. This became the main cause of confusion. Secondly, the translators are responsible in this regard. They have translated without any possible research regarding language and background of name or its pronunciation. Therefore so many names of places or persons are still puzzled. I would not like to go in details. Here I shall give example only about the name of this ancient place. The name of this place is given in the books of history in Sindhi, as Manaktaro (68), Mangtaro, and Mankatharo. These are strange names or pronunciations. Mr Mohammad Urs “Azhar” Solangi has given a name Man-kata Darah with reference of Tuhfat-ul-Kiram Persian version (publication), on page 62 (Solangi: 572: 2006). This given name denotes as Manak Daro. Most probably, the correct name of this site is Manak-Jo-Daro of Manak Daro which is near perception and acceptation. It would be believed that first Manak (may be Solangi) lived here and place was called Manak Daro and later, Jesar Machhi Solangi (Solangi) settled at this place or village.\n\nVillage Phaka\n\nVillage Phaka is an ancient village of Dadu district. It existed in Kalhora period near Khudabad, a first capital town of Kalhora dynasty. Mir Ali Sher Qani’a writes that Phaka is famous village; Sayed Hassan Shah Bhukhari belonged to this village, who was a disinterested, respectable and venerated religious personality (Qani’a: 301L 2004)\n\nKhudabad\n\nReturning from Qalat Balochistan, Mian yar Mohammad Kalkhoro settled at Gaha village. He collected disciples and re-activated Mianwal Movebment. He brought under control many villages of the area and re-established his power. Afterward, he receiving title of “Khudayar Khan” he settled at Shikarpur Panhwarki and renamed it as Khudabad, which became the first capital town of Kalhora dynasty. Khudabad remained as central town of Kalhora dynasty from 1701 to 1728. Mr. Ghulam Rasool Mahar has portrayed the beauty, area and its location with the references of other historians in “Tareekh Sindh: Kalhora Period. He writes that Khudabad was very prosperous and beautiful town of Kalhora dynasty having wide and good bazzars. It was extended over a big area including its gardens. Its gardens were very humorous. The different trees of fruits and plants of flowers were in the gardens. The higher houses were near gardens. A magnificent residence of rulers was in the centre of the town. A beautiful garden was also located at the centre of town. Most probably, Khudabad remained affluent up to early period of Mian Noor Mohammad Kalhoro. When Mian Noor Muhammad changed his capital town, dignity of Khudabad decreased. During conflict between Kalhoras and Talpurs Khudabad was burnt by Talpurs. From 1701 to 1768 this town remained prosperous. But, later 1768 its prosperity diminished. In Talpur’s period it became wholly shattered. Now only a little village exists along Indus Highway at a distance of 10 kilometers from Dadu towards south\n\nJamia Mosque of Khudabad\n\nThe base of Jamia mosque of Khudabad was laid by Mian Yar Muhammad Kalhoro and its work was completed by Mian Noor Muhammad Kalhoro.
