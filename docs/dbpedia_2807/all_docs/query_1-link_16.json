        "text": "This paper aims to highlight Khalid’s misunderstanding of Allama Iqbal’s philosophical thoughts and his philosophy. She admits in her article and acknowledges that ‘he was the greatest romantic poet that this land ever produced’. But at the same time, she forgets that his philosophy is in his poetry. Asrar-o-Romooz and Javed Nama perhaps the most significant works of Allama Iqbal in which he philosophically presented his doctrine of Self (KHUDI).\n\nIn this paper we are much concerned with Allama Muhammad Iqbal’s poetry as well as his prose, because his poetry is the creative amalgamation of the Islamic thought, western philosophy, mysticism and Indo-Pak heritage. Therefore, at times we refer to his poetic interpretations to support our view as Allama Iqbal used both his poetry and prose to express his thought and doctrine. He was worried at the critical state of Muslims suffering all over the world. After fastidiously studying Islam, he was able to identify the underlying factors leading to this downfall. In his presidential address on 25th session of the All India Muslim League at Allahabad in 1930, he says:\n\nI have given the best part of my life to careful study of Islam, its laws and polity, its culture, its history and its literature. The constant contact with the spirit of Islam, as it unfolds itself in time, has, I think, given me a kind of insight in to the significance as a world fact.\n\nAllama Iqbal not only focused on Islam but was also knowledgeable in several religions and their schools of thought. Undoubtedly, Allama Iqbal’s philosophy by and large represents the Islamic way of life. Even so, he appreciated and valued any idea of action and activity from any school of thought. He was against the idea of isolation and segregation that cuts man off from the social system and makes him a pessimist. Therefore, he condemned the platonic theory and advocates the life of pure contemplations.\n\nAs far as Allama Iqbal’s view on tasawwuf (mysticism) is concerned, he was not opposed to it as some people believe, he was only against the depraved form of mysticism that he had seen around him under the Persian and Greek influences.\n\nAllama Iqbal knew that some people couldn’t understand his view of tasawwuf, it is therefore, he had to write a letter to Aslam Jairajpuri when he came to know that Pirzada Muzaffaruddin criticised his view of tasawwuf. He says:\n\nPirzada Muzaffaruddin did not understand my real intent at all. If tasawwuf means sincerity of action (and this is what it meant in the earlier centuries of Islam), then no Muslim should object to it. Yes, when tasawwuf tends to become philosophy and, under non-Arabian (ajami) influences, involves itself in hair splitting discussion about the system of our universe and the existence of God, then my soul revolts against it.\n\nAs mentioned previously, it is evident that Allama Iqbal had a profound understanding of religion. In his first lecture titled “Knowledge and Religious Experience”, when he comes to the doctrinal sides of religion, he mentions professor Whitehead’s definition of religion, ‘a system of general truths which have the effect of transforming character when they are sincerely held and vividly apprehended’. And he further says:\n\nIt is obvious that the general truths which it embodies must not remain unsettled. No one would hazard action on the basis of a doubtful principle of conduct. Indeed, in view of its function, religion stands in greater need of a rational foundation of its ultimate principles than even the dogmas of science.… But to rationalize faith is not to admit the superiority of philosophy over religion. Philosophy, no doubt, has jurisdiction to judge religion, but what is to be judged is of such a nature that it will not submit to the jurisdiction of philosophy except on its own terms.\n\nResearch shows that students of Iqbaliyat are aware of Allama Iqbal’s remarkable versatility and they try to grasp its true significance in order to gain an appraisal of his greatness. But few appreciate the fact that this versatility, while it leads to a large increase in the number of writers on Allama Iqbal, also increases the number of his critics, as each critic deals with a precise aspect of his multi-factorial intellect. This is opposed to a holistic view which is often required to grasp the many concepts propagated in the Allama Iqbal’s philosophy. However, this is it is important to understand that criticism often helps in aiding our knowledge and understanding of a phenomenal thinker of the modern time whose prominence we often misjudge.\n\nIt must also be stated that this increase in the number of critics is likely to add to confusion if the critics disregard relevancy in their writings.\n\nTo illustrate this, we have only to mention that Allama Iqbal was a great poet, a great philosopher, a leading politician and a religious reformer. Now a critic trying to discuss his philosophy deliberately refers to his “Reconstruction of religious thought in Islam”. We were shocked to read the following lines in Salma Khalid’s article:\n\nIn the ‘Reconstruction’ Iqbal uses Quranic verses extremely irresponsibly to prove his points on history, biology, physics, mathematics and what not. He was the modern originator of the harmful attitude that Muslims have since badly suffered from – their tendency to ‘discover’ everything in the Holy Quran while the rest of the world works its brains off day and night trying to unravel the workings of the universe.\n\nThose who do not like the stand Allama Iqbal took in religion, start discussing his Qur’anic references without having any qualification in this area. Such writers void us of relevant knowledge and only fuel further confusion. Allama Iqbal was such a great reformer and philosopher that:\n\nہزاروں سال نرگس اپنی بے نوری پہ روتی ہے"
