        "text": "December 22, 1998 - Progress in human life whether political, social or\n\neconomic has depended upon and deeply indebted to the activities of a\n\ngroup of dedicated persons guided by leaders of exceptional qualities.\n\nThe ushering in of the greatest monotheistic movement in history under\n\nthe nomenclature of 'Islam' was possible and its success assured because\n\nof the sterling character, the imperishable faith and unfailing resolve\n\nof its leader, Prophet Mohammed, and his companions.\n\nMuslim society has the distinction of initiating another unique movement\n\nin history which remains unparalleled by its wide-spread character\n\ncovering the two continents of Asia and Africa; by the remarkable\n\nsuccess it achieved in having its objectives fulfilled; by the enormous\n\nnumber of selfless workers it produced for the propagation of its\n\nideals; by the depth of influence it exercised; by the revolutionary\n\nfervour it aroused, and by the indelible marks it left not only on\n\nMuslim society but on the Christian, Hindu and Buddhist societies as\n\nwell. It provided succour and nourishment to such an extent that Muslims\n\nwere able to withstand the Mongol catastrophy, fight it back with\n\nrenewed vigour on religious plane and then to expand its horizons beyond\n\nthe Sahara in Africa, across the Indus in India and over the oceans into\n\nIndonesia. This movement is known as\"Sufism\".\n\nThe beginning of sufi movement, its philosophy and the biographies of\n\nits leaders (saints) are too well-known, and dwelt upon at great length\n\nby a large number of scholars to be recapitulated here. I shall take up\n\nonly those aspects which are relevant to our subject concerning the\n\nemergence of Pakistan. An important point to bear in mind is that there\n\nwould have been no Pakistan without the sufi movement.\n\nPakistan and sufism are inter-related, inter-woven and inseparable from\n\neach other. If Pakistan's beginning is traced back to the conquest of\n\nthis sub-continent by Muslims armies, as is erroneously done, then the\n\nwhole sub-continent should have become Pakistan since Muslim arms were\n\nsuccessful throughout the area. But Pakistan emerged only in those\n\nterritories where sufism met with success. Pakistan, therefore, can be\n\ndescribed as the fruit of sufi movement. \"Pre-eminent among these\n\nproblems relating to the life of the Muslim community in all regions\n\nsince the twelfth century\", writes Professor Gibb, \"is the activity and\n\ninfluence of the sufi shaikhs and orders. It was into the sufi movement\n\nthat the life blood of the community flowed ever more strongly. No\n\nadequate history of Islam can be written until it, with all its causes\n\nand effects, has been studied patiently and with scholarly integrity, In\n\nno region, moreover, is this study more fundamental or more urgently\n\nrequired than in that of Islam in Indian subcontinent\". He further says:\n\n\"From the 13th century A.D. sufism increasingly attracted the creative\n\nsocial and intellectual energies within the community, to become the\n\nbearer or instrument of a social or cultural revolution.\"\n\nIn its early stages sufism was an individual affair confined to\n\nintellectuals and spiritualists with hardly any appeal to the masses.\n\nBut with the passage of time it acquired new dimensions and began to\n\ndeal with the mundane aspects of life as well. Its beginning, popularity\n\nand propagation have been attributed to many causes among which may be\n\nmentioned:\n\n1. To free religious thought from the rigidity imposed by the ulema;\n\n2. To emphasise in the Islamic teachings the element of God's love and\n\nmercy for His creation rather than His wrath and retribution;\n\n3. To practise what one professes and not merely indulge in slogans and\n\nsoliloques;\n\n4. To stress the essence of faith rather than mere observance of\n\nformalities;\n\n5. To move away towards rural areas from the evil and debilitation\n\neffects of wealth, monarchy and bureaucracy concentrated in big cities;\n\n6. To demolish the edifice of false values based on pelf and power and\n\nrestore morality to its proper place in the niche of Muslim society;\n\n7. To combat the fissiparous tendencies and centrifugal forces which\n\nwere spreading their tentacles in the Muslim world in the form of\n\nvarious heresies;\n\n8. To discourage parochial feelings and eliminate racial pride which had\n\nassumed primary importance in Muslim thinking relegating the ideal of\n\nbrotherhood to a secondary place etc.\n\nThese factors which gave birth to organised sufism were indeed serious\n\nailments which had afflicted Muslim society for some time and had\n\nassumed menacing proportions by the 12th century A.D. It was easily\n\ndiscernible that Muslim political structure was crumbling and its entire\n\nmoral and social fabric facing extinction. The most redeeming feature of\n\nthis dark and dismal period was that this challenge was successfully met\n\nby the Muslim society from its own resources and from its own inherent\n\nstrength by employing its own moral and intellectual weapons. The answer\n\nto this grave challenge was the sufi movement. Sufism gave a new lease\n\nof life to the Muslims, provided them with a bright vision, opened up\n\nfresh vistas for them, and guided them towards unexplored horizons. It\n\nwas a glorious and splendid performance, unparalleled and unsurpassed in\n\nhuman history.\n\nHundreds of devoted workers left their hearths and homes, spread out\n\nover unknown regions hazarding strange climes and conditions with hardly\n\nany material resources to aid and assist them. Poverty and privation\n\nstalked their efforts while distance and inaccessibility stood in their\n\nway. But undaunted and undeterred they marched forward demolishing the\n\ndistances, breaking the barriers, conquering the climes. And lo! they\n\nsucceeded. What was the secret of their success? They had both strength\n\nof character and courage of conviction, were selfless and devoted to a\n\ncause.\n\nSUFISM IN ORGANISED FORM\n\nSufism became organised, and adopted a form and institution in the 12th\n\nand 13th centuries A.D. The two great pioneers in this field were Shaikh\n\nAbdul Qadir Jilani and Hazrat Shahabuddin Suhrawardy. By introducing the\n\nsystem of 'silsila' which was a sort of association/order, and\n\ntakia/khankha, a lodge or hospice, they invested the movement with a\n\nsense of brotherhood and provided it with a meeting place. The 'silsila'\n\nand the takia/khankha were the king-pins of the organization. With a\n\nstream of selfless workers available and with no dearth of devoted and\n\nassiduous leadership, the movement made swift progress and spread far\n\nand wide.\n\nIt is incorrect to state that the sufis followed the Muslim conquerors\n\nin the sub-continent. They were here, though in small numbers, and had\n\nstarted their work even before the arrival and triumph of Muslim armies.\n\n\"We now know that a sufi, Sh. Abdur Rahman, had settled in Ajmer even\n\nbefore Khwaja Moinuddin, and was the author of the first work in\n\nHindi.\"( Indian Muslims, By Prof. M.Mujeeb.). At this time Ajmer was\n\nruled by Rajput Rajas. Similarly, Shaikh Ismail Bukhari came to Pakistan\n\nbefore Mahmud Ghaznavi. Mohammed Alfi who came as early as Mohd. Bin\n\nQasim's time began missionary work in Hindu-ruled Kashmir. \"The Ismaili\n\nmissionary Abdullah landed near Cambay in 1067A.D. and worked in Gujrat\n\nwhen the country was governed by Sidhraj Jai Singh. He and his Jain\n\nteacher Huma Charya are said to have been converted to Islam when there\n\nwas no recorded Muslim invasion.\" (The Shias of India, By John Norman\n\nHollister). Such instances can be multiplied without end.\n\nThe character of sufi movement was such that if did not require official\n\npatronage or military protection. It succeeded without both in a number\n\nof countries such as Malaya, Indonesia and East and West Africa. The\n\nsame is true of their work in Pakistan. In fact, power was a hindrance\n\nrather than a help to the progress of Sufi mission. This is amply borne\n\nout by the fact that sufis achieved least success near the seats of\n\npower in the sub-contintent and had greater appeal where they had to\n\nfall upon their own moral and spiritual resources in which they were not\n\nwanting.\n\n\"Shaikh Daud of Lahore declined to meet Akbar although the Emperor was\n\nanxious to benefit from his guidance and blessings. Eminent Khalifas of\n\nShaikh Nizamuddin refused to consider a proposal made by Mohammad\n\nTughlaq to coordinate missionary activity with political expansion.\"\n\n(Indian Muslims, By Prof.M. Mujeeb.)\n\n\"Neither the succession of victories by Muslim armies nor the massacre\n\nof Hindu and the destruction of their temples brought many Hindus to the\n\nfold of Islam. On the contrary, as would be natural in the\n\ncircumstances, conquest only built up Hindu resistance. The battles of\n\nIslam were won not by Muslim iconoclasts but by peaceful missionaries.\"\n\n(A History of the Sikhs, By Kushwant Singh.) What actually transpired\n\nwas that the vigorous period of organised sufi movement merely coincided\n\nwith the conquest of northern India by the Ilbari Turks early in the\n\n13th century A.D.\n\nHere we shall briefly narrate the work of sufis in Pakistan. Early in\n\nthe 8th century A.D. when Mohammad Bin Qasim conquered Sind (which\n\nincluded most of Punjab) sufi movement had not taken any organised form,\n\nas already stated. In those days Islam was propagated mostly by\n\nmerchants and individual preachers belonging to various trades. They\n\nwere successful only to a limited extent; they did not spear-head a mass\n\nmovement.\n\nThe first organised work in this region was started by Ismaili\n\nmissionaries who achieved considerable success in Sind and southern\n\nPunjab where they gained political power as well by installing Ismaili\n\nrulers at Multan and Mansura. But the success of Ismaili missionaries\n\nwas short-lived. Both Mahmud Ghaznavi (997-1030 A.D.) and, 150 years\n\nlater, Mohammad Ghori (1175-1206 A.D.) defeated and smashed the power of\n\nthe Ismaili rulers which resulted in the slow withering away of Ismaili\n\nShiaism in Pakistan. Among the early Ismaili missionaries to gain ground\n\nin Pakistan were Pir Sadruddin, Pir Kabiruddin and Syed Yusufuddin.\n\nThe success of Ismailism in Pakistan coincided with its similar success\n\nin other parts of the Muslim world from the middle of the 10th to the\n\nmiddle of the 12th century A.D. During this period the Ismaili Caliphate\n\nof the Fatimids at Cairo had emerged the most powerful and Hasan Bin\n\nSabbah's followers in the mountain fastnesses of northern Iran and Syria\n\nhad become a factor to be reckoned with. But the Ghaznazvids, the\n\nGhorids, The Seljuqs, the Ayubids and lastly the Mongols each in turn\n\ntook steps to break their political power, while the sufis completely\n\ntriumphed over them in the religious sphere. Southern Pakistan having\n\nbecome an integral part of the Muslim world from quite an early period,\n\nwitnessed this rise and fall of the Ismailis in its own territories as\n\nwell.\n\nThe Ghaznavid period was marked by the arrival in Lahore of the\n\nimportant spiritual figures of Hazrat Shaikh Ismail and Hazrat Ali Bin\n\nOsman Hujweri, popularly known as Data Ganj Baksh (died between 1072-79\n\nA.D.) The latter was among the leading sufi philosophers of the day and\n\nsince no organised 'silsilas' had started in his time, he did immense\n\nmissionary work in an individual capacity and set an outstanding example\n\nfor future generations.\n\n\"Shaikh Ismail was the first missionary who began preaching Islam in\n\nLahore in 1005 A.D. He used to deliver 'khutbas' every Friday at which\n\nthousands of Hindus embraced Islam. Next came Hazrat Shaikh Ali Bin\n\nOsman Hujweri during the time of Masud Ghaznavi and was highly\n\nsuccessful in converting large number of Hindus to Islam.\"\n\n(Tareekh-e-Sind By Ijazul Haq Quddusi.) He is reported to have converted\n\nRai Raju, a Hindu General of the Ghaznavids, to Islam.\n\nHowever, according to scholars, the general conversion to Islam in\n\nPakistan started on a sizeable scale two hundred years later, from the\n\n13th century, after the Ghorid rule. This period begins with the arrival\n\nof Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in this sub-continent followed by a\n\nlarge number of Chishti and Suhrawardy sufis. This period also saw the\n\nexpansion of Muslim power across the Sutlej into northern India. \"Muslim\n\nmysticism reached India when it had entered the last and the most\n\nimportant phase of its history- the organisation of silsilas in the\n\n12th-13th centuries A.D. In the early period, only Suhrawardy and Chisti\n\nsilsilas started their work.\" (Religion and Politics in India in the\n\n13th Century A.D. By Khaliq Ahmad Nizami.)\n\n\"Sind claims the distinction of being the home of Indian sufism.\n\nAccording to Hasan Nizami, Suhrawardy sufis were the first to arrive in\n\nIndia and made their Headquarters in Sind. Suhrawardy order attained\n\ngreat influence in Pakistan under the leadership of Hazrat Bahauddin\n\nZakaria of Multan. The famous Qadirya order entered India through Sind\n\nin 1482 A.D. Syed Bandagi Mohammad Ghouse, one of the descendants of the\n\nfounder (Shaikh Abdul Qader Jilani 1078-1116) took up residence in Sind\n\nat Uch (now in Bahawalpur) and died in 1517 A.D.\" (An Introduction to\n\nHistory of Sufism By A.J.Arbery.)\n\nTHE PIONEERS\n\nThe great pioneers of this 13th century sufi movement in Pakistan were\n\nthe four friends known as 'Chahar Yar': Hazrat Fariduddin Masud Ganj\n\nShakar of Pak Pattan (1174-1266); Hazrat Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari of\n\nUch-Bahawalpur (1196-1294); Hazrat Bahauddin Zakaria of Multan\n\n(1170-1267) and Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar of Sehwan (1177-1274). It is\n\nsaid that 17 leading tribes of the Punjab accepted Islam at the hands of\n\nHazrat Fariduddin Masud Ganj Shakar. Among them were the Kharals,\n\nDhudhyan, Tobiyan, etc. According to some , Wattu, a Rajput tribe was\n\nalso converted by Baba Farid. Hazrat Jalaluddin Bukhari converted Sumras\n\nand Sammas of Sindh while Hazrat Zakaria and Shahbaz Qalandar attained\n\ngreat success in Multan and the northern areas of Sindh. Saqi Sarwar\n\nSultan converted a large number of Jats and a group among them is still\n\nknown as Sultani Jats.\n\nBut the Sufis did not do their work in a hurry. They first set an\n\nexample of highest probity by their personal acts and explained the\n\nmessage of Islam in a simple, forceful manner without exerting any\n\npolitical or economic pressure so that the work of conversion continued\n\nfor centuries throughout the Delhi Sultanate, through the Khilji,\n\nTughlaq, Lodhi and Mughal periods down to the days of the British Raj.\n\nWe learn that during the time of the Mughals a noted sufi, Shaikh Dawood\n\nof Chati (in Pakistan) was carrying on the work of conversion quite\n\nvigorously. The historian Badauni says: \"Hindus to the number of 50 or\n\nmore came each day with their families and relatives to pay their\n\nrespects to the Saint (Shaikh Dawood) and under his spiritual influence\n\nembraced Islam.\"\n\nOther notable sufis of Pakistan were: Hazrat Shah Mohammad Ghouse who\n\nmigrated from Sindh and settled down in the Punjab; Hazrat Mian Mir, who\n\nwas born in Sindh and migrated to Lahore where he is buried. (A personal\n\nfriend of the 5th Sikh Guru Arjun, he laid the foundation of Hari Mandir\n\nin Amritsar). Hazrat Shah Jamal of Ichra, Lahore; Hazrat Shah Khairuddin\n\nAbul Maali of Lahore, Shaikh Ismail of Lahore; Hazrat Syed Yakub Zanjani\n\n(d. 604 H) Lahore, Hazrat Abdul Nabi Sham of Sham Chourasi who was\n\noriginally a Hindu; Ruknuddin Rukne Alam of Multan who was grandson of\n\nHazrat Bahauddin Zakaria whose family had also migrated from Sindh;\n\nHazrat Jalaluddin Bukhari Makhdoom-e-Jahanian Jahan Gusht of Uch who was\n\nthe grandson of Hazrat Jalaluddin Bukhari; Syed Ahmad Saqi Sarwer Sultan\n\nof D.G. Khan; Shaikh Yusuf Gardezi of Multan (1026-1152); Shaikh\n\nSafiuddin Haqqani of Uch; Pir Jalaluddin Qutub-al-Aqtab who died at Uch\n\nin 1293 AD converted the Mazaris and several other Baluch tribes to\n\nIslam; Channan Pir of Cholistan, Bahawalpur; Sharfuddin Bulbul Shah,\n\nSyed Ali Hamdani and Mir SyedHasan Samnani of Kashmir; Shaikh Badruddin\n\nSuleman and Shaikh Budruddin Ishaque of Pak Pattan; Shaikh Sadruddin\n\nArif, Shaikh Ruknuddin Abul Fatah and Shams Subzwari of Multan; Alaul\n\nAque; Hazrat Khardari Baba Mulla Taher of Ziarat; Pir Hunglaj on the\n\ncoast of Makran; Pir Shori in Bugti territory; Shah Bilawal in Lasbela;\n\nPir Omar in Khuzdar; Zinda Pir in Lund area, Chatan Shah near Kalat,\n\nSultan Shah in Zehri territory. Pir Baba of Swat, Kaka Sahib of\n\nNowshera; Khwaja Makhdum Chisti, Sakhi Sultan (Mangho Pir) and Hazrat\n\nAbdullah Shah of Karachi; Syed Shah Ali Makhi, Ghazi Baba, Makhdoom\n\nMohammad Nooh, Hazrat Mohiuddin Gilani, Shah Khairuddin Gilani and\n\nHazrat Shah Inayat of Sindh.\n\nThese sufis were great intellectuals, well-read and widely travelled.\n\nMost of them were speakers of high calibre, men of letters and poets of\n\neminence. Because of their merits and morals coupled with their\n\nspiritual attainments they succeeded in making a powerful impact on the\n\nlife of the people among whom they settled. It was no mean achievement\n\nto change the religion and transform the entire social life of millions\n\nof people in this subcontinent.\n\nTHE BLESSINGS OF THE SUFIS\n\nThe sufis performed a multitudinous role. Being proficient in learning,\n\nadept in medicine and steeped in spiritualism, they dispensed these\n\npossessions for the greatest good of the greatest number. Highest nobles\n\nof the state as well as lowest strata of society gathered in the\n\nKhankhas and the sufis showered their blessings upon them irrrespctive\n\nof rank and religion. They provided succour to the harassed and solace\n\nto the harrowed, made available food and shelter to the needy, preached\n\nagainst corruption, and admonished the harsh and oppressive rulers.\n\nThere is hardly any social or moral crime against which the sufis did\n\nnot raise their voice----slavery, hoarding, black-marketing,\n\nprofiteering, wine, etc. Barni remarks that as a result of their\n\nteachings \"vices among men had been reduced\".\n\nHazrat Shah Baz Qalander's success in his campaign against the\n\noppression of the local raja and against the vices prevailing in Sehwan\n\nis well-known.\n\nWhen Khawaja Moinuddin Chisti was asked about the highest form of\n\ndevotion, he replied that it was nothing but helping the poor, the\n\ndistracted and the downtrodden. Infact Muslim mystics looked upon\n\n'social service' as the supreme object of all their spiritual exercises.\n\nthey did not believe in isolated, solitary life of contemplation. 'Live\n\nin society and bear the blows and buffets of the people' was the advice\n\nof most of them to their disciples.\n\nShaikh Ruknuddin Rukn-e-Alam of Multan is reported to have remarked that\n\nsince all sorts of people visited a saint it was necessary for him to\n\npossess three things: 1. money; 2. learning; and 3. spiritual ability.\n\nWith the first he could help those who needed monetary aid; with the\n\nsecond he could solve the problems of scholars and with the third he\n\ncould provide spiritual guidance. It may be mentioned here that some of\n\nthe sufis accepted gifts and donations from their rich disciples and\n\ndistributed them among the poor visitors, thus serving as a media for\n\nfair distribution of wealth.\n\nThe sufis always advocated the path of peace and askd people to avoid\n\nrift and bloodshed. Shaikh Fariduddin Ganj Shakar of Pakpattan advised\n\nhis disciples to placate one's enemies. He once told a vistor: \"Do not\n\ngive me a knife; give me a needle. The knife is an instrument for\n\ncutting asunder and the needle for sewing together.\"\n\nAnother aspect of sufi teachings was that they stressed God's love\n\nrather than His wrath; treated their enemies softly, sympathetically and\n\nnever abused other systems or creeds. Though greatly instrumental in\n\nbringing back Ismailis of Sindh and Punjab into the fold of Sunni Islam,\n\nthey always praised the services of Ismaili missionaries who preceded\n\nthem. Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia had commended the work of the well-known\n\nIsmaili missionary Nur Turk although he was responsible for the rising\n\nagainst early Turkish Sultans in Delhi.\n\nThe sufis were so kind and considerate towards people of all cultures\n\nand creeds that they exercised profound influence on Hindu society. It\n\nwas because of the sympathy and understanding shown by them to the\n\nHindus, particularly of the lower strata, that in the 14th and 15th\n\ncenturies AD the religious leadership of Bhakti movement rose from the\n\nlower sections. Never before in the long history of Hinduism, religious\n\nleaders had sprung from that strata of society to which Chaitanya,\n\nKabir, Nanak, Dhannu, Dadu and others belonged. And what is more\n\nsignificant, there was hardly any leader of Bhakti school who had not\n\npassed some of his time in khankha.\n\nThus, khanqhas (hospices) not only brought Hindus and Muslims together\n\nbut they also narrowed the gulf that divided the Muslims of foreign\n\norigin and local converts. If the sufis had not played this vital role\n\nof far reaching importance there would have hardly been a common meeting\n\nground between some of the ruling classes obsessed with a superiority\n\ncomplex, and the ruled who comprised both Hindus and newly converted\n\nHindus. Without sufis, most Muslim rulers of the early period would have\n\nremained isolated, lacking a broad base, always in danger of extinction.\n\nAs against the stiff, nonchalanat and contemptuous attitude of some\n\nSultans towards converted Muslims, the sufis gave them a sense of pride\n\nand enhanced their social prestige by various means. They usually\n\nconferred on them such titles of nobility as Khwaja (also pronounced\n\nKhoja), Momin (Memon), Malik, Shaikh, Akhund, Khalifa, etc.\n\nBy adopting an attitude of river-like generosity, sun-like affection and\n\nearth-like hospitality, the sufis struck at the very roots of casteism\n\nand religious exclusiveness and paved the way for large-scale\n\nconversions.\n\nDiscuss it Further On Our Bulletin Board"
