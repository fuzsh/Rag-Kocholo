        "text": "Baba Fakhruddin Suharwardy was a Sufi saint who lived in the 12th century.\n\nBefore coming to Penukonda, he was a king of Sistan and Shahpur in Iran.[1] His disciples knew him as a true follower of Islam who renounced the world for the sake of Allah. His Murshid (spiritual guide) was Tabr-e-Aalam Baadshah Nathar Vali, who himself was a king who also had renounced the world in a place called Tiruchirapalli (Tamil Nadu). After serving for several years at his Murshid's command, Baba Fakruddin left for Penukonda in order to preach also his dargah is located in ajilamogaru.\n\nHe is commonly known as Babaiah in India and his name has been taken by many men over the centuries due to a widespread popular respect for his legend. Today, his mausoleum is located in Penukonda, Anantapur District, Andhra Pradesh, India."
