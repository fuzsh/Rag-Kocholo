        "text": "That journeys to holy sites are divinely sanctioned, saints are found through dreams or that believers are called to saints’ shrines in waking visions is hardly news when it comes to pilgrims’ accounts of places of pilgrimage. But not always do dreams and visions simply occur. They are evoked by the tactical exercise of sleeping on hallowed grounds like shrines and cemeteries (Mittermaier 2008, 60), they are invited, also anticipated, through intimate exchanges with Sufi bodies and persons (Ewing 1994, 1990), and in some cases as this work illustrates, dreams are enabled via processes and interventions of the state. This text is based on the life history of gender non-binary fakir (ascetic) who relocates to the pilgrimage town of Sehwan on the basis of his_her childhood dreams. A life story is made to converse with the modern story of Sehwan's shrine since its public takeover in 1960. The chapter discusses how the relationship between saints and their devotees comes to be mediated through offices of the state. This is particularly relevant given that shrines are administered under the bureaucratic structures of the state within the framework of the Ministry of Religious affairs and the Department of Awqaf. I make the argument that the state's interest in governing saints' places exceeds its material and financial stakes and takes affective forms influencing the ways in which its subjects interact or become intimate with saints of the state, in this case, also in dreams. Kasmani, Omar. 2019. “Pilgrimages of the Dream: On Wings of State in Sehwan Sharif, Pakistan.” In Babak Rahimi and Peyman Eshagi (eds.) Muslim Pilgrimage in the Modern World, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press.\n\nThe building of Kalabagh Dam-Pakistan's largest hydropower development project-has been stalled for decades. This article interrogates why and how this project has been grounded for so long. It shows that the state and its administrative agencies that support dam building rest their case on \"expert\" knowledge, while dismissing the counterknowledge produced by the anti-dam coalition of environmentalists, nationalists, and spiritualists as \"inexpert.\" Consequently, the dam has become a proxy for contending knowledge claims between the dam's supporters and anti-dam activists. Deploying Habermas's communicative action theory that critiques expert knowledge as \"instrumental rationality,\" this article demonstrates that the Pakistani anti-dam movement's communicative action played the pivotal role in stalling the dam's building. It typologizes actors, defending and opposing the dam, and documents their knowledge claims. The article contributes to the environmental movement literature by illuminating the ways in which anti-dam activists structure communicative claims, and deploy them for the public contestation of instrumental knowledge and interests.\n\nAll over South Asia there is Qawwali, for all over South Asia there are Muslims; where there are Muslims; there are Sufis; and where there are Sufis, there is Qawwali – not the popular version of Qawwali adapted for entertainment in clubs and on the screen, but the authentic spiritual song that transports the mystic toward union with God. Research firstly explored the origin of Qawwali. Secondly it studied the importance of Qawwali in Sufi Music. Thirdly different phases of Qawwali evolution were analyzed followed by the assessment of the difference of Mehfil-e-Qawwali and Mehfil-e-Sama’. This research was based on the literature review and can be a guide to recognize the origin, evolution and characteristics of Qawwali by exploring different dimensions of earlier studies and literature.\n\nThe paper deals with the Mission of Hazrat Qalandar Lal Shahbaz (1177-1274) who played glorious and superb role as a distinctive Sufi saint and poet, for spreading his Qalandariyya order of Sufism, tolerance, peace and love with Allah and mankind, among common and poor people. Mostly, he was itinerant but where he halted or settled, he preached his mission among suppressed people. In this paper, the detailed accounts have also been included regarding the definition and background of term Qalandar, Qalandariyya movement. The Qalandariyya or Malamitiyya movement started from Iran and extensively spread up to Spain. Turkey, Egypt, Syria and, other Middle East countries and later in India. He lived, first in Multan and later in Sehwan Shareef, Sindh, Pakistan till last moments of his life."
