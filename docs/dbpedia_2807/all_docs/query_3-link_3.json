The document provides background information on the origins and early development of Sufism. It began in Arabia as an ascetic movement within Islam in the 8th-9th centuries focused on cultivating the soul through practices like prayer, asceticism, and poetry/music to achieve a mystical union with God. Early Sufis supplemented mainstream Islamic beliefs and practices with an emphasis on developing a personal love of God. While some early Sufis were seen as antinomian, they still adhered to Islamic guidelines and sought spiritual purification beyond just following religious laws and rituals. The term \"Sufi\" may derive from those who lived in poverty with Muhammad or from the wool clothing worn by early Muslim ascetics.",
