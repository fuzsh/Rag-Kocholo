        "text": "Following a meeting with Musharraf and Pir Pagara, Fahim has been rumoured to be creating a forward block within PPP\n\nHafeez Tunio December 22, 2014\n\nKARACHI: A meeting between Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) stalwart Makhdoom Amin Fahim and former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf, the main accused in the Benazir Bhutto murder case, has given rise to speculation that the former is creating a forward block within the PPP.\n\nRumour has it that Fahim is set to join an 'anti-PPP' group, comprising members of the Muttahida Qoumi Movement (MQM) and Pakistan Muslim League-Functional (PML-F), among others. This prompted two senior PPP leaders -- Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Khursheed Shah and former prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf -- to hold a meeting with Fahim on Saturday at his residence in Karachi.\n\nBoth leaders confirmed that the meeting between Musharraf and Fahim took place; however, they insisted they met the PPP leader to discuss 'another agenda'.\n\n“Our meeting was scheduled four days ago,” said Khursheed Shah. Makhdoom Sb is still a PPP Jiyala... He has no differences, and everyone has a right to meet anyone.”\n\nShah said it was not the first meeting between a PPP leader and Musharraf and pointed out that former premier Benazir Bhutto had also met the former military ruler before returning to Pakistan in 2007. He added that Fahim and his family had rendered great scarifies for the party and do not need permission to meet anyone.\n\nWhen asked about differences within the PPP, especially between chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and his father Asif Ali Zardari, Shah said, “They have no serious differences. Both can have a difference of opinion on personal matters, but have agreement with regards to party affairs. “Some sections of the media have created a hype by running such stories.”\n\nThere were also reports that Ashraf had also held a meeting with Musharraf. Commenting on this, the opposition leader said, \"He cannot meet a dictator who toppled a democratic government.\"\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, former premier Ashraf also denied meeting Musharraf.\n\n“Today, we have come here to hold meeting on the request of Fahim. The party is united,” he said.\n\nA meeting between Fahim and Musharraf was held in the presence of PML-F Leader Pir Pagara on Friday in Karachi, and according to sources, Pir Pagara played the role of facilitator between the two.\n\nSome PPP leaders argued Fahim was mounting pressure on the party leadership in hopes of securing an important position in the upcoming set-up.\n\nSome reports also suggest that Fahim has decided to part ways with the party after being constantly sidelined.\n\n“He was neither made the opposition leader in the National Assembly nor was his son inducted in the Sindh government as a chief minister, which was promised by Benazir Bhutto,” a senior PPP leader and close aide of the PPP stalwart told The Express Tribune on condition of anonymity.\n\nRecent differences have emerged following a PPP convention held in Lahore, where Zardari criticised many senior leaders, advising them to leave the party, added the sources.\n\nFurther, the former president had appointed Sherry Rehman as vice president of PPP a while ago, without the consultation of Fahim, who reportedly expressed reservations over the decision.\n\nFahim convenes meeting of Sarwari Jamaat\n\nMeanwhile, Fahim, who is also the spiritual leader of the Sarwari Jamaat, has convened a meeting of the group in Hala on Tuesday to review ties with the PPP.\n\nKhalifas (leaders) of his Jamaat from across the province are expected to turn up at the meeting.\n\nThe stated agenda of the meeting is to devise a plan for observing the 11th death anniversary of Makhdoom Talibul Mola, father of Amin Fahim who was close friend of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and renowned poet of his time. However, sources privy to the development told The Express Tribune that the Jamaat is also expected review its 45 year long relation with the PPP.\n\nA big public gathering will be held where spiritual leaders of other gadis, including Pir Pagara of the Hur Jamaat and Shah Mehmood Qureshi would be invited, added sources."
