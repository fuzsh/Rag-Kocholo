        "text": "Chapter 4\n\nTwo Interpretations of Islam\n\nMaulana Abul Kalam Azad writes in the preface to \"The Life of Sarmad, the Martyr\"\n\n\"In Asia, politics has always been working from behind the veil of religion Thousands of events of bloodshed were cloaked with religion. During the thirteen hundred years of Islam, the pen of the jurists has been like a naked sword. The blood of thousands of lovers of truth was shed on their verdict. Read the history of Islam of any period and you will get thousands of such examples that wherever any ruler decided to shed blood, the pen of the jurist and the sword of the general were with him. Not only the Sufis (mystics) and national leaders were made the targets, even those scholars who were critical and realistic, were made to suffer hardships at the hands of jurists, and they were relieved of their misery only after being beheaded\".\n\nThe present age is in no way different. Men of understanding know the way, in which men have been misled in the name of Islam. Shah Latif says:\n\n[If I reveal of fraction of Truth, everyone will be stunned and mountains will be flown into smithereens. Trees will be gnarled and grass with cease to grow.]\n\nHowever, if we think seriously on this problem, we shall discover that all the ills are due to an erroneous interpretation of Islam. I think that the time has come when truth should be most clearly put before the people.\n\nIn our country, people are openly misled in the name of Islam. From times to time, cries of instituting a theocratic State are raised with all hypocrisy. This baseless and misleading stunt has so much confused the problems of the country that the situation has become really alarming. The well wishers of the country are worried, but it is of no avail. There is only alone way to change the situation; Islam should be interpreted in its right perspective. This way alone, can one draw the right conclusions?\n\nBeyond doubt, for achieving peace, progress and prosperity, religion occupied the highest place in the past. These were the objectives of the major religions of the world. However, unfortunately, these objectives were put aside and religions were used to promote the vested interests of either individuals or groups of exploiters. As a result, despite the outward progress of religions, there exists among men discord in place of unity, hatred in place of love, superstition in place or reason, confusion in place of order. It is evident that religions were not an end in themselves, but they were the means to attaining unity, peace and progress of mankind.\n\nIslam is also one of the world religions. Like the followers of Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and Communism, the Muslims also believe that their religion, apart from being a complete code of life, has the best philosophy. Thus, it is the only way to salvation for the human race. According to this claim, two interpretations of Islam have been presented like other religions.\n\nOne interpretation has invariably been made by the exploiting rulers and the so-called scholars with their own vested interests to protect. The other interpretation has been that of the Sufis (mystics) who gave solace to the teeming millions and were the true well wishers of people.\n\nThe first group was responsible not only for the birth of various religions and sects, but also for creating differences among them. On the contrary, the second group has been striving to unify men divided on account of religious differences into the bond of love, signifying the basic unity underlying religious diversity. Here is a resume of the interpretations presented by the ruling classes and their appointed religious commentators:\n\nThey regard Islam as the last and the only true religion in the world, insisting that all other religions are false and discredited.\n\nThey stress that Islam is the panacea for all ills and it is a complete code of life.\n\nThey consider the Quran as the storehouse of all knowledge and teachings for this world and the Hereafter. So they emphasize on the understanding of the Quran, the word of God as revealed to the Prophet. They believe that it offers a solution to all the problems of all ages and that their solutions are final and eternal.\n\nThey insist on calling Prophet Mohammed not only the last of all the prophets, but also as the last reformer and guide.\n\nThey prescribe some of the words and acts of the Holy Prophet as binding in all cases. They claim that the Muslims are the favorite creatures of God. Their fanciful mind leads them to think that, as a single nation the Muslims are the chosen people. Further, they are destined to lead the world. This leadership shall continue till Doomsday.\n\nNot only that, they consider Islam as the only true and legitimate religion; they regard all those outside its pail as misguided and accursed. They consider it their religious duty to show the misguided ones the right path and spread Islam all over the world. At the same time, they regard preaching and fighting for their religion as righteous acts.\n\nIn order to keep religion and politics under their thumb, these exploiters insist on yoking together the spiritual and temporal spheres. They regard the Caliphs as the representative of the Prophet. Similarly, they consider the Muslim king as the \"Shadow of God\", insisting on his obedience and claiming that this obedience is a religious obligation. In the same way, they consider the interpretation of the Quran and the traditions of the Prophet as the sole right of their favorite scholars.\n\nAs compared to this group, the interpretation given by the Sufis (Muslim mystics) is summarized as under: 1. God, the Almighty, has kept sending His messengers to each and every tribe and nation in every age. The basic aim of the preaching of the prophets has been to promote human well being. Despite the apparent differences in their laws, this reality is magnifiers from the religious order of each of them. Islam, too, has conveyed the message as a manifestation of the same reality.\n\n2. Every man is a vicegerent of God in this world. Thus, he exudes divine lights. Just as sunlight or air can't be the monopoly of any particular tribe or nation, similarly the message of universal brotherhood peace and welfare of mankind cannot be the exclusive preserve of a particular religion or sect. To associate it with a particular religion or sect is to negate the laws of Nature and the spirit of Islam.\n\n3. Religion means leading life according to voluntarily accepted beliefs to preach the tenets of any religion through government or collective organizations, to force it on people by law or power is against the right of individual freedom, which is given by God. Only that preaching can be appreciated which has respect for the individual's rights and which is based on mutual understanding, love tolerance and service. Good preaching is that which aims at winning hearts. Good manners make good preaching. It is, therefore, necessary that politics and religion be kept apart. Religion is a personal and affair of individuals; it has nothing to do with collective or national matters.\n\n4. By associating the natural religion with one group, calling that group a nation, and confining it to some social customs is against the fundamental objectives of religion. Every man of firm faith and good character is loved by God, whatever his religion. Similarly, God does not love a man, who is wicked and bad in conduct, even if he pretends to be follower of Islam. Hence, in the eyes of these mystics, the narrow bounds of religion are born of wrong and misleading objectives.\n\n5. The Sufis (Muslim mystics), therefore, believe that all that which is based on selfishness or all that, which creates bad blood and ill-feeling among fellow men and all that which obstructs unity, peace and human progress is gross infidelity; even if it is done in the name of Islam.\n\nAfter presenting the main points of the interpretations of the two groups, I shall now offer some arguments in favor of the interpretation of the second group, which will show up the falsity of the first. If the state of affairs is not analyzed with jaundiced eyes. The problem is impartially studied in its real perspective, we shall know that the real cause of the backwardness of many Muslim countries like Pakistan is the absolutely erroneous interpretation of Islam by the A exploiters and the credence simple-minded and gullible masses have lent to that interpretation. This practice is not the product of the present times; it has been in existence ever since the death of the Prophet. The Prophet, besides being the Messenger of God, was an administrator of rare ability. Therefore, in his person were combined the tasks of Prophet hood and that of an administrator, which he performed most commendably. However, after his demise, Prophet hood ended. People were divided into two groups on the propagation of religion and the conduct of state affairs. Ever since then, two interpretations of Islam began to be made. One group, as conditions suited it, advocated the organization and propagation of religion through government while the other, regarding religion as a personal affair, laid emphasis on making Islam attractive through good preaching and good conduct. It advocated the separation of religion from politics.\n\nThe first group, putting religion and politics together made warfare as its basic policy. The members of this group diverted the whole attention of the Muslims towards conquest and material wealth, which was acquired by loot. Further, they employed force, coercion, concession and temptation so as to bring the non-Muslims to the fold of Islam. Through the converts made by such means, they measured the progress of Islam. The second group on the other hand, did not believe in increasing the number of Muslims in this way. Instead of attaching importance to the customary beliefs and traditional mode of life, this group laid emphasis on reflecting over the mysteries of Nature and the purpose of creation. Men belonging to this group devoted their lives to the service of humanity and they won the hearts of the people by personal example. They voluntarily devoted themselves to the task of training talented and conscientious individuals. Much above the craving for fame and false ostentation, they abstained from power and other worldly temptation, thus preferring simplicity as a way of life.\n\nSince the ignorant, the narrow-minded, the superstitious and the power-worshipper have been in majority, the interpretation of the ruling class has prevailed. Similarly, since the number of the conscientious, the selfless, the fearless and people caring not for power and pelf has always been comparatively small, the interpretation of Islam of the second group has had limited appeal.\n\nThe moderates in the second group, however, continued to preach despite the ruthlessness of the ruling classes and the unschooled sentiments of the masses. Whatever they could not preach openly, they conveyed through symbolic and language. However, to this group also belonged those who did not believe in expediency; and caring the least for consequences, they settled for nothing less than truth. Such persons the rulers and commentators of religion regarded as rebels. They were denounced by the rulers and the so-called custodians of religion they were subjected to privation and penury, torture and death Hazrat Imam Hussain, Mansoor Hallaj, Shams Tabrez, Sarmad, Shah Enayat Sufi and Makhdoom Bilawal are just a few names in the brilliant galaxy of such lovers of truth. Ibne Abbas, to quote Bokhari, once said:\n\n[The Prophet that if I reveal them today, I shall be killed has told me such things.]\n\nHafiz Shirazi expresses this in the following words:\n\n[There should be no expediency in unraveling the truth. Those who tell the truth have never cared for any expediency; otherwise, truth should have never dawned.]\n\nThe exponent of truth, Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai says in this context:\n\n[O Friend! my secret should not come to my lips. Men of poor understanding shall not be able to understand it, But they will become deadly enemies.]\n\nThis state of affairs is an undeniable proofs of the fact that due to conquest. Coercion and corruption, the number of those who were Muslims only in name went on increasing but the number of those who knew the real teachings of Islam and who practiced Islam has always been limited. This is the reason why, in the opinion of the historians, the so-called Islamic governments of most of the Muslims countries had no relation with the real teachings, objectives and spirit of Islam. The same situation is prevailing even today.\n\nNow let us test the interpretation of the exploiters on the touchstone of reason and logic so as to determined its merits and demerits. As stated in the previous chapter, the first specific slogan of this group of opportunists is that Islam is the last and the only true religion. I shall, therefore, seek to answer two questions here: What is religion? What is the reality of this slogan?\n\nThis subject is very wide. Innumerable books have been written on it. Many more are being written. I have already thrown sufficient light on the issue. However, to refresh the reader's memory, I recount the points again.\n\nHistorical and scientific research has brought the fact to light that man has been living on earth for millions of years. In contrast to it, three religions of the world namely Judaism, Christianity and Islam trace the beginning of man to Adam. It is said that God molded Adam out of clay and infused soul into him. After that, the human race began. Being the prototype, Adam, was the first man and also the first Prophet of God. According to this belief, the genealogical order which the Muslims present; Adam was created only 7,500 years ago. This is entirely against scientific and historical research and is, therefore, fallacious.\n\nWith regard to the existence of man, which of the two contradicting facts is to be believed? That which is a mere conventional belief or the fact which is based on knowledge and research? As a matter of fact, the world has advanced so much that except for the ignorant or those who are confined to their narrow limits, no one can dare refute scientific evading. The hold of science has become so strong that the religious scholars have started interpreting the old conventional beliefs in new ways. However, by means of recent scientific research, the existence of man for two hundred thousand years has been proved. We cannot say at this stage that age of how much more the evolution of man will take.\n\nBelieving in the evidence of historical and scientific research, I am convinced that man has existed on this planet for millions of years. I believe in scientific investigation, which shows that man evolved from the shape of animals to his present physical and mental state. Beyond doubt, it should have taken him millions of years to reach this stage of development. In the early stages, man must have led a nomadic life in the regions where water was available but his life was altogether savage. I agree with the viewpoint of the anthropologists that, during that stage of development. His increasing power of speech and physical needs, coupled with developing mental prowess, gave birth to certain beliefs and rituals which were born out of the instinct of profit and loss but were based on superstition and fear. Those primordial beliefs can rightly be called as the beginning of religion. Undoubtedly, the original beliefs and doctrines were different in every region. However, the cause of their genesis and the need for adopting them was the same. Afterwards, as time rolled on, man came out of the stage of savagery. He passed through different stages such as the nomadic, pastoral, commercial and industrial. Then he entered the age of Science. His original beliefs as well as customs went on changing as he gained in knowledge and experience.\n\nAll the great religions of the present times such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam were born within five thousand years. Even before these religions, there had been religious beliefs and rituals. This is the reason why investigations show that all the present religions appear to be based on the beliefs, customs, prayers and laws of ancient times. The above-named four religions are called major because their followers are in millions and they are spread over various parts of the world.\n\nIt cannot be denied that these major religions made big changes and additions to the beliefs and customs of their predecessors. However, these big changes are confined to a limited conception of God, life after death, etc. In addition to the changes in these concepts, no change could be made. Superstitions, customs, social and moral laws were either kept intact or cosmetic changes were made in them. The founders of great religions knew very well the psychology of the people and had reached the conclusion that their love for convention, ignorance and backwardness would not allow them to be responsive to innovative ideas. Therefore, they refrained from making radical changes in customs and superstitions.\n\nThis is the condition of almost all-great religions. Even many of the beliefs and laws of Islam are borrowed from ancient tribal beliefs and laws. Some of these laws existed not only during the primitive Arab period, but even earlier. Most of the customs and concepts have become so outdated that they have no use in the present time, nor do they satisfy an informed and rational mind. There is no need of continuing any one of them because they appear to be ridiculously useless in modern times. For example, according to the Islamic interpretation of the exploiters and opportunists, the following beliefs are regarded as the pillars of Islam:\n\n1. Belief in a personal God.\n\n2. Belief in the creation of man, life after death, purgatory, Day of Judgment, Doomsday, Paradise, Hell etc.\n\n3. Circumambulating of Kaaba on the eve of Haj, stoning the three devils at Mana, running which is called Saee.\n\n4. Animal sacrifice.\n\n5. Circumcision.\n\n6. Regarding some animals as propitious or unpropitious and some as lawful and others as unlawful.\n\n7. Making offerings for the soul of the dead.\n\n8. The use of incantations, charms etc., for the solution of material problems.\n\n9. Offering of prayers on graves for the fulfillment of one's desires.\n\n10. Prayers and vigils.\n\nBecause, in the above lines, I have called some of these beliefs and customs as having been b~ rowed from the pagan Arabs and also from the superstitions and ceremonies of the primitive ages, I consider it my duty to substantiate my argument.\n\n1. Concept of a personal God\n\nMan needs to invoke some greater force for redress when he finds himself in a state of helplessness, trouble, fear and illness. It was for this reason that, from the very beginning, he started believing in powers he could invoke in exigencies for his psychological satisfaction. Modern research proves that for obtaining psychological satisfaction, he sometimes worshipped animals like a lion or a snake; and during some phase of his evolution, he prostrated himself before the sun, the fire, the river and other objects, treating them as gods. Genie, ghosts and other supernatural elements were no exception. Getting along this way, human psychology inclined towards human worship. There is enough historical evidence to show that there was a time when the magicians, reformers and kings were worshipped as gods. Idol-worship originated from there.\n\nThe idol-breaking religions of later ages regarded the wooden and stone images as superstitions, but could not get rid of the personal or physical concept of God. They conceived God sitting in some form or the other in the skies, creating and destroying creatures, distributing food to, and snatching it from, the people, noting their actions and rewarding and punishing them. Hence, they began worshipping and praising Him.\n\nIn a verse in the first chapter of the Book of Genesis, it has been said \"God made man in His own image.\" There is also Arabic saying \"Allah made man in His own shape.\" This concept of a personal God is revealed from the Islamic belief of the opportunists according to which God is on the seventh canopy of Heaven, seated on a throne. He has hands, feet, eyes, ears, face and body. He is the Creator of the universe, Distributor of food to the creation, Master of reward and punishment Destroyer and Preserver. The last Prophet, Mohammed, met him on the seventh heaven on the eve of his Ascent. On the Day of Judgment, He will descend to earth men's actions before sending them to heaven or consigning them to hell. Noted commentators of Islam such as Imam Malik bin Uns, Imam Ahmed bin Hambal, Imam Daud bin Ali, Imam Abu Timya, Imam Abu Qayyum, Ibne Haitham, Allama Shaukani and many others hold the same belief. (See the Religion of Islam by Mohammed Abdul Ghani).\n\nQuranic verses and the traditions of the Prophet can be cited in support of this belief. Some of them are given below:\n\n[God is seated on the roof of skies] [When God came, the angels came in rows with Him.] [When, in the night of the Ascent, Mohammed approached God, He came down and, between them, there was a distance of two bows or even less.] [The hand of God was on his hand.] [The radiant and blessed face of God will remain.] [The day when the thigh of God will be unveiled.] From some well-known sayings of the Prophet, the bodily concept of God is manifested. In Bokhari and Muslim, Abu Huraira related: [On Doomsday, the fire of Hell will not subside until God has thrust His leg into it so as to extinguish it] [Our God descends from the sky to earth each night.]\n\nIn Bokhari and Muslims books on the traditions of the Holy Prophet, it is related by Abdullah bin Masood:\n\n[On Doomsday, God will put all the skies on one finger and earth on the other]. Hence, these references prove that the majority of Muslims believes in the physical or personal concept of God. No doubt, ever since Muslim philosophers and Sufis have refuted this idea, some of the religious scholars also have come round to sharing this belief. However, among the Muslims, there is no dearth of people who attribute such human qualities to God such as seeing or hearing, being pleased or displeased, etc. There are also a few religious scholars who denounce all those who do not believe in the personal attributes of God. However, such concepts do not lend force either to the greatness or universality of Islam.\n\n2. The Concepts of the creation of man, life after death, Doomsday, Heaven, Hell etc.\n\nAbout these matters, too, the opportunists insist on adhering to old superstitions. They believe that, on the Day of Creation, when God said \"Be'', the whole universe came into existence at once. Along with it, the spirits also came into being. From the spirits, God asked if they recognized Him. They replied in the affirmative. The spirits have been living in their abodes ever since. According to the allotted time, some of them come and inhabit the bodies of men and then go into purgatory where they will live till Doomsday. The spirits in purgatory wander about here and there as in the world. Sometimes they visit the earth to see their relatives. The offering of food, clothing, etc. reaches them.\n\nWhen will Doomsday be? There is no clear data fixed for it. However, some of the indications about Doomsday are that people will leave villages and go to the cities. Before the dawn of that day, an angel will blow a trumpet. The noise of which will shatter the earth into pieces; the mountains will melt and appear like balls of cotton, the earth will be flattened, then rains and rivers will flood it; spirits will come back to their bodies; all men, like insects, will cover the surface of the earth. The sun will come as far down as the height of one and a quarter spear; all mankind, along with its prophets, will be lost in uncertainty; all will have to cross a bridge. Those who have made sacrifices or have got mosques built, will cross easily, the sinners will not be able to do so and will be cut down. On the other side of the bridge, in a vast plain, God will be sitting on a throne with a balance before Him to weigh the sins of every man. Those who have committed sins will be consigned to Hell while those, whose virtues outweigh their sins, will be sent to Heaven.\n\nAbout Paradise, it is said that there will be palaces of silver, gold and gems, lovely gardens in which canals of milk and honey will flow. To serve the dwellers of Paradise, there will be houris, and handsome male attendants. In contrast with the beauty of Paradise, Hell has been painted as extremely horrible. It is said that it will be all fire. The condemned will be tortured in Hell in various ways and they will be consumed by fire there.\n\nExcept for the Muslims, all other men practicing different religions will be thrown into Hell; of the 73 sects of Muslims, seventy-two will also go to Hell, only one sect will reach Paradise. Just as the majority of men face hardships in this world and a few capitalists as well as landowners roll in luxuries; similarly, a large number of the sufferers will be in Hell and some will be comforted in Heaven.\n\nThese beliefs are the very edifice of the interpretation of the Islam of the exploiters and opportunists. They have painted God as such a ruthless and cruel tyrant that He will chastise the whole human race merely because it had not followed the ridiculous preaching of the opportunists. According to their interpretation, The God, the Nourisher and the Sustainer of all mankinds, will turn out to be the patron of a particular sect of the Muslims in the hereafter.\n\nHistory tells us that many such beliefs have been borrowed from primitive religions and superstitions. Inside the pyramids of Egypt, which were created before the advent of Judaism and Christianity, there exist carvings and status which point out the primitiveness of such beliefs. Old mythologies, too, are based on similar Ideas. In view of these realities, I do not understand how these beliefs can help prove that Islam is either a natural faith or that it is the only religion of the world guaranteeing salvation.\n\n3. Circumambulating of Kaba, stoning of Satan, kissing of stone, etc.\n\nMost of these rituals were common among the pagan Arabs and some of them existed even before Abraham. The square building of the Kaba is said to be the ancient temple of the Arabs which was later refurbished and sanctified by Abraham as well as Ismail so as to convert it into a place of worship. It is said about the black stone that it came from an ancient temple. Some researchers also believe that it was the sign of one of the ancient gods called \"Zohra\" which was placed in a corner, in spite of the purification of the old temple. At a fixed time, people used to go there on pilgrimage every year and it was a well-known place of worship. Much like the ancient customs of worship of the sun god, it was circumambulated even at that time.\n\nAbout the custom of throwing stones at the devils, it is said that it is a mark of hatred and protest against the gods disliked by the ancient Arabs and that this is a pagan practice. About the custom of running between Safa and Marwa. It is said that Hajra, the Egyptian wife of Abraham was left there all alone. There she gave birth to Ismail. Perturbed as she was, she ran to find in search of water. Hence, by the grace of God, a spring of water gushed forth from that spot. The ceremony of running is performed to commemorate Hajras anxiety.\n\nIn these rituals, there appears to be significance except that they are old conventions. They cannot, therefore, be deemed as obligations. In order to prove Islam as a complete code of life, the last and the final religion, which guarantees salvation to all mankinds, emphasis on these ceremonies and rituals should not be deemed necessary.\n\n4. Animal sacrifice\n\nThe Quran tells us that Abraham had a dream in which God asked him to offer sacrifice of his son. When he woke up, he tried to slaughter Ismail under divined orders. However, the angels saved the boy and placed a ram in his place instead. The tradition of animal sacrifice originated from that event. The Bible, too, relates this incident but, instead of Ismail, it gives the name of Isaac. However, in both the Holy Books, the sacrifice has been said to have been made under Divine orders.\n\nThe study of ancient religions reveals that the custom of sacrificing animals had been existing thousands of years earlier than Abraham. As a matter of fact, animal sacrifice existed in almost all the ancient religions. Historical research shows that this custom is one of the superstitions of the primitive days. The sacrifice was offered and a man from the tribe was slaughtered so as to appease angry gods or to propitiate them. In those days, God was thought to be such a ferocious being that he would not be satisfied without human blood.\n\nAbrahams concept of God was analogous to this old belief. Therefore, in order to seek His favor, he was ready to sacrifice his son. In the eighteenth chapter of the Book of Genesis, it is written that, at Mamra, Abraham beheld God along with two angels. It was noon. He welcomed all the three, entreated Him to stay, with the angels, washed their feet and feasted them with the meat of a robust calf. After the feast, God communicated to him the tidings that his wife, Sarah, would bear him a son. Both of them had considerably advanced in age, so much so that Sarah had ceased to have menses. However, this prayer yielded them a child whom they named Isaac. At the time, Abraham was a hundred years old and Sarah was ninety. Thus, it becomes evident as to what idea Abraham had of God, but it was in keeping with the general thinking of his age.\n\nIn those days, God was regarded as a tyrannical force that was fond of human flesh and blood. The concept of a Merciful and Compassionate God is a much later development. One is at a loss to understand as to why in the world of today, the ritual of sacrifice occupies a significant position in Islam when it is claimed that Islam is superior to other religions.\n\n5. Circumcision\n\nSome people call this ritual as that of Islamizing a male child but the fact is it had existed long before the advent of Islam and the Jews practice it as well. It began with Abraham. In the seventeenth chapter of the Book of Genesis, it is related that God appeared before Abraham when he was ninety-nine years old and said:\n\nI promise to grant thee a son who will be the father of kings. They will worship me as God. Therefore, I wish thee to get circumcised and direct thy descendants to get circumcised.\n\nHence, Abraham got himself circumcised and his son, Ismail, too. Ismail was then thirteen years old. The Muslims and the Jews allowed this practice to continue in their religions as a tradition of Abraham.\n\nRecent research has shown that circumcision did exist among the savages of the primitive era. The ancient tribes of Australia, New Zealand, Africa and America practiced it, and they had no concern with Abraham.\n\nThe worship of the male organ of god Shive in India and the worship of the phallus in Greece and in other regions clearly indicates that this ritual is in some way or other related to the concept which was prevalent before the age of Abraham. However, to consider this ritual of the primitive age as a religious duty in Islam and to regard it as a great blessing in this world as well as a source of salvation in the Hereafter is strange, to say the least.\n\n6. Regarding animals as clean or unclean\n\nTo regard some animals as clean and some as unclean is an essential religious requirement of the Muslims. The dog and the swine are considered unclean. Even the Jews regard these two animals so. However, the concept of propitious and ominous animals is neither the discovery of the Jews or of the Muslims. It existed among the Semitic Arabs much earlier than the advent of the two religions.\n\nThe origin of this concept can be traced to the era of savagery when man lived in forests and, being extremely superstitious, saw an omen in everything. In the morning when he went out in search of food, his effort was to protect himself from beasts and calamities. His urge for seeking food was the dominant factor. Different things, he regarded as signs of his success or failure. In this connection, familiar animals and birds, and their chirping and movements were good or bad omens for him. At the start of his errand, if he came across an animal which, according to his experience or the experience of his ancestors, was considered as a harbinger of success, it was regarded as propitious. However, if the animal did not do so, it was supposed to bring bad luck. This practice of treating animals as good or bad by the primitive man, the anthropologists have defined as totem and taboo. On the basis of this superstition later on, many tribes made images of the propitious animals. They kept those images with them so that they could glance at them each morning or at the start of their errand. Afterwards, these favorite animals began to the worshipped. Similarly, ways were adopted for killing the ominous animals or avoiding their baneful influence. The worship of animals such as the lion, the elephant, the cow, the snake, the crocodile, the eagle etc. is still in vogue among different tribes. Some tribes and their members are named after their favorite animals and many people see different omens even today in animals such as the cat and the fox.\n\nResearch about loathing the swine shows, that, thousands of years ago, the natives of Fragia and Lydia in Asia Minor worshipped Aetus and his wife, who were god and goddess. In their mythological tales, it was related that the boar killed the god when he went for the hunt. Therefore, for this reason, the worshippers of that god regarded this animal as taboo. The people of that region were Semites succeeding generations of the Semites, much like their ancestors, had the same hatred for animals. As the Jews and the Muslims belong to the Semitic race, they also did the same. (For further details, see Golden Bough by John Frazer).\n\nAs a matter of fact, the swine had become so loathsome among the Arabs, and its hatred had been so deeply rooted in their minds that Islam, too, could not overrule it. On the other hand, Islam confirmed it by declaring it unlawful. However, it is a proven fact that this was neither originated by Islam nor has it such a religious significance so as to be regarded as a fundamental tenet of Islam.\n\n7. Offerings and requiems for the dead\n\nI have already said that among the old beliefs accepted by Islam, one is that, after death, the spirit of man will stay in purgatory till Doomsday. There it roams about, eats, drinks and fulfills its needs in the same way as in this world. Hence, it is incumbent upon the descendants of the dead to arrange for his food and clothing. It is said that offerings of food and clothes made in the name of the dead benefit the deceased in purgatory. With the same beliefs, certain ceremonies such as Soyem (the third day of demise) and chehlum (the fortieth day of the demise) are observed. During this period, recitation from the Quran is made for the eternal peace of the departed. Requiems are held and food is offered to the needy and the destitute. At the same time cloth is distributed among the priests, the poor and the beggars. There also exists a belief that the soul of the dead comes back to his house and when it notices certain ceremonies being observed for its redemption, it is pleased. In the contrary case, it gets annoyed and returns cursing its survivors.\n\nIf we seriously study these ceremonies or beliefs, we shall know that they were not introduced by Islam but had been existing for centuries. The excavations of old tombs have revealed that, in the primitive days, the belief was common that the dead continued to have needs as they had in life. The articles discovered from the Pyramids of Egypt evidenced that the same belief of ancient people led to bury with the dead edibles, cosmetics, arms, carriages, etc. At places, attendants and wives of the dead were also buried alive so that they could serve the dead just as when they were alive. Once upon a time, this custom was common in China. When Chengez Khan, the Great Mongol, died, his wives were also buried with him along with other articles. The custom of Satti among the Hindus in India had the same purpose. In short, there has been homogeneity in the beliefs and rituals among the people of different religions and regions. The Muslims, too, continued to follow the old beliefs but in a different form. They held the ceremonies of distributing food and clothes, of recitals from the Quran and requiems. The Hindu ceremonies of Chaintha and Paat are different shapes of this concept.\n\nIt is strange that the Muslims say that everyone will be rewarded or punished according to his actions. However, on the other hand, it is also claimed that alms and offerings made for the dead, absolve him of sin and pave the way for his salvation. If this belief is given weight, personal acts have then no importance. This concept gives unbridled freedom to the wealthy to commit the worst of sins but earn redemption by providing food to a few priests and beggars. Thus, their inventors will save them from the punishment to be meted out to them on the Day of Judgment. Such ~i belief can in no way be said to belong to a religion which may be deemed as the final and the only faith whose followers are regarded as the best people.\n\n8. Prayers, charms, incantations, etc.\n\nFor overcoming economic stringencies, belief ii] prayers, charms and incantations is also considered Islamic. Many books have been written on this subject and, in support of this belief, references are made to the Quran and the traditions. Beyond doubt, due to Wahabi teachings and also because of the modern compulsions many people have given up these practices. However, a large number of men are still clinging to them. Charms and incantations constitute the source of income for a majority of the so-called priests and occultists.\n\nIn fact, these beliefs are also pre-Islamic and are reminiscent of the primitive age. The difference is that, in the primitive age, magical incantations were intoned to achieve the desired effect. Today, the holy verses of the Quran and the names of God are recited. In the magical charms, impressions of other type were made, now figures are marked according to the Arabic alphabet. The names of the Quranic verses or of angels are also written. The custom of incense-burning or taking a sacrificial animal or other things around a patient's bed is nothing but primitive in nature.\n\nWhatever the importance of such superstitions in the past, they are not only useless but also ridiculous today. If magical charms, incantations and recitation of verses are regarded as an inseparable part of the Islamic faith. To achieve mundane objectives, then despite the claim that Islam is the final religion of the world, the Muslims will forever remain subservient to others for the fulfillment of their needs and can never attain high status or glory. This belief obstructs the struggle for life and leads to escapism.\n\n9. Offering prayers and holding requiems on tombs\n\nVisiting the graves of relatives or of saints and holding requiems and offering sweets is a common practice among the Muslims. About what happens in the grave, it is believed that after the dead person is buried, two angels named Munkir and Nakir enter it, and having made the dead come to life again, they put to him some questions, such as: Who is thy God? What is the name of thy Prophet? What is thy religion? This is the reason that every Muslim is made to recite the Kalima when death approaches. After the burial, such words as \"Allah is my God\", \"Mohammed is my Prophet\" and \"Islam is my religion\" are engraved on his tomb so as to enable him to answer Munkir and Nakir properly\n\nSuch beliefs about the dead have come down to us from the primitive days by which the deads were supposed to participate in worldly affairs. They were worshipped and were supposed to be protectors and helpers of the living. We come to know the full facts about these beliefs from the accounts of primitives of Australia, New Zealand, America and Africa. In Japan, dead relatives are still worshipped. In Egypt, China and Central Asia, the dead was buried after mummification. The general belief was that, even after death, body and soul remained one and if the body was preserved, the (lead would have no difficulty in rising on the Day of Judgment. Along with the shroud, some instructions for the dead were also written on papyrus. In some sects of Islam, the custom of writing on the shroud some verses and a contract and burying them with the dead is reminiscent of the same ritual. Inscription of verses on the graves is considered good by all sects of Islam. The visit to the graves of saints, to entreat, to place wreaths or Chadars to get the head tonsured, to use myrtle, to beat drums or to blow the conch are various shapes of ancient customs. To claim some of these rituals as Islamic is to negate the greatness of our faith.\n\n10. Prayers and exercise\n\nAccording to the opportunists, prayer is the fundamental worship and fasting is a compulsory exercise. These two are among the five fundamental tenets of Islam. Great stress is laid on them and they are considered a vital part of Islam. Most people have been believing that prayer and fasting are the very objectives in themselves and their rules call for nothing except bowing and prostrating. Similarly, fasting is confined to its mere observance within the prescribed time limit. After offering prayers and observing fasts, Muslims think that all their wishes, no matter how outrageous or criminal will come true. It is as if the sheer observance of these tenets does not ennoble individual or collective conduct, but the observance of their tenets, creates a craving for personal desires.\n\nThis makes it evident that the beliefs or rituals, which the opportunists have considered as the soul of religion, are reminiscent of ancient traditions, which serve neither any lofty purpose of this world, or of the Hereafter. Further, these beliefs and rituals have no utility on the basis of which Islam may be considered either superior to other religions or the last and final faith.\n\nIn fact, such beliefs and ceremonies have conventional value and the law of evolution is as applicable to them as to any other field of human endeavor. Human intelligence, knowledge, customs, beliefs and codes of life have been progressing on the basis of experiments and social change. Therefore, in moral and social codes, in religious beliefs and rituals, changes are sure to take place in future according to changing needs and requirements. Therefore, to regard temporary rituals and beliefs as immutable is contrary to the larva of evolution. To confine things to the conventional beliefs, whose beginning and end are not fully known, is not only ignorance of the law of Nature (evolution) but also a proof of lack of intelligence. To regard conventional beliefs, as real Islam is a well thought-out plan of the opportunists so that they may retain their hold on the Muslim masses and people and keep them embroiled in petty affairs so that they may continue to be exploited. The opportunists are not concerned about Islam in the pursuit of their personal ends.\n\nBeyond doubt, Islam can be called a world religion. It is because the number of its followers runs into millions and they live in almost every part of the world. By this definition, Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and Communism can also be called world religions. However, by calling Islam a world religion, if it is meant that the welfare of the whole world depends on its acceptance, especially, on the interpretation of Islam as made by the opportunists, it is not only self-deception but also an affront to the real teachings of Islam.\n\nWhatever I have said in the foregoing pages can be summarized thus: in the beginning, the purposes of all religions were the same - peace, progress and unity of mankind. Thus, the beliefs and rituals of all religions were almost identical. However, as regional needs, vested interests and environment demanded change, the outward appearance and contours of religions changed. In the opinion of truth-lovers, these changes occurred only in such beliefs and rituals, which had been purely exhibitive and which were practiced by the illiterate people or those who were convention-bound. These beliefs and rituals have never had any value for the truth-lovers. The real objective and common ideals of religions have always been before them. They have full faith in the abiding truth of religions.\n\nThe following verses of the Quran are clearly opposed to the narrow interpretation of Islam, which is made by the opportunists. These verses confirm the point of view of the truth-lovers:\n\nAddressing the Holy Prophet, God says:\n\n[Believers are they who believe in what was revealed unto you and what was given to those before you.] It means that, in the eyes of God, a true Muslim is that who does not differentiate between the books and teachings of previous prophets and the teachings of the Holy Quran. Had there been any difference among them, God would not have enjoined the Muslims to believe in the Books that were revealed before the Quran. [Among the Muslims, Jews, Christians and followers of other religions those who believe in God, the Day of Judgment and perform good deeds, they shall reap due reward and attain salvation.] By reposing faith in God, it is meant that there be faith that the universe in created under a plan and God is its Creator and Administrator. Similarly, by reposing faith in the Day of Judgment, it is meant that there be faith in evolution and future of man. By good deeds, it is meant that all efforts be made for the progress, peace and unity of mankind. [It means that Prophet Mohammed and true Muslims believe in what was given to them by God. All of them believe in God, His angels, His Books and the veracity of His prophets. They know that there is no difference and contradiction in the teachings of all of His prophets]. From this verse, the truth becomes abundantly clear that in the background of different prophets and books, the Oneness of God is immutable and that it is essential to repose faith in the evolution of religions. So, it becomes clear that, unlike the claim made by the opportunists, Islam cannot be regarded as a negation or contradiction of other religions. If it is thought to be so, it will be contrary to the spirit of Islam.\n\nThe Second Claim of Opportunists\n\nThe second claim of the opportunists is that their interpretation of Islam offers a solution for all the problems facing the human race and it is a complete philosophy of life. Before discussing this claim, I think it is necessary to answer two important questions:\n\na) What are the problems of the human race, which can be solved through Islam?\n\nb) What complete philosophy of life does Islam present?\n\nThe problems of the human race\n\nThese are two kinds of problems: fundamental and temporary.\n\nFundamental problems\n\nFor men in every age and region, the fundamental problems of hatred, violence disaffection, ignorance superstition, poverty, hunger etc., have existed for centuries. If it is claimed that Islam can offer a solution to these problems, then the interpretation of the opportunists does not make any sense. The correct solution can, of course, be found in the interpretations of the truth-lovers and the Muslim mystics. The interpretation of the opportunists, on the other hand, not only gives birth to many problems but also complicates them further. Not only among other men but even among the Muslims, the interpretation of the opportunists fans the flames of hatred and discord, thus sowing the seeds of rigid sectarianism. The so-called priests spare no time in vindicating these explanations because the opportunists pay them. Therefore, in return for the money received from the opportunists, the Muslim priests create an atmosphere, which is charged with hatred and animosity. They also incite their co-religionists to take recourse to violence and assault their opponents, promising Heaven in the Hereafter in return. Emphasizing their dogmatic faith and exhibitionist rituals, they exhort people in the name of God and the Prophet not to adopt a rational and healthy outlook. They make free use of all the inventions of the West in their daily life, but keep on denouncing all the modern sciences, which have made them possible. Thus, they decree against the study of these sciences by the Muslims. Therefore, the question arises as to how Islam, as interpreted by such unscrupulous people, can solve the problems of the Muslims and of the whole human race except by serving the vested interests of the so-called Muslim priests and their masters? Further, in order to conceal their ignorance, the opportunists claim that their version of Islam alone can be the panacea when all humanity has embraced it. It is as if problems cannot be solved without all human beings converting to Islam, even if they get annihilated in the process.\n\nIn changing conditions, new problems will continue to crop up in every country and in every age. For the solution of these problems, a rational approach in keeping with changing requirements will have to be made. To prescribe one and the same medicine for all diseases amounts to ignorance or self-deception. Take, for example, the problem of poverty. In the Islam of the opportunists, there exists no other solution except extorting money in the name of Zakat (ceases), alms and abolition of interest although modern economics has no relationship with the economics of Islam. Similarly, there is a great deal of difference between medieval and modern social life. A detailed discussion will follow in the coming chapters. In these lines, I wish to say that all those men who, ignoring the urges of the present times, regard Islam as a solution for all human ills and problems and thus affirm the interpretation of the opportunists, either deliberately try to hoodwink the people or have jaundiced eyes. As such, their vision is completely blurred. A critical study shows that the interpretation of Islam made by the self-seekers gives birth to a special theory which:\n\na) Throttles democracy and paves the way for dictatorship.\n\nb) Creates hatred and ill felling among men in the name of religion and sect.\n\nc) Impedes rational and scientific inquiry on the basis of supernatural or metaphysical elements.\n\nd) Pollutes the peaceful atmosphere and induces co-religionists for waging a war against people with different beliefs.\n\ne) Advocates the right of retaining private property, thus thwarting plans through which the poverty of general masses can be eliminated.\n\nf) Distracts the attention of men from the real issues of life, purveying primitive beliefs and rituals as true religion.\n\ng) Creates fascist tendencies in the Muslims misguiding them into thinking that they are the chosen people ordained to rule the world.\n\nh) Lays great stress on formalism and ritual making the followers deviate from the cardinal principles of Islam.\n\ni) Strengthens conventionalism, completely losing sight of the demands of the law of evolution.\n\nj) Negates the feeling of brotherhood and of human dignity, creating simultaneously an atmosphere, which is charged with discord and hatred.\n\nSecondary problems\n\nThese problems vary and are caused by regional and geographical conditions For instance; the difficulties and problems of the cold countries are different from those of the tropical ones. The days and nights in the regions adjoining the Poles are very long. In these conditions, the fixed duration of twelve to fourteen hours cannot be practicable. For example, it will be difficult to offer five prayers and observe a one-month fast in a region where, for twenty-four hours or more, the sun neither rises nor sets. This proves that problems change according to time, space and other conditions. Therefore, their solution should be also different. A single principle or formula cannot be applied to all regions.\n\nThe same holds true with regard to cultural conditions in different regions in different stages. The primitive man lived under different conditions and had different requirements. He lived in the hollows of trees. He took shelter in the caves. He lived all naked. He was ignorant of fire weapons instruments and mode of cultivation. His daily search for food, safety from wild animals1 helplessness against natural calamities, lack of permanent abode and means of subsistence had compelled him to pass each moment of his life in the agony of perpetual fear and superstition. To suit these conditions and to satisfy his inner self, he invented certain beliefs and rituals. After that stage, developing gradually, man entered the Bedouin phase of his evolution. During that period, he started rearing animals to get milk and meat. This led him to the pursuit of new pastures. He was also exposed to certain new challenges and clash of interests. For the solution of his problems, man adopted the tribal pattern of collective life. However, the problems of the stage of development were certainly different from those of the primitive age. With the passage of time, he got disgusted with nomadic life and started permanent habitation along riverbanks. During that period, he learnt cultivation, started living in small groups and built cottages. In those days, cutting of forests, bringing virgin land under the plough, garnering grain, braving the elements and for protecting his village, he had to evolve methods other than those he had employed in his Bedouin days. After-wards, human society passed through other stages such as commercial, technical and scientific. Now the question arises: will the problems of the present stage of evolution not be different from those of the agricultural stage? Further, for the solution of the present-day problems, will not new demands and urges be given due consideration?\n\nHowever, inspite of it, it is claimed that the opportunists interpretation of Islam with all its rituals is the solution of the problems of every age. It is nothing but ignorance and self-deception. The problems of life have always been changing under the exigencies of time and will continue to change in future as well. The laws framed fourteen hundred years ago for solving the problems of that time cannot be applied to the problems of today or those of tomorrows. Such an insistence would be against the eternal dignity of Islam. Just as the cure for every disease is according to the nature of the malady and the condition of the patient, so is the solution of a problem in accordance with the needs and demands of time. To seek a solution for the problems of all times and all regions is the very negation of the limitless variety of Nature.\n\nIn this connection, many hue and cries is raised in the name of the Shariat and the Sunnah. Although many such things are revealed from the words and deeds of the Holy Prophet, which prove that, in the domain of wordily affairs and conventional beliefs, he liked people to think and act according to their power of intellect, comprehension and experience.\n\nFor instance, somebody once asked him about the Day of Judgment. He frankly answered \"I dont know\". However, if you ask a Muslim priest the same question, he will arrogantly and authoritatively give such details of the old mythological belief as if he had personally knowledge of it. In fact, by the Day of Judgment is meant a happy future for man and for this world. This meaning is not my own interpretation, but ~t was given by Shaikh-UL-Akbar Mohiuddin Ibne Arbi, a great scholar, researcher and philosopher of the Muslim world. He says:\n\n[The term called the life to come is in the process of perpetual happening the world is neither to come to an end completely nor is determined its limit: Doomsday is ever continuing. This world and life Hereafter are only the different names of the new manifestations appearing under the forces of time and space. These are reflections of changing shapes. One shape disappears; another comes into being, This change will continue forever. Today is the Doomsday for yesterday; and for today, it will be tomorrow].\n\nFrom the answer as given by the Holy Prophet it is proved that regarding this traditional belief, he did not wish to prophesize and, therefore, left it to the people to decide for themselves. In the same way, there is another narrative that once the Messenger of God happened to pass through a date orchard. At that time, the grove keepers were busy in cross-fertilizing the trees. The Holy Prophet forbade them from doing so and said, Nature will itself perform this task. The grove-keeper obeyed. However, that year, the dates not were much print. When the Prophet was told about it, he said:\n\n[In future, you cross-fertilize the dates according to your wish and experience. My job is Prophethood. It suits me not to interfere in every affair].\n\nThis instance makes it abundantly clear that he gave due weight to the opinion of the experts in their chosen fields and he allowed them the fullest freedom to express their opinion.\n\nIt is an open secret that the Prophet of Islam performed his duty in a dual capacity, as a political and social administrator and as a prophet of God. This is the reason why he made two different pronouncements about himself. When he discharged his duties as an administrator, he said, Verily, I am a human being like you. Having said this, he confessed that acts of human virtue and otherwise could be committed by him. Therefore, in this capacity, he regarded himself a creature of God, as every other man. He, therefore, prayed to God to save him from faltering and committing transgressions. In other capacity, he claimed to be very close to Providence and the Ascent confirmed his exalted position. In the latter capacity, he was \"Ahmad\" without the letter \"m\" and \"the city of knowledge\" too. Therefore, to confuse the two positions is to distort reality.\n\nThis distinction makes it clear that the injunctions made by the Holy Prophet or as revealed in the Book regarding the permanent or temporary problems or the social conditions of the age, are not of lasting nature. After social condition had changed, these injunctions lost their utility. To regard them as binding for all ages and conditions is against the spirit of Islam, and the laws of Nature and the will of the Prophet.\n\n*Without the letter \"m\", the word \"Ah mad\" is to be spelt as \"Ahad\" which means Unique\".\n\nAhad is one of the attributes of God.*\n\nSo as to further expose the drawbacks of the interpretation of Islam as made by the self-seekers and opportunists, it will be better to judge them in the light of the problems of our own times. Let us see if a correct solution of the problem lies with them. In my opinion, the following are the main problems in the present-day world, which have caused a lot of chaos and confusion: a) Despotism or dictatorship\n\nb) Poverty\n\nc) Vested class interests\n\nd) Force and violence\n\na) Despotism or dictatorship\n\nOf all the systems that mankind has experienced the despotic system has been the most horrible. With the increase in the number of weapon of mass destruction in the modern world, the probability of a holocaust cannot be weapon of ruled out. This dangerous tendency can be overcome by promoting brotherhood, the spirit of tolerance and respect for human freedom and dignity. Can these virtues be inculcated in the followers of a faith, which is based on prejudice, narrow-mindedness and extremism?\n\nDespotism is a system under which a group belonging to a certain race, creed, color, political or religious belief may impose its will on others, claiming that its ideology is the only remedy for the well being of the whole human race. At the same time, it may reject or regard as inferior the arguments and experiences of others, coercing them accept its ideology. No one should be allowed the right of dissent nor should its command be disobeyed or any argument is entertained, howsoever convincing it may be. A particular person or group may assume power or leadership and others are forced into blind conformism.\n\nNow take a look at the opportunists, their preaching, their feelings and their behavior in the light of it. Dont they discard all other ideologies and beliefs, only upholding their own ideology and faith as legitimate? Dont they create an atmosphere charged with religious frenzy only to intimidate and cow down their adversaries? Havent they monopolized Islam, the interpretation of the Quran and the exegesis by force? There will be no other answer to such questions except in the affirmative. This proves that ideology; faith, feeling and behavior of the opportunists are governed by despotic tendencies.\n\nAccording to the real teachings of Islam, dictatorship is not only an evil of the worst order but it is also most detrimental to the life of a nation. As far as Islamic teachings go, man is the vicegerent of God on earth and all human beings are bound by ties of equality, fraternity and brotherhood. No doubt, administrative responsibilities can be different, but on account of them, no one can be a permanent ruler and be entitled to any distinction or a special status. Similarly, no one is a subject or an inferior being forever. This is the reason why the Holy Prophet, despite being the Apostle of God and the administrative head of the Muslim State, had no trappings of power with regard to his living, dress and public dealing. He used to live like a commoner. He mixed with the common people and answered their questions with all politeness. He held respect for humanity so dear to his heart that he did not like even a Bedouin to stand up to honor him. Beyond doubt, he shunned all such negative values, which created division between man and man on the basis of color, creed and caste. He taught the lesson of equality, fraternity and humanism. The Prophet of Islam set mankind on the path of unity, progress and prosperity.\n\nThe Muslim mystics have shed light on this aspect of Islamic teachings. However, since this jeopardized the vested interests of the exploiters, they hatched plots against them, regarded them as heretics and finally got them sentenced. The dictators of the present age are also inflicting punishment on all those who stand for liberalism. How true was Shah Waliullah when he said:\n\n[Discard all the worthless systems and adopt new modes of life in the light of reason.]\n\nHowever, the interpretation of Islam by the opportunists has always been in favor of dictatorship.\n\nHow can the commentary (on Islam) of the self-seekers be expected to shield people and their interests?\n\nb) Poverty\n\nIn the world today, the problem of poverty, which the largest segment of human society is suffering from, is of utmost importance leaving aside other countries, if Pakistan is to be viewed, the largest number of its people are deprived of food, clothing, housing, medicines and job opportunities. They are denied basic necessities of life. Only five per cent of the total population of the country is prosperous.\n\nAccording to the interpretation of the opportunists, the solution lies in the abolition of interest and those who are in a position to give charity and Zakat. But the question arises: can charity and religious Zakat create sufficient means by which poverty can be eliminated and the basic necessities of life provided to every citizen? The answer has to be a big \"NO\".\n\nIt is evident that Zakat is levied on money, silver, gold and heads of cattle. It is neither determined on property nor on income. These days, no one keeps cash in his house. People either keep their money in banks or invest it is business and industry. The banks advance the deposited money on loan to business and industry. In case of the abolition of interest, people will neither deposit money with the banks nor will the banks be able to advance loans. Therefore, investment will come to a halt. There will be a cessation of all commercial activity and the country will suffer immeasurably\n\nAt present, two economic systems are in vogue -capitalism and socialism. The capitalistic system exists in banks industries and big private enterprises by virtue of which only a few prosper, but the majority of men get poor. In the socialistic system, the concept of private property does not exist. Production and means of production are controlled by the state. Therefore, the state becomes responsible for providing food, clothing and housing to the people. Islam negates both systems. On the one hand, it is against the abolition of private property and by abolishing interest, it calls for realization of 2.5 per cent as Zakat and puts restrictions on its expenditure on the other.\n\nAs compared to the past, state machinery has become very large. For its operation and smooth functioning, large sums of money are needed. This money is acquired taxes on different items. Taxes are imposed on commodities directly or indirectly or by both methods. If people pay different taxes and they are made to pay Zakat at 2.5 per cent of the principal amount each year, they will not only get overburdened, but commercial activity will very likely collapse. Further, people will have to relapse into the primitive ages.\n\nAs far as charity is concerned, it cannot be accounted at all. It is purely a voluntary act. For its realization, neither can a rule be framed nor can one be forced into being charitable. However, it has become evident that the self-seekers and their version of Islam offer no practicable solution for the eradication of poverty, which has the majority of our countrymen in its grip. Nor do these self-seekers have the ability to solve the problems facing the people.\n\nc) Class interest\n\nThe third formidable problem, which the world is presently confronted with, is the exploitation of the people by a class with vested interests. To this, Class belongs to the capitalists; the religious leaders fed on the charity and contributions of the capitalists, the imperialists and their agents. These people keep on trying to get hold of the government in one way or the other, leadership, wealth, production and its distribution. They try to make the most of these sources for their own benefit. Consequently, the majority is doomed to perpetual poverty. In order to perpetuate their power, the exploiters try to thrive on the slogans or individual freedom and religion. The Russians and people in other countries got fed up with religion and fraud in the name of individual freedom because these slogans did not deliver the goods. On the other hand, they shielded the interests of the exploiters. At the moment, Pakistan is the only country in the world where exploitation of religion is at its highest. Efforts are being made to present the real Islam through its misinterpretation. Undue advantage is taken of the simplicity of the people and their innate love for Islam. Thus, to benefit the vested interests of a class, slogans are being raised for the Islamic system, Islamic constitution, Islamic education, Islamic leadership Islamic society, etc. Behind these emotion-charged slogans, religious and sectarian feelings are also fanned against those who are the well wishers of the country and the people.\n\nThere is no denying the fact that the slogan of Islam did play its role in the genesis of Pakistan, but despite that Quaid-I-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah, discarded theocracy and the role of religion in affairs of state in his speech delivered in the Constituent Assembly on August 11, 1947. After scores of years, religion is being revived today so as to demean and degrade the Muslims. Hectic efforts are being made to run the country on religious lines. It is evident that, as in the past, the fruits of this slogan will go to the bureaucrats, industrialists landlords, traders and the Muslim priests who are living on the crumbs of these industrialists and traders. Very true was Sachal Sarmast when he said:\n\n[Until the pulpit, the mosque and the minarets are not destroyed, 0 Sachal truth shall not prevail.]\n\nThis analysis proves that the self-seekers and their misinterpreted Islam are themselves the exponents of class conflict loot and plunder. Further, they have no formula for saving the world from the clutches of misery.\n\nd) Force and violence\n\nThe fourth important problem of the world today is the use of force and violence. It is a matter of grave concern that instead of settling disputes through negotiations and mutual understanding, violent means are employed for their solution. So long as this tendency prevails, there will neither be internal harmony and peace within the countries nor will there be a guarantee of safety from the menace of atomic destruction. Because of some of his qualities, man is the best and the noblest of all creation. However, brutality is the vice, which, at times, turns him to be worse than animals. To compel someone to accept a particular creed or way of life on the basis of brute force or terrorism is such a savage feeling for which there exists no place in a cultured society. The good men of every age have regarded violence as contemptible.\n\nThe past, history of man is full of grave and tragic events, which were caused by violence. Today, man has advanced in almost every walk of life. He has, by and large, attained control over the forces of Nature. Large and beautiful cities have sprung up all over the globe, but the way the human population is concentrated, the use of brute force can prove a thousand times more destructive than at any time in the past.\n\nThe foundation of the two major religions of the world was laid on non-violence. One of them is Hinduism and the other is Christianity. The high-caste Hindus do not eat meat because of their belief in nonviolence. Their ancestors used to say that torturing animals was nothing short of a sin. However, history is witness that their descendants, by resorting to violence, converted millions of men into untouchables. Mahatma Gandhi attained freedom for India through the weapon of non-violence, but in his free country even today, the Hindus very often let loose the orgy of communal violence.\n\nFor the Christians, the teaching of Jesus Christ, were if somebody hit you on the right cheek, turn to him the left cheek. Meaning thereby that, violence should not be retaliated with violence and that effort should be made to win the heart of the enemy through love, affection and good conduct. Millions of men in Europe, Canada, America and other parts of the world are the followers of Christ. Do they really subscribe to his teachings? Are they not the same people who have set up military bases all over the world and have subjugated more than half the people on this planet? Are they not the same people who were responsible for two World Wars in which millions of innocent people were killed and seriously wounded? Is it not a fact that despite their admission of colossal devastation in the two wars and posing themselves as the champions of peace, they have discarded its use, and in spite of subscribing to the Charter of the United Nations, they are bent upon stockpiling deadly weapons? In these circumstances, hope could be pinned only on Islam, which is basically, and essentially a religion of peace. However, it is equally deplorable that the color, in which the opportunists have painted Islam, has presented it as an advocate of violence. In this context, significant is the meaning of Jihad (holy war) as interpreted by the opportunists. In Islam, there exists no concept of an offensive war. It is always defensive. However, unfortunately, the interpretation of the self-seekers gives the impression that, in Islam also, the use of force is not only justified but also it is expedient as well. The Muslims have, as a result of this extremist belief, suffered a lot. Notwithstanding the glaring differences among Muslim mystics, Muslim rulers and the self-seekers have not desisted from provocative publicity of this belief.\n\nIn Pakistan, the self-seekers are engrossed in grinding their own axes in the sacred name of Islam. To usurp the rights of the smaller provinces against the wishes of their people. To trample democracy, to divert the attention of people from the real issues of life. To deprive men of their rights, to fan the flames of religious and sectarian feelings. To serve the vested interests of the rulers and a few bigoted obscurantists. to let loose a reign of terror in order to browbeat the opponents, to raise false and hollow slogan about religion, to impede new and progressive forces and to thwart all attempts of the saner element to create a truly egalitarian society are some of the achievements of this group. According to the creed of the mystics or the real spirit of Islam, such cruel acts are not only the un-Islamic but unadulterated hereticism. Force and violence breed discord and disunity while Islam preaches love and peace. It regards coercion or the use of force as sin.\n\nSo grossly unjust and impervious to reason are these misguided obscurantists that if a Muslim finds it hard to be in agreement with their interpretation of Islam, they instantly condemn him as a renegade. This form of excommunication is the only device, which these opportunists have so far been able to discover. It means that Islam is not the order of God but is a limited company and they are its directors and proprietors.\n\nPeople believing in the true ideology of Islam and the Muslim mystics have their faith in Jehad (holy war). But their faith is absolutely different from that of the opportunists. Unlike the obscurantists, they do not believe in usurping the rights of the people and in crushing their opponents, but in controlling themselves. They seek their enemy not outside their being but from within themselves. They deem selfishness, self-worship, violence, bigotry and hatred not only their own enemies but also the enemies of Islam. For a mystic, every man is a manifestation of divine virtues. He hates no one even the lowest.\n\nAccording to the obscurantists, religion is not a personal affair of man: the Muslim priests and the rulers are also assigned a role. This interpretation safeguards their interests. Consequently, the priests and the rulers other affairs of the people. As they try to measure all the affairs by the yardstick of religion, they exploit men in the worst manner, making their lives most miserable.\n\nThe Western countries denounce the socialistic system on the plea that it makes no provision for human freedom and men has no greater value than that of a gadget in a machine. However, perhaps they do not know that in a Muslim society, which is governed in the light of the interpretation of the self-seekers, the condition of a common man is far worse than that in the socialist system. In socialist states, individual freedom is restricted for the collective good of society. However, in fake Islam, the same thing is done to serve the interests of a coterie of men. In a socialist country, the majority of the Communist Party interprets the Marxist ideology on the basis of intellect, social utility and cogent arguments but very few enjoy the monopolistic right to interpret Islam like the opportunists. Even there, no room for argument or opposition exists.\n\nIn the light of these facts, it has become evident that Islam as interpreted by the self-seekers has nothing to offer nor can it save oppressed men and women from force and violence. Further, the self-seekers and their Islam are a great obstruction in the way of peace and unity, brotherhood and mutual understanding among people.\n\nThe Real philosophy of Islam\n\nIn the above lines, important points have been discussed and there remains no room for confusion that the real philosophy of Islam is entirely different from that of the obscurantists. The real Islamic ideology is far above fake belief and rituals and the distinction of caste, creed and color. Similarly, the real Islam is free from the vices of hatred and prejudice, petty sectarian and communal feelings, class exploitation, violence and force. It does not clash with the law of evolution. Fundamentally and essentially, Islam preaches universal love and peace, equality and fraternity. For other affairs of life, it permits men of learning and intellect to modify their ways according to changing social requirements. The claim of the opportunists that their version of Islam is immutable for every age and place for each aspect of life and segment of society, and that they have every right to interfere in the affairs of an individual or of society is nothing but a conceited notion. Such an attitude is, in fact, against the teachings of Islam.\n\nThe third claim of the opportunists\n\nThe third important claim of the self-styled interpreters of Islam is that the Quran is the final source of information and guidance in this world and the Hereafter. They vehemently plead that:\n\na) It is the Book of God.\n\nb) It contains all worldly and heavenly wisdom.\n\na) The Book of God\n\nThere is a great deal of difference between a Muslim priest and a Muslim mystic. The priest lays great stress on the belief that, the Quran, as a document was first authored by God and then revealed piecemeal through Gabriel to the Prophet. The Messenger of God repeated it and his companions either jotted it down or memorized it. Thus, this idea of the priest is based on the personal concept of God. At the same time, this concept is UN-Islamic and reminiscent of the primitive days.\n\nAs regards the skies, it is said that their number is seven. Like roofs, they are laid on each other. According to the modern scientific researches, there exist no such skies. Further, the belief that God authored the Book at a particular place is to limit Him. Then He sent the Quranic text to the Prophet through a messenger called Gabriel. These are mundane thoughts, which are woven around the concept of God.\n\nTo the mystic, the Holy Quran is that divine blessing which was revealed by the Holy Prophet during sublime moment and in a state of heightened inspiration. According to their concept, God is timeless and spaceless. He is far above the comprehension of human beings. He is Omniscient, Omnipotent and Omnipresent. For communicating His message, he neither needs a document to be first written and then sent through a messenger, nor does He require material means for the delivery of His message.\n\nb) Contains all worldly and heavenly wisdom\n\nAccording to the claim of the Muslim priest, there exist directions in the Quran for the solution of the problems of all ages. It means that it may furnish material even on matters constitutional in accordance with the needs of modern states. It may also provide guidance in economic, social, political, scientific and technical fields. The Quran is the source of all knowledge and contains a solution for all individual and collective problems from day of its revelation till Doomsday. On the basis of this assertion, the priest establishes his monopoly on Islam, claiming that his leadership is essential. But in order to find even an iota of truth in the jargon of the priest, when we study the Quran, we get four types of verses:\n\na) Clear verses revealing the fundamental principles.\n\nb) Symbolic or figurative verses.\n\nc) Verses regarding injunctions of a temporary nature.\n\nd) Verses regarding secondary problems.\n\na) Clear verses revealing the fundamental principles\n\nIn these verses, the following points are elucidated:\n\n1. God has appointed His prophets and messengers at all times and in all religions. These representatives have guided men according to the requirements of a given period in time.\n\n2. There has been a unity and uniformity in the messages of all prophets.\n\n3. As a religion, Islam is all-natural. It is in consonance with the law of evolution.\n\n4. All the worldly objects - body and soul, religious faiths, knowledge and information, keep on developing every day according to the law of evolution.\n\n5. The fundamental objective of religion and that of divine guidance is to promote universal peace and unity, fellow, feeling and brotherhood.\n\n6. Antipathy to the law of evolution breeds hatred and prejudice.\n\nb) Symbolic or figurative verses\n\nThe symbolic verses are of a type in which:\n\n1. The tales about the prophets and about the old tribes are narrated.\n\n2. The description is given of the creation of Adam, the genesis of the world, the making of the canopy and the seat of God. At places, the visage, hands and feet of God are mentioned.\n\n3. A description of Heaven, Hell and Doomsday is given.\n\nThe symbolic or figurative verses are not vividly clear. To insist on their overt meaning, is to undermine the majesty of Islam, especially in the eyes of men of learning. It is because of the fact that such tales are generally legendary and are proved incorrect in the light of reason and intellect.\n\nc) Verses regarding injunctions of temporary nature\n\nThese are the verses, which were revealed about the prevailing conditions then or about emergencies. When the conditions changed, those commands did not remain in force. For example, holy war or Jihad (for preaching purposes), keeping captured men and women as slaves, seizing or looting the belongings of the infidels or killing them must now be regarded to have been rescinded.\n\nd) Verses regarding secondary problems\n\nWhich various terms of punishment are specified, keeping in view the social norms of the Prophets time in these verses? For example, the amputation of the hand of a thief, death penalty for murder, stoning to death for adultery or a hundred lashes as the case may be, are the sentences. The nature of these secondary problems and their demands differ according to prevalent social values. Values also change with time. Neither do the rules and laws retain their old shape nor do old injunctions retain their validity.\n\nThis law of Nature works on all religions, which have come into existence through the revealed books. It is because the revealed books reflected the social urges of their time. The conservative Muslim priest admits that owing to the changes in social norms, each succeeding divine book was an improvement on the one preceding it. Therefore, he considers the injunctions contained in other divine books as canceled. But, on the other hand, he does not acknowledged that in the Quran, too, there are injunctions for only a specific period which do not suit the changed conditions of the present times, although certain injunctions were outdated in the world of Islam itself centuries ago. The Muslim priest does not relent in his persistence only because he fears that such an acknowledgment may perhaps loosen his hold on society. To overcome this fear, he wants to see the Muslims much more backward as compared to the men in the rest of the world and he also wants them divided into innumerable sects. In his interpretation of Islam, there exists nothing, which may satisfy the urges of the modern scientific age. However, he makes a lot of claims regarding the solution of problems of not only earthly life but that in the Hereafter.\n\nBeyond doubt, like other divine books, much can be gained from the Quran regarding certain fundamental things and, at places, it may act as a guiding force for humanity. However, in many other domains of life, we shall have to give due importance to intellect and experiment along with the cultural and social requirements of changing times.\n\nThe Fourth Claim of the Opportunists\n\nThose who present Islam in their own color, also lay much stress that the Holy Prophet was not only the last prophet, but that he should also be considered as the last reformer and guide. Further, they plead that all the teachings and guidance ceased with him. In this context also, the versions of the Muslim priest and the Muslim mystics are different. The priest pleads that:\n\n1. The Prophet presented a new religion. Consequently, all the previous religions were discarded. No other legitimate religion will come into existence in future.\n\n2. Prayers, exercises, beliefs, rites, moral and social codes are the real essence of the teachings of Islam or the teachings of the Prophet. These create distinction between a Muslim and a non-Muslim.\n\n3. The Holy Prophet is the leader and guide only of the Muslims.\n\n4. The Muslims alone can be his favored followers.\n\n5. The Messenger of God was assigned this role to deliver to the world a spiritual message and a permanent system of life.\n\n6. Mohammed was the last Prophet. No prophet shall ever succeed him, nor shall the world need a guide and a reformer after him. His religion shall last till Doomsday\n\nHowever, the faith of the mystic is as follows: -\n\nFundamentally speaking, the Holy Prophet introduced no new religion. Islam blossomed into its real shape under the law of evolution. It has been the religion of all the previous prophets.\n\nThe mission of the Prophet of Islam was not to give birth to new dissension and discords. His mission was to promote the feelings of love and brotherhood, removing thereby every form of prejudice.\n\nTo limit the universal teachings of the Prophet of God to certain overt beliefs, rites and formal codes, is to undermine his lofty mission and ideals.\n\nTo regard the Holy Prophet as the leader of only the Muslims is to contradict a fact. He is the leader, the guide and the messiah of all humanity.\n\nEvery virtuous being in this world is his follower; all those who are not virtuous do not belong to him.\n\nThe life of the Holy Prophet had two aspects. One was revealed and the other was concealed. The overt aspect showed hint as he administrator, the Commander-in-Chief and the performer of all duties as a human being. This objective was fulfilled during His lifetime. It was temporarily and short-lived. The real object of his Prophethood lay in the covert aspect of his life, which included his preaching of love and brotherhood, his moral and spiritual training of men and his striving for the progress and prosperity of humanity. Beyond doubt, this objectives is of permanent value and this was the very purpose of his Prophethood. The mystic has been trying to follow the latter aspect of the Prophets life and has adopted a creed considerably different from that of the opportunists and exhibitionists.\n\nBy the Holy Prophet, the mystic means that the human mind has attained to such a stage of development that, after the last Messenger, God no longer needs to guide man with revelations or super-intellect. After the Holy Prophet, the veil between the Creator and the created has been lifted and the Almighty has conveyed His eternal and final message of love to humanity after him, there remains no need for any other divine message.\n\nTherefore, the Muslim mystic believes that in the light of this faith, all overt religious laws and injunctions have lost their validity with the passage of time. Democratic governments have the power to enforce them. In the conduct of these affairs, the mystic deems the intervention of the priest as illegitimate. He believes that the clergy very often raises the slogan of establishing a religious government because it is a device to serve his selfish motives. Religion, as a matter of fact, is a personal affair of man which is between him and his God. The intervention of others acting as intermediaries is to ridicule the faith and the finality of Prophethood. The mystic regards Islam as a universal message of peace and brotherhood. He does not like to get himself involved in petty religious differences lest the real objective should be lost sight of.\n\nThe Fifth Slogan of the Opportunists\n\nThe fifth slogan of the fundamentalists, who try to interpret Islam in terms of their own liking, has been that the Muslims are the chosen people of God. Therefore, it is their birthright and the foremost duty to lead the entire world. The real purpose of this slogan has been to misguide the simple-minded Muslims to prepare them to make sacrifices, thereby paving the way for the opportunists to grab power and amass wealth. On the other hand, the mystics have regarded the enslavement or exploitation 0£ the weak against the teachings of Islam.\n\nThe mystic knows very well that most of those considered, as \"the chosen creatures of God\" have never adopted such ways, which the Almighty approved. It was because of differences and contradictions that a large number of sects cropped up. Each sect declared the followers of other sects as infidels or renegades torturing and shedding the blood of their opponents mercilessly. Barring others, these men brutally massacred Imam Hussain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet, along with his relatives and friends. The dead bodies of the martyrs were trampled under horses hooves and their heads were spiked on spears for exhibition in towns and villages. Hundreds and thousands of the followers of the Prophet, saints, pious and upright men were first subjected to extreme torture and then they were done to death. In subsequent ages Mansoor, Sarmad, Shams Tabrez, Makhdoom Bilawal, Shah Inayat Sufi and scores of similar great men were killed by no one but by the Muslims.\n\nWhenever a Muslim ruler decided to get rid of an upright man, his paid priests and his men-at-arms always supported him. Muslim history is replete with such events. One who tries to feed the Muslims on such hollows slogans or sheer sentiments, claiming them to be the superior beings or to be world leaders is either ignorant of Muslim history or is deliberately trying to deceive the people for personal gain. Such a person may enjoy popularity or command respect among the men of his own creed, but such popularity is short-lived because, with each passing day, the Muslim masses are becoming more and more conscious. The day is not far off when such exploiters will be fully exposed and will have no place in society.\n\nApart from the creed of the mystics, if the claim of the opportunists is judged in the light of reason and experiences it will fall flat on its face. A glaring example in this respect can be cited - the Punjab riots of 1953. The Government of Pakistan had constituted an inquiry commission consisting of two High Court Judges, Mr. Justice Mohammed Munir and Mr. Justice Rustam Kiyani. In their report, the learned members of Commission stated that the reputed religious scholars, who appeared before them as witnesses, had no unanimity of opinion regarding the Islamic State and the Islamic way of life. Further, each of them held a different opinion of Islam from the other. The scholar of a sect declared that the followers of other sects were misguided infidels. The learned judges expressed their opinion that if the evidence of those scholars was to be relied upon, no one could be called a Muslim.\n\nThis is the plight of the faith of these so-called Muslims, but if you look at their actions, you will come across innumerable men who are not only downright corrupt but were also lairs, hypocrites and tyrants of the worst order. These men keep on sucking the blood 0£ the poor and the indigent. They are also inimical to each other. In such a sad state of affairs, how can the Muslims be called a nation, which is based on the unity of thought and action? Such a nation has neither existed in the past, nor does it exist today nor can it exist in future. This slogan has been invented only to serve the vested interests of the ruling class, which has nothing to do with Islam in practice. In the context of the modern world. This slogan has become even more absurd because there is hardly a single Muslim country, which can be compared with any of the advanced countries of the world. Thus, when all Muslim countries are backward, how can the Muslims be regarded as \"the chosen people of God\" or men born to lead the world? Such a conceited notion is nothing but self-deception and ignorance.\n\nOn the very basis of such a concept of nationhood, the Pakistan Movement was initiated in the sub-continent. In 1943, a pamphlet was distributed on behalf of the Sindh Muslim league, which made the following points. It was claimed that the creation of Pakistan was essential because: -\n\n1. It would be the Kingdom of God on earth.\n\n2. Its citizens would enjoy equal rights and there would be an equitable distribution of wealth.\n\n3. Only the chaste, the upright and the God-fearing men would run the government.\n\n4. All religions and all sects of Islam would enjoy complete freedom.\n\n5 It would be the responsibility of the government to eliminate poverty, oppression, ignorance and economic exploitation.\n\n6. Civil liberties would be guaranteed and free legal aid would be provided by the State to every citizen.\n\n7 Virtue alone, not power and pelf, would be the criterion for human dignity.\n\nNow, judge for yourself. Which of these promises was fulfilled after the creation of Pakistan? At first glance, you will know that the evils which we were assured would be uprooted, exist even to this day. Not only that: many more evils have raised their head. Pakistan has unfortunately become a hunting ground for its rulers and martial law has become the order of the day. The condition of the masses is deteriorating day by day. No good has so far come out. On the other hand, owing to the broad-based movement for the genesis of this country, which was based purely on sentiments, the following were the consequences: 1. As a result of dislocation, millions of Hindus and Muslims become homeless.\n\n2. Hundreds of thousands of men were brutally murdered. Thousands of women were abducted and property worth millions of rupees was destroyed or damaged.\n\n3. The feelings of hatred and enmity have infected the two peoples to the extent that both are at daggers drawn with each other and, instead of ameliorating the conditions of their peoples; they squander money on the purchase of arms. Further, in order to browbeat each other the two nations dance to the tune of the great Powers.\n\n4. As a result of bad blood between the two countries, the feelings of brotherhood, tolerance and mutual respect have vanished altogether.\n\nWhen we try to find out the root-cause of these ill feelings, we learn that nothing but extremism is the main reason for worsening relations between the two countries. On our side, mainly the explanation and slogan of the opportunists who have always exploited Islam for their own ends create bad blood. These mischievous and slanderous slogans have continued to dupe the people. Their attention is distracted from the vital issues of life and they are entangled in such problems, which pay rich dividends only to the rulers and the opportunists. Thus, Islam which has a universal appeal and which conveys a message of love and peace has been debased into an instrument of hatred, coercion and violence.\n\nThe ugly situation which has resulted from this accursed idea in Pakistan, can be summarized thus:\n\n1. On an account of religious discrimination, even in the political affairs of the country, the non-Muslims are feeling extremely insecure about their future. In fact, they appear to be disillusioned.\n\n2. Some Muslim sects, the liberal Muslims and the followers of mysticism have become disenchanted because of an atmosphere charged with religious frenzy.\n\n3. Crude theocracy and its increasing terror have retarded objective and scientific research in the country. At the same time, it has prevented new discoveries and inventions.\n\n4. To serve the vested interests of a particular group, the small provinces are gobbled up in the name of so-called unity. The people of these small provinces are being exploited. Under the pernicious One Unit system, the people of the small provinces were deprived of their civil rights. They were also economically, socially and culturally exploited.\n\n5. The people of East Pakistan, * despite being in majority, were deprived of their just and legitimate rights.\n\n6. Even after decades, there has been no settlement with India on the problem of Kashmir, nor has Afghanistan been approached for a solution of the Pakhtoonistan problem. Consequently, we are forced to spend money on a huge army, which is becoming a ruling army.\n\n7. The rulers have kept on feeding the people on false slogans. These slogans are unnecessarily given the shape of political problems.\n\n8. The people are politically conscious but attempts are made to benumb their consciousness and slogans are being vociferously raised to run the country on religious lines. Besides the laws of inheritance and marriage contract, traditional Islam has no concern with the laws of modern governments nor can Islam, as interpreted by the Muslim priest, guide a technical and scientific society.\n\n9. As a result of the misunderstanding about Islam caused by the interpretation of the Muslim priests, young men are feeling disgusted with religion. These young people have started feeling that Islam is an instrument of force, coercion and exploitation.\n\n*East Pakistan formed a part of Pakistan when this book was written.\n\nAllama I.I. Kazi, opposing the misconceived notion that Islam belongs to a particular group or region, says: [A true Muslim adapts himself to each and every society because of his lofty thoughts and noble virtues. In the past, such men spread the teachings of Islam to every nook and corner of the world of course without weapons and an army). Today) efforts arc being made to restrict the followers (of this natural religion to a particular area. Islam came as a force to spread and not to be restricted. Such an attempt is based on lack of understanding of the real teachings of Islam. It also reflects the cowardice of those who are called Muslims].\n\nA great Muslim scholar and the founder of the Khaksar Tehrik, Allama Enayatullah Khan Mashriqi, have written in more explicit words in his famous book entitled Tazkira.\n\nThe present grouping of people is artificial and unnatural. Every virtuous being, whichever religion he apparently belongs to, is a Muslim. In the same way, each bad man is a non-Muslim.\n\nThe Sixth Slogan of the Opportunists\n\nThose who interpret Islam in the light of their vested interests very often raise the cry: [Islam is the only means of salvation for mankind. Therefore, it is necessary to wage war for its expansion.\n\nIf this slogan is analyzed, it will appear to be as shallow and misleading as other slogans raised by the opportunists. This slogan is raised only to dupe and mislead the simple-minded Muslims so that the self-seekers may fatten at the cost of the masses.\n\nI have stated in the preceding pages that after the Holy Prophet, there has never been a unified concept of Islam nor will it ever exist. Therefore, the question arises as to what type of Islam will rid the world of its troubles so that it must be forced upon all nations. Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi, an eminent scholar, commenting on these slogans of the Muslim priests, said:\n\nSome of the Muslims in India have such a misconceived notion with regard to their nationality, which has no basis in reality. We have been thinking about an Islamic party for a long time. However, there is neither any plan about it in our minds nor does any such party exist anywhere in the world. We have confined ourselves to such a world of imagination that we have not only become all ignorant of the h"
