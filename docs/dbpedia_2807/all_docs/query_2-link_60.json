        "text": "Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said the Sindh government of the PPP has done exemplary work in the education, health, and civic infrastructure sectors and these achievements should be properly projected through conventional and social media.\n\nHe stated this while meeting the mayor of the Sukkur city, Barrister Arsalan Islam Shaikh, who also acts as the Sindh government’s spokesman, at the Bilawal House in Karachi on Tuesday.\n\nBilawal mentioned in the meeting that the Sindh government had planted a record number of mangrove trees on the coastal belt of the province and this afforestation effort had been recognised at the global level.\n\nHe said the people in other provinces in the country should know the achievements of the PPP’s rule in Sindh. He said the Sindh government had a complete focus on the development agenda.\n\nHe said that there was a need to properly present to the masses the achievements of the PPP’s rule in the province. The PPP chairman directed the Sukkur mayor to put the city’s administration on high alert keeping in view the forecast of a new spell of monsoon rains starting on August 11. He said that all the available resources should be used to protect the citizens from the adverse effects of heavy rains.\n\nBilawal asked the mayor to adopt precautionary measures to provide instant relief to the citizens in case of any emergency situation. The mayor briefed the PPP chairman on the ongoing development works and preparations for the quick disposal of accumulated rainwater in monsoon rains in the city. He said Sukkur’s drainage system functioned properly even after hours-long torrential rains recently.\n\nHe said the drainage problem in the old parts of the Sukkur city, persisting for the past 70 years, had been resolved. Barrister Shaikh told PPP chairman that all waste stations had been upgraded. He said Sukkur had become a centre of academic activities after setting up seats of higher learning of international standard.\n\nHe said the urban forests, green belts, and plantation activities were being carried out to ensure the beautification of the Sukkur city. Meanwhile, the PPP chairman held a meeting with the newly appointed spokespersons for the Sindh government. The meeting was attended by Senior Minister for Information Sharjeel Inam Memon and MPA Jameel Soomro.\n\nThe meeting was attended by Barrister Murtaza Wahab, Sadia Jabed, Wahid Halepoto, Ali Rashid, Arsalan Islam Sheikh, Ghanwer Ali Khan Isran, and Makhdoom Fakhr-uz-Zaman. Bilawal asked the spokespersons to effectively project and publicise the achievements of the provincial government to make people aware of these development initiatives.\n\nSeparately, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah held a meeting with the PPP chairman at the Bilawal House to brief him about the steps taken by his government to prevent urban flood flooding in cities of the province during the current monsoon season."
