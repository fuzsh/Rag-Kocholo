        "text": "Muhammad Arshad\n\nMuhammad Arshad\n\n--\n\nPublished Jun 23, 2021\n\nBut who can tell Iqbal’s story better than his family? So the gist of Mr. Iqbal’s poetry is of trying to inculcate the identity of our religion, traditions, and culture into the Muslims, Tried to make people realize their standing in front of their ancestors, who were Muslims and great people. To revive that greatness again in yourself. Mr. Allama Iqbal tried to revive those emotions and that identity in them. So Allama Iqbal read this doughty for Quaid-e-Azam, “Gone are the days when I was alone in the reinstitute, I have more like-minded people now’, Now that this person is here, he understands what I say and whatever has to happen will be through his hands, While communicating with Mr. Allama, Quaid-e-Azam went to the Jived Manila the last residence of Alamo Iqbal. My father was asked him who is this?, He said, He is a well-reputed leader of the Muslims and he has to accomplish a lot for the Muslims, so take special care of him and respect him. My father asked him if I can take his autograph, Allama Iqbal said, sure! You must take his autograph. Anyway Quaid-e-Azam came, Motiram Fatima Jinnah came with him to the Jived residence, to our poor abode, So my father brought his autograph book, and presented himself in front of Quaid-e-Azam, So he looked at Javid and asked him “what are you going to do young man when you grow up?”, He was a little kid so he remained quiet and did not know what to say, Quaid-e-Azam asked him one more time “you don’t tell me what you want to be when you grow up? Why don’t you tell me what you want to be when you grow up?” My father again did not know what to say.\n\nSo Quaid-e-Azam looked at Allama Iqbal and with the same angry look he asked he does not answer, he does not tell me what he wants to become when he grows up. He does not answer, he does not tell me what he wants to be when he grows up, Mr. Allama gave him the answer in the same tone he will not answer, and he is waiting for you to tell him what he has to do. He will definitely not give you an answer, he is waiting for your order him what he has to become when he grows up, This was the level of respect Respected Allama Iqbal had for Quaid-e-Azam, The sarcasm of newspapers in affiliation with the Congress, gave the word Pakistan a prominence, Subcontinent’s poorest budget was presented by which Muslim ruler, How Muslim league changed the course of action of congress. How the last try of keeping the Subcontinent united failed? The preparations for Lahore Resolution are at their highest, when the minister of Punjab Khizer Hayat Tiwana, bans all political activities in Lahore. Why did Khizer Hayat do so? How did Liaquat Ali khan, as the minister of the treasury, give congress a tough time, and how Gandhi’s dream of ‘independent and peaceful Hindustan’ got shattered? You will find all this out in today’s episode of ‘Story of Pakistan’, Jinnah reached Lahore to address history’s most important gathering, but instead of going to the place of gathering went to the hospital.\n\nJinnah had come into alliance with the key players; the Unionist Party, and the Krishak Praja party of the two big provinces; Punjab and Bengal. And having that alliance Muslim league was hopeful for their support. So at a time like that when they were confident that the community is definitely with them, That the Muslim league’s popularity has penetrated into the masses, then Jinnah decided that they will now have to announce their targets openly. Before this was about to happen, an incident happened in Lahore, in which the government attacked the Khaksars, a lot of them lost their lives and many were injured. Sikander Hayat tried to stop it, Sikander Hayat asked Jinnah to postpone the session, Jinnah said nothing doing, now we definitely have to do this session. So when he came to Lahore, he directly went to the Mayo hospital and visited the sick of the Khaksars, and then went for any other activity.\n\nPeople, from all over the place, in huge amounts, were coming into the congregations and gatherings. It was the environment at the time. Why are they going? Quaid-e-Azam has to give an address so we have to go and listen to his speech. There was no mention of estate or Muslims, nothing, only that we have to go to listen to Quaid-e-Azam’s address. The session of Muslim League in Lahore was a three-day session. It started on the 22nd. And if we look at the 22nd, Jinnah gave a speech on that day. The major event. And that speech is defining where this is headed. It clear cut states that even in spite of living together for one thousand we have nothing in common. We neither intermarry nor inter dine. The tone they are setting, that the strategy of united nationalism is a strategy, we are not interested in taking it forward.\n\nWhen Quaid-e-Azam started delivering his address, pin-drop silence fell on the crowd, analysts and journalists wrote in their newspapers that at that time, even if a needle was to drop you could have heard its sound, After that, on the next day resolution that was presented, it was clear cut mentioned that Muslim majority areas would become separate independent states. And if you look at the Muslim league’s parliamentarian’s convention of 1940, it was clear cut stated that these are not states, rather a single state would be demanded. At the same address, Quaid-e-Azam is seen saying that now we are pooled on the same platform, now we are united. Now no one can say anything to us. Why can’t they anything to us? Because now we have determined our course of action. The next day the Hindu press sarcastically called this ‘Pakistan resolution’, and the irony of history is that the same thing gradually came in front of them as a movement. Till 1944 congress had understood that if not today, tomorrow Pakistan will come into being. That’s why they launched Mr. Gandhi to convince Jinnah to take back his demands. The most interesting part of Jinnah Gandhi's talks was that Gandhi himself did not own his words. Rajagopalachari had left congress, He presented a formula so that somehow Indians can become united again. And he wanted to sit with Jinnah and Gandhi and on the basis of that formula, Jinnah and Gandhi decided that they will negotiate and maybe a final attempt can be made to retain a united India.\n\nThe biggest problem in this was, which Jinnah kept on raising was that even if we were to reach a consensus, what guarantee can you give us that congress would endorse them? So Mr. Gandhi would say that I am not even a member of congress. Therefore Gandhi was negotiating on his personal terms, whereas Quaid-e-Azam was negotiating, as the president of all India Muslim League. What’s amazing is Gandhi put as much pressure as could and used all his tricks and tactics, finally, he realized that Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah will not agree with him. He could not convince him. Therefore on this basis, all these negotiations failed, that what is the credibility of it, who has its ownership? After 50 years of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan’s death, the seed he had sown then has now become into a tree. Students of Aligarh University had now become the front row warriors of the Independence movement. At that time elections of 1946 came. This was a do-or-die match for the Muslim league. And then history saw itself turnover. Muslim league, which in 1937 elections had been wiped out from the face of the earth, the same Muslim league rose as the only representative party of the Muslims. But more tests of the faithful await. Quaid-e-Azam had seen that passion in his nation, which any nation needs in order to achieve its purpose.\n\nWhen they were doing all of this, during the visits, conversing with people, and doing correspondence, we see during this time elections were announced. At that time, it became vital for the Muslim league to prove, that they are the one and only representative political party of the Muslims. Therefore Muslim league did a very vigorous campaign and campaigned everywhere. People wrote letters to Jinnah, that Jinnah we are with you. Little kids wrote letters. It’s very amusing to read those letters. The kids at that time, the ones we call teenagers. Even they had a dream of our Pakistan. Because the Muslim league had created an organizational structure by this time, therefore, by using that organizational structure, they did a very forceful campaign. Since Pakistan Resolution to the 1946 elections, all the rest did not understand what was happening. There was only a Muslim league. Everywhere, in Bihar, in Bengal, in Assam, everywhere, in UP, the Muslim league got the seats, that was reserved for the Muslims. In central seats, thirty seats were reserved for the Muslims, all those 30 seats, all 30 of them Muslim league succeeded in winning all of them and in provinces Muslim league, succeeded in winning more than 90% of the seats. And Muslim league also decided that they were ready to become a part of the interim government. Liaquat Ali Khan presented the poor man’s budget. It was a poor man’s budget.\n\nAll sponsors of the congress were rich people, on whom taxes were levied. And now they urged congress that it’s your government. So now the finance ministry that was given to the Muslim League played an important part, in accomplishing the concept of Pakistan. The climax part of ‘story of Pakistan’ is very near. Everyone knows what happened on the 14th of august but this year, in itself is a narrative, there is greatness, there is obscurity, there is dwelling too, and a beginning too. What line did Radcliff draw, which leads to an enormous dispute between the two countries? What happened in the last years which were full of tears, blood, and corpses? Who committed fraud against the widow of Raja Ranjit Singh, against whom was Jinnah so convinced, that he said “It will fall to my lap like an apple”. Let’s hear Kashmir’s story. Can a person live if his jugular vein gets cut? If you or I did not have a jugular vein, would we have had an existence? This is the type of relationship Kashmir has with Pakistan. And Pakistan’s story can never be complete without Kashmir. If we look at the history of Kashmir, here all those ruled whom the nation disliked. We will get to know the short story of Kashmir, in this special episode of ‘Story of Pakistan’, with a link to the history of Kashmir, there are a lot of mythological stories present. The valley of Kashmir was a lake at a time, which gradually grew as a valley. Where now and then Hindu and Buddhists ruled. Here Islam spread thanks to the Sufis. The recent history of Kashmir is full of Hindu Raj. But if they became the rulers of Kashmir, how did they become so? This is a tale full of treachery and fraud. Gulab Singh used to be a Mangla of the fort, from there he got acquainted with Ranjit Singh. Gradually he got into the fort of Ranjit Singh. Ranjit Singh was really happy with him so he gave the residency of Jammu, that area to him to govern. So he gradually expanded himself. His purpose was to ultimately make his own government there, make it his own country. In the meantime, Ranjit Singh passed away. He manipulated his widow Janta Rani and made his army combat against the English. The widow of Ranjit Singh and his young son, who was enthroned at that time, who was only seven or eight years old, so when they lost, they said that they want indemnity.\n\nNow you should pay the cost of war. So they did not have that much money and assets. So instead what they did was, from river Sutlej to river Indus, all this area was given to the English. In the same document, it was written that the area that was transferred to the English, from that the area between the river Ravi and Chenab will be transferred to Gulab Singh. Gulab Singh's government was in the area of Jammu. In 1846, when its name was transferred to Kashmir, he became the owner of an area that was 84 billion kilometers, During the Pakistan movement, Quaid-e-Azam visited Kashmir twice. In Kashmir on a national level, only two leaders were representing it. And both these leaders were in high conflict with each other. When Sheikh Abdullah returned from Aligarh after completing his studies, and when he came into the practical life, he took notice of these things, so this is how two great leaders of Kashmir were born. One was born in Jammu and one was born in Kashmir, They coordinated to make Muslim conference in 1932 and worked under its flag. Then in 1939, they converted it into the national conference. Then in 1941, their paths separated, Sheikh Abdullah went another way and Ghulam Abbas went another way. Because Sheikh Abdullah was a person of a secular mindset, and Ghulam Abass wanted it to be of only Muslims. When Quaid-e-Azam visited by that time, Muslim conference had been established. Here Muslim leaders of Srinagar extended him an invite and he addressed different gatherings.\n\nAt that time he warned the Kashmiri leaders to not come into the trap of Nehru. And Nehru would deceive them because he was a Kashmiri so do not come into his trap. Because this might harm you. So he tried to advise them and talk to them, but unfortunately Mr. Sheikh was unable to understand him. This gap kept on increasing, next time in 1944 when Quaid-e-Azam visited, at that time he played his role as well. Pundit Nehru very capably used sheik Abdullah, who he had cultivated from way before, with the same mindset of how to use Sheikh Abdullah. So first sheik Abdullah was used to pressurizing the Maharaja. Hindu mutt was already pressurizing him. That you are a Hindu, so you shouldn’t side with Pakistan. Sheikh Abdullah gave a political cover, even though in Jammu and Kashmir there existed a legislative assembly. Of which fresh elections were held in January 1947. And in that Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas who was the leader of the Muslims in Jammu, and who was also the head of all Jammu and Kashmir Muslim conference, as well had the majority with him in the legislative assembly, And this position of the majority was continuously demanding of the Muslim conference, that the state of Jammu and Kashmir should join Pakistan. When the time of partition of India came, under the leadership of Radcliff, a commission was made ‘the boundary commission’. This commission did such a historical fraud, because of which all the following generations till today are suffering.....\n\nContinue.....\n\nBy\n\nM. Arshad"
