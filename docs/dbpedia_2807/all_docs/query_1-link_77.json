        "text": "Shaikh Moulana Muhammad Ibrahim Soharwardi – 1 (1168 -1260 AD)\n\nShrine at : Mastoi, North Waziristan, K P Province, Pakistan\n\nHe is in descendents of Hazrat Abu Ayub Ansari and Peer-e-Hirat Abdullah Ansari. He was born in Madina Munawwarah and completed his education / acquired the Certificate from Darul Uloom of the famous city of Baghdad, in Iraq. There he met the ‘Shaikh ul Shiyookh Shahabuddin Soharwardi’. He became his mureed (disciple) and continued completing the spiritual stages under the guidence of his mentor for many years.\n\nAfter the death of his murshid (spiritual teacher), he visited Multan to meet his Pir Bhai (follower of same spiritual guide) and friend Makhdoom Bahauddin Zakariya Multani. After staying for some time in Multan, when he intended to leave for Baghdad, Makhdoom Bahauddin Zakariya suggested him to go to Mastoi (presently North Waziristan), as his disciples in Burki tribe had great need of guidance and reformation. Therefore he left for Mastoi, the city of the old Burki Tribe, who greeted him with great respect. The Sardar {Head} of Daud Khel Tribe {A branch of Burki Tribe} named Multani Khan married his daughter to Shaikh Maulana Ibrahim. After marriage he decided to settle down there permanently. He was blessed with four sons and the eldest one named Shaikh Sirajuddin was made disciple {Khilafat} of Bahauddin Zakriya Multani. The descendents of Shaikh Ibrahim brought very good name for their ancestors in the coming two and half centuries in this region {Kohistan e Afaaghna}. He died in the year 1260 AD and Shaikh Sirajuddin assumed the Khilafat {succession} after his death.\n\nDuring the following years, there at Mastoi, Burkis had a great fight with Mastong tribe. Moreover, an earth quake also destroyed the city of Mastoi. Therefore, Burki tribe along with Ansaar tribe were compelled to migrate to Kaniguram (presently South Waziristan & part of KP Province, Pakistan). It was arround 1500 AD, the period of “Ba-Yazeed-1 Darya aliace Baba Shahbaz Parind, a descendent of Shaikh Moulana Ibrahim. Here at Kaniguram, the Ansaar family acquired great fame and respect over the years in the upper circles/ rulers at Persia and India.\n\nShaikh Maulana Muhammad Ibrahim and his descendents played a great role in spreading the Silsila-e- Soharwardiya in Kohistan e Afghanistan and India. He was a great scholar having great vision. He was the author of a book named “Tareekh-e-Moallam”. It describes the family profile and explains teachings of Silsila-e-Tareeqat-e- Soharwardia.\n\nHis sons are well known in India, as the members of remote ancestors of Ansaars. The three settlements that had been inhabited and created by his descendents, who migrated and settled in the suburbs of Jalandhar.\n\nThe first settlement by his descendents was ‘Basti Karrar Khan’ (Mohallah Al Burk), established in the mid of 16th century by Shaikh Ahmad Ghous, the grand son of Shahbaz Parind.\n\nThe second settlement was given the name of “Ibrahim Pura”, which was later called “Basti Danishmand” {1612 AD} created by the sons of Shah Ibrahim Danishmand-2 {s/o Ba-Yazeed-1 Shahbaz Parind}, who was settled in Bangal. Ansaar Danishmands were living in majority in this Basti. There was a historic “Deewan Khana” (A big drawing room or hall for meeting large number of people). Nearly every famous and known literary and historical personality of that time had visited it. There, one can find enormous evidence of the knowledge and wisdom of Allama Iqbal and Maulana Ghulam Qadir Girami.\n\nThe third settlement “Basti Shaikh Darwesh” was later created {in 1617 AD} by another descendent Shaikh Muhammad Darwesh, a prominent personality of Ansaar Danishmant tribe.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nMisconception or wrong information :\n\nIn many books of India / Pakistan, they have mixed up the two persons of the Tribe. One is “Shaikh Moulana Ibrahim Soharwardi” (1168-1260 AD) of Mastoi, Waziristan and the other one is his direct descendent “Shah Muhammad Ibrahim Danishmand” (1455-1524 AD – Birth place Kaniguram, Waziristan) of Bangal. There is a gap of 200 years approx in their period. So for proper understanding of the readers, we have mentioned against their names as First and Second.\n\nShah Muhammad Ibrahim Danishmand -2 :\n\nShrine at Mograpara, Sonar Gaon, Near Dhaka, Bangla Desh (1455-1524 AD)\n\nShah Ibrahim Danishmand a sufi saint, an inhabitant of Persia, came to Bangal during the reign of Sultan Shams-ud-Din Muzaffar Shah (reigned 1490-94).\n\nHe was the son of Ba-Yazeed-I Dariya aliace Baba Shahbaz Parind, who was from direct linage of Moulana Muhammad Ibrahim Soharwardi of Mastoi (North Waziristan), the descendent of Abdullah Ansari {Peer e Hirat} and Hz Abu Ayub Ansari, the Sahabi e Rasool.\n\nShahbaz Parind’s brother Zaid Aqa was married to the daughter of Sultan Abu Saeed Mirza of Hirat. On sudden death of Zaid Aqa (Buried in Sumarqand), the widow was got married to the younger brother i.e Ba-Yazeed-I Dariya Shahbaz Parind. He after marriage brought her to his native land at Mastoi (North Waziristan) and later to Kaniguram (South Waziristan).\n\nWith this marriage a son was born and was named Ibrahim. After growing up he went to Baghdad for studies and thereafter to Persia (his mother’s native land) for “Tableegh”. Later he left for Bengal and got married to Roshan Akhter Bano, the daughter of Sultan Alauddin Hussain Shah (Reigned 1494-1519). He was appointed the ruler of Taraf (Sylhet) in coming years.\n\nIbrahim Danishmand was awarded with the high Royal title of Malik-ul-Umara (Chief of Ameers). He was also granted a la-Kharaj (Rent Free) Landed property in Sonargaon by the Sultan. From circumstantial evidences it seems that Danishmand ruled over Taraf even after the death of Sultan in 1519 AD.\n\nThere after he came to Sonargaon and established his Khanqah at the present site of Dargabari in Mograpara.\n\nA highly learned man in all branches of Islamic subjects, especially in Tasawwaf (Islamic Mysticism) and a profilic writer. He was also invested with the honorific title of Qutb-ul-Asheqeen. Danismand belonged to the group of the Soharwardiya already from the ancestors and later the earliest Sufis of Qadriya Tarika, who preached the sufi order in Bengal. He initiated a great tradition for the preaching of sufi order and teaching of Islamic subjects through his Khanqah at Dargabari, which was\n\ncontinued by his descendents and intellectual successors.\n\nDanishmand lies buried in a mausoleum at Dargabari premises in Sonargaon on the western extremity of the tomb complex. His approx death date is hijri 930 i.e 1524 AD; in the reign of Sultan Nasiruddin Nusrat Shah (1519-1533 AD)\n\nImportant note:\n\n1. The books in India /Pakistan have written his name as “Shaikh Muhammad Ibrahim”, but in Bangal they have written as “Shah Ibrahim Danishmand”. So for the clarity of the readers, Shaikh Moulana Ibrahim Soharwardi -1 is buried in Mastoi, Waziristan (died 1260 AD – Peer Bhai of Bahauddin Zakriya Multani) and Shah Ibrahim Danishmand -2 is buried in Mograpara, Sonar Gaon, Dhaka (died 1524 AD). Actually most of Indo Pak writers have mixed him up with his ancestor Shaikh Moulana Ibrahim Soharwardi. The period of both Ibrahims has a gap of approx 200 years & the senior Ibrahim was never awarded the title of Danishmand. (Pl see Phylogeny Map page in this website for proper understanding).\n\n2. Since his period in Bangal is the same as of Hussain Shahi Dynasty and moreover he came to Bangal from Persia with the recommendation of the rulers and was also married in the family of rulers of Hussain Shahi Dynasty, (his mother was also from Persia) so he is remembered in history as Shah Ibrahim Danishmand or Sayyid Ibrahim Danishmand (as written on his grave stone too).\n\n3. Banglapedia has also written his name as Sayyid due to the same misunderstanding. Otherwise all evidences prove that he is from the Tribe of Ansaar Danishmand, Jalandhar and his father was Ba-Yazeed-1 Baba Shahbaz Parind of Kaniguram, South Waziristan and Peer e Hirat Khwaja Abdullah Ansari was in their ancestors.\n\n4. As informed by the above writer that he was having Qadriya tarika is correct, as Danishmand got this title while in Bangal. Otherwise from his ancestors Soharwardiya tarika was in practice since the inception of it, as Moulana Ibrahim Soharwardi was direct mureed of Shaikh Shahabuddin Soharwardi and this family continued in this tarika uptill the end of 18th century. Then after an interesting incident this whole family was switched over to Qadri Noshahi silsila. (This incident has been shared on Mian Abdul Ghafoor’s page of mystic Shajra in this website)\n\nReference books as under ;\n\n Tazkira-e-Auliya-e- Bangala\n\n Tawareekh-e-Dhaka\n\n Tazkira-e-Sufiaaye Bangal\n\n Tareekh-e-Farishta\n\n Tazkeer-ul-Ansaar by Ali Muhammad Ansari (1710 AD, in Persian Language}\n\n Jalandhar kay Pathan by Khan Hassaan Zia\n\n Tareekh-e-Danishmand by Prof Hameed ullah Khan\n\n Afaaghna-e-Jalandhar by Muhammad Ayub Khan\n\nFollowing is the sketch of the shrine of Shah Ibrahim Danishmand -2 from Bangal.\n\n.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nNOTE : For the ready references to the readers, the profiles of 5 top personalities have been displayed below, untill their seperate pages with proper hyper links are not ready.\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nShaikh Ba-yazeed-I Dariya Aliace Baba Shahbaz Parind\n\nBuried at Kaniguram, North Waziristan, Pakistan (1430-1508 AD)\n\nAmongst the descendents of Hz Abu Ayub Ansari, Moulana Ibrahim Soharwardi – I (of Mastoi, NorthWaziristan, Pak-Afghan border- d.1260) who is also a peer bhai of Hz Shaikh Bahauddin ZakariyaMultani and is linked after 8 steps to Shaikh Ba-Yazeed-1.\n\nZaid Aqa was his elder brother, who got married to the daughter of Sultan Abu Saeed Mirza (1424-1469 AD) the ruler of Hirat, and Grand Father of Mughal King Babar. Zaid Aqa died early, buried in Sumarqand and left widow. He had a daughter who was married to Shaikh Mahmood {They are parents of Shaikh Abdullah Abdaal Dunk}. His widow got remarried to Shaikh Ba-yazeed Shahbaz Parind.\n\nShahbaz Parind had two wives: First wife having two sons (1st son Abdul Rahim, who is father of Shaikh Ahmad Ghous d.1590, AND 2nd son Muhammad Shaikh, whose grandson is Ba-yazeed-2 aliace Peer Roshaan d.1580}.\n\nFrom Second wife (Widow of Zaid Aqa and daughter of Sultan Abu Saeed Mirza) she gave birth to a son and a daughter; Son named Shaikh Ibrahim (known as Shah Ibrahim Danishmand-2, d.1524 in Bangal). His further descendents are Shaikh Peer wali of Kaniguram, Shaikh Mian Darwesh and Mian Abdul Ghafoor of Jalandhar.\n\nMove from Mastoi to Kaniguram :\n\nThe descendents of Moulana Shaikh Ibrahim-I stayed / lived in Mastoi for long period since 1240’s. During the Khilafat Period of Shaikh Shahbaz Parind (Bayazeed-I Dariya), the two groups of Burki Tribe had a serious fight and many young men were killed by each other (Book Tazkeer ul Ansaar says it was around 1500 AD). In the same period a series of heavy earth quake in 1505 AD took place in the area. So, the followers of Burki Tribe from Kaniguram requested him to come at their lands\n\nalong with families. People had a great respect for them as being their Peers {Spiritual leaders}. They offered lands/properties as a full support, enabling them to establish financially and requested for shifting from Mastoi/Sangtoi to their place. Shahbaz Parind accepted their sincere offer and settled down to Kaniguram along with all family members. Other Burkies also started shifting to Kaniguram after their arrival.\n\nDue to their great efforts thousands of people were entered into their discipline.\n\nSo after serving with great deal, at last he died and was buried in Kaniguram in 1508 AD appx.\n\nFew years after the death of Shaikh Ba-Yazeed Shahbaz Parind, a caravan from Kaniguram to Jalandhar arrived in around 1515 AD, it was period of Sikandar Lodhi. Shaikh Ahmad Ghous was leading the group and purpose was the settlement and to find out business avenues. An important objective was to introduce Islamic teachings {Shareeah} in the region by the spiritual persons.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nSHAIKH BA-YAZEED – 2 ALIAS PEER ROSHAAN ANSARI\n\nBuried at Teerah, Waziristan (1525-1580 AD)\n\nMuhammad Abdullah Ansari (Peer-e-Hirat) is regarded as the most famous amongst the descendents of Hazrat Abu Ayub Ansari. And after him if we see, in the history of their family linage, comes Shaikh Ba-Yazeed-2 (Peer Roshaan), who belongs to the 11 th generation of Moulana Muhammad Ibrahim Soharwardi. He was not only regarded as the inventor of the alphabets of Pushto Language and the very first prose writer of PashtoLanguage, but also possessed the honour of being the first ever author of Urdu language in the Sub-continent. When he was just 6 years old his family was compelled to migrate from Jalandhar to Kaniguram (Waziristan) because of the brutality and unjust behavior of the recent Mughal emperor. In Waziristan, the critical condition of the family atmosphere (unbearable attitude of the step mother and harsh behavior of father) made him habitual of going into meditation and deep thoughts at his early age. However he had a philosophical and thoughtful mental approach by birth and it came up in the shape of a new approach of ijtehaad.\n\nDealing with people, spirituality and mysticism (Sufism):\n\nShaikh Ba-yazeed wished to perform such a type of worship that could give satisfaction of the heart and soul. The enemity among the so-called religious scholars, the hypocrisy of Qazi and Mulla, and sectarian quarrel among the Muslims had made him worried and sad. In search of his desired aim Shaikh Ba-yazeed became pupil and disciple of many senior and learned religious scholars but could not find a single moment of his desired peace and happiness. Such a situation compelled him to make his own heart a Mufti and thus he started taking interest in reading Quran and pondering upon its message and meanings with deep thoughts and wisdom. After a long period of involving in meditation and deep thoughtfulness the secrets of the universe and the meanings of the life of human beings and the way of righteous path of life\n\nstarted revealing in his inner eye and heart. Then he started preaching the teaching of Islam. During his early age, Shaikh Ba-yazeed used to perform Tahajjud, recite and read “Auraad and Wazaaef” which was regular practice of the Soharwardi family and their disciples. Like other saints and pious persons (Ahl-ullah), he was also fond of Qawwali (a kind of Muslim devotional music associated with Sufis) that creates over whelming emotions in the listeners. He inherited and possessed great love and affection for Islam and sympathy for the Muslims.\n\nContrary to the traditional values in vogue he adopted the way of Tareeqat and Sulook. Because of this the Mufties and religious scholars turned against him and fiercely opposed his thoughts and teachings. Shaikh Ba-yazeed blew a new soul in the dead body of ‘Tasawwuf’ and preached the peers and disciples to get rid of the Monk’s life and assume an active life of Mujaahid-e-Islam. His life was a reformer’s life. He acquired excellence in eight stages of “Asraar and Mafaaheem” (The divine mysteries, and connotation) of spiritualism. After that, he established a Khaanqah in Mastoorah, a village in Tiraalah and started preaching Soharwardi way of Tareeqat. Obviously, the faiths and ideology of Peer Roshaan was that of the Ahl-e- Sunnat Wal Jama’at.\n\nIt is a fact that his preaching raised the sentiments and emotions of the people and still its influence is evident in that area. He preached to stop rivalry among the people specially the Muslim brotherhood and to keep away from the anti- Shariah acts and activities. He possessed a great ability to interpret the meanings and explanation of the Ayaat of the Holy Quran. (He was a great interpreter of Holy Quran). Taking care and bringing up the orphans, providing provisions to widows for their living, serving and helping the helpless and weak people, feeding the poor and needy people, and rendering help to all without any discrimination, were included in his daily routine. Moreover, he used to give education and knowledge of Quran and Hadees, Zikr and meditation to his disciples and followers of Silsila-e-Soharwardia in Halqa. Because of his noble services and preaching a large number of people from other regions including Kaniguram and people of Burki Tribe living in Teerah velley entered the fold of his disciples. (From Hindustan, Mullah mawdood, author of ‘Maqsood-ul-Talebeen’, and well known poet Mulla Deewan Shah, author of ‘Mirat-ul Muhaqqeqeen’ and writer of poetry Book (Deewan) also adopted his discipleship. People started to call him as ‘Peer Roshaan’. The Pakhtoons called him ‘Peer Rokhan’. People speaking old Punjabi and Hindko languages, called him ‘Wajeed’.\n\nTAUHEED (Belief in Unicity of Allah).\n\nShaikh Ba-yazeed Peer Roshan clearly says that :\n\n“It is mandatory for every Muslim to acquire knowledge of ‘Tauheed’, the oneness of Almighty Allah. After death the first question will be asked about ‘Tauheed’ and only Muslims would be able to answer if they keep worshiping one and the only Allah with true belief in Tauheed. Those Muslims who are ignorant of the facts and reality of Tauheed, will not be able to answer properly. Wise people are those, who acquire and possess the knowledge of religion and only those Muslims who sincerely follow the preaching and teaching of Islam will reach their desired heaven. People must understand the importance of acquiring knowledge of religion”.\n\nLiterary services:\n\nThe famous German scholar Anne Marie Schimmel writes in her book “Mystical dimension of Islam” that the people living in the neighbourhood of the Sub-continent also included the Soofyana literature in their languages. Prior to the Sindhi and Punjabi mystic poetry, during the rule of Humayun and Akbar, another mystic movement had risen. It was Rokhanian’s movement . The name of the leader of Rokhanian movement was Ba-yazeed Ansari or Peer Rokhan (died in 1585 AD). He was the first soofi who translated and included the Persian Tasawwof in his mother tongue, Pushto. His book, “Sehrul Bayaan” (magic of speech), is written in a very sophisticated Pushto prose. It is the very first clear and complete attempt to write mystic literature in Pushto language. But these mystic thoughts, fell victim to the opposition of Akhund Darwiza. As a\n\nresult, the person who was struggling in search of truth, knowledge, literature and humanity, had been pushed into a war that turned him into a great philosopher, politician and brave military general. Peer Roshan was the first Pushtoon literary person and an intellectual, who not only faced the opposition of his friends but all other forces simultaneously. The famous Pushtoon poet, ‘Khush haal khan Khatak’ followed the preaching of ‘Peer Roshan’, who denied and kept fighting with his pen against all the unjust and unreasonable political, philosophical and literary behaviors. The spiritual movement of Ba-yazeed Ansari laid a long lasting revolutionary effect by giving basis for their philosophical, literary and political thoughts.\n\nPeer Roshan as an Author:\n\nPeer Roshan was not only a greatly acclaimed religious scholar and a Sufi of Tareeqat but also assumed his creditability as an author, poet and linguist.\n\nHis books and literary work:\n\nOne of his greatly acclaimed book is “Khairul Bayaan”. It was discovered from Germany in the year 1960. (It is written in Arabic, Persian, Pushto and Hindi). This book is about Shariah, Tareeqat and religious matters and problems.\n\nThe names of his other eight famous books are:\n\n(i) Sirat-ul-Tauheed\n\n(ii) Farhatul Mujtaba\n\n(iii) Maqsood-ul-Momineen\n\n(iv) Fakhr-ul-taalebeen\n\n(v) Haal naamah\n\n(vi) Risala-e-ilm\n\n(vii) Maktoobaat\n\n(viii) Pushto Rasm-ul-Khat . Moreover, Asiatic Society of Bengal published the translation of his book “Tazkira-tul-Roshnia” in 1878 AD.\n\nPushto literary work:\n\nPeer Roshaan invented and prepared Pushto Alphabets and style of writing scrip. Famous researcher Raza Hamdani writes in ‘Adabiyaat-e-Sarhad’: “Peer Rukhan” had a great personality. He was expert in literature, philosophy, preaching and nationalism. Although he was an old hand in every walk of life but his literary life was exceptionally important. In fact, Peer Rukhan brought progressive revolution in Pushto literature. He served Pushto literature through his prose and laid foundation\n\nof a new school of thought”.\n\nHe established a greater literary and linguistic school of thought whose followers were expert in and well conversant of Arabic, Persian and Hindi. Those people absorbed the terminology of “Irfan” (awareness of truth) and “Aalam-e-La hoot” (the divine sphere) in Pushto language. He also wrote poetry on complicated matters of ‘Tasawwuf’ (Sufism). He used the said terms in his poetry i.e. Ghazals, Qasayed (eulogies), and couplets. He was the first to show skills of using privileges of ilm-e-Badie (a branch of knowledge dealing with qualities of literary writing) and Bayaan (science of using figures of speech) in Pushto language. The followers of Shaikh Ba-yazeed wanted the people of Pakhtunkhwah, Afghanistan, Iran, Hindustan, and beyond Hindustan to be needled in one string of brotherhood. To achieve this, the school of Rukhan took balanced and compatible steps.\n\nThe acceding influence of Shaikh Ba-yazeed was censed by the Mughal rulers as threat to their throne, which led to bloodshed and war that continued for about over half century. The Mughal rulers opposed fiercely this new spiritual movement and school of thoughts and used all of their resources including the so-called and saleable religious scholars to oppose it. They had been using every efforts and possible means to destroy this spiritual movement. The Imperial Gazetteer of India has also given great tributes to his services for Pushto language and literature. Ba-yazeed Ansari as a Poet: Ba-yazeed Ansari (Peer Rukhan), because of his other active participation in politics and war against ruling empire, could not give due attention towards poetry writing, even than he had composed a great deal of his feelings and thoughts in poetry.His Takhallus (pen name) was “Miskeen” in Pushto poetry and “Wajeed” in Punjabi and Hindko poetry. His Punjabi poetry was compiled and published by Awnkar Naath entitled as “Wajeed day Ashloke” (Poetry of Wajeed). Khwaja Ba-yazeed had also indicated some “Raags” on which, if poetry is composed, could be sung. He himself also composed his poetry in Raag Talang, Kaafi, Raag Bilawal, and Chhund etc. Many famous Pushtoon poets have composed their poetry on the foundation laid by Ba-yazeed Ansari. Hence, the period of early Pushto poetry started with the literary work of Ba-yazeed Ansari and his Khulafa (followers) and Murids (disciples)\n\nwidened its sphere.\n\nPraise to Ahl-e-Bait :\n\nBa-yazeed Ansari has expressed his respect and love for the Ahl-e-Bait-e-Athaar (The pure and pious family of the Prophet PBUH) in his poetry. He has also composed poetry telling about the aims and status of the Ahl-e-Bait . For example he says in his couplets that:\n\n(i) “He (the prophet PBUH) was himself the prophet and beloved of Allah,\n\nHe was the head of all the prophets and prophet of Allah,\n\nIt is surprisingly that the sons and descendents of the Ummah live and survive\n\nbut the sons and descendents of the Prophet (PBUH) die,\n\nO, Wajeed who can dare to plead before Allah to do this and not to do that”.\n\n(ii) “Imaam Hassan and Imaam Hussain were the grandsons of the Prophet (PBUH) and sons of Bibi Fatama Zehra and Hazrat Ali,\n\nWho were got martyred by the hands of his own Ummah,\n\nO,Wajeed who can dare to plead before Allah to do this and not to do that”.\n\nBefore this there were only two or three types of poetry in Pushto language. Ba-yazeed Ansari was the first to introduce Qaseeday, Ghazals, Rubaaiyaat, Qeta’at and Masnavi in Pushto.\n\nPushto Music (Interest in Samaa, Qawwali):\n\nLike other ‘aulias’, Khwaja Ba-yazeed Ansari also possessed love for Mehfil-e-Samaa or Qawwali. He says that there are three types of Samaa.\n\n(i) Haraam: Whoever listen to samaa for taking worldly enjoyment, he heard haraam.\n\n(ii) Mubaah: Whoever listened to samaa in the greed of heaven, his hearing to samaa is mubaah.\n\n(iii) Halaal. Whoever listened to Samaa for his love for Allah, he heard Halaal.\n\nHis devotee, Ali Muhammad Mukhlis, who himself assumed a prominent status in Pashto literature and history, writes about the refined taste of Khwaja Ba-yazeed.\n\n“Besides other beneficences on Pashto literature, he has done more for Pashto music. He and his devotees did a great work in promotion of music of this region. Allah Taala kept two treasures secret from Afghans and two men revealed those treasures to Afghan Nation. The first treasure was that of knowledge about Tauheed which was revealed through Peer Roshaan and the second treasure was knowledge of Music which was revealed to Afghans by Haji Muhammad Khalifa Fazl-ullah Wali, who was a Mureed of Peer Roshaan. Before this, Afghans were playing Ek-taara on Ghanchgeen (a musical instrument) and would play two stings on five sting-Rabaab\n\n(Sarmadah). Because of training of Haji Muhammad, Afghan musicians started using many strings on their musical instruments and created new songs but most of them were not soft sung. But when those musicians met Peer Roshaan, his love and blessings made them sing and play soft and sweet songs.\n\nThey created 6 new soft and sweet songs”.\n\nRoshaniya Movement :\n\nShaikh Ba-yazeed Ansari became widely known as “Peer Roshaan” or “Rokhaan” which in pushto stands for “The Enlightened Sufi Master”. From his base in Kaniguram he started “Roshniya Movement”. The major focus of it was to create equality between men and women, including the right to learn and listen to lectures of scholars AND to fight against Moghal Emperor after his proclaimation of ‘Deen e ilahi”.The learning and equal trearment for women was a revolutionary concept for the times and even today in South Waziristan. Peer Roshaan was the first local leader to start and lead a major insurgency with a remarkable struggle for about half century (later by his sons and grand sons), against the cruel and brutal Mughal sovereignty. This was for the freedom of Afghans and to enforce / establish the Islamic system of social justice / rule. It is difficult to find a parallel example of efforts or struggle done by anyone before him in the history of the Sub-continent. It means, when he was a unique personality in knowledge, literature and Tareeqat, the same time he had a close eye on the political and social atmosphere and situations across the country.\n\nSeeing the popularity of Peer Roshan, the religious scholars and the tribal heads established an opposition’s front against him and started creating hurdles in his way. The bitter opposition to his Sufiyana thoughts and preaching was made by Akhwund Darwiza, well known as Peer Baba of Kaniguram. To the worst of their intention, the opposition forces hatched a conspiracy to get the king’s favour to eliminate Peer Roshaan. For this purpose they gave twelve thousand of the currency of that time\n\nto Habib bakheel and sent to the ruler of Kabul, Mirza Hakeem who was half-brother of King Akbar, with a complaint against Peer Roshaan. They coaxed him to kill Peer Roshaan. For this purpose ruler of Kabul sought the favour of the ministers, dignitaries of Darbar and other tribal heads. Hence, Mirza Hakim commanded the ruler of Peshawar, Mohsin Khan, to arrest Peer Roshaan and bring him to Kabul. Mohsin Khan complied by the order. Peer Roshaan had dialogue with the Qazi-ul-Qazaat (The Session Judge) and made Qazi and the courtiers satisfied with his answers. Mirza Hakim, after being satisfied with him, gave gifts and a horse to Peer Roshaan who left Kabul for home happily.\n\nThat caused him to encounter the regime of the then Mughal Ruler Akbar-e-Azam. The Roshniya movement had been a threat to the Mughal Umpire for a long period of time. This movement not only promoted the Sufiyana poetry but also established and gave progress to the Pakhtun nationalism. This also promoted creativity in Pushto poetry, prose and literature.\n\nA serious mistake committed by the historians:\n\nThe historians of 19 th century, while translating the ideologies and thoughts of Peer Roshaan, committed a blunder as they declared ‘Roshniya movement’ as a separate religious sect. This blunder still prevails in the work of western researchers and historians. Whereas, the ideas and beliefs of Peer Roshaan are that of Ahl-e-Sunnah wal-jama’at. On the other hand Roshniya movement was a movement against the wrong ideology. It was not a separate sect.\n\nHistorian Olaf Caroe admits that “Because of the political diplomacy the importance of the religious movement of Ba-yazeed Ansari was degraded and termed as atheist movement by the bious forces”.\n\nMost of the information about Peer Roshaan’s silsila are taken from “Encyclopedia of Islam” which depends only upon the works of Mughal historians (Sualeh Kamboh and Akhwand Darwiza, the deadliest enemy of Ba-yazeed ) and other traditional Mullas who used to enterprete the messages of Ba-yazeed Ansari in their own way of thinking.\n\nThe critical and comparative study of, “Tazkira-e-Sufiya-e-Sarhad” (history of sufis of Sarhad), written by author ‘Ejaz-ul-Haq Quddoosi’ reveals and confirms that Peer Roshan was a Sunni ul Aqeeda Muslim. He was, neither atheists, nor controversial in his belief as it was wrongly propagated by his political and religious rivals because they were jealous of the popularity of Ba-yazeed Ansari.\n\nImportant note:\n\nIn the light of above facts, it is very clear that many of the important sectors of the life of Ba-yazeed Ansari, the greatest benefactor and shining star of Afghans and Pakhtuns, are still hidden and need to be discovered. However, the upcoming tough time pushed this seeker of knowledge and literature into a war that he had to fight and after him his descendents and devotees were compelled to continue the war for about further 50 years after his death.\n\nDeath and place of Burial:\n\nThe followers and Mureeds of Ba-yazeed had a fierce and bloody fight with the armed forces of Mughal Governor of Kabul at a place called “Chooray” and defeated them. After this victory, Khwaja Ba-yazeed Ansari, along with his devotees, launched an attack on Nangar Haar and established his central defence point at a village named “Baro”. Meanwhile, the Mughal forces got reorganized and launched an attack with great force on Ba-yazeed at a place ‘Tora Raghe’ (Nangar Haar).\n\nIn this battle, the devotees of Ba-yazeed sustained many casualties and were defeated. As his forces were dispersed, Ba-yazeed escaped from the battlefield and reached “Kalpani” (Mardan). Due to hot weather, hunger and thurst , they were surrounded by Yusufzai tribe and he was martyred by them.\n\nAkhwund Darwiza, along with his Yusufzai followers, continued his opposition even after the death of Ba-yazeed. He instigated ‘Gujjars’ (the Yusufzai neighbours) against Shaikh Umer (eldest son of Peer Roshaan). Gujjars dug out the dead body of Ba-Yazeed and before they take away the coffin, Sh. Umer intercepted and brought the coffin to his house, but due to Akhwund Darwiza’s great pressure, Sh Umar had to quit along with coffin and crossed over into the Mandar’s Teritory. Hamza\n\nKhan Yusufzai chased him out and Umer was betrayed and killed along with his followers, along the river Indus. But the coffin was threw away into river Indus, which was recovered by some followers of Ba-Yazeed and was handed over to the only surviving/injured son Jalaluddin, who buried the coffin in ‘Idak’ at Tochi Valley (N. Waziristan).\n\nAfter some time Jalaluddin finally carried the coffin to ‘Teerah’ and buried at ‘Bhat Pura’ with great respect, alongside grave of elder brother Kamal-uddin.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………\n\n.\n\nKhalifa Muhammad Ibrahim Ansari Barqandazi : (1818-1871 AD)\n\n(Buried at graveyard of Basti Danishmand, Jalandhar, India).\n\nKhalifa Muhammad Ibrahim was like a bright full moon in the family of Nau-Shahiya Barqandaziah. His father’s name was Khan Jahan Khan, son of Qutb-uddin\n\nAnsari, Jalandhari. He was born in Basti Danishmand, Jalandhar.\n\nBecoming disciple:\n\nIn the year 1849, Khalifa Muhammad Ibrahim became disciple of Hazrat Hafiz Abdul Wahaab Ghafoori. He assumed the rank of Khalifa after his great devotion\n\nand following successfully the sufi’s spiritual way. Mian Muhammad Mirza was Murshid (guide) of Hazrat Hafiz Abdul Wahab Ghafoori and Shah Abdul Ghafoor\n\nwas the Murshid (guide) of Mian Muhammad Mirza. Muhammad Ibrahim was a great Sufi who had acquired deep knowledge of Tasawwuf (Sufism) and followed\n\nthe pious path of Sufism.\n\nScholastic services:\n\nHe possessed excellent teaching qualities. He was a learned scholar of Arabic and Persian languages. His educational institution “Madarsa-e-Ibrahim” which was\n\nestablished in “Hauz wali Masjid”of Jalandhar city, kept imparting knowledge for about twenty years. This Madarsa had groomed and produce thousands of\n\nintelligent and able students. A learned scholar of Qadirya Sufi order, Maulana Hakim Ghulam Qadir Asar wrote that whenever, Shaikh Ghulam Hussan bin Sheikh Buddha Sulemani Bhalwali and Mian Sultan Must bin Sultan Malik Suchyarvi Nau Sheharvi visited Jalandhar, they would also definitely visit and attend the lectures of Hazrat Muhammad Ibrahim Ansari Barqandazi. They also used to have scholastic discussion and exchange of views for knowledge. His spiritual and visual grace and generosity had been for all whoever came to him. He was an administrator par excellence and an able author. He has written many books and poetry. His pen name was Naushah.Gulzaar-e-Ma’aani : It was his famous Persian poetry book which was written in reply to the nine interrogative couplets which were sent to him by Hazrat Maulvi Aleemullah who demanded answer to them.\n\nKaleed-e-Gunj-ul-Asraar (Key to the treasure of secrets) : It is an interpretation written in Persian language which was completed in the year 1858. It was written\n\non the wish of his guide and Murshid Hafiz Abdul Wahaab. In it Khalifa Saheb has presented the life history and miraculous work done by Mr Nausha whereas, in\n\nthe second part he explained and interpreted the message of Gunj-ul-asraar in a very sophisticated and understandable manner.\n\nIllustrious students of Khalifa Muhammad Ibrahim :\n\nThere had been thousands of obedient and intelligent students of Khalifa Muhammad Ibrahim Ansari, who, with their knowledge and intelligence, not only achieved success in their lives but also brought great names to Jalandhar. Among those, following three were very exceptional and brilliant, who proved their excellence by their work in literature and other fields of life:\n\n(i) Maulana Ghulam Qadir Girami :\n\nHe was born in 1856 in Hoshiyar pur, a well known city in the suburbs of Jalandhar. He was born in the family/tribe of Kakkay Zai. He acquired early education in Madarsa Ibrahim. After seeing his skills, abilities, talents and intelligence , Hazrat Khalifa Ibrahim awarded him title of “Malik-ush-Shoara”, when he was just eight years old. His famous poetry books are “Deewan-e-Girami”, “Masnavi-e-Gi rami”, and “Masnavi-e-Kharabat-e-Junoon”. The poet of the East, Allama Dr. Muhammad Iqbal was also among the brilliant students of Maulana Girami. Maulana died in the year 1927.\n\n(ii) Hakim Maulana Ghulam Qadir Asar Jalandhari :\n\nHe was born in the year 1856, in Jalandhar. He belonged to a famous and learned family of the Ansar Danishmand tribe. He was one of the three exceptional students of Madarsa-e-Ibrahim as referred above. Was an excellent poet and had composed a Deewan entitled as “Deewan-e-Asar” and six other literary books.\n\nHe was an excellent and famous organizer of big “Tarhee Mushaeras” (a poetry recital session in which every poet has to write and recite poetry on a set scale of\n\ngiven verse) in Jalandhar city. He was also Municipal Commissioner of Jalandhar and held this post for five years. His son, Pirzada Abdul Hameed (Ali Garh\n\neducated) was the president of All India Muslim League, Jalandhar. He was also among the spiritual Khulafa of Khalifa Muhammad Ibrahim.\n\n(iii) Maulana Shamsuddin Jalandhari:\n\nHe was also a briliant student of Khalifa Muhammad Ibrahim. Thus the Class fellow of Maulana Girami and Maulana Asar Jalandhari. In later years, another reason for his popularity was that he was the father of Abul-Asar Hafeez Jalandhari. Hafeez Jalandhari acquired guidance in poetry from his father (Maulana Shamsuddin Jalandhari) and other learned poets. Hence we can say that Maulana Shamsuddin Jalandhari has been earning life time benefits of Sawaab for creation on Shahnaama-e-Islam and Qaumi Tarana of Pakistan which were created by Abul Asar Hafeez Jalandhari .\n\n(iv) Syed Mubarak Ali Shah :\n\nHe was Hakim (Medical consultant) for the king of the state of Kapur Thala. He was also among the brilliant students of Khalifa Ibrahim.\n\n(v) Moulvi Mureed Ahmed Khan :\n\nThe special teacher and trainer of Ameer of Kabul, Maulvi Mureed Ahmed Khan was also a genius student of Khalifa Ibrahim.\n\nWe can say that through the services of these great personalities, who had been students of Khalifa Ibrahim, his preaching and services as educationist, religious\n\npreacher and spiritual teacher to the mankind are still continue.\n\nUnfortunately, Khalifa Ibrahim did not have any descendents to continue his family services. However, his younger brother Ghulam Qadir had been a high official in State of Hyderabad Deccan and acquired permanent residence there. He spent rest of his life in Hyderabad.\n\nMian Muhammad Hasan Ali Shah Jalandhari, the fifth Sajjadah Nasheen (descendent in spiritual linage) of Mian Abdul Ghafoor, was one of his obedient and genius disciples.\n\nKhalifa Muhammad Ibrahim Ansari Barqandazi died in 1871 AD / 1288 H and was buried in Basti Danishmand, Jalandhar.\n\nSource of history : 1288 Hijrah / Hadi Chiragh Din).\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nSHAIKH ABDULLAH ABDAAL DUNK\n\n(Buried in Qandhar – 1482-1562 AD)\n\nShaikh Abdullah Abdaal Dunk is one of the descendents of Shaikh Hameed, son of Shaikh Sirajuddin and grandson of Maulana Muhammad Ibrahim Soharwardi.\n\nHis mother was daughter of the second wife of Shahbaz Parind. Therefore, Shahbaz Parind was his maternal grandfather.\n\nHe was one of the greatest spiritual and noble religious preachers of his time, who possessed great spiritual knowledge and qualities. He acquired and inherited Khilafat from his maternal grandfather Hazrat Baa yazeed-1 Shahbaz Parind.\n\nAfter him Shaikh Ahmed Ghous assumed Khilafat and continued the linage of his spiritual teaching.\n\nShaikh Abdullah Abdaal Dunk was blessed with two daughters. One daughter was married to yahya bin Abdullah (who was Khalifa of Ghausul Ikram Sh Ahmad Ghous). The second girl was married to a Burki disciple of Hazrat Shaikh Darwaish who was from Jalandhar.\n\nShrine of Shaikh Abdullah Abdaal Dunk is adjacent to the tomb of Ahmad Shah Abdaali in Qandhar. His shrine is famous as “Mazaar-e-Abdaal Dunk”.\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………"
