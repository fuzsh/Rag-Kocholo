        "text": "Tag Archives: Shiva\n\nLord Shiv – The absolute reality\n\nIn Hinduism, very God and Goddess can be understood from at least four standpoints : the absolute, the cosmic, the departmental and the incarnation who appears on earth to re-establish Dharma.\n\nFrom the highest standpoint, lord Shiv is the formless absolute reality, the nature of pure consciousness. Shiv’s name itself means “auspiciousness”. It is Shiv that transforms an inert body, a SHAVA,(corpse) into a beautiful thing. That Divine consciousness is one’s own true nature.\n\nFrom the cosmic standpoint, Lord Shiv represents the Lord of the universe— the creator, sustainer and destroyer of the world. From the departmental standpoint, he is worshipped as the Deity in charge of the power of destruction.\n\nThus, we invoke the Lord to give us the capacity to destroy our attachments and ignoble thoughts. In his fourth aspect as a particular form that manifested on earth, Lord Shiv is said to have appeared in numerous incarnations as a guru avatar, an enlightened master who teaches the knowledge of the self to his disciples. Sri Adi Shankaracharya and Dakshinamurti Bhagwan are considered to be such avatars of Lord Shiv.\n\nIn his Ramayana, Tulsidas explains that lord Shiv is BRAHMAN, the absolute reality, and Parvati, his spouse, is ADI SHAKTI, the Lord’s primordial power. Tulsidas also points out that the Lord embodies faith that is essential to realise the truth. Yet, even if we have faith, we are unable to see the truth unless we have a teacher to guide us.\n\nThus, Lord Shiv is the supreme BRAHMAN, the faith by which we realise the truth and also the guru who guides us.\n\n—— Swami Tejomayananda ( head of Chinmaya Mission Worldwide)\n\nThe nine shaktis\n\nBefore the manifestation of the world, there was only SHIVA (the BRAHMAN), which existed in its formless state. SHIVA — the formless, omnipotent and omnipresent — existed all alone in its static consciousness state. When the intention to create arose in Shiva, first His creative power emanated from Him.\n\nThis creative power of Shiva, in its formless state, is called SHAKTI and the same in its form is called DURGA. Creative powers are thus feminine in nature. When the feminine power of creation separated from Shiva, it first enveloped Shiva Himself, as otherwise delusion (MAYA) couldn’t have got created which is the basic principle to sustain the creation. Thus, DURGA is also referred to as MAYAVI SHAKTI.\n\nShiva being inert, static and inactive cannot itself create anything. Hence, the active energies are required to create the universe and thus the Dynamic Consciousness (SHAKTI / DURGA) from the static consciousness became necessary. Creating the universe itself has no meaning unless it is supported with sustaining powers.\n\nIn order to sustain the universe and the living beings therein, nine types of SHAKTIS were required. These 9 SHAKTIS became active to sustain the universe. They are referred to as NINE DEVIS.\n\nThe names of these 9 DEVIS are JAGADAMBA, BHADRAKALI, ANNAPURNA, SARVAMANGALA, BHAIRAVI, CHANDI, LALITA, BHAVANI & MUKAMBIKA. Each of these DEVIS are bestowed with distinct powers : JAGADAMBA is bestowed with the power to create and procreate; BHADRAKALI is the giver of fortune; ANNAPURNA is the giver of food to all living and non-living beings; LALITA is the love aspect in male and female beings; BHAVANI is the giver of life force, etc.\n\nWhen we are not in the same frequency as these SHAKTIS, we suffer in the world and create impediments in our road to peace and harmony. During NAVRATRI, these 9 DEVIS are worshipped with the BHAVA of surrendering at their feet and seeking mercy, protection and peace.\n\nMA DURGA, the dynamic consciousness of Shiva and the main cause of creation of the universe, is also bestowed with the knowledge of salvation (MOKSHA). Salvation takes place when Shiva is projected out from the shadow of MAYA. MA DURGA is thus worshipped for the knowledge of enlightenment as well.\n\nThe first three days of NAVRATRI worship are to seek the DURGA aspect so as to cleanse our impurities and destroy the inner demons such as lust, anger, jealousy, hatred, enmity, etc. The next three days dedicated to the LAKSHMI aspect, which is the provider of wealth, peace, health and over all prosperity. And the last three days are dedicated to the SARASWATI aspect, the Goddess of wisdom, for knowledge and enlightenment.\n\nNAVRATRI is the occasion to celebrate and recognise the advent of creative powers SHAKTIS from Shiva and an opportunity to surrender at their feet seeking all-round peace, prosperity, harmony and eventual salvation from the ego of our individual being.\n\n—————– Sadhguru Rameshji.\n\nThe God of all things\n\nAs GANESH CHATURTHI comes up, let us look into the many fascinating stories surrounding the Elephant-Headed God.\n\nGANESH is among the Gods we know the most stories of —– and yet, the one we understand so little about. GANESHA has so much to teach us. What is the significance of Ganesha’s Symbol? Why is an elephant head placed on Ganesha shoulders? This is because only a rich, fertile eco-system can sustain an elephant. So, the elephant’s head is a symbol of prosperity. Ganesha’s rather rotund body represents not only affluence, but also repose —- in other words, success without too much work. The rat that Ganesha rides symbolises the pestilence of problems in our lives that he keeps in check. It is also a symbol of fertility. The MODAK’S shape is like that of a money purse and its contents represent the sweetness of material pleasures. At the same time, the triangular form (upward facing) is a symbol of spirituality.\n\nWhy is Ganesh’s name chanted before beginning any new endeavours ? Before the Gods began churning the ocean of milk for AMRIT, they forgot to propitiate Ganesha. To teach them a lesson, Ganesha caused the serpent king Vasuki (which they were using as the churning rope) to vomit out venom. Choking on the poison, the Gods called out to Ganesha to remove this obstacle to their success. Pleased, Ganesha asked his father Shiva to drink the poison, thus clearing the air and enabling the Gods to restart churning till the AMRIT emerged. Ever since, Ganesha’s blessing is always sought before any new task.\n\nIn his book 99 Thoughts On Ganesha, Pattanaik explains how our ancestors’ ideas of the “perfect life” are reflected in Ganesha’s unique physiology: “Our ancestors concluded that there are two ways to live life —– as a hermit who steps back and contemplates on the nature of the world and as a householder, who stays in the world and experiences it fearlessly. They visualised the hermit as SHIVA……. and the householder as SHAKTI. Shiva does not want to be a father and deal with the trials and tribulations of a worldly life. Shakti wants to be a mother and engage with all things worldly, and she cannot do so without Shiva’s support. From this tension between the hermit and the householder, is born GANESHA —– his animal head representing material joys and his human body representing spiritual bliss”.\n\nFor Ganesha’s “broken tusk” too, there are several explanations. The “tusks” of an elephant symbolises power and aggression. The “broken tusk” implies that the elephant has been tamed. The most popular story about the purpose of the broken tusk is that Ganesha used it as a replacement for his quill while writing down the Mahabharata for Sage Vyas.\n\n——————– Rohini Nair.\n\nWorld Dance Day\n\nDance has existed for as long as the human has been around. It was used to pass on stories from one generation to the next, but over the years, it has been transformed and is used for everything from fitness to therapy. Here’s a look at a few ways in which dance is employed in modern times.\n\n(1) TRADITION : Bharata Muni’s NATYASHASTRA, which literally translates to “the text of dramaturgy”, is one of the earliest texts on the subject. Dance has many forms in India, with each state having its own unique style. From the popular Bharatnatyam to Kathak, and the not-so-known Sattriya of Assam, dance has been a way to tell stories and bring people together. These dance forms have survived centuries and still find eager learners today, with the addition of Salsa, Ballet and Jazz among others.\n\n(2) FITNESS : Almost all gyms in the city offer dance classes. Zumba, which fuses dance and aerobics, is extremely popular in the city. Apart from this, people are also opting for Latin dance workouts. Hip Hop, Jazzercise ( a combination of Jazz and exercise) and Bollywood dance to shed those extra kilos. Feeling a little adventurous ? Then you can try your hand at pole Dancing, Burlesque and Belly Dance.\n\n(3) THERAPY : There are institutes in Bengaluru that offer dance therapy, for those suffering from diabetes, obesity, pregnant women, those in high-stress environments and for IT people among others. Dance therapy merges psychotherapeutic dance moves with holistic therapy which helps support emotional, intellectual and motor functions. It also improves flexibility and strength.\n\n(4) RAISING AWARENESS : Dance is also more and more being used to spread awareness. Although plays that employ dance and music have been used in India to spread social messages, it has got a international makeover of sorts. Taking a cue from the West, city folk have adopted flash mobs to raise awareness on everything from environment to voting.\n\n(5) DANCE DRAMAS : What’s better than one art form ? Dance dramas are steeped in Indian history, but are lately finding a lot of takers in modern theatre. Several plays off late have been using contemporary dance forms to help actors emote and help the audience understand a character better. While plays in India would usually bank on traditionally native dance forms, theatre today has gone a step further by incorporating dance forms and stories from across the world.\n\n——– Dhwani.Desai.\n\nDance when you’re broken open. Dance if you’ve torn the bandage off. Dance in the middle of the fighting. Dance in your blood. Dance when you’re perfectly free.———Rumi (13th century Persian poet and scholar)\n\nEpitome of knowledge\n\nThe one who is the repository of incomparable strength, the one whose body resembles a golden mountain, the one who is the destroyer of forces of demons, the one who is considered foremost among knowledgeable beings. The one who is the repository of all the virtues and good qualities, the one who is the dearest of all devotees to Lord Ram, I salute you.\n\nLord Hanuman is the giver of “gyan”. When there is gyan, “avidya” (ignorance) vanishes. Our problems stem from avidya, which connects us with the unreal. It is because of avidya that a human being attaches himself/herself to health, finances, relationships, social status, etc. all of which are unreal. as they are temporary and bound to leave us, and when they leave, they leave us in pain. Is there anything in the physical world that you can hold on to ? Even your own body is not your own and will be left behind. Yet, we keep chasing the temporary and getting troubled by it.\n\nLet us distinguish ‘gyan’ from ‘knowledge’ here. ‘Gyan’ is the experience that you live through. ‘Knowledge’ is for the brain. The former dissolves the ‘ego’, the latter makes it shoot up, tying a being further into unreality and taking him/her away from reality. ‘Ego’, in fact, is considered as one of the greatest barriers in yoga.\n\nTake a look at the majority of the learned men around you, you will find their egos touching the sky. Lord Hanuman, on the other hand, was a “gyani” — an incarnation of “rudra” aspect of Lord Shiva. He was unparalleled in might, power and abilities. Yet, he made his place at the feet of Lord Ram. He was a ‘gyani’ and so he dedicated his life to supporting the incarnation of Vishnu in its task of preserving the creation.\n\nHanuman Jayanti marks the day when this phenomenal “Shakti” took an earthly form. The energy of Hanuman exists on earth even today, but in a semi-dormant form, as there is no one to awaken them. Hanuman Jayanti is a powerful day to awaken the force of Hanuman, through specific “mantras” and “yagyas.” This normally has the effect of wish fulfilment.\n\n——– Yogi Ashwini\n\nVirupaksha Temple\n\nVirupaksha Temple is located in Hampi, 350km from Bengaluru, in the state of Karnataka. It is part of the group of monuments at Hampi, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nHampi sits on the banks of the Tungabhadra River, in the ruins of the ancient city of Vijayanagar. The Virupaksha Temple is the main centre of pilgrimage at Hampi, and has been considered as the most sacred sanctuary over the centuries. It is fully intact amid the surrounding ruins and is still used in worship. The Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, known here as Viru, as the consort of the local Goddess Pampa, who is associated with the Tungabhadra River.\n\nThe Temple’s history is uninterrupted from about the 7th century. The Viru-Pampa Sanctuary existed well before the Vijayanagar Capital was located here. Inscriptions referring to Lord Shiva date back to the 9th and 10th centuries. What started as a small shrine grew into a large complex under the Vijayanagar Rulers. Evidence indicate there were additions made to the Temple in the late Chalukya and Hoysala peiods, though most of the Temple building is attributed to the Vijayanagar period.\n\nUnder the Vijayanagar Rulers, in the middle of the 14th century, there began a flowering of native art and culture. When the rulers were defeated by Muslim Invaders, in the 16th century, most of the wonderful decorative structures and creations were systematically destroyed.\n\nAt present, the main Temple consists of a sanctuary, 3 ante-chambers, a pillared hall, and an open pillared hall. A pillared cloister, entrance gateways, courtyards, smaller shrines and other structures surround the Temple.\n\nThe 9-tiered eastern gateway, which is the largest at 50m, is well proportioned and incorporates some earlier structures. It has a brick super-structure and a stone base. it gives access to the outer court containing many sub-shrines. The small eastern gateway leads to the inner court with its numerous smaller shrines.\n\nA narrow channel, of the Tungabhadra River, flows along the Temple’s terrace and then descends to the temple-kitchen and out through the outer court.\n\nKrishnadevaraya, one of the famous kings of the Vijayanagar Empire, was a major patron of this temple. The most ornate of all structures in the temple, the central pillared hall is believed to be his addition to the temple. It is recorded that Krishnadevaraya commissioned this hall in 1510 AD.\n\nThe temple continues to prosper and attract huge crowds for the betrothal and marriage festivities of Virupaksha and Pampa in December. In the month of February, the annual “chariot” festival is celebrated here.\n\nSivasagar Sivadol\n\nSivasagar Sivadol is a group of structures comprising 3 Hindu Temples of Sivadol, Visnudol and Devidol. These are located on the banks of the Sivasagar (the ocean of Lord Shiva), in Assam.\n\nSibsagar (present day Sivasagar) was the capital of the Ahom Kingdom. The Ahoms had migrated from South China in 1228, and established their first capital at Charaideo (28 kilometres fro present day Sivasagar) in 1253. Initially, they were Buddhists, though Hinduism came to prevail. The Sivasagar tank was built by constructing embankments, and the water level thus created in the lake remains above the adjoining ground level. The lake has a total area of 257 acres with a water-spread of 129 acres. It is said that the lake water remains stable throughout the year, without any fluctuation, even during the monsoon months. The depth of the water in the lake is 27 feet. Many notable structures have been built on the banks of the lake —— 3 Hindu Temples —— Sivadol, Visnudol and Devidol, a Buddhist shrine, a bird-watching tower to watch wintering birds visiting the area are located on its east bank. The Tai Museum, located on the west bank of the tank, is built with red bricks. A Church and 2 Mosques are also located on the bank of the tank. —– Of the 3 temples, the Sivadol or Shiva Temple, built in the Shikhara architecture has a central tower, which is said to be the “tallest tower” in India at the height of 104 feet. The base of the temple measures 195 feet and it is crowned with a 8-ft high golden dome.\n\nInside the Garbhagriha, the Shiva Linga is deified and it is in a reversed setting. The Shikhara or Vimana (temple tower) has a 4-tiered 8-ft mastaka and is crowned by a kalasha made of gold. The tower, itself, is built with parallel ridges and furrows. The lower part of the tower is flanked by four smaller identical towers, which are known as “angashikaras”. The exterior walls of the temple are embellished with sculptures and floral designs set in Bas-relief. Some of the sculptures on the outer walls of the temple are of the Goddess Durga, who is depicted decimating Mahishasura, the demon king with a buffalo head, by thrusting a spear. She is riding a lion, which supports her in the fight with the demon. This feature represents the harmonious blend of Brahminical Hindu culture with theShaktism cult which the royalty of the Ahom Dynasty had adopted in their religious practices throughout the kingdom.\n\nThe Visnudol is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and the Devidol, also known as Joidol, is dedicated to Goddess Durga. While the Vishnu Temple’s tower has a honey-comb design with an ornamental criss-cross frame-work, the Durga Temple’s tower is designed, in its vertical elevation, with an undulating pattern.\n\nSivasagar city is easily accessible by road, rail and air services. Guwahati, the capital of Assam, is 370 kilometres away to its north-west and regular deluxe buses operate from here. The nearest airport is at Jorhat.\n\nUnakoti\n\nUnakoti, literally means “one less than a crore” in Bengali. It is situated 186 kilometres to the north-east from Agartala, the capital of Tripura. —-It hosts an ancient Shaivite place of worship, with huge rock-cut images and stone idols, dating back to the 7th-9th centuries, if not earlier. While marvelous rock carvings, murals with their primitive beauty form the chief attraction, the mountain scenery and the waterfalls are an added bonus.\n\nAs per Hindu Mythology, when Lord Shiva was going to Kashi, along with 1 crore gods and goddesses, including Him, he made a night halt at this location. He asked all the gods and goddesses to wake up before sunrise and proceed to Kashi. It is said that in the morning, except Shiva no one else got up, so He set out for Kashi alone cursing the others to become stone images and stay there forever.\n\nThe images are located at a beautifully landscaped forest area with green vegetation all around which add to the beauty of the images. The images, found at Unakoti, are of 2 types —- rock-carved figures and stone images. Among the rock-cut carvings, the central Shiva Head and the gigantic Ganesha figures deserve special mention. The central Shiva Head known as Unakotiswara Kal Bhairava, is about 30ft high, including an embroidered head-dress which itself is 10ft high.On each side of the head-dress of the central Shiva Head, there are 2 full-size female figures —– one of Durga standing on a lion and another female figure on the other side. In addition, 3 enormous images of Nandi Bull are found half-buried in the ground. There are various other stone and rock-cut images at Unakoti.\n\nThe site has suffered centuries of neglect causing degradation and loss on a considerable scale to the rock art. Since its adoption by the ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) as a “heritage site”, the situation has slightly improved, though a lot of work, including substantial excavation, remains to be undertaken. The Government of India has approached UNESCO to declare it as a World Heritage Site. The Centre has recently granted 12 crore rupees, to the state, for developing the area as a major tourist attraction.\n\nIt is a bewitching tourist attraction. A mountain and on the sides of it carved out stone images, a spring descending in the rivulet ——– as a place of “archaeological wonder, Unakoti is unparalleled. Unrecorded in history, a mystery surround Unakoti, and that definitely fascinates visitors.\n\nAccording to local legend, there was a sculptor named Kallu Kumhar. Kallu was a devotee of Parvati, the consort of Lord Shiva, and he wanted to accompany Lord Shiva and Parvati to their abode on Kailash. On Parvati’s persuasion, Shiva agreed to take Kallu to Kailash on the condition that he would sculpt 1 crore images of Shiva in just one night. Kallu worked like a man possessed. But, as dawn broke, the number of images was still”one less than a crore”. Shiva, who was keen to get rid of Kallu, used this excuse to leave Kallu behind in Unakoti..\n\nMountain of holy spring\n\nWe all know that if butter is heated, it becomes ghee. But, we often wonder whether we can extract butter if ghee is condensed. Sounds strange. People flock to Shivagange with ghee and this ghee is placed on a stone and it turns into butter. This may be a myth, but this place is famous for this myth, and hundreds visit this place just to see this mystery unfold.\n\nShivagange is a mountain peak with a height of 1368 meters and Hindu pilgrimage center located near Dobbaspet, in Bangalore Rural District in india. It is situated 8 km from the town of Tumkur and 54 km from Bangalore.\n\nShivagange is a place which has a lot of myths. The hillock looks like Shivalinga and locals believe that the spring nearby is holy and call it Ganga, thereby giving the place its name.\n\nThis place is an ideal destination for trekking. Located at an altitude of 1,368 meters above sea level, the place poses a number of challenges. The first part of the hill is easy to climb. As you reach further, the trekking becomes a vertical climb. You need to have real stamina to reach the summit.\n\nAs you are about to reach the summit, you will encounter one more marvel, a huge bell hanging from a rock. One wonders how someone could have hung the bell in such a way.\n\nThe destination point is a narrow rock. Here the trekkers encounter a strong breeze, but the real challenge is posed by simians. They are so strong that they stop the trekkers and check if they are carrying any food. And if they find any food items on you, they will never let you go until you surrender the items. So, never bring any food items with you. That is only a minor nuisance. Shivagange is a geographically important place as the river Kumudvati takes its birth here. Kumudvati is a tributary of Arkavati and joins the river at Thippegondanahalli. The place was under the control of Hoysala Kings, and legend has it that Queen Shantala, wife of Vishnuvardhana, committed suicide by jumping from this hill out of depression , as she could not give birth to a son, and the place is identified as Shanthala Drop. The hill was fortified during the 16th century by Shivappa Nayaka. The founder of Bengaluru, Magadi Kempegowda, improved the fort and kept a portion of his treasure in this fort. Sadly, the fort is now in ruins.\n\n—- Sridhar Vivan"
