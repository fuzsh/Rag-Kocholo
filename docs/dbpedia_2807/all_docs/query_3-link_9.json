(Reuters pic)\n\n----------\n\nPETALING JAYA: The government has been urged to order a review of a 2009 fatwa by the national fatwa council that declared female circumcision compulsory.\n\nAleza Othman, communications officer of Sisters in Islam, told FMT that other Muslim countries, including Egypt and Indonesia had issued fatwas stating that female genital mutilation was damaging to women and girls.\n\nThere was also no conclusive and valid Islamic text in the Quran or the Sunnah (traditions of the Prophet) to justify the practice, she said.\n\nAleza acknowledged that the Islamic development department (Jakim) and the Muzakarah Committee were the greatest challenges ahead to abolishing the practice.\n\n“Most medical practitioners who perform female circumcision on babies in clinics and hospitals have no formal training. They learn the procedure from their seniors, who in turn learned it from their previous seniors.\n\n“The practice of passing on such knowledge without official medical training can do more harm,” she said.\n\nAnother activist group, Reproductive Rights Advocacy Alliance Malaysia, said there was no proof that female circumcision had any medical benefits.\n\nThe group’s president Dr SubatraJayaraj said female genital mutilation was rooted in traditional views and was a patriarchal practice.\n\nInternational health experts say that female circumcision can cause immediate and long-term health risks from excessive bleeding and urinary problems and could also lead to higher risks of childbirth complications.\n\nHowever, the Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement or Abim said it was more important to guarantee the safety of the procedure than to ban the practice.\n\n“It does not affect the girls’ physical or mental health, or psychology. Thus, it is important to ensure the procedure is safe and harmless to them,” said Abim vice-president Fatin Nur MajdinaNordin.\n\nShe added it was the parents’ right to decide on religious grounds if they wanted their daughters circumcised.\n\nThe United Nations has called for an end to female genital mutilation by 2030 and declared Feb 6 as the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).\n\nIt said over the last 25 years, the prevalence of FGM has declined globally.\n\nThe practice is primarily concentrated in 30 countries in Africa and the Middle East, but is also practiced in some countries in Asia and Latin America and among immigrant communities in western countries, the UN says.\n\nSource:Free Malaysia Today\n\nPlease click the following URL to read

Bangladesh: Police\n\nFebruary 05, 2023\n\nSome idols were destroyed while some were found in a pond.\n\n---------\n\nDhaka: Unidentified persons vandalised 14 Hindu temples in northwestern Bangladesh in a series of orchestrated attacks overnight, police said on Sunday.\n\n\"Unidentified people carried out the attacks under the cover of darkness, vandalising idols in 14 temples in three unions (lowest local government tier),\" said Bidyanath Barman, a Hindu community leader at Baliadangi) \"upazila\" or \"sub-district\" in Thakurgaon.\n\nMr Barman, the general secretary of the upazila's Puja Celebration Council, said some of the idols were destroyed while some were found in pond waters along the temple sites.\n\n\"We are in the dark about their (culprits) identity but we want to bring them to justice after investigations,\" Mr Barman said.\n\nThe Hindu community leader and union parishad chairman Samar Chattarjee said the region was always known to be an area of excellent interfaith harmony as \"no such heinous incident took place here in the past\".\n\n\"The (majority) Muslim community does not have any dispute with us (Hindus)... we just cannot understand who could be these culprits,\" he said.\n\nBaliadangi police station's officer in-charge Khairul Anam said the attacks took place between Saturday night and Sunday dawn at several villages.\n\n\"It clearly appears to be a case of an orchestrated attack to disrupt the peaceful situation of the country,\" Thakurgaon's police chief Jahangir Hossain told reporters at one of the temple sites.\n\nHe added that a police investigation was launched immediately to track down the persons. \"I assure you they will have to face stern legal actions,\" he said.\n\n\"This (attack) is the manifestation of a conspiracy against peace and communal harmony...this is a serious crime and the perpetrators will face the music,\" Thakurgaon's deputy commissioner or administrative chief Mahbubur Rahman said.\n\nSource:NDTV\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the text of the original

2023\n\nBuildings collapsed after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit central Turkiye and northwest Syria on Monday, killing more than 500 people. — Anadolu Agency\n\n----------\n\nA major earthquake of magnitude 7.9 struck central Turkey and northwest Syria on Monday, killing about 200 people as buildings collapsed across the snowy region, and triggering a search for survivors trapped in the rubble.\n\nThe quake, which hit in the early darkness of a winter morning, was also felt in Cyprus and Lebanon.\n\n“I have never felt anything like it in the 40 years I’ve lived,” said Erdem, a resident of the Turkish city of Gaziantep, near the quake’s epicentre, who declined to give his surname.\n\n“We were shaken at least three times very strongly, like a baby in a crib.”\n\nTurkey’s disaster agency said 76 people had been killed, and 440 hurt, as authorities scrambled rescue teams and supply aircraft to the affected area, while declaring a “level 4 alarm” that calls for international assistance.\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan spoke by telephone with the governors of eight affected provinces to gather information on the situation and rescue efforts, his office said in a statement.\n\nSyrian state media said more than 100 people were killed and dozens injured there, most in the provinces of Hama, Aleppo and Latakia, where numerous buildings had been brought down.\n\n“The situation is very tragic, tens of buildings have collapsed in the city of Salqin,” a member of the White Helmets rescue organisation said in a video clip on Twitter, referring to a town about five kilometres from the Turkish border.\n\nThe rescuer on the clip, which showed a rubble-strewn street, said homes were “totally destroyed”.\n\nMany buildings in the region had already suffered damage in fighting during Syria’s nearly 12-year-long civil war.\n\nPeople in Damascus, and in the Lebanese cities of Beirut and Tripoli, ran into the street and took to their cars to get away from their buildings in case they collapsed, witnesses said.\n\nIn Turkey’s Gaziantep, Erdem also said people had fled from their shaking homes and were too scared to return.\n\n“Everybody is sitting in their cars or trying to drive to open spaces away from buildings,” Erdem said by telephone.\n\nThe United States was “profoundly concerned” about the quake in Turkey and Syria and was monitoring events closely, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Twitter.\n\n“I have been in touch with Turkish officials to relay that we stand ready to provide any and all needed assistance,” he said.\n\nThe region straddles seismic fault lines and is prone to earthquakes.\n\nFocus on search and rescue\n\nThe tremor lasted about a minute and shattered windows, according to a Reuters witness in Diyarbakir, 350km to the east, where a security official said at least 17 buildings collapsed.\n\nAuthorities said 16 structures collapsed in Sanliurfa and 34 in Osmaniye.\n\nBroadcasters TRT and Haberturk showed footage of people picking through building wreckage, moving stretchers and seeking survivors in the city of Kahramanmaras, where it was still dark.\n\n“Our primary job is to carry out the search and rescue work and to do that all our teams are on alert,” Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told reporters.\n\nThe German Research Centre for Geosciences said the quake struck at a depth of 10km, while the EMSC monitoring service said it was assessing the risk of a tsunami.\n\nThe US Geological Survey reported a series of further earthquakes following the initial tremor, which it put at a magnitude of 7.8. There was a quake measuring 6.7 in Gaziantep and another of 5.6 in the city’s Nurdag area.\n\nTurkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority put the magnitude of the quake at 7.4 near Kahramanmaras and the larger city of Gaziantep, close to the Syrian border.\n\nTremors were also felt in the Turkish capital of Ankara, 460km northwest of the epicentre, and in Cyprus, where police reported no damage.\n\n“The earthquake struck in a region that we feared. There is serious widespread damage,” KeremKinik, the chief of the Turkish Red Crescent relief agency, told Haberturk, issuing an appeal for blood donations.\n\nTurkey is among the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. More than 17,000 people were killed in 1999 when a 7.6-magnitude quake struck Izmit, a city southeast of Istanbul. In 2011, a quake in the eastern city of Van killed more than 500.\n\nPakistan offers condolences\n\nIn separate tweets on Monday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended condolences and sympathies to the governments of Syria and Turkey.\n\nSeparately, the Foreign Office said in a statement that the government and people of Pakistan were saddened to learn that a severe earthquake hit parts of Southern Türkiye earlier today, resulting in the loss of precious lives and extensive damage to property.\n\n“The people of Pakistan stand in complete solidarity with our Turkish brethren in this hour of grief. We extend our deepest condolences to the bereaved families and pray for early recovery of those injured,” it said.\n\nThe statement added that Pakistan stood ready to extend all possible support in the relief effort. “We are confident that the resilient Turkish nation will overcome this natural calamity with characteristic grit and determination.”\n\nSource: Dawn\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1735632/200-dead-many-trapped-as-major-earthquake-strikes-turkey-syria\n\n--------\n\nOfficial: US Backing for Israel Means Support for State Terrorism\n\n2023-February-5\n\n\"Sustainable peace and security, as the main ideal of the UN Charter, will be achieved in the region only after the US ends its costly support of the terrorist regime of Israel. @StateDeptSpox support of this regime means opposition to the right of the innocent Palestinian people to decide their fate and support of state terrorism,\" Kadkhodayee tweeted.\n\nHe, meantime, said that sustainable peace and security in West Asia region will be achieved only after the US ends its support for the Israeli regime.\n\n\"Washington’s support also means opposition to Palestinians’ right to decide their fate,\" Kadkhodayee added.\n\nIn relevant remarks earlier this week, President Seyed Ebrahim Rayeesi lambasted some Western countries' support for insecurity and instability in Iran, and said that Tehran's enemies hatched plots against the Iranian nation and orchestrated protests to stir chaos in the country after the failure of their sanctions.\n\nPresident Rayeesi made the remarks in a televised interview on Tuesday, calling the foreign-backed riots and the sanctions two sides of the same coin.\n\nHe noted how the sanctions had failed to bring production in the country to a standstill, prevent the country from experiencing five-percent economic progress, and creation of close to one million jobs across the nation.\n\n\"Whatever it (the enemy) was after [stifling], has been [contrarily] realized thanks to the nation's will and the government's intention to serve [the people],\" Iran's president continued, adding, \"Therefore, it is natural that the enemy should be angry at us.\"\n\n\"One of the reasons [behind the enemy's fomenting] of the recent riots was the very fact that it was witnessing that its sanctions have been neutralized thanks to the efforts of our statesmen and the steadfastness of the people,\" the chief executive stated.\n\n\"While the enemies are trying to stop the country's progress, our people have resolved to move forward,\" he remarked, asserting that the course of the country's advancement would gather further momentum every day owing to the nation's willpower and the government's determination to be at the nation's service.\n\nSource: Fars News Agency\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.farsnews.ir/en/news/14011116000501/Official-US-Backing-fr-Israel-Means-Sppr-fr-Sae-Terrrism\n\n--------\n\nPope urges end to ethnic hatred at an open-air mass in South Sudan\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nJUBA: Pope Francis appealed on Sunday to the people of South Sudan to lay down their “weapons of hatred” at an open-air mass on the final day of his pilgrimage to a country blighted by violence and poverty.\n\nLarge crowds of ecstatic worshippers streamed into the John Garang Mausoleum in the capital Juba to see the 86-year-old pontiff, who has made peace and reconciliation the theme of his three-day trip to the world’s newest nation.\n\n“Let us lay down the weapons of hatred and revenge... Let us overcome the dislikes and aversions that over time have become chronic and risk pitting tribes and ethnic groups against one another,” he said in his homily.\n\nPeople waved national flags and sang “Welcome holy father to South Sudan” as the Argentine pontiff moved through the crowds in his popemobile before delivering the mass to an audience local authorities put at around 70,000.\n\nFrancis is on the first papal visit to the largely Christian country since it achieved independence from mainly Muslim Sudan in 2011 and plunged into a civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people.\n\nDespite a peace deal signed in 2018 between President Salva Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar, many of its conditions remain unmet and violence continues to roil the country, driving people from their homes into displacement camps.\n\nHope for change\n\nThe wheelchair-bound pontiff, who himself tried to broker peace during the civil war, has received a rapturous welcome throu­ghout his visit.\n\n“I came to see the pope bring change to the country. For many years we’ve been at war, but we need peace. We want the pope to pray for us,” said James Agiu, 24.\n\nHe was among the many who stayed overnight to join the mass at the John Garang mausoleum — built in honour of South Sudan’s rebel hero who was killed in a helicopter crash in 2005.\n\n“I arrived last night. I’ve been waiting here. All night, sitting and waiting,” Agiu said, laughing. “After he goes, I sleep.” On Saturday, Francis met victims of the civil war, who were brought to Juba from various camps, and urged the government to resume the peace process and restore “dignity” to the millions affected by conflict.\n\nWith 2.2 million internally displaced people (IDPs), and another two million outside the country, South Sudan is witness to the worst refugee crisis in Africa.\n\n‘A new start’\n\n“I have been suffering in my life. That is why I’m here, so the pope can bless me and my family,” said 32-year-old Josephine James at Sunday’s mass. “Ever since he arrived, people have been happy. I am very happy.”\n\nThe papal visit has been closely followed in the devoutly Christian country of 12 million people, where church leaders played a key role in protecting civilians during the push for independence and the 2013-18 ethnic conflict.\n\nHe made a pointed speech on Friday telling the country’s leaders they need to make “a new start” toward reconciliation and end the greed and power struggles tearing the nation apart.\n\n“Future generations will either venerate your names or cancel their memory, based on what you now do,” he told an audience that included Kiir and Machar.\n\n“No more bloodshed, no more conflicts, no more violence.”\n\nThe pope had promised in 2019 to travel to South Sudan, when he hosted Kiir and Machar at a Vatican retreat and asked them to respect the ceasefire.\n\nIn scenes that reverberated in South Sudan, Francis knelt and kissed the feet of two foes whose personal armies had been accused of horrific war crimes.\n\nBut four years later, the oil-rich country remains mired in intractable conflict, compounded by poverty, hunger and natural disasters.\n\nIn a sign of the challenges, at least 21 people were killed in a cattle raid on the eve of Francis’s visit in what local authorities termed a reprisal attack in Central Equatoria state.\n\nThe pope’s stop in South Sudan followed a four-day visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo, another resource-rich country plagued by persistent conflict and also often overlooked by the world.\n\nThe trip — Francis’s fifth to Africa — was initially scheduled for 2022 but had to be postponed because of problems with the pope’s knee.\n\nSource: Dawn\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1735600/pope-urges-end-to-ethnic-hatred-at-open-air-mass-in-south-sudan\n\n--------\n\nUS to provide assistance for those affected in the Turkey earthquake: Sullivan\n\n06 February ,2023\n\nUS President Biden directed USAID and other federal government partners to assess response options to the most affected areas in the Turkey and Syria earthquake, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nThe United States is profoundly concerned by the reports of the destructive earthquake, he said.\n\nSource: Al Arabiya\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the text of the original story:\n\nhttps://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2023/02/06/US-to-provide-assistance-for-those-affected-in-the-Turkey-earthquake\n\n--------\n\nMuslims in the Netherlands protest the desecration of the Quran\n\nAbdullah Asiran\n\n06.02.2023\n\nA group of Muslims staged a protest in the Hague on Sunday against recent desecrations of the Quran and Islamophobia.\n\nHundreds of Muslims marched towards Koekamp square as part of the “stop anti-Muslim hatred” protest organized by the Federation of Islamic Organizations (FIO) and the Haaglanden Region Islamic Organizations Association (SIORH).\n\nGathering in the square, they chanted slogans against the desecration of the Muslim holy book, condemning such Islamophobic acts.\n\nThey also performed a prayer and recited verses from the Quran.\n\nSpeaking at the demonstration, Tahsin Cetinkaya, the head of the Turkish Islamic Culture Foundation, said Islamophobia has risen to \"a new level\" in the Netherlands.\n\n\"Muslims, mosques and other Islamic institutions have faced various Islamophobic acts over the years, including the sending of threatening letters to mosques, the hanging pigs’ heads on mosque doors and arson,\" he said.\n\nCetinkaya noted that the perpetrators of these acts are encouraged by the silence of government officials.\n\n\"Enough is enough. Stop holding grudges against Muslims and Islam,\" he said, stressing that Muslims living in the Netherlands are also part of the country.\n\nRasmus Paludan, an extremist Danish-Swedish politician and the leader of the far-right party StramKurs (Hard Line), burned a copy of the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm on Jan. 21 with both police protection and permission from Swedish authorities.\n\nThe following week, he burned a copy of Islam's holy book in front of a mosque in Denmark and said he would repeat the act every Friday until Sweden is included in NATO.\n\nMeanwhile, far-right Dutch politician Edwin Wagensveld, leader of the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA), tore apart a Quran before setting it on fire at an anti-Islam demonstration in Enschede, the Netherlands in late January.\n\nSweden's NATO bid\n\nSweden and Finland formally applied to join NATO last May, a decision spurred by Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nUnanimous agreement from all NATO members – including Türkiye, a member for more than 70 years – is needed for any new members to be admitted to the alliance.\n\nUnder a memorandum signed last June between Türkiye, Sweden and Finland, the two Nordic countries pledged to take steps against terrorists to gain membership in the NATO alliance.\n\nIn the memorandum, Sweden and Finland agreed not to provide support to terrorist groups such as the PKK and its offshoots and the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO) and to extradite terrorist suspects to Türkiye, among other steps.\n\nTürkiye says the two countries, particularly Sweden, need to do more to fulfill their promises, especially in the wake of recent demonstrations by supporters of the PKK terror group and the burning of the Quran in Stockholm.\n\nSource: Anadolu Agency\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/muslims-in-netherlands-protest-desecration-of-quran/2807332\n\n--------\n\nIndia\n\nMuslim body calls for curbs on hate, opposes Uniform Civil Code in Lucknow meet\n\n06.02.23\n\nThe All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Sunday appealed to the “highest authorities” to put in place stringent measures to control “hatred being spread” in the country even as it passed resolutions against the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code and razing of people’s properties.\n\nMeeting in Lucknow, the board also urged the judiciary to take a serious note of the “injustice” being meted out to the weaker sections and the minorities.\n\n“Houses built for decades are getting razed. Those holding peaceful demonstrations are framed under the most stringent of laws and put behind bars indefinitely,” the AIMPLB said in a statement.\n\n“Lawlessness, whether on the part of the citizens or the rulers, is condemnable and all citizens and stakeholders must oppose it strongly,” the board said. The reference appeared to be to the bulldozing of allegedly illegal properties in Uttar Pradesh, actions which critics say target Muslims.\n\nIn its appeal to the “highest authorities”, the board urged them to control the spread of hate “before irreparable damage was done to the fabric of our nation’s harmony”.\n\nThe board passed several resolutions at the meeting, including against “illegal” appropriation of waqf properties.\n\nIn one such resolution, according to AIMPLB general secretary Khalid Saif Ullah Rahmani, the board said the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code would deprive citizens of the privileges provided to them by the personal laws.\n\nSuch a “code is neither relevant nor beneficial for a multi-religious, multicultural and multilingual country like India”, the statement said.\n\nOn the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, the AIMPLB said that failing to implement it could lead to “endless differences among various religious groups”.\n\n“The government must not surrender to the separatist powers and should responsibly safeguard the legal interests of all,” it urged.\n\nOn waqf properties, the board said: “It is unlawful for any citizen or government to grab waqf properties. The AIMPLB strongly opposes statements by some public representatives instigating action to deprive Muslims of their waqf properties and appeals to the government to beware of such actions.”\n\nThe board advised Muslims to take care of waqf properties and use them, as much as possible, for educational purposes.\n\nThe board also called for the following of due procedure of law as it lamented: “Unfortunately, lawlessness is prevailing in the country and an attempt is to implicate the accused even before the prosecution and litigation take their course.”\n\n“Law is a ray of hope for justice. Lawlessness steeps society into anarchy,” it added.\n\nMaking an appeal to the judiciary, the AIMPLB statement said: “Judiciary is the last hope for the public. No bigger misfortune can there be than disappointment on this front.”\n\nThe board observed that religion and faith are matters of belief and conscience, hence, the decision to follow a religion is natural.\n\nSource: TelegraphIndia\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.telegraphindia.com/india/all-india-muslim-personal-law-board-calls-for-curbs-on-hate-opposes-uniform-civil-code-in-lucknow-meet/cid/1914539\n\n--------\n\nFIR Against Ramdev for Remarks on Muslims, Christians in Rajasthan\n\nNew Delhi: An FIR has been registered against businessman and yoga teacher Ramdev in Rajasthan on Sunday (February 5), under sections pertaining to promoting enmity and outraging religious feeling. The case pertains to a provocative speech Ramdev gave in Barmer, where he claimed that Muslims and Christians communities have been “obsessed” with “conversion”.\n\nA police officer told PTI that the FIR was registered at Chauhatan police station based on a complaint filed by a local resident, Pathai Khan.\n\nAccording to Chauhatan police station SHO Bhutaram, the FIR was registered under IPC Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 298 (uttering, words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person).\n\nIn a viral video of a congregation of Hindu leaders in Barmer on February 2, Ramdev can be heard saying that Muslims believe that namaz washes away all sins, including “kidnapping Hindu girls and terrorism”. He added in Hindi, “Ask a Muslim what your religion says, they will say, ‘Read namaz five times and then do whatever comes to mind.’ Whether you kidnap Hindu girls, do whatever sin you want to commit. They think that the meaning of Islam is only namaz.”\n\nHe adds: “Our Muslim brothers commit a lot of sins, but I have seen that they will definitely pray. Because that’s what they have been taught, just pray, do whatever else you want to do. They became terrorists, and a lot of them become criminals.”\n\n“I am not saying this is what Islam or Quran teaches. But it is being followed anyway,” he says in the video.\n\nAbout Christianity, he claimed: “What does Christianity say? Go to church, light a candle, and then stand in front of the Lord Jesus… all your sins will be washed away.” He can be heard saying that Christians wear a cross across their chest and propagate the religion.\n\n“I am not criticising anyone. These people are just obsessed with that. Some say turn the whole world into Islam, someone says the whole world should be turned into Christianity. But tell me what you will do by changing it. No agenda,” he goes on in the video.\n\nThe Rajasthan police had earlier initiated a suo motu enquiry into the statements.\n\nSource:TheWire\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://thewire.in/communalism/fir-against-ramdev-for-remarks-on-muslims-christians-in-rajasthan\n\n--------\n\nPervez Musharraf's love-hate ties with India and his family connection to Delhi: All you need to know\n\nFeb 5, 2023\n\nNEW DELHI: Former Pakistan military ruler General Pervez Musharraf, who passed away in Dubai on Sunday after prolonged illness, had a strong connection to India despite being the architect of the Kargil War and straining relations to nearly breaking point over the Kashmir dispute, cross-border terrorism and nuclear weapons.\n\nMusharraf's complicated ties with India:\n\nMusharraf was born in August 1943 to a middle-class family of Urdu-speaking Mohajir (immigrant) parents in Old Delhi's Daryaganj. The ‘Neharwali Haveli’ was bought by Musharraf's grandfather Qazi Mohtashimuddin following his retirement as the commissioner of Punjab. The property is now mostly in ruins.\n\nHis family migrated to Pakistan after Partition in 1947.\n\nHe fought in the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965 as a second lieutenant, and also participated in the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 as a Company Commander in the Commando Battalion.\n\nAfter his failed misadventure in Kargil in 1998, Musharraf deposed Nawaz Sharif in a bloodless coup and ruled Pakistan from 1999 to 2008 in various positions – first as the chief executive of Pakistan and later as the President.\n\nDespite breakdown of relations with India several times, Musharraf was involved in several diplomatic efforts, peace talks, and negotiations with New Delhi, including the Agra Summit, the Lahore Declaration, the Joint Anti-Terrorism Mechanism, and numerous discussions regarding Kashmir.\n\nAfter the January 2001 Gujarat earthquake, Musharraf expressed his sympathies to then PM Atal Behari Vajpayee and sent a plane load of relief supplies to India.\n\nIn July 2001, Musharraf and PM Vajpayee met for a two-day summit in Agra. However, the talks ended in failure.\n\nAfter the December 2001 attack on Parliament, ties between India and Pakistan nearly snapped as the neighbours amassed their militaries along the border. The standoff only ended in October 2002, a few months after Musharraf pledged that Islamabad would combat extremism on its own soil.\n\nIn January 2004, Vajpayee and Musharraf held direct talks at the 12th SAARC summit in Islamabad, and the two countries' foreign secretaries met later in the year. This marked the beginning of the Composite Dialogue Process, in which bilateral meetings are held between officials at various levels of government.\n\nIn September 2006, Musharraf and PM Manmohan Singh agree to set up an India-Pakistan institutional anti-terrorism mechanism.\n\nMusharraf visited India thrice. He made his first visit to the country for the failed Agra summit in 2001. He also went to India in 2005 and 2009 to watch an India-Pakistan ODI cricket match and to attend a media event.\n\nDuring his visit to India in 2005, Musharraf received his birth certificate from then PM Manmohan Singh. According to records, he was born at a civic-run hospital now known as the MrsGirdhari Lal Maternity Hospital, which comes under the Municipal Corporation of Delhi.\n\nMusharraf resigned as president in August 2008 after ruling coalition officials threatened to have him impeached for imposing emergency rule and firing judges.\n\nAfterward, he lived abroad in Dubai and London, attempting a political comeback in 2012. But Pakistan instead arrested the former general and put him under house arrest. He faced treason allegations over the Supreme Court debacle and other charges stemming from the Red Mosque raid and Benazir Bhutto’s assassination.\n\nSource: Times Of India\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pervez-musharrafs-love-hate-ties-with-india-and-his-family-connection-to-delhi-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/97621645.cms\n\n--------\n\n1999: Year of Kargil war and a power grab\n\nSankarshan Thakur | New Delhi\n\n06.02.23\n\nAt the beginning of 1999, arguably the most significant year in the man’s life, the mention of General Pervez Musharraf would have evoked instant recognition in few beyond Pakistan. By the end of that year, he had blistered a trail to global infamy. He had, almost single-handedly, triggered a war between two nuclear powers, and proceeded not long thereafter to effect a coup and grab power at home — the first military dictator of Pakistan since Gen. Zia-ul-Haq and the last of several our western neighbour has had.\n\nIn the February of that year, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, had been able to together stage what was widely seen as a seminal — and unlikely — manoeuvre towards peace. Vajpayee rode across the border to Lahore with a busload of celebrity Indians and Sharif feted his visitors with a warmth and fervour few would have anticipated.\n\nAt the time Vajpayee and Sharif were baby-stepping towards the peace pipe, Gen. Musharraf was busy plotting an audacious military adventure that would flame out the euphoria of the bus ride, demote it from historic to history. Unbeknownst to the Sharif establishment, the final pieces of launching an invasion across the Kargil frontier were being put in place. Soon Musharraf would force Sharif into a war he couldn’t disown and Vajpayee into one he couldn’t back off from.\n\nThere is a photograph from earlier the same year of Gen. Musharraf placing a pistol — probably a new arrival in the Pakistani arsenal — in the palm of Prime Minister Sharif during a field visit. That pistol Musharraf had put to Sharif’s head and pointed towards Vajpayee.\n\nThe war over Kargil’s frozen and desolate heights raged 10 weeks that summer of 1999. It left the world shivered and keen to put the fires out, for it was two nuclear powers blowing up at each other.\n\nIt exacted an incalculable price — close to 5,000 soldiers killed, thousands maimed and scarred, hundreds of thousands displaced from homes and hearths on either side of possibly the most cantankerous fence on earth.\n\nEventually, the big rollers had to be moved to whistle an end to the subcontinental jousting; Washington intervened and in simplified language what probably happened was that the Americans prevailed on Sharif to prevail on Gen. Musharraf.\n\nBut evidently that wasn’t the end of it; Gen. Musharraf, who spent part of his growing days in Turkey and was avowedly taken by Mustafa Kemal Pasha, wasn’t done pushing his ambitions yet. The legendary Mustafa Kemal had alchemised his military genius with a political vision that founded a modern Turkey radically different from the Caliphate. Gen. Musharraf wanted to emulate his hero, make of Pakistan what nobody had attempted to make it before him.\n\nHis chance wasn’t far to come. In October 1999, when Musharraf was in Sri Lanka overseeing joint military exercises, Sharif made a move he’d long been wanting to — to throw Musharraf out and appoint another general as army chief. Musharraf got wind of it, he flew home, and effected a coup ordering sector military commanders from the cockpit while his aircraft circled over Karachi airport awaiting permission to land.\n\nBetween October 12 and 14, Musharraf ’s garrisons moved swiftly and all across the country. Top politicians were all arrested. The Sharif government was dismissed. The constitution was suspended. From General, Pervez Musharraf became Chief Executive. Of Pakistan.\n\nHe would become President, of course, launch his own political party and lord over his nation for just short of a decade. When he was no more strictly a man of arms — and probably wanted to take a shot at statesmanship — he made ventures at peace with India, at least two of them.\n\nThe second, and the one widely thought to be a more realistic attempt, was conducted quietly in the back-channels during the Manmohan Singh years, and its centrepiece was a four-point blueprint that envisaged fluidity of passage between the two Kashmirs and joint monitoring and mana g ement of issues like water sharing. It never came close to being executed although for a while monitored travel (and trade) between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad did open as part of a confidence-building measure. Those buses run no more, neither do any goods cross this way or that legitimately.\n\nThe first one was a fanfare that the world watched come apart hour after hour. It was the highly billed Vajpayee-Musharraf summit at Agra. Nothing came of it but incendiary sparks; it eventually turned to a damp squib.\n\nThe late General may have thought of that trip a little differently, though. Woven into the Agra itinerary was the place of his birth; Musharraf was a Delhi boy after all, and very likely the only mohajir (refugee from India) to lead Pakistan other than Mohammed Ali Jinnah.\n\nSource: TelegraphIndia\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.telegraphindia.com/india/1999-year-of-kargil-war-and-a-power-grab/cid/1914545\n\n--------\n\nOn foot to Mecca, Shihab Chottur to finally begin Pakistan leg\n\nRAJEEV KR\n\nFeb 6, 2023\n\nKOZHIKODE: Shihab Chottur (29) from Malappuram, who is on a journey by foot to Mecca for Haj pilgrimage, has said that he has finally received official papers from Pakistan permitting him to travel through the country. On Monday, he will resume his journey from Punjab, where he has been staying for the past four months and nine days waiting for the transit visa.\n\nShihab - who was staying at the Aafiyah Kids School at Khasa, Amritsar - made the announcement on a Facebook video on Sunday. \"I had commenced my journey on June 2 and till February 2, I had been waiting for one paper and now I have received it. It's now just hours remaining for me to set foot on Pakistani soil. I will resume my journey on Monday,\" he said in the video.\n\nMushtaq Haji of Karnataka, who is present along with Shihab at Khasa, told TOI over phone that Shihab would cover the 12 km from Khasa to Wagah on Monday morning.\n\nShihab would reach the Wagah border check post at 10am to enter Pakistan, Haji said. Shihab thanked the Aafiyah school authorities in the video for facilitating his stay, saying that he had come to the school maintaining that he would stay there for just three days but his wait for the transit visa got delayed.\n\nHe has covered 3,300km on foot so far, covering seven states from Kerala to Punjab. Shihab, who started off on his 8,640-km journey from Malappuram on June 2, reached near Wagah border in September but could not cross the border as he did not have a transit visa. He plans to reach Mecca in Saudi Arabia and perform the Haj in 2023, after covering Pakistan and crossing over to Iran and a small stretch in Iraq to enter Kuwait and later Saudi Arabia.\n\nSource: Times Of India\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/spotlight/are-you-silently-suffering-from-dry-eyes-disease-eye-care-specialist-dr-nikhil-gokhale-explains-why-you-should-be-worried-/articleshow/97437716.cms\n\n--------\n\n'Supreme Court Partial to Muslims': Suresh Chavhanke's Supporters Attack Observations on Hate Speech\n\nVipul Kumar\n\nNew Delhi: At a demonstration at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar on February 5, supporters of Sudarshan TV head and Hindutva activist Suresh Chavhanke said that the Supreme Court’s critical observations on his 2021 public exhortation to “die for and kill” to make India a “Hindu nation” was “unnecessary legal harassment”. They also accused the top court of favouring Muslims.\n\nChavhanke’s hate speech at an event organised by the Hindu Yuva Vahini, a Hindutva group formed by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath in 2002, had been criticised by the Supreme Court in April last year. The court had also pulled up Delhi Police for its affidavit which had initially concluded that “no hate speech was made at the event.”\n\nPolice also initially said that the gathering was made of people motivated to “save the ethics of their community.”\n\nAdministering an ‘oath’ to the audience at the event, Chavhanke had said:\n\n“If needed, we will kill and get killed for it. But we will declare the country a Hindu nation at any cost. May our ancestors and deities give us the power to achieve our goal.”\n\nOn Sunday, February 5, Chavhanke’s supporters – many of them Hindutva leaders themselves – claimed at Jantar Mantar that there was nothing wrong in the above-mentioned oath. Many speakers also accused the Supreme Court of “Muslim appeasement” and “of being hard on Hindus but liberal with other religions ”\n\nRetired IPS officer Anand Kumar, one of the speakers and the president of the Rashtra Nirman Party, said, “It’s strange that the Supreme Court is asking the police why they’re not taking action or arresting someone, when the police have already stated that there’s no offence found against Chavhanke after an investigation.”\n\nHe also expressed the belief that the Supreme Court is biased in favour of Islam and said it “engages in Muslim appeasement”.\n\nHindutva leaders like Ragini Tiwari, Suraj Pal Ammu, Aastha Maa, and Annapurna Bharti were part of the event. Chavhanke himself was not present.\n\nThere were approximately 300-400 people in the audience, a third of them were school students.\n\n“Our guru ji (teacher) has brought us here. I do not know the reason for our visit,” said a student of Class 8 who had come from Palwal in Haryana, said.\n\nFollowing the reprimand by the Supreme Court, the Delhi police had filed fresh cases against Suresh Chavhanke on May 4, 2022, under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on the basis of religion, race, birth, etc.), 295A (deliberate acts intended to outrage reli­gious feelings), 298 (uttering words, etc., with deliberate intent, to wound the religious feelings of any person) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nOn January 10, 2023 Supreme Court had once again pulled up the Delhi Police, noting that there has been “no arrest”, “no chargesheet” and “no palpable progress” even eight months after the FIR was lodged last year.\n\nBefore the Jantar Mantar event, Chavhanke had tweeted a poster on Twitter which said, “How is taking oath of Hindu nation a crime?”. After the event, he has tweeted visuals of it, including of the children attending.\n\nSuraj Pal Ammu of KarniSena, who has a history of making hate speeches, also spoke in support of Chavhanke.\n\nHe said, “There is a lobby working against Chavhanke, but I want to tell them that he is not a carrot or radish that can be easily uprooted and consumed. If someone tries to stop him, we will keep supporting him. Chavhanke is getting support from all over India to make India into a Hindu nation, and he will continue to receive support. We’re not demanding anything; we’re only asking to remove the country’s traitors, those who eat in India but sing praises of Pakistan.”\n\nAmritanand of Dasna Devi Temple said that the Chavhanke-led Sudarshan News is the “only channel which is saving our mothers and sisters.”\n\n“It works to prevent the throats of our brothers from being slit. It exposes many types of ‘jihads’ including ‘love jihad’ and ‘land jihad’,” Amritanand added.\n\n‘Love jihad’ is an imagined conspiracy popularised by Hindutva organisations, to claim that Muslim men are using marriage to convert Hindu women. The government has on occasion said it has no data on such alleged occurrences.\n\n‘Land jihad‘ is a similar Hindutva allegation which purports to claim that Muslims occupying land are doing so illegally.\n\nAnother speaker at the event said, “This government is of Hindus, not of Muslims.” He used pejorative terms to denote Muslims.\n\n“What sin has our Suresh Chavhanke ji done by demanding a Hindu nation? Would we demand a Hindu nation in Pakistan? Can we not demand a Hindu nation in Hindustan? Brothers, I would like to tell you that Sudarshan News is only channel who raises voice of Hindus. Foreign forces, no matter how much you drink your mother’s milk, our Sudarshan channel will not stop,” he said.\n\nSource: TheWire\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://thewire.in/communalism/supreme-court-suresh-chavhanke-hate-speech-jantar-mantar\n\n--------\n\nBengaluru right-wing group flags mosque construction near electric line\n\nFeb 06, 2023\n\nRight-wing organisation Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS) has approached the Bruhat Bengaluru MahanagaraPalike (BBMP) to stop the alleged illegal construction of a mosque below the high-tension electric line of the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) in AECS Layout – A Block in Singasandra in Bengaluru.\n\nAccording to the HJS, the construction in that area violates the rules laid down by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission, as it is right under the KPTCL high-tension electric line.\n\nA video of a building under the high-tension line in the area, alleged to be a mosque, has also surfaced on various social media platforms.\n\nThe right-wing group alleged that even after repeated complaints by residents to the civic body, the BBMP is yet to take action regarding the issue.\n\n“It is surprising to note that no effort has been made to stop the construction so far even after locals have registered several complaints regarding this.

Their teachings, life and work are still relevant because they worked for ganga-jamuni Tehzeeb, for communal harmony, and for Hindu-Muslim unity. We must make a conscious effort to reintroduce those teachings and sacrifices to our kids,” said Delhi-based historian Syed Obaidur Rahman on Sunday.\n\nRahman was delivering a talk on ‘Let us celebrate our national heroes’ on the eve of the 133rd birth anniversary of freedom fighter and Bharat Ratna Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan at Bapukutti in Sewagram. The event was organized by Vidarbha Muslim Intellectuals’ Forum which would now be holding a lecture series on all such forgotten heroes.\n\n“Not just Khan, many such freedom fighters like Sher Ali Khan Afridi who killed a viceroy in Andman and Nicobar must be remembered again and again. Those who laid down their lives for the nation, sacrificed their careers are unfortunately not celebrated or recognized anymore,” he said.\n\nKhan, who earned the sobriquet of Frontier Gandhi during the Independence struggle, spent 40 years in jail after freedom. “A Hindu fanatic killed Gandhi in India while Pakistani Muslims incarcerated Khan for years. Both never got justice from their respective governments and people,” he said.\n\nA Pashtun pathan, Khan turned out to be a complete contrast when it came to the freedom struggle. “He surprised many when he held out his other cheek forward if he was slapped. He was inspired by Gandhi and adopted non-violence like many others,” he said.\n\nFormer minister Sunil Kedar, city lawyer Firdos Mirza, Parvez Siddiqui, Raja Baig, lawyer Zahed Ali and Aseem Khan were also present.\n\nIn his address, Mirza said that even today, India is known as Gandhi’s nation. “Hatred is being spread in the name of religion especially through the WhatsApp university. There is a need to engage with each other and move closer to the truth,” he said.\n\nMirza added that Maratha warrior king Shivaji’s name is also misused to spread misinformation and divide Hindus and Muslims. “When Shivaji left Agra, he was accompanied by Muslims. When he went to meet Afzal Khan, ministries accompanying him were Muslims. But we are being taught that the Shivaji-Aurangzeb fight was a Hindu-Muslim dispute,” he said\n\nSimilarly, HazratTipu Sultan has been defamed, Mirza said. “Even Sawarkar’s book ‘Six Epochs of Hinduism’ mentions that Tipu Sultan gave acres of land for mandirs. Fatima Bi joined Savitribai Phule is spreading literacy. Andman Islands have graves of several Muslim freedom fighters. The Jallianwala Bagh protest was held against the arrest of Dr Saifuddin Kitchlew,” he said.\n\nSource: Times Of India\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/frontier-gandhi-worked-with-mahatma-for-hindu-muslim-unity/articleshow/97627792.cms\n\n--------\n\nChowk in Mumbai's Bhendi Bazaar named after Khilafat Movement leader\n\nFeb 6, 2023\n\nThe British government, to discuss India's future, held a series of meetings called the Roundtable Conference (1930-32) in London. Among the attendees of the first conference was poet, writer, freedom fighter and Khilafat Movement leader Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar (1878-1931). Though fragile due to illness, the journalist in Jauhar had not lost his impish attitude to power. Addressing the British on November 19, 1930 at the Conference Jauhar said: \"I would prefer to die in a foreign country so long as it is a free country, and if you do not give us freedom in India, you will have to give me a grave here.\" Jauhar's utterances proved prophetic as he died a few weeks later in England and, on the demand of his relatives and admirers, was buried near Masjid Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem.\n\nNinety two years after Jauhar's death, Mumbai memorialised Jauhar this past week by inaugurating a chowk named after him at the busy Bhendi Bazaar in South Mumbai. Sponsored by Congress MLA Amin Patel, the chowk's naming, along with replicas of Sufi saint Makhdoom Ali Mahimi dargah's main gate unveiling, saw Mahatma Gandhi's great grandson Tushar Gandhi attending, who drove down all the way from his Khar residence to the crowded cacophonous venue.\n\nPatel sounded ecstatic: \"This is a humble tribute to a great freedom fighter and leader of the Khilafat Movement. Both Muhammad Ali Road and this chowk will remind Mumbaikars about his contribution to our freedom struggle.\" Gandhi recalled the bond Mahatma Gandhi had with Muhammad Ali and the cause that had brought them together \"The naming of a Chowk after the Khilafat Movement leader is significant in the sense that it reminds us of the champions of Hindu-Muslim unity and nationalism. Muhammad Ali and Bapu (Gandhiji) worked tirelessly and closely to bring the two communities together and create a formidable front against the British,\" said Gandhi. \"At a time when true patriots are being forgotten, such efforts must be lauded.\"\n\nBorn in Rampur (UP), the Ali Brothers (Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali) received sound education thanks to their mother Bi Amma's untiring efforts. Though uneducated, Bi Amma was a brave and revolutionary woman who rode the crest of popularity when her support to Khilafat was captured in a slogan to mobilise the masses: Boli Amma Muhammad Ali ki jaan de do Khilafat pe beta (Muhammad Ali's mother said, son, give your life for Khilafat).\n\nLeaving no stone unturned to educate her sons, she sent Shaukat Ali and Muhammad Ali to Aligarh. While Shaukat excelled in cricket and captained Aligarh Muslim University's cricket team (he later joined UP provincial services), Muhammad Ali went on to Oxford for higher studies, appeared for the ICS exam but failed. Returning to India, he joined the civil service at the Baroda state (prince Fateh Singh of Baroda was his friend at Oxford).\n\nSubsequently, Jauhar quit his job at Baroda, moved to Calcutta where he launched two newspapers, The Comrade in English and Hamdardi n Urdu. Rajmohan Gandhi, in his seminal work \"Understanding the Muslim Mind\" writes that his (Jauhar's) Urdu writing was not as effective as his English.\n\nThough the paper's tone was trenchant and adversarial, many British officials too subscribed to it and Lady Harding, the Viceroy Lord Harding's wife, phoned if the paper did not reach her on time.\n\nJauhar's lasting relationship with Mumbai is inscribed at the iconic Khilafat House at the leafy love lane in Byculla. In 1920 the Muslim Caliphate (Khilafat) in Turkey was under threat from England and Muslims feared that many Caliph-controlled sacred places like Mecca and Medina would go to non-Muslim hands. Indians, led by Ali Brothers, Gandhiji and others, began the Khilafat Movement.\n\nSource: Times Of India\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/chowk-in-mumbais-bhendi-bazaar-named-after-khilafat-movement-leader/articleshow/97631814.cms\n\n--------\n\nPakistan\n\nIslamic scholars declare suicide attacks Haram\n\nFebruary 06, 2023\n\nKARACHI: Islamic scholars on Sunday unanimously declared that all terror activities being carried out in Pakistan, including suicide attacks, are absolutely forbidden (Haram) in Islam.\n\nLeading Islamic scholar Mufti Muneeb-ur-Rehman presided over a congregation of Ahl-e-Sunnat scholars.\n\nAccording to a statement, Mufti Muneeb and leading scholars condemned the recent suicide attack at a mosque in Peshawar.

He enjoyed strong support for many years, his greatest threat al Qaeda and other militant Islamists who tried to kill him at least three times.\n\nBut his heavy-handed use of the military to quell dissent as well as his continued backing of the United States in its fight against al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban ultimately led to his downfall.\n\nBorn in New Delhi in 1943, Musharraf was four years old when his parents joined the mass exodus by Muslims to the newly created state of Pakistan. His father served in the foreign ministry, while his mother was a teacher and the family subscribed to a moderate, tolerant brand of Islam.\n\nHe joined the army at the age of 18, and went on to lead an elite commando unit before rising to become its chief. He took power by ousting the then prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who had tried to sack him for greenlighting an operation to invade Indian-held areas of Kashmir, bringing Pakistan and India to the brink of war.\n\nIn his early years in government, Musharraf won plaudits internationally for his reformist efforts, pushing through legislation to protect the rights of women and allowing private news channels to operate for the first time.\n\nHis penchant for cigars and imported whisky and his calls for Muslims to adopt a lifestyle of \"enlightened moderation\" increased his appeal in the West in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.\n\nHe became one of Washington’s most important allies after the attacks, allowing U.S. forces to operate armed drones from secret bases on Pakistani soil that killed thousands and ordering domestic troops into the country’s lawless tribal areas along the Afghanistan frontier for the first time Pakistan’s history.\n\nThat helped legitimise his rule overseas but also helped plunge Pakistan into a bloody war against local extremist militant groups.\n\nIn a 2006 memoir, he took credit for saving Pakistan from American wrath saying the country had been warned it needed to be “prepared to be bombed back to the Stone Age” if it did not ally itself with Washington.\n\nMusharraf also successfully lobbied then-President George W. Bush to pour money into the Pakistani military. Still, the army's allegiances were never unambiguous: its powerful intelligence services cut deals with the Taliban and al Qaeda, and bolstered an insurgency fighting U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n\nIn other areas of foreign policy, Musharraf attempted to normalise relations between New Delhi and Islamabad.\n\nAt a regional summit in 2002, less than three years after launching the military operation against India, Musharraf shocked the world when, after finishing a speech, he suddenly moved towards Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to shake hands and offered to talk peace.\n\nAnalysts say the issue of Kashmir – which remains the most potent point of contention between India and Pakistan – was close to being solved during the Musharraf era. But the peace process was derailed soon after his rule.\n\nUnder Musharraf, foreign investment flourished and Pakistan saw annual economic growth of as much as 7.5% - which remains the highest level in nearly three decades, according to World Bank data.\n\nThe later years of his presidency were, however overshadowed, by his increasingly authoritarian rule. In 2006, Musharraf ordered military action that killed a tribal head from the province Balochistan, laying the foundations of an armed insurgency that rages to this day.\n\nThe next year, more than a hundred students calling for the imposition of Sharia law were killed after Musharraf shunned negotiations and ordered troops to storm a mosque in Islamabad. That led to the birth of a new militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which has since killed tens of thousands in suicide bombings and brazen assaults.\n\nLater in 2007, a suicide attack that assassinated opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, triggered waves of violence. His efforts to strong arm the judiciary also led to protests and a besieged Musharraf postponed elections and declared a state of emergency.\n\nIn 2008, the country's first democratic elections in 11 years were held. Musharraf's party lost and facing impeachment by parliament he resigned the presidency and fled to London.\n\nHe returned to Pakistan in 2013 to run for a seat in parliament but was immediately disqualified. He was allowed to leave for Dubai in 2016.\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistans-musharraf-military-ruler-who-allied-with-us-promoted-moderate-islam-2023-02-05/\n\n--------\n\nThousands pour onto streets demanding restoration of durable peace in KP\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nMOHMAND: Thousands of people poured onto the roads for the third day on Sunday in different towns of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, condemning the brutal attack on the Malik Saad Shaheed Police Lines in Peshawar and resurgence of militancy in the province.\n\nThe peace rallies were held in Mohmand, Malakand, LakkiMarwat and other areas under the slogan of UlasiPasoon (public uprising).\n\nProminent leaders, who participated in the Mohmand rally, included among others Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) leader Manzoor Pashteen and Awami National Party provincial general secretary Sardar Hussain Babak.\n\nThe peace marchers were mostly youngsters, who were holding white flags, placards and banners, demanding of the government to eliminate the militancy and ensure sustainable peace.\n\nRallies held in Mohmand, Lakki and Malakand\n\nA huge contingent of police was deployed to avoid any untoward incident on the occasion.\n\nAddressing the rally, PTM leader Manzoor Pashteen said militancy and worsening law and order situation had affected every segment of society, including children, women, senior citizens and tribal elders. “Workers of every political party have sacrificed their lives during the war imposed on the Pakhtun region,” he said.\n\nHe said Pakhtuns were divided under a conspiracy, and urged them to show unity in the larger interest of their community.\n\n“Only in Momand Gat area of the Mohmand tribal district at least three dozen people have been killed,” he said.\n\nThe PTM leader urged elders, Maliks and religious scholars to show unity in raising their voice for the recovery of the missing persons.\n\nOn the occasion, ANP leader Sardar Hussain Babak said children of tribesmen needed peace in their region and authority over their resources.\n\n“We consider this region as our own and value it like a mother,” Mr Babak said. He demanded of the religious scholars to issue verdict against the ongoing terrorism and killing of innocent people. “Our resources are being looted and our children are dying of hunger,” he said.\n\nHe said how did militants crossed over into Pakistan and reached Peshawar after the border with Afghanistan had been fenced and military posts set up along it.\n\nIn LakkiMarwat, the local residents took out a peace rally on Sunday.\n\nThe rally appeared from Shaheed Abid Ali Chowk and converged at Qazi Ishfaq Chowk on the main bust stand in the Lakki city after marching on Tajazai-Lakki Road.\n\nThe participants were holding banners and placards inscribed with slogans, highlighting their demands for peace and harmony.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Dr Muhammad Iqbal of PTI, Eng Ihsan, Malik Waqar, InamKhoidadkhel and Shahid Tajoriwal said residents of the district were peace-loving and they wanted sustainable peace in their area.\n\nThey said area people would not allow anyone to destroy peace and use their soil for carrying out anti-state activities.\n\nThey said that along with poor law and order, the local residents had to face the brunt of excessive gas and power outages, besides suspension of mobile and internet services had added to their troubles. They said that a pipeline was being laid to supply gas to Punjab, but the local residents were ignored.\n\nThe speakers called upon the elders and public representatives to ‘break their silence’ and play role in ending lawlessness and protecting rights of people.\n\nIn Malakand, workers of political parties and civil society activists came out on the streets in Batkhela to demand establishment of durable peace on their soil.\n\nThe participants carried white flags, banners and placards and marched from Zafar Park to the old bus stand, chanting slogans for restoration of peace.\n\nJamaat-i-Islami’s former provincial minister Shah Raz Khan, former MNA BakhtiarMaani, ANP district president Ejaz Khan, former provincial minister Shakeel Khan, Maulana Imran Hilali of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Maulana Javed, PML-N’s city president Ali Mohammad, All Chairmen and CouncillorIttehad president Pir Azmat Shah, Muslim Khan of Pakistan Peoples Party, Sikandar Hayat, Zafar Ali Khan and traders’ union president Zwar Khan also attended the rally.\n\nSource: Dawn\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1735535\n\n--------\n\nPakistan divided on legacy of military ruler Musharraf\n\nFeb 5, 2023\n\nISLAMABAD: Pervez Musharraf was a polarising figure in Pakistani politics, taking the country back to a period of economic stability while accused of rampant abuses and weakening democracy.\n\nThe nation's most recent military leader governed for nearly a decade after seizing power in a bloodless coup in 1999.\n\nHis rule was marred by repeated allegations of abuses, including ruthlessly rounding up his opponents as well as being accused of involvement in former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination.\n\nThe effects of his decision to back the United States in its invasion of Afghanistan -- albeit in the face of threats of bombing and in return for a massive aid injection -- continue to reverberate.\n\n\"Musharraf boosted education standards and infrastructure in Pakistan. He brought development to the country,\" 24-year-old student Mohammad Waqas told AFP in Islamabad.\n\n\"But on the other hand, the country suffered losses in the face of terrorism. Entering America's war weakened our own country.\"\n\nPakistan is currently undergoing yet another economic crisis, and widespread political uncertainty ahead of elections due later this year.\n\nIn the face of the turmoil, some remember Musharraf with a certain fondness.\n\n\"He was a good ruler.

I will go to jail first,” he said.\n\nHe said everyone was aware of the country’s situation for the past two months and the current government had ruined the country’s economy.\n\nGovt ‘prepared to arrest PTI chief’ if fresh protest launched, says minister\n\nMr Habib feared that a government’s deal with the International Mone­tary Fund would further increase inflation and compound the public’s suffering.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking to PML-N workers at a party convention in Multan on Sunday, MrSanaullahcriticised the PTI leadership for “creating troubles”.\n\n“In 2014, PTI staged protest demonstrations and tried to stop the journey of progress and prosperity. Imran Khan is following the politics of agitation in the shape of long marches, sealing Islamabad on the pretext of a date for elections,” he said.\n\nCommenting on the PTI’s Jail Bharo movement, the interior minister hoped Imran Khan would be placed in the “same death cell where I was placed during my arrest”.\n\nDismissing the impression that the PML-N was not ready for general elections, he said the party would contest and win elections and form a government in Punjab.\n\nPML-N’s Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who also addressed the Multan convention, took a jibe at the PTI’s court arrest drive, saying Mr Khan was running a Jail Bharo movement for four years during his tenure as prime minister.\n\nOn the arrests of senior PTI leaders and ally Sheikh Rashid, Ms Sharif said they had been “crying like children”. She added, “We spent five years in jail with a smile, but they had started weeping after five days of imprisonment.”\n\nShe also named PML-N leaders who were put in jail during Imran Khan’s government, including her father Nawaz Sharif, uncle Shehbaz Sharif, cousin Hamza Shehbaz, and senior party leaders Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Rana Sanaullah, Ahsan Iqbal and others.\n\n‘No Constitution exists’\n\nIn Jhelum, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said at a party’s public meeting that former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, who passed away on Sunday, did the right thing when he ended the Nawaz Sharif government in 1999.\n\nNoting that PPP and PML-N leaders were passing remarks against Mr Musharraf for dislodging the Constitution, Mr Chaudhry questioned: “Does any Constitution exist during the current government tenure?”\n\n“I think retired Gen Musharraf was right in suspending the Constitution because there was zero implementation of the Constitution in the presence of Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari,” he said.\n\nMr Chaudhry said the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition was running away from elections and was busy “torturing PTI stalwarts”.\n\nHe said the PDM was attacking and entering the houses of PTI leaders to arrest them. “You will kill me in the night, and I will meet you in the headline of the newspaper in the morning,” he said.\n\nSource: Dawn\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1735608\n\n--------\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nRacial slurs should be made a crime, says Noor Farida\n\nReshna Reem Ganesan\n\nFebruary 5, 2023\n\nPETALING JAYA: A law to criminalise racial remarks should be introduced, says a former top civil servant, following two incidents involving remarks by a social media influencer and a national hockey player.\n\n“I really can’t believe these kinds of things are still happening.

PM Anwar squares up to new political realities\n\nZainudinAfandi\n\n04 Feb 2023\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: After Malaysia’s recent general election produced a hung parliament, artist Faye Lim was thrilled when Pakatan Harapan (PH) got the chance to form the government again.\n\nThe 32-year-old was among those who opposed the internal coup in 2020 that had brought down the previous PH government.\n\nSo in December, when Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, chairman of PH, won a vote of confidence in the Malaysian parliament to emerge as the undisputed leader of the new unity government, it was what Lim wanted.\n\n“Give people a chance to finish what they start,” she said. “If (politicians) are always going to keep repeating … ‘I’ll never work with’ (or) ‘I don’t want’, then … (they) aren’t thinking about us as a whole nation holistically.”\n\nYet, the alliances that make up the current government, chiefly between PH and rivals Barisan Nasional (BN), are more tenuous than those in the PH government that came to power at the 2018 election.\n\nCan the unity government find a way to work together and last a full term in office, the programme Insight asks. It might prove a daunting task — and is not the only challenge lying ahead of the new PM.\n\n‘COALITION OF INCOMPATIBLES’\n\nWith the King having decreed that BN must be part of a unity government to end the impasse following the elections, the previous incumbents surprised some observers by choosing to work with PH instead of Malay-centric coalition Perikatan Nasional (PN).\n\n“(The unity government) is a coalition of incompatibles,” said former PM Mahathir Mohamad.\n\n“They don’t have the same objective or the same philosophy and yet they found a need to work together, so they overlooked all their past statements, past promises, in order to form this coalition.”\n\nWithin the United Malays National Organisation (Umno) itself, BN’s anchor party, there is recognition of “complications” arising from the party being “ideologically” opposed to the Democratic Action Party (DAP) — a PH component party — acknowledged Umno information chief HizatulIsham Abdul Jalil.\n\n“This is something that we need to sort out,” he said. “(But) it makes sense for us to go with PH because they need the Malay votes, and we need the non-Malay votes.”\n\nTo hold the alliance together, Anwar made compromises over key roles.\n\nPH component party PartiKeadilan Rakyat (PKR), which has 31 Members of Parliament, was given eight ministerial portfolios. BN, which won 30 seats, has six ministers. The DAP, meanwhile, has four ministers even though it has 40 MPs.\n\nThere is “some unhappiness” with that, acknowledged DAP secretary-general Anthony Loke, but he thinks his party’s “sacrifice” is for the good of the country. “The alternative will be a government being led by Pas (Parti Islam Se-Malaysia),” he said.\n\n“So I think … the Chinese community and, by and large, the non-Malays including the Indian community supported our decision to be part of the government even with the lesser representation in the Cabinet.”\n\nVoon Zhen Yi, the research director of think-tank KSI Strategic Institute, believes it is clear that the DAP realised it “had to take a back seat” to “not jeopardise” the unity government and that their supporters “are pragmatic people” too.\n\nThere are also other factors that could help Anwar keep his government together.\n\nFor one thing, winning his vote of confidence from parliament cemented his hold on the top job and brought the parties in the ruling coalition “under his wing”, according to political scientist Chandra Muzaffar.\n\n“To work together and to show that they’ll keep working together, he needed a vote of confidence,” said Muzaffar. “It’s also contributed towards stabilising the position of his own party.”\n\nLegislation that took effect from October to prevent party-hopping might also prevent a repeat of the machinations that had previously removed PH from power — because MPs who now switch political affiliations would trigger a by-election in their district.\n\nAnd as a sign that “the public doesn’t want to see things like this happen”, those who were seen as orchestrators of the internal coup, such as Mohamed Azmin Ali, lost in the last election.\n\n“(Voters) have had enough of that — three prime ministers in the course of four years,” cited Muzaffar.\n\nTHE ECONOMIC CHALLENGE\n\nWhether Anwar can keep his unity government together may also depend on how well he governs. And he now must respond to the problems of a slowing economy and high cost of living.\n\n“People want stability. People want their food on the table, their bread and butter to be guaranteed. And they want a better life, a better job,” said Maszlee Malik, the former education minister in PH’s first administration.\n\nTake, for example, Mohamad Zulkhairi Mohamad Adnan, who used to own a boutique specialising in traditional Malay clothing in Johor. He also sold cooked meals in bazaars and on government premises.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit sales hard, he had to close down his businesses and return to his home town in Negeri Sembilan. He set up a roadside stall selling fried chicken, but it is hard to sustain the business.\n\n“When (costs) go up, we can’t afford to raise our prices in a flash. Our regular customers would be aware of it,” said the 49-year-old, who worries that they may “find other alternatives”.\n\nMalaysia’s core inflation was 4.1 per cent year on year in December. Food continued to be the main inflation driver, with prices up by 6.8 per cent compared to a year earlier.\n\nBeyond addressing the rising cost of living, the new government must “show that Malaysia has its own value proposition, its own offering”, as Voon put it.\n\n“It has to show everyone that investment in Malaysia will bring benefits to them,” he said, flagging Vietnam and Indonesia as economies in the region that are “catching up” and showing potential for “overtaking Malaysia very soon”.\n\nTo deal with these challenges to the country’s post-pandemic recovery efforts, the PM assembled a new economic team.\n\nHe appointed PKR deputy president Rafizi Ramli as economic affairs minister and Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz, the former finance minister, to helm the International Trade and Industry Ministry.\n\n“We can see that … they’ve been involved in the corporate world. They’re young, they’re hard-working, enthusiastic, and they know what they’re supposed to do now,” said economist Ahmed Razman Abdul Latiff of Putra Business School.\n\nThe associate professor also thinks it helps that Anwar appointed himself as finance minister, given that when he held the portfolio in the 1990s, he kept the growth in Malaysia’s gross domestic product, on average, at 9.2 per cent.\n\n“The confidence factor is there,” said Ahmed Razman.\n\nTHE RISE OF POLITICAL ISLAM?\n\nA bigger challenge facing the PM — if he is to not only unify the ruling coalition but also unite the country — is the growth of identity politics.\n\nIn a survey conducted by pollster Merdeka Centre, which reported the findings last year, 82 per cent of the Muslim youth respondents agreed that the Quran should replace the country’s constitution, up from 72 per cent in 2010.\n\nThe survey also found that the proportion of Muslim youths attending religious schools increased from 48 per cent to 60 per cent.\n\n“There are some elements of conservatism not only amongst youths but amongst the Malays in general. We see that pattern. We see that happening in the institutions as well,” said ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute senior fellow NorshahrilSaat.\n\nThe rise of Pas is partly due to these changing attitudes of Malays towards their religion. The Islamic party defied expectations by winning 49 seats in November, compared with 18 previously.\n\nAnd the identity politics have persisted after the elections.\n\nOne of the reasons ZoolAmaliHussin left Umno was its leaders’ move to form the government with PH’s multiracial coalition, which was “hard for (him) to accept” as he saw it as a betrayal.\n\n“We’d been indoctrinated with the idea that the DAP is racist, the DAP is Umno’s enemy,” he said. “But all of a sudden, they’re with the DAP. They’re saying it’s part of the dynamics of politics.”\n\nHe quit as Seremban Umno Youth chief to join Pas, “the party that really fights for Islam and the Malays”, he said. And it has been reported that other Umno members have followed in his footsteps.\n\nThe question, then, is whether this shift in the political scene marks the rise of political Islam, and what that bodes for Malaysia.\n\n“Political Islam has definitely gained momentum in this country,” said Voon. “It’s matching global trends that we’re seeing — the rise of right-wing politics.”\n\nFrom a different perspective, the breakout success of Pas may not indicate the growth of political Islam, but rather the growing tide of opposition to Umno.\n\n“All that’s happened is that the Malays have become disillusioned with Umno, and they registered their disillusionment by supporting Pas, which they’ve done in the past,” argued Muzaffar, citing what happened to Anwar in 1998, which “discredited” Umno.\n\n“Remember the black eye issue? Because you had a (former) deputy prime minister imprisoned, beaten in jail … people moved to Pas.”\n\nIn the 1999 elections, Pas won 27 parliamentary seats, which was their best electoral performance until last year.\n\nThe latest groundswell of support for Pas “isn’t really” the rise of “political Islam per se”, agreed Maszlee, who lost out to a BN challenger in November.\n\nBut what motivates many members of the PN component party — who are “still pushing a lot of content” over TikTok and other social media — is a mistrust of “the others”, he said.\n\n“(They’re) stoking the racial sentiments … instigating the distrust (of) the others every day,” he observed. “If the current government doesn’t do anything, the momentum will keep rising.”\n\nAre the fissures in Malaysian politics today too wide too bridge?\n\nPartiPribumi Bersatu Malaysia Youth chief Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Kamal, for one, does not think his party’s coalition partner is “regarded as extreme”, since Pas was part of the government before the recent election.\n\nSource:ChannelNewsAsia\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/malaysia-ruling-coalition-anwar-ibrahim-pakatan-harapan-barisan-nasional-3251496\n\n--------\n\nMalaysia expresses interest in recruiting 'security guards' from Bangladesh\n\nFeb 5, 2023\n\nMalaysia today expressed its interest in recruiting \"security guards\" from Bangladesh.\n\nThe development came as Malaysian Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail paid a courtesy call to his Bangladesh counterpart Asaduzzaman Khan at the state guest house Padma today afternoon.\n\nAccording to a press release, Ismail said his country will take security guards from Bangladesh after Kamal requested him to recruit professional and trained Ansar, and retired members of law enforcement agencies from Bangladesh to provide security at different institutions in Malaysia.\n\nRohingya repatriation, labor-related issues, training and exchange of knowledge and information between the two countries' law enforcers were discussed during the meeting.\n\nMP Benzir Ahmed, chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the home ministry, Aminul Islam Khan, senior secretary of the home ministry, Inspector General of Police Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun, additional IGP of Special Branch, DMP commissioner, director general of Department of Immigration and Passports, and Bangladesh high commissioner in Malaysia were present in the meeting, among others.\n\nSource:TheDailyStar\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/diplomacy/news/malaysia-expresses-interest-recruiting-security-guards-bangladesh-3239876\n\n--------\n\nSouth Asia\n\nQatar sends envoy to Kabul for talks with Taliban\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nKABUL: An envoy for Qatar’s foreign affairs minister visited the Afghan capital on Sunday and met the Taliban administration’s acting foreign minister, according to an Afghan foreign ministry statement.\n\nThe visit comes after the Taliban administration placed restrictions on women’s education and NGO work, which Qatar labelled “deeply concerning” amid widespread international criticism.\n\nMutlaq Bin Majed Al-Qahtani, the special envoy of Qatar’s foreign minister, took part in meetings with acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul, according to Afghan foreign affairs spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi.\n\n“Both sides discussed political coordination, the strength of the relationship and humanitarian aid,” Balkhi said.\n\nNo foreign country has formally recognised the Taliban government, though both China and Pakistan sent their foreign ministers last year and the UN deputy special representative recently visited to discuss women’s rights and aid.\n\nSource: Dawn\n\nPlease click the following URL to read the full text of the original story:\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1735584/qatar-sends-envoy-to-kabul-for-talks-with-taliban\n\n--------\n\nPakistan to approach Taliban chief Akhundzada, will beg Afghanistan to help control TTP\n\nAjeyoBasu\n\nFebruary 05, 2023\n\nKabul: With the Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) carrying out a series of deadly attacks, the Pakistan government has been left with no other option other than begging the Taliban regime of Afghanistan to help control the Islamist militant group.\n\nA desperate Pakistan has sought Afghan Taliban chief Haibuttallah Akhundzada’s help to rein in the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) – also known as the Pakistani Taliban – which has carried out a wave of attacks against the security forces in the country, including the recent suicide blast in a Peshawar mosque that killed over 100 people, mostly policemen"
