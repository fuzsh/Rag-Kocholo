        "text": "Nathar Shah (969â1039),[1] also called Nadir Shah or Nathar Wali, was a Muslim mystic and preacher from the Middle East who migrated to Tamil Nadu in the 11th-century, where he travelled from area to area to preach the faith of Islam to the locals.[2] He came to Trichy in the 11th century; his shrine is located in Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu,[3][4] which according to legend is atop the grave of the three-headed Hindu demon Tiriasuran whom Natha killed.[3]\n\nLife in Tiruchirapalli\n\nNathar Vali's origin is unclear, though various legends describe him as a Byzantine nobleman, who left his comfortable life in search of murshid (spiritual preceptor).[3][5]He was a qalandar (unmarried saint) came to India along with 900 qalandars to spread Islam. During this time, he is said to have performed miracles. Along with his qalandars, he came to Tiruchirapuram, which is now known as Tiruchirappalli, and led a religious life with his qalandars in a flower garden there.\n\nDeath\n\nHe died in Tiruchirappalli in 1039 and was buried in the city and a mosque constructed at the spot.Long after his death, Tiruchirappalli is still referred to by his followers as \"Natharnagar\". Nathar Vali died on the 15th of the month of Ramadan. This date is commemorated as his urs (death-day), and the first 17 days of Ramadan are celebrated in his honor, by Muslims, Christians, and Hindus, one the eve of the Kanduri festival, where they seek his blessings.\n\nAlternate names\n\nNathar Vali's name and title is variously rendered as Nathar Wali, Natharuddin, Baba-e-Nathar Sarmast Tabl-e-Aalam Dhool Samandar and Syed Sha Mutaheruddin Suhrawardy.\n\nReferences\n\nArnold, T.
