        "text": "Sufism has long constituted one of the most powerful drawcards to people embracing Islam. This book considers a broad range of questions relating to Sufism, including its history, manifestations in various countries and communities, its expression in poetry, women and Sufism, and expressions among popular spirituality. In addition, the volume challenges the long-held view of Sufism as being necessarily peaceful, through a consideration in one paper of Sufis engaging in violent Jihad. The book works at the interface between the scholarly and the practical, using rigorous methodology to ensure that its findings are reliable, while also giving attention to how Sufi thinking impacts the daily lives of Sufis. This represents an original and important dimension of this study, given the significant role played by Sufis throughout Islamic history in enriching discussion of intellectual and charismatic questions, as well as informing popular practice among \"Folk\" Muslims.\n\nSince the advent of the “modern” age, the main mystical trend of Islam, namely Sufism, has become the target of novel, multifaceted criticism in the Muslim World. The strong denunciation of “folk” Sufism by Muslim purists and fundamentalists of the eighteenth century onwards—who often consider mystical Islam to be a major part of, and reason for, the deviation from an imagined, pristine Islam—was followed by a fresh wave of Sufi antagonism by a group of Muslim modernists and secular thinkers from the nineteenth century, who regard Sufism as something belonging to the past and thus incompatible with the present. Notwithstanding these intense and multifarious critiques, Sufism has remained an active part of Muslim life and culture in both Muslim-majority and Muslim-minority areas, even extending its presence to new spheres such as Europe and America. The current Special Issue analyzes and examines different aspects of such vibrant activity and scrutinizes the dynamics of the beliefs, practices, institutions, interpretations, conceptualizations, and aesthetics of Sufism in the modern world. It offers its readership a broad and multidisciplinary perspective on the contemporary vitality of mystical Islam and addresses the issue through various academic fields such as religious/Islamic studies, intellectual history, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, gender studies, and minority studies. Contributors to this volume have demonstrated that Sufism, like Islam itself, should be understood and studied “in context” and with regard to its constant change-in-continuity.\n\nThis article is about Muslim Sufism which is practical form of Islam. It stressed the inner search of Allah and shuns materialism. Sufism is always under severe attack. It is reality that illiteracy has shadowed the real face of Islam and started some un-Islamic rituals which supported the stance of hard liners. In this article with the help of Quranic verses and sayings of Prophet F D F A , I have tried to prove that Sufism is not out of Islam. When worldly minded people over took the control of Muslim world, some high ranked pious people appeared on the scene to purify the religion. This article gives a brief history and sayings of notable Muslim scholars about Sufism.\n\nSufism is a very important knowledge to be learned and practiced by every Muslim. It is a knowledge that can teach people and develop their soul, emphasizing on the principles of good moral character as practiced by the Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.). It is also a way to seek Allah’s pleasure. Thus, Sufism is seen as one of a strong platform in the restoration and development of the soul and spiritual aspect. In this aspect, weakness is seen as one of the causes of the existence of various social ills that are currently plaguing the Muslim community. Muslim youth are involved in bullying, gangsterism, theft, robbery, rape, prostitution, drugs, vandalism etc. All these problems are increasing and have become a huge concern from day to day. The Muslim youths’ spiritual deterioration is so severe that it has directly given many negative impacts to the society. Therefore, this paper will discuss on the teachings of Islamic Sufism. Reality is the universal will, the true knowledge, eternal li..."
