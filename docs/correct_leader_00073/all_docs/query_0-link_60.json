        "text": "Airport Name\n\nNassau International Airport\n\nAirport Location\n\nThe airport is located 10 miles west of the capital Nassau on New Providence Island.\n\nTerminals\n\n2\n\nIATA Code\n\nNAS\n\nTelephone\n\n242 377 1759\n\nAirport Overview\n\nNassau International Airport, now known as Lynden Pindling International Airport, is situated 10 miles (16 km) west of Nassau, New Providence Island. It is the Bahamas’ largest airport and the country’s main gateway to the world.\n\nHaving recently undergone renovations, including terminal expansion and upgrading of various facilities, as well as the addition of 34 new gates, Nassau International now has the capacity to handle 5 million passengers per year. Staff are friendly, queues are generally short and check-in and security fast and painless. Better yet, the airport features a US Border pre-clearance facility for flights traveling to the US. Shopping and dining options are limited, though. In essence, Nassau International is a quick in-and-out airport with little reason to stay longer than you need to.\n\nTerminal Transfer\n\nThe two terminals are within walking distance of each other.\n\nGetting into Town\n\nTaxi: Taxis are the only form of public transport to and from the airport; rates are between $3 and $6, depending on your destination.\n\nCar Parking\n\nThree car parks offer 1,760 spaces. A short-term lot caters to those dropping off or meeting passengers; charges are $2 for two hours and $2 for every 20 minutes thereafter, with a daily maximum fee of $30. Two regular car parks charge $3 per hour and $9 per day.\n\nInformation Desks\n\nThere are information desks in both Arrivals and Departures of Terminal 1.\n\nAirport Facilities\n\nMoney and communications: ATMs, currency exchange and post office.\n\nLuggage: There is a lost-and-found service; however, there are no left-luggage services.\n\nConference and business: There are no business facilities at the airport, although many nearby hotels offer meeting rooms and conference amenities.\n\nOther facilities: A number of Internet kiosks are located throughout both terminals.\n\nWi-Fi: Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the terminal.\n\nShopping: There are a few shops selling music, clothing, gifts and souvenirs.\n\nFood and drink: Eating and drinking at Nassau International is limited to a small restaurant, a few cafes and some bars."
