        "text": "By Bruce Rigsby, Lindy Allen and Diane Hafner The cultural record of the Lamalama people of far north Queensland is well represented in the Norman B. Tindale Collection held at the South Australian Museum(SAM). This record derives from the Expedition to Princess Charlotte Bay in 1926–27, a collecting trip sanctioned by the SAM’s Board of Governors to expand ‘the hitherto! meagre Museum collections’ from southern Cape York Peninsula Norman Tindale would establish his reputation as the Museum’s ethnographer on this trip, and despite spending only a few days at Port Stewart, he and expedition leader Herbert Hale recognised Aboriginal people camped in the bed of the Stewart River as having diverse clan estate, language and genealogical relationships. A vast quantity of artefacts was collected and many still images and a small amount of moving image were taken. The latter collections, together with their written accounts and documentation, provide compelling testimony of the lives of those people who survived the violence and displacement of the nineteenth century colonial frontier in north Queensland. Over recent decades, the Lamalama have worked closely with the authors to access their cultural patrimony in museum collections, including making two trips to the SAM in 1997 and 2010. The aims of this paper, therefore, are to demonstrate the importance of engaging Indigenous people in a dialogue about their cultural patrimony in museums, such as may be found in the Norman B. Tindale Collection, consider Lamalama responses to the record created by Tindale and Hale and investigate the nature of Tindale’s archive and its continuing relevance to Lamalama people.\n\nThe Caribbean historian Dr Philip Sherlock posited that ‘There is no country called the West Indies … History and geography have combined in the Caribbean to make an island the symbol of national identity, a country whose frontiers were clearly marked out by the shoreline’ (Sherlock 1966, 7). The eponymous 1959 Federation Day Exhibition on Aspects of the History of the West Indies, designed by Dr Elsa Goveia, a young advocate/historian based at the department of history on the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies, was therefore expressly concerned to demonstrate the valid historical basis upon which a ‘Caribbean’ community and identity could be constructed out of the shared experience of historical dislocation, deculturation and disempowerment. She consciously sought opportunities to address public knowledge about issues of community and identity and, in her extensive Introduction to the 1959 exhibit, Goveia initiated the first consciously Anglophone Caribbean attempt at historical reconstruction as a form of identity-creation."
