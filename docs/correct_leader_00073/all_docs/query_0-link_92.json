        "text": "February 4th, 2022 / Nassau, The Bahamas\n\nLynden Pindling International Airport,\n\nNassau’s hub that connect you with the world\n\nBy Benjamin Gunst\n\nWhen it comes to deciding where to buy a property, I like to look at the city's airport connectivity. It is not the same being 3 hours away from Toronto as 7 hours away, plus doing a stressful layover in a random airport.\n\nGenerally known until 2006 as Nassau International Airport, The Lynden Pindling International Airport has good connectivity to major North American and Caribbean cities. It also connected to Central and South America via Panama City and Europe and the rest of the world via London-Heathrow direct flights from two renowned airlines.\n\nRegular non-stop flights to North American cities include Toronto-Pearson, Charlotte, Philadelphia, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, New York-JFK, Newark, Boston, Washington-National, Baltimore and Cleveland. Many seasonal flights include Calgary, Montreal-Trudeau, Denver, Houston-Intercontinental, Austin, Dallas/Fort Worth, Washington-Dulles, New York-LaGuardia, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Detroit, and Chicago-O'Hare.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of the Nassau Airport is the Border Preclearance for the United States outbound flights.\n\nThis facility allows the United States Homeland Security officers to conduct a preclearance screening to outbound passengers before boarding the plane. That's beneficial for passengers arriving in the United States since they won't have to be screened again. The border preclearance facility meets TSA security standards; furthermore, those passengers doing a layover will have their baggage checked to their final destination from The Bahamas, saving precious time.\n\nThe preclearance facility also allows International flights to reach American airports that lack customs processing facilities, such as New York-LaGuardia and Washington-National Ronald Reagan.\n\nNassau's airport contains several rental car facilities and three different parking options: Short term, long-term and Park and Go. The Park and Go options allow busy business travellers who frequently travel to The Bahamas to park in the short-term facilities paying a flat rate.\n\nThe Bahamas changed the name of Nassau's airport in 2006 to honour The Right Honourable Sir Lynden Pindling, the first Prime Minister after The Bahamian independence. Pindling is considered the Father of the Nation since he led the Bahamas through massive changes, including the transition from a British colony to independence in 1973.\n\nThe airport is full of Bahamian artwork to reflect local vibes, including the architecture of the airport's roofline reminiscent of an ocean wave. One of the most outstanding pieces of art is Taking Flight, which features 84 life-sized flamingos in the flock across the walls of the Departures section of both Domestic and International Terminals.\n\nIf you are considering visiting or moving to The Bahamas, you can make sure that your first impression of the country will be fantastic.\n\nBenjamin Gunst is a high-net-worth wealth management advisor with over 19 years of experience in Europe, Canada and the Caribbean. He is the Chief Financial Officer of Westend Nassau\n\nShare"
