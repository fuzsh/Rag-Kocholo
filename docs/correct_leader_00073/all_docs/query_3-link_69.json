        "text": "For those of you that think that this next election will be an easy one and that the obvious ineptness and downright ignorance on daily display by the governing Free National Movement should be enough for the Opposition to become government think again. I was sitting in my office the other day having a conversation with a client about politics and another client walked in and asked our persuasion, we told him we were PLP supporters. He then said to us as boldly as the sun shines at noon, “I am an FNM and I usually vote for the FNM, but I cannot support them this time. But don’t think that it will be a cake walk for the PLP either.”\n\nThe government of the Bahamas headed by Hubert Ingraham has been the most dreadful lot in a long while; I think it is the worst administration that he has ever headed. Now you have people that will make and excuse for everything that the government has done and to that I say there is no excuse for corruption and or stupidity whichever one that the government wants to own up to because it must one or the other or even both at work in the Bahamas. The Ingraham Administration came into office in 2007 with the chain saw attitude that they will cut, dismiss and destroy everything that they could not claim as theirs. The latest cut was the Bahamas Telecommunications Company.\n\nIn what must be labeled the worst deal in the history of the modern Bahamas commercially and administratively the government of the Bahamas divested the people of the Bahamas of 51% of BTC. We have gone over the stupidity of the deal so I will not go there again but the latest scandal that the Prime Minister deemed a “hiccup” was the licensing agreement in the Hawksbill Creek Agreement which if I am not wrong Hubert Ingraham himself agreed to. The Agreement gives the Grand Bahama Port Authority the authority to grant licenses for telecoms in Freeport for which BTC had been paying a license fee. Despite no public announcement on whether the government of the Bahamas and the GBPA had reached an agreement the deal with Cable and Wireless was signed.\n\nNow after months of trying to find the right words that would resonate with the Bahamian people the official Opposition promised to have a “public inquiry” and to regain control of BTC for Bahamians. To this the Prime Minister stated, “They said they would like to have an investigation into CWC. You know, I don’t have difficulty with that. I just have not been able to justify in my mind yet how I’m going to justify taking your scarce dollars to have it. But if I change my mind, I’ll have an investigation into CWC and BTC, and BTC and Bluewater all at the same time. And if an investigation ever comes at any time, on any subject, and I am called to testify, if you see me carry a lawyer with me, lose all faith in me. I don’t need a lawyer to tell the truth. I can speak for myself, anytime, any day.” These words to me are those of a man that knows that he has been cornered. Considering that this is the same man that found the money to have a Commission of Inquiry on Sir Lynden Pindling with the scarce resources of the Bahamian people. Mr. Ingraham also told FNMs that, “there will be no hand in the cookie jar when BTC is sold to the Cable and Wireless Company. It sometimes amazes how gullible Mr. Ingraham thinks the Bahamian people are, the proceeds from the sale are not in question as yet. In question are the conflicts of interests and inconsistencies before and during the negotiations of the sale. At question is how Cable & Wireless employees obtained strategic and very important positions in government agencies and BTC in advance of the sale. At question is how Cable & Wireless got to the table in the first place. Whether the findings of the inquiry are that Hubert Ingraham is corrupt or just plain stupid there MUST BE A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY into the sale of BTC to Cable & Wireless. There cannot be an excuse good enough to justify not having an inquiry.\n\nAnother thing happened during the sale of BTC debacle and that is the resignation of one Branville McCartney from the Free National Movement. A while back I wrote an article stating that I thought Mr. McCartney was “fake” and I am going to stand by those words. However, I will give him Kudos for resigning and seemingly on principle. What I have always found curious though is that in all of Mr. McCartney’s resignations he makes it a point to note that he has no animosity with the leadership of the FNM. He also seems to know how to resign in order to gain the most media attention. This last resignation came on the day that the BTC sale Debate began in the House of Assembly, the same day that a protest was being held on Bay Street against the sale. Mr. McCartney even walked through the protesters, to which he got lots of cheers from the crowd. HMMM, anyway the point is that he did resign. YAY HIM!!\n\nThere were rumors was the he was to have taken others with him when he went but I don’t advise that he surround himself cowards and dead weight that is something the insecure Mr. Ingraham does. What I find even more curious is how quiet and passive Hubert Ingraham has been on the subject publicly. He even held a public meeting in Bamboo Town to “apologize”, stating some nonsense about the FNM wanting Bamboo Town back. We all know that Mr. Ingraham will retain “Mr. Gerry Mander” to try deal with Branville McCartney and anyone else who opposes his FNM girly men.\n\nThe Official Opposition in all of this seems only to be able to speak in the House of Assembly and have not really put their finger on how to speak to the Bahamian people outside of the walls of parliament and outside of the bounds of speeches. While the Opposition did have a great showing during the BTC debate it was about two months late. The debate in the public arena took place without the PLP being a major factor even though they made press releases, held press conferences and supported the protests. There still seemed to be a disconnect between the PLP and the people because the Prime Minister was still able to spew nonsense in order to confuse the people concerning what really was taking place. The PLP should realize by now that this is a defining moment for them and that they MOST win this next election and it cannot be because of the amount of money spent or t-shirts distributed. The PLP must be able to give the Bahamian people HOPE again; they must win this election with a cause to advance and with the support of the majority of the Bahamian people because in my mind the next five to ten years will define the next generation and they must be saved from the likes of Hubert Ingraham. Twill not be easy but it must be done nonetheless."
