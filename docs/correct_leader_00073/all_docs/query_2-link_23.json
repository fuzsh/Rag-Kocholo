        "text": "Sir Lynden Oscar Pindling (21 March 1930 â€“ 26 August 2000), is thought to be the founder of the nation in the Bahamas. He served various jobs that helped the nation eventually gain its independence.[1]\n\nPindling was born in Nassau, Bahamas, in the British West Indies on March 21, 1929. He eventually graduated from King's College London where he earned a degree in law. He later married Marguerite McKenzie.\n\nIn 1954, Pindling helped found the Progressive Liberal Party in the Bahamas. This party was formed mainly to overthrow the white-run colonial United Bahamian Party. In 1967 he was elected Premier of the Bahamas Islands and worked to give the Bahamas independence. He became Prime Minister of an independent Bahamas in 1973 were he worked to stop heavy British influence in the country."
