        "text": "We are all in the “departure lounge.\" How true the statement is!\n\nNo matter how young we are; no matter how old we are; no matter how wealthy we are; no matter how poor we are; no matter how educated we are; no matter how politically connected we are; no matter how powerful we are; no matter how religious and holy we think we are; no matter what position we hold in this life; we are all in the “departure lounge in route to our final destination!”\n\nHowever, as we wait in the “departure lounge,” it is an immutable fact that we are getting older. As Parker J. Palmer writes in his most recent book On the Brink of Everything: Grace, Gravity, & Getting Old, “Age itself is no excuse to wade in the shallows. It’s reason to dive deep and take creative risks.” So dive in with me as I share with you my brief foray into frontline politics at an early age. As you do so, please note my admonition in the fourth paragraph.\n\n“Politics is... an activity... a complete activity, it is not simply the grasping for an ideal, for then the ideals of others may be threatened; but it is not pure self-interest either simply because the more realistically one construes the more one is involved in relationships with others... The more one is involved in relationships with others, the more conflicts of interest, or of character and circumstance, will arise. These conflicts, when personal, create the activity we call ethics... and such conflicts, when public, create political activity.” ~ Bernard Crick, In Defense of Politics [1982]\n\nThe last time that I share my foray into politics at a very young age, some narrow-minded and politically centric persons concluded that I wanted some reward. Others claimed that I was bitter. My wanting some reward or being bitter is far from the truth. History, when thoroughly researched and written, like facts is stubborn. In this regard, history is what it is. What is written here is an expression of my experience, and as such, it is for information only and not for debate. If those of you who read this are tempted to debate what is expressed, I say to you go and write about your experience and have it debated and questioned.\n\nI share this to make no claim from any political entity. What is presented here represents a season in my life, which has influenced my view of politics and politicians. In retrospect, I am all the wiser for the experience during my formative years. My experience has taught me to take politics as practised in The Bahamas with the proverbial “grain of salt.” The practitioners of politics, in The Bahamas, are fundamentally dishonest, but on the other hand, the electorate, for the most part, tends to know the truth, sees evidence of the truth, but still believes the lie. The electorate, by their action or inaction, has managed to by association has become fundamentally dishonest, and by that same association has disenfranchised themselves by accepting the disregard of their collective voices and wishes.\n\nBernard Crick, in his book, In Defense of Politics opined, “There are two great enemies of politics: indifference to human suffering and the passionate quest for certainty in matters, which are essentially political. Indifference to human suffering discredits free regimes which are unable, or which fear, to extend the habits and possibility of freedom from the few to the many. The quest for certainty scorns the political virtues - of prudence, of conciliation, of compromise, of variety, of adaptability, of liveliness - in favour of pseudo-science of government, some absolute-sounding ethics, or some ideology, some world-picture in terms of either race or economics... A free government is one, which makes decisions politically, not ideologically.”\n\nI have always had a keen, academic, practical and abiding interest in history and politics, because both of these subjects are intertwined. I appreciate politics, because I have a keen sense of history. Couple this with the fact that I would have lived most of what has been written about modern Bahamian politics, from 1956 to the present. This period covers in excess of fifty years. It is only natural, then, that I am chronicling my introduction and involvement in frontline politics.\n\nAs a boy of 10 years of age, I witnessed the response of the Bahamian people, in the Southern District of New Providence, to the election of the first Progressive Liberal Party’s candidates in 1956. Despite the admonition of my mother, I ventured into the streets of New Providence, to witness for myself, the effects of the General Strike of 1958.\n\nThe events of 1956 and 1958 were indelibly etched on my young and impressionable mind. I knew at that tender age, that something significant was happening. I knew the events of 1956 and 1958 would have a profound effect upon the future of the Bahamas and its entire people, especially the black masses.\n\nBy the time the General Election was called in 1962, I was a student at Eastern Senior Secondary School. In that same year the Women’s Suffrage Movement, headed by Dr. Doris Johnson, sponsored an essay competition for high school students. The topic of the essay competition was “The Role of Women in The Bahamas.” I entered and won won the essay competition, but I never received the prize. Maybe, in retrospect, my not receiving the prize was a premonition of things to come, but in my youthful exuberance, I did not have the wisdom to see the connection between what happened then and what was to occur in later years.\n\nAs the election campaign heated up, the Progressive Liberal Party invited me, to read my essay at a rally at Windsor Park. I attended the rally and read my essay. After reading the essay, I began to speak extemporaneously about the pressing issues of that confronted the masses of Bahamians. Before leaving the rally, I was invited to speak at other rallies because it was felt that I was an asset to the Progressive Liberal Party. I accepted the invitation despite the ridicule from my neighbours, some of my classmates, and the intimidation of the headmaster of my school.\n\nI was the first student, in the political history of The Bahamas to actively campaign for a major political party. As a sixteen-year-old student, I actively campaigned for the Progressive Liberal Party and spoke at many of its rallies in 1962. These activities were done much to the chagrin and ridicule of my neighbours, who for the most part, saw me as a bare feet little boy. The Headmaster [Principal] of my high school [Eastern Senior] that I attended called me into his office, interrogated me, and tried to intimidate me. However, I persisted, because I knew the cause was a just one. It should be noted that most of my neighbours and the Principal of my high school, at this time, were ardent supporters of the United Bahamian Party.\n\nKeep in mind that my involvement, with the Progressive Liberal Party, was at a time when adults were afraid to openly show their support for this political entity which presented a real threat to the United Bahamian Party. Anyone who was involved with the Progressive Liberal Party was in clear and present danger.\n\nI did not attend the rally the night following my debut the previous evening. I remember being told by some of my neighbours that Mr. Pindling [later Sir Lynden Pindling], had called for me, and when it was discovered that I was not there, he said how impressed with my speaking skills. Mr. Pindling vowed to make me a politician within ten years [of 1962]. If my calculations are correct, I should have been in Parliament by the age of twenty-six [in 1972].\n\nHad Mr. Pindling kept his promise, I would have been the youngest politician in the modern political history of the Bahamas. I guess this was one of those classic cases where a promise was made to be broken. In this regard, one can say that Sir Lynden was a typical politician. I do recall meeting Mr. Pindling in the early 1980s, at a reception. I reminded him of that promise; he chuckled, and said, “I guess we missed each other somewhere along the way.”\n\nThere is always a higher being to guides and guards our paths in life. Being older and wiser, all I can say to God be the glory that I was spared through HIS grace and mercy of having to kowtow to the political puppeteers. Please do not get me wrong because as a young man, I admired and respected the political prowess of the first Prime Minister of The Bahamas. The truth be told, like us mere mortals, Mr. Pindling had his feet of clay.\n\nWhen the Progressive Liberal Party lost the election in 1962, former Deputy Prime Minister, Arthur D. Hanna, came to my neighbourhood in Kemp Road to apologize to me, because, as he put it, I had campaigned so hard. How honoured and thrilled I felt!\n\nI have fond memories, of the fervour of Mae Mortimer, a staunch supporter of the Progressive Liberal Party, who saw a great future for me in politics. In fact, Mae Mortimer was so ambitious for me, that she even envisioned me on “Government Hill” presumably in some important capacity or the other. However, alas, this was not to be!\n\nDuring the period 1964 – 1966, Philip Smith [later Member of Parliament for North End Long Island, Rum Cay and San Salvador], Robert Lightbourne, Reuben Cooper, Jr. and I were responsible for the formation of the Bahamas Youth For Positive Action [BYPA]. The BYPA was the forerunner of the Progressive Young Liberals.\n\nI rejoiced in the streets, with thousands of Bahamians, in the aftermath of the 1967 and 1968 election results, because we all felt that a new day had dawned for all Bahamians, particularly Black Bahamians. It was also a new day for White Bahamians because their future was secured through the “liberation” of the Black Masses. The reality was as Martin Luther King said, \"Live together as brothers (and sisters) or perish together as fools.\" I was as proud as any Bahamian could be about the attainment of independence by The Bahamas in 1973.\n\nDespite my efforts on behalf of the Progressive Liberal Party, my final reward was to suffer from the politics of vengeance. According to Bernard Crick, author of In Defence of Politics, “A politics of vengeance is not politics. Revenge is a recklessness towards the future in a vain attempt to make the present abolish a suffering which is already past.”\n\nTo be politically victimized [in 1977] by the very same party whose cause I had championed was devastating. The very same politician, who had vowed to make me a politician, was the chief architect of the victimization that was perpetrated against me.\n\nDespite suffering as a consequence of the perpetration of the politics of vengeance, I hold firmly to the biblical admonition found in Deuteronomy 32:35 that states, “Vengeance is Mine, and recompense; their foot shall slip in due time; for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things to come hasten upon them.” In retrospect, I can truly say to God be the glory for His deliverance. Despite God’s deliverance, this, of course, not to say that what was done to me was not fundamentally unfair.\n\nWhen all is said and done the period 1942 to 1973, with perhaps a few exceptions, was a glorious period in Bahamian history in general and Bahamian political history in particular. The leadership of Sir Lynden Pindling was just what was needed to give the politically, economic, and socially dispossessed hope for the future. I say hope because that it was what it was; that is what it has become; and that is what it has remained to this day. Sir Lynden was, indeed, the man for the time period to which I referred. Suffice it to say that the glory days that were promised and were to come have been elusive and for the vast majority of Bahamians remains just that…illusive.\n\nSome “things” went drastically and terribly wrong after independence. Whatever those “things” that went wrong were, they were and are etched in the minds of the main political players of the time. Unless there is a miracle, those “things” that went wrong will remain buried with those who have gone before us and if not told, will go to the grave with those who remain, and we will and can only guess what those things are…Thus we may never know that which change the trajectory of The Bahamas and its people….I played my part, and my conscience is clear."
