        "text": "More and more these weeks and months leading up to the coming general elections are being described in various quarters as the “silly season”.\n\nThat is meant, presumably, that the players in the ongoing political debate are prone to saying things they would not ordinarily say, making charges and laying blames they know could never be substantiated, and generally entering into exchanges which are frivolous and sometimes asinine when there are genuine and pressing issues crying out for sensible argument.\n\nTo a degree, perhaps all that is fine, providing as it does a kind of comic relief – as Shakespeare often insinuated in his tragedies – in between the heavy sessions concentrating on the planks of the manifestos of the various contending political organisations.\n\nPoliticians of all shades are often fascinated by large crowds, particularly crowds of their own known supporters, and the more the crowd applauds and wave pom-poms and and yell for more, the more the speaker heaps on what often is largely and perhaps essentially bull, with some of them actually dancing to the music.\n\nAll that has become part of the silly season, when the chief objective is to impress the electorate to the extent that on election day the people will respond by voting for the most impressive party or individual.\n\nAlready, even before there is an indication of whether election day will be weeks or months away, the remarks of vitriol and vituperation have begun flying fast and to an extent furiously, with parties charging against one another with political ferocity.\n\nOf course the insinuation of the Democratic National Alliance into the fray has tended to make a difference in the ongoing tenor of the debate, but that has only added a third dimension to what in this season, for a good part of the electorate, is reduced to little more than confusion.\n\nUp through the years there have been incidents during campaigns which may have been considered ridiculous or laughable, but which, at the end of the day, have actually helped to dull the sharp edge of the constant contention.\n\nWHITE FILE . . . 2\n\nBack in 1946, for example, when the late Sir Henry Taylor tested the political waters for the first time, he encountered a variety of situations on the campaign trail which were alternately hilarious and heart-breaking.\n\nTaylor, who seven years later was to become one of the three founders of the Progressive Liberal Party, had offered as a candidate for his native Long Island in a a bye-election necessitated by the resignation from the House of Assembly of the representative, Guilbert Dupuch.\n\nTaylor was virtually penniless at the time, and in fact had to search around for the fifty pounds for his nomination fee. Yet this penniless man, who years later would become the third governor general of the Bahamas, had the gall to boast that he would not pay a penny for a vote.\n\nHis opponent in the face was Alexander Knowles, a successful farmer whose son, James, would one day represent Long Island in the House an serve as a cabinet minister in the Free National Movement government.\n\nIt was a rough campaign for the penniless Henry Taylor, but he roughed it and toughed it against a strong and well heeled adversary, some of whose campaign generals began spreading the word that Taylor was a heavy drinker and therefore not fit to sit in the House of Assembly.\n\nOne night when he was speaking during a campaign meeting in Glinton’s in the north of the island, when he knew that a cousin of Alexander Knowles was in the audience. He told the crowd that he was well aware of the accusations that he was a drunkard.\n\n“I am not a drunkard,” he said, “but I have been talking to you for the last hour, and my throat is dry. Have any of you gentlemen in he audience a bottle in your pocket? Please bring it to the platform that that I can relieve my thirst.”\n\nSeveral bottles were brought up, and Taylor took a sip from each.\n\n“Now, gentlemen, if any of you do not drink, I want you to vote for the teetotaler, Mr, Alexander Knowles. Those of you that drink, please vote for me. I guarantee that I will beat him.”\n\nHenry Taylor lost that election, but went on the win the seat in the general election of 1949.\n\nWHITE FILE . . . 3\n\nSometimes the silly season turned tragic, as during the campaign for the fateful 1972 general election, the first in which the then infant Free National Movement was a contender.\n\nThe body of an FNM supporter and campaign worker, Barry Major from Grant’s Town, was murdered in Perpall Tract. There was an extended investigation, and his killers were eventually executed.\n\nThen there were those incidents in the 1956 general elections which cold hardly have altered the outcome of that poll, but which were learning trees. The PLP had been established in 1953, and offered a full slate of 29 candidates in New Providence and the Out Islands.\n\nOne of those incidents involved the West End seat in Grand Bahama where the party’s candidate went missing on nomination day, and so he Bay Street candidate won the seat by acclamation. One report was that the PLP’s man had been “detained” in South Florida and couldn’t get back in time.\n\nAnother story was that he had received a handsome gift of several hundred pounds, via Bay Street, not to nominate.\n\nThen there was the election in Acklins and Crooked Island, where the PLP’s candidate was young A. Loftus Roker.\n\nThe PLP had won four seats in New Providence, and one of the victors, Randol Fawkes, was traveling by mailboat to Crooked Island to assist the young candidate during the last days of the campaign there.\n\nApparently on that trip Roker revealed to Randol Fawkes that he, Loftus, was not quite 21, the legal voting age, which also meant the legal age for nominating to run for a seat.\n\nThe late Eugene Dupuch won the seat, and it was said that through the discretion of Kendal G.L. Isaacs, who was then Solicitor General, that legal action was not taken against Loftus Roker, who in later years was elected to the House of Assembly and served in several cabinet posts in the PLP government.\n\nMost likely general elections this year will not take place until somewhat nearer the summer, and so the silly season will have to be endured for some time yet. The angry exchanges will continue, with even close friends or relatives lashing out in political anger, most of which will be regretted when the elections are over.\n\nWHITE FILE . . . 4\n\nIn the meantime, the season must be endured, and Bahamians might find some solace in the story of an eastern monarch who had seen and done just about everything and, bored, he summoned some of his wisest advisors and ask them to go and search for an expression that would bring him hope.\n\nThey searched diligently, and after a time returned to the monarch and handed him a parchment on which they had written, “And this too shall pass away.”\n\nSo it shall. So it shall.\n\n(For The Punch – Issue 12 January 2012)\n\nIn each community, in New Providence and no doubt in the Family Islands, there has always existed a mainstream circle of male friends who come together at no designed, agreed or specified time to share memories of what used to be and what has transpired as a result, and to hold forth on the present passing scene.\n\nThey have traditionally been of diverse political and religious persuasions, mostly older men who have passed through several generations and have experienced all the changing scenes of life in The Bahamas, stretching far before the coming of majority rule in 1967.\n\nWhen one passes there is a void, a vacuum, a terrible dent in the fabric of the fraternity, but the group moves on in a kind of wordless understanding that they have indeed over the years become a peculiar group.\n\nThis is about Kenneth Aaron Seymour, part of a Grant’s Town group of sporting,game-playing enthusiasts, who passed away last December. But let us first delve into the nature of such groups in Grant’s Town through the generations.\n\nMost weekday afternoons down Blue Hill Road under an ageless seagrape tree, there has for years existed an interesting convention of older Bahamian men engaged in a hotly contested game of dominos.\n\nThe tree, located immediately south of Rodgers Corner, has a network of leaves so thick that residents underneath could easily withstand medium rainfall, especially when it came at a critical juncture of the game when quitting was beyond the thinking of any of the challengers, or the ever-present audience hovering.\n\nAmong the group of players there is a steady contingent of locals – older gentlemen who reside in the general Grant’s Town or Bain Town area, and who obviously find delight in spending leisure time in the company of old friends, playing or observing, and often engaging in casual conversation about the passing scene or the trend of current activities.\n\nFrom time to time the group is joined by game-playing zealots from outside the immediate community but who for years have added refreshing colour and challenge to the gathering. enthusiasts\n\nThese have included such as the Rev. Addison Turnquest, the unconventional Anglican priest some referred to as the Ayatollah, who, interestingly and obviously with the sanction of the late Anglican bishop Michael Eldon, contested a seat for the Free National Movement in the 1982 general elections.\n\nAnother fierce regular contender is attorney Sir Cyril Fountain, who once served as the Member of Parliament for North Long Island, then went on to become a justice of the Supreme Court. He ended up as Supreme Court Justice.\n\nOver the years the gathering has been a sort of continuation of traditional male camaraderie in historic Grant’s Town. Back in the 1940s and 1950s, when the late MP Spurgeon Bethel operated Neely’s Bar at Rodgers Corner and Blue Hill Road, men used to gather to play Awari* and discuss the leading topics of the day.\n\nEven more celebrated than that was the traditional gathering of men, led by the late, prolific undertaker Gerald Dean, playing Awari, dominos and checkers outside the Cotton Tree Bar farther up Blue Hill Road opposite the Southern Recreation Grounds.\n\nOf historic interest is the fact that it was there at the front of the Cotton Tree Bar back in June 1942, as the Burma Road riot was bubbling, that the Provost Marshall officially read the Riot Act, declaring a dusk to dawn curfew.\n\nOf course the centrepiece of that Grant’s Town male comradeship was the great silk cotton tree which was located on the eastern side of Blue Hill Road between Lewis and Cameron Streets, a half block south of St. Agnes Church, with its sprawling roots extending to the middle of the road, so that at that point traffic often became one-way.\n\nThere especially on Sunday mornings the men gathered to have their shoes shined by the legendary Ralph and his small team of workers. There the men, some of them leading professionals inside and beyond the community, debated the large and fatal issues.\n\nThe men, just about all of them now passed into eternity, included such as Members of the House of Assembly Bert Cambridge and Dr. C.R. Walker, Gerald Dean, Robert Turnquest, Spurgeon Bethel, Booze Rodgers, Big Hutch, Earl “Bing” Cambridge, Randol Fawkes, Jim Russell, and on occasion the quite knowing and loquacious Dr. Cleveland Eneas.\n\nSometimes they debated well past noon, when the bell at St. Agnes would begin pealing, announcing the termination of the 10.30 a.m. Service, and it was not unusual for the church’s rector, Canon Milton Cooper, in his flowing black robe, to venture over to catch a piece of the action.\n\nThat had been the nature of Grant’s Town up through the years, where the men, their day’s work finished, would often gather for a game, for hearty argument and chatter, and, most of them, for a little of what St. Paul noted was good for the stomach’s sake.\n\nIt yet continues today under the seagrape tree, even though, from time to time, a member of that venerable band slips away forever.\n\nThat happened on 16 December last year, when Kenneth Aaron Seymour, who seemed always to light up all of Grant’s town, slipped into eternity following a bout with cancer. On 22 December, a handful of days before Christmas, his funeral services were held at his home Church of St. Mary the Virgin. .\n\nHe had been born in Cat Island in 1931, and at his homegoing service the sermon was delivered by the Rev. Canon Warren Rolle, a fellow Cat Islander, who had served as rector of St. Mary’s until 2007.\n\nA proud product of the old Government High School in Nassau Court, Kenneth Seymour, long called “Hoolie” by his friends, was one of those articulate Bahamians who, from boyhood, read voraciously, and in later years enjoyed watching films of worth and value.\n\nIt was no doubt he spoke with a stentorian tongue, his tenor and diction rising and falling according to the statement or the message it was his intent to convey. In that regard he often reminded one of classical educators like Rosalie “Rosa” Smith, Mildred Dillette, and headmaster Theodore Glover.\n\nIt was no wonder that in the late 1940s and early 1950s he became keenly interested in plays written by then John Taylor, who had grown up in St. Mary’s Church. He began assisting in the stage work of the performances, which took place usually in St. Benedict’s Hall on the grounds of The Priory on West Street.\n\nThose were John Taylor’s productions of such as “Man with Maid”, “Gaolbird”, “Columbus”. and “O, Absolom”, and the main players were usually Calvin Cooper, Matthew Sawyer, Gertrude Gibson, and Sylvia Coakley.\n\nEventually John Taylor went off to New York to study, especially theatre, at Columbia University. However he switched to Theology instead, and was eventually ordained as a deacon and then a priest in the Episcopal Church.\n\nIn 1956 Fr. Taylor returned to The Bahamas, and eventually became a curate at St. Agnes Church in Grant’s Town, under Canon Milton Cooper. In 1958 he wrote a play,“The House on Calamity Street” for performance on the stage at St. Agnes Schoolroom. His carefully chosen cast included Kenneth Seymour, Edwin Archer, Frederica Turnquest, Gertrude Gibson, Cynthia Love, and The White Boy.\n\nYears later after Fr. Taylor had returned to the U.S. And served in several churches there, he again returned to The Bahamas, and was attached to St. Mary’s. Whilst he was there St. Agnes observed its 150th anniversary of Dedication, and the rector, Archdeacon William Thompson, requested Fr. Taylor to write an appropriate play to mark the occasion.\n\nThus came the historic work, “Agnes of Rome”, which Fr. Taylor personally directed. Among his chosen cast was his old standby, Kenneth Seymour. That was 1991 when Hoolie was 60 and still strutting his powerful stuff across the stage, which on that occasion was the Lower Gardens of Government House.\n\nOften in Grant’s Town when he was not playing dominos, Hoolie would chat happily abut the old days and the thrill of theatre. It was a thrill, he used to remind, second only to his service, wherever required, in the sanctuary of St. Mary’s Church, right up until last summer, even when his health was failing.\n\nToday in Grant’s Town, Hoolie is already missed as that exuberant, silver-haired fixture with the stentorian voice who enjoyed the company of his fellow Bahamians, who was once toasted as as outstanding thespian on he local stage, and who, for all his 80 years enjoyed every cycle of his colourful life.\n\nKenneth Aaron “Hoolie” Seymour was truly the stuff of which the real Bahamas is made . . . for what it’s worth.\n\n* AWARI: An abstract African game also known as the “African Bean Game”.\n\n“Awari is an ancient game originating from Africa which consists of 12 holes in the ground (called houses) split up into 2 rows of 6. Designed for two players, each player selects a row as their territory. Each house starts with 4 seeds in it.” READ MORE\n\n>> Read more about and PLAY ONLINE HERE\n\nFor The Punch – Issue 3 March 2011\n\nby P. Anthony White\n\nIn this or another space from time to time we recount the birth and development of the Progressive Liberal Party, starting in late 1953, as the beginning of the thrust of the Bahamian masses to that historic first general elections in 1956, majority rule in 1967, and eventually to full statehood in 1973.\n\nAt each stage there was a vibrant presence of democracy, and particularly following the birth and development of the Free National Movement, and organisation which, it could be said, sprang from the bowels of the PLP, the result of the ambitions of some further to test the buoyancy of that democracy.\n\nAnd so that birth, development of the FNM, a party which this year marks its 40th anniversary has evolved as an integral part of the modern history of The Bahamas, and Bahamians, especially the young, no matter what their political inclinations, have a right and a need to know.\n\nWhat should be of interest to historians is that the Free National Movement did not come about as the result of the gentle or simmering yearning huddled masses yearning to breathe free, but rather like the restless awakening of a passionate woman who refuses to remain blind when light is shimmering all around. Those would-be historians need to get the story right.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the events of 19 August 1992 – when the PLP government was toppled after nearly 26 years in office – became a powerful climax to a national political odyssey which began technically in the House of Assembly on 13 May 1970.\n\nThat was when the maverick Member of Parliament for the St. Barnabas constituency of New Providence, Randol Francis Fawkes, who has served as Minister of Labour and Commerce in the first PLP government, moved the following Resolution:\n\n“Whereas Government, by its failure to consult with investors prior to the passing of Legislation nullifying the effects of certain provisions of Government’s agreements with local and foreign businessmen has caused the economic dislocation of the resources of the Commonwealth.\n\n“AND WHEREAS moneys are being paid out to the Hon. Clifford Darling, the Minister of State, when unlike other Ministers no specific office of duties assigned to him are shown in the Bahamas Official Gazette.\n\n“BE IT RESOLVED, that this House has no confidence in the Government.”\n\nIt was at that point that the MP for Freetown, the late Simeon Bowe. Who was then a Parliamentary Secretary in the PLP government, moved that Mr. Fawkes’ Resolution be amended by deleting all the words of the Resolution and substituting, instead, the following:\n\n“Whereas this Government has a responsibility to the people of this Country to discharge its duty in their best interest and,\n\n“Whereas this Government is discharging such duties (and) has done so to the satisfaction of the people:\n\n“BE IT RESOLVED, that this House has confidence in the Government.”\n\nThe question was put and passed, and the record shows that the House resolved that the Resolution be amended as agreed..\n\nIt was a pivotal point in Bahamian political history, for it was then technically that black Bahamians were challenged publicly to support or vote against the black Bahamian government.\n\nSome Members were absent from the chamber when the matter was put. Of those present, staunch supporters of the government and the prime minister, Lynden Pindling, remained seated during the vote, suggesting their were voting their confidence.\n\nOf those who stood, indicating a lack of confidence, a majority were members of the then opposition United Bahamian Party. There were other members standing against the government, however, who were PLPs. Among them were the eight, including two cabinet ministers – Cecil Wallace-Whitfield and Dr. Curtis McMillan – who became known afterwards as the Dissident Eight.\n\nAt that time, the PLP government was barely three-and-a-half years old, but problems with the leadership had existed since the party’s convention of 1968, and indeed when Cecil Wallace Whitfield stood as one of those lacking confidence in the government and in the prime minister it was the second occasion upon which he had been openly and publicly defiant.\n\nYet Wallace Whitfield and Dr. Curtis McMillan remained in the PLP cabinet following that May 13 vote. Instead of any flickers of conciliation or mending of broken fences, the political chasm inside the PLP had widened.\n\nBy the PLP convention in October 1970 – five months after the no-confidence attempt – there were clear indications of a breaking point. Cecil Wallace-Whitfield, them the Member of Parliament for St. Agnes, was Minister of Education and Culture, and had performed admirably in that capacity, including new teaching concepts and learning, introducing revolutionary learning aids.\n\nPLP leader Lynden Pindling delivered the convention’s keynote address on the first day, and a volatile keynote it was indeed. Lashing out at his critics and obviously confident about the measure of his support in the party, he warned those who disagreed with him: “if you can’t fish, cut bait; if you can’t cut bail, get the hell out of the boat”.\n\nYes, as The Tribune’s Nicki Kelly wrote back then, it was a masterful speech by a master politician, and it contained just the ingredients, the challenge, the temptation for revolution inside the party. Cecil Wallace-Whitfield had been born a revolutionary.\n\nThe crowds cheered wildly, others quietly drank in the great challenge, and yet others sucked their teeth and strode from the convention hall at the Sheraton British Colonial Hotel.\n\nAs each convention night progressed, cabinet ministers, one after the other, reported on the activities of the relevant portfolios, setting out also what future plans there were. It was not until Thursday evening that the Minister of Education and Culture was scheduled to report to the convention.\n\nCecil Wallace Whitfield was already not a totally liked figure in the PLP by those who misunderstood or misread his thinking in standing up and daring the brilliant black prime minister, and especially in standing shoulder to shoulder with the white Bay Street MPs when they voted against the PLP government five months earlier.\n\nBut Cecil Wallace Whitfield had never planned to participate in any popularity contest at the time, or at any other time. He strode up the centre aisle of the convention toward the platform, whilst Coconut Grove MP Edmund Moxey played rousing music on the organ.\n\nThe minister presented an expansive and detailed report on his portfolio, reading in measured tones from neatly typed five-by-seven index cards. He finished his official report and shoved the pile of cards into his coat pocket. At the same time he extracted a second set of a few cards from another pocket. He looked around the hushed hall and the organ started to play. He turned deliberately to Edmund Moxey and said that he wanted no music.\n\nA few minutes before that the guards at Government House had opened the gates to admit a car in which rode Edwin “Vikey” Brown, and Ms. Beryl Pierce. One was a St. Agnes constituency general and the other the private secretary to Cecil Wallace Whitfield at the Ministry of Education.\n\nReading from his second set of cards, the Minister of Education told the convention that he had listened to all that had occurred during the week. He spoke of agreed principles which had sustained the PLP through the years, and about a philosophy and commonality of purpose which had brought the PLP to the seat of government, but which, he felt, had been violated.\n\nAll that he could not repudiate, he said, “no matter how grave my disillusionments”. Then, Cecil Wallace-Whitfield said, at 8 p.m. that evening he had had delivered to His Excellency the Governor his resignation from the Government of The Bahamas.\n\nHe then uttered what became his immortal epigram: “Free at last. Free at last. My soul is dancing!”.\n\nFrom the West End and Bimini delegation table near the front, MP Warren Levarity leapt to his feet shouting an anguished, “No, no. Not yet, Man!”\n\nOthers were screaming in disbelief whilst the greater numbers were shrieking in something akin to merriment. At his Kemp’s Bay constituency table, PLP leader Lynden Pindling sat quietly, unsmiling amidst the pandemonium swirling about the room.\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed Dr. McMillan resigned as Minister of Health, and Dr. Elwood Donaldson gave up his post as Sports Commissioner. The troops, led by the gallant eight who had stood in Parliament on 13 May that year, rallied, and before the end of 1970, a curious creature known as the Free PLP was on the scene.\n\nIt was the first necessary step from the PLP to the Free National Movement, and the historical revisionists, no matter where they stand politically, need to get it right.\n\nGet it right . . . for what it’s worth.\n\n(For The Punch – Issue 6 January 2011)\n\n“Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.” ~ OSCAR WILDE\n\nAs the old folks used to say at critical junctures, when there was a need to stern decisions that would bring about necessary change, “It’s separation time,” and in this new year, just begun, the Bahamian nation, and especially the youth, must be constantly schooled on the route the nation took to arrive at this stage.\n\nAlmost every day there are attempts – both clumsy attempts by the stupid and benighted or disingenuous attempts by the supercilious and self-serving – to twist history in this direction or the next. Yet the devil must be forced to remain forever a liar, and there are still those in the community who can remember, and who can from time to time ensure that he remains a liar.\n\nAnd so, let another history lesson begin.\n\nOf the original eight Progressive Liberal Party Parliamentarians who, in 1970, supported a vote of no-confidence in former prime minister the late Sir Lynden Pindling, four have passed into glory. These were Sir Cecil Wallace Whitfield, Dr. Curtis McMillan, and James Shepherd.\n\nThose yet alive include the present governor-general Sir Arthur Foulkes, former West End and Bimini MP Warren Levarity, former Freeport MP Maurice Moore, and Dr. Elwood Donaldson, who was first elected to the House of Assembly for the Killarney constituency of New Providence.\n\nEach of the eight “Dissidents” in addition to forming the nucleus of what was to become the Free National Movement, had his own private and political row to hoe, as it were, his own life’s story to tell, and most of those stories – such as Sir Arthur Foulkes’s to-hell-and-back tale – have brimmed with fascination.\n\nEvery now and then we encounter Dr. Edwood Donaldson, now in his seventies, who has long been off the political front line, but who today, four decades after his front line tour of duty which saw experiences of resignations, firings, protests, and caucuses, enjoys his own curious brand of exile.\n\nFew astute observers of the Bahamian political scene over the decades will deny that Dr. Donaldson was the very first of the established mavericks in The Bahamas, and although he may from time have been accused of being guilty of ill-timing, impetuosity, or even over-estimation, the record that he always spoke out first still remains unchallenged.\n\nElwood Donaldson, who was born and bred in Bain Town, returned to The Bahamas in the 1960s after completing medical studies at the University of Hawaii. He became formally aligned with the then opposition PLP, receiving that party’s nomination for Killarney in the 1967 polls, winning that election.\n\nThe story is well-known about how, when the votes were counted following those January 10th elections, the PLP had won 18 seats, and the governing United Bahamian Party also 18. There was work to be done.\n\nIt is little known that in addition to Randol Fawkes and three others who won their seats in that election, Elwood Donaldson was one of those approached by the UBP to throw his support their way, to help form another Bay Street government. The fact that he resisted the lucrative offers is not especially dramatic – so did all the others who were approached.\n\nEven before the PLP won the landslide in 1968, Donaldson was already speaking out against certain of those elements in the party which, he thought, needed correction and renovation. For example, he insisted, publicly, that the law which prevented Bahamians from gambling in the casinos was discriminatory.\n\nAfter the PLP took office as the government, it was not clear what was offered Dr. Donaldson in the way of cabinet portfolios, chairmanships, or parliamentary secretaryships, but he served, for a time, as Sports Commissioner. Many thought he accepted that position more out of an attitude of team cooperation than out of any real sense of love for the job.\n\nIn late 1968, when the late Cecil Wallace-Whitfield made his initial move against the Premier at the famous but little-remembered PLP Balmoral convention, Elwood Donaldson was in the thick of it.\n\nSome say that Dr. Donaldson was there, later that night, to help prepare Sir Lynden Pindling’s short address, which said that there had been a “genuine misunderstanding” between himself and the Minister of Education (Wallace-Whitfield).\n\nTwo years later, in 1970, when the dissident eight joined in the move against the prime minister on the floor of the House of Assembly, Donaldson was one of those who spoke most strongly – yet with proper respect – against the PLP leader. Only a few months before that he had led the way, during the PLP convention for the dissidents to voice their complaints against the leadership,\n\nTaking issue with the PLP leader’s suggestion that those who could not fish should cut bait or get the hell out of the boat, Elwood Donaldson no doubt set the tone of the attack, which subsequently saw Whitfield and D. Curtis McMillan resign as ministers, and James Shepherd resign as chairman of Bahamas Electricity Corporation.\n\nWhen the new Free National Movement was formed, following the Booby Rock-like shivering existence of the Free PLP, Elwood Donaldson emerged as the party’s first chairman, even though, from the break, he had publicly denounced the idea of any kind of joining up with the United Bahamian Party.\n\nThe FNM lost the 1972 general elections, badly, with every single one of the original Dissident Eight incumbents, including Dr. Elwood Donaldson, being vanquished. Donaldson was appointed an FNM senator. However, within a few weeks’ time he resigned from both the Senate and the FNM, apparently still uncomfortable with what he termed the “coupling” with Bay Street.\n\nFor years Dr. Donaldson existed, politically, unconnected, and he remained in that state of political limbo, although he admitted back than that he “will move when the time is right,” whatever that indicated.\n\nAs time passed, it seemed Elwood Donaldson held the view that he could not support Lynden Pindling and the PLP, but neither was he prepared to follow Cecil Wallace Whitfield, entertaining an attitude that he could never be content in saying, as some back then did, that “anything is better than the PLP.”\n\nExpanding, he was reported at the time as saying that “if you replace one leaky pipe with another leaky pipe, what, really, have you done?”\n\nIt used to be an utter and joyous education sitting and listening to Elwood Donaldson, a young but renaissance man, as he held forth eloquently on this subject and the next, his head forever tilted to one side, and you came away with the impression that he was once an even younger man filled with passion and anger, and, drawing near his furtive forties, that passion and anger had coalesced into a burning philosophy.\n\nTen years after Elwood Donaldson’s first fierce foray onto the rigid range of Bahamian front line politics – back in the mid to late seventies – some who may have been viewed him as once who had gained great experience during that devilish decade. Yet Oscar Wilde once noted near the turn of the 20th century that “experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes”.\n\nIf Donaldson, a brilliant if somewhat eccentric Bahamian professional, was indeed thought to have been guilty of mistakes during those first critical years beginning with his election in 1967, then without doubt the biggest of those would have been to drop, suddenly and unceremoniously from the Bahamian front line political scene.\n\nOf course his reasoning might understandably have been that that scene – as in some many ways it remains all round today – was too profusely peopled with the traditional fickle, fanatical, and fortune-hunting four-flushers who own, if nothing else, a say in the supreme political board rooms, and, alas, a vote.\n\nDr. Elwood Donaldson, who is, in his way, still a very voluble and vibrant part of the present passing scene, has always been socialist by nature, and his other mistake may have been attempting the application of that theory to a Bahamian situation where there were others, with more money and more power who did not want to be so, at least not at that time.\n\nToday Elwood Donaldson, although still far from the madding crowd of front line politics, is far from any kine of relic. Today he is an even more seasoned renaissance man. If one observes carefully, that old fire in his belly which on so many occasions in the past caused him to stroke out, is now re-directed, but hardly simmered.\n\nHe was the very first of the political mavericks of the land, who didn’t give a damn if he way damned for saying his piece against friend and foe alike, and whose whole frank and fearless contribution to the advancement of democracy, made a whole and mighty difference to what is today the new Bahamas.\n\nHistory is all, and the people, especially the young, should know . . . for what it’s worth."
