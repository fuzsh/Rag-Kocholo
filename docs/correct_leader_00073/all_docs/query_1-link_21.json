        "text": "What form of currency does The Bahamas use?\n\nThe Bahamian dollar is maintained at the same level as the U.S. dollar and both are accepted interchangeably on all islands.\n\nATMs + PLUS and Cirrus are in banks on Nassau/Paradise Island, Grand Bahama Island, and most major Out Islands.\n\nWhile certain places do take credit cards, it’s advised that you carry cash if you’re exploring the Out Islands.\n\nWhat should I pack?\n\nCasual summer wear can be worn during the day at any time of the year, but be sure to bring a jacket or sweater for the cooler evenings from December to February. Most hotels, restaurants, and casinos require jackets for men at night, especially in more cosmopolitan areas, such as Nassau & Paradise Island and Freeport.\n\nBeachwear is inappropriate in churches, restaurants, and casinos. Away from the beach or the pool, you should cover your swimsuit with shorts or a long shirt when walking city streets. In more relaxed and remote areas, the dress code is more flexible.\n\nWill my mobile phone work in The Bahamas?\n\nVisitors and business travellers will find that telecommunication services in The Bahamas are comparable to the services found in most developed countries. A 100% digital switching system allows direct dialing to more than 100 countries. The U.S. and Canada are accessible via a direct call and most hotels offer direct dialing.\n\nBTC also has roaming agreements with 128 companies around the world. To access BTC's GSM roaming system, simply turn on your phone and wait for it to connect to the network. To check if your home service provider is a BTC roaming partner or for country-specific roaming charges, see btcbahamas.com.\n\nWhat are the rules of the road in The Bahamas?\n\nUK rules apply in The Bahamas, so please drive on the left and be very careful on the roundabouts. Visitors can use their residence permit for up to three months and may also apply for an international driving licence.\n\nTo learn more about the road traffic laws, visit www.roadtraffic.gov.bs.\n\nWill I need a voltage converter in The Bahamas?\n\nElectrical outlets in The Bahamas are 60 cycles/120 volts, which is compatible with all American devices. British and European appliances require a two-pin flat adapter and a 220-volt converter.\n\nCan I bring my pet to The Bahamas?\n\nYes, you can bring your pet to The Bahamas, but you must prepare before you leave home. An import permit is required from the Ministry of Agriculture and Marine Resources (Nassau) for all animals brought into the country. The permit is valid for one year from the date of issue.\n\nFollow the links below for important information on importing pets and to download the pet import form:\n\nBringing Pets to The Bahamas\n\nApplication to Import Domestic Animals\n\nThe Bahamas Humane Society\n\nAnimal Import Requirements\n\nApplication For CITES Import/Export\n\nApplication To Import CITES Plants (Orchids)\n\nApplication To Import Freshwater Fish\n\nWhen is Spring Break in The Bahamas?\n\nSpring Break Season in The Bahamas runs from late February to mid-April.
