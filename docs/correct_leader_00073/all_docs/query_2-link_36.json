        "text": "When you’re embarrassed to have visitors in your home, it might be time to clean up. When your home is the national airport, and visitors are your number one source of income, it’s time for a redesign.\n\nThe original Nassau airport building dated back to pre-World War II, and piecemeal updates had left a hodgepodge of uncoordinated add-ons to an aging base.\n\nWhen Stantec arrived, the challenge wasn’t simply designing an efficient and attractive airport, but also finding a way to keep the old terminal functioning until the new one was ready to take over the vital flow of tourists. This phased approach, known as staging, meant constructing pieces of the project one at a time while progressively decommissioning parts of the older structure, all the while keeping the airport operational. Our deep understanding of airport operations was essential in staging an airport project of this size correctly (14 gates when complete).\n\nIn the new facility, passengers will enjoy beautiful gardens complete with cascading waterfalls, local artwork and, unique for an airport, an outdoor roof deck for casual dining.\n\nIt’s time to have some people over."
