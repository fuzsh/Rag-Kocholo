        "text": "Lynden Pindling\n\nprime minister of The Bahamas\n\nIn full:\n\nSir Lynden Oscar Pindling\n\nBorn:\n\nMarch 22, 1930, Nassau, Bahamas, British West Indies\n\nDied:\n\nAugust 26, 2000, Nassau, Bahamas (aged 70)\n\nLynden Pindling (born March 22, 1930, Nassau, Bahamas, British West Indies—died August 26, 2000, Nassau, Bahamas) was a Bahamian politician who, as prime minister (1967–92), guided the Bahamas to independence in 1973 and was considered the country’s founding father.\n\nPindling studied at the Bahamas Government High School (1943–46) and at King’s College, University of London (1948–52), from which he received a law degree. He was called to the British bar in 1953 and soon after returned home to practice law. Later that year he helped found the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), which represented the interests of the black community in the Bahamas. He became party treasurer and was chosen parliamentary leader soon after being elected to parliament in the 1956 general elections. In 1967 he became the Bahamas’ first black prime minister and six years later oversaw the country’s independence from Britain. Known to his supporters as the “Black Moses,” Pindling steered The Bahamas through long years of burgeoning tourism and economic growth and won reelection five times (1968, 1972, 1977, 1982, and 1987). His tenure ended when he and the PLP were defeated in the 1992 general elections amid economic decline and unproven accusations of official corruption and of taking bribes from illegal drug traffickers. In 1997 he resigned as leader of the opposition and retired from politics. Pindling was knighted in 1983.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
