However local rules, flag systems, currents and where swimming may be permitted, can be different and vary from country to country. Snorkel vests, Life Jackets and Diver Down flags are all available on board.\n\nChildren\n\nTalk to children about water safety at the start of a vacation, making them aware of the potential dangers.\n\nAccidents can happen at any time on vacation, but often they happen on the first and last day, so keep watch and do not get distracted when your children are playing by, or in the water.\n\nChildren in or near water should always be supervised by an adult and never left unattended. Keep an eye on them and do not get distracted in and around the water.\n\nGet in the water with them, it is easier to keep an eye on them as well as good fun. Floatation devices are highly recommended for children but are not a substitute for supervision.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings\n\nCheck warning flags and signage on the beach and only swim where it is permitted.\n\nBeware of dangerous currents, these can be very powerful. Not all beaches have lifeguards and/or warning flags.\n\nBeware of underwater hazards, such as reefs, rocks, sudden changes in depth and marine life. Although shark attacks in the Bahamas are very rare the Bahamian authorities issued advice urging the public to exercise extreme caution in and around the waters of New Providence, adjacent islands, and cays.\n\nNever swim where a sign says not to e.g. in zoned areas for jet boats or jet skis.\n\nNever swim at night or after drinking alcohol.\n\nLook out for others\n\nNever swim alone, ‘buddy up’ with others in your party and use the snorkel vests provided.\n\nKnow how and where to get help. If you see someone in difficulty; raise the alarm, preferably the emergency services. Ensure you know the correct number for the country you are in.\n\nDo not overestimate your ability\n\nConsider swimming lessons before you go if you think it would be useful to learn proper swimming technique.\n\nEven if you regularly swim in a pool, remember that open water swimming can be very different.\n\nSafety\n\nAll yachts are equipped with adult life jackets, harnesses, snorkel vests & diver down flags. You can see all this equipment demonstrated in our online safety briefing, and we strongly recommend that you make use this equipment during your vacation. This safety equipment will be displayed in the saloon of your boat on boarding – If you have any questions feel free to ask our base staff during your briefing.\n\nWe have a very limited supply of children’s life jackets on base so highly recommend that if you are travelling with children, you bring their own. This ensures that children have correctly fitting jackets that are comfortable for them.\n\nChildren should not be allowed in the dinghy without a life jacket or buoyancy aid and should wear a buoyancy aid or harness whilst on deck.\n\nChildren under the age of 16 should not operate an outboard engine and should be supervised at all times when in the dinghy.\n\nTravel Insurance\n\nThe Moorings offers comprehensive travel insurance for your peace of mind.
