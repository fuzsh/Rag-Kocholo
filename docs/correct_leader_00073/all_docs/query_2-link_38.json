She has been very busy from the day she met and married Sir. Linden O. Pindling. Since then her life has been shared with the Bahamian nation and she is known as a humanitarian throughout The Bahamas, and as a member of a plethora of charities.\n\nShe became First Lady of our independent country in 1973.\n\nThroughout her time as First Lady, Lady Pindling gave her determined, energetic and loyal support to her family. Besides the devotion she showed to Sir Lynden and his political career, she undertook much charitable work, cared for her children, and became a Bahamian icon. She was honoured by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 2007, being named a Dame Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George.\n\nHer pride is/was to be a Bahamian. She would be likened to the African Sophia Lauren in her style and elegance and she has a natural ability to make anyone feel welcome and at home in her midst. Lady Pindling and her husband had a genuine natural gift of being open and approachable. They flowed freely.\n\nIt was so easy for our committee to determine that Dame Marguerite Pindling is one who undoubtedly, unequivocally and without question is deserving of being our Special Guest, and that for us is so meaningful. What she displays, what she recognizes, and most importantly, what she does as a humanitarian through charities such as The Red Cross, shows her compassion for helping within her country.\n\nOne cannot begin to pen the memoirs of our First Lady, Dame Marguerite Pindling without noting her desire to be the best role model; to take on such an irksome task of standing by Sir Linden Pindling in life and in death for the betterment of the Country of The Bahamas as a whole. She has brought many to our Bahamas, from the Queen in London, Prime Ministers and Presidents all around the world, never forgetting where it mattered most; and she found her greatest reception and adoration amongst the common man, the citizens of The Bahamas.\n\nLady Margaret Pindling is a brown skin complexion beautiful to looked upon Bahamian female from Long Bay Cays, Andros Island, who married a man Sir Lynden Oscar Pindling who was shorter in statute than she was. She became first Lady of an independent country in 1973 and unaware became the envy of many who did not see she was there as a protege of Bahamian Royalty. Dancing with Prince Phillip Of Great Britain seem fairytale and moving amongst aristocrats surely had its share of haters. Both she and her husband had the strong command of speech and with such intellectual skills which would have advanced the African race only to have those who were covetous of their appearance, performance blemish their character to a point of such destruction anyone who never had a chance to see elegance and royalty in the African- western flair would discover there were a few who recall the pride it was to be a Bahamian. She would be likened to the African Sophia Lauren in style and excellence. The ability to make anyone feel welcome and at home in their midst Lady Pindling and her husband had a genuine natural gift of being open and approachable where so many are fighting to fit in, they flowed freely. Dethroning Lady Pindling became a specious ploy and history will surely show that a Lady is always A LADY.\n\nLady Ingrid Darling Dame Marguerite Pindling\n\nDame Marguerite Pindling was born to Reuben and Viola McKenzie in the settlement of Long Bay Cays, South Andros, on 26 June 1932; she often describes herself as ‘just a barefoot girl from Andros’.\n\nMoving to Nassau in 1946, she lived with her sister Louise and attended the Western Senior School. After leaving school, her first job was with noted photographer Stanley Toogood. Later she worked for Colyn Rees and soon met Lynden Pindling, a London-trained lawyer. Following a courtship of a little over a year, they married on 5 May 1956. Shortly after the wedding Lynden Pindling was elected to the House of Assembly and would serve until 1997, when he retired after being elected nine consecutive times. In 1967 he became Premier and later Prime Minister, a post he held until 1992.\n\nDame Marguerite Pindling and Mrs. Bahamas 2010, Keldra Pinder.\n\nThroughout his term in office, Lady Pindling gave her husband her determined, energetic and loyal support. Besides the devotion she showed to Sir Lynden and his political career, she undertook much charitable work, cared for her children and became a Bahamian icon. She was honoured by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 2007, being named a Dame Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George.\n\nThe Pindlings had four children – Obi, Leslie, Michelle and Monique – and Dame Marguerite is now a proud grandmother of six."
