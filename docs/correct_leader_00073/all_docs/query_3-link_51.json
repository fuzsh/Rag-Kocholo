        "text": "Bahamian Sports Tourism icon and former league, high school and collegiate University of Houston Basketball shooting guard Cecil A. Rose, Jr. passed away Friday, December 27, 2013 at his Houston, Texas home. Cecil Rose “was arguably one of the greatest basketball players (the Bahamas) has ever produced” as stated in the Bahamas House of Assembly by Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture Dr. Daniel Johnson.\n\nA memorial service celebrating Rose’s life was held at 1pm, Saturday, January 4, at Windsor Village United Methodist Church, located at Kingdom Builders’ Center (6011 W. Orem, Houston, TX 77085). Bahamas Minister of Tourism Obediah Wilchcombe as well as Bahamas Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture Dr. Daniel Johnson brought remarks on behalf of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\n\nFuneral services were held in the Bahamas at 11 am, Saturday, January 11, at Salem Baptist Church (Taylor Street, Nassau). In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Cecil Rose’s name to the Cougar Pride Houston Athletic Scholarship Fund. (4800 Calhoun Rd., Houston, TX 77004).\n\nRose, who hailed from Nassau, Bahamas, was a member of the famous “Miami Jackson Five” which included Mychal Thompson. Rose became a legend of Florida high school basketball. During the early 1970s, Rose, Charles Thompson, Osborne Lockhart and Mychal Thompson revolutionized high school basketball in Florida at Miami Jackson High. He was the architect of a 33-0 perfect run, and his Jackson team remains legendary for its accomplishments with Rose leading the way along with his three fellow Bahamians.\n\nHe played for the Bahamas National Team at the 1977 Pan American Games, and was bestowed the national Bahamian honor Goodwill Basketball Ambassador by Bahamas Prime Minister Sir Lynden Oscar Pindling and Bahamas Minister of Sports Kendal Nottage.\n\nRose joined the University of Houston Cougars for the 1974-75 season and finished with four letters under legendary head coach Guy V. Lewis. He connected on 52.2 percent of his shots from the field during his collegiate career and scored 1,244 points, a total which continues to rank 23rd in school history.\n\nFrom 1974-78, Rose helped lead the Cougars to a 87-37 record with a berth in the NIT Championship Game in 1977 and an appearance in the NCAA Tournament First Round in 1978. As a senior in 1977-78, he averaged a career-high 17.6 points per game and was named to the All-Southwest Conference Second Team and NABC All-District 9 Third Team.\n\nFollowing his collegiate playing days, he was taken in the fifth round of the 1978 NBA Draft by the New Jersey Nets and played professionally for two years before returning to Houston as a graduate assistant coach for the 1980-81 season.\n\nMost recently, he was working in Houston, Texas. He served his native country for more than 30 years, promoting the Bahamas to the world as a representative of the Bahamas Tourist Office in Houston. His basketball connections at the highest levels, enabled him to be one of the biggest contributors in sports tourism to the Ministry of Tourism. Rose was also the catalyst for numerous annual visits to the Bahamas of the NBA Players Association. Prior to his death Cecil was in talks with the Ministry of Tourism as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs open to the possibility of filling an Honorary Consul General diplomatic post.\n\n“I will always remember Cecil’s passion for the game and his fierce competitiveness, and we became great friends,” said Houston great Otis Birdsong, who played with Rose from 1974 to 1977. “He was a great teammate and the kind of guy you wanted to go into battle with.”\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers go out to L.J., Lynden and the Rose family during this difficult time,” head coach James Dickey said. “Our University and our Men’s Basketball program are much better with the connection to the Rose family through the years, and we are saddened for their loss. Cecil will be greatly missed by all who knew him.”\n\nA FAMILY CONNECTION TO UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON\n\nRose and his family have a long history at the University of Houston. His younger brother, Lynden Rose, played for the Cougars from 1980 to 1982 and was a member of Houston’s celebrated Phi Slama Jama team along with Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler before being selected by the Los Angeles Lakers in the sixth round of the 1982 NBA Draft. Lynden Rose also served as a member of the UH Board of Regents from 2004 to 2009.\n\nThree of Rose’s sisters also attended UH, and the family connection continues today. Sisters Debra Rose-Munnings and Sharon Rose Hutchinson are prominent international attorneys, while sister Priscilla Rose is an executive health care professional. All three sisters also attended the University of Houston after Cecil Rose’s arrival. His nephew, L.J. Rose, is currently a sophomore point guard for the 2013-14 team, competing in his first season at UH after transferring from Baylor.\n\nCecil is survived by his son Cecil, III, brothers Lynden, Jacob, Paul, sisters: Priscilla, Debra, Sharon, and a host of loving family and friends.\n\nPersonally, I have known Cecil since I was a little girl growing up in Houston. He was always so pleasant, helpful and friendly. He always wore his Bahamas colors with pride and served as a proud ambassador. As part of the Bahamian American Association in Houston, no Bahamian holiday went unobserved as Cecil ensured Goombay Punch, conch fritters and conch salad were on deck for all to enjoy, along with Junkanoo, Soca or Rake n Scrape music playing in the background. As a collegiate athlete I called upon Cecil often for his advice, especially when I returned to the Bahamas aspiring to compete in track and field for the Bahamas national team. He provided support and encouragement throughout my NCAA career. His smile and effervescent charm will truly be missed by all. RIP."
