        "text": "BLACK TUESDAY “Black Tuesday” began in The Bahamas April 27th 1965.Black Tuesday took place not only inside but outside The House Of Assembly. According to Source B Black Tuesday was possibly one of the greatest events in the movement of Bahamian independence. The PLP (Progressive Liberal Party) was formed November 23rd 1953.The PLP consisted of Sir Lynden Pindling, the late Sir Milo Butler, Mr. Cyril Stevenson, Mr. Sammie Issacs, the late Clarence A. Bain, and the late Sir Randol Fawkes. The formation of the PLP was a first for The Bahamas because it introduced party politics. At this time the majority group in the House was the Bay Street Boys, who later formed the UBP (United Bahamian Party). As mentioned by Source B around the time October 1956 at that time, only a few men, those who owned land, could vote. In addition, a man could vote in as many placed as he owned land, every company that owned land could vote, no woman could vote, and 21 years was the qualifying age. The PLP sought to change this desperate state of affairs and the UBP fought them every inch of the way. Between 1959 and1961, the Women’s Suffrage Movement took up the cause of votes for women and in July 1961, the act of voting for women became law. This was a huge step toward majority rule.\n\nThe 1962 general election was the first election were all Bahamians including women were allowed to vote. Surprisingly though the UBP won the election over the PLP. This was because workers were threatened to be fired if they voted PLP. Also the UBP said that they were improving the Bahamian economy that change now would frighten tourist and investors who were just coming back from the general strike in 1958. The UBP even suggested that the PLP were not knowledgeable enough to run the country and that if they gained control of government, the economy would be ruined. Another reason the UBP won was because they arranged the constituency boundaries in such a way as to give themselves an unfair advantage. This was known “Gerrymandering”. These issues continued to be a topic of concern for the PLP until debate reached a boiling point on April 27th 1965. This event as mentioned in Source B which is known as “Black Tuesday” is believed to be the most significant in the struggle for majority rule. It was during a heated debate over the issue of boundaries that Sir. Lynden Pindling threw the mace, the speaker’s symbol of authority, out of the window of The House Of Assembly. Along with this Sir Milo Butler threw the two hour glasses, which was used to time the member’s speech in parliament, out the window. Black Tuesday demonstrated the strength of will the PLP had. An Excerpt from Doris Johnson titled “The Quiet Revolution” states “the first amendment, presented by Lynden Pindling, increasingly popular PLP leader, called for the House \"not to resolve itself into a committee of the whole for further consideration at this time of the draft order under Section 63of the Constitution. Spurgeon Bethel, PLP, introduced the second amendment which added to Pindling's proposal \"that this House approves of a national registration campaign being held by the Government to ascertain the true position of voter population distribution in the Bahamas and the appointment of a UN special commission to delineate constituencies and boundaries.” It also stated that Sir Milo Butler found it obvious that the government was going to do nothing about the proposed boundaries. Sir Lynden said and I quote “We do not ask the House to do what the Opposition wants,\" he said; \"to draw up the boundaries where we want. All we ask is that the machinery available to Government be used to find out accurate figures of the voter population.” Whilst this was being said a crowd outside kept up a cry of “Amend, Amend”. A speaker said to Pindling that he had a nice voice and he retorted that he intended to use it outside. Sir Milo Butler then commented on the warmth of the air condition in the second-story chamber. He then calmly rose and opened the two windows near the Opposition side of the room and surveyed the noisy crowd in the public square below. When the house had voted, both amendments were defeated. That is what led to Sir Lynden Pindling throwing the mace out of the house. The dramatic action in The House caught the attention of thousands all over the world.\n\nThe scene shifted to the outside where a large crowd of black Bahamians gathered. They were wearing and carrying PLP posters. Some of the slogans were “Bay Street Drunk with Power” and “Boycott Bay Street”. Sir Lynden Pindling and Cecil Wallace Whitfield led them down East Bay Street were they paraded up and down Bay Street between East and Parliament Streets since early morning. The crowd shouted with joy when Pindling exited the House. Pindling informed the supporters of what had just happened and why he threw out the mace. He told the people that he no longer respected the authority of the House and would not return until it was ruled by the majority of the people. The police came to apprehend the mass of people. Pindling then told them \"Your fight is not with the police; Obey them if you are told to move.\" For a total of twenty minutes police dragged demonstrators away without resistance. Sir Lynden Pindling claimed that the report of the Boundaries Commissioners did not actually reflect the true state of voter distribution. He then vowed to stage a string of demonstrations to bring the stink of the city to the attention of the world. It was because of the local police force and a large riot squad that Pindling lead the crowd to the southern recreation grounds or “over the hill”. It was there that Pindling told the people to return to their homes or businesses, and return to the recreation grounds that night. He said that would be when the course of today’s actions would be decided.\n\nAs a result of “Black Tuesday” the mace was sent back to England to be repaired and re-gold plated. This money was raised by the public. Along with that there was no prosecutions ensued that day. Sir Lynden Pindling was also catapulted into a higher national standing an is known as a man of courage and foresight.\n\nSimilar Documents\n\nFree Essay\n\nBlack Tuesday\n\n...BLACK TUESDAY IN THE BAHAMAS(APRIL 27, 1965) (Events inside and outside of The House of Assembly and aftermath of Black Tuesday are excerpts from \"The Quiet Revolution\" by Dame Dr. Doris Johnson.)
