        "text": "WASHINGTON - The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) expanded TSA PreCheck® to an international location for the first time at a ribbon cutting ceremony earlier with the Commonwealth of The Bahamas at Lynden Pindling International Airport in Nassau.\n\nTSA PreCheck is an expedited screening program that enables low-risk travelers to enjoy an efficient screening experience at more than 200 airports in the United States and Nassau.\n\n“This has been an excellent partnership throughout the trial period at Lynden Pindling International Airport, and it serves as a model for further extending TSA PreCheck. Permanently opening this TSA PreCheck lane for travelers who join the risk-based program is a credit to the Government of The Bahamas and the commitment of the officers who are maintaining the highest standards of transportation security,” said TSA Administrator David Pekoske.\n\nNassau is one of 16 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) international Preclearance locations in which CBP personnel inspect travelers prior to boarding U.S.-bound flights. Travelers leaving from those airports proceed directly to connecting flights or destinations upon landing in the United States.\n\nDuring the ribbon cutting ceremony in Nassau today, TSA Regional Director Karen Hanlon joined U.S. Embassy Chargé d'Affaires Usha E. Pitts, and the Honorable I. Chester Cooper, MP, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, Investments and Aviation.\n\nTSA PreCheck is available for eligible passengers when departing from Nassau or a U.S. airport with the program, including when connecting on domestic flights after returning to the United States. Travelers who are U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals and U.S. lawful permanent residents can apply for TSA PreCheck for a cost of $85 for a five-year membership.\n\nPassengers who are members of TSA PreCheck and other DHS Trusted Traveler programs are eligible for TSA PreCheck screening. To find the program that best suits your travel needs, use the Department of Homeland Security trusted traveler comparison tool. TSA PreCheck is also available at no cost for U.S. Armed Forces service members, including those serving in the U.S. Coast Guard, Reserves, and National Guard. Enrolled airline passengers can enjoy the benefits on 80 TSA PreCheck participating domestic and international carriers.\n\nTen airlines with flights within the United States maintain regular routes between Nassau and the following U.S. cities: Atlanta, Boston, Baltimore, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Washington, Denver, Dallas, Detroit, Newark, Topeka, Ft. Lauderdale, Houston, Islip, New York, Orlando, Miami, Minneapolis, Chicago, Palm Beach, Philadelphia, Providence, Sanford, San Juan and Tampa.\n\n###"
