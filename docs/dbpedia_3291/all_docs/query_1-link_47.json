        "text": "FARNESE PALACE\n\nFarnese Palace - click to enlarge\n\nPiazza Farnese rose for the will of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, who to build the family mansion before bought houses and hovels which stood in the area now occupied by his palace and Farnese square, then in 1514 demolished everything and finally commissioned Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, one of the major architects of the time, the design of the palace.\n\nAlessandro Farnese had benefited from the Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia's passion for his sister Giulia, so when the Borgia became Pope Alexander VI Alessandro Farnese appointed Cardinal.\n\nThe Square and the Palace, which form an inseparable unity, acquired its present appearance in 1626, when the architect Girolamo Rainaldi designed the two fountains, placed symmetrically in relation to the Palace.\n\nThe granite basins of the two fountains were taken from Piazza San Marco, but probably originally were in the Baths of Caracalla.\n\nFarnese Palace, named by the Romans “Dado Farnese”, dominates the square; Antonio da Sangallo the Younger directed the works from 1514 until his death in 1546.\n\nDuring this period occurred two important facts: the Sack of Rome in 1527, which involved the interruption of the work and the rise to the papacy in 1534 of Alessandro Farnese with the name of Paul III, and the work promptly resumed.\n\nAfter Sangalloâs death, from 1546 succeeded Michelangelo who designed in the faÃ§ade the Farnese coat of armsand the beautiful cornice, but the death of Pope Paul III in 1549 stopped again the works, which resumed in 1565 directed by Vignola, since Michelangelo had died in 1564. Finally, the palace was completed in 1589 by Giacomo Della Porta commissioned by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, said the \"Great Cardinal,\" who was really a great patron of the arts, and Della Porta was responsible for the magnificent faÃ§ade which looks over the Tiber.\n\nPalazzo Farnese, faÃ§ade over the Tiber - click to enlarge\n\nAlessandro Farnese had in the meantime bought the spectacular villa which Agostino Chigi had built on the other side of the TiberÂ (that we now know as Villa Farnesina), for this reason he intended to join the two buidings with a bridge, however, and unfortunately, its construction was barely sketched, it remains the arch that crosses via Giulia.\n\nAs for the faÃ§ade which looks over the square you can see the differences between the left and the right side, in fact, the red brick, said ferraioli, to the left of the main floor are arranged regularly, while on the right are placed haphazardly.\n\nYou may then think that the brick facing was to be plastered with a putty travertine dust, like travertine are the cantonal of the building.\n\nAs you can easily imagine the interior of the building was painted by the best artists of the time. Among the most relevant rooms it should be mentioned the Fasti Farnesiani hall, frescoed by Francesco Salviati in 1552 and completed by Taddeo Zuccari around 1565; while Annibale Carracci with the help of his brother Agostino painted the “Camerino” and the “Gallery”, where in the vault we see the famous “Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne”; note that even the great Domenichino worked with Agostino Carracci painting in the Gallery the Woman with the Unicorn, probable a portrait of Giulia Farnese.\n\nThe visit the Palace must be booked by sending an e-mail to:\n\nvisite-farnese@inventerrome.com\n\nWoman with the Unicorn - click to enlarge"
