        "text": "The only leap year baby to become pope was Paul III, who was born in Italy in 1468.\n\nThe former Alessandro Farnese became pope in 1534. He convened the Council of Trent in 1545 and was a significant patron of the arts, overseeing the completion of Michelangelo’s fresco, the Last Judgement, which depicts the Second Coming of Christ and the final judgement by God behind the altar of the Sistine Chapel.\n\nHe died in 1549 and is buried in a tomb which Michelangelo designed.\n\nPaul III established the Jesuit order and approved the Spiritual Exercises developed by St. Ignatius Loyola, which include meditations, prayers and contemplative practices to deepen one’s relationship with God.\n\nHappy birthday, Pope Paul III!\n\nTo mark the founding of the Society of Jesus on September 27, 1540, the Holy Father, himself a Jesuit, visit with his Jesuit brothers and enjoyed pranzo with them. He is the only Jesuit to ever be elected pope.\n\nThe Society of Jesus–a Roman Catholic missionary organization–received its charter from Pope Paul III. The Jesuit order played an important role in the Counter-Reformation and eventually succeeded in converting millions around the world to Catholicism.\n\nHere is an image of Pope Paul III & a new artifact from his papacy.\n\nPope Paul III: Early Vellum Papal Bull w/ Lead Bulla, 1544\n\nDefinition of a Papal Bull\n\nThe word, bull comes from the Latin, bubble. It is the lead seal that was appended to the end of a document acting as the signature of the pope. On one side, it contains the pope’s name and on the other, images of Saints Peter and Paul from whom he is given his authority.\n\nOn this particular bull, Pope Paul III’s coat of arms is actually on it, which is interesting.\n\nThe bull is generally an official document of the Holy Father. We know by the choice of threading used, either silk or twine, the importance of any particular bull.\n\nThe artifact is a very rare and large example of a 16th century vellum papal bull with the lead bulla attached.\n\nThis untranslated bull dates to the papacy of Paul III (1534-1549), specifically to his 10th year as Pope (c.1544). The lead bulla of Paul III is attached to the bull, but it’s strangely upside down. It appears that the seal had at some point been detached and someone then tied the cord together, which now displays the seal upside down.\n\nOther than that strange fact, the bull itself is in great condition, with nice calligraphy in the Pope’s name and several signatures of the Roman Curia underneath the vellum flap.\n\nThis bull measures approximately 16 x 24 inches."
