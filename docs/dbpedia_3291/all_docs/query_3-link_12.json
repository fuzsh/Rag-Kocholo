        "text": "Pope Paul III, born Alessandro Farnese, is the architect of the creation of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza.The Duchy ceased to exist with the Unification of Italy. But there were many events and families that alternated in its 315 years of history.\n\nOn the thumb of her left hand she’s wearing the wedding ring of her spouse, who died in 1622, as a symbol of legitimacy of the ducal regency which she held in place of her son Odoardo, still a minor until 1628.\n\nThe ermine mantle that falls from her shoulders is the symbol of her royalty. The painting takes inspiration from the large canvas at the Prado Museum with the royal family, where she is sitting in the center next to Queen Elizabeth Farnese.\n\nFerdinand of Bourbon was the duke who experienced the effects of the French Revolution, experiencing the Napoleonic occupation. He had a peaceful nature and he lived in the Reggia of Colorno, where he could dedicate himself to his cultured passions.\n\nThe Ara Amicitiae monument was placed in the center of the main square of Parma and it was erected on the occasion of the visit of Joseph II of Austria to celebrate the union between the two families."
