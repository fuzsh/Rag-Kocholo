        "text": "Hi! This is my first thread on this website.\n\nAs the title says, the POD is that Henry, the king-cardinal of Portugal, doesn't die in January 1580 but lives on for at least a few months more. Therefore, the Portuguese Cortes, already gathered at Almeirim, have enough time to officially appoint an heir to the throne.\n\nApart from Philip II of Spain, who IOTL took advantage of the Portuguese succession crisis to conquer the country and add it to his empire, there are three candidates:\n\n1) Dom Antonio, Prior of Crato, who was the illegitimate son of Luis, Duke of Beja. Antonio was the first male descendant of the house of Aviz, but the problem was that he was a bastard (although he tried to prove that his parents got married after his birth, therefore legitimizing him ); however, there's an historical precedent which could justify his ascension to the throne, because the house of Aviz itself was a cadet illegitimate branch of the house of Burgundy (the former royal house ) and only took the throne in 1385 because the legitimate heir was the King of Castille and the Portuguese aristocracy and bourgeoisie opposed the union with that kingdom.\n\n2) Ranuccio Farnese, who was the son of the Italian condottiero Alessandro Farnese, future Duke of Parma and Piacenza, and of the Infanta Maria of Guimarães. According to the Portuguese law of the time, he was the first heir to the throne of Portugal.\n\n3) The Infanta Catarina, who was the second daughter of the Infante Duarte, Duke of Guimarães (and therefore she was the younger sister of the Infanta Maria ). She had married João, Duke of Braganza; therefore she is the ancestor of the Portuguese kings of the house of Braganza IOTL.\n\nIn one out of these three pretenders is chosen, Portugal will remain independent and avoid the Iberian Union, which was a disaster for the country IOTL, because it involved it in all of Spain's war and exposed its colonial possessions to the attacks of the Dutch and of the English.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI think that it would be very hard to get any of these candidates on board really. Although Philip was likely not the candidate most would prefer, they probably have a more powerful army than Portugal at this point in time, and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest that what anti-Habsburg choice made would be irrelevant if he decides to just conquer Portugal and make the Iberian Union anyway. But I'm not too versed on that portion to say if the man was willing to concede his claims to Portugal.\n\nI would say the best person for that is Ranuccio Farnese, the heir to the Duchy of Parma, as I'm certain that his family was at least remotely pro-Habsburg, but again, not sure.\n\nI think that it would be very hard to get any of these candidates on board really.

According to the Portuguese law of the time, he was the first heir to the throne of Portugal.\n\nI think the best bet.\n\nRanuccio is 11 years old at the time, though. So his candidacy would mean a regency - administered by his pro-Spanish father? And since Portugal and Parma in personal union don't make much sense - Ranuccio's younger brother is unlikely to become a Cardinal but is likely to marry Ranuccio's OTL wife. Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain in this scenario is likely to marry to Portugal in this scenario (or her younger sister). But that would be a fig leaf cover over Spanish annexation - \"yes, you don't get to be ruled by King of Spain; no, you get to be ruled by Spanish-stuffed regency council for 11-years old Italian boy\".\n\nThe Cortes of Almeirim had been divided between Philip of Spain, Catarina of Bragança and António Prior do Crato, as they were the only ones with actual political capital in the Cortes to have backing, Manuel Felisberto and Rainúncio were never seriously considered. It has to be understood that at the time the Portuguese Crown didn't had specific laws of succession, with only the Lei Mental published in the Ordenações Manuelinas placing some qualifications on the inheritance of Crown Lands or Lands given by the Crown, because of that the partisans of Philip and Catarina has spent most of their time engaged in a judicial-political argument over which side had the better legal right of succession, mostly because there was a clear void on the grounds of succession, ironically enough on the basis of the law that later was determined as the one to determine the affairs of succession for the Portuguese Crown the Duke of Savoy had the best legal argument; Meanwhile António's indirect candidacy was being based around the legal arguments that the Cortes had the legal right to appoint an heir, unsurprisingly this line of argument was mostly pushed by the representatives of the cities and towns with the right of representation and was lead by the representatives of Lisbon.\n\nWith this in mind, if Henrique lives longer his political capital will most likely be spent opposing Castro, whom he disliked and his strong opposition that the Cortes could elect an heir, in order to try to increase the support for the Duchess Catarina, unfortunately she had little support amongst the representatives of the nobility and the representatives of the councils, Henrique living longer may gain her some more support but Philip was still the most popular candidate amongst the ranks of the nobility and the clergy, this was a period in which Spanish cultural influence in Portugal was considerably strong, most of the educated classes who engaged in university studies did so not in Portugal but in Spain and to a lesser extent France, most of the nobles and clergy had ties to spanish counterparts and vice versa, many Portuguese nobles had achieved positions of power and influence in the Spanish Court well before 1580, for any candidate to displace Philip as the favoured will be a rather uphill struggle.\n\nThe Cortes of Almeirim had been divided between Philip of Spain, Catarina of Bragança and António Prior do Crato, as they were the only ones with actual political capital in the Cortes to have backing, Manuel Felisberto and Rainúncio were never seriously considered.

That kinda defeats the idea of an alternative to Philip then, doesn't it?\n\nIn other words, the most powerful men in the Kingdom wanted Philip II, and it was unlikely any other candidate could counter this.
