        "text": "This week we introduced you to Giulia Farnese, The Pope’s Mistress. Today we delve just a little bit further into this family, one of the noble families who left their mark on Renaissance Rome, and who we encounter on our Rome at Twilight Among the Piazzas and Fountains tour.\n\nTitian’s 1543 portrait of Pope Paul III, Alessandro Farnese, now hanging in the National Museum of Capodimonte in Naples\n\nRaphael’s portrait of Alessandro Farnese when he was a cardinal, 1509-1511 (also hanging in the National Museum of Capodimonte)\n\nAlessandro Farnese became Pope Paul III in 1534, but he was a cardinal for a full 41 years prior to his election. Because his sister Giulia was Pope Alexander VI’s mistress at the time that Pope Alexander VI named him cardinal, labels followed him throughout his career, such as “petticoat pope” and others more vulgar, disparaging his ascendancy as simply a fringe benefit of his sister’s relationship with the Borgia pope.\n\nAlessandro commissioned work on Palazzo Farnese while he was still a cardinal, in 1515. The family residence was enlarged and embellished after he ascended to the papacy in 1534, including work by Michelangelo, who redesigned the third floor.\n\nThe Republic of Italy gave Palazzo Farnese to the French Government for 99 years beginning in 1936, and it currently serves as the Embassy of France in Italy.\n\nTitian’s portrait of one of Alessandro Farnese’s grandchildren, Ranuccio, son of Alessandro’s illegitimate son Pier Luigi, at age 12. Alessandro, after he became Pope Paul III, named Ranuccio cardinal when he was only 15, and he had the nickname cardalino, little cardinal.\n\nIn Piazza Farnese where the Farnese family palace stands today, there are two large basins used as fountains. These basins were most likely taken from the Baths of Caracalla and were originally placed in what is today Piazza Venezia, in 1466. Alessandro Farnese had first one placed in the piazza, then, several years later, managed to have a second one, nearly identical, also moved to Piazza Farnese, where they still stand today.\n\nWe explore Piazza Farnese and many other of the beautiful and iconic Roman piazzas at sunset on our tour Rome at Twilight Among the Piazzas and Fountains.
