        "text": "In 1556, the cardinal Alessandro Farnese begins the building of the Palazzo Farnese in Caprarola, a village north of Rome. Its decoration attests of his wealth and his power by showing his family’s glorious deeds and his role in the defense of the Catholic Church. Loren Partridge, the specialist of the Palazzo Farnese, has noticed such a discourse in the room of maps and the room of Farnese deeds among others. This paper will show that the cardinal’s private chapel has a part in this panegyric. Since the Palazzo Farnese is located outside urban centers, the mass, attended by the cardinal, his famiglia and his guests, is celebrated in its chapel on a regular basis. Consequently, the chapel’s architecture and iconography are used as a display of Alessandro Farnese’s papal ambitions. In the first place, the circular form of the room and the parallel between the altar and the tomb of Christ recall the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. This analogy is part of the cardinal’s plan to establish Caprarola as a new Jerusalem. At the same time, Pope Gregory XIII applies the same allegory to Rome, in order to assert its power over Christianity and to enhance his own qualities. By recuperating the papal strategy, Alessandro Farnese shows his guests his ability for the papal throne. In the second place, the Eucharistic symbolic is really important in the global iconography of the chapel. This prominence shows the filiation between Alessandro Farnese and his grandfather, the pope Paul III, who made the defense of the sacrament his main concern in the fight against Protestantism. This could be a strategy to present the former as worthy of the papal tiara as the later. In fact, this example shows that private chapels in countryside palaces are not so private and can be used as a public display of the political ambitions of their owner."
