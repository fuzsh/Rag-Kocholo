        "text": "Julius III\n\nFebruary 7, 1550 - March 23, 1555\n\nPRE-PAPAL BACKGROUND\n\nBirth and Education\n\nwas born Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte in in 1487.\n\nLike his father who was a well-known jurist, he studied law. He attended the universities of and\n\nPositions in the Church\n\nGiovanni was appointed to a number of positions in the Church by the three popes who preceded him.\n\n●Archbishop of Siponto. appointed Giovanni to succeed his uncle Antonio as Archbishop of Siponto (Manfredonia).\n\n●Bishop of Pavia. Leo X named Giovanni as the Bishop of in 1520.Â\n\n●Vice-legate of Perugia. Leo X appointed Giovanni to be vice-legate to Perugia.\n\n●Governor of Rome. twice appointed Giovanni Governor of Rome.Â\n\n●Vice-legate of Bologna. appointed Giovanni vice-legate of\n\n●Cardinal-priest. In 1536 Paul III appointed Giovanni -priest with the titular church of San Vitale.Â\n\n●Bishop of Palestrina. Pope Paul named Cardinal del Monte Bishop of Palestrina in 1543.Â\n\n●Co-President of Council of Trent. Paul III made Cardinal del Monte the first co-president of the authorizing him to open the meeting in 1545. In this position, he was instrumental in moving the meeting from to Bologna in 1547. This angered emperor Charles V who had hoped to expand the participants to include a Protestant faction. These, however, could not be persuaded to travel into Italy.Â\n\nBeing Held Hostage After Sack\n\nAfter the in 1527, Cardinal del Monte, who was Pope Clement's appointee as governor, was among the cardinals that the pope turned over to the enemy. Had he not been rescued by Cardinal Colonna, Cardinal del Monte would have been among those executed. After he became pope, he repaid the favor by restoring to the Colonna family the property that Paul III had seized.\n\nELECTION AS POPE\n\nThree Factions\n\nCardinal del Monte was elected pope as a compromise choice after ten weeks in conclave. There were three factions. The two main groups were made up of supporters of the and supporters of the French king, Henri II (1519-59).\n\nThe third faction was made up of supporters of the previous pope, who were now led by his grandson\n\nLiaisons and Compromises\n\nThe Farnese faction joined with the emperor's supporters, but the two-thirds majority required for election could not be realized without the French. Although several cardinals, including Reginald Pole of England, came close to election, a compromise was necessary, and in the end Cardinal del Monte was chosen. Because of his decision to move the Council of Trent to Bologna back in 1547, he had not been on the Charles V's list of acceptable candidates.\n\nConditions Agreed Upon in Conclave\n\nAt the time of his election, pope-elect Julius III agreed to reconvene the and to restore and to Ottavio Farnese.\n\nHe initially kept both promises, but the matter of Piacenza became problematical.\n\nSelection of Name\n\nCardinal del Monte chose the name \"Julius\" in honor of who had named his uncle Archbishop of Siponto.\n\nReaction in Rome\n\nThe Roman people were overjoyed at seeing a native of their city elected pope. Their joy increased when he abolished an unpopular tax on flour.\n\nJULIUS III AS LAST RENAISSANCE POPE\n\nOverview\n\nJulius has been called both a \"typical\" Renaissance pope and the \"last\" of the Renaissance popes on account of his pursuit of pleasure, his nepotism, and his relative indifference to reforming the Church.\n\nPursuit of Pleasure\n\nLike many Renaissance popes, who lived like secular princes, Julius III pursued courtly pleasures like banquets, plays, hunts, and festivals. Somewhat fittingly, his election coincided with a Jubilee year for the Church, which was a time of celebration.\n\nUpon his election, Julius began work on a just outside Rome's northern entrance, the\n\nDiscouraged by the outcome of his foreign policies, the pope withdrew to his villa in 1552 and thereafter spent little time attending to church business.\n\nNepotism\n\nLike most Renaissance popes, Pope Julius III appointed his relatives to positions of influence in both the Church and the\n\nWhile in office, he raised five of his relatives to the position of cardinal.\n\nPromotion of Innocenzo del Monte\n\nThe first of the cardinalates he awarded was to Innocenzo del Monte, who was then seventeen and had been his companion for years. Julius had persuaded his brother Baldovino to adopt Innocenzo in 1548 after the death of Baldovino's own son, who had been the last male heir of the del Monte family.\n\nThe pope claimed to have first seen Innocenzo in Parma when he was a cardinal. At that time, Innocenzo, who was still only a boy, impressed the cardinal with his spirit in fighting back against a monkey that was attacking him.\n\nBecause Innocenzo was rude, inept, and impulsive, and had no qualifications for becoming a cardinal, historians have concluded that Innocenzo was the pope's son or that the pope was infatuated with him as a lover.\n\nAfter Julius' death, Innocenzo killed two people at a banquet, which led to his being imprisoned for a short time.\n\nRECONVENING COUNCIL OF TRENT\n\nOpening of Council\n\nJulius III reconvened the Council of Trent to satisfy the pledge made at his election and to appease Charles V, who still clung to the hope that the parties could resolve their differences through negotiation.\n\nThe eleventh session of the Council of Trent opened May 1st, 1551.\n\nParticipants\n\nKing Henri II ordered French bishops not to attend.\n\nA decree was passed that guaranteed Protestants safe-passage to the council, and although they arrived late, several ambassadors from Protestant princes succeeded at making themselves heard at the council.\n\nDefining Dogma\n\nThe council began by returning to the issue of defining official Church dogma. They addressed the of the Confession, and Extreme Unction.\n\nDissension and Dissolution\n\nWith the arrival of the Protestant delegation, little common ground could be found, and the council's progress came to a standstill.\n\nThe council, then in its sixteenth session, was dissolved in April of 1552, less than a year after it opened. Part of the reason further progress could not be made was that Emperor Charles V was at war with King Henri of France over Parma.\n\nWAR OVER PARMA AND PIACENZA\n\nBackground to Land Ownership\n\nAt his death, Paul III ceded Parma and Piacenza to his grandson\n\nThe citizens of Piacenza asked Emperor Charles V for his protection, which he granted, sending Ferrante to govern there.\n\nFulfilling Pre-Election Promise\n\nIn exchange for his critical electoral support, Julius III promised Ottavio's brother that he would install Ottavio as the Duke of Parma and Piacenza.\n\nJulius was able to give Ottavio control of Parma by recalling the papal legate appointed by Paul III. Piacenza was another matter because the emperor's appointee as Governor, Ferrante Gonzaga, refused to leave and threatened to take Parma.\n\nOttavio's Allying Himself with the French\n\nTo fortify his position in Parma, Ottavio made an alliance with the French king, Henri II.\n\nJulius' Allying Himself with the Emperor\n\nBecause the pope now wished to accommodate the emperor, he withdrew his support for Ottavio and sent papal forces to join Gonzaga's troops in the hope of capturing Parma for the emperor. The French army came to guard Parma.\n\nLoss to the French\n\nHenri II, seeming to put territorial politics ahead of religion, allied himself with the Protestant princes in Germany, who wished to break free of imperial control.\n\nAs a result of having to fight the armies of both the French and the German rebel princes, Charles V's forces were weakened, and in 1552 he withdrew. He returned Piacenza to Ottavio, who was to his illegitimate daughter Margaret of Austria.\n\nThe emperor's capitulation forced Julius III to make a similarly disadvantageous truce with France in which he relinquished further claims on Parma and Piacenza and paid an indemnity.\n\nFINAL YEARS, 1552-55\n\nWithdrawal from Politics\n\nBecause the events involving Parma had gone badly for the pope and led to the dissolution of the Council of Trent, Julius III became discouraged with politics, and in 1552, he withdrew to his which was still under construction. For the remainder of his pontificate, he devoted himself almost exclusively to pleasure.\n\nIllness and Death\n\nJulius III was horribly troubled by gout, and when he died, he was emaciated due to his efforts to avoid foods that exacerbated his condition. He died of a fever on March 23, 1555.\n\nACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\nGaining Momentum toward Reform\n\nAlthough Julius III may not have personally been interested in reform, a certain amount of momentum had been put in motion by the reform movement begun by his predecessor. Although his work did not see immediate results, he did attempt to reform conclave procedures and papal bodies such as the College of Cardinals.\n\nApproving the Jesuit Constitution\n\nIn 1550, Julius III approved the constitution of the newly formed in Italy, which had been founded by the Spanish priest Ignatius Loyola and approved by Paul III in 1540.\n\nSupporting Santissima TrinitÃ\n\nThe pope supported the Santissima TrinitÃ dei Pelegrini, a charitable institution providing short-term accommodation for convalescents from hospitals and for travelers on pilgrimages to Rome.\n\nFounding Collegium Germanicum\n\nPope Julius approved and supported the Collegium Germanicum, which the Jesuits founded to train young German and Austrian priests to promulgate Catholicism in their homelands. The Jesuits provided instruction.\n\nRestricting Brothers Being Cardinals\n\nJulius issued a bull against brothers being cardinals at the same time.\n\nLimiting Bishoprics to One\n\nJulius III took a step against pluralism, the holding of multiple offices. This practice often resulted in work being passed on to unqualified, poorly paid officials, instead of the individual assigned to a region, city, or church. He required cardinals with more than one bishopric to relinquish all except one within six months.\n\nAttempting to Return England to Church\n\nAfter the death of Edward VI (1538-1553), Henry VIII's only son, his Catholic daughter, Mary (1516-1558), succeeded to the English throne. Mary's mother was Henry's first wife, Catherine of\n\nJulius made Cardinal Reginald Pole his legate to England and authorized him to lift the interdict from the country and to negotiate renewal of English ties with the This interval in which England returned to Catholicism ended with the ascension of Elizabeth I to the English throne in 1558.\n\nPATRONAGE\n\nAppointment of the Composer Palestrina\n\nJulius III, who was especially fond of music, appointed the Italian composer Palestrina (1526-94) choirmaster of the Cappella Giulia. Julius first encountered the composer in the city of Palestrina when he was Bishop there (1543-50). The pope was criticized for this appointment because Palestrina was not a member of the clergy.\n\nArchitectural Commissions in Rome\n\nJulius III would have liked to have commissioned more projects, but he could not afford to do so because of the massive debts left by Paul III.\n\n♦Villa Giulia, Rome, 1550-55. Pope Julius III built the a magnificent on the site of a modest villa left to him by his uncle, Archbishop Antonio del Monte. Giorgio Vasari claimed authorship of the with the input of Michelangelo himself. Construction was by and who was Julius' official architect for all other projects besides St. Peter's. Vignola was responsible for the the entrance and a that forms the of a long court. Ammannati designed the of the courtyard, which led to the From a ground-level visitors could see the semicircular Â\n\n♦Sant' Andrea in Via Flaminia, Rome, 1550-53. To commemorate his escape after being held hostage following the Sack of Rome, Pope Julius III commissioned Vignola to design and build in the This church was important as the first one to have an a form that would become prevalent in Baroque church planning. Vignola's design was an elongation of the domed square, which had been derived from ancient Â\n\n♦Chapel and Tombs in San Pietro in Montorio. To honor the bequest for tombs left by his uncle Archbishop Antonio del Monte, Julius III commissioned a family chapel in Marble tombs were built for Julius' uncles Antonio del Monte and Fabiano del Monte. This project involved Giorgio Vasari, who designed the space, and Bartolommeo Ammannati, who executed the sculptures.Â\n\nArchitectural Commissions at the Vatican\n\n♦Re-appointing Michelangelo at St. Peter's. Pope Julius affirmed as the architect of Like Paul III, he had to step in between Michelangelo and the Fabbrica ( building committee) and insist that the latter respect the architect's wishes. Â\n\n♦Expanding Villa Belvedere. Julius commissioned anÂ of the behind the designed by Bramante.\n\n♦Building new staircase, upper Belvedere Court. Julius III commissioned Michelangelo to design a to replace which had to be removed to make room for a passage to connect the existing part of the Villa Belvedere with his new addition.\n\n♦Building Fountain on outer wall of Belvedere Court.
