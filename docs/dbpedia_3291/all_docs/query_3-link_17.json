The Farnese family had prospered over the centuries but it was Alessandro’s ascendency to the papacy and his dedication to family interests which brought about the most significant increase in the family’s wealth and power.\n\nBy Silvia Ruffini, he fathered Pier Luigi Farnese, whom he created Duke of Parma; others included Ranuccio Farnese and Costanza Farnese. He elevated to the cardinalate his grandsons, Alessandro Farnese, aged fourteen, and Guido Ascanio Sforza, aged sixteen.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nThis profile is being updated by the Popes Project.\n\nNote\n\nWikipedia is not a reliable source.
