Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Medici was elected his successor on December 25, 1559 and took the name Pius IV. At the moment of the Pope's death, the Sacred College of Cardinals had fifty-six members. Of them, however, four died during the sede vacante: Giovanni Battista Coniglieri (August 25, 1559), Antoine Sanguin de Meudon (November 25, 1559), Girolamo Recanati Capodiferro (December 1, 1559), and Girolamo Dandini (December 4, 1559). Eight cardinals were absent altogether, including two of the four who died (Sanguin de Meudon and Dandini). One cardinal, Giovanni Battista Coniglieri, died on August 25, 1559, before the conclave began. Cardinal Gianantonio Capizucchi had to be absent from the conclave during the month of October 1559 due to a serious illness. One cardinal died in the conclave: Girolamo Recanati Capodiferro (December 1, 1559). Two others, Jean du Bellay and Giovanni Michele Saraceni, left the conclave early on December 25, 1559, before the final vote was taken. Both knew that Cardinal Medici would be elected within a few hours, and neither thought his vote was necessary to the outcome. Of the forty-four remaining cardinals in conclave on the morning of Christmas Day, forty-three voted for Cardinal Medici, who, of course, did not vote for himself. (Notes provided by Dr. Francis A.

Eighteen cardinals were entirely absent from the election. In addition, one cardinal died in the conclave, and two others attended the conclave but became ill and withdrew before the election.

Cardinal Ugo Boncompagni was elected his successor on May 13, 1572 and took the name Gregory XIII. It was the shortest conclave, for, apparently, only one ballot was taken, followed by one accessus. Conradus Eubel, et al., Hierarchia Catholica Medii et Recentioris Ævi, vol. III, Saeculum XVI ab anno 1503 Complectens (Monasterii: Sumptibus et Typis Librariae Regensbergianae, [1923]), 45 note 1, states that fifty-one cardinals voted at the election of Gregory. Verified data shows, however, that there were sixty-six living cardinals in this sede vacante, of whom only thirteen were absent from the conclave. It is possible that the discrepancy of two is simply a scribal error; or it may be that two cardinals -- including possibly Ugo Boncompagni himself -- did not cast votes in the balloting. Boncompagni, of course, would not have been counted in the accessus. (Notes provided by Dr. Francis A.
