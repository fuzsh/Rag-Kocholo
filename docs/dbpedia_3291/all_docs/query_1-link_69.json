        "text": "Counter-Reformation treatises are typically dismissed as determiners of style. This dissertation challenges the prevailing view that rejects Counter-Reformation theory as key motivators of sacred style, and will prove that one treatise in particular, Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti’s 1582 Discorso intorno alle imagini sacre e profane, held a considerable amount of authority almost immediately after its publication. Through a close study of the Discorso’s nature-centered language and its applicability to the Lombard tradition of presenting “tangible presences,” it is evident that one artist, in particular, fulfilled Paleotti’s vision for a “reformed” sacred style, and one who seldom appears in connection with the cardinal: Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. The interconnection of Paleotti’s theology of nature, Lombard painting style, and the sacred works of Caravaggio is established through this contextual study of Counter-Reformation Rome in the late Cinquecento and early Seicento. Paleotti’s Discorso is evaluated as a whole and as an expression of Paleotti’s ideas on sacred art. This examination and analyses of Paleotti’s major points and emphases shows how they collectively form a cohesive language and theoretical basis (“theology of nature”) for the reformulation of sacred images based on naturalism. Careful readings of Cinquecento and Seicento literature on art (from Vasari to Bellori) draw correspondences between the words used to describe Lombard style and Paleotti’s language in his Discorso. The dissemination of his “theology of nature” is demonstrated through reconstruction of Paleotti’s Roman circle. Paleotti’s important ties to the Oratorians, the Jesuits, the Accademia di San Luca, and his friendships with key cardinal patrons in the circle of Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, provided an ideal network for the dissemination of his ideas that would in fact put him into contact with Caravaggio. Caravaggio’s plebian religious scenes and figures correlate with Paleotti’s conviction that naturalism served as a bridge between painted subject and Christian viewer. This dissertation fills not only a critical lacuna in Counter-Reformation studies, but also opens new contextualizing avenues of research and dialogue on the intricate and determining relationship between Counter-Reformation theory and style, at which, at the heart, stand Cardinal Paleotti and Caravaggio.\n\nSome observations on the history of collecting illuminated cuttings serve to introduce three unpublished Italian fragments that are part of a collection of illuminated frag- ments conserved in the Royal Danish Library. The miniatures are described from the point of view of their liturgical and art-historical content and are presented in the form of entries in a catalogue raisonné. The Master B. F., who grew up under the shadow of Leonardo de Vinci, was among those miniaturists most sought-after by collectors in the late nineteenth and early twen- tieth century because of his evident stylistic debts to the great painter. The beautiful miniature in Copenhagen can now be added to the other known works of this Master and is critical not only to the reconstruction of his corpus, but also for the history of collecting, as it comes from the prestigious Holford Collection. It was already correctly attributed when it entered the collection of the Royal Library; it is here inserted into the activity of the artist, a dating is proposed, and a provenance is suggested from the series of choir books in the monastery of Santi Angelo e Nicolò a Villanova Sillaro in Lombardy, which were broken up around 1799. The Danish cutting here attributed to Attavante has a specific iconography that dem- onstrates an originality and an independence from models followed by contemporary Florentine painting, qualities not always acknowledged to the well known miniaturist whose extensive figurative production has sometimes been considered repetitive. A third fragment is here attributed to the Pisan Master of Montepulciano Gradual I. This anonymous miniaturist is at the centre of the most recent and innovative studies of fourteenth-century Tuscan painting: his activity belongs to the diversified texture of artistic production between Florence and its nearby cities, with expressive modalities independent of the tradition of the more strictly Giottesque masters. The miniature attributed to him here is to be added to the catalogue of his works, dispersed as they are in many European and American collections.\n\nThis book focuses on the Palazzetto Farnese in Rome, consisting of an apartment and adjacent garden situated at the back of the Palazzo Farnese proper; it discusses the motives of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese (1573-1626) to commission art both for his own palace in Rome as well as for other locations were explained not as a result of artistic tastes or preferences, but by means ofFarnese's ecclesiastical position and obligations within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. An institutional approach to artistic patronage makes clear that many of the works of art he commissioned from Annibale Carracci, Domenichino and Lanfranco reflect his attempts to adopt himself to the shifting expectations of the Vatican authorities towards cardinal protectors, and created for that reason a 'spiritual' hermitage for devotional retreats."
