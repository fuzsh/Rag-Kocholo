Would he had secured his crown or Philippe would strike back later?\n\nHow is this altering History? Any thoughts?\n\nAssuming Antonio wins the battle of Alcantara, he would still have to face the Spanish Forces which would still try to occupy Portugal along with pro-Spanish nobles (although he was supported by the commoners and some elements of Clergy and Nobility). The fight would go on for several years and Antonio probably would have used all foreign support he could get.\n\nAnother problem would the strong claim from the Duchess of Braganza to the throne.\n\nIf he succeeds, this would keep the house of Aviz (or in this case the branch Aviz-Beja). He might try to legitimise his illegitimate son Manuel of Portugal.\n\nThe consequences of all this would be no conflicts with the Kingdom of England, nor the Kingdom of France or the Netherlands (when they become independent), which in turn means a larger Portuguese Empire.\n\nIt would also mean that in the middle term, Spain would have less money but perhaps more manpower (without trying to keep Portugal in case of rebellion) to fight insurrections and/or enemy powers.\n\nThe problem is, how could Antonio succeed? If he wins in Alcantara the Spanish would try again, it's only a battle. Also, as Archangel said, those who wanted the Portuguese independence were divided, as we still have the Duchess claim. Many important nobles sided with Philip II, because he paid the ransom of many them or their relatives in Morocco after Ksar-el-Kebir. Even Teodosio, the son of the Duchess, was released from captivity due to Philip's intervention. Even the will of Henry, the last king of the House of Aviz, was that Philip should become the king of Portugal, because he would have more conditions to deffend the Portuguese territories. The Church also supported the Spanish king. The majority of Antonio's supporters were commoners, and so without great political influence. It's very hard to have him being successful.\n\nCouldnt Philip II had pushed the candidacy of the 11 yo Ranuccio Farnese? He was a Spanish subject after all and he could procalim young Ranuccio as a compromise candidate after a potential Spanish defeat in Alcantara instead of claiming the Portuguese Crown for himself... A prolonged war with Portugal would have exhausted Spain in financial and manpower terms...\n\nPlus according to Feudal Custom Ranuccio was first in line of succession... as a son of King Henrique's eldest niece Maria...\n\nWell, I think it doesn't really fit with Philip II. In other thread it was suggested that the Spanish might have supported Ranuccio if Philip II had died in 1580 when he got an epidemic flu which caused the death of his wife, Anna of Austria. Then, with a 05-years-old boy as king (his son Diego Felix) whoever is taking the regency might have accepted to support Ranuccio's claim. IOTL his father - Alessandro Farnese - never presented the claim to the Portuguese court exactly because he was a subject of Philip and a general of the Spanish army. Without an adult king to be affraid maybe he could push for his son's claim.\n\nAnd - shamelessly making a self promotion - you can find some ideas about Ranuccio as the Portuguese king in A New Portugal...\n\nWell, I think it doesn't really fit with Philip II.

Was there any eligible princess then?"
