Musician Of The Week

Julia Marcell

If it comes to the inner circles of my favourite musicians, Julia is my freshest discovery. I had the amazing chance to stand 2 meters from this Polish girl during their live performance in Berlin during EM 2012. To watch her movements and facial expressions was almost such a strong artistic experience as listening to her magical voice while melting to the rhythm of their Björk-ish songs.

Find out her upcoming concerts in Germany and Poland on their website and check out my tube playlist.

On my space you can find her fresh album June.

Artist Of The Week

Lora Zombie

I luckily got to observe the rise of a perfect DA artist to a real star exhibiting her works, making designs and publishing books. Over the years, I never got bored by this Russian who was my first contact to grunge art. Therefore, a place of featured artists belongs to her as well.

Check out her blog, like her and see photos of her (which are also very artistic) on facebook and browse my favourite works on deviantart.

Online Comic Of The Week

Hipster Hitler

A lot of cliché anti-hipster and inappropriate Nazi humour. Short, simple and intellectual distraction from your work. Oh and, black and white. To the comic.

This animation introduced me to the comic:
