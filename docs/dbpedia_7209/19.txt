Julia Marcell

Berlin

âA voice that summons, drives and opens all the doors.â (Haldern Pop) Undeniably talented Berlin-based singer and songwriter Julia Marcell emerged back in 2007 with an EP Storm. Wide international recognition and support enabled her to raise public funds for the full-length album It Might Like You which was recorded in 2009 and produced by Moses Schneider. In 2011 she released an album titled June that marked a significant change in experimental rhythm-sound and gained her prestigious awards in Poland: Polish Music Academyâs Fryderyk 2012 (Best Alternative Album) and Politykaâs Passport (Best Popular Music Act). Julia and the band frequently tour around the world since 2007. The highlights of her extensive gig-list include South by Southwest Festival (SXSW) in Austin, Haldern Pop Festival, Eurosonic Festival, Heineken Openâer in Gdynia, Dojima River Forum in Osaka, Lido in Berlin and other venues around the world.
