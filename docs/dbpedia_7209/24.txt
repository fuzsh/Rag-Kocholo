Julia Marcell is a singer-songwriter living between Berlin and Warsaw. Her upcoming album „Skull Echo“, recorded with producer Michael Haves, features a huge, cinematic sound, sweeping pop melodies and futuristic production, but the subject matter is very intimate and emotional.

It‘s a record about loneliness, about a singular perspective we‘re trapped in, that perhaps gets in the way of our ability to communicate with each other.

Julia about the project: „Skull Echo is a story about time, perception and loneliness. About heads in which we are trapped, building our image of the world through our senses - full of uncertain information, selectively remembered and freely transformed. It is a story of longing for another person.“
