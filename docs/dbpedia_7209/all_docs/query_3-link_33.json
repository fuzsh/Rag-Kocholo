Joel Wong, please submit manuscripts electronically through the Manuscript Submission Portal in Microsoft Word (.docx) or LaTex (.tex) as a zip file with an accompanied Portable Document Format (.pdf) of the manuscript file.‚Äù\n\nPrepare manuscripts according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association using the 7th edition. Manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the Publication Manual). APA Style and Grammar Guidelines for the 7th edition are available.\n\nSubmit Manuscript\n\nGeneral correspondence may be directed to\n\nY. Joel Wong, PhD\n\nIndiana University Bloomington\n\nCounseling and Educational Psychology\n\n107 S. Indiana Avenue\n\nBloomington, IN\n\n47405-7000\n\nEmail\n\nManuscripts for Psychology of Men & Masculinities may be regular-length submissions (7,500 words, not including references, tables, or figures) or brief reports (2,500 words, not including references, tables, or figures). Please include your submission's word count on the title page.\n\nIf Microsoft Word Track Changes was used in preparing the manuscript, please execute the \"accept all changes\" procedure, and remove all comments prior to submission.\n\nPsychology of Men & Masculinities is now using a software system to screen submitted content for similarity with other published content. The system compares the initial version of each submitted manuscript against a database of 40+ million scholarly documents, as well as content appearing on the open web. This allows APA to check submissions for potential overlap with material previously published in scholarly journals (e.g., lifted or republished material).\n\nIf you are submitting a literature review, please read the Literature Review Guidelines.\n\nManuscripts for Psychology of Men & Masculinities may be regular-length submissions (7,500 words, not including references, tables, or figures) or brief reports (2,500 words, not including references, tables, or figures). Please include your submission's word count on the title page.\n\nPsychology of Men & Masculinities requires all manuscripts to comply with guidelines on equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). Read our EDI guidelines before submitting your manuscript.\n\nMasked Review Policy\n\nPsychology of Men & Masculinities uses a masked review process.\n\nEach copy of a manuscript should include a separate title page with author names and affiliations, and these should not appear anywhere else on the manuscript. The first page of the manuscript should include only the title of the manuscript and the date it is submitted. Footnotes containing information pertaining to the authors' identity or affiliations should be removed.\n\nEvery effort should be made to see that the manuscript itself contains no clues to the authors' identity.\n\nPlease ensure that the final version for production includes a byline and full author note for typesetting.\n\nManuscript Preparation\n\nPrepare manuscripts according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association using the 7th edition. Manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the Publication Manual).\n\nReview APA's Journal Manuscript Preparation Guidelines before submitting your article.\n\nDouble-space all copy. Other formatting instructions, as well as instructions on preparing tables, figures, references, metrics, and abstracts, appear in the Manual. Additional guidance on APA Style is available on the APA Style website.\n\nBelow are additional instructions regarding the preparation of display equations, computer code, and tables.\n\nDisplay Equations\n\nWe strongly encourage you to use MathType (third-party software) or Equation Editor 3.0 (built into pre-2007 versions of Word) to construct your equations, rather than the equation support that is built into Word 2007 and Word 2010. Equations composed with the built-in Word 2007/Word 2010 equation support are converted to low-resolution graphics when they enter the production process and must be rekeyed by the typesetter, which may introduce errors.\n\nTo construct your equations with MathType or Equation Editor 3.0:\n\nGo to the Text section of the Insert tab and select Object.\n\nSelect MathType or Equation Editor 3.0 in the drop-down menu.\n\nIf you have an equation that has already been produced using Microsoft Word 2007 or 2010 and you have access to the full version of MathType 6.5 or later, you can convert this equation to MathType by clicking on MathType Insert Equation. Copy the equation from Microsoft Word and paste it into the MathType box. Verify that your equation is correct, click File, and then click Update. Your equation has now been inserted into your Word file as a MathType Equation.\n\nUse Equation Editor 3.0 or MathType only for equations or for formulas that cannot be produced as Word text using the Times or Symbol font.\n\nComputer Code\n\nBecause altering computer code in any way (e.g., indents, line spacing, line breaks, page breaks) during the typesetting process could alter its meaning, we treat computer code differently from the rest of your article in our production process. To that end, we request separate files for computer code.\n\nIn Online Supplemental Material\n\nWe request that runnable source code be included as supplemental material to the article. For more information, visit Supplementing Your Article With Online Material.\n\nIn the Text of the Article\n\nIf you would like to include code in the text of your published manuscript, please submit a separate file with your code exactly as you want it to appear, using Courier New font with a type size of 8 points. We will make an image of each segment of code in your article that exceeds 40 characters in length. (Shorter snippets of code that appear in text will be typeset in Courier New and run in with the rest of the text.) If an appendix contains a mix of code and explanatory text, please submit a file that contains the entire appendix, with the code keyed in 8-point Courier New.\n\nTables\n\nUse Word's Insert Table function when you create tables. Using spaces or tabs in your table will create problems when the table is typeset and may result in errors.\n\nEquity, Diversity, and Inclusion\n\nPsychology of Men & Masculinities requires all manuscripts to comply with equity, diversity, and inclusion guidelines.\n\nParticipant description\n\nAuthors are encouraged to include a description of the study participants in the Method section of each empirical report, including (but not limited to) the following:\n\nSex/Gender\n\nRace/Ethnicity\n\nAge\n\nNativity or immigration history\n\nSocioeconomic status\n\nAny other relevant demographics (e.g., disability status; sexual orientation)\n\nIn the discussion section of the manuscript, authors are encouraged to discuss the diversity of their study samples and the generalizability of their findings.\n\nAcademic Writing and English Language Editing Services\n\nAuthors who feel that their manuscript may benefit from additional academic writing or language editing support prior to submission are encouraged to seek out such services at their host institutions, engage with colleagues and subject matter experts, and/or consider several vendors that offer discounts to APA authors.\n\nPlease note that APA does not endorse or take responsibility for the service providers listed. It is strictly a referral service.\n\nUse of such service is not mandatory for publication in an APA journal. Use of one or more of these services does not guarantee selection for peer review, manuscript acceptance, or preference for publication in any APA journal.\n\nSubmitting Supplemental Materials\n\nAPA can place supplemental materials online, available via the published article in the APA PsycArticles¬Æ database. Please see Supplementing Your Article With Online Material for more details.\n\nAbstract and Keywords\n\nAll manuscripts must include an abstract containing a maximum of 250 words typed on a separate page. After the abstract, please supply up to five keywords or brief phrases.\n\nPublic Significance Statements\n\nAuthors submitting manuscripts to Psychology of Men & Masculinities are required to provide 2‚Äì3 brief sentences regarding the public significance of the study or meta-analysis described in their paper. This description should be included within the manuscript on the abstract/keywords page, but in a separate paragraph from the abstract and keywords. It should be written in language that is easily understood by both professionals and members of the lay public.\n\nWhen an accepted paper is published, these sentences will be boxed beneath the abstract for easy accessibility. All such descriptions will also be published as part of the Table of Contents, as well as on the journal's web page. This new policy is in keeping with efforts to increase dissemination and usage by larger and diverse audiences.\n\nExamples of these 2‚Äì3 sentences include the following:\n\n\"A brief cognitive‚Äìbehavioral intervention for caregivers of children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant reduced caregiver distress during the transplant hospitalization. Long-term effects on caregiver distress were found for more anxious caregivers as well as caregivers of children who developed graft-versus-host disease after the transplant.\"\n\n\"Inhibitory processes, particularly related to temporal attention, may play a critical role in response to exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The main finding that individuals with PTSD who made more clinical improvement showed faster improvement in inhibition over the course of exposure therapy supports the utility of novel therapeutic interventions that specifically target attentional inhibition and better patient-treatment matching.\"\n\n\"When children participated in the enriched preschool program Head Start REDI, they were more likely to follow optimal developmental trajectories of social‚Äìemotional functioning through third grade. Ensuring that all children living in poverty have access to high-quality preschool may be one of the more effective means of reducing disparities in school readiness and increasing the likelihood of lifelong success.\"\n\nTo be maximally useful, these statements of public health significance should not simply be sentences lifted directly from the manuscript.\n\nThey are meant to be informative and useful to any reader. They should provide a bottom-line, take-home message that is accurate and easily understood. In addition, they should be able to be translated into media-appropriate statements for use in press releases and on social media.\n\nPrior to final acceptance and publication, all public health significance statements will be carefully reviewed to make sure they meet these standards. Authors will be expected to revise statements as necessary.\n\nConstraints on Generality\n\nIn a subsection of the discussion titled \"Constraints on Generality,\" authors are encouraged to include a detailed discussion of the limits on generality (see Simons, Shoda, & Lindsay, 2017). In this section, authors should detail grounds for concluding that results are specific to characteristics of the participants and address limits on generality not only for participants but for materials, procedures, and context. They should also specify which methods the authors think could be varied without affecting the result and which should remain constant.\n\nReferences\n\nList references in alphabetical order. Each listed reference should be cited in text, and each text citation should be listed in the References section.\n\nExamples of basic reference formats:\n\nJournal Article\n\nMcCauley, S.

Graphics downloaded or saved from web pages are not acceptable for publication. Multipanel figures (i.e., figures with parts labeled a, b, c, d, etc.) should be assembled into one file. When possible, please place symbol legends below the figure instead of to the side.\n\nResolution\n\nAll color line art and halftones: 300 DPI\n\nBlack and white line tone and gray halftone images: 600 DPI\n\nLine weights\n\nAdobe Photoshop images\n\nColor (RGB, CMYK) images: 2 pixels\n\nGrayscale images: 4 pixels\n\nAdobe Illustrator Images\n\nStroke weight: 0.5 points\n\nAPA offers authors the option to publish their figures online in color without the costs associated with print publication of color figures.\n\nThe same caption will appear on both the online (color) and print (black and white) versions. To ensure that the figure can be understood in both formats, authors should add alternative wording (e.g., ‚Äúthe red (dark gray) bars represent‚Äù) as needed.\n\nFor authors who prefer their figures to be published in color both in print and online, original color figures can be printed in color at the editor's and publisher's discretion provided the author agrees to pay:\n\n$900 for one figure\n\nAn additional $600 for the second figure\n\nAn additional $450 for each subsequent figure\n\nPermissions\n\nAuthors of accepted papers must obtain and provide to the editor on final acceptance all necessary permissions to reproduce in print and electronic form any copyrighted work, including test materials (or portions thereof), photographs, and other graphic images (including those used as stimuli in experiments).\n\nOn advice of counsel, APA may decline to publish any image whose copyright status is unknown.\n\nDownload Permissions Alert Form (PDF, 13KB)\n\nOpen Science Badges\n\nStarting in August 2017, articles are eligible for open science badges recognizing publicly available data, materials, and/or preregistration plans and analyses. These badges are awarded on a self-disclosure basis.\n\nAt submission, authors must confirm that criteria have been fulfilled in a signed badge disclosure form (PDF, 33KB) that must be submitted as supplemental material. If all criteria are met as confirmed by the editor, the form will then be published with the article as supplemental material.\n\nAuthors should also note their eligibility for the badge(s) in the cover letter.\n\nFor all badges, items must be made available on an open-access repository with a persistent identifier in a format that is time-stamped, immutable, and permanent. For the preregistered badge, this is an institutional registration system.\n\nData and materials must be made available under an open license allowing others to copy, share, and use the data, with attribution and copyright as applicable.\n\nAvailable badges are:\n\nOpen Data:\n\nAll data necessary to reproduce the reported results that are digitally shareable are made publicly available. Information necessary for replication (e.g., codebooks or metadata) must be included.\n\nOpen Materials:\n\nAll materials necessary to reproduce the reported results that are digitally shareable, along with descriptions of non-digital materials necessary for replication, are made publicly available.\n\nPreregistered:\n\nAt least one study's design has been preregistered with descriptions of (a) the research design and study materials, including the planned sample size; (b) the motivating research question or hypothesis; (c) the outcome variable(s); and (d) the predictor variables, including controls, covariates, and independent variables. Results must be fully disclosed. As long as they are distinguished from other results in the article, results from analyses that were not preregistered may be reported in the article.\n\nPreregistered+Analysis Plan:\n\nAt least one study's design has been preregistered along with an analysis plan for the research ‚Äî and results are recorded according to that plan.\n\nNote that it may not be possible to preregister a study or to share data and materials. Applying for open science badges is optional.\n\nPublication Policies\n\nFor full details on publication policies, including use of Artificial Intelligence tools, please see APA Publishing Policies.\n\nAPA policy prohibits an author from submitting the same manuscript for concurrent consideration by two or more publications.\n\nSee also APA Journals¬Æ Internet Posting Guidelines.\n\nAPA requires authors to reveal any possible conflict of interest in the conduct and reporting of research (e.g., financial interests in a test or procedure, funding by pharmaceutical companies for drug research).\n\nDownload Full Disclosure of Interests Form (PDF, 41KB)\n\nEthical Principles\n\nIt is a violation of APA Ethical Principles to publish \"as original data, data that have been previously published\" (Standard 8.13).\n\nIn addition, APA Ethical Principles specify that \"after research results are published, psychologists do not withhold the data on which their conclusions are based from other competent professionals who seek to verify the substantive claims through reanalysis and who intend to use such data only for that purpose, provided that the confidentiality of the participants can be protected and unless legal rights concerning proprietary data preclude their release\" (Standard 8.14).\n\nAPA expects authors to adhere to these standards. Specifically, APA expects authors to have their data available throughout the editorial review process and for at least 5 years after the date of publication.\n\nAuthors are required to state in writing that they have complied with APA ethical standards in the treatment of their sample, human or animal, or to describe the details of treatment.\n\nDownload Certification of Compliance With APA Ethical Principles Form (PDF, 26KB)\n\nThe APA Ethics Office provides the full Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct electronically on its website in HTML, PDF, and Word format.
