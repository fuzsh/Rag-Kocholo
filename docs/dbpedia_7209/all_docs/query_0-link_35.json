From lack of access to menstrual products to limited education about menstrual health, the barriers are many. This issue crucially impacts women and girls across the Lehigh Valley as well. This month we at VHP, along with our partners at Lehigh Valley Health Network and ALLENTOWN HEALTH BUREAU are collecting and distributing sanitary napkins, hygiene, and feminine care products to those in need. In an article published by Lehigh Valley News, Dr. Ashwini Kamath Mulki of LVHN Family Medicine and Valley Health Partners Family Health Center said, \"The groups are working on a Menstrual Equity map for the city (of Allentown). It will be a simple map for menstruators to locate free period products and for anyone in the community to donate sanitary products to support this cause.\" We encourage autonomy over your health and well-being. As a community we can give women and girls leverage by advocating to end period poverty. If you want to donate sanitary napkins, hygiene, and or feminine products call 610-437-7760 for more information or follow the link https://lnkd.in/eGHQC_KR.\n\n11\n\nDid you know this week is National Volunteer Week? Our latest blog post dives into the incredible impact of volunteering for families in need.

Here's how: - Addressing Immediate Needs: From warm winter clothing to household essentials, volunteers ensure families have what they need to thrive. -Fostering Empowerment and Dignity: By offering support with respect and compassion, volunteers empower individuals and honor their dignity. - Building Social Connections: Volunteering creates bonds within communities, fostering a sense of belonging for all involved. - Promoting Health and Well-Being: Access to basic items is crucial for overall well-being, and volunteers play a vital role in ensuring families have what they need to stay healthy. - Empowering Sustainable Change: By volunteering, we not only address immediate challenges but also work towards creating a more equitable society for all.

This #PrideMonth, we're looking further into pay disparities for LGBTQ+ individuals in America. According to a Human Rights Campaign Foundation analysis of nearly 7,000 full-time LGBTQ+ workers, this population earns roughly 90¬¢ to every dollar made by a typical worker (defined as the median wage for all workers in the U.S.). Black and Indigenous LGBTQ+ people earn even less than this average 90¬¢, making 80¬¢ and 70¬¢ on average, respectively. Trans men make an average of 70¬¢ to a typical worker‚Äôs dollar, and trans women make an average of 60¬¢. Our Level Up Campaign works to close the wage gap in Pittsburgh.

We do our best work when we partner with others, whether we collaborate with other community organizations or across teams within our own! Last Thursday, May 2nd, our Client Services, Talent Acquisition, Career Services, RI Small Business HUB, and workABILITY teams participated in a multi-employer Veteran's Job Fair at Community College of Rhode Island's Knight Campus in Warwick, hosted by The Providence VA VBA Regional Office, Veteran Readiness & Employment (VRE) Division, CCRI Student Veterans, and the Rhode Island Department of Labor & Training. The event connected veterans and others with career opportunities and resources, and our SkillsRI teams personally met with over 30 jobseekers and almost every employer in attendance! Events like these are essential for informing and supporting those who may have barriers to employment, like Rhode Island's veteran population, and you never know where or when any given team member may lend specialized support or connect for an opportunity for work outside of their typical purview. Bill Harold, Supported Employment Coordinator for workABILITY, spotted and caught up with DATTCO, INC, a transportation company that attended the event looking to recruit new hires. DATTCO recently partnered with and successfully hired a workABILITY candidate for a role as a School Bus Monitor/Aide, so Bill took the opportunity to explore ways to collaborate further by introducing DATTCO's hiring team to members of SkillsRI's Client Services team for additional sourcing and roles. #SkillsRI and #workABILITY thank all of our community partners, employer partners, and the sponsors of this event for their support in providing resources to the veteran community and so many others! It often takes only one person or one effort to make a difference in the lives of others, so together, we should expect the impact of our work will be far greater! If you're an employer seeking talent, contact the workABILITY team to join our mission of providing equal opportunities for all!
