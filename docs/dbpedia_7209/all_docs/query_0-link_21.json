Understand Me\n9. Mother\n10. Life Is On Television\n11. Skull Echo\n\nIt‘s a record about loneliness, about a singular perspective we‘re trapped in, that perhaps gets in the way of our ability to communicate with each other.\r\nJulia about the project: „Skull Echo is a story about time, perception and loneliness. About heads in which we are trapped, building our image of the world through our senses - full of uncertain\r\ninformation, selectively remembered and freely transformed. It is a story of longing for another person.“",

        "text": "1.\n\nCerebral Bliss 06:02\n\nOh God, I do it all again. Oh God, I worry you're not my friend. Your headlights blind me, I need but a spark, my eyes already used to the dark. I tried to swallow the gist of your song, but the salt from it's cries is biting my tongue. Why gift me mind to deny the divine? Quit building tension if there's no punch line. Oh God, Oh God, I pray, I call, I need to understand it all. My feet are bleeding, I've walked for so long. The road before me unravels like a tongue. Some say it's a yes, some say it's a no, some say don't ask, better not to know. I hear your tires grinding the tar, I eye your hot metal menacing from afar. Some say I'll fly, some say I will fall, some say I'll blow up, my head will roll... I'll fly I'll fall I'll fly Oh God, it's you, I see you now… Oh God, Oh God, I pray, I call, I need to understand it all. Is it my fall I'm trying to remain somewhat sane? Oh God, Oh God, I pray, I call, I need to understand it all. Is it my fall I'm trying to remain competently sane?\n\n2.\n\nInfinity Halt 03:37\n\nThe world's upside down, we've never been this far far far far. Fire to fuel and listen to the wheels grind the tar. Oh my love, the clocks go slower the faster we run run run. We just need a little moment, so shoot like a gun gun gun. It's gonna be a long drive, turn up the stereo! It's gonna be a long drive, turn up the stereo! Hold me close, never let me go. Hold me close, never let me go. Honey let's go light speed until infinity halt. All at once and not a single moment to spare. Swipe through the timeline, the world is standing still, we've everywhere. Oh my love, the clocks go slower the faster we run run run. If forever is a nightmare of a concept, I know we can make it fun.\n\n3.\n\nTime 03:55\n\nDarling I would be so inclined, I'd lose my mind but I ain't got time. Don't you give me that look, you are here too, you ain't got time, time has got you. If I have a heavy heart with worries of my own you come and are the shore to my storm again. The wonders are easy to see, but the logic is hard to trust. And I’m about to give in and it's about time, help me understand. If everything makes perfect sense it is just not for us to see, but between the seconds there are hours we are given. All of this technology baby is yet unable to measure the truth. But you could take my time and be forgiven. Go ahead, you can take it, you can take it, you can take it. Oh, I can take it, I can take it all, I can take it too. Oh, I can take it, I can take it all, I can take it. Don't you let the time, time, my time have one up on you.\n\n4.\n\nNostalgic 03:18\n\nGood luck selling your soul, there is not a single bidder. The world has simply moved on, no devils to consider. Oh, how sweet it would be to turn back the time, to that perfect song with the perfect rhyme, to a picture so familiar you could swear it feels like home. I look in your eyes and then, though I've never met you, you make me miss the days I've never known. Your eyes again... I've never met you, but I'm nostalgic for the past that's not my own. When thoughts dissolve in a haze in warm embrace of silence, I'd loose lose a couple of days burning cheeks for the televised violence. I go back to turning back the time, with a perfect love and the perfect crime, to the stories so familiar I could swear they're true.\n\n5.\n\nThe Odds 03:11\n\nYou look like you could use a drink. Silence’s a cheat, don't let it sing. Don't let it tell you what to think, don't let it fool you that all of the odds are stacked against you. When all of your notions crack in the middle, all of your guesses vex you a little, think of the odds, how out of the ordinary we are here at all. All of the fights, all the rights, all the riddles, we are stuck in here, in this design, we could see what it can do. Times we've been odd to one another... oh, how rare a gift you are. Oh, I know we're not always easy with each other, but come on, it’s worked this far. All of you notions crack in the middle, all of your guesses may vex me a little, but given the odds, how out of the ordinary we are here at all. All of the fights, all the rights, all the riddles, I am stuck in here, in this design with you. Let's see what it can do.\n\n6.\n\nWhich Way Is Now 02:23\n\n7.\n\nHouses Of Glass 05:43\n\nWhat matters is I know I'm right. Not a big deal to tell the good and the bad apart. Born into this code unified. Deep down inside I know I'm right. Houses and houses, and houses of glass, time in arrest, bodies first class. Houses on houses, on houses of glass, bulletproof coffins with fossils of us. To peak in, to look, oh, such a faux pas. Can't sneak inside, no, don't even try. I look through the window and what do I see? Everything around is out to get me. I look around and what do I see? Everything around me reminds me of me. Built in my likeness, built in my name. I am safe, I'm a god of the same. The glass in my chest beats with parental care, my heart is transparent for all who are there. In the depths of the branches of my family tree, my seed has a purpose, a reason to be. What matters is I know I'm right. Not a big deal to tell the good and the bad apart. Born into this code unified. Deep down inside I know I'm right. Houses on houses and houses of glass. Those who stand last, they write the past and the land where I stand is my birthright to keep - here's a paper with a stamp to put all doubts to sleep. No fear my dear, it's where I belong. No need to learn words to a foreign song. In the depths of the branches of my family tree, oh, finally, a reason to be.\n\n8.\n\nUnderstand Me 04:33\n\nUnderstand me, don't let go ’til a familiar light starts to show. The seeds we sow... we're here to face our acts, we're here to face the facts... Which one of your faces is that? which one of my facts is cold? Understand me! Understand me, don't let go. Breathe... breathe in and out... if it's as simple as that maybe we're as simple as that? Between your errands and your ghosts, between your yeses and your nos, I'm at the bottom, understand me, I'm new to this too. I've been made conscious just to witness my own doom. Oh, this burning fever to get back at you... but would it... would it hurt, my love? Oh, this burning fever to get back... talk to me in simple words, talk to me, don’t spare the words, I beg you... Understand me!\n\n9.\n\nMother 07:37\n\nMost days are easy, I'm hiding under the spells of lights, the lights, the lights in stereo. But some days my thoughts get busy, they hit like thunder, a thunder my skull can barely hold. No matter where I look, no matter how I move, the perspective never shifts, I'm in 2D. I am hiding under the spells of lights in stereo. Keep me from the thunder, a storm my heart can barely hold. If I could learn to get ahead, to be the driver of my own head. My body does what my body do, it knows what it knows, but oh, no, no, none of it is true. Oh mother, Oh mother, how much of me is you? Oh mother, Oh mother, how much of me is you? Now, most days are easy, I'm falling under the spells of work, the work, the work, the work that goes on. How to keep up with living, when all my senses conspire to twist what's right or wrong?\n\n10.\n\nLife Is On Television 03:35\n\nCity lights... holding my thoughts in bliss together... On and off... open my eyes, it is forever... Now is the only time... go run in circles through the lights, the lights, the la la lights and the lies, the lies and life is on television I have found. The life the la la life is nothing that happens to me I walk on ground. The truth, they say, will get you, holds the answers, only but a few are meant for you.\n\n11.\n\nSkull Echo 02:54"
