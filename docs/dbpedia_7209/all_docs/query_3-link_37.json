        "text": "Flora Urresti (Uresti) Aspiazu, in a report written in 2008 entitled, “Basques in Custer County,” attempts to document the history of the Basques in the Custer County area. Flora’s parents were immigrants and she was raised in the Mackay area. The Basque Museum & Cultural Center is thankful to Flora for these written memories as they help to document the presence of Basques in Custer County. The following is the report, as presented by Flora Urresti Aspiazu, with the modification of additional notes by Basque Museum & Cultural Center staff placed in brackets [ ].\n\nThe date when the first Basques arrived in Custer County is not known. The beginning of World War I (1914) brought an influx of Basques to the county.\n\nThe community of Basques in Custer Country represented Basques from the four Basque provinces in Spain: Araba, Bizkaia, Gipuzkoa, and Nafarroa. There were also a number of Basques from the French side of the Pyrenees Mountains.\n\nAlthough they spoke Basque dialects from their respective provinces, they understood each other. Born in Challis, Idaho on February 26, 1920, Flora spoke Basque as her first language. [Flora’s parents and four brothers lived in the White Knob mining community, which was located in the mountains four miles above the town of Mackay. In 1919 the family moved to Challis and in 1921 moved to Mackay where Flora grew up and her parents operated a boardinghouse]. She felt that growing up in a Basque boardinghouse hearing and understanding the various dialects was enriching.\n\nFlora believes that the influx of Basques to the area was due to job opportunities in three areas:\n\nMining\n\nSheep ranching\n\nUtah Construction Company – they built the Mackay dam. [Basques were involved in this]\n\nFlora Urresti [Uresti], in her memoirs, states the following:\n\n“The Bayhorse and Livingston mines were located in the White Cloud Mountains area. The Clayton Silver Mines were located on the East Fork of the Salmon River area. Other mines were located in Goldberg and Patterson in the Pahsimeroi Valley. The Basques employed in the Bayhorse, Livingston, Clayton, Goldberg and Patterson mines were mostly single men.\n\nThe largest mining operations were located in the Mackay area. The Empire Mining company offices and smelter were located about a mile west of Mackay. Their mine was located four miles west of Mackay in the Pioneer Mountains near the mining community of White Knob.\n\nThe U.S. Mining and Smelting Company of Salt Lake City, Utah operated lead mines in the White Knob area. Their ore was trucked to Mackay and then shipped, by rail, to Utah smelters.\n\nThe ore from Clayton, Bayhorse, Livingston and Patterson was trucked to Mackay and from Mackay was shipped by rail to Utah smelters.\n\nThe images below are from pay record books from the Empire mines. You will see several Basque names in the entries (Menchaca, Saguadi, Serriga, Sorrosua, Icasuriga, Argoitia, Uresti). For more images of the record books, see the photo gallery.\n\nFlora Urresti [Uresti] writes that the largest concentration of Basques in Custer County was in Mackay and in White Knob. The Basque boardinghouse played a very important role in both the lives of the single men and the families. The boardinghouse was not only a home for the single men, it was a gathering place for the families to socialize, to retain their identity, their language and preserve their customs. The boardinghouse was a part of the Old World home in the New World. In 1914 and 1915 Basque families joined numerous other ethnic families to make their homes on the hillsides of White Knob in order to be close to the workplace.\n\nElquezabal boardinghouse In 1914 there were two boardinghouses in Mackay. One was operated by Jose Elquezabal and his wife. Mr. Elquezabal was employed by the Utah Construction Company. Mrs. Elquezabal passed away in the early 1920s and the family moved to Pocatello.\n\nDiaz boardinghouse The second boarding house was owned by a family whose name is not remembered. The wife’s name was Beatriz. [The 1920 Census shows the Diaz Family – wife’s name is Beatriz. Emil, head of family, identified as a miner.] They moved from Mackay in the mid-1920s.\n\nYriondo, then Uresti (Urresti) Boardinghouse Justo Yriondo and Isabel Unamuno [NOTE: Utah death records list her name as Ysabel Sarria] met each other in Shoshone. Justo, who was from the province of Gipuzkoa [and] worked on a sheep ranch. Isabel was from the province of Bizkaia. She worked as a maid in the home of a physician. Isabel learned to speak fluent English. After their marriage, Justo and Isabel moved to White Knob in 1916. Their daughter Helen was born in White Knob in 1917. The family moved to Mackay in 1917 where they built a boardinghouse. Justo continued working in White Knob and Isabel operated the boardinghouse.\n\nIn the summer of 1921 the Yriondos leased the boardinghouse to Polonio and Maria Carmen (Bengoechea) Uresti. The Yriondos moved to Park City, Utah where they built another Basque boardinghouse. Justo worked in the Park City mines.\n\nPolonio Urresti [Uresti] and Maria Carmen Bengoechea, who were from the province of Bizkaia, met in a Basque boardinghouse in a mining town in Owyhee County. Polonio worked in the mine and Maria Carmen worked as a maid in the boardinghouse. After their marriage in 1912, they lived in Delamar, Idaho until the mine closed in early 1913. They moved to Mountain Home where sons Bolen and Marcel were born. When the family lived in Mountain Home, Polonio worked for a sheep company.\n\nIn the spring of 1915, the family arrived in Mackay to make their home in White Knob. Their sons Martin and Paul were born in White Knob. The family doctor advised Polonio to leave the mines for health reasons. In 1919 the family moved to Challis to work for Dr. Phelps’ Sheep Company. Flora Urresti was born on the Phelps Ranch. The log home where she was born was still on the ranch in 2008.\n\nIn the summer of 1921, the Uresti [Urresti] family moved to Mackay where Polonio and Maria Carmen leased the Yriondo boardinghouse and Polonio returned to White Knob to work in the mines. Mary Uresti [Urresti] was born in the Yriondo home.\n\nSoloaga. In the summer of 1926 the Soloaga family of Shoshone purchased the Yriondo property. Domingo Soloaga and his wife Antonia owned a boardinghouse in nearby Shoshone, Idaho. They partnered with a cousin from the Soloaga family to purchase the boardinghouse in Mackay.\n\nPolonio & Mari Carmen (Bengoechea) Uresti [Urresti] then renovated the rooming house behind the Custer Hotel. All the boarders from the Yriondo home moved with them.Gloria Uresti [Urresti] was born in this home.\n\nIn 1926 there were many single Basque men boarding in the company boardinghouse in White Knob. Again there were two boardinghouses in Mackay. So the single men moved to Mackay to live in the Uresti [Urresti] and Soloaga homes.\n\nThe Esteban and Julia (Elordi) Aspiazu Family\n\nMr. Aspiazu was from the province of Gipuzkoa. When he was single he served in the Spanish Cavalry in Cuba in the Spanish American War. After the war, he returned to Gipuzkoa. He was restless. He and a group of Basques from Gipuzkoa and Bizkaia crossed the Atlantic Ocean to Nova Scotia, traveled across Canada and went to Alaska. They worked in the gold mines in Ketchikan and Juneau. After a few years he returned home to work with his father, who was a livestock buyer. They traveled throughout Gipuzkoa and Bizkaia. In Bizkaia he met and married Julia Elordi. [They had a son, James while living in the Basque Country.]\n\nOnce again the mines beckoned and in 1910 Esteban found his way to Delamar, Owyhee County, Idaho where numerous Basques were working in the mines. (link to Delamar, Idaho)\n\nIn 1911, Julia (Elordi) Aspiazu and [their son], James Aspiazu joined Esteban Aspiazu in Delamar. Their daughter, Gloria, was born in Delamar. When the mines closed, they moved to Jordan Valley, Oregon where their daughter, Estella, was born. The family also lived in Boise for a short time. In 1915 the family moved to White Knob where Esteban was employed in the U. S. Mining and Smelting lead mines. Their daughter, Angela, was born in White Knob.\n\nTransportation from Mackay to White Knob had improved. Families moved to Mackay and the men could travel back and forth to work in White Knob. The Aspiazus moved to Mackay in 1919. Their daughter, Pilar, who died in infancy, was born in Mackay. Pilar Aspiazu is buried in Mt. McCaleb Cemetery [in Mackay, Idaho].\n\nThe family moved to Bingham Canyon, Utah in 1926 where Esteban continued to be employed in Bingham Canyon by the U.S. Mining and Smelting Company. In later years, [their oldest daughter], Gloria returned to Idaho where she met and married Pedro Batis who was from Bizkaia. They made their home in Ketchum. Gloria passed away in 1993.\n\nWhen [their oldest son], James Aspiazu retired from Kennecott Copper Corporation, he and [his wife] Flora Urresti Aspiazu made their home in Boise, Idaho. James passed away in 1998. Estella Aspiazu Zubizarreta was living in Colorado and her sister Angela Aspiazu Arriz was living in Bingham Canyon, Utah in 2008.\n\nThe David Inchausti and Epifania Lamikiz Inchausti Family\n\nDavid Inchausti had worked for Bengoechea. He stayed and was employed as the Drake foreman. David returned to Bizkaia and married Epifania Lamikiz [Lamiquis/Lamiquiz]. David returned to Challis and resumed his work as the foreman.\n\nIn 1929 David’s wife, Epifania “Epi”(Lamikiz/[Lamiquis/Lamiquiz]) Inchausti, and their daughter, Rose, arrived in Mackay and stayed in the Urresti [Uresti] boardinghouse for several days before making their home on the Drake Ranch.\n\nThe Inchausti daughters, Dorothy and Mary Louise, were born in Mackay,[Idaho] in the Urresti [Uresti] boardinghouse. Their daughter, Josephine, was born on the Drake Ranch. In the mid 1930’s the Inchausti family moved to Pocatello and later to Hailey. [David and Epi had seven children: David Inchausti, Jr., Dorothy Inchausti Ansotegui, Mary Louise Inchasuti McGonigal, Josephine Inchausti Head, Rose Mary Inchausti Mallory, Juanita Inchausti Thompson and Julia Inchausti Stevens]\n\n[At the time Flora wrote this in 2008] – Dorothy (Inchausti) Ansotegui and her family live in Boise. Two of Dorothy’s daughters own the Basque restaurant “Epis” in Meridian. Dorothy’s son, Daniel, is the owner of the Bar Gernika and Basque Market on Grove Street. [According to Dorothy’s obituary, Dorothy Inchausti Ansotegui married Domingo Ansotegui in 1950. They had five children together (Bonnie, Christine, Gina, Daniel and Toni). Domingo died in 1984 and Dorothy died in 2019. Ansotegui relatives continue to own and operate Epi’s in Meridian, Dan has since sold both Bar Gernika and the Basque Market and this year (2021) he opened a new restaurant in downtown Boise called Ansots.]\n\nJosephine Inchausti Head and her husband, Darris [Derris], are retired and live near Boise. [Juanita Inchausti married Richard Thompson in 1965, Julie Inchausti married David Stevens in 1966, David Inchausti, Jr. married Jeanne Derring in 1962, Mary Louise Inchausti married George McGonigal in 1950, and Rose Mary Inchasuti married William Mallory in 1946]."
