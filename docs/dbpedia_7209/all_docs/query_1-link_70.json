        "text": "Julia Marcell's song 'Married To Life' delves into the complexities of marital commitment and the internal conflict of harboring feelings for someone else while being in a seemingly perfect marriage. The lyrics paint a picture of a protagonist who is married to a woman described as a 'beautiful wife' who is dedicated to her family, raising children, and managing household duties. The repetition of these daily routines and her constant presence by the protagonist's side suggests a life of stability and domesticity.\n\nHowever, as the song progresses, it becomes clear that there is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction. The protagonist admits to loving his wife, yet acknowledges her imperfections and his own deceit. The line 'I lie all the time' reveals a deep-seated guilt and the struggle of living a double life. The emotional turmoil is further amplified by the protagonist's confession of being in love with someone else, a person who occupies his thoughts constantly, even during intimate moments with his wife. This internal conflict leads to a sense of entrapment, as indicated by the lyrics describing the difficulty of 'pretending, smiling and sleeping together.'\n\nThe song's title, 'Married To Life,' could be interpreted as a metaphor for the inescapable nature of the protagonist's situation. He is bound not only to his wife but to the life he has built with her, which now feels like a facade due to his unfaithful emotions. The haunting repetition of the word 'love' at the end of the song underscores the tragedy of a love that has been reduced to mere memories and a photograph, hinting at the loss of genuine connection within the marriage."
