Her work was award a Polityka’s Passport in the Popular Music category, a Fryderyk award in the Alternative Music category and a Grzegorz Ciechowski Artistic Award of the City of Toruń. Julia Marcell’s albums have been appreciated by the public, journalists and those connected with culture – in Poland, Austria and Switzerland. The latest album “Skull Echo” had its world premiere on Long Branch Records.\n\nStill many doctors don’t know about CCHS and lack of proper diagnosis of a newborn child might lead to serious development defects, or even, in worse case scenario, to death\n\nThe more people know about CCHS, the bigger chances we have to find the cure.\n\nIf you don’t need our album, but still want to support our Polish CCHS Foundation? You can make a donation to support medical research on finding the cure for CCHS. Read more about the research.\n\nYou can make a money transfer directly to the account of our Foundation:\n\nPolish CCHS Foundation “Lift the curse”\n\nIBAN: PL 57 1140 2004 0000 3802 7917 8525\n\nBIC/SWIFT: BREXPLPWMBK\n\nor donate via Paypal:"
