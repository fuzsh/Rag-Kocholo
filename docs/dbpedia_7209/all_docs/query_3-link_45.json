        "text": "I first discovered Dave Eggers when I encountered A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. In it, Eggers writes of the deaths of both parents to cancer, a matter of weeks apart. Eggers, then a college student, must now become guardian to his eight-year-old brother. Later, I read What is the What, another nonfiction book, that tells the story of Valentino Achak Deng, a survivor of civil war in the South Sudan.\n\nEggers has written other books as well. In addition, he is the founder of McSweeney’s, independent publishing company. McSweeney’s publishes McSweeney’s Quarterly Concern, a journal of new writing in addition to publishing books and a monthly magazine, The Believer.\n\nNot content with writing his own books and promoting the writing of others, Eggers is also cofounder of 826 National which is a group of “eight tutoring centers around the country and ScholarMatch, a nonprofit organization that connects students with resources, schools and donors to make college possible.” Whew! Eggers is a busy man.\n\nNot only is he a writer, Eggers is also an artist. His work has been exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, the Nevada Museum of Art, and other galleries. His awards are too numerous to mention, but they include the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\nHe has begun writing books for young readers: Her Right Foot, This Bridge Will Not Be Gray, and The Wild Things.\n\nThe Lifters, published in 2018, stars Gran Flowerpetal and his family. The story opens with Granite Flowerpetal, Gran, moving from his home on the ocean to his father’s birthplace, many miles away. His father is unable to get work as a mechanic where they live, so they move in hopes of finding work. They also have a house in Carousel, the town where his father has grown up.\n\nGran decides that in his new town and new school, he will become Gran instead of Granite because he tires of explaining how he got his name. His father’s explanation is that with a surname like Flowerpetal, Granite needs a strong name. The family consists of father, mother, Gran, and younger sister Maisie. Mother is in a wheelchair, but Gran does not know the cause of his mother’s paralysis. He can remember when she could walk, but he has no memory of when her legs became twisted or why.\n\nGran walks Maisie to her new elementary school and then goes on to his middle school. School has already been in session for a month, so Gran is behind his classmates. In addition to being new, Gran feels left out. In fact, he feels invisible to both students and teachers.\n\nOne afternoon, he decides he must really be invisible, so he walks into the school’s decidedly hard wall outside. Gran realizes “the pain of bricks against one’s head cannot be overstated. Given that bricks are quite solid.” Catalina Catalan, a classmate, rescues him from the wall and wipes the blood off his face with her flannel shirt.\n\nCatalina states, “You just walked into a building” as if Gran does not realize what he has done.\n\nGran has noticed Catalina in history class. She always wears the same clothing: a Ruth Bader Ginsberg t-shirt, jeans, a flannel shirt tied around her waist with the sleeves dangling, and (usually) dirty boots. At first, Gran does not know whose face is on the t-shirt, but he later realizes it is Ruth Bader Ginsberg.\n\nAt that moment, Gran becomes acutely aware of Catalina and wants to know more about her. She is, after all, the only person in school who has noticed him. When Gran tries following Catalina, she disappears as if into thin air.\n\nThat disappearance only intrigues him more about Catalina. On another day, he follows her again. This time, he is certain she uses a handle to open a door into the hillside and that she disappears into the tunnel of the hill. He even sees the tiny twinkling lights like Christmas lights in the tunnel.\n\nGran also makes another discovery in the school building when he walks into an unlocked door where all sorts of equipment and furniture are stored. There, he meets El Duque, the Duke. The Duke invites Gran to stay and eat his lunch in the room. Since the Duke represents one of the few people who seem to see him, Gran stays. This meeting of the Duke will be important later in the story and Gran continues to visit the Duke at lunch time on school days.\n\nGran sees carousel horses and the poles which attach the horses to the carousel itself in the Duke’s rooms. When he asks the Duke about them, he learns that the town has been dependent upon the Catalan Carousel Company.\n\nGran’s real obsession, however, is Catalina. He sees she DOES open the hillside with some kind of handle. He then decides he needs a handle in order to open the door and follow her. He spends his savings of $18.00 at a flea market to purchase a handle only to find it does not work. Then he remembers the old trunk in the attic of the house his great-great-grandfather built. It contains a “mess of old tools and scraps of metal. There were dark metal fragments of a dozen shapes and tools that neither Gran nor his father had ever seen before. There was a giant C, about the size of Gran’s hand.”\n\nGran remembers that C and rushes home to take it from the attic. In his heart, he knows it will be the handle he needs for opening the door where Catalina goes.\n\nIn his meetings with the Duke, Gran learns the town of Carousel used to the world-famous home of carousel horses made by Catalan Carousel Company. Everyone in the town worked for Catalan in one way or another. Then rollercoasters came along and carousels became outmoded. The townspeople fell upon hard times. People feel depressed, buildings begin collapsing, and work is hard to find.\n\nWill Gran discover how and why Catalina Catalan slips into the seemingly impervious hillside? What will become of the town and its people? Eggers has written a tale for the third to sixth grade readers that will capture their imagination as it did mine. Eggers also infuses the story with humor. The fact that Catalina wears a Ruth Bader Ginsberg t-shirt is amusing. The dialogue is also fresh and often funny.\n\nDave Eggers maintains a Web site at this link: https://daveeggers.net/dave-eggers/.\n\nThe Book Whisperer makes eclectic choices in books to read. Keeping up with various genres is important along with being somewhat knowledgeable about YA and juvenile fiction. Knowing about current picture books is also relevant. Innovations in all genres are worthy of attention; readers should not only know about new releases, but also return to old favorites. In other words, reading offers extensive variety.\n\nTo that end, when I discovered Framed! by Hanes Ponti, I felt compelled to read it. Who could resist learning about twelve-year-old Florian Bates who relates the following information on page one:\n\n“My name’s Florian Bates. I’m twelve years old and a seventh grader at Alice Deal Middle School in Washington, DC. My two favorite foods are pizza and egg rolls. I’m on the student council, I’m in the Scrabble club, and I plan to try out for soccer. I also work for the FBI.”\n\nBecause of his parents’ jobs, Florian has moved a great deal in his life. He’s newly arrived in Washington, DC when he meets Margaret Campbell, a neighbor his age who welcomes Florian and his family with her homemade chocolate chip cookies. Quickly, Margaret and Florian become good friends.\n\nFlorian has developed a process he calls TOAST: Theory of All Small Things. Florian observes small things and adds them up to discover bigger things, like putting a puzzle together. Think the TV show Psyche and Shawn Spencer who helped the police solve crimes. Only Shawn pretended to be psychic, receiving clues. In truth, he was using Florian’s TOAST to observe people and situations in order to solve the crime.\n\nWhen Florian tells Margaret about TOAST, she immediately wants Florian to teach her how to put the small things together to solve a puzzle. Florian is thrilled by this request because often other kids are put off by his observations. Also, the fact that Florian has moved a great deal means that he has few friends.\n\nIf you want to know how Florian starts working for the FBI, you must read Framed! Then follow up with other books in the series. Florian and Margaret are both engaging characters who take challenges head-on and solve puzzles, providing information grownups have overlooked or discounted.\n\nAdding to the story, Florian’s mother is an art restorer, so readers learn about famous paintings along the way. His dad is an expert in security and has brought the family to DC where he is working to update security for the National Gallery in the city. One might guess, then, that the first crime involves art – forgery? Theft?\n\nFlorian and Margaret develop a strong friendship. As Florian teaches Margaret more about TOAST, she becomes adept at putting small things together to see the big picture too. Margaret tells Florian that she has a “big idea. It’s epic.” She continues, “I’m just going to say three words: The New FBI.” When Florian asks what she means, she responds: “Florian Bates Investigations.”\n\nFlorian will continue to be a middle school student and work for the real FBI, but he and Margaret will develop their own cases and solve them through the New FBI: Florian Bates Investigations.\n\nThe dialogue in Framed! is funny and inventive. The character are warm and fascinating. The stories are simply great fun.\n\nJames Ponti provides more information about his life and writings on his Web site:\n\nhttps://www.jamesponti.com/books.\n\nLet me begin this review of Winterhouse by Ben Guterson by saying that I love the book. It is for 9 – 12-year-old readers. For those who like to read and enjoy word play, Guterson has outdone himself by providing a word ladder at the beginning of each chapter. In addition, Elizabeth Somers and Freddie Knox, both 11 and who meet at Winterhouse, are word lovers and enjoy challenging each other.\n\nPart One of Winterhouse begins with this ladder of words:\n\nFar to the North and plenty of\n\nSnow\n\nShow\n\nShot\n\nSoot\n\nBoot\n\nBook\n\nWinterhouse is the first of a planned trilogy. The Secret of Winterhouse will be out in 2019. The third book is planned, but no dates are mentioned as yet for its release.\n\nIn the first few pages, readers meet Elizabeth, an orphan, who lives with her distant relatives Aunt Purdy and Uncle Burlap. When Elizabeth was four, her parents died in a fireworks accident on July 4, according to Aunt Purdy. Elizabeth has no memory of the accident. Elizabeth goes to live with these distant relatives of her father’s; she calls them aunt and uncle.\n\nVery like the Dursleys in the Harry Potter series, Aunt Purdy and Uncle Burlap resent having Elizabeth in their shabby, rundown home. Aunt Purdy constantly reminds Elizabeth that she costs them money. Aunt Purdy begrudges Elizabeth every morsel of food and every bit of clothing as well. As with Harry Potter, Elizabeth also has special powers, powers just beginning to manifest themselves.\n\nOn the last day of school before the Christmas holidays, Elizabeth arrives at Aunt Purdy and Uncle Burlap’s to find an envelope taped to the locked front door. The note states:\n\n“We informed you several times we would be going on a three-week getaway and you would not be staying alone while we are gone, so you won’t be surprised to find this letter. The house is locked tight. There is a ticket for the 6:20 train north in this envelope. Catch that train, and when you get off in the morning at Sternhaven, there will be a ticket waiting for you at the bus station. Get on the bus that goes to the Winterhouse Hotel — they will be expecting you. Here’s three dollars in case you need anything on the way. You’ll get another ticket to come back after the new year. Don’t cause trouble for anyone. None of your nonsense!”\n\nIn addition, Aunt Purdy had put “three of her shirts, two pairs of socks, a pair of pants, and some under garments” into a plastic bag and left it on the doorknob. Elizabeth has her school backpack and four library books the school librarian has allowed her to check out for the holidays. Elizabeth also carries a notebook and pen in her backpack.\n\nElizabeth keeps notes on a wide variety of topics; some of which are listed below:\n\nReasons Why I Do Not like My Aunt and Uncle\n\nTop Ten Most Amazing Days of My Life\n\nThings Uncle Burlap Says That Make No Sense\n\nThings Aunt Purdy Says Are True, But Aren’t.\n\nElizabeth loves to read, is good at word puzzles, and enjoys anagrams.\n\nElizabet sets off for her adventure. She sleeps most of the night on the train. On the bus, however, she encounters two strange individuals who are riding the bus behind her. The man and woman are sinister-looking, dressed in dark clothing, and they look evil to Elizabeth. Much to Elizabeth’s surprise, the two get off the bus with her at Winterhouse.\n\nWinterhouse is a large, beautifully furnished hotel. Elizabeth is greeted by Jackson, a bellhop, who escorts her to her room. She also meets Mr. Norbridge Falls, owner of the hotel. Norbridge shows Elizabeth the candy kitchen and gives her the famous Winterhouse candy called Flurschen which is much like Turkish Delight, but Flurschen is a special recipe made only at Winterhouse, a recipe perfected by Norbridge’s grandfather, the original owner of the hotel.\n\nElizabeth is delighted to learn the hotel has a library on the same floor with her room. She looks forward to exploring there.\n\nThe next day, Elizabeth is summoned to breakfast along with the other guests. She chooses a table at the back of the dining room, near the door. A boy her age sits with her. She asks him if that is his family’s table and if he wants her to move. He tells her he is alone in the hotel for the duration of the holidays and that he has spent the last several Christmases there in the hotel alone. His name is Freddy Knox.\n\nElizabeth learns that Freddy also loves word ladders and anagrams. They begin challenging each other immediately and find they are evenly matched. Thus, the friendship between Elizabeth and Freddy begins.\n\nOf course, the hotel holds secrets. Naturally, Elizabeth begins to discover the secrets and involves Freddy in solving the mystery. On her first full day, Elizabeth discovers a book published in 1897: A Guide for Children: Games, Secrets, Pastimes, and More by Riley Sweth Granger. The book had slipped behind other books on the shelf, so Elizabeth pulls it out. For some reason, she feels compelled to take the book even though it is in the reference section and should not be removed from the library.\n\nElizabeth discovers the Vigenere Cipher in the book; Freddy is already familiar with the Vigenere Cipher, but the two of them use it to exchange secret notes.\n\nAs with any mystery, Elizabeth and Freddy do encounter some danger. Freddy asks Elizabeth to return Granger’s book to the library, but Elizabeth cannot quite make herself do it. She knows the book holds the key to solving a greater mystery surrounding the hotel. In the end, readers will not be surprised to learn that Elizabeth has some connection to the Winterhouse Hotel and to Norbridge Falls.\n\nBen Guterson taught high school and middle school students in New Mexico and Colorado for ten years. Then he joined Microsoft as a program manager. Winterhouse is his first book.\n\nGuterson’s Web site yields more information on him and his work and includes his blog: http://benguterson.com/.\n\nReviewers have called Winterhouse “an enchanting urban fantasy … set in a magical hotel full of secrets.”\n\nChloe Bristol has illustrated Winterhouse with back and white drawings.\n\nThanks to my friend Theresa for suggesting The Secret of Nightingale Wood. She has suggested several good choices to me, and she knows I enjoy reading books for all ages. I am glad to have discovered The Secret of Nightingale Wood through her recommendation.\n\nThe Secret of Nightingale Wood, Lucy Strange’s first novel, combines fairytales, myths and effective storytelling to create a compelling story for eight – twelve-year-olds. Henrietta, always called Henry, and her mother, father, baby sister, and Nanny Jane have moved from London into the countryside, near the village of Little Birdham. The family is renting a home called Hope House. Though a bit neglected, the house is sturdy and accommodating for the family. The name Hope House gives readers the first clue that while Henry may encounter difficulties at first that hope is around the corner, especially when Henry takes matters into her own hands.\n\nThe story is set in 1919. The only modern convenience in Hope House is the telephone which Henry is not allowed to answer or use. Strange’s setting of the story in 1919 gives her opportunity to develop Henry’s thoughts and character through her actions, memories, and books, especially the lovely book of fairytales Robert had given her for her birthday shortly before his death.\n\nThe family is in distress because Henry’s older brother Robert has died a year before the move. His death has been very hard on the whole family as one would imagine. Baby Roberta, affectionately called Piglet, is born the day after Robert’s funeral. The whole family suffers from Robert’s loss, but Mama must be experiencing post-partum depression, no doubt related to losing Robert.\n\nFather hopes that the move will improve Mama’s condition and allow the family to heal. Sadly, Father receives word he must travel to Italy for his engineering job, leaving Nanny Jane in charge of Henry and Piglet while Mama is being treated by an unkind and somewhat frightening Dr. Hardy with threats of a Dr. Chilvers joining in the treatment or of sending Mama and possibly Henry herself to an asylum run by the mysterious Dr. Chilvers.\n\nStrange’s choice of names for the two doctors fits right in with the sense of a fairytale she has created. Dr. Hardy, a hard man, represents a bogeyman, one who threatens Henry’s family. Chilvers’s name itself suggests chills running up and down one’s spine. What will he do to Mama if she is taken away to the asylum?\n\nReaders are somewhat suspicious of Nanny Jane because she appears to be in league with Dr. Hardy. Dr. Hardy’s method of curing Mama is to keep her sedated in a locked room. Of course, Henry wants to be able to see her mother and to take Piglet into her mother’s room too. Both of these wishes are denied. Resourceful Henry, however, finds the key to Mama’s room in the kitchen hanging with a number of other keys to the old house.\n\nMrs. Berry comes to Hope House to cook for the family every day; her husband, Mr. Berry, also does odd jobs around the property. He will occasionally drive Nanny Jane, Piglet, and Henry to the beach for an afternoon picnic. Both Mr. and Mrs. Berry are kindly people and become important to Henry in resolving the problems her family is experiencing.\n\nAs with so many fairytales, The Secret of Nightingale Wood has a witch or at least a scary-looking woman living deep in the woods behind Hope House. And, as if often the case with such stories, the witch turns out to be not a witch at all, but someone who helps Henry in her quest to resolve her family’s difficulties. The woman’s secret identity will help Henry unravel several mysteries. The woman herself overcomes her own sorrow to help Henry in her time of need.\n\nHenry enjoys spending time in the garden of Hope House. As she becomes more intrigued with the woods, she ventures into them where she discovers an illusive woman living in a caravan nestled in the woods.\n\nChildren will enjoy seeing Henry develop her skills of investigation. They will also enjoy Henry’s defiance against the two evil doctors who have imprisoned her mother.\n\nKirkus provides this review of The Secret of Nightingale Wood: “In an imaginative, compelling first-person narration, Henry wraps her story in fairy tales, exposing her guilt, grief, isolation, and fear as she unravels the stunning secrets of Nightingale Wood.” Publisher’s Weekly calls Henry “a brave heroine.”\n\nStrange has been an elementary school English teacher. In addition, Strange has been an actor, singer, and storyteller. Those experiences serve her well in her debut novel: The Secret of Nightingale Wood.\n\nLucy Strange gives advice to aspiring writers. She tells them to “find a story that you need to tell and give it time to settle and develop in your mind. I find a lot of writing needs to take place in my head before I can start actually writing.” To see all five tips, visit the link below:https://www.chickenhousebooks.com/blog/nanowrimo-lucy-strange/.\n\nReaders familiar with The Baby-sitters Club series will be well aware of Ann M. Martin who has written the series along with The Main Street Series and stand-alone books. Rain Reign is Martin’s most recent stand-alone book which stars Rose Howard and her dog Rain whose name Rose chose because it has a homonym: Rain/reign.\n\nRose loves homonyms. Her own name is a homonym: Rose/rows. Rose seeks out homonyms as often as she can and talks about them until her father tells her to be quiet or her teacher leads Rose onto another subject. Rose and her father live in a small house on a street with no other houses. Rose’s mother is gone; Rose believes her mother ran away because Rose has a diagnosis: Asperger’s Syndrome.\n\nRose narrates her own story and tells readers in Chapter 1 that she likes three things most especially: 1. Words (especially homonyms); 2. Rules; and 3. Numbers (especially prime numbers). Rose is almost eleven years old and in the fifth grade. Mrs. Leibler, Rose’s aide, sits by Rose and touches Rose on the arm if Rose is out of control, or Mrs. Leibler asks, “Rose, do you need to step into the hall for a minute?”\n\nMrs. Leibler has been teaching Rose some conversation starters to help Rose be more social with her classmates. Rose is troubled by the fact that Mrs. Kushel, the fifth grade teacher, and Mrs. Leibler have asked Rose’s father Wesley to have monthly meetings about Rose’s behavior. Wesley reads the notes that Rose brings home, and he impatiently blurts out, “Rose, for god’s sake, keep your mouth closed when you think of a homonym,” or sometimes he asks, “Do you see any of the other kids clapping their hands over their ears and screaming when they hear the fire alarm?”\n\nAs a result of her interests, Rose has no friends because the other children do not understand her obsessions. In fact, the grownups in her life do not either, not Mrs. Kushel, Mrs. Leibler, or Wesley. The one person who is sympathetic is Weldon, her dad’s younger brother. Weldon takes Rose to school every day and picks her up in the afternoon. His work in the office of a construction firm allows him to skip his lunch so that he can pick Rose up and take her home each day, and then he returns to work.\n\nWesley, Rose’s dad, is somewhat unreliable. He works sometimes at J&R Garage, but he mostly spends time at the Luck of the Irish pub, located just down the street from J&R Garage and Rose’s home. Wesley and Weldon grew up in foster homes; luckily, they never had to live in separate homes, but they spent a great deal of time moving from one foster home to another. The two brothers remain loyal to one another.\n\nRose’s story truly begins when her father brings home what he thinks is a stray dog as a gift to Rose. Rain is most likely a yellow Lab mix and she weighs 23 pounds. Because Rain has no collar, Wesley assumes the dog is lost and the owners are irresponsible. Rose is delighted with the dog and chooses the name Rain (reign) because her father found Rain in the rain behind the Luck of the Irish pub.\n\nDespite her diagnosis, Rose is a reliable narrator. She likes rules and intends for everyone to follow them. She tells her story honestly, giving her own foibles as well as describing her father’s difficulties; she does so without judgment, simply stating what she sees.\n\nThe story becomes a mystery when Wesley lets Rain out into a storm to go to the bathroom. Unfortunately, Rain’s collar is hanging in the kitchen. The storm turns out to be a dangerous one with trees down, electricity out, and flooding throughout the area. Rose, understandably upset, asks her father repeatedly why he let Rain out without her collar.\n\nAfter several days of missing Rain, Rose develops a plan to find her. She draws up a list of all the area animal shelters and writes down the phone numbers. She calls the shelters, giving her name and a full description of Rain. Having to put herself forward is a struggle for Rose, but she knows that finding Rain is worth all her effort.\n\nMartin has captured Rose’s voice effectively. Readers will be engaged with the story quickly and will be hoping all along that Rose will find Rain. What happens will surprise readers and show Rose’s great strength.\n\nSchool Library Journal describes Rose’s story as “often heartbreaking, her matter-of-face narration provides moments of humor. Readers will empathize with Rose, who finds strength and empowerment through her unique way of looking at the world.”\n\nRead about Ann M.

After working on the sixth floor floor writing all day, Mark Twain would go downstairs to the second floor suite where his family awaited him. His daughters begged for a story. Twain often told them stories, but he rarely wrote them down. The story that becomes The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine by Mark Twain with help from Philip and Erin Stead is the one story Twain told his daughters and kept notes on even though he left it unfinished.\n\nClara and Susy would choose a magazine and then a picture from the magazine for Twain to use as the basis of the story. The girls would often choose unusual pictures. For the The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine, Clara and Susy chose an anatomical figure drawing. Twain tried to persuade them to choose another picture, but they wanted that one. Twain says, “I bent myself to the task” and started the story of Johnny.\n\nClara and Susy liked the story so much that Twain continued it for the next five evenings. Later, Twain wrote notes on the story and continued adding to them for several years before abandoning the notes to his collection of writings. When Twain died, all the notes went to the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. John Bird, a Twain scholar, searched the archives hoping to put together a Twain cookbook. When he saw “Oleomargarine” in one of the lists, he thought it could help with his cookbook project.\n\nOf course, The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine turns out to have nothing to do with cooking. Dr. Bird did find references in Twain’s journal to the story. When Dr. Bird showed the notes to Dr. Cindy Lovell, who was then Executive Director of the Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford, CN, the two of them decided finding someone to complete and illustrate the story would be a wise idea.\n\nThat’s where Philip and Erin Stead, husband and wife team, entered the picture. The two had won the Caldecott Medal for A Sick Day for Amos McGee, their first published book. Philip is the writer and Erin the illustrator. Below, see Erin and Philip at work in their studio.\n\nPraise for The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine has come from many quarters. USA Today says The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine “will capture the imaginations of readers of all ages.” Words like graceful, humorous, and poignant all appear in the reviews.\n\nThe Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine contains myth, dragons, talking animals, a missing prince, and Johnny, a lonely boy.\n\nThe Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine beautifully illustrated by Erin Stead provides adults and children alike with a story brought down from 1879. Since it contains elements children over the ages have loved, it will continue to delight those who read it. The Washington Post reminds readers that The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine “should inspire readers young and old to seek further adventures with Twain.”\n\nErin Stead’s Website: https://erinstead.com/about/\n\nPhilip Stead’s Website: https://philipstead.com/about/\n\nAn Interview on NPR: https://n.pr/qf7Dy3\n\nAfter seeing Jason Segel on Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show, I learned that Segel has teamed up with Kirsten Miller to write a series of books for young readers. I am interested in books for all ages, so I checked out Nightmares! It is the first in the series featuring Charlie Laird, his family, and his friends. Publishers Weekly describes Nightmares! as “Coraline meets Monsters, Inc. in this delightfully entertaining offering from actor [Jason] Segel and co-author [Kirsten] Miller.”\n\nCharlie has suffered a terrible loss; his mother dies following a brief illness when Charlie is eight. Charlie, his dad, and his little brother Jack are naturally sad and trying to figure out how to live in such a new world to them. The little family lives in Cypress Creek, a small, pleasant community.\n\nThe only thing marring the landscape in Cypress Creek is a purple mansion sitting on a hill, dominating the town. Charlie and his friends are curious about the mansion. Stories of all sorts swirl around it, but the mansion has been unoccupied for some time.\n\nCharlie, Jack, and their dad learn Charlotte DeChant, the granddaughter of the last resident of the purple mansion, will soon be moving into the residence. The story is full of humor. For example, Charlie learns the last resident, an elderly woman, “had died just two days short of her 111th birthday from injuries she sustained in a gin rummy accident.”\n\nAt first, Charlie think Charlotte might be interesting, but he soon changes his mind. Charlie actually meets Charlotte before the rest of his family does. She engages him to help her move some plants from a truck into the house when she sees him riding his bike near the mansion. When we first see Charlotte, we learn “she had bright orange hair with curls that seemed to be blowing in a breeze—even though the air was perfectly still.”\n\nOther examples of humor are abundant throughout the book. Charlotte tells Charlie that her great-great-grandfather Silas DeChant whose sinister, scary portrait hangs in the house was “stuck in a very dark place…. But he found his way out. My grandma told me Silas had that portrait painted to remind him that there are places some people go where they aren’t meant to stay.” When Charlie asks where, Charlotte replies, “Vegas.”\n\nCharlie’s dad meets Charlotte and quickly the two are married. Charlie is not happy about this union because he fears it means everyone is forgetting about his mother. Jack, the younger brother, loves Charlotte, but Charlie is not convinced that Charlotte is a good person. In fact, he is sure she is a witch. The nightmares he begins having as soon as he, his dad, and Jack move into the purple mansion confirm his suspicions.\n\nCharlotte’s odd actions and curious drawings only add to Charlie’s belief that the family is in danger, particularly the Charlie and his brother. Later, this fear spills out to include the whole town when Charlie’s nightmares become so persistent that he cannot sleep. Also, his friends start showing up in the nightmares as well. They are frightened too.\n\nOne of Charlie’s biggest fears is that Jack will be eaten by the witch and her mean cat. Soon, Charlie’s nightmares are not restricted to nights only. They occur during the day and are extremely and frighteningly real. Charlie realizes he must do something to save himself, his brother, his friends, and ultimately, the whole town of Cypress Creek.\n\nWhen Charlie goes through the portal into the Netherworld, he encounters a number of characters who appear in nightmares: clowns, Medusa, Meduso, goblins, and vampires, the whole cast of fearful monsters.\n\nUS Weekly calls Nightmares! “a touchingly comical saga … about facing things that go bump in the night.”\n\nJason Segel is a comedic actor who first came to the public’s attention in How I Met Your Mother. He has also starred in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and The Muppets. Now, he is adding co-author to his repertoire. Segel says he suffered from nightmares when he was a boy. He learned “the things we’re most afraid of are the things that can make us strong… if we’re brave enough to face them.” He hopes the books will engage young readers and help them face their own fears. Nightmares! is the first in the series featuring Charlie and his friends.\n\nKirsten Miller, from North Carolina, moved to NYC at seventeen. Miller has written a popular series featuring Kiki Strike, “a small, albino girl who founds the Irregulars and is often considered the leader of the group.”\n\nSecrets of Shakespeare’s Grave by Deron R. Hicks is a quick read. If it did not end with a decidedly pointed sequel following, I would be better satisfied with the book. I did the sequel to The Hunger Games because of the ending which clearly pointed to another book in the series. As I am aware, that’s my bias.\n\nColophon Letterford is a girl who is allowed to sit at the grownup table for Thanksgiving, having reached the age of twelve. During the festive dinner, the guests are interrupted by the entrance of an unkempt man who limbs appear to move in all directions as once. He is Julian Letterford, Colophon’s father’s second cousin.\n\nThe Letterfords are a formidable family; the family has been in publishing since Shakespeare’s time. Miles Letterford, the patriarch who started the publishing business in London in the seventeenth century. He has a portrait painted of himself and encases the portrait in a massive, ornate frame. The family business is handed down from father to oldest son according to Miles Letterford’s will.\n\nCurrently, in the twenty-first century, Miles (Mull) Letterford, Colophon’s father, is the head of the publishing company. Intrigue builds as the family has gathered for Thanksgiving. Mull’s second cousin, Treemont, undoubtedly and plainly a villain, schemes to take the company from Mull’s leadership. Treemont wishes to invoke a clause in the ancient Miles Letterford’s will that if the leader is not fulfilling his duties, the family can vote in another leader.\n\nTreemont has spent a great deal of time working to ensure that Mull will not succeed in his job and thereby the chairmanship will fall to Treemont.\n\nLeaving the US and going to London, Colophon and Julian team up, an unlikely pairing, to solve the mystery of the portrait of their ancestor and thus to save the company from falling into the evil Treemont’s hands. Working together, Colophon and Julian pool their resources and knowledge and do indeed solve the mystery, not without a little danger to themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, Treemont uses every underhanded method at his disposal to thwart Colophon and Julian. Back in the US, Mull and his son Case, Colophon’s older brother and heir to the business, are working to sign three important authors, all of whom have weird ideocracies that, in the end, keep them from signing with Mull because Mull fouls up for one reason or another, none of the errors his fault. Of course, Treemont is behind the sabotage.\n\nOn Christmas Eve in London, the family gathers according to custom. If Mull has not fulfilled the promise of signing three important works, the family will vote to make Treemont the new chairman. Luckily, Colophon and Julian have solved the mystery of the ancient patriarch’s portrait by understanding the clues are in the frame, not the portrait itself.\n\nBy understanding the clues, Julian and Colophon together find the family treasure and save Mull’s job, not allowing Treemont to take over. The clues lead the pair to Shakespeare’s burial site and his monument within the church. Ater much searching and some danger, Colophon and Julian discover a key that unlocks a treasure box that has been held for four-hundred years in a bank in London. The treasure turns out to be Hamlet, “written in the Bard’s own hand, with his edits and stage directions.” And there’s more: “The portfolio also includes a short collection of sonnets and two more plays by Shakespeare—all in his hand.” The portfolio had been a gift to the first Miles Letterford. What I do not like about the end of the story is that readers find no satisfaction in the fact that Colophon and Julian have solved riddle and resolved the family’s crisis. Clearly, no one wants Treemont to be the head of the company.\n\nIn the end, Treemont accepts that Mull has won this round, but he lives to fight another day, leaving the story wide open for book two. In fact, Colophon receives “a small parcel from Julian…postmarked Abergavenny, Wales.” Inside, Colophon finds one page:\n\nColophon:\n\nThere is not time for small talk. In our quest, we followed one clue to another, which led us to the Shakespeare manuscripts. We all assumed the manuscripts were, in fact, Miles Letterford’s great treasure. We were wrong. The manuscripts were simply another clue. I will write further.\n\nJulian\n\nDeron Hicks along with his wife, daughter, and son lives in Warm Springs, Georgia. Hicks graduated from the U of Georgia with a BFA in painting. Following his receipt of a BFA, he went to Mercer Law School. He spent several years in private law practice; then an idea for a mystery novel for kids occurred to him. He also thought the story could teach readers about Shakespeare, so he set about writing The Secrets of Shakespeare’s Grave.\n\nHicks has followed up with several other stories in the series. I do like the idea of using bits of information about Shakespeare and his work within the story. Having a female detective is also appealing, especially one as bright as Colophon. Still, the ending is too blatant.\n\nDrew Daywalt wrote The Legend of Rock, Paper, Scissors and teamed up with Adam Rex to illustrate the book. Daywalt introduces the book at this link: https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062438898/the-legend-of-rock-paper-scissors.\n\nThe Legend of Rock, Paper, Scissors is a must-read book and even better read aloud. Kirkus Reviews wrote that The Legend of Rock, Paper, Scissors “will have listeners in stitches.” Booklist concurs with “purely absurd, sidesplitting humor.” Other reviews are equally strong in recommending The Legend of Rock, Paper, Scissors.\n\nReaders can find an activity to go along with The Legend of Rock, Paper, Scissors at this link: https://b0f646cfbd7462424f7a-f9758a43fb7c33cc8adda0fd36101899.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/activity-guides/AG-9780062438898.pdf.\n\nDaywalt and Rex have created the perfect read-aloud book for parents, grandparents, and children. The story is almost textured in that the fonts change from page to page and even within a page. Readers can see from Adam Rex’s picture below right that his sense of humor shines through his illustrations. The picture on the right below is from Rex’s Web site.\n\nThe story begins with Rock who lives “in an ancient and distant realm called the Kingdom of Backyard” and Rock swaggers informing readers that he cannot be beaten. However, Rock is sad because he has no competition, so he goes on a quest to find someone who can “give him a worthy challenge.” Rock ranges far and wide, conquering each new foe and continuing to be saddened further by his success.\n\nThen readers meet paper who lives in “Mom’s Home Office.” Paper is also convinced that HE is “the smartest warrior in all the land.” Unfortunately, he, too, is sad because “no one could outwit him.” Like Rock, Paper goes on a expedition to find someone who can outwit him. His first foe is on “Desk Mountain” where he meets “a large and square monster.” Needless to say, Paper bests the large, square monster, also known as a printer. Paper then continues his journey.\n\nFinally, we meet Scissors who lives “in the Kitchen Realm, in the tiny village of Junk Drawer.” She is fast and unchallenged like Rock and Paper. She decides to test herself against “a strange and sticky circle-man,” also recognized as tape. Through various trials, Scissors remains victorious and sad since no one can beat her, just like Rock and Paper.\n\nSuddenly, Rock and Scissors face off. What will happen? When and how will Paper join this pair, forming the trio we all know as Rock, Paper, Scissors?\n\nDrew Daywalt is the author of The Day the Crayons Quit and The Day the Crayons Came Home, other books which have made quite a splash among readers, including grandparents, parents and children. Adam Rex illustrated The Legend of Rock, Paper, Scissors, but he is also an author/illustrator of his own books too. One of those books is Frankenstein Makes a Sandwich.\n\nFrom the Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books comes this perfect summation of The Legend of Rock, Paper, Scissors: “While kids will snicker reading [The Legend of Rock, Paper, Scissors] on their own, it’s perfect for a guffawing share with younger sibs or buddy read, followed, of course, by a rousing game of Rock Paper Scissors.”\n\nCheck out Drew Daywalt’s site: http://www.crayonspicturebooks.com/drew-daywalt-oliver-jeffers/.
