        "text": "Neighbours is an Australian television soap opera first broadcast on 18 March 1985. It was created by TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed the idea of making a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. The shows storylines concern the domestic and professional lives of the people who live and work in the fictional suburb of Erinsborough. The series primarily centres on the residents of Ramsay Street, a short cul-de-sac, and its neighbouring areas. There have been 20 births, 46 marriages, and 60 deaths on-screen since Neighbours began in 1985.\n\nBirths[edit]\n\nYear Child Father Mother Reference 1987 [1] 1990 [2] 1991 [3] 1993 [1] 1994 [1] 1994 [1] 1999 [4] 2000 [5] 2001 [6] 2003 [7] 2005 [8] 2006 [9] 2006 [10] 2007 [11] 2008 [12] 2009 [13] 2012 [14] 2013 [14] 2015 [15] 2017 [16]\n\nMarriages[edit]\n\nYear Husband Wife Reference 1985 [17] 1986 [17] 1986 [18] 1987 [19] 1987 [20] 1988 [19] 1988 [19] 1988 [21] 1989 [21] 1991 [21] 1991 [21] 1991 [22] 1993 [22] 1993 [22] 1995 [22] 1996 [23] 1998 [24] 1999 [25] 2001 [26] 2003 [27] 2003 [28] 2004 [29] 2004 [29] 2005 [30] 2005 [31] 2006 [32] 2006 [33] 2007 [34] 2007 [35] 2007 [36] 2008 [37] 2009 [38] 2009 [39] 2009 [40] 2010 [41] 2010 [42] 2011 [43] 2013 [44] 2014 [45] 2014 [46] 2016 [47] 2016 [48] 2018 and N/A (same sex marriage) [49] 2019 [50] 2019 [51] 2019 [52]\n\nDeaths[edit]\n\nYear Character Cause of death Reference 1985 [53] 1985 [54] 1985 [55] 1985 [56] 1986 [57] 1986 [58] 1987 [59] 1988 [7] 1988 [60] 1989 [61] 1990 [7] 1992 [62] 1992 [63] 1993 [63] 1994 [64] 1994 [65] 1994 [63] 1995 [66] 1996 [67] 1996 [68] 1997 [7] 1998 [69] 1998 [70] 2000 [71] 2001 [72] 2001 [73] 2002 [7] 2004 [74] 2004 [75] 2005 [76] 2005 [76] 2005 [76] 2005 [77] 2006 [78] 2007 [79] 2007 [80] 2007 [81] 2008 [82] 2008 [83] 2008 [84] 2008 [85] 2009 [86] 2009 [87] 2009 [88] 2010 [89] 2011 [77] 2012 [90] 2013 [44] 2013 [91] 2013 [92][93] 2014 [94] 2015 [95] 2016 [96] 2016 [97] 2016 [98] 2016 [99] 2016 [100] 2017 [101] 2018 [102] 2019 [103]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n^a Body was not found.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nMonroe, Josephine (1996).
