        "text": "Is there a time-frame for Libby's return.\n\nDoes anyone know when she will start filming?\n\nI read she'll be on air in October so filming soon. They are still trying to get Darren back so he may return a few weeks later or not at all. They might do what is about to happen at UK Gold pace where Lyn ends it with Joe because she won't move to the farm, but Darren would end it because he won't move back to Erinsborough.\n\nGutted she returns after Sky leaves though, and she was just too late for Stingray leaving aswell\n\nStill so happy she is coming back.\n\n0\n\n9th July -13th July 2007:\n\nBit more detail of what is coming up next week:\n\nMonday 9th July\n\nOliver struggles to come to terms with the results of his DNA tests. And he stuns Elle when he tells her what he's discovered - Alan Napier (Barry Friedlander) was not lying when he told Oliver that he's his grandfather. This means Oliver's parents aren't really the Barnses! Meanwhile, Ringo and Carmella head to the country on business, but they're soon caught up in anything but that.\n\nTuesday 10th July\n\nConvinced that Carmella returns his feelings, Ringo decides to break up with Rachel. But will he be the one to end up with a broken heart instead? Also tonight, Karl's senile father puts the lives of his family in grave danger. Elsewhere, will Rosie help her Mafioso dad get day release from prison so he can attend her wedding?\n\nWednesday 11th July\n\nNed has been doing everything he can to suppress his true feelings for Janae for some time now. But he's forced to confront them once and for all when she announces she's moving to Cairns! As for Pepper, she can't stop thinking about Adam and the possibility that she may have lost him forever.\n\nThursday 12th July\n\nDespite assuring Boyd that she only cares for Caleb (Nick Russell) as a friend, Sky spends more time than ever with the Erinsborough newcomer. Caleb's feelings for Sky are clearly intensifying as well: tonight he asks Harold for permission to date his granddaughter.\n\nFriday 13th July\n\nOliver finally comes face-to-face with his biological mother - a woman named Rebecca (Jane Hall). But the meeting proves too much for Rebecca, and she makes it clear that they can't meet again. Meanwhile, Bree is hurt when it appears that Rachel and Zeke aren't that keen to spend time with her on her last day in Erinsborough.\n\nNext week...\n\nWhich two Ramsay Street residents begin an illicit affair?\n\n0\n\nLibby Article:\n\nWord of return spread by tot\n\nOne of Neighbours' most popular stars, Kym Valentine, is returning to Ramsay Street. Valentine will begin work this month after a three-year break from playing Libby Kennedy for a decade. She quit the soap to take the lead in the musical Dirty Dancing but always felt she would return. \"I am hugely loyal to the show and I'm ready to go back and do what I love,\" she said. Valentine took a long break after almost two years touring with Dirty Dancing. \"Physically and mentally I needed a rest,\" she said. \"I discovered I had a hernia in my stomach when I was doing the Sydney season. When I went to hospital (after the tour) they found I had three hernias. So now I have a 1 1/2 inch scar on my stomah. You won't see me in a bikini on Neighbours.\" Valentine's daughter, Millana, 4, revealed her mum was returning to Ramsay St. \"She overheard me on the phone and told my in-laws. She also told people at her day care,\" Valentine said.\n\nPicture of Kym Valentine holding the Ramsay Street sign:\n\nKym Valentine\n\n0"
