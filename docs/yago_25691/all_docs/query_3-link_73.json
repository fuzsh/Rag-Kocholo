        "text": "Alan Lee Baron, age 66, passed away Wednesday, May 10, 2023, at his home in Lynden, WA, surrounded by his beloved wife and children. Alan was born on June 25, 1956, to Sid and Margaret (Tjoelker) Baron in Bellingham, WA. He attended Ebenezer Christian school and graduated from Lynden Christian in 1974. Alan met his wife Debra King when working on her family farm at age 12 and married her on January 21, 1977. Together they had three children: Brant, Brandi (Bailey) and Brianne (Wright). In 1980, Alan was diagnosed with diabetes and in 1987, with a rare liver disease, Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis. At that time, doctors estimated he would only live another 3–7 years, but 13 years later he received the priceless gift of a liver transplant. He faced many years of health challenges, including numerous hospital stays, disease diagnoses, surgeries, and procedures with courage and faith. Alan was particularly grateful for Dr. Dana Petersen and Dr. Barry Levenson for their years of care, expertise and dedication to his healthcare.\n\nAlan worked for his dad at Baron Telecommunications and Quality Inn Baron Suites. He went on to co-own the Comfort Inn with his son. He had a few other jobs in between. He was very handy and could fix nearly anything. Alan was also a reserve Lynden Police officer for 26 years. In later years, he found the golf course therapeutic. He also loved waterskiing, singing with Kings Men of Song and on the worship team at Faith Community Church, meeting weekly with his Bible study friends, sharing his testimony and faith. He loved being grandpa and had a special relationship with each of his 13 grandchildren.\n\nAlan was preceded in death by his parents, Sid & Margaret Baron, parents in-law, Truman & Emogene (McPhail) King, brother in law, Alvin VanDalen, Aunts Adrianna “Abe” Tjoelker, Shirley (Gerald) Polinder, Betty (Bernie) Steiger, Gert Tjoelker, and Uncle Tony Kortus. He is survived by his amazing wife of 46 years, Debby, his son, Brant & wife, Trisha (Bovenkamp), their children, Joshua Alan, Bria, Jonathan, Gracie & Joy, his daughter, Brandi & her husband, Justin, their children, Emma, Jaden, Jett Alan & Cole, his daughter, Brianne & her husband Nick, and their children Isaac, Treven, Silas & Lilia. He is also survived by his brothers Jim (Laurie) Baron, Gerald (Lynne) Baron, Ronald (Natalie) Baron, sisters Kaye Lynn Baron, Julie (Grant) Kroontje, in laws Dale (Helen) King, Barbara VanDalen, Karen Ceranova, Dan (Carolyn) King, Steve (Mary Ann) King, Dean (Linda) King, & numerous Aunts, Uncles, cousins and friends whom he dearly loved. Alan was a fighter and will be remembered for his tenacity, his devout faith in God, and his generous spirit among other things."
