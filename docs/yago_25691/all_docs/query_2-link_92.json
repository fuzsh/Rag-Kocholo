He was a long time resident of Sunrise and Mars Hill, North Carolina, formerly of Brooklyn, New York.\n\nJohn was the funniest man, his jokes knew no end sometimes a bit off color but never offensive. He was an avid golfer who won many trophies. In his community everyone knew him as “The Mayor” for being the president.\n\nHe will be forever remembered by his wife of 26 years, Margaret Steiger, his daughters, Shannon Steiger and Carrie Steiger, his loving grandchildren, Joseph Steiger and Addison Robertson, sister, Geraldine Sexton, and his niece, Christine.\n\nHe was predeceased by his parents, John and Geraldine (Mc Cue) Steiger; brothers, Michael, Ben, and John; sisters; Jean, Kathleen, and Marie.\n\nJohn dearly loved his family and they loved him endlessly in return.\n\nVisitation will take place on Friday, December 14th, from 6:00-8:00 PM with Funeral Service starting at 7:00 PM at Boyd-Panciera Family Funeral Care, University Drive Chapel.\n\nMemorial donations in memory of John may be made to Madison Home Care and Hospice, Hot Springs Health Program, Inc., PO Box 69, Marshall, NC 28753-0069."
