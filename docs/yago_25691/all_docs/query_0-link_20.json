        "text": "I’d imagine there were times when retired navy chefs had to return to the high seas to regrease their slush fund. Today, I have come out of retirement to mark the return of Nicola Charles and, obviously, regrease my slush fund (that’s not a pun it just sounds dirty). Before we get into the recapping I should point out that I’ve hardly watched Neighbours since I stopped recapping and because I have no recapping integrity I’ll probably just pretend and make it up as I go along. It’s easier that way.\n\nMonday\n\nWe find ourselves in Erinsborough Hospital as Rhys advises Lucas and Vanessa their child needs some kind of emergency operation or an ice pack or something – it’s hard to tell, but the baby is whisked off so they can operate or find some frozen peas. Such a bold opening leaves me salivating at the possibilities….\n\nJust imagine Rhys is Sylvester, Lucas is the douche in the helicopter and the baby is the dangling lady.\n\nMeanwhile over at Lassiters, Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) arrives and makes her way from her taxi to the hotel. Sorry, “International Hotel.” Callum catches a glimpse of her back…\n\nAnd he only got to see her back.\n\nBut, wait. Somehow Callum recognises her….\n\nBack at Erinsborough hospital (seriously, there’s a pretty fast pace going here), Lucas explains Friday’s cliffhanger. Apparently he revealed his true feelings for Vanessa, but her response was cut off by the baby’s emergency alaram. Sounds like normal gimmicky plot progression to me.\n\nWell if that was gimmicky, this is just plain old stupid. Callum realises where he has see Sarah before.\n\nThis is just sloppy directing, and I can usually tolerate that because it’s Neighbours. However, in this particular instance we have a major character returning, it’s a pretty big deal for the show (even enough to prompt someone to come out of retirement) and this is the way they reintroduce her?\n\nAnyway, Sarah’s employers are interested in purchasing or have purchased the Erinsborough News and she is there to assess ways to cut costs. Whatever happens, it seems Paul’s days as a media mogul are reaching an end and we here at Recaparama would like to thank Paul for all the fantastic headlines over the years. It’s been grand.\n\nPutting last week’s cliffhanger to sleep, Vanessa declares her love for and pashes Lucas.\n\nTuesday\n\nWe’re still with Lucas and Vanessa.\n\nNo, it turns out the actress just couldn’t hide her disdain. Vanessa and Lucas are a happy couple.\n\nUltimately we are rewarded for sitting through Lucas and Vanessa’s humdrum courtship when Sarah and Karl meet in her hotel room. Rather than rekindle their old flame, they discuss their tightly held secret – they did more than just kiss 14 years ago, they slept together. They’re really laying it on thick with Sarah’s return. Anyway, they discuss and agree how important it is to keep this secret and how Sarah must leave. Karl, knowing that he’d seen Susan outside the hotel just moments earlier, wisely decides to farewell Sarah in full public view and….\n\nWednesday\n\nCallum and Toady visit Sarah in her hotel room. As they begin to catch up, Sarah cooly walks over to the bar fridge, collects some food and drink and passes it to Callum.\n\nSarah’s return has been a bit of a let down. She comes back and causes Susan some insignificant professional grief and her big secret is that she slept with Karl almost 20 years ago. In fact, Susan discusses her displeasure with Toady.\n\nSo why the fuck should anyone care? The only probable consequence, besides boredom, is a delay in Susan and Karl’s inevitable reunion.\n\nAt the coffee shop, Rani rues her mother’s infidelity when she too is subject to school children’s mockery.\n\nBut perhaps they have a point.\n\nTaking the Facebook bullying in her stride, the episode ends with Rani trumphantly discussing her revenge with Sophie. Whatever could it be?\n\nThursday\n\nRani’s revenge has caused quite the scene at old Lassiters. Three extras stand in the courtyard giggling like idiots as Paul walks past.\n\nRani’s revenge:\n\nAt the coffee shop, Lucas explains to Lou that he and Vanessa are dating so Lou’s family, not sure who, should move into their place as he is going to be staying at the hospital with Vanessa.\n\nOK, so Lou’s family arrives and a new family moves onto Ramsay St and into our hearts.\n\nSo there’s a mother, hot daughter a father (not arrived yet) and\n\nSo the father has arrived and he’s a policeman and he looks unlikeable.\n\nMeanwhile, Priya’s hair doubles her body mass.\n\nFriday\n\nThe new kids on the cul-de-sac start at Erinsborough High. Bailey, the “boy,” is a straight ‘A’ student, which, as my esteemed colleague observed, is simply an imprint on this Zeke carbon copy. The daughter isn’t performing well and Kate openly worries with the mother that she may have to repeat year 11. She quickly dismisses it though……\n\nAjay completes his frustration relieving boxing and, for the first time in Neighbours, boxing may lead to something other than relieving frustration. As he takes off his gloves a girl decides to pick him up.\n\nSince 80s parties and the like are all the rage these days, no doubt in a few decades someone will throw a 10s party.\n\nThe new cop/dad spends the first day on his job investigating the graffiti, until Paul asks him to drop the charges against Rani. With apparently nothing else to do the new cop/dad pops over to Ajay’s house to advise of the dropped charges, but also to offer some worthless family advice.\n\nAjay deduces that Priya convinced Paul to drop the charges, which pisses him off so he goes and has a beer by himself.\n\nSo Ajay leaves the bar with her and that’s your cliffhanger this week.\n\nSo that’s me done again, thanks for reading and apologies for the delay. I found the show incredibly difficult to watch, especially at the level of detail required to piece together a recap. Thankfully, for you and I both, the recaps will continue with Dinerdog back in full flight."
