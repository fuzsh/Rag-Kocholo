        "text": "I have to politely disagree... her head nodding when ever she delivers a line and her new fake laugh are just annoying. I hope Toadie takes up with his new boss asap so we can have less of the unhinged Sonya demanding stuff... I want my son back, I want a plant shop, I want a baby ....shes very tedious in her single minded list of needs.\n\n0\n\nI love Sonya, she may have had her troubles in the past but she's now got her head screwed on. I like how they've given her such a rounded personality, what with her liking puzzles and being scared of birds. She and Toadie make an ecellent couple\n\n0\n\nI have to politely disagree... her head nodding when ever she delivers a line and her new fake laugh are just annoying. I hope Toadie takes up with his new boss asap so we can have less of the unhinged Sonya demanding stuff... I want my son back, I want a plant shop, I want a baby ....shes very tedious in her single minded list of needs.\n\nI have to politely agree with this. The actress has established herself well in the soap and the partnership with Toadie seems real, but the character is awful. She is demanding and selfish. The high pitched squeal when she is being lighthearted grates too.\n\nMy problem is that I am not sure if the viewers are supposed to think her selfish or whether we are supposed to side with her when Toadie tells his boss things that she wants kept secret. I am also not sure if we are supposed to think her out of order when she corners the doc in the street and demands to know Toadie's fertitlity results, or is this deemed to be part of her loveable exciteable nature.\n\n0\n\nI liked Sonya when she was first introduced and I thought her character reached a high point around the time she was keeping her big secret from Callum and Toadie. (Even if the retcon was rather dodgy.) But since then it's been downhill for me, she's become one of my least favourite characters and this means I struggle to enjoy Toadie now too since most of his scenes are with her. The actress is pretty good though.\n\nI'm hoping she will become less irritating once the baby storyline gets going. Although I'm not holding my breath.\n\n0\n\nOf course, I thought there was another.\n\nThe Mum was a Rebecchi right?\n\nI'm not entirely sure. But... Scott was definitely Toadie's cousin which means Janelle must have either been Angie's sister or Big Kev's.\n\nUrgh... it was a stupid decision not to renew Janelle and Bree's contracts on the show when Scott and Dylan left. I'm still mad about it.\n\n0\n\nAgreed, Janelle and Bree should have stayed in Ramsey Street, I loved Alan Steiger as well.\n\nYeah, they were a great little family. They could always have brought in those two other random sons, Dwayne and Brandon, that we never saw but they mentioned occasionally. I really don't understand what motivated the writers to get rid of them. Especially since they kept Janae, who subsequently left anyway because her family had been written out. So stupid and random on the EPs part.\n\n0"
