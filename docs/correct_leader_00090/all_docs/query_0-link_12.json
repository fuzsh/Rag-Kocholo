He stressed that the work of the Cabinet must not be weakened even for a second.\n\nOne of the main goals of the changes was to appoint a reliable coordinator of the government’s work, namely, First Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, said Mr Putin.\n\nThe acting president also said that the newly appointed deputy prime minister, Sergei Shoigu, would be in charge of the ministries and agencies whose activity was related to the Emergencies Ministry."
