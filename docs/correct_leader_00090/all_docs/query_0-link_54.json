        "text": "Russian opposition activists, who led tens of thousands of people onto the streets in anti-government rallies in recent months, have merged two parties into one to strengthen their fight against President Vladimir Putin.\n\nMikhail Kasyanov, prime minister from 2000 to 2004 during Putin’s first term as president but now a fierce critic, and former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, united their People’s Freedom Party with former lawmaker Vladimir Ryzhkov’s Republican Party of Russia (RPR) on Saturday.\n\n“Our main goal is a change in the country’s political course. This can be achieved only via free elections,” Kasyanov said on the sideline of a conference where party delegates created the new party RPR-PARNAS.\n\nThe opposition got a boost last December when tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets against what they said were rigged parliamentary elections won by ruling United Russia.\n\nSuch numbers had not been seen since Putin’s rise to power in the late 1990s.\n\nPutin, who returned to the Kremlin in May for a six-year term, responded the protesters by promising modest electoral reforms including easing registration requirements to enable more parties to contest elections.\n\nBut he also approved legislation setting harsher fines, in some cases thousands of dollars, for participants in demonstrations which violate public order.\n\nLast month the Justice Ministry gave the RPR permission to register after a long court battle that began when it lost its legal status in 2007 as Putin tightened his grip on electoral politics.\n\nThe RPR was always a small force but its members had a dozen parliamentary seats in the early 1990s which it gradually lost during Putin’s first term as president.\n\nOpposition leaders hope to gain a foothold in future regional and municipal elections.\n\nEarlier this week, police searched the homes and offices of several opposition leaders, including Nemtsov, after series of mass protests against the rule of Putin.\n\nNemtsov compared Putin’s actions against the opposition to the that of the leader of neighbouring Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko.\n\n“This is the Lukashenisation of Russia. This machine of violence will gain more strength,” Nemtsov said during the party meeting."
