        "text": "In this article, the patronymic is Vladimirovich and the family name is Putin.\n\nVladimir Vladimirovich Putin (born 7 October 1952) is a Russian politician who is the president of Russia. Putin has held continuous positions as president or prime minister since 1999: as prime minister from 1999 to 2000 and from 2008 to 2012, and as president from 2000 to 2008 and since 2012. He is the longest-serving Russian or Soviet leader since Joseph Stalin.\n\nHe was ranked the World's Most Powerful Individual by Forbes from 2013 to 2016.\n\nEarly life\n\nPutin was born on 7 October 1952 in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia), the youngest of three children of Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin (1911–1999) and Maria Ivanovna Putina (née Shelomova; 1911–1998). His grandfather, Spiridon Putin, was a personal cook to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. Putin's birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers: Albert, born in the 1930s, died in infancy, and Viktor, born in 1940, died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 during the Siege of Leningrad by Nazi Germany's forces in World War II.\n\nPutin's mother was a factory worker and his father was a conscript in the Soviet Navy, serving in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s. Early in World War II, his father served in the destruction battalion of the NKVD. Later, he was transferred to the regular army and was severely wounded in 1942. Putin's maternal grandmother was killed by the German occupiers of Tver region in 1941, and his maternal uncles disappeared on the Eastern Front during World War II.\n\nPutin attended School No. 193 at Baskov Lane, near his home. At 12, he began to practise sambo and judo. In his free time, he enjoyed reading the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Lenin. Putin studied German at school and speaks it fluently.\n\nEducation\n\nPutin holds a law degree from Leningrad State University (now Saint Petersburg State University).\n\nIn 1997, he received his Ph.D. in economics from Saint Petersburg Mining University.\n\nKGB career\n\nIn 1975, Putin joined the KGB. From 1985 to 1990, he served in Dresden, East Germany, using a cover identity as a translator. After the collapse of the Communist East German government, Putin returned to Leningrad. He resigned from the KGB in 1991, following the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nPolitical career\n\nIn May 1990, Putin was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to the mayor of Leningrad Anatoly Sobchak. In March 1994, Putin was appointed as first deputy chairman of the Government of Saint Petersburg. In June 1996, Sobchak lost his bid for reelection, and Putin, who had led his election campaign, resigned from his position in the city administration.\n\nOn 26 March 1997, President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin deputy chief of the Presidential Staff, a post which he retained until May 1998. On 25 July 1998, Yeltsin appointed Putin director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the primary intelligence and security organization of the Russian Federation and the successor to the KGB.\n\nOn 9 August 1999, Putin was appointed acting Prime minister by President Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin also announced that he wanted to see Putin as his successor.On 31 December 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned and Putin became Acting President of the Russian Federation. In the 2000 presidential elections Putin won in the first round with 53% of the vote.\n\nPresidency\n\nDuring Putin's initial presidential tenure, the Russian economy grew on average by seven percent per year, driven by economic reforms and a fivefold increase in the price of oil and gas. In 2012, Russia joined the World Trade Organization.\n\nIn 2014, Putin signed a deal to supply China with 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. Power of Siberia, which Putin has called the \"world's biggest construction project\", was launched in 2019 and is expected to continue for 30 years at an ultimate cost to China of $400bn.\n\nIn cultural and social affairs Putin has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church. He supported the 2020 Russian constitutional referendum, which passed and defined marriage as a relationship between one man and a woman in the Constitution of Russia.\n\nPutin is credited with ending the Second Chechen War and reestablishing federal control over the region. While serving as prime minister under Medvedev, he oversaw a military conflict with Georgia and enacted military and police reforms. In his third presidential term, Russia annexed Crimea and supported a war in eastern Ukraine through several military incursions, resulting in international sanctions.\n\nPutin has also sought to increase Russian territorial claims in the Arctic and its military presence there. In August 2007, Russian expedition Arktika 2007, part of research related to the 2001 Russian territorial extension claim, planted the Russian flag on the seabed at the North Pole. Both Russian submarines and troops deployed in the Arctic have been increasing.\n\nUnder Putin, Russia's relationships with NATO and the U.S. have passed through several stages. After the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. in 2001, Putin had good relations with American President George W. Bush, and many western European leaders. However, the NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011 prompted a widespread wave of criticism from several world leaders, including Putin.\n\nIn late 2013, Russian-American relations deteriorated further when the United States canceled a summit for the first time since 1960 after Putin gave asylum to American Edward Snowden. In 2014, Russia was suspended from the G8 group as a result of its annexation of Crimea. Putin gave a speech highly critical of the United States, accusing them of destabilizing world order and trying to \"reshape the world\" to its own benefit. On 21 February 2023, Putin suspended Russia's participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States.\n\nIn his fourth presidential term, Putin launched a military operation in Ukraine, which prompted international condemnation and led to expanded sanctions against Russia.\n\nPutinisms\n\nPutin has produced many aphorisms and catch-phrases known as putinisms.
