        "text": "Vladimir Putin’s presidency is being praised to the high heavens\n\nand certain individuals have been forwarding their programs for\n\n“restoring the ruined power.” Mikhail Leontyev’s article is\n\nremarkable in that respect, but not so much for its praising\n\npassages, but because it reflects the mindset of a certain part of\n\nthe Russian political elite that would like to set the tune of\n\nPutin’s second term in office. It is surprising that the author (or\n\nauthors), as if possessing a knowledge that is inaccessible to\n\nordinary people, hints that Putin has no intention of following the\n\npolitical course he declared in his policy statement on February\n\n12, 2004. In light of the unexpected – and obviously illogical –\n\ndismissal of Mikhail Kasyanov’s Cabinet of Ministers, Russian\n\nsociety has been speculating about what new turns will be made in\n\nthe presidential course.\n\nWhen Putin launched his election campaign, he made it\n\nunequivocally clear that he had chosen a liberal stance. “Only free\n\npeople can ensure economic growth and prosperity for their nation,”\n\nhe said. “In a nutshell, these are the pillars on which the success\n\nof economic development rests.” However, the ways of restoring the\n\nstate that are discussed in Leontyev’s article prove that the\n\nauthors are advising Putin on a different course of action and\n\ncherish the hope that they will be heeded. Their program for the\n\nso-called “civilized revenge,” actually appears to be a new version\n\nof authoritarian state policy. The methods used by\n\nthe government during Putin’s first term in office have made\n\nevident at least one thing: there is a sharp contrast between\n\nPutin’s liberal policy statement and the actual political processes\n\nin the country. A natural question arises: Does this contradiction\n\ncome from Putin’s apprehensions, or a desire to rectify the careen\n\nin Russian policies that has become evident since 2003? Is it\n\nthe President’s wish to calm the Russian liberal minority, not to\n\nmention the West, who are so concerned about the transformation of\n\npower in Russia? It could be argued that by dismissing the Cabinet,\n\nPutin made the decision to reaffirm his stated liberal-market\n\npolitical course.\n\nON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CAUTIOUS USE OF FORCE\n\nThe recent presidential election in Russia did not only\n\nsymbolize the automatic re-endorsement of Putin’s presidency; it\n\nsignaled the end of a period in Russian history known as\n\n‘post-Communist experiment.’ Putin has consolidated his political\n\nregime and now needs to cement the system that has taken shape in\n\nRussia. While preparing the cement mix for this purpose, he will\n\nhave to measure the proportion of the ingredient ideas, such as\n\nstrong statehood, patriotism, populism, and liberalism. What\n\nguideline will the President ultimately choose for Russia? I would\n\nrather agree that a return to “Yeltsinism,” in terms of an\n\noligarchic method of rule, is hardly possible. At the same time, a\n\nrepeat of Yeltsin’s methods of courting favorites, while putting\n\ntogether a new “Family,” cannot be ruled out either. I tend to\n\nshare Leontyev’s thoughts concerning the chances of a leftist\n\npopulist scenario in the near future. Even the staunch “patriots”\n\nin the circle that is close to the Kremlin realize the destructive\n\nnature of the anti-Western style of Vladimir Zhirinovsky or Dmitry\n\nRogozin. On the face of it, the liberal alternative appears to have\n\nbeen discredited, and its proponents are demoralized. It is very\n\ndoubtful that Putin will take up the ideas of a political force\n\nthat has suffered defeat.\n\nThere are indications that the Russian political quarters are\n\nvigorously working to blend authoritarianism with economic reforms\n\nand an orientation toward a strong state. However, they do not want\n\nthese attempts to frighten the West. In other words, a new type of\n\ntraditionalism is taking shape that is free of the Communist shell.\n\nBy “traditionalism” I mean that the accent is still being made on\n\nthe leader’s personified and unlimited power in domestic policy,\n\ntogether with the use of force in foreign policy.\n\nWhat do the new traditionalists propose and what do they object\n\nto? The emotion of Leontyev’s article suggests that they are\n\nenthusiastic about Putin’s decision to push the radical\n\noppositionists out of the scene. This is a vain type of\n\nsatisfaction, however, as the removal of all forces except\n\nbureaucracy from Russian politics fertilizes the soil for the\n\ngrowth of radicalism of all colors, ranging from liberalism to\n\nleftist nationalism. The appearance of Sergei Glazyev on Russia’s\n\npolitical stage as Putin’s main opponent perfectly illustrates this\n\ntendency. A political vacuum is always fraught with erratic and\n\nunpredictable developments. That is why the Western democracies\n\ncultivate a diversity of political approaches and, of course,\n\nopposition parties. In this way they try to preclude any quandaries\n\nfor the state. In this sense, Leontyev’s acerbic remarks about the\n\nopposition being increasingly “Rybkinized” are premature. Shiftless\n\nopposition means trouble for Russia’s state power and a threat to\n\nits only political institution – the presidency.\n\nAs concerns the zealous proponents of full state authority and,\n\nat the same time, “full sovereignty” for Russia, this idea has long\n\nexpired; a country’s membership in any international organization\n\nimplies the voluntary restriction of its sovereign powers. Russia’s\n\nsovereignty will have to be limited, unless it fancies for itself\n\nthe role of a global “outcast.” If Russia wants to remain on the\n\nside of the civilized world, it will have to adopt the rules\n\nexercised by the international community.\n\nPresently, it seems that those who seek to become support\n\npillars for Putin regard full sovereignty as the right to use force\n\nin the dimensions unlimited by legislation. This position may be\n\nviewed as a symmetric response to the policies of the U.S.\n\nneo-conservatives who also place the use of force above the law.\n\nHowever, the situation inside and outside Iraq has made it clear as\n\ndaylight that the U.S. policy of force has provoked the most severe\n\npolitical crisis of the past decade. This policy has split the\n\nWestern community and brought about a decline of support for the\n\nRepublican Party amongst many Americans.\n\nIf Russia copies the U.S. model, a dialog with the West will\n\nhardly be possible. Moreover, an expansionist understanding of\n\nRussia’s sovereignty that fails to be supported by adequate\n\nresources threatens to make Russia nothing more than a source of\n\nridicule.\n\nWHAT TYPE OF STATE DOES RUSSIA NEED?\n\nLet us now analyze the main thesis of the neo-traditionalists.\n\nIt looks very simple: during his first term in office Putin began\n\nrestoring the Russian state; during his second term, he will have\n\nan opportunity to use the state machinery for modernizing Russia\n\nand earning it a worthy place in the world.\n\nThat Russia stands in need of a strong state capable of\n\nguaranteeing social rights and civilized living conditions to its\n\ncitizens is indisputable. It does need a modern bureaucracy, strong\n\narmed forces, and efficient special services to ensure national\n\nsecurity. But this kind of state does not contradict the ideals of\n\nWestern liberalism, and this is proved by the everyday practices of\n\nany developed society.\n\nThe liberal project does not demand that Russia simply observe\n\nall of the Western recipes. Russia’s past experience of cooperating\n\nwith the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for\n\nReconstruction and Development suggests that it should take a\n\ncautious approach to the recommendations that it may get from the\n\nWest; Russia may have interests that differ from those of the\n\nleading world powers. Western nations are split, and each of them\n\nhas its own view of how the world should develop, which was\n\ngraphically manifest by the recent Iraqi crisis.\n\nThe real question is hinged on whether we understand a “strong\n\nstate” as one which establishes the rules of the game that are\n\nobserved both by society and those in power. Or do we understand\n\nthe state to be controlled by a handful of people in the Kremlin\n\ncorridors of power who behave according to their own “perceptions\n\nof the game,” as opposed to the requirements of the law? The first\n\ntype of a state is the one where the rules of the game are ensured\n\nby laws and independent institutions. The second type is one that\n\nis able to ensure only one thing – a society without rules.\n\nIndeed, during his first term of presidency President Putin\n\nsucceeded in dragging the country out of chaos; however, the state\n\nthat has arisen as result of his presidency is basically identical\n\nto the one Russia had under Yeltsin – it continues to bypass laws\n\nwithout any principles. There is a slight difference, however:\n\nwhereas the lawless state under Yeltsin was non-systemic, Putin has\n\nturned the “perceptions-driven” state machinery into a system. But\n\nwhat does this system rely on? It relies on the fact that the\n\nPresident must make up for the absence of law or the executive’s\n\ninability to implement law. For instance, he has to meet with the\n\noligarchs at his dacha and lay out the rules of “equidistant\n\nalienation” for them. Or he must give personal guarantees to the\n\nWestern state leaders and businessmen for foreign investment in\n\nRussia. It would be inconceivable in any normal democratic society\n\nwhen the country’s number one citizen has to work in substitution\n\nof the law. In Russia, however, life would be inconceivable without\n\nsuch a substitution. Putin chose to personally perform the\n\nfunctions of the law; this decision must have come from his lack of\n\nfaith with the rules, together with the perception that his\n\npersonal obligations and guarantees as a president are the more\n\nefficient ways of handling things.\n\nEvery time the President stands in substitution of the law or\n\nany of the branches of power, we are inclined to take it as a\n\nforced measure and believe that the rules will appear soon and work\n\nautomatically. Nothing of the sort has happened so far, and we will\n\nnot see this happen until the political class stops entrusting the\n\nPresident with the powers of an arbiter standing beyond society.\n\nArbiters, too, can make mistakes and their obligations are not\n\neverlasting. When Putin moves out of the Kremlin, there will be no\n\nguarantees that the new leader will be committed to the old\n\nobligations. The very practice of living beyond rules brings about\n\nthe omnipotent power favorites and a type of power succession that\n\nboils down to the denial of the previous chapters in the nation’s\n\nhistory. Yeltsin wiped out Gorbachev together with the country,\n\nPutin wiped out Yeltsin, together with his regime. What will\n\nPutin’s successor do?\n\nThe strengthening of authoritarianism, i.e. the President’s\n\npersonal power, will have no dramatic effect on the situation if\n\nthe state machinery continues “acting according to perceptions.”\n\nTrue, people are more apprehensive of an authoritarian leader, but\n\nlife without rules will continue, with the stakes growing still\n\nhigher.\n\nCan a state living without rules and organized by the will of\n\none person be economically efficient? The answer is definitely no.\n\nIt cannot be predictable, because it can exist only in the absence\n\nof clear obligations before its citizens. In light of this,\n\nLeontyev’s assertion that the basis for modernization has been\n\ncreated in Russia is wishful thinking. The current state system is,\n\nin fact, a system of self-preservation and of status quo, but not\n\nof development. It can only guarantee to run around in a circle\n\nwhich must produce the illusion of movement.\n\nIf Putin is really determined to consolidate this type of state\n\n– and Leontyev believes that he is – then it means that in the\n\nshort-term Russia is doomed to stagnation. And we should also bear\n\nin mind that a system designed along the principles of a\n\n“transmission belt” has no chance for managing crises: any blow\n\nwill crush it like a sandcastle. Many of us remember only too well\n\nwhat happened to the “transmission belt-driven” systems. A glaring\n\nexample is the collapse of the Soviet Union. Incidentally, it had\n\nmuch stronger life support systems than Russia presently\n\npossesses.\n\nIf Putin really plans to go on with the transformation, albeit\n\nin a more liberal and systemic way, then it remains unclear how he\n\ncan succeed with the existing state system and political class\n\nwhich pushes him to replace the regular rules of the game with its\n\nown rules.\n\nTHE SYSTEM AGAINST PUTIN\n\nLeontyev eagerly points to a ready-made enemy – the democratic\n\nopposition which is trying to bereave us of Putin. Now, where are\n\nthese audacious terminators who are threatening the President? Are\n\nthey in Garry Kasparov’s discussion club? Let us be serious; the\n\nPresident is in danger, but not because of the oppositional forces.\n\nThe threat comes from the system that took shape under Yeltsin and\n\nwas consolidated under Putin’s leadership. The political regime\n\nthat he has built presently constrains him and makes him more\n\nvulnerable than Yeltsin was. There is an old truth: the more powers\n\na leader has, the more he is compelled to share them with the\n\nsuite. And the more he does so, the weaker he becomes. The\n\nimpotence of omnipotence is an axiom, which was made evident during\n\nYeltsin’s presidency, as well as by many rulers before him.\n\nPutin has to carry alongside his ratings an awkward crowd of\n\nopportunists who have infested the agencies of the executive, the\n\nUnited Russia party and several organizations that the Kremlin has\n\nset up. All of these monsters do not help the President to broaden\n\nthe base of his leadership. On the contrary, they enfeeble him by\n\nmisusing his popularity.\n\nBy towering over society, the authorities are losing contact\n\nwith reality. This situation generates the risk of inadequate\n\ndecisions, especially as the legislative power and the judiciary\n\nhave actually turned into departments of the presidential\n\nadministration.\n\nThe nature of the state structure is such that the leader, even\n\nhaving immense powers, is unable to subjugate the mammoth machine\n\nthat unavoidably strives to meet its own interests rather than\n\nfulfill the leader’s objectives. The further strengthening of such\n\na state will make the President increasingly cornered by the\n\ndemands of that state and its bureaucracy.\n\nAlready, it is obvious that the President has to satisfy the\n\ndemands of his regime to the detriment of his own leadership, and\n\nthis year’s election campaign, in which the Kremlin virtually ruled\n\nout any competition with Putin, provides a glaring proof. A\n\nquestion arises: What bugbear scared the guys at the top so much?\n\nWas it the phenomenon of the late General Alexander Lebed? But\n\nwhere was the candidate for that role? It is hard to believe that\n\nliberal Irina Khakamada, leftwing Sergei Glazyev or Communist\n\nNikolai Kharitonov could have filled the void left by Lebed. Or\n\nmaybe the President did not deign to compete with that handful of\n\ncontenders? Then why did his team clean out the electoral field so\n\nheartily? By paving the road for Putin against possible contenders\n\nbefore the December 2003 election to the State Duma, the Kremlin\n\ndevalued the significance of Putin’s victory in the March 2004\n\npresidential election.\n\nAnother disservice of the authoritarian mindset was the apparent\n\nattempt to put an imperial gloss on Putin: dressed in a military\n\nuniform, he was led to a military exercise to watch a farce of\n\nmissile launches. The launches failed, but they served to hold up\n\nRussia’s military to ridicule, while dealing a blow to the\n\npresident’s dignity. Is it the Russian special way of eliminating\n\n“national humiliation?”\n\nPRESIDENT FACING CHALLENGES\n\nNo doubt, people can extol Putin’s efforts to revive Russia, but\n\nall of the praise will not make it easier for him to find answers\n\nto the structural challenges that he obviously faces.\n\nHis primary challenge is to earn a full-fledged\n\nlegitimacy of his own, not the one that was\n\nbestowed on him by his predecessor. Now that the role of violence\n\nhas been limited, and all the previously known tools of\n\nlegitimization of power have been exhausted, elections can be the\n\nonly instrument for forming state power. However, the present\n\nelectoral system is turning into just another time bomb for Russia.\n\nU.S.S.R. President Mikhail Gorbachev dreamt of elections becoming\n\nan instrument for renovating the Soviet state; instead, they caused\n\nits destruction. Today’s manipulations with the electoral system\n\nare “a tune from the same opera” – they are undermining Putin’s new\n\nleadership and the very foundations of the state.\n\nThe second most serious challenge is assuming\n\nresponsibility, which is totally flouted in Russia since\n\n“no one is responsible for anything.” Despite the concentration of\n\npowers in the President’s hands, he bears no real responsibility\n\nfor the country’s political course, government, law enforcement, or\n\nadministrative resources since he has been placed beyond the reach\n\nof criticism. All of the other executives have no such powers to\n\nbear responsibility. In the meantime, the country’s modernization\n\nis impossible without clearly specified responsibility. Will Putin\n\nbe able to summon the courage and break the vicious circle of the\n\npervasive ‘I couldn’t care less’ attitude? As a first step, he\n\nshould have attached some responsibility to the parliamentary\n\nmajority (the United Russia party) for the Cabinet of Ministers and\n\nappointed Boris Gryzlov (its leader) prime minister. Of course,\n\nthese moves would mean a certain loss of quality, but they would\n\nalso mean the acquisition of principles. It is important that\n\nsomebody bear responsibility for something in this country!\n\nChallenge number three is the continuity of\n\nregime which can, to a great degree, predestine our\n\nfuture. Putin will have to decide on how he will ensure the\n\ncontinuity of power – by prolonging his stay in the Kremlin or by\n\nappointing a man to succeed him. He seems to be quite earnest when\n\nhe says he will not change the Constitution to stay in the\n\npresidential office longer than prescribed by law, unless some\n\ndramatic circumstances compel him to do so. But if the crowd of\n\nactivists feeding on his popularity ratings realizes that he is\n\ntruly going, they will immediately rush to find him a successor.\n\nThen Putin is likely to become a lame duck, with great reforms\n\ndropping off his agenda. Regardless, Putin has just two years ahead\n\nof him to carry out his reforms, since a new cycle of power will\n\nbegin in 2006, be it with Putin or without him.\n\nThe fourth challenge is to prevent deterioration in\n\nrelations with the West. Putin has confirmed his\n\nexistential pro-Western orientation, but his thesis that Russia\n\nmust integrate into the family of developed Western democracies has\n\nnever experienced a practical implementation. So today we have to\n\nthink about how we can allay the Cold War syndrome. Why was our\n\nromance with the West so short-lived yet again? Briefly speaking,\n\nthere were two factors. First, Russia failed to assimilate the\n\nliberal model and was unable to imitate it skillfully. Second, the\n\nWestern community has been mired in its own problems and is\n\nunprepared to admit Russia into its orbit. It fails to understand\n\nthat integration is a global priority of the same significance as\n\nfighting international terrorism or nuclear nonproliferation.\n\nOne way or another, Putin will have to think now about averting\n\nRussia’s drift to a new isolationism, to say nothing of a new\n\nconfrontation.\n\nPUTIN HAS DETERMINED THE VECTOR\n\nAdmittedly, I am not optimistic about the prospects for Russia’s\n\nmodernization during Vladimir Putin’s second term of presidency.\n\nThe political developments over the past few years have helped make\n\nhis liberal election platform look like a “special operation”\n\ndesigned to calm the grumbling Russian liberals and Western\n\npoliticians, who have suddenly developed a concern over the future\n\nof Russian democracy. If Putin really wants to make the liberal\n\ncourse a guideline for action during his second term in office\n\n(which means that all his activity in 2003 was but a “special\n\noperation”), two questions arise: Who will he rely on for carrying\n\nout his reformist agenda? How successful can a liberal course be if\n\nit is carried out by non-liberals?"
