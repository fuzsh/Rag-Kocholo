        "text": "Join a Discussion on Putin and the Direction of Russia\n\nBy MICHAEL WINES\n\nOSCOW, May 7 -- Beneath a gilded sunburst in a gilded palace, his hand on a red, leather-bound copy of the Constitution, Vladimir V. Putin swore an oath today to \"respect and guard the human and civil rights\" of Russia and became, officially at last, its second president.\n\nMuch of Russia -- and the world -- now waits to see what he will do with the title. Many expect a quick push to overhaul Russia's inscrutable tax code and economy and to reassert Kremlin rule over its 89 provinces -- goals supposedly too risky to chase when he was but an acting leader.\n\nBut Mr. Putin, who has dropped only the broadest hints of an agenda since he abruptly succeeded President Boris N. Yeltsin last New Year's Eve, revealed nothing more today. Predictably, he reappointed as acting prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov, 42, a financial expert known to the West for his dealings on rescheduling Russia's foreign debt who is widely expected to win the permanent appointment.\n\nIn a brief speech after his swearing-in, Mr. Putin said he would perform his duties openly, \"guided only by the interests of the state.\"\n\n\"I consider it my sacred duty to unite the people of Russia, to gather citizens around clearly defined tasks and aims and to remember, every minute of every day, that we are one nation and one people,\" he said. \"We have one common future.\"\n\nAlthough known as prosecutor of a war in Chechnya that has brought fresh accusations of Russian trampling on human rights, Mr. Putin today made much, oratorically and symbolically, of the step toward democracy that his inauguration represented. The ceremony, he noted, completed the first democratic transfer of executive power in all of Russia's 1,100-year history.\n\nUnderscoring that, Mr. Yeltsin stood beside him, on a flower-bedecked podium in the Kremlin Grand Palace, throughout the ceremony.\n\n\"We can be proud that this is being done peacefully, without revolutions and putsches, in a respectful and free way,\" Mr. Yeltsin said. \"This is possible only in a new Russia, one in which people have learned to live and think freely.\"\n\nFour months after his stunning early resignation on New Year's Eve, Mr. Yeltsin appeared healthy, but spoke slowly and with one pause so long that a handful in the audience applauded, thinking his speech was over.\n\nWatching from a V.I.P. seat was the former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a bitter Yeltsin enemy who was barred from the 1996 inauguration. He was invited, officials said, as a gesture to his role in creating a democratic Russia and to stress continuity of leadership.\n\nAlso present was Vladimir Kryuchkov, Mr. Gorbachev's K.G.B. chief and one of the leading conspirators in a 1991 coup against Mr. Gorbachev that sought to return the Soviet Union to hard-line Communist rule.\n\nThe invitation-only audience of legislators, jurists and diplomats -- heads of state were not invited -- included Mr. Putin's favorite schoolteacher and his judo instructor.\n\nIt was a bittersweet and, for Mr. Putin and many in the audience of 1,500 people, a largely unexpected moment. When Mr. Yeltsin began his second term in office four years ago, most people would have considered it unthinkable that any head of Russia's long-feared espionage apparatus would be freely elected president in the year 2000.\n\nWhen Mr. Yeltsin plucked Mr. Putin from the relative anonymity of a senior Kremlin post last August and appointed him prime minister and preferred successor, still others snickered. Mr. Putin had no political experience. Worse still, they said, he was bland in appearance and demeanor.\n\nBut Mr. Putin, 47, a former K.G.B. agent who rose to head its domestic successor, the Federal Security Service, surprised almost everyone. His war against secessionist rebels in Chechnya -- and his well-advertised fondness for judo, jet fighter rides and submarine trips -- made him a symbol of Russian patriotism and professionalism.\n\nAlthough many Russians have soured slightly on the war in Chechnya as fighting drags on, Mr. Putin's victory in the presidential election in March proved a foregone conclusion. And in polls last week, 60 percent of respondents said they viewed him positively.\n\nKremlin officials had said they wanted an inauguration muted in character but emphasizing the continuity of government. They succeeded in stressing continuity.\n\nBut the proceedings today may even have exceeded in splashiness Mr. Yeltsin's own 1996 inauguration, where the crowd was twice as large.\n\nIt was probably impossible to stage anything muted in the Grand Palace, a massive, 162-year-old edifice whose halls were restored and thoroughly gilded at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars during Mr. Yeltsin's tenure.\n\nUnlike Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Putin did not bring the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church onstage to certify his installation, a tradition that reminded many of the crowning of a new czar. On the other hand, Mr. Yeltsin's inauguration lasted only 15 minutes, and he was too stricken by heart trouble to even make a speech.\n\nMr. Putin's ceremony, broadcast on all major television networks, was run with military precision and Hollywood style down to the aerial camera that tracked his entourage down a deserted riverside highway and through the Kremlin gates.\n\nA covey of cameras watched as Mr. Putin's midnight-blue Mercedes limousine pulled up at the palace and he emerged, alone. Still more cameras followed Mr. Putin through the palace, striding alone down an endless red carpet, up the 57 steps of the famous Red Staircase and through two palace rooms packed with applauding guests.\n\nHe entered St. Andrew's Hall, where the installation took place, precisely as the Kremlin clock struck noon. As the ceremony ended, a choir sang the \"Glory\" aria from an 1836 opera by Mikhail Glinka, \"Life of the Czar.\" Outside the Kremlin walls, 30 artillery pieces fired a salute.\n\nAfter the Kremlin ceremony and a blessing from the patriarch, Aleksy II, Mr. Putin reviewed a parade of Kremlin guards and laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier just outside the Kremlin walls.\n\nThen Mr. Putin started work, holding a cabinet meeting and reappointing Mr. Kasyanov.\n\nAlthough his appointments may offer clues, there is real uncertainty as to where Mr. Putin intends to take Russia next.\n\nHe has proclaimed himself a democrat and a capitalist, and some of his top advisers reflect those views.\n\nAnders Aslund, an expert on Russia at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, said he believes a \"radical liberalization\" of the Putin program is occurring. Its first fruits, he said, may be a plan to replace Russia's graduated income tax with a flat tax.\n\nStill, he said, \"there's a substantial worry that he won't do very much\" beyond tax reform.\n\n\"His situation is good, Mr. Aslund said. \"The economy and political support are good. The need for action doesn't seem to be apparent, and he will have to consolidate his power. And that takes time.\"\n\nOne of Mr. Aslund's counterparts at Carnegie's Moscow offices, Lilia Shevtsova, said that Mr. Putin is at his core a bureaucrat who wants to make the system work and not to revolutionize it. Nor does he have the political clout to carry off a revolution, because of the power of \"these regional governors, these conservative guys who don't want to move, who will fight him,\" she said."
