        "text": "Sunday\n\nPutin Sworn in as Russian President; Economic Recovery is Central Theme of New Government\n\nAired May 7, 2000 - 5:01 p.m. ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nGENE RANDALL, CNN ANCHOR: Just sworn in as Russian president, Vladimir Putin got off to a mixed start on a pledge to fix his country's sick economy. He named former finance minister Mikhail Kasyanov as his prime minister and made economic recovery a central part of his inaugural address, but Putin did not outline specific steps he would take. Meanwhile, he told cabinet members who have served under him since he became acting president on New Year's Eve that he hopes most of them will stay on.\n\nWe have a report now from Andrew Simmons.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nANDREW SIMMONS, ITN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He was virtually unheard of a year ago, yet Vladimir Putin took the long walk to be sworn in as Russian president. In the grand and ornate setting of the Kremlin's St. Andrew's Hall, it was to be a brief ceremony. There to formally hand over the office of state was Boris Yeltsin, who had taken the world by surprise when he handed over power to the former KGB spy.\n\nMr. Putin, who went on to gain a convincing win in the March presidential elections, took his oath of office, his hand resting on the Russian constitution. In his speech he said that for the first time in Russian history high power was being transferred legally and peacefully by the will of the people. Mr. Putin's rise to popularity was helped by his firm action over the war in Chechnya, which led to claims of human rights abuse.\n\nThis is the first time 47-year-old Mr. Putin has held elected office. For now, his promises of further democratic reforms and determined efforts to halt economic decline and corruption are welcomed by his supporters. But amongst his call for unity are few detailed policies on how he intends to bring Russia into a more stable time.\n\nAndrew Simmons, ITN.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nTO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com"
