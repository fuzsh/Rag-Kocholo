        "text": "Synopsis\n\nRussia's former PM Mikhail Kasyanov, who championed close ties with the West as prime minister, said that, like many other Russians, he did not believe in the weeks ahead of the war that it would actually happen. Kasyanov only understood that Putin was not bluffing when he saw him summon the country's top leadership for a theatrical meeting of the security council three days before the invasion on February 24.\n\nHe was Vladimir Putin's first prime minister but Mikhail Kasyanov never in his worst nightmares imagined that his former boss would unleash a full-scale war on Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to AFP in a video interview, Kasyanov, Russia's prime minister from 2000 to 2004, said he expected the war could last up to two years but he was convinced Russia could return to a democratic path.\n\nThe 64-year-old, who championed close ties with the West as prime minister, said that, like many other Russians, he did not believe in the weeks ahead of the war that it would actually happen.\n\nKasyanov only understood that Putin was not bluffing when he saw him summon the country's top leadership for a theatrical meeting of the security council three days before the invasion on February 24.\n\n\"When I saw the meeting of Russia's Security Council I realised, yes, there will be a war,\" Kasyanov said.\n\nHe added that he felt that Putin was already not thinking properly.\n\n\"I just know these people and by looking at them I saw that Putin is already out of it. Not in a medical sense but in political terms,\" he said.\n\n\"I knew a different Putin.\"\n\nAfter being sacked by Putin, Kasyanov joined Russia's opposition and became one of the Kremlin's most vocal critics.\n\nHe is now the leader of the opposition People's Freedom party, or Parnas.\n\n'Complete lawlessness'\n\nKasyanov said Putin, a former KGB agent who turns 70 in October, has managed over the past 20 years to build a system based on impunity and fear.\n\n\"These are the achievements of a system that, with the encouragement of Putin as head of state, has started operating even in a more cynical, cruel manner than in the final stages of the Soviet Union,\" he said.\n\n\"Essentially, this is a KGB system based on complete lawlessness. It is clear that they do not expect any punishment.\"\n\nKasyanov said he had left Russia because of the war and was living in Europe but he declined to disclose his location out of concern for his safety.\n\nHis close ally and fellow opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was gunned down near the Kremlin in 2015.\n\nPutin's best-known critic Alexei Navalny, 46, was poisoned with a nerve agent in 2020 and is now in prison.\n\nKasyanov predicted the war could last for up to two years and said it is imperative that Ukraine win.\n\n\"If Ukraine falls, the Baltic states will be next,\" he said.\n\nThe outcome of the war will also determine Russia's future, he said.\n\nKasyanov said he \"categorically\" disagreed with French President Emmanuel Macron's suggestion that Putin should not be humiliated.\n\nHe also rebuffed calls for Ukraine to cede territory to end the war.\n\n\"What has Putin done to deserve this?\" he said. \"This is an overly pragmatic position.\n\n\"I believe this is wrong and hope that the West won't go down that path.\"\n\n'Enormous tasks'\n\nKasyanov believes Putin will eventually be replaced by a \"quasi-successor\" controlled by the security services.\n\nBut a successor would not be able to control the system for long and eventually Russia will stage free and fair elections, the former prime minister said.\n\n\"I am certain that Russia will return to the path of building a democratic state,\" he said.\n\nHe estimated it would take about a decade to conduct \"de-Communisation\" and \"de-Putinisation\" of the country.\n\n\"This will be difficult, especially after this criminal war.\"\n\nHe said trust would have to be re-established with European countries, which he called Russia's \"natural partners\".\n\nCritics have in the past accused the Russian opposition of being hopelessly divided but Kasyanov said he was confident things would now be different.\n\n\"I have no doubt that now, after the tragedy that we are all witnessing, the opposition will unite.\"\n\nRussians will face a huge task rebuilding their country, he said.\n\n\"Everything will have to be rebuilt anew. Essentially, an entire set of economic and social reforms should be started all over again.\n\n\"These are enormous and difficult tasks and they will have to be done.\"\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nLearning and unlearning of Unacademy and Gaurav Munjal\n\nWhat Tata Motors looks to Curvv out with its new coupe SUV\n\nDon’t just look overseas; Indian deep-tech should mine the domestic market: Lip-Bu Tan\n\nWhy the Jammu area is becoming an epicentre of terror\n\nWhat connects Donald Trump, Nvidia share slide and Taiwan?\n\nStock Radar: HDFC AMC hits fresh record high in July; breaks out from Rectangle formation; time to buy?\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
