        "text": "The President asked the Government to maintain regular contacts with representatives of the United States, and said rescue units had been alerted and could be sent to the disaster area anytime.\n\nMikhail Kasyanov said all emergency and secret services, particularly those in the North Caucasus, had been placed on red alert starting on September 11. He said Russia had offered assistance to the United States and that national rescue teams were ready to respond anytime.\n\nMr Putin noted the need for an additional and prompt inventory of all emergency-service regulations and departmental instructions, and said proposals on stepping up their work must be made in the near future.\n\nThe President heard a report by the Central Bank Chairman on the situation on national currency and stock markets.\n\nMr Kasyanov said all financial and trade operations were being made without delay and in full volume. Although there is some confusion, the Central Bank is moving to calm down market players, Mr Kasyanov told the President.\n\nAccording to the Prime Minister, prices for the main Russian export items remain stable, and there is no reason for alarm. On the whole, the situation is under control; we are regularly monitoring developments on the domestic and global markets; and the dollar is unlikely to plunge in Russia, Mr Kasyanov said. He said the Government did not expect any dramatic developments on the market, as the US economy remained fundamentally strong.\n\nMr Gerashchenko said that although the dollar was unlikely to fluctuate against other currencies, the Central Bank had enough reserves to maintain the rouble’s stable exchange rate."
