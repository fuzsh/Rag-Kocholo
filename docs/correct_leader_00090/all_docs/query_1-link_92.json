This may prove even more important than participation in political party activities – helping people to understand the civic aspects of life and to be proactive. After all, this would be helping to develop the skills of the voters who actually want to change the situation in the country.\n\nCorrespondent: Do you expect that you will co-operate with Khodorkovsky in any political or civic activities?\n\nM.K.: If we did, it would be the most positive kind. The Republican Party of Russia deal directly with policies, and now, thanks to the decision of the European Court, we have the right to participate in the elections. This Fall, we will begin to participate in the regional elections. Of course it is very important for us to know how civil society and young people are feeling, what their aspirations are. As soon as Khodorkovsky is released we will sit down and discuss it together."
