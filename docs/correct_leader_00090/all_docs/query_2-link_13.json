        "text": "President Vladimir Putin's destabilizing actions in Europe's East may be boosting his numbers at home, but they are not making him any friends abroad. As tensions rise in Ukraine and more evidence emerges of Moscow’s orchestration of events in the nation’s east, Western leaders have stepped up their response and Russia is finding itself increasingly isolated in the international community. Is this in Russia's long-term interest?\n\nJoin the Atlantic Council as we explore the ramifications of today's events both in the short- and long-term with Russian opposition leader, and former prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov. Prime Minister Kasyanov will offer his perspective on the events in Ukraine and Putin's strategy in the region, and his approach toward the United States and Europe.\n\nMikhail Kasyanov served as prime minister of Russia from 2000 to 2004 and minister of finance between 1999 to 2000. Currently he is co-chair of the Republican Party of Russia – Peoples Freedom Party (RPR-PARNAS) and one of the most consistent critics of Putin's style of governing. Kasyanov attempted to participate in the 2008 Russian presidential elections, but his candidacy was barred by the Central Election Commission under suspicious circumstances."
