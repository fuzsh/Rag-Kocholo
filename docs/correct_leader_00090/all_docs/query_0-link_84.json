        "text": "Russian President Putin said Tuesday in a televised speech that he had dismissed the Russian government led by Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov.\n\nPutin's press service also confirmed that Kasyanov had been dismissed and Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko had been named as acting prime minister.\n\n\"I have made a decision on the dismissal of the government under Article 117 of the Constitution of Russia,\" Putin said.\n\n\"This decision bears no relation to any assessment of the performance of the former composition of the government. It was dictated by my desire to once again delineate my position on the issue of what development course the country will take after March 14, 2004.\"\n\nIt is widely expected that Putin, who was elected in March 2000, will score a landslide victory in the presidential elections on March 14.\n\nPublic opinion polls in recent years show Putin's support rate has stayed above 70 percent and the incumbent president boasts an 80 percent approval rating this year, far higher than any of his six challengers who have individually never mustered more than five percent.\n\nIn a presidential decree, Putin instructed the government \"to perform its duties pending the formation of a government,\" the press service said.\n\nRussian stocks tumbled three to five percent on the news. Meanwhile, the dollar climbed 5.5 kopecks on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange.\n\nKasyanov had served as prime minister for nearly four years since he was named by Putin in May 2000 after Putin took office.\n\nIt is believed that the differences over the Yukos probe between Kasyanov and Putin were the main reason for Kasyanov's dismissal.\n\nSome cabinet members will probably remain in their posts despite the dismissal of the government.\n\nAlexey Kydrin, acting deputy prime minister and acting finance minister, and Vladimir Yakovlev, acting deputy prime minister, praised Putin's decree, describing it as the \"right\" decision.\n\nActing Deputy Prime Minister Boris Alyoshin said Putin's decree came as a surprise.\n\nMeanwhile, some presidential candidates expressed opposition to Putin's decision.\n\nNikolai Kharitonov, the Communist Party's presidential candidate, told Interfax that the president's decision \"is a public relations move designed to attract public attention to the president in the run-up to the presidential elections and to ensure a high turnout.\"\n\nIrina Khakamada, an independent candidate, said Putin's decision would deal a blow to the stability of the country.\n\n\"The step by the president is so sudden that it would undermine the belief in any kind of prognoses of the president's actions in the framework of the law,\" Khakamada was quoted by Interfax as saying.\n\nSergei Mironov, speaker of Russia's Upper House of the Parliament, welcomed Putin's decision. Mironov is also running for the presidency but has said he is helping Putin win.\n\n\"The president has assessed the work of the government led by Kasyanov as satisfactory. In this connection, the government's dismissal is a logical step and I support this decision,\" Mironov told Russian news agencies."
