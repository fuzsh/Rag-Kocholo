        "text": "Mr. Kasyanov was the Prime Minister of Russia from May 2000 to February 2004 and the Minister of Finance in 1999-2000. Since being dismissed in 2004 by Putin he has been an important part of the opposition. Currently, he is the leader and chairman of the political party People's Freedom Party, the leader of the movement People’s Democratic Union and an outspoken critic of President Putin and government’s policy. Despite having received many threats and being assaulted on several occasions over the years he continues to pursue his work.\n\nDuring Kasyanov’s term as Prime Minister of Russia, his government made serious breakthroughs in launching and successfully finalizing reforms in many areas of the Russian economy and public sector – tax and fiscal reforms, budgetary and pension reforms, reorganization of the national infrastructure (energy sector, railways), land and customs reforms. Inflation was reduced significantly and the Russian economy grew by almost one third. The urgently needed policy of economic diversification had been started, but after Kasyanov was dismissed by Putin in 2004, it was never fully implemented.\n\nIn 2006-2007, Kasyanov played an important part in ‘the Dissenters’ March’, the first protest manifestations in many years. In 2009, he authored the book ‘Without Putin’. One year later, in 2010, he co-founded the coalition ‘For Russia without Lawlessness and Corruption’ and together with Boris Nemtsov, who was assassinated in 2015, he was co-chair of the ‘People's Freedom Party’. Kasyanov is an active speaker and one of the leaders of protest rallies ‘For Fair Elections’ and “Against war with Ukraine”.\n\nOn November 16 Kasyanov will be giving a presentation on the political situation in Russia. The presentation will be introduced and chaired by Torbjörn Becker, Director of SITE. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.\n\nLocation: Stockholm School of Economics, the Aula Lecture Hall. Entrance from Bertil Ohlins Gata 4.\n\nDate: Thursday, November 16, 15.00 – 16.00 starting with registration and coffee at 14.30.\n\nThe number of seats for this event is limited, therefore we invite you to register for the event as soon as possible, but not later than Thursday, November 9, 2017."
