        "text": "Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin (7 October 1952 – 23 November 2022) was a Russian politician and intelligence officer who served as the President of Russia from 1999 to 2008, and from 2012 until his assassination in 2022. He also served as Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000, and from 2008 to 2012.\n\nFor sixteen years, Putin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. In 1996, he moved to Moscow to serve in Boris Yeltsin's administration. He briefly served as director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and secretary of the Security Council of Russia before being appointed as prime minister in mid-1999. A few months later, Yeltsin resigned, resulting in Putin becoming acting president, officially being elected to the office in 2000. Throughout his first term, Putin oversaw the collapse of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, fully reincorporating it into the Russian Federation. The Russian economy grew significantly by seven percent per year following economic reforms. As a result of a successful economy, Putin was reelected in 2004.\n\nIn 2008, seeing that he would not be able to run for a third consecutive term, Putin served as prime minister under Dmitry Medvedev, overseeing the First Russo-Georgian War in 2008 as well as military and police reform. In 2012, Putin ran for president again and was successfully reelected. In his third term, Russia became increasingly interventionist abroad, eventually occupying and annexing Crimea in 2014 following the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine and sent military forces to support the separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, resulting in the worsening of relations between Russia and the west. Putin also ordered troops to intervene in the ongoing Syrian civil war to support Bashar al-Assad. Following his reelection in 2018, Putin revised the constitution in 2021, adding a new amendment that would've allowed him to run for election twice more."
