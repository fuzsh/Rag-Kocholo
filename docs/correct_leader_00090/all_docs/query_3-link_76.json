        "text": "RU\n\nWith Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine already well into its third year, recently “re-elected” Russian president Vladimir Putin has initiated a partial reshuffling of his cabinet. The most notable move thus far involves the Ministry of Defense, where Sergei Shoigu will be replaced by Andrey Belousov, a senior public official who previously held multiple posts in the Russian government. Shoigu, who had been in his previous post since 2012, will now head Russia’s Security Council, replacing Nikolai Patrushev. While Putin’s latest staffing decisions still require approval of the Federation Council, they are largely regarded as a done deal. The Insider lays out what can be expected from Russia’s future Minister of Defense.\n\nBelousov, 65, is known as a scholar of macroeconomics. He began his career as a forecaster and analyst, advising Yeltsin-era prime ministers Yevgeny Primakov and Sergei Stepashin before freelancing for Putin’s first two prime ministers, Mikhail Kasyanov and Mikhail Fradkov. In the year 2000, he founded the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting. He also worked for Herman Gref at the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, headed the ministry in Dmitry Medvedev’s government (2012-2013), worked as Assistant to the President for Economic Affairs, and returned to the government as First Deputy Prime Minister in 2020. Twenty years ago, Belousov was a frequent and active participant in round tables and economic policy discussions in Moscow, says Konstantin Sonin, an economist and professor at the University of Chicago:\n\n“[Belousov belongs to] a rare breed of competent and government-oriented economists of the older generation. I would say he was too competent to be elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences. While other older macroeconomists tended to focus on general observations, vague and unsubstantiated, Belousov's center operated with real-world numbers. At that time in Moscow, only foreign consultants and economic think tanks employing young experts could perform this work on a decent level.”\n\nAs an economic official, Belousov has consistently advocated for import substitution and a reliance on domestic demand. He is also known for his initiatives assigning additional deductions to the budget from the “excess profits” of large corporations. In 2018, he came up with the so-called “Belousov list,” proposing to seize 513.66 billion rubles [~$5.6 billion] in additional revenue from 14 metallurgical, chemical, and petrochemical companies “due to changes in external market conditions.” He proposed using this money for the implementation of Putin's “May decrees” — 218 objectives the Russian leader set forth in May 2012 after returning to the presidency for a third term. After Belousov’s initiative became known to the press, resistance from commodities companies displeased by the potential asset seizure prevented it from being adopted.\n\n“What fools! Would you look at that — so many billions handled by such idiots,” presidential aide Belousov said in 2019 after the plan leaked. According to him, if the businessmen had simply called his office before they “leaked everything to the press,” he would have reassured them — but they “didn't even think of it.”\n\nIn 2023, however, Belousov’s idea for a tax on excess profits earned in previous years was brought to life, adding approximately $3.3 billion to Russia's federal budget. Belousov insisted that the measure was taken at the initiative of the business community: “They say, ‘Guys, rather than raise taxes, let us better chip in and pay.’”\n\nBelousov's son Pavel and his wife own Claire&Clarté, an engineering consulting and digitalization company. Among its clients, Claire&Clarté has named the Ministry of Industry and Trade and state-owned corporations Rostec, Roscosmos, and Rosatom. “Andrey Belousov could use his position to influence his son's business. He was a member of the supervisory boards of Rosatom and Roscosmos,” investigative journalist Sergei Yezhov concluded.\n\nBelousov keeps distance from all government factions and has no team of his own, a former government staffer tells The Insider: “He is a fully trusted Putin confidant who can be tasked with a thorough audit of military spending.”"
