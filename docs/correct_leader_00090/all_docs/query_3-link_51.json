        "text": "Irina Nagornykh\n\nThe Central Election Commission cited people awarded for contributing to the electoral system's development\n\nTo mark the 15th anniversary of Russia's electoral system, the Central Election Commission yesterday awarded President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin CEC commemorative badges signifying \"those who have made a significant contribution to the development and functioning of Russia's electoral system.\" The list includes speakers from both houses of parliament, former and sitting deputies, and all prime ministers with the exception of Mikhail Kasyanov.\n\nThe celebrations are timed to coincide with the 15th anniversary of the October 1993 presidential decree establishing the Central Election Commission. The badge is made from an alloy and has no intrinsic value. It shows a two-headed eagle, an assembly bell, and a black-and-white ball symbolising the first election of the Novgorod popular assembly. The badges may have a limited run of 500.\n\nThe list of recipients includes 54 names. Among them are President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. A source at the CEC told Kommersant that it was decided to give the awards \"to all heads of the Federation Council, State Duma, Government and Presidential Executive Office who have served over the past 15 years.\" Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev each qualified for inclusion on several counts (in 2003-2005, for example, Mr Medvedev worked as head of the Presidential Executive Office).\n\nThe Kremlin took an understanding view of the award. \"Usually, such badges are turned over to the presidential library in the Kremlin's block No. 1,\" a source in the Presidential Executive Office told Kommersant. But in the Government the correspondent was told that \"the CEC Chairman will perhaps go down in history himself.\"\n\n\"Our leaders have contributed a great deal to the electoral system. Without them, we would not have had the best legislation in Europe,\" said Sergei Popov, head of the State Duma's committee for work with public associations, supporting the CEC's decision. He himself received the badge. Yevgeny Primakov, head of Government in 1998-1999, and Sergei Mironov, Federation Council speaker, refused to comment. Sergei Shakhrai, chief of Audit Chamber staff and one of the drafters of the Constitution, was brief: \"The CEC shows respect for people, 15 years does not often come around.\"\n\nAmong the prime ministers the award list failed to include Mikhail Kasyanov, who headed the Cabinet from 2000 to 2004. But the former prime minister and now leader of the People's Democratic Union, was not upset. His spokeswoman, Yelena Dikun, told Kommersant: \"Churov (Vladimir Churov is CEC chairman - editor) has awarded all those who have lent their hand to electoral chaos and disorder in Russia.\"\n\nViktor Sheinis, one of the drafters of the first Russian laws on the electoral process, and Vadim Solovyov, a non-voting CEC member from the Russian Communist Party between 1999 and 2007, were surprised to find themselves among high-ranking recipients. \"Most of these people have done nothing to contribute either to election legislation or to organising elections. I am not against those being decorated, but I am not of that lot,\" Mr Sheinis told Kommersant. \"Now they go to court and now they give an award ... If I am included in their company, it means I have done something wrong as a member of the opposition,\" wondered Mr Solovyov.\n\nRafgat Altynbayev, head of the Federation Council's committee on federal affairs and regional policy, said: \"The CEC Chairman is a curious personality: he has substance and can get to the root of many things, humour included.\"\n\nMr Churov believes too few worthy people have been awarded. He told a Kommersant correspondent that an extra 300 badges would be made. Still, 800 pieces is a \"very modest figure\" compared with the flood of awards being given in other departments."
