        "text": "MOSCOW, November 24. /TASS/. Russia’s former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov has been put on the foreign agent list, the Russian justice ministry said on Friday.\n\n\"Kasyanov took part in making and disseminating among an unlimited audience of reports and materials from foreign agents, disseminated unverified information about decisions and policies of Russian public authorities. He spoke against the special military operation in Ukraine, as a respondent appeared on media platforms provided by foreign structures. Along with individuals put on the foreign agent list, he is a member of the Russian Antiwar Committee, an association geared to discredit Russia’s foreign and domestic policy,\" the ministry said.\n\nKasyanov is now living outside Russia.\n\nApart from that, the foreign agent list was supplemented with Ilya Venynskin, journalists Ilya Davlyatchin (lives outside Russia) and Idris Yusupov, and Lyudi (People) limited liability company.\n\nThe St. Petersburg Russian PEN-club, a public organization, has been crossed out of the foreign policy list due to its winding up.\n\nKasyanov was Russia’s Prime Minister from 200o to 2004. From December 2010, he was co-leader of the unregistered coalition Party of People’s Freedom (Parnas). The party it was liquidated in May 2023 due to the insufficient number of regional offices.\n\nIn June 2022, Konstantin Merzlikin, a member of Paranas’ political council, confirmed that Kasyanov had left Russia."
