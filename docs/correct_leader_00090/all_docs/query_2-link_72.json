        "text": "On February 24, 2022, the Russian government, led by Vladimir Putin, launched an aggressive war against Ukraine. In the eyes of the world, this war crime has been committed by the whole country; by all Russians.\n\nAs a result, against our will we, citizens of the Russian Federation, have been held responsible for this violation of international law; a military invasion and massive loss of life. The enormity of the crime committed leaves no room for silence or passive dissent.\n\nThe Russian Anti-War Committee was created in order to oppose this bloody warâââto develop a common position, to help people coordinate their efforts, and to resolve the enormous number of problems that have arisen because of Putinâs aggression.\n\nWe are convinced of the absolute value of human life, and that individual rights and freedoms are inviolable. Putinâs regime is a threat to these values. We see our task as uniting all forces to resist this.\n\nIt was not the Russians who started this war, but a mad dictator. But it is our civic duty to do everything we can to stop it."
