        "text": "Grammy award-winning singer, songwriter and producer Barry Gibb has today signed with Columbia Records (RCA in the UK).\n\nGibb will release his first album with the label – only the second solo album of his career to date - In The Now this autumn. It is also his first album of all-new material since the Bee Gees’ final studio record in 2001.\n\nThe album was co-produced by Gibb and John Merchant, while all of the songs featured were written by Gibb and his sons Stephen and Ashley.\n\nThe deal comes just two days after Gibb joined Glastonbury headliners Coldplay on stage this weekend, where he performed covers of Bee Gees classics To Love Somebody and Stayin' Alive with the band.\n\nAs a record producer/songwriter, Barry has worked with several other high-profile artists, ranging from Barbra Streisand’s Guilty album to Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers country record Islands In The Stream, along with Diana Ross' Eaten Alive (featuring Chain Reaction) and Dionne Warwick’s Heartbreaker album.\n\nCommenting on the new deal, Gibb said: “This is a dream come true for me. It’s a new chapter in my life. I always hoped one day that The Bee Gees would be with Columbia or indeed Sony, so it’s a great joy for me to start again this way with such great people.”\n\nBetween Robin, Maurice, and Andy, the Gibb brothers achieved 19 No.1 records on the US charts during their careers.\n\n“I will never forget my brothers,” Gibb added. “They will always be a part of everything I do. Our dream came true.”"
