        "text": "Earth’s last surviving Bee Gee was calling from his home studio in South Florida, just steps from the waters of Biscayne Bay.\n\n“I used to have a great boat,” Barry Gibb said. “A speedboat.” He called it Spirits Having Flown, after a 1979 Bee Gees album that has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide. “I would tear around the bay and get ideas.”\n\nSometimes he didn’t even need the boat. One day the Bee Gees’ manager Robert Stigwood called. He was producing the film version of the musical “Grease” and needed a new title song. Barry had not seen the film; this was a creative challenge.\n\n“How in heaven’s name,” he asked himself, “do you write a song called ‘Grease’? I remember walking around on the dock, and it suddenly occurred to me that it’s a word, and you’ve just got to write about the word.”\n\nGrease is the word, he wrote, is the word that you heard. It’s got a groove, it’s got a meaning.\n\nHe’d solved his problem and he’d seen the light; the word was “grease,” and the word was good. “Grease,” recorded by Frankie Valli, was released in May 1978 and reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart by the end of August.\n\nIt was Gibb’s seventh writing credit on a No. 1 hit that year, after “How Deep Is Your Love,” “Stayin’ Alive,” “Night Fever” and “If I Can’t Have You,” all from the “Saturday Night Fever” soundtrack; and “Shadow Dancing” and “(Love Is) Thicker Than Water,” solo singles Barry helped write for his brother Andy Gibb. On the Hot 100 for the week of March 3, 1978, songs by the Brothers Gibb made up three of the week’s Top 5.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
