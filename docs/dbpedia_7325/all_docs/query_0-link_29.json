Under the agreement, Warner/Chappell will continue to administer the rights to Gibbs’ incredible catalog of songs, dating from 1967 to the present.\n\nAs a member of legendary Australian pop group, The Bee Gees, Gibb co-wrote worldwide hits including “How Deep Is Your Love,” “Stayin Alive,” “Words,” “Tragedy,” and “You Win Again,” as well as “Heartbreaker,” “Islands in the Stream,” and “Chain Reaction.” Over the course of their career, The Bee Gees won six Grammy awards, sold an estimated 220 million records and were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in both the US and Australia. The group shares the record—alongside The Beatles—for having written and performed six consecutive No. 1 singles. Their songs have been recorded by renowned acts such as Al Green, Janis Joplin, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross, Take That, Elton John and Barbara Streisand, among others.\n\nBarry Gibb said “I am very proud to be extending my relationship with Warner/Chappell. The people there are great and I look forward to a long and fruitful partnership with a view to maximizing the potential of The Bee Gees and my personal catalog.”\n\nJon Platt, President, Creative – North America, Warner/Chappell Music said, “Barry is undoubtedly one of the most influential and successful songwriters of all time—his extraordinary catalog is loved by each generation of artists and music fans.

WMG is delighted to provide a home for the Bee Gees’ legendary music and is proud that Barry entrusts Warner/Chappell with his stunning catalog of songs. We are excited to be building on our long and productive partnership.”\n\nGibb had at least one No. 1 song in each the 1960s, 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000s. In 1977, five of Gibb’s songs simultaneously reached the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100, and for one week, four were in the Top Five. In 2004, he received the CBE award (Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) in Queen Elizabeth II’s annual honors list. In September 2012, he announced plans for a world tour this year, which will feature songs drawn from The Bee Gees’ anthology set Mythology.\n\nAbout Warner/Chappell Music:\n\nWarner/Chappell Music is WMG’s award-winning global music publishing company.
