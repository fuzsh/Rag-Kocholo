        "text": "From left: Brothers Maurice Gibb, Robin Gibb and Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees perform live on stage in Sydney, New South Wales, November 7, 1989.\n\nAt 67, Barry Gibb is the only surviving member of one of the 20th century's greatest vocal groups. And now - two years after the death of his brother Robin, and 11 years after Maurice Gibb died - the last of the Bee Gees is undertaking his first-ever solo tour.\n\nBy CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan\n\nFlorida\n\nBarry Gibb's wife, Linda, played a big role in coaxing the singer back on tour: \"Well, I was fed up with him sitting on his ass!\" she told correspondent Anthony Mason. \"He was miserable. I think after Maurice died he kind of went into a bit of a depression and he just moped around.\"\n\nBut Barry told Mason that it was important for him to go back on stage. \"Yeah, yeah. It's everything to me. It's all I've ever known. I don't know how to do anything else. I can't get a job!\"\n\nBrothers\n\nThe three oldest Gibb boys started singing together as kids in England. When the family emigrated to Australia in 1958, the brothers got a record deal and a TV show.\n\nFrom left: Brothers Barry Gibb, age 12, and 9-year-old twins Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb, pictured in Brisbane, Queensland, after rocking the radio and record world with a private recording of a \"rockabilly\" song which they wrote themselves.\n\nHootenanny\n\nAn undated photo of the Bee Gees.\n\nBarry Gibb\n\nA photo of Barry Gibb, age 18, in 1964.\n\nGibb told Mason, \"I remember saying to one of my first girlfriends at 14 years old that if she dumped me she was making a mistake 'cause I was going to be famous. I actually said that, you know?\"\n\n\"But more importantly you believed it.\"\n\n\"I believed it, yeah,\" said Barry. \"And I don't know why.\"\n\nThe Bee Gees would eventually record 15 No. 1 hits, and sell more than 120 million records worldwide.\n\nThe Gibb Family\n\nAn undated family photo. Rear: Maurice Gibb, Barry Gibb and Robin Gibb. Front: Hugh Gibb, Andy Gibb and Barbara Gibb.\n\nThe Bee Gees\n\nA photo of the Bee Gees - Robin Gibb, Barry Gibb and Maurice Gibb - taken in Australia in 1964.\n\nThe Bee Gees\n\nThe Bee Gees in 1964.\n\nAlthough the brothers had found success in Australia at a very young age, they wanted a bigger stage.\n\n\"We knew that to reach the rest of the world, we had to be either in the States or London,\" Robin Gibb told CBS News in 2009. \"We had to be where the action was.\"\n\nSo in 1967 they boarded a ship back to England.\n\nThe Bee Gees\n\nThe Bee Gees in 1969.\n\nThe Bee Gees\n\nJoining Barry, Maurice and Robin as part of the Bee Gees in the late 1960s were drummer Colin Petersen (second from right) and guitarist Vince Melouney (far right). Petersen was later replaced on drums by Geoff Bridgford.\n\nThe Bee Gees\n\nThe Bee Gees in 1968.\n\nAlbums\n\nJust a handful of the 22 studio albums released by the Bee Gees between 1965 and 2001.\n\n\"Top of the Pops\"\n\nThe Bee Gees perform on the British TV series, \"Top of the Pops,\" in London, March 6, 1969, From left: Barry Gibb and Robin Gibb.\n\nThe Bee Gees\n\nA photo, c. 1970, of the Bee Gees.\n\nThe Bee Gees\n\nA photo, c.1970, of the Bee Gees.\n\nThe Bee Gees\n\nA 1975 photo of Maurice, Barry and Robin Gibb.\n\n\"Saturday Night Fever\"\n\nThe Bee Gees' soundtrack album for the film \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977) was a monster hit, selling 40 million copies. It resided on the Billboard album charts for nearly 2.5 years.\n\nThe album won the Bee Gees five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, Best Arrangement Of Voices (for \"Stayin' Alive\"), Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Group (for \"How Deep Is Your Love\"), and Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo Or Group (for \"Saturday Night Fever\").\n\nMadison Square Garden\n\nBy April 1978, the Bee Gees had written 5 of the top 10 songs on the charts. Not since the Beatles had one band so dominated the airwaves:\n\n\"Yes, we were extremely overexposed!\" Barry Gibb said in 2009. \"But it's the truth. You know, we were having too much success. In fact, we had three in the top 5 in Billboard, not just five in the top 10. And it was just too much.\"\n\nAnd when the disco backlash hit, the Bee Gees became the punching bag. So the brothers retreated, writing hits for other artists, like Barbra Streisand (\"Guilty\"), Dionne Warwick (\"Heartbreaker\"), and Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton (\"Islands in the Stream\").\n\nAndy Gibb\n\nA portrait dated 1978 of musician Andy Gibb.\n\nAndy had formed his own group and in the late 1970s recorded three Number 1 singles - \"I Just Want to Be Your Everything,\" \"(Love Is) Thicker Than Water,\" and \"Shadow Dancing\" - and co-hosted the TV series \"Solid Gold.\" But drug problems and depression led to his early death in 1988, at age 30.\n\nThe Bee Gees\n\nIn 2003, Maurice Gibb died suddenly from a tangled intestine at age 53. \"He was absolutely fine one day, and 48 hours later he was dead,\" said Barry.\n\nBarry and Robin admitted to Mason that Maurice's death divided them: \"We just were unable to communicate with each other,\" Barry said.\n\n\"I think we got afraid of each other,\" Robin said. \"I don't know what it was.\"\n\nAlthough the two would regroup to write music together, Robin died in 2012 of cancer.\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nThe last surviving member of the Bee Gees, Barry Gibb, performs during his limited six-show \"Mythology: The Tour Live,\" at Wells Fargo Center on May 19, 2014 in Philadelphia, Pa.\n\nBoston\n\nAccording to Barry's son, Stephen (who joined him on the tour), his father felt the risk of going back out solo. \"He's a 67-year-old pop icon, or whatever you wanna call him,\" Stephen told Anthony Mason. \"And he's like, 'Do people care still? And will people still wanna hear it?' And I made it my job to tell him as often as I could, 'Believe me, they really wanna hear it. You gotta get out there.'\"\n\nBoston\n\nBarry Gibb is joined on the tour by Maurice's daughter, Samantha. Together they sing, \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?\"\n\n\"I'll walk off after a moment of doing 'How Can You Mend,' and I'll cry, you know?\" she said. \"But I'm happy. It's actually because we're looking at each other and we're both, like, healing. And we're grieving when we sing to each other.\n\n\"We both struggled after my Dad died, too,\" she continued, tearing up. \"So it was a great way to connect.\"\n\nBoston\n\nFor more info:\n\nbeegees.com\n\nFollow the Bee Gees on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube\n\nBarry Gibb tour dates / tickets - Through June 4 (TicketMaster)\n\nTD Garden, Boston"
