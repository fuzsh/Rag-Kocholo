There's a discipline in what he's doing. Apply that discipline to how you want to behave.\"\n\nGibb, who admitted he \"never could dance,\" nonetheless got the world toe-tapping with decades of hits that began when he performed with his brothers Robin and Maurice (both of whom have since died) as the Bee Gees in 1958. Though they had significant success with their early tunes, they became the kings of disco when the soundtrack of \"Saturday Night Fever\" was released in 1977.\n\nBut despite the hits, Gibb, who is heading out on tour again in May to play some of the old favorites, said he and his brothers never felt like they were on top of anything, noting that they lived \"life in a tin can.\"\n\n\"I've always thought that the odds were always against us,\" he said. \"Maybe because we were brothers and we were kids on Australian television so maybe some people thought we were precocious, but we were just kids. And when we came to England, they told us, 'Don't bother to leave Australia. You'll never make it.'\"\n\nThe Brothers Gibb (which is where \"Bee Gees\" came from) proved everyone wrong. Even today, their music shows up as an influence in hits including Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\" and Daft Punk's \"Get Lucky,\" in part because disco never dies, and the Bee Gees had a truly influential sound.\n\nSo original, Lauer had to suggest to Gibb, \"Let's get in the shower together.\" After a quick double take and a chuckle, he clarified, \"What song is the one that is your go-to shower song?\"\n\nGibb, naturally, couldn't pick just one. \"There's so many I love,\" he said, crooning a bit of \"Stardust\" by Nat King Cole. \"I love all the old songs.\"\n\nFans who tuned in immediately tweeted their love for the surviving Bee Gee.\n\nAnd+now+I+will+spend+the+rest+of+the+day+listening+to+the+Saturday+Night+Fever+Soundtrack+#BarryGibb+@TODAYshow+@MLauer\n\nâ€”+Jennifer+S.+(@RHOAmbler)+January+30,+2014\n\n+\n\nYES!+Woke+up+just+in+time+to+see+Barry+Gibb+on+TODAY!+So+much+soul+in+that+mans+voice! ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶\n\nâ€”+Sugar+Slam+(@ImSugarSlam)+January+30,+2014\n\n+\n\nWhew.+I+still+love+Barry+Gibb.+Back+to+my+10yo+self.+#today\n\nâ€”+Kathy+(@stresscake)+January+30,+2014\n\n+\n\nBut at least one was thwarted by academic pursuits, proving Gibb's fans span many generations.\n\nBARRY+GIBB+FROM+THE+BEEGEES+IS+LIVE+ON+THE+TODAY+SHOW+THIS+MORNING+AND+//YOURE+TELLING+ME+I+HAVE+TO+GO+TO+SCHOOL//\n\nâ€”+scotty+(@johndenvr)+January+30,+2014\n\n+"
