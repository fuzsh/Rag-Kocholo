        "text": "How deep is the Bee Gees' catalog? More than deep enough for a Broadway musical, for certain.\n\nAccording to Playbill, Barry Gibb will executive produce a new biographical musical spanning the career and catalog of the legendary GRAMMY-winning brotherly trio. Universal Theatre Group, the live theater division for Universal Music Group, has acquired the rights to produce the as-yet-untitled project.\n\n\"I'm personally very excited to be a part of the creative process along with Yvonne [Gibb, widow of the late Maurice Gibb] and Dwina [who was married to the late Robin Gibb],\" said Barry Gibb via statement. \"It's another adventure for us and a chance to throw the spotlight on all my brothers and finally the real story of us will be told. It's an honor to be working alongside the people I most respect. I can't wait to get started!\"\n\nThe musical's full creative team, production timeline and performance location have yet to be announced.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NpqmGx7meQw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nFormed in 1958, the Bee Gees recorded 30 Top 40 hits, including nine No. 1 hits from 1971's \"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\" to 1979's \"Love You Inside Out.\" The only other groups in history to score more No. 1 hits than the Bee Gees are the Beatles (20) and the Supremes (12).\n\nThe iconic soundtrack to 1977's Saturday Night Fever (GRAMMY Hall Of Fame, 2004), which featured Bee Gees smashes such as \"Night Fever,\" \"Stayin' Alive\" and \"How Deep Is Your Love,\" hit No. 1.\n\nThe Bee Gees won five GRAMMY Awards during their career, in addition to being honored with the GRAMMY Legend Award in 2003 and Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015.\n\nEarlier this year, The Recording Academy paid tribute to the five-time GRAMMY-winning trio with the CBS TV special \"Stayin' Alive: A GRAMMY Salute To The Music Of The Bee Gees,\" which featured performances by Keith Urban, Demi Lovato, DNCE, Ed Sheeran, and Tori Kelly, among others.\n\nWatch: Saturday Night Fever Wins Album Of The Year\n\nOn April 20th, GRAMMY U members and industry professionals gathered at the Times Center in New York City for the 2024 GRAMMY U Conference presented by Amazon Music.\n\nThe GRAMMY U team prepared an action-packed and motivating day of panels \"Live From New York,\" focusing on topics from live performances to the business behind Broadway productions. Keynote speaker Ben Platt talked about the transition from a Broadway star to recording his solo studio album, followed by a performance workshop with Billy Porter, and live music production on late night television with Remi Wolf.\n\nOnce members arrived, they took advantage of professional development opportunities and mingled with other GRAMMY U members before attending the conference panels. Attendees visited the robust Career Center which included a professional headshot station, resume review station, and a dedicated speed networking hour with industry professionals within the Recording Academy, Amazon Music and more. These collaborations allowed for the next generation of music creatives and professionals to gain first-hand experience with mentors across various business sectors and musical genres.\n\nBelow are five impactful takeaways from the 2024 GRAMMY U Conference.\n\nShed Your Armor To Embrace Vulnerability\n\nAfter a two-year performance run on Broadway starring in \"Dear Evan Hansen\", Ben Platt shifted his priority toward making original music and sharing personal storylines.\n\nIn \"Live! With Ben Platt,\" moderated by actor and long-time best friend of Platt's, Beanie Feldstein discussed Platt's bold choice of stepping back from portraying fictional characters on stage, to now releasing original music with his upcoming album Honeymind.\n\n\"The gratification of connecting with your own experiences and seeing people really use the songs in their lives is so infinitely beyond the worries,\" Platt shared.\n\nCrossing over from a Broadway stage to pop music, Platt suggested that a key to success is trusting one's vocal technique and individual sound to translate your perspective.\n\nBeanie Feldstein with keynote speaker Ben Platt at the GRAMMY U Conference | Photo: Rob Kim/Getty Images for The Recording Academy\n\nConsistently Perfect The Fundamentals\n\nDuring the performance workshop \"Standing in the Spotlight with Billy Porter,\" GRAMMY, Emmy, and two-time Tony Award-Winner Billy Porter sat down with SiriusXM Program Director Julie James. They discussed the importance of performance critique in helping artists perfect their craft and captivate audiences, as well as strategies for maintaining overall health while on tour.\n\nPorter mentioned that while critiques are important for artists to continue improving their vocal abilities, knowing how to meet personal needs and goals is just as important.\n\n\"As you sift through [critiques], you have the right to choose what's right for you and what isn't,\" Porter said before posing the question, \"What notes are good for your vision, and which aren't?\"\n\nLeft to Right: GRAMMY U Performer Roy Gantz, Billy Porter and moderator Julie James | Photo: Rob Kim/Getty Images for The Recording Academy\n\nThis marked the first time GRAMMY U included a performance workshop in its programming, and it provided a fresh perspective from the best in the business. GRAMMY U National Membership Representative Roy Gantz sang \"Someone to Watch Over Me,\" accompanied on piano by Tedd Firth, and received real-time feedback from Billy Porter in front of a live audience.\n\n\"From the minute you hit the stage, to when you get to that mic[rophone], it's about your presence. Keep connecting with us [the audience],\" Porter told Gantz.\n\nPorter emphasized the importance of mastering the original melody and musical notations of a song before incorporating riffs and embellishments of popular pieces, and praised Gantz for his advanced technique and interpretation.\n\n\"Believe in what you have to offer. In honoring your authenticity, you teach people on the outside how to receive you,\" Porter advised the audience.\n\nStay Vocal, Relationships Are Everything\n\n\"On the Screen: Performing On Live TV\" featured panelists Yeji Cha-Beach, the Music Associate Producer on NBC's Late Night with Seth Meyers Show, Marnie Stern, former member of the 8G Band on the Seth Meyers Show, and pop recording artist Remi Wolf. Moderated by Siobhan Schanda, the panelists discussed the intricacies of playing on a live TV set including lighting, sound, and design choices. Wolf mentioned her preference for performing with her touring musicians and a live band.\n\n\"Put the music first and try to develop your own style,\" Wolf said. \"The most I've ever felt proud of my work was when I followed my gut.\"\n\nStern remarked that although socializing and navigating the music industry network did not always come naturally, connecting and playing with other musicians was vital to her success as a live TV musician. She described one of the biggest differences between playing on live television and working on her own recording artistry.\n\n\"You're selling a commercial product and your job is to entertain,\" Stern said. \"With your own work, your job is to present your feelings and emotions. Everyone is working to further not only the artist but the network.\"\n\nCha-Beach offered guidance for aspiring TV music producers, stating, \"Be curious, try as many things as you possibly can. Knowing when to say yes is just as important as knowing when to say no.\"\n\nLeft to Right: Siobhan Schanda (moderator), Yeji Cha-Beach, Marnie Stern, Remi Wolf; Close-up photo of Remi Wolf | Photos: Rob Kim/Getty Images for The Recording Academy\n\nA Great Musical Takes Time\n\nThe \"Sounds of the Stage\" panel conducted a candid conversation about the behind-the-scenes process of composing and writing music for musicals. Kurt Deutsch (Senior Vice President at Warner Music Entertainment and Theatrical Ventures) was joined by David Lai (Co-Founder Park Avenue Artists), Kathy Sommer (Composer, Conductor, Producer), and moderator Thomas Winkler (Head of Publisher, Songwriter, and Society Relations at Amazon Music).\n\nThese panelists conducted a candid conversation about the behind-the-scenes process of composing and writing music for musicals. They focused on how Broadway theater experience translated into the process of recording live studio albums.\n\n\"You can't bring it to the stage until the bones are set, until things are solidified,\" Lai said. It's worth spending the time to use the resources we have to work on your material.\"\n\nDeutsch described the nuances of recording a pop album versus a cast performance record which has quick turnaround times. Often, they are recorded in a single day-long session due to budgeting costs for the orchestra and cast members involved.\n\nThe main goal of a cast album is to allow audiences to relive the emotional experience they had in the theater setting, and for newcomers to still be able to relate to the show's characters and themes through a sonic medium.\n\nLeft to Right: Thomas Winkler (moderator), David Lai, Kurt Deutsch and Kathy Sommer | Photo: Rob Kim/Getty Images for The Recording Academy\n\n'Content Is Queen': Prioritize Meaningful Storytelling\n\n\"Side Stage: The Team Behind the Curtain\" featured Erich Bergen (Producer, Actor, Director, 6W Entertainment); Pete Ganbarg (President of A&R, Atlantic Records); Adam Hess (Executive Producer, DR Theatrical Management); Christen James (Tony Award-Nominated Broadway Producer); and Michael Kushner (Founder and Creator of Michael Kushner Photography & Dear Multi-Hyphenate).\n\nTogether, these creatives explored the business of Broadway and discussed the roles of producers and managers who bring the shows to life. James spoke about what she's most drawn to when beginning a new theatrical project.\n\n\"Meaningful storytelling is key [and] music absolutely makes the difference. Content is queen, the story as well as the music,\" she said. \"Art is supposed to change what you're doing to the point where you're thinking about it, it's influencing you.\"\n\nLeft to Right: Michael Kushner (moderator), Erich Bergen, Pete Ganbarg, Adam Hess and Christen James | Photo: Rob Kim/Getty Images for The Recording Academy\n\nPresented by Amazon Music and with participating sponsorship from Mastercard, GRAMMY U's 2024 conference \"Live From New York\" engaged members through an exhilarating two-day summit.\n\nFrom the Friday showcase with GRAMMY U performers to Saturday's slew of panels covering all things show business, the GRAMMY U Conference in the Big Apple helped inform, connect, and inspire GRAMMY U members across the nation.\n\nRelive the experience and watch all the panels again here.\n\n5 Takeaways From GRAMMY U's Masterclass With Andrew McMahon: Be Bold, Build Bonds & Embrace Your Fears\n\nIt’s a busy spring season on Broadway, with 11 musicals opening by April 25 — the cutoff for this year’s Tony Award eligibility.\n\nSpring 2024 musicals span a wide range of styles and genres, from adaptations of literary classics and histories, to timeless revivals and jukebox musicals from GRAMMY winners Huey Lewis and Alicia Keys. The season also features some recognizable singers including Deborah Cox, Jeremy Jordan, Shoshana Bean, and Brandon Victor Dixon.\n\nHere’s a breakdown (in alphabetical order) of what’s playing; unless listed, all of the following musicals have open run dates.\n\n\"Cabaret\"\n\nAugust Wilson Theatre\n\nSet within the seedy Kit Kat Club in 1930s Berlin as the Nazi regime was beginning to take over, \"Cabaret\" premiered on Broadway in 1966. The hit play starred Joel Grey as the Emcee and Jill Haworth. Sally Bowles, with music and lyrics by the legendary John Kander and the late Fred Ebb. In 1972, the musical was turned into a movie starring Gray and Liza Minnelli; it subsequently won eight Academy Awards, including Best Actor and Actress for Grey and Minnelli.\n\nThe 2024 revival stars Eddie Redmayne as the Emcee, who will perform in the round on an immersive set. While the stage may be different, fans can still expect unique renditions of iconic songs such as \"Willkommen,\" \"Cabaret\" and \"Don’t Tell Mama.\"\n\n\"Hell's Kitchen\"\n\nShubert Theater\n\nSixteen-time GRAMMY winner Alicia Keys brings her artistry from the Super Bowl to the Broadway stage in the jukebox musical \"Hell’s Kitchen.\" Loosely based on Keys' life growing up in the Manhattan neighborhood of Hell’s Kitchen, the story centers around 17-year-old Ali, played by newcomer Maleah Joi Moon, as she navigates her teenage years through love and loss.\n\nWritten by Pulitzer Prize-finalist playwright Kristoffer Diaz, \"Hell's Kitchen\" features songs by Keys with new arrangements, as well as the recently debuted \"Kaleidoscope.\" Shoshana Bean and two-time GRAMMY nominee Brandon Victor Dixon co-star in the musical, all reprising their roles from its premiere at the Public Theatre last fall.\n\n\"Illinoise\"\n\nSt. James Theatre\n\nApril 24 - Aug. 10\n\nThis new, dance-centered musical was the last show to announce its arrival on Broadway this season, and is moving from the New York’s Upper East Side Park Avenue Armory after a sold out run in order to meet the Tony Award eligibility deadline.\n\n\"Illinoise\" features music by GRAMMY-nominated musician Sufjan Stevens and is based on his beloved 2005 concept album Illinois. The album features stories, people and places from the state. The show is conceived and choreographed by Justin Peck, of the New York City Ballet, who also choreographed Maestro and Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story. \"‘Illinoise’ is a coming-of-age story that takes the audience on a journey through the American heartland — from campfire storytelling to the edges of the cosmos — all told in through a unique blend of music, dance, and theater,\" Peck said in a statement.\n\nDancers featured in the show include Yesenia Ayala, Gaby Diaz, Jeanette Delgado and Ben Cook, who also were in West Side Story.\n\n\"Lempicka\"\n\nLongacre Theatre\n\n\"Lempicka\" is a brand new, original musical with a \"pop infused sound\" with a script and lyrics by Carson Kreitzer and book and music by Matt Gould.\n\nThe musical tells the tale of real Polish painter Tamara de Lempicka, who was famous for her art deco portraits of aristocrats and highly stylized nude paintings. While Lempicka changed art and culture in the late 1800s, she struggled with decades of political and personal turmoil. Eden Espinosa stars in the title role, and previously played Elphaba in \"Wicked.\" Amber Iman, the first woman to perform on Broadway after the Coronavirus shutdown and Tony Award winner Beth Leavel also star in the show.\n\n\"The Great Gatsby\"\n\nBroadway Theatre\n\nFirst it was a book, turned into a movie, and now a Broadway musical. \"The Great Gatsby\" is based on F. Scott Fitzgerald’s literary classic, and has all the glitz and jazz-aged glam of the 1925 novel.\n\nStarring Jeremy Jordan as Long Island millionaire Jay Gatsby and Eva Noblezada as Daisy Buchanan, the Broadway adaptation features all new music with a modern jazz and pop score by Jason Howland with lyrics by Nathan Tysen. As in the book, \"Gatsby\" tells the story of how Gatsby is after his long lost love Daisy and all the stops to bring her back into his life.\n\n\"The Heart of Rock and Roll\"\n\nJames Earl Jones Theatre\n\nSongs by GRAMMY winners Huey Lewis & the News appear in two new musicals this season. \"The Power of Love\" is featured in \"Back to the Future\" (which opened last summer) and the new jukebox musical, \"The Heart of Rock and Roll.\"\n\nSet in 1987 and featuring many hits from the time, the story centers on the young couple, played by Cory Cottand McKenzie Kurtz, who work at the same company and eventually fall in love. Bobby, a rock and roller, trades his guitar for the corporate ladder and his boss Cassandra is always putting the family business first. The musical is jam packed with Huey Lewis megahits like \"Do You Believe in Love\", \"Hip to Be Square,\" and \"If This Is It.\"\n\n\"The Notebook\"\n\nSchoenfeld Theatre\n\nSinger/songwriter Ingrid Michaelon wrote the music and lyrics for this tear-jerker musical adapted from Nicholas Sparks’ best-selling novel and the classic romantic movie starring Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling. Michaelson admits she’s best at the \"weepy and romantic\" songs.\n\nThe musical tells the story of how leads Allie and Noah shared a lifetime of love despite growing up in opposite socioeconomic classes. And if you’re wondering: yes, the famous rain scene from the movie makes a big splash with audiences on Broadway.\n\n\"The Outsiders\"\n\nBernard B. Jacobs Theater\n\n\"The Outsiders\" transforms S.E. Hinton's novel — perhaps most famous for the 1983 movie starring Matt Damon, Patrick Swayze and Tom Cruise — into a Broadway musical. One of its co-producers is Angelina Jolie, who saw the show with her family when it debuted out-of-town in California.\n\n\"The Outsiders\" features a book by Adam Rapp with Justin Levine, along with music and lyrics by Jamestown Revival (Jonathan Clay & Zach Chance) and Justin Levine. Set in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1967, Ponyboy Curtis and Johnny Cade along with their fellow Outsiders battle their rivals, the Socs.\n\n\"The Who’s Tommy\"\n\nNederlander Theatre\n\nPerhaps the most famous song from 1975 rock opera The Who’s Tommy is \"Pinball Wizard\" written by guitarist Pete Townshend. The musician won a GRAMMY for Best Musical Show Album in 1993 for the musical’s original cast recording.\n\nDes McAnuff — who co-wrote the musical's script with Townshend and also directed the original musical 30 years ago — is back in the director’s chair for this revival. The musical, about a boy who finds a knack for playing pinball, is based on the Who’s 1969 album, Tommy. It was also turned into a 1975 film called Tommy, which starred Elton John, Tina Turner, Ann Margaret and Roger Daltry as Tommy. On Broadway, Ali Louis Bourzgui stars in the title role.\n\n\"The Wiz\"\n\nMarquis Theatre\n\nEase on down the road to the Marquis Theatre! \"The Wiz\" returns to Broadway for the first time since it premiered back in 1974 for a limited run followed by subsequent shows around the country. The show is based on The Wizard of Oz and, in 1978, was turned into a film starring Diana Ross as Dorothy and Michael Jackson as the Tinman.\n\nThe revival features music and lyrics by Charlie Smalls, and book by William F. Brown with script updates by Amber Ruffin (whose Some Like It Hot won Best Musical Theater Album at the 2024 GRAMMYs). JaQuel Knight, who choreographed Beyoncé’s \"Single Ladies,\" choreographed \"The Wiz.\"\n\nNewcomer Nichelle Lewis plays Dorothy along with Wayne Brady as The Wiz and Deborah Cox as Glinda. Look out for Avery Wilson as the Scarecrow; the R&B singer appeared on \"The Voice\" and their single \"Kiss The Sky\" cracked the Top 20 on Billboard’s R&B chart.\n\n\"Suffs\"\n\nMusic Box Theatre\n\nOn the heels of \"Hamilton\" is a historic musical called \"Suffs.\" It’s 1913 and the women’s suffrage movement is heating up in America. The suffragists, or \"Suffs,\" are relentless in their pursuit of the right to vote.\n\nShaina Taub stars as Alice Paul, one of the leaders of the National Women’s Party. Taub also wrote the book, music and lyrics (She’s also collabing with five-time GRAMMY winner Elton John on the \"Devil Wears Prada\" musical). \"Suffs\" is produced by Hillary Clinton, tying the suffrage movement to contemporary politics in a tangible way.\n\n\"Water for Elephants\"\n\nImperial Theatre\n\nSara Gruen’s novel and 2011 film adaptation has now turned into a musical with music/lyrics by PigPen Theatre Co.\n\nRick Elice (known for writing the book for \"Jersey Boys\") puts his stamp on this show about Jacob Jankowski, who jumps on a train finding a new home with a traveling circus.\n\nLike \"The Notebook,\" this \"memory musical\" is told from his point of view as an old man and goes back and forth between the present and the past when he worked for the circus. Audiences will love the aerial tricks and impressive elephant puppetry. \"\n\nArtists Who Are Going On Tour In 2024: The Rolling Stones, Drake, Olivia Rodrigo & More\n\nUpdated Friday Oct. 13, 2023 to include info about Kendrick Lamar's most recent GRAMMY wins, as of the 2023 GRAMMYs.\n\nA GRAMMY veteran these days, Kendrick Lamar has won 17 GRAMMYs and has received 47 GRAMMY nominations overall. A sizable chunk of his trophies came from the 58th annual GRAMMY Awards in 2016, when he walked away with five — including his first-ever win in the Best Rap Album category.\n\nThis installment of GRAMMY Rewind turns back the clock to 2016, revisiting Lamar's acceptance speech upon winning Best Rap Album for To Pimp A Butterfly. Though Lamar was alone on stage, he made it clear that he wouldn't be at the top of his game without the help of a broad support system.\n\n\"First off, all glory to God, that's for sure,\" he said, kicking off a speech that went on to thank his parents, who he described as his \"those who gave me the responsibility of knowing, of accepting the good with the bad.\"\n\nLooking for more GRAMMYs news? The 2024 GRAMMY nominations are here!\n\nHe also extended his love and gratitude to his fiancée, Whitney Alford, and shouted out his Top Dawg Entertainment labelmates. Lamar specifically praised Top Dawg's CEO, Anthony Tiffith, for finding and developing raw talent that might not otherwise get the chance to pursue their musical dreams.\n\n\"We'd never forget that: Taking these kids out of the projects, out of Compton, and putting them right here on this stage, to be the best that they can be,\" Lamar — a Compton native himself — continued, leading into an impassioned conclusion spotlighting some of the cornerstone rap albums that came before To Pimp a Butterfly.\n\n\"Hip-hop. Ice Cube. This is for hip-hop,\" he said. \"This is for Snoop Dogg, Doggystyle. This is for Illmatic, this is for Nas. We will live forever. Believe that.\"\n\nTo Pimp a Butterfly singles \"Alright\" and \"These Walls\" earned Lamar three more GRAMMYs that night, the former winning Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song and the latter taking Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (the song features Bilal, Anna Wise and Thundercat). He also won Best Music Video for the remix of Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood.\"\n\nLamar has since won Best Rap Album two more times, taking home the golden gramophone in 2018 for his blockbuster LP DAMN., and in 2023 for his bold fifth album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.\n\nWatch Lamar's full acceptance speech above, and check back at GRAMMY.com every Friday for more GRAMMY Rewind episodes.\n\n10 Essential Facts To Know About GRAMMY-Winning Rapper J. Cole\n\nIt's rare that a genre can be traced back to a single artist or group, but for funk, that was James Brown. The Godfather of Soul coined the phrase and style of playing known as \"on the one,\" where the first downbeat is emphasized, instead of the typical second and fourth beats in pop, soul and other styles. As David Cheal eloquently explains, playing on the one \"left space for phrases and riffs, often syncopated around the beat, creating an intricate, interlocking grid which could go on and on.\" You know a funky bassline when you hear it; its fat chords beg your body to get up and groove.\n\nBrown's 1965 classic, \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,\" became one of the first funk hits, and has been endlessly sampled and covered over the years, along with his other groovy tracks. Of course, many other funk acts followed in the '60s, and the genre thrived in the '70s and '80s as the disco craze came and went, and the originators of hip-hop and house music created new music from funk and disco's strong, flexible bones built for dancing.\n\nLegendary funk bassist Bootsy Collins learned the power of the one from playing in Brown's band, and brought it to George Clinton, who created P-funk, an expansive, Afrofuturistic, psychedelic exploration of funk with his various bands and projects, including Parliament-Funkadelic. Both Collins and Clinton remain active and funkin', and have offered their timeless grooves to collabs with younger artists, including Kali Uchis, Silk Sonic, and Omar Apollo; and Kendrick Lamar, Flying Lotus, and Thundercat, respectively.\n\nIn the 1980s, electro-funk was born when artists like Afrika Bambaataa, Man Parrish, and Egyptian Lover began making futuristic beats with the Roland TR-808 drum machine — often with robotic vocals distorted through a talk box. A key distinguishing factor of electro-funk is a de-emphasis on vocals, with more phrases than choruses and verses. The sound influenced contemporaneous hip-hop, funk and electronica, along with acts around the globe, while current acts like Chromeo, DJ Stingray, and even Egyptian Lover himself keep electro-funk alive and well.\n\nToday, funk lives in many places, with its heavy bass and syncopated grooves finding way into many nooks and crannies of music. There's nu-disco and boogie funk, nodding back to disco bands with soaring vocals and dance floor-designed instrumentation. G-funk continues to influence Los Angeles hip-hop, with innovative artists like Dam-Funk and Channel Tres bringing the funk and G-funk, into electro territory. Funk and disco-centered '70s revival is definitely having a moment, with acts like Ghost Funk Orchestra and Parcels, while its sparkly sprinklings can be heard in pop from Dua Lipa, Doja Cat, and, in full \"Soul Train\" character, Silk Sonic. There are also acts making dreamy, atmospheric music with a solid dose of funk, such as Khruangbin’s global sonic collage.\n\nThere are many bands that play heavily with funk, creating lush grooves designed to get you moving. Read on for a taste of five current modern funk and nu-disco artists making band-led uptempo funk built for the dance floor. Be sure to press play on the Spotify playlist above, and check out GRAMMY.com's playlist on Apple Music, Amazon Music and Pandora.\n\nSay She She\n\nAptly self-described as \"discodelic soul,\" Brooklyn-based seven-piece Say She She make dreamy, operatic funk, led by singer-songwriters Nya Gazelle Brown, Piya Malik and Sabrina Mileo Cunningham. Their '70s girl group-inspired vocal harmonies echo, sooth and enchant as they cover poignant topics with feminist flair.\n\nWhile they’ve been active in the New York scene for a few years, they’ve gained wider acclaim for the irresistible music they began releasing this year, including their debut album, Prism. Their 2022 debut single \"Forget Me Not\" is an ode to ground-breaking New York art collective Guerilla Girls, and \"Norma\" is their protest anthem in response to the news that Roe vs. Wade could be (and was) overturned. The band name is a nod to funk legend Nile Rodgers, from the \"Le freak, c'est chi\" exclamation in Chic's legendary tune \"Le Freak.\"\n\nMoniquea\n\nMoniquea's unique voice oozes confidence, yet invites you in to dance with her to the super funky boogie rhythms. The Pasadena, California artist was raised on funk music; her mom was in a cover band that would play classics like Aretha Franklin’s \"Get It Right\" and Gladys Knight’s \"Love Overboard.\" Moniquea released her first boogie funk track at 20 and, in 2011, met local producer XL Middelton — a bonafide purveyor of funk. She's been a star artist on his MoFunk Records ever since, and they've collabed on countless tracks, channeling West Coast energy with a heavy dose of G-funk, sunny lyrics and upbeat, roller disco-ready rhythms.\n\nHer latest release is an upbeat nod to classic West Coast funk, produced by Middleton, and follows her February 2022 groovy, collab-filled album, On Repeat.\n\nShiro Schwarz\n\nShiro Schwarz is a Mexico City-based duo, consisting of Pammela Rojas and Rafael Marfil, who helped establish a modern funk scene in the richly creative Mexican metropolis. On \"Electrify\" — originally released in 2016 on Fat Beats Records and reissued in 2021 by MoFunk — Shiro Schwarz's vocals playfully contrast each other, floating over an insistent, upbeat bassline and an '80s throwback electro-funk rhythm with synth flourishes.\n\nTheir music manages to be both nostalgic and futuristic — and impossible to sit still to. 2021 single \"Be Kind\" is sweet, mellow and groovy, perfect chic lounge funk. Shiro Schwarz’s latest track, the joyfully nostalgic \"Hey DJ,\" is a collab with funkstress Saucy Lady and U-Key.\n\nL'Impératrice\n\nL'Impératrice (the empress in French) are a six-piece Parisian group serving an infectiously joyful blend of French pop, nu-disco, funk and psychedelia. Flore Benguigui's vocals are light and dreamy, yet commanding of your attention, while lyrics have a feminist touch.\n\nDuring their energetic live sets, L'Impératrice members Charles de Boisseguin and Hagni Gwon (keys), David Gaugué (bass), Achille Trocellier (guitar), and Tom Daveau (drums) deliver extended instrumental jam sessions to expand and connect their music. Gaugué emphasizes the thick funky bass, and Benguigui jumps around the stage while sounding like an angel. L’Impératrice’s latest album, 2021’s Tako Tsubo, is a sunny, playful French disco journey.\n\nFranc Moody\n\nFranc Moody's bio fittingly describes their music as \"a soul funk and cosmic disco sound.\" The London outfit was birthed by friends Ned Franc and Jon Moody in the early 2010s, when they were living together and throwing parties in North London's warehouse scene. In 2017, the group grew to six members, including singer and multi-instrumentalist Amber-Simone.\n\nTheir music feels at home with other electro-pop bands like fellow Londoners Jungle and Aussie act Parcels. While much of it is upbeat and euphoric, Franc Moody also dips into the more chilled, dreamy realm, such as the vibey, sultry title track from their recently released Into the Ether.\n\nThe Rise Of Underground House: How Artists Like Fisher & Acraze Have Taken Tech House, Other Electronic Genres From Indie To EDC"
