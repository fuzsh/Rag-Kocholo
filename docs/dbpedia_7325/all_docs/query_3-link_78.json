        "text": "On paper, Barry Gibb is a superstar. Sorry, I should say \"Sir\" Barry Gibb, the only surviving member of the Bee Gees, and one of the most successful songwriters of all time. And yes, he's also been knighted. But in person, Gibb is exceedingly humble, kind, and as you'll hear in this episode, deeply interested in and excited by making music.\n\nSome backstory: Barry Gibb was born on the Isle of Man and moved with his family to Australia when he was a boy. That family included his three younger brothers, including Bee Gees bandmates Robin and Maurice. Their journey is explored in a new HBO documentary called The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart â€“ and now, Barry Gibb has released a new album that presents some of the songs he and his brothers wrote in a whole new way. On Greenfields: The Gibb Brothers Songbook Vol 1, Barry Gibb performs along with folks like Dolly Parton, Jason Isbell and Brandi Carlile.\n\nIn this episode, Barry Gibb and Greenfields producer Dave Cobb join me to talk about how this album came together."
