        "text": "Produced by Barry and co-producer John Merchant, In The Now is only the second solo effort of Gibb's career and his first album of all new material since the Bee Gees final studio album in 2001. The new album is an impassioned solo effort that signals a welcome return of one of the most identifiable and versatile voices in the history of rock, pop, and R&B. The entire album was recorded in Miami with the same gathering of accomplished musicians Barry assembled for his acclaimed 2014 solo tour. Among the songs included on In The Now (full track listing below) are the stirring title track, \"Star Crossed Lovers,\" \"Home Truth Song,\" \"Cross To Bear,\" \"Shadows,\" \"Diamonds,\" and the album's inspired closer, \"End Of The Rainbow.\"\n\nBarry is supporting the epic album release with a series of rare TV appearances next week, including The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on October 12, The Today Show on NBC on October 13, and CBS This Morning's Saturday Sessions on October 15. A once-in-a-lifetime special listening party for In The Now with Barry attending, himself, will be held at New York City's Joe's Pub (declared one of the Ten Best clubs in America by Rolling Stone) on October 14, 5:30 pm EST.\n\nWith a career that spans more than five decades, Barry Gibb stands as one of the most prolific icons in music history. As a record producer/songwriter, Barry has been instrumental in creating milestones for other artists, as well, ranging from Barbra Streisand's 'Guilty' album to Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers country record 'Islands In The Stream' also, Diana Ross 'Eaten Alive featuring 'Chain Reaction' as well as Dionne Warwick's 'Heartbreaker' album.\n\nBetween Robin, Maurice and Andy, the Gibb brothers achieved 19 number one records on the Billboard charts including a phenomenal 6 in a row, equaling The Beatles record.\n\n\"I will never forget my brothers; they will always be a part of everything I do. Our dream came true.\"\n\nBarry returned to live performing in 2013-2014 with the Mythology Tour, celebrating the Bee Gees anthology release of the same name as a tribute to his three brothers. The acclaimed tour included shows in Australia, New Zealand, England, Ireland, and The U.S., garnering an outpouring of affection and critical praise from around the world.\n\nTrack listing for In The Now:\n\nIn the Now\n\nGrand Illusion\n\nStar Crossed Lovers\n\nBlowin' a Fuse\n\nHome Truth Song\n\nMeaning of the Word\n\nCross to Bear\n\nShadows\n\nAmy In Colour\n\nThe Long Goodbye\n\nDiamonds\n\nEnd of the Rainbow\n\nFor more information, please visit http://www.barrygibb.com/.
