        "text": "Once it emerged that Justin Timberlake was returning to Saturday Night Live, it was inevitable that Barry Gibb would make an appearance.\n\nTimberlake and Jimmy Fallon brought The Barry Gibb Talk Show back for its seventh appearance – over 10 years since it was last on the show.\n\nWatch above.\n\nAs ever, the Tonight Show host and the former NSync star played Barry Gibb and his quiet brother Robin, who doesn’t have anything to add.\n\nContinuing to use the Bee Gees’ “Nights on Broadway” as the basis for their parody, the Gibbs were joined by Bowen Yang, Keenan Thompson and host Dakota Johnson.\n\n“You look like if Don King ate another Don King,” said Fallon’s Barry Gibb. “I fear nothing; I watched Saltburn with my entire family and I knew about the bathtub scene beforehand.”\n\n“I am legend; I have not cried in 77 years except for Australian show Bluey,” he added. “If you don’t cry at Bluey, you’re not a real man.”\n\nThe sketch kicked off in 2003 when Timberlake hosted and Fallon was still on staff. Timberlake and his then-girlfriend Cameron Diaz brought it back, with Fallon, as he was promoting Fever Pitch, in April 2005. Timberlake and Fallon returned in December 2006, May 2009 and May 2011, before its last skit before tonight in December 2013, when Barry Gibb made a surprise appearance, a year after Robin’s death."
