        "text": "When Barry Gibb cheekily revealed what gets him 'in the mood' on TV\n\nBeing a singer in one of the world's biggest musical groups mean you'd be idolised by millions.\n\nAnd given that Barry Gibb was exactly that, he no doubt received his fair share of attention from the opposite sex.\n\nStanding broad and tall between his brother on stage, Barry was often mistaken as being the lead singer of the Bee Gees due to his unique falsetto carrying the majority of their songs.\n\nAndy Gibb outshines older brother Barry with jaw dropping solo of Bee Gees’ ‘Words’ in 1981\n\nBarry Gibb credits Eric Clapton for changing the Bee Gees' fortunes during the 1970s\n\nBee Gees first TV gig: Teenage Barry Gibb and 10 year olds Robin and Maurice sing in 1960\n\nSo, being considered the lead singer means he was regularly the focal point and received a lot of adoration for it.\n\nThough after the trio's MTV interview in 1993, I'm sure the eyes of each and every one of their dedicated fanbase lit up.\n\nThat's because he revealed what gets him 'in the mood', let's just say.\n\nAppearing on MTV's Most Wanted, there's an interview section where the artist/guest plays 'Wall Of Death', answering frequently irreverent questions that the interviewer picks randomly from the board in front of them.\n\nDespite their phenomenal success, the Bee Gees were always grounded and relied on their dry sense of humour to keep it that way.\n\nThey almost ruined that reputation a few years later in 1997 after storming out of the excruciatingly awkward interview with Clive Anderson after the host repeatedly attempted to humiliate the band throughout.\n\nBut up until that point they were praised for their typically British sensibilities and willingness to poke fun at themselves. And each other.\n\nThis was the case during their hilarious MTV interview, as they giggle and cackle whilst answering silly questions with even sillier answers.\n\nAnd they were clearly happy to muck in, answering questions like 'What's the worst song you've ever recorded?', 'Have you ever had sex in a public place?' and 'Would you all pose naked for money?'.\n\nBarry swiftly answered the latter question with: \"We'd all pose naked for nothing!\" which no doubt tickled the fancy of their fans.\n\nBut when giving an answer to the question 'What are you like when you're drunk?', there were no doubt a spike in sales for a particular beverage.\n\nAfter Maurice chimes in with \"I don't know, I don't remember!\", Barry goes on to talk about his choice of poison.\n\nIt turns out to be sake, the fermented Japanese rice wine that he drinks exclusively.\n\n\"I'm a sake drinker, I don't drink anything else. So it has to be heated up like a hot toddy folks\" he says as he cheekily raises his brows and stares directly into the camera.\n\nAnd it wasn't the only thing hotting up after he revealed the effects of his favourite alcoholic beverage.\n\n\"What happens after I've drunk it, is that it makes me very horny. I'm sorry! I can only apologise!\"\n\nUpon hearing the revelation, the shelves stocking sake must've been emptied almost immediately.\n\nNot that dousing Barry in sake would help either way as he's been happily married to the gorgeous Linda Gray for over a half a century.\n\nThe question then turns to Robin, who responds with \"I don't drink! I have been drunk, a very very long time ago. But as Maurice said, I don't remember as I was drunk at the time!\"\n\nThe Gibb brothers would also perform a gorgeous medley of four tracks 'Blue Island', 'To Love Somebody', 'New York Mining Disaster 1941' and 'I've Got To Get A Message To You'.\n\nBut it's the playful interview that reinforced the fact that the Bee Gees were always more than happy to let loose and leave us in stitches."
