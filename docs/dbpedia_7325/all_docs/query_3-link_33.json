        "text": "The Stayin Alive singer was good friends with the king of pop and says fame destroyed him\n\nHe has been making music for over 50 years and has worked with some of the biggest names in the business, so it's no surprise that Barry Gibb has some tales from the world of music.\n\nThe Bee Gees star has recorded a new album with the help of his sons, and he caught up with Good Morning Britain to discuss the latest record, but first he gave his opinion on the greatest ever artist.\n\nBarry counted Michael Jackson among his closest friends and the two would often hangout together in the studio making music and giving each other advice.\n\nHowever, Barry claims that despite all of Michael's success as one of the biggest selling musicians of all time, he was incredibly insecure and had some severe self esteem issues.\n\nBarry said: \"I've never known an incredibly famous artist that had good self esteem. Michael was the same, very much afraid, afraid of everything.\"\n\nHe added: \"He'd say to me, 'Barry, do you think Prince is better than me?' I'd tell him he had no equal.\"\n\nBarry thinks that fame made the Thriller singer insecure, and that's something he has seen in many other stars in both film and music.\n\n\"Mega-fame is destructive\", he said. \"My wife is the reason I didn't wind up going down that path.\"\n\nSource: Mirror.co.uk\n\nIf you ask me, Michael comes out on top on every angle.\n\n- AlwaysThere\n\nReally?\n\nPrince could play just about any instrument. Michael couldn't.\n\nPrince would pick from 300 songs per tour and change up the setlist live on stage, sometimes. Michael did the same mostly thing from 1984 to 2009.\n\nPrince recorded over 2000 songs. Michael maybe did 300 since the age of 5, the bulk of which being Motown.\n\nPrince released and average of one album per year for 40 years (excluding other albums under different artists, which he did everything on), Michael released 5 albums in 23 years.\n\nPrince toured almost every year from 1980 to 2016. In that time, Michael did toured 1984, 1987-1989, 1992-1993 and 1996-1997.\n\n- DingBat\n\nWell well, some just don't understand that quality almost always triumphs quantity. Does this person not understand that most of Prince's huge catalogue doesn't even stand a chance against maybe even just the big three of Billie Jean, Beat It and Thriller? (I haven't even mentioned 10 more).\n\n- AlwaysThere\n\n- DingBat\n\nWell well, some just don't understand that quality almost always triumphs quantity.

Maybe you should stop wasting time lurking places that you've been banned several times and contribute something relevant.\n\nAnyway, I agree Michael was insecure about a lot of things and he was probably always trying to beat Thriller at the back of his mind. It certainly couldn't be easy having such a successful album and everyone always comparing your future efforts to it. Fame certainly does go to people's heads in many ways and Michael was no exception."
