        "text": "Summary of Case:\n\n\"Barry Gibbs was wrongly convicted in 1988 of the 1986 murder of a prostitute whose body was dumbed on New York City's Belt Parkway. Gibbs was convicted solely on the testimony of one eyewitness, who in 2005 recanted, explaining that the police investigator involved in he case forced him to lie. The witness picked Gibbs out of a lineup at the urging of the police investigator, former NYPD Detective Louis J Eppolito, who was indicted in March 2005 along with his former partner for being a killer on the payroll of the Luchese crime family. When Eppolito's Las Vegas home was searched the FBI found Gibbs file. Based on the new evidence Gibbs conviction was overturned on Septmeber 29, 2005, and he was released. Gibbs filed a compensation lawsuit with the New York Court of Claims, which awarded him $1.9 million. Gibbs filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against New York City. On June 3, 2010 Gibbs reach a settlement with the city for $9.9 million. The settlement was six days after the city's Motion for Summary Judgment was denied, and the city was ruled liable for the actions of its police officers.\""
