        "text": "I’m officially back from hiatus and would like to welcome you to the latest installment of my recurring feature taking a closer look at songs I’ve only mentioned in passing or haven’t covered at all to date. Before getting to the post, I’d like to thank all my fellow bloggers for their thoughtful comments about my mom who passed away in Germany on July 26 at the age of 86 – the reason I decided to pause the blog for the past few weeks.\n\nMy pick today is a beautiful cover by one of the most compelling vocalists I’ve encountered to date: Fields of Gold by Eva Cassidy. Once again, I have to give a shoutout to my sister who first recommended Cassidy to me a couple of years ago and brought her back on my radar screen recently when she drew my attention to the singer’s breathtaking version of Over the Rainbow. With her emotive soprano voice, Cassidy sounds like you imagine an angel would sing!\n\nFields of Gold was written by Sting who also first recorded the ballad for his fourth studio album Ten Summoner’s Tales, released in June 1993. In Cassidy’s case, her cover initially appeared on her second album Live at Blues Alley, which she self-released in May 1996.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully attempting to get a label deal, Cassidy decided to use the money from a small pension she had accumulated from her daytime job in a plant nursery to finance what sadly would be her final album that appeared during her short lifetime. Only six months later, on November 2, 1996, Cassidy passed away at the age of 33 from melanoma that had spread to her bones and lungs – truly heartbreaking!\n\nOn the recording, captured in early January 1996 at Washington, D.C. jazz and blues club Blues Alley, Cassidy (vocals, guitar) was backed by her live band featuring Lenny Williams (piano), Keith Grimes (guitar), Chris Biondo (bass) and Raice McLeod (drums). At first, Cassidy who had a cold during the performance didn’t think it was good enough for release but changed her mind after a previously completed studio take of Oh, Had I a Golden Thread was added to the track list. Here’s Sting’s aforementioned original, the version I had known long before I first heard Cassidy’s rendition and come to love.\n\nTwo years after Cassidy’s untimely death, her versions of Fields of Gold and Over the Rainbow had come to the attention of two British broadcasters who played them on BBC Radio 2. Following a strong response by British audiences, a camcorder clip of Over the Rainbow a friend of Cassidy had filmed at Blues Alley was shown on BBC Two’s Top of the Pops 2, igniting Cassidy’s posthumous fame. Shortly thereafter, the May 1998 compilation album Songbird, which included both songs, surged to the top of the UK Albums Chart. In turn, this led to increased worldwide attention, various additional posthumous releases and more than 10 million albums sold worldwide.\n\n“A friend of Eva’s sent me the recording after her death, I thought it was a beautiful rendition,” Sting told The Washington Post, as recounted on Cassidy’s website. “I’ve rarely heard a voice of such purity. I was deeply sorry to learn of her death and somehow it gave the song another emotional level. I was very happy the work saw the light of day. It’s an extraordinary success.”\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, in addition to Cassidy, Fields of Gold has been covered by numerous other artists. SecondHandSongs.com lists more than 300 versions. Some include Taiwanese singer Tracy Huang (1994), British country and folk singer-songwriter Charlie Landsborough (2001), Cliff Richard with Barry Gibb (2006), British-Georgian singer Katie Melua (2017) and British singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding (2022). Here’s the rendition by Melua, a fan of Cassidy, who released it as the BBC Children in Need single in 2017. Beautiful!\n\nFollowing are some additional insights from Songfacts:\n\nThis song is about feeling joyous, but knowing that the joy is going to end someday. Sting wrote it after he bought a house near a barley field. The sunsets and the colors of the field were an inspiration for the lyrics, along with his love at the time, Trudie Styler, whom he married in 1992. Styler has said that the song is one of her favorites.\n\nThe major theme in this song is commitment. It is about a man who has broken promises before, but is determined make this relationship last.\n\nThe story is chronological. It is about courtship, marriage, and eventual death. The two people in the song meet, court, fall in love (at this point, he reveals that he has never really made such a strong promise/commitment to someone) but feels he is ready to now. “See the children run,” their offspring and the “jealous sky” refer to the Heavens. Even Heaven is jealous of their love/relationship. The esteemed sun is jealous. Eventually, he dies and tells his love that they will always remember their love specifically, when she thinks of him, he wants to be personified as such… walking in fields of gold (barley).\n\nSting started writing “Fields Of Gold” on the guitar, then brought it to his band, which for the Ten Summoner’s Tales album was Dominic Miller (guitar), Vinnie Colaiuta (drums) and David Sancious (keyboards). In a Songfacts interview with Sancious (who in the ’70s lived on E Street in Belmar, New Jersey, providing the name of the band he played in with Bruce Springsteen), he said: “‘Fields Of Gold’ is really a live, in-the-studio recording – there’s actually no overdubs on it. It’s a really simple song.”\n\n“Sting had a pretty simple demo. He played it on guitar for us and said he wanted a really soft synthesizer pad. It’s not meant to sound exactly like a string section or anything, it’s just really a background.”\n\n…In Lyrics By Sting, the singer described the view from his 16th-century manor house: “In England, our house is surrounded by barley fields, and in the summer it’s fascinating to watch the wind moving over the shimmering surface, like waves on an ocean of gold. There’s something inherently sexy about the sight, something primal, as if the wind were making love to the barley. Lovers have made promises here, I’m sure, their bonds strengthened by the comforting cycle of the seasons.”…\n\n…Of the lyric, “So she took her love for to gaze awhile upon the fields of barley,” Sting told interviewer Daniel Rachel (The Art of Noise: Conversations with Great Songwriters): “I’m using poetic license to alter syntax. I wanted to create a timeless idea that the song could have been written in the sixteenth century.”…\n\n…In a 2018 discussion at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, Paul McCartney named this as the song he wished he’d written. “I like Sting’s ‘Fields Of Gold,'” he said. “I thought, ‘I should have written it. How dare he.'”\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Eva Cassidy website; SecondHandSongs.com; Songfacts; YouTube\n\nAs we start a new week, it’s time for another post of my irregular music history feature, the blog’s longest running series I started back in July 2016. It was my seventh post, and today is the 76th installment – yes, I had to count them all. Since the feature revolves around specific dates, this still leaves me with plenty of additional posts. With that said, let’s take a look at select happenings in the world of music on May 13.\n\n1955: A performance by Elvis Presley in Jacksonville, Fla. led to what became known as the “first Presley riot.” During the show, Elvis told the screaming girls in the audience he’d “see them backstage after the show.” Apparently, some fans took the tease a bit too literal and rushed toward the stage when the spectacle was over. Some also corned Elvis in his dressing room and tore off his clothes, hoping to grab a souvenir. Remarkably, this all happened before he had ever appeared on national TV. Also in attendance was a man who called himself Colonel Tom Parker and would become Presley’s manager after he had witnessed his potential. Here’s an interview of Presley conducted on May 13, 1995 by Mae Boren Axton, which briefly references the “riot.” It was the first time Axton met Presley, and she ended up giving him her song Heartbreak Hotel. It worked out nicely for both of them, becoming Presley’s first no.1 in the U.S. on the national pop charts\n\n1966: The Rolling Stones released their single Paint It Black in the UK. It had first appeared in the U.S. on May 7. Credited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the initial version was a much slower, conventional soul song. When during the recording session Bill Wyman started following around on an organ with a spoof of music played at Jewish weddings, Charlie Watts joined in, improvising the double-time drum pattern, echoing the rhythm heard in some Middle Eastern dances. Another notable feature of Paint It Black is the sitar played by Brian Jones, an instrument The Beatles had introduced to pop the year before on their song Norwegian Wood.\n\n1970: Let It Be, Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s documentary about The Beatles and the making of their studio album of the same name, made its theatrical debut in New York City. The UK premiere followed a week later in London and Liverpool simultaneously. At the time, the film wasn’t particularly well received. In addition to poor technical and conceptual qualities, most of the criticism focused particularly on it as a document highlighting the fractured relationships within the band. Peter Jackson’s documentary TV series The Beatles: Get Back, which premiered in November 2021, helped update the record. It drew largely from unused footage and audio material originally captured for and recycled original footage from Hogg’s documentary. An updated version of that documentary, which was fully restored by Jackson, started streaming on Disney+ on May 8. “Let It Be is the climax of Get Back, while Get Back provides a vital missing context for Let It Be,” Jackson told Rolling Stone.\n\n1978: Hawaiian vocalist, songwriter and actress Yvonne Elliman, who had gained initial prominence as part of the cast of Broadway musical production Jesus Chris Superstar, hit no. 1 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 with If I Can’t Have You. Co-written by Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees, the catchy dance song was part of Saturday Night Fever, the soundtrack from the 1977 film of the same name, starring 23-year-old John Travolta. At that time, the Bee Gees dominated the U.S. pop charts. If I Can’t Have You knocked off Night Fever, another Bee Gees song from soundtrack, from the top spot, which had been at no. 1 for eight weeks.\n\n1985: The Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) held their first meeting at a church in Washington, D.C. Co-founded by Tipper Gore, wife of Senator and later Vice President Al Gore; Susan Baker, wife of Treasury Secretary James Baker; Pam Howar, wife of Washington realtor Raymond Howar; and Sally Nevius, wife of former Washington City Council Chairman John Nevius, the PMRC’s goal was to increase parental control over the access of children to music deemed to have violent, drug-related or sexual themes. Their influence led to a Senate hearing on September 19, during which John Denver, Frank Zappa and Dee Snider of Twisted Sister testified, opposing any kind of labeling, arguing any such regulation could lead to censorship. Two months later, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which represents most record companies, agreed to voluntarily place warning stickers on albums deemed offensive to avoid legislation.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts Music History Calendar; Florida History Network; Rolling Stone; YouTube\n\nHappy hump day and welcome to another installment of my midweek feature that takes a closer look at a song I’ve only mentioned in passing or not covered at all to date. My pick today is what many folks call the best pop song ever recorded: God Only Knows by The Beach Boys. While as a long-time fan of The Beatles my knee-jerk reaction is to question that label, thinking the four lads from Liverpool must at least have one song that’s better than God Only Knows, I have to admit The Beach Boys delivered a true gem that’s certainly more than worthy to explore in greater depth!\n\nCo-written by Brian Wilson and Tony Asher, God Only Knows initially appeared on Pet Sounds, the 11th studio album by The Beach Boys, released in May 1966. While it is a remarkable record, I can’t resists to opine it’s not “the greatest rock album ever made”, and also have to say I never quite understood all the fuzz about it. Perhaps one of the best things Pet Sounds did is to influence an album that in my humble opinion is way superior: Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band! 🙂\n\nSince this isn’t a post about The Beatles, though they were a much better group than The Beach Boys (I know, I know…), we can work it out and get back to God Only Knows. The pop gem also appeared separately as the album’s third single in July 1966, interestingly as the B-side to Wouldn’t It Be Nice. Notably, the single barely made the top 40 in the U.S., peaking at no. 39 on the Billboard Hot 100. In other countries, God Only Knows was the A-side, which I guess did the trick: No. 2 in the UK, no. 6 in Norway and no. 17 in Australia!\n\nGod Only Knows took an impressive production effort. Over the course of March and April 1966, Wilson gathered about 20 session musicians. Most were associated with The Wrecking Crew, a loose collective of L.A.-based top session cats who played on hundreds of top 40 hits in the ’60s and ’70s. To call out a few, Hal Blaine played drums and the sleigh bells, which give the song a bit of a Christmassy touch. Another quite noticeable instrument is the French horn, which was provided by Alan Robinson. A third key musical feature are the strings by The Sid Sharp Strings, creating a lush Phil Spector-type sound.\n\nWhile the musical arrangement is notable, to me, the true outstanding aspect of God Only Knows are the mighty vocals. Personally, that’s how I feel about The Beach Boys overall, especially when looking at their surf music, which from a strictly musical perspective was pretty derivative. That said, I still love it – because of their incredible vocals! Going back to God Only Knows, the amazing lead vocals were sung by Carl Wilson, which some consider his finest performance. Brian Wilson and Bruce Johnston provided the song’s beautiful harmony vocals. Here’s a mind-boggling October 2014 star-studded cover produced in connection with the launch of BBC Music.\n\nGod Only Knows is among the majority of songs on Pet Sounds Brian Wilson wrote with Tony Asher. BTW, in case you’re wondering, Tony Asher neither is related to actress Jane Asher, Paul McCartney’s former girlfriend, nor English musician, manager and record producer Peter Asher, Jane’s older brother. Tony Asher has expressed his thought that God Only Knows was his most effortless collaboration with Brian Wilson who acknowledged he had not written a song like it before and that Asher was a musical influence.\n\nGod Only Knows, rightfully, has received much recognition. To start with, none other than Paul McCartney has called it “the greatest song ever written.” I guess Macca forgot about a few Beatles songs! 🙂 Here are some other quotes noted by Songfacts: Pete Townshend: “‘God Only Knows’ is simple and elegant and as stunning as when it first appeared. It still sounds perfect.” Barry Gibb: “It blew the top of my head off. My first thought was, ‘Oh, dear, I’m wasting my time. How can I ever compete with that?'” Dave Bayley of Glass Animals: “That [song – CMM] just keeps taking on new meanings as you go through life. I often ask people if the world was going to end what three songs would you listen to. I change my three songs all the time, but ‘God Only Knows’ is on there most often.”\n\nIn 2004, God Only Knows was included in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame’s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock & Roll. In 2021, Rolling Stone ranked it at no. 11 in their list of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. I know the Rock Hall and the publication’s lists continue to trigger passionate debate, but as along as I agree with them, I will shamelessly continue to reference them! 🙂\n\nThe song has also been covered by god only knows how many other artists. Some include Neil Diamond, Olivia Newton-John, Glen Campbell, David Bowie and even Time magazine’s 2023 Person of the Year, Taylor Swift. Wouldn’t it be nice to hear one of these covers? You bet! Here’s English singer-songwriter and actress Joss Stone who included a beautiful rendition on her September 2044 album Mind Body & Soul.\n\nFollowing are select additional tidbits from Songfacts:\n\nBrian Wilson wrote “God Only Knows” with Tony Asher, an advertising copyrighter and lyricist Wilson worked with on songs for the Pet Sounds album. Asher came up with the title, but the song reflects Wilson’s interest in spirituality. It was a big departure from previous Beach Boys songs that dealt with girls, cars and surfing.\n\n“It came from God through me,” Wilson told Steve Baltin in the book Anthems We Love. “I was 24 when I wrote ‘God Only Knows’ and the rest of Pet Sounds. All I know is I wrote what was in my heart. And the lyrics and the music just connect with people.”\n\n“God Only Knows” is a pop music landmark and Beach Boys classic, but it went unheralded in the United States when it was released as a single in July 1966. It was first released as the B-side of “Wouldn’t It Be Nice,” and then as an A-side, but with little promotion. Fear was that radio stations would refuse to play a song with “God” in the title.\n\nIn the liner notes to the reissued Pet Sounds album, Tony Asher explained, “I really thought it was going to be everything it was, and yet we were taking some real chances with it. First of all, the lyric opens by saying, ‘I may not always love you,’ which is a very unusual way to start a love song.”\n\nIn America, the song peaked at a lowly #39 in September 1966 and would only be truly appreciated much later. It did far better in the UK, where it went to #2 in August behind The Beatles’ “Yellow Submarine.” That November, The Beach Boys played the song at some London concerts, which is where they first saw its impact.\n\nCarl Wilson (Brian’s brother) handled lead vocals on this track. Not long after the song was released, he said, “At present our influences are of a religious nature. Not any specific religion but an idea based upon that of Universal Consciousness. The concept of spreading goodwill, good thoughts and happiness is nothing new. It is an idea which religious teachers and philosophers have been handing down for centuries, but it is also our hope. The spiritual concept of happiness and doing good to others is extremely important to the lyric of our songs, and the religious element of some of the better church music is also contained within some of our new work.”\n\nBrian Wilson produced the song, but the only Beach Boy to play an instrument on the track is Carl Wilson, who added guitar. The group used session musicians at this time, and lots of them. Fortunately, the Los Angeles area where they recorded was home to some of the best.\n\nThese musicians aren’t credited on the album [deplorable! CMM], but a Beach Boys researcher named Craig Slowinski did the work of figuring out who they were, with some interesting discoveries, especially with the percussion. Hal Blaine played drums but also sleigh bells; another drummer, Jim Gordon, played “plastic orange cups.” There’s also harpsichord by Larry Knechtel, accordion by Carl Fortina and Frank Marocco, and flutes by Jim Horn and Bill Green.\n\nBrian Wilson has cited both “The Sound Of Music” and the works of the composer Tchaikovsky as influences on the melody.\n\nBrian Wilson planned to sing the lead vocal himself, but decided that his brother Carl was better suited for the track. “I was looking for a tenderness and a sweetness which I knew Carl had in himself as well as in his voice,” said Brian.\n\nAsked by The Guardian which Beach Boys song took the least effort to write, Brian Wilson replied: “I wrote ‘God Only Knows’ in 45 minutes. Me and Tony Asher.”\n\nIn Al Kooper’s tell-all autobiography Backstage Passes and Backstabbing Bastards, Kooper talks about his evening visiting Brian Wilson only a week before Pet Sounds hit the streets: “Brian played a test-pressing of the record, jumping up and stopping cuts in the middle and starting them over to emphasize his points. He was very proud of his accomplishment, maybe even a little show-offish, but I wasn’t about to argue. Do you remember the first time you heard ‘God Only Knows’?”\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; YouTube\n\nAnother Sunday is upon us and I hope everybody is feeling groovy. It’s time again to embark on another trip to visit music from different decades and in different flavors, six tunes at a time. Let’s do it!\n\nLou Donaldson/That Good Old Feeling\n\nOur first stop today is June 1957, which saw the release of Wailing With Lou, a studio album by Lou Donaldson. The American jazz alto saxophonist who is now 96 years officially retired in 2017 after a 64-year career as an active performer. Here’s an excerpt from the bio on his website: Jazz critics agree that “Sweet Poppa Lou” Donaldson is one of the greatest alto saxophonists of all time. He began his career as a bandleader with Blue Note Records in 1952 and, already at age 25, had found his sound, though it would continue to sweeten over the years — earning him his famed nickname –“Sweet Poppa Lou.” He made a series of classic records for Blue Note Records in the 50’s and takes pride in having showcased many musicians who made their first records as sidemen for him: Clifford Brown, Grant Green, Blue Mitchell, Donald Byrd, Ray Barretto, Horace Parlan, John Patton, Charles Earland, Al Harewood, Herman Foster, Peck Morrison, Dave Bailey, Leon Spencer, Idris Muhammad, and others. Coming back to the above-mentioned album, here’s the beautiful Donaldson composition That Good Old Feeling. The recording featured various of the above-listed jazz musicians, including Bryd (trumpet), Foster (piano) and Morrison (bass), along with Art Taylor (drums).\n\nThe Blasters/Crazy Baby\n\nAfter having been eased in with smooth jazz, let’s visit 1980 and pick up the speed with great music by The Blasters. I first read about this American roots rock band on Cincinnati Babyhead’s blog. Formed in Downey, Calif. in 1979 by Phil Alvin (vocals, guitar) and his brother Dave Alvin (guitar), together with John Bazz (bass) and Bill Bateman (drums), the group had an initial 6-year run before they first broke up. Various incarnations of The Blasters have since been led by Phil Alvin who together with Bazz has been the only constant member. The current line-up also includes cofounder Bateman who rejoined in 2008. Crazy Baby, co-written by Ron Volz and Ron Wemsman, appeared on the band’s 1980 debut album American Music. It’s got a cool retro rockabilly vibe!\n\nBee Gees/To Love Somebody\n\nTime to go back to the ’60s and a beautiful early song by the Bee Gees. Co-written by Barry Gibb and his brother Robin Gibb, To Love Somebody first appeared in June 1967 as the second upfront single of the group’s international debut studio album Bee Gee’s 1st, which came out in July of the same year. Prior to that, they had released two albums in their native Australia only. To Love Somebody reached no. 17 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 and no. 49 on the UK Official Singles Charts. Ten years later, the Bee Gees would rule the charts in both the U.S. and the UK, as well as many other countries with their no. 1 soundtrack album Saturday Night Fever, which spawned multiple no. 1. singles. Oftentimes, the Bee Gees are associated with the disco era, but early songs like To Love Somebody show there was much more to the group. You can read more about the Bee Gees in my four-part series from December 2020 here, here, here and here.\n\nCordovas/High Feeling\n\nNow, let’s set our music time machine to the current century, more specifically to October 2020. That’s when Americana and country rock band Cordovas released their third full-length studio album Destiny Hotel. The four-piece group from East Nashville, Tenn. first entered my radar screen in the summer of 2018 when I caught them during a free concert in a park not far from my house. Their multi-part harmony singing proved to be an immediate attraction. So was their sound that reminds me of bands like Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, The Band, Grateful Dead, Eagles and Little Feat. Led by bassist Joe Firstman, Cordovas have been around for more than 10 years. Here’s the album’s opener High Feeling. These harmony vocals and the warm sound are right up my alley!\n\nPink Floyd/Us And Them\n\nThis past Wednesday marked the 50th anniversary of The Dark Side of the Moon, one of my favorite Pink Floyd albums, an appropriate occasion to go back to March 1, 1973. Developed during live performances before work in the studio began, the eighth studio release by the British psychedelic and progressive rock band was a concept album revolving around dark human themes, such as conflict, greed, time, death and mental illness. One of the most critically acclaimed albums of all time, The Dark Side of the Moon is a sonic gem that not only represents one of the peaks in Floyd’s recording career but also a highlight in sound engineering provided by Alan Parsons. It catapulted Pink Floyd to international stardom and perhaps somewhat ironically made its members pretty wealthy. For more on this album, you can read an excellent recent post by fellow blogger Bruce from Vinyl Connections. Us And Them, composed by Richard Wright with lyrics by Roger Waters, became the album’s second single in February 1974 after Money from May 1973. A reissue, The Dark Side of the Moon 50th Anniversary, is set to appear on March 24. Among others, the box set includes remastered edits of the studio album and The Dark Side of the Moon Live at Wembley 1974.\n\nSon Volt/Route\n\nAnd once again it’s time to wrap up another musical journey. For the last stop, our time machine takes us to September 1995. Alternative country and Americana rock band Son Volt first entered my radar screen in July 2021 when their most recent studio album Electro Melodier appeared. Singer-songwriter and guitarist Jay Farrar formed the group in 1994 after the breakup of Uncle Tupelo, another alt. country outfit he had co-founded in 1987. To date, Son Volt have released 10 albums. Apart from Farrar, the current members include Chris Frame (guitar), Mark Spencer (keyboards, steel guitar), Andrew DuPlantis (bass) and Mark Patterson (drums). Route, penned by Farrar, is a nice crunchy rocker off their 1995 debut album Trace. It’s got a Neil Young and Crazy Horse vibe, which in my book usually is a great thing!\n\nThis post wouldn’t be complete without a Spotify playlist that includes all featured tunes. I gladly oblige and hope there’s something you dig!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Lou Donaldson website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nAfter the unprecedented events we witnessed in this country earlier this week, it feels somewhat surreal to blog about something completely unrelated. At the same time, the fact new music keeps coming out is reassuring to me. In fact, music has always had a degree of healing power during challenging times and provided a welcome distraction. While ignoring reality can be dangerous, I believe occasionally escaping from it is a good thing to clear your mind and gather strength.\n\nI’m very excited about this week’s Best of What’s New installment, which features indie and country singer-songwriters, a young incredibly talented vintage soul vocalist who knocked my socks off and…well, you’ll need to continue reading to find out yourself. All of this great music was just released yesterday (January 8).\n\nDenison Witmer/River of Music\n\nDension Witmer is a singer-songwriter from Lancaster, Pa. According to his artist profile on Apple Music, Tagged by many music journalists as one of the most likely songwriters to fill the void left by Elliott Smith in the acoustic indie singer/songwriter movement, [he] catalogs the experiences of young adulthood in almost painfully honest detail. With a soft and sensitive voice that perfectly matches his laid-back 1970s California pop production and subtly expressive guitar work, he has gone from writing in his journal to becoming an intimate of like-minded artists like Damien Jurado and Pedro the Lion over the span of a few albums. Growing up in Lancaster, PA, Witmer picked up the guitar at the age of 16 and was soon showing enough promise to draw the interest of the Innocence Mission’s Don Peris. As Peris became Witmer’s musical mentor, he would oversee and play guitar and keyboard on his apprentice’s first recordings, 2000’s River Bends EP and the much-heralded Safe Away. Here’s the great River of Music, a track from Witmer’s new EP American Foursquare (Simplified). It surely feels good listening to his soothing voice and beautiful guitar-playing. And the lyrics about the power of music perfectly illustrate what I wrote in the intro of this post.\n\nMorgan Wallen/Livin’ the Dream\n\nCountry music singer-songwriter Morgan Wallen, who hails from the tiny Tennessee town of Sneedville (about 250 miles east of Nashville), first gained some prominence as a contestant on season 6 of The Voice in 2014. While Wallen didn’t make it to the final, his stint eventually led to a deal with Panacea Records and his debut EP Stand Alone from August 2015. Wallen switched to Big Loud Records thereafter and released his first full-length studio album If I Know Me in April 2018. Livin’ the Dream is a track from his sophomore release Dangerous: The Double Album. This double album features a hefty 30 tunes, many prominent country songwriters and a guest appearance by Chris Stapleton. Livin’ the Dream, a tale about life as a “rock star,” was co-written by Wallen, Ben Burgess, Jacob Durrett and Michael Wilson Hardy, aka Hardy.\n\nBarry Gibb/To Love Somebody\n\nYep, that’s Barry Gibb, formerly of the Bee Gees. I recently covered them in a four-part series here (part 1), here (part 2), here (part 3) and here (part 4). All I’d like to say in this post is if you think the Bee Gees were just a disco band, I’d encourage to take a closer look at their music or read my series. Was it necessary for Gibb, the group’s only surviving member, to come out with Greenfields: The Gibb Brothers’ Songbook, Vol 1., an album of newly recorded versions of mostly famous Bee Gees songs? Probably not – on the other hand, why not! The Bee Gees’ catalog is full with well crafted songs. Co-written by Barry Gibb and Robin Gibb, To Love Somebody is among my favorite early Bee Gees tunes. It initially appeared on Bee Gees’ 1st, the group’s first internationally released full-length studio album that was released in July 1967 in the UK and appeared the following month in the U.S. The newly recorded version features Jay Buchanan, lead vocalist of American rock band Rival Sons. The album also includes many other guests, mostly from country music, a favorite genre of Barry’s, such as Little Big Town, Dolly Parton and Sheryl Crow. Be cynical about it, if you like. I dig and stand behind these songs and the Bee Gees!\n\nAaron Frazer/ If I Got It (Your Love Brought It)\n\nAccording to his website, Aaron Frazer is a Brooklyn-based, Baltimore-raised songwriter [who] first came into the international spotlight as multi-instrumentalist and co-lead singer for Durand Jones & The Indications. He penned some of the group’s most notable tracks, including ‘Morning In America,’ and sang lead on ‘Is It Any Wonder?’ – the latter an instant sweet soul classic anchored by Aaron’s falsetto, which caught the ear of producer and Black Keys guitarist Dan Auerbach…Soft-spoken with the look of a slightly disaffected 1950s matinee idol, Aaron Frazer possesses a unique voice that’s both contemporary and timeless. His higher register conveys a wide emotional palate and a progressive worldview in the tradition of musical masterminds like Curtis Mayfield. While Aaron’s stirring falsetto and thoughtful songwriting have made him established in the world of revival soul music, he refuses to be pigeonholed. That falsetto is in beautiful action on If I Got It (Your Love Brought It), a tune from Aaron’s debut album Introducing…, which was produced by Auerbach. The song was co-written by Frazer, Auerbach and David Ferguson. So good! check it out!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Apple Music; Aaron Frazer website; YouTube\n\n“They [Atlantic Records] were about to drop us. We had to adopt a new sound. We had to adopt a new attitude.” (Barry Gibb, The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart)\n\nAt the beginning of 1975, the Bee Gees relocated to Miami. Interestingly, the man who encouraged the move thinking it would help them creatively was none other than Eric Clapton. Not only did Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb and Robin Gibb follow his advice, the entire band lived in the very same house where Clapton had stayed while recording his second solo album 461 Ocean Boulevard.\n\nThe Bee Gees worked with Atlantic producer Arif Marden, who had also produced their previous album Mr. Natural, and engineer Karl Richardson at Criteria Studios in Miami. Initially, the Gibb brothers started writing songs in their old, more ballad-oriented way. When their manager Robert Stigwood heard the tunes, he urged them to adopt more of an R&B style. With Marden, who had worked with Aretha Franklin and other R&B artists, they had the right producer.\n\nThe result was Main Course, the Bee Gees’ 13th studio album released in June 1975. In addition to listening to contemporary R&B artists like Stevie Wonder, Marden had encouraged the use of synthesizers and dual bass lines to create a more technological sound. When they were working on Nights on Broadway, Marden also suggested to the band to add some background parts to the song like a screaming. This is when Barry came up with repeating lines of the tune sung in falsetto. The singing of the Bee Gees would be changed forever.\n\nNights on Broadway and Jive Talkin‘ catapulted the Bee Gees back to the top of the charts, especially in the U.S. where the tunes hit no. 1 and no. 7, respectively, and Canada (no. 1 and no. 2, respectively).\n\n“The way they changed and the groove they got into there was so profound. If that was something that was initiated by me, I can’t think of any… that’s one of the great things I’ve done in my life. I’ll take full credit!” (Eric Clapton, The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart)\n\nThe group’s next album Children of the World was characterized by Barry’s falsetto and synthesizer sounds. And it brought more chart success. You Should be Dancing became another no. 1 single in the U.S. and Canada. Children of the World also did very well on both countries’ albums charts, peaking at no. 8 and no. 3, respectively. By contrast, the reception was cool in the UK where the album failed to chart.\n\nThe Bee Gees were on the up. They went to even bigger heights with their next project: their involvement in the creation of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. The Gibb brothers wrote five new songs for it that all became hits: Stayin’ Alive, How Deep Is Your Love, Night Fever, More Than a Woman and If I Can’t Have You. The soundtrack also included their previously released tunes Jive Talkin’ and You Should Be Dancing.\n\nWith 40 million copies sold worldwide, Saturday Night Fever is one of the best-selling albums in history and the second-best selling soundtrack of all time. The album is also credited with prolonging the mainstream appeal of disco. Notably, the Bee Gees never saw themselves as a disco band, even though critics, media and other artists called them “Kings of Disco.” While there’s no doubt Bee Gees tunes from that period included elements of disco and were very danceable, they also were strongly influenced by R&B. Here’s the excellent Night Fever – love that smooth funky sound.\n\nAfter Saturday Night Fever, the Bee Gees were on top of the world. So perhaps it’s not a surprise their next studio album Spirits Having Flown became another major success producing more no. 1 singles. Here’s one of them ironically titled what was ahead when disco not only lost its luster but led to outright hostility: Tragedy.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart – documentary directed by Frank Marshall; YouTube\n\n“You can’t deny talent. And the talent was so obvious.” (Robert Stigwood, The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart)\n\nPrior to leaving Australia for England, Hugh Gibb, the father of Barry, Maurice and Robin and their manager at the time, had sent some demos to Beatles manager Brian Epstein. Epstein passed on the tapes to Australian born expatriate Robert Stigwood who had recently joined NEMS, a music store directed by Epstein. Stigwood liked what he heard, and after an audition in February 1967, the Bee Gees got a 5-year deal with Polydor Records to oversee their releases in the UK, while Atco Records would handle U.S. distribution.\n\nBefore going to the studio, Vince Melouney (lead guitar) and Colin Petersen (drums) joined the group. In July 1967, the Bee Gees released their first international album titled Bee Gees’ 1st. Stigwood launched an aggressive promotional campaign boldly declaring the Bee Gees were the “most significant new musical talent of 1967.” Lead single New York Mining Disaster 1941 became another hit, reaching no. 12 in the UK and peaking at no. 14 in the U.S. Co-written by Barry Gibb and Robin Gibb, the stunning tune became a top 10 in New Zealand, the Netherlands and Germany, where it reached no. 3, no. 4 and no. 10, respectively.\n\nBee Gees’ 1st also featured another classic: To Love Somebody, which was co-written by Barry and Robin as well. It also became the album’s second single in June 1967. While it almost matched the chart performance of the predecessor in the U.S. where it peaked at no. 17, it was less successful in the UK, reaching no. 41 there.\n\nOnly three months after To Love Somebody, the Bee Gees released another gem that became their first no. 1 single in the UK: (The Lights Went Out In) Massachusetts. The beautiful tune, co-written by the three Gibb brothers, also topped the charts in New Zealand, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Austria, and peaked at no. 2 in Switzerland, Ireland and Australia. The Bee Gees had fully arrived on the international scene.\n\n1968 saw the first trips to the U.S., including an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show in March, as well as tours to Scandinavia, Germany and Switzerland. The Bee Gees also scored their second no. 1 in the UK with I’ve Gotta Get a Message to You, released in September that year. Co-written by all three brothers, the tune climbed to no. 8 in the U.S. and also was a hit in many other countries.\n\nWhile the Bee Gees had achieved significant international success, not all was well and things would soon unravel. By 1969, Robin began to sense that Robert Stigwood was favoring Barry as the group’s frontman. Following the release of the next studio album Odessa in March 1969, Robin left to launch a solo career. Barry, Maurice and Colin Petersen went on to record the Bee Gees’ next album Cucumber Castle. Vince Melouney had left the group in 1968.\n\nIn December 1969, Barry and Maurice parted ways as well. They each worked on solo albums that didn’t appear. Meanwhile, Robin released his solo debut Robin’s Reign in February 1970 and had a no. 2 single in the UK, Saved by the Bell. But the brothers realized they needed other and reunited later that year. In November 1970, the Bee Gees’ next studio album 2 Years On came out. Here’s the record’s single Lonely Days co-written by all three brothers.\n\nThe Bee Gees’ next studio album Trafalgar, which came out in the U.S. in September and in the UK in November 1971, brought mixed success. While lead single How Can You Mend a Broken Heart became the group’s first no. 1 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100, the album only reached no. 34 on the Billboard 200 and did not chart in the UK at all. By 1973, chart success had largely become elusive. After touring the U.S. and Canada in 1974, the Bee Gees found themselves playing small clubs in England. Something needed to happen to reignite the group. A change in musical direction and singing style would open their next chapter.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube\n\n“When I think about it now, I think about how it all sort of all started. We just had this dream. And we thought, well, what do we wanna be famous for? It turns out it was the songwriting.” (Barry Gibb, Miami 2019). I would humbly add some of the most amazing three-part harmonies I’ve ever heard! I was reminded of this the other night when watching the documentary The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart on HBO Max. The film about the highs and lows of brothers Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb and Robin Gibb spontaneously inspired this four-part feature.\n\nThe story of the Bee Gees starts in 1955 in Manchester, England, when 9-year-old Barry Gibb (guitar, vocals) and his younger brothers 6-year-old Maurice Gibb (vocals) and 6-year-old Robin Gibb (vocals), who are fraternal twins, formed skiffle and rock & roll group The Rattlesnakes, together with their friends and neighbors Paul Frost (drums) and Kenny Horrocks (tea-chest bass).\n\nIn December 1957, the brothers were going to lip-sync to a record at a local cinema, just like other kids had done there before. But on the way to the venue, the fragile shellac 78-RPM record broke, forcing them to sing live and in harmony – possibly one of the best accidents they ever had. Encouraged by the audience’s positive reception, Barry, Maurice and Robin knew what they wanted to do for the rest of their lives: singing together professionally.\n\nIn May 1958, Forst and Horrocks left, which put an end to The Rattlesnakes. But determined to pursue a career in music, the Gibb brothers immediately formed a new group, Wee Johnny Hayes and the Blue Cats. Only three months later, their family emigrated to the metropolitan area of Brisbane, Australia. But that didn’t stop the three brothers who soon started performing locally. In 1960, they met speedway driver and promoter Bill Good who hired them to entertain the audience at the local Redcliffe Speedway in 1960.\n\nGood also introduced the boys to Brisbane radio-presenter jockey Bill Gates. It was Gates who came up with the name ‘BGs’ after his, Good’s and Barry Gibbs’ initials, which was later changed to Bee Gees. The Bee Gees started to appear on TV shows and perform at resorts on the Queensland coast. After Barry presented some of his songs to Col Joye, an Australian pioneer rock artist, Joye helped the Bee Gees get a deal with Leedon Records, a subsidiary of Festival Records in 1963.\n\nIn March 1963, the Bee Gees released their debut single The Battle of the Blue and the Grey. Written by Barry Gibb, the country-oriented tune made it into the Australian charts, placing at no. 98.\n\nThe Bee Gees continued releasing two to three singles a year, while Barry also kept writing songs for other artists. In November 1965, their debut album The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs appeared. It was largely a compilation of their previous singles. One of the new songs was the opener I Was a Lover, a Leader of Men.\n\nThe early releases by the Bee Gees lacked commercial success, and by 1966, their record company was on the verge of dropping them. At that time, the Gibb brothers met Nat Kipner, who had just been appointed A&R manager of Spin Records, a new independent label. Kipner not only successfully managed the Bee Gees’ transfer to Spin but also introduced them to engineer and producer Ossie Byrne. Through Byrne, the Gibb brothers gained generous access to his own small, self-built St Clair Studio. Over several months in mid-1966, the Bee Gees recorded a large amount of original songs there.\n\nDisillusioned by their lack of success in Australia, Barry, Maurice and Robin decided to return to England, hoping they could be more successful there. While at sea in January 1967, they found out that Spicks and Specks, one of the tunes they had recorded at St Clair Studio, had been named Best Single of the Year by Australia’s most popular and influential music newspaper Go-Set.\n\nSpicks and Specks hit no. 1 and no. 2 in New Zealand and the Netherlands, respectively, and climbed to no. 5 on the Australian charts. The Bee Gees had scored their first hit. England would bring them international fame.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart – documentary directed by Frank Marshall; YouTube\n\nI guess it’s safe to assume this has happened to most folks, particularly those who are into music – suddenly, out of the blue, a song pops into your head you haven’t heard in a million years. Well, that’s what I encountered yesterday with When the War is Over, a tune by Australian rock band Cold Chisel.\n\nIt brought me right back to my early twenties when I was playing bass in a band. When the War is Over was one of the covers we did. I was delighted to find it in the library of my streaming music provider. It also turned out I still like it. Then I checked out Cold Chisel. Not only did I discover they still exist, but I also saw they are from Australia. I had no idea about the latter, or at least I don’t recall.\n\nThe above episode further made me think about music from Australia. It didn’t take long to remind myself how much great music has come from this part of the world. And there’s much more than just AC/DC, Men at Work and Little River Band, the first three acts that came to my mind.\n\nSince for the most part, this blog focuses on the U.S., England and Canada with occasional posts about German artists, I thought taking a musical trip down under would be well warranted and fun. And since putting everything in one post would be too much, I spontaneously decided to make this a two-part mini-series. So, all on board and let’s go!\n\nAC/DC\n\nOne of the greatest rock bands I know, AC/DC were formed in Sydney in 1973 by Scottish-born brothers Malcolm Young (guitar, backing vocals) and Angus Young (lead guitar). The band has gone through many line-up changes and a good deal of tragedy over the decades. Technically, they are still around. There were some recent reports about a new album, for example here and here. Supposedly, it’s a tribute to Malcolm Young, who passed away in November 2017. Reportedly, the album reunites Angus Young with former lead vocalist Brian Johnson, bass player Cliff Williams and drummer Phil Rudd, featuring songs Malcolm had recorded with the band before he was no longer able to play due to dementia. It also features Malcolm’s nephew Stevie Young. Well, I guess we’ll just have to wait and see. Meanwhile, here’s a tune arguably from AC/DC’s best phase with lead vocalist Bon Scott. I don’t care that is has been played 100 million times. To me, Highway to Hell will always remain one of the most epic rock songs. Co-written by the Young brothers and Scott, it was the title track from AC/DC’s sixth studio album released in July 1979.\n\nBee Gees\n\nI realize seeing the Bee Gees in this mini-series may surprise readers, especially fans of blues and rock, music genres I dig and celebrate in this blog. But while the Bee Gees clearly fall outside these genres, I actually like many of their songs for their three-part harmonies, catchy melodies and grooves. And, dare I say it, this even includes their disco-oriented tunes. Since the Gibb brothers were born in England, only lived in Australia for about nine years and didn’t become famous until after they had returned to England, one could also ask whether the Bee Gees should even be considered to be an Australian band. I think it’s defensible since their story started down under when Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb started singing together in December 1957 – remarkably before they had even reached their teenage years. During the first half of the ’60s, they released a few singles each year. In November 1965, their debut album The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs appeared, billed as Barry Gibb & The Bee Gees. But their early efforts remained largely unsuccessful, so the Gibb brothers decided to return to England in early 1967. Before they did, they recorded various tunes, including Spicks and Specks, which became their first hit. In February 1967, the Bee Gees signed a deal with Polydor and in July that year released their first international full-length record, Bee Gees’ 1st. The psychedelic pop album marked their international breakthrough and the rest is history. Here’s the above noted Spicks and Specks, written by Barry Gibb.\n\nThe Church\n\nThe Church were initially established as a trio in Sydney in March 1980 by singer-songwriter and bassist Steve Kilby, guitarist Peter Koppes and drummer Nick Ward. English guitarist Marty Willson-Piper joined one month later after he had seen one of the band’s gigs. In April 1981, The Church released their debut album Of Skins and Heart in Australia, which internationally came out in January 1982 and was titled The Church. The band is still around. Just recently on February 1st, Kilby announced Koppes had departed, leaving him as the only original member. In October 2017, I covered the most recent album by The Church, Man Woman Life Death Infinity, which reminded me of their album I know best and dig to this day: Starfish from April 1988. I just love the atmospheric, spacial sound of that record. Here’s Reptile, credited to all four members of the band at the time: Kilby, Koppes, Ward and Richard Ploog (drums, percussion).\n\nCold Chisel\n\nSince the idea of this mini-series was sparked by When the War is Over, I simply couldn’t leave out Cold Chisel. That being said, this song and a few other tunes I’ve heard in the meantime pretty much sum up what I know about this band, which was founded in Adelaide in 1973. Wikipedia describes their music as pub rock, R&B, hard rock and rock & roll. Based on what I’ve heard thus far, this doesn’t seem to be off-base. Cold Chisel’s original line-up consisted of Ian Moss (lead guitar, vocals), Don Walker (keyboards, backing vocals), Jimmy Barnes (vocals, guitar), Les Kaczmarek (bass) and Steve Prestwich (drums). They broke up in December 1983 and reunited in October 1997 with a different line-up. While Cold Chisel have enjoyed significant popularity in Australia and New Zealand, success has largely eluded them in other parts of the world. The lyrics of the November 1981 single You Got Nothing I Want, an attack on the U.S. music industry over its lack of the band’s promotion, pretty much sealed their fate in this market. Here’s the aforementioned When the War is Over, which was written by Prestwich and appeared on the band’s fourth studio album Circus Animals released in March 1982.\n\nCrowded House\n\nCrowded House, which I know best from their ’80s pop-rock, were formed in Melbourne in 1985 by Neil Finn (guitar, vocals), Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Following their break-up in 1996, Crowded House have been on and off. In 2016, Finn confirmed the band is on indefinite hiatus. In April 2018, he joined Fleetwood Mac to replace Lindsey Buckingham, together with Mike Campbell. But now that the Mac’s 13-month world tour is over and, according to a recent interview Mick Fleetwood gave to Rolling Stone, they are unlikely to do another extended tour, Crowded House are back with a new line-up: Finn (lead vocals, guitar keyboards), Seymour (bass, backing vocals) and Mitchell Froom (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), along with Finn’s sons Liam Finn (guitars, keyboards, backing vocals) and Elroy Finn (guitars). Perhaps they should consider renaming themselves The Crowded Finns! Anyway, here’s a tune I loved back in the day and still dig: Don’t Dream It’s Over, written by Neil Finn, and from their 1986 eponymous debut album.\n\nStay tuned for part II…\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Fox News; Ultimate Classic Rock; Rolling Stone; YouTube\n\nI can’t believe almost three months have passed since my last installment in this long-running recurring feature. For some reason, at times, I need to convince myself to start digging through music history for a specific date yet again, though once I do so, I’m usually intrigued with what comes up. Of course, there are occasions where what I find only mildly excites me. When that happens, I tend to refrain from writing a post. Anyway, April 14 turned out to be an interesting date.\n\n1945: Richard Hugh Blackmore, better known as Ritchie Blackmore, was born in the southwestern English seaside town of Weston-super-Mare. This means the guitarist and songwriter is turning 73 years old today. Blackmore is best known as one of the founding members of Deep Purple, which is still my favorite hard rock band to this day. Yes, there are other great hard rock bands, first and foremost Led Zeppelin, but if I had to choose one, it would still be Deep Purple. Blackmore also founded Rainbow in 1975 and revived the band as Ritchie Blackmore’s Rainbow in 2015. In 1997, he kissed rock music goodbye and established Blackmore’s Night, a British-American traditional folk-rock band with then-girlfriend Candice Night, who became his wife in 2008 – I suppose he carefully listened to what many parents tell their kids about getting engaged or married: Don’t rush it! 🙂 In 2016, Blackmore was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Deep Purple. Here’s Blackmore in action with a cool high-speed guitar solo: Highway Star, from my favorite 1972 Deep Purple album Machine Head. Happy birthday!\n\n1963: The Beatles saw The Rolling Stones perform for the first time at The Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, a suburban town in southwest London. “They were still on the club scene, stomping about, doing R&B tunes,” recalled George Harrison, according to The Beatles Bible. “The music they were playing was more like we’d been doing before we’d got out of our leather suits to try and get onto record labels and television.” Added Paul McCartney: “Mick tells the tale of seeing us there with long suede coats that we’d picked up in Hamburg, coats that no one could get in England. He thought, ‘Right – I want to be in the music business; I want one of those coats.'” And what did Ringo Starr have to say? “I knew then that the Stones were great. They just had presence. And, of course, we could tell – we’d had five weeks in the business; we knew all about it!” Last but not least, here’s some of John Lennon’s recollection: “They [The Stones] were run by a different guy then, Giorgio Gomelsky. When we started hanging around London, the Stones were up and coming in the clubs, and we knew Giorgio through Epstein. We went down and saw them and became good friends.”\n\n1966: The Spencer Davis Group was on top of the U.K. Singles Chart with Somebody Help Me, scoring their second no. 1 single in the U.K. Like their first chart-topper Keep On Running, the tune was written by Jackie Edwards, a Jamaican musician and songwriter. The song was also included on the band’s third studio album Autumn ’66 released in August 1966. If my math is correct, Steve Winwood, who sang lead and played keyboards, was all of 17 years when they recorded the single. He was still known as Stevie Winwood at the time – what an amazing talent!\n\n1967: The Bee Gees released their debut single in the U.S., New York Mining Disaster 1941. Co-written by Barry Gibb and Robin Gibb, it became the band’s first international single release and their first song to chart in the U.S. and the U.K., peaking at no. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and no. 12 on the U.K. Singles Chart, respectively. When the tune was released, there were rumors the Bee Gees actually were The Beatles recording under a pseudonym. “If you sounded like the Beatles and also could write a hit single, then the hype of the machine would go into action, and your company would make sure people thought you sounded like the Beatles or thought you were the Beatles,” recalled Barry Gibb, according to the 2012 biography The Bee Gees – Tales of the Brothers Gibb, by Hector Cook, Melinda Bilyeu and Andrew Mon Hughes. “And that sold you, attracted attention to you. It was good for us because everyone thought it was the Beatles under a different name.” While it’s safe to assume opinions about the Bee Gees are divided among readers of the blog, I’ve actually always thought they were pretty talented vocalists and songwriters.\n\n1972: David Bowie released Starman as a single in the U.K., which became his second major hit there since Space Oddity from July 1969, peaking at no. 10 on the singles chart. In the U.S., the single performed more moderately, reaching no. 65 on the Billboard Hot 100. Written by Bowie, the tune was a late addition to his fifth and, in my opinion, best studio album The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars released in June 1972. It also happens to be one of my favorite Bowie tunes.\n\nSources: Wikipedia, This Day In Music, This Day In Rock, The Beatles Bible, YouTube"
