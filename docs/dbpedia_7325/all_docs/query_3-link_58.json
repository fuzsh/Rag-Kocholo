        "text": "Going on to say how much he valued the award, Gibb added: “It’s all surreal and a great shock. It is not something I personally ever expected to happen in my life so this is the greatest honour that your culture can give you.”\n\nAlthough Gibb did not comment further on the event, the obvious display of difficulty may have been caused by his long-term battle with arthritis, which he first spoke about in an interview with Michael Parkinson.\n\nIt was reported by The Mirror that during the episode of legendary telly show Parksinson which aired in 2001, Gibb said: “I suffer from extensive arthritis, so it's pretty much everywhere\n\n\"You can see it in my hands. This thumb is out of its socket. There's already a knuckle gone. But I have to deal with it.”\n\nThe singer went on to explain that doctors blame the onset of the condition on “too many gruelling tours” as well as playing too much tennis, which the star started to play when he was 33 years old.\n\n“I love tennis, but I didn't start playing until I was about 33, and that's too late,\" Gibb added. “The joints really start to suffer then. Unknown to myself, I damaged all my joints. There were times about five years ago when I literally couldn't get out of bed. I was living in pain.\n\n“My lower back problems really began in 1989 on the One For All tour, which was agony for me. I got through it and then there was another tour, and we did Europe. I was supposed to do America after that, but the pain was unbearable.\n\n“I went to hospital and said to the doctor, ‘If it doesn't look right, fix it. It's killing me’. Back surgery isn't a pleasant experience. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and I think my back surgery aggravated the arthritis.\n\n“Sometimes it can be my knee or my hands, although my real problem is my left shoulder. I can't completely lift my left arm. Fortunately I can still play the guitar, but I have to strap my wrists up to give them support. It's the twisting of the wrist that causes the pain, so it's OK.”\n\nArthritis is a common condition that refers to joint pain or joint disease. The Arthritis Foundation explains that there are more than 100 types of arthritis and related conditions, affecting everyone of all ages.\n\nIn the UK, more than 10 million people have arthritis or other, similar conditions that affect the joints, with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis being the two most common.\n\nArthritis can cause permanent joint changes. These may be visible, such as knobby finger joints, but often the damage can only be seen on X-ray. Some types of arthritis also affect the heart, eyes, lungs, kidneys and skin as well as the joints."
