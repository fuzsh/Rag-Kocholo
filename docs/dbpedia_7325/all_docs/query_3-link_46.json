        "text": "Since Barry Gibb has a new album set for release this summer it got me thinking about whether he could have benefitted from an outside \"Name\" producer post-BGs. Other than Still Waters, where the Gibbs experimented with multiple producers, they've kept things pretty much \"in-house\" over the years (I do know the Robin had a rather unpleasant experience with Mitchell Froom years ago).\n\nJeff Lynne might have been an interesting match-up. Or maybe Barry's notorious \"thin skin\" wouldn't have allowed him to work well with others. Thoughts?\n\nIn my opinion Mark Ronson worked wonders as a producer/musical collaborator for Duran Duran. I'm thankful for All You Need Is Now and Paper Gods. That said, I don't think he'd be right for Barry Gibb. Then again, I really don't know who'd be right for Barry Gibb in terms of production duties. I'm not even sure Barry Gibb would be the right producer for Barry Gibb. When artists get older and decide to produce themselves, their sound often seem to become more lifeless and stale.\n\nI love ELO. I love Jeff Lynne as a singer-songwriter. But I tend to have a problem with his somewhat bombastic production values when producing other artists (e.g. Tom Petty). I don't think he'd be right for Barry Gibb. I think he needs a producer who's a little more \"smooth and sophisticated\". Who? I have no idea!"
