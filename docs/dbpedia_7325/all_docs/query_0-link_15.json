        "text": "CAPITOL RECORDS SIGNS THE BEE GEES TO LONG-TERM WORLDWIDE AGREEMENT ENCOMPASSING THE LEGENDARY GROUP’S ENTIRE CATALOGUE OF RECORDED MUSIC\n\nComprehensive marketing and sales campaigns for The Bee Gees’ illustrious catalogue to be conceived and executed by Capitol in conjunction with Universal Music Enterprises, Barry Gibb and estates of Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb\n\nHOLLYWOOD, November 29, 2016 – The Bee Gees, one of the world’s most commercially successful and acclaimed bands in the history of popular music, has signed a long-term worldwide agreement with Capitol Records that encompasses the legendary trio’s entire catalogue of recorded music, it was announced today by Capitol Music Group (CMG) Chairman and CEO Steve Barnett and Bee Gees founding member Barry Gibb. In addition to 22 studio albums and several soundtracks, including the mega-selling Saturday Night Fever, the agreement includes the rights to numerous compilation albums, unreleased recordings and long-form audiovisual projects.\n\nCapitol, in conjunction with Universal Music Enterprises (UMe), Barry Gibb and the estates of co-founding members Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb – will spearhead an array of comprehensive and forward-thinking sales and marketing campaigns designed to reinvigorate The Bee Gees’ illustrious catalogue. As Steve Barnett explained, “The Bee Gees catalogue is one of the most esteemed and important bodies of work in the history of recorded music, and we are brimming with ideas that will remind fans of its brilliance and further the band’s legacy by introducing their music to new audiences. All of us at the company are honored that The Bee Gees have chosen Capitol as their new home.”\n\nAccording to Barry Gibb, “The whole family is overwhelmed by this new agreement. To be surrounded by the greatest record people and artists of all time is a very humbling experience. Wish my brothers were here to share it.”\n\nUniversal Music Group Chairman & CEO Sir Lucian Grainge commented, “There are few artists in history who have created a body of work so successful, diverse and timeless as Barry, Robin and Maurice. We’re delighted to welcome the incomparable music of the Bee Gees to the Universal Music Group family and we look forward to building upon their incredible legacy.”\n\nUniversal Music Enterprises President & CEO Bruce Resnikoff added, “The music of the Bee Gees appeals to music lovers in every corner of the globe, and it is an honor to work with this incredible catalog of recorded music. We look forward to showcasing their exceptional body of work and introducing them to a new legion of fans while staying true to their longtime, loyal audience.”\n\nIn an extraordinary recording career that took off in 1967 with their hit single, “New York Mining Disaster 1941,” and continued into the 21st Century with their final album, This Is Where I Came In, in 2001, The Bee Gees – brothers Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb – sold more than 220 million records worldwide and earned their stature as one of the biggest selling groups of all time. Recording 22 studio albums and numerous soundtracks – including the monumentally-successful and best-selling soundtrack of all time, Saturday Night Fever – The Bee Gees infused popular culture with dozens of worldwide hit singles that featured their singular and highly-influential three-part harmonies. They achieved nine #1 and 23 Top-Ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, including “How Deep Is Your Love,” “Night Fever,” and “Stayin’ Alive” from Saturday Night Fever, plus “How Can You Mend A Broken Heart,” “I Started A Joke” “One,” “Lonely Days,” “Words,” and numerous other classics.\n\nTheir soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever is one of the biggest-selling and culturally significant albums of all time, having sold more than 40 million copies around the world, spawned four Bee Gees global hits and reinvigorated the trio’s earlier hits “Jive Talkin'” and “You Should Be Dancing.” The album was added to the National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress in 2013 for long-term preservation, having been cited for its cultural, artistic and historic importance.\n\nAmong the countless awards and accolades bestowed upon The Bee Gees are eight Grammy Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music and a Legend Award from the World Music Awards. They have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and the Dance Music Hall of Fame. All three brothers were appointed Commanders in the Order of the British Empire in 2001.\n\nAbout Universal Music Group"
