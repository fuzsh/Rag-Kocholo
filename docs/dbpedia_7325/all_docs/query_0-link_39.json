Stephen recalled that he came to a crossroads and turned his life around, knowing that if he carried as he was he faced 'death, prison or a mental institution.'\n\nThe Bee Gees' flawless harmonies during a live MTV performance in 1993 is a lost masterpiece\n\nWatch the extraordinary moment the Bee Gees busked on the streets of London in 1993\n\nBee Gees first TV gig: Teenage Barry Gibb and 10 year olds Robin and Maurice sing in 1960\n\nThe 40 best disco songs ever, ranked in order of dancefloor-filling greatness\n\nSpeaking on his recovery podcast, Addiction Talks, the performer said: \"The first time I drank I was probably 14 and I downed an entire bottle of Jack Daniels [and] blacked out.\"\n\nHe went on to describe his spiral from having regular work to losing everything.\n\n\"After I lost my gig with my band I was homeless, they throw away so much good food in studios and I remember eating out of the dumpster at the record plant praying nobody would see me,\" he says.\n\n\"I remember thinking ‘This sucks’.'I was living in my van or wherever I could land. If somebody let me crash on a couch I was fortunate.\n\n\"The thing for me that was mind blowing was the old saying, from Park Avenue to park bench.\"\n\nOnce he turned his life around and got sober, Stephen Gibb went back to performing, writing music and regularly playing the guitar with his dad, however, the threat of addiction has sadly been rife in the Gibb family.\n\nThe youngest Gibb brother, Andy Gibb, died in 1988 aged just 30 due to heart problems caused by cocaine addiction.\n\nWhen Barry Gibb's son got on stage for emotional duet of Bee Gees' 'I've Gotta Get A Message to You'\n\nWatch the extraordinary moment the Bee Gees busked on the streets of London in 1993\n\nWhen Bee Gees gave a rare acoustic TV performance of 'Massachusetts' and brought down the house\n\nQUIZ: How well do you know the Bee Gees' song lyrics?\n\nSamantha's father, Maurice Gibb, was a recovering alcoholic who died after a cardiac arrest in 2003 aged 53, and Robin Gibb died in 2012 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nFollowing on from the release of the Bee Gees documentary How Can You Mend a Broken Heart, Barry Gibb went on the record to say he won't watch the film because he couldn't handle seeing the loss of his family.\n\nSpeaking to CBS Sunday Morning in January 2021, the 74-year-old said: “I can’t handle watching the loss of my family. I just can’t handle it.\"\n\n\"Who would? I think it’s perfectly normal to not want to see how each brother was lost, you know? And I don’t want to address it. I’m past it.\"\n\nTouching upon the loss of his brothers in the interview, Barry described it as \"incredibly, incredibly hard\".\n\n\"We've never not been together,\" he said. \"The first year after the last brother passed, Robin, that was the most difficult period for me.\"\n\nWhen Barry Gibb sang heartfelt 'To Love Somebody' on This Morning after brother Robin's death\n\nWhen Barry and Robin Gibb sang a flawless medley as Maurice tried to make them laugh\n\nBarry Gibb larks around in adorable homemade video recorded by his young son in the 1980s\n\nWatch Barry Gibb serenade his beloved wife Linda with tender rendition of 'Words'\n\n\"And people have said, 'He had a breakdown.' You know, I didn't have a breakdown, actually.\"\n\nThe singer continued: \"I just didn't know where to go. I didn't know what to do. And I didn't know how to be perceived. I didn't know how to perceive other people's opinions.\n\n2024 saw the remaining Bee Gee honoured for his lifetime artistic achievements at the Kennedy Center Honors.\n\nBarry joined fellow honorees Billy Crystal, Queen Latifah and Dionne Warwick, for the event, where Dolly Parton, Lionel Richie, Barbra Streisand and Paul McCartney appeared in pre-recorded messages for Barry, before country band Little Big Town sang the Bee Gees’ 'Lonely Days'.\n\nAt the end of his speech, Barry paid tribute to his late brothers, saying: \"Thank you all, this is the most incredible honour of my life."
