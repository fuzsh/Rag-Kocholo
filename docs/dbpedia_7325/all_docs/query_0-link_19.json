This experience I will treasure forever.\"\n\nWhen Barry and Robin Gibb sang a flawless medley as Maurice tried to make them laugh\n\nWhen Michael Jackson invented the robot dance on live TV - video\n\nWhen Michael Jackson beatboxed and sang 'Who Is it' acapella for an awestruck Oprah Winfrey\n\nThe footage showed Michael Jackson in a way the public rarely got to see him, relaxed and focused on making music alongside good friend Barry Gibb.\n\nA Billboard report from 2002 said that MJ turned up on Barry's doorstep with the half-finished track and was drawn to writing with the Bee Gee because both artists opposed the Iraq war, but Barry Gibb refuted these claims in 2011.\n\n\"[All in Your Name is] the message that Michael wanted to send out to all of his fans all over the world,\" Gibb wrote. \"That he did it all for them and for the pure love of music.\"\n\nThe Bee Gees and Michael Jackson's friendship went back decades, with Barry Gibb naming one of his sons after the singer – who was also Michael Gibb's godfather – and Jackson attending fellow Bee Gee Maurice Gibb's funeral in 2003.\n\nBarry Gibb inviting Maurice's daughter on stage for duet of 'How Can You Mend a Broken Heart' is so moving\n\nLast known video of Maurice, Robin and Barry singing together in 2001 is sensational\n\nAndy Gibb outshines older brother Barry with jaw dropping solo of Bee Gees’ ‘Words’ in 1981\n\n\"We are devastated,\" Barry Gibb said after MJ's sudden death on June 25, 2009, with his brother Robin Gibb adding: \"We've not only lost a great friend in Michael, but also lost a wonderful sensitive human being.\""
