        "text": "Each week, Benjamin Law asks public figures to discuss the subjects we're told to keep private by getting them to roll a die. The numbers they land on are the topics they're given. This week, he talks to Barry Gibb. The 74-year-old multiple Grammy Award-winner is the sole surviving member of the Bee Gees. His music and songwriting career has spanned more than five decades.\n\nRELIGION\n\nAre you a religious person, Barry? I am a religious person, in that I am a person with a lot of faith. But I try to study all religions and don’t really belong to one particular religion. When I was a kid, it was Church of England. But when you base that on the fact that Henry VIII invented it, that’s not really a religion, is it?\n\nWhat do you have faith in? Well, I have faith in myself. I have faith in my family. And I have faith in life, and a deep faith that there’s something after that.\n\nHave you ever lost faith in anything? No, I’ve always believed in destiny.\n\nWhat about people? Have you ever lost faith in anyone? Well, I’ve never met a man who I could have total trust in. That’s just something we all deal with. Being in a pop group, and being brothers, there was always someone ready to destroy those dynamics for their own sake. So yeah, I’ve seen a lot of that.\n\nI imagine the music industry can be a viper’s nest. “Viper’s nest” is the right term! [Laughs] You just do the best you can with every chance you get. If those opportunities don’t come your way, then that’s destiny telling you you’re on the wrong path.\n\nWhat do you think happens after we die? Who knows. I believe it’s a better place. I have a feeling that we’re not here for no reason.\n\nComplete the sentence for me, Barry. Other people go to church. I ... … stay home! [Laughs] Because I’m in lockdown [in Miami]. So I don’t go to church. Do I pray? Yes, I do.\n\nWhat do you pray for? The health of my family, my kids and my grandkids. And I pray for music to come back in a more romantic way.\n\nPOLITICS\n\nLoading\n\nYou’ve lived between the US, the UK and Australia. You’re in the US now. Do you vote there?\n\nOur country is in such chaos. We’ve all lost that commonsense; the unity and agreement between us. I voted by mail, the first time I’ve ever voted [in the US]. Really, in America, it was essential for people to vote – or about as many as possible.\n\nNow the election is over, are you hopeful or fearful? I’m always hopeful. I don’t think these past four years have worked out well. I don’t like seeing people who have lost their businesses and can’t get them back because no one’s doing anything about it.\n\nIs it right for me to assume you voted for Joe Biden? Oh, I prefer not to discuss that.\n\nOkay, what were the issues that you voted on? I didn’t vote on issues. I voted for whoever I thought should be the next president, who I thought was most qualified.\n\nNow you are technically Sir Barry Gibb. Yes, sir.\n\nSo does that mean you’re a fan of the monarchy and the British system? Yeah, I love the royal family. Prince Charles, in particular. He’s always been very kind and affectionate towards me when we’ve met, which has been two or three times over the years. I think it’s great for a country to have one family to look up to and to emulate. You know, I can’t fault it. I love them.\n\nYou’ve combined work and family in your career. What’s your advice for other people combining work and family, in how to navigate family politics? Every family is different, so I can’t recommend anything except: never allow arguments in your house, and never allow people to raise their voices. If you want to fight and argue, go outside. I like my house to be quiet and peaceful. Apart from Netflix. [Laughs]\n\nIf you love the royal family, I assume you’re going to watch the latest season of The Crown?\n\nOh, I can’t wait.\n\nMONEY\n\nLoading\n\nYou’re the second most successful songwriter in history, behind Paul McCartney. Yeah!\n\nWhich begs the question, how rich are you? [Chuckles] Well, I’ve been asked that a few times, and there’s no answer. First of all, you’ll never know how many records you’ve ever sold. It’s never something you’re privy to as a recording artist. But I figured out my own philosophy: I don’t care about money. Of course you’ve got to have it but I don’t make it an obsession. All I want is a television, a bed and at least one major meal a day.\n\nWhat’s the most expensive thing you own? The home I live in now [in Miami]. And the home we have in England [in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire], which is magnificent.\n\nWhat about besides property? Oh, no, I can’t get into that … It’s crazy. [Laughs]\n\nWhat can’t money buy? For me, spirituality. A sense of caring about everyone in your family and dealing with that. You can’t buy that. And money can’t buy you love. There’s a lot of things money can’t buy. I know a few extremely wealthy people, well beyond anything I could imagine. And I don’t always see those people being happy. You could be a billionaire, but not be a happy billionaire.\n\nAre you a happy millionaire or billionaire? [Laughs] I’m happy.\n\nThe Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart documentary is in cinemas this month. Barry’s new album Greenfields: The Gibb Brothers Songbook, Vol. 1, is out in January and features Dolly Parton, Keith Urban, Olivia Newton-John and Gillian Welch."
