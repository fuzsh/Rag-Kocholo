        "text": "Sir Barry Gibb has for some time now looked like a retired lion. That’s entirely fitting for his regal standing among songwriters. Gibb and his brothers in the Bee Gees, twins Maurice and Robin, spent 40 years being unfashionable while writing some of the best-loved, most played and most covered songs in the world. You won’t hear other musicians bad mouthing Barry Gibb. Like Brian Wilson, he must now look back, the oldest and only surviving brother of his musical pride. And like the Wilsons, the Gibbs were both protected and trapped by the family firm.\n\nLike any truly prolific songwriter, Gibb has produced his fair share of chaff with his wheat, but if you judge him by his best work, he is close to peerless. From 1960s melodrama to blue-eyed soul to disco, Gibb and the Bee Gees have followed their own idiosyncratic path, lurching in and out of popularity, but always irreducibly pop.\n\nPop is not really a genre at all. Anyone who has seen Trolls World Tour will know pop can be sneered at as some parasitical organism that assimilates and corrupts “genuine” music to its tyrannical forms.\n\nI prefer to see pop as something positive and can define it only as a thing that exists without explanation, without qualification. Pop exists to please itself. It has its own pretensions and illusions, its own drama and passing mythologies. This is not a matter of good and bad or better and worse. It certainly isn't about being cool. The most wonderful thing about music is that you can always have your cake and eat it. That’s why, over the past 50 years, pop has been anything from The Supremes or Elton John to Lady Gaga and The Human League or Spice Girls to Prince.\n\nThat doesn’t mean pop can’t be absolute guff, too. But a single good pop song has the weight to hit the ground and bear fruit, whereas a thousand bad ones don’t matter anyway and fly away unloved and unnoticed like dust in the wind. Barry Gibb has grown a mighty forest of pop songs that is unmatched in the past 50 years.\n\nBarry and his brothers were writing hits in their teens on their return to the UK in 1967, via an atypical childhood starting on the Isle Of Man and in Manchester and then the haven of Australia, where the family had moved to prevent the mischievous Gibb boys from falling foul of the law. The measure of these global hits is how many have been covered and how often, particularly by boy bands who tap into the innocent angst – an almost childlike pain that could easily be interpreted as the pain of three troubled boys barely out of school – including “To Love Somebody”, “I’ve Gotta Get A Message To You” and “Words”.\n\nFrom this Beatles-size success, they went into the early 1970s fighting each other and failing together and as solo artists, making largely unloved records, with some notable exceptions such as “How Can You Mend A Broken Heart”, covered by Al Green. If Reverend Green deigns to sing one of your songs – and what a version it is – there can be no room for doubt of your soul credentials.\n\nThere were promising signs of a commercial comeback in 1975’s Main Course, which featured “Jive Talking”, “Fanny (Be Tender With My Love)” and “Nights On Broadway” (Candi Staton’s cover of this is a real swinger), while Barry discovered his falsetto, which was like finding the key to a treasure chest, but also part of the template that left him and his brothers to contend with mockery and disrespect while they counted their gazillions.\n\nAlong with that falsetto, the next album, Children Of The World, saw them adopt the look that so defined them for better or worse. Open-chested jackets, medallions, hair blowing in the wind with a faraway look in their eyes and those magnificent teeth, which were always exposed, as if the three of them were experiencing some kind of continuous ache – which may not have been far from the truth. Whatever Barry Gibb wrote, there was something out of kilter. Many of their disco songs have an innate sadness that comes from somewhere deep within them, but being the private, guarded, slightly paranoid closed family unit the Bee Gees were, there remain many unanswered questions.\n\nSaturday Night Fever sold 45 million copies and there is very little left to say about it. “Night Fever” is equal parts uplifting and woebegone, while “How Deep Is Your Love”, with its layered and lush Fender Rhodes piano melody and bass, is like falling hopelessly in love in a luxury spa. At the absolute zenith of their commercial success, the Bee Gees made (with their impresario manager, Robert Stigwood, and a number of equally confused and regretful musicians and actors) a fictional film interpretation of the Beatles' Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. There is no one alive or dead who can provide a reasonable explanation for why this film was made. If you could find a copy, which is now notoriously tricky, you can give it a go but I don’t fancy your chances.\n\nNo matter. As Bob Stanley pointed out in his encyclopaedic love letter to popular music, Yeah Yeah Yeah, the Bee Gees were responsible for writing and producing eight US No1s in 1978, four as the Bees Gees, two for their brother, Andy Gibb, the Grease theme and Yvonne Elliman’s “If I Can’t Have You” from Saturday Night Fever. In the same year he wrote “Emotions” for Samantha Sang (covered by Destiny’s Child). Barry Gibb is the only writer to have had four consecutive US No1s with four different songs.\n\nThe backlash began with Spirits Having Flown in 1979 (it sold 30m copies – some backlash!), which had more smash hits, but took their previous absurdities to stratospheric heights of bombast. After this album they were either hated or deliberately ignored, victims of their own ubiquity. US radio stations promised Bee Gee-free days. Kenny Everett mocked them on his TV show, a spoof band led by Angus Deayton called the HeeBeeGeeBees released a series of singles such as “Meaningless Songs (In Very High Voices)”, cowritten by Richard Curtis.\n\nStill Barry ploughed on. If the world had turned on the Bee Gees, he would write for other artists. You may have heard a few of them. If Burt Bacharach is no longer writing for you, as Dionne Warwick found, get Barry and the boys to come up with “Heartbreaker” and “All The Love In The World.” Barbra Streisand had Barry write and produce her 1980 album Guilty, the title track and “Woman In Love” his bona fide masterpieces. And there was the irresistible “Islands In The Stream” for Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers, which is a generation- and genre-proof song, the holy grail of any pop writer.\n\nThe Bee Gees had more No1s in the 1980s, as themselves and for others. Still they were mocked. Clive Anderson was just bloody rude to them on his chat show and they walked out, which left him looking like a petty schoolboy and made them even more tetchy and suspicious. Why, they must have thought, can we not get the respect we deserve? Earnest and cagey throughout, they were neither mysterious and brooding or dry and quickly charming. They remained largely unknown and unknowable as characters outside their inner circle. But Barry's Glastonbury set in 2017 was suitably triumphant and he got his much-deserved knighthood in 2018. He deserves a whole lot more than the recognition and esteem that has been sometimes hard to come by. Along with Sir Paul McCartney, Barry Gibb’s music has given more joy to more people than anyone else alive. He is the king, the retired lion king.\n\nNow read\n\nElton John writes about how the Troubadour changed his life\n\nLondon swings: How Britain invented the Sixties\n\nSixteen Björk songs that will convert anyone into a lifelong fan"
