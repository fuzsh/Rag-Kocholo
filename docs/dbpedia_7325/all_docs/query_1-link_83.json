        "text": "They've left a lasting musical legacy.\n\nWhen the Bee Gees formed from humble beginnings as brothers with a dream to be songwriters, they themselves unlikely to become so successful.\n\nTheir incredible body of work is not the only legacy Barry Gibb and his twin brothers Robin and Maurice have left, however.\n\nWhen Barry Gibb was joined on-screen by late Robin Gibb for emotional duet of Bee Gees' 'I Started A Joke'\n\nBee Gees: How three 'strange' brothers didn’t 'fit in' but went on to define an era of pop music\n\nListen to the Bee Gees’ incredible cover of The Beatles classic for forgotten movie\n\nBee Gees first TV gig: Teenage Barry Gibb and 10 year olds Robin and Maurice sing in 1960\n\nThey each had a brood of beautiful children, extending the Gibb family into new generations with a total of twelve children between the three Bee Gees brothers.\n\nSo, who are the Bee Gees' children? In order of eldest to youngest, here's everything you need to know:\n\nSpencer Gibb: Born September 21, 1972\n\nSpencer Gibb was the first of the Bee Gees' offspring to be born, and is Robin's first son with his first wife Molly Hullis.\n\nWhen Spencer was born, Robin told his father: \"Molly and I have been longing for a baby. I feel as though I'm living on cloud nine.\"\n\nA musician himself and playing in a variety of bands as a youngster, Spencer said it was a dream that urged him to learn the guitar and relocate to Miami where the Bee Gees' careers were revitalised during the seventies.\n\n\"If there's anything I can say about living in Miami and doing drugs, it's that I learned to play guitar,\" he later joked.\n\nHaving made music as a solo artist, Spencer later formed the band 4-track Mind which changed their name to 54 Seconds, releasing a series of albums. He later made music with his cousin Samantha under the name, The Ghost Twins.\n\nSpencer has had a few brushes with music megastars throughout his life - Prince reportedly told him he was a good dancer, and he snogged Madonna at a nightclub in New York City.\n\nStephen Gibb: Born December 1, 1973\n\nStephen Gibb is the eldest son of Barry Gibb and his wife Linda.\n\nLearning to play guitar at the age of thirteen, Stephen has had a successful career in music, playing in metal bands like Black Label Society and 58.\n\nA poignant moment for Stephen was getting to perform alongside his father during Barry's Mythology Tour through Australia and New Zealand in 2013, when they performed an emotional duet of 'I've Gotta Get A Message To You'.\n\nThe night Barry Gibb and Stephen Gibb sang 'Grease' as a sensational father-son duet\n\nBarry Gibb and son Stephen perform stunning lockdown medley of stripped back Bee Gees hits\n\nWhen Barry Gibb's son got on stage for emotional duet of Bee Gees' 'I've Gotta Get A Message to You'\n\nTalking to The Australian at the time, Barry gushed: \"It's a thrill to look left and see Sami and to look to my right and see my eldest son, and they are both fantastic.\"\n\nStephen continued to collaborate with his dad in 2016, when he co-wrote the album In The Now, with Barry stating it was Stephen's energy and enthusiasm that encouraged him to make it.\n\n\"They give me that youth,\" he said at the time of the album's release. \"They give me that fire.\"\n\nStephen married Gloria Levas in 2022, and they share two children Angus and Nina Gibb.\n\nMelissa Gibb: Born June 17, 1974\n\nMelissa Gibb is the eldest daughter of Robin Gibb and his first wife Molly Hullis.\n\nLiving her life out of the spotlight, Melissa is know is an Arabic translator and was last known to reside in Cyprus.\n\nAdam Gibb: Born February 23, 1976\n\nAdam Gibb is the eldest son of Maurice Gibb and his second wife Yvonne Spenceley Gibb. Maurice was married to Lulu before, but they had no children together.\n\nWhen the Bee Gees were awarded a CBE in 2004, Adam received the honour alongside his uncles Barry and Robin, in place of his late father who died the year before.\n\nThe story of Maurice Gibb’s whirlwind marriage to Lulu\n\nAdam is a musician, writing songs with his sister Samantha in 1997 in a bid to win a record contract under the name Luna Park.\n\nChoosing to live much of his life out of the spotlight, Adam joined The Gibb Collective in 2016, a band of the Bee Gees' children who released the album Please Don't Turn Out The Lights in 2017.\n\nHe is married to Elaine Kauder and has two children, Aiden Maurice Gibb and Olivia Grace Gibb.\n\nAshley Gibb: Born September 8, 1977\n\nAshley Gibb is Barry and Linda Gibb's second son, who first pursued a career in tennis before being convinced to work in music.\n\nIt wasn't until 2005 that he was asked to collaborate with Barbra Streisand on Guilty Pleasures, the follow-up album to Guilty which Barry Gibb helped her write and produce.\n\nImpressed by his songwriting talent - despite never having any professional expertise other than a ditty he wrote for a girlfriend in the nineties - Barry roped in Ashley to co-write his 2016 album In The Now alongside his older brother Stephen.\n\n\"The album is my opinion of life,\" Barry told Billboard in 2016. \"My feelings and my journey with my brothers, and without my brothers, with my parents and without my parents, and with my own family, seeing my kids have their own kids.\"\n\nAshley is married to Therese Gibb, who shares a son, Lucas Gibb.\n\nSamantha Gibb: Born July 2, 1980\n\nSamantha is the only daughter of Maurice Gibb and Yvonne Spenceley Gibb.\n\nLearning musical instruments since the age of five, Samantha was destined to become a musician herself, and now resides in the 'Music City' of Nashville, TN.\n\n\"Growing up watching my father really set the bar for what kind of musician and songwriter I wanted to be\", she later said.\n\nNotably, Samantha joined her uncle Barry on stage during the Mythology Tour in 2013 for a moving duet of 'How Can You Mend a Broken Heart'.\n\nWorking as a solo musician, as well as the duo The Ghost Twins with her cousin Spencer, Samantha also formed The Gibb Collective which brought the Gibb children and cousins together musically.\n\nMaurice Gibb's daughter Samantha sings haunting cover of Bee Gees' 'Stayin' Alive' and it's incredible\n\nBarry Gibb inviting Maurice's daughter on stage for duet of 'How Can You Mend a Broken Heart' is so moving\n\nWhen Barry Gibb invited his son and Maurice's daughter on stage for emotional revival of 'Stayin' Alive'\n\n\"It started when my partner Lazaro and I decided to do a cover of 'New York Mining Disaster 1941', Samantha revealed.\n\n\"We loved the way it turned out and thought it would be really cool to do more of it. We had been wanting to do a tribute for a long time for my dad and my uncles. It started to feel like the right time so we started to reach out then we talked to everybody.\"\n\n\"Each person decided to do a take on a track that was one of their favourites. The next thing we knew we had a ten-song album.\"\n\nSamantha's most recent solo single came in 2023 with 'Tongue-Tied', which was released via her own record label M.E.G. which named after her late father's initials.\n\nTravis Gibb: Born January 10, 1981\n\nBarry Gibb and Linda welcomed their third son Travis in 1981, who chose not to follow in his famous family's footsteps and become an estate agent in Miami instead.\n\nTravis is married to Stacy Bash Gibb, who shares two children: Layla and Liam Gibb.\n\nHe occasionally posts pictures of his family life on Instagram such as celebrating his children's birthdays, or shares pictures from his hiking adventures.\n\nRobin-John Gibb: Born January 21, 1983\n\nRobin-John Gibb, affectionately known as 'RJ', is the only son shared between Robin Gibb and his second wife Dwina Murphy, an author an artist he remained married to until his death in 2012.\n\nRJ is a singer-songwriter and recording artist also, having studied acting at RADA before venturing into the world of music.\n\nHe was only 29 years old when his father died, with RJ describing the experience of losing his \"best friend\" shortly after.\n\n\"I cradled his head and held his right hand,\" RJ explained to the Daily Mail. \"My mother held his left hand. I gave him a kiss and we told him we loved him as we watched him go.\"\n\nRobin Gibb's son RJ wants Rami Malek to play his dad in upcoming Bee Gees biopic\n\nWhen Robin Gibb received a standing ovation in final performance only weeks before he died\n\nRobin Gibb's son is expecting a child on anniversary of his Bee Gees dad's death\n\n\"He was my best friend. We were colleagues and had the same sense of humour. I think about him every day. I miss him dearly. And I am so proud of him.\"\n\nThe song 'I Started A Joke', which was synonymous with Robin's fragile lead vocal, has taken on a poignancy after RJ played it straight after his dad passed.\n\n\"I put the phone on his chest and that was the first time I broke down. I knew that song and its lyrics were perfect for that moment. That song will always have new meaning to me now.\"\n\nMarried to Megan Golub, RJ has three children: Maxwell-Robin, Theodore-Alexander, and Oliver-Eugene.\n\nMichael Gibb: Born December 1, 1984\n\nMichael Gibb is the youngest son of Barry and Linda, whose godfather is none other than Michael Jackson, who he was named after.\n\nTaking a different career path to the majority of his siblings and cousins, Michael has acted in various low-budget movies.\n\nSnow Evelyn Robin Juliet Gibb: Born November 4, 2008\n\nRobin Gibb's fourth child Snow Evelyn Robin Juliet Gibb was born in somewhat controversial circumstances.\n\nLabelled his 'lovechild', Robin had an affair with his housekeeper Claire Yang for eight years, who later fell pregnant and gave birth in 2008.\n\nThe situation became complicated after his death, as Snow was written out of his will, with Spencer and Melissa each being given £500,000 immediately, with the remainder of the estate to be split between them and RJ upon Dwina's death.\n\nClaire Yang was reportedly allowed to keep the £850,000 house that Robin bought her in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, but otherwise, Snow will receive none of his £26 million fortune, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nA source speaking to the Sunday Mirror reneges those claims, saying that Gibb left Yang a reported $6.4 million payment right before his death to make sure that the little girl would be looked after.\n\nThe same source was quoted saying: \"Robin never walked away from his responsibilities and always made sure the child was fully provided for. Snow Robin is a Gibb child so will be treated exactly the same as the other three children.\"\n\nNick Endacott-Gibb: Born April 1968\n\nNick Endacott-Gibb was Maurice Gibb's first son with Patti Nolder, though was given up for adoption from birth.\n\nLater adopted by a middle-class family in East Sussex, Endacott-Gibb - who now resides in Brighton & Hove - began tracing his biological lineage in his 20s.\n\nInitially believing that he was the illegitimate son of a '60s rock band member, DNA proved otherwise in 2009.\n\nHaving met his biological mother Patti in 2003, it was her sister who insisted that Maurice Gibb was the father, though his widow Yvonne refused a DNA test.\n\nThat was until he realised Adam Gibb had submitted his DNA to the website Ancestry, which came back as a 100% match.\n\nThe Gibb family still refuse to acknowledge musician Nick Endacott-Gibb as one of their own, stating that his claims have torn the family apart.\n\nNick just wants closure however, saying: \"It has been such a long hard journey, but this has finally given me closure and I have a newfound belief in myself from knowing my identity.\"\n\n\"I've never been interested in money and as I was legally adopted I would have no claim anyway. I just wanted to know who my dad is.\""
