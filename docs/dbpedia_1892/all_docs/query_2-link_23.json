        "text": "The Malaysian government claims that Sarawak is being logged sustainably – but in fact its forests are being destroyed at one of the fastest rates in the world.\n\nAs the forests are logged, the rivers are silted up, killing the fish. The game is being scared deeper into the few remaining forests, and Penan hunters return home empty-handed.\n\nWhen the forests start to grow back, it is with thick scrub. The trails the Penan have walked for generations are gone.\n\nThe Malaysian logging companies, which include Samling, Interhill and Shin Yang, operate with the full backing of the state government.\n\nSome company workers have threatened the Penan with death if they continue to resist, and others are accused of raping Penan girls and women.\n\nIn areas where the big, old trees have all been taken, companies are clearing the remaining forest to make way for oil palm plantations (palm oil is used for biofuel and in many foods and cosmetics).\n\nThe plantations spell even greater problems for the Penan than the logging, because once the land is covered in oil palm, there is nothing left for them.\n\nWith the loss of their forests, the Penan are being forced into poverty, and are suffering from ill health due to poor diet and polluted water.\n\nDams\n\nIn 2008, a document was leaked on the internet revealing plans by the Sarawak government to build a series of twelve new hydroelectric dams, flooding many Penan and other indigenous villages.\n\nThe first of these, the Murum dam, was completed in December 2013. Members of the Penan tribe were forced to abandon their blockade against the dam and move into unfinished and sub-standard resettlement sites as rising waters threatened to flood their villages.\n\nThe dams are projected to produce far more electricity than Sarawak uses.\n\nWith the loss of their land, the Penan fear they will lose their independence. They know that other Penan who were resettled to make way for the existing Bakun dam are unable to hunt or gather, and find it difficult to grow enough food on the small plots of land provided for them. The resettled Penan have also struggled to pay the bills for water and electricity in their government-built homes.\n\nThe Penan\n\nThe hunter-gatherer Penan live in the rainforests of the interior of Sarawak, in the Malaysian part of the island of Borneo.\n\nTraditionally nomadic, most of the 10-12,000 Penan now live in settled communities, but continue to rely on the forest for their existence. Some still live largely nomadically.\n\nSarawak was ruled for more than a century as the personal kingdom of the ‘Brooke Rajahs’ after the arrival of Englishman James Brooke in 1839. It was handed over to the British in 1946 and was incorporated into Malaysia in 1963.\n\nThe Sarawak state government does not recognize the Penan’s rights to their land. Since the 1970s, it has backed large-scale commercial logging on tribal land across Sarawak.\n\nIn 1987, many Penan communities protested against the logging of their land by blockading the roads cut though the forest by the logging companies. More than a hundred Penan were arrested.\n\nThe Penan have kept up their resistance, and continue to mount blockades against the companies. Some have managed to prevent the companies from entering their land, but others have seen much of their forest devastated.\n\nWhere all of the valuable trees have been cut down, the companies have started to remove the forests completely in order to establish oil palm plantations.\n\nThe Sarawak government also plans to build new hydroelectric dams, flooding many villages belonging to Penan and other indigenous people.\n\nHow does Survival help?\n\nSurvival is urging the Malaysian authorities to recognize the Penan’s rights to their land, and to halt all logging, oil palm plantations, dam construction and other development on their land without their consent.\n\nHow do they live?\n\nUnlike the other indigenous peoples of Sarawak, who grow most of their food, the Penan are hunter-gatherers.\n\nFamous for the silent blowpipes and poison darts they use for hunting, the Penan particularly prize wild pigs.\n\nThey also hunt deer and smaller animals, and catch fish in the many rivers that flow through their land.\n\nSago is the Penan’s traditional staple food, and comes from the core of a small palm tree.\n\nThe Penan process it by trampling on it, and leave it in the sun to dry into a powder. They also gather ferns and fruit from the forest.\n\nMany of the more settled Penan have started to plant rice and other crops but continue to rely on the forest for most of their needs.\n\nIn areas where the forests have been cleared for logging and oil palm plantations, it is becoming almost impossible for the Penan to sustain themselves.\n\nJoin the mailing list\n\nMore than one hundred and fifty million men, women and children in over sixty countries live in tribal societies.
