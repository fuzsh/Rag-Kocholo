Today morning, when I was coming back from the gym, I stopped to buy some groceries & found a woman making rangoli outside the store. Before I came across her, I kind of forgot that today is Makar Sankranti. In my childhood, I heard stories about Holi, Rakhi, Janmashtami, Dussehra, & Diwali. But never about Makar Sankranti. So, I googled it & got to know these 5 significance of the festival: 1. Falling on the date of January 14 annually (January 15 on a leap year), Makar Sankranti marks the transition of the sun from the zodiac of Sagittarius (dhanu) to Capricorn (makara) and is observed to mark a new beginning. 2. According to Hindu scriptures, on the day of Makar Sankranti, Lord Vishnu defeated the terror wreaked by demons by cutting off their heads and burying them under a mountain, symbolizing the end of negativities while giving way to righteousness and good intentions. 3. For most parts of India, this period is a part of the early stages of the Rabi crop and agricultural cycle, where crops have been sown and the hard work in the fields is mostly over. As the farm animals play a huge role in harvesting, the following day is for them and is called Mattu Pongal. 4. This is a time to consume freshly harvested food grains, which are first offered to the Gods and then eaten. Cooking and eating Khichdi on this day is symbolic of unity (as it is prepared in a single pot by mixing all the ingredients). And, making sticky, bound sweets, particularly from sesame (til) and a sugar base such as jaggery (gud) is symbolic of purity, goodness & harmony. 5. Every 12 years, the Hindus observe Makar Sankranti with Kumbha Mela ‚Äì one of the world's largest mass pilgrimage, with an estimated crowd of 60 to 100 Mn people. Fascinating, right? The fun of celebrating a festival gets even more enjoyable when you discover the rich traditions and stories behind it. P.S.- Happy Makar Sankranti, y'all! Enjoy eating til ladoos and flying kites :) #festivities #traditionandculture #linkedin"
