A visa that has been granted is not a guarantee that the holder will be allowed to enter Malaysia. The final decision lies with the Immigration Officer at the entry point.\n\nRead more here for Visa requirement by Country.\n\nReturn Travel Ticket and Sufficient Funds\n\nA visitor is also required to present proof of his financial ability to finance his/her stay in Malaysia together with a confirmed return ticket to another destination.\n\nArrival/Departure Card (IMM.26)\n\nA visitor is required to complete the Arrival/Departure Card (Imm.26) upon arrival at the gazette entry points.
