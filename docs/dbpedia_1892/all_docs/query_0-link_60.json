        "text": "Category: Sarawak\n\nImagining a Eurasian History of Southeast Asia\n\nA few years ago someone I met in Kuching kindly gave me a cookbook that had just been published by the Sarawak Eurasian Association called Legacy Cookbook. This cookbook highlighted recipes from Eurasian families in Sarawak, and it also told the stories of their families. I was of course aware that one of the colonial […]\n\nCrossing Boundaries in 1930s-1940s Sarawak and England\n\nThe digitization of archival materials, newspapers, etc., is fantastic for researchers, but I also find it a bit frightening as there is undoubtedly information that is now freely available that some people perhaps wish wasn’t available for the world to see. So when I come across information about people whom I have never heard of, […]\n\nPua Kumbu and Digital Knowledge Mobilization\n\nOn a recent trip to Malaysia I visited an exhibition on Textile Tales of Pua Kumbu at the University of Malaya Art Gallery that really impressed me. Pua kumbu are textiles that are woven by the Iban people on the island of Borneo. (“Pua” is the Iban word for “blanket,” and “kumbu” means to wrap.) […]\n\nMaking Traditional Music Cool in Sarawak\n\nLamenting the loss of tradition is something that you hear all around the world, but there are some places that succeed in keeping the traditional world alive. The way they do that is by changing tradition to make it fit the contemporary world. This is easier for some places than others. In the case of […]\n\nJemadar Guptha, Loyal to the Empire and Beaten by the Japanese in World War II Sarawak\n\nIt is well known that after the Japanese occupied Southeast Asia in World War II, Indian nationalists formed something known as the “Indian National Army,” a military force that had the ultimate goal of freeing India from British rule. The formation of this army was a sign that there were plenty of Indians in the […]\n\nThe Dayang Muda “Puttin’ on the Ritz” in WWII Bombay\n\nIn looking around in the materials digitized by the Australian National Archives I came across a file called “Landing Permits Dayang Muda of Sarawak.” Sarawak, on the island of Borneo, was a kingdom ruled over by a British family, the Brooke family. The king was referred to as the “Rajah,” and the heir apparent was […]\n\nA British Haji in Sarawak and his England-Loving Malay Wife\n\nA few months ago I wrote a post about an Irishman who became a Buddhist monk in Burma in the early twentieth century, and who was known as U Dhammaloka. Recently I posted about a documentary that is being made about this man. One of the things that is fascinating about the story of U […]\n\nRemixing the Past: Murdered Chinese in 1900 Sarawak\n\nIn reading issues of the Sarawak Gazette from the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, I repeatedly come across references to Chinese either killing themselves or getting murdered. Life for Chinese laborers and merchants on Borneo at that time was clearly not easy, and many people’s lives were cut short for one reason or another. Just looking […]\n\nRemixing the Past: Of Pigs and Men in 1920s Sarawak\n\nPartly because I’ve been spending a lot of time in a forest that is inhabited by wild boars, and partly because sometimes when I’m out there I think about some essays that Jonathan Saha posted on his blog this summer about animals, I’ve been thinking about animals and how viewing the past from an “animal […]"
