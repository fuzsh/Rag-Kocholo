        "text": "The jungle-clad region of Sarawak on the island of Borneo is a destination made for adventure, from exploring prehistoric cave dwellings to spotting colonies of orangutans.\n\nFrom durian flowers to bamboo chicken, the traditional dishes of Malaysiaâ€™s largest region are being championed by a new generation of chefs and restaurateurs. Meet the people behind the resurgence in the Sarawakian cuisine.\n\nBeing able to witness orangutans swinging through the canopies of Semenggoh Wildlife Centre is a magnificent privilege. Take a journey to the heart of Sarawak to see how these charismatic great apes are protected.\n\nLocated deep within Malaysia's island region of Borneo is Niah National Park, home to lush rainforest, famous archaeological findings, and a significant cave network. This visual journey delves into the ancient marvels that make this park worth visiting.\n\nKuching's cuisine is said to be the best-kept secret in Asia, but perhaps not for much longer. This visual journey showcases the distinct and exciting fusion of flavours that can be found throughout the city, born from the rich cultural diversity and traditions of the region."
