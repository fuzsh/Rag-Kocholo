        "text": "Sarawak, the Land of the Hornbills, is the largest state in Malaysia, with an area almost equal to that of Peninsular Malaysia. Strategically located in the island of Borneo, Sarawak is bordered by the Malaysian state of Sabah, the Indonesian Kalimantan, and Brunei. Sarawak has an equatorial climate with lush tropical rainforests, an abundance of animal and plant species, and a wealth of natural wonders such as the prominent cave systems at Gunung Mulu National Park and the Rejang River, the longest river in Malaysia. It is home to 31 ethnic groups, Sarawak is a unique plethora of culture, adventure, nature, food, and festivals (CANFF). It is the place where the journey of endless exploration starts.\n\nKuching – was the administrative capital throughout the times of the Brunei sultanate, the White Rajahs of Sarawak, and during the British Colonial rule before Sarawak joined the Malaysian Federation in 1963. The rich history of the city is showcased throughout Kuching, as you can see various historical landmarks such as the Old Court House, the Astana, and Fort Margherita, dotted along the city’s landscapes, telling tales of long ago that are still being passed down from generation to generation.\n\n(Source: https://sarawaktourism.com/)"
