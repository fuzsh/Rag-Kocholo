        "text": "Version 6: Kuching name is from a local fruit\n\nThe name “Kuching” could have come from the local fruit known as “Mata Kucing“. The fruit was found to be growing abundantly atop the hill know as Bukit Mata Kucing behind the Chinese Tua Pek Kong Temple. Locally, the fruit is known as Isau or Green Longan while its botanical name is Dimocarpus Longan, spp.malesianus, var malesianus and it belongs to the family of sap indaccae. It is a true tropical Longan that is only found in Sarawak. It belongs to the group of fruit with the vernacular name of Mata Kucing which also includes Sau, Kakus and Guring fruits. Mata Kucing trees were grown wildly around Sungai Kuching in the olden days. The fruit is spherical in shape, dark green in colour with numerous protuberances on its skin surface. Mata Kucing‘s color changes from dark green to light yellowish green as it ripens. The flesh is translucent, crispy and sweet.\n\nSo which version is likely to be true?\n\nThe case for Kuching’s name is believed to be more likely named after Sungai Kuching which was within the vicinity of Bukit Mata Kuching, which bore a lot of “Mata Kucing” fruits in the olden days. The existence of Sungai Kuching and an inland wharf was proven with the discovery of 280 pieces of old coins backdated to the 16th century at the former Rex Theatre demolition site at Temple Street Kuching in 1995. Thus, “Kuching” may not actually mean “cat” and unlikely to have anything to do with cats but more to do with the name of Sungai Kuching or the from the local fruit Mata Kucing.\n\nKuching name has been used long before James Brooke\n\nLooking back in history, the name “Kuching” actually predated the rule of James Brooke. It has been called so during the Brunei rule. This could be proven in James Brooke’s private letter to his mother on 14.9.1841 where he used the word “Kuchin” with a note stating that “Kuchin” was the native name of Sarawak. The name “Kuchin” was however dropped and only Sarawak was used in another letter to his mother dated 26.3.1842. On 12.8.1872, in the Supreme Council meeting, the second White Rajah of Sarawak , Sir Charles Brooke reverted to the name of “Sarawak” in place of “Kuching” even though at that time, Sarawak was the name of the capital and the river which flows through it as well as the territory of Sarawak. This was because he wanted to define the township of Sarawak by a more positive appellation. From then onward, Kuching became the name of the town and the name Sarawak was used to represent the whole territory, according to Sarawak Gazette No.47 dated 16.8.1972)"
