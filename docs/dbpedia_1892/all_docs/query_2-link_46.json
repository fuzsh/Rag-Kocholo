Among the major changes in the new state was the change of name from North Borneo to Sabah (Fig. 1). The term “North Borneo” had been used since the setting up of the British North Borneo Company administration in 1879, when the Provisional Association of North Borneo Company was established. From that time, the newly constituted territory was known as North Borneo (Borneo Utara in Malay), designating the northern region of the state on the island of Borneo. Its people were called North Borneans; and a flag was designed along with a coat of arms. In 1963, this new name of Sabah, a new flag and a new coat of arms marked the beginning of an era when the state and its people assumed a new identity, and thus began a period of adjusting to the notion of being citizens of the new Federation of Malaysia as well as the new identity of being a Sabahan (vis-à-vis a North Bornean). Yet, the name of Sabah is not new; neither was the effort to foster a new identity of Sabahan. This paper will look at the provenance of the name “Sabah,” and how this old name was given a new interpretation and meaning at the time when the state was heading for independence. The paper will then turn its attention to the efforts to foster and sustain this Sabah identity after 1963; and its relation to the national identity of being a Malaysian.\n\nThe Provenance of the Name “Sabah”\n\n2There have been several suggestions about the origins of the name “Sabah.” In one of the earliest historical documents signed between the rulers of the territories that would become North Borneo, the title of “Maharaja of Sabak” was conferred on Baron Gustave von Overbeck in 1877 by Sultan Abdul Mumin of Brunei. The term “Sabak” was found in the Jawi version of the appointment, whereas “Sabah” was used in the English translation of the appointment of Baron von Overbeck as Rajah of Gaya and Sandakan and Maharajah of Sabah on 29 November 1877. Baron von Overbeck was a former Austrian Consul in Shanghai who took over the original concession of the territory that constitutes most of present-day Sabah, and who attracted British interest through the trading house of the Dent Brothers (Alfred and Edward Dent) of London. It was the Dent Brothers who went on to obtain British endorsement for their establishment of a government in North Borneo, which came in the form of a royal charter and which eventually led to the establishment of the North Borneo Company rule over the territory.\n\n14 Maxwell, The Origin of the Name “Sabah”, pp.94–95.\n\nThus if we were to orientate ourselves at a point along the Brunei River, below the bend between Pulau Ambuk and Pulau Sibungur, where it curves sharply upstream to Bandar Seri Begawan, the direction ‘Saba’ would designate a more or less straight course to the Island of Muara Besar, across Brunei Bay, over the Klias Peninsula, and continuing on roughly parallel to the whole northwest coast of Sabah.\n\n9In relation to this, Maxwell simply put “Sabah” as “north”—in this case, the northern part of Borneo.\n\n10All these suggestions, whether plausible or mere fanciful, seemed to indicate that “Sabah” is a very old local Malay name, one used by the natives—either indigenous or Brunei Malay—referring to the northwest coast of Borneo, north of Brunei, and northern Brunei. Thus, when the North Borneo Company took over, the local name of the territory was “Sabah”, at least for the western part.\n\n13The notion of Sabah being referred to as direction is also alluded to by Sultan Muhammad kanzul Alam of Brunei when he wrote to Farquhar in Singapore in July 1821:\n\n17 Letter from Sultan Muhammad Kanzul Alam of Brunei to Farquhar, 8 July 1821. Wbrn 8:3. Warkah Brunei (...)\n\n[… ] Sultan Muhammad Kanzul Alam negeri Brunei. Wabadahu daripada itu barang takrif kiranya sahabat beta maka adalah beta melayangkan warkat yang aziz yang dilayangkan angin nasîm al-sabâh ini tiadalah dengan sempurnanya daripada akan jadi ganti beta bersambutan kalam al-ihsan dengan sahabat beta saja, serta menyatakan tulus dan ikhlas di dalam cermin kertas […].\n\n14Logically, the expression angin nasīm al-sabāh would refer to a specific wind, because in Arabic, nasîm ميسis “breeze, zephyr,” whereas al-sabāh is not a borrowing from the Arabic (the meaning of هاب is quite different). So the above expression would mean “breeze called sabah”, perhaps “breeze from downstream” or “sea breeze”. While these interpretations are pure guesses, it nonetheless concurs with the idea that the term “Sabah” or “al-Sabah,” actually refers to a certain direction—and in this case, more likely to be heading toward northeast.\n\n16There are also suggestions that the term “Sabah” could have a Filipino origin. While both Tagalog and Visayan languages have the word “Sabah” in their vocabulary, they however carry meanings that do not refer to a place name. Rather, the name “Saba” refers to a variety of banana in both Tagalog and Visayan, whereas the same word in Visayan refers to “noisy.”\n\n18Thus far, discussion on the origins of the name “Sabah” have been focusing on two broad areas, namely, the way the state, especially the West Coast, being referred to, either as a direction, in this case, from Brunei, or as a wind direction. The second area refers to a similar name being found in other places, but essentially referring to something else. Yet, for the local people, the name “Sabah” was perhaps known only to those who were residing on the West Coast of the state, especially those linked to Brunei. Despite its unclear and contestable origin, the name began to gain ascendency during the rule of the British North Borneo Company.\n\nThe British North Borneo Company’s Sabah\n\n20The first issue of the Herald of 1 March 1883 included the name of the pioneering plantation company, China-Sabah Plantation Company. In the same issue, an official notice was issued:\n\n(Source: British North Borneo Herald, 1 March 1883)\n\n26In 1910, some Dusun (present-day Kadazandusun community) from Papar submitted a petition to Governor Sir John Anderson, who was also British Agent for British North Borneo, expressing their grievances about the loss of land to rubber companies and the railway. While the petition was written in Malay, it was translated into English. The original is no longer available. However, the original Malay version of subsequent petitions that were submitted in August 1912 survived. There were four separate petitions submitted by Dusun from Membakut, Bongawan, and Papar (two). Interestingly, the word “Sabah” was used in three of them to refer to the state, and used intermittently with the term “North Borneo”:\n\nPetition from Membakut:\n\nFasal ini perintah Sabah selalu mau bikin susa sama kami orang kampong\n\n(Translation: Because this Sabah Government always creates trouble for us villagers)\n\nSaya orang negeri tida buleh tahan lagi di dalam ini negeri Membakut. Sebab ini perintah Sabah punya okom (Hukum) tida patut di dalam ini pulau British North Borneo\n\n(Translation: We the people of this state can no longer bear it in the state of Membakut. Because the law of the Sabah Government is unjust in this island of British North Borneo)\n\nPetition from Bongawan:\n\nSahaya Batindam dan Yanggar dan Sogara Dusun Bongawan di dalam Pulau British North Borneo Compani Sabah\n\n(Translation: We, Batindam, Yanggar and Sogara, Dusun from Bongawan in the island of British North Borneo, Sabah Company)\n\nIni perintah Sabah, dia ambil saya orang Dusun punya nenek moyang punya tanah, …\n\n(Translation: This Sabah Government, took the land of the ancestors of us the Dusun)\n\nPetition from Papar:\n\n33 Petitions from Membakut, Bongawan and Papar to Sir John Anderson, High Commissioner in Singapore ov (...)\n\nSekarang ini tana di jual oleh Tuan perintah Sabah kepada Tuan Kabun gata\n\n(Translation: Now this land is being sold to the owner of the rubber estate by the Government of Sabah)\n\nSaya orang tida buleh tahan lagi ini sekarang, di dalam ini pigangan Compani Sabah, British North Borneo\n\n(Translation: We cannot stand it any more, in this land that’s ruled (held) by the Sabah Company, British North Borneo)\n\n27This is the only written evidence we have of the pre-war usage of the term “Sabah” by locals, which in this case refers to both the state of Sabah, as well as being associated with the name of the North Borneo Company, as in Compani Sabah. But apart from this fragmentary information, we have no further evidence to suggest that the term “Sabah” had been used.\n\n29With the name getting rare in the public sphere, it is a wonder that its existence was kept alive and sustained by the local population. There is no clear indication on how the name has survived through the days of the Chartered Company rule and the war. What is obvious is that the usage of the name had been discouraged in the official sphere, which also included the North Borneo Herald. But somehow, after the war the name was brought back into the public sphere almost effortlessly. And it was later accepted as the preferred name for the new state.\n\n30There is also another more fundamental question—was the general public actually conscious of the name “Sabah,” or was its usage confined to a certain region, in this case, the west coast of the state? Then was it also the efforts of merely a few individuals who had kept the idea alive and who took the trouble to promote it as the new name of the state? If that is so, what then were the motives behind such a move?\n\nThe Colonial Era and the Name of Sabah\n\n31When the war ended in 1945, North Borneo underwent a transition from the rule of a Chartered Company (The North Borneo Company) to the Colonial Office. The declaration made on 15 July 1946 named the territory of North Borneo a Crown Colony. Even though the name “Sabah” was not used officially as the name of the state, it was during this period that it began to gain ascendency and, perhaps, acceptance. The effort, however, came from various, somehow uncoordinated, initiatives.\n\nurging Colonial Government to establish Public relations or Information Offices for the purpose of disseminating the British Government’s views and attitudes in the complex attitude of growing world opinion towards Colonial territories and their governments.\n\n35It must be said that together, these two institutions were instrumental in bringing back the name of “Sabah” to the general public. Perhaps the issue here is less of “bringing back” or “revive,” and more of introducing the name of “Sabah” to a public who was used to the name of British North Borneo or North Borneo.\n\n36If the North Borneo News and Sabah Times was reaching out to the adult readers, there was another effort actually reaching out to the young people of North Borneo. In 1956, it fell upon Ronald Brooks, the Chief Information Officer, to start a newspaper or newsmagazine called Anak Sabah, with the target group being young people of North Borneo. According to Brooks,\n\n40 Brooks, Under Five Flags, p.198.\n\nIn May [1956] the first number of Anak Sabah, a monthly newspaper in English designed to interest adolescents, particularly those still at school, was produced. It aimed at helping young readers to improve their English, to take an interest in their country and the activities of their fellows, and at encouraging young people to write, particularly about Borneo. A circulation of about 1,000 was originally anticipated, but the paper was received with enthusiasm, particularly in schools, and the circulation rose rapidly to 2,500 and has been maintained at that level.\n\n37Anak Sabah was produced from 1956 to 1966. During this ten-year period many young people were unconsciously being exposed to the name of “Sabah,” and began to associate North Borneo with Sabah. This was an important development considering that Anak Sabah was a government publication. More importantly, the publication helped to reinforce the use of the name “Sabah” amongst the younger generation of North Bornean as “Anak Sabah”means “Children of Sabah.” This was yet another strong endorsement from a colonial administration that was increasingly conscious of the changing atmosphere of Britain heading towards decolonization.\n\n39It was clear that the three initiatives of Radio Sabah, Anak Sabah and Radio Sabah Calling did much to cultivate the name of “Sabah” amongst the people of North Borneo during that time. It was also an indication of the beginning of the forging of a new identity for the people of North Borneo. Instead of calling themselves North Bornean, they were encouraged to use the new name of “Sabahan.”\n\n43 Edge-Granville, The Sabahan, p.105.\n\nthe name of North Borneo was ‘not only cumbersome but gave the impression that it was a promontory or lighthouse and of use only to the mariners. Being a West Coast boy, he was enamoured of the old accepted name for west coast, Sabah.\n\n41Now, where did Donald Stephens conjure up the idea that the name “Sabah” was an old accepted name for “west coast?” Perhaps it was true that the name could have lingered on in the minds of many on the west coast, but was not popularly used. The only printed evidence would be the petitions of the Dusun from Membakut, Bongawan and Papar back in 1912, as mentioned earlier. But perhaps it could also be that the name was only stuck in the imagination of some individuals. However, it was these individuals who were able to make a difference and had their views expressed and heard. Certainly, Donald Stephens was one such person.\n\n42The efforts by Stephens to champion for the change of name was frowned upon by Governor Turnbull and other officials who wanted to reduce its significance or usage—giving reason of usage—targeting Government officials who decided otherwise. But Stephens’ opportunity came when the Malaysia idea was floated and when North Borneo was destined to be part of this new federation. Once again, Donald Stephens put forward the suggestion.\n\n43P.J. Rivers relates how Donald Stephens came to put the name forward. Apparently, it was at the suggestion of K.G. Tregonning, who later became the Raffles Professor of History at the University of Malaya at Singapore. Tregonning was in correspondence with Donald Stephens at a time when\n\n44 P.J. Rivers, The Origins of Sabah and a Reappraisal of Overbeck as Maharajah, Journal of the Malays (...)\n\nthere was a tendency to foster a local identity and not only among the locals. Indeed, when North Borneo was nearer to merger with Malaya, Professor Tregonning wrote to Donald Stephens, who by then was already a leading voice of the people, and suggested the elimination of colonial non-indigenous names for those towns named by the (North Borneo) Company, and indeed for the state itself. “Sabah was a suggestion of mine,” he said.\n\n44But Tregonning’s assertion perhaps neglects the fact that Donald Stephens started to champion for the name of Sabah several years before the idea of Malaysia was even floated. Furthermore, his Sabah Times also started during the early 1950s.\n\n45Following the announcement of the Malaysia proposal by Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Prime Minister of Malaya, in May 1961, there was an urgency in North Borneo for the formation of political parties. It is interesting to note that in this regard the use of “Sabah” in the name of the political parties was accepted. For instance, the United Sabah National Organisation (USNO).\n\n46Following the negotiations that took place in the Inter-Governmental Committee (IGC), the name of the state of North Borneo was finally accepted as “Sabah”, and in the report of the IGC, this became one of the Twenty Points —the name of the state was “Sabah.” The Twenty Points were items agreed to safeguard the interests of the locals agreed upon in the pre-independence Inter-Governmental Committee negotiations. In the Malaysia Agreement signed in July 1963, the name of the state of North Borneo is given as “Sabah”, and a separate State Constitution for Sabah was also agreed upon. Thus with the name firmly inscribed in the two utmost important documents that define the nature and rights of the states, the name became the permanent feature of the state that is now known as Sabah.\n\nEmbracing the New Identity in the New Nation\n\n47The previous section tries to explain how the name of Sabah was reintroduced as the new name of the new state, replacing the colonial name of North Borneo. This section will look at how this term was being embraced by the very people for whom it was decided upon by those who were in the position of authority. However, for the next fifty years, from 1963 until 2013, reaction has been mixed. On one hand, the people of Sabah have no issue with being known as ‘Sabahan’; in fact they are extremely proud of it. Some probably have no qualms in introducing themselves first as Sabahan and then as Malaysian. For many, it is the second part which created perceptions which continue to divide opinions and positions.\n\n48When Sabah was granted self-government by Britain on 31 August 1963, there was a small article in the Sabah Times entitled “Sabah Athletes Bag 6 Golds,” highlighting the Sabah athletes’ achievements in the first triangular international in Singapore.\n\n45 Sabah Times, 3 September 1963.\n\nSabah stars competing with “Sabah” emblazoned across their chests and with new National Flag [italic mine] fluttering among the Malayan and Singapore national colours under a bright sky at the Farrer Park Stadium put up an excellent show.\n\n49The emphasis here was the new name of the state, Sabah, and that it was a new state with its own national colours! Such coverage in the news would definitely have had some bearing on the way the people in this new state were looking at themselves—an independent state with its own national colours, at least during that sixteen days leading up to 16 September 1963.\n\n50When the State Anthem was played and sung for the first time, the lyrics again are reflective of a mood that provided much room for imagination:\n\nSabah Tanah Air-Ku\n\nNegeri Kita Yang Tercinta\n\nPemuda-Pemudi,\n\nSemua Marilah\n\nBangunlah Bersatu Semua\n\nMarilah Bersama serta Maju Jaya\n\nMerdeka Sepanjang Masa\n\nBersatu Sekarang Bangsa Sentosa\n\nSabah Negeri Merdeka\n\n51Translation:\n\nSabah, My Homeland\n\nOur Beloved State\n\nYoung Men and Women, Come\n\nArise All Together\n\nJoin Together and be Successful\n\nIndependent Forever\n\nUnite All, and the Nation Prospers and Peaceful\n\nSabah, the Independent State\n\n52The reiteration of the word “Negeri Merdeka” (Independent State) probably provided ideas and notions that North Borneo was granted independence before joining Malaysia. Indeed, this has been a point of contention for many who felt that Sabah formed one of the four components in the new federation— Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak and Sabah. Whereas, the Malaysia Agreement actually spells out the states of the Federation as:\n\n46 Malaysia: Agreement Concluded between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the (...)\n\nThe States of Malaya, namely, Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Perlis, Selangor and Trengganu; and\n\nThe Borneo States, namely, Sabah and Sarawak; and\n\nThe State of Singapore\n\n53In many ways, the identity of the state of Sabah and its people depended much on how they perceived their relationship with the federation or within the federation. The idea of being a “Sabahan” vis-à-vis of “Malaysian” has been in existence for as long as the new federation. Many continue to question the perceived loss of state rights or erosion of them as a result of the actions of the federal government. Much attention has been given to the Twenty Points. Questions have been raised as to why some of the points have been surrendered or abolished.\n\n54Others raise questions about how Sabahans were wrongly perceived. For instance, statements and questions uttered by West Malaysians to Sabahans, such as “Do you live on trees?,” “Welcome to Malaysia,” “All Malaysia, including Sabah and Sarawak,” “Your money is bigger than ours?” etc. All these, coupled with those state rights issues raised by political parties, form part of the grievances that cloud the federal—state relations—and in the process, add a burden to the notion of being a Sabahan or being a Malaysian.\n\n55Various mechanisms and efforts have been used to try to address such perceived divides. The recruitment of Sabahans into the Malaysian civil service, the Royal Malaysian Police Force, and the Malaysian Armed Forces, the setting up of the Universiti Malaysia Sabah, which receives a sizeable number of West Malaysian students. Likewise, many Sabah students studying in universities in West Malaysia, have probably helped to reduce the misconceptions about one another while, at the same time, improving personal ties. Many marriages have also taken place between Sabahans and West Malaysians (and Sarawakians). There have also been efforts from the commercial sector, including the Ferry Malaysia, launched in 1986, which was a cruise ship named “Cruise Muhibbah” (Friendship Cruise), plying the major ports of Sabah, Sarawak and Peninsular Malaysia. The national carrier, Malaysia Airlines, has been in operation since 1963 (earlier known as Malayan Airways Limited from 1947–1972) and has, in some ways, helped to foster relationships between the two sides of the divide. More recently, the introduction of the budget airline AirAsia in 1996 has changed the human-to-human ties between Sabah and West Malaysia quite dramatically. Its publicity slogan of “Everyone Can Fly” and its no-frills competitive fares have certainly allowed more people from both sides to move between the two regions and, therefore, get to know each other better.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\n57This paper sets out to look at the origins of the name of Sabah and how this name was sustained over different eras to become the name of the new state of Sabah within the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. The idea of having an original name referring to the territory that became Sabah was championed by certain quarters during the colonial era to the point that the name eventually became the official name of the state. The last part of this paper looks into the way Sabahans looked at their state identity vis-à-vis their brethren from the Malay Peninsula and Sarawak. This paper concludes that even though the identity of being a Sabahan was readily embraced by the people in Sabah after 1963, there are definitely different notions about how and what it should be. In a way, this exercise of trying to trace the origins of the name of Sabah and how it is being adapted in the larger sense of the Malaysian nation is yet another way of embracing or understanding the notion of being a Sabahan."
