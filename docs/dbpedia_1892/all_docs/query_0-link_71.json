        "text": "History of Sarawak Day\n\nIn 1841, the Sultanate of Brunei passed on power over the Raj of Sarawak to the British Brooke Dynasty. Sarawak was recognized as a sovereign nation by the United States and the British, becoming a British protectorate. Towards the end of the Second World War, Sarawak was administered by the British Military for a short period before becoming a full-fledged Crown Colony in 1946. Sarawak was then handed over to the British Crown by the Brookes. This transfer, and resulting demotion to the state of a colony, was met by major protests from the Sarawakian people, who demanded independence. Rosli Dhobi, a revolutionary, subsequently assassinated the second governor of Sarawak, Duncan Stewart. Dhobi was tried and hanged for the act. Stewart was succeeded by Anthony Abell.\n\nThe Cobbold Commission, of which Abell was a part, eventually granted Sarawak de facto statehood on the condition that the state should join the Federation of Malaysia in September 1963. Before leaving the state, Alexander Waddel, the Governor of the state, handed power over to the first Sarawakian Chief Minister, Stephen Kalong Ningkan, along with the new members of the Supreme Council.\n\nIn 2016, July 22 was officially announced as a public holiday, known as ‘Sarawak Independence Day,’ under the purview of Chief Minister Adenan Satem. Today, the holiday is a reminder of Sarawak’s long-standing brush with the British and the eventual attainment of its own statehood."
