This particular data is focused on Sarawak in Malaysia\n\nSampling\n\nBats were captured using mist nets and harp traps and, then released after reference calls were taken using a digital audio recorder.\n\nQuality Control\n\nThe data were first assembled in a standard form designed for the Asian Bat Call Database (ABCD).The contributor(s) has been trained via a workshop fund by a GBIF-BIFA grant to use controlled language for data entry. The contents and format have been reviewed by the BIFA04-24 project investigator, Dr. Joe Chun-Chia Huang, and the ABCD manager, Dr. Tamas Golfol, under the supervision of Dr. Gabor Csorba from Hungarian Natural History Museum and Dr. Tigga Kingston from Southeast Asian Bat Conservation and Research Unit. The taxonomy of the species records has been carefully reviewed by Dr. Gabor Csorba which is very experienced of bat taxonomy in Asia. After all reviews and data cleaning, the data is migrated and reformatted using Darwin Core with support from the help desk (Miss Melissa Liu) of Taibif."
