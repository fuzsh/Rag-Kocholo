        "text": "KUCHING: Luck must have been on her side from the very beginning for Ashley Wang Sze Mei, who is the winner of state-level RHB New Straits Times National Spell-It-Right (SIR) Challenge 2015 for the secondary school category.\n\nThe Form Five student of SMK Jalan Arang was the first out of 93 contestants, whom had battle it out for the number one spot during the competition, which was held at the Hills Shopping Mall here on Sunday.\n\nIt was a smooth sail to victory for Ashley when she correctly spelled “Hypnopompic” during the final round of the challenge before clinching the winner title with her winning word “Discombobulate” in a tie-breaker round to determine the three top spellers from the state.\n\nWhen met after the competition, the eldest of two sisters, said her experience entering the SIR challenge last year, where she was named as one of the five consolation prize winners, had helped her to prepare for this year’s challenge.\n\n“Like any other contestants, I do hope that I could do well during the challenge. However, it had never crossed my mind that I would become the winner for the competition.\n\n“I am truly overwhelmed. And now with the prize money, I will save it to fund my education at the tertiary level,” said Ashley, who aspires to become a graphic designer.\n\nAshley won RM3,000 and she will represent Sarawak at the national finals at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre in October.\n\nHer win was also a surprise to her 50-year-old mother Audrey Tan Li Hung who came to the event to show her support with Ashley’s younger sister, Kelly Wang Sze Qing, 12.\n\n“I am happy when she secured a place in the final round of the competition. I am even happier after she was announced as the state champion for the challenge.\n\n“It has been a lucky year for my daughter. Last month, Ashley won the gold prize during this year’s Euroasia Violin Competition for the youth category,” said the housewife, adding that she was proud of her daughter’s achievement.\n\nIt was a neck-to-neck battle between Natalie Ko Wei Qing of SMK Green Road and Wong Huiyi of Chung Hua Middle School (1) during another tie-breaker round to determine the second and third place winner.\n\nAfter enduring more than three rounds of figuring out the right spelling for difficult words including “Grandiloquence”, “Lignicolous” and “Cataphract”, the first runner-up spot finally won by Natalie when the Form Four student correctly spelled “brasserie” to win RM2,500. Huiyi walked away with RM2,000.\n\nIsaac Chung De Wei of SMK Batu Lintang scored the fourth place and won RM1,500 after he spelled the word “Reconnoiter” in less than 15 seconds. The fifth prize winner was Ashley Loh Siew Ting who won RM1,000.\n\nFive contestants won the RM200 consolation prize. They included Awang Khairul Nizzam Awang Azzahari (SMK Semerah Padi), Myra Ng Sze Huu (SMK D P H Abdul Gapor (Integ)), and Lancelan Pegan Roland Sagah (SMK ST Thomas). Also won consolation prizes were schoolmates Stephanie Ting Xiu Hui and Trisha Jane Webley Janung from SMK ST Mary (M).\n\nJalan Kulas RHB Bank Branch Manager, Wong Kee Toh, and Media Prima Bhd group corporate governance senior executive, Mohd Fhairuz Bakhtiar, handed the prizes to winners."
