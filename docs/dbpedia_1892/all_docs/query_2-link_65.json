        "text": "Someone asked on the comment box which I copied Nazri: kn betanya, kenapa nama ejaan Brunei B.R.U.N.E.I? Sedangkan sebutannya BRUNAI? nda pernah ku tejumpa mana-mana ejaan yang berakhir dengan E.I disebut \"ai\".\n\nNazri brought up an interesting point. When did 'Brunei' became Brunei?\n\nI will ignore the old Chinese reports which used various names such as Poli and Poni and concentrates on the word closer in sound to Brunei. Though the final word that the Chinese used was 'Boni' which in fact until today is still being used as the signage at Sultan Majid Hassan's tomb in China. This is the cover of my second book currently on sale which shows the sign of King of Boni:-\n\nGoing back further in time, most of the Dutch and Spanish documents spelt Brunei as 'Borney' or 'Borneo'. One letter from the Sultan of Brunei to Governor Tello in Manila reported the use of 'Burney'.\n\nMost European old maps dating to the 17th and 18th century would refer to Brunei as Borneo Proper while the island is also called Borneo. One Portuguese report in 1610 used the word 'Borneu' and another in 1524 wrote of 'Burneo'. In another book written by Masimilian of Transyvania wrote of the the 'island of Porne'. Pigafetta, travelling with Magelan used 'Burney' but also Burne. A book published in Venetia in 1550 spelt Bornei.\n\nHowever the use of Brunei became more apparent in the later 19th and early 20th centyury, In practically all the agreements that we signed in the 19th century, Brunei was written in Jawi and only when we anglicised it, it became Brunei.\n\nI have an old book written by someone called Treacher. It was printed in 1891 and the title of the book was Sketches of Brunai, Labuan, Sarawak and North Borneo. He was a former governor of Labuan and obviously knew Brunei very well. His spelling of Brunai was probably 'accurate' compared to Brunei which we used today.\n\nAnother book which I owned is written by Frank Maryatt who in his book entitled Borneo and the Indian Archipelago published in 1848 spelt Brunei as Bruni.\n\nBy 1904 when McArthur came to Brunei, he used Brunei throughout his report. It is most likely that it was the British that finalised the word Brunei as Brunei of today.\n\nPeter Blundell writing in his book 'A City of Many Waters' published in 1923 but writing about Brunei at the end of the 19th century wrote about 'Brunei'.\n\nThough interestingly enough, there were books published in the 1950s and 1960s which tried to spell Brunei as it is sounded. One in particular was written by Yura Halim and Jamil Umar published in 1958 entitled 'Sejarah Berunai' which spelt Brunei as Berunai. In fact, in the book there is a foreword by Sultan Haji Omar Ali who used the word Berunai throughout the foreword and signed it with Sultan of Berunai.\n\nAgain interestingly enough Yura Halim in an earlier book written in 1951 spelt Brunei as Brunei and Sultan Omar Ali who also wrote the foreword wrote as Sultan Brunei. But by the 1960s, Brunei was well on its way to being established as 'Brunei'.\n\nPS. I have decided to do a proper research and expand this entry into a proper article. I have submitted it to my editors and this will be published hopefully tomorrow in the Brunei Times Sunday edition.\n\nBrunei Royal Wedding 2015: Profile of Royal Bride Dayangku Raabi'atul Adawiyyah\n\nDAYANGKU RAABI'ATUL ADAWIYYAH BINTI PENGIRAN HAJI BOLKIAH Yang Mulia Dayangku Raabi'atul `Adawiyyah binti Pengiran Haji Bolkiah was born on the 27th October 1992.

I enjoyed what she wrote and I offered for her to write a whole blog about it and I will put it up. But up to now, I have not received anything from her. So, Hajah Yati, if you are reading, my offer still stands. And for the rest of you readers out there, if you don't have your own blogsite, I am most ready to offer my site for the occassional blogs that you want to write - just make sure the blogs are Brunei related. You can set up your own blogsite once you feel comfortable. As someone later on commented, it will be nice to read someone else's blogs too on this website. At least on this one, you get an instant 300+ readers a day. So, please, my e-mail is admin@bruneiresources.com. Do write. I don't have much on nicknames to write on as suggested by Hajah Yati.

Pulau Cermin as many Brunei historians know it is the site of the temporary palace of Sultan Abdul Hakkul Mubin, the 13th Sultan of Brunei and is the site of the only civil war in Brunei History. Sultan Abdul Hakkul Mubin took the throne after assasinating Sultan Muhammad Ali. It was quite a bloody time in Brunei history and I remembered one classic book written by Yura Halim entitled \"Mahkota Berdarah\" regarding the episode. Pulau Cermin - view from the River In a nutshell, Sultan Abdul Hakkul Mubin was the Bendahara when his son was killed by the son of Sultan Muhammad Ali. He requested that his son's death be avenged but Sultan Muhammad Ali denied him. So Bendahara Abdul Mubin went amok killing a few people at the palace and with his followers took the Sultan and killed him (No"
