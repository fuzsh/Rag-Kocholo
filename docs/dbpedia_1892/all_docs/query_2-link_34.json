This document provides the marking scheme for the English language component of the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) trial exam for District Lawas in 2017. It outlines the criteria for assessing students' performance in Section A (Directed Writing) and Section B (Continuous Writing). For Directed Writing, marks are awarded based on format, content, language use, and structure. Student responses are assigned a band and corresponding mark range based on the description of language accuracy, variety, spelling, punctuation, organization, and tone. Guidelines are also provided on assessing Continuous Writing responses based on overall impression while noting errors. Examiners are instructed to carefully read responses multiple times while underlining errors to apply the appropriate mark.",
