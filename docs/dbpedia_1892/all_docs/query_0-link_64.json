        "text": "About the book\n\nFew places on Earth can be as exciting and diverse in their offering of nature as is Sarawak, Malaysia’s largest state. Occupying a biologically and geologically very rich portion of northwest Borneo, Sarawak is undoubtedly one of the world’s great places for species, wilderness and landscapes. A natural magnet for all interested in tropical forests and their exuberant life – including a fine retinue of the most serious naturalists, scholars and adventurers – Sarawak boasts an immensely impressive range of wildlife and flora, and is synonymous with our spontaneous inclinations in nature and discovery. For the first time, presented in this book, is an account of where the magnificent nature of Sarawak is safeguarded for posterity: the national parks, where gigantic flowers. towering trees, mysterious caves, serene tropical streams and the most unimaginable variety (and yet, perhaps, secretive) of animal abound. And, finally, to the rejoice of travellers, biologists and all who are after natural history of the most surprising and spellbinding quality, here is a book full of interesting and practical information, images of the most enthralling form, and inspiration for the careful conservation of life and heritage. Sarawak, the Land of the Hornbills, has some of the most captivating national parks one can ever experience."
