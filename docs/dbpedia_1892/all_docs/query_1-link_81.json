        "text": "Kolo mee is a dry noodle dish that’s the signature offering of Kuching, the capital of Sarawak.\n\nSarawak laksa, another Kuching creation, is more well-known, thanks to rave reviews from the likes of the late, great Anthony Bourdain. However, kolo mee is considered an affordable staple dish that can be eaten every day.\n\nIt can now be found all across the Borneon state, as well as peninsular Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore.\n\nA Hakka creation\n\nKolo mee is believed to have been derived from Hakka mee, or at least its precursor.\n\nOne of the early pioneers of this dish was Kiew Shao Nyap, a Hakka immigrant from Guangdong, China who migrated to Kuching in the 1920s.\n\nSetting up shop at 44 Upper China Street, he first sold traditional Chinese medicine before switching over to food.\n\nThe native of Baihou in Meizhou’s Dapu county sold a dish from his hometown called yan mee (salted noodles), another name for Taipu noodles. (In places with a large Hakka population like Ipoh and Seremban, Taipu noodles developed into what Malaysians call Hakka mee.)\n\nUsing a long bamboo stick, Kiew would beat the dough for making noodles daily. It is said that the sound of him preparing the dough could be heard over in Carpenter Street and even the Main Bazaar.\n\nOver time, yan mee was adapted to local tastes. The dry version became the dominant one, while the soupy rendition fell out of favour.\n\nBy the 1980s, the dish came to be known as kolo mee or “dry tossed noodles” in Cantonese. The sound of Kiew’s bamboo stick striking dough is another possible origin for the name.\n\nA dish for everyone\n\nSimilar to Hakka mee, kolo mee is egg noodles tossed in lard and shallot oil, topped with minced pork and crispy fried shallots or garlic.\n\nThe noodles are typically served one of three ways — with light soya sauce, red char siu sauce or just plain.\n\nMost places now also include thin slices of lean char siu (Chinese barbeque pork), possibly a Cantonese contribution.\n\nFor a more substantial meal, the noodles can be enjoyed with wontons or a bowl of mixed pork soup, a style known as zheng in Kuching. There’s also a seafood version with fish balls, prawns and more.\n\nPatrons can choose the type of egg noodles they want — tit mee (straight), Q mee (curly) or mee pok (flat). In Miri, Sarawak’s laidback second city, a flattish noodle known locally as Guangdong mee is also popular.\n\nAside from egg noodles, the dish can be served with kway teow (flat rice noodles), beehoon (rice vermicelli) and loh shu fun (silver needle noodles).\n\nKolo mee is now enjoyed by all the communities in Sarawak.\n\nIn addition to the Chinese version, there is halal mi kolok for Malays and Muslim Melanau that swaps pork for chicken or beef, as well as mi rangkai, the Iban version of the dish."
