For example:\n\nReword sentences to make them less wordy, e.g. ‘The house that Jack was building on his land’ could be changed to ‘The house that Jack built’\n\nPut in commas, colons and other punctuation to make the text easier to read.\n\nSo, where does the spelling come in? After ALL this! There is no point fixing the spelling first if you are going to end up deleting a whole paragraph or totally changing the fight scene. It’s a waste of time."
