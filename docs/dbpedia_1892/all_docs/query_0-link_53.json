        "text": "Lying 600km east of Peninsular Malaysia across the South China Sea, stepping into Sarawak after visiting the mainland feels like entering an entirely different country. The largest of Malaysia’s 13 states, Sarawak is home to dozens of distinctive ethnic groups and some of the world’s oldest and most biodiverse rainforests. From its charming riverside capital Kuching in the west to its labyrinthine cave systems in the east, both the culturally curious and nature lovers will discover a land of constant wonders. Here’s how to do it in six days:\n\nDay 1: Soak in the laid-back charisma of Kuching\n\nOnce a busy trading post on the banks of the Sarawak River, Kuching now entices travellers with its iconic heritage sites, relaxed riverine atmosphere, Unesco-listed food scene and multicultural society, where indigenous Iban carvings and Orang Ulu batik can be found next to Indian textiles and Chinese herbal medicine.\n\nTo prepare for a day of exploring one of Malaysia’s most walkable cities on foot, start with a bowl of the state’s signature dish: Sarawak laksa. Every Malaysian region has its own rendition of the spicy noodle soup, but Sarawak’s is more pepper-driven than others, says Anna Sulan Masing. Her deeply ruminative podcast Taste of Place explores nostalgia through the story of pepper, including a focus on Sarawak pepper. With smoky, floral notes, it’s one of the main agricultural products of rural Sarawak, where she grew up.\n\nServing a steady stream of locals and tourists Tuesday to Sunday from 6.30am until 11am (though it’s best to arrive before 9am), Choon Hui Café is famous for its silky, ochre red laksa broth. A medley of dried spices, chili, lemongrass, galangal, tamarind and coconut milk, it’s ladled over springy rice noodles, shredded chicken, strips of omelette, bean sprouts and plump prawns.\n\nA 20-minute postprandial stroll will take you to the Kuching Waterfront, which skirts the Sarawak River’s southern bank for just over 1km. Once a muddy stretch of time-worn warehouses and wharves, large-scale revitalisation has transformed it into a vibrant recreation and entertainment precinct lined with craft shops, cafes and food stalls.\n\nFrom the Waterfront it’s a short walk to the birthplace of Kuching’s commercial heart, the Old Bazaar, established by Cantonese immigrants in the 1820s. Within hundreds of shophouses sit century-old businesses, from goldsmiths and bicycle shops to kopitiams and tailors, alongside souvenir outlets, bars and eateries. Inhale the aromas from sizzling woks and look out for plaques containing QR codes linking to the stories of the area’s most important buildings, streets and lanes.\n\nContinue your journey through Kuching’s past by taking a boat ride from the Waterfront or walking over the gently curving footbridge to the Sarawak River’s northern bank and to Fort Margherita. Up until 1841, Kuching was part of neighbouring Brunei but was then ruled for more than a century by a British dynastic monarchy, the Brooke family, known as the White Rajahs. Built in 1879 to protect Kuching from pirates, their legacy is best experienced at the fort, which today houses a museum that helps visitors learn about their reign and Sarawak’s colonial era.\n\nDay 2: Immerse yourself in Borneo’s indigenous cultures\n\nRising from the earth like the serried tips of Dayak shields and adorned with a prominent woven pattern, the striking facade of the Borneo Cultures Museum – which opened in early 2022 – reflects the significance of the island’s indigenous heritage. Claimed to be South East Asia’s second-largest museum, it houses more than 1,400 artefacts, across five floors, which are brought to life for visitors through interactive displays and impressive projection mapping.\n\nAfter a morning at the museum, hire a car and driver from one of Kuching’s many tour operators and travel for just under an hour to Sarawak Cultural Village. A “living museum” set across 17 acres at the base of mist-shrouded hills, it celebrates the state’s seven major ethnic groups – the Iban, Bidayuh, Orang Ulu, Penan, Melanau, Malay and Chinese. Climb narrow steps carved from single trunks of ironwood into the meticulously recreated longhouses, poke about in a Malay townhouse and Chinese farmhouse, then at 16:00 take a seat for a spirited performance of traditional dance and music.\n\nA subsidiary of Malaysian Airlines, Maswings runs one daily direct flight from Kuching to Mulu, departing at 10:55 and arriving at 12:35, but heavy rain can result in delays or cancellations. A transfer can easily be found at Mulu’s tiny airport to take you the 1.2km to the national park, which offers four accommodation types ranging from dormitory beds to deluxe garden bungalows, with all including breakfast. When visiting during the driest months, June to September, book accommodation and tours at least three weeks in advance.\n\nDays 5 and 6: Embark on a subterranean adventure\n\nActivities at the park are divided into four categories catering for most fitness levels, ranging from “showcaves” with boarded walkways to multi-day hikes that summit Mount Mulu. Most activities require a guide, and no matter what time of year you visit, a sturdy raincoat is essential.\n\nMust-see experiences include Deer Cave, a cathedralesque cavern where sunlight streams through a sinkhole nourishing vegetation below; Lang Cave, where stalactites resemble gigantic lion’s mane jellyfish; the exodus of three million bats forming rivulets of black smoke in the twilight sky; and the canopy walk suspended 25m above the forest floor. From the gently swaying walkway, the sounds of countless insects and glimpses of Melinau River snaking through every shade of green encapsulate the wild beauty of Borneo."
