        "text": "Previous Lot Next Lot\n\nAuction: 21019 - Important Stamps and Covers of the World\n\nLot: 842\n\nSarawak\n\n1923 (Jan.) Second printing, \"one/cent\" on bright blue lower right corner block of four with plate number, the upper left stamp showing \"en\" of \"cent\" scratched out and \"ne\" overprinted, fine mint. A major rarity with just thirteen examples printed and exceptional in this positional form. S.G. 74ca, £9,000+. Photo\n\nNote: The \"cnet\" error was corrected for the second printing but the native compositor had been instructed to make this second overprinting identical to the first and, realising that he had failed to make a true copy, therefore altered the correctly spelled \"cent\" to conform to the original \"cnet\" error.\n\nSubject to 20% VAT on Buyer’s Premium. Not applicable to \"Buy Now \" offerings. For more information please view Terms and Conditions for Buyers.\n\nSold for\n\n£4,500"
