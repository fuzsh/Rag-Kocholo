        "text": "index\n\nSearching the Organizations - Enhanced List\n\nThis index allows you to search for preferred organization names and/or their name variants to add to your search query. You can select multiple preferred names and/or name variants.\n\nindex\n\nSearch Field versus Search Aid Results\n\nTyping a name variant in the search field does not always return the same number of results as selecting a name variant from the search aid.\n\nFor example, entering the variant Columbia Coll in the search field returns all records that contain Columbia Coll anywhere in the Addresses field.\n\nEntering Columbia Coll in the Find field in the search aid displays the preferred name Columbia University in the selection list. A search on this name returns records containing the preferred name and records containing the variant.\n\nindex\n\nBrowse Option\n\nClick a letter (A-Z) or a number (0-9) to browse through a list of preferred organization names alphabetically or numerically. This feature is useful if you do not know the correct spelling of a preferred organization name. For example, click the J link to find:\n\nJabaton Hutan Sarawak\n\nJacskon Laboratory\n\nJackson State University\n\nJadavpur University\n\nAnd other preferred names that begin with the letter J\n\nClick the Details icon of a preferred name to go to a Details page where you can restrict your search to one or more name variants. This step is optional.\n\nindex\n\nFind Option\n\nEnter a word or phrase in the Find text field. Wildcards (* $ ?) are permitted but Boolean operators are not.\n\nClick the Find button to search the list of preferred organization names. For example, if you enter ASU as the search term, the product finds the preferred names for organizations containing ASU. In this example, the search aid finds the preferred names:\n\nAppalachian State University\n\nArizona State University\n\nClick the Details icon of a preferred name to go to the Details page where you can restrict your search to one or more name variants. This step is optional.\n\nFrom the Results Page list, click the Add button to add one or more preferred organization names to your search query.\n\nFrom the Details page, click the Add button to add one or more name variants to your search query.\n\nClick OK to transfer the selected names to the Organization - Enhanced field on the Search page.\n\nIf you are performing an Advanced Search, the product transfers the selected names to the search field box along with the OG field tag. For example, OG=(Arizona State University).\n\nNote: The Find feature searches the following fields within the index: Organization Name, Other Names, Relationships, and Name Variants.\n\nindex\n\nAbout Finding Preferred Organization Names and Name Variants\n\nIn some instances, an organization name can be a part of a variant for a different organization. For example, a Find search on Princeton Univ returns:\n\nInstitut Etudes Politiques Paris\n\nPfizer\n\nPrinceton Physics Laboratory\n\nPrinceton University\n\nRutgers State University\n\nSiemens AG\n\nUniversity of Oxford\n\nIf you select the Details icon for Institut Etudes Politiques Paris, the search aid contains the following variant: Sci Po Paris Princeton Univ.\n\nindex\n\nDetails Page\n\nThe Details page allows you to select from a list of organization name variants. Any or all of the following fields may appear on the Details page. If no data are available for a particular field, then the field does not display."
