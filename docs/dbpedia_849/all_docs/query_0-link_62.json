        "text": "As Germany’s capital and the largest city in the country, almost everyone who visits “The Land of Poets and Thinkers” visits Berlin. While I at first disliked the “industrial” look of the city, its gritty feel, art, history, and nightlife grew on me as I explored. Today, it’s one of my favorite cities in Europe!\n\nOver the past decade, Berlin has become incredibly popular with students, artists, writers, and creatives. They’ve been drawn to the city’s cheap rent and anything-goes spirit. There’s a constant sense of motion in Berlin.\n\nThis city is one of the most vibrant on the continent. It’s also huge, so don’t try to see it in just a couple of days. Extend your stay, take your time, rent a bike, and don’t rush. There’s a lot to see.\n\nThis travel guide to Berlin can help you plan your trip, save money, and ensure you have an amazing time in this lively metropolis."
