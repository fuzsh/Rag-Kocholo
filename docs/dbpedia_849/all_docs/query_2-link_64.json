While it isn’t next door to the Mall of Berlin (20-minute subway ride away) and does not have the city-center bustle (meh), Hotel Louisa’s Place has an old-world charm with all the modern conveniences needed for a very comfortable stay. I will stay here on my next trip to Berlin and I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a comfortable alternative to the corporate chain hotels. Room: Very much liked the room floorplan. It was like a 1-bedroom apartment with a separate living/dining/kitchen area and a patio with a table for two overlooking the courtyard. The bathroom was spacious with a huge shower. The 12-foot-high ceilings with ornate crown molding and large windows made it seem very grand. We felt as though we had a posh European flat for our week in Berlin with all the amenities of a very nice hotel. Location: I was surprised to learn that everything we needed during our stay was within walking distance. We found three grocery stores and more restaurants than we had time to try all within a 5–10-minute walk. There was also an abundance of other shops and stores near the hotel. The U-Bahn (subway) station was 1 block from the front door. The S-Bahn (main city-wide trains) station was a 8-10-minute walk or you could walk to the U-Bahn and ride it to the next stop and shorten the walk to the S-Bahn. We did not need a rental car since all of our activities were accessible from the nearby subway or train. Price: I did my homework and found this hotel to be well-positioned in the market. Value for money was very good. So glad we did not stay in the chain hotel we were considering. Service: Unlike American hotels post-pandemic, housekeeping was done every day of our stay with fresh towels as needed. They emptied the trash bins and collected recycled containers and generally tidied up. All staff were very friendly and eager to help with any questions and requests we had. Cleanliness: All aspects of this hotel were well tended to. I typically wipe down drawers and shelves before putting clothes away. That was not necessary at this hotel. The bathroom and kitchen were very clean, and I was impressed by how this older building has been meticulously upgraded and maintained.\n\n- Guest User\n\nWe just spent 5 nights at the Regent. We booked their least expensive room and it was still fabulous. This is one of those hotels that does everything right. The hotel lobby and the rooms are elegant and yet not stuffy. The staff is totally friendly to everyone - from the business people in the breakfast rooms right on over to us traveler types in our polar fleece and REI travel pants:) Breakfast is excellent. The beds are comfortable, the sheets high quality. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are incredible. Full tub, large shower, big mirrors, good lighting. The toiletries are L’Occitane. There’s a high-end coffee maker and pods. The locations is perfect. We did a ton of walking - and in walking, I saw many of the other Berlin hotels I had considered in my research. None of the other locations is this perfect - especially for a first-time tourist to Berlin. We could walk to Museum Island in under 10 minutes. 10 minutes to the Brandenburg Gate. 10 minutes to the Checkpoint Charlie area. I cannot compliment the Regent enough. It is one of those rare hotels that just did it all right for us.\n\n- Guest User\n\n4.2/5Very Good43 Reviews\n\nBerlin City Centre Berlin|1.21km from city center\n\nThe location of Hilton Berlin is fantastic and the exterior of the hotel plus the lobby is very beautiful. Very walkable location with many surrounding dining and sightseeing options. Overall, housekeeping was good. The rooms run fairly small and look dated, so value for money is not that great. Bathroom is clean but not very well-maintained, especially the toilet. The check-in concierge staff were ok but I would expect friendlier and more proactive service for the price we were paying and being a diamond member as well. The staff who was a blonde lady with glasses checked me in and out and was the friendliest staff i encountered during my stay. Rarely did the other staff smile or greet us when we walked past them and they generally did not have great customer service skills, and generally just unfriendly. The front door concierge and door staff were much friendlier and greeted us more than the check-in staff. I also had a very terrible experience with the night security staff when my friend and I came back to the hotel around 6 am after a night out. We walked in and were stopped by a man who was not wearing any uniform, or any attire to signal he was working at the Hilton, and in regular clothes, he was a bit hard to understand because he had a thick accent, and I thought he might be another patron at the hotel or a taxi driver, so I politely smiled at him and said “no thank you” and walked towards the elevator. He got extremely angry, began shouting at me, and said he was a worker there and showed me his keys with a Hilton keychain. He wanted to verify that we had a room key. While we were taking out the key, he was calling me rude and dismissive and that I was a terrible person. It was so jarring because there was no need to be that rude, he was acting like I shooed him away when I’m reality it was a miscommunication. He then went into the back of the concierge to complain about me loudly, didn’t even wait till I was out of earshot. It was hard to identify him as a staff, much less security, and I didn’t need to be scolded like a child. Overall, very unprofessional and made the remainder of my stay feel much more sour. I can look past the dated rooms because I know that is out of the staff’s control at that point of time. But unprofessional and unfriendly staff make the value of my stay and diamond member status much worse.\n\nFrom$130\n\n4.2/5Very Good117 Reviews\n\nBerlin City Centre Berlin|1.2km from city center\n\nFour things to know about this hotel before you book. 1. If you book early you will pay more. 311 euros a night booked three months ahead. 200 euros a night booked three weeks ahead. Look at any booking website. 2. On check-in they take the full amount of your stay from your credit card, plus a 50 euros a day deposit ”in case you use the mini-bar”. (In fact the mini-bar is empty - see photo). This might be a problem if you have credit limit issues. 3. They use sweaty, clammy poly-cotton bed-linen - see photo of label. You cannot change hotels because they have already trousered your money. To sleep properly we had to buy our own fully cotton bed-linen - see photo of receipt. The reason they use poly-cotton is explained on the manufacturer's website: ​”Bed linen must be lightweight...thus allowing staff to work faster....Experience shows that savings of 5 to 10% can be achieved”. Nothing about the comfort of guests. The staff say that all Westin hotels use poly-cotton. Totally unacceptable in a serious hotel and we shall not stay in a Westin hotel again. 4. Because of the hotel's layout, most bedrooms are 50 to 120 meters from the elevators. In the course of a day you can easily walk a kilometre or more to and from your room. In other respects it is well positioned, if you wish to be in Mitte, the breakfast is good, and the staff are professional and helpful to the extent that the chain allows. Garden rooms are a very little bit smaller than rooms on the street, but much quieter and a few have a balcony.\n\nFrom$171\n\n4.3/5Excellent101 Reviews\n\nBerlin City Centre Berlin|0.77km from city center\n\nIn summary: Superb breakfast, good rooms, pretty good location (but there are better in Berlin), a few details could be improved. Good value for money. Accor has a huge range of hotels in Berlin, this is for them a midrange offering. The rooms are of reasonable size, I had a huge bathroom, minibar and room safe. Very clean. Bed surprisingly comfortable. Free wifi good enough for video streaming (there's also 'premium wifi' you can pay for). TV and heating controls fussy. Shower gel holder in the bathroom remained empty throughout my four day stay though there was liquid soap by the sink. Reading lights in room below average. Reception friendly, a little chaotic. The hotel restaurant is open in the evenings, snacks and drinks available after hours. Locked luggage storage next to reception. Breakfast is really nice - great coffee and fruit juice, all the rest as you would expect including some cold fish dishes. One level below an 'omelette bar' status but still pretty good for this price level of hotel. Location in Berlin Mitte is pretty good - they're two U-Bahn stations and several bus stops within a few minutes' walk, even though some of the bus schedules are a bit disappointing. Nikolaiviertel is 5 minutes walk away and if you increase your walking time to 15 minutes you can get to Alexanderplatz and Museuminsel easily enough. There are better location hotels in Mitte but it's quite OK really. Good value for money; rates vary quite a bit by day of the week (so if your travel days are flexible play around with your stay dates). I generally stay either more downmarket or more upmarket than this but it's interesting to see how a midrange hotel works - quite OK, though as often in this category of hotel proactive detail management doesn't get priority. I would recommend.\n\nFrom$87\n\n4.5/5Excellent57 Reviews\n\nBerlin City Centre Berlin|1.76km from city center\n\nThis hotel has 5 room types, i booked an Executive apartment, which if the second top room type. I am a solo traveller, but liked the room layout and the extra space. I checked in on 30/03/22 for 3 nights and was allocated room 107. On opening the door i immediately thought it did not exactly resemble the pics i had seen for an Executive Apartment, it was big enough, but just not what i was expecting. The kitchen area was locked up with a shutter over it, which i thought strange. I literally just in the room for 5 minutes and went out exploring. I checked with reception about the kitchen being looked and they asked if i wanted it unlocked to use, yes, that's why i booked that room type, the fridge with freezer compartment for ice and cold drinks. I came back about 5 hours later and the kitchen was indeed unlocked. I was going to shower and looked for the bath robe and slippers which should be in the room, but nothing was there. it was at this point i was sure this was not the room type i had booked. I checked on my phone and looking at the specifications was sure i had been given the wrong room type. I went to reception to enquire and spoke to the duty manager, he printed off 2 pages to show the difference between an Executive Apartment and an Apartment (the top room type), although the same pics had been used to advertise both room types, there were some differences and he stated that my room was larger than most in the hotel. I was still unsure, but accepted what he said and i collected a bathrobe and slippers, the reason they are not already in the room was due to ongoing Covid restrictions. I still felt that i was in the room room type, it was large, but a lot of the room was taken up by a wet room, which was adapted for a wheelchair user and this made the room an awkward space with a lot of dead space. As it turned out, my flight home was cancelled and i ended up staying only 2 nights, so didn't pursue things further. On returning home i checked the room specifications on the website and room 107 is not up to the specifications advertised or as soon in the pics. two main reasons. 1) Executive Apartments have a sofa/sofa bed and can sleep up to 3 people, room 107 had no sofa/sofa bed and this room could only sleep 2 people max. 2) Executive Apartments have a separate seating area, a table and chairs where you can sit and eat, this is clearly shown in the pics too. This was not in room 107. The only seating was a chair at the desk and one other chair. I think room 107 is a superior room adapted for a wheelchair user, but was given to me as i was a solo traveller and dd not need the capacity to sleep 3. I wanted the sofa/sofa bed to sit on and relax, that's why i booked a room with that in it. I am only writing this review, as 3 emails have gone unanswered, one to novum hotels 10/04/22 and two direct to the hotel 12/04/22 and 20/04/22. I do note that the hotel responds to some reviews on here, so perhaps you could get back to me, as I would\n\nFrom$85"
