        "text": "Metros in Germany: The Berlin U-Bahn (UPDATED 2017)\n\nBerlin is the capital of Germany. It has a population of approximately four million people, making it the most populous city in the country. Berlin was divided into East and West by the Berlin Wall during the Cold War. The wall was later destroyed and the country was reunified. Berlin is famous for its street art, museums, historical sites, cafés and nightlife.\n\nBerlin has two airports: the Tegel International Airport and Schönefeld. Most of the city's public transportation is owned by Berliner Verkhersbetriebe (BVG). This company owns ferries, buses, trams and the metro. There is also a train called the S-Bahn, but it is not directly managed by BVG. The metro service is called the U-Bahn.\n\nHistory\n\nThe U-Bahn was officially inaugurated on February 15, 1902, with the opening of lines U1 and U2. The original stations for line U1 were Stralauer Tor and Zoologischer Garten.

The closest metro station to the airport is S+U Berlin Hauptbahnhof station. You will need to use the S-Bahn for 42 minutes to find this station. From this airport's terminal, walk 420 meters to S-Flughafen Berlin-Schönefeld Bhf. Next, board the S-Bahn in line RB14 towards Nauen, Bahnhof, for 32 minutes.

You could also use the map from BVG's app, which is called \"Fahr Info.\"\n\n2) Buying a ticket can be confusing since there are tickets for different zones and for different times. If you want to avoid any confusion and save time, buy a monthly pass or any ticket that lasts over a day.\n\n3) Vending machines only accept debit cards from German banks. You cannot pay for a ticket with your credit card. Therefore, you will need to use cash at vending machines. You can pay with any coin above €0.10, or you could use bills of the amounts €20, €10, or €5. However, some vending machines do not accept bills. Also, vending machines only give change in coins. Therefore, use bills of small amounts to avoid having to carry too many coins.\n\n4) If you transfer from the metro to a bus, you only need to show your ticket to the driver to board the bus. You do not need to stamp it.\n\n5) You need to stamp your ticket before boarding the metro, even though nobody will ask you to see your ticket while you board. You can stamp your ticket at stamping machines close to the vending machines at the stations. If you have a ticket but it is not stamped, or if you did not bring a ticket with you, you will be fined for €60.\n\n6) You can transfer to the Nachtbus (night bus) between 1:00 am and 5:00 am from Monday to Friday.\n\n7) People on the metro do not speak much. If you speak a lot, people may get disturbed.\n\n8) Do not put your feet on the metro's seats, since it is considered impolite. Also, do not put your bag on a seat, since it may annoy a passenger that may want to sit there.\n\n9) It is normal that people stay too close to each other in the metro. You may feel uncomfortable, but people in Berlin are used to being too close to each other in crowded trains.\n\n10) Do not feel offended if passengers do not apologize if they push you while trying to get out of the train, since this behavior is common.\n\nRules in Berlin Metro\n\n- Cameras and film:\n\nYou require permission to take pictures and film at stations or inside the metro. If you work for a newspaper or in a project that requires pictures and videos, you need to contact BVG's offices one week prior. In some cases, you may require to contact them months in advance. You need to provide the following information to be able to take pictures and videos:\n\na) Describe the project.\n\nb) Proof from your school that the project is required by the class.\n\nc) Phone number and email.\n\nd) Length of time that you will be filming and taking pictures.\n\ne) Places where you will take the pictures and film.\n\nf) Describe the pictures and scenes needed as they appear in your script.\n\ng) The number of participants in the project.\n\nThe licenses are given in German. If your project is big and complex, you will need a German translator. Licenses also require a fee. Additionally, you need insurance that covers public liability.\n\nThe offices where you need to ask for permission are located in the following address: Press Office, Vorstandsstab Medien (V-M,) Holzmarktstraße 15-17, 10179, Berlin. You can contact those at (030) 25627901. If you need a press license, contact them at pressestelle@BVG.de.

You can call them at (030)19449. Their office hours are: Monday to Thursday, from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm, and Fridays, from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm. These offices are closed to the public on weekends and holidays.\n\nThe metro staff keeps your lost items for up to one month and two weeks. You will need to pay a fee to recover your item. Depending on what you lost, you would need to pay €1, €2.50, or €7.\n\nProhibited behaviors:\n\nThe following behaviors are not allowed:\n\na) Walking on the railways.\n\nb) Smoking in the metro or at the stations.\n\nc) Forcing the doors open.\n\nd) Blocking the doors or the emergency exits.\n\ne) Using the emergency equipment outside of an emergency.\n\nf) Disobeying the metro staff.\n\ng) Throwing your trash outside the trash bins.\n\nh) Speaking loudly.\n\n- Customer service:\n\nThe customer service staff can speak in English and in German. The metro staff can help you with any questions. They wear uniforms, so you will be able to easily recognize them. You can call the customer service personnel at (030)25414141.\n\n- Free:\n\nYou can bring your baggage and a stroller for free. If you bring a bicycle, you will need to pay an extra fare. Children under six years old do not have to pay. Furthermore, children under 15 years old can receive discounts for their rides.\n\n- Using tickets:\n\nSometimes, you need to validate your ticket before entering the metro, while other times you could do it inside the metro. Bus drivers offer tickets. However, metro drivers do not sell tickets. Therefore, you need to purchase your ticket before boarding the metro.\n\n- Passengers:\n\na) People with strollers and people on wheelchairs should board the metro first.\n\nb) Before entering the metro, let all the passengers exit the metro beforehand.\n\nc) Give your seat to people with disabilities, pregnant women, or senior citizens if you are asked to.\n\n- Bicycles:\n\nYou can only bring a bicycle if there is space available. You may need to give your space to people on wheelchairs or people carrying a stroller. You need to pay a €1.90 fare to bring a bicycle.\n\n- Animals:\n\nYou need to pay a €1.70 fare to bring dogs to the metro. The dogs need on a leash and wear muzzles. However, if the dog is small in size and is brought inside a cage, you can bring them for free.\n\nFun Facts\n\n1) The metro is ridden by over 1.3 million people each day.\n\n2) The metro uses 750 volts of electricity, which come from a third rail.\n\n3) The gauge size of the railway is of 1.4 meters.\n\n4) The closest beach in Berlin is located at Wansee Lake. To go there via the metro, go to Nikolassee station in line U1.\n\n5) You can get beautiful panoramic views of Potsdamer Platz if you travel from Gleisdreieck station in either line U1 or U2.\n\n6) Some fonts were made specifically for the metro. These fonts are called Transit and U8. The Transit font was made in 1991 by Henning Krause, Erik Spiekermann, and Lucas de Groot. Meanwhile, the U8 font was made in 1923 by Alfred Grenander.\n\n7) The train models for the U-Bahn are the German-Austrian family models. These trains are similar to those in the metro of Vienna, Munich, and Nuremberg.\n\n8) There were around 14 stations that were closed to the public when the Berlin Wall was built. However, all those stations opened once again in 1989. Some trains of the metro connected West Berlin and East Berlin during the times of the Berlin Wall. These trains were from Heinrich-Heine-Straße station, Bernauer Straße station, Schwartzkopffstraße station, and Stadtmitte station.\n\n9) There are guided tours for the metro offered by BVG. You can walk on the railway on some of these tours, during times where the metro is closed. There are other tours where you board the metro. These last tours last over an hour, and they cover over 30 kilometers of railway.\n\n10) During the early 1900s, over 60 of the stations were designed by Alfred Grenander. Those stations have a modernist style of architecture, such as the Wittenbergplatz station. The architecture looks luxurious in some stations because they were funded by the upper class people of Wilmersdorf. The stations built between the 1960s and the 1990s were made by Rainer G. Rümmler. The stations made by him are either postmodernist or minimalist. One of the station made by Rümmler is Rathaus Spandau.\n\n11) There is a museum in Olympia-Stadion with displays related to the metro. There are guided tours in here. Displays include discarded trains, old vending machines, and signals. It costs €2 to enter. This museum's hours are from 10:30 am to 4:00 pm on Saturdays of the second week of the month.\n\n12) Another museum displaying exhibits from the metro is located at the German Museum of Technology at the Historical Train Depot. This museum shows discarded trains from the U-Bahn. This museum is free. These exhibits are available only once per year on September, from 10:00 am until 5:30 pm.\n\n13) Pre-recorded voices at the metro only speak in German. Common spoken lines are \"Zug nach,\" \"Zurückbleiben, bitte,\" and \"Einsteigen, bitte,\" which mean \"Train to,\" \"Stand back, please,\" and \"Board the metro, please\" respectively.\n\n14) When the doors of the metro are about to close, an alarm plays with sounds similar to the alarm of the Paris Metro.\n\n15) Some scenes for many movies were filmed in the Metro. Those movies are: Resident Evil, Berlin Calling, Wings of Desire, Equilibrium, The Bourne Supremacy, Christiane F, Run Lola Run, and Flightplan.\n\n16) You can use the same tickets in all of the public transportation in Berlin. Therefore, you do not need to buy a different ticket to board the metro.\n\nFuture expansions\n\nA new line may be considered in the future. There are plans to expand the current lines. The planned expansions are the following:\n\n1) U1: This line will be expanded to go to the regions of Frankfurter Tor, Berlin Ostkreuz, Adenauerplatz, Greifswalder Straße, Theodor-Heuss-Platz, Falkenberg, Karow-Ost, Weißensee, and Potsdamer Platz. To achieve this, the stations of Wittenbergplatz and Uhlandstraße will be upgraded and extended.
