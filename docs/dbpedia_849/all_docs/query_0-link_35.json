This microfluidics based method allows to rapidly capture mRNAs within thousands of individual cells in an hour on a desktop setup. After amplification and sequencing, based on barcode information individual reads can be assigned to individual molecules in individual cells.\n\nIn collaboration with the Robert Zinzen lab, we applied this method to the dissociated fly embryo at stage 6. Each of the 6,000 cells of this embryo is distinct as it will give rise to a different part of the fly body. Therefore, it is important to know the molecular makeup of each individual cell.\n\nHowever, after sequencing individual cells, the problem is to identify the spatial position of this cell within the embryo. We designed a new method that solves this problem (“Distmap”) (Karaiskos et al., Science 2017).\n\nAs a result, we quantified gene expression for the vast majority of the embryo cells at a resolution of ~8,000 genes per cell. These data allowed us to create a “virtual embryo” where researchers can perform, online, virtual in situ hybridization for thousands of genes (www.devtex.org).\n\nWe identified dozens of transcription factors and lncRNAs as likely novel regulatory factors in this system, and discovered that Hippo signaling is active in the embryo and probably responsible for inducing the exit of patches of cells from synchronized cell divisions, thus explaining observations that have been made decades ago.\n\nGene expression in the fly embryo at single cell resolution (Karaiskos et al. Science 2017)\n\nExample 2: Human brain organoids\n\nHuman brain organoids recapitulate brain development in vitro and enables us to study, at single cell and subcellular level, functions of regulatory RNA in a human-specific genetic background. This allows us to model patient-specific diseases using brain organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of individual patient. Using the CRISPR-Cas system we can also edit the genome of the pluripotent stem cells in order to introduce or correct disease-related mutations.\n\nIn addition, the lab of Nikolaus Rajewsky is working in close collaboration with the Organoid Platform (LINK) on the optimization of protocols for region-specific organoids, such as forebrain organoid protocol (Miriam Wandres, unpublished).\n\nFurthermore, to identify spatial relationships of cells within the 3D brain organoid, clearing and immunolabeling has been recently developed (Anna Ponomarenko and Miriam Wandres, in collaboration with the lab of Andrew Woehler (LINK) and the Organoid Platform, unpublished).\n\nThe videos below depict a cleared forebrain organoid labelled for nuclei (grey) and tight junctions (yellow) in both Z-stack and 3D-view - staining and clearing by A. Ponomarenko, organoid generation by M. Wandres and D. Aigner.\n\nExample 3: Regulation by RNA\n\nWe are studying regulation by RNA in solid tumors, muscle cells in human patients, and cardio-vascular systems in collaboration with many colleagues.\n\nExample 4: Circular RNAs\n\nIn 2012/2013, we discovered that animals express a large number of different circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the cytoplasm of cells (Memczak et al. Nature 2013). This observation was also published independently by the Brown and Sharpless labs.\n\nHowever, we also showed that circRNA expression is tissue and developmental stage specific and identified a circRNA (CDR1as) that we proposed regulates gene expression by binding large numbers of a conserved miRNA (miR-7) (Memczak et al. Nature 2013; back-to-back with the Kjems lab).\n\nOur paper also contained several methods for detecting, imaging, and quantifying circRNA expression. We thus proposed that circRNAs can have regulatory roles. This is interesting since circRNAs are highly stable and therefore may perform specific tasks.\n\nIn a serious of follow up papers, we (a) showed that circRNAs are usually produced by “backsplicing” (Ashwal-Fluss et al. Mol Cell 2014) (b) published a widely used public circRNA database where we curate published circRNAs (Glazar et al. RNA 2015) (c) showed that thousands of circRNAs are readily detected in human blood and may serve as biomarkers (d) discovered that a few hundred circRNAs are highly expressed in the mammalian brain and that this expression is well conserved, developmental stage- and tissue specific, and enriched in synaptosomes (Rybak-Wolf et al. Mol. Cell 2015).\n\nFinally, we removed a the CDR1as locus from the mouse genome, showed that the expression of miRNAs that directly interact with CDR1as is specifically altered in the brain of KO mice, and found a behavior phenotype (“pre-pulse inhibition deficit”) that is indicative of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as an electrophysiological synaptic phenotype (Piwecka et al. Science 2017). We believe that these results argue that we discovered a regulatory layer of circRNAs and interacting molecules that have regulatory function in the mammalian brain.\n\nExample 5: Competition effects in post-transcriptional gene regulation\n\nWe wrote an “Analysis Review” about functions of competition effects in post-transcriptional gene regulation. In this review, we also proposed and tested one of the first quantitative models. (Jens & Rajewsky, Nature Reviews Genetics 2014).\n\nModel organisms\n\nWe study posttranscriptional gene regulation in cell culture and two famous model systems: The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (and its relative Caenorhabditis briggsae) and Schmidtea mediterranea.\n\nC. elegans\n\nThe early embryo and the germline of C.elegans are highly regulated on the posttranscriptional level. For example, while PolII activity starts at the 4-cell stage, the earlier divisions already differentiate the future germline from the soma and set the body axes, without any transcription at all. [Stitzel and Seydoux 2007, Yamamoto, I.; Kosinski, M. E. & Greenstein, D. (2006)]\n\nBackground information\n\nAn ideal system to explore very early developmental processes\n\nSince its establishment as a model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans has been an invaluable tool for biological research. An immense spectrum of questions can be addressed using this small nematode, making it one of the most versatile and exciting model organisms.The worm is also the organism in which miRNAs have been first described.\n\nThe worm is an ideal system to explore the very early developmental processes because of its rapid and invariant development and its ease of RNAi and transgenic techniques. Studies in the model organism C. elegans have yielded most of what is known today about metazoan development. The first embryonic division in C. elegans has been intensely studied since it is used as an in vivo system for detailed studies of metazoan cell division.\n\nVery early development in the worm (and most other species) is mainly controlled by maternal gene products which are loaded into the oocyte during oogenesis. After fertilization the C. elegans embryo undergoes a series of stereotyped asymmetric cleavages that spatially segregate these maternal factors, such as transcription factors and coding and noncoding RNAs. After a set of divisions the embryo activates its own transcription. This so called maternal to zygotic transition is a universal process in animal development: The embryo overtakes the control and thus no longer solely relies on maternally provided transcripts.\n\nWe are investigating the function of small RNAs during very early development of C. elegans.\n\nS. mediterranea\n\nThe fresh water flatworm S. mediterranea has been described already more than 200 years ago. Like many flatworms, it exhibits an astounding capacity to regenerate after injuries: a single animal, cut into dozens of pieces, may give rise to dozens of fully regenerated, clonal animals.\n\nAlso, unlike another famous regeneration model organism, the radial-symmetric Hydra, the bilateral planarians are complex, with an organized nervous system, eyes and other organs.\n\nThe young Charles Darwin collected some land planarians during his voyage with the HMS Beagle (1831 to 1836). He notes:\n\n\"Having cut one of them transversely into two nearly equal parts, in the course of a fortnight both had the shape of perfect animals. I had, however, so divided the body, that one of the halves contained both the inferior orifices, and the other, in consequence, none. In the course of twenty-five days from the operation, the more perfect half could not have been distinguished from any other specimen.\n\nThe other had increased much in size; and towards its posterior end, a clear space was formed in the parenchymatous mass, in which a rudimentary cup-shaped mouth could clearly be distinguished; on the under surface, however, no corresponding slit was yet open. If the increased heat of the weather, as we approached the equator, had not destroyed all the individuals, there can be no doubt that this last step would have completed in structure. Although so well known an experiment, it was interesting to watch the gradual production of every essential organ, out of the simple extremity of another animal.\"\n\n[\"The Voyage of the Beagle\" pp.26]\n\nBackground information\n\nThe Rajewsky lab established planaria as a model system in the lab. These freshwater flatworms are famous for their almost unlimited ability to regenerate any tissue via pluripotent, adult stem cells. We are studying the role of small RNAs in planarian regeneration."
