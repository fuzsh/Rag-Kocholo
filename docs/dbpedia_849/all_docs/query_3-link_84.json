On weekdays, from 6:00 to 20:00, trains run every 5-10 minutes. On Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays the frequency is every 10 minutes. At night, from 00:30 to 05:30 on Saturdays and from 00:30 to 07:00 on Sundays, the frequency is every 15 minutes. All lines, except the U4, have night services on weekends and public holidays.\n\nOn weekdays, the night metro service is replaced by less frequent bus services, namely the N1, N2, N3, N5, N6, N7, N8 and N9 bus services.\n\nTickets and Fares\n\nBerlin is divided into three tariff zones: Zones A, B and C.\n\nZone A includes the city centre and the S-Bahn ring.\n\nZone B extends to the border of the city of Berlin.\n\nZone C covers the greater Berlin area, including Berlin-Schönefeld airport, Potsdam, Oranienburg and Sachsenhausen.\n\nBased on these three zones, three types of ticket can be purchased: tickets for the AB zones, for the BC zones and for the whole system – the ABC zones. There are three fare classes: regular fare for adults, reduced fare for children aged 6 to 14 and free fare for children under 6. Tickets are valid on the metro, suburban trains, buses and trams.\n\nTicket machines at stations are the easiest and most direct way to buy tickets, but they can also be bought at any BVG or S-Bahn ticket office and even online.\n\nEinzelticket (Single Ticket)\n\nA single ticket for zone AB costs €2.70 and is valid for two hours in the same direction. A ticket for zones B-C costs €3.00 and a ticket for zones ABC costs €3.30.\n\nTagesticket (One Day Ticket)\n\nThese tickets can be used from the time they are validated until 3am the following day. The price is €6.90 for zones AB, €7.20 for zones BC and €7.40 for zones ABC.\n\nKleingruppenkarte (Small Group Ticket)\n\nThis ticket is a good option for groups of up to 5 people. It is cost-effective for groups of 3 or more people. The price is €16.90 for zones AB, €17.20 for zones BC, and €17.40 for zones ABC. It is valid for one day until 3 am.\n\nWelcome Card\n\nIf you’re staying in Berlin for two or more days and want to explore the city, we recommend you buy a Berlin WelcomeCard. This card gives you a special ticket for 48 or 72 hours that allows you unlimited travel on all public transport in Berlin. It also offers savings of up to 50% at museums and other tourist and cultural attractions in Berlin and Potsdam. The WelcomeCard comes with a guide with maps and recommendations for sightseeing in the city.\n\nThe Berlin Welcome Card for zones AB for one person costs €16.50 for two days and €21.50 for three days. The WelcomeCard-Berlin/Potsdam for all three zones is perfect for those travelling with children as it is valid for one adult and up to three children under the age of 14. Compared to regular ticket prices, the Welcome Card can offer significant savings.\n\nIf you want to take your bike with you on some trains, you will have to pay an extra fare, provided there is enough space. A reduced fare ticket is required for passengers travelling with dogs.\n\nThere are also weekly, monthly, and other passes and types of tickets. You can get all the updated information about tickets on the official website.\n\nHow to Use the Berlin Metro?\n\nFirstly, it’s a good idea to get a metro map, which can be bought at any station. If you buy a Berlin Welcome Card, you will also receive a detailed guide and map. The map may seem complicated at first, but don’t worry – it’s not. You can get almost anywhere in the city by underground. If there isn’t a metro to your destination, buses or trams will take you there.\n\nOn the map, you’ll need to identify your destination stop and the direction you’re going. Once you know your direction, look for the last stop on the line to use as a reference point. You can find this information on signs in the station, on the displays at the entrances to each platform and on the front of each train.\n\nNext, you’ll need to buy a ticket. In general, a ticket for zones AB should be sufficient to travel through the centre of Berlin and its most interesting neighbourhoods and sights. However, if you want to visit Potsdam or the Sachsenhausen concentration camp on the outskirts of Berlin, you’ll need an ABC ticket. You can buy tickets from machines at every station that accept both cash and credit cards. These machines have menus in six languages.\n\nThere are no barriers or turnstiles to prevent access to the platforms, but you must validate your ticket in the machines provided (usually small red or yellow machines next to the ticket machines). Random checks will be carried out by staff who will ask to see your ticket. If you’re found to be without a valid or properly validated ticket, you may be fined on the spot. In some cases, staff may even escort the passenger to a cash machine. The fine can be up to €60.\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nThe Berlin Underground, like many other systems in Germany, is called the U-Bahn. U-Bahn is an abbreviation of the German word U-Bahn, which means underground or subway.\n\nEven at rush hour, it’s often possible to find a seat on the Berlin underground.\n\nThe Berlin underground is one of the most efficient and environmentally friendly systems in Europe.\n\nBerlin’s underground trains are easily recognisable by their distinctive yellow colour.\n\nWikipedia Berlin Metro Map\n\nAccessibility\n\nBerlin’s underground stations are designed with accessibility in mind. Facilities such as lifts and ramps are provided to ensure that people with disabilities can access the stations. There are also intercoms in each station to provide assistance if needed."
