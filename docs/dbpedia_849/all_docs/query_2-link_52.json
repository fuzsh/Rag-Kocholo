        "text": "Berlin Hauptbahnhof Hotels - Berlin Central Station\n\nHotels near Berlin Hauptbahnhof\n\nBerlin Central Station, or Berlin Hauptbahnhof, is the main railway station in Berlin, Germany. The five-level glass station opened on 26 May 2006, after 12 years of planning and construction. It is now Europe's largest railway station. It is located on the site of the historic Lehrter Bahnhof. The station and the project were developed with hopes of revitalizing an area that has been stifled by the political division of the city.\n\nCity planners began work on a transport plan for reunified Berlin, with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The center of this plan revolved around a new north-south railway line intersecting the Stadtbahn which became known as the mushroom concept. The name comes from the shape formed by the new and existing lines, which somewhat resembles a mushroom.\n\nThe site for the new Berlin Central Station was not heavily populated and yet still close to the centre of Berlin and government buildings. A design competition for the project was held,in 1993, and was won by the Hamburg architecture firm of Gerkan, Marg and Partners.\n\nThe new design consists of five levels of traffic, where the east-west and north-south tracks are not interconnected. The Berlin Central Station is basically a train station attached to a shopping center.The main concourse provides roughly 44,000 square meters of commercial space or 160,000 square feet of retail space and 540,000 square feet of office space.\n\nThe Berlin Hauptbahnhof, or central station, Europe's largest, sees over 1,600 train departures daily.\n\nThe station's retail shops benefits the 300,000 travelers who pass through the station each day. It not only benefits the traveler, the local Berliners, are now awarded shops that stay open until 10 p.m., which is long after most other retailers in Germany have closed.\n\nGerkan, Marg and Partner, the same architect of Berlin's Tegel airport, and now designers of Europe's largest station can certainly be proud. The Central Station boasts some of the some of the most spectacular views. As you enter into the front entrance the gigantic, airy, hall immediately sets your eyes on the sites of four layers of trains criss-crossing each other one on top of the next, with a multitude of people in between, shopping and sauntering."
