        "text": "Getting to the city center\n\nThere are several transportation options from the airport to the city center. I've tried them all, and outlined the pros and cons below, along with tips on how to use them.\n\nTaxis and ride-hailing\n\nDesignated taxi stands are located in front of Terminal 1. There's no set rate from the airport to the city, and be aware that taxis in Berlin are quite expensive. Uber is also available from designated ride-hailing zones and costs about the same as a taxi. On average, your ride to the city will cost 50 euros.\n\nTrains\n\nI almost always use public transport to travel to and from the airport. The airport is well-connected to the city by Regional-Express (RE), Airport Express (FEX), and rapid-city (S-Bahn) trains, all operated by Deutsche Bahn, or DB.\n\nAll trains arrive and depart from the airport railway station (Flughafen BER), located directly beneath Terminal 1, on level U2. The Airport Express runs several times an hour, stopping at Berlin Ostkreuz, Gesundbrunnen, and ending at Berlin Central Station (Berlin Hauptbahnhof). Regional trains (RE7, RB14, RB22) also run regularly between the airport and various points in the city center. Two S-Bahn lines (S45 and S9) run about every 20 minutes, passing through major hubs in the city.\n\nOn average, it takes about 25 minutes to get from the airport to Alexanderplatz and about 30 minutes to Berlin Hauptbahnhof.\n\nGetting around the city\n\nAs Berlin is so spread out, you'll definitely need to use public transport to move around the city. Berlin's extensive public-transport network is made up of DB's regional and S-Bahn trains, together with the city's BVG network of underground U-Bahn trains, trams, and buses.\n\nThe transit system in Berlin has three zones — A, B, and C — with the majority of attractions located in the A zone, such as the Brandenburg Gate, Museum Island, and Charlottenburg Palace. Within these zones, tickets purchased via BVG are valid for all forms of public transport. You can buy tickets from automated kiosks at any S-Bahn or U-Bahn station, at ticket machines on the tram (coins only), from the driver on a bus, or via the BVG app.\n\nDetermining which ticket you need can be confusing, so I'll break it down: For those within the city limits (Zone AB), there are single tickets (3 euros), valid for 120 minutes in one direction (so no round trips); short-trip tickets (2 euros), valid for short distances; and 24-hour unlimited tickets (8.80 euros).\n\nThere are also four-trip single tickets (9.40 euros), which will save you a few euros versus purchasing individually. In my opinion, unless you're doing very few trips (I find I usually take four trips per day), the 24-hour ticket is the best option in terms of ease and cost.\n\nWhen first arriving, though, it's extremely important to remember that the airport is located in zone C (Berlin city limits is in the AB zone). You will need to purchase an ABC ticket for your journey (3.80 euros), available through the automatic vending machines or at the sales points at the station.\n\nHow Germany's honor system for public transit works\n\nWith paper tickets, you'll validate them on the station platform or when boarding a bus or tram using the ticket-stamping machine. If you have cell service, it's extremely easy to buy and validate your ticket using the BVG app (available in English).\n\nAlways remember to validate your ticket before boarding — if you're caught not doing so or without the correct ticket, you could be pulled off the train by a ticket controller and fined 60 euros on the spot.\n\nThis is because in Berlin, and throughout Germany, public transport runs on an honor system, meaning there are no turnstiles for subways or regional trains — but spot checks by controllers who will ask to see your validated ticket are frequent. It happened to me once when forgetting to buy a zone C ticket on the way to the airport, and not only is it embarrassing, it's also a very costly mistake.\n\nService hours and frequency of public transit vary depending on the day of the week and the type of transport — I recommend using Google Maps or the BVG website to plan your route.\n\nCurrently, a medical (FFP2 or KN95/N95) face mask is still required on all forms of public transport. But don't be surprised to see many people not wearing them, as I noticed on a recent visit.\n\nView Insider's comprehensive guide to visiting Berlin."
