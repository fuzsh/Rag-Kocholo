        "text": "Currywurst and Glühwein\n\nWhile Germany is known for its traditional dishes, many of the most popular foods in Berlin are either imports or inspired by foreign cuisine.\n\nA Short History\n\nHumans have resided in what is now Germany for at least 60,000 years and arrowheads dating back 10,000 years have been found near Berlin. Around the first century BC, Germanic tribes began expanding southward where they encountered Roman armies attempting to move northward. Germanic tribes defeated the Romans at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest preventing Roman encroachment into German territory. In the third century several Germanic tribes broke through the Roman lines, eventually leading to the fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nIn the 12th century the city of Berlin itself was founded by merchants on what is now known as Museum Island. By the 16th century Berlin was the capital of the Kingdom of Prussia during which it became a center of military power, the arts, and merchant wealth, In 1871 the Empire of Germany was established with Berlin at its capital.\n\nAfter WWI, the German monarchy was overthrown and Weimar Republic took over. But, the Great Depression crippled the German economy and militias began to take over Berlin. In 1933 the Nazis took control of Germany and immediately began persecuting Jews, some 160,000 of whom lived in Berlin. By the end of the war only 8,000 remained. Allied airstrikes decimated the city and almost half the population fled. The Red Army shelled the city, further destroying it, finally taking control of Berlin on May 2nd, 1945.\n\nAlthough the Soviet Army had captured Berlin, it handed over what was then called West Berlin to the Allies, creating an island of western influence in the middle of the new East Germany. In 1961 the Berlin Wall was erected, further dividing the city. The wall finally fell in November, 1989 and Germany was reunified in October, 1990.\n\nToday, few actual parts of the wall remain as the city has been successfully stitched back together. However, markings on the ground show where the wall once stood, separating East from West.\n\nFoodie Berlin\n\nI’m a huge proponent of taking walking tours to get to know a city. I like to take them the very first day I arrive to walk off jet lag and to get pointers from locals on places to go and things to do. Food tours have the added bonus of, well, food.\n\nBerlin has several companies that operate excellent foodie tours in the city.\n\nOne of the best is Walk With Us Tours run by Margot and Alex. They have a variety of excellent tours including a Craft Beer Tour, Street Food Tour, and even and Vegan Food Tour!\n\nBerlin Food Tour has several options, all of which are good, but I really like their Berlin Mitte Food Tour because the Mitte neighborhood has so many excellent restaurants and interesting sites. And with ten tastings, expect a full stomach by the end. If you prefer to get off the beaten path, try their Berlin Moabit Food Tour.\n\nSpeaking of undiscovered locations, Secret Food Tours operates in over 30 international cities using local guides to spots that are less well-known. Not only do you learn about the food and Berlin, but history as well.\n\nFork & Walk operates several food tours in Berlin hosted by local guides. Most are veg. friendly and they even have a dedicated Vegan Food Tour.\n\nCurrywurst\n\nWhile holding on to German culinary traditions, Berliners also happily fold other cultures’ foods into their own with a unique spin on both. There is no better example of this than the ubiquitous currywurst.\n\nTaking a traditional German sausage, spicy curried ketchup is added on top. French fries are served on the side. Currywurst was invented in 1949 by Herta Heuwer. British soldiers were stationed in post-war West Berlin and they brought many of their favorite foods with them. Among them were curry spices (imported from the British occupation of India), ketchup (an American invention), Worcestershire sauce (commercialized by chemists in the UK), and french fries (probably originated in France or Belgium).\n\nMs. Heuwer mixed ketchup (and probably Worcestershire sauce) with curry powder and used the sauce to top sausages. She sold the currywurst (then called Chillup) from her food kiosk to hungry construction workers during the reconstruction of Berlin in the aftermath of WWII. Today, a plaque at Kant and Kaiser Friedrich Streets commemorates where her food stall was located.\n\nCurrywurst is the single most popular Berlin fast food. Little currywurst joints, popup tents, and food kiosks are everywhere in the city. They even used to have a currywurst museum in Berlin.\n\nIt often seems like there is a place selling currywurst on every corner. My favorite is Curry at the Wall, a little tent not far from Checkpoint Charlie. For less than ten bucks you get a tasty currywurst, fries, and a drink. And their vegetarian currywurst, made from seitan is outstanding. Curry 61 is also very good, and has kitschy mural featuring Cold War era politicians. Ten kilometers south of the Berlin’s center is Krasselt’s Imbiss, where you’ll get an excellent currywurst topped with homemade sauce (a secret recipe!). Since the location is away from the tourist areas of Berlin, you’ll be dining with locals. Still, expect lines, especially at lunchtime.\n\nSchnitzel\n\nWhile Austria claims to have invented schnitzel, Germany has become famous for schnitzel as well. In fact, Wiener Schnitzel is a protected geographical indication meaning that anything called Wiener Schnitzel in Germany must abide by certain standards, including being made of veal. Today, chicken, beef, and pork schnitzel is common, although they cannot be called Weiner Schnitzel. There’s even vegetarian schnitzel which is usually made with seitan or wheat gluten but Brauhaus Georgbrau makes a vegetarian schnitzel made with zucchini.\n\nBerlin is full of restaurants with schnitzel on the menu and Schneeweiß might be the best. Their menu is limited, but it always has schnitzel.\n\nBratkartoffeln\n\nPotatoes are the required accompaniment to schnitzel. Bratkartoffeln is fried potatoes, often made with bacon or pork fat. Lots of places will offer bratkartoffeln as a side dish but Metzer Eck is a dive bar with a 100 year tradition of serving good food and drinks including bratkartoffeln. Bonus points for being an almost exclusively local hangout.\n\nSpätzle\n\nSpätzle, a kind of egg noodle, is more closely associated with southern Germany than Berlin. But, Berliners eat more than their share of spätzle, usually topped with huge mounds of cheese, making it a kind of German mac and cheese. Das Lokal is upscale, featuring locally sourced ingredients. They offer spätzle as well, but make a reservation to avoid being disappointed. This is one of the best and most popular restaurants in Berlin.\n\nDöner Kebap\n\nIf there is a fast food to rival the popularity of currywurst in Berlin, it has to be döner kebap. Brought to Berlin by Turkish immigrants who helped rebuilt the city after WWII, the original döner kebap was just meat sliced from the vertical rotisserie served with onions and a little salad. Today, there are many options for döner kebap including a choice of sauces and breads to accompany dish. Like currywurst, it seems that döner kebap shops are on every corner in Berlin. Far and away the most popular is Mustafa’s Gemuese Kebab, where the lines stretch down the block and it can take over an hour to get your food.\n\nVegetarians should beware when ordering at these takeaway shops. While they may offer a veggie kebap, many times workers use the same utensils for both meat and veggies, causing cross contamination of animal products with the vegetables.\n\nSo, either make sure you ask or head to Vöner, an excellent vegetarian restaurant that serves a meat-free version of döner kebap.\n\nWalking Tours\n\nLike I said earlier, walking tours are one of my favorite ways to get to know a city. It used to be you’d meet up at the tourist office and an employee would take you around the city and show a few landmarks and point out a few museums.\n\nWalking tours are much more sophisticated nowadays. Tour companies range from individuals who start a tour business to large companies that operate tours worldwide. Reputable companies employ knowledgeable locals to show off their city. And most companies offer multiple tours to fit every interest and personality.\n\nInsider Tour offers general tours of Berlin sight and also a Cold War tour and a Jewish Berlin tour.\n\nBerlin Walks also has several tours to choose from including food and drink tours, a tour of East Berlin, and, my favorite, the Christmas Market Tour.\n\nOne of the things that struck me while taking a walking tour was how Berlin puts its scars and mistakes front and center for everyone to see. It made me think that we could do a much better job in the United States of openly discussing our mistakes as a country, teaching about them in our schools, and not sweeping them under the carpet. I know that for me personally, I have learned little from my successes, but much from my missteps.\n\nChristmas Markets\n\nChristkindlmarkt, aka Christmas Markets, have a history going back to the Middle Ages. Today, over 70 Christmas Markets pop up in Berlin from November through New Year’s. Here, vendors sell handcrafted toys, clothes, and ornaments. Traditional music plays and neighbors greet each other with Christmas cheer.\n\nWe arrived in the city the day after the terrorist attack on the Breitscheidplatz Christmas Market in Berlin in 2016 during which 11 people were killed. After this horrible tragedy we fully expected the markets to close due to security concerns. To our surprise, the other markets in Berlin opened the next day with, of course, added security. While the mood at the markets was justifiably more somber than usual, I was surprised and pleased that Berliners refused to allow a horrific act of violence keep them from partaking in holiday festivities.\n\nWe certainly couldn’t visit all the Christmas Markets in Berlin, but I can recommend two quite highly. One of the most popular markets is Berliner Weihnachtszeit near Alexanderplatz. Besides the traditionally decorated stalls and the wonderful food, this market has a special feature; a skating rink. Children, families, and adults all enjoy gliding around the ice.\n\nBut, my favorite Christmas Market is Weihnachtszauber at the Gendarmenmarkt. Perhaps the setting, sandwiched between the Deutsche Dom, the Konzerthaus and the French Cathedral, which lends an air of beauty and sophistication to the market is what makes it so grand. Or maybe it’s the plays that are performed on market’s stage. Or maybe it’s the New Year’s Eve party at the market. Or maybe it’s the glühwein. Whatever the reason, Weihnachtszauber at the Gendarmenmarkt is definitely worth a visit.\n\nDrinking in Berlin\n\nGlühwein\n\nGlühwein is a mulled wine spiced with cinnamon, sugar, citrus, cloves, and star anise. For a couple of Euro a mug of glühwein warms you up at the Christmas market. But, Christmas markets aren’t the only places to get glühwein. Stores often set a table on the sidewalk outside their shop topped with large insulated canister filled with the stuff. And, of course, Germans serve glühwein at home as a warming holiday beverage.\n\nBeer\n\nGermany is known for its beer. And there’s no shortage of the sudsy stuff in Berlin. However, heed this warning. All over Western Europe, public spaces (including pubs) have banned smoking indoors. The one exception seems to be Berlin. Many establishments allow smoking and if you’re not used to this, all that smoke in a confined space can be unhealthy and off-putting. Proceed with caution.\n\nThe best known Munich beer halls couldn’t resist the capital city so they’ve opened outposts in Berlin. Hofbräu Wirtshaus, the best known of the Munich beer halls has a massive spot that holds 4,000 people.\n\nBut, since reunification, Berlin has begun to open beer halls of all sizes to quench the thirst of local drinkers and tourists. One of the best is Brauhaus Georgbrau. Located near the Spree River, Georgebrau doesn’t have the wide open spaces of a place like Hofbräu, but instead features several smaller rooms for dining as well as a bar area and outdoor seating. Light and dark on tap and if you’re coming with a large group, call ahead and they will bring a ten or twenty liter keg to your table!\n\nMost beer halls and beer gardens in Berlin brew their own beer and traditionally offer two or three options. That is beginning to change with some places brewing more kinds of beer and others importing some selections.\n\nBerlin is not immune to the craft beer revolution. While many spots serve craft beer from around the world, there are lots of places that brew tiny batches of interesting beers on site. Of these newest craft brewers, Vagabund Brauerei is my favorite. They constantly rotate their brewed in house offerings so there’s always something new to try. Another favorite is Hops and Barley, a place whose unfiltered pilsner is top-notch.\n\nBerlin Attractions\n\nBerlin is huge. It’s the largest city in the EU. Three million live in the city with another three million in the surrounding metro area. It would be impossible to see everything in a single vacation, just like it’s impossible to see Paris in one shot. However, you can maximize your time in Berlin by deciding what you want to see ahead of time or by taking a tour which allows you check off several sites in one fell swoop.\n\nTo me, one of the most fascinating things about Berlin is how the people endured such suffering in the 20th century only to emerge as one of the most vibrant and exciting cities in Europe. To get some help understanding this, I like to visit these WWII and Cold War sites.\n\nMemorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe\n\n2,711 stark concrete slabs, each about 8 feet long and 3 feet wide and of varying heights. The memorial covers over 4 acres and walking through the site gives a feeling of unease and disconnectedness. One moment you see another person in memorial, the next they disappear behind a concrete block, symbolizing the uncertainty and impermanence of life under a murderous regime. Not to be missed.\n\nOtto Weidt’s Workshop for the Blind\n\nOtto Weidt operated a brush and broom factory in Berlin that employed blind and deaf Germans, many of whom were Jewish. As the Nazis began deporting and murdering Jews, Otto falsified papers to protect his employees and hid several in his factory. During the war, Weidt also shipped food and clothing to his friends and employees who had been taken to concentration camps.\n\nThe workshop is now a tiny museum, outfitted as it was in the 1940s, complete with the factory machines and the tiny secret room where Otto hid Jews from the Nazis.\n\nBerlin Wall\n\nAfter WWII, the victorious Allies divided up their war booty. Eastern Europe came under Soviet influence while Western Europe joined NATO and the United States in an alliance. Berlin, liberated by the Red Army and well inside the new country of East Germany, was far too valuable to the West to be allowed to be controlled by the Communists. So, it was divided in half. East Berlin remained under Soviet domination and West Berlin became a tiny dot of democracy within East Germany. As East Germans fled to West Berlin, the Communist government decided that something had to be done to prevent the exodus so the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. It stood until East Germany along with the wall fell in 1989 and Germany was reunified in 1990.\n\nWhile most of the wall is gone, where it stood is still marked on Berlin streets. Look down as you walk around the city and you’ll see markings on the street and sidewalk where the wall used to be. It’s hard to imagine today, but forty years ago, this was one of the most well-guarded and militarized places in the world.\n\nGedenkstätte Berliner Mauer is one place where parts of the wall are still standing. There’s a museum on site as well.\n\nThe East Side Gallery makes for an excellent stop as well. Giant murals are painted on surviving sections of the Berlin Wall. Nothing better shows the horror of separation and totalitarianism of 20th century Berlin and the joy of free expression in 21st century Berlin than the East Side Gallery.\n\nStasi Museum\n\nThe Stasi were the feared secret police of the East German state. At the height of their powers it is said that fully one in ten East Germans were informing on their family, friends, and co-workers to this state sanctioned terrorist organization.\n\nThe Stasi headquarters in the former East Berlin is now a museum displaying actual tools of trade of the surveillance and informant state. Microphones, cameras, letter openers; they are all on display here. Documents from the Stasi archives have also been preserved despite attempts by Stasi members to destroy them when it became obvious that the East German state was going to fall.\n\nStreet Art\n\nFirst off, a definition. When I talk about street art, I’m not talking about tagging, but instead, about murals painted on buildings, most often, but not always, with the owner’s permission. I’ve written about the amazing murals in Kaka’ako, Honolulu and Berlin has incredible street art, too. You can take a street art tour from Free Tours By Foot or Berlin Street Art.\n\nIf you want to get just a taste of Berlin street art, head over to the Haus Schwarzenberg Street Art Alley. An ever-changing array of murals and paintings line the wall of the alley. Often they are painted over, so you may not see the same works that I did when I visited.\n\nAt the end of the alley and up a metal staircase is Neurotitan. This space is an art gallery, no, it’s a comic and ‘zine store, no, it’s an electronica music shop, no, it’s all of this and more. Check out this odd space that is oh-so-Berlin.\n\nTransportation\n\nBerlin Brandenburg Airport (BER)\n\nBerlin’s new airport has non stop flights to most EU cities and many in North America.\n\nMelli-Beese-Ring 1, 12529 Schönefeld, Germany\n\nGround Transportation\n\nThere is a train station in the basement of the main terminal. Easy access to Berlin.\n\nThere are also several buses with service to and from the airport.\n\nTaxis are plentiful at the airport and there is car sharing as well. Uber in Berlin uses normal taxis, not independent drivers.\n\nLocal Transportation\n\nBerlin has an efficient public transportation system so a car is not needed.\n\nU-Bahn\n\nMostly underground rail network services Berlin with 10 lines and 173 stations.\n\nS-Bahn\n\nCommuter rail and subway system that services both Berlin and some suburbs with 15 lines and almost 170 stations.\n\nTrams\n\n22 tram lines with 377 stops service mostly in the eastern part of Berlin with a concentration on areas not well-covered by the U-Bahn.\n\nBuses\n\nBerlin’s bus network has 149 routes with 2,634 stops. Double decker buses offer great, cheap views of the city.\n\nTaxis and Uber\n\nTaxis are widely available in Berlin. Uber only operates UberX, UberTaxi, and UberTaxiVan. These are all licensed and certified drivers, not self-employed contractors like in the US. The advantage to using the Uber app instead of hailing a taxi is being able to pay through the app and monitoring your ride’s arrival.\n\nBike\n\nNextBike is Berlin’s bike sharing program with lots of stations around the city.\n\nIndex of Things to Do in Berlin\n\nWalk With Us Tours\n\nSeveral excellent food tours including Street Food, Craft Beer and a Vegan Food Tour.\n\nSecret Food Tours\n\nUndiscovered spots are their specialty.\n\nFork & Walk\n\nFood tour company with local guides.
