        "text": "Germany’s capital is a big city geographically, so it’s important to understand how to get around Berlin. Many attractions are in Mitte, but even there, things are spread out, and there are many worthwhile things to do and see in Berlin that are in other districts.\n\nUsually the best option is to use BVG, Berlin’s public transportation system, and luckily it’s not hard to use. Here’s our guide to how to get around in Berlin using public transportation.\n\nWhy you should use public transportation to get around Berlin\n\nThose of us who live in Berlin love to complain about the flaws of the system, but overall it’s actually really good. The city is well connected with several types of transport.\n\nWith so many options and so many stops and stations, there’s bound to be a reasonable way for you to get to just about anywhere you’d like to go.\n\nBerlin’s public transport system is easy to use once you understand a few things about it. For shorter distances, walking or cycling could be an option, but this won’t work well for longer distances or if you’re visiting Berlin during a rainy spell or in the cold Berlin winter.\n\nI also wouldn’t recommend renting a car in Berlin. Parking can be tricky, especially in the touristy areas.\n\nYou’ll have to navigate private parking restrictions, permit parking, figuring out how to pay for parking, and rules about when and where you’re allowed to park. Really it’s better to avoid these hassles, and the traffic, and simply take public transport.\n\n>>Read: Is Berlin Worth Visiting? 23 Reasons to Visit Berlin\n\nWhat are the different zones\n\nBerlin and the outskirts that can be reached using Berlin’s public transportation system are divided into three zones. This is important to know because there are different types of tickets for different zones. (More about all the different types of tickets later on in the post.)\n\nZone A: This is central Berlin and includes everything inside the Ring plus the Ring itself. This is likely where you’ll spend most of your time in Berlin.\n\nZone B: This is everything outside the Ring until you reach the Berlin/Brandenburg border. There are a handful of things you might want to see in zone B.\n\nZone C: This is technically Brandenburg (the state/region that surrounds Berlin) but includes only the parts of Brandenburg that are close to Berlin. You probably won’t venture out into C unless you’re going on a day trip from Berlin.\n\nYou’ll end up in zone C if you do a day trip to Potsdam or visit Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp in Oranienburg. Read more about how to get to Potsdam from Berlin.\n\nThe BER Airport is also located in zone C. Check out our post about how to get from the Berlin Brandenburg Airport to the city center, including all the public transportation options.\n\nTypes of public transportation in Berlin\n\nBerlin has several different modes of transport within the BVG system. You are likely to use at least two, if not three or four, of these while you’re sightseeing in Berlin.\n\nLuckily you don’t need different tickets – the same tickets work for all of the below types of transport.\n\nSbahn\n\nThe Sbahns are the yellow and red trains that run mostly above ground, though there are a few sections in the center of the city that are below ground. They run through the city, around the city, and even out to some of the suburbs located outside the Berlin boundaries, so Sbahns operate in all three zones, A, B, and C.\n\nHere are some notable Sbahn lines:\n\nS41 and S42: This is the Ringbahn, the two lines that circle the city. The S41 runs clockwise, while the S42 runs counterclockwise. They’re the only lines where the route number goes in only one direction.\n\nThere are a few other lines that share the same route as the Ringbahn for a few stops and then split off. Make sure you know where you’re going if you’re getting on a different train since S41 and S42 are the only ones that run all the way around.\n\nS3, S5, S7, S9: These are east/west running Sbahn lines. With one exception, they all run east and west between Ostkreuz and Westkreuz before splitting off in different directions, so if you’re traveling within the boundaries of the Ring on this route, any one of these trains will do.\n\nThe only exception is that the S9 splits off after the Warschauer Str station, which is one before Ostkreuz.\n\nS1, S2, S25, S26: These are north/south running Sbahn lines. They all go through Gesundbrunnen, but their routes are a little more spangled as to where they split on the south end of town.\n\nIf you’re using routes that involve these lines, you’re probably best using the exact line your directions are telling you to use.\n\nUbahn\n\nThe Ubahns are yellow trains that run underground, with a few exceptions. Berlin’s Ubahn lines connect lots of different areas within zones A and B, but they do not go into zone C.\n\nThere are 9 Ubahn lines numbered U1 through U9. Which lines you use will really depend on what’s on your Berlin itinerary.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that the U2, U5, and U8 all run through Alexanderplatz, and the U5 goes to the Hauptbahnhof (main train station).\n\n>>Still planning your trip? Check out When is the Best Time to Visit Berlin and How Many Days in Berlin Do You Need.\n\nTram\n\nTrams are also yellow, but they operate on the streets. In fact the word in German is Strassenbahn, or street train.\n\nSometimes they have their own lane in the median, but sometimes they share the road with cars. They help connect some of the areas in between Ubahns and Sbahns.\n\nLines with an M in the number (ex. M10) run more often than lines without an M. And although you’ll see trams on both sides of the city, there are more of them in the East than the West.\n\nBus\n\nLike trams, buses connect parts of Berlin that aren’t served by Ubahn and Sbahn lines. They’re all over the city, and maybe found a bit more in the West where there aren’t many trams.\n\nI find the buses to be the least consistent since they have to deal with getting stuck in traffic. But depending on what attractions you’re trying to get to, a bus might be helpful.\n\nPro tip: If you’re traveling to Berlin on a budget, instead of doing one of those hop on hop off buses, take the bus 100. Its route takes you passed lots of the major attractions in Berlin, sometimes stopping right near the attraction, sometimes requiring you to get out and walk a little ways to get there.\n\nThe sights include places like Alexanderplatz, TV Tower, Museum Island, Berliner Dom, Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag Building, Tiergarten, KaDeWe, the Zoo, and more. Since a normal single ticket allows you 2 hours in one direction, you have the flexibility to get out a few times to spend more time.\n\n>>Read: 75 Free Things to do in Berlin and 31 Cheap Things to do in Berlin\n\nFerry\n\nThat’s right, Berlin has a handful of ferries that are included in the transport system. They operate on a few of the lakes on the edge of the city, so you have to really want to go find one and use the ferry.\n\nRegional train\n\nSome of Deutsche Bahn‘s regional trains pass through Berlin and stop at various stations.\n\nAs long as you’re within zones A, B, or C, and you have a ticket covering the zones you’re traveling in, you are allowed to use one of the regional trains to get where you’re going.\n\nThey’re typically red trains, but sometimes other colors, and you’ll mostly see them along the east/west and north/south Sbahn routes.\n\nThe regional trains don’t stop at every Sbahn station along the way, which means you’ll get to where you’re going a tiny bit faster, as long as you didn’t mean to get out at one of those skipped stops.\n\nSince these are regional trains, their routes extend beyond Berlin’s city limits. Your Berlin BVG ticket is not valid beyond zone C, so don’t take these trains farther without buying a proper train ticket.\n\n>>Traveling beyond Berlin? I recommend Deutsche Bahn and FlixBus. Read more about How to Get Around Germany: An Easy Guide to Transportation in Germany.\n\nTypes of tickets for public transport in Berlin\n\nBVG has a long list of ticket types, so as a visitor, it might get confusing. I’ll explain them and point out the ones you’re most likely to need while spending time in Berlin.\n\nPrices listed are for zones A and B since that is likely where you’ll spend your time. Tickets for zones B and C or for zones A, B, and C are a little more expensive. Prices are valid as of January 2024.\n\nTL;DR: For most people, buying a 24 hour ticket is the best choice for trips that are 4 days or shorter. It covers one adult and up to three kids aged 6-14. For 5-7 days, is more economical to buy a 7 day ticket, but it is only valid for the one adult ticket holder. So if you have kids, stick to 24 hour tickets.\n\nSingle ticket: €3.50\n\nA single ticket allows you one journey in one direction with changes for two hours.\n\nSo if you take the U5 from Alexanderplatz to Brandenburg Gate, hop out for 20 minutes to take pictures and look around, and then get on the Sbahn to Potsdamer Platz, you’re covered by that single ticket.\n\n4 trip ticket: €10.80\n\nThis is a 4 pack of single tickets, each of which works for one journey in one direction with changes for two hours. Since you’re buying 4 tickets at once, it comes out to €2.70 per ticket, saving you a little bit of money on your trip to Berlin.\n\nThe tickets don’t have to be used in any specific time frame, so if you use one today, you can use the next one the next day or next week or next month, and it doesn’t matter. What matters is when you validate the ticket.\n\nShort single ticket: €2.40\n\nShort tickets are for short journeys. This means a short ticket gets you 3 stations on the SBahn or Ubahn with or without changes, or up to 6 stations on trams and buses but changes are not permitted. You’re also limited to 20 minutes for your journey.\n\n4 short trip ticket: €7.00\n\nJust like with the 4 trip tickets, a 4 short trip ticket gives you 4 tickets valid for short journeys. Buying 4 at once means you’re only paying €1.75 per ticket. If you think you’ll be doing several short trips, this could be useful.\n\n24 hour ticket: €9.90\n\nThe 24 hour ticket is valid for 24 hours from the moment you validate your ticket. So if you validate it at 9am on Tuesday, you can use it until 8:59am on Wednesday.\n\nThis ticket allows you unlimited journeys during the 24 hour period. If you’re going to use transport three times or more in a 24 hour period, it’s worth getting.\n\nThis makes it great for sightseeing when you’re moving around the city a lot all day. Plus it’s less hassle that constantly getting single tickets.\n\nAnother perk of the 24 hour ticket is that it also covers up to three children aged 6-14. Any kids aged 5 or younger don’t even count towards this total and are simply free. But anyone who is 15 or older counts as an adult and needs their own 24 hour ticket.\n\nSince you only validate it once – the first journey – you don’t have to worry about forgetting to buy another ticket later. Just make sure you keep the 24 hour ticket with you the whole time.\n\n24 hour small group ticket: €31.00\n\nThis is the same as the normal 24 hour ticket, but it’s valid for a group of up to 5 people. Children under 6 aren’t counted, but if you’re traveling to Berlin with kids who are 6 years old or older, they will count towards your total.\n\nThis ticket is great for families or anyone traveling as a group of 3 or more. If it’s just two of you, you’re better off buying two individual 24 hour tickets.\n\n7 day ticket: €41.50\n\nThis ticket is valid for 7 consecutive days starting with the day you validate it, so if you validate it on Tuesday, it’s good through the following Monday. It goes by calendar day, not 24 hour periods.\n\nAt €41.50, that comes out to just a little over €5.90 per day for a week in Berlin. Even if your trip is a bit less than a week, a 7 day ticket works out cheaper than several 24 hour tickets if you’re spending at least 5 days in Berlin.\n\nHowever, the 7 day ticket is only valid for the ticket holder. It covers up to 4 kids aged 6-14 ONLY Monday to Friday from 8pm to 3am. Not so helpful for sightseeing. Those kids are covered all day on Saturday and Sunday, public holidays, and December 24 and 31.\n\nThere is a reduced fare 24 hour ticket for kids aged 6-14 that could be helpful but at some point you’re hurting your brain with all the complicated math. If you’re in Berlin with kids, it’s probably easiest to stick to 24 hour tickets.\n\nBrandenburg-Berlin day ticket\n\nThis is a great day pass valid on local transport and regional trains (NOT fast trains such as ICE, IC, or EC trains) that can be used for a group of up to 5 people. It’s valid from 9am to 3am the following day on Mondays through Fridays, or from midnight to 3am the following day on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays.\n\nFor more information, check out my post about how to save money on regional trains using the Brandenburg-Berlin ticket.\n\nBike ticket\n\nIf you’re traveling with a bike and want to take it with you on Berlin’s public transport, you have to buy a ticket for your bike in addition to your own ticket.\n\nYou can take your bike on the Sbahn, Ubahn, and trams, but not on buses. If space is limited, wheelchairs and baby carriages/strollers take priority.\n\nLike with tickets for humans, bike tickets come in a few different options:\n\nSingle bike ticket: €2.30: Like with your normal single ticket, this allows you one journey in one direction with changes for up to 2 hours.\n\nShort bike ticket: €1.70: Like with the normal short tickets, this allows you one journey of 3 stations on the SBahn or Ubahn with or without changes, or up to 6 stations on trams and buses but changes are not permitted.\n\n24 hour bike ticket: €5.30: Like with the normal 24 hour tickets, this is valid for 24 hours from the moment you validate the ticket and works for as many journeys as you want within that period.\n\nHow to buy a ticket\n\nIf you’re using one of the apps (BVG Fahrinfo or VBB Bus & Bahn, either app is fine) then you can simply buy your tickets on your phone. You have to load in your bank details or PayPal details before the first time you use it, and then it’s ready for you.\n\nBut if you’d prefer to buy paper tickets out of the machine, you’ll need to know the differences for different types of transport.\n\nFor Sbahns and Ubahns, you buy your ticket from one of the machines (you can switch to English) on the platform before getting onto a train. Some machines take only cash, some take only cards, and occasionally you’ll see ones that take both.\n\nFor trams, there are ticket machines on the trams. However, they only accept cash, and only coins. You will need to validate your ticket with one of the machines on the tram as soon as you buy the ticket.\n\nFor buses, you can buy tickets from the driver with a credit/debit card. They do not accept cash. Your ticket will already be validated.\n\nValidating your transport ticket\n\nI’ve mentioned validating your ticket a few times. But what exactly does that mean?\n\nBerlin’s public transport runs on the honor system, which means it’s up to you to make sure you have a ticket before entering a train. There’s no machine where you have to swipe or insert your ticket to gain access to the train.\n\nBut you have to validate your ticket, which then shows the time and location where you started your journey.\n\nThis is important if you get checked by a ticket checker since they’ll want to make sure you have a valid ticket, and that you haven’t gone over the time limit or station limit on short tickets.\n\nIf you’re using paper tickets (which you can purchase out of the machine) you have to insert the ticket into the little machine on the platform at Sbahn and Ubahn stations. Usually this machine is red or yellow.\n\nYour ticket will have arrows on it, that’s the end that goes into the machine. Only validate a ticket once, otherwise your ticket is void.\n\nFor buses and trams, the validating machine is on the bus or tram. So as soon as you get on the vehicle, look for the machine (there’s usually one at either end) and stamp your ticket.\n\nIf you’re buying tickets electronically on your app, the ticket is validated as soon as you click “purchase” in the app.\n\nYou might spend your whole time in Berlin without ever being checked. Or you could end up getting checked 3 times in a day, as has happened to me.\n\nFines start at €60.00, so it’s really not worth riding without a ticket.\n\nAnd no, playing dumb and claiming ignorance as a tourist will not work. The ticket checkers are independent contractors who work on commission, and they have no sympathy for anyone.\n\nSafety on public transport\n\nIn general, it is safe to use the public transport system to get around in Berlin. But as with most places, there are some precautions you should take.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings. Pickpockets do occur, and if you’re oblivious to what’s going on around you, you will be an easier target. This is especially important when the train is crowded.\n\nMake sure money and other valuables are secure. A wad of cash sticking out of your pocket or an unzipped backpack makes you an easy target for theft.\n\nOccasionally someone will get on the train and make a speech to the rest of the passengers. Afterwards they’ll take a lap around the train car asking for money, sometimes selling newspapers in exchange, but sometimes not.\n\nThey are often homeless, and I’ve never seen them really bother anyone beyond asking for money. Ignore them if you want, or give them a few coins if you’re feeling generous.\n\nSame goes for musicians who will sometimes hop on the train and play a song for the length of time between stations. If you want to give them some change, they will appreciate it, but don’t feel obligated.\n\nHowever, if someone is yelling, appears drunk and unruly, or is picking a fight with someone else, keep your distance. This is rare!\n\nBut if someone makes you uncomfortable, the easiest thing is to move farther up or down the train if it’s a big long train, or if it’s a train with separate cars, hop off at the next stop and switch to another car.\n\nI’ve only felt the need to do this twice in 8+ years of living in Berlin.\n\nScams on public transport\n\nHopefully you have valid tickets and never have to worry about ticket checkers. But if you’ve slipped up, it’s important to know the difference between real and fake ticket checkers.\n\nReal ticket checkers have ID and will not demand cash payment on the spot. If they do try to get you to pay cash right then and there, they are scammers, not actual ticket checkers.\n\nAnother common scam is people trying to sell you their used ticket. Generally they’re trying to convince you the ticket still has validity, but they’re hoping you don’t notice it’s an old ticket beyond its use.\n\nOnly buy tickets from the app or the machine, and just ignore these scammers.\n\nOverall, try not to worry about using public transport to get around in Berlin. It’s a safe system, and it is unlikely that you’ll encounter any problems. Use common sense, and you should be fine.\n\nBerlin Travel Resources\n\nI want you to have the best trip to Berlin, and hopefully this guide for how to get around in Berlin helps. But there are lots more tips on the site!"
