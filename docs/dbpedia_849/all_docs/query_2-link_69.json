        "text": "The Kiez, the Spandauer Vorstadt\n\nBerlin's first mention was in the middle of the 12th century. After the Thirty Years' War (1618 – 48) a bastion with a fortification was built as protection, 13 gates were built around Berlin. The most famous was and is the Brandenburg Gate, from 1735 on the fortification was demolished.\n\nSpandauer Vorstadt, formerly Feldmark at the gates of Berlin, was crossed by trade routes, e.g. towards Hamburg — Grosse Hamburger Straße, towards Oranienburg — Oranienburger Straße\n\nJewish retirement home,\n\nwas founded in 1829, from 1941 the Gestapo set up a collection camp in the old people's home, more than 50 000 Jews were sent from here to be deported and exterminated, in 1945 it was destroyed.\n\nThis memorial – as well as the one in the memorial of the women's concentration camp Ravensbrück – was created by the artist Will Lammert.\n\nJewish cemetery,\n\noldest, demonstrable cemetery of the Jews in and near Berlin, 12000 people were buried here by 1672 – 1827 In 1943 splinter trenches were dug on the orders of the Gestapo and this site was destroyed. In 1945 the dead were buried again, 2500 people, war victims from surrounding streets.\n\n1786 Moses Mendelsohn was buried here\n\nKoppenplatz,\n\nhere, across the Große Hamburger Straße stood the hospital for the poor, behind it the cemetery for the poor, city captain Koppe had bought land here in 1696, in 1705 he donated the cemetery, in 1708 then a hospital. This hospital stood at the end of Große Hamburger Straße, hence the bend and the continuation of the street through Kleine Hamburger Straße to the city gate.\n\nKoppe died in 1721, in 1755 the city donated his funerary monument, which Stüler erected, it is probably the only street grave outside Italy.\n\nMonbijou Castle, Monbijou Park\n\nwhich means \"my jewel.\" In the middle of the 17th century the electoral garden was located here, after further alterations in 1717 it was considered the most beautiful palace of the Residenz, after war meetings it was torn down in 1960.\n\nAnglican Church,\n\nin the castle park was consecrated in 1885 and used until 1939, in the fifties it was demolished.\n\nWhat remains is Monbijou Park with the children's outdoor pool.\n\nDuring the summer months, the open space opposite the Bodemuseum is transformed into a dance floor. Salsa evenings and tango-milongas take place here regularly.\n\nNew synagogue,\n\nBuilt in 1866 by the architect Knoblauch, it was supposed to be set on fire by the Nazis, but the then district chief Krützfeld thwarted this plan. In 1943 it was badly hit by air raids, from 1988 the preserved remains were restored to stand the test of time as a reminder.\n\nSophia Street,\n\nIn former times it was also called Kirchgasse or Kirchhofgasse, it was externally restored for the 750th anniversary of Berlin 81987). Here you can still find small two-storey Biedermeier houses, opposite the old main entrance of the Sophienkirche is the former entrance of the Handwerkervereinhaus, in its courtyard are the famous Sophiensäle, which were unique in their size in the suburbs.\n\nCraftsmen's clubhouse,\n\nSophienstraße 17 / 18, here the new building of the workers' organisation was erected in 1905, the house served educational purposes, in the courtyard there were several large halls, the largest one held 3000 people. Because of the ban on assembly, political organizations and parties from all camps met here. In the 20's and 30's the wrestling clubs held a rendezvous, a kind of criminal society, they supported e.g. the women and children whose husbands were in prison.\n\nHouse Schwarzenberg,\n\nthe name comes from the novel \"Republik Schwarzenberg\" by Stefan Heym and is based in the village of the same name in Thuringia. At the end of the war in 1945 an independent republic was proclaimed for a few days in the village of Schwarzenberg. The place was forgotten by the Allies when Germany was divided into occupation zones.\n\nThus this farm ensemble is just as special in the area that is now mainly used for commercial purposes.\n\nOccupied by artists during the reunification, it was acquired by the housing association and could be given to the e.V. Haus Schwarzenberg for use. Thus an important cultural centre in the Spandauer Vorstadt was preserved.\n\nIn addition to studios for artists, there is a highly recommended bookshop with a gallery (e.g. with unique copies and small editions of various artist catalogues), the museum \"Stille Helden - Blindenwerkstatt Ottto Weidt\", the Anne Frank Centre, a cinema and as a special highlight the Monsterkabinett (fantasy figures as mechanical dolls).\n\nNew Schönhauser,\n\nCorner of Rosenthaler Straße, this street was built on the city wall, it follows the course of a narrow path below the fortification, clearly recognizable by the bend in the road. The house at the beginning of the street at the corner, the red pharmacy, Berlin's oldest, the interior decoration dates from the Wilhelminian period. The third house, the \"Volkskaffeehaus\", built in 1890 / 91, in the front building and in the side wing were large halls with cheap coffee bar, in the yard there was a cinema and a bowling alley."
