        "text": "Berlin S-Bahn Information\n\nThe Berlin S-Bahn is a rapid transit system serving the areas in and around Berlin, Germany. The system began operating on 8 August 1924 and currently has 15 lines serving 166 stations. The system has a total track length of 332 km. The system is operated by S-Bahn Berlin GmbH. According to 2012 statistics, the system had an average daily ridership of 1,300,000 passengers and an annual ridership of 395 million passengers. The S-Bahn is integrated with the U-Bahn, which is built underground and is an integral part of Berlin’s public transport system.\n\nThe Berlin S-Bahn, also known as the S-Bahn Berlin, is a well-known metro system in the city. It serves a considerable number of passengers, approximately 1,150,000 per day. The fare for a single journey is 2.8 euros and it operates on an honour system.\n\nThe S-Bahn does not operate 24 hours a day, and it is unclear whether it provides air conditioning or the ability to walk between platforms. The trains are not driverless and there is no mention of screen doors on the platforms.\n\nThe average speed of S-Bahn trains is 39.9 km/h, but the maximum speed is not specified. The system is operated by S-Bahn Berlin GmbH. Operating hours are 4:00 am to 1:00 am daily.\n\nFor more information about the Berlin S-Bahn, you can visit the official website at http://www.s-bahn-berlin.de or contact them at (0049) 030 2971 2971.\n\nBerlin S-Bahn Map\n\nMap of Berlin S-Bahn showing different lines and stations. Click on the map to enlarge it or download the Berlin S-Bahn map in PDF format.\n\nLines and Stations\n\nBerlin’s S-Bahn network is extensive, consisting of 15 operating lines serving various suburbs in the metropolitan area. The system is divided into three main lines: an elevated line running through the city centre from east to west, an underground line running from north to south, and an elevated circular line running around the city centre. Here are some of the S-Bahn lines and their configurations:\n\nS1\n\nThe S1 is one of the oldest lines in the system, with sections dating back to 1842, 1874 and 1877. It operates in three different configurations or sub-groups. The first subset, known as P (or Paula), covers the entire length of the line (51.7 km) from Oranienburg to Wannsee, serving all 35 stations.\n\nThe other two subgroups serve specific sections with higher demand: P I (or Panther) runs from Frohnau to Wannsee (37.7 km) and serves 30 stations, while P II (or Pastor) runs from Potsdamer Platz to Zehlendorf (12.7 km) and serves 12 stations. The S1 can be recognised by its pink colour.\n\nS2\n\nThe S2 line crosses Berlin from north to south. In its longer configuration, denoted by the letter W (for Wulf), it stretches 46.6 km from Bernau to Blankenfelde, serving all 28 stations along the way. The second subset, known as W I (or Wespe), is shorter, covering the 32.5 km between Buch and Lichtenrade. This line is distinguished by its dark green colour.\n\nS25\n\nThe central part of the S25 line coincides with the S2 line. It is also represented by a dark green colour. The main line, marked V (Viktor), stretches 39.9 km from Hennigsdorf to Teltow Stadt and serves 27 stations. The other configuration, V I (Vampir), runs from Potsdamer Platz to Teltow Stadt, covering a distance of 21.4 km.\n\nS3\n\nThe S3 line, shown in blue, is a shorter line that runs from the centre of the city to the east. The first route, labelled B (Berta), covers the entire line (21.7 km) from Westkreuz to Erkner.\n\nThe second line, B I (Bussard), also runs from Westkreuz to Erkner, but only in certain cases. Otherwise it runs between Westkreuz and Friedrichshagen. The third option, B II (Benno), runs from Ostkreuz and covers 14.6 km, serving 10 stations, including Friedrichshagen.\n\nS41\n\nPart of the circular line known as the Ringbahn, the S41 runs clockwise and is identified by its dark brown colour. It consists of two subsets, A and A I (Anton and Adler respectively). Both lines start and end at Gesundbrunnen station and serve 28 stations along the 36.8 km circular route.\n\nS42\n\nThe S42 line complements the S41 line, running counter-clockwise along the circular route. It also has two branches, R and R I (Richard and Reiher). The line has the same length as S41 and starts and ends at Gesundbrunnen station. It is represented by the colour copper.\n\nS45\n\nThe line S45 partly shares its route with the circular lines S41 and S42. It has only one subgroup, U I (Ulrich), which departs from Bundesplatz (Monday to Friday) or Südkreuz station. It travels about 21.8 km and serves 12 stations before reaching Berlin-Schönefeld International Airport. The line is marked with a light brown colour.\n\nS46\n\nThe S46 shares much of its route with the S41, S42 and S45. It departs from Westend and follows the southern side of the circular route. The terminus is Königs Wusterhausen, in the south-eastern part of the city. It serves 23 stations along a 40.6 km route and has a single subdivision known as D (Dora). The line is marked with the same colour as the S45.\n\nS47\n\nSimilar to the previous lines, the S47 shares a significant part of its route with the circular lines S45 and S46. After separating from the others, it heads east and has a single subset called K (Konrad), which runs from Hermannstraße to Spindlersfeld and serves another 5 stations along its 15.1 km length. The line is shown in the same colour as S45 and S46.\n\nS5\n\nThe S5 is the longest line in the system, stretching 58.2 km from east to west. It is marked with a bright orange colour. The line runs from the Spandau to Strausberg Nord terminals and has several sub-groups. The first subgroup, E (Emil), runs from terminal to terminal during the day, serving all 36 stations on the line. At night it runs to Mahlsdorf.\n\nIn addition to Emil, there are four other sub-groups: E I (Elster), E II (Eiche), E III (Erna) and S II (Sirius). Elster runs regularly from Spandau to Mahlsdorf and, during rush hours, to Hoppengarten. Eiche only runs during rush hour from Lichtenberg to Mahlsdorf. Erna runs in the evenings as a replacement for the Emil group, from Mahlsdorf to Strausberg and, every two groups, to Strausberg Nord. Sirius, which used to run in the high season, has been inactive since 2009 due to train availability problems.\n\nS7\n\nThe S7 line runs diagonally from the south-west to the north-east of the city. Its southern terminus is Potsdam Hauptbahnhof, a central station in the neighbouring city of Potsdam. The northern terminus is Ahrensfelde. The line is 47.4 km long, and both sublines (Otto and Olaf) cover all 29 stations along the route. The S7 line is shown in purple.\n\nS75\n\nThe S75 line complements the S7 line, running from Ostbahnhof near the city centre to Wartenberg in the north-east. The T (Theodor) subgroup runs the entire line, while the T I (Tapir) subgroup only runs from Ostbahnhof during peak hours. At other times it runs from Lichtenberg to Wartenberg. The S75 has the same purple colouring as the S7.\n\nS8\n\nThe S8 line crosses the city from north to south and is identified by a light green colour. It has a single sub-line, N (Nordpol), which covers a distance of 56.4 km and serves 24 stations. The northern terminus is Birkenwerder, and the S8 line extends to the southern station of Grünau. During rush hours it also serves Zühlsdorf station, and the service from Birkenwerder to Blankenburg is reduced to a third in the evenings.\n\nS85\n\nWith the same light green colour as the S8 line, the S85 line complements it. It follows a similar route, except in the northern part where it takes a different route to reach its terminus at Waidmannslust. From its northernmost station to its southernmost station (Schöneweide), the line, known as N I (Neiße), covers a distance of 30.3 km and serves 20 stations. During rush hour it also serves Grünau station, which is a little further south.\n\nS9\n\nThe S9 line has only one sub-line, C (Cäsar). It runs from Berlin-Pankow station to its southern terminus at Berlin-Schönefeld airport, covering a distance of 31.8 km and serving 20 stations. The line is marked with a dark red colour.\n\nConnections with Other Systems\n\nGermany’s public transport system is well integrated, with underground, regional and suburban trains all linked together. This seamless integration also extends to urban and suburban buses. Berlin is a prime example of this integration. It is important to note that the U-Bahn and S-Bahn are complementary systems. While the S-Bahn extends to the outskirts of the city and connects Berlin with its metropolitan areas, the U-Bahn, as a metro system, provides public transport within the city.\n\nAll S-Bahn lines are connected to the U-Bahn, providing extensive coverage of the city. Buses also play an important role in the transport system, filling the gaps left by the trains. Passengers can use the same ticket for the S-Bahn, U-Bahn, city buses, trams and ferries.\n\nGiven Berlin’s importance as a major city in Germany and Europe, it is well connected to the rest of the continent through its extensive rail network. The city has several railway stations offering connections to other European cities. These stations are easily accessible via the S-Bahn network, and some stations serve both S-Bahn and regional trains.\n\nAirport Connections\n\nBerlin has two operational airports following the closure of Berlin-Tempelhof Airport near the city centre. Berlin-Schönefeld International Airport is located to the south-east of the city and is linked to the city by the S-Bahn network. The airport terminals can be reached via the S45 and S9 lines, which connect to Berlin-Schönefeld Airport station.\n\nThe other airport in Berlin is Berlin-Tegel Otto Lilienthal International Airport. It is located in the Reinickendorf district to the north-west, within the city of Berlin itself. Despite its central location, the airport does not have a direct link to the S-Bahn or U-Bahn. This is mainly due to the planned closure of Tegel Airport as a new and larger airport, Berlin Brandenburg Airport, is nearing completion at Berlin-Schönefeld. Tegel Airport is currently served by four bus routes. The Jet Express TXL connects the airport with Beusselstraße station (served by S41 and S42). Bus line X9 connects the S-Bahn lines S41 and S42 via Jungfernheide station, and bus line 109 complements this by connecting the S-Bahn lines S5, S7 and S75 at Charlottenburg and Zoologischer Garten stations.\n\nBerlin-Schönefeld Airport is currently being rebuilt and expanded to become the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport, a large airport designed to meet future demand. The future of Tegel Airport is uncertain, but it is likely to be closed and demolished to make way for, among other things, technology research and innovation centres.\n\nSchedule and Timetables\n\nThe Berlin S-Bahn operates on a complex timetable, with each line having its own specific timetable. The system generally operates from 4am until 1am the following day, although this can vary from line to line. Frequency varies but in the city centre trains usually run every 10 minutes during rush hour and every 30 minutes at off-peak times.\n\nWith the exception of the S8 and S85, all S-Bahn lines run at the same frequency on weekends as they do on weekdays. However, some lines may have increased frequencies on Saturdays and Sundays with the same timetable.\n\nTariffs, Tickets, and Cards\n\nDue to the extensive coverage of the S-Bahn system, pricing is complex. The company operating the network offers a range of tickets and fares to meet the needs of users. Ticket prices are determined by the zone (A, B or C) through which the user wishes to travel. All tickets are valid for use on other public transport in the city, including the metro, trams, ferries and city buses.\n\nThe single ticket is the best option for occasional public transport users. It is valid for a maximum of two hours and allows unlimited travel within the specified zones. However, return journeys (to the point of departure) are not permitted with this ticket. Children under the age of 6 and luggage travel free with the ticket holder. A reduced fare ticket is required for each pet travelling with the ticket holder and a separate bicycle ticket is required when travelling with a bicycle.\n\nA Day Pass allows unlimited travel throughout the day or until 3am the following day. It is valid for one adult and up to three accompanying children under the age of 6. Reduced fares are available for children aged 6 to 14.\n\nFor frequent travellers there is a 7-day ticket which offers the same benefits as the other tickets above. This ticket is valid for seven consecutive calendar days from the time of activation until midnight on the seventh day.\n\nA special offer for frequent users of public transport in Berlin is the 4-Trip Ticket. It includes four individual single tickets at a reduced price. Each ticket has the same benefits and conditions as a normal single ticket.\n\nIn addition to the above options, there are other ticket options available. The Small Group Ticket allows up to five people to travel together until 3am the following day. Monthly and annual passes are also available, tailored to specific needs and priced accordingly. Some monthly passes are valid for 30 consecutive days, while others cover travel from the first to the last day of the month. Students can benefit from various discounts and special fares depending on their needs.\n\nBerlin’s public transport system also offers special packages for tourists. These packages include a ticket for public transport as well as discounts for Berlin’s tourist attractions and cultural highlights. These packages are available for different lengths of stay, from 1 day to 6 days. Some popular options include the Berlin CityTourCard, the Berlin WelcomeCard, the EasyCityPass Berlin and the QueerCityPass Berlin, each offering their own set of exclusive deals and benefits.\n\nFuture Expansions\n\nBerlin’s public transport system has faced challenges in terms of design and expansion due to its complicated history. Plans for future growth and infrastructure development have been hampered by factors such as the Second World War and the construction of the Berlin Wall, resulting in a complex network that is not easily expandable. The current master plan focuses primarily on maintenance, renovation of trains and stations, and necessary adaptations. Major renovation projects are underway at stations such as Ostkreuz and on the Görlitz line.\n\nTwo major expansion projects are underway. The first is around the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport. This project will add two new stations to the S-Bahn system and provide better connections to the public terminal (the current airport is served by two lines).\n\nThe second extension project is the S21 line, which has been planned since the 1930s but is only now starting construction. The project is divided into two phases: the northern section, which is already under construction, and the southern section, which will be completed later. The two sections will be connected by a tunnel.\n\nS-Bahn Advice\n\nIn Germany, public transport operates on a system of trust, so it is essential to validate your ticket after boarding to avoid any fines for failure to do so.\n\nAlthough it may seem a little complicated, it is important to remember that the fare is based on the distance travelled. Knowing the distance to your destination can help you save money.\n\nIt is also important to be aware of ticket conditions. Special fares may apply for transporting bicycles or pets. Children under the age of 6 travel free of charge, while children between the ages of 6 and 14 are entitled to reduced fares.\n\nFun Facts\n\nAlthough it opened in 1924, parts of the Berlin S-Bahn system run on much older railway lines. When the Berlin Wall was built, the S-Bahn system was divided into two separate entities, one in the West and one in the East. Several stations were closed, and the only operating station where the two lines met was Friedrichstrasse. It was heavily guarded and looked more like a border checkpoint than a normal railway station.\n\nAfter the reunification of Germany, the S-Bahn in Berlin was also unified. Since then, the system has undergone constant expansion and renovation, making it an efficient and integral part of the capital’s public transport network.\n\nTourism and Sightseeing\n\nBerlin is a city of rich history and cultural significance, making it a popular destination for tourists. While the U-Bahn is ideal for getting around the city, the S-Bahn provides access to more remote areas and attractions. Here are some notable tourist spots that can be reached by S-Bahn:\n\nPfaueninsel: Located in the Havel River, southwest of Berlin, the Pfaueninsel is an enchanting natural attraction. To reach the island, tourists can take the S1 or S7 to Wannsee station and then take a short ferry ride. The Pfaueninsel is a nature reserve with a variety of animals and offers visitors the chance to immerse themselves in nature close to the city.\n\nMüggelsee Lake: The largest lake in the Berlin area, Müggelsee offers opportunities for swimming and relaxation. Visitors can enjoy a day at the lake, which has restaurants and other amenities. Friedrichshagen and Rahnsdorf, served by the S3 line, are the closest S-Bahn stations to Müggelsee.\n\nSüdgelände Nature Park: Situated to the south of the city, Südgelände Nature Park covers an area of 18 hectares. It is notable for its historic railway lines, including the Dresden railway, which have been preserved as a tourist attraction. The park also houses urban art exhibitions and other attractions. To get to Südgelände, tourists can take the S2 or S25 to Priesterweg station.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many attractions accessible by S-Bahn in Berlin. Exploring the city by S-Bahn allows tourists to experience both the vibrant city centre and the more tranquil and natural surroundings."
