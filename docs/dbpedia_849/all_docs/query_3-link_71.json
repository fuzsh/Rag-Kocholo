        "text": "Berlin has a very large public transport system that is – except for winter time – very reliable.\n\nPublic transport includes S-Bahn, U-Bahn, Tram, Bus and even some ferries.\n\nWhile the S-Bahn is operated by Deutsche Bahn, the rest of Berlin’s public transport is operated by BVG.\n\nAs they are both together in the VBB (Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg), tickets bought in S-Bahns are valid in U-Bahns as well, and vice versa.\n\nUsing public transport in Berlin is a good advice as the streets get very busy during rush hours and traffic jams occur frequently.\n\nS-Bahn Berlin\n\nBerlin’s S-Bahn is infamous for constant delays and problems during winter time.\n\nEven though the trains are in generally good shape and usually arrive every 5 to 10 minutes, Berliners do not have the best opinion of the S-Bahn.\n\nWhat most Berliners don’t appreciate is that the S-Bahn runs almost around the clock on weekends, and until late during the week.\n\nThis will save you a lot of money on taxis, especially compared to other German cities. But even if you need to take a cab from time to time, taxis are a lot cheaper in Berlin than most other European capitols.\n\nRingbahn S41 & S42\n\nThe most famous track of the Berlin S-Bahn is for sure the Ringbahn.\n\nThe two S-Bahn lines S41 and S42 are running around Berlin in a circle, hence the name Ringbahn.\n\nThe tracks run on a total of 37kms and pass through many Berlin neighbourhoods.\n\nOn any given workday, around 400.000 passengers use the Ringbahn to get around Berlin.\n\nDuring the time when Berlin was divided into East and West, the Ringbahn was also divided. It was only in 2002 that the Ringbahn started running without a break again.\n\nNowadays you can sometimes hear the expression ‘Doghead’ for the area within the ring.\n\nIf you have a vivid imagination, then you can see the shape of a dog’s head, rather than a circle, on the map.\n\nStadtbahn Berlin\n\nThe most scenic track of Berlin’s public transport system is by far the so called Stadtbahn, which describes the route between Ostbahnhof and Charlottenburg.\n\nOn a length of 11km you will pass by many of Berlin’s most famous sights, including the East Side Gallery, Oberbaumbrücke, Alexanderplatz, the Reichstag, and the Kanzleramt.\n\nSightseeing can’t get any more comfortable than getting on the Stadtbahn and enjoying the landmarks.\n\nBVG line 100\n\nIf you are on a tight budget as a tourist and don’t need a tour guide telling you boring stories, then we have an insider tip for you.\n\nGo to Alexanderplatz and hop on the 100. This bus drives past some of the most scenic landmarks in Berlin, like Alexanderplatz, Museumsinsel, and Brandenburger Tor.\n\nEnjoy the ride from the East until you get off in the West, around Zoologischer Garten. And best of all, it only costs around 2,70€ per person instead of 15€ for the red tourist buses.\n\nCarsharing Berlin\n\nCarsharing is the newest hot trend in Berlin.\n\nCompanies like DriveNow or Car2go offer the possibility to rent a car short term and drop it off where ever you want within Berlin.\n\nKeep reading for more information about carsharing in Berlin.\n\nGetting a bike sounds like a good idea at first. But give it a second thought, Berlin is not really biker-friendly.\n\nThere are almost no designated spaces for bicycles but a lot of traffic on the streets instead.\n\nAlso chances are really high that your bike gets stolen in Berlin and you can buy it back at the fleamarket at Mauerpark.\n\nBike Sharing Berlin\n\nBut if you are feeling brave and you are a confident biker then instead of risking getting your bike stolen every 3 months we strongly recommend you to try bike sharing.\n\nIn 2018 several companies such as Deezer Nextbikes or LIDL Bikes popped up and you can easily rent a bike everywhere within the S-Bahn Ring.\n\nJust download the app, unlock your bike and drop it off after you arrived at your destination.\n\nAnd never worry again that your bike might be stolen while being parked outside."
