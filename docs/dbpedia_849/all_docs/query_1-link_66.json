        "text": "The BER station is connected by the Airport Express (FEX), regional trains, S-Bahn trains and some IC connections and bus connections from Berlin, Potsdam and the surrounding area. The airport railway station is located directly under Terminal 1.\n\nSpecifically, there are the following connections:\n\nThe Airport Express (FEX) runs every half hour between Berlin Central Station and BER. The trains take about half an hour and also stop in Berlin Gesundbrunnen and at Ostkreuz station. Together with the RE8 and RB23 lines, this means that there are fast connections between Berlin Central station or Ostkreuz and BER four times an hour during the day.\n\nThe RE8 runs hourly on the route Nauen <> Falkensee <> Berlin city centre <> BER airport; also every night.\n\nThe RB23 runs hourly on the route Golm <> Potsdam <> Berlin city centre <> BER airport; in the evenings and at weekends only between Berlin and BER.\n\nLines RE8, RB22, RB23, RB24 and RB32 also offer hourly direct connections to BER from Potsdam, Königs Wusterhausen, Ludwigsfelde, Nauen, Falkensee and Wünsdorf-Waldstadt.\n\nThe RB22 runs hourly on the route Potsdam <> Golm <> Ludwigsfelde-Struveshof <> Airport BER <> Königs Wusterhausen.\n\nThe RB24 runs hourly on the route Wünsdorf-Waldstadt <> Airport BER <> further as line FEX to Berlin.\n\nThe RB32 runs hourly on the route Ludwigsfelde <> Airport BER <> onwards as the FEX line to Berlin.\n\nFrom many other places in Brandenburg, BER can be reached with just one change in Berlin, Potsdam, Ludwigsfelde or Königs Wusterhausen.\n\nThe S-Bahn lines S45 and S9 run to BER Airport. The lines each run every 20 minutes, so that a total of 6 journeys are offered per hour.\n\nThe Intercity line Rostock-Berlin-Dresden stops at BER Airport every two hours, thus connecting BER to the German long-distance transport network. From Elsterwerda and Doberlug-Kirchhain, the IC trains can also be used with VBB tickets and the Deutschlandticket.\n\nLines RB24 (Eberswalde <> Berlin-Lichtenberg <> Schönefeld) and RB32 (Oranienburg <> Berlin-Lichtenberg <> Schönefeld) also stop at the station every hour.\n\nBus transport offers an attractive supplement to rail transport on the way to the airport. It convinces with its dense 10 minute intervals. At BER, the central right-of-way is in front of Terminal 1 on the airport arrivals level.\n\nIn detail this means:\n\nEvery 10 minutes, passengers can use the express bus X7 and X71 from Rudow underground station (U7) to BER. Line X71 comes from Alt-Mariendorf (U6) every 20 minutes, and from Rudow both lines follow the same route.\n\nThe Bus line 263 runs to BER via Waltersdorf from Grünau railway station (S-Bahn) (S46, S8).\n\nThe two PlusBus lines 735 and 736 connect the airport with Königs Wusterhausen every hour.\n\nThis service is supplemented by an express bus line called the \"Airport Shuttle\". This line is faster, offers special comfort, but is subject to a surcharge:\n\nThe BER2 line connects Potsdam Central Station with the airport with intermediate stops in Stahnsdorf and Teltow.\n\nFurther information is available here.\n\nThe airport is also served by other bus routes with one interchange:\n\nThe existing Berlin bus lines 163, 164 and 171 go to Schönefeld railway station (two stops away from BER station by S-Bahn).\n\nBus line 600 is extended from Mahlow S-Bahn station to Waßmannsdorf S-Bahn station (one stop away from BER station by S-Bahn).\n\nEvery hour from Monday to Friday, bus line 621 from Teltow can be used to Ludwigsfelde-Streuveshof station, where there is a direct connection to RB22 to BER Airport.\n\nBus line 743 runs hourly from Lichtenrade (S2) via Großziethen to Waßmannsdorf (one stop away from BER station by S-Bahn).\n\nBus line 744 connects Berlin's Gropiusstadt, Großziethen and Schoenefeld North every 20 minutes and also connects with Schönefeld railway station (two stops away from BER station by S-Bahn)."
