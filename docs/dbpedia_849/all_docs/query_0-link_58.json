        "text": "Otto's rough guide to the Brewpubs & Pub's of Berlin - (Updated Feb 2022) Enjoy 🤪\n\nFirst a bit of history /scene setting Berlin is the capital city of Germany and one of the 16 states (Länder) of the Federal Republic of Germany. Berlin is the largest city in Germany and has a population of 4.5 million within its metropolitan area and 3.4 million from 190 countries within the city limits. Berlin is best known for its historical associations as the German capital, for its internationality and tolerance, for its lively nightlife, for its many cafes, clubs, and bars, for its street art, and for its numerous museums, palaces, and other sites of historic interest. Berlin's architecture is quite varied. Although badly damaged in the final years of World War II and broken apart during the Cold War, Berlin has reconstructed itself greatly, especially with the reunification push after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. It is now possible to see representatives of many different historic periods in a short time within the city centre, from a few surviving medieval buildings near Alexanderplatz, to the ultramodern glass and steel structures in Potsdamer Platz. Because of its tumultuous history, Berlin remains a city with many distinctive neighbourhoods there are five (5) main areas and I will hopefully try and list the brewpubs bay area and give a bit of a low down on the are first?\n\nSo lets start off with the center, Mitte; The historical center of Berlin, the nucleus of the former East Berlin, and the emerging city center. Cafes, restaurants, museums, galleries and clubs are abundant throughout the district, along with many sites of historic interest..\n\nVagabund Kesselhaus, Oudenarder Str. 16-20\n\nOpen: Tues - Sun 16.00 - late?\n\nThe taproom located \"under\" the recently build new brewery. A nice industrial interiors, small but cosy beer-garden outside located in the courtyard of a protected monument building. Seven taps available offering tasty US style brews (among them the outstanding ‘Bindlestiff’ IPA) A very cool environment, with great service by wonderful people. Otto's Top Tip;'Happy Hours' everyday from 15:00-18:00 😎\n\nLindenbrau, Sony Center Bellvue Strasse 3-5\n\nOpening Hours - 11:00-01:00 (02:30 Fri/Sat)\n\n(U-Bahn Potsdamer Platz 200 m U2 or S-Bahn Potsdamer Platz 200mS1, S2, S25.)\n\nAt the heart of the impressive Sony Centre, Lindenbrau is spread over three floors, with its main feature being the only sterling silver brew kettle in the world, though what characteristic this adds to the beer is anybody's guess. There is ample seating area both inside and outside under the impressive roof of the Sony Centre. It was relatively quiet during our visit, though it is easy to imagine it being a little tight for space and noisy during busy periods, as the tables are quite close together. NOTE:\n\nMikkeller Bar Berlin, Torstrasse 102, Mitte\n\nOpen: Sun—Thu: 15.00—00.00, Fri—Sat: 15.00—02.00\n\nNice beer bar, just a few minutes from U-bahn Rosenthaler Platz. Fairly narrow and not very big, with a couple of separate rooms. Interior quite light and much in line with other Mikkeller bars. 24 taps, around half of them from Mikkeller and the rest from other craft brewers, including some Scandinavian. Good choice of guest beers. Service is friendly and efficient. Mainly inhabited by beer geeks. Easily reachable and well worth a visit but as with all Mikkeller bars \"over priced\".\n\nBrewDog Berlin Mitte, Ackerstrasse 29\n\nOpen: 10:00-late\n\nLocated to the north of the strict city centre (leave at U-Bhf Rosenthaler Platz to get there)close to Mikkeller Bar and the Berlin Wall Memorial. Quite spacious bar, much in line with other BrewDog bars, interior in concrete and steel. A bit industrial. Outdoor seating at the back. Large bar to the right of the entrance. Friendly and efficient service. 30 or so beers on tap, around half of them from BrewDog and half guest beers, mainly from German (or local) craft brewers. Really nice pizzas. The only real drawback is the price level \"Not for Punks!\"\n\nLemke Hackescher Markten Brauerei, 143 Dircksenstrasse\n\nOpen: Daily 12.00.00.00\n\n(S-Bahn Hackescher Markt)\n\nJust around the corner from Brauhaus Mitte in one of the railway arches between the Hackescher Markt and Alexanderplatz. The room you enter has a very nice bar, and half bar tables, half restaurant tables. The brewhouse is in an adjoining room which is also used for events. Flights of six 0.1l pours are available, and you can do small or large glasses of the rest, or bottles of some of them. The flight is a bit pricey at 9 Euro but everything else was not bad. As a small craft brewery, Lemke focus on the quality and freshness of their beer. Since opening in 1999 they have brewed over 40 different beers, including many styles that are unusual for Germany. Usually 12 tap offering a reange of beers .\n\nBrauhaus Lemke am Alex, Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 13\n\nOpen Daily 14.00-00.00\n\nRoaming around in Alexanderplatz, you come across this place through sheer coincidence?. It is hidden away right behind the bahn bridge. Enjoy the Flammkuchen and the beers. The ambience is amazing, with lot of plants and garden stuff incorporated into their lush outdoors. The interiors are just as beautiful and tastefully done. Cosmopolitan prices. Get your ticks and leave for a better place in town.\n\nKatz & Maus, Weinbergsweg 1a\n\nOpen: 17:00 PM-02:00 AM Sun-Sat\n\nBasically a cafe for the Hostel at the side. The brewpub opens when the cafe closes around 5pm they brew 1-2 beers. Worth a stop if passing.\n\nBierbar Alkopole, Dircksenstr. 2\n\nA colorful rail-station bar with vintage-style murals, draft beers and a jukebox, plus outside tables. built into an arch at the East End of the Station, right by the U-bahn escalator, handy if you have 15/20 minutes to spare or need to use the loo, which are free if you are partaking of a beer. They have 5 draught beers available and a good selection of bottles. Not a brewpub but a great little bar. There’s a cosy little seating alcove at either side of the central bar which acts as your table and provides a prime position for watching the world go by.\n\nBraufactuM am Hausvogteiplatz, Hausvogteipl. 3-4\n\nOpen: Sun-Sat 10.00-01.00\n\nLarge place just off Gendarmenmarkt, so a lot of turists and high.end prices. The big thing here is the open wood fired grill where the hearthy German food is served in a slightly modernised version of a traditional German inn. Expect a lot of sausages and coo-coo clocks. With a modern, slightly ironic feel to it. Tap selection was a good mix of Berliner locals, imports from Bavaria and a few foreign options. Two large fridges with bottles to go or drink in. We had the big sausage galore plate and everything was absolutely stellar. Including the attentive staff and the scent of meats on the wood fired grill. Apart from the prices this is great for the beer and food pairing.\n\nKASCHK by BRLO, L40, Linienstraße 40\n\nOpen: Mon-Thu 8-2, Fri 8-3, Sat 10-3, Sun 10-2\n\nIndustrial-chic bar with outdoor tables for coffees and an array of beers, plus pastries and snacks. Quite a cozy, retro hipster place with shuffleboard, book shelves, wooden tables and benches. Very close to Rosa Luxemburg U-Bahn station, and in the same building, Amano Home. A few German micros among the 12 taps, and other European beers. A decent bottle menu as well. No restrictions on beer drinking before noon. Friendly service.\n\nThe Castle Pub, Invalidenstraße 129\n\nOpen: Sun-Sat 08.00-02.00\n\nThe recent move to Mitte is a major improvement. More convenient for most people to reach, cleaner than the old place, and with a large biergarten out back. Best of all is the addition of daylight hours (and a serious coffee bar to help justify them). The 20 taps have a nice mix of local beers, better German stuff, and international \"craft\" surprises. Plus they still have Guinness and whatnot, a vestige of Castle’s faux-Irish-pub origins. Simple sandwiches and brownies, if you need a bite. Lots of couches and tables and a couple of back rooms. Useful place.\n\nHolzmarkt Brauerei, Holzmarktstraße 25\n\nThis is on the Holzmarkt area, an alternative and creatvie space at the Spree. The brewery itself is not visible or available to visit. The brewery is financed by Carlsberg as a popup experimental brewery. Beers are on tap at this venue and some bottles are around Berlin. Setting is fantastic if you dont care about too many hipsters!\n\nAufsturz, Oranienburger Strasse 67\n\nOpen 12 daily\n\nAn arty, old-school beer cafe, fairly sparse decoration, a little lacking in atmosphere, with good local dishes (potato-bacon soup, bread with lard, etc.) Menu was extensive with lots of German beers, the higher quality ones, plus a few of the elusive craft beers that the country is just starting to make.\n\nAmbrosetti, Schillerstrasse 103\n\nOpen: Mon-Fri 10-18, Sat 10-13\n\nA nice small bottle shop. Focused on south German traditional beers, but with some nice surprise's from the craft beer scene. Also available beers from abroad (Belgium, Uk, USA, Poland, Mexico, etc...). Worth a visit. Not the average selection you can find in other beershops in Berlin.\n\nDicke Wirtin, Carmerstr. 9, Charlottenburg\n\nOpen: täglich ab 12:00 Uhr\n\nA cozy pub and restaurant for regional cuisine, with wood paneling, knick-knacks on the walls and terrace. Dicke Wirtin is more or less, German slang for ’Thick set Landlady’. A picture of the formidable former lady in question can be found in the rear room, near the corridor towards the toilets. This is a very old fashioned \"kneipe’ in the West. Great old school atmosphere, few tourists, lots of locals. They have 6-8 draught beers of good quality, but they’re fairly common, so no rarities to be found. Service was good and the food was good and price worthy. Worth a visit if you’re in the area.\n\nDa Jia Le, Goebenstraße 23, Schoeneberg.\n\nOpen:Sun-Sat 12.00-23.00.\n\nA Northeastern Dongbei Chinese cuisine and local Berlin beer, served in an unfussy dining room.I'm glad someone decided not to keep this otherwise non-deScript refectory-style North Chinese diner to themselves, as its electric sliding doors hide both deliciously greasy and authentic spicy dishes served with no frills, along with the unexpected treasure in a well-stocked beer fridge! Well worth a visit.\n\nSCHOPPE BRÄU TAPROOM im BKK, Manteuffelstraße 53\n\nOpen: Daily 18.00- 00.00\n\nA new micro brewery/bar that brew’s “craft” forward biers. This is the place to get Schoppes beer on tap. A dark lit retro room in two parts, one bar room and one seating section. Seven Schoppe beers on tap in addition to a few more bottles from the brewery. Beer flight of four glasses available provided that they have enough glasses? Typical Kreuzberg neighbourhood pub. Expats from Braunschweig meet there. This is a Raucherkneipe (a smoking bar be-warned)\n\nBRLO Brwhouse, Schöneberger Str. 16\n\nOpen: Daily 17.00 - 00.00\n\nLocated near Gleisdreieck. This is a large complex of building contaners, catering to most hipster needs! Located in a renovated park, surrounded by overhead U-bahn lines, the setting is almost to perfect. Two floors, with a bar like area downstairs, and an informal eating area upstairs, as well as a fairly large outdoor area for nicer weather. Downstairs has a fairly large tap line, with about half the taps made up of guest brews, as well as a decent selection of bottles and some snacks. The food menu consists of “sections” of food, made up to combine by individual choice. Staff on both floors are helpful and fairly knowledgeable in guiding you through any puzzlement. Prices are definitely on the high side. Well worth a visit. When visiting, get there early, as it tends to fill up during peak hours.\n\nStraßenbräu, Neue Bahnhofstraße 30, Friedrichshain\n\nOpen: Sun-Th17:00-2:00 17:00-2:00 Fri-Sat 17:00-early morning\n\nNice brewpub with well made craft beers. Great selection of their own beers plus guest beers, served in good condition. Lots of seatings, tall tables and chairs. When arriving you get a glass, filled with snack, and with a toy animal attached to, so they can keep track of your bill ;-). For sure worth a visit Prices a bit high, but in line with the newborn craft beer scene in Berlin. Friendly and knowledgeable staff, a plus!\n\nBrauhaus Sudstern, Hasenheide 69\n\nOpeni: Mon-Satu from 14.00\n\nTake the U7 to Sudstern Station, on leaving the station head down the dual carriage way (Hasenheide) away from the church, the bar is about 100 meters on your right.\n\nThe brickwork ambience of this Kreuzberg brewery offers a unique atmosphere and seating for up to 180 people. There is room for 60 on the terrace facing the street, and the beer garden in Volkspark Hasenheide has 140 sunny spots far away from any street noise. The beers on offer were typically German, Dunkel, Pils and Hefeweissen. The brew kit could be viewed through glass panels in the floor as well as in a glass fronted room at the rear end of the pub.\n\nOtto's Top Tip; If you arrive before opening time, take a walk further along Hasenheide and about another 100 metres on the left is a \"Trinkt Markt\" (Off Licence/Drink Market). There's a table, with umbrella, where you can stand and drink your beer and then return the bottles for your deposit.\n\nHops & Barley, Wühlischstraße 22-23, 10245 Berlin-Friedrichshain\n\nOpening times Daily 17.00-02.00.\n\n(U-Bahn U7 Frankfurter Tor , S9, S8,S45, S7 S-Bahn Warschauer Strasse, Tram M13)\n\nLocation is in Friedrichshain, so generally a bit too hipster for me? It's a rustic small shop in the front with one eclectic room with a central bar and tiled floor and walls, a bigger extra room in the back. There is a small brew kit in the far right corner, with a larger kit located at the back of the building. The place is usually quite busy and very lively, especially when the football is being shown. The service is excellent with extremely helpful and friendly staff, who were more than willing to talk about the brewery and the brews. On offer during our visit were the Dunkel, Amber, Pils and a Cider. One of the partners in the Brewery spent time with us and took Otto and Neil on a tour of the brewery. Definitely one for a visit in the future as these guys are not afraid to experiment and you never know what you may find to tempt your taste buds.\n\nSpent Brewers Collective, Voigtstraße 36, Friedrichshain, Berlin.\n\nThe Spent Brewers Collective is a worker-owned and run brewery based in Berlin, Germany. Their aim is to produce high-quality beers and beverages, and eventually in a brewery of their own, and as a new-wave cooperative further the project of creating a more just society. They brew and bottle with other independent, small-scale breweries’ offer their products locally, mostly in and around Berlin.\n\nFlessa Bräu, Petersburger Straße 49, 10249 Berlin.\n\nA nano brewery that is not very easy to find. It is quite a bit away from the center and located in the courtyard. Although not a tap room you can crack open a beer on a bench located next to the brewery's door or do it in the nearby park. About 5-6 their own beers available. Ring the bell to obtain entry. Cool place. They also offer brewing courses.\n\nBiererei Bar & Vintage Cellar, Oranienstr. 185, Kreuzberg.\n\nModern and stylish bar. Massive bar in the middle with limited seating next to it. Gets crowded very quickly and than it becomes a pain to order. Great beer selection (19 on tap), nice tender and beautiful and warm place. The bar has a good vibe, nice decoration, and the bartender has time to explain things to you, even on a busy night. Super recommended place for beer lovers🍻 Free pretzel sticks🥨\n\nZukunft Ostkreuz, Laskerstraße 5, 10245 Berlin.\n\nOpen: Daily 17.30-01.00\n\nA new brewpub/ Theatre / restaurant opened in 2014. A hidden gem in Berlin!! Nice, cosy and friendly place that you can have a beer but also watch movies 🎥 (also a cinema) ... Would highly recommend! A friendly venue, very relaxed. No one is in a hurry here, which is comforting. There is an open air cinema, a stage in the cellar, beach feeling outside. A simply a great place to hang out with people, friendly staff, great atmosphere, good beer and cake.\n\nProtokoll, Boxhagener Str. 110, Friedrichshain.\n\nOpen: Daily 16.00-00.00\n\nA cosy venue serving an extensive range of craft and draft beers in laid-back surroundings, conveniently located in Friedrichshain. Not far from Frankfurter Tor U-bahn, and with lots of other nice places close by. A modern interior in wood and tiles. With 20-25 taps with a good mixture of craft beers, from Germany and the rest of the world. Some interesting craft beers from Russia. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Definitely worth a visit, one of the better beer bars in Berlin at the moment.\n\nHOME Bar, Neue Bahnhofstr. 23, Friedrichshain.\n\nOpen: Daily 17.00 - 02.00\n\nA lovely pub/bar with comfy sofas and arm chairs, and soft lighting. Perfect for enjoying the extensive drinks menu. A great selection of beers and ales on tap (many exclusive collaborations with local breweries), a huge range of top class ciders, and what looks like a very well crafted cocktail menu. The best thing of all though was the friendly welcome from staff and patrons alike. Will definitely come back from more. There is a cool vibe in this place.😎\n\nBirra- Italian Craft Beer, Prenzlauer Allee 198, Prenzlauer Berg\n\nOpen: Daily 18.00 - 01.00\n\nNice beer bar in Prenzlauer Berg, more or less around the corner from Monterey Bar. The place is not very big, but cosy and friendly. Friendly and efficient service, with good knowledge about their beers. 16 taps, with focus on Italian craft beers. Some fairly rare stuff as well. The crowd is mainly Italian and Italian football league is shown on TV. Nice and friendly place with lots of interesting beers. Well worth the trip to Prenzlauer Berg.\n\nMonterey Bar, Danziger Straße 61, Prenzlauer Berg.\n\nOpen:Daily 17.00 - 01.00\n\n\"Rock'n & Roll and Beer\" is probably the concept here? A little off north from the center but worth it. Great selection on tap and some nice cans and bottles aswell. Lovely ambiance, a bit darker, great music, very relaxed and little shabby. An absolutely great place for beer in Berlin, Love it.\n\nHerman Belgian Bar, Schönhauser Allee 173, Prenzlauer Berg\n\nOpen: Daily 18.00 - 00.00\n\nThis ia a modern trendy looking place. Long and thin with the bar and bar seats at the front and a few tables at the back. Also a few benches on the street outside. Quite impressed with the vast variety and selection in this unique Belgian brew spot in Berlin. The vibe is great and Barr behind the counter makes for an adventure each time you visit. Drafts variety also impeccable. Highly recommend for the beer adventurist.🤩\n\nPrivate brewery On Rollberg, Am Sudhaus 3, Berlin Neukolln\n\nOpen: Sat 14.00 - 17.00\n\nAnother gem in Berlin’s beer scene, set up in part of the old Kindl brewery, this modern stylish bar provides quality organically brewed beer from top quality locally sourced produce. The brewer is enthusiastic and gave us an impromptu tour of his small plant, well small compared to the giant copper kettles which appeared to hang in the air with apparent ease, all relics from the previous owners of the building. The brew length of the modern kit is 1,500 litres, where as one of the old copper kettles alone held 11,000 litres.The bar itself is a large spacious room that reflects its environment by incorporating effectively the old copper kettles along with modern art work , metal and chrome features. The bar staff are friendly and helpful.\n\nFoersters Feine Biere, Bornstraße 20, Steglitz\n\nOpen: Shut Su, Fr&Sat 15.00-24.00, others 16.00-24.00\n\nA family run, neighbourhood, traditional German bar in the Steglitz part of town. From hard to find German gems available and on tap, you also find classic German styles from breweries you probably haven't heard of. All run by a badass who clearly writes legit tasting notes. Best beer bar in Berlin! Authentic, No music, just conversation promoting a friendly and feel-good atmosphere and totally packed! Wow.\n\nOpen: Mon-Thu 5:00 PM-2:00 AM, Fri 5:00 PM-3:00 AM, Sat 3:00 PM-3:00 AM, Sun 3:00 PM-2:00 AM\n\nLocated a few metro stations away from Alexanderplatz (take the U8 to Boddinstrasse from there), the cenue looks like a relaxed students bar: small and unassuming. An amazing place, with a modern and stylish bar with a beer garden/patio and lots of different seating arrangements inside. From high tables to comfy sofas, There are 22 beers (and occasionally a cider or two) on tap and many more in bottles and cans. A mind-blowing selection with what ever you are in the mood for. IPA, NEIPA, sours, stouts, and much more. The staff are super friendly and know what they are doing and can guide you through the jungle of different types of beer if you like. Hot tip! Do the tasting tray and drink through the whole tap list during one game of monopoly (yes, of course they have board games). 10/10 recommend.\n\nIf you fancy a little trip out of town get the tram to Köpenick a nice little town with a lake and lovely town hall and one of the smallest brew pubs you will most likely ever go into? see below;\n\nBrauhaus Neulich GmbH, Selchower Str. 20\n\nOpen: Tue-Sat 18.00 - late?\n\nYou will Love this place! Super tasty beers and the best part is the vibes of the place unpretentious, no-nonsense, no bells or whistles brewpub where people just have some good beers, talk and have a good time. It;s super shabby place in the \"now upcoming\" hippy area of Neukölln. A cosy eclectic mix of old and new furniture. They have 10 taps from their own brewery, all in good with a few different styles, including some styles you see less in Germany like triple. Very fair prices for a flight which is a holed out SkateBoard! so cool. The Brewhouse is visible in the back of the bar. Friendly and knowledgeable service. Good for ticking. Over all a relaxed destination for a wide ranging beer selection served with traditional German dumplings. 🍻🥨 🙃\n\nRatskeller Kopenick, Alt-Köpenick 21\n\nOpen daily from 1100 to 2300.\n\n(S-bahn 3 to Köpenick then tram 62 to Schlossplatz).\n\nThis is a cellar bar beneath the Köpenick (town hall), where in the spacious vaulted rooms, we partook of a few more well know beers, of a distinctly better quality than at the brew pub and tucked into a hearty traditional German lunch. Not a brewpub but well worth a visit.\n\nBRLO Craft Zentrum GmbH, Telegrafenweg 21\n\nThe CraftZentrum Berlin is a pure production location and not accessible to the public.\n\nNo beer can be tasted or bought here, no spontaneous visits or sightseeing are possible.\n\nThe CraftCenter, however, is open to anyone as an order brewery. If you want to brew your own recipe on a 'big' system (20 hL) and have it optionally bottled, you can contact the sales manager Ivan Semikin via the homepage.\n\nBRÄUGIER Craftbier BrewPub, Stubbenkammerstraße 6\n\nOpen: Tues - Sat 17.00 - 23.00?\n\nA basic modern brewpub with no food. They have 12 tap's with house beers, half classic German styles and the a few neipa etc, plus a single fridge holds a selection of their own cans and bottles. Located in a quite residential area, fairly modern with a good number of seating inside as well as some benches outside. Otto says' Good atmosphere, great people behind the bar.\n\nBrewDog DogTap Berlin, Im Marienpark 23\n\nOpen: Daily 16.00-22.00?\n\nThe place is huge and outside of central Berlin in the former Stone Brewery. There are now mini golf, shuffle boards, pinball, bowling for group activities. They offer guided tours for the beer factory, etc. It's \"pimped\" up with a lot of graffiti and loud music. It doesn´t have the former Stone Brewing vibe anymore. The area and the building itself is still stunning but the Brewdog interior is lacking charm. Shop with a fridge in the front. Bar in a \"shipping container\" with around 40 taps mostly Brewdog. Still trying to be \"Punk\" but Not succeeding! {IMO}\n\nEast (Lichtenberg, Hohenschönhausen, Marzahn, Hellersdorf)\n\nThe museum at the site of the 1945 surrender to the Soviet army is of interest, as well as the former Stasi prison, an essential visit for anyone interested in East German history. Marzahn-Hellersdorf has a not entirely deserved reputation for being a vast collection of dull high-rise apartment blocks, as it contains the Erholungspark Marzahn, a large park where various ethnic styles of garden design are explored.\n\nMalz & Moritz, Goerzallee 305 e-f, Lichterfelde, Berlin Germany 14167\n\nHard to believe but some years ago the bright minds of Malz&Moritz started their brewing career with a converted washing mashine. In 2015 the three friends officially founded the AFH-Brauwelttechnik GmbH and they are now owners of a 10ha brewery. With this professional equipment they can produce their craft beer completely independent in Berlin Lichterfelde\n\nPlease email me if you have any further detail ?\n\nSchlossplatzbrauerei Coepenick, Grünstraße 24\n\nOpen: Daily 15.00 - 02.00\n\nKopenick area outpost of this local brewery, located in a greenhouse style building on the town square, quite near to the FC Union Berlin stadium. They claim to be the smallest brewery in Germany, but as they brew onsite who knows? Smoking inside is big big minus😷 , also cash only. They have 6 beers on tap. The staff are super friendly and helpful and there is a good feel to the place. But the beer quality is low and not that interesting. Come here to tick a new brewery otherwise dont hassle to get there!\n\nWeihenstephaner Lichterfelde, Hans-Sachs-Straße 5, Lichterfelde.\n\nOpen: Daily 12.00-22.00\n\nA southern-style Biergarten quite literally next to the Lichterfelde-West station (take the S1), though the noise isn’t a nuisance unless you sit right next to the tracks. A Weihenstephaner account, they generally only have one or two on tap but seem to have the rest in bottles, including those trickier low- and non-alcoholic ticks. Good, freshly made Bavarian fare, good and happy service, and a pleasant atmosphere on a sunny weekend afternoon.\n\nAlte Börse Marzahn, Beilsteiner Str. 51-85, Marzahn.\n\nOpen: Mon-Wed 12-20,Th/Fri 12-00,Sa/Sun 10-00\n\nSort of bar/restaurant for Marzahn Brau / Bierfarbrik. Located a fair walk from tram, best way is on bus from s-bahn. Very friendly suburban brew pub with a nice suburbs feel with tasty food and 5 real good beers. Quite worth a visit.\n\nBrewer's Tribute, Zur Alten Börse 41\n\nOpen: Tours by appointment?\n\nAn up-and-coming young Berlin craft brewery based on the Alter Magerviehhof Friedrichsfelde Ost. You can either book a brewing course with them or search out their beers around Berlin. Founded by Mario and Marcel, their story began in 2015. The goal was to set up their own brewery in order to live out their shared passion for brewing beer. After a lot of planning and hard work, the brewery was put into operation at its current location in December 2017 and Jonas joined the team. By renting another hall in 2019 and installing additional storage tanks, they have expanded their capacities and look forward to being able to brew even more beer specialties in the future. The team is supported by Andi, a brewer and maltster, Philipp and Jihoon, their trainee brewers and maltsters, and Julia as an office assistant. They are a small team of young people who work together as equals and continue to advance their brewery."
