        "text": "Vintage industrial facilities always stand out from a modern cityscape: textured brick walls, slim tubes, unusual sculptures, and arched windows. So, this summer, I explored several non-touristic parts of Berlin in pursuit of overlooked industrial beauty.\n\n1. BEHALA Westhafen (1914‚Äì1927)\n\nWesthafen, the biggest river port in the city, has been attracting my attention since my first visit to Berlin. One can hardly overlook this huge industrial area with massive tanks, colorful piles of containers, and cranes. It was built at the beginning of the 20th century in the style of Brick Expressionism, that‚Äôs why its dark-brown buildings with characteristic texture resemble Oreo cookies so much.\n\nThe port, of course, is closed to visitors, but you can freely walk around, especially in the evening when the setting sun illuminates brick walls and the street lights turn on. On a calm windless day, the port facilities reflect in the canal like in a huge mirror.\n\nAfter a one-hour walk, I bookmarked Westhafen in my mind as a perfect place for meditating near the water with a bottle of beer. The view is especially wonderful if you dare to take a ‚Äúdog path,‚Äù which is much closer to the water and port than the pavement.\n\nTo be honest, walking such dog paths wasn‚Äôt fully safe because they had no railing ‚Äî just a thin metal casing between the grassy bank and dark canal waters. So, I tightly wrapped the camera lace around my wrist and carefully watched my step not to slip into the water.\n\nI found an old piece of styrofoam and used it as a tripod so that my camera doesn‚Äôt shake while shooting the long exposure picture below.\n\nThe adventure was worth it. Not only did I take the photos I had planned but also spent quite a while admiring port locomotives.\n\nDespite its cute look from a distance, Westhafen buildings are up to ten floors high. And those interweaving railway tracks, as seen from the bridge, resembled one of those nerdy Lego models occupying the whole dining table or even half of the room.\n\nAnd my favorite part: the port tower has green window illumination at night and looks like a haunted house from a horror movie.\n\nHowever, the surviving facilities are not the original ones used for the first locomotive production. Initially, the company operated in the so-called ‚ÄúFireland‚Äù district. It used to be an outskirt, but today it‚Äôs in the center, near the station Oranienburger Tor.\n\nThe facilities in Tegel were built in 1898 and are associated with the company‚Äôs decay. When Albert Borsig died, his underage children couldn‚Äôt take over the business, so trustees led it. The company was split and merged, and in 1938, most of its shares went to Hermann G√∂ring, one of the most influential figures in the Nazi Party.\n\nAs for the tower, Borsigturm, it‚Äôs sometimes considered the first high-rise in Berlin. It was erected according to the plans of architect Eugen Schmohl, who also designed the Ullsteinhaus (#4 in this article).\n\nThe tower is 65 meters high and has a lounge with a panoramic view. Borsigturm is equipped with a water tank on the upper floors, which makes it also a water tower. During the Second World War, bombs damaged it, but after restoration, it serves as an office building.\n\n3. Alte M√§lzerei (1898)\n\nI discovered this place serendipitously. During the pandemic lockdown, I had to bring documents to the nearest B√ºrgeramt (citizen office), but they canceled my meeting. Only B√ºrgeramt Lichtenrade, in one hour‚Äôs commute from my place, had a free timeslot. Of course, I was not happy with so much time wasted on bureaucracy, but then I saw this:\n\nAlte M√§lzerei is an old malt house where one of the key beer ingredients was produced. The building served its designated purpose for only three decades after construction and later stood empty.\n\nWhen I was taking these pictures, the malt house was being restored. It will be repurposed as a library and event space.\n\n4. Ullsteinhaus (1925‚Äì1927)\n\nWhat do you expect from a publishing house? ‚Äî Meh, unexcited. ‚Äî And what about a red-brick Expressionist publishing house with a clock tower and owl above the entrance? ‚Äî Now we are talking!\n\nWith a height of 77 meters, this Expressionist masterpiece was Germany‚Äôs highest building for three decades and, of course, became the landmark of the district. The ensemble stands directly on the bank of Teltow Canal opposite the Tempelhof Harbor.\n\nThe building is large because it housed both the publishing house headquarters and a plant for printing magazines and books. By the way, the project of Ullsteinhaus belongs to Eugen Schmohl, who also designed the tower of Borsigwerke (chapter two of this article).\n\nIn 1934, the Nazis seized the largest German publishing house from its Jewish owners and did their utmost to erase the Ullstein name from public awareness. The Ullsteins got their property back after the war.\n\nNow the house is accompanied by a 1990s annex with offices, commercial and fashion companies, gyms, and cafes; I should say this new extension doesn‚Äôt look ugly and fits the old city quarters and harbor.\n\n5. Hafen Tempelhof (1901‚Äì1908)\n\nAlthough interesting places are spread over Berlin, the next site is right in front of the Ullsteinhaus. It‚Äôs an inland port Hafen Tempelhof. It drew my attention owing to the graceful white warehouse and four vintage cranes with wooden cabins.\n\nThis port was located in the formerly independent town of Tempelhof, but when the borders of Berlin expanded, it merged into the city. I also learned that 20 years before the construction of Ullsteinhaus, the harbor had been on the opposite side of the canal.\n\nNowadays, the territory of Ullsteinhaus and Tempelhofer Hafen is well-groomed and packed with cafes and bars. Just imagine that only a decade ago, it was abandoned and in a much worse condition ‚Äî with overgrown banks and colorful debris in the grass.\n\n6. KWO ‚Äî Kabelwerk Oberspree (1897)\n\nHow come an old cable factory is worth seeing? To begin with, its yellow clinker facade stands out from the rest of the vintage facilities typically built of brown brick. KWO factory was established by Emil Rathenau, a pioneer of the European electrical industry and founder of AEG (now part of Electrolux).\n\nIn the 1920s, AEG became a leading global supplier of electrical equipment and expanded its business to electric power production, lighting, railway, turbines, cars, and cables. Kabelwerk Oberspree was operational for a century ‚Äî from the 1890s until the 1990s. Now you can only see empty cable reels and palettes behind the wire fence.\n\nLater I learned that this beautiful building was one of a few surviving structures after the Second World War. After renovation, it was used for cultural events, for example, Philharmonic Orchestra concerts.\n\nSince the factory area was closed, it took me a while to find locations with a decent view. However, the best one turned out to be from the opposite side of the Spree. The factory stands on its bank, and the facade is oriented to the west. As a result, the sunset casts a warm tint on its walls, and they look golden and reflect in the tranquil water.\n\n7. Gasometer Sch√∂neberg (1908‚Äì1913)\n\nI attempted to approach the famous Gasometer many times but to no avail. The problem is that Gasometer stands on private territory open to visitors only within working hours.\n\nIn June, the guard noticed me approaching and started shouting, so I walked away. In July, the entrance was completely blocked by construction works. Finally, in August, I was lucky enough and spent several minutes one-on-one with Gasometer. Besides, it was the ‚Äúgolden hour‚Äù! I just passed the gate very confidently as if I was working there. I shot several dozens of pictures, but then the actual workers noticed me, showed me the exit, and made sure I really left.\n\nGasometer is a low-pressure gas tank constructed in the 1910s and shut down in 1995. This enormous 78-meter structure has become a landmark of the Sch√∂neberg district and is currently part of the European Energy Forum‚Äôs campus and event venue.\n\nGasometer Sch√∂neberg belongs to telescopic containers. It means that gas was stored in an extendable tank: ring-like walls and the dome could move up and down depending on the gas amount. I calculated that its maximum volume is the equivalent of 320 million bottles of beer.\n\nNowadays, Gasometer is used as a concert hall. I found out that the owners want to go further and erect a cylinder building in the Gasometer‚Äôs carcass, which is a bit sad, to be honest.\n\n8. Isothermischen Kugellabore (1959‚Äì1961)\n\nThe isothermal spheric laboratories are probably, the weirdest facilities in Berlin. They are located on the southeastern outskirt of the city, not far from the Sch√∂nefeld airport. I suppose only crazy people like me come here with the single intention to see those concrete ‚Äúballs.‚Äù\n\nThe laboratories are known as ‚Äúthermoconstant‚Äù because the temperature inside stays the same ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs raining, snowing, boiling hot, or freezing cold. The temperature may fluctuate only by 0.01¬∞C owing to 10-centimeter-thick shells of reinforced concrete and internal insulation over one meter thick.\n\nThe laboratories were built by Peter Thiessen so that researchers could run experiments for the metallurgic and aerospace industries. Nowadays, the building is surrounded by an office center and a lovely lawn with flowers and is preserved as a scientific monument."
