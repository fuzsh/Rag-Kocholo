1. There is joy in my heart knowing Christ will come again, There is joy in my heart knowing Christ will come again, He will rule the earth with blessings for all men And there's joy, yes, there's joy in my heart. 2. Shout the news to all nations that Christ will come again, Shout the news to all nations that Christ will come again, All the world must know man's time is at an end, Shout the news, shout the news, shout the news. 3. Oh, the trumpet will call out when Christ will come again, Oh, the trumpet will call out when Christ will come again, With a glorious shout from heaven He'll descend Oh, the trumpet will call when He comes. 4. Saints and angels will sing when the Christ will come again, Saints and angels will sing when the Christ will come again, Alleluia to our Lord Omnipotent, Saints and angels will sing when He comes. 5. There'll be peace in the whole world when Christ will come again, There'll be peace in the whole world when Christ will come again, For a thousand years, then God shall dwell with men, There'll be peace in the world when He comes. 6. There is joy in my heart knowing Christ will come again, There is joy in my heart knowing Christ will come again, He will rule the earth with blessings for all men And there's joy, yes, there's joy in my heart.
