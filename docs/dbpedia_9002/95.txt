1 I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy,

Down in my heart,

Down in my heart,

Down in my heart;

I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy,

Down in my heart,

Down in my heart to stay.

2 I've got the peace that passeth understanding,

Down in my heart,

Down in my heart,

Down in my heart;

I've got the peace that passeth understanding,

Down in my heart,

Down in my heart to stay.

3 I've got the love of Jesus, love of Jesus,

Down in my heart,

Down in my heart,

Down in my heart;

I've got the love of Jesus, love of Jesus,

Down in my heart,

Down in my heart to stay.
