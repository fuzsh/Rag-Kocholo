This year, we're going to spend in 1 Peter, and I just love, love 1 Peter. I mean I actually love the whole Bible; but there's something particularly sweet and important about this passage of Scripture for our generation of believers. Maybe I’ll say it this way, I am absolutely convinced you will find yourself in 1 Peter; you'll find your questions in 1 Peter; you'll find your struggles in 1 Peter; you'll find some riches that maybe you didn't know were yours in 1 Peter. In many ways, I think that this little letter is very modern, contemporary. Here's why.\n\nPeter’s writing to Gentiles, Gentiles living in regions; if you put them together are now what we would call, Turkey. And these Christians are suffering. There's no evidence that they're suffering government-decreed persecution or persecution that’s physical. But they're in a place and a culture where their faith is misunderstood, where they're facing religious discrimination, feeling under threat, mocked and verbally abused. And I think that's much like the conditions we're living in now where Christianity is largely misunderstood, not respected, and it feels like it's under threat.\n\nAnd in that kind of culture, Peter is addressing the question, “What is the most dangerous thing for a Christian living in this kind of culture?” And you would think his answer would be, “Well, it's an increasing threat against Christianity.” That's not his answer. His answer is the most dangerous thing is “identity amnesia.” The most dangerous thing for a Christian living in that kind of culture, the one that we're living in, is that you would forget who you are in Christ and forget what you've been given in Christ, because you haven't just been forgiven, you've been given a brand-new identity. And so, Peter wants you to understand the value, the importance, the radical transforming power of understanding your identity in Christ.\n\nAnd so, this little letter is marked by ten identity statements: elect exiles, living stones, holy priesthood, spiritual house, chosen race, royal priesthood, holy nation, people for God's possession, sojourners, Christians, then, in Christ. Now, if you want to understand the importance of those, well, 2 Peter, chapter 1, really tells you. Peter is asking the question, “Why are people ineffective and unproductive in their knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ? Why don't believers have the full harvest of the fruit of faith in their lives?”\n\nAnd his answer is, these are interesting words because, “They're near sighted and blind, having forgotten that they've been cleansed from their past sins.” (Paraphrase.) Peter says, “They're not producing fruit that you would expect to be in a life of believer because they've forgotten who they are.” If you're going to live well in this generation, you need to be living out of your new identity in Christ. You need to know who you are, and in knowing who you are, know what you've been given in Christ. I think it's terribly, terribly important.\n\nI'm so excited that we can go through this portion of Scripture that has, as a central theme, this issue of this new identity that is ours in Christ. Peter has a whole lot of other things to say to us, but they're all connected to, “This is who you are as a child of God.” I hope you'll hang in with me for this next year as we work our way through the treasures that are in this little letter.\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nWell, I want to read 1 Peter 1:1 and 2, and then tell you what we're going to look at.\n\nPeter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who are elect exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood:\n\nMay grace and peace be multiplied to you.\n\nI want to just think of these four awesome blessings of God's grace that Peter wants to root these people in. If someone asked you who you are, what would be the first things you’d say? How would you describe what you're about? How would you describe why you do what you do?\n\nWell, here's Peter’s description. Again, he wants them to know that with this new identity comes these blessings that we have been given between ‘the already and the not yet.’ Now, if you get ahold of these blessings, they can quiet your worry, quiet your fear, quiet your discouragement, quiet your shame, quiet your aloneness, quiet those feelings of being overwhelmed. I have been really sobered in the last couple of years by the amount of my brothers and sisters who are just overwhelmed, who are oppressed with worry, who are discouraged. And I know we've been through hard things. But that's why it's so important to know what you've been given.\n\nThe first thing he talks about is God's foreknowledge. Long before the world began, if you’re God's children, listen to what I'm about to say, “Your story was written into God's Book.” He knew you in that way because He chose you in that way. I love this that my little story, the little story of Paul Tripp, has now been embedded in the larger story of redemption.\n\nNow why is that important to understand? It's important to understand so I would live, not just with a ‘My-Story’ mentality, but with a ‘God-Story’ mentality. How does God's story encourage me? How does God's story define me? How does God's story give me a purpose for living? How does God's story give me hope?\n\nHe says, “by sanctification of the Spirit.” Wow, wow, wow! We could talk for days about this; that God knew that it was not enough to forgive me because even in forgiveness, there is still sin living inside of me; that He needed to literally unzip me and get inside of me by His Spirit, to not only empower me to do what is right, to progressively defeat sin, and transform me into the image of His Son. That means God is at work doing His work inside of me, even in those days when I don't have the sense enough to recognize it. God's active for your spiritual benefit.\n\nIn obedience to Christ that I've been given a purpose. I've had right and wrong defined for me, but not only that, I've been given the power to obey. Think about this. Every command that God has given me is accompanied by His empowering grace. I can live in a new way. I don't have to give way to that old way.\n\nAnd then by “the sprinkling of blood.” I love this. This is the cleansing power of God's work. Sin is an irremovable stain apart from the cleansing blood. So, I don't have to live in shame. I don't live in fear. I don't have to hide. I don't have to deny my sin. I can run broken and failing as I am and know that there's cleansing for me, there's forgiveness for me. Don't ever resist confession, don't ever resist conviction.\n\nI mean, think about this. I've been written into God's story. God is actively working on transforming me. I've been given an understanding of what is right and the power to do it. And there's cleansing for me until this heart is pure. That's who you are in Christ!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nWell, I would title the first verse of 1 Peter, “The Grace of Being An Exile.” Listen to what his greeting is, “Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who are elect exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.” Now, that probably doesn't jump off the page at you. But Peter wants to start in the beginning saying, “The Christian life, your walk with God, is not just about being forgiven, but it's about being a new person in Christ, having this brand-new identity leading to a new way of living.”\n\nAnd so, you see that in Peter’s introduction of himself. When we say “Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,” it's just so easy to say, “Yeah, right! He was an apostle,” and move on. But think of what is packed into that little phrase. Peter is putting his writing forward, not based on what he's accomplished, not based on what he knows, but he's saying, “Look what I've been given.” I mean, just consider Peter’s story. He was the disciple that just didn't seem to get it right, arrogant, impulsive; and even though he was warned, he ended up denying Christ. Shocking! Shocking moment!\n\nNow, you would think, at that point, Peter is done; he's done. That's the ultimate, to deny your connection to Jesus. But this amazing Savior of forgiveness wasn't done with this man and restored him to Himself and set him on his ministry mission. The last person you think would be an apostle, writing this rich, wise, practical, encouraging gospel, would be Peter. Peter stands as a powerful example of saving, empowering, calling grace. And the authority he is putting forth as an apostle is not his; it's Christ’s. Man, if God can use Peter, there's hope for all of us! How encouraging just that first phrase is.\n\nAnd then consider Peter’s introduction of his audience. They’re elect exiles; that's us too. Here's part of your identity, “You've been chosen by God to be different.” You've been chosen by God, not to fit in to the secular world, you've been chosen by God to be misunderstood. That's not God turning His back on you; that's God claiming you as His own, separating you out from the mass of humanity by His grace. Sure, you're different, and he says that you're “elect exiles.” That means this is not your final home; life is not about the stuff that you build here. This is a passage to your final home. You have a different citizenship, not just in the kingdom of this world; but you've been invited by grace into the kingdom of God.\n\nYou have a different set of values, not my wants, my needs, my feelings. But there's One who has a purpose for me, different goals, and hopes. I mean, the ultimate goal in the Christian life is not my success, and my power, and my affluence, but it's God's glory.\n\nA different set of hopes. You serve a different King. By grace, these Gentiles have inherited the Covenant Promises made to Abraham. And they will never ever be the same! C.S. Lewis says, “If you struggle fitting into this world, perhaps it's because you were made for another world.” Elect exiles!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nSo, what we're going to do next is going to take a little bit of explanation. I want to start by reading verses 3 through 9 of 1 Peter, and then make my explanation.\n\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you (greatly) rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith–more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire–may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.\n\nWell, I'll stop there. Verses 3 through 9 are a plot summary of the redemptive story. I'm going to have to say more about that. But before I look at that, I want to pull out three fundamental concepts out of this passage, look at them first; then we're going to look at the plot summary.\n\nThe concepts are hope, safety, and faith. I would ask you, “If you had a piece of paper, or you're typing into your phone or whatever, and I asked the question, ‘What is hope?’ What would you write?” In verse 3, he says, “We've been born again into a living hope.” What does that mean? Well, you've been hardwired for hope. That means every day, in some way, you are hooking your hope to something, whether it's your marriage, or your job, or your finances, or your children, or yourself, or your faith. Here's what hope is, hope is a desire, plus an object, plus an expectation.\n\nI want to be successful. So, I put that hope on my boss, with the expectation that he'll be good to me and advance me and my career, that's how hope operates. And what Peter wants us to know is that we have a living hope, we have a hope that's very different than the horizontal hope so many of the things that we hope in horizontally end up failing us in some way. This is a hope that's alive, this is a hope that's active, this is a hope that's productive because it's not the result of your effort, your wisdom, your control, your righteousness. It is the result of God's mercy, you have hope, hear what I’m about say, because God exists, and He's your Father by grace. I’ll say that again, you have hope because you exist, because God exists, and He's your Father by faith. It's sort of like a street child who has no hope at all that's adopted into a family, and he now has hope because he has a new father who will care for him.\n\nWhat is that mercy? God has unleashed His almighty power for the good of His children! Scripture tells us that hope in God will never ever fail us. That hope is written, rooted in His presence, His power, His grace. And you can have the expectation that God will do everything He has promised you; He will not fail in any of His promises.\n\nThat hope should propel you in your marriage. What should give you hope in your marriage? Not your husband or your wife, but your Savior. What should give you hope in parenting? Not your husband or your wife, but your Savior. What should give you hope in your struggle against sin? Not your wisdom or your righteousness, but your Savior. You have reason for hope because God exists; and by mercy, He has made you His children!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nSo, I want to talk about spiritual safety from 1 Peter 5. Listen to these words, “Who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.” Where is spiritual safety to be found? Look, here's the picture of ‘right here. right now.’ Sin still lives inside of me, and it still rears its ugly head. I'm still susceptible to temptation. There are idols everywhere around me. My heart, sadly, is still “Prone to Wander.” I live in a culture that has repudiated surrender to the Lord of lords. I attend a church that proves itself to be imperfect. The Christian life is hard. Christianity is misunderstood and under attack. We all have messy marriages and disappointments in friendships.\n\nWhere do you find a sense of spiritual safety? Well, Peter says it's not based on your wisdom, or your righteousness, or your performance. If you base your spiritual safety on your performance, you are not secure, you know you're not secure! We do not have the independent power to keep ourselves safe. We just don't. We need help. We need rescue!\n\nYes, you should obey. Yes, you should have a rich devotional life. Yes, you should involve yourself with a good Bible-believing church. Yes, you should study the Word of God. Yes, you should confess your sin. Yes, you should seek counsel where appropriate. But safety is found in these seven words, “Who by God's power are being guarded.” God exercises His almighty power to secure the spiritual safety of His children. Let me say that again. God willingly exercises His almighty power to assure that His children are spiritually safe.\n\nNow, He uses means; but ultimately, my salvation is secure because God Himself guards it and me. Let me say that again. Ultimately, my salvation is secure because God Himself guards it and guards me. Wow! It's just amazing to think that my spirituality is not at risk. Yes, I'll blow it. Yes, I’ll have stupid moments of rebellion. Yes, there are moments where I am foolish enough to think that I'm smarter than God. Yes, there'll be moments where I will resist conviction, where I need the support, encouragement, and confrontation of the Body of Christ, and I won't seek it. Where I’ll sit and listen to a sermon, and rather than apply it to me, be thankful that somebody else in the room is hearing it. But in all of that, God is at work! There's a guard over my soul! There's a guard over my heart!\n\nAnd I don't have to be afraid that, somewhere, God is going to look on me with disgust; He's going to turn His back on me; He's going to remove His love from me; and He's going to walk away. Because Peter says, “No! No! No! No! No! In all of your struggles, in all of your failure, you are being guarded for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time!” So that, you will have a place in that forever, where righteousness and peace will reign forever and ever and ever! You won't get there because you're righteous; you will get there because God is faithful to His promise, and He has guarded you every step of the way. And He will welcome you into that final kingdom because He is faithful!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nSo, we've looked at the concept of hope. We've looked at the concept of spiritual safety. And then we want to finally look at the concept of faith. This is verse 9 of the first chapter of 1 Peter, “Obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.” I am so glad that we can spend these months together in 1 Peter. This letter that is so current, that speaks with such power to the experiences we're having in this particular generation of Christianity.\n\nAnd what is this thing, ‘faith,’ that Peter is talking about, “Obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls?” I think there's so much confusion around faith. I know in these studies, I've given this example before, but I was speaking on faith to a small group, and I decided to ask the question from somebody. I said, “Just define faith for me.” Someone said, “Well, it means to trust.” I said, “Well, what does it mean to trust?” Someone else said, “Well, it means to believe.” I said, “What does it mean to believe?” And somebody said, “Well, it means to have faith.” We’d just come full circle.\n\nLet me define faith for you. ‘Faith is a radical heart commitment to entrust myself and my life to God, that results in a radical change in the way that I live my life.’ I love Hebrews 11:6, it says in defining faith, “We must believe that he exists.” That's the heart’s conceptual aspect of faith, and that “he rewards those who seek him.” That's the living aspect of faith. Notice the description here in verses 8 and 9, I just love this. “Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory, obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of our souls.”\n\nFive things about faith. First of all, it's not based on what you can see. We serve a God whom we can't visibly see, and we can't audibly hear, we can't physically touch. Faith involves the love of your heart. Your life is shaped by what you love the most. And it says here, “Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory, obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.” Though you haven't seen Him, you love Him.\n\nIt's expressed in joyful gratitude, “rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory.” I would ask you this question, “Do you celebrate more than you complain? Do you give thanks more than you grumble?” Faith is joyful because it's rooted in the awesome, amazing gift of God's grace in His Son. “Obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls;” the epicenter of faith is God's saving work and saving promises. I believe that I am His both now and forever. I believe that I've been forgiven. I believe that I'm indwelt by the Spirit. I believe that I'm being transformed by His grace. That's the epicenter of my faith.\n\nAnd then it's convinced of the outcome. Even though in between ‘the already and not yet’ is messy and confusing, I know God will be faithful to His promises.\n\nNow, if you're going to exercise that kind of faith, you need to be in His Word, and you need to embrace His work because His Word and His work is what faith is about. The life of faith is a life of joy, ultimately involving my surrendering my glory, to the glory of this One who is so loving, so giving, so merciful, so powerful, so faithful, and He has unleashed all of that, for my good. Faith is a radical commitment of the heart that radically changes the way that you live your life!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nSo, we're working our way through 1 Peter, and we're going to look at 1 Peter 1:3-9, and I have entitled this, “The Plot Summary.” Let me read it again.\n\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who, by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith–more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire–may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory, obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.\n\nWhat Peter is doing here, is like what a great novelist does. Let's say you're reading a novel that's 5 or 600 pages long, and as you get into the details of the story, the details of somebody’s description, you can lose sight of the larger plot. And so, what a novelist will do is they will create a way of reminding you of the big plot, the big sweep of the story. Maybe it's two old guys sitting on a bench. And they're having a conversation about the span of their life. That's the novelist reminding you of what the story is about.\n\nSo, because Peter is going to say many practical things, he wants to root all your understanding of those practical things in the larger plot of God's story; Scripture is dotted with plot summaries, and this is one of those.\n\nSo, this passage has a ‘then, then, now’ shape to it: ‘then’ of the past, ‘then’ of the future, and now. Peter’s interest is now but he knows you won't fully understand now, you won't fully understand who you are now, you won't fully understand what you're doing now, you won't fully understand what God is doing now, unless you have the larger plot in place.\n\nSo, here's the ‘then’ of the past. “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.” God has caused you to be blessed with resurrection life. The same power by which Jesus was raised from the dead is now yours as the children of God. If you wonder, as you stand in front of that empty tomb, if your mind is blown, welcome to your life as a believer because that same power is now yours in Christ. You have been given resurrection power, that's who you are. That's the past.\n\nHere's the future, “…to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.” So, you are not only secure because God has caused you to now being imbued with resurrection power, but you are secure because your future is utterly secured by Him. You have a mind-boggling inheritance that's kept for you. And you are being guarded between the two ‘then’s’ to make sure that when that final day comes, not only will the inheritance be ready, but you will be ready.\n\nLife in this middle is hard. But it's made less hard when you realize what you've been given, resurrection power, and what you're heading toward, an inheritance beyond your wildest imagination that'll be yours forever and ever and ever! Now you're ready to understand ‘now.’\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nIf you haven't asked this ‘now’ question, you're probably not breathing or you're seriously comatose. And here's the question, “What in the world is God doing?”\n\nI mean, if you look at this pandemic that we've been through you think, “What in the world is God doing?” If you hear of suffering in people's lives, “What in the world is God doing?” Maybe in your own life, as you face disappointment, you say, “God, where are you? What are you doing? Why is life so hard? Why do so many unexpected things happen? Where are you? What are you doing? Why the trials? Why the hardship? Why the difficulty?”\n\nWell, let me read Peter’s description of ‘now.’\n\nIn this you rejoice (those past and future things), though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith–more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire­–may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.”\n\nThere are three words that come out of the pen of Peter that ought to alert you to what is going on now. Fasten your seat belts: grief, trial, test. Those are his descriptors of every Christian's life between the ‘already’ and the ‘not yet.’ Three words that you don't want in your life: grief, trial, and test. And by the use of those three words, Peter is intending to change our thinking about ‘now.’ Please hear this. ‘Now’ was not intended to be comfortable; ‘now’ was intended to be transformational.\n\nIf God's intention was that ‘now’ would be comfortable, He's a massive failure and you should turn from Him. And His book isn't worth reading! It's not meant to be comfortable; it's meant to be transformational. And he says, “So, God will bring trial into your life to test you.” Now you’ve got to understand what this means. And to help us, Peter uses this very provocative word picture. It's a word picture of metallurgy. When a metallurgist mines a precious metal, he finds it in an ore state. Ore is not very usable or attractive because it has imperfections in it. So, he has to add a catalytic agent and white-hot heat to liquefy that metal, boil out the imperfections, so that metal reaches its highest state of beauty and its highest state of usability.\n\nNow, hear what I'm about to say, “When you come to Christ, you are an ‘orific’ Christian. I didn't say horrific, I said, “orific.” You have imperfections in you that rob you of your beauty and rob you of your usefulness. God would not be a faithful Redeemer to leave you in that state. So, God, in His grace, will boil you. He will bring the heat of trial into your life, not because He's punishing you, but because He loves you, and wants you to reach a higher state of beauty and a higher state of usability.\n\nHear what I'm about to say, “God will take you where you have not intended to go in order to produce in you what you could not achieve on your own.” God will take you where you haven't intended to go in order to produce in you what you could not achieve on your own. Often, when we're wondering where the grace of God is, His grace is most active. But it's not the grace of release; it's not the grace of relief; those are coming. It's the grace of transformation! And transformation is hard!\n\nYes, you will face trial. Yes, you will face the unexpected. Yes, you will face difficulty because all those things are a workroom for transforming grace. ‘Now’ isn't meant to be comfortable. ‘Now’ was meant to be transformational and that's a good thing because we are not yet all that we could be in Christ!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nWell, I have a confession to make, and the confession is that I think I complain way more than I ever should! I’m sure I am not alone. I would ask you how much is complaint; how much is grumbling a normal part of your world of talk? How dissatisfied are you, how discontent are you, is doubt of God a struggle for you?\n\nMaybe the way that I should ask this is, “Do you live with joy?” I’m not talking about that temporary, situational happiness when you’ve just had a great meal, or somebody’s given you a great compliment, or some situation has worked the way you want it to.\n\nI’m talking about something deeper and fuller than that. What I want to look at with you as we continue in 1 Peter, 1 Peter 1:9, about joy that is there no matter what. Talking about God’s work in our lives, Peter says this, I’ll start with verse 8, “Though we have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with a joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory.” Inexpressible and filled with glory! Wouldn't you like this kind of life?\n\nAnd wouldn't every human being say, “I want to wake up with joy so deep I can't express it; joy that is glorious?” I mean, it's the life that somehow all of us dream of. It's the kind of joy when you've been given the best gift ever, one that you know can change your life, and you stand there and you say you're so filled with something deep inside of you, what you say is, “I don't know what to say.” You are literally unable to express what's inside of you.\n\nNow maybe this will shock you. Peter’s arguing that that should be a normal experience for a believer; that there's something deep and beautiful that should root inside of us; that a bad day, a disappointment, a hardship in a relationship, a rebellious child, a cantankerous boss, traffic, should not be able to take away from us.\n\nAnd so, the question that this begs for us is, “Where do I get this kind of joy?” He says this, “…you believe in him and rejoice with an inexpressible joy, one that's filled with glory, because (Now listen to this.) you're obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.” (Paraphrase.) He's saying this, “You have that joy when you realize the thing in life you most need, the thing in life that most human beings need, the ultimate gift of giving that needs to be given, I have been given.”\n\nSomething I could have never earned and never deserved is now mine simply because God has placed His love on me. It's like being born into an ultimately rich family. You've done nothing, but you have lavish possibilities in front of you because you've been born into something that you could have never deserved, never earned, never achieved. And so, you get up every morning and you say, “I've got it. I've got the best thing ever. I may not have a lot of money. I may not have a lot of friends. I may not even have physical health, but I've got the best thing ever.” Put it on a 3 x 5 card and stick it on your mirror in the morning so you see it every morning, “I have been given, in Jesus, the best thing ever, the salvation of my soul.”\n\nAnd when you wake up in the morning and say, “No matter what's going on, I've been given the best thing ever,” you'll have joy!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nSo, this may sound strange to you, but I want to propose that you can be very serious about your use of the Bible and be using the Bible unbiblically. You can have a regular relationship with the Word of God, you can be serious about it and not be using the Bible in the way it was intended to be used. And so, I want to look at this next section in 1 Peter and ask the question, “What in the world is the Bible?”\n\nLet me read these verses to you, 1 Peter 1:10-12:\n\nConcerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully, inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories. It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.\n\nWow! Peter is saying some radical things about the Word of God and how we've arrived at this Book that we now hold in our hands. Pretend someone comes up to you on the street and says, “What in the world is the Bible?” How would you describe the Bible to them? Is it a collection of real helpful moralistic stories? Is it a collection of theological truths? Is it a collection of wisdom principles for daily living? What a different description of God's Word is in this passage.\n\nThe matter of fact is your Bible is essentially a story. It's not a collection of stories; it's one single story with a lot of phases and a lot of chapters. The Bible is the story of redemption. And it has one single character, Jesus. But I want you to get something in this passage. It talks about the prophets, “inquiring what person or what time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ.”\n\nListen to this. He's saying that the Bible is an autobiography. Jesus wrote His own story. And it tells us that the prophets didn't understand it. The angels looked into it. Nobody was capable of writing the story that we now have here. The story of everything that was needed to lead up to Jesus, Jesus’s life, Jesus’s life interpreted for us, and the final culmination of the work of Jesus, no one was able to guide that story but the central character Himself; I'm holding the autobiography of the Savior in my hands. He guided the writing so that every element that was necessary would be in His story. So, every explanation necessary would be in His story. So, we would understand beginnings and destiny, so it would be in His story. How exciting is that! This is the story of Jesus.\n\nBecause the hope of the entire world rested on a single shoulder, history marched toward the incarnation of Jesus. Jesus’s life marched toward the cross and the resurrection. The epistles look back on the work of Jesus. Those who are on the other side in Revelation celebrate the work of Jesus, this is the story of Jesus! There are not a whole lot of dramas where the central character is the author, but that's the case with the Word of God. And that's why it's trustworthy because the One who is the hope of the universe guided His Book so we would have, in that Book, everything that we need for our life here and for life to come.\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nIt is incredible to me, as I've studied my way through the first 12 or 13 verses of 1 Peter, how it seems that Peter is intent on laying this just strong foundation for these people. I mean, there are so many fundamental elements of the Christian faith that Peter's just throwing out, one right after another, as if he's laying bricks on a foundation that these people need to understand.\n\nNow remember, these are people who are suffering. They're suffering because what they've given their life to is misunderstood and mocked. They're suffering mistreatment because of their faith. And it's like Peter wants to get at “This is what it means to live in this culture as a believer,” but he first wants to lay down this foundation that they will get. And I want to look at another element of that foundation; I want to ask the question, “Who in the world is the Holy Spirit?” Peter throws out this phrase, “Who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven.”\n\nWell, I'm reading along, I'm thinking, “Why? Why was the Holy Spirit sent from heaven?” I think that many believers understand who God is, understand who the Son is, but are confused about this Holy Spirit person, the third member of the Trinity. The Holy Spirit was sent from heaven. If I arrived at your door and I said, “Jefferson Hospital sent me to you,” what would your next question be? “For what?”\n\nSo why was it necessary in God's plan for the Holy Spirit to be sent? What is the work of the Holy Spirit? What was He sent from heaven for? Let me name some things? Well, clearly here we're told He's sent to be a guide so that God's Word would be properly laid down and preserved for us. Scripture says, “Holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.” He was sent to empower the preaching and teaching of God's Word. No human being is capable of representing God's Word well apart from the Spirit's work. The Spirit is sent to illumine our understanding of God's Word; I need help if I'm ever going to understand the Word. Jesus said as He was leaving that He would send “another teacher who would guide His disciples into truth.”\n\nThe Holy Spirit is given to convict us of sin. It's the Spirit who’s able to break through our spiritual blindness and to help us to see ourselves with accuracy through the Word of God. The Holy Spirit is sent to empower us to obey God's Word.\n\nNow, notice a theme here, to guide the writing of God's Word, to empower the teaching of God's Word, to illuminate our understanding of God's Word, to convict us of sin through God's Word, to empower us to obey God's Word. What is the chief work of the Holy Spirit? To enable this Book to give us life! Everything that the Holy Spirit does is attached to the Word of God.\n\nWhy is this necessary? Well, although my sins have been forgiven, I'm not yet sin free. In between ‘the already and the not yet,’ I don't just need forgiving grace, I need illumining, convicting, transforming, empowering grace. So, God sent His Spirit. So, between ‘the already’ of my conversion and ‘the not yet’ of my home-going, this dear Book would bear obvious and continual fruit in my life. Be thankful that the Holy Spirit was sent from heaven for us!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nWell, we move to a section in 1 Peter that has a bit of a different feel. And maybe I should introduce it this way. You would expect, since Peter is writing to people who are suffering, that this would just be a letter of huge hope and comfort, encouragement, dressing the spiritual wounds of these people. And that material surely is here. But what impresses me is that 1 Peter is a call to action, it’s marching orders.\n\nAnd there's a sort of redemptive psychology to that. If you have a suffering person, if you want a suffering person to be depressed, get them to focus on their suffering. The more you focus on it, the bigger it gets. If you want to help a person suffering, get them thinking outside of themselves. Get them moving, get them active, get them realizing that their suffering isn’t ultimate, God is. And that's the mentality of Peter, don't just see who God is, don't just see what He's done, don't just see who you are as His children, don't just see what He's gifted you with. Now get up and move. And so that's where the next part of Peter goes.\n\n“Therefore, preparing your minds for action, being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” Now, I want to talk about the problem of Christian passivity. There is no such thing as a passive, healthy, Christian life. Yes, we are welcome to rest in our Savior, but we are also welcomed out of our spiritual sleep.\n\nHere's Peter’s view of the Christian life in five words: prepare your minds for action; prepare your minds for action. For Peter, passivity is hugely spiritually dangerous. Why is that? Because I live in a fallen world; it's not operating the way God intended. And that fallenness will enter my door. The Bible says, “the world is groaning, waiting for redemption.” Because the world is fallen, there's evil around me. And so, I will regularly face temptation.\n\nLet me go further. It's not just that there’s evil outside of me; there's evil still inside me. Sin still lives inside of me. I could add to that, and I'm not done yet; I'm not a baked cookie. I'm dough, still being worked on, still in God's oven of grace, the process is still going on. And so, think of the action words that are all over the Word of God.\n\nFollow, trust, obey, confess, repent, sacrifice, wrestle, fight, persevere, resist, worship. There's action word, after action word, after action word. And so, Peter says, “You need to get your mind in gear for the life you've been called to.” You're not called to just between your conversion and your home going, wait for whatever God's going to do next. That will never ever work. You're called to pursue the one who is pursuing you and to look for every way to grab ahold of what God has given you. Wait–waiting in the Bible is an action. May that characterize our lives, preparing our minds for action!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nSo, let me read 1 Peter 1:13 again, “Therefore, preparing your minds for action, and being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” What does it mean to be sober-minded? Well, I could ask you, “Are you serious?” I mean, if I watched the video of your last six weeks, would I say this is a person who takes life seriously; is that what it means to be sober minded?\n\nLet me talk about what sober-mindedness is not. It's not the lack of ability to have fun, to laugh, an absence of sense-of-humor. Sober-mindedness is not taking yourself too seriously. We all have done that and have been around people who do that. Sober-mindedness is not being legalistic and judgmental. Sober-mindedness is not reaching the state of “theological-always-rightism,” where you sort of hold your theology proudly. Sober-mindedness is not being one of those scary unapproachable Christians that you would never think of being open with.\n\nSober-mindedness, according to Peter, means living with a single-minded focus. What is that focus? “Being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” It means this; sober-mindedness is living with eternity in view.\n\nWhen you live with eternity in view, here's what you find yourself doing. You begin to eavesdrop on eternity, and you begin to listen to the voices that are on the other side, and you begin to hear what they celebrate.\n\nThey don't celebrate great jobs. They don't celebrate big houses. They don't celebrate personal power, a nice wardrobe, that they were physically attractive. You listen to the saints on the other side, they celebrate one thing. You did it! You did it! You did it! You fulfilled every one of your promises; You redeemed us!\n\nNow hear this, I need that values clarification today because what happens is things that are not important rise in levels of importance. And they begin to claim my heart and claim my behavior, they claim my emotions, and my life gets diverted. I need the values clarification of eternity to continue to remind me what is truly important.\n\nBut it's not just values clarification, it's hope and motivation. Because think about this; the glory of living with future grace in view is that future grace is at once a promise of present grace. Because if God is telling me that I have a place in eternity, then what He's telling me is I also have every grace I need in order to finally get there. Future grace is a promise of present grace.\n\nAnd so, when I live with eternity in view, even though I won't understand what God is doing, and even though I'll face hardship, I know that I have hope. And that hope gets me up in the morning and enables me to do the hard things that God calls me to do; it enables me to prepare.\n\nYou say, “Paul, I don't understand.” Think about this. A father comes to his children, and he says, “We're going to Disney World.” He takes them to the computer; he shows them all those entertainment glories of Disney World. And the kids live that year, they keep asking, “How many days till we go to Disney World, is it almost ready?”\n\nBut there’s something else that happens. They come to him, and they say, “Dad, can we buy this, can we go out to eat, can I get a new skateboard?” What does Dad say? “No, no, we can’t do that because we’re saving money because we are going to Disney World!” And they say, “Oh yeah, that’s right!” And they are able to deal with those hardships, and they are able to be motivated to keep going because they are focusing on the glory that is to come. That’s what sober-minded is.\n\nSober-minded means you are focusing on the grace that will be revealed in Jesus Christ; you’re living with eternity in view. And because of that, your values are clarified, and you live with motivation and hope.\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nWell, we're on the final stretch of the first chapter of 1 Peter. I have felt such a personal blessing that I've been able to go through this material. Maybe I could say it this way. 1 Peter, chapter 1, is one of the best gospel rants in all of Scripture. It is just like Peter is putting out the material so fast. It's like he can't get the words out fast enough; he's so excited about the gospel he wants these suffering people to get. And right now, we want to talk about passions, the problem with passions.\n\nWe want to think about this messy world of passions. So, let me read from 1 Peter, “As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance.” A passion is a motivating emotion, and we really couldn't do anything in our lives if we hadn't been given the gift of passions. I’ve seen it even in my granddaughters. My granddaughter, Lilly, for some reason, is deeply passionate about Star Wars. She comes home from school, and she immediately puts on her Darth Vader helmet, and is in character until she goes to bed. And she finds such joy in doing this.\n\nOur ability to be passionate is really one of God's good gifts for us. Every commitment, every calling, every achievement, requires passion. You could sort of talk about passion this way. Passion is desire, plus motivation, plus joy. That's passion. The problem is that we can't be ruled anymore by our passions because sin has made our passions, at best, a mixed blessing. I like the way Peter talks about this. He says, “Do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance.” What is he talking about?\n\nHe means before you knew God, before God is the central focus of your life rather than whatever your heart wants to do, the question is, “What would God want me to do in this situation?” Before your former ignorance, before you knew His Word, because His Word needs to be a greater guide in our lives than this combination of desire, motivation, and joy. It's just not biblical, although I hear Christians say this all the time to say, “Well, just follow your heart.” That's not good advice because your heart will take you places that you should not go.\n\nThink about this, and this is what Peter is arguing, this is Paul Tripp’s way of saying this, “Your heart is only as trustworthy as what controls it.” Your heart is only as trustworthy as what controls it. If God controls your heart, then your heart is trustworthy. If the Word controls your heart, then your heart is trustworthy. If the glory of God controls your heart rather than self-glory, then your heart is trustworthy. But your heart is not always uniformly trustworthy because passions for things that are outside of God's will, even if in a moment, will grip us.\n\nPeter wants us to know that passions, shaped by God, shaped by His grace, shaped by His Word, are a beautiful productive thing. But watch out that you are not ruled by your passions, but you're ruled by God's presence, His power, His grace, and the clear tracks that you're to run on of His Word. Place your passions under God and His Word. And that's a very good place to live!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nWell, there is a term, a category, significant and important, that has sadly almost completely fallen out of usage in human culture. The abandonment of this category has had untold and tragic consequences. The term is ‘holy.’\n\nThink about this for a moment. You never hear the word ‘holy’ on the news. You seldom hear it in politics, education, entertainment, government, on the street. Yet holy is the standard for living for every human being who God has ever given breath. Everyone was designed to quest for holiness. That is what Peter makes very clear in this passage:\n\nAs obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, “You shall be holy, for I am holy.”\n\nIf holy is the standard, then God is the standard because He alone is the Holy One, perfect in every way.\n\nI remember when I was a young kid going to a private Lutheran School, and we were using Luther’s Small Catechism. There was a question, “How is God holy?” I love this answer. In everything He does. God is perfectly holy, all the time, in every situation, and in every way. That's the standard.\n\nNow if you don't find that overwhelming and discouraging, you're not getting it. Think how utterly distant that standard is from all of us. I wish I could say that in God's eyes, everything I think, everything I desire, everything I say, everything I choose, everything I do, is holy in every way. But I can't, yet that's the standard, “Be holy, as I am holy.”\n\nNow, here's one thing it means. We just have to stop comparing ourselves to one another. The problem with comparing yourself to another human being is you're always able to find someone who's worse off than you are. Comparison to other human beings is a quick road to self-righteousness and self-congratulation and self-aggrandizement.\n\nWhen God stands as your standard, it's deeply humbling; it's deeply convicting, and it's deeply revealing of how far you are away from what God wants. I think of how quickly a flash of irritation will come into my mind, even if I don't express it, how much I can think about things that I just should not be thinking about.\n\nYou see, there's grace in this call because this call of holiness is meant to bring you to the end of yourself, that's its purpose. And in bringing you to the end of yourself, it drives you toward God and toward His forgiving and empowering grace.\n\nListen, as long as you trust yourself, as long as you think you can pull it off, as long as you think you're okay, grace doesn't mean anything to you. There's grace in the impossibility of this call because it reveals my inability, it reveals my hopelessness, it reveals how deep my need is for forgiving and transforming grace. You see, this call is like the call of every one of God's commands; every command to us is accompanied by His grace. He not only calls you to something, but He gives you the grace to do it. “Be holy, as I am holy!”\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nI don't know how much you've thought about fear; we all have the capacity to be afraid. But fear can be the enemy of faith. Fear can hound you; it can paralyze you; it can rob you of your motivation and joy. It can make you, rather than want to live life, to want to escape from life. But there is a wholesome, life-producing fear that Peter talks about. Let me read for you again from 1 Peter 1, verse 17:\n\nAnd if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile. (Again) And if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile.\n\nI literally adore the way that Peter handles this topic of the fear of the Lord; I think it's incredibly helpful. And I think as I was studying this passage, I saw this clearly for the very first time. He's clearly not talking about a terror of God's condemnation. The fear that God would turn His back on you, the fear that He would throw you out of His family. Now how do I know that? Because Peter puts two titles together that, for the Christian, ought to always be together. He puts Father and Judge together. God is for the believer, not just our Judge, He's a Father-Judge.\n\nNow, what does that tell you? It tells you that the one who watches over you, the one who holds you accountable, does that with the spirit and the heart of a father. It means you're already in His family. He's already made you an object of His love. You already bear His name. You're already the object of His loving protection and provision, His fathering care.\n\nAnd so, it's like having a loving father, but who is an authority in your life. You're not afraid that He's going to hurt you. You're not afraid that He's going to pack your bags and throw you out of the family. But you know that there will be consequences to not obeying Him. That's exactly the picture he's talking about. Consequences are not condemnation. Hear what I’m about to say, “The consequences are God's discipline. God disciplines those whom He loves.” It's just wrong to think that since I'm God's child, and since I'm the object of His grace, there'll be no consequences for my sin. The Bible just doesn't teach that.\n\nIn fact, it says if God loves me, He couldn't possibly not discipline me. Discipline without love is not discipline, and love without discipline isn't love. And so that's so beautifully presented here as Peter says you fear Him like a child would fear a loving father; you have deep awe and respect for His authority. And so, you want to live in a way that pleases Him; that's the picture here.\n\nI would ask you, “Does your life picture this kind of fear that you really want to live in a way that pleases this One who has loved you so; and you don't want to constantly be placing yourself under His loving discipline?”\n\nI love that Peter brings together Judge and Father. We don't have the terror of His condemnation; but we have deep respect for His authority in our lives. We know He loves us, but we know how important it is to obey Him!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nWell, there's a misunderstanding of God's gorgeous gift of grace that crops up again and again. This misunderstanding seems to never die, although it definitely needs to die. And it's addressed here in Peter and many other places in Scripture, but Peter does a wonderful job.\n\nAnd if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.\n\nThis misunderstanding of God's grace basically says this, “If I'm saved by grace, if all of my sins are covered, past, present, and future, it doesn't matter how I live.” I once had a person say to me, as I was questioning a choice they were going to make, “Ah! God will forgive me anyway.” That is a horrible misconstruing of the nature of the operation His grace. The Bible never teaches such a thing.\n\nThere's an old name for this; it's not used as much as it was. It was called ‘Easy-believism.’ “As long as I believe, I'm the object of God's grace, and between ‘the already and not yet,’ nothing else makes a whole lot of difference.” But it does matter; and after Peter’s talking about the Father-Judge, he says, “Here's why it matters, how you live.”\n\nAnd he talks about two things. First of all, he says, “You were ransomed from your sin.” God worked to intervene because sin is just that serious. He harnessed the forces of nature; He controlled the events of human history, so at a certain time, His Son would be born. You can't look at the birth of the Messiah and conclude that sin is just sort of okay. Then he adds on to that. He said, “Don't you understand the terrible cost of that ransom? It was the precious blood of Jesus.” Jesus suffered a horrible, cruel death, taking our sin on His shoulders. That's how serious this is.\n\nThink about this. It required the death of the Messiah. But he adds more. It also required a substitutionary sacrifice; it had to be an unblemished lamb. Someone had to come and, in every way, live as a completely righteous human being. Now, that's a whole lot of effort invested in something that we're tempted to say is not such a big deal. Peter argues, “You cannot look at the radical intervention of redemption, the radical birth of Christ, the radical life of Christ, the radical death of Jesus Christ, and not see sin as a serious thing.”\n\nYou see, here's what happens even though we don't know it. Every moment in our lives, where we minimize sin, we devalue the righteous life and acceptable sacrifice of Jesus. Every time you argue within yourself that you don't really need to confess because that was really not a sin, you were just feeling bad or you were just busy or whatever excuse you give, you denigrate the cross of Jesus Christ. You devalue this radical intervention! The birth of Jesus, the righteous life of Jesus, the death of Jesus argue that sin is serious and because it is, it makes a difference how I live!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nI don't know about your experience, but mine is usually when I hear the word substitute, I think, “Ahhh, not as good as the original!” I can remember in high school, I will make this confession, that we had a good time with substitutes. Because we knew that a substitute didn't know all of the ropes, and we would get away with things we would never get away with our teacher. Or think, you've bought ridiculously expensive Broadway tickets, and you open your Playbill only to realize that the main actor you came to see won't be appearing that night, a stand-in will. You never say, “Yeah!” You say, “Ahh, I can't believe it!” The one night I'm here on Broadway and I get a substitute?\n\nWell, God has a substitute plan that is not like that at all. Let me read 1 Peter 1:20.\n\nHe (Jesus) was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.\n\nGod looked at His fallen creatures and realized that there's nothing we could ever do to make ourselves acceptable to Him. There's nothing that we could ever do to bridge the sin gap. And so, from the foundation of the world, hear these words–this is so amazing, God devised a substitute plan to provide for us a substitute in His Son. This time, the substitute is infinitely better than we would have ever been.\n\nThe only way to bridge that huge gap, the separation that sin made between us and God, was for Jesus to stand in our place. What does He do? Well, we've talked about this multiple times already in this wonderful chapter of 1 Peter. He lived as we could not live. Don't ever discount the important contribution of the life Jesus lived before the cross.\n\nOften when we talk about salvation, we want to run to the cross. But every moment of His life, every word He spoke, every choice He made, every righteous thing He did, was done for us. He’s standing in our place. Then He died in our place; that sacrifice was substitutionary. It was Jesus taking on Himself the penalty that we deserved. And then He rises on our behalf, doing what we would never be able to do. He has the power to conquer the power of death. It is an amazing story of God's grace, this plan to provide for us a substitute.\n\nI like what it says, “…who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.” He showered glory upon His Son, and that glory now gets showered down on us by grace. It is the most beautiful plan you could ever consider. That substitute plan wasn't a last-minute jerk-reaction–God said, “Oh, these people are worse than what I thought they were going to be; I better do something.”\n\nPeter says, “…before the foundation the world.” God said the only thing that will ultimately end with what I want eternity to be like, is a sinner substitute. I'll send My Son and He will stand in every way in your place. He will reach my standards. He will satisfy the demands of My anger, and He will pour His glory down on My children. Now that's a plan!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nWell, I live here in Center City, just in walking distance from this studio, and I live in a building that was a former garment factory and it's now turned into lofts. And our building is a secure building. You just can't get into this building without a key fob, without a cell phone app, or without a code. And the building is publicized as a safe building because of that.\n\nSo, I want to ask and address the question from 1 Peter, where is security to be found? Where is true, human safety to be found? Now for our building, the most dangerous thing that the builders were concerned about is people who don't belong in that building, entering that building and maybe robbing somebody or breaking into a loft. Well, what is the greatest danger to a human being?\n\nWell, prepare to be humbled. The greatest dangers in life don't exist outside of you. If the greatest dangers of life existed outside of you, all you would need to do is change locations to a safer place, quit hanging around with those unsafe people. But the Bible teaches us that the greatest danger in human life lives inside of me, not outside of me. It's this thing called sin because sin is always destructive, it's always deceptive, and it ultimately leads to death.\n\nBut here's the good news. Although sin is something we should be deathly afraid of, the house of God is a secure building. Let me read for you.\n\nHe was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.\n\nNow, what Peter is saying is, “The thing that you should be most afraid of, the thing that is most dangerous that has the greatest power to destroy your life, destroy your relationships, destroy your righteous hopes and dreams, God has dealt with in His Son.” It means that God provides the safety for you from this dangerous thing that you could never provide for yourself.\n\nParents, you want your children to be safe from sin, but you better know you can't do that. If you're in marriage, you want your husband or wife to be safe from sin, but you better know that you don't have the power to create that. Only God has that power! Again, that's why He sent His Son to conquer sin. That's why He gives us, according to this passage, hearts to believe. It's not natural for me to believe. God's got to provide intervention. I need grace to believe in grace. And He showers, as I said before, His glory on His Son. Why?\n\nBecause sin is about self-glory! And He puts before us a greater glory than we would ever find in ourselves. So, you can feel safe putting your faith and hope in His hands. It's never a dumb thing, it's never an unwise thing, it's never an unsafe thing to place the entirety of your life in the hands of God because the house of God is the world's most secure building. All of His ways are right and true; everything He asks of you is good; everything He promises you is the best; everything He delivers you from is the worst. There's nothing but safety and good in the house of God. Living in God's house is by far the safest place on Earth!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nI think Peter must understand how hard-hearted we can be, how dull our ears can be, how we don't always hear what God says the first time He says it. If you're a parent, you know that you know how many times you repeat the same things to your children. Sometimes with a little bit of irritation, you say, “How many times am I going to have to tell you that same thing?” Well, God's very patient and very kind and, through Peter, repeats themes here, and you see Peter going after the same thing in a different way, giving us a different way of understanding it and hearing it anew.\n\nI want to talk about living like you're born again. And I would ask you this question if you would get out your iPhone or iPad and you would type into it, basically, your best portrait of what a life of a believer should look like, what would you put there? Let me read this helpful and convicting passage.\n\nHaving purified your souls by…obedience to the truth for sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart, since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God.\n\nAnd I'll stop there. Again, I like how Peter has this ability to combine things for us in a way that is clarifying. Remember, he combined Father and Judge in a way that clarifies the kind of fear that a believer should have? Well, he puts three things together in this passage that are very helpful. Here they are, obedience to the truth, sincere brotherly love, and the living and abiding Word of God. We must hold obedience and love and the Word together. That's the Christian life.\n\nThe Christian life is not just about obedience. It's about obedience that produces a life of love. And it's not just about a life of love. It's a life of love that's just defined by the clear teaching of the Word of God. What names itself as love isn't always love. What names itself as obedience isn't always loving. And so, I find it both helpful and convicting that Peter puts obedience, love, and God's Word all together; you have to hold those together.\n\nIf you're obedient to the truth, you will live a life of love. Let me say that again, if you are obedient to the truth, you will live a life of love.\n\nI think of Paul saying, “The goal of our instruction is a love out of a sincere heart.” If you love God's Word, you will live an obedient life. If you're committed to love, you'll want that defined by God's Word. This is the Christian life.\n\nTruly loving people are obedient. Truly loving people love God's Word. Truly obedient people love to love. Truly obedient people love God's Word. People of the Word love to be obedient. People of the Word become people of love. Love, obedience, Word; love, obedience, Word; love, obedience, Word; love, obedience, Word; love obedience Word–that is the Christian life.\n\nYou can't love your way; God defines love. You can't say you're following God, but you're a graceless, unloving person. You can't say you're obedient if you don't love. You can't say you love God's Word if it doesn't produce a heart to obey and the heart of love. Love, obedience, the Word held together–that's the Christian life!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nSo, we find ourselves at the last section of 1 Peter 1. I want to say again how deeply helped I have been both at the revelation of my own heart and my need for grace, and just the growth of my confidence in the beauty of God's redeeming plan in 1 Peter.\n\nWe've really slowed down. We've done 21 editions of this Bible study just out of 1 Peter. Now, 1 Peter is 5 chapters; we're doing this for a year, so that's 52 of these. So, you're wondering if we're ever going to get done with 1 Peter? Well, we're going to take bigger chunks from here out.\n\nI just thought that as Peter felt, these people are suffering, they're suffering mistreatment and misunderstanding, needing to celebrate the depth and completeness of God's work of redemption in His Son. And so, Peter packs a tremendous amount of gospel content in 25 verses. And there's a way in which the rest of 1 Peter is just, “Okay, how do I apply this gospel content in the context of the world that I'm now living in?” And Peter is very comprehensive in his applications, as we'll see.\n\nWell, I want to talk about the permanence of God's Word. Let me begin by reading.\n\nFor all flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls, but the word of the Lord remains forever. And this word is the good news that was preached to you.\n\nWe all know that some advice, some counsel gets outdated; it just doesn't apply as it once did. In fact, I don't know if you've ever seen this, but occasionally an article will come up on the internet with some old city laws that are still on the books. There are hilarious laws in Philadelphia that just don't make any sense anymore that, at one point in time, were important. But Peter wants us to know that's not true of God's Word. God's Word is eternal.\n\nNow, that doesn't just mean that it will last forever; it means that it never fades, it's never out of date, it's never unwise. God's Word will have as much saving, transforming, guiding wisdom, way down the road, as it did when it was first written. But there's something else, if God's Word applies to every cultural setting of generation after generation, then what Peter is celebrating is not just its eternality, but its universality.\n\nI have experienced that in my travel and ministry. It's amazing that I've never been in a culture where the Word of God didn't apply. I can remember telling a rather American story to a group of Indian believers, and I was sort of apologizing for the story. And at the end a lady came up to me at the break and said, “You don't have to apologize because, at the heart, we're all the same, and we all need the same thing.” She's exactly right!\n\nMy confidence in the Word of God is, I pick it up and I know to whomever I'm going to go to it with, wherever I'm going to go, however old they are, however young they are, whatever culture they're in, this Word will always apply. And at the heart of that Word is the good news of salvation in Jesus Christ.\n\nGod's Word is eternal; it will never be outdated. It's universal; there will never be anyone in a cultural situation that won't need the redeeming gospel. That is the heart of God's Word. It is eternal–and that is the best of News!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nSo, Peter is going to take us in a new direction for the rest of this little letter that we're looking at. He's laid this gospel foundation, but Peter wants us to understand the gospel is not just the narrative of God's work of redemption; it's meant for us ‘right here, right now’ to form a lifestyle, to be the way that we look at, understand, and respond to everything in our life. It's not an overstatement to say that the gospel changes everything. It really does.\n\nLet me read these verses for you.\n\nSo put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander. Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation–if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.\n\nThe Christian life is really shaped by saying, “No!” and saying, “Yes!” And you better know where to say, “No!” and where to say, “Yes!” If you're going to live a consistent, gospel-shaped life, you better be good at saying, “No!” And Peter doesn't mean saying, “No!” to external evil or saying, “No!” to other people. He's talking about saying, “No!” to yourself. And the reason we have to say, “No!” to ourselves is because we're not yet grace graduates; we're not yet sin free.\n\nThere are passions inside of us that we need to resist. And he mentions five things actually: malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander. All of those things are first sins of the heart before they're ever sins of behavior. Peter does not believe that you should follow your heart. He believes that there are moments where we need to do war with our own hearts. You know that you'll have raging emotions and raging anger at places that will lead you in dangerous directions–and you've got to say, “No!” to those. And we're able to say, “No!” because the Holy Spirit now lives inside of us and empowers us to say, “No!” to us. Are you committed to saying, “No!” to you?\n\nBut we also need to say, “Yes!” to say, “Yes!” to what? To God's gift of constantly giving us all the spiritual nutrients that we need in order to grow in our relationship with Him. The word picture Peter uses is a newborn infant, that ravenous hunger of that crying infant, that he will not relent until he gets the milk that he's hungry for. That's where we should say, “Yes, yes, yes, yes! I want everything that helps me to understand the depth of the life changing wisdom of God's Word, I want to be a student of God's Word. I want to be biblically literate; I want to be theologically knowledgeable, I want, I want, I want, I hunger for that. And I hunger for anything that will help me to understand God's truth and how it is all the spiritual nutrition that I need.”\n\nNow, what's the motivation for that? Well, I like what Peter says here. I think it's the bottom line, “…if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.” The motivation is that God is good? How could it be that anything in this book would be anything less than good because the God who ordained and guided this Book is perfectly good all the time and in every way. God is good!\n\nAnd so, everything God calls me to is good. And I think that bottom line also sets up everything Peter is going to say for the rest of this book. All the hard calls that we will hear in 1 Peter are based on the fact that God is good.\n\nI want to ask you, are you good at saying “No!”? Are you committed to saying, “No!” to you? Or do you just go wherever your feelings lead you, wherever your passions lead you? And is there a ‘yes’ inside of you that makes you ravenously hungry for nutrients of God’s Word that will continue to grow you in your faith and in your love and service for the Lord?\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nWell, Peter moves from yes and no to again reminding us of our new identity and our new potential as the children of God. But he's not doing that in a theoretical way; he's doing that in a way that is meant to be intensely practical in the way that I think about who I am. You are always assigning to yourself some kind of identity. You're always living out of that identity.\n\nListen to these words:\n\nAs you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious, you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.\n\nAnd we'll stop there. He begins by saying, “As you come to him,” Peter’s view is that we are committed to ongoing fellowship, ongoing communion with our Lord. It's not just that He comes to us. By grace, He does that, but that we are pursuing the One who is pursuing us. That's the picture here. Does that describe you? Are you in constant pursuit of your Savior? I mean, that's a real thing. That's a daily activity. That's a regular commitment. And who is this One?\n\nWell, Jesus is a living stone. That's important too, because he's saying, “Hey people! He's not dead. This is the risen, reigning Lord. His mission was not aborted because He was rejected.” Why is that? Because He's precious in the sight of God. So I serve, I commune with a victorious, ascendant Savior, precious in the sight of God, now sitting at the right hand of the Father.\n\nThen Peter does something that is a theme for him. There are two word-pictures that he wants us to understand to shape our identity. The first one is temple, and the second one is priesthood. You’re God's temple; you’re being built together as the place where God, in His glory, dwells. The Body of Christ is the fulfillment of the Temple of Solomon. The Body of Christ is the fulfillment of the Old Testament priesthood. That's pretty amazing!\n\nYou have no greater honor in your life, I don't care what you've accomplished, I don't care how much money you have, or how much power you have, than you are now a stone in the temple of the most-high God–that you are now His priest. You have entrance into the Holy of Holies–God's very throne room! It's mind boggling. So, I'm not just Paul Tripp, bumping around with all the difficulties in this life, hoping I can make it. I've been chosen by God to be part of His eternal building; I've been chosen of God to now have access to Him. I don't have access to the mayor of Philadelphia, let alone to the governor or my president. But I can walk into God's presence, and I'm accepted there because I'm one of His priests.\n\nAnd what does that mean? This is amazing to me! I'm able to offer spiritual sacrifices that God accepts. Where do you make those sacrifices? He's not talking about formal religion here; he's talking about your daily life. You make spiritual sacrifices in your marriage. You make spiritual sacrifices in your parenting. You make spiritual sacrifices in your friendships. You make spiritual sacrifices in your sexuality. You make spiritual sacrifices at your workplace, in your neighborhood, as a citizen. What does that mean? I surrender my will to God's will in every one of those areas. If you're not making spiritual sacrifice, then you have a bad marriage, and you’re mistreating your children, and you’re misusing your money, and you’re pursuing sexual immorality. Everything God calls you to, He calls you to make spiritual sacrifices, and He accepts those by grace!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\nSo, Peter is not done with his temple metaphor, helping us to understand who Jesus is and helping us to understand who we are. Let me read these words:\n\nFor it stands in Scripture: “Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.” So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, “The stone that the builders rejected has become a cornerstone,” and “A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense.”\n\nThey stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.\n\nPeter begins with a quote from Isaiah 28:16, “Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.” (From 1 Peter) It's very clear from these words, this prophecy is not about the temple in Jerusalem, but it's about Jesus. He is the cornerstone of the great, eternal house of God. We are stones being fit in and together with all of the saints, together with all believers, now united as one in that temple.\n\nAnd he says this, that there's “…honor…for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone…whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.’” Belief in Jesus, a life committed to follow Jesus will never put you to shame. Why does Peter say that?\n\nBecause, we have these moments where we think, “Is God, right? Is this really the best thing to do? Maybe I shouldn't speak kindly to this person who has mistreated me. Maybe I ought to go rip his face off. Maybe that would, that would be better. Is this really what I should do in my marriage?” I think there'll be moments where we wonder about God's will and God's way until we're on the other side. And so, Peter says, “Never, never, never, will God lead you in a bad direction! Never, never, never will He put you to shame!”\n\nAnd then he makes this contrast. This stone that is the cornerstone is a stone of honor, and a stone of stumbling. It's honor for all of us who now understand that we are being built in this temple; we have the privilege of being part of this amazing thing that God is doing. But it's a stone of stumbling. The gospel is offensive to some; Jesus is offensive to some. They see His Messiahship as foolishness, His cross as meaningless, His resurrection as a myth, His Word as irrelevant; mockery of Jesus is quite regular. And isn't it amazing that it really is not abstract theology that's the dividing line. The fault line is Jesus.\n\nThere are only two ways to respond to Jesus. You recognize that this is the Son of God, and you surrender your life to Him; or you mock His existence, and you walk away from His work and live life however you want to live it. There's no in-between. The great fault line is Jesus.\n\nBut I want to talk about how this passage ends, very quickly. It says, “‘A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.’ They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.” Those are hard words for some of us to hear. But understand what Peter is saying. Peter is saying, “It's never right just to say, ‘I don't have a chance because God ordained me to not have a chance.’” That's not what Peter is writing.\n\nHe's saying they stumble because they disobey the Word. Again, here's the theology of the Word of God. God exercises His sovereignty, His ultimate rule through the validity of the choices of the people He created. It's never the sovereignty of God or the responsibilities man. It's always both. And so ultimately, I have to say, I walked away because I chose to walk away. I can never say that it's all God's fault because God expresses His sovereignty through the validity of the choices that I make.\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nSo, I have some questions I'd like to ask you. If you had to get out your iPad or a piece of paper and with a pen, how would you describe yourself as a Christian? What would that paragraph be? How would you then describe the life that you've been called to? And what is it that gets you up in the morning? Be honest, what motivates you?\n\nYou know, when you hear the message of the gospel so powerfully presented as Peter has, maybe the next question is, so now what? So, what do I do with this? And what Peter does in these next verses, is gives us three perspectives on the Christian life. They may not jump off the page to you; I'm going to organize them for you.\n\nBut you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you've received mercy.\n\nSo here are the three perspectives on the Christian life: security, identity, and calling. What's the security of a Christian? Here it is, “But you are a chosen race.” Here it is, I am what I am by God's choice! I'm not here because I behaved well. I didn't earn my way into this, and hear this, “I do not keep myself secure by my obedience. I'm secure because I was chosen before the foundation of the earth. And God never turns His back on those He's chosen!” That's my security. I love this, “You are a chosen race”–God's people by God's choice.\n\nWhat's my identity? Here comes these word pictures, again, royal priesthood–priests of the King of kings, invited into God's presence, a holy nation, the new Israel of God, the people of God, citizens of a greater kingdom.\n\nListen, when you're facing the chaos of the kingdom of this world, and look around, there's chaos everywhere, sometimes it's so discouraging. Remember that you are now a citizen of a greater kingdom, and this kingdom will live beyond the sadness and suffering of sin. That's who I am. A people for God's own possession. I don't belong to me anymore. I belong to my Lord. I don't own my mentality, I don't own my emotionality, I don't own my physicality, I don't own my relationships, I don't own me–God owns me!\n\nSecurity, identity, and then calling. What am I meant to be doing between the ‘already of my conversion and the not yet’ in my home going? Proclaiming the glories of the One who called you from darkness into light.\n\nListen, I hate when we call people in full-time Christian ministry ‘ministers’ because it separates everybody else from that. Listen, you are called to be a minister of the gospel. Maybe that's to your children, maybe that's to your husband or wife, maybe that's to your neighbor, maybe that's in the workplace, maybe that's at your university. But all of us are called to look for opportunities to point to the glory of the Lord. Psalm 145 says, “One generation shall proclaim Your Excellency to the next generation.”\n\nNow, that just reminds us that there's a glory war. Will I live for my glory, or will I live to point to the glory of my Redeemer? And for that, I've been given mercy, that's where the passage ends. I once didn't have mercy, but now I live with the new mercies of my Lord every day!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nSo, Peter wants us to know that there's a great spiritual war, and that war is fought in us and around us every day. Maybe this sounds like bad news. But this isn't peace time; peace time is coming. You're guaranteed to live in peace and righteousness forever and ever. But this isn’t peace time, and you can't live with a peace time mentality, or you'll get yourself in trouble.\n\nYou know, when the world's not at war, what do we do? We build bigger houses, we eat better meals, we binge on Netflix; we're not in peace time right now, this is war. And that battle is fought on three fronts: the inward front, the outward front, and the upward front. Life is war.\n\nBeloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which war against your soul. Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.\n\nSo, this is very similar to themes we've looked at before, but it’s organized, I think, in a helpful way. What's the inward front? The inward front is just keep reminding yourself of who you are; you're a sojourner and an exile–this is not your home! The goal now is not to see how comfortable you can be, how pleasurable life can be, how many people love and accept you. If you pursue all of those things, you will erode away your relationship with God. You have to understand there are ways in which you're not supposed to fit because this is not your home. If this home feels uncomfortable to you, it is because you were designed for another home. If this culture feels weird and uncomfortable to you, and you feel more and more an alien, that's because you were designed for something else. And part of that inward thing is again, to not give way to passions to take you somewhere else. This is the third time Peter has discussed passions in a little over a chapter. That's how much he knows that there's a war going on inside of us. That's the inward front.\n\nThere's the outward front–live honorably, live in a way that silences accusers because they have to stand back and ultimately say, “This is a good person. This is a good, loving, kind person.” What do you give yourself to? Do you give yourself to what is holy in the eyes of God, not just what would satisfy your pleasure or satisfy somebody else? Are you committed to live an exemplary life, a life of honor, a life that's good?\n\nAre you aware the world is watching? And what you do and say, no matter where you are, means something, it's important! Life has value, your choices have value, they're important. And you're called to be an honorable representative of the One who is perfectly good and perfectly wise and perfectly holy. Your life is meant to point to Him. This is important stuff.\n\nAnd then the upward front. What do you do? Why you do all of this? No, not so people like you, not just so you'll be successful, have lots of praise and applause! No! It's so that God will get glory, ultimately, God will receive praise. So, there's a battle going on.\n\nThere's an inward battle-that tendency to forget who I am and be caught up in the culture of the world. There's an outward battle between what I find pleasurable, and what's honorable to God, and being committed to live in a way that's honorable and silences the accuser. And then there's upward battle, whose glory will I live for? Now, I want to say, “There's grace, glorious grace for these battles!”\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nWe're going to enter a long section of Peter where the theme is, “being willing to be subject to authority.” It's a life of servanthood. And I have to say again, “I don't always love authority.” You know that authority is hard for us.\n\nIf you're a parent, you know, a child will fight you because you want to put a certain healthy food in their mouth. Now, this child hasn't read a diet book but decided they want to eat a certain way. What they're fighting is authority, “My body belongs to me, and I will choose what I put in my mouth.” Or a child who's clearly sleepy who will fight you when you try to put them to bed. You have got to know that there's something inside of us–sin is fiercely rebellious; sin is fiercely independent. And so, we fight authority, we fight being subject to anything.\n\nAnd that's why Peter wants us to know this is a principle aspect of the Christian life, the life that God has called us to. It’s a life of willing subjection to the authorities that God has placed in this life. And what Peter says is:\n\nBe subject…to every human institution, whether to an emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good. For this is the will of God.\n\nThese authorities are sent by God. Human authority is a visible representation of the authority of God. So, God is the ultimate King, He sends kings to make His invisible authority visible. That's the model. And so, this life of submission is God's will for me. I love this. In this discussion of submission, which is introducing a whole section of 1 Peter, he also talks about freedom.\n\nNow, we tend to think freedom is freedom from the need to submit to anything. “I'm free!” That's not what he's talking about. He's talking about a freedom that is a result of being willing to live as a servant of God and subject to the authorities He puts in my life. And Peter is going to make this practical.\n\nLook at where he ends, “Honor everyone.” If we took that seriously, Christian social media would be immediately purified. I read so much dishonoring communication from believers to believers, things that should never be communicated. “Honor everyone.”\n\n“Love the brotherhood.” This cranks it up–a particular affection for the family of God that would cause me to treat my brothers and sisters with tenderheartedness, with mercy, with patience, with forgiveness, with humility.\n\n“Fear God.” This is this life shaping awe of God's; it’s not terror of God, it's a life-shaping awe of God, that everything I do is shaped by the fact I live in awe of this One who is my Savior and my LORD.\n\n“Honor the emperor,” that I should treat those authorities with respect.\n\nNow, I just have to say these four things are such a solution for the tribal and political nastiness that's all around us. “Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor,” and you can do this, because God's grace doesn't just call you; God's grace empowers you to do what God has called you to do. Every command of God is accompanied by His grace!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nWell, here's another thing that is important to understand about the practicality of street-level gospel, the gospel that shapes the way I live. I'm not just comforted to celebrate the victory of this risen Christ, the Cornerstone, the King, but I'm also called to follow Him in His suffering. And so, I want to read this passage; some of you will find these words hard to hear and understand, so I want to make an explanation and then talk about the passage.\n\nServants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust. For this a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly. For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.\n\nHard, hard words! The first thing I want to say is that it's very important to understand that the Roman institution of bondservant was fundamentally different than the chattel slavery that went across Europe and North and South America. In fact, the New Testament assumes that trafficking in human beings is a sin. 1 Timothy 1:10 lists alongside of the sexually immoral…liars and perjurers, enslavers. So clearly, this is not a passage that says slavery, as we have come to understand it, is okay because the Bible names that as a sin.\n\nWhat Peter is doing is applying a principle that has been a core gospel principle as he's applying the gospel to every everyday life. That I am meant to live how I live, not because of how I'm being treated, but because I'm a child of God. There's an internal motivation that needs to be inside of me, no matter how I'm being treated, no matter how unjustly I'm being treated. Mistreatment doesn't change the moral rules. Let me say that again. Mistreatment doesn't change the moral rules. The moral rules for me, remain the same.\n\nAnd what Peter does for our help is chooses the most outrageous example; because if that outrageous example is true, then how much truer it is for us who are not facing things this hard. If it's right for a servant, when he's literally being beaten by a bad master, to respond in ways that are good, how much more right is it for us, in whatever mistreatment we're facing, to not allow the internal moral rules of our heart to change?\n\nWhat are the gospel principles? Constant life of submission to God, constant commitment to honor human authority, constant commitment to do what is good no matter what, being willing to suffer–you have to be willing to suffer because if you're not willing to suffer, you're going to be a depressed and angry person, and remember God's empowering and rewarding grace. There's where the passage goes.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that we don't fight injustice. But it means I always do that, in submission to God, always do it in the way that honors human authority, and I do not let go of my commitment to do what is good no matter what.\n\nI want to ask you this question, “Are you willing to suffer? Are you willing to go through things that are hard, unjust, mistreatment, for the sake of the honor of your Savior?\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nSo, I don't know if you've understood the foundation of this second chapter of 1 Peter which we're going to complete. But Peter wants you to know if you're God's child, your life doesn't belong to you anymore.\n\nThere are two principles that shape everybody's living: a principle of ownership and a principle of servanthood. I either live like my life belongs to me to do with it what I want to do, or I understand that I now am God's possession; my life belongs to Him and needs to be shaped by His will for me. And to end the introduction to that conversation, because he's going to extend it in the next chapter, Peter takes us back to the person and work of Jesus.\n\nJesus is the foundation of this new way of living; it’s the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ; it's Jesus preeminent in all things.\n\nHe committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.\n\nJesus is our example. But praise God, praise God, praise God! He's not just an example. What’s the example? Jesus is the ultimate example of never returning evil for evil. You know, sometimes I'm rejected because I do bad things; never the case with Jesus because it says that “He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.” The sinless perfection of Jesus is taught here. The perfect, righteous Son of God, in the face of insult, He did not insult in return. In the face of abuse and anger, He wasn't abusive and angry.\n\nAnd why was He not that? Because He really believed in the perfect justice of His Father! And we believe that, ultimately, justice will win. Ultimately, the meek will inherit the earth. When you choose not to take justice into your own hands, you are marching with the move of the kingdom of God where, ultimately, the One who is justice will win, and His justice and His righteousness will reign forever and ever and ever.\n\nJesus is a shining example of living that way. There was never a just accusation made against this One because He was perfect. But thankfully, Jesus is not just our example, because if He was just our example, we could never reach that example. The standard would be too high. He is our substitute.\n\nFirst of all, He committed no sin; He lived the righteous life that you and I could never live. He bore our sins in His body; He paid our penalty as the ultimate sacrifice, the Lamb of God. Why did He do that? So we can live between the ‘already of our conversion’ and the ‘not yet of our homegoing’ righteous lives. His grace is not so we can just go on sinning, knowing that we're forgiven. But His substitution for us is so that we can live righteously and, ultimately, know that we will finally be healed from the ultimate disease of disease, the disease of sin. Your deliverance from the ultimate disease is guaranteed as a child of God. May you grab a hold of Jesus as your example; may you grab a hold of Jesus as your substitute, and may, because of that, you live a righteous life in His eyes!\n\nDownload Transcript\n\nDownload Video\n\nTranscript\n\n(this transcript has been lightly edited for readability)\n\nWell as we launch into 1 Peter 3, I want to take a moment to talk about the goodness of God and His commands. I think there are places in 1 Peter 3 where many of you who are watching or listening will struggle with what God is asking you to do. And so I think "
