        "text": "John 14:1-2: ‚ÄúLet not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me (2) In my Father‚Äôs house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you‚Äù?. For the past few days, I have heard this scripture over and over, and I feel that I am being tested in my trust towards God. The problems that we face are not a sign that God does not love us, but that His Grace is sufficient for all our situations, and His love will enable us to endure.\n\nThere is a song I always listen to by Richard Smallwood and its called ‚ÄúTrust Me‚Äù. Every time I listen to the song, it just reassures me when I trust God, I am wholly secure in Him. Some run to friends, some run to lovers, but even though they are in our lives for a reason, it does not mean that they will always have the answers to our problems. Some people however, are in our lives to push us closer to God, rather than relying on our own strength. How many of us can honestly say that they rely on their own strength to get tasks done? I know I do‚Ä¶\n\nBut the truth of the matter is that I just get frustrated, tired, emotionally unstable, and to some extent lazy! One day I would smile so much that my jaws would hurt; the next day I just can‚Äôt be bothered and take it out on those that truly love me and want the best of me, but because of my arrogance, I am pushing them away, which makes my situation feel worse. When we are in deep crisis, we don‚Äôt expect to be alone. We are expected to be comforted by our family, friends and loved ones. But the pain can sometimes be unbearable that you would not even want to open up; rather you choose to keep it inside of you and let your spirit be crushed.\n\nToday, I urge you beautiful women to surrender your all to Jesus, because He really desires to hear from you. I have heard so many times that ‚ÄúIf God already knows my needs, then why do I need to tell Him what I am going through?‚Äù. Yes He knows all your needs, but it is a time where your Faith will be tested in Him, so it is vital to be REAL WITH GOD, and tell Him what is really bugging you. God loves your honesty. Even if you want to cry, cry! Crying is good for the soul! If you want to get angry, by all means, BUT do not let the sun go down whilst your angry. So be angry for a while, but not until tomorrow morning lol!\n\nI think the majority of us today feel as if God loves other people more than us. For example, you and your friend have both graduated at the same time. She achieved a 2:2 and you got a 2:1. Your friend got a job in less than a year, and yet you are still in the process of looking for one. From my own experience, I do not believe it is the ‚Äògrade‚Äô that will get you the job, it is how you carry yourself! Some tips would be:\n\n‚Äì Your attitude\n\n‚Äì Your mindset (Is it positive or negative?)\n\n‚Äì Your expectations (Are your motives pure and genuine?)\n\n‚Äì Your humility\n\n‚Äì Your willingness to learn from others around you\n\nAll these points combined is the tools and techniques that should be used in all situations, but the GREATEST of all would be to TRUST GOD AND LET HIM DO HIS THING!! üòâ. The challenge for most of us today is who we run to when trouble comes. It is very easy to run to a friend who is so close to us. Although we cannot see God physically, we still have a strong feeling in our hearts that He is always around us, especially when we call on Him. At times, you would not need to call, your tears are ENOUGH for God to understand what you are going through.\n\nTake worship for example; some people worship through bowing down or laying prostrate on the floor, some may speak in tongues, some cry, some are still. Regardless of your style of worship, it is still pleasing to Him. But what I am trying to help you do now is to break you out of your routine of just going to God when you need assistance. Yes He is there 24/7, but if we keep constantly running to God when problems are surrounding us, how about when God blesses us with our hearts‚Äô desires? Will we truly remember Him then? Maybe some of the things you are going through are pulling you away from God; it‚Äôs not God that has withdrawn Himself from you, its your mind. Your mind has accused you of saying that God is not for you because you did not get that job, you did not get married when you wanted to, you did not get that promotion, you did not get to travel on behalf of your school work. These are all situations that if we are not careful can be dangerous to our health and relationships towards others.\n\nDo not allow your current situations to block your closeness with God. God is always with you day and night. He knows the end from the beginning! He wants you to come freely just as you are. No matter what you have done, you can always be confident that His love will keep you. His love is the medicine that you need for your conscience to be clear. Proverbs 3:5-6 ‚ÄúTrust in the Lord with ALL your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; (6) In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct your paths‚Äù. One of my favourite scriptures in the Bible! This scripture I learnt from my University. It really challenged me to put my trust in God and not to lean on my own knowledge.\n\nYes there will be times where we will think we are right, but we should not deceive ourselves. In all things, we must learn to trust God regardless of how we feel. We should not allow our emotions to dictate what decisions to make, because emotions are subject to change. Do not allow your emotions to make you bitter, but allow them to draw you closer to the Lord. He really does listen. I know it is easier to say, but it is true! I personally cannot emphasize it enough. If I was to honestly tell you the things I have cried out to God for, and the way He answered my prayers in ways and forms that I would not expect, you would be surprised!\n\nWhen you are talking to God about an issue or a burden or a crisis, God won‚Äôt always answer the way you expect Him to answer, but will do it in a way that would humble you enough to trust God in the end. Let us look at the story of Lazarus in the Bible. (Reference: John 10). So here, we see that Lazarus was a sick man. Two women Mary and Martha were with him whilst he was not feeling well. Mary and Martha informed Jesus about Lazarus‚Äô sickness. Jesus said ‚ÄúHis sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God‚Äôs glory so that God‚Äôs Son may be glorified through it‚Äù (v4).\n\nAlthough Jesus knew that Lazarus was sick, He decided to stay two more days where He was. A few days later on His arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. Now when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home. Martha had questioned Jesus saying that if He would had been there, Lazarus would not have died, but Jesus had to reassure Martha that Lazarus will rise again. Jesus was trying to convince her that anyone who believes in Him shall rise again. Now when Jesus saw Mary weeping and the Jews who had come along with her started to weep too, He was deeply moved in Spirit and troubled. There will be times in our lives where Jesus Himself will be upset with us because of our lack of Faith in Him.\n\nThe more we choose to distrust God and elevate our feelings, the less we can see the Power of God work in our lives. The Jews were always trying to challenge Jesus and mock Him saying that if He could open the eyes of a blind man, why can‚Äôt he not deliver a dead man. It does not surprise me by how many people would try to put you down because they only see your weakness, and not your strength. It occurs to me most of the time that people in life will always want to expose your faults just to make themselves ‚Äòlook righteous‚Äô, but as long as you do not give in to those people, you will be totally secure! With Jesus now, He did not have time to argue with these Jews for He knew His worth from the beginning! When you know that you are blessed and anointed, you do NOT have time to answer your critics! This is truly for someone, because I have a strong feeling in my heart that some of us women are wasting our time trying to win and convince people to believe that they are great!\n\nYou are not great from a man‚Äôs viewpoint; you are great from God‚Äôs viewpoint!! Let this stay in your mind. Jesus shouted from the tomb ‚ÄúLazarus, come out‚Äù and eventually he came out and lived. It is amazing how Jesus, regardless of all the haters and critics, still done His job effectively. Why is that? Because He trusted His Father in Heaven to help Him. He did not even need to run to His disciples for guidance or advice because He knew there was only one person He could rely on. The more you rely on God, the more stronger you become, and the more wiser you become in dealing with your critics. Sometimes, in order to get to the top, you will need to work in silence, if not darkness, and allow God to bring you into the light. You cannot force your way through until God says so!\n\nOur lives should be an indication to other people out there who are finding it hard to trust God in every situation they face. Some people want quick solutions which makes it look like they have got the victory, only to realise that they are back to square one. Whilst others are out there searching for God wholeheartedly. And although the situation is taking long, they still have enough FAITH to believe that all things are working together for their good for those who love the Lord. (Romans 8:28). Ladies, in the good and bad times, God is good! We should not allow the enemy, the world or society tell us otherwise. The only person you will end up trusting is God Himself! When everyone around you has failed and disappointed you, you will realise that all along, God was with you, holding your hand, wiping your tears, keeping you company, and most importantly, giving you opportunity after opportunity to live every blessed day!\n\nWhen you can trust God, God will also be able to trust you. When you invest in Him, He too will also do the same. God can only invest in people He can trust. If you are crying about a job because you want more money, your finances will be tested. He will test you on how you use it in terms of what you buy. You cannot buy what you want and beg for what you need. It does not work that way. A savings account would be essential if you really want to get a reliable job with financial stability. He sees your heart so no matter what you do, He knows your inner motives. Be wise with your money ladies. Yes it is good to look good, but investing in things that will not add value to your life is a waste! I tell you now: God will wreck your plans when He sees that your plans are about to wreck you! You would think that it is harsh, but it is out of love. The plans you think are good for you, may be the same plans that could delay you of the REAL BLESSING God has in store for you!\n\nRemember to not worry about tomorrow, for every day has its own problems of its own. We cannot control what goes on in our lives, but there will always be one solution, and that is to TRUST GOD! So I ask you, who are you really trusting?? Be wise in who you trust! Let God be your one and only. He wants to hear from you. Be real with Him and He will be real with you. He is not the one who is moving away from you. Your problems are not meant to make you move away from Him; your problems are meant to draw you CLOSER to Him so that He can speak to you directly. Do not make assumptions based on how God works. So because you sinned last night, you think God is punishing you based on that sin? No no, God is not like that. He is just and fair and faithful! As long as you apologise and confess, He won‚Äôt even remember what you did because He loves you UNCONDITIONALLY! Remember that God‚Äôs promises will only be revealed when your trust is in Him!\n\nRemember the more you trust God, the more He AMAZES YOU! My love goes out to you all!\n\nGod bless you richly üôÇ\n\nxoxox"
