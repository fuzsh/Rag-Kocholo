        "text": "“If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love. I have said these things to you so that my joy will be in you and your joy will be complete. This is my commandment: love each other just as I have loved you.”\n\nThe Good News: Your life will be richer if you take joy in the people whom you love and who love you back.\n\n“Because all the gods of the nations are just idols, but it is the Lord who created heaven! Greatness and grandeur are in front of him; strength and joy are in his place.”\n\nThe Good News: Our God is the god of all that is — that is the best news possible!\n\n“In the same way, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who changes both heart and life than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need to change their hearts and lives.”\n\nThe Good News: We believe in a forgiving God; take joy in that knowledge.\n\n“Let the sea and everything in it roar! Let the countryside and everything in it celebrate! Then the trees of the forest will shout out joyfully before the Lord, because he is coming to establish justice on earth! Give thanks to the Lord because he is good, because his faithful love endures forever.”\n\nThe Good News: Rejoice in the amazing natural world that surrounds us.\n\n“When they heard the king, they went; and look, the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stood over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.”\n\nThe Good News: We can only imagine the joy experienced by the wise men of old when they saw the brilliant star that led them to the baby Jesus.\n\n“Why do I have this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as I heard your greeting, the baby in my womb jumped for joy.”\n\nThe Good News: The baby — later to be John the Baptist — in Elizabeth’s womb leaped for joy in the presence of Mary, who was pregnant with Jesus. Joyful mothers both — let’s share in their joy.\n\nRELATED: 25 Powerful Bible Verses About Children and Parenting\n\n“Let God grant what is in your heart and fulfill all your plans. Then we will rejoice that you’ve been helped. We will fly our flags in the name of our God. Let the Lord fulfill all your requests!”\n\nThe Good News: Our hearts are filled with joy when our prayers are answered.\n\n“The angel said, ‘Don’t be afraid! Look! I bring good news to you—wonderful, joyous news for all people. Your savior is born today in David’s city. He is Christ the Lord.’”\n\nThe Good News: The shepherds were terrified by the appearance of the angel, but their terror quickly turned to joy at the news of Jesus’ birth.\n\n“You who are faithful to the Lord, sing praises to him; give thanks to his holy name! His anger lasts for only a second, but his favor lasts a lifetime. Weeping may stay all night, but by morning, joy!”\n\nThe Good News: If we believe, a joyous morning will follow even the blackest night.\n\nRELATED: 21 Bible Verses About Light to Guide You Through the Darkness\n\n“Whenever I ponder you on my bed, whenever I meditate on you in the middle of the night—because you’ve been a help to me and I shout for joy in the protection of your wings.”\n\nThe Good News: Safe and secure in our faith, we rest joyfully.\n\n“Come, let’s sing out loud to the Lord! Let’s raise a joyful shout to the rock of our salvation! Let’s come before him with thanks! Let’s shout songs of joy to him!”\n\nThe Good News: Our faith leaves us no choice: we cannot help but give our joyful thanks to the source of our salvation.\n\n“As he said this, he showed them his hands and feet. Because they were wondering and questioning in the midst of their happiness, he said to them, ‘Do you have anything to eat?’”\n\nThe Good News: The disciples on the road to Emmaus could barely believe that it was the risen Lord whom they met, but they were filled with joy anyway. Even in our doubts, the presence of God can lift our spirits.\n\n“Although you’ve never seen him, you love him. Even though you don’t see him now, you trust him and so rejoice with a glorious joy that is too much for words. You are receiving the goal of your faith: your salvation.”\n\nThe Good News: You do not need to see God to believe in the Lord. Just by having faith and believing in Him, you can feel joy."
