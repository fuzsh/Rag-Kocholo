        "text": "On August 3, 2024, BAPS Charities in Jackson, MS, hosted its annual “In the Joy of Others: Walk-Run” in Madison, MS. The event benefited BAPS Charities, the American Cancer Society, and the Community Foundation for Mississippi. Nearly 350 community members participated, including Mississippi State Representatives Grace Butler-Washington and Clay Mansell, and Jackson City Councilman Brian Grizzell. They joined forces to support these organizations’ missions to promote selfless service, improve the lives of those with cancer, and create lasting positive change in communities through inclusive philanthropic leadership.\n\nMonty Permenter of the American Cancer Society remarked, “It is encouraging to see so many volunteers supporting BAPS Charities and the American Cancer Society.” Jay Philpott of the Community Foundation for Mississippi added, “I am very happy to see so many people involved in making this event a success and raising funds for the cause.”\n\nMississippi State Representative Grace Butler-Washington from District 069 said, “It feels great to see the work of BAPS Charities.” Mississippi State Representative Clay Mansell from District 56 added, “I am happy to see BAPS Charities volunteers gathered. This is why Mississippi leads in volunteering.”\n\nNilay Patel, CEO of Netlink Voice, shared, “I have seen excellent work from BAPS Charities and their dedicated volunteers for years. Today, I am here with my family and staff to support the In the Joy of Others Walk-Run 2024, raising funds for various charitable works, including the American Cancer Society, which is very close to my heart.”\n\nParticipant Manisha Brahmbhatt said, “I always love helping people. Other volunteers at BAPS Charities have inspired and encouraged me to raise funds for the Walkathon. Last year, my daughter made bracelets and was able to raise funds for the cause.”\n\nNayan Mehta expressed gratitude towards sponsors, participants, and fundraisers.\n\nThe event provided an opportunity for participants to engage in a healthier lifestyle and highlighted the profound impact that collective efforts can have in addressing local needs and challenges."
