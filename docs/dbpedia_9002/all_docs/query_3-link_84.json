        "text": "When our minds are busy, we can be easily overwhelmed and distracted, but our brains usually find a way to process and release. Our hearts on the other hand, hold everything dearly.\n\nOur hearts hold love and joy, but they also hold pain, worry, guilt and sadness. Our hearts helps us feel all the things, and not just our own things. Our hearts take on the whole world. Sometimes it’s too much though, and all of those feelings get heavy. When our hearts overflow with the heavy stuff, we ask questions like …\n\nWhy am I so sad?\n\nWhy does this hurt so much?\n\nWill I get through this?\n\nWhen will I feel better?\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nOr, instead of asking the questions, we shut down. Our hearts close for business for a while and we disconnect from all the feelings, even the good ones. It’s in that time that we usually become apathetic, depressed, lonely, or hopeless.\n\nThe heart wants what the heart wants, but there are ways to soothe your soul, and to lighten your heavy heart.\n\nWrite down your heart.\n\nThis is almost always my first response to pain, grief, sadness, or any strong emotion or reaction. I’ve learned from experience that acting from an unstable place generally leads to overreacting and words I wished I never said out loud. Instead, I put my heart on paper first. I write it all down. Even if it sounds crazy or messy, I don’t judge. I just write.\n\nExpression will lighten your heavy heart.\n\nFind the blessings.\n\nIn every tragedy, or painful time, there are blessings. They don’t justify the pain, but when you keep your heart open to the goodness, you can see the way through. Whatever your struggle is today, claim your openness to the blessings that have yet to appear and then give them room to rush in.\n\nHope will lighten your heavy heart.\n\nMake time to heal.\n\nThe best strategies in the world will not speed up the healing process. You need time, and there is no good answer to “how long?” It will take as long as it takes. You can’t rush your heart. We said goodbye to our sweet dog Guinness more than 6 months ago. My heart is lighter than it was in the days that followed that painful goodbye, but there are still days when I get teary, or really, really miss him.\n\nPatience will lighten your heavy heart.\n\nTake action.\n\nWhen you feel hopeless or helpless, taking action helps. Give your time, talent, and treasure with the intention of relieving someone’s pain. In a recent essay, author Elizabeth Gilbert said, “But when the world starts to feel overwhelming in its sorrows, I always ask myself to look around me — to narrow down my focus — and to notice somebody who is nearby me, who is suffering. I can’t help the millions, but maybe I can help one. You never have to look very far to find a suffering soul.”\n\nGive in the best way you can, and don’t let anyone tell you your gift isn’t enough. It is.\n\nContribution will lighten your heavy heart.\n\nShare your heart.\n\nCall a friend. Share something on your favorite social platform. Reach out and share your heart. Give others a chance to say, “yes, me too.”\n\nSolidarity will lighten your heavy heart.\n\nIf your heart is heavy today, and it’s too soon to consider these recommendations, come back when you’re ready. In the meantime, be open to the light and look for the stars."
