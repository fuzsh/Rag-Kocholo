        "text": "Most mornings, I try to get outside to notice and breath in, the wonder of God’s handiwork. And my heart is full of the abundance and color and design and loveliness. It is a highlight and sets the mood for my day.\n\nThe Bible represents the whole of creation, what we call the natural world, as being caught up in the dance of joy and celebration. The trees in the forest clap their hands, the mountains and hills are bursting with joy, the brooks are bubbling with laughter. As the musical, The Sound of Music states it—the hills are alive with the sound of music.\n\nWith each new day, the birds start their singing, the flowers open their petals to the sunlight and warmth, the animals resume their busy activity with delight. As GK Chesterton observed, It’s as though, with each new day, God says “do it again.”\n\nLet the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;\n\nlet the sea roar, and all that fills it;\n\nlet the field exult, and everything in it!\n\nThen shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy\n\nbefore the Lord, for he comes. (Psalms 96:11-13)\n\nDo you experience joy when you encounter the beauty and aliveness of the creation? How often do you get outside to be reminded of the glorious creation? God has made a world brimming with beauty, and he has made us with the capacity to appreciate the beauty. As Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote, “The world is charged with the grandeur of God.”\n\nThe Old Testament Hebrew poetry employs numerous words for joy: “merriment,” “gladness,” “happy,” “laughter,” “wonder,” “exuberance,” “exulting,” “praise,” “worship,” “shout,” “sing,” “delight,” and “blessed.” Even dancing becomes a synonym for joy, as in “you have turned for me my mourning into dancing, you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy” (Psalm. 30:11). It’s as though the creation is saying to us: What are you waiting for, you children of God? Don’t you get it? Surely you would want to join in the dance as well. I confess, I have never been much of a dancer, but when I am caught up with the beauty of God’s wonderful world, my heart is dancing.\n\nAll these things point us to a God who is beautiful, wise, loving, and lavish with his gifts.\n\nThe heavens declare the glory of God,\n\nand the sky above proclaims his handiwork.\n\nYes, there is also evidence of a fall—thorns, thistles, weeds, and decay. In addition, we find abuse, exploitation, and pollution. But in spite of all this, it is still true that the earth breaks through with God’s beauty. And even though our senses are dulled by the fall, we are still able to respond to that beauty with joy and gratitude.\n\nAre you having a blah day? We all do. But that’s no reason to stay in the gloom. Sometimes we need to lift our eyes to the heavens, see the lovely green trees against the blue sky. If it is a dreary day, I am reminded of the importance of the rain and moisture for the growth of all these beautiful gifts. And the Lord turns my mourning into dancing (Psalm 30:11).\n\nOne of my favorite hymns is “We Plow the Fields and Scatter,” originally written by Matthias Claudius in 1782. More recently it was included in the Godspell Musical with a new tune. It is a harvest hymn, but one that serves as a reminder that “every good and perfect gift comes from above, from the Father of lights” (James 1:17).\n\nYou can find the 1973 Godspell version here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mURti-s0jc\n\nIt never fails to fill my heart with joy.\n\nWe plow the fields, and scatter the good seed on the land,\n\nBut it is fed and watered by God’s almighty hand.\n\nHe sends the snow in winter, the warmth to swell the grain,\n\nThe breezes and the sunshine, and soft refreshing rain.\n\nRefrain\n\nAll good gifts around us\n\nAre sent from heaven above;\n\nThen thank the Lord, O thank the Lord\n\nFor all His love.\n\nHe only is the Maker of all things near and far;\n\nHe paints the wayside flower, He lights the evening star.\n\nThe winds and waves obey Him, by Him the birds are fed;\n\nMuch more, to us His children, He gives our daily bread.\n\nWe thank Thee then, O Father, for all things bright and good,\n\nThe seed-time and the harvest, our life, our health, and food.\n\nAccept the gifts we to offer for all Thy love imparts,\n\nAnd, what Thou desirest, our humble, thankful hearts.\n\nI am writing this on July 4th, the commemoration of American Independence. We have witnessed an amazing display of fireworks in our city. But nothing to be compared to God’s amazing fireworks display of Aurora Borealis, or the Northern Lights.\n\n“The world is charged with the grandeur of God.” –Gerard Manley Hopkins"
