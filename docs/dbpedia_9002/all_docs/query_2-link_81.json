        "text": "26 Shares\n\n\"What Makes My Heart Sing?\" is one of my absolute favourite coaching exercises. I've used it with individual clients and in innumerable workshops. It's a powerful tool for awakening and happiness—and it's incredibly simple too!\n\nThe power in this tool is the realisation that what makes us happy is usually free—and easy to do. So why aren't we doing these things more often? Why are we so busy chasing material goals?\n\nBut I get ahead of myself.\n\nIn this article you'll find instructions on how to use What Makes My Heart Sing 1) with a client or prospect, 2) in a group or workshop AND 3) how to use it online in a Zoom webinar or similar. Also, scroll down to find a video of a Tools Clinic with Emma-Louise using this tool!\n\nHow to use this Powerful Coaching Exercise\n\n1) How to use What Makes My Heart Sing? with a Client or Prospect\n\nSimply ask your client to make a list of everything that \"makes their heart sing!\".\n\nFirst, frame up the exercise: It's when you feel happy and at peace with yourself and the world—you feel light and free.\n\nWriting this list can be done IN session or given as homework.\n\nThen once, the list is complete I review it with them. I ask what they notice about their list.\n\nEventually, if they don't mention it, I'll point out that most (if not all!) of the things are FREE and EASY to do.\n\nI let that sink in for a moment. I'll ask what they're thinking right now? What do they feel?\n\nI'll ask why they think they don't do more of these things in their life?\n\nThen we'll identify up to 3 actions to bring more of the 'heart sing' items into their life.\n\nGet your What Makes My Heart Sing Tool here:\n\n2) How to use What Makes My Heart Sing? in a Workshop\n\nI love, love, LOVE running this exercise in a Group session. The ideas and wisdom that come out of a collective review and discussion of this question are incredibly powerful—and can be life-changing for some people.\n\nFirst, frame up the exercise: It's when you feel happy and at peace with yourself and the world—you feel light and free. And It's extremely helpful to give some examples like running barefoot in the grass, watching a sunset, climbing a mountain, a night with friends, watching dogs or children play, relaxing in the bath etc.\n\nThen get your attendees into groups of 3-4 people, and get them to discuss the answer to the question, \"What Makes My Heart Sing?\". I usually give them around 5 minutes to do this.\n\nWhen the time is up, ask someone from each group to share with the rest of the attendees what makes their heart sing.\n\nI like to write these up on a whiteboard or flipchart so everyone can see what is on there.\n\nOnce every group has shared, I simply ask the question, \"So, what do you notice about this list?\"\n\nIt's interesting because each group is different. And I love getting the attendees to really think.\n\nI've had all kind of answers to this question, and about 50% of the time someone spots that most of the things listed by people are 'free' or 'easy' to do. If not, then after a few moments I share this with them.\n\nAnd this is the big learning here: If we look at the list of things people have identified, most of them are:\n\n1) FREE (or inexpensive) and\n\n2) Really EASY to do.\n\nI let that sink in for a moment. I'll ask what they're thinking right now.\n\nAnd of course the big question is: If these things that \"make your heart sing\" are free and easy to do, why aren't we doing more of them?\n\nIf you have time you could ask: \"So, why is it do you think, that we have the opportunity for happiness right on our doorstep and we don't do these things more?\" Really powerful learnings and insights will come from a group review of this question.\n\nFinally, I ask each attendee to come up with a minimum of 1 action (up to a maximum of 3 actions), that they can 100% commit to, to bring more of what \"makes their heart sing\" into their lives.\n\nAnd to wrap up this portion of the workshop, I find it's powerful to ask each person to share one of their actions with the group. It's great to reinforce both individual commit to the actions and to reinforce and expand each person's learning from this exercise.\n\n3) How to use this tool with an online group in Zoom (or similar)\n\nFollow the same structure as with the workshop above.\n\nBut for the Group Discussion portion\n\n1) If you have a \"Breakout room\" function, then use that function to put people into groups of 3-4 people to discuss.\n\n2) And if you don't have a \"Breakout room\" function\n\nAsk everyone to create their initial list of ideas individually.\n\nThen for the sharing and review portion, each individual can share their ideas with the group. This can be in the \"Chat\" function or verbally if you have that option.\n\nWrite down people's ideas and responses down as you go and summarise/group together what people said at the end.\n\nIf you have Whiteboard or screen-sharing options, you can type people's answers onto your screen as they say them out loud instead.\n\nAnd for the Individual Sharing parts\n\nIf your group is large, get them to share their thoughts or actions in the \"Chat\".\n\nAnd if it's a smaller group, then it's great to get each person to unmute themselves and share with the group.\n\nWatch this Tools Clinic: What Makes My Heart Sing?\n\nLearn even more about this tool, and see it demo'd firsthand by Emma-Louise here!\n\nGet What Makes My Heart Sing in the Self-Discovery Toolkit!\n\nWrap-up\n\nI recommend either using our ready-made What Makes My Heart Sing? Tool, or creating your own worksheet with fun graphics and specifically—a space for 1) their list and 2) to write down their actions. We all know that when we write things down, we see them more clearly.\n\nThis is a powerful exercise to help your clients find more happiness - where they are. It's a HUGE learning for many people that what most satisfies us can be both easy to do and free. This exercise may even be the start point for questioning many other things in their lives previously taken for granted or things they had not looked at any other way than how they have been told...\n\nIf you liked this article you may also like:\n\nCoaching Tools 101: 5 Coaching Tools You Can Use for Awesome Workshops\n\nCoaching Tools 101: Why Use Coaching Tools & Exercises in Workshops?\n\nHow To Create MEANINGFUL Goals With The Wheel of Life Template!\n\nContributing Author:\n\nEmma-Louise Elsey has been coaching since 2003 and is the Founder of The Coaching Tools Company and Fierce Kindness.com.
