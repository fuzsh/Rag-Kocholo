        "text": "The words happiness and joy are dotted frequently throughout the Bible. I would venture to say that most of us have heard there is a difference between Biblical joy and happiness. So, since I like to look to the Bible for advice about such things, I decided to do a little fun research on the words.\n\nThe land of the internet tells me that this is a much-debated question.\n\nSome say happiness is external and is a sign of joy, or that happiness is something the world gives us, and joy is a deep emotion that comes only from the Lord. Others say that in many Bible translations, the two words are used interchangeably. Just as we use many different words for the feelings of joy or happiness, the languages of the Bible do also.\n\nIs There A Difference Between Joy And Happiness?\n\nI was tempted at this point to turn around and choose another subject since I am far from a Bible language scholar. But I decided to be adventurous and plow on through.\n\nIn Galatians 5:22, the fruit of the Spirit verse, Strongs NIV Exhaustive Concordance, translates the word ‘joy’ to the Greek word chara, and uses these words and phrases to describe the meaning: joy; rejoicing; happiness; gladness; filled with or full of joy; happiness, glad; happy; overjoyed; pleasant.\n\nInstead of debating the differences and isolating these words in individual use, let’s look at them collectively in active use in the Scriptures. We won’t be digging deeply into the technical differences between the two words but instead will focus on the uses of these words and their similarities in the Scriptures.\n\nWhen God’s Happiness Is Our Happiness (How To Have Joy And Happiness)\n\nChristians would most likely agree that the state of well-being we experience as children of God far surpasses the joy of a new car. Both are good things, but the lasting joy of being in Christ Jesus, forgiven and saved from sin, far outweighs the fleeting “new car” smell and feel.\n\nWhen Jesus Christ comes to life in us, we experience a fullness of joy that is hard to describe. This joy of the Lord goes with us every day, but our emotions still soar and dip over daily matters, both minor and life changing.\n\nEven as we go through life in this fallen world, and must deal with all that it brings to our lives, we still have the everlasting joy of salvation, and we carry with us the hope of the glory of God.\n\nThe apostle Paul went about his work of spreading the gospel with a cheerful heart, yet he never forgot the things he did before he entered into the Christian life.\n\nHe counted his various trials and hardships as a way to identify with Christ’s sufferings for him. He suffered as a believer for the sake of Christ yet was joyful. He had very little to his name, yet he considered it great gain to be satisfied with what he had.\n\nGod’s goodness is all around us, yet we often fail to see or remember that goodness when we allow our emotions to get the better of us. It’s all too easy to forget how to have Christian joy when we are in the midst of distressing circumstances.\n\nIn John 15:11, Jesus says “I have told you these things so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete”. This is immediately following His teaching on abiding in Him and bearing fruit, earlier in the chapter, verses 1-8.\n\nIf we are not abiding, or clinging to Him, taking our constant nourishment from Him, we will be unfruitful, and will be thrown aside and destroyed.\n\nSo then – it’s either utter destruction (without Him) or it’s true joy (with Him). The choice Is ours.\n\nHappy and Joyful Scriptures\n\nThese verses are just a few of the many passages in the Bible that contain forms of both the words happy and joyful. (Scriptures are taken from the New Century Version unless otherwise noted)\n\nThis first group of verses speak of the people singing songs of joy, dancing, and giving shouts of joy. These are examples of God’s people giving God the praise and the glory He deserves, and has given us the job of doing.\n\nMany of these happy praises were given when the people were in the thick of it, surrouded or freshly rescued from enemies that were all around them. As God’s people, we also can praise like this, because He has rescued us from the enemy of death and hell forever.\n\nEven when we are in distress because of the sins of others, difficult temptations, false teachings, or other signs of this fallen world, we still have our God to praise to the highest heavens for what He has done for us.\n\nThe apostle Paul preached, and gathered converts to Christ into churches as he traveled on his missionary journeys. He appointed leaders to continue on in these churches when he moved on. After he left, he encouraged these churches by sending them letters.\n\nThe three passages above are excerpts from some of Paul’s letters. He is reminding the Christians of their great joy when they first heard the Good News and became believers.\n\nSome of them were being tempted by false teachers, and many were persecuted for their faith. They needed strong leaders and encouragement to keep the faith and revive their joyful hearts.\n\nThe progression of the above three verses tell us of wonderful reasons to be happy and joyful. From Christs birth announcements, to the news of His death and sacrifice in order to save us from eternal death, to the assurance of being with Him in paradise.\n\nThese last two passages tell of the suffering that we can expect to endure as believers. We are to be happy in the suffering and look forward to His return in glory, and our great reward in heaven.\n\nThis last passage is what we can say no matter what is going on. If we have welcomed Him, He has made our hearts pure. No matter what happened to us to get us to this point, it no longer matters. He no longer sees our sin and has wiped out all of our guilt! Hallelujah!\n\nFor more Bible verses on the subject of joy, you can read 20 Scriptures About Joy.\n\nHow To Have True Happiness And Joy Despite External Factors\n\nMost of the above verses were written in less than happy external circumstances. But God’s people found joy and happiness in Him no matter what. Often the world tries to tell us that if we have money we will have all that we need. But sadly for many, this is a tragically untrue age-old lie.\n\nIf you are conflicted about money or convinced that it is the answer to all of your problems, you may want to read Breaking Free: What The Bible Says About The Love Of Money. If you struggle with contentment in any and every circumstance, Five Secrets To Living A Life Of Contentment may be for you.\n\nThe New Testament church was an amazing example of joy in the presence of shockingly difficult situations. They found happiness in the presence of God, no matter what was happening around them.\n\nTheir faith was from God and it was tested frequently, even daily. They had even greater joy when they came through the hard times with even stronger attitudes of praise and thankfulness for God’s gift of hope.\n\nWe too, can be just that joyful. Whatever we focus on becomes our world. When our world revolves around God’s goodness, we have nothing to complain about, nothing to worry about, nothing to focus on except the Rock of our salvation, and how we can go about doing His work.\n\nIf the desires of your heart are physical, emotional, or circumstance-based, it’s time to focus on the Good News – the gospel of Jesus Christ. There is a better way, sister, that will lead you in the way to true happiness.\n\nThe path of this life sometimes feels like it’s going nowhere. If you’re on the true path of life you’ll know it leads to eternal joy and happiness.\n\nThe emotions we feel this side of heaven have nothing on what we will celebrate in our souls every single day forever. Not just for hundreds of years, or even thousands, but forever and ever.\n\nAnd now, my conclusion on the debate I spoke of in the opening paragraphs?\n\nWhen we are happy we have joy and when we are joyful we have happiness – I really could not discern the difference, or there is such a fine line that it’s mostly invisible, and doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of God’s plan.\n\nEnjoy this timeless song, and remember…”still my soul will sing Your praise unending….ten thousand years and then forevermore!”\n\n\\"
