        "text": "Happiness and joy are at times synonyms for one another however they are indeed two very different things. To prove it, the bible speaks of joy much more often than the word happy or happiness. Listen in as Chrystal speaks about how you can obtain true, sustainable joy!\n\nIf you prefer to read, the manuscript is below!\n\nHappiness and joy are at times synonyms for one another however they are indeed to very different things. To prove it, the bible speaks of joy much more often than the word happy or happiness.\n\nJoy is a consistent state of peace and is internally cultivated. It’s deeper than happiness and goes down to the spirit and soul. Happiness on the other hand typically is based on external factors. For example, we often hear “That food made me happy” or “I just want to be happy”.\n\nThose statements place our state of peace into something else. This can cause conflict because external factors are always changing. The food you eat today may be good and tomorrow not so good. You may be having a happy day at work today and tomorrow it’s like you walked into hell. Solely relying on the state of things to make you happy ultimately can cause failure.\n\nHow many times have you said to yourself “I just want to be happy!” We think we want happiness but our spirit and soul really desire joy - the internal, constant state of well being and peace. Hence, Galatians 5 lists joy as one of the fruits of the Spirit.\n\n“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.”\n\nGalatians 5:22\n\nJoy dwells in us as believers in Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit. This misunderstanding of looking for joy in anything else causes detriment. How many times have we or heard of others place happiness into their careers, marriage, children, etc? Then something goes wrong, like a job loss, and they totally lose it! They become anxious, depressed, confused, the list can go on.\n\nThis is because joy and happiness looked pure on the outside but because it wasn’t rooted internally in Christ, the joy left when the circumstance changed.\n\nThe adversary has manipulated the minds of people to believe that they can obtain happiness through external factors when the only way joy can be obtained and sustained is through Jesus Christ. The adversary wants to steal our joy so he can sap our strength.\n\nSo we must ask ourselves “Are we desiring happiness or true joy?” I would say it is the latter.\n\n“The Lord is my strength and my shield; My heart trusts in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, And with my song I will praise Him.”\n\nPsalm 28:7\n\n“Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.”\n\nRomans 15:13\n\nWhen we anchor ourselves and faith in the Lord, He gives us unspeakable joy. At that point happiness is developed and we find happiness in all things.\n\nMoral of the Story: The more we focus on him the more joyful and happier we become.\n\n“You will show me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.”\n\nPsalm 16:11"
