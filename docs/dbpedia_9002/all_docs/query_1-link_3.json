        "meta_description": "My heart is overflowing with joy and gratitude to God for leading me to Christian Science. I was living in South Africa when this Science came into my life, just when I was greatly in need of health. I had suffered for many years with severe nervous headaches, and was practically a nervous wreck. Like the woman spoken of in the Scriptures, I had spent all my earnings on physicians and was no better. When I could not get help from physicians I tried all the patent medicines I saw advertised, studied psychology and had treatment from a psychologist, but found myself growing worse. I was advised to wear an electric belt; then I tried a galvanic battery, but received no help whatever. Then my husband took me to a sanitarium, where I spent three months undergoing a certain treatment. I was told if I continued it for twelve months I should be cured, but instead I became worse. Then, after all this searching for health, I was led to Christian Science by one who was not a Christian Scientist, but who knew of its healing power. I at once got the textbook, &quot;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&quot; by Mary Baker Eddy. For three weeks I did not leave the house, but just sat reading this wonderful book, until a practitioner told me to read less and apply it more to my daily life. As the truth unfolded to me I realized that I was healed, and I experienced that unspeakable peace and joy which words can never express. I felt so grateful to our beloved Leader for giving this beautiful teaching to the world. I was also healed of neuritis, bronchitis, ptomaine poisoning, fish poisoning which had circulated through the blood and from which I suffered for many years, a very bad attack of influenza, abscess in the head, and many minor ailments. Words can never express my gratitude to God and to our dear Leader for these healings. I am also very grateful for the wonderful protection I experienced in two motor accidents.",

I should like to express my gratitude for membership in The Mother Church and in a branch church, and for the privilege of sharing in the activities of a branch church. We left South Africa in 1929 and came to reside in Trinidad; I do thank God for the wonderful help I have received and am receiving through Christian Science since coming to live here. I fully realize that there is only the one real atmosphere, the atmosphere of Love.â€”(Mrs.)Gertrude A. Gemmell, Trinidad, British West Indies."
