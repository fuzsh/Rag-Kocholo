        "text": "Listen to this devotion\n\nJoy — an attitude of the heart\n\nIn the Word\n\nThough the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in God my Savior (Habakkuk 3:17–18).\n\nOf the Word\n\nWhere do we find joy? Commercials would have us believe it is found in the latest anti-aging cream, the newest diet, the finest automobile. If that were true, what happens when the wrinkles appear, the pounds don’t drop off, or the car breaks down?\n\nYoung Mary knew the source of true joy when she sang … my spirit rejoices in God my Savior (Luke 1:47).\n\nJoy is not dependent on having or not having things. It is an attitude of the heart. When we rejoice in the Lord, environment and possessions take their proper places in our lives.\n\nToday’s woman might reword Habakkuk’s words in this way: “Though gasoline prices are higher than I like, though my hours at work are long and stressful, though my responsibilities weigh heavily upon me, though my house is too small and my bills are too big, yet I will rejoice in the Lord.”\n\nWalking with my Lord\n\nLord, when earthly things block my heavenly view, remind me that You are God. Help me to find my greatest joy in You. Thank You for Your love. In Jesus’ name. Amen.\n\nMustard Seed: Living in Joy. Authors: Dcs.
