        "text": "If I read the gospels correctly, the marks of the followers of Jesus should be peace, rest, and joy. This peace is not fragile like the so-called peace the world gives. This is a peace that is not the victim of the unpredictable circumstances of life. It is a peace that settles the troubled heart and calms anxiety, even in the midst of chaos. And the rest that Jesus promised is a rest we can know even when we are working, because we don’t plow through this world alone. The heavy lifting is what Jesus came to do. As we learn from Him more and more about what God is like and discover His amazing intentions for us, long term, we come to trust what He is up to in our lives and trust the process life uses to get us there.\n\nEach of these qualities of life (peace, rest, and joy) is a result, not a cause. Looking at life from this end, as Bill and I now can, we have begun to recognize some of the beautiful teachings of our Lord that result in a life of peace, rest, and joy. We have had to learn these principles He taught by making a lot of mistakes and hitting a few walls. God’s love really does take “all things” and weave them into the fabric of “good” when we have a heart for God, He gently teaches us bit by bit the things that lead to a life of peace, rest, and joy—eventually.\n\nOver coffee one morning recently, we made a list of ten things we have come to recognize as God’s best paths to rest, peace and joy. We all learn the words on this list, but to live ourselves into actually making them a part of who we are—well, that doesn’t happen overnight. You can probably add to this list the things you, too, wish you had known from the beginning, but can probably only learn by experience.\n\nINTEGRITY: Be real, be honest, be transparent, be true. The word integrity comes from integrated. I must ask myself: when someone looks at me, do they see the same person from every angle. My mother used to say that a person of integrity is “all wool and a yard wide.” She was a seamstress and loved fine fabrics. She especially liked a fabric that was woven from pure natural fibers—all linen, all cotton, all silk, all wool. This meant that the long fibers had been combed smooth and woven tightly both ways—the warp (the fibers that ran lengthways) and the woof (the fibers that ran crossways), woven so consistently that the resulting garment would hold its shape through wear and washings over time. It was beautiful on both sides. In life, the people with integrity are honest, transparent, and not only tell the truth, but are true. Integrity means that in every circumstance of life all areas of life are integrated into one person. Integrity means that no time needs to be wasted “covering your tail.”\n\nPASSION: When the world seems to suck the energy from our work, can we keep our passion for our calling? The world is dying for want of passion. If we can keep focused on the things that last forever, God will renew the passion for our purpose. We eventually learn that our inner life and our outer life have to be in balance. Someone has rightly said, “The thing that will most likely destroy your ministry will be ministry itself.” When our “on stage” life in any vocation becomes our real life, we’re in trouble.\n\nPERSPECTIVE: In any situation, take a step back and allow the issue at hand to take its rightful place in the grand scheme of things. Know and read enough history to learn to not allow today’s one present situation or incident to hide the big picture. You can eclipse the moon with a dime, if you hold the dime close enough to your eye. Learn to ask yourself, “In the light of eternity, how much importance will this have?” I like to tell myself, “Think forever.”\n\nCOMPASSION: Don’t allow yourself to be encased in a comfort cocoon. God always shoves us out of our comfort zones. Be awake to what people around us are experiencing: pain, loss, tragedy, disappointments, reversals, successes, breakthroughs—in our families, our communities, our area, our world. This demands more than a donation; it demands involvement. Listen. Care. Respond. Let our hearts be broken by the things that break the heart of God, but also really rejoice with those who rejoice!\n\nSTEWARDSHIP: We are all called, whether we have little or much, to use well and wisely whatever resources we have—physically, spiritually, intellectually, financially, emotionally.\n\nGENEROUSITY: Live outward. Relationships—marriage, friendships, parenting, sibling relationships, worship—are not barter. Give without strings attached, but with wisdom, to affect change and help to lift others higher toward healthy relationships. Let’s commit to leave others who are in our lives better because of their relationship with us.\n\nPERSERVERENCE: Don’t give up, Don’t quit. Remember Who is in the harness of life with us. We are not alone, and though the world is not our kingdom, God so loved the world that He gave Himself for it. He made it. He loved it. He redeemed it. See the big picture; think “forever”. Don’t give up on the world or yourself.\n\nEXPECTANCY: Our dear friend and mentor, Ann Smith, has taught us to start each day with expectancy, not expectations. If we start today with expectations, we will almost certainly be disappointed. But if we live with expectancy, we will always be surprised and amazed at what obstacles God moves and what wonders He brings. Recognize the miracles we trip over every day, praying for miracles.\n\nGRATITUDE: I’m not sure whether to start with gratitude or end with it. Maybe both. No matter what, if we’re awake and alive, “thank you” is always a good place to start. And end. Learn to notice. Fill our hearts with gratitude. Make a “grateful list”—not of just things, but people, relationships, kindnesses, gifts of encouragement, beauty, conveniences, tender gestures. Be thankful for our minds and health, for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, textures....\n\nCONTENTMENT: The Apostle Paul said it best: “I have learned in whatever state I find myself, therewith to be content.” Rest contentedly knowing that you are known, you are loved, you are real, and you matter.\n\nPeace and rest come from these ten qualities at work in every day. Peace and rest are the inevitable result. These are what our Father intends for us. Seeing us have them brings Him—and us—great JOY!"
