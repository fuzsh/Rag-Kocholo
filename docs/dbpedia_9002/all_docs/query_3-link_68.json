It’s like a beautiful melody that has been playing in my heart ever since we first met.\n\nThere’s a saying that those who are meant to be together will always find a way, defying all odds, and I believe this to be true. It feels like destiny has woven our paths together. I want to express my profound gratitude for the serendipitous journey that has brought us to this special moment.\n\nI used to think when I met you, I would ask you what took you so long, but now I understand that every moment of waiting has served a purpose. It has been a divine preparation, shaping me into the person I am today, ready to embark on this remarkable journey with you.\n\nThinking about spending my whole life with you, enjoying life’s wonderful moments, and growing old together makes me very happy and excited. Since you came into my life, everything feels happier and more beautiful. You have illuminated my very soul with your warmth and love.\n\nAs we continue this incredible journey together, I want you to know that my love for you grows stronger with each passing day. I promise to cherish, honor, and protect the love that we share, to stand by your side through thick and thin, and to celebrate every joy with you.\n\nIn your embrace, I’ve found my home, my sanctuary, and my forever. With you, life’s journey becomes a beautiful adventure, and I eagerly await the chapters we will write together. With you, I have found a love that is deep, true, and everlasting. I am eternally grateful for the day our paths crossed, for it led me to you.\n\nForever and always!"
