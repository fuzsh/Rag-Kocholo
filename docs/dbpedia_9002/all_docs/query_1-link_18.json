        "text": "By Logan Stogner\n\nI’ve had a front-row seat to God’s salvation work. I have seen Him transform the hearts of atheists, Buddhists, and relativists. I cannot express the joy that overwhelmed my soul every time He used me as a conduit. I’ve experienced much of what this world offers, and nothing—NOTHING—compares to knowing Christ, and making Him known. With my heart overtaken by joy, all I can do is share it with the world.\n\nSeven years ago, Christ’s love compelled me to develop a discipleship course (click HERE to learn more). In Session 16, I teach my three-step method for sharing our faith, and now, I want to share it with you.\n\nP.A.S.\n\nThere are many ways to share the Gospel. Spend any time in the Bible and you see the Gospel shared through hearing the Word of God, visions, healing, discipleship of parents and grandparents and so much more. The church in Philippi started with Paul engaging with the first three people in different ways. Therefore, I will not offer a cookie-cutter method and state, “You must follow this method.” Instead, here’s a simple, three-step overview that helps me organize my thoughts.\n\nStep 1: Pray\n\nWithout God, we can do nothing (John 15:5). With Him, all things are possible (Matthew 19:26). So, we must connect and live and share our lives with Him first.\n\nI pray for the person’s salvation. I’ll ask my Heavenly Father to remove her heart of stone and give her a new heart (Ezekiel 36:26). Second, I’ll ask for what I need. I pray, “Father, according to Ephesians 2:10, you have prepared good works for me. Grant me sight to see them. Make me aware of the opportunities that are in front of me. Give me courageto speak and inspire me with the right words. In the beautiful name of Jesus, amen.”\n\nStep 2: Assess\n\nThe diagnosis should always precede the prescription. Although we know the heart of the problem is the problem of the heart (Mark 7:14-23), what happens when we start with the prescription? Just like doctors conduct tests before prescribing medicine, we need to understand their worldview before we introduce the Gospel.\n\nThe most effective way to gain a deep understanding of their worldview is to imitate Jesus; He asked many open-ended questions and listened well. In no particular order, here are some questions you can ask: Where do you go to church? Where do you find meaning? How do you address anxiety? After we die, what do you think happens to us? To you, who is Jesus? I’m curious to know… do you have any spiritual beliefs? If Christianity were true, would you become a Christian? Then, fully listen to the answer – not just the words, but the heart of the answer.\n\nStep 3: Speak the Gospel\n\nIt doesn’t matter how patient, kind, and gentle we are, people won’t be able to guess the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Kindness is good but not sufficient. No one can figure out the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus for our salvation by us holding a door open for them or giving a compliment. We must tell them.\n\nWhen you share the Good News, try to keep the conversation Jesus-centered. Talk about the solution 100 times more than you speak about the problem.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to present the Gospel is the three-circles method. Our lead pastor, Brandon, has an excellent video explaining the three circles. To view his video, click HERE. Trust God will give you the words and know that the Word of God never returns void (Isaiah 55:10-11).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSo, I implore you this week to take some time communing with God and see who He places on your heart. Then pray for them. Assess where their heart is. Then speak the Truth to them in love. Scripture says when one sinner repents, there is much rejoicing in Heaven (Luke 15:10). Imagine the rejoicing and celebration in Heaven if we all took some time to P.A.S (pray, assess, and speak the gospel)? Try it out and see where it leads you. Pass it on."
