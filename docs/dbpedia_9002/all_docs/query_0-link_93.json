        "text": "\"Lori was such a joy to work with throughout our prenatal care. She is one of the most kindhearted and caring people I know. That caring heart pours over into her work and she was there for me when it really counted. Our \"Plan A\" birth plan was not going to be the case with the birth of our son Luke - he was breech and a big boy. A c-section was scheduled and when Lori offered to be at the hospital with us I immediately took her up on the offer, and I thank God that I did!\n\nWhen Luke was delivered he had to be taken to NICU for further tests and I only got to see him for a few moments. We were separated for the first 12 hours - and I don't think I could have gotten through that time without Lori's help. After recovery she met me in my room, while my husband stayed with Luke. Her congratulations and smiling face brought me joy though the fear. She immediately asked the nurse for a breast pump and assured me that what Luke needed was my milk and she was going to help me get some to him. That gave me purpose when I felt useless; she hooked me up to the breast pump and cheered for the ever so small amount of colostrum that I produced. Her professionalism with the hospital nurses, knowledge for my needs and kind, loving nature is priceless. Even when things don't go as planned she encouraged me and I am forever grateful to her. She will always hold a special place in my heart as the one who walked me though the first steps of being a mommy.\" - Carrie"
