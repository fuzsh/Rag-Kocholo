        "text": "Chelsey Hare is the director of communications for the National Shrine of Our Lady of Champion – the first and only approved Marian apparition site in the United States. After working in public relations, Hare felt called to use her gifts for the Church, and to share the incredible news of the Blessed Virgin Mary appearing in the U.S. Corbin Hubbell, social media coordinator for the Catholic Diocese of Lincoln, sat down virtually with Hare in July to discuss the National Shrine of Our Lady of Champion. What follows is an edited transcript of that interview.\n\nCorbin Hubbell, Southern Nebraska Register: Tell us about Our Lady of Champion and her apparition to Adele.\n\nChesley Hare, director of communications for the National Shrine of Our Lady of Champion: This happened in 1859. Adele was walking through the rugged woods of northeastern Wisconsin, when she saw the Blessed Virgin Mary, three times. She was walking to the grist mill to make sure that she was helping provide for her family when she first saw this mysterious woman. The second and third time, she was on her way to Mass when she saw the Blessed Virgin. When she was coming home after receiving the Holy Eucharist, being advised by her priest to ask in God’s name, [she asked] “who are you and what do you want of me?”\n\nThat third time, our Blessed Mother ... introduced herself as the Queen of Heaven, who prays for the conversion of sinners, and asked Adele to do the same. They had a longer message than that. But in terms of what it can break down to Our Lady of Champion, she asked that we, as her children, offer our Communion for the conversion of others… knowing the power of the sacraments. And she asked Adele specifically to go into this wild country, and teach the children what they should know for salvation, especially the sign of the cross, the Catechism and how to approach and receive their first holy Communion and how to approach the sacraments in general.\n\nThat was the heart of Our Lady’s message to Adele, it was a very catechetical message. And it happened in Champion, Wisconsin, of all places – it’s farmland country, very small and humble space. But it’s where Our Lady comes and meets us and you can feel the presence of the site. It was investigated in 2010, and approved by the Bishop of the Diocese of Green Bay. And we’re just so grateful for the ability to share the message and that Our Lady is here for us in the United States. She appeared for all of us, not just for Adele.\n\nInterview continues after photos\n\nSNR: You mentioned it was approved by the bishop of the diocese. How do Marian apparitions get approved in general? Are we still waiting for anything? Is there a process to this? What does that look like?\n\nHare: Yes, there’s actually a recent update with the process for newly investigated apparitions. Pope Francis just came out with a new document that breaks down the process. But prior to that, the powers to approve and to investigate were given to the local bishop.\n\nAnd so when it was investigated in 2010, the bishop compiled a large group of Maryologists and theologians to rigorously investigate the apparitions.… After compiling all the findings, the bishop, through prayer and discernment [found] that this place does have supernatural character, and it is worthy of belief by the Christian faithful. And with all Marian apparitions, it’s not obligatory to believe i, to be Catholic. This is something that is a private devotion for us to just grow in appreciation of our Lord, and true devotion to Mary will always bring us back to Jesus.\n\nSNR: Tell us about The Shepherd Project, and how the Shrine is encouraging people to pray for bishops.\n\nHare: The Shepherd Project was first started a couple years ago from the National Shrine of Our Lady of Champion. It came from ... bishops who need our prayers, they’re under attack more than ever, families are under attack more than ever.... And so, from May through October, the National Shrine of Our Lady of Champion prays for each bishop by name, every single day. And it starts from Wisconsin, where the shrine is located, and then emanates outward across the United States for each diocese, each bishop, then we include them in our Mass intentions each day. We have a perpetual candle that is lit in the apparition oratory, a sacred space where people can encounter Our Lady.… The response has just been incredible. We have thousands of people all across the country that are praying for each bishop, every single day.\n\nSNR: What is your advice for those looking to make a spiritual pilgrimage, and how can they make the most of their pilgrimage experience?\n\nHare: Factors to consider when determining, “Should I make a spiritual pilgrimage to a site like this” is to keep the intentions really close to your heart. What are you going to pilgrimage for? What prayers do you have, specifically? How do you want to hear our Lord through this pilgrimage? How is he going to guide you?\n\nWe ask that when you go on pilgrimage, to receive the sacraments, the shrine gives confession every single day, has daily Mass, so really encountering, you know, a receptivity for the graces that you will receive on pilgrimage, to be of a clean conscience to receive our Lord and the Blessed Sacrament. This is something that we always recommend for pilgrims to consider when going to a spiritual site like the shrine.\n\nAnd I think when you go to especially Marian apparition sites, there’s a level of peace that you feel that is just outer worldly… I’ve never felt something like that in my lifetime, other than going to these beautiful holy sites… I think it’s important for pilgrims to know that you are entering holy grounds, and how can you receive that? Or what are ways to find silence there to allow that to enter into your heart and your whole being. So I just recommend people take the time to be in silence on pilgrimage there to really feel that peace.\n\nSNR: Where can people learn more about the Shrine?\n\nHare: The shrine has a website, championshrine.org. That’s where you can find more information about the story of Our Lady of Champion, but also how to plan a pilgrimage and how to prepare one’s heart for pilgrimage. You can also follow us on social media @championshrine on all of the major platforms, like Facebook and Instagram. We hope to see you at the shrine and that you encounter just the presence of Our Lady of Champion."
