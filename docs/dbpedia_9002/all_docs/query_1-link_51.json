        "text": "Our beloved husband, father and grandfather, Richard Aaron Breckenridge, unexpectedly passed away from complications due to surgery on July 30, 2024 at Utah Valley Hospital in Provo, Utah. Richard was born August 14, 1956, to Robert Erwin Breckenridge and Joyce Coker Breckenridge in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nHe met the love of his life, DeEdra Webb, while both were students at Northern Arizona University. They married on October 11, 1980, in the Mesa Arizona Temple. He was able to spend 43 years of marriage to DeEdra, who was his best friend and eternal companion. Together they raised three children and they have ten beautiful grandchildren. Richard’s family was his greatest pride and joy in this life. He loved each of his children, Aaron (Micah), Brieanna (Sam) and Christopher (Malia) and is very proud of their successes and families. He loved being called grandpa and opa by his ten grandchildren, Grady, Jacoby, Dempsey, Finley, Savannah, Milo, Zia, Brielle, Claire, and Evelyn. He deeply loved and cared for his family. His generosity, kindness and love will be greatly missed.\n\nA member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he served as a full-time missionary in the Chile, Concepcion mission from 1978-1980. He served in many other callings in the church such as Elder’s quorum\n\npresident, stake mission leader, Bishop, second counselor in the stake presidency and counselor in the branch presidency of the MTC. His favorite calling was working with the youth.\n\nRichard would say that besides the role of father and grandfather there was no other role that brought him the greatest joy than that of coach. He coached for 30 years in a variety of sports - baseball, basketball and soccer. He coached soccer at Blue Ridge High School from 1997-2009 winning one state championship with the girls varsity team and six state championships with the boys varsity team. He was voted “Coach of the Year” many times but only accepted it a few times, wanting to give others the opportunity to receive that title. He also coached many club teams that traveled to several states and countries around the world. It was said of him, “We mourn the loss of Coach Breckenridge, whose impact on his players went far beyond the game of soccer, teaching them the importance of discipline, perseverance and the pursuit of excellence.” As with any coach he loved to win, but he loved seeing his players be successful in life more.\n\nRichard graduated from Northern Arizona University majoring in geology, chemistry and math. He worked in the power industry for 43 years becoming an expert in the field of water chemistry. He was very successful in his career which allowed him to travel the world. His knowledge and expertise were valued by his colleagues. He will be missed by all those whose lives he touched in the power industry.\n\nEven though Richard’s life ended too soon, he lived it to the fullest. His life was one of service, dedication, and love. He will be greatly missed by all those who knew him. Until we meet again.\n\nServices for Richard will be held August 16, 2024, at Larkin Mortuary in Riverton Utah. The viewing is from 10:00-11:15. The memorial service will begin at 11:30. He will be interred at the Herriman City Cemetery, Herriman Utah."
