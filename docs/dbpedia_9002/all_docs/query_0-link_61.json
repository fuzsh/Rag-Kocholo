        "text": "The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live.\n\nThe gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on.\n\nWe chase chickens or dogs away from it. Babies teethe at the corners. They scrape their knees under it.\n\nIt is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human. We make men at it, we make women.\n\nThe world will keep trudging through time without us\n\nWhen we lift from the story contest to fly home\n\nWe will be as falling stars to those watching from the edge\n\nOf grief and heartbreak\n\nMaybe then we will see the design of the two-minded creature\n\nAnd know why half the world fights righteously for greedy masters"
