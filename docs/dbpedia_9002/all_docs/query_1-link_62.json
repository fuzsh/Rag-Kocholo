        "text": "Welcome back to another installment of What’s Burning At The Killhouse, where we take the temperature of the squad and get some answers to some very important questions.\n\nMajors season has concluded for the men, and we have just one major remaining for the women. What’s one shot from the majors this year that will live in your memory for years to come, and why did it resonate?\n\nCody - Rory’s shot into the par-3 15th during the final round of the U.S. Open. There is no way it was going to end up short. And in my heart of hearts, I knew there was no way he way going to hit the green. But the thud followed by the camera work watching it rolling will stick with me for a while. Contrasting that with Bryson’s third shot left of 8 green, or his bunker shot on 18. The final 9 back and forth were all-time.\n\nKVV - Scottie Scheffler’s approach to the 9th green at Augusta on Sunday. Right before it happened, I turned to Kyle Porter and said “I bet he hits this to about a foot.” I am typically terrible at predictions, but it felt like Scheffler was done kidding around. I just had a weird sense he was going to grab hold of the tournament. That’s exactly what happened. He nearly made it, and the ball came to rest six inches from the cup.\n\nSoly - Scottie’s shot into the 9th green on Friday at the Masters is still haunting me. A really tough wind, back left pin, ball below his feet, and he slung it into the back shelf and made the birdie. My Scottie slurping went to an entirely different level having seen that shot in person.\n\nNeil - This may be recency bias, but Scottie Scheffler’s 3-wood into the par 3 17th at Troon on Saturday was among the best golf shots I’ve ever seen. He was one of the few players to hit the green at the 17th, and his 3 wood cut through brutal gusts of wind to end up 4 feet from the hole. Scottie did not win and did not play particularly well at The Open this year, but it’s shots like that that cement him as the best golfer in the world even during weeks when he isn’t in peak form. Scheffler’s ball striking is just different, and this shot was the embodiment of that difference.\n\nCasey - How about three shots in a row all from the same spot? I’m talking Nelly and her 10 on the par-3 12th at Lancaster Country Club during the U.S. Women’s Open. It took her three tries to get the ball to get up and stay up on the green after pitching her second shot out of the back bunker into the front water hazard. Those shots will live in my memory as proof that golf is hard for everyone, not just for the hacks like us who play for fun!\n\nBen - Bryson’s second shot on #18 at Pinehurst. After the excruciating finish to Rory’s round, Bryson’s punch out was the last glimmer of hope for Rory and the Block Party.\n\nJordan - Ayaka Furue’s eagle putt to win the Evian. I know there’s a lot of discourse about the merits of the Evian, but Ayaka was absolutely the best player that week – and has shown up big in most of the majors, as well! She’s just one piece of an incredibly stacked contingent from Japan that I’ve gotten a lot of joy from watching.\n\nD.J. - Scottie’s 3-wood into No. 17 on Saturday at The Open. It was 235, playing at least 270 into the wind and cold and Scottie nearly holed it. Obviously, it was Xander’s year at the majors, but as a distance control aficionado, no one made me happier to watch brutally difficult approach shots than Scottie, who seems to pull off about 3 times more of them than anyone else.\n\nTron - Ludvig’s soggy second shot on into 11 on Sunday in Augusta. I’ll remember that one when he wins there in the next couple years and draws upon what he learned that day. Success is the result of learning from failure.\n\nThe political season is upon us. If a presidential candidate asked for your support on the condition that they would use the executive power of the office to change one thing (big or small) within the world of golf, what would you ask they get done in exchange for your endorsement?\n\nSoly - Playing through.\n\nCody - There are thousands, if not millions of other more important topics that I hope POTUS is focused on, even in this hypothetical world. But I would double down on KVV’s Pace of Play issue below. Even though he plays at a fancy private club in Baltimore.\n\nKVV - Slow play at public courses. I’m convinced the most infuriating feeling in golf is being stuck behind a foursome where players leave their carts without a club to look for balls. I would ask POTUS to appoint a Pace of Play czar who would force players to pass a test outlining simple golf etiquette before they’re allowed to book tee times.\n\nNeil - I would push for a rider or earmark on some big infrastructure bill that reserved money to either fix up or build public par 3 courses in municipal parks around the country. I played the new Golden Gate par 3 course in San Francisco earlier this year. It was a fantastic experience, and I think well-designed short courses like this one are the future of golf, especially in urban areas. In most cities, there is already a par 3 like the newly renovated Golden Gate par 3. New York City has the Flushing Meadow Pitch n’ Putt, which has the location and lights to be a booming business if the course and amenities were renovated (I wrote about this here).\n\nCasey - Since moving to Las Vegas, I have been playing a ton of public golf and seeing a ton of really bad golf etiquette. Driving carts right up to the greens (and leaving them there while putting), not fixing pitch marks on the green, playing from tees that are too far back, having no awareness of where other people are on the hole or course, etc.. Like KVV, I would love for there to be a simple golf etiquette test people need to pass before they can go out by themselves to play.\n\nBen - Let’s do away with taking off hats before shaking hands after a round. More specifically, running your hand through your sweaty hair before shaking your playing partner's hands. Maybe it is just me and my haircut, but I have always felt that I look like an absolute idiot post-round with gnarly sweaty hat hair. Nothing noble about that look!\n\nJordan - Mansplainers on the range. The first unsolicited piece of bad swing advice is a $500 fine, then $1000, and so forth.\n\nD.J. - Make the Presidents Cup a mixed-team event with 6 men and 6 women on each side. And please ensure that No Relief From Divots in the Fairway remains the law of the land.\n\nTron - I would demand that Webb Simpson be locked up at ADX Florence, the Federal Supermax Penitentiary out in Colorado, for the stunts he’s pulled this year between his sponsor exemptions (and his comments about them), skipping non-signature events, attempting to circumvent the governance/nomination process for the PGA Tour board so he could give his spot to Rory, etc. I’m very troubled by it all and believe he needs some time to reflect upon his actions.\n\nOur man D.J. received some unfair criticism for his grilling technique during the U.S. Open last month, and it made us wonder: If you’re grilling something, either for your family or some friends, what’s one of your favorite things to throw on the grill and what do you do (whether it’s a seasoning or marinade or technique) to make sure it kicks ass?\n\nSoly - I haven’t done this in forever and I’m not sure why, but I love the Gordon Ramsey trick of blending in egg yolk into a ground beef patty for burgers. It gives it a lot more volume and holds the ground beef together on the grill a lot better. Damn, now I’m hungry. OK, I’m doing this on Sunday.\n\nCody - I think it is just the age that the kids are at, but we cook burgers and hot dogs weekly. I have found a great butcher shop in Fort Worth and our blend is dialed. I over-season the patties with the Sand Hills special and let it rock. Boar’s Head dogs for me and Momma, the kids love the cheap stuff. Either way, it is delicious.\n\nKVV - My wife and I have a never-ending tug-of-war over how to cook salmon on the grill. I really like brown sugar and dijon mustard, she really likes a marinade of soy sauce, sesame oil and sherry. Like political candidates trying to win over various parts of the electorate, we are constantly trying to get our children to support which marinade they prefer. I currently believe I’m winning, but it’s always close. We each prefer salmon on the grill, not in the oven, for reasons we can’t entirely explain. As much as I enjoy it when I go somewhere and someone uses cedar planks for their salmon, that’s too much work for me. Put that fish right on the grill, skin side down, and then hit the other side with some grill marks right at the finish.\n\nNeil - I am by no means a grill master, but I’ve been using the grill up on the roof of my building once a week this summer, so I’m getting some reps! I’ve been getting preseasoned burger paddies at Paisano’s Butcher Shop in my neighborhood. I have no shame letting the pros handle the seasoning for me!\n\nCasey - I love to throw veggies on the grill - either in a grill basket to toss around or kebab style on metal skewers. Peppers, onions, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, corn, and zucchini - all great on the grill! Try to cut everything to similar sizes so they finish at the same time, and keep shaking the basket (or turn the kebab skewer) every few minutes to ensure even cooking/char. Thicker slices of stuff you could do directly on the grates (think full ears of corn or thicker onion slices or zucchini plants). Season with some olive oil and pepper - go easy on the salt - you don’t want to draw all the moisture out of the veggie before you grill it. Eat them as is with a sprinkle of flaky salt and more pepper, make a grilled veggie sandwich, toss them in a bowl with a grain like farro or quinoa and top with a dressing to make a healthy side to whatever else you’re grilling.\n\nBen - Living in Kansas City, you have to smoke your meat. My go-to steak is a thick-cut Ribeye. Get that steak near room temp, dry it off as best I can, add some heavy salt then put that bad boy on the smoker. I usually go with Cherry for red meat. Smoke for roughly 45 minutes at 225 F. Once the internal temp hits 115, I’ll take it off the smoker and let rest while I get the grill as hot as possible. Sear both sides for 60-90 seconds. Let rest for 5 minutes. Hit it with salt and pepper. Enjoy.\n\nJordan - I am more of a pan-seared gal, but I helped a friend of mine prepare some ribs recently and it might have changed my entire perception of a food category beloved by my fellow Americans. I’ve avoided ribs for years. You’re telling me I can douse it in mustard, dry rub and it will smell that good?!\n\nD.J. - You guys are bad (or sick) guys.\n\nTron - I usually skip the grill for steaks and do them on a cast iron skillet instead, but I’ve been on a Tri-Tip kick this summer and have been rubbing it in salt, garlic, coffee grounds (shoutout Stone Creek) and ancho chili powder for a spicy, deep flavor. And then I’ll make a creamy macaroni (or shrimp!) salad with dill and cucumbers mixed in to cool it down, and then put a big dollop of tomato jam on the side of the steak to cut the spice a bit. Pair it up with a crisp pilsner or a bottle of chilled gamay, cab franc or another light, dry red and you’ve got an easy, fun summer meal.\n\nWhat’s your favorite Olympic memory?\n\nSoly - Staying up and watching the 2008 Gold Medal basketball game between the U.S. and Spain. I was really into basketball at the time, and The Redeem Team was a big deal to me. International hoops kinda fascinate me, and the concept of getting all of these big-name dudes to figure out how to play together in a different style against teams that treat every game with you like it’s their Super Bowl is just really intriguing (and maybe why I’ve been suckered into rooting for the U.S. Ryder Cup team.) Kobe’s four-point play and the shush. LeBron creating the wide-open look for D Wade to sink the dagger three with two minutes left, and the haunting sound of U.S. crowd going ape shit. Man, that was good stuff. I may go re-watch that now.\n\nCody - Phelps winning everything or any Michael Johnson race. Unfortunately, a lot of the recent Olympics do not stick with me because I was occupied at the time. But Michael Johnson could move.\n\nKVV - In 2008, I was the Michael Phelps reporter for the Baltimore Sun. I didn’t know a lot about swimming when I got that gig, but by the time the Olympics arrived, I knew almost everything and everyone within the sport. Jason Lezak was always this friendly, charming guy who wasn’t a star but was an essential part of U.S.A. swimming culture. It’s easy to gloss over now, but so much of the hype about Phelps’ quest to win eight gold medals would have fizzled on the second night of the Olympics if Lezak hadn’t done some superhero shit in the final leg of the 4x100 meter relay. I still get chills when I think about what it must have been like for him, diving into that pool nearly a full body length behind France’s Alain Bernard, and knowing that he had the weight of history on his shoulders. One bad stroke and not only would the Americans lose, but some of the sizzle would be gone from the games. Phelps’ quest would be over. The Olympics is about athletic excellence, obviously, but some of the best moments happen when it seems like a normal, otherwise-forgetable athlete summons something magical when the pressure is overwhelming. I love watching Lezak churn for home, even though I know the outcome, and I love watching Phelps and Garrett Weber-Gale pound the deck in encouragement as he does. I was 30 years old as I watched it unfold, and it still feels like it could have happened last week. It’s the most amazing athletic feat I’ve ever seen live.\n\nNeil - I’d encourage you to listen to our TrapDraw Olympics preview podcast where Randy, Cody, and I break down our lasting Olympic memories and where we were in life from the 1996 Olympics onward. I have some very vivid memories from the Olympics in 1996 including Kerry Shrugg’s one-footed landing on the vault.\n\nCasey - Women’s Figure Skating at the Calgary Winter Olympics 1988. Katarina Witt vs. Debi Thomas in the Battle of the Carmens - they both skated their long program to the same music from that opera. I was 11 years old at the time and SUPER into skating (taking lessons, at the rink every weekend, etc..). We roll our eyes now at some of the “forced drama” that NBC stuffs down our throats during the games, but as a kid, I bought into the battles. The Witt/Thomas battle ended up being pretty underwhelming - Witt’s lacked a lot of technical prowess (but was artistically great). Thomas made mistakes on a few jumps. Katarina went on to take her 2nd gold in a row (and I took her name as my German class name in high school a few years later).\n\nBen - Anything of Michael Phelps being a GOAT.\n\nJordan - Dare I say this year, 2024? Watching Simone Biles clutch out the team final in gymnastics brought me to tears. Gymnastics is such an emotional and vulnerable sport. There is a precise rhythm and tempo that you’ve worked countless hours to perfect on bars, vault, and beam and you have one shot at getting it right. When you’ve reached the floor, which is usually the final rotation, you are all you have. I can’t imagine the amount of times Simone must have wondered if she’d be afflicted with the twisties again. If her mind and body would be in full sync. And at 27-years-old, with a lot of scar tissue, it’s hard for those thoughts not to hit even harder. It’s how I feel about my own career at times! (But I am not the Simone Biles of anything I do/have done!)\n\nD.J. - My wife Justine was an intern for NBC at the London games, so getting her behind-the-scenes reports from those games were a highlight for me. And, of course, Justin Rose.\n\nTron - As Neil detailed on the recent TrapDraw Olympics extravaganza episode, he and I were very fortunate to have attended a bunch of events in ‘96 back in Atlanta (will hold my tongue and not go off on a Billy Payne-related rant). I was ten years old and Neil had just turned seven, and we’d just moved back from a couple of years living in Toronto a few weeks prior to the Opening Ceremonies, and the entire month of July was a massive party. It was surreal. Neil and my mom were there when Kerri Strug stuck the landing (I still contend hurt NOT injured), we went to a few Dream Team games, beach volleyball, table tennis, powerlifting, Greco-Roman wrestling, mountain biking (which was sick), equestrian, rhythmic dancing, swimming, diving, track and field, etc. Of all those events, there are three things seared in my memory - not necessarily favorites, but very much indelible: 1) Coca-Cola (Atlanta company!) had just come out with those Frozen Lemonades and I must’ve eaten ten of them during a day of attending beach volleyball and I think my taste buds were seared off after that for about a week. 2) Rushing down the driveway to get the Atlanta Journal-Constitution every morning to get the full recap and medal counts and the schedule for that day. And then when Sports Illustrated came midway through the games, that was just awesome. 3) Waking up the morning after the Centennial Park bombing. It was a rainy, dark morning and there was a general sense of panic and confusion on the news. We had tickets for both swimming and diving that day at the aquatic center, which was down by Georgia Tech. I remember my parents debating whether we should go and if it was safe down there, and as a family we basically came to the conclusion that “if we’re scared off from going to events from here on out then whoever did this is getting exactly what they wanted.” Simplistic? Sure. But we went down and had a great day. It was somber and muted, but I distinctly remember everyone holding their head high and determined to keep the party going the rest of the way. I have a complicated, convoluted relationship with Atlanta, but that day I was proud to be from there. Was it a well-run games? Absolutely not. Many of the venues were poorly planned and executed, the over-commercialization and number of vendors was tacky and stifling, and it was probably the tipping point for the Olympics really getting out of control with budgets and graft, but it did transform the city and defined a lot of the next decade-plus in the city and left a pretty big imprint on our lives.\n\nWhat’s the best Halloween costume you’ve ever come up with, either as a kid or as an adult?\n\nSoly - 12 years ago, some friends and I pulled off the Harlem Globetrotters pretty darn well. Headbands, wigs, armbands. That was easily the most attention I’ve ever gotten for a costume out at the Chicago bars. You would think that would have led to some sort of successful female encounter. It did not.\n\nCody - I had staples growing up: either Lane Frost or Troy Aikman. Lane was by far my favorite.\n\nKVV - When my wife and I got together, we realized we were the kind of dorks who liked doing couples costumes. One year we went as Burt Macklin and Janet Snakehole from Parks and Recreation and it was a delight to walk around the neighborhood and see maybe 10 percent of the other parents get it, but see their faces light up when they did catch on.\n\nNeil - I dressed up like Jon Gruden for a Halloween party back in 2015 or 2016. I memorized a bunch of ridiculous play calls that I would repeat them in a Gruden voice all night. A couple classics: “Green right X, shift to viper right, 392 X stick looky” and “Scatter to west right tight, F left, 372 Y stick, X Spot” - I’ll tell ya what, that’s wild man!\n\nCasey - My favorite that I did as an “adult” was Bleu Finnegan from the comic book Blue Monday. I wore it to work (I was a waitress at the time at the Johnny Rockets in Hoboken, NJ) - no one had any idea who I was supposed to be. I didn’t care. I loved the character and I only needed to buy a blue wig to make the outfit - everything else I could cobble out of my closet at the time. Side note - Blue Monday is a comic about a group of brit pop/anglophile high school friends in the early/mid 90s. Bleu is the main character, whose first real crush was on Adam Ant. Basically me, in a comic book.\n\nBen - I’ve ripped off my buddies' costume numerous time and it still gives me a chuckle to this day - a Tourist. Such a simple costume but it really hits. Fake camera around the neck, high socks with sandals, floral shirt, glasses. Such a good look and so simple.\n\nJordan - I (stayed at home and ate pizza) as Chun Li in 2020. Though a fictional character, Chun Li was a childhood hero of mine and I vowed to one day dress up as her. To keep the costs down, I ordered a Chun Li dress from Poshmark, and the dress arrived as good as new. The toughest part was her spiky bracelets, which I tried to DIY and gave up after three hours of hot glue gunning makeshift “steel” cones (I’m the WOAT at DIYs). It wasn’t perfect, but for a few hours, I felt like my hero, the strongest woman in the world – and that was worth every second of frustration.\n\nD.J. - Justine and I did a Richie/Margot Tenenbaum costume a few years ago that was pretty solid. I had a lot riding on that costume, financially and personally.\n\nTron - I’m not sure I’ve EVER had a decent Halloween costume. The one that sticks in my memory was when Randy dressed up as a field goalpost one year during college - he even tied the little pieces of fabric on his wrists to show which way the wind was going and then held his arms up the entire night. Was very dumb and funny.\n\nWe’ve been juggling some summer vacations the last few months, and KVV got some grief on the Live Show for his Glacier Park beanie, which got us thinking: What’s your favorite national park? Any that you haven’t been to that you’re longing to see?\n\nSoly - Yellowstone blew my mind in a way that I was not prepared for. We rushed through it and I sometimes wake up in a cold sweat, full of regret for not booking a night in the park to do it right and not skip by some truly unreal sites. My US national park record is not great, and it’s definitely gonna be a few years before I’m gonna be able to get to many of the ones I’m really dying to see.\n\nCody - Glacier and Yellowstone are the best, but that is my bias. I would see Glacier daily if not weekly growing up. The big gap I think of often is Redwood National. I have not spent much time in Northern California but I always think of it. The trees look massive, beyond belief really. I cannot wait to see them with my own eyes.\n\nKVV - I’ve been going to Glacier my entire life and I still feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface of its potential. If you’ve never been, put it on your list of places you have to see. Yellowstone is really cool, but tough when it gets crowded. The family and I checked out Zion for the first time a few years ago and it surprised me at how stunning it was, and we didn’t even get to do the famous The Narrows hike. Need to get back for that. I think No. 1 on my list would have to be Denali in Alaska. Alaska remains the only state I haven’t visited out of 50, and I hear the scale of it is mind-blowing so it remains No. 1 on my wish list.\n\nNeil - I have to say Mount Rainier National Park due to the awesome memories of scaling that beast back in August of 2022 with 5 of my best friends! Big Sur National Park is a close second. I’ve driven through Big Sur twice, and it may be the most awe-inspiring coastline on the planet (Lofoten, Norway would be the only competition that I’ve seen firsthand). I also need to come clean: I lived in San Francisco for 5 years, and I never made it to Yosemite. Hand up, that’s a miss.\n\nCasey - Growing up with Valley Forge National Park practically in the backyard makes that one my favorite. So many hours were spent riding bikes there, running around the log cabins, going to see Washington’s HQ, jumping around the creeks, watching people fly model airplanes, and the list goes on. There is a lot on my list to see now that I am out west - planning to get to Zion, Bryce Canyon and Arches in Utah sooner than later and really want to get up to Yellowstone.\n\nBen - Grand Teton National Park is mind-boggling. Want to move there immediately. Really looking forward to going to Yellowstone.\n\nJordan - This is kind of embarrassing: I’ve never been to a national park. I’ve been to a few state parks across the country that were memorable, but I guess none qualified as national parks. The first one I’d like to hit is the Dry Tortugas. The lore is fascinating!\n\nD.J. - Yellowstone. That was the centerpiece of our honeymoon (along with Grand Teton and Olympic) and every day was more mind-blowing than the last. Can’t wait to return.\n\nTron - It’s Glacier for me. Many that I haven’t been to and am dying to see - Acadia and Olympic at the top of that wishlist.\n\nYou’re having a nice summer evening alongside your significant other. Maybe you’re outdoors, maybe you’re relaxing in air conditioning (particularly if you live in Las Vegas), but no matter where you are, life is good. You have a drink in your hand, you’re not stressed about work, or the state of your golf game. What’s a song that would immediately make you smile if it played on the stereo?\n\nSoly - “Springsteen” by Eric Church. Or “Losing My Religion” by REM. No real explanation, other than I instantly feel joy when I hear those songs.\n\nCody - “All Your’n” by Tyler Childers or “Hell of a Year” by Parker McCollum. I listen to too much Zach Bryan radio.\n\nKVV - “Feeling Good Again” by Robert Earl Keen. Every time I hear the line “I reached into my pockets, found three twenties and a ten” it makes me smile.\n\nNeil - “Hungersite” by Goose. Good example: I caught the first tram to the top of Jackson Hole Ski Resort back in 2023. I was snowboarding solo, and the tram operator put this song on right when the Tram doors closed. I made eye contact and hit him with a nod of gratitude. I knew it was going have an epic morning on the mountain.\n\nCasey - “Do It Again” by Nada Surf - but really anything from 2005’s The Weight Is Gift album. The guitar tones, the moving bass line, the harmonies, the lyrics - everything makes me think of a lazy summer evening.\n\nThe hum of the clock is a far away place\n\nThe azalea air holding your face\n\nYou're lying down and the moon is sideways\n\nBen - Wide Open Spaces by The Chicks. Might be the greatest song ever written.\n\nJordan - There are many profound and sentimental answers I can give to this question. But I am landing on “MET GALA” by Gunna. What a fun song. Please don’t look up the lyrics.\n\nD.J. - Earnest smile would be “Please Don’t Bury Me” by John Prine. Ironic (possibly larger) smile would be “Tons of Steel” by the Grateful Dead. It’s very high in the running for their worst song ever, and Brent, to me, sounds exactly like this Tim Robinson sketch. The whole combo (and being with my brother while he’s screaming every word at the top of his lungs) really makes me happy.\n\nTron - “Big In Japan” by Alphaville. I’m not sure there’s a song that both transports me and invigorates me more than that one. It’s just fun!\n\nWhat’s one piece of NLU content this year that you weren’t involved in, but you really enjoyed and would like to re-up and recommend to our audience just in case someone missed it? What did you love about it?\n\nSoly - I’m gonna cheat here and use something from 10 months ago… which is technically within the last year and hopefully qualifies. But everything that went into “When Revelation Comes” was just incredible. From the relationship TC formed with Jim Hartsell, to Jim being willing to tell his story, to Robbie, to Golden’s edit, to the friendships people make in golf… it just makes our job feel like it’s actually meaningful work.\n\nCody - Beyond impressed with the amount of work that went into and the results of KVV’s feature on Viktor Hovland. The depth of an individual that he was able to reach perfectly timed with some surprising Viktor news and a great PGA Championship week. Beyond that, watching KVV stock multiple driving ranges for any piece of information was an interesting sight! Outside of that, the Shanks Pod.\n\nKVV - I’m really proud of all the work that went into Jordan’s feature about Amari Avery, and how we got insights from her, her teammates, her coaches, and her dad. I thought I knew Avery somewhat, having watched The Short Game a half dozen times, but learning about the rest of her life was more interesting than a documentary about her when she was 8 years old. On a lighter note, I also love the reels Soly has been creating about his own golf game. They’re so much fun and feel effortless to consume, even though a ton of work goes into making them work.\n\nNeil - The Gary Player narrative podcast KVV put together back in January.\n\nCasey - The Masters live shows this year were so good. People coming in out of the bullpen, BIG CANS, etc. I couldn’t wait to watch them after each round. Really the live shows in general are my “can’t miss” content. Honorable mention (and technically this was the end of last year) but I loved the Lee Trevino pod. As someone who really didn’t follow golf (outside of playing it) before the mid-2010s, it was fun to hear stories from “back in the day” and about how he got started in the game. Trevino sounded like your grandpop just going on and on with his stories and I could have listened for another 2 hours easily.\n\nBen - Cody playing alt shot with Cam Young. Those two were in their process, chatting it up, playing great golf. Was such a fun edit. Gotta imagine Cody still reflects on that day for a long time to come.\n\nJordan - Soly and KVV always knock it out of the park with their deep dives. I appreciate how thorough they both are in capturing the most interesting parts of a major, even if those parts don’t always have to do with golf. Preserving history, esp. sports history is something I’m pretty passionate about, and I love what they uncover.\n\nD.J. - KVV’s feature on Viktor Hovland (and it’s timing right before the PGA Championship) helped make the majors more interesting for me this year. Vik remains one of the most fascinating people in the game and I love hearing every story about how his mind works that I can get my hands on."
