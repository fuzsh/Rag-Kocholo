They’ve always been there for each other, supported one another through the highs and lows, and truly have been each other’s best friends and cheerleaders. So, as our family begins to think about another new school year, there’s a twinge of sadness, but also great expectation — Our oldest daughter graduated from our homeschool in May and is heading off to college in the fall! We are so excited for her as she begins this new journey in her life, but we will all greatly miss her joyful spirit, hugs, insights, and, simply, being with her each day. I’m thankful for the ability to text, FaceTime, etc. as I know all of the kids will want to continue to keep in close contact with their big sister – one of their very best friends.\n\nAs our oldest prepares for moving to a dorm and beginning life and academics at college, our own planning for a new school year at home continues as well.
