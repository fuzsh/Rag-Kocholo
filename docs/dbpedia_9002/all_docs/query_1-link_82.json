        "text": "Joy\n\nJoy, the fruit of the Spirit, is a large part of our walk with Christ. Because of that, we need to look critically at our understanding of joy and the definition of joy in the Bible. Fruits of the Spirit are often misunderstood, and joy might be the most misunderstood of the bunch.\n\nBible verses about joy\n\nWhat does the Bible say about joy? First, we need to step back and look at how we understand God’s joy.\n\nWhen we think of God, we view Him as many different things—a somber judge, a righteous king, a loving father—but we seldom think of Him as joyful. Yet He is! We know God found joy in His Creation when He declared it good, and we’re told of unspeakable joy in Heaven whenever a sinner comes to know Him.\n\nEven in moments where God exercises judgment, His joy always prevails since it’s intrinsically part of His nature. Psalm 30:5 [NLT] says, “For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a lifetime; Weeping may last for the night, but a shout of joy comes in the morning.”\n\nBut more than just exhibiting joy, the mere presence of God produces joy because God Himself is our joy. Romans 15:13 [ESV] reveals the secret to receiving this joy: “May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.” God is the supplier of joy, and through the power of the Holy Spirit, we have access.\n\nDefinition of joy vs happiness\n\nWhen we think of joy, it conjures up images of celebration, jubilee, and excitement. We see joy as a synonym for happiness—an emotion brought about by circumstances—but there’s often a disconnect when we think about the definition of joy in the Bible.\n\nGod’s joy comes through finding pleasure and contentment through Jesus rather than our circumstances. As Jesus reminds us in John 16:22 [ESV], “So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.” God is our joy, which means our joy doesn’t depend on the world. Our joy can’t be taken from us!\n\nLook at the apostles who suffered great persecution, even jailed for extended periods of time, yet they found joy regardless of their circumstances. 1 Peter 1:3-6 speaks of a living hope and inheritance waiting for us in heaven through the resurrection of Christ, and reminds us, “In this you rejoice, though … you have been grieved by various trials.”\n\nWe find our joy and rest from God, even if our circumstances aren’t great. Happiness is fleeting, but God’s joy is eternal. It’s a mindset, it’s a lifestyle, and it’s a choice—a choice independent of emotions and life circumstances.\n\nJoyful\n\nIn which circumstances do we need to have joy? All of them, and it’s harder than you think! However, it’s imperative to source our joy from God because life doesn’t always provide it. Regardless of what we might be facing, commands us to “Rejoice always.”\n\nBible verses about enjoying life\n\nThis might sound obvious, but it’s easy to get so wrapped up in the blessing we forget to acknowledge God. As James 1:17 says, all blessings and gifts come from above—from God. When good things come our way, when we’re encouraged, when we’re loved, and when we’re given affection, we’re meant to worship and rejoice.\n\nFinding joy\n\nAs difficult as it can be, we’re called to rejoice even through painful circumstances. Throughout Scripture, there are many examples of choosing joy through affliction. Christians persecuted for their faith are commended for their joy amidst adversity across the New Testament. Paul, stuck in jail, wrote 2 Corinthians 7:4 [ESV]: “In all our affliction, I am overflowing with joy.”\n\nEven when we’re dealing with temptation and struggling with sin, we’re still called to rejoice. James 1:2-3 tell us to “count it all joy” when we hit hard times because we know God is refining us through our struggles.\n\nThe best example of rejoicing in the midst of bad circumstances is Jesus, who took on the pain and suffering of the cross for us. Hebrews 12:2 [ESV] says, “Looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.” He knew there was joy even in the tremendous pain He endured.\n\nRejoice in the Lord always\n\nIt’s probably the most difficult to rejoice in God when we’re in need. Whether those needs are physical, emotional, or spiritual, it’s hard to feel God’s blessing when we’re lacking in one or more areas. Yet, we’re still called to rejoice.\n\nThough Israel was going through a famine, Habakkuk declared, “yet I will rejoice in the Lord; I will take joy in the God of my salvation” [Habakkuk 3:17-18 ESV]. Even if our basic needs aren’t met or we don’t know where our next meal is coming from, we’re still called to rejoice in the Lord.\n\nThough Israel was going through a famine, Habakkuk declared, “yet I will rejoice in the Lord; I will take joy in the God of my salvation” [Habakkuk 3:17-18 ESV]. Even if our basic needs aren’t met or we don’t know where our next meal is coming from, we’re still called to rejoice in the Lord.\n\nRejoicing in God during times of need produces peace. Philippians 4:4 and 9 [ESV] says, “Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice…and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your heart and your mind in Christ Jesus.” If we’re in a spirit of rejoicing and giving thanks, our hearts will be at peace. God is our provider, and if we have confidence in that, we have no reason to fear.\n\nWe may not have the answers to our various circumstances, but we can rejoice and have faith in the Lord. Rest in the Lord, let His joy fill you, and be at peace. Joy isn’t always easy, but it’s always worth the effort.\n\nDownload your free FruitFULL Kids lesson plans!\n\nLittle ones need fruit too!\n\nLearn about the Fruits of the Spirit together with our free FruitFULL Kids Lesson Plans, perfect for your family devotional time."
