        "text": "I grew up Catholic- we prayed before meals and before bed but there wasn’t much more to it. We had a rich Catholic community around us though, and in eighth grade I was invited to go Eucharistic Adoration. I encountered the person of Christ through the Eucharist. I was captivated by his profound love for me and had the desire to be with him. But, at that point the desires of the world had already began to creep into my heart. I wrestled a lot with both God and the world, struggling to figure out which camp I belonged in up until I began college.\n\nI went to Aquinas College with the deep desire for intimacy with the Lord on my heart. I majored in theology and philosophy and encountered the Lord there. But my deep conversion to the Lord came through FOCUS’ Digital Campus and the Catholic community on my campus. He taught me me that no matter what I had given into in the past, I am still and always will be his daughter. He was calling me to live not a life modeled off of the world, but a life modeled after the humble heart of Christ. It was a call that I was scared to give myself 100% to but little by little, the Lord softened my heart to say yes."
