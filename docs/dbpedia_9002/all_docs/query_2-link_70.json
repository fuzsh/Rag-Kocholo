        "text": "The Joy Formidable have released the third in their current trilogy of singles project.\n\nFollowing on from ‘Cut My Face’ and ‘The Hat’ – their first new releases in over two years – ‘Share My Heat’ is over 15 minutes long, and arrives to coincide with their UK tour.\n\nVocalist Ritzy Bryan explains: “It’s a song about true connection and love. Deep, selfless love between humans is a beautiful part of our existence, but I’m also singing about our inherent love of nature, the living world and our kinship to everything: plants, animals, mountains and water. Can we repair our relationship with the earth and bring more reciprocity, compassion and companionship to a world that already gives us so much.”\n\nCheck the single out below, and catch them live at the following:\n\nSEPTEMBER\n\n26 CARDIFF The Globe\n\n27 NORWICH Epic Studios\n\n28 LONDON Clapham Grand\n\n30 PORTSMOUTH Wedgewood Rooms"
