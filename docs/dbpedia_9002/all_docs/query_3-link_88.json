        "text": "Psalms 4:7\n\nThou hast put gladness in my heart\n\nThe Ethiopic version reads it \"into our heart\"; in granting the above request; for, nothing so rejoices the hearts of God's people as the light of his countenance, or the enjoyment of his gracious presence: this was matter of exceeding joy to Christ himself, ( Psalms 21:6 ) ( Acts 2:28 ) ; and so it is to all his members; this causes inward gladness, gladness of heart, and is opposed to the external rejoicings of wicked men and of hypocrites: and this is of God's putting into the heart; and indeed none can put gladness either into a wounded conscience, into the heart of a sensible sinner, or into the soul of one that is panting after the presence of God, and communion with him, but God himself;\n\nmore than in the time [that] their corn and their wine increased:\n\nmeaning the time of harvest and of vintage; when there is a good harvest, and a good vintage, there is joy among men, and the contrary when it is otherwise, ( Isaiah 9:3 ) ( Joel 1:12 ) ; these things being of general use, spread an universal joy among people; there is scarce any earthly thing that occasions more joy than these do: and yet the joy on such occasions is not to be compared with spiritual joy, that is a joy unspeakable and full of glory. Some take the (m) to be not comparative, but causal, and render the words F19, \"thou hast put gladness in ray heart from the time that their corn\" as do the Chaldee paraphrase and Syriac versions; and the Arabic version renders it, \"because of the multitude of fruits\" and then the sense is, as if David should say concerning his enemies,\n\n``I never envied their prosperity, I always rejoiced when they had a good harvest, or vintage, and still do; and yet they have rose up and rebelled against me, and requited me evil for good.''\n\nAnd this sense is given into by the Jewish commentators F20, and shows of what an admirable spirit, and in what a sweet disposition of mind, the psalmist was; that while his enemies were seeking his life he was rejoicing in their prosperity; and is a sad aggravation of their wickedness: and this may also be understood of the rejoicing of David, and even of the Messiah, and likewise of all good men, at the spiritual prosperity of the saints, at any increase of grace, spiritual knowledge, and joy, signified by these outward things, as in ( Jeremiah 31:12 ) ; the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, add \"oil\" to corn and wine."
