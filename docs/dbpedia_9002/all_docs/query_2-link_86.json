        "text": "Psalm 28:7 My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise Him. How did the lame man feel after he was healed by Peter and John, in the name of Jesus? The Bible says, “He went walking and leaping and praising God.” Remember what David did when he brought the Ark of the Covenant back to Jerusalem? He danced before the Lord with all his might. I bet he got up and leaped for joy. How often do we get excited thinking about the great Salvation the Lord has wrought for us? Does your heart leap for joy each time you think of the Saviour? Have we grown to be too proper that we fail to get excited about God? We show our excitement when a goal is scored. Why not about Jesus?"
