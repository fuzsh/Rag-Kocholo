Personal Philosophy: An opportunity usually comes around only once in a lifetime. Grab it while you can. Why?—Because things change; always do.

History: Hes back! Its about time, some might say, especially those familiar with Daves lightning-swift, blistering riffs from his days as the lead guitarist with Manowar. For those unfamiliar with Daves playing, be warned—it is not for the weak of heart.

So what has he been doing since leaving Manowar nearly 5 years ago? Quite a lot, actually, but a good tale should start at the beginning...

In the early 1980s, as with any young hopeful with a rock n roll dream, Dave made the rounds of the Chicago-area club circuit, adding his spark to a dozen or more bands. It quickly became apparent, however, that there was something unique about this kid from the boonies—not only could he play his instrument, but he did so with precision, an eye for detail, an ear for melody, and perhaps the nibblest fingers in the Midwest. As if overnight, Dave became known as the killer guitarist, as evidenced when he won the coveted top-spot in the Hot Licks Guitar contest 2 years in a row (1985/1986). He might have acually done a three-peat, so to speak, had not fate intervened in the form of one Joey De Maio, bass guitarist with Manowar.

Ross the Boss had decided to leave the band, said Dave, and Joey was scouting for his replacement. Little did I realize he had his eye on me. In those days, De Maio spent a lot of time recording in Chicago studios, and being privy to the word on the street, had learned of Daves stellar reputation. He came to a local club to see me play, continued Dave, and before I knew what happened, I was offered the job.

What followed is heavily documented in the countless Manowar histories (both in print and on the web) so I will not repeat it here, but briefly, from 1988 through 1995, Dave found himself touring the world, filming videos, and making a reputation for himself as Death Dealer, the lead guitarist of, what many claim, is the ultimate heavy-metal band. He even made the Guinness Book of World Records for being the loudest guitarist (at 129.5db) in 1992. (Note: For those unfamiliar with Daves recorded work, I strongly urge you to grab a copy of any and all of the albums on which he appeared. For the complete listing, click here.)

Wait a second . . . albums, tours, World Records?—all this from a kid raised in the far-west Chicago suburbs? Very impressive indeed. The whole experience was a dream come true, said Dave with a mighty grin. To put it simply, I was blessed. Well said.

Then why, in 1995, did he make the decision to leave Manowar? I just needed something more, answered Dave. And though leaving was probably the hardest thing I ever did, you must understand, my dream was not only to be a part of something as great as Manowar, but also to finish my schooling. As a guitarist dedicated to my craft, I needed to branch out, to develop my skills and attempt different styles. And that he did with a vengeance, at Chicagos prestigious Roosevelt Music University. For the next several years, Dave studied both Jazz and Classical guitar, as well as music theory, finally earning his degree. And not only did he achieve that goal, but another as well—Dave is probably the hottest guitar teacher in the entire Chicago area. I now have over 100 guitar students, Dave proudly proclaimed. I love it. I learned so much from some great teachers, and I suppose I just want to share that knowledge with my students.

And if this wasnt enough, Dave also took on the chore of building his own recording studio. Ive always been fascinated with studio engineering . . . the techniques, the equipment, the tricks of the trade. It was just something else I felt I needed to do in order to further my music. And is this how the band came about? Pretty much, answered Dave. Several years ago, I began writing tunes with Trace Edward Zaber (DSGs lead vocalist). Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, we couldnt seem to form a proper band, so called it a day. But in the meantime, I slowly built Icon Studio, and eventually, started laying down tracks. When I was ready, I contacted Trace and suprised him by having nearly all of the songs we had written fully recorded and just waiting for his vocal tracks.

Ok, now the big question—what can we expect to hear from the Dave Shankle Group? A variety of musical styles, really, replied Dave, a dog-with-a-bone smile creeping across his face. I suppose I just wanted to experiment a bit, to play a little of all the styles I love. Theres everything from rousing instrumentals to heart-wrenching ballads to out-and-out, kick-ass, rock and roll barnstormers. Theres also some funk, jazz, and classical influences in a few of the pieces, a touch of instrumental fusion guitar in another, and, of course, there are several mammoth epics in the progressive, heavy-metal style. So far, we have about 20 killer tracks recorded . . . now the hard part will be deciding which songs to actually include on the debut album. Hell, he added, his excitement becoming utterly contagious, I cant wait for you to hear it!

Neither can we, Dave. Neither can we.
