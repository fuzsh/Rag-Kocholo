        "text": "Board Members and Legislators Hold First Higher Education Funding Subcommittee Meeting\n\nOn Tuesday, members of the IHL Board, together with members of the Mississippi legislature, held the first meeting of the select subcommittee formed to create a five- to ten-year plan to adequately fund and maintain Mississippi's public university System. The subcommittee was created by Speaker William J. McCoy, Chairman of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, with approval of Lt. Governor Phil Bryant. The IHL Board members who attended the meeting on Tuesday included Board President Amy Whitten; Chair of the Board's Budget, Finance, and Audit Committee Aubrey Patterson; Chair of the Real Estate and Facilities Committee Scott Ross; and Trustee Ed Blakeslee. During Tuesday's meeting, the Board members discussed with the legislators the concept behind the Board's proposed funding framework. The proposed framework would bring Mississippi's public universities to the Southern Regional Education Board average over a five-year period through a combination of legislative support of approximately $36 million per year for classroom instruction, minimal tuition increases of five percent or less on average for the System, and a concentrated, continued institutional effort to save money through enhanced efficiencies. The framework would allow a partnership to be forged with the Legislature with a collective goal of improving Mississippi through public higher education. The stable funding would also allow institutions to plan into the future, and students and parents to have an understanding of possible tuition increases. The next meeting of the subcommittee is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, October 14. For more information, contact Assistant Commissioner of Governmental Relations Dr. Jim Borsig.\n\nMVSU Board Search Committee to Receive Reference Information\n\nNext Wednesday, October 8, beginning at 10:00 a.m., the Board Search Committee for the next President of Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU), chaired by Trustee Bettye Neely, will meet in the IHL Board Room in the Universities Center, 3825 Ridgewood Road, Jackson, MS, 39211 to hear the results of candidate background and reference checks. Board Search Committee members will be joined by MVSU's Interview Search Advisory Committee, a subset of the original campus Search Advisory Committee formed to review all resumes and recommend candidates to the Board Search Committee. A listing of the members of the Interview Search Advisory Committee can be found here. An executive session may be held in accordance with the Open Meetings Act. IHL's institutional executive officer search process allows Mississippi to be on the consideration list of the highest caliber professionals in higher education. The process is open, transparent and representative-based, and works in accordance with today's recruitment standards for high-level institutions of higher learning.

JSU graduate student Preston Johnson won the distinction on Aug. 7, when he signed up to become an alumnus member of the facility after his student membership expired. The 27-year-old from Lexington, MS, graduated in May 2008. In honor of the center's benchmark, Johnson received gifts including Walter Payton Center t-shirts, shorts, bathing products, workout towels and a tote bag. \"It was definitely a shock\", he said. Since its original grand opening on February 15, 2006, the Walter Payton Center has undergone many internal changes. Among those changes are new specially trained staffers and a wider range of physical fitness programs. But one program that has remained constant is P.H.A.T or Proud Healthy and Trim. A program designed to assist in weight loss through physical and nutrition training. The center currently offers 17 classes in four basic areas, Cardio, Strength/Toning, Yoga/Pilates, and Step Aerobics. \"I find the programs here to be feasible and reasonable,\" Johnson said. \"Price is very nice compared to other facilities. The atmosphere here is nice and it fits my workout needs. Johnson, who works at the Mississippi State Hospital, likes to work out three to four times a week to stay healthy, toned and fit. \"The availability and flexibility here at the Walter Payton Center allows me to do so\".

Community leaders in Ruleville have been working with the university center's professional staff to help create a downtown improvement plan. The goal: to help foster a more attractive public area for the approximately 3,200 residents, as well as visitors to the Sunflower County community situated at the intersections of state Highway 8 and U.S. 49 West. As home and burial place of pioneer Mississippi voting rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer (1917-77), Ruleville--established in 1899 and located about 10 miles east of Cleveland--rightfully can lay claim to being a \"birthplace\" of the Southern civil rights movement. After completing the summer-long project, Cari Varner, the CSTC's assistant director, recently made recommendations during a presentation to members of the Ruleville Economic Council and other area leaders. The project was funded by a private donor. The plan, which later was accepted by the Ruleville Board of Aldermen, includes such recommendations as: --Improvements to a downtown square park and upgrading of the existing gazebo, --Improvement of downtown sidewalks, building facades and town entrances, and --Enforcement of existing zoning and code regulations. \"We picked the areas we thought would make the biggest impact,\" Varner said.

Amanda Walker is the Extension director in Lawrence County. She spearheaded the efforts on behalf of Organic Growing Systems, a relatively new and growing company that produces organic fertilizer from poultry litter. \"Their mill manager was from Ohio and did not have much knowledge about the community,\" Walker said. \"The company was doing well financially, but they didn't have a big budget for research and development. They turned to the Extension Service for help primarily with the development of data that would help them market their product to forage producers.\" Walker put together an Extension team of soil, forage, horticulture, truck crops, turf and poultry specialists. The group met with company representatives to determine how the Extension Service could meet some of their needs. Trial plots were planted to see how the fertilizer performed with different crops and in different conditions. \"The company is successfully figuring out what markets it can enter with its product. We connected them to the local chamber of commerce and community resource development officer,\" Walker said. \"We also put management in contact with needed services in the area and helped as the company filled positions at the plant.\" Learn more.\n\nMSU's Wood Magic Science Fair Preps for 4,000 Elementary School Students\n\nMSU Ambulatory Clinic: Large Animal Service Helps Owners, Students\n\nMSU's 4-H Shooting Sports Develops Volunteer Leaders\n\nMISSISSIPPI UNIVERSITY FOR WOMEN NEWS\n\nMUW Student Interns at Restaurant in Ireland\n\nMississippi University for Women senior culinary arts major Laura Farrell from Paducah, Ky., traveled to Ireland this summer after receiving the Women's Chef and Restaurateur Externship Scholarship. Farrell traveled to The Emerald Isle in June and July to work with Chef Paul Flynn.

Instead, the Mississippi Valley State University communication student found himself working side by side with Colts staff at the Phil Brown Field at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind., the summer home for the National Football League team. Smith, a native of Chicago, Ill., received the opportunity of a lifetime when he was selected for a three-week internship with the Colts. But don't think Smith was intimidated by the massive football players whose names often appear in sports headlines or by the media that wrote those headlines. When Smith notices a reporter abruptly moving a cone to get a close up shot of one of the players, he eagerly addresses the situation by rushing over to place the cone into its correct spot. Smith recalls Colts' Vice President of Public Relations Craig Kelley laughing and giving him a pat on the back, all the while saying \"Good eye.\" \"The NFL needs people like him during our training camps to make sure things run as smoothly as possible,\" said Justin Dickens, manager of publicity for the Colts. \"(This is) a high-profile internship and Kevin fit right in. He did a great job. He represented Mississippi Valley and himself very well. He is a person of high character,\" said Dickens.

That beauty has been officially lauded. The Mississippi Urban Forest Council has honored Ole Miss with its annual Scenic Communities of Mississippi award, which recognizes the university's commitment to a range of activities to protect the environment, as well as planting and maintaining trees on its 1,000-acre campus. Donna Yowell, executive director of the Mississippi Urban Forest Council, presented the award Wednesday morning to UM Landscape Services Director Jeff McManus and Chancellor Robert Khayat in a ceremony on the Quad near Paris-Yates Chapel. The ceremony was followed by a reception for dozens of landscape services employees. \"I think it is a great honor for the Ole Miss family and landscaping team,\" McManus said. \"It is great recognition for the campus, and it shows our commitment to the continued enhancement of our facilities and grounds.\" The Oxford campus is home to some of the state's largest and oldest trees, including a Northern catalpa with a circumference of nearly 21 feet, and Mississippi's largest Osage orange tree. \"This past year alone, another 754 trees were planted, pushing the university's inventory to well over 6,000 trees,\" McManus said. Other factors that were considered include efforts to combat litter on campus, protect water quality and control storm runoff, Yowell said.

But it's the way that his prosthetic hand functions that truly amazes him. With a contraction of muscles in his forearm, he can open and close his hand, extending each finger to form a variety of grasping patterns, from reaching for car keys to curling around a coffee cup. The movement is even more striking when a cosmetic glove, the same skin tone and appearance of his real hand, is used. Even the name of the device sounds like science fiction: i-LIMB, a prosthetic hand with individually powered digits. That's what makes this prosthetic system different from the limited pinching motion of other prostheses. For Hollingshead, the cutting-edge technology has allowed him to work, go to school and enjoy hobbies, all of which require two-handed, multitasking skills. \"It's a complete 180 from what my life could have been without this new technology,\" said Hollingshead of Millry, Ala. The University of Mississippi Medical Center's Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Rehabilitation is the first i-LIMB Hand-accredited facility in the state, and the surgeons and prosthetists here worked as a team to return Hollingshead to his normal routine.

After holding a tennis ball coated in a special glow-in-the-dark powder, the elementary school students were sent to wash their hands. When the students returned, McGhee and other nursing students used black lights to show areas on the students' hands and wrists where they may have missed washing off some of the powder.
