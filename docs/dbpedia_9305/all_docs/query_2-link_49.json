Ashes To Ashes\n\nThere she walks, touching your soul like holy fire\n\nHeaven knows, heartache to your ears, madness disappears\n\nShe's kissing the flame of desire\n\nYesterday's pain, illusions are on fire\n\nLightning strikes when she walks by\n\nAshes to ashes\n\nLust to lust, dust to dust\n\nTears she cries, touching your heart like holy water\n\nWhen she sighs, magic to your ears, madness disappears\n\nShe's fanning the flame of her desire\n\nYesterday's pain, illusions are on fire\n\nLightning strikes when she walks by\n\nAshes to ashes\n\nLust to lust, dust to dust\n\nThe way she cries, grabbing your soul with blind ambition\n\nNothing remains but her illusion\n\nLightning strikes when she walks by\n\nAshes to ashes\n\nLust to lust, dust to dust\n\nLightning strikes when she walks by\n\nAshes to ashes\n\nLust to lust, dust to dust\n\n2. A Raven At Midnight\n\nAn ebony heart, housed in a demon well-versed in his arts\n\nSins a la carte, wielding terror no sane man conceives\n\nA righteous facade, defies social order for the sake of his god\n\nHell's fusillade, his dementia has sired the grief\n\nCrusaders of peace\n\nLocate his lair and tighten the squeeze\n\nBring him down to his knees\n\nHell-spawned parasite\n\nFlees the international searchlights\n\nLike a raven at midnight\n\nA plague for mankind, a social disease in a fanatical mind\n\nEqually blind, the minions who firmly believe\n\nWickedly sly, recruiting the lemmings who gratefully die\n\nAn eye for an eye, for a grievance no sane man conceives\n\nChampions of good\n\nDrive a stake through his black heart and his servanthood\n\nHe's so misunderstood-ha!\n\nHell-spawned parasite\n\nFlees the international searchlights\n\nLike a raven at midnight\n\nWoe is the curse upon us all\n\nHe's frightfully due his curtain call\n\nHow many will die before he falls?\n\nBeware the raven:\n\nA righteous facade, defies social order for the sake of his god\n\nHell's fusillade, his dementia has sired the grief\n\nCrusaders of peace\n\nLocate his lair and tighten the squeeze\n\nBring him down to his knees\n\nHell-spawned parasite\n\nFlees the international searchlights\n\nLike a raven at midnight\n\nHell-spawned parasite\n\nFlees the international searchlights\n\nLike a raven at midnight\n\n3. The Widow's Grief\n\nA woman sits and cries for her loss\n\nCounting the tears, estimating the cost\n\nShe's blaming herself for letting him go\n\nInstead of defending the rights of her home\n\nNow her grief cuts deep like a knife,\n\nA knife made of guilt, and the loss of a life\n\nA woman sits and dies more each day\n\nLittle by little life slipping away\n\nWishing it soon will be her time to die\n\nLying in peace with him by her side\n\nNot a thanks for the price they have paid\n\nA family lost with so little to say\n\nThe widow's grief\n\n4. The Widow's Peak\n\nYou involve us in actions that are not our concern\n\nRepeating the history - you just never learn\n\nNo thought to the families, no thought to their fate\n\nPlaying the war games against those you hate\n\nHow dare you place the blame at the widow's peak?\n\nFaceless apologies for the words that you speak\n\nFalse atonement with the tears that you weep\n\nAt the height of the widow's peak\n\nDesigning the costumes in war widow black\n\nAnd practicing feelings, those you lack\n\nWith delusions of grandeur-illusions of fame\n\nYour pointing the fingers and leave out your name\n\nIt's not your son who's sent to die\n\nProving a point with omissions and lies\n\nHow dare you place the blame at the widow's peak?\n\nFaceless apologies for the words that you speak\n\nFalse atonement with the tears that you weep\n\nAt the height of the widow's peak\n\nYou justify actions with plans to attack\n\nConcealing intentions and twisting the facts\n\nMagnanimous promises take the extreme\n\nPraise be to you, praise be your needs\n\nHow dare you place the blame at the widow's peak?\n\nFaceless apologies for the words that you speak\n\nFalse atonement with the tears that you weep\n\nAt the height of the widow's peak\n\nAt the widow's peak\n\n5. Calling All Heroes\n\nIn the days of old\n\nStars disappear, nights are growing cold\n\nOh, heroes of our schemes\n\nReaching out to someone, someone of their dreams\n\nWhen the lighting strikes\n\nWhen the children sigh\n\nWhen the magic dies\n\nCalling all heroes\n\nWhen the voice decays\n\nWhen the death remains\n\nWhen the music fades\n\nCalling all heroes\n\nIn these days of old\n\nHeroes appear, fantasy unfolds\n\nStories untold\n\nVoices of the heart, magic of the soul\n\nOh, heroes of our schemes\n\nReaching out to someone, someone of their dreams\n\nWhen the lighting strikes\n\nWhen the children sigh\n\nWhen the magic dies\n\nCalling all heroes\n\nWhen the voice decays\n\nWhen the death remains\n\nWhen the music fades\n\nCalling all heroes\n\nIt's calling out to me\n\nFantasy or reality, love can never be\n\nOh, solidarity\n\nDeny the cheap insanity, you're reaching out to me\n\nWhen the lighting strikes\n\nWhen the children sigh\n\nWhen the magic dies\n\nCalling all heroes\n\nWhen the voice decays\n\nWhen the death remains\n\nWhen the music fades\n\nCalling all heroes\n\n6. Curse Of The Pharaoh\n\nIn these days of confusion, in these nights of strife\n\nThe past comes back to haunt you\n\nIn this kingdom of madness, you fight for your life\n\nTempestuous storms of deja vu\n\nSilver and gold, souls bought and sold\n\nCurse of the Pharaoh\n\nSky full of dreams, a fortune in schemes\n\nCurse of the Pharaoh\n\nBeware of the prophets with self-serving rules\n\nThey are not your saviors\n\nThe modern-day hero becomes yesterday's fool\n\nAnd this you must remember\n\nBlood in the sand, toil through the land\n\nCurse of the Pharaoh\n\nChains rattle on, a new Babylon\n\nCurse of the Pharaoh\n\nYou suffer the sinner, forsake the lost\n\nMay the strong survive\n\nYou cast out the demons whatever the cost\n\nKeep the dream alive\n\nSilver and gold, souls bought and sold\n\nCurse of the Pharaoh\n\nSky full of dreams, a fortune in schemes\n\nCurse of the Pharaoh\n\nBlood in the sand, toil through the land\n\nCurse of the Pharaoh\n\nChains rattle on, a new Babylon\n\nCurse of the Pharaoh\n\nThe chains rattle on\n\nIn this new Babylon\n\n7. The Tolling Of The Bell\n\nThe path to unknown glory, the road to unknown fate\n\nThe never-ending story, a prophet or a snake\n\nBeing doomed from the start, transgression a la carte\n\nTheories state the sadness to the human mystery\n\nTemptation to the madness that plagues society\n\nStrapping crosses to our back, we brace for the attack\n\nThe tolling of the bell, prophets do foretell\n\nA soul to buy and sell, no sentence with reprieve\n\nThe tolling of the bell\n\nSanity of honor, insecurity of shame\n\nRounding of the corner to a street that bears your name\n\nA destiny in doubt, a spinning roundabout\n\nThe sanctity of knowledge, a thunderstorm of tears\n\nA future now acknowledged, the facing of your fears\n\nAt the end you'll pay the cost for the game you've played and lost\n\nThe tolling of the bell, prophets do foretell\n\nA soul to buy and sell, no sentence with reprieve\n\nThe tolling of the bell, the spirit leaves the shell\n\nMagic of the spell created to deceive\n\nThe tolling of the bell\n\nCleansing of obsession, a soul hung out to dry\n\nBleaching of confessions, excuses, alibis\n\nFalse redemption of the heart, false reality is art\n\nHolidays in Babylon will finally end one day\n\nYou'll testify to goings on, a lifelong resume\n\nThe mirror's coming clear, revealing yesteryear\n\nThe tolling of the bell, prophets do foretell\n\nA soul to buy and sell, no sentence with reprieve\n\nThe tolling of the bell, the spirit leaves the shell\n\nMagic of the spell created to deceive\n\nThe tolling of the bell, prophets do foretell\n\nA soul to buy and sell, no sentence with reprieve\n\nThe tolling of the bell, the spirit leaves the shell\n\nMagic of the spell created to deceive\n\nThe tolling of the bell\n\nThe tolling of the bell\n\n8. Secrets\n\nI've seen your face before somewhere in my dreams\n\nYears and tears cannot erase\n\nI know the time is right, fate has intervened\n\nLonely souls can now embrace\n\nSomehow I sense you still remember\n\nSomehow I feel that you still care\n\nSteeped in the mystery\n\nSecrets of you\n\nI've played your heart before, hidden by the past\n\nMemories returning strong\n\nMagic of deja vu justified at last\n\nDestiny can't hold out for long\n\nSomehow I sense you feel the yearning\n\nSomehow I feel that you still care\n\nSteeped in the mystery\n\nSecrets of you\n\nUncharted history\n\nSecrets of you\n\nI know the time is right, fate has intervened\n\nLonely souls can now embrace\n\nSomehow I sense you still remember\n\nSomehow I feel that you still care\n\nSteeped in the mystery\n\nSecrets of you\n\nUncharted history\n\nSecrets of you\n\n9. Madness\n\nSilently still, the wrath of ubiquitous gods\n\nSanity wills, the manmade destruction to come\n\nIs it the full moon that summons the madness to grow\n\nStealing the heart from mankind?\n\nAre the heroes and saints, the souls who create\n\nFated to run out of time?\n\nWith destiny calling it's moonshine\n\nWith empires tumbling it's...\n\nMoonshine and madness\n\nHeadlines leading to sadness\n\nMadness gone wild, destruction now rains from the sky\n\nPity the child, tears flooding millions of eyes\n\nWill this new wave of madness be nurtured or slain?\n\nWhat will we favor to preach?\n\nWill the lessons of old grow toxic with mold\n\nPoisoning all within reach?\n\nWith empires tumbling it's headlines\n\nWith destiny calling it's moonshine\n\nWhen towers go crumbling it's...\n\nMoonshine and madness\n\nHeadlines leading to sadness\n\nWill this new wave of terror find converts or foes?\n\nWhat will we favor to preach?\n\nWill the lessons of old grow toxic with mold\n\nPoisoning all within reach?\n\nWith destiny calling it's moonshine\n\nWith empires tumbling it's headlines\n\nWith destiny calling it's moonshine\n\nWhen towers go crumbling it's...\n\nMoonshine and madness\n\nHeadlines leading to sadness\n\nMoonshine and madness\n\nHeadlines leading to sadness\n\n10. Back To Heaven\n\nExperience of lifetime, lessons of our past\n\nThe mist of total knowledge lifted now at last\n\nA universal college, we learn from our mistakes\n\nAchieving understanding, achieving grace\n\nThe legions of fate warn when it's time to move on\n\nThe march of the saints teach us one by one\n\nA new inventory, a fresh shot at glory\n\nThen it's back to heaven\n\nA new range of feeling, a ripe time for bleeding\n\nThen it's back to heaven\n\nEach try gives us courage, each try gives us strength\n\nEach try tests the borders of our growing faith\n\nLives of observation, choices are retraced\n\nAchieving the wisdom, achieving grace\n\nThe beacons at night signal the right time to go\n\nThe guardians of light rearrange your soul\n\nA new chance for freedom, a dream to believe in\n\nThen it's back to heaven\n\nA new time for learning, a fresh heart for burning\n\nThen it's back to heaven\n\nThe legions of fate warn when it's time to move on\n\nThe march of the saints teach us one by one\n\nA new inventory, a fresh shot at glory\n\nThen it's back to heaven\n\nA new range of feeling, a ripe time for bleeding\n\nThen it's back to heaven\n\nA new time for learning then it's heaven\n\nIt's back to heaven\n\n11. Masquerade\n\nHidden beneath a fanciful sheath\n\nA mistress of mayhem and strife\n\nWith the promise of heavenly bliss you'll forfeit your sight\n\nSheltered below this sham curio\n\nMeticulous in its design\n\nThere in your dream, a poisonous rose on the vine\n\nShe's got a:\n\nEvil heart - drawing you into her web\n\nEvil mind - you might just be better off dead\n\nMasquerade\n\nTailoring charms to persuade\n\nMany you know have lost all control\n\nEntranced by her comic ballet\n\nLook to the flash in her eyes, it gives her away\n\nPassions will rage, mimic a cage\n\nEnwrapping you into her spell\n\nPrepare for the fight of your life in love's citadel\n\nShe's got a:\n\nEvil heart - drawing you into her web\n\nEvil mind - you might just be better off dead\n\nMasquerade\n\nTailoring charms to persuade\n\nIt's a masquerade\n\n12. The Magic Of The Chords\n\nHer verse is formed by the light in her eyes\n\nShe's taking control, moving my soul with her bridge of sighs\n\nHer chorus is love's counterpart\n\nHer teardrops can sing to my heart\n\nHer song grows intense by the hour\n\nAnd her power is in the magic of the chords\n\nHer whispers of love shape a sweet flowing melody\n\nHer heartbeat at night, her breath of life in our symphony\n\nAnd when the orchestra plays\n\nSinfonia concertante\n\nCausing my soul to devour\n\nAll the power is in the magic of the chords\n\nHer stanza of hope\n\nPerpetual rhythm and majesty\n\nHer song gives life\n\nWeaving my dreams in her tapestry\n\nLord, she's baring her soul to me\n\nHer promise of love strummed on a gentle mandolin\n\nHer concerto's embrace composed with the grace of a violin\n\nWhen the finale arrives\n\nI'll fight with the will to survive\n\nHer song has the strength to empower\n\nBecause her power is in the magic of the chords\n\n13.
