Manowar in 1992.\n\n00:01:25 - The song Spirit Horse of Cherokee is included in the album The Triumph of Steel, which is the seventh studio album by the American heavy metal band Manowar released on September 29, 1992.\n\n00:01:42 - This album is the first without Ross, the boss, on guitars, which David Shankle was in charge of, and that he would only record this album with Manowar, and without Scott Columbus who was replaced by Rhino.\n\n00:01:56 - This lineup change gave the band a more modern and creative sound.\n\n00:02:06 - Spirit Horse of the Cherokee is a tribute to the native tribe of Cherokee.\n\n00:02:11 - The topic is not new, it had already been played by bands like Iron Maiden on their hit, Run to the Hills, but it was very emotional and full of force.\n\n00:02:24 - The Cherokees occupied, before the arrival of the Europeans, the present southern states of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, since\n\n00:02:38 - Since the arrival of the European settlers at the end of the 16th century, several treaties had been signed with the Cherokees in which the settlers had defined their area of influence, but at the end of the 18th century, coinciding with the War of Independence that would give rise to the birth of the United States, the colonists began to violate these treaties.\n\n00:03:01 - Throughout the entire 19th century there were numerous clashes between the Americans and the Cherokee, inspiring many of the Western movies we all know today.\n\n00:03:13 - Between 1898 and 1906, the federal government of the United States completed the Constitution of the Cherokee Nation to facilitate the incorporation of Indian territory into the state of Oklahoma.\n\n00:03:30 - In the 1970s the Cherokee Nation came to create its own constitution, recognized by the federal government.\n\n00:03:40 - Manawar tries to capture throughout the six minutes that the song lasts the indomitable and free spirit of the Cherokee tribes, starting with a small introduction, narrated where an Indian flute is heard mixed with the howl of the wolves.\n\n00:03:55 - Later, even famous Indians such as Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse are mentioned, mythical fighters against the white oppressor who came from beyond the ocean.\n\n00:04:07 - Without a doubt, this song is a memorable description of the indigenous spirit, and of the commitment that the group has with all injustices.\n\nand contempt that ethnic minorities had to endure throughout the history of mankind.\n\n00:04:26 - Rock and roll is a style that remains in time.\n\n00:04:29 - Stories and bands that made it possible.\n\n00:04:32 - In rock classics of all time.\n\nis\n\n00:05:37 - I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away, I don't want to go away\n\n00:06:07 -
