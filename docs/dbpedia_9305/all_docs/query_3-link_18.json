Sergeant Cheney renders safe and disposes of U.S. and foreign ordnance and explosives that are unsafe and defeats terrorist improvised explosive devices.\n\nMost memorable Air Force moment. \"Graduating EOD school -- the amount of time and work you invest to finally earn your EOD 'Crab' (career field functional badge) and then you realize that it's the end of the school and the beginning of a unique and challenging career.\"\n\nInteresting personal fact: Sergeant Cheney always looks for the good in any situation.\n\nWhy does Sergeant Cheney deserve to be a warrior of the week? \"Sergeant Cheney is a humble, selfless professional who always puts the mission and others first. He demonstrated his warrior ethos and commitment to duty when he saved the lives of three children while deployed. An Iraqi police officer discovered an IED targeting his personal residence. Sergeant Cheney disarmed the IED and saved the lives of the police officer's three children trapped inside the family's home.\"\n\n- Lt. Col.

He recently volunteered for a wing retreat ceremony on his own time as it was a scheduled day off. He is always ready, willing and able to come in to work after duty hours to assist with electrical outages or emergency service calls even when it's not his standby week. His dress and appearance are always impeccable. There are few better or more able Airmen in the squadron.\"\n\n- Master Sgt. David Shankle, 366th CES electrical systems foreman"
