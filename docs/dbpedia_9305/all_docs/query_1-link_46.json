        "text": "DAVID SHANKLE GROUP is a progressive power metal band founded by the legendary guitar virtuoso and master instructor. David “The Shred Demon” Shankle. David is one of the most respected and talented composer guitarists shredding up the metal scene today. He is well known for playing 7 string over-the-neck scales, arpeggios and string skipping, along with being a master of many other guitar techniques. David was a member of MANOWAR from 1988 to 1994, playing on the epic platinum album “The Triumph Of Steel” and co-writing “Master Of The Wind”, “The Burning”, “Ride the Dragon” and “Demon’s Whip”. David left in 1994, after countless sold-out tours all over the world, and attended Roosevelt Music University in Chicago to improve his jazz and classical guitar skills. David’s signature over the neck style guitar playing can be seen on many videos including “Ashes To Ashes” and the 2005 MANOWAR Earthshaker Fest DVD. Now having refined and nearly perfected his craft, David brings decades of experience and hard work to the table with the DAVID SHANKLE GROUP."
