        "text": "JoAnne Shankle, beloved sister, mother, grandmother, mother-in-law and dear friend, passed away Oct. 24, 2021 at the age of 89. JoAnne leaves behind her children, Susan Gordon (Michael Gordon), Steven Shankle (Marianne Acuna); her daughter-in-law, Meredith Shankle, and her grandchildren, Danny, Emily, Casey, Perry, Anne, Caleb, Olivia, Lainey, Flor and Steven. She was preceded in death by her late husband, Arthur Perry Shankle Jr.; her son, Joe Shankle, and her sister, Paula Karnopp. JoAnne was born in Fort Worth, Texas, the daughter of a police officer. She met and married her husband Perry, a foreign service officer, and they embarked on a lifetime of adventure and travel to many countries including Ecuador, Spain, Chile, Bolivia, Mexico, and the Bahamas. Upon returning to the states, JoAnne and Perry made their home in Bethesda, Maryland. Joanne worked as an educator all over the world and as a successful real estate agent in the D.C. metro area. After losing Perry, she retired to their home on the Chesapeake Bay in Mathews County, Virginia, with dear friends and her dog “Chessie.” JoAnne lived a life of love, enthusiasm and joy, and loved her family and friends fiercely. She was a mother figure to many and a protector of all who loved her. A memorial service will be held Monday, Nov. 22, 2021, at 11 a.m. at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, 16420 Westland Drive, Gaithersburg, Md. 20877. In lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation to the Bay School Arts program in Mathews County, https://www.bayschool-arts.com/products/donation-page.\n\nFaulkner Funeral Homes, Foster-Faulkner Chapel, Mathews, is assisting the family."
