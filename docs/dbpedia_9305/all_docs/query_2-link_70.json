        "text": "Leadership\n\nCoach Akers was an outstanding leader. He would clearly articulate our vision and goals and emphasize the importance of teamwork and place the needs of the team above our own individual desires. The team first, then me. I carried this learning into the working world, and it allowed me to be a great team player at work.\n\nDress For Success\n\nI watched how Coach Aker’s dressed. He was always sharp. Off the field, he was always in a sports jacket and, most of the time, a tie. The players were also dressed in suits and ties on game day. It was at UT that I would learn how to tie a necktie. This was important learning that I carried over as I interviewed for jobs and the working world.\n\nEncouragement.\n\nCoach Akers would always motivate us before games. He would have us spend time with our eyes closed in a safe, quiet place to visualize how we would execute our plays and assignments during the game. However, the coach also personally and individually encouraged me off the field in two ways that I shall never forget.\n\nMy Grandmother, who raised me, passed away my freshman year in college. It was a pleasant and encouraging surprise to see several of my coaches and Coach Akers at the funeral to support and encourage me.\n\nCoach Akers’ support for me did not end after I left the 40 Acres. Nine years ago, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Colon Cancer, and a mass was also discovered on my kidney. I did not know if I was going to live or die. I can recall Coach Akers calling me the day before my major surgery at UT MD Anderson, and he provided me with a passionate message of encouragement. He told me I was tough-minded and would beat my prognosis. “You can do it.”’ Six years later, I was declared cancer free. His words of encouragement and support meant a lot to me. I enjoy encouraging others since I understand how positive affirmations impact people."
