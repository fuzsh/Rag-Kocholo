        "text": "BABCOCK, Judge.\n\nThe sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the insurance company defendants in a wrongful death action have a duty to distribute, or monitor distribution of, settlement proceeds to all potential beneficiaries under the Colorado wrongful death statute. We hold that there is no such duty.\n\nLeila Shankle (Leila) filed a wrongful death action approximately six months after the accidental death of her husband. The action was settled in December 1980, by a $48,000 payment to Leila by defendants Hartford Accident and Fidelity Co., Western Casualty and Surety Co., Western Fire Insurance Co., and State Auto & Casualty Underwriters (insurance companies). Pursuant to the settlement, Leila executed a release and indemnity agreement binding herself individually and as \"executrix and administratrix\" of her husband's estate. Thereafter, the wrongful death action was dismissed with prejudice.\n\nIn March 1983, plaintiffs, Mary Campbell, David W. Shankle, and Debra King, the decedent's adult children from a previous marriage, brought this suit alleging that Leila had made no distribution of the settlement proceeds and that the insurance companies knew or should have known she was likely to abscond with these proceeds. The complaint sought recovery of that portion of the settlement proceeds to which plaintiffs claimed to be entitled pursuant to ยง 13-21-201(2), C.R.S., together with exemplary damages, on the theory that the insurance companies had a duty to assure that plaintiffs' shares in the settlement proceeds were distributed to them.\n\nThe trial court granted the insurance companies' motion to dismiss concluding that no such duty was owed to plaintiffs. This appeal followed.\n\nAn action for wrongful death is a creature of statute which did not exist at common law; therefore, the proper method for distribution of monies recovered in connection with a wrongful death action must be derived exclusively from the terms of the wrongful death statute. Clint v. Stolworthy, 144 Colo. 597, 357 P.2d 649 ( )."
