        "text": "Chicago’s SULLVATION has self-released an explosive solo album “The Beginning of the End” from bassist Brent Sullivan, who co-founded legendary underground bands SLAUTER, XSTROYES, WINTER KILL and MINDWARP CHAMBER. Sullivan’s writing and musical style takes listeners on a journey from power to progressive metal, captivating all with an old school feel and modern-day touch. Notes from iconic bands reminiscent of JUDAS PRIEST, METAL CHURCH and SLAYER ring throughout. Joining Sullivan is long-time friend and former bandmate Chuck White (VEIN). Sullivan recruited some of his favorite local Chicagoland musicians, assembling a small tribute to local talent. Treating metal fans to a variety of strong melodic vocal performances the album soars with talented metal singers including the infamous Tim “Ripper” Owens adding a special treat between tours. Amazing local lead guitarists add twists of metal, from previous bands and new collaborations featuring the shred master himself David Shankle (MANOWAR). Whether a new or long-time fan of Brent Sullivan’s work and his incredible bass playing, this album, loaded with killer riffs from start to finish, is sure to please. Metal heads will appreciate the unique writing style and locals are sure to know someone adding their talents to this masterpiece and adding this from Sullivan: “This album was an interesting task. Originally it was gonna be a lot of bass highlights and much of my writing style is complex, odd timings, epic long tunes that take you on a journey. I realize that style is an acquired taste and limits the audience so I chose to really focus on an album that most anyone who loves metal can appreciate. Then I thought to myself, why not invite some of my favorite local musicians to join me on this journey. My goal in the end was to have well written songs, strong vocals, blazing leads, bass and wrapped up in a great production that sounds amazing. I pretty damn proud of the final result and hope you are as well. Next one might get a little crazier”\n\nThe SULLVATION album “The Beginning of the End” opens on a sinister note on “The One” featuring Kevin Truell on vocals and Gary Bernal lead guitar with an eerie backdrop over some heavy guitar riffs and even heavier drumbeats as the vocals arise out of the graveyard to produce a bone chilling, tormented sound that had me quickly turning on all the lights and looking for a wooden stake. “Screaming in Silence” featuring Tim “Ripper” Owens on vocals and Paul Kratky lead guitar is a dose of heavy duty, grinding riffs as the unmistakable pipes of “Ripper” take over and deliver a sucker punch to the heart with his captivating voice and to the senses with these intense lyrics: “All of the lies, all of the fears, watching through the camera eye, screaming in silence, twisted lies are never what they seem, we’re shaping the violence, hear the laughter as the masses bleed, craving the silence, no one wants to hear you scream”. “We come in Peace” featuring Lothar Keller on vocals and Jeff Tredwell lead is a full-fledged headbanger with smashmouth riffs and the sinister vocal delivery reminiscent of the early days of UDO and ACCEPT but craving out their own personal identity. “What you don’t Know” featuring Taran DePablos on vocals and David “Shred Demon” Shankle lead hits the mark big time, grab a cold one and crank it up to eleven. A true headbanger with all the right metal elements combining stellar vocals blended beautifully with crisp, blistering guitar riffs, ensuring a lot of fist-pumping on this beast. “Carry On” featuring Taran DePablos on vocals and Jeff Tredwell lead is a savage combination of bludgeoning and ripping guitar chops, energetic solos, and old school metal screams that brought me straight back to the 80’s (in a good way) highlights this true rocker."
