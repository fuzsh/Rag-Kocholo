        "text": "Our Leadership\n\nJesus Christ\n\nJesus Christ is the head of the church. We believe that “all power in heaven and earth is given to Jesus Christ by Almighty God, who raised Christ from the dead and set him above all rule and authority, all power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. God has put all things under the Lordship of Jesus Christ and has made Christ Head of the Church, which is his body.” (G1.0100a)\n\nWe strive to follow Jesus with all that we do and with all that we are. We are guided in this by our Officers, the Elders and Deacons of Trinity Presbyterian Church.\n\nChurch Officers – Elders & Deacons\n\nThe elders on Session have responsibility for governing the congregation and guiding its witness. Each year, the congregation elects three Elders to serve a three year term of service on session. Our session consists of nine Elders and the Pastor.
