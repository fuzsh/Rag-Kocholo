        "text": "To entities and individuals operating within the health care industry, Epstein Becker Green is a trusted and experienced business partner.\n\nSince our founding, participants throughout the health care delivery system have relied on our sophisticated team and depth of experience as they grow and adapt within a highly regulated and rapidly changing environment. We guide clients through corporate transactions, health care regulatory compliance (including anti-kickback and Stark reforms), data privacy and cybersecurity protocols, government investigations, complex litigation, and much more.\n\nProviders and payors value our extensive managed care experience, while venture capital and private equity funds seek our insight to evaluate health-related investment targets. As artificial intelligence, telehealth, and virtual solutions take center stage, we’re advising clients on safe and compliant ways to harness powerful technologies.\n\nRead more\n\nOur Team Sets Us Apart\n\nAs the country’s go-to health care practice, with approximately 150 lawyers fully focused on health care law, we know the industry inside and out. Our practice includes attorneys with real-world experience as former high-level government officials and health care industry in-house counsel. Our team has a diverse range of experience in corporate transactions (including pre- and post-acquisition compliance due diligence), fraud and abuse, government investigations, reimbursement, managed care, antitrust, tax, ERISA, and litigation, and members collaborate to provide clients with creative solutions to new and novel issues with a cost-efficient approach.\n\nFostering Innovation with Creative Solutions\n\nThe virtual health markets are racing to keep up with demand. New digital health entrants from across the country are turning to Epstein Becker Green for strategic solutions to conceptualize, launch, and grow their cutting-edge platforms. We draw on our in-depth regulatory knowledge to explain the federal and state laws and regulations our clients need to care about as they develop their market presence. (For practitioners interested in the online delivery of behavioral health services, we continue to update our invaluable app, Telemental Health Laws, a comprehensive collection of state regulatory requirements for all 50 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.) With our guidance, clients are enabled and empowered to make confident business decisions.\n\nGuiding Clients Through Health Care Reforms\n\nWith each presidential administration comes changes, opportunities, and challenges to the health care system. Epstein Becker Green continues to operate at the center of this ever-changing health care landscape, providing strategic advice to help clients navigate the intricate compliance mandates, enforcement actions, and policy changes impacting their operations. Our lawyers collaborate with colleagues from our affiliate, EBG Advisors, Inc., when necessary, to fulfill a client’s policy analysis, regulatory compliance, and other consulting needs.\n\nMinimizing Client Risk with Effective Compliance Programs\n\nContinued enforcement activity against health care organizations has placed a premium on sophisticated corporate compliance programs. Clients trust us to create and help them implement right-sized, effective corporate compliance programs before a governmental fraud investigation occurs. We design corporate compliance programs to conform to applicable federal and state laws and regulations but aligned with real-world operations and risks and adaptable as businesses grow. We also provide in-depth training for the client management teams and employees, addressing specific areas of vulnerability, program implementation, and ongoing oversight, when needed.\n\nDefending Clients’ Interests in Government Investigations and Litigation\n\nGovernment investigations and litigation in the health care industry are complex, high-stakes matters that typically involve business disruption and serious reputational and financial harm. Because we are knowledgeable, not just in government investigations and litigation but in all phases of health care financing, delivery, and reimbursement, we have the resources that frequently allow clients to resolve disputes with government agencies and payors at an early stage, often in conjunction with internal investigations that we conduct on behalf of management, boards of directors, and audit committees. Counting among our ranks former federal and state prosecutors, as well as lawyers with decades of health care litigation experience, we have accumulated an outstanding record of successes defending and resolving fraud and qui tam cases; regulatory inquiries; exclusion, debarment, and other administrative proceedings; and reimbursement, financing, and government contract-related matters.\n\nInvesting in the Future of Health Care\n\nOur commitment to the health care industry extends far beyond our legal practice. Several team members have established nonprofit organizations devoted to improving the U.S. health care system. Lynn Shapiro Snyder founded the Women Business Leaders of the U.S. Health Care Industry Foundation, a premier national nonprofit organization of senior women health care industry executives. Carrie Valiant founded the Health Care Industry Access Initiative, which is dedicated to promoting collaborative action across the health care industry and improving access to health care coverage and services. In addition, Epstein Becker Green’s annual Health Law Writing Competition encourages law school students to prepare scholarly papers on current topics of interest relating to health law.\n\nWe also host the Future Lawyer’s Program for college students who are interested in pursuing a career in law or for students who have not decided but want to learn more about becoming a lawyer. These efforts, coupled with our 1L Diversity Pipeline and Summer Associates programs, continue to cultivate the next generation of health care leaders.\n\nRead less"
