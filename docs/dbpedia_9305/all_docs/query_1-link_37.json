        "text": "DAVID SHANKLE GROUP BIOGRAPHY\n\nDavid Shankle doesnât require any introduction in the metal scene. Everybody will remember him as the legendary guitarist of the loudest band on earth, Manowar, in which he was a member from 1988 to 1995. During those years, Davidâs virtuosic high-speed guitar playing and breathtaking solos thrilled Manowar fans around the world. Furthermore, it was David who co-wrote with Joey DeMaio a song that has since become one of the biggest Manowar classicsââMaster Of The Windââreleased on the gold-awarded album The Triumph Of Steel. David Shankle and Manowar formed an excellent liaison, and it is not surprising that leaving Manowar was one of the hardest decisions in Davidâs life. Contrary to many of his competitors in the music scene, however, David felt there was more to achieve, more to learn, so he went to Roosevelt Music University in Chicago to study jazz and classical guitar. Now, he is regarded as one of the best guitarists in his field, and has more than a hundred students.\n\nA hot project needs the right timing and the perfect combination of peopleâthis became the case when David Shankle formed his new band, the David Shankle Group (DSG). One of the most important partners for David in this new venture was his long-time friend Trace Edward Zaber. In Davidâs eyes, Trace was the only vocalist he would consider for the project, the only singer whose voice could withstand the demanding vocal lines of these blistering tracks. David and Trace have known each other for many years and collaborated on numerous projects. But it was only when the David Shankle Group came to life that they knew this was truly the project for which both of them had been waiting. Ashes to Ashes, DSGâs brilliant debut album (due to be released in June, 2003), gives proof to how astonishingly Traceâs vocals add to the musicâit simply is the perfect combination.\n\nThe other members of DSG are Brian Gordon on bass, who played in renowned classical and jazz festivals in Europe and North America before his 20th birthday; Eddy âShreddyâ Bethishou, a true genius on keyboards, hitting the keys in breathtaking speed and competing with David on playing the fastest riffs; and Eddie Foltz, who, as legend tells us, was born with drumsticks firmly in hand.\n\nTogether, these five individuals truly rock the house and bring down the walls. The album features a broad mix of exceptional heavy metal songs, speedy instrumentals, and epic ballads in true heavy-metal fashion. And in all of this, you will also find a touch of jazz and classical music. The variety of music on the album has proven a huge advantage, since David was reluctant to stick to only one musical style, but wanted to experiment with all the styles he loves. Additionally, all of the band members proved willing to walk on new paths, which proved vital.\n\nThe result is the stunning debut album Ashes to Ashes, a work that will not only fascinate every metal fan, but will also capture the attention of every demanding musician, who will raise their eyebrows in respect. Itâs not only Davidâs incredibly fast riffs, itâs not only the grand musical epics, but the flawless presentation of the extraordinary skills the musicians have in common, as on the uptempo opener âAshes to Ashes.â The ballad âCalling All Heroesâ is a true masterpiece of composition, with valid chances of becoming a smash hit on all rock-oriented radio stations.\n\nDAVID SHANKLE GROUP GENRES\n\nHeavy/Power/Shred\n\nDAVID SHANKLE GROUP LYRICAL THEMES\n\nWar, Freedom, Glory, Honor, Heavy Metal\n\nDAVID SHANKLE GROUP ORIGIN\n\nUnited States of America (Chicago, Illinois), formed in 2002\n\nDAVID SHANKLE GROUP CURRENT RECORD LABEL\n\nMagic Circle Music\n\nDAVID SHANKLE GROUP STATUS\n\nActive\n\nDAVID SHANKLE GROUP CURRENT LINE-UP\n\nDennis Hirschauer - Vocals (Bias Authority)\n\nDavid Shankle - Guitars (ex-Manowar)\n\nJeff Kylloe - Bass\n\nBrad Sabathne - Drums (Sacred Dawn, Lying in Ashes)\n\nDAVID SHANKLE GROUP PREVIOUS LINE-UP"
