        "text": "All Hot Sauces from Hellfire\n\nSince 2009, Hellfire has been creating delicious hot sauces in every heat level. We bring the flavor and heat of exotic chili peppers, sweet fruits, and bold spices to every palate and to all your favorite recipes. Since the Sauceress and the Chilimaster made their original hot sauce from the amazing pepper varieties they grew themselves, Hellfire has been setting the bar for artisanal homemade hot sauces.\n\nHow Hellfire Makes Award-Winning Hot Sauces\n\nAt Hellfire, we blend the freshest ingredients and hot peppers in the world to create unique flavor profiles that will set the world on fire with flavor. We were named as one of the healthiest hot pepper sauces on the market by Men’s Fitness Magazine in recognition of our natural pepper heat and simple ingredients. Hellfire hot sauces have won prestigious awards and been featured on the mega-hit show Hot Ones as some of the most amazing hot sauces available.\n\nThe Scoville organoleptic test is the gold standard for measuring the heat scale of sauces containing chili peppers. We use some of the hottest peppers on the Scoville scale in our original hot sauces and mild hot sauce blends, including cayenne peppers, Carolina Reapers, ghost peppers, red chilis, Trinidad scorpions, and habanero peppers. The heat is balanced with a cornucopia of spices and ingredients such as garlic, mangos, watermelon, apples, chocolate, ginger, and sun-dried tomatoes.\n\nBring Every Level of Hellfire to Your Table\n\nEnjoy liquor infusions and spice rubs that send your steaks, burgers, buffalo wings and scrambled eggs to delicious depths of rich flavor. We have habanero hot sauces in mild mixes that introduce the exotic flavors of hot peppers to the palate, medium hot sauces for the perfect balance of fire and flavor, and the hottest sauces that bring tears to the eyes of seasoned chiliheads. Browse the sauces, pick your own case or 4-pack, and find the level of Hellfire you need in your life."
