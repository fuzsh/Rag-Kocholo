        "text": "David Murray, a redshirt junior tight end and full-back at Prairie View A&M University, hails from Katy, Texas. He is majoring in Mechanical Engineering.\n\nDavid is a fan of Kevin Hart, appreciating his humor and energy, and his favorite all-time movie is Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, reflecting his love for creative and visually captivating stories. Tamales are his go-to comfort food, and he treasures Christmas for its festive atmosphere and time spent with family.\n\nWhen he’s not on the field, David enjoys a variety of activities including watching anime, playing video games, bowling, and skating. On game days, he keeps his routine simple but effective: getting his ankles taped and ensuring he has the right music to help him focus and get in the zone.\n\nDavid views staying motivated and maintaining focus as significant challenges for today’s athletes, emphasizing the need for mental resilience to achieve their goals. One of his standout moments in sports was during high school when he returned a kickoff for a touchdown with 30 seconds left on the clock, a play that secured his team's undefeated season.\n\nLooking ahead, David plans to achieve his master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and start a career in the field. He aims to design and build innovative solutions, with a long-term goal of creating something impactful. His dream job is to be a head engineer, ideally running his own company.\n\nDavid chose Prairie View A&M University because it offered him an opportunity to excel academically and athletically while being close to home. The university’s strong engineering program and supportive environment made it the ideal place for him to pursue his goals."
