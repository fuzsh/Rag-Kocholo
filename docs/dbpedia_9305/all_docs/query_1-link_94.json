        "text": "Gloria Jean LaBrush, 80, of Frederick, Maryland, passed from this life on Friday, November 4, 2022, at Kline Hospice in Mount Airy, MD.\n\nBorn on December 25, 1941, in Mountaindale, MD, she was the daughter of the late Earl William and Margaret Estella (Painter) Houck.\n\nGloria was a 1959 graduate of Frederick High School. After graduation, she began her career at the C&P Telephone Company as a switchboard operator and then served in many other positions throughout her career until retirement. After retirement she worked as a receptionist for Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage and Coldwell Banker Innovations. She had a great love for her family as well as her friends, especially her social groups - Classmates of 1959, POOF (Past Operators of Frederick) and The SweeTeas. Gloria was a longtime member of Evangelical Lutheran Church. She enjoyed spending time with her family and friends. She was a history buff and loved watching history and nature shows on TV. Even though she only flew in an airplane once, she has been all over the world watching the Aerial America show. She loved and listened to all kinds of music, but rock ‘n’ roll and The Eagles were her favorite. She will always be remembered by her big smile and loving heart.\n\nShe is survived by her daughter, Christi L. Roberts, and husband Charles of Jefferson, two granddaughters, Heather and Brianna Roberts of Frederick, brother, Thomas Houck (Eddie) of Frederick, brother-in-law, Clyde LaBrush and wife Connie of Sabillasville, sisters-in-law, Barbara Shankle of Frederick and Dorothy (Dottie) LaBrush of Boonsboro, and many cousins, nieces and nephews, and special friends.\n\nShe was preceded in death by husband Alfred H. LaBrush, brother Earl W. Houck Jr. (Sonny) and wife Kitty, sister Helen Wiles and husband Earl, sisters-in-law Patricia Strailman and Gerry Houck, brothers-in-law Paul LaBrush and David Shankle, sister-in-law Ruth Miller and husband Richard, and nephews Steven and Daniel Wiles.\n\nThe family will receive friends from 2-4 pm and 6-8 pm on Friday, November 18, 2022, at Stauffer Funeral Homes, P.A. (Fred), 1621 Opossumtown Pike in Frederick, MD.\n\nA celebration of Gloria's life journey will take place at 11 am on Saturday, November 19, 2022, at Evangelical Lutheran Church, 31 E. Church Street in Frederick, MD. Pastor Paul Baglyos will officiate.\n\nMemorial donations may be made to either Kline Hospice House, frederickhealthhospice.org or Evangelical Lutheran Church at the said above mentioned address."
