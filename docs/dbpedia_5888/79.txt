Trivia[]

Phoenix was replaced by Patrick Dempsey for playing Kenai in the sequel to Brother Bear due to Phoenix having scheduling conflicts. Both Phoenix and Dempsey share Kenai as their only voice acting role to date.[citation needed]

Phoenix was considered to play Captain Hook in Peter Pan & Wendy before Jude Law was chosen.[1]

Contrary to popular belief, the scar on his upper lip is not the result of a repaired cleft lip or palate. It's simply a birthmark. Phoenix has stated in interviews that when his mother was pregnant with him, she felt a sharp pain one day, and he was born with a mark on his lip.[citation needed]
