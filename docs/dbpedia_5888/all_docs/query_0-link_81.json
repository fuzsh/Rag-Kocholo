The presentation outlined with charts and graphs all the economic and special benefits that would accrue to the Papago people. Everyone listened attentively, and following the presentation there was respectful silence. After what seemed a long time to the ream of experts, one old Indian elder got up at the back and asked, >But does God want you to do this to the land?= The university team was immobilized. They didn=t know how to respond to this question about sacred (religious) sanction. So they repeated all their statistics and other data outlining benefits. Again, there was silence.
