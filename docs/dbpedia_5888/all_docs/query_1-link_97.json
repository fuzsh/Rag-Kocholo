        "text": "On Monday, February 11, 2020, the morning after winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in JOKER, Joaquin Phoenix met with a packinghouse owner in Los Angeles who agreed to release a mother and calf, which was born at the slaughterhouse. LIBERTY tells the story of that meeting and how the animals were transported to Farm Sanctuary in Acton, CA.\n\nOne year later, Joaquin returned to Farm Sanctuary to visit the mother, named Liberty, and her beloved calf, called Indigo. The subsequent film, entitled INDIGO, was released on Earth Day, 2021."
