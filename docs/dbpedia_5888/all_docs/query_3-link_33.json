        "text": "During the 80's I was quite inspired by the amazing unforgettable actor and activist River Phoenix, the late Brother of Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nRiver Phoenix would often talk about animal rights and the environment when I was a teenager, and at the time as a vegetarian since1980 at the age of 7, I realized how important was the information he was delivering through the '80s and early '90s.\n\nIt was just a matter of time for me to ditch dairy and flashes of animals and become vegan later, and with more awareness then boycott products tested on animals and objects with animal cruelty in it.\n\nAs years passed by, I became more aware of River's phoenix family's important activism, and their incredible journey as a family.\n\nIt turned out that River Phoenix, the late brother of Joaquin Phoenix came from a family of activists in many fields such as animal-rights, environment, unity, and peace.\n\nHis siblings, besides Joaquin, are Rain, Summer, Rainbow. He is the son of Heart Phoenix, and their late father is John Lee Botton.\n\nJoaquin phoenix mom heart Phoenix runs until this day the educational charity, inspired by River Phoenix causes when he as alive; \"River Phoenix Center of Peace Building\" in Florida.\n\nIt was quite impressive to find out how involved all of them were on important causes and determine to make a positive impact in the world, and what can be more inspiring than a family who is united to educate the public for a better world?\n\nThe death of River Phoenix, on October 31st in LA at the Viper Room, was nothing but devastating and painful for many, but it was unimaginable devastation for River's family and close friends who he influenced the most and was have touched to each one of them in a different level than the ones who knew of his work and causes.\n\nRiver's family more then anyone knew how important was his charities, causes, and wishes, furthermore, after his death, they all kept carried on all types of causes, mostly on animal rights and environment, a topic deeply discussed in the family and between River' s friends for many years.\n\nJust like River Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix became a dedicated actor, and I guess that he was inspired by his older brother River's dedication to acting, although River had a big passion for music as well.\n\nMusic was another passion shared within the Phoenix family, Joaquin's sister Rain Phoenix, kept singing and until this day, and has been making great music after she was in the band with her brother River, Aleka's Attic; a band that had animal rights and environment-related songs.\n\nRain Phoenix freshly released a new album in tribute of her brother River Phoenix named River on October 31st, with beautiful songs in which many that lost a loved one can relate.\n\nThe whole phoenix family is not only a long-time activist but an incredibly talented and dedicated artist.\n\nRain Phoenix is being high acclaimed for her new album in which features Michae Stripe from R.E.M, who is a long with time friend of her was a long-time friend of her late brother Phoenix and also Kurt Cobain.\n\nRiver Phoenix had touched many who he worked within the film industry but also many in the music scene, such as members of the Red Hot Chilli Pepper, and speculations that he touched the life of Kurt Cobain as well, who after his death dedicated one of his songs to him during a concert\n\nNew song released by Rain Phoenix and Michael Stipe Time is the Killer\n\nYears kept passing by Joaquin Phoenix, kept delivering amazing acting performances in different films, and we would often see within the animal rights movement talking on behalf of animals, and the injustice committed against animals for food, and objects.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix 's family are long-time vegans, and aware of the horrific impact animal farming and fishing causes to our environment, therefore to see Jane Fonda giving him a platform to let everybody knows the difference that each one of us can make today towards our current warming climate emergency, was extremely important.\n\nScience doesn' have a political party, and sadly humans had reached a turning point to have such an ecological crisis in which each one of us needs to consider to change our habits, and demand action as well for the sake of the future generations.\n\nJoaquin Pheonix got a lot of highlights on his last remarkable performance in the film Joker and used that as a platform to bring attention to the much-needed animal rights and environment movement\n\nThe writer Willian Burrought once said \"\n\n“Artists to my mind are the real architects of change and not the political legislators who implement change after the fact\".\n\nThe animals and our climate couldn't more grateful for Joaquin's important statements.\n\nAll animal lovers who understand the pain that these animals go through for food and objects and at the serious damage that animal farming and fishing cause to our biodiversity, soil, trees, water, hope that his statements will impact the lives of many leading the change to most to change food choices.\n\nJoaquin mentioned on the Fire Drill Friday speech, that the horrific devastation towards out planet that animal agriculture causes is not discussed on the environment movement, and explained that there is something we can do today to diminish our carbon footprint on the planet which is ditching flashes of animals and their products from their plates and choosing the endless sustainable food alternatives.\n\nJoaquin ended up winning the Golden Globes that decided to serve vegan food options for the first time as a very important statement, which is eating animals and their products is no longer a personal choice, the pieces of evidence are undeniable, and eating animals and their products have drastic consequences.\n\nAnimal farming and the fishing industry are the third leading cause of climate change and have been causing horrific devastation to our planets such as 70 % of the water contamination, waste of water, loss of biodiversity, emissions of massive No2, greenhouses, methane, soil pollution, deforestation, extinction of species, massive loss of Habitat among other serious issues.\n\nJoaquin mentioned that he was never so proud to attend an award event that was so compassionate and brave to do such a change and serve vegan options.\n\nJoaquin urged others awards and everyone to do the same, and his activism will continue and the same goes for whoever wants to end the unnecessary violence towards animals that is one of the leading causes of our ecologic crises.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix's older late brother River Phoenix has influenced many from my generation to go vegan and become better humans. Today his young brother Joaquin Phoenix is using his platform to influence the young generation of today which is incredibly powerful to whoever been following the long-time activism of the Phoenix family which was unnoticed for the mainstream until now.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix took a quick break from the Screen Actors Guild Awards festivities on Sunday to comfort and offer water to pigs at a Los Angeles slaughterhouse, which is a resemblance of who Joaquin and his family are all about, it didn't start today, it started when he was a little kid.\n\nIn 2011, Joaquin Phoenix visited an indigenous tribe in Yawanawa in the Amazon, Brazil;\n\na tribe facing serious environmental threats from the cattle ranching in the Rain forest that is leading cause for contaminating their water, rivers, and way of living.\n\nAnimal agriculture is responsible for 91% of the amazon destruction, loss of biodiversity, loss of indigenous land among other serious issues. Joaquin did a series on his visit to this indigenous tribe in the Amazon and experienced their lifestyle.\n\nThe rain forest was a long-time concern of the Phoenix family and his late brother River, often expressed how horrified he was about the destruction of the largest biodiversity in the planet, that represents 20% of the Co2 we breathe, therefore Joaquin Phoenix expressed his tremendous gratitude and how much it meat to him to be there.\n\nHe heard first hand from the indigenous leaders, the serious threats such as diseases caused by water contamination which is one of the leading causes for animal farming. Animal farming is caused by colonization from Europe, it aggravated ith industrial times and escalated through the years. Today the Amazon has reached a turning point, putting in danger our climate, a fear that his late brother River had back in the '80s.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as a kid, already a vegan with his late brother RiverPhoenix, the photo was shared by one of the many River Phoenix fan pages on Instagram, where we can see how River still inspires. many until this day.\n\nWhen Joaquin was little, he and his siblings lived in a cult in Venezuela Child of God. and when they fled the cult, somehow. they were able to bein a cargo ship and go back to the USA and start a new life, Phoenix the last name means a new beginning, after all, they wanted to leave the traumatic experience in the cult behind and they successfully left all behind and started a new life by rising in many aspects.\n\nHow the Pheonix family stared at the entertainment business\n\nOne Joaquin Phoenix Family was back in the USA, the parents took their five children and headed back to California where Joaquin and his siblings would be singing in the streets ofLA, after their mother, Heart Phoenix got a job as an executive secretary for NBC. She later hired an agent, Iris Burton , who eventually got all of her children acting work. John and Heart Phoenix divorced in 1997. Heart Phoenix is now married to Jefferey Weisberg.\n\nJoaquin Stared his acting career for the first years using the name of Leaf, his original name was Joaquín Rafael Bottom, he was born in Rio Piedras in Puerto Rico in 1974 to American born parents, His father John Lee Botton from California was from California 1947-1973 and mother was born in New York City to Ashkenazi Jewish parents, He is the third of five children, following River (1970–1993) and Rain (born 1972), and preceding Liberty (born 1976) and Summer (born 1978), all of whom are actors. He also has a half-sister named Jodean (born 1964) from a previous relationship with his father.\n\nEach one of the Joaquin siblings was born in different places; The oldest River was born in Madras OR, Rain was born in Crocket TX Liberty was born in Caracas Venezuela and the youngest Summer in Winter Park Fl.\n\nHeart Phoenix was the Executive Director of The Florida School of Traditional Midwifery for five years, one of ten accredited direct-entry Midwifery schools in the country.\n\nIt was never an issue to cast all the kids, they all knew how to sing and play instruments and would sing in the streets, attracting the attention of many, and from that River, Joaquin, Rain, Summer, and Liberty started auditioning. It turned out that all of them were extremely talented and getting parts on TV series and movies was not an issue.\n\nThat was the start of a long-time dedication in the art fields, acting, and music besides their activism\n\nRain Phoenix, after the death of her brother River, kept doing beautiful music with the band Papercranes and others.\n\nLiberty Phoenix on the\n\nMegan Fox movies: Kate's Secret (1986) Meredith Baxter TV Movie\n\nSummer Phoenix, the youngest later was cast on good films such as \" The Believer \" in 2001 with Ryan Goslin and other films.\n\nSummer married Casey Afleck who became vegan as well, who was a long time Joaquin Phoenix close friend since they did the film To Die For' is a 1995 American crime comedy-drama film, made in a mockumentary format, with Nicole Kidman directed by Gus Van Sant.\n\nBefore Joaquin Phoenix worked with Casey Affleck, Nicole Kidman, in the Gus Van Sant film \" To Die for \" ;\n\nRiver Phoenix delivered a historical moving performance, on the iconic film by the same director of 'To Die For \" Gus Van Saint, \".My own private Idaho in 1991.\n\nRiver often jammed in the set with Flea, the bass player of Red Hot Chilli Pepper, during the making of My Own Private Idaho. Flea was part of the casting for the film and one of the closest friends of River Phoenix.\n\nRiver Phoenix was nominated for Oscars for his whole \"Running on Empty\", which he did a remarkable performance as a talented piano player that led him to make endless interviews about his character.\n\nOther than 'Running on Empty' by Sidney Lumet, River was cast on Stand By Me with Corey Feldman and others, and other amazing films that touched not only the audience but the lives of everyone who he worked with.\n\nMost notably, as a testament to his environmentalism, River Phoenix once bought 800 acres of rainforest on the border of Costa Rica and Panama, as well as created a non-profit to save endangered species.\n\n\"I want to buy the last 'first growth forest' and turn it into a national park,\" he said. \"It’s a human tragedy of immense proportions. Many native Indians in that region are losing their homes daily, and it’s going to affect both you and me because that’s where most of the world’s oxygen comes from. The Amazon rain forests are the world’s lungs and without them, we will not be able to breathe. It’s a very scary thought and it’s not too far off.\"\n\nAfter Phoenix's death in 1993, the land was eventually sold to a conservancy and the funds were used to create the River Phoenix Center for Peace-building in Gainesville, Florida.\n\nIt is quite powerful to see Joaquin Phoenix, sticking with who he is, and where he comes from and taking the very important Vegan cause forward.\n\nIt is incredibly powerful what the Phoenix Family has been doing for the animals, the environment, and unity throughout the years.\n\nThe lives of the Phoenix family are an example that any regular individual can also cause a positive impact on the lives of animals, the environment and our societies, the change always start with us.\n\nJoaquin and his family were unknown when they became vegans and activists, but they empowered themselves, and that is an example for all of us to empower others who share the same values and causes.\n\nNobody is irrelevant when we chose to go vegan for the animals and the environment. We all have the voice to let others know the horrific truth behind animal farming and the negative impact on our surroundings.\n\nWhen one human goes vegan, we are diminishing unnecessary animal cruelty, we are saving acres of land, water and more.\n\nToday, in the year of 2020, I have been inspired by all vegans I come across on my everyday life, each one has a voice that the animals and our ecosystem don't\n\nAccording to the latest Oxford University Going vegan is the single biggest way to diminish our carbon footprint by 65% if not more.\n\nWe are living in times, where going vegan is crucial for a less violent world and to diminish the devastation of our planet."
