        "text": "(Image by Harald Krichel via CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\n“Put on a happy face!”\n\nWhile most people attribute that quote to Joaquin Phoenix’s smash hit film Joker, I want to point out that it was originally used by Jack Nicholson’s take on the character in the 1989 Batman film.\n\n(Yes, I am a comic book geek).\n\n“Put on a happy face,” is one of my favorite quotes because it’s a euphemism for, “hang in there!”\n\nSometimes, when we want to achieve a goal our own way, it can be a road fraught with obstacles, temptations, and wrong turns.\n\nFor example, like giving in to the urge to quit a job and pursue a private business endeavor.\n\nOr, being a member of a famous acting family and endeavoring to perform in independent and art-house films for scale pay.\n\nIncredibly, Joaquin Phoenix was originally tapped to play Doctor Strange in the Marvel films, and turned down the role (and possibily a large payday).\n\nPhoenix continued making small indie films on his own terms and finally starred in a comic book film, Joker, which made a billion at the box office.\n\nAnd, earned him the 2020 best actor Academy Award.\n\nSometimes, to get what you want on your own terms, you have to struggle through and put on a happy face.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix is an artistic iconoclast, rebel, and a strong-willed actor who spent decades making scale pay creating art on his own terms. Now, he is one of the most highly paid actors in the business.\n\nYou may not be an award-winning actor, but you can use the same mindset to pursue your dreams wisely, on your terms, and for better pay.\n\nSo, let’s trace Phoenix early career moves, examine why he accepted smaller paydays for roles for indie roles that interested him, and how such long-term planning added to his net worth.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJoaquin Rafael Phoenix was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico on October 28, 1974. Phoenix and his siblings, his older brother River and younger sisters Summer and Liberty, traveled throughout Central and South America with their missionary, bohemian parents John and Arlyn Bottom.\n\nAfter joining a religious group, which some may have considered a cult, the Bottoms changed their last name to, “Phoenix,” and supported themselves by singing and performing in the street for tourist and locals.\n\nAfter relocating to Los Angeles in the late 1970’s, the Phoenixes consulted agents and got their children auditions and appearances on TV commercials and TV shows.\n\nUltimately, it was River and Joaquin who made careers out of acting until River tragically died of a drug overdose in 1993.\n\nThe struggle to succeed on his own terms, and in his own signature artistic manner, empowered Joaquin to act in independent and small-scale films, even though he also appeared in blockbusters.\n\nMost people know that Joaquin played the villain in the 2000 blockbuster film Gladiator.\n\nHowever, most may not remember the small, independent film Quills, about the Marquis De Sade, which was also released in 2000. Joaquin reportedly earned $375,000 for his role in Quills.\n\nHe was nominated for a best actor Oscar for his portrayal of Johnny Cash in the 2005 film Walk The Line, which he reportedly earned $3.5 million.\n\nSince then, he has appeared in multiple, critically acclaimed independent films with modest, or disappointing, box office returns.\n\nLike Her, The Master, Inherent Vice, and The Sisters Brothers.\n\nPhilanthropy and Road to Success\n\nJoaquin is a philanthropist and supports many humanitarian causes. He is a vegan and ardent animal rights supporter.\n\nJoaquin is also a sponsor and board director for the Lunchbox Fund, which provides meals to disadvantaged children in South Africa. He has also been a spokesman for PETA.\n\nWhile it’s obvious his asking price will go up now that he has won an Oscar, its obvious that Joaquin values the art of making film on his own terms more than money.\n\nEven at the cost of working on smaller films at scale prices on the way to Oscar success.\n\nJoker is technically the most financially profitable superhero movie ever since it cost $62 million to make and profited over $1 billion. Still, Joaquin reportedly was only paid $4.5 million for the role.\n\nThis is not to persuade to feel sorry for him. Only to reiterate that to get what we want in life, especially on our own terms, sometimes you have to struggle and put on a happy face.\n\nThis is a truism that Joaquin probably dealt with all through his young life experiences.\n\nAlthough there are no official public financial records available, Joaquin Phoenix probably has a net worth in the range of $25 million to $50 million dollars.\n\nWhat is next for Joaquin Phoenix? Who knows? What we do know is that it will be an unpredictable move, it’ll be artistic, and it’ll be done on his terms.\n\nHe’s earned that right over a long career where he sacrificed big money, relative to Hollywood standards, to make the films that he wanted.\n\nWhile you may not become an iconoclastic, rebel actor, you could make career changes on your own terms if you make incremental and realistic plans.\n\nRead More\n\nWHO IS ASHTON MEEM AND WHAT IS HER NET WORTH?\n\nJILLIAN MICHAELS NET WORTH 2017"
