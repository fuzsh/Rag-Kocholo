        "text": "Raised in a controversial religious sect, uneducated, busking on street corners to support his family, breaking Hollywood only to overdose at just 23 years of age, River Phoenix's life reads like the American Dream gone wrong.\n\nThirty years after his infamous death outside an LA nightclub and the actor has been immortalised in time as a James Dean figure for a new generation, another soul lost to the '27 Club', so much potential never realised.\n\nUnlike Dean, whose end came during a car accident while indulging his hobby of motor racing, River died in circumstances that feel infinitely more preventable making his death all the more bitter to swallow.\n\nOn his birthday this past August, his mother Arlyn paid tribute to him writing: 'I count it one of the greatest blessings by living in the moment and drawing upon inner knowing as a sacred pathway to navigate through life's many challenges.\n\n'River's life and death taught me that, in no uncertain terms. I am in awe of the fact that he is very much alive in me.'\n\nOn the anniversary of his death, it's fitting to mark that life that meant so much to so many:\n\nEarly life and family\n\nRiver arrived into the world on 23 August 1970 to parents he later described as 'hippieish'. His mother Arlyn Dunetz who goes by the name 'Heart Phoenix' was a second-generation immigrant whose parents emigrated to the US from Hungary and Russia.\n\nHis father John Lee Bottom hails from California. The pair met in 1968 when Arlyn was hitchhiking in California while touring the US.\n\nA year later they tied the knot. When their firstborn arrived, they named him River after the river of life in the Herman Hesse novel Siddhartha. His middle name Jude was inspired by The Beatles hit Hey Jude.\n\nFour more siblings soon arrived, his sister Rain in 1972, Oscar-winning actor Jocquin in 1974, sisters Liberty was next in 1976, and Summer in 1978.\n\nUpbringing\n\nDespite being able to read and write, River was wholly uneducated making his rise to fame all the more impressive.\n\n'He was totally, totally without education. I mean, he could read and write, he had an appetite for it, but he had no deep roots into any kind of sense of history or literature,' screenwriter Naomi Foner once apparently remarked.\n\nHis family moved constantly during his formative years and often found themselves in what he later called a 'desperate situation' that would result in him playing the guitar on street corners while his siblings sang for spare change.\n\nChildren of God\n\nWhen the future star was three years old his parents fell under the sway of the religious organisation the Children of God and would eventually move the family to Venezuela, Mexico and Puerto Rico to spread the word of the sect.\n\nThe widely criticised Christian organisation which has since seen four evolutions, was founded by David Berg who originated the belief that sex without boundaries was a form of love.\n\nIn its heyday Children of God had over 15,000 members in 70 countries but has since become synonymous with allegations of abuse and in particular the abuse of children.\n\nRiver never spoke of his time there aside from a shocking admission to Details magazine that he lost his virginity at four years old to other children but had blocked out the trauma.\n\nHis mother was less forgiving and is quoted as saying: 'They're disgusting people. They're ruining people's lives. '\n\nHollywood beckons\n\nAfter moving back to the US, River and his siblings were spotted singing for their supper on a street corner by talent scout Iris Burton.\n\nA string of commercials led to the family being signed on the books of Paramount Pictures. Bit parts in a host of TV shows and movies were well received but it would be 1986's Stand By Me that would make him a household name.\n\nAs the decade wound to a close, his star was on the ascent with parts in Indiana Jones and Running on Empty and modelling campaigns with GAP.\n\nCelebrity\n\nDespite his success, River never felt at home in the spotlight and according to his mother craved anonymity. 'He became more and more uncomfortable being the poster boy for all good things. He often said he wished he could just be anonymous. But he never was.'\n\n'When he wasn't a movie star, he was a missionary. There's a beauty in that -the man with the cause , the leader - but there's also a deep loneliness,' she told Esquire.\n\nRelationships\n\nRiver's first public relationship was with The Goonies actress Martha Plimpton whom he met while filming The Mosquito Coast in 1986.\n\nThey remained together for three years and while the actress has largely refused to speak about their time together, she has indicated that it was his drug taking that eventually caused her to walk away from their relationship. The actress had an abortion shortly after their split but has never revealed who the father of her baby is.\n\nHe is also rumoured to have dated Susanne Solgot before beginning a relationship with Samantha Mathis. They met in a nightclub before going on to star in a Thing Called Love and she recalls that there were sparks right away between them.\n\n'This sounds incredibly cheesy but I know I would be with him one day, it just felt fated between us, and there was such chemistry,' she told The Guardian. It's somewhat fitting, if utterly heartbreaking that it was Samantha who was with him the day he died.\n\nDeath\n\nSamantha had a bad feeling that Halloween night in 1993 when they went with River's sister Rain and brother Joaquin to Johnny Depp's nightclub The Viper Room. The plan had been to just drop off his siblings she says but 'when we arrived he said to me: \"Oh, there are some people playing music tonight in the club who want me to play with them - that's okay right?\"\n\nIt's been claimed by his friend Bob Forrest that River had spent the previous days on a major drugs binge with the The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and either way, there were warning signs that something was off that night.\n\n'I knew something was wrong that night, something I didn't understand. I didn't see anyone doing drugs but he was high in a way that made me feel uncomfortable -I was in way over my head. 45 minutes later he was dead,' Samantha said.\n\nWhen she returned from the bathroom, River was fighting with another man and they were quickly escorted from the club.\n\nOnce outside he dropped to the pavement and started convulsing. In the pre-mobile phone age, Samantha desperately tried to get back into the club to get help but had to run around the building to the main door. She found Joaquin who phoned for an ambulance - a call that was immediately flagged to the media and in which he can be heard sobbing for help.\n\nBy the time paramedics arrived, it was too late to save River and he died in hospital after ingesting a speedball (a mix of heroin and cocaine), another legend lost even as the memory of him lives on."
