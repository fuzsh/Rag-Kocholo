        "text": "October 15, 2013\n\nIt wasn't all in my head!\n\nWhile they were sleeping, River had died on the Sunset Strip. The world had changed overnight.\n\nA long, time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away (also known as high school), a friend introduced me to a movie titled Dogfight, about a group of young military men who have a contest to see who can bring the ugliest date. No, this was not like Dinner for Schmucks. My friend and I watched that movie several times at her house, and then I never saw it again. Over the years, I've mentioned it to a few people, who hadn't heard of it. I tried checking Netflix and Amazon and other services which stream movies for me and it was nowhere to be found. My husband thinks I'm crazy when I talk about this movie which \"doesn't exist.\"\n\nI was MOTHER EFFING right that this was an actual movie (one which only made less than 400k and wasn't widely released), and I just found out that River Phoenix was in it! Thank you to this book I read for restoring my sanity!\n\nAnyway, random story aside, let's go back to River himself. One of my male friends hates it when males are called beautiful, but every single time I see River, the word pops into my head (along with other, less fortunate words). Let me show you what I mean...\n\nOnce, when River was eighteen, somebody asked him if he had had a happy childhood. \"Happy?\" he replied, as if the idea had never occurred to him. \"Well, it was interesting.\"\n\n\"River was the most beautiful child you've ever seen.\"\n\nHe had no social skills.\n\nWhen you're fifteen, to have to think of yourself as a prophet is unfair.\n\nRiver smiled sweetly at his tormentors and told them, \"If you want to kick my ass, go ahead. Just explain to me why you're doing it.\"\n\nAfter a confused pause, one of the skinheads said, \"Ah, you wouldn't be worth it.\"\n\n\"We're all worth it, man,\" River said with a beatific smile. \"We're all worth millions of planets and stars and galaxies and universes.\"\n\nThis is a tale of more than just young Hollywood. You might be interested in the details of how actors such as Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, the two Coreys (and I laughed at how badly they were portrayed for being aholes), etc. came to be, which are in here, intertwined with River's story.\n\nI was here for River though. The recounting of his heartbreaking childhood and following awkward teen years tugged at my heart. This young man who was so uncomfortable in his own skin, he had a story that the world would have wanted to hear. It is sad to see all the potential in the world shut down in the blink of an eye.\n\nHe was a soft-hearted vegan who wanted to change the world. Instead, he is remembered as the person who overdosed on a street outside of a club on the Sunset Strip and died. The details of how he got to that point were subtly blurred in favor of showcasing the person he was instead. I liked that. In fact, I wanted more of the secret River.\n\nRarely, do biographies manage to come across as anything but cold and observing. Because there were dashes of dark sarcasm and snippets of River's musings, I felt like I was dropped into his life and wanted to stay just a little while longer than I was allowed to.\n\nRiver was one of my first childhood crushes and he's been one of the few which I've wondered about from time to time. What we he look like today if he were alive? Would he be successful, or would he have walked away from the business which he wasn't sure he even wanted to be a part of? Would he have continued on the path where he followed his love of music? It's sad that we'll never know what was to be.\n\nAll in all, it was a beautiful recount of the life of a beautiful young man.\n\nThis book provided from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. All quotes taken from the pre-published copy and may be altered or omitted from the final version.\n\nYou can also find my review on Booklikes\n\nNovember 1, 2017\n\nI enjoyed listening to this biography of River Phoenix. I was in the mood for something different, and LAST NIGHT AT THE VIPER ROOM fit the bill perfectly. This book was released just a few days shy of the 20th anniversary of his death. A night out at a club. Drugs. A bad decision. A promising young actor dead at age 23.\n\nThis was more than just a recap of what happened on October 31, 1993. It spans River’s life from his unconventional childhood in South America (his hippie parents were members of a cult) to his rise to stardom and beyond. Learning about what went on during River’s childhood was surprising. I can see how his experiences shaped the troubled young man he became. The book also talks a lot about “Young Hollywood” at the time, which included Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Keanu Reeves, and Winona Ryder. Hearing about what the other actors were doing helped put River’s career in perspective.\n\nThe audiobook was performed by Luke Daniels, and overall I was pleased with his narration. He had a strong, interesting voice and good pacing. When quoting people he would change his voice, and most of his impressions were spot on (at least for the people I’m familiar with).\n\nLAST NIGHT AT THE VIPER ROOM is a well-written story of a life cut short. It didn’t glamorize drug abuse at all – it told it like it was. Sad. The author also poses “what if” questions and the possible answers which were very interesting to think about. This book might appeal to film buffs and and fans of Gen X biographies.\n\nOctober 27, 2013\n\nLast Night in the Viper Room: River Phoenix and the Hollywood He Left Behind by Gavin Edwards is a Harper Collins Publication and was released in October 2013. I received a copy of this book from the publisher and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.\n\nIF THE SKY THAT WE LOOK UPON SHOULD TUMBLE AND FALL\n\n\"Chris Chambers was the leader of our gang, and my best friend. He came from a bad family, and everybody knew he'd turn out bad- including Chris.\"\n\nThat was Richard Dreyfuss, narrating as the adult Gordie Lachance, described the character in Stand by Me that made River Phoenix a star.\n\nLast Night at the Viper Room is the story of River Phoenix. His unconventional upbringing, his real passion for music, and then fame and fortune, and death at the age of 23.\n\nRiver was actually his given name. His parents were in a hippie religious cult and their kids were totally cut off from society as most people knew it. River was eight years old and still had never attended school. He never did really attend a regular school. He didn't watch television or have the experiences most of us have growing up. He adhered to his parent's strict vegan diet and was an animal rights activist.\n\nMusic was always River's first love and passion. Acting came along and he didn't take it all that seriously at first. He was his family's bread winner and acting was just a means to an end.\n\nRiver always had a band going and had even carried his guitar with him to the Viper Room the night he died.\n\nAs his acting skills developed and he became more famous, it went without saying that River was heading for big things in his acting career. He really did have a natural ability as an actor. At the time of his death he was just on the cusp of really breaking loose.\n\nBut, the more money he made and the more people in the entertainment business he rubbed elbows with, the more access to drugs became available. River had maintained his clean living lifestyle up to a point. Once he started using drugs he had no control over his indulgence.\n\nThe Viper Room was a famous club on Sunset. It had weathered many changes over the years. The actor, Johnny Depp had a part ownership in the club and basically used it as a VIP club for all his famous friends. The place had a reputation for always having a full house. On any given night you could find Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, or Timothy Leary, or members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, models, actresses, and other entertainment personalities.\n\nOn the night in question, River was out with his brother and sister. He was given a drink by a guitarist friend and he swallowed in one gulp. He overdosed on a what is known as a speedball, the same deadly combination of cocaine and heroin that killed comedian John Belushi.\n\nThe story is a old one. Young, rich, and independent. The moneymaker for the family, and too many people looking the other way. I don't know if his upbringing or the people he knew through fame and acting were to blame for his downfall into drugs. The shocking allegations regarding the cult his parents were members of would be enough to cause severe damage in anyone. His isolation from society and constant relocation would also make it hard for someone to fit in. Having no real parental supervision, River stayed with other families, looked for a father figure on every job, and longed to be a part of something. Once people surrounding him began to suspect he had a real substance abuse problem, no one wanted to approach him about it, not even his own mother, who appeared more interested in being his manager than his parent.\n\nThe night he died, people kept saying someone should call 911. But, they were all assured River was alright, while he was have seizures every twenty seconds and banging his head against the pavement.\n\nThis young, beautiful man was just so incredibly talented and had so much promise. Despite his lack of formal education, he was so smart and caught onto things that others couldn't comprehend. Deep down in his soul, he was a good person or wanted to be. His thoughtfulness shone through even when he was out of his mind on drugs.\n\nAnytime I finish reading a book like this, I'm left feeling not only sad, but angry and frustrated. This was a person that people should have been watching. Someone that should never have fallen through the cracks. But, no one had the courage to step up to the plate. Yes, it is said that there were some attempts at interventions, but no one really took those hard steps that you have to with a drug addict, and on the night he died, people basically stood around and watched him die, more worried about saving his reputation as an actor than saving his life.\n\nThe layout the author used to tell the story was really unique. I liked that fact that we went chronologically through River's life. It's just easier to see how things evolved that way. But, it was also interesting that the author set the stage for each chapter in River's life by reminding us of what was happening in that time in Hollywood with other young actors. Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Leonardo DiCaprio, Keanu Reeves, and Iona Skye. Also, the music scene was explained since River was often playing music and had a group he played with, and he was friends with Michael Stipe and Flea from The Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nRiver's association with Johnny Depp was minor and the two didn't know each other all that well. The media played up Depp's association with the club when River died on the scene.\n\nThe author did fine job of telling this story. Again, it is always important when you take it upon yourself to write this kind of book, to not only do the research and interviews etc. But, also to keep yourself from leaning toward a certain view point. The author kept his own personal viewpoint out of the book and told the story of this young man's tragic life as it should be told.\n\nA very compelling read, and one I recommend to all who like performance arts books, non- fiction, biographies, or are a fan of this era of entertainment or if you would just like to remember River Phoenix.\n\nOverall this one is an A.\n\nFebruary 6, 2014\n\nHave you ever got a book knowing fully that not only will you probably dislike it but it'll probably infuriate and upset you a bit, but you had to get it anyway because you're curious and weirdly interested in the subject matter? And then when that book made you madder than even you thought it would, you just want to scream but you know that you did it all to yourself?\n\nYeah, this was me with this book.\n\nSome background.\n\nWhen I was about 10, my mum made me watch Stand By Me. It's one of her favourite films and it became one of mine. To this day, it's in my top 20 favourite films of all time. It's a perfect film. Like most people who saw it, I became rather interested in River Phoenix, although as I got older the focus changed more to his brother, who remains probably my favourite actor (and teen crush - shut up). They're an interesting family & of course, one with very tragic elements. So of course River Phoenix's very short life was ripe for a biography.\n\nThis one, however, is kind of reprehensible.\n\nFirst, from a stylistic point of view, the author has some issues. His attempt to create a cultural context surrounding Phoenix's brief time in the spotlight falls flat since he seems to have no idea how to organically integrate it into the narrative. A pretty linear biography is interspersed with tidbits on the Viper Room (the club where he died) and general information on other rising stars in the film industry at the time. Basically an actor is named, their projects at the time and then another is mentioned. This is repeated over and over again and feels lazy. If you want to read a non-fiction book where context is organically and substantially given for a time period, read Nixonland.\n\nSecond, and the biggest issue with the book, is the general tone of it all. It's one thing to offer a comment on a stranger's life; it's quite another to delve into unqualified pseudo psychiatric analysis that makes Dr Drew look dignified. E! News would offer less callous material. The author is pretty openly judgemental about the Phoenix family's life (which is pretty odd to say the least but if you're going to judge then at least develop the context further. The author's offerings feel rushed and lacking in anything really substantial that hasn't been written before. Wikipedia feels like the main source here aside from anonymous sources.)\n\nI understand the urge to seek answers from a tragedy. It's a natural human instinct. We see it every day in our lives and in the media. Right now it's going on with the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman (an actor I basically worshipped and cried over a lot when I heard the news). Honestly, I get that.\n\nI get why non-addicts try to understand the minds of addicts and I even sympathise somewhat when they struggle to understand because it's a tough situation. Addiction is an illness, one that requires us to not judge and to not sneer. We can't laugh or roll our eyes and claim they should have just never taken drugs or should have just stopped. It doesn't work like that. We can't turn it into a blame game.\n\nWe certainly don't spend 200+ pages insinuating that someone's family are to blame for their death.\n\nThe author clearly doesn't like Phoenix's family, but to lay the blame at their feet (mostly at those of his parents and brother) is low. National Enquirer low. Then, to rub salt in the wound, the author theorises that Joaquin Phoenix's career success and \"weirdness\" is the result of his brother dying and his guilt over that. I honestly couldn't believe what I read. It's coded but it's there. If you've ever heard the 911 call Joaquin Phoenix made on the night of his brother's death, you'd know it's one of the most upsetting things ever, and the media released that in the aftermath of River's death.\n\nThe total lack of basic decency on display here makes me wonder what the author was thinking when he began to write this insensitive & exploitative mess (actually I know exactly what he was thinking. \"Hey, I could churn out something in time for the 20th anniversary of his death! I'm a genius!\")\n\nMaybe I'm just especially sensitive right now because of Philip Seymour Hoffman or because I'm a big fan of the people at the centre of it, but this was a waste of my time and I only really have myself to blame. Don't waste your time with this. Go watch Stand By Me and My Own Private Idaho instead.\n\nDecember 12, 2013\n\nThis book just leaves me sad...and a bit angry. I don't think anyone can deny that River Phoenix was incredibly talented. He seemed to be a gentle soul but troubled.\n\nThis is definitely a cautionary tale about the risks of making your child the breadwinner for the family. I came away angry with his parents. I get that they were hippies, I get that they were very earth conscious and new age-y but for crying out loud...get a job, support your children, don't let your laziness, your beliefs leave them unprepared for the world that they will eventually have to inhabit.\n\nI found it so incredibly sad to read that because of the choices his parents made River was unprepared to even understand humour in joke form.\n\nI liked that the book gave snippets of what other actors of his generation were doing at any given time in Phoenix's life. It gave context to and a contrast with what he was experiencing.\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\n'I don't think anybody's necessarily ready for death' Depp reflected 'you can only hope that when it approaches, you feel like you've said all wanted you wanted to say. Nobody wants to go out mid-sentence'\n\nSadly, we know many people do.\n\nGoing into this I didn't know an awful lot about River. He is in Stand By Me, a film I love, and his ending was tragic. That was all I knew therefore this book was fascinating for me and I learnt a lot.\n\nI didn't realise the significance of the Viper Room or that Johnny Depp owned it. I didn't know about the friendship between Keanu Reeves and River. I didn't know River was born River Bottom, born into the Children of God cult and never went to school.\n\nLike many who die young River fitted a ton into his short life and I enjoyed reading about it while hoping for the impossible, a different ending.\n\nI liked how the book would focus in on River for a few chapters then focus out onto Keanu Reeves, Johnny Deep. Christian Slater and Leonardo DiCaprio to put into context what was also happening in Hollywood at the same time.\n\nAn extraordinary life, an extraordinary family, full of light and corners darker than we will ever know. A complicated and contradictory mind. A human, fully flawed and full of love.\n\nFour stars.\n\nAt the time of posting this book is available on Kindle Unlimited.\n\nJanuary 5, 2015\n\nThis book made me angry. There were so many people who could have lent a talented but struggling young man a hand, but chose not to do so. There were parents who could have decided to be parents, instead of selfishly using their eldest child for profit. There were friends and co-workers who didn't step up when they saw a young star floundering. While the addict also deserves blame, in this case a tragedy really seemed preventable. The result was the death of River Phoenix, one of the most interesting and promising actors of his generation.\n\nLast Night at the Viper Room compiles widely known anecdotes and events in River's life with interviews, a few lesser-known details and some conjecture. It focuses mainly on River and his family, but also provides Hollywood context. There is commentary on the career and personal choices of other male actors who were coming of age at the same time. There is some discussion of Hollywood politics, on-set happenings and the cultural shift taking place in entertainment in the early 1990s. There's nothing here that's really new or groundbreaking, but compiled in one story it creates a fairly good sense of the world in which River was living. Taken all together, it's a compelling tale.\n\nI arrived in Hollywood two years after River Phoenix died and spent time with several of the people mentioned in this book. This is a world I know fairly well. I realize that it's too easy to blame Hollywood, too easy to blame friends and family, and that addiction, sexual abuse and fame are complex issues. It's just tragic that this young man, whose life had so much to offer all of us, is now just a cautionary tale. His death could have been avoided. He could have been so much more.\n\nApril 12, 2017\n\nYou would think after all these years I could read this and not get sad. Wrong. How can you not be sad over a life gone way too soon? What did I learned mostly from this book, was, That River had a kind and gentle soul and even with his drug use that did not go away. You can't help but wonder where he would be right now if he was still alive. You can't help but to want that.\n\nNovember 3, 2013\n\nI graduated high school in 1993. The people, the clothes, the music, the vibe of that time is the first one I truly understood and lived. I found this book very interesting and I particularly liked how the author framed each part of River's life within the context of other actors/musicians etc. It set the scene pretty perfectly, I think. I remember the tragic death of River Phoenix and was enlightened to learn much more about his family and upbringing. I know that many didn't believe him to be a drug addict at the time due to his much publicized vegan lifestyle. I think this is why his death proved so shocking in 1993 to much of the world. Had he grown up now with the social media presence unavoidable, I think we might have just found his death tragic, but not surprising.\n\nSeptember 10, 2013\n\n(nb: I received an Advance Review Copy of this book from the publisher via Edelweiss)\n\nI remember watching the news on October 31, 1993. I didn’t usually watch the evening news—I was always either working or at happy hour—but this was a Sunday, so I was probably doing laundry and nursing a hangover.\n\nI remember watching the news on October 31, 1993 only because the anchor reported that both River Phoenix and Federico Fellini had died. It seemed oddly fitting that two such bookending film personae died the same day.\n\nFellini was 73, and he’d enjoyed a long, celebrated career, winning five Oscars and creating a style so unique, it spawned its own adjective: Felliniesque.\n\nRiver Phoenix, though. My God, I thought, he was only 23. He had obvious talent, although most of his films didn’t show it, and he could have been one of the greats, if only…\n\nGavin Edwards’s “Last Night at The Viper Room” fills in the “if only” in one of the best biographies I’ve read this year.\n\nIn his day, River Phoenix was portrayed as “The Vegan James Dean,” and there was something Dean-like about him. Back in the late 1980’s and early 90’s, his story was fairly well-known. His parents were hippies who moved to South America as part of some weird cult, and they named their kids things like River, Liberty, Rain, etc. Also, River was a big environmental activist, plus a vegan and animal rights supporter. He spoke out against drug use, and seemed like a nice—if quirky—kid.\n\nThe drinking was first. Then came the drugs: weed, at first, then cocaine, then heroin. Between his breakout in 1986’s “Stand By Me” and his OD just seven years later, River Phoenix spiraled hard into substance abuse. His appearance changed. The once strong, handsome young star showed up for auditions with his skin looking almost gray. His clothes were dirty and worn. Some of his last performances were almost unintelligible. His reputation in Hollywood was tarnished; he had trouble finding good films. Finally, he collapsed and died outside The Viper Room.\n\n“Last Night at The Viper Room” charts River’s short life, from his birth to nomadic hippie parents all the way to the bitter end.\n\nThat’s what biographies do, but the wonder of “Last Night at The Viper Room” is that it does more than provide a truckload of facts. Author Gavin Edwards shows remarkable verve and style, taking this book far beyond the dry tedium of many biographies. Edwards wrote extensively for “Details” and “Rolling Stone” magazines, and his style here shows much of the hip, rock & roll journalism pacing one finds in a good, extended magazine piece.\n\nI was drawn-in to “Last Night at The Viper Room,” and before I knew it, I’d read it in one sitting. It is an addictive book.\n\nEdwards draws on dozens of sources and personal interviews for this work, and his documentation is fastidious. He portrays Phoenix’s life not only in a recitation of facts, but in anecdotal quotes from those who best knew the actor, those who worked with him, dated him, befriended him, loved him. In all of their stories, they express dismay at what they saw this talented young actor doing to himself.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a very sad book. River Phoenix had a short, tragic life. His family relied upon him to be the breadwinner. His Hollywood stardom was their golden ticket. River wasn’t always comfortable as an actor—he mainly just wanted to play his guitar and sing—but the money was too good. In some roles, he found a way to express himself through his art. Other times, he was just going through the motions.\n\nWhen he died, some people thought River Phoenix would be like James Dean, a handsome young star who died tragically young, but whose fame would live on forever through his work. That didn’t happen with River Phoenix. James Dean is still a legend; River Phoenix is an afterthought who died two decades ago.\n\nHis life is immortalized, though, in “Last Night at The Viper Room.” From birth to death, it’s all right here. Even just for the few hours it took me to read this book, Gavin Edwards brought him back, and once again made me wonder what River Phoenix could have been, if only…\n\nMost Highly Recommended\n\nOctober 23, 2018\n\n“It ends outside a nightclub called the Viper Room, on a Hollywood sidewalk. (...) It begins twenty-three years earlier, on a peppermint farm. (...) Between applause and agony, (...) between peppermint and heroin, there hangs a life: the twenty-three years of River Phoenix.”\n\nIt's been a while since a book captivated, angered and saddened me this much. What a beautiful, radiant soul he was 💔\n\nOctober 11, 2013\n\nI was madly in love with River. He was dreamy, talented & passionate. A little bit of me died with him, I think. So young, so tragic with his little brother at his side, so sad. After reading about his upbring & the pressure put on him to provide for the family, it is no wonder that gorgeous and promising young man turned to drugs.\n\nJanuary 21, 2014\n\nAfter reading this beautiful book, I sobbed like a baby. I couldn't control how overwhelmed I was by my emotions when it was all over.\n\nAnd for days after I'd go through my normal routine with this aching empty feeling and every day I would realize that it was because of this book. I felt this awful feeling because I felt like I had lost my best friend after finishing this book. I felt that I had gotten to know River Phoenix so well through this book that his death, twenty years later, had touched me on such a personal level I felt it breaking my heart over and over.\n\nThis book is a work of art. It not only delves into River Phoenix's life, but into the lives of others who were starting out at the same time (Leonardo DiCaprio and Keanu Reeves, for example) and the world they were all growing up in. I highly recommend that everyone read it.\n\nMay 17, 2016\n\nInteresting, sometimes amusing, well written (or well-enough written), and well researched (even if a lot of the research comes from other people's books). Like a lot of people, I was shocked when River Phoenix died of an overdose--he seemed like the last person in Hollywood who would succumb to this fate. The book, on the other hand, makes this fate seem almost inevitable, which is actually one of its strengths. Of course, at the end, this doesn't stop you from desperately wishing you could reach into the book and change just one detail that might have made a difference. An absorbing portrait of a person who was more complicated than most of us knew.\n\nDecember 13, 2021\n\nRiver Phoenix is forever a striking 23-year-old with unrealized potential after the teen idol died of a tragic overdose outside a West Hollywood club.\n\nI was just a kid when River Phoenix died but I was aware of the collective shock from his death. He was a star on the rise --- a child actor about to truly break out as leading man --- and with his abrupt end came all the sadness of wondering what could’ve been, cementing his brief legacy.\n\nLast Night at the Viper Room is an interesting in-depth look at River’s life: the unconventional childhood, his family’s time in the Children of God cult, the film roles he began to select for himself, his drug habits and its effect in his personal and professional life.\n\nI learned a lot about the actor and enjoyed the overall examination of 90s American culture and River’s impact on it.\n\nFor more reviews, visit www.rootsandreads.wordpress.com\n\nAugust 14, 2022\n\nSad of course, but also as entertaining as a train wreck. Not sure about the roots of River's problems, but was disturbed by someone's observation that most actors are on drugs. It's sad to think how little support these young actors received: they get big pay cheques, but no counseling on how to handle difficult roles and maintain healthy boundaries. Perhaps the train wreck is all just part of the big entertainment package of Hollywood.\n\nA fast read, and Edwards's pop culture observations can sometimes be a little sweeping or glib. Same sex attraction or kissing are still taboo in an actor's career, apparently, and I had to check when this book was published. Years after daytime soap operas all had their first gay kisses, so it seems that this writer's fingers are not on that particular pulse.\n\nDecember 28, 2021\n\nI was a huge fan after watching Stand By Me. He became one of the most intriguing figures in Hollywood. River was a clever boy but undereducated. Living with his hippie parents, he had to beg for money at a very young age. His affiliation with Children of God cult might contributed to his latter depressions. Too many eerie detailed moments before his death, like when Johnny Depp's band P playing a song mentioning River Phoenix, he was just outside the club having seizures.\n\nA recommended read if you want to learn about Hollywood pop culture in the 80s-90s.\n\nOctober 23, 2018\n\nI was 11 days shy of 7 years old when River Phoenix died, but it wasn't until I was 12 going on 13 that I fell in love with him. His was the voice that told me through a movie screen \"you could be a real writer someday,\" words that I took to heart then and still do today. He'd been gone for nearly 6 years then. Now it's been almost 6 years since I surpassed the age he died at. Today, he would be 45 years old. Would he have cut a career path that Leonardo DiCaprio would be jealous of, like he was supposed to? Would he be a living tragedy instead of a dead one, sacrificing talent and potential for addictions he still can't shake? Or would he have saved the world by now?\n\nWe'll never know. But, after reading this book, at least we know a little more about the 23 years he got to have. This is such a sad, infuriating book. That poor boy was failed again and again, from the time he was born until the night he died. No one had the spine to protect him, not once, and I don't even know what to do with the rage that that gives me. From letting him be molested for 7 years, to saddling him with the responsibility of being the sole breadwinner from age 5 on, all the way to the fact that no one called 911 on the night he overdosed at 23 because they didn't want to attract bad press, his loved ones let him down over and over, and I am livid. River Phoenix, with all his infinite potential, grace, and kindness, never had a chance. I am no longer shocked that he died.\n\nGavin Edwards' writing was lovely. I don't have much experience with biographies, so I don't know if they're typically written with this much heartache and respect, but I was happy with the way he handled this story. He didn't sensationalize anything, nor did he turn River into a martyr or the people in his life into villains. He just gave us the facts and let us make up our own opinions, and snuck in a couple of heartbreaking lines every now and then to punch you in the stomach. I couldn't believe how well researched this was -- he even had quotes from the man who owned the farm that River was born on in 1970. I loved how he gathered testimonials and memories from so, so many incredibly different people, so that we got such an incredible array of perspectives. These memories, from everyone from Johnny Depp to Ethan Hawke to Martha Plimpton to agents and cameramen and a girl who worked in a coffee shop, painted a complex, contradictory, and beautiful portrait of the boy they once knew. We learned about a boy who was admired and put on a pedestal, who was selfless and idealistic and naive, who was bratty and manic and impulsive, both loyal and disloyal, the model of clean living and an absolute mess, fiercely independent and wildly needy, who did it all to protect the family he loved so much and ultimately abandoned. This book made him more human, more of a 23 year old boy who sometimes did the wrong thing and could be kind of embarrassing and had so much growing up to do, instead of just this beautiful golden tragedy. He was that, too, certainly, but more than anything, what this book really wants you to know, is that there was so much more to River Phoenix than the beautiful thing he was and the broken thing he became. He was a sweet boy who was becoming a good man.\n\nMartha Plimpton said it best, just days after she lost him: \"He's become a metaphor for a fallen angel, a messiah. He was just a boy, a very good-hearted boy who was very fucked up and had no idea how to implement his good intentions. I don't want to be comforted by his death. I think it's right that I'm angry about it, angry at the people who helped him stay sick, and angry at River.\"\n\nBut his sister Rain said it perfectly too: \"We are infinitely collaborating in spirit.\"\n\nSeptember 24, 2015\n\nMy newest \"purse book\".\n\n\"Last Night at the Viper Room\" is a fairly salacious title for what is really a full biography of River Phoenix interspersed with interludes on the other things going on in the Hollywood scene at the time which offer a good perspective on where River fits into his time period (one of the authors big, and fair, questions...would River have been as big as Leonardo DiCaprio?). The author makes the point that River only made four really good movies (Dogfight, Running on Empty, My Own Private Idaho, Stand by Me) and of those three only one is considered a real \"classic\" (and he was a child in that one), so, really, is River primarily famous because of his odd upbringing and his death?\n\nThe book was interesting, but was a LOT of River for someone who was only a casual fan. However, for a huge fan of either that particular era of movie making or of River himself it's a must-read.\n\nMarch 1, 2014\n\nOverall not impressed.....not that I mean Phoenix's interesting yet sad life, but Gavin Edward's take on River Phoenix himself. The bio was very disjointed and tended to skip from Phoenix to other actors at really odd times, not to mention that as a reader it felt distant. Nothing here was actually personal, I think it was just some mushed up facts about an actor who's info is already out there in random places.\n\nObviously the man cannot write his own bio.......but perhaps had the story come from say a sibling or someone super close to him it would have made for a more authentic read.\n\nJune 17, 2021\n\n\"I don't think anybody's necessarily ready for death. You can only hope that when it approaches, you feel like you've said what you wanted to say. Nobody wants to go out in mid-sentence.\" - Johnny Depp\n\nIn the 1990s, along with Dex and Lacey in Girls on Fire by Robin Wasserman, River Phoenix had my besotted heart somewhere between Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho. So when I came across Last Night at the Viper Room I had to read it. And the reading hurt. Not so much remembering my teenage infatuation, but remembering those I've lost and the drugs that did it. Remembering the first time I watched Drugstore Cowboy and what we went on to do.\n\nSo here's a funny story about teenage me. That last page in the photo section looks a lot like what spent many years on my bedroom wall. I might still have it in a drawer somewhere. I know the exact spot the Who Weekly announcing Kurt Cobain's death is secreted. I want to add, these memories haven't been perused since the 1990s, but I'm pretty sure I'll never throw them out.\n\nThe hilarious story of how River's brooding headshot ended up in my possession is an example of just how uncool my teenage years were. My little brother & I visited our Sydney cousin in January 1992. They were both 2 years younger than me. In hindsight, I guess she looked up to me, slightly, but back then I knew she had everything on me. Not least because I never read magazines. Wtf young Clare - the things you missed!? So cousin Lucy educated me as to the lastest pop stars, movie gods, assorted hotties, (omg) E-Street. And told me I had to pick a hottie to be my fav. No idea why I chose River Pheonix, maybe it was fate.\n\nLucy and I wrote letters to each other (what are they?) I probably still have them too in some drawer. One such letter included an enclosure of an entensive article on River, with extensive headshots. One was an A3 folded monstrosity that landed above my bed. Oh River, sweet dreams River. (Cross my heart, I never kissed him goodnight, not much anyway)\n\nAnd what, you may ask, was River Phoenix doing in January 1992? Now that Gavin Edwards has enlightened me, I can tell you: spiralling further into addiction.\n\n\"What would those twelve-year-old girls with a picture of me over their bed think if they knew?\"\n\nOh, I don't know, doing their own spiralling a few years later.\n\nWhen My Own Private Idaho came out, I was watching The Movie Show with my parents and David & Margaret argued about it, then I announced I had to see it. Parentals forbade me, \"Really Clare, you wouldn't enjoy it.\" I told them I was 15, so I was allowed to see it in the cinema. We'd just seen Dave & Marg explain how it got that rating - due to stills of Keanu and River having sex, rather than filmed sex, complete with said stills. I definitely wanted to see more of those stills...\n\nWhile I went to the movies with my Dad to see Sneakers (her phone number, please) I never did get to see My Own Private Idaho on the big screen, with Dad or otherwise. Luckily (sans Dad) I got to see Keanu ask \"Fuck me\" on the big screen (yes please). And don't worry, as an adult I own the DVD of My Own Private Idaho. I'm old school like that. Might have to break out the popcorn and my fav River Pheonix movie. Mum, Dad, you want to join?\n\n\"In my version... in my version, I pick him up\" - Gus Van Sant\n\nThis is from my blog https://ofceilingwax.wordpress.com/20...\n\nNovember 26, 2020\n\nI was drawn to River the first time I saw Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade when I was 6. He Capitivated me for those 11 minutes at the start of that film. As I grew up and dived head first into his short catalog, It was hard not to imagine what his career would of looked like in the 21st century when you see how great a career Leonardo DiCaprio has had in the years since his tragic passing. This book, page by page becomes sadder as we get nearer to the inevitable conclusion. This kid was full of demons from his weird beginnings so it's not too shocking to see why he might of wanted to escape.. I wish we could of seen what he could of become. As sad as this book is I kept reading hoping that he'd figure it all out. I rated this 5 stars because his life albeit short was as wild and exciting as those 11 minutes that capitivated a young six year old in 1993. Sadly, not knowing that he passed that same year.\n\nMarch 22, 2020\n\nAs a fan of River Phoenix this was a bit disappointing.\n\nI liked the parallel of River's life set against the background of young Hollywood at the time, somehow it gives you an idea of where his career might have gone.\n\nBut the author pulls the focus off River too much and concentrates on other actors/musicians/a bunch of unnecessary stuffs (at some point I wasn't sure if I was reading Phoenix's or Johnny Depp's biography) and, ultimately, it just felt like a mediocre mash up facts that one can easily found out on a Wikipedia page.\n\nSeptember 2, 2023\n\nOnce upon a time (like a few years ago) I had this short-lived, albeit intense obsession with Keanu Reeves, which resulted in me attempting to go through his entire filmography. I failed, though… like I usually do.\n\nBut not necessarily because I lost my interest in Keanu’s (rocky) career, but rather because I discovered one of his co-stars (who most definitely overshadowed him) to fall in love with: none other than River Phoenix.\n\nAt that time I was not yet as enthusiastic about film as I am today and had little knowledge of Independent and Queer Cinema (I hadn’t even watched Brokeback Mountain back then *gasp*), thus my first time watching My Own Private Idaho was pretty… wild.\n\nNevertheless, the movie somehow spoke to me and I liked it right away, especially because of the relationship between River's and Keanu's characters… and their indisputable chemistry. Obviously, I’m forever crying over the Campfire Scene and the fact that Mike’s love for Scott was unrequited (somehow I always end up shipping the non-endgame stuff… I just like suffering, huh).\n\nKnowing now, that River himself (re)wrote that scene to make it more personal, intimate and authentic breaks my heart into a million pieces. Excuse me but I’ll need a minute.\n\nSince then, I’ve watched almost all of his movies (though I disliked most of them but always appreciated his astonishingly raw acting) and My Own Private Idaho is probably still his most profound and most convincing performance.\n\nBut I truly think he’s one of those once-in-a-generation talents that sadly never got a chance to shine as brightly as they would have deserved.\n\nLong story short. This novel was an interesting dive into the life and times of River Phoenix, an extraordinary and incredibly talented boy who literally had to take care of his whole family (financially and emotionally) and who never got to be a child.\n\nHe grew up in a sexually and psychologically abusive cult, was kept isolated from people his own age, wasn’t even taught how to read… Furthermore, he had to take responsibility for all the religious, activist and hippie BS his parents pulled and became the family’s main breadwinner by the age of ten.\n\nI also feel extremely sorry for Leaf/Joaquin Phoenix and his sisters cause it seems like River was the only remotely sane person in that household who took proper care of the children and I can’t imagine what it must feel like to lose that brother/father-figure at the age of nineteen.\n\nRiver Phoenix was ahead of his time. Being vegan, an animal activist and an environmentalist, caring only about the part he played rather than the money the movie made, who was ruthlessly used as a poster boy and a mouthpiece by his parents to convince the public of their religious ideas…\n\nMore than anything else, this book made me utterly sad and angry. Because somehow every single actor, producer, director, family member and friend claimed to have known about River's recurring issues as well as his drug addiction. So why did nobody f*ing help him then when it apparently was SO OBVIOUS???\n\nHe’s already being made into a martyr. He’s become a metaphor for a fallen angel, a messiah. He was just a boy, a very good-hearted boy who was very fucked up and had no idea how to implement his good intentions. I don’t want to be comforted by his death. I think it’s right that I’m angry about it, angry at the people who helped him stay sick, and angry at River.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy the way the author put together bits and pieces of interviews and articles. However, I was just as annoyed at how many times he tried to show off his pop culture knowledge, talking about stupid movie facts that literally had no relevance whatsoever, dropping names randomly and without context.\n\nHonestly, I don’t care what Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio were up to in the late 80s or what hair colour Winona Ryder had on September 1st 1989 (see what I did there). If I want to know more about this dude called Johnny Depp, I’m going to read a biography about him, not River Phoenix… ugh.\n\nNovember 10, 2020\n\n❐ Overall Rating 4½ | Narration 5\n\n❐ Biography of the rise and fall of River Phoenix\n\n❐ Drugs & Hollywood\n\n❐ The Viper Room\n\n❐ Tidbits to the other key actors in River Phoenix's orbit\n\nDid you know when River was born his family name was Bottom? His name was River Bottom.\n\nI found myself fully engaged in this...Luke Daniels did a phenomenal job with the narration. He can do a wide range of voices really well. Chronically his life from just before he was born up until his death at the age of 23 outside the infamous Viper Room. Filled with both humor and sadness plus little bits of information about the many actors and musicians that he worked with or might have worked with if he wasn't taken too soon.\n\nOne of my favorite movies of his, A Thing Called Love, is the one that did the worse at the box office. Sadly, I think the character he played in that movie was a little too close to what was happening in his real life and it was also his last completed movie.\n\n❐ Libby Listen through my Library\n\n❐ Length ➯ 8H 26M\n\n❐ Plot ➯ 4.3/5\n\n❐ History ➯ 4/5\n\n❐ The Feels ➯ 4.5/5\n\n❐ Realness ➯ 4/5\n\n❐ Ending ➯ 4.5/5\n\nJuly 6, 2015\n\nRiver Phoenix. What potential cut short by drugs. Reading this took me back to high school and college and the grim reminder that my friends and I had watched Sneakers the night he died and we woke up the next morning to find out he had died.\n\nThis book reads quick, almost like a really long magazine article and works to place Phoenix in line with other, still-living, celebrities who still pace about Hollywood. I enjoyed reading more about Phoenix and some of the ugly truths that were hidden from Tiger Beat and teen magazines. I think the most appropriate phrase to describe Phoenix in this book was that he was over-intelligent and under-educated. He had passion for the earth and was roped into acting by his family. He was an extremely troubled person but it made him a performer. I liked this book for the nostalgia throwback to the early 1990s. But, as I have said over and over, no matter how many times you read The Great Gatsby, Gatsby still dies at the end. Same goes for River Phoenix.\n\nDrugs are bad and they did him in and that's all you can really say. And the only person not named in this book? The guy who handed River Phoenix his deadly last speedball cocktail at the Viper Room.\n\nI recommend this easy read of a sad topic to anyone who wonders what River Phoenix means or meant in the great scheme of this world.\n\nJune 29, 2016\n\nVery enjoyable biography of River Phoenix, with lots of 80s/90s pop-culture references thrown in. Paints a picture of a very talented actor, but one continuously haunted by his unconventional upbringing and in no way prepared to handle Hollyweird and its druggy excess.\n\nAugust 24, 2020\n\nA minha nota é especialmente pelo jeito que a história é contada, não por ela em si obviamente.\n\nRiver sempre foi uma pessoa que me deixou fascinada: entender sua trajetória, sua infância, seus sonhos e tudo que acreditava me fez amar muito mais ele. Muito da sua vida, tudo que ele passou no The Children of God me deixou extremamente irritada, mal e enojada. Me doeu. Mas achei muito bonito como ele lidou com tudo, sempre buscando o melhor de si e tentando salvar o planeta e os outros, mesmo que tenha tomado decisões erradas no meio do caminho.\n\nO que me deixou meio entediada foi o tanto de adicional da narrativa: o autor queria contar sobre os outros atores e atrizes e, ao mesmo tempo que gostei muito e acrescentou para todo o entendimento de River (especialmente Ethan Hawke), também cansou muito por cenas desnecessárias, como por exemplo: pra quê eu preciso saber a fala de Brad Pitt em Thelma e Louise, sabe? Esse tipo de coisa. Isso fazia eu divagar muito durante a leitura, e torcia pra terminar logo. Talvez se eu fosse mais nova eu pudesse gostar mais do estilo do autor, mas hoje em dia só me deixou bem meh mesmo.\n\nRecomendo pra quem gostaria de saber (mais) sobre River e todo o Phoenix clã. Vale a pena."
