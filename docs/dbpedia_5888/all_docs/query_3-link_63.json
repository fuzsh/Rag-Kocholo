        "meta_description": "River Phoenix. Actor: My Private Idaho. River Phoenix was born River Jude Bottom in Madras, Oregon. His mother, Arlyn (Dunetz), a Bronx-born secretary, and his father, John Bottom, a carpenter, met in California in 1968. They worked as itinerant fruit pickers, and later joined the Children of God religious group (John was originally Catholic, while Arlyn was born Jewish). By the time River was two, they were living in South...",

        "text": "Was supposed to begin work on Neil Jordan's Interview mit einem Vampir (1994) two weeks after his death. He was to play Daniel Molloy, the interviewer, which then went to Christian Slater, who donated his entire $250,000 salary to two of Phoenix's favorite charitable organizations: Earth Save and Earth Trust. The film has a dedication to Phoenix after the end credits.\n\nIronically, despite his reputation for healthy living, Phoenix was a chain smoker. Peter Bogdanovich recalled, \"He'd say about meat, 'That's not good for you, man, that'll kill you.' And he'd be smoking a cigarette, and he'd look at it and say, 'I know, man, I know.'\"\n\nWas an involved environmentalist and bought up several hundred acres of rain forest in Costa Rica and Brazil, not to develop them, but to just keep them so they would not be cut down.\n\nPhoenix had a lazy left eye. This caused him to flutter and blink in order to center the iris. This action is visible in most of his performances. It is most apparent in 'Silent Tongue'(1994), in which he did not attempt to take charge of it at all; feeling that the quality added to the madness of his character.\n\nNominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work in Sidney Lumet's Die Flucht ins Ungewisse (1988), Phoenix lost out to Kevin Kline for his performance in Ein Fisch namens Wanda (1988). At the time of the Academy Awards ceremony in March, 1989, Kline and Phoenix were filming the movie Ich liebe Dich zu Tode (1990). Sitting in the audience, Phoenix applauded enthusiastically when his co-star's name was announced as the winner.\n\nJames Cameron has admitted that when he first started thinking about Titanic (1997) in the early nineties, he favored River for the lead. By the time the film was made, Leonardo DiCaprio was old enough to take the role.\n\nHarrison Ford personally recommended him for the part of the young Indy in Indiana Jones und der letzte Kreuzzug (1989) after working with him on Mosquito Coast (1986). Ford stated that of all the young actors who were working at the time, River was the one who looked the most like himself when he was that age.\n\nThe story is apocryphal that River's last words were supposedly (to the reporter trying to help him outside the Viper Room) were \"No paparazzi, I want anonymity\", although the quote has become something of an urban legend. In fact, according to witnesses (which included a nearby paparazzo), River stumbled out of the nightclub and fell hard, face-first, onto the sidewalk (experts believed he likely died at that moment) before spasming violently against the pavement for eight minutes, never having uttered a word.\n\nAnd while that photographer chose not to capture that moment on film, the day before Phoenix's cremation in Florida, a reporter broke into the funeral home, rearranged the body, and took a picture. This picture was later to be sold to the National Enquirer for $5,000.\n\nRiver recorded an album the summer before his death titled 'Never Odd or Even' (the title is a palindrome), which was released. A friend of his named Sasa Raphael (who worked with River on the album and played bass in River's band Blacksmith Configuration) almost succeeded in making the album available for free download on the Internet in the summer of 2000,on the anniversary of what would've been River's 30th birthday, but was later sued by the estate of River Phoenix for copyright reasons.\n\nPhoenix had signed onto the lead role in Broken Dreams, a screenplay written by John Boorman and Neil Jordan (to be directed by Boorman), and co-starring Winona Ryder. The film was put on hold due to Phoenix's death and has yet to be made.\n\nThe famous Brazilian singer and songwriter Milton Nascimento wrote a song called \"River Phoenix (Carta a Um Jovem Ator)\" (\"Letter to a Young Actor\" in English) in 1988. Milton was quite impressed with River's performances in Mosquito Coast (1986) and Stand by Me: Das Geheimnis eines Sommers (1986), and he decided to write a song in reverence of his talent. When he got to know about the song, he came to Brazil and spent some days in Milton Nascimento's country home. After that first contact, they became good friends. In the track \"Curi Curi\" (Tsaqu Wai√£pi) from Nascimento's album \"Txai\" that was released in 1990, River reads a speech written by him protesting the destruction of the Amazon and betrayal of its people.\n\nIs one of only a few actors who have played the son and the younger version of the same actor, by playing Harrison Ford's son and playing young Indiana Jones. A few others are Bruno Kirby, who played Richard S. Castellano's son on The Super (1972), and the young Clemenza in Der Pate 2 (1974). Logan Lerman played one of Mel Gibson's sons in Der Patriot (2000) and the younger Nick Marshall in Was Frauen wollen (2000)."
