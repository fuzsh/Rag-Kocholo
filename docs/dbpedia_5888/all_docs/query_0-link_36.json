        "text": "The Walt Disney Co.’s “Wish” had been expected to rule the Thanksgiving weekend box office, but moviegoers instead feasted on leftovers, as “The Hunger Games: Songbirds and Snakes” led ticket sales for the second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\nThis image released by Altitude shows, from left, Kosar Ali, Ruby Stokes and Bukky Bakray in a scene from \"Rocks.\" Much like previous Academy Awards controversies, last year's nominations by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts were denounced for their all-male directing nominees and all-white acting nominees, a backlash that spawned a #BaftasSoWhite hashtag. The British academy responded with a seven-month review. Also nominated are Lee Isaac Chung for the family drama “Minari” and Thomas Vinterberg for the Danish dark comedy “Another Round.”More films were nominated, too. ___AP's Hilary Fox contributed to this report from London___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nShe’s only the second woman in the history of the Globes to win, and the first since Barbra Streisand won for “Yentl” in 1984. Its star, guerilla comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, also won best actor in a comedy. “The Queen's Gambit” won best limited series, and best actress in the category for Anya Taylor-Joy. “Schitt's Creek,” the Pop TV series that found a wider audience on Netflix, won best comedy series for its final season. Catherine O'Hara also took best actress in a comedy series.\n\nThis combination photo shows, from left, Awkwafina, Cynthia Erivo, Joaquin Phoenix, Kristen Wiig and Renee Zellweger, who are among the first presenters announced for the Golden Globes awards ceremony. (AP Photo)LOS ANGELES – “Barb and Star” are headed to the Golden Globes — actors Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo will be among the presenters at the upcoming ceremony. Wiig and Mumolo's latest film, “Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar,” was released last week and some are already calling the campy film a cult classic. She’s won Golden Globes for her acting “Klute,” “Julia” and “Coming Home.”Norman Lear will be honored with the Carol Burnett Award, a counterpart to the DeMille Award that focuses on life achievement in television. Netflix dominated the nominations earlier this month, with its film “Mank” and its television series “The Crown” the leading nominees.\n\non Aug. 31, 2020, actor Chadwick Boseman in character as T'Challa in \"Black Panther\" and 10-year old twins Lenny, left, and Bobby Homes paying tribute to Boseman at their home in in Mesa, Ariz. on Aug. 31, 2020. (Takiyah Dupas, Marvel Studios, Annalie Homes via AP)And now, for our annual look at the year in pop culture…. Truth is, people turned to culture of all kinds in 2020 — highbrow and lowbrow — to satisfy varied and sometimes conflicting needs: Distraction, inspiration, consolation, escapism, hope. A Broadway star serenaded health workers from his apartment window, and ballet dancers performed “Swan Lake” from their bathtubs. The world mourns an actor of immense talent who, like many of his characters, radiated a regal sense of dignity.\n\nLONDON – Britain’s film academy is shaking up its membership and its awards voting rules in a review prompted by the glaring lack of diversity in the nominations. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts promised to change after contenders for the 2020 awards were announced last January. The measures include recruiting 1,000 new members from under-represented groups to join the current 6,700-strong voting academy of film-industry professionals. The academy has also changed the rules for the British Academy Film Awards, introducing a new “longlist” round in the voting before the selection of the final nominees. For the best film prize, academy members will choose a 15-film longlist that all members must watch before voting for the winner.\n\nTodd Phillip's R-rated comic-book hit regained the top spot at the weekend box office in its fourth week of release, narrowly besting \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" The Warner Bros. sensation, starring Joaquin Phoenix, took in $18.9 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. \"Mistress of Evil,\" starring Angelina Jolie, is performing better overseas, where it grossed $64.3 million over the weekend. With such a close race at the top between \"Joker\" and \"Mistress of Evil,\" the order could switch when final figures are released Monday. But ticket sales have continued to surge well past expectations for \"Joker.\"\n\n(CNN) - \"Joker,\" the gritty comic book film about the origins of the crazed Batman villain, has become the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. \"R-Rated box office congratulatory posts aren't like the ones you're used to,\" Reynolds tweeted with a photo of Phoenix's Joker dancing above names of characters from other successful R-rated films like \"It\" and \"Ted.\" The film may be the highest-grossing R-rated film globally, but it still has a long way to before beating the highest-grossing R-rated film domestically. \"Joker\" shattered box office records when it opened earlier this month to $96 million in North America. The film won the Venice Film Festival's top prize and critics have raved about Phoenix's performance, which has led to Oscar talk.\n\nCNNNEW YORK (CNN) - Are the \"Joker\" stairs the new \"Rocky\" stairs? Fans of the \"Joker,\" which hit theaters earlier this month, are taking photos in front of those stairs. Joker, portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, dances down the stairs as Gary Glitter's \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" plays in the background. \"Always put a happy face...\" wrote Arnaldo Silva in the caption of his \"Joker\" dance impression. Shout out to James May, who went for the basic tourist photo standing in front of the stairs.\n\nSome viewers are outraged because the song he dances to was made by a convicted pedophile. Warner Brothers has been slammed because critics have been concerned that Glitter would get paid for the movie's use of his song. But apparently, Glitter no longer owns the rights to the song and won't get a penny. We've had no contact with him, according to a statement from Snapper Music, which now owns the song.

In the film that shattered box office records over the weekend, Phoenixs sinister character explains he has a condition that causes him to laugh uncontrollably. It's called pseudobulbar affect, also known as PBA, and it's a neurological condition characterized by uncontrollable laughing and/or crying outbursts.

Relatives of Aurora Shooting Victims Worry 'Joker' Could Inspire Violence\n\nThe new movie starring Joaquin Phoenix is facing backlash from some before it even opens. Could it incite violence? Some are calling out Trump after his frosty encounter with Greta Thunberg at the United Nations. Blood-curdling screams echoed through a California neighborhood when a real estate agent came under attack while showing a house. For more Inside Edition stories tune in to today's show.\n\nTitled \"Joker,\" Phoenix stars as failed comedian Arthur Fleck, who ultimately becomes the comic book villain. Several victims of the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, are expressing their concerns in particular. The film feels like a \"slap in the face,\" Sandy Phillips, whose daughter was killed in Aurora, told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I don't think it's the responsibility of a filmmaker to teach the audience morality or the difference between right or wrong,\" Phoenix told IGN. Relatives of those killed in the Aurora shooting are asking Warner Brothers, the studio behind the film, to donate to anti-gun violence causes.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures via CNN(CNN) - A group of people whose loved ones witnessed or were killed in 2012's Aurora theater shooting are calling on Warner Bros. to help combat gun violence as the studio prepares to release its rated-R comic book film \"Joker.\" (Warner Bros., like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.) \"Over the last several weeks, large American employers from Walmart to CVS have announced that they are going to lean into gun safety. Shooter James Holmes is currently serving multiple life sentences for the shooting, which killed 12 and injured 70. Warner Bros. has not responded to CNN's e-mailed request for comment.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix attends the \"Joker\" premiere during the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival at Roy Thomson Hall on Sept. 9, 2019, in Toronto. (CNN) - Joaquin Phoenix is known for being extremely private and rarely mentions his late brother, River. Phoenix thanked his late brother during an emotional acceptance speech Monday at the Toronto International Film Festival after he was awarded the TIFF Tribute Actor Award. The Phoenix brothers aren't the only ones who have found success in Hollywood, as their sisters Rain, Liberty and Summer are also actors. Joaquin Phoenix also had words of gratitude for them Monday in his speech."
