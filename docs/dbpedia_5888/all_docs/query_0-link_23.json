        "text": "River Jude Phoenix (né Bottom; August 23, 1970 – October 31, 1993) was an American actor and musician.\n\nPhoenix grew up in an itinerant family, as the older brother of Rain Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, Liberty Phoenix, and Summer Phoenix. He had no formal schooling, but showed an instinctive talent for the guitar. He began his acting career at age 10 in television commercials. He starred in the science fiction adventure film Explorers (1985) and had his first notable role in 1986's Stand by Me, a coming-of-age film based on the novella The Body by Stephen King.\n\nPhoenix made a transition into more adult-oriented roles with Running on Empty (1988), playing Danny Pope, the son of fugitive parents in a well-received performance that earned him a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (at age 18, he became the sixth-youngest nominee in the category), and My Own Private Idaho (1991), playing Michael Waters. For his performance in the latter, Phoenix garnered enormous praise and won a Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival as well as Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead and National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor, becoming the second-youngest winner of the former.\n\nEarly life\n\nPhoenix was born on August 23, 1970, in Madras, Oregon, the first child of Arlyn Dunetz and John Lee Bottom. He has four younger siblings, Rain (born 1972), Joaquin (born 1974), Liberty (born 1976) and Summer (born 1978), as well as a paternal half-sister, Jodean (born 1964). Phoenix's parents named him after the river of life from the Hermann Hesse novel Siddhartha, and he received his middle name from the Beatles' song \"Hey Jude\". In an interview with People, Phoenix described his parents as \"hippieish\". His mother was born in New York to Jewish parents whose families had emigrated from Russia and Hungary. His father was a lapsed Catholic from Fontana, California, of English, German, and French ancestry. In 1968, Phoenix's mother travelled across the United States. While hitchhiking in California she met John Lee Bottom. They married on September 13, 1969, less than a year after meeting.\n\nPhoenix's family moved cross country when he was very young. Phoenix has stated that they lived in a \"desperate situation.\" Phoenix often played guitar while he and his sister sang on street corners for money and food to support their ever-growing family. Phoenix never attended formal school. Screenwriter Naomi Foner later commented, \"He was totally, totally without education. I mean, he could read and write, and he had an appetite for it, but he had no deep roots into any kind of sense of history or literature.\" George Sluizer claimed Phoenix was dyslexic.\n\nActing career\n\n1980–1985: Early work and acting background\n\nBack in the United States, Arlyn began working as a secretary for an NBC broadcaster and John as an exteriors architect. Talent agent Iris Burton spotted River, Joaquin, and their sisters Summer and Rain singing for spare change in Westwood, Los Angeles, and was so charmed by the family that she soon represented the four siblings.\n\nPhoenix started doing commercials for Mitsubishi, Ocean Spray, and Saks Fifth Avenue, and soon afterward he and the other children were signed by Paramount Pictures casting director Penny Marshall. River and Rain were assigned immediately to a show called Real Kids as audience warm-up performers. In 1980, Phoenix began to fully pursue his career as an actor, making his first appearance on a TV show called Fantasy singing with his sister Rain. In 1982, Phoenix was cast in the short-lived CBS television series, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, in which he starred as youngest brother Guthrie McFadden. Phoenix arrived at the auditions with his guitar and promptly burst into a convincing Elvis Presley impersonation, charming the show producer. By this age, Phoenix was also an accomplished tap dancer.\n\nAlmost a year after Seven Brides ended in 1983, Phoenix found a new role in the 1984 television movie Celebrity, in which he played the part of young Jeffie Crawford. Although only onscreen for about ten minutes, his character was central. Less than a month after Celebrity came the ABC Afterschool Special: Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia. Phoenix starred as a young boy who discovers he has dyslexia. Joaquin starred in a small role alongside his brother. In September, the pilot episode of short-lived TV series It's Your Move aired. Phoenix was cast as Brian and only had one line of dialogue. He also starred as Robert Kennedy's son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in the TV movie Robert Kennedy and His Times. After his role in Dyslexia was critically acclaimed, Phoenix was almost immediately cast in a major role in made-for-TV movie Surviving: A Family in Crisis. He starred as Philip Brogan alongside Molly Ringwald and Heather O'Rourke. Halfway through the filming of Surviving, Iris Burton contacted him about a possible role in the film Explorers.\n\nIn October 1984, Phoenix secured the role of geeky boy-scientist Wolfgang Müller in Joe Dante's big-budget science-fiction film Explorers alongside Ethan Hawke, and production began soon after. Released in the summer of 1985, this was Phoenix's first major motion picture role. In October 1986, Phoenix co-starred alongside Tuesday Weld and Geraldine Fitzgerald in the acclaimed CBS television movie Circle of Violence: A Family Drama. This was Phoenix's last television role before achieving film stardom.\n\n1986–1993: Critical success in Stand by Me, Running on Empty, My Own Private Idaho\n\nPhoenix had a significant role in Rob Reiner's popular coming-of-age film Stand by Me (1986), which made him a household name at 16. Filming started on June 17, 1985, and ended in late August 1985, making Phoenix 14 for most (if not all) of the movie. The Washington Post opined that Phoenix gave the film its \"centre of gravity\". Phoenix commented: \"The truth is, I identified so much with the role of Chris Chambers that if I hadn't had my family to go back to after the shoot, I'd have probably had to see a psychiatrist.\" Later that year, Phoenix completed Peter Weir's The Mosquito Coast (1986), playing the son of Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren's characters. \"He was obviously going to be a movie star,\" observed Weir. \"It's something apart from acting ability. Laurence Olivier never had what River had.\" During the five-month shoot in Belize, Phoenix began a romance with co-star Martha Plimpton, a relationship which continued in some form for many years. Phoenix was surprised by the poor reception for the film, feeling more secure about his work in it than he had in Stand by Me.\n\nPhoenix was next cast as the lead in the teen comedy-drama A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon (1988), but was disappointed with his performance: \"It didn't turn out the way I thought it would, and I put the blame on myself. I wanted to do a comedy, and it was definitely a stretch, but I'm not sure I was even the right person for the role.\" Also in 1988, Phoenix starred in Little Nikita alongside Sidney Poitier. During this time, the Phoenix family continued to move on a regular basis, relocating over forty times by the time Phoenix was 18. Phoenix purchased his family a ranch in Micanopy, Florida, near Gainesville, in 1987, in addition to a spread in Costa Rica.\n\nHis sixth feature film was Sidney Lumet's Running on Empty (1988), for which the 18-year-old Phoenix received National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor and nominations for a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award, becoming the sixth-youngest Academy Award nominee in the category. Phoenix jumped to his feet during the ceremony when Kevin Kline beat him to the Oscar. \"I had to stop River from running to hug Kevin,\" recalled his mother Arlyn. \"It never crossed his mind that he hadn't won\". In 1989, he portrayed a young Indiana Jones in the prologue of the box-office hit Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the third installment of the Indiana Jones franchise, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Harrison Ford.\n\nPhoenix was photographed by Bruce Weber for Vogue and was spokesperson for a campaign for Gap in 1990. He starred with Kevin Kline, Tracey Ullman, Joan Plowright and Keanu Reeves in the 1990 comedy film I Love You to Death. Phoenix had met Reeves while Reeves was filming the 1989 film Parenthood with Phoenix's brother, Joaquin, and girlfriend, Martha Plimpton; however, Phoenix had reportedly auditioned for Bill in Reeves' then-current film Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure before the role was taken by Alex Winter.\n\nHe co-starred with Lili Taylor in the acclaimed independent picture Dogfight (1991), directed by Nancy Savoca. In the romantic coming-of-age drama set in San Francisco, Phoenix portrayed a young U.S. Marine on the night before he is shipped off to Vietnam in November 1963.\n\nPhoenix reunited with Keanu Reeves to co-star in Gus Van Sant's 1991 avant-garde film My Own Private Idaho. For his performance, he won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival. In addition, the 21-year-old Phoenix received Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead and National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor, becoming the second-youngest winner of the former. The film and its success solidified his image as an actor with edgy, leading man potential.\n\nAround this time, Phoenix was approached by George Lucas to reprise his role of a younger Indiana Jones for The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, a spin-off television series produced by the ABC that served as a prequel to the Indiana Jones films. However, Phoenix declined to reprise the role due to having started his career in different sitcoms and struggled hard to get out from the television medium, not being willing to return to it. The role of a younger Indy was eventually filled by Corey Carrier and Sean Patrick Flannery respectively.\n\nHe teamed up with Robert Redford and again with Sidney Poitier for the conspiracy/espionage thriller Sneakers (1992). A month later, he began production on Sam Shepard's art-house ghost western Silent Tongue (which was released in 1994). He was beaten out for the role of Paul by Brad Pitt in A River Runs Through It. Phoenix then starred in Peter Bogdanovich's country music-themed film, The Thing Called Love (1993), the last completed picture before his death. He began a relationship with co-star Samantha Mathis on the set.\n\nMusic\n\nAlthough Phoenix's movie career was generating most of the income for his family, it has been stated by close friends and relatives that his true passion was music. Phoenix was a singer, songwriter, and accomplished guitarist. He had begun teaching himself guitar at age five and had stated in an interview for E! in 1988 that his family's move to Los Angeles when he was nine was so that he and his sister \"could become recording artists. I fell into commercials for financial reasons and acting became an attractive concept\". Before securing an acting agent, Phoenix and his siblings tried to forge a career in music by playing cover versions on the streets of the Westwood district of LA, often being moved along by police because gathering crowds would obstruct the sidewalk. From the first fruits of his film success, Phoenix saved $650 to obtain his prized possession: a guitar with which he wrote what he described as \"progressive, ethereal folk-rock\".\n\nWhile working on A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon in 1986, Phoenix had written and recorded a song, \"Heart to Get\", specifically for the end credits of the movie. 20th Century Fox cut it from the completed film, but director William Richert put it back into place for his director's cut some years later. It was during filming that Phoenix met Chris Blackwell of Island Records; this meeting would later secure Phoenix a two-year development deal with the label. Phoenix disliked the idea of being a solo artist and relished collaboration; therefore he focused on putting together a band. Aleka's Attic were formed in 1987 and the lineup included his sister Rain.\n\nPhoenix was committed to gaining credibility by his own merit and maintained that the band would not use his name when securing performances that were not benefits for charitable organizations. Phoenix's first release was \"Across the Way\", co-written with bandmate Josh McKay, which was released in 1989 on a benefit album for PETA titled Tame Yourself. In 1991, Phoenix wrote and recorded a spoken word piece called \"Curi Curi\" for Milton Nascimento's album TXAI. Also in 1991, the Aleka's Attic track \"Too Many Colors\" was used in the film My Own Private Idaho, which included Phoenix in a starring role.\n\nAleka's Attic disbanded in 1992, but Phoenix continued writing and performing. While working on the film The Thing Called Love in 1993, Phoenix wrote and recorded the song \"Lone Star State of Mine\", which he performs in the movie. The song was not included on the film's soundtrack album. In 1996, the Aleka's Attic track \"Note to a Friend\" was released on the 1996 benefit album In Defense of Animals; Volume II and featured Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers on bass. Phoenix had collaborated with friend John Frusciante after his first departure from Red Hot Chili Peppers and the songs \"Height Down\" and \"Well I've Been\" were released on Frusciante's second solo album Smile from the Streets You Hold in 1997. Phoenix was an investor in the original House of Blues (founded by his good friend and Sneakers co-star Dan Aykroyd) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which opened its doors to the public after serving a group of homeless people on Thanksgiving Day 1992.\n\nActivism\n\nPhoenix was a dedicated animal rights and environmental activist. He was a vegan from the age of seven. He was a prominent spokesperson for PETA and won their Humanitarian Award in 1992 for his fund-raising efforts. His first girlfriend Martha Plimpton recalled: \"Once when we were fifteen, River and I went out for a fancy dinner in Manhattan, and I ordered soft-shell crabs. He left the restaurant and walked around on Park Avenue, crying. I went out and he said, 'I love you so much, why? ... ' He had such pain that I was eating an animal, that he hadn't impressed on me what was right.\"\n\nIn 1990, Phoenix wrote an environmental awareness essay about Earth Day targeted at his young fan base, which was printed in Seventeen magazine. He financially aided a great many environmental and humanitarian organizations, and bought 800 acres (320 ha) of endangered rainforest in Costa Rica. As well as giving speeches at rallies for various groups, Phoenix and his band often played environmental benefits for well-known charities as well as local ones in the Gainesville, Florida area.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn February 1986, during the filming of The Mosquito Coast, Phoenix began a romance with his co-star Martha Plimpton. They had met a year earlier but initially disliked one another. They also co-starred in the 1988 film Running on Empty before the relationship ended in June 1989. The two maintained a close friendship until his death.\n\nFor the last year of his life, in 1993, he dated his The Thing Called Love co-star Samantha Mathis. Mathis was with Phoenix on the night he died.\n\nDeath\n\nPhoenix died on October 31, 1993, at the age of 23, in West Hollywood. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at the family ranch in Micanopy, Florida.\n\nHonors and rankings\n\nPhoenix has been ranked numerous times on a number of lists recognizing his talent and career. He was listed as one of twelve \"Promising New Actors of 1986\" in \"John Willis' Screen World\" (2004). Phoenix was voted at No. 64 on a \"Greatest Movie Stars of All Time\" poll by Channel 4 television in the UK. The poll was made up wholly of votes from prominent figures of the acting and directing communities. He was ranked No. 86 in Empire magazine's \"The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time\" list in 1997.\n\nHis life and death has been the subject of an E! True Hollywood Story, an A&E Biography and an episode of Final 24, which contains a dramatic reconstruction of his final hours and death. He was also referred to as \"This century's James Dean\" in episode 10 (\"Mi Casa, Su Casa Loma\") of the first season of Being Erica. His death was listed as No. 16 in the top 101 events in E! Television's \"101 Most Shocking Moments in Entertainment\". In 2010, Phoenix was voted by GQ magazine as one of the \"50 Most Stylish Men of the Past Half Century\".\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1985 Explorers Wolfgang Müller Nominated – Young Artist Award for Exceptional Performance by a Young Actor – Motion Picture 1986 Stand by Me Chris Chambers Jackie Coogan Award (shared with Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell) The Mosquito Coast Charlie Fox Nominated – Young Artist Award for Best Young Male Superstar in Motion Pictures 1988 A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon Jimmy Reardon Little Nikita Jeff Grant Running on Empty Danny Pope National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor\n\nNominated – Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor\n\nNominated – Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture\n\n1989 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Young Indiana Jones 1990 I Love You to Death Devo Nod 1991 Dogfight Eddie Birdlace My Own Private Idaho Michael \"Mikey\" Waters Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead\n\nNational Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor\n\nVolpi Cup for Best Actor\n\nNominated – New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor (2nd place) 1992 Sneakers Carl Arbogast 1993 The Thing Called Love James Wright 1994 Silent Tongue Talbot Roe Posthumous release 2012 Dark Blood Boy Posthumous release, final film role – filmed in 1993\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1982–1983 Seven Brides for Seven Brothers Guthrie McFadden 21 episodes\n\nYoung Artist Award for Best Young Actor in a Drama Series 1984\n\nNominated – Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor in a New Television Series 1982 1984 Celebrity Jeffie Crawford (Age 11) Miniseries ABC Afterschool Special Brian Ellsworth Episode: \"Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia\"\n\nNominated – Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor in a Family Film Made for Television shared with Joaquin Phoenix It's Your Move Brian Episode: \"Pilot\" Hotel Kevin Episode: \"Transitions\" 1985 Robert Kennedy & His Times Robert Kennedy, Jr. (Part 3) Miniseries Family Ties Eugene Forbes Episode: \"My Tutor\" Surviving: A Family in Crisis Philip Brogan Television film\n\nYoung Artist Award for Best Young Actor Starring in a Television Special or Mini-Series 1986 Circle of Violence: A Family Drama Chris Benfield Television film\n\nMusic videos\n\nYear Title Artist Role 1986 \"Stand by Me\" Ben E.
