        "text": "It’s impossible not to smile at the love that radiates from Liberty for her calf, Indigo, or the marvelous curiosity they share for their new life roaming spacious land in permanent sanctuary. Thanks to generous supporters like you, Liberty is able to nurse Indigo, bond with her, protect her, and watch her grow up—just as nature intended.\n\nAlthough we cannot rescue our way out of animal agriculture, I hope you will always know Liberty and Indigo as living embodiments of liberation and as ambassadors for a compassionate vegan lifestyle.\n\nPlease join me—in the spirit of Liberty’s first Mother’s Day at Farm Sanctuary—and adopt them today!\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJoaquin Phoenix\n\nAs a Farm Sanctuary member, you change lives through your care and compassion. Because of you, we can save farm animals from the very worst … and then give them (and their families) our very best.\n\nFor a one-time donation of $35, you can support a rescued animal family through our Adopt a Farm Animal Program. These “symbolic adoptions” fund their lifelong care, as well as our work to end farm animal cruelty. In gratitude for your gift, we’ll send a digital certificate featuring your adoptive families. Print this Mother’s Day card for yourself, or email it to the special people in your life.\n\nMeet the loving moms you can adopt this Mother’s Day:"
