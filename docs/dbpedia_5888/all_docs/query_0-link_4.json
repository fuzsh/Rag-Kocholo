        "text": "See photos of Joaquin Phoenix and his siblings, which includes his three sisters and his late brother, River Phoenix.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix has a big family — and they’re all famous, too! Joaquin is the third-born of five siblings total. He has three sisters, Rain Phoenix, Liberty Phoenix, and Summer Phoenix, and a brother, River Phoenix, who tragically died in 1993 at the age of 23. River passed away of a drug overdose, and he was outside the Viper Room with a few people, Joaquin included, when he collapsed and died. At one point or another, all of Joaquin’s siblings have worked in acting. River delivered some incredible performances in movies and even garnered an Oscar nomination before his death. All three sisters have appeared in movies and TV shows before as well. The entire family is vegans, and they’re all very involved in different social organizations. Click through the galleries to see more pics of the Phoenix family."
