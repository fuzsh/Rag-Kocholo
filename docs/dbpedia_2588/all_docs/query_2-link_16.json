        "text": "Obituary\n\nWarren E. Moritz\n\nBorn January 1, 1922\n\nI was born on our farm located about 7 miles north of Junction City, Kansas. My parents were Albert Moritz and Agnes Oliver Moritz and I had 5 sisters and two brothers. Mother and Dad gave us lots of love, gentleness and guidance. I remember the fried chicken, watermelon and mother’s cinnamon rolls. Dad took me fishing and hunting-there are many fond memories of both mother and dad.\n\nI went to Pleasant View School to the 7th grade and then to St. Xavier in Junction City for the 8th grade and my Freshman year of High School. I graduated from Junction City High School in May, 1940.\n\nIn about 1938 I caught a ride to Seattle and stayed with Aunt Nell and Uncle Dick and cousins Bud and Dorothy for a couple of months. One summer Ted Burnett and I drove to Denver in his Chevy Coupe. We stayed with his sister and also visited cousin Hazel. We climbed Pikes Peak on the cog rail. In the fall of 1940 I worked at Fort Riley in the build up of the fort for the war. I saved enough money to buy a 30 Chevy 2-door and in the spring of 1941 Marcus Stice and I drove to California. I worked for Douglas Aircraft until September of 1942 when I joined the Navy. I was discharged from the Navy in January of 1946.\n\nI was married in March 1943 to Marjorie Benton. We had four children: Michele, Keith, John and Jeanine. They all live and work in Southern California. I have 10 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. I worked in the construction trade from 1946 until 1984 when I retired.\n\nI met Terry Kater Benny in 1969 and we have been married since 1982. Terry has 3 children, Mary, Linda and Louis, 13 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren. I have spent my time since retirement doing many improvements to our home and yard work and gardening. I started playing golf in 1992. I wish I had started earlier in life as it is much fun. I’ve had a lot of good times and some bad in life but all in all it’s been great. Time passes so fast-it seems only yesterday that Momma was rocking us to sleep, Dad was listening on the crystal set and lots of homework being done around the oak table with a kerosene lamp.\n\nWarren’s Children:\n\nMichele Green\n\nKeith Moritz\n\nJohn Moritz\n\nJeanine Schimmel\n\nWarren’s Grandchildren:\n\nKristie Harnisch\n\nScott Johnson\n\nDoug Brown\n\nKevin Moritz\n\nNicole Browning\n\nMarissa Moritz\n\nSydney Moritz\n\nBrittney Moritz\n\nMatthew Rosenberg\n\nShaina Rosenberg\n\nWarren’s Brothers:\n\nRay Moritz\n\nRobert Moritz"
