        "text": "Help us realize a new\n\nvision of health\n\nPHILANTHROPY\n\nInstitute for Systems Biology (ISB) is a nonprofit scientific research organization located in Seattle. We believe in the power of science transforming health.\n\nYou are committed to a better future, ISB is here to make that a reality.\n\nLearn More\n\nHealthy Aging\n\nRESEARCH\n\nResearch suggests that it may be possible to eliminate the correlation between age and diseases. ISB is working to leverage systems biology approaches to understand the mechanistic links among the processes that accompany and/or lead to aging.\n\nLearn more\n\nYou are not entirely human\n\nRESEARCH\n\nEach of us has a microbiome — trillions of microorganisms that reside in and on our bodies. ISB researchers are unlocking the mysteries of the human microbiome and translating our cutting-edge science to health care.\n\nLearn more\n\nLatest News\n\nTiming is Everything: ISB Study Finds Link Between Bowel Movement Frequency and Overall Health\n\nEverybody poops, but not every day. An ISB-led research team examined the clinical, lifestyle, and multi-omic data of more than 1,400 healthy adults. How often people poop, they found, can have a large influence on one’s physiology and health.\n\nDr. Wei Wei Promoted to Associate Professor\n\nWei Wei, PhD – an accomplished cancer researcher with expertise in biotechnology and cancer systems biology – has been promoted to ISB associate professor. The Wei Lab focuses on understanding how cancer cells adapt to therapeutic treatment to foster therapy resistance by coordinating their internal molecular machinery and how these adaptive changes evolve within diverse tumors influenced by the tumor microenvironment.\n\nHow Glioblastoma Resists Treatment – and Ways to Prevent It\n\nGlioblastoma is one of the deadliest and most aggressive forms of primary brain cancer in adults and is known for its ability to resist treatment and to recur. ISB researchers have made breakthrough discoveries in understanding the mechanisms behind acquired resistance, focusing on a rare and stubborn group of cells within tumors called glioma stem-like cells.\n\nHack Your Health: An Evening with Anjali Nayar and Dr. Sean Gibbons\n\nNetflix’s “Hack Your Health: The Secrets of Your Gut” is a documentary that merged gut microbiome experts, four individuals – including a well-known hot dog eating champion – facing personal battles with gastrointestinal health, and a unique, effective visual method of “showing” the gut microbiome in action.\n\nA New Path Toward Microbiome-Informed Precision Nutrition\n\nISB researchers have developed a novel way to simulate personalized, microbiome-mediated responses to diet. They use a microbial community-scale metabolic modeling (MCMM) approach to predict individual-specific short-chain fatty acid production rates in response to different dietary, prebiotic, and probiotic inputs.\n\n‘A Life Like No Other:’ Remembering Beloved ISB Professor Ilya Shmulevich\n\nDevoted husband and father. Animal lover. Accomplished pianist. Avid cyclist. Compassionate human. Exceptional scientist. The ISB community mourns the loss of Professor Ilya Shmulevich, PhD, who died on April 13, 2024. He was 54 years old.\n\n2023-24 School Year ISB Education Highlights\n\nEach month throughout the 2023-2024 academic year, we will highlight some of the top projects the ISB Education team is working on. In May, the ISB Education team hosted student visitors from Lincoln High School, dozens of science education leaders who run projects in Washington state’s ClimeTime program, and more.\n\nMaking Nutrition and Healthcare Personalized, Predictive, and Preventive\n\nDr. Sean Gibbons is creating a new precision nutrition platform called My Digital Gut that leverages the gut microbiome to make nutrition and healthcare personalized, predictive, and preventive. In an ISB Research Roundtable presentation, Gibbons spoke about My Digital Gut and other microbiome-related projects studied in his lab.\n\nSTEM Program Models for Students from Historically Marginalized Communities\n\nA new study unveils important insights and actionable protocols into providing equitable STEM experiences for high school students from historically marginalized communities. The research highlights the transformative power of informal STEM learning and the ease with which many organizations could provide these opportunities."
