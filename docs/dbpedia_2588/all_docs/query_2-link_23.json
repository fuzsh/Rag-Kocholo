        "meta_description": "Author Summary Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world, responsible for an estimated 500 million new cases and 600,000 deaths annually. The etiologic agents of the disease are protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium that have a complex cycle between mosquito and mammalian hosts. Though all clinical symptoms are attributable to the blood stages, it is only by attacking the transmission stages that we can make an impact on the economic and health burdens of malaria. Infection is initiated when mosquitoes inoculate sporozoites into the skin as they probe for blood. Sporozoites must locate blood vessels and enter the circulation to reach the liver where they invade and grow in hepatocytes. The inoculum is low and these early stages of infection are asymptomatic. Though the small amounts of material available for study has made large scale -omics studies difficult, killing the parasite at this stage would prevent infection and block downstream transmission to mosquitoes, thus preventing spread of disease. Here we use state-of-the-art biochemistry tools to identify the proteins on the sporozoite surface and find that two of the most studied proteins, CSP and TRAP, have post-translational modifications. These studies will aid investigations into the novel biology of sporozoites and importantly, significantly expand the pool of potential vaccine candidates.",
