        "text": "The future of kidney care\n\nEvery year, our annual report provides an opportunity to stop and reflect on the many accomplishments of the past year. There is so much to be grateful for – completing our 60th anniversary celebration, honoring our volunteer board and expanding our reach to deliver quality, compassionate care to more people impacted by kidney disease.\n\nAs we closed out our celebration of Northwest Kidney Centers’ first 60 years, we turned our attention to the future, to building the roadmap on how we bring to life our vision of creating a world where kidney disease no longer inhibits people from living their best lives.\n\nThis roadmap is represented in our strategic plan, which lays out the steps we will take to move us closer to achieving our bold vision. This plan will drive outcomes that are good for our patients, our people and our community.\n\nWe are committed to delivering equitable, innovative, and person-centered care to our patients; to investing in staff so they can stay, grow, and find fulfilling, mission-driven careers; and to meeting the greatest needs of our community through our financial strength and innovative partnerships.\n\nYou, our extended Northwest Kidney Centers community, will be instrumental in the success of this plan in the coming year and beyond. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated staff, passionate partners and steadfast supporters. Together, we will build a future where our impact extends far beyond the walls of our facilities, touching the lives of countless individuals and families.\n\nRebecca Fox\n\nPresident and CEO"
