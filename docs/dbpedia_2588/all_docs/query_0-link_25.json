        "text": "The Future of Abortion Access After This Term's Supreme Court Cases\n\nOn June 28th, CRHLP hosted an online panel with legal scholars, impacted providers, abortion researchers, and advocates to discuss the practical effects of FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, concerning access to mifepristone, and Moyle v. United States, which concerns whether EMTALA supersedes Idaho’s abortion ban. Panelists discussed the practical effects of these cases on abortion access in the country.\n\nWatch the event on YouTube here.\n\nA Conversation with CA Senator Toni G. Atkins\n\nOn February 8, 2024, CRHLP hosted an in-person conversation about CA Senate President pro Tempore Emeritus Toni G. Atkins' important contributions to advancing reproductive rights and justice in California. We also discussed her inspiring path to becoming the first woman and the first openly LGBTQ person to lead the California Senate, and the first person in 150 years to lead both houses of the California Legislature.\n\nThe event also featured CA Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur, Chief External Affairs Officer for Planned Parenthood Los Angeles Celinda Vazquez, and Executive Director of CRHLP Melissa Goodman.\n\nAbortion on the Ballot\n\nOn November 9, 2023 CRHLP hosted a webinar that explored how the battle over abortion access has been fought through state ballots across the country and is growing to be a key issue in candidate elections. Held shortly after the November 7 election to enshrine a state constitutional right to abortion in Ohio, the webinar addressed the lessons learned from that campaign, including from the opposition efforts to keep abortion-related measures off the ballot altogether and the fiercely contested dispute to frame ballot language. The discussion of the Ohio election was contextualized within the broader learnings from the 2022 midterm elections, when measures protecting access to abortion prevailed in California, Michigan, and Vermont, and measures to restrict access were defeated in Kentucky, Kansas, and Montana. The webinar also explored the growing impact of abortion access as an issue in candidate elections.\n\nWatch the webinar on YouTube here.\n\nThe Impact of Dobbs on Access to Abortion\n\nOn May 9, 2023 this panel discussed the results of the #WeCount study and other research measuring the direct impact of the Dobbs decision on abortion, including medication abortion and access through telehealth.

Wiley, UCLA School of Law hosted an in-person conference on “Mainstreaming Reproductive Health in Health Law, Policy and Ethics” on February 10, 2023.\n\nThis national conference brought together health law, food and drug law, employee benefits, health information privacy, bioethics, and medical experts from across the country to share insights on how and why government and institutional leaders have traditionally siloed off reproductive and sexual health from other health care needs. We focused on the implications of this exceptionalism for efforts to secure access to reproductive and sexual health care in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade. We identified strategies for mainstreaming reproductive and sexual health within efforts aimed at securing equity, patient safety, and patient autonomy in health care financing and delivery.\n\nThis event was co-sponsored by UCLA Law’s Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy, UCLA Law’s Health Law and Policy Program, and SMU Dedman School of Law's Tsai Center for Law, Science and Innovation.\n\nMore information | Watch the panels online\n\nVisions of Reproductive Justice Series: Birthing While Black\n\nOn February 8th 2023 the Black Law Students Association, the Critical Race Studies Program at UCLA Law, and the Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy hosted a webinar to explore the intersections between reproductive justice and racial justice.

However, fewer were confident in their knowledge (48%) or ability to do so (40%).\n\nRead the full article in JAMA Network Open here.\n\nDemographics of Contraceptive Method Use in California, 2020\n\nAn estimated three-quarters of California women—approximately 2.8 million in 2020—who are sexually active and wish to avoid pregnancy are using contraception. While contraceptive use demographic data is readily available at the national level, less information is available on the demographics of contraceptive use at the state level in California.\n\nWe examined sociodemographic variability in the main method of birth control reported by sexually active cisgender heterosexual and bisexual women. We found both demographic differences among California users and differences between California data and national data. Researchers, advocates, providers, and others concerned with contraceptive method choice should take these differences.\n\nRead the report here.\n\nAccess to ella® Emergency Contraception at California Pharmacies\n\nA new study from CRHLP found that only one in five community pharmacists in California works at a pharmacy that provides ella emergency contraception without an outside provider’s prescription. The report draws on data from a 2022 survey of California pharmacists and the 2020 California Health Interview Survey and emphasizes the urgent need for action to ensure equitable access to effective emergency contraception in the face of increasing bans and restrictions on abortion rights.\n\nRead the report here.\n\nBarriers to Minor Access to Emergency Contraception in California Pharmacies\n\nA new study from CRHLP found that teens under the age of 18 are prevented from purchasing levonorgestrel emergency contraception (EC) over the counter in about half of the community pharmacies surveyed in California. The study, conducted using data from the 2022 California Pharmacist Survey, sheds light on the disparities minors face when obtaining emergency contraception, a crucial resource for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCalifornia Healthy Youth Act Implementation\n\nCalifornia has long led the nation in its push for inclusive sex education for students. Much of this advocacy culminated in the passage of the California Healthy Youth Act (“CHYA”) in 2016. The law requires instruction of comprehensive sex education, including but not limited to information about HIV and pregnancy prevention, healthy relationships, gender identity, and more for middle and high school students. Despite the law’s passage over seven years ago, it has yet to be fully implemented across the state. The UCLA Law Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy has been working in partnership with EducateUs, a national advocacy organization, to track implementation efforts across California. With the help of students participating in our inaugural Reproductive Justice Externship Seminar, we were able to craft a toolkit aimed at helping administrators and management at schools better implement CHYA in their district; as well as a Know Your Rights Factsheet for students to further feel empowered of their rights under the law. We are now working in partnership with advocates across the state to continue our efforts to ensure CHYA is implemented in every middle and high school in California.\n\nFact Sheet\n\nToolkit for administrators and management\n\nContraceptive Utilization and Access Among Cisgender Heterosexual and Bisexual California Women\n\nUsing data from the 2020 California Health Interview Survey, researchers examined the use of birth control and pregnancy intentions of cisgender heterosexual and bisexual women ages 18-44.\n\nResults show that while many women of color in California are using contraception, women of color were overrepresented among those not using contraception relative to White, non-Hispanic women. Lower income women, those who were uninsured or had Medi-Cal, and those who did not have a usual source of health care were less likely to use contraception.\n\nRead the report\n\nImproving Access to Abortion Medication and Contraception: Findings from the California Pharmacist Survey\n\nDespite state legislative efforts to increase access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services through pharmacists, current research suggests that the potential impact of these policies has not been fully realized. To better understand implementation barriers to the provision of SRH services, including abortion medication, emergency contraceptives, and self-administered hormonal contraceptives (e.g., the pill, patch, ring, or injection), we conducted an online survey of California pharmacists (N=919). Main findings include the following:\n\nThree-quarters (75%) of pharmacists would be willing to prescribe abortion medication if allowed by law. Looking ahead to this future potential authority, less than half were confident in their knowledge of medication abortion (44%) or their ability to prescribe abortion medications if allowed by law (41%).\n\nOver 90% of pharmacists agreed that providing access to contraception is important, including emergency contraception (e.g., Plan B, Ella)\n\nLess than one-third (29%) of pharmacists believed that parental consent should be required before providing emergency contraception to minors.\n\nThree-quarters (75%) of pharmacists were willing to prescribe hormonal contraception, such as birth control pills taken regularly to prevent pregnancy, to patients regardless of age.\n\nVery few pharmacists reported religious (9%) or moral (7%) objections to prescribing hormonal birth control.\n\nMany pharmacists were confident in their knowledge of hormonal contraception (72%) and their ability to prescribe contraception (61%).\n\nMore than three-quarters (79%) of pharmacists working in community pharmacies indicated that their pharmacies provided levonorgestrel emergency contraception (e.g., Plan B, One-Step) without an outside provider’s prescription (i.e., over the counter or pharmacist-prescribed).\n\nDespite having the authority in California, slightly less than half (46%) of pharmacists worked in community pharmacies that offered pharmacist-prescribed self-administered hormonal contraception (e.g., the pill, patch, ring, or injection).\n\nPharmacists most frequently endorsed these reasons for why the pharmacies where they worked did not offer pharmacist-prescribed contraception: inadequate staff or time to add new services (42%), lack of knowledge or training about hormonal contraception (32%), and lack of coverage for the service even if the medication is covered (24%).\n\nRead the full report here.\n\nImproving Access to Essential Prevention Services: The Opportunities and Challenges of Expanding the Role of California's Pharmacists\n\nA new study by CHRLP, California HIV/AIDS Policy Research Centers, and the California Society of Health-System Pharmacists shows that while the vast majority of pharmacists in California want to administer PREP and PEP, most lacked the training or time to do so. Key findings from the study include:\n\nOnly 11% of those surveyed indicated that pharmacists at their pharmacy initiate PrEP as authorized by SB 159; similarly, 13% reported providing PEP under SB 159\n\nRespondents reported feeling that pharmacy-based PEP and PrEP provision is important (96%) yet significantly fewer respondents reported being confident in their knowledge of PrEP (50%) and ability to prescribe PrEP (41%)\n\nLess than a third of currently practicing licensed pharmacists (29%) reported receiving training on PEP and PrEP, as required to prescribe medications under SB 159\n\nMore than a third of respondents (37%) from pharmacies that do not initiate PrEP selected inadequate staff/time to add new services as the main barrier to implementation\n\nThe second most cited barrier to implementation was the lack of insurance coverage for pharmacy-based PrEP services (17%).\n\nYou can read the brief report here or the full report here.\n\nPeople Traveling to Illinois for Abortion Care after Roe v. Wade was Overturned\n\nIn June of 2022, the Supreme Court released its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, overturning both Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey and ruling that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee the right to abortion. As a result, states are now free to regulate abortion as they see fit and 26 states are likely to ban all, or nearly all, abortions. In the months since Dobbs was decided, we have already seen significant increases in interstate abortion travel and greater strain on clinics in states where abortion remains legal.\n\nThis data brief estimates that as a result of these restrictions on access to abortion, between 9,277 and 18,554 more people will travel to Illinois each year for abortion care.\n\nRead the report.\n\nThe Implications of Dobbs on Reproductive Health Care Access for LGBTQ People Who Can Get Pregnant\n\nA new review of studies from the Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy and the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law finds that the 2022 Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization will have a unique and significant impact on LGBTQ people who can get pregnant.\n\nRead the report.\n\nSecond Report on Preserving Reproductive Health Access on the Anniversary of Roe V. Wade\n\nOn January 25, 2022, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a motion to ensure women’s access to quality reproductive health care services. The Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy has worked alongside Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health advocates to develop written recommendations on how Los Angeles County could respond now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned. The report, which contains a recommended path forward to ensure everyone who needs reproductive and sexual health services has a right to access a full spectrum of care, features the CRHLP study which estimates that now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned, an additional 10,600 people will travel to California each year for abortion care.\n\nRead the report.\n\nPeople Traveling to California and Los Angeles for Abortion Care if Roe v. Wade is Overturned\n\nA new study from the Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy at UCLA School of Law finds that when the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, an estimated 10,600 people will travel to California each year for abortion care, 6,200 of whom will come to Los Angeles County.\n\nRead the study.\n\nTestimony of Cary Franklin before the California State Senate Judiciary Committee in support of State Constitutional Amendment 10\n\nOn Tuesday, June 14, 2022, Professor Cary Franklin provided testimony on behalf of SCA 10, a resolution which would amend the California State Constitution to \"prohibit the state from denying or interfering with an individual’s reproductive freedom,\" \"which includes their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion and their fundamental right to choose or refuse contraceptives.\"\n\nRead her testimony.\n\nRecommendations to Protect, Strengthen, an Expand Abortion Services in California\n\nThe Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy joined more than 40 organizations to create the California Future of Abortion Council.
