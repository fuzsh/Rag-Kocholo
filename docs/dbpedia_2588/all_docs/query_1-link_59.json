        "text": "Appleby-in-Westmorland is one of the quaint market towns that dot the pastoral landscape of Northern England’s beautiful Cumbria region. Sharing a border with Scotland, Cumbria itself has a fascinating history that harkens back millennia. Indeed, archeological evidence has revealed the presence of human activity since the Neolithic period, with several sites featuring equipment utilized to mass produce widely used stone axes. Many regional prehistoric settlements also featured various religious structures common to the era, like stone circles and henges. (Perhaps the most noteworthy ancient monument still standing in Cumbria now is the Castlerigg Stone Circle outside of Keswick.) Celtic cultural groups eventually formed throughout the region amid the subsequent Bronze and Iron Ages. Among the most predominant Celtic tribes were the Carvetii and Brigantes, who created numerous villages across Cumbria. Those Celtic peoples managed to remain independent of foreign influence for generations, even as the Roman Empire began invading Great Britain further south during the 1st century A.D. In fact, the native population briefly cooperated with the newly arrived Roman magistrates before distancing themselves several years later. Coming to view the nominal Celtic autonomy as a threat, Rome sent two legions to depose the local rulers and officially integrate Cumbria into the province of Britannia.\n\nTo safeguard the area from other potentially hostile Celts, the Roman Emperor Hadrian ordered a line of imposing fortifications constructed along Cumbria’s northern border. Known as “Hadrian’s Wall,” a permanent garrison of some 10,000 auxiliary soldiers manned the interconnected citadels for decades. The Romans also settled across Cumbria, too, establishing their own towns and implementing their own legal codes. The native Cumbrians subsequently adopted those customs as well, forming the basis for future forms of government once the Roman Empire collapsed during the 5th century. In the ensuing power vacuum, bands of Cumbrian nobles created a multitude of petty fiefdoms that gradually coalesced into the Kingdom of Rheged. However, neighboring feudal societies eventually conquered the area, starting first with the Kingdom of Strathclyde and then the Kingdom of Northumbria. By the time William the Conqueror had seized the English throne in the 11th century, the site of modern-day Cumbria had fallen under the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Scotland. But in 1092, William’s son, King William II of England, directed a military campaign that seized Cumbria permanently from the Scots. Cumbria thus became a battleground between England and Scotland over the next five centuries, with the regional capital of Carlisle enduring a number of major sieges.\n\nWhile the tension subsided following the personal union of both countries in the early 17th century, Cumbria nonetheless still experienced a few pitched battles related to the English Civil War and the Jacobite Risings. Peace and stability arrived in the wake of those conflicts though, which provided a ripe atmosphere for extensive industrialization to take place in Cumbria’s urban localities during the 19th century. Communities like Workington and Kendal emerged as major factory towns, while Barrow-in-Furness became home to a bustling shipyard. Even Carlisle saw countless steel mills and iron refineries debut in great quantities. Nevertheless, most of Cumbria remained rural in character, presenting a rich bucolic charm that artists and writers alike adored to experience. Notable English writers—such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coolidge—often used the Cumbrian geography to inspire their own uniquely creative works. The fascination with Cumbria’s enduring natural beauty continued well into the 20th century, helping to spawn a conservation movement that preserved several hundred acres as the “Lake District National Park.” A designated UNESCO World Heritage Site, the wonderful Lake District National Park is now visited by nearly 16 million people every year. (Hadrian’s Wall is another UNESCO World Heritage Site that cultural heritage travelers can discover when out exploring Cumbria’s extensive past.)\n\nBaron de Clifford (1299 – 1676): One of England’s most prominent peerages, the Baron de Clifford was originally held by the Clifford family. The lands assigned to the title were massive, including fiefdoms in Herefordshire, Yorkshire, and Westmorland (Appleby Castle). King Edward I had created the rank exclusively for Robert de Clifford in 1299. An English soldier of Norman ancestry, Robert had helped defend Northern England in the Wars of Scottish Independence. Robert had specifically fought on behalf of King Edward I during the battles of Falkirk and Caerlaverock Castle, before dying amid a Scottish cavalry charge at Bannockburn in 1314. However, Robert’s heir, Roger Clifford, had nearly destroyed the Baron de Clifford in the wake of his father’s death. Seeing King Edward II as a weak successor, Roger and other lords joined an aristocrat named Roger Mortimer in his attempt to forcibly curtail royal authority. Furthermore, Mortier and his allies had wished to remove the influential Despenser family from the King’s court. The uprising proved successful at first, with Mortimer forcing a brief exile of the Despensers in 1321. King Edward II nonetheless managed to rally more nobles to his cause, resulting in the defeat of the rebels at the battles of Bridgnorth and Boroughbridge a year later. Roger himself was then executed alongside 40 other lords and his titles were confiscated.\n\nUpon the final deposition of King Edward II in 1327, Roger’s brother managed to get Baron de Clifford formally reinstated. Despite the political controversy, the Clifford family continued to rise in power. For instance, John Clifford, the 7th Baron of Clifford, served alongside King Henry V in the Hundred Years’ War. A respected jouster, John aided the King in his pivotal sieges of Harfleur and Cherbourg in France. Perhaps John’s greatest contribution was his presence at the legendary Battle of Agincourt in 1415, which saw a numerically inferior English army famously rout a highly sophisticated French force. Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford, continued to back the crown when a rival branch of the royal household, the Yorkists, challenged the claim of King Henry VI, thus starting the Wars of the Roses. The Cliffords were principal allies of the King and formed an important part of his coalition, the Lancastrians. Thomas Clifford even served as a major general, ultimately perishing at the First Battle of St. Albans in 1455. Thomas’ own son—John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford—continued to diligently support the Lancastrians, too. He notably fought with distinction at the Battle of Wakefield in 1460, where he slew the original Yorkist claimant, Richard of York, as well as one of his children, Edmund, Earl of Rutland.\n\nThe Baron would meet his own demise at the Battle of Towton not long thereafter, which saw the new Yorkist challenger, Edward, become King Edward IV. In retribution, the King revoked the Clifford family’s estates. (Appleby Castle itself fell into the temporary ownership of Sir John Parr, Lord of Kendal.) Indeed, they failed to earn their castles back once King Edward IV was succeeded by his brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, during the late 15th century. But fortune finally returned to the Cliffords once King Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field by the forces of Henry Tudor, a distant relative to the former King Henry VI. Now crowned as King Henry VII, Henry Tudor restored the Baron de Clifford and its many attending lands to the Clifford family in 1485. The Cliffords subsequently reemerged as influential courtiers in English society over the following decades. The 11th Baron of Clifford—Henry Clifford—even earned an additional title, the Earldom of Cumberland, in the 16th century. However, the family line had grown thin around the middle of the 17th century, with Lady Anne Clifford surviving as the final head of the household until her own death in 1676. The title Baron de Clifford eventually passed onto her eldest daughter’s in-laws, the Tufton family. Also known as the Earls of Thanet, the Tufton family would then possess the title for the next several generations.\n\nLady Anne Clifford: Officially the Countess of Dorset, Pembroke, and Montgomery, 14th Baroness de Clifford, Lady Anne Clifford was the last head of the powerful Clifford family. Indeed, the Cliffords played significant roles in major events throughout English history, like the Hundred Years’ War and the Wars of the Roses. Their accomplishments led to great affluence, as best epitomized by the five castles the family controlled at the time of Lady Anne’s birth in the late 16th century. Lady Anne herself was the daughter of George Clifford, a renowned naval officer who had a considerable reputation within the Tudor court. As a child of the nobility, Lady Anne received access to the finest education and developed a lifelong passion for the arts. In fact, her primary teacher had been the celebrated poet, Samuel Daniel. However, a strong confidence complimented her studious demeanor, earning the young girl many admirers during her youth. Lady Anne’s poise even won her the praise of another inspiring woman, Queen Elizabeth I of England.\n\nLady Anne would benefit greatly from such an attitude, especially once her father disinherited her in favor of a male heir—his brother, Francis Clifford. The move had been a controversial one, as the Clifford family had operated under the practice of absolute cognatic primogeniture since the 14th century. (For reference, absolute cognatic primogeniture legally mandated that any inheritance go to the surviving firstborn child, regardless of gender.) Lady Anne spent decades fighting in court to restore her rights to the family's numerous estates in the wake of George’s death in 1617. Despite the legitimacy of her claims, she nonetheless received tepid support from many men, including her first husband, Sir Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset. King James VI and I (of Scotland, England, and Ireland) also gave little assistance, offering a weak settlement that did little to uphold her status as the rightful heir. But Lady Anne only continued to endure in the face of overwhelming odds. Her dogged resistance heartened numerous women, too, such as the King’s own wife, Anne of Denmark.\n\nHaving spent many years fighting for her rights, Lady Anny finally became the legal heir upon the death of her cousin, Henry Clifford, in 1643. She subsequently commissioned a brilliant mural of her family known as The Great Picture in honor of the moment. Over the next three decades, Lady Anne would act as a wonderful steward for all five castles. She diligently restored every estate and even initiated a second round of renovations to the ones that were assaulted during the English Civil War. (Lady Anne was a devout royalist during the conflict, which endeared her closely to King James II after the monarchy was restored in the 1660s.) Lady Anne’s time as the head of the Clifford family also saw her pursue many charitable endeavors, such as the restoration of several churches in the towns outside of her estates. She was even an important patron of the arts and pursued some writing of her own in her spare time. In the end, Lady Anne Clifford passed away at the impressive age of 86 in 1676, leaving behind a legacy that has continued to fascinate countless people ever since.\n\n1092: Historical records indicate that Ivo Taillebois began building the first motte-and-bailey castle earthwork upon the site of present-day Appleby Castle. Taillebois himself was a powerful Norman lord who would be the first person to assume the title “Baron of Westmorland.”\n\n1100: Ranulf le Meschin, 3rd Earl of Chester, finished building a series of motte-and-bailey earthworks upon the site at some point between 1100 and 1120. Meschin established close ties with Anglo-Norman kings William II and Henry I, who were both scions of William the Conqueror.\n\n1136: As a civil war known as “The Anarchy” descended upon England, an influential nobleman named William Fitz Duncan seized large swathes of northern English territory on behalf of the reigning King of Scotland, King David I. Duncan thus emerged as the lord over several castles, including Appleby Castle.\n\n1157: The area—including Meschin’s earlier fortifications—was given to Hugh de Montville by King Henry II shortly after the latter’s coronation three years earlier. Now elevated to be the Baron of Westmorland, the castle became a subsequent seat of power for Meschin.\n\n1170: Hugh de Montville proceeded to create an imposing citadel upon the site, building atop the series of rudimentary embattlements that Meschin had built several decades prior. Composed of durable stone, the structure quickly emerged as the primary place from which Montville and his family ruled over their vast feudal territory.\n\n1173: The Montville family joined King Henry II’s heirs in a rebellion that they had staged against their father. Hugh de Montville himself specifically allowed the Scottish King William the Lion to seize the castle amid his invasion of northern England in support of the revolt.\n\n1174: After months of fighting, forces loyal to King Henry II managed to finally suppress the uprising. The Montville family was among the rebellious nobles that Henry punished severely, confiscating Appleby Castle and its accompanying titles.\n\n1179: King Henry II eventually decided to give the imposing Appleby Castle to one of his chief allies during the rebellion, Ranulph de Glanville, Sheriff of Yorkshire. Glanville then renovated the compound thoroughly, rebuilding tall curtain walls and a corresponding “Great Hall” on the grounds.\n\n1198: King Richard I seized Appleby Castle again, leaving the site under the direct authority of the English monarchy yet again. Remembered as the “Lionheart” for his martial prowess, Richard was responsible for constructing a bridge over the moat that surrounded the facility.\n\n1203: King John I granted the castle to Robert de Vipont, a nephew of the late Hugh de Montville. The Viponts governed the Barony of Westmorland in turn and would live inside Appleby Castle for the next several decades. They instituted their own renovations, which included the creation of round towers around the structure.\n\n1263: The Vipont family became participants in the Second Barons’ War, backing Simon de Montfort in his attempt to limit the power of King Henry III. However, the head of the family at the time—another Robert—died during the conflict. In response, his two young heiresses, Isabella and Idonea, were taken prisoner and placed under royal guardianship.\n\n1265: Roger Clifford obtained the guardianship of Isabella de Vipont and had her family’s claim to Appleby Castle restored via an official pardon. His son and heir then married Isabella a decade later, thus making the compound a possession of the Clifford family.\n\n1322: Appleby Castle became affiliated with another uprising against the English monarchy, as the Clifford family fought against King Edward II during the Despenser War. While the Cliffords briefly lost control over Appleby Castle amid the conflict, they ultimately got it back once Edward’s heir, King Edward III, was crowned a few years later.\n\n1415: John Clifford had become the head of the Clifford family and served in the court of King Henry V. In fact, John would fight alongside the King during the Hundred Years’ War, serving bravely at the Battle of Agincourt before dying at the Siege of Meaux. Appleby Castle subsequently acted as a prison at the time.\n\n1454: Thomas Clifford undertook a significant restoration of Appleby Castle. The project specifically saw the redevelopment of the castle kitchens, the on-site chapel, and even the adjoining Great Hall itself. Additional defensive structures also debuted throughout the exterior of the main castle tower.\n\n1455: Amid the ongoing renovations to Appleby Castle, Thomas Clifford was slain fighting for King Henry VI during the Wars of the Roses. Clifford died while commanding units at the historic First Battle of St. Albans, with some scholars suggesting that his rival, Richard Neville, delivered the killing blow.\n\n1460: The new leader of the Clifford family, John, continued to support King Henry VI’s faction amid the ongoing Wars of the Roses. While he managed to defeat the main enemy lord, Richard of York, during the Battle of Wakefield, he died at the Battle of Towton a year later.\n\n1461: After the Battle of Towton, the newly crowned King Edward IV—Richard’s son—seized Appleby Castle and the rest of the Clifford family titles in vengeance. While the greater Barony of Westmorland went to the King’s brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, Appleby Castle went to one of his lieutenants, Sir John Parr of Kendal.\n\n1485: Now ruling as King Richard III, the erstwhile Duke of Gloucester died defending his throne from Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth Field. A distant descendant of King Henry VI, the new King Henry VII restored the Clifford family lands in recognition of their loyalty.\n\n1525: Henry Clifford received a great honor when his childhood friend, King Henry VIII, granted him a new regal title, “Earl of Cumberland.” Appleby Castle and the other buildings owned by the Clifford family thus emerged as the official seat of power for the prestigious Earldom of Cumberland.\n\n1570: Appleby Castle (and the other estates affiliated with the Clifford family) passed onto George Clifford. Like his ancestors, George would eventually establish a prominent reputation within the English court. He specifically became a founding member of the East India Company and emerged as an important courtier of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n1590: Lady Anne Clifford was born as the only heir to George Clifford, still acting as the head of the Clifford family. However, Lady Anne was eventually disinherited, with her uncle, Francis Clifford, obtaining Appleby Castle and the rest of the familial titles.\n\n1643: Upon the death of her cousin, Henry Clifford, Lady Anne Clifford inherited Appleby Castle by writ. She oversaw many momentous changes to affect the castle, notably constructing an even greater series of fortifications throughout the building’s exterior.\n\n1651: Unfortunately for Lady Anne, the Parliamentarian New Model Army managed to capture Appleby Castle amid the English Civil War. General Thomas Harrison subsequently oversaw the occupation of the compound. But Lady Anne Clifford won the castle back once the English monarchy was restored the following decade.\n\n1676: Lady Anne Clifford passed away, leaving Appleby Castle in the hands of her two daughters: Margaret and Isabella Sackville. Initially watching over Appleby Castle as joint owners, sole possession eventually passed to Margaret and her husband, John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet.\n\n1686: The Earls of Thanet began reconstructing the complex over the next several decades. Among their efforts was the work they had done on the Great Hall, which became a spectacular mansion. In fact, the building initially showcased some of the finest artistic philosophies of the Renaissance before giving way to Georgian-inspired renovations.\n\n1849: Having been the home for the Earls of Thanet for generations, the last Earl of Thanet, Henry Tufton, died in France without an heir. Appleby Castle then became the residence of Richard Tufton, an illegitimate son of Henry. Richard Tufton’s descendants would then act as the owners of Appleby Castle until the 20th century.\n\n1951: The British government identified Appleby Castle as a Grade I Listed Building, indicating that it bore an incredible connection to the country’s history. To date, only around 20,000 buildings feature a Grade I listing throughout all of England.\n\n1974: Appleby Castle was eventually sold to Denis Vernon, the entrepreneurial CEO of Ferguson Industrial Holdings. Establishing the historic castle complex as his own home, Vernon invested heavily in safeguarding its architectural integrity. (Vernon also used the castle as the company headquarters for a while, too.)\n\n1997: New owners obtained Appleby Castle. Maintaining the Ferguson family tradition of on-site historic preservation, they began investigating ways to open the compound to the public. The plans were an extensive undertaking, which sought to truly preserve the building’s character for future generations to appreciate.\n\n2009: Sally Nightingale became sole proprietor of Appleby Castle, becoming the first independent female owner of the compound since Lady Anne Clifford. Renovations to help open the facility to the public generated momentum, including work to turn the mansion into a stunning boutique hotel.\n\n2013: After years of dedicated construction, Appleby Castle reopened for guided tours, conferences, and weddings. Furthermore, portions of the mansion hosted 12 distinctive guestrooms, while another three cottages provided additional space to host overnight guests.\n\n2019: Heritage England assisted with a thorough renovation of Appleby Castle in recognition of its status as a Grade I listed building. Among the most important changes to occur was the remodeling of the 12th-century keep into The Norman Centre—a museum dedicated to interpreting the history of the Normans in England.\n\n2023: Appleby Castle was inducted into Historic Hotels Worldwide. Historic Hotels Worldwide is a prestigious collection of historic treasures, including more than 300 legendary historic hotels including many former castles, chateaus, palaces, academies, haciendas, villas, monasteries, and other historic lodging spanning ten centuries."
