        "text": "THOMAS WALTER (TOM) KUNDIG, FAIA (1954-)\n\nPronounced koon-dig, not kunn-dig\n\nKundig was born in California and raised in Spokane WA, the son of Moritz (Morris), a well-regarded architect. Kundig initially preferred working with his hands over design. As a teenager, he learned to weld with Harold Balazs, a sculptor and friend of his father. During summer vacations he took jobs at sawmills. Kundig earned undergraduate and graduate architecture degrees from the University of Washington in 1977 and 1981. He worked for C. Cichanski & Associates from 1977-1980; Bruno Inabnit in Switzerland from 1980-1981; TRA from 1981-1983; The Callision Partnership in 1983; a partnership with Jochman from 1983-1984; and MHK Architects from 1984-1985. He joined Jim Olson's firm in Seattle WA in 1986 and became a partner in 1994. Rick Sundberg joined the firm in 1975. Scott Allen came as a partner next. There have been various firm names and partners over time. As of 2023, the name was Olson Kundig.\n\nKundig is one of residential architecture's rock stars with dozens of AIA awards, features in hundreds of publications worldwide, and lectures all across the globe. Writer Andrew Blum says \"Kundig is the firm's indisputable hotshot, creating the most daring designs and attracting the attention to match. He burst onto the architectural scene in the mid-1990s, just as Seattle itself was establishing pride of place in the American consciousness with the rise of Starbucks, Microsoft and Amazon.com. In the past five years, as Kundig's architecture has reached maturity, his houses have left an indelible mark on American residential design, becoming some of the most widely-published works of the last decade. When photos appear in a magazine, hundreds of calls pour into [their] offices from people interested in a Kundig house of their own.\" Video.\n\n2010 Kundig speaks at the NCSU College of Design\n\n\"People who build their own home tend to be very courageous. These people are curious about life. They're thinking about what it means to live in a house, rather than just buying a commodity and making it work.\" –Tom Kundig\n\n1984 - The Margaret Safranek Remodel, 3314 Crystal Springs Drive NE, Bainbridge Island WA.

The 2013 lawsuit sought \"a restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions and damages for violation of the protective covenants placed on the property by former property owners.\"\n\nThose plaintiffs, and the Mazama community in general, objected because the house violated 1987 covenants prohibiting views from the valley floor from being compromised and protecting the ridge. Video (YouTube). Kundig et al refuted that the plaintiffs had no legal standing, which was partially true. Only former owners Steven and Kristin Devin were ruled valid to proceed on the claim.\n\nIn October 2014, Superior Court Judge Chris Culp ruled the hut must be moved. \"Because the hut violates the covenants, the court rules in favor of plaintiffs,\" Culp wrote. \"Given plaintiff's prayer for relief, removal of the hut from its current location is the only remedy and the court rules accordingly.\" As of February 2015, according to Scott Johnston with MoveTheHut, the parties reached agreement to move the hut to a new site in spring 2015. The hut was moved in late 2015. Timeline (pdf).\n\n2013 - The Paul B. and Suzanne Mack House, aka Rimrock, 6316 North Indian Bluff Road, Spokane WA.
