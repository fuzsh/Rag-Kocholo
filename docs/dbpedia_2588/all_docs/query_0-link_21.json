        "text": "Results and Discussion\n\nHuman evolution is closely linked to dietary changes and the development of new food-processing techniques. This is clearly observed in the transition from hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agriculture, which gave rise to cultivation of crops, animal husbandry, and permanent settlements [1]. The more stable availability of food boosted the growth of Neolithic European populations [4, 5]. However, changes in diet had drawbacks for health, such as increased rates of caries [6]. Added to this, permanent large settlements combined with the adoption of agriculture promoted the spread of density-dependent infectious diseases [7]. Considering the impact of dietary habits on human evolution and health, the reconstruction of past human subsistence appears to be vital to our understanding of past societies. Stable carbon (13C/12C) and nitrogen (15N/14N) isotope analyses of bone collagen have been widely used to study the dietary adaptations of Neolithic populations [8], lipid analysis on pottery residues dated the onset of milk use in Neolithic Europe [9], and numerous archaeological studies describe the occurrences of wild and domesticated animal and plant remains as indirect measures of past diets [10]. All these studies provide insights into major dietary changes during the Neolithic period. However, specific details on past diets such as the exact meal composition or food processing are missing. Knowledge of daily dietary habits of our ancestors is pertinent as food type, intake quantity, and food-processing techniques influence human metabolism and health.\n\nA recent radiological re-examination of the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old European natural ice mummy, identified his completely filled stomach ( A) [2]. The well-preserved stomach content still contains ancient endogenous biomolecules as demonstrated from the complete reconstruction of the Iceman’s Helicobacter pylori genome [11]. Previous isotopic analysis (15N/14N) of the Iceman’s hair suggested first a vegetarian lifestyle [12, 13] which was later, after careful re-examination of the data, changed to a omnivorous diet [14]. Further analyses of lower intestinal tract samples of the Iceman confirmed that he was omnivorous, with a diet consisting of both wild animal and plant material. Among the plant remains, there were cereals, pollen grains of hop-hornbeam, and fragments of bracken and mosses [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. The detection of the Iceman’s stomach content with its pristine yet undigested food mix, provides the unique opportunity to fully reconstruct a Copper Age meal.\n\nThe study material included 11 gastrointestinal (GI) content biopsies of the stomach and small and large intestines ( A; Data S1). Using microscopy and a combined multi-omics approach targeting different biomolecules (ancient DNA, proteins, metabolites, and lipids) (see STAR Methods), we determined the exact composition of the Iceman’s diet preceding his death and present evidence how people during the Copper Age processed food.\n\nInitial macro- and microscopic analyses showed that, compared to the small and large intestine contents, samples of the stomach content still contain compact pieces of food that display a hydrophobic “fatty-like” character ( A). The most prevalent tissue types in the stomach content samples are animal muscle fibers arranged mostly in bundles ( B and S1) and plant fragments identified as bran and glumes belonging to the Triticum/Secale type ( C and S1). The striated muscle fiber structures are characteristic for cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue (Figure S1B) [21]. Further microscopic analysis of the plant micro-remains identified cereal pollen from the Triticum-type as well as airborne arboreal pollen and an abundance of spores and sporangia from the bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum (Figure S1J).\n\nMetabolite, glycan, stable isotope, and elemental analyses confirm the omnivorous character of the Iceman’s last meal (Data S2). Metabolic compounds indicate the presence of ruminant fat or dairy products (phytanic acid) and support the existence of whole-grain cereals (azealic acid) in the Iceman’s diet. In addition, gamma-terpinene that occurs in coriander oil, lemon oil, and other essential oils suggest the usage of herbs. The most abundant elements found in the stomach content were the nutritional minerals iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium, and sodium, consistent with the consumption of red meat or dairy products. Minor concentrations of trace nutrients of chromium, copper, manganese, selenium, molybdenum, and cobalt were also detected. These data suggest that the Iceman’s last meal was well balanced in terms of essential minerals required for good health with no evidence of toxic heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, or arsenic.\n\nTo further identify the possible food sources, we analyzed the DNA and protein traces still present in the material. Metagenomic analysis of the Iceman’s biopsy samples revealed a high number of bacterial reads in all GI tract contents ( A). At most, 39% of reads in the Iceman samples were of eukaryotic origin, the majority of which (between 94% and 42%) were identified as fungal. The Metazoa and Virdiplantae reads, important for the dietary reconstruction, comprised 0.2%–0.7% of all reads (Figures S2A–S2C). Comparative analysis of all GI shotgun datasets (n = 21) against currently available full mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes unambiguously assigned the majority of animal reads to ibex (Capra ibex) and red deer (Cervus elaphus), and the major proportion of plant reads belong to the species Pteridium aquilinum subsp. aquilinum and to members of the genus Triticum ( B and S2D). DNA traces of these four major taxa were detected in all GI content samples. A control dataset from the Iceman’s muscle tissue was negative (Figure S2D). The unambiguously assigned reads were aligned to modern reference plastid genomes, and all animal- and plant-derived reads show damage patterns indicative of ancient DNA (Figure S3) [22]. Subsequent phylogenetic assignment of the reconstructed plastid genomes confirmed and further extended the metagenomic result (Figure S3). The Triticum reads were more specifically assigned to chloroplast genomes of Triticum monococcum (einkorn) and Triticum urartu (Figure S3; Data S1).\n\nImportantly, the presence of ibex and red deer in the stomach contents was independently confirmed in the Molecular Population Genetics Laboratory, Trinity College, Dublin, by sequencing of a mammalian mitochondrial capture (Data S1). Moreover, PCR-based analysis targeting animal- and plant-DNA barcodes and further assignment of the shotgun data against the DNA Barcode of Life Data dataset (www.boldsystems.org) support the first metagenomic results on a phylogenetic higher hierarchical level (genus, family) (Figure S4).\n\nOur analysis of the ancient DNA identified the main components in the Iceman’s meal. However, the highly degraded state of this biomolecule excluded any further quantification of certain foods.\n\nUsing multistep solubilization and fractionation proteomics, we identified 167 animal and plant proteins in the stomach metaproteome, of which 13 were taxonomically unambiguously assigned to the Triticinae, 6 to the Caprinae, and 1 protein to the Cervinae subfamily ( C; Data S2). The proteomic hits not only confirm the previous metagenomic results but also provide important information on the food source. The detected Triticinae plant proteins are primarily expressed in the endosperm (Globulin 3A, Triticin) [23] and pericarp (Oxalate oxidase 2) [24] of wheat seeds. The Caprinae Titin-like protein is part of the sarcomere apparatus in muscle tissue [25]. Thus, we have combined genomic and proteomic evidence that the Iceman’s last meal contained whole seeds of the T. monococcum/T. urartu-like wheat and muscle fibers of ibex. However, due to the lack of diagnostic proteins, we cannot determine which tissues of the red deer were ingested by the Iceman.\n\nApproximately 46% ± 19% (w/w) of the stomach content is fat residues. Comparative lipid analysis of the Iceman’s stomach content to contemporary wild ruminant muscle and adipose tissue, and to goat dairy products (milk and cheese), using reverse-phase liquid chromatography separation and quadrupole time-of-flight (QToF) tandem mass spectrometry analysis (RP-LC/MSMS) identified triacylglycerols (TAGs) as a major component of the stomach content, with molecular compositions consistent with ruminant muscle/adipose fat ( A). The TAGs identified in the Iceman’s stomach contain between 44 and 56 total carbon atoms in the fatty acyl chains and resemble the TAG profile of contemporary muscle and adipose tissue. The high level (up to 20%) of odd numbered fatty acyl chains is consistent with TAG profiles from ruminant animals (Data S2) [27]. Short-chain TAG species characteristic of dairy products are absent in the Iceman TAG profile. However, the high level of saturated bonds in the TAGs of the Iceman’s stomach content compared to the fresh tissues indicates an already ongoing preferential degradation of unsaturated fatty acids in the ancient specimen ( B) [28]. Therefore, we cannot fully exclude that short-chain dairy-specific lipid species were degraded, although the identification of di- and poly-unsaturated TAG indicates a still high level of preservation. Furthermore, we have histological evidence for the presence of adipose tissue in the Iceman’s stomach content (Figure S1C). Further comparison of the dispersion factor with the average carbon number (M) of each detected TAG in the analyzed samples points to the ibex as potential source of the adipose tissue ( C). Thus, the ibex served the Iceman as food source for both meat and fat.\n\nCharcoal particles detected in a previous study in the Iceman’s lower intestine content suggested the involvement of fire in the food processing [16]. We experimentally tested the effect of heat and drying on contemporary animal muscle tissue and compared their structural and chemical composition with the muscle fibers detected in the Iceman’s stomach by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy. High magnification AFM images revealed striated fiber structures in both ancient and fresh or dried contemporary muscle fibers while structural changes of the fibers were observed when the samples were thermally treated ( A). After frying or cooking, the regular patterns in the meat fibers disappeared, indicating the denaturation of their protein compounds. Complementary confocal Raman spectroscopy measurements support the AFM results and indicate heat-related conformational changes of the molecular composition of the meat fibers ( B). The Raman spectra of the ancient muscle fibers largely matched the spectra taken of fresh and dried contemporary meat fibers. After heat treatment, the Raman band at about 1,093 cm-1 becomes weaker, and bands at around 1,240 cm-1 appear that are indicative of heat-induced changes in the secondary structure of the myofibrils [29]. Thus, both the AFM and Raman spectroscopy results suggest that the Iceman consumed either fresh or dried wild meat. Besides, a slow drying or smoking of the meat over the fire would explain the charcoal particles detected previously in the lower intestine content."
