Through her marriage to Louis, eldest son of King Charles VII of France, she became Dauphine (1451-1461) and Queen of France (1461-1483).\n\nOrigins\n\nCharlotte was born around 1441 or 1442[1]. Some sources give her birthdate as 11 November 1441[2][3]. She was the second daughter of Louis de Savoie and Anne de Lusignan. Her exact place of birth is not known.\n\nMarriage and children\n\nOn 11 March 1443, Charlotte was betrothed to Friedrich von Sachsen, son of Elector Friedrich II of Saxony[2]. She was later betrothed to Louis, Dauphin of France, on 21 January 1751. Charlotte was married by proxy on 9 March 1451 at Chambéry[2][3], and then on 2 April 1751 at Grenoble[4]. Charlotte was only about 9 years old, but the marriage was not consummated until she was at least 14 (According to Père Anselme, the marriage was consummated at Namur in 1457[5]). Louis, who was in open rebellion against his father Charles VII, had married without his consent and was living in his own province of Dauphiné.\n\nLouis fled Dauphiné in 1456 and took refuge by the Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good. He settled in the castle of Genappe, in present-day Belgium. Louis and Charlotte's first 3 (or 4) children were born at Genappe or Namur[6]. Their other children were born in France after Charles VII's death. They were:\n\nLouis (18 October 1458 – 1460), whose existence is disputed\n\nJoachim (15 July 1459 – 29 November 1459)\n\nLouise (born and died in 1460)\n\nAnne (3 April 1461 − 14 November 1522), married Pierre, Duke of Bourbon.\n\nJeanne (23 April 1464 – 4 February 1505), who married Louis, Duke of Orléans, later King Louis XII\n\nFrançois (born and died on 4 December 1466) (sometimes called Louis)\n\nCharles VIII of France (30 June 1470 – 8 April 1498)\n\nFrançois, Duke of Berry (3 September 1472 – November 1473)\n\nKing Louis XI and Charlotte kept separate households, Queen Charlotte educating her daughters Anne and Jeanne at Amboise while Louis (who took charge of the Dauphin) had his main residence at Plessis-lès-Tours.\n\nCharlotte died at Amboise on 1 December 1483, a few months after her husband. She was about 42 years old. Louis and Charlotte were buried at the Notre-Dame-de-Cléry basilica, unlike nearly all other French royals who were buried at Saint-Denis.\n\nSources\n\n↑ See discussion of her birth date at Wikipedia (in French)\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 Medieval Lands\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Leo van de Pas\n\n↑ Charlotte de Savoie at Wikipedia\n\n↑ Histoire généalogique et chronologique de la maison royale de France, des pairs, grands officiers de la Couronne, de la Maison du Roy et des anciens barons du royaume....
