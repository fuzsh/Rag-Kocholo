        "text": "Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, also known as the Prince of Venice, intends to renounce his claim to the Italian throne which he was formerly due to inherit after the death of his 86 year-old father, Prince Vittorio Emanuele.\n\nRead More\n\nInside the glamorous life of the Princess of Venice, the French actress who married an Italian prince\n\nPrincess Clotilde Marie Pascale of Savoy, also known as the Princess of Venice, turned 55 on 3 April\n\nNow, the role of pretender to the Italian throne will pass directly onto Prince Emanuele’s 19-year-old daughter, Princess Vittoria Chiara. Prince Emanuele, who is married to one of the most glamorous names in Parisian high society, Princess Clotilde Marie Pascale of Savoy, told the Daily Telegraph that he hoped that the initiative would show that his family was open and progressive. The Prince and Princess of Venice have two daughters, Princess Vittoria Chiara and Princess Luisa Giovanna.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n‘I will, with great pleasure, step down and let her take on the role, which I’m sure she will do better than me,’ Prince Emanuele Filiberto told the publication. ‘It won’t be tomorrow or in one year, but when she is ready. It’s important that the younger generation have a chance to put new, modern ideas into practice. They are much more conscious than us of the problems facing the world. And it is important that she doesn’t become the heir at too late a stage in her life.’ Two years ago, the House of Savoy changed its custom to hand the royal line on to male heirs, paving the way for Princess Vittoria to inherit the title.\n\nRead More\n\nFormer Prince Nikolai of Denmark, grandson of Queen Margrethe II, is set to move to Australia with his glamorous girlfriend\n\nCount Nikolai of Monpezat, formerly styled Prince Nikolai of Denmark, will have a semester abroad in Sydney this autumn\n\nVittoria is a model with 79,000 followers on Instagram, currently studying political science and history of art at a London university. Her role as pretender to the Italian throne will involve running the family’s charities, which last year reportedly spent around $1 million on projects. Her father’s decision to step down from the role means that, when the time comes, she will assume the title much earlier on in life.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe House of Savoy was the ruling House of Italy from 1861 to 1946, when they were overthrown by the Italian Republic. The last figurehead King, Victor Emmanuel III, remained until 1946, when he abdicated in favour of his son, Umberto II (Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia’s father), in an attempt to save the monarchy. However, the Italian people voted for a republic which ended his rule. With that, a clause was included in Italy’s constitution which banned the family from returning to Italy. They moved to Switzerland and the monarchist movement went into decline. However, in 2002, the ban was repealed and the family were reconciled with their country.\n\nRead More\n\nInside the world of Chelsy Davy, Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend, as she celebrates her wedding anniversary\n\nChelsy Davy was thrust into the public eye as Prince Harry’s girlfriend. When it ended, she didn’t fade away, but found adventure and inspiration in Africa, wrote associate editor Sacha Forbes in the April 2020 issue\n\nAlthough the titles and distinctions of the Italian royal family have been dissolved since Italy became a republic, the remaining members of the House of Savoy still use some of the various titles they acquired over their reign, and believe that they still hold a claim to the Italian throne. They hold Spain up as an example of this, when the Spanish King returned and assumed the role of monarch following the death of Franco in 1975. Despite the fact that there is currently little support for the Italian monarchy, Prince Emanuele insisted to the Telegraph that people find the concept of a monarchy appealing, pointing to the example of the British monarchy as an opportunity to ‘see a strong, almost spiritual presence, in kings and queens’."
