        "text": "Thomas Francis Savoy, 66, passed away Monday, October 24, 2022, at his home in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nTom was born on November 24,1955, in Cohoes, New York, to the late Arthur Joseph Savoy and the late Josephine Elizabeth Savoy.\n\nTom's life was the true embodiment of a life lived in selfless service to others. His devotion to the Catholic Church was at the center of his life as a husband, father, and musician. A family man at heart, he was also a genius composer, conductor, and organist endowed with incredible musical gifts which he used to glorify Jesus Christ and spread joy to others. For over 50 years, Tom held Catholic Church music positions in New York's Capital Region, including the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Albany, NY. He formed the New York Catholic Chorale and later relocated in 2012 with his wife, Deborah, to Charlotte, North Carolina, to serve as Director of Sacred Music at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church. Tom founded The Carolina Catholic Chorale and most recently served as Magister Capellae at Charlotte's St. Joseph College Seminary. When he wasn't directing or composing, Tom's greatest love and devotion was to his family. One could find him on the beach, in the garden, feeding the birds, making a Manhattan, laughing with his wife Deborah and enjoying his children and grandchildren.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Deborah Savoy, of Charlotte, NC, and his children Emalie (Jordan), Jonathan (Claudia), Bradley (NoÃ«l), Theodore, and Noel and grandchildren Jayce, Ryker, Collin, Theya, Rylan, Blaise, and Constance Aurelia, as well as his brothers Arthur (the late Mary Margaret) and Edward (Barbara).\n\nThe family will receive friends Friday, October 28, 2022, from 5:30 pm - 8:30 pm at Hartsell Funeral Home, 12115 University City Blvd., Harrisburg, North Carolina. The funeral Mass will be on Saturday, October 29, 2022, at 10:00 am at Saint Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, 1400 Suther Road, Charlotte, North Carolina 28213. Entombment will follow at the Charlotte Memorial Gardens at 7632 Hood Road, Charlotte, NC."
