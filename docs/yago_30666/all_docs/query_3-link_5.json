        "text": "23.0 x 15.0 cm (9.2 x 4.8 inches).\n\nLuigo X, Carlotta di Savoja\n\nFrance\n\nThis exquisitely detailed hand finished engraving is from a set titled il Costume Antico e Moderno by Dr Giulo Ferrario (1767-1847)and was made in the 1820s. Ferrario's work documented and compared clothes and costumes from around the world and across the ages, and it was one of the most important and thorough works on these subjects. These are fascinating images offering insights into both costumes, fashion and customs of the world.\n\nThis print is an authentic antique, not a reproduction. The hand painted coloring is bright and uses a beautiful range of colors. The paper is creamy white. It is in very good condition. There is some faint type off-setting."
