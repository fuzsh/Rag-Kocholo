        "text": "Louis XII (June 27, 1462 – January 1, 1515) was King of France from 1498 to 1515 and King of Naples from 1501 to 1504.\n\nLouis d’Orléans was born on 27 June 1462 in the Château de Blois, Touraine (in the modern French department of Loir-et-Cher). The son of Charles, Duke of Orléans, and Marie of Cleves, the last child of Adolph I, Duke of Cleves and his second wife, Mary of Burgundy, the second child of Jean the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy and Margaret of Bavaria, and an elder sister of Philippe III the Good, Duke of Burgundy.\n\nLouis d’Orléans’ father was almost seventy years old when Louis was born. Louis was only three years old when he succeeded as Duke of Orléans upon the death of his father in 1465.\n\nBefore his accession to the throne of France, Louis of Orléans was compelled to be married to his disabled and supposedly sterile cousin Joan of Orléans by his second cousin, King Louis XI of France. Joan of Orléans was the second daughter of King Louis XI of France and of his second wife Charlotte of Savoy. Joan was born sickly and deformed.\n\nIn Women Saints – Lives of Faith and Courage, Kathleen Jones says that Joan had a hump on her back and walked with a limp, suggesting that she had an abnormal curvature of the spine. Joan’s surviving siblings were King Charles VIII of France and Anne of France. It was shortly after her birth, the king signed an agreement to marry her to his second cousin Louis, the Duke of Orléans\n\nBy arranging this marriage King Louis XI hoped to extinguish the Orléans cadet branch of the House of Valois.\n\nLouis of Orléans was one of the great feudal lords who opposed the French monarchy in the conflict known as the Mad War. At the royal victory in the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier in 1488, Louis was captured, but King Charles VIII pardoned him and released him. He subsequently took part in the Italian War of 1494–1498 as one of the French commanders.\n\nKing Louis XI of France died on August 30, 1483. He was succeeded to the throne of France by his thirteen-year-old son, Charles VIII. Since Charles VIII was only thirteen years of age when he became king, his older sister Anne was to serve as regent until Charles VIII became 20 years old. From 1485 through 1488, there was another war against the royal authority of France conducted by a collections of nobles.\n\nThis war was the in the Cathedral of Reims on January 25, 1515, with Claude as his Queen Consort. (1485–1488), Louis’s war against Anne. Allied with François II, Duke of Brittany, Louis confronted the royal army at the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier on 28 July 1488 but was defeated and captured. Pardoned three years later, Louis joined his cousin King Charles VIII in campaigns in Italy, leading the vanguards of the army.\n\nAll four children of Charles VIII by Anne of Brittany died in infancy. The French interpretation of the Salic Law permitted claims to the French throne only by male agnatic descendants of French kings. This made Louis, Duke of Orléans, the great-grandson of King Charles V, the most senior claimant as heir of Charles VIII. Thus, Louis, Duke of Orleans, succeeded to the French throne on April 7, 1498 as King Louis XII of France upon the death of King Charles VIII.\n\nWhen Louis XII became king in 1498, he had his marriage with Joan annulled by Pope Alexander VI and instead married Anne of Brittany, the widow of his cousin Charles VIII. This marriage allowed Louis to reinforce the personal Union of Brittany and France. As mentioned in my recent post on the life of Duke François II of Brittany, Anne of Brittany was his daughter by his second wife Margaret of Foix, Infanta of Navarre.\n\nKing Louis XII persevered in the Italian Wars, initiating a second Italian campaign for the control of the Kingdom of Naples. Louis conquered the Duchy of Milan in 1500 and pushed forward to the Kingdom of Naples, which fell to him in 1501. Proclaimed King of Naples, Louis faced a new coalition gathered by King Fernando II-V of Aragon and Castile and was forced to cede Naples to Spain in 1504.\n\nIn 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter Claude and her cousin François, Duke of Angoulême, to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the Duchy of Brittany through her mother, Anne of Brittany. Following Anne’s death, the marriage took place on May 18, 1514.\n\nLouis XII did not encroach on the power of local governments or the privileges of the nobility, in opposition with the long tradition of the French kings to attempt to impose absolute monarchy in France. A popular king, Louis was proclaimed “Father of the People” in 1506 by the Estates-General of Tours for his reduction of the tax known as taille, legal reforms, and civil peace within France.\n\nLouis XII remained Duke of Milan after the second Italian War, and was interested in further expansion in the Italian Peninsula and launched a third Italian War (1508–1516), which was marked by the military prowess of the Chevalier de Bayard.\n\nLouis XII died on January 1, 1515 without a male heir. He was succeeded by his cousin and son-in-law François, Duke of Angoulême from the Angoulême cadet branch of the House of Valois. He was crowned as King François I of France in the Cathedral of Reims on January 25, 1515, with Claude as his Queen Consort."
