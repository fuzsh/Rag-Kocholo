        "text": "Anne of Beaujeu was born to King Louis XI of France and Charlotte of Savoy. She married Peter II, duke of Bourbon, with whom she shared the regency of France from 1483 to 1491 during the minority of her brother, Charles VIII. Anne skillfully managed the many intrigues against her regency, orchestrated by her fatherâ€™s enemies, and negotiated the marriage of Charles to Anne of Brittany, which in effect placed the duchy of Brittany under the French crown."
