        "text": "Louise of Savoy was an exemplary guardian of Francis’s interests, assessing every situation for its possible impact on his future. From his birth, her greatest preoccupation was whether Anne of Brittany would have a son who would displace Francis as heir to the throne. With each of Anne’s pregnancies, Louise privately rejoiced at the birth of a daughter or the death of a son. In 1512, she recorded in her Journal, “Anne at Blois...had a son, but he could not retard theexaltation of my Caesar; he was stillborn.” This journal, probably written about 1522, was essentially a catalog of the significant events of Louise’s life, most of them revolving around Francis. Unlike a mistress or a wife who conformed to her royal consort’s context, Louise, as Francis’s mother, shaped a future king and set the stage for his reign.\n\nWhen Francis became king, he turned to Louise for advice and assistance and relied on her to govern in his stead during his absences, certain that his own interests would be cultivated assiduously. Contemporary chroniclers acknowledged Louise’s fundamental influence over the young king, and artists portrayed her solicitous care for the kingdom and her son. Louise’s biographer, Paule Henry-Bordeaux, insists that she merited the title of “king” and recognition as one of the greatest “men of state” France has ever known. Louise’s preeminence in Francis’s court and, indeed, in the history of France was not foretold by her early circumstances.\n\nShe was born in 1476 into a noble family, closely related to the royal family but relatively impoverished. Her father was Philip of Bresse, the younger son of the house of Savoy. (His sister was Charlotte of Savoy, Louis XI’s much-despised wife). Her mother was Marguerite of Bourbon, the sister of the duke of Bourbon Jean II and of Pierre of Beaujeu, who married Anne, Charles VIII’s sister. Louise was sent to be reared under the tutelage of her aunt, Anne of Beaujeu. The most prominent member of that court circle of young women was Margaret of Austria, who was then Charles VIII’s intended bride. The early relationship between Margaret and Louise would prove fateful later in negotiating peace between Louise’s son, Francis I, and Margaret’s nephew, Charles V.\n\nWhen Louise was only two years old, Louis XI selected Charles d’Angoulême as her spouse, not to promote her well-being but rather to prevent Charles from making a more advantageous marriage to Marie, heiress to the duchy of Burgundy, binding him instead to the politically insignificant and territorially impoverished Louise. As with his own daughter’s marriage to Louis of Orléans, Louis XI deliberately arranged this marriage to the disadvantage of his potential rival—a practice in keeping with his reputation as a malevolent meddler, nicknamed the “Spider King.” After Louis XI died, Anne of Beaujeu, ruling in her brother’s stead, insisted that Charles d’Angoulême, despite his objections, marry Louise partly to punish him for fighting in the “crazy war” on Brittany’s side. Thus at the age of eleven, Louise married a man seventeen years older than she and into a household she shared with her husband’s long-standing mistress, Jeanne de Polignac, and their offspring. Jeanne took Louise under her wing in this unconventional domestic ménage at the chateau of Cognac, where both women raised their children together. Although somewhat unconventional and impoverished, the household was also cultured. Charles was interested in music, painting, and his library. He inherited an extensive manuscript collection from his father and added appreciably to it. He retained Robinet Tesard, the most important sixteenth-century manuscript illuminator, and the two Saint-Gelais brothers; Jean later attained great renown as Louis XII’s historian, and Octavien as a translator of ancient texts. The Angoulême household thus was in the forefront of the French Renaissance in its appreciation of the ancients.\n\nLouise took advantage of its cultural riches and shared these interests; one of her devices would be “Libris et Liberis” (for my books and for my children). Louise’s first child, her daughter Marguerite, was born in 1492. For Louise, as for other women of her station, her success as a wife required that she produce sons. To that end, she made a pilgrimage to consult with the holy man Francis de Paule, whose intercession was widely believed to ensure the birth of a son. He promised not only that Louise would have a son but also that he would be king. Louise’s much-longed-for son, Francis, was named for him. She expressed her joy when “Francis, by the grace of God, King of France, my pacific Caesar, took his first sight of the light of day at Cognac, about ten hours after midday 1494, the 12th day of September.”\n\nAfter the death of dauphin Charles-Orland (Charles VIII’s and Anne of Brittany’s son), Louise urged her husband to go to court to advance the family’s interests, as they were now closer to the throne. When Charles became ill en route, she rushed to his side and nursed him for more than a month. “No one could have done more...and as his illness became more extreme, she had to be persuaded to leave the room, so that she would not die, as she already appeared more dead than alive,” reported a contemporary. Louise commented with characteristic succinctness, “The first day of the year 1496, I lost my husband.” Charles’s will expressed confidence in his nineteen-year-old widow. He designated her as guardian of his children and manager of his estates, but left her with only two thousand écus after his debts were paid. The young widow relied on Jean de Saint-Gelais to advise her. Louis of Orléans tried to nullify Charles’s will, challenging Louise’s rights on the grounds that the customary age for such control was twenty-five and she was only nineteen. Charles VIII settled the issue by granting Louise custody of her children but Louis of Orléans control of their business affairs. If, however, Louise remarried, she would lose her guardianship—a stipulation that might well explain her resistance to subsequent marriage proposals.\n\nWhen Louis of Orléans became Louis XII, Louise went to court to reclaim some family lands now attached to the crown. Attaching lands to the crown through marriage was an important way the kingdom of France had gradually increased its territory. Royal relatives were granted land in appanage to give them a territorial base and income; such bequests would revert to the crown in the absence of a male heir. Thus Louise’s suit was highly unorthodox and ultimately unsuccessful. Louis further ordered the family to move to the royal chateau of Amboise and placed it under the control of Gié, an act Louise deeply resented. That enmity led Louise to make common cause later with Anne of Brittany in the court proceedings against Gié.\n\nWhen Louis came to power, Louise was no doubt greatly encouraged about Francis’s prospects. After all, Louis was married to Jeanne, by whom he had had no children and in whom he had little interest. Louise might well have begun to believe that Francis de Paule’s prophecy would soon be fulfilled. If Louis had no heir, Francis would be the next king. But Francis’s prospects were quickly jeopardized by Louis’s annulment and subsequent marriage to Anne of Brittany. The royal court, a model of decorum under Anne of Brittany, was rather horrified by Louise’s entourage of her husband’s former mistress, illegitimate children, and Saint-Gelais. He was considered to be such an adept advisor that, on Gié’s advice, Louis XII detached him from Louise, so that Angoulême family interests could not be pursued independently of those of the crown. The king’s appointment of Gié as Francis’s governor allowed him to interfere further in Louise’s affairs, beginning with the banishment of Saint-Gelais. Nonetheless, Louise continued to supervise Francis’s education conscientiously. She instilled in him an appreciation for chivalric practices and humanist texts, and he owed his facility in Italian and Spanish to her. Knowledgeable and appreciative of the arts, Louise was likely responsible for cultivating her son’s early interest in them. Early exposure to these texts, languages, and arts formed the young man who would, of all European monarchs, most assiduously foster Renaissance culture. The renowned humanist Castiglione later praised the exemplary quality of Francis’s education: “I was told that he greatly loved and esteemed learning and respected all men of letters.” But Francis was not proficient in Latin—the sine qua non of humanist accomplishment. Thus the humanist Guillaume Budé reported to Erasmus, “This prince is not lettered (which I fear is too often the case with our kings), but he is endowed with natural eloquence; he has intelligence, tact, suppleness, and an easy and agreeable manner.” Despite Francis’s reputation as an exemplarily educated Renaissance king, his sister profited more from their excellent education and became the scholar of the family.\n\nLouise watched with trepidation Anne’s many pregnancies and with hope each of the king’s increasingly serious bouts of ill heath. Every setback for the royal family also brought Louise’s matrimonial status to the fore, as Francis’s future kingship seemed more likely. Several crowned heads of Europe requested Louise’s hand in marriage, due to her son’s expected ascent to the throne. She rejected both Ferdinand of Aragon and Henry VII, deferring her opportunities for an advantageous marriage to protect her son’s interests.\n\nLouise wielded the greatest authority over Francis until he made his first public appearance as Louis’s heir in 1504 and moved beyond her direct tutelage. After the Assembly of Notables (1506) pleaded with Louis for a “French” marriage between his daughter Claude and Francis, the king formally recognized Francis as his heir and requested that he join his court. Louise commented, “My son went away from Amboise to be a courtier and left me all alone.”\n\nWith every passing year, Louise’s expectations that Francis would become king increased. When Francis toured the kingdom in 1510 as the heir apparent, he was received with great enthusiasm. After the birth of yet another stillborn son to Anne in 1512, Francis was called popularly “Monsieur le Dauphin.” He attended council meetings and was elevated to captain of a hundred lances. He acquitted himself well in his first military ventures, which may well have whetted his appetite for war. He belonged to the highest hereditary nobility, whose chief function was fighting. As descendents of the cadet branch of the house of Orléans, the Angoulêmehad grounds to intervene in Italy; Francis too could claim Milan through his great-grandmother Valentina Visconti. Like recent royal predecessors, Francis would spend much time and revenue pursuing the dream of control over Italy. Until her death, Louise would be the strongest advocate and most tireless negotiator for peace.\n\nFrancis became not only Louis’s presumed heir but also his son-in-law. Louise and Anne, despite their mutual antipathy (Anne was all too aware that Louise rejoiced in the deaths of her male children), were united in opposing this marriage. Both hoped for other more-advantageous marriages for their children. When Louis was ill in 1505, he appointed both Anne and Louise as Claude’s guardians. Before her death, Anne confided Claude’s guardianship to Louise. A responsibility, Louise insisted, she carried out “honorably and amiably,” although her claim that “everyone knows it; truth recognizes it; experience proves it; moreover common report proclaims it” might seem to protest too much.\n\nWhen Francis married Claude on May 18, 1514, the court was still in mourning for her mother. Nonetheless, the country rejoiced in its young, engaging presumptive heir. Francis immediately benefited from Claude’s wealth; courtiers,who expected to profit from the association, flocked to him; and in June he requested the right to administer Brittany from his new bride. But Francis’s fortunes were again cast into doubt by Louis’s sudden marriage to the sixteenyear-old beauty Mary, the sister of Henry VIII of England. As Louise recorded, “King Louis XII, very old and debilitated, left Paris to go to his young wife. . . .October was the amorous wedding . . . they were married at 10 o’clock in the morning and went to bed together in the evening.” Written seven years after Francis became king, this entry seems tinged with bitter recognition that Louise’s hopes for Francis might come to naught.\n\nLouise was a more astute and effective protector of Francis’s interests than he. According to Brantôme, Francis was not much interested in his young bride but intrigued by the new queen, even though such interest directly threatened his own prospects. When the courtier Jean de Grignols could not discourage Francis’s pursuit of Mary, he informed Louise, who warned Francis that the birth of a male child to Mary would be his undoing. Another serious threat was Mary’s ongoing interest in the duke of Suffolk. If Mary had borne a son, whether by Francis or the duke of Suffolk, Francis’s claim to the throne would have been nullified. So those protecting Francis’s interests kept the queen under constant surveillance until this threat to his future ended with Louis’s death on January 1, 1515. Louise rejoiced in the realization of her hopes at long last: “My son was anointed and consecrated in the church of Reims. For this I hold myself grateful to the Divine Mercy, by which I am amply repaid for all the adversities and inconveniences, which came to me in my early years.” Louise had attained her greatest ambition; Francis was finally king of France, his interests preserved in no small measure because of her astute attention to them.\n\nWhen Francis became king, Louise was thirty-eight years old. Antonio de Beatis, the secretary to the cardinal of Aragon, described her then as “an unusually tall woman, still finely complexioned, very rubicund and lively, and seems to me to be about forty years old but more than good, one could say, for another ten.” Contemporaries recognized both Louise’s ability and her influence on Francis. As Beatis noted,“She always accompanies her son and queen and plays the governess without restraint.” The duke of Suffolk warned Henry VIII: “Sir, it is she who runes [sic ], all, and so may she well, for I never saw a woman like to her for wit, honor, and dignity. She has a great stroke in all matters with the king, her son.” The Venetian ambassador Zaccaria Contarini’s account of Francis’s schedule highlighted Louise’s centrality in this new reign (and it is also revealing about how Francis spent his time): “He rises at eleven o’clock, hears Mass, dines, spends two or three hours with his mother, then goes whoring or hunting.”\n\n“Queens and Mistresses of Renaissance France”, Kathleen Wellman"
