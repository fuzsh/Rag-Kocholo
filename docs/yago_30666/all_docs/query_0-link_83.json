        "text": "Hi Grognard,\n\nThanks for looking in. I'm finally repainting this piece after more than 30 odd years!\n\nFirst bought from Historex Agents, the title was Louis XI and Marie de Provence.\n\nActually I checked on the web. Louis XI was married to Margaret Stewart and then Charlotte Savoy. None of them are shown in the dress as depicted in this piece!\n\nThe closest image I found was a Mokarex piece of Charlotte Savoy in this dress. I suspect that Le Cimier used this as their reference.\n\nThe closest dress to this was worn by Anne Beaujeu, Louis XI's daughter. So I am repainting them as a father and daughter pair.\n\nRgds Victor\n\nYou are right, here some illustrations of Charlotte de Savoie\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=Cha...QKHVTFCCYQ_B0wCnoECAsQAw#imgrc=YvqIRlsw_aJNLM\n\nIf you want to see the women's costumes from 1037 to 1870 look here for complete 10 volume in PDF and enjoy . This could help all peoples who want to make figurines of women in clothes they realy were wearing\n\nL'Histoire du Costume Féminin de l'an 1037 à l'an 1870\n\nhttps://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/1504"
