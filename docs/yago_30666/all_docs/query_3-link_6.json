        "text": "Charlotte of Savoy (10 March 1475 - 12 April 1524), known in Genovia and Sicily as Charlotte I, was Queen of Sicily from 1479 to 1524 and Queen of Genovia from 1490 to 1524 as the wife of Richard V of Genovia. She was the eldest daughter of Cecily, Duchess of Burgundy and Savoy and Philibert I of Savoy.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nCharlotte was born in Chambery in 1475 to the Duke and Duchess of Savoy. Charlotte was immediately recognised as heir presumptive of Savoy. She would continue to be the heir until 1479, when she abandoned Savoy to leave for Sicily. In 1478, Charlotte became the godmother to her first cousin Philip the Handsome, who also became her brother-in-law by marriage to Charlotte's sister-in-law Isabella of Genovia\n\nPrincess of Catania[]\n\nCecily became Queen of Sicily in 1477, and her eldest daughter Charlotte became heir. She was given the title of Princess of Catania. Charlotte’s sister, Alice, became a Sicilian Infanta. It was decided that if Ameliana, Queen of Aragon couldn’t provide an heir, Charlotte would become Queen of Sicily. Charlotte was immediately transported from Cecily’s native Burgundy to Sicily to prepare for Queenship. Alice was left in Burgundy in the care of Cecily, Maximilian, Isabella and Philip and would stay in Burgundy until Isabella's death in 1496.\n\nAccession[]\n\nWhen Amelia died childless in 1479, Charlotte was proclaimed Queen in Lentini. Preparations to send the 4-year-old Queen to Catania began. When she arrived in February, she was quickly crowned Queen of Sicily. Her mother, Cecily, was proclaimed regent as Charlotte was only 4. Charlotte spent the first few years of her reign in Catania.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nCharlotte's marriage thoughts had begun in 1485 when Constance IV of Genovia had visited Sicily with her 10-year old son Richard. Cecily had liked the idea of a marriage between Richard and Charlotte, as it would strengthen the alliance between Sicily and Genovia. Charlotte also surprisingly liked the idea, describing Richard as handsome and intelligent. Cecily had put forward a marriage proposal in 1486, and Constance had accepted it. The two were married on July 4 1487. They were both devoted to each other, and Richard treated his wife with respect.\n\nAccession in Genovia[]"
