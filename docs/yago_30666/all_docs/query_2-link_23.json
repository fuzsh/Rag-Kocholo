Cyprus was ruled by Venice during this period, and it took about a century for the Ottoman Empire to conquer it. The Byzantines sold their titles to Spain as a way for them to be seen more legitimate in the eyes of the Pope (as the Third Rome, they were \"successors\" of the former empire). But Cyprus was a gold mine. It was also isolated from the rest of Europe, so any attacks on it would need a really good fleet. Alfonso and Charla died childless, which is the reason she gave her claim to Charles of Savoy."
