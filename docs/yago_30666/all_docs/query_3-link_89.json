As the wife of Louis, Duke of Savoy, she was the Duchess consort of Savoy.\n\nMarriage\n\nAnne married Louis, Duke of Savoy in Chambery on 12 February 1434.[1][2] The contract for their marriage had been signed two years previously on 1 January 1432.[3] She bore a total of 19 children, of whom 14 survived infancy.\n\nDuchess of Savoy\n\nAnne's husband, Louis of Savoy, who was more interested in poetry than his duchy, but very much in love with his wife, gradually left Anne to manage affairs of state. She, due to nostalgia for her own country, organized many receptions on behalf of the most powerful Cypriot lords. To impress the visitors, she decorated the castles, organized festivals, and offered gifts to the guests, the expense of which caused much protest from the peasants and nobles of the county of Vaud.\n\nTo relieve some of her debts, Anne organized a match for one of her daughters, which was an advantageous alliance for the house of Savoy. In 1451, at the age of ten years, her daughter, Charlotte, married the dauphin of France, the future King Louis XI. He later would claim default of the promised dowry, new strongholds, and seized several castles in Bresse and several chief towns of Vaud.\n\nIn 1452, Anne bought the Shroud of Turin from Jeanne de Charny in exchange for the castle of Varambon. Years later Pope Paul II authorised Yolande of France to deposit the relic of the Holy Shroud in the vault of the castle of Chambéry from which she raised a tower above the sacristy, as a religious symbol.\n\nIssue\n\n1.
