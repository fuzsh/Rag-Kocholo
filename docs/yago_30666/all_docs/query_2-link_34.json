        "text": "Born in Pont-d'Ain, Philibert of Savoy was the son of Philip 'the Landless' of Savoy, a junior member of the ducal family of the Italian Savoy, and his first wife Marguerite de Bourbon. Philibert would have 2 other full-blooded siblings, his elder sister Louis, who married the French Count of Angouleme, and Girolamo, his short lived elder brother. He would also have 6 half-blooded siblings by his stepmother, Claudine de Brosse: Charles of Savoy, Louis of Savoy, Philip of Savoy, Assolone of Savoy, Giovanni Amedeo of Savoy and Philiberta of Savoy.\n\nIn 1496, Philibert's father succeeded as Duke, when his young grandnephew Duke Charles II of Savoy died. This death left Philip the Landless as the first male line heir. In this same year, Philip had his son Philibert, who was 16-year-old at the time, marry the 9-year-old Yolande Louise of Savoy, his cousin and the only sister of the deceased young duke. She was daughter of Duke Charles I 'the Warrior' of Savoy and Blanche of the Montferrat. Yolande Louise was also, after the death of her brother, was the succession of the kingdoms of Cyprus, Jerusalem an Armenia, although Philibert's father took those titles. Philip II of Savoy would die shortly after ascending to the Dukedom. Philibert then became Philibert II of Savoy.\n\nIn 1499, 3 years after ascending to the throne, Philibert's bride Yolande Louise died at the age of 12, leaving her cousin Charlotte of Naples as her heir. Philibert would continue to use her titles. Due to his widower state, Philibert searched for a new spouse and eventually settled on Margaret of Austria in 1500, sister to the Duke of Burgundy and daughter to the Holy Roman Emperor. With this connection Philibert was able to protect himself against the French, who continued to war through Italy and thus were always on the cusp of attacking Savoy.\n\nThe couple would be childless for the first few years of marriage and in 1504 Philibert took ill, leaving the possibility Margaret would again be a widow. However, he pulled through and by the end of 1504 was healthier than ever.\n\nIn September of 1505 Philibert welcomed his first child, Philip Charles of Savoy. However, this child was sickly and by November Philip Charles had died, though the exact date is unrecorded and sources claim the child may have died a early as the 28th of September, rather than the commonly referred of 3rd of November. Whatever the date of death, Philip Charles was followed by 2 sisters who did not survive to adulthood: Margaret of Savoy (b.1506: d.1506) and Isabelle of Savoy (b.1507: d.1507). Finally, in 1510, the Duke of Savoy was left a widower for a third time as his bride suffered a miscarriage that left her weak and, finally, dead.\n\nThe death of Margaret of Austria meant the 30 year old Duke was in need of a bride again and he formally requested the hand of Mary of England, who refused. He then applied for the hand of the widowed Juana I of Castile and eventually the widowed Joanna of Naples. With this marriage to Joanna, Philibert would have 3 further children: Louise of Savoy (b.1512), Charles of Savoy (b.1514: d.1516) and Philibert of Savoy (b.1518). Finally with an heir, Philibert began pushing for his younger brother to marry, for the good of the family. Charles of Savoy was nothing if not loyal to his brother and in 1517 married the spinster Princess Anne of Navarre. The two would have 3 children: Joan of Savoy (b.1520), Charles of Savoy (b.1522) and Claudia of Savoy (b.1523).\n\nOf Phlibert's other siblings, Philip (b.1490) became the Bishop of Geneva at the age of 5 and, when in 1510 he showed interest in leaving this position, Philibert made it clear that he was not meant to be anything but a priest. This created tensions between the brothers but ultimately Philip would listen to his elder brother. Meanwhile, his only there surviving younger sibling was Philiberta, who married Giuliano de' Medici, Duke of Nemours. Giuliano married Philiberta in 1515 and unfortunately died the next year, leaving Philiberta a widow. Unperturbed, Philibert replaced his sister on the marriage market and in 1522 she was finally married to Louis, Count of Vaud√©mont, a claimant to the Throne of Naples. This couple would be childless and in 1526 Philiberta died of food poisoning.\n\nUpon the death of Claude of France in 1524, Philibert put forth his eldest daughter, the beautiful Louise of Savoy. Described as a dark paradise by contemporaries for her dark hair and eyes, Louise captured the French King's interest and the widower married the young girl in 1525, when the bride had reached the age of 13. The couple would have 4 children: Catherine de Valois (b.1528: d.1529), Louise de Valois (b.1530), Jean de Valois, Duke of Anjou (b.1533) and Marie Claude de Valois (b.1531). Upon their marriage Louise's uncle, Charles of Savoy, was created Duke of Nemours and moved to enter the French court.\n\nIn 1521 Joanna of Naples died, leaving Philibert a widower again. However, he did not move to immediately remarry again and instead looked for brides that would benefit his son. After being rejected again by the English royal family for a Mary of England, he instead looked towards France. While his sit for Madeline de Valois seemed initially unsuccessful and he began to cultivate a marriage between his son and either Marie or Renee of Guise, in 1528, after the health of Madeline had shown itself to not be robust and the French King feared anywhere else would upset his delicate daughter, the betrothal was agreed to."
