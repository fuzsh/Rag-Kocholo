        "text": "Charlotte of Savoy (11 November 1441[1] – 1 December 1483) was the second wife and only Queen consort of Louis XI of France. She had three surviving children, one of whom succeeded Louis as King Charles VIII of France, with her eldest daughter, Anne of France, acting as his regent.\n\nContents\n\n1 Family\n\n2 Betrothal and marriage\n\n3 Issue\n\n4 Ancestry and Succession\n\n5 References\n\nFamily\n\nShe was a daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy, and Anne of Cyprus. Her maternal grandparents were Janus of Cyprus and Charlotte de Bourbon-La Marche. Her maternal grandmother, for whom she was probably named, was a daughter of John I, Count of La Marche, and Catherine de Vendôme.\n\nShe was one of 19 children, 14 of whom survived infancy.\n\nBetrothal and marriage\n\nOn 11 March 1443, when Charlotte was just over a year old, she was betrothed to Frederick of Saxony (28 August 1439- 23 December 1451), eldest son of Frederick II, Elector of Saxony.[2] For reasons unknown, the betrothal was annulled. Less than eight years later on 14 February 1451, Charlotte married Louis, Dauphin France (future Louis XI), eldest son of Charles VII of France and Marie of Anjou. The bride was only nine years old and the groom twenty-seven. The marriage, which had taken place without the consent of the French king,[3] was Louis' second; his first wife, Margaret of Scotland, had died childless in 1445. Upon her marriage, Charlotte became Dauphine of France.\n\nIn spite of her virtues, Louis neglected her. For example, upon his succession to the throne of France, he immediately abandoned her in Burgundy - where the two had been in exile - to secure his inheritance, leaving the young Queen dependent upon the aid of Isabella of Bourbon, wife of Charles, Heir of Burgundy. A contemporary of Charlotte's noted that \"while she was an excellent Princess in other respects, she was not a person in whom a man could take any great delight\";[4] She was, however, praised for the taste and excellence of her personal library.[5]\n\nOn 22 July 1461, Charlotte became Queen consort of France. She held that position until her husband's death on 30 August 1483.\n\nCharlotte gave her husband eight children; however, only three survived infancy; these were the future King Charles VIII, and princesses Anne of France (better known as Anne de Beaujeu), who would act as regent of the kingdom, and Jeanne of France, who later became the consort of Louis XII of France.\n\nAfter a solitary life, Charlotte died on 1 December 1483 in Amboise, just a few months after her husband's death. She is buried with him in the Notre-Dame de Cléry Basilica [1] in Cléry-Saint-André (Loiret) in the arrondissement of Orléans.\n\nIssue\n\nWith Louis XI of France:\n\nLouis (1458–1460)\n\nJoachim (1459-1459)\n\nLouise (1460-1460)\n\nAnne de Beaujeu (3 April 1461 -14 November 1522), Duchess of Bourbon, Viscountess of Thouars (1468–1473), Regent of France (1483–1491); married Peter II, Duke of Bourbon, by whom she had one daughter, Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon.\n\nJoan of France, Duchess of Berry (23 April 1464- 4 February 1505), was briefly married to King Louis XII of France as his first wife. She did not produce any children, and the marriage was quickly annulled.\n\nFrancis (1466-1466)\n\nCharles VIII (30 June 1470- 7 April 1498), married Anne of Brittany; he died childless.\n\nFrancis (1472–1473)\n\nUpon the death of her daughter, Anne, Charlotte's line became extinct; her granddaughter, Suzanne having died in 1521 without surviving issue.\n\nAncestry and Succession\n\nReferences\n\nFrench royalty Preceded by\n\nMargaret of Scotland Dauphine of France\n\n14 February 1451 – 22 July 1461 Succeeded by\n\nCatherine de' Medici Preceded by\n\nMarie of Anjou Queen consort of France\n\n22 July 1461 – 30 August 1483 Succeeded by\n\nAnne of Brittany"
