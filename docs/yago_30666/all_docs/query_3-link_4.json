        "text": "In March 1443, Friedrich of Saxony, eldest son of Elector Friedrich II and Margarethe of Austria, was engaged to Charlotte of Savoy (future second wife of Louis XI): The marriage contract between \"Federico figlio primogenito di Federico Elettore e Duca di Sassonia\" and \"Carlotta figlia secundogenita di Ludovico Duca di Savoia\" is dated 11 Mar 1443. I read somewhere (can't remember the source) that this was to \"resolve\" territorial questions regarding the duchy of Luxemburg. But this is in and of itself problematic, since Charlotte would've had no rights to the duchy, nor would her betrothed - Margarethe was from the wrong branch of the Habsburgs, while his youngest uncle was married to the elder daughter of Elisabeth of Luxemburg.\n\nMy question is less what if the marriage had happened - although that would've been cool (however I suspect Charlotte would marry Friedrich II's second son since her original betrothed died shortly after she married Louis XI) - but more why it happened. It seems an \"almost ASB-level of odd\" type engagement. Like Lucia Visconti being intended for Olaf of Denmark (the son of Queen Margareta) or Ernst of Austria (Friedrich III's father) being interested in marrying the widowed Brites of Portugal. Both happened but if written into a TL would be dismissed as ASB.\n\nSo...why was Charlotte of Savoy intended for the heir to Saxony? What was the end game here? Money (like Lucia Visconti-Olaf)? Or something else?"
