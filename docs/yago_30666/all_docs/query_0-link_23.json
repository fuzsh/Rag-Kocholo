        "text": "As dauphin, the Spider King was married to Margaret of Scots, but she died a few years later without giving him children. He remarried to Charlotte of Savoy (who was between 8 and 10 years old at the time).\n\nBeyond a mention of a possible marriage to the future Blanca II of Navarre (she's mentioned as having refused the attempts of her father to marry her to a French prince, and Louis is the only one who fits) I can't seem to find any other princess who was considered if Charlotte had married her Saxon betrothed. Were there any? Could there be any?\n\n@isabella @jeandebueil @VVD0D95 @dr evil @The Professor\n\nPrincesses available for Louis to wed:\n\nPortugal\n\nLeonor, Catarina, Joana of Portugal\n\nBeatriz or Philippa of Coimbra (sister to the queen of Portugal, and Beatriz's match to a Cleves second son seems a bit low).\n\nAragon\n\nBlanca II was divorced from Enrique IV in 1453. and Louis married Charlotte in 1451 (so obviously he wasn't the French prince her dad tried to marry her to)\n\nFrance\n\nSo, Orléans, Anjou, Alençon and Burgundy all have nada. Unless the duchesse d'Orléans (Maria of Cleves) has a sister/cousin available that might be considered. Or a daughter of the duc de Bourbon as a Burgundian proxy\n\nBrittany\n\nRichard, Comte de Vertus (grandfather of Anne of Brittany) has 3 daughters available: Marie, Abbess of Fontevrault (who'd be 19yo at the time of Louis' widowing), Marguerite and Madeleine. All chose religious careers OTL, but I'm unsure of how sincere these religious callings were. Their mom is an Orléans princess, so the Orléans might be interested in using one of them as a proxy.\n\nEngland\n\nAnne of York, but for reasons pointed out above, might be difficult\n\nScotland\n\nOne of Louis' late wife's sisters - Annabella and Eleanor are both resident in France at the time IIRC - but I'm not sure Louis will be overly sentimental about a Scots match\n\nLorraine-Vaudemont\n\nI can't find a date of birth for Marie de Lorraine-Vaudemont (sister of Ferry de Vaudemont, OTL husband of Yolande d'Anjou), but she only married the Vicomte de Rohan in 1450 and had one or more (depending on the source consulted, some say all except the husband of Marie de Bretagne, the comte de Porhoët, were the children of Rohan's first wife)\n\nHaven't gone into Germany or Italy since I have no idea which states in Germany might provide a dauphine/queen for France, while anything in Italy besides Naples/Savoy might be regarded as \"rather low\"."
