He is the third youngest [youngest boy] of eight kids. He has four brothers and 3 sisters, and in descending order their names are: Dave [6/4], Jeff [6/4], Phil [10/1], Teresa [4/16], Randy [8/9], Matt [1/29], Susie [3/13], and Sally [9/16]. When he was 12 years old, his sisters took him to auditions for a local play, and it was there that he was bitten by the acting bug. A year later, the family moved to Fairfax, VA, where Matthew attended Hayfield High and continued to involve himself in local theatre as well as school productions. After graduation, Matthew attended the highly accredited North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem. During the summer months, he and a friend worked as street performers in Myrtle Beach, SC doing mime, magic, juggling, improv. Eventually, he joined the Ragamuffin Magic & Mime Company where he earned his first professional paycheck. Soon after graduating from NC School of the Arts, in 1982, with a B.F.A. in Theatre, he followed his star to New York City; it was full of opportunities, and it was still only a train ride from mom. Matthew was not in town long before he was put under contract by ABC and cast as Drew Ralston on Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968) (1982-83). Sadly, Drew was killed in a flower shop on the eve of his wedding. After his year on OLTL, Matt toured with a troupe performing \"Member of the Wedding,\" which soon led to his second soap, Henderson (1951). Matt played Cagney McCleary, with brothers David Forsyth and 'Jeff Meek', from 1983 until the show was canceled in December of 1986. Matt quickly made the role of \"Jack\" his own and won several awards for his portrayal of the popular Days' character including Soap Opera Digest's Best Villain in 1989, a Super Couple (1991) and Best Wedding (1992) award with Melissa Reeves, as well as the Best Comedic Performance award in 1992. Strangely, the birth of Matthew and Christina's daughter Grace seemed to coincide with the birth of Jack's television daughter, Abigail. Little Grace was born on June 15, 1992. Matt left Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965) within the following year, in September of 1993, after six years as Jack Deveraux. He remains the only true \"Jack\" in the hearts of many. In 1997, he and his wife Grace had a second child -- a daughter Emma. During his time off from the soaps, Matt took the opportunity to get involved with live theatre again. He joined the prestigious Interact Theatre Company, headed by former co-star Marilyn McIntyre (ex-Jo Days). He remains active in the troupe, despite his daytime schedule.\n\nPatricia received her first break into acting very soon after she graduated from Stephens College in the mid 1940s. Almost immediately after graduating, she received a contract from Columbia Pictures. They recognized that she had the rare combination of beauty, grace and intelligence that would serve her well throughout her long and well-respected career. When she first signed with Columbia Pictures, she was known as Patricia White. A few years later, in the late 1940s, she met Philip Barry Jr., who was to become her husband. Philip was a television producer-director and the son and namesake of the well-known playwright Philip Barry. By 1950, Patricia began using her married name, Barry. Patricia and Philip shared a long and happy marriage that only ended upon his death on May 16, 1998. During their marriage, they collaborated on several projects. Her husband Philip wrote and she acted in episodes of Matinee Theatre (1955) in the late 1950s. Her husband also produced several television programs that she acted in. They include: The Alcoa Hour (1955), a major dramatic TV series than ran from 1955 to 1957, a well-known TV horror film called Crowhaven Farm (1970), and two made-for-TV biographies, Am Anfang weint man (1978), and Bogie (1980). Patricia Barry may well have been one of the hardest working actresses of her time, having performed over 130 movie and television roles. She died of age-related causes on October 12, 2016, at age 93.\n\nEmmy Award Winning Jennifer Bassey became a contract player on ABC TV's All My Children (1970) in the summer of 1998, after having portrayed borderline nymphomaniac \"Marian Colby\", since the early eighties. Jennifer was born in Chicago. Her first job in entertainment was as a singing Playboy bunny in the very first Playboy Club. She left her bunny ears behind and was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where she got the lowest entrance marks in the history of the academy. Three years later, she graduated from the RADA with honors, finishing just below classmate and future Academy Award-winner, Sir Anthony Hopkins. Jennifer went on to the Big Apple, where she appeared in several Broadway and off-Broadway productions. Some of which included Neil Simon's \"California Suite\"; \"Not Now Darling\", directed by George Abbott; \"In Praise of Love\" with Rex Harrison and \"The Homecoming\" (The Original Royal Shakespeare Production).\n\nHer most recent off-Broadway credits include Molière's \"Tartuffe\" and Wendy Wasserstein's \"Isn't It Romantic\", both staged at the Tribeca Playhouse. Prior off-Broadway appearances included playing \"Katherine\" in \"The Taming of the Shrew\" at the Roundabout Theatre; \"Lady Macbeth\" in \"Macbeth\" at the Stratford Theatre and \"Love Letters\", in which she co-starred with Ken Kercheval.\n\nIn 1983, Miss Bassey won the role of \"Marian Colby\" on All My Children (1970), initially signing for a five-month stint. Due to the incredible popularity of the character, Marian is still going strong nearly 20 years later. Beyond her other dramatic successes, she has enjoyed a flourishing film career that includes such feature films as Waxwork - Reise zurück in der Zeit (1988), Twogether (1992), which also featured both the performing and directing talents of Nick Cassavetes, and Dunston - Allein im Hotel (1996), where in a scene-stealing, skin-revealing moment, she received an orgasmic massage from an orangutan! Jennifer has achieved prime-time success, most recently as a guest star on Law & Order (1990).\n\nOther notable appearances include L.A. Law: Staranwälte, Tricks, Prozesse (1986), Falcon Crest (1981), Murphy Brown (1988), Palm Beach-Duo (1991), Matlock (1986) and Mit Herz und Scherz (1989). In addition to her Emmy nomination for Best Supporting Actress, she also received two Soap Opera Digest Awards, the second of which was shared with her co-star, David Canary, for Favorite Couple. Ms. Bassey shares her life with her longtime companion, Luther Davis, the famous playwright and screenwriter who wrote the book for the shows \"Kismet\" and \"Grand Hotel\". He also wrote and produced \"Timbuktu\", starring Eartha Kitt. In her spare time, Jennifer enjoys outdoor activities and is an aspiring writer, whose latest effort is a new night-time series called \"Nightfall\", which is currently under consideration for production by HBO."
