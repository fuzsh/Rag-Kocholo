        "text": "I was lucky enough to receive an advance copy of the YA anthology We Mostly Come Out at Night: 15 Queer Tales of Monsters, Angels, and Other Creatures edited by Rob Costello. The anthology will officially be out in May 2024, and is currently available for pre-order.\n\nFirst off, a shout-out for the gorgeous cover art by Frances J. Soo Ping Chow; it’s striking, and perfectly suits the tone of the anthology, and even better, each story within the anthology is paired with a lovely header illustration by the artist as well.\n\nOn the whole, the anthology strikes a nice balance of hope and queer joy, while also acknowledging the pain and uncertainty that can be a part of the queer experience. There are stories of angels, gargoyles, cryptids, mer-folk, and fae creatures, which are also stories of young people finding their place in the world, forming new friendships and romances, and learning to embrace their truths. All of the stories are well-written, and there are some truly lovely descriptions and emotional moments within these pages. There are a few in particular that I want to highlight, though all of them are well-worth reading.\n\nBastian and the Beast by Jonathan Lenore Kastin opens the anthology with a lovely, queer retelling of Beauty and the Beast. There are many familiar touch-points from the various versions of the tale, and centering a queer, trans protagonist adds extra resonance to the themes of characters learning to see themselves and others for who they truly are. Other Fish by Alexandra Villasante is a wonderful reimagining of the Little Mermaid, that explores what it means to be the child of immigrants, and how sometimes that comes with the pressure and expectation to perform identity a certain way in order to fit in, and to sanitize your personality and image in order to be more palatable to others.\n\nBe Not Afraid by Michael Thomas Ford is both heartbreaking and hopeful. Willet’s grandmother firmly believes in Mothman – a cryptid who only shows up when trouble is coming, and there is plenty of trouble in Willet’s life. His older brother, Pike, is selling drugs to try to help cover their grandmother’s medical bills, and even so it’s barely enough. Meanwhile Willet’s best friend Burlie skipped town to figure out the growing feelings between the two of them after his parents forbid them from having a relationship. The story does a nice job of looking at what is considered monstrous and what it means to be monstrous and an outsider. Delving into some similar themes, The Freedom of Feather and Fur by David Bowles has a strong voice, and makes good use of its historical setting as Lope searches for his shapeshifting brother in order to take revenge, and discovers some truths about himself and the nature of monsters along the way.\n\nThe House of Needs and Wants by Kaylynn Bayron is a sweet story about a young, queer woman who has been bounced from foster home to foster home. She deeply distrusts the system, and expects to find more of the same in her new home, not to mention the rumors that the house is haunted. Instead, she finds other queer kids and a semi-sentient house that strives to give everyone what they need. It’s a cozy and comforting story, but one that doesn’t shy away from acknowledging pain, or showing how difficult trust can be and how much courage it takes to open yourself up to others. The Girl with Thirteen Shadows by Merc Fenn Wolfmoor is similarly a painful story, but with a hopeful ending. Melanie has more shadows that she should, and is also trying to come to terms with her asexuality. She goes to a doctor who claims he can fix her, that her shadows are killing her, but ultimately learns that he only wants to control the so-called monsters of the world. She finds allies however, and new friends, taking the first steps toward building a community of fellow “monsters”.\n\nHow We Founded Club Feathers at the Discard Depot by Sarah Maxfield is the perfect story to close out the anthology. Ashley lives in a super-conservative town that strictly enforces heteronormativity, especially when it comes to prom. She and her secret girlfriend, Em, along with the other queer kids, are relegated to the sidelines serving punch, counting court ballots, and working the photobooth, rather than getting to enjoy themselves. But a “wicked” fairy godmother/Uncanny Presence known as Carabosse appears to whisk them away to their own prom while putting everyone else to sleep, giving them a lovely moment of queer joy and a safe space to celebrate, while also acknowledging the bravery required to choose your happiness amidst pressure to conform.\n\nAs with my short fiction reading this year, I am woefully behind. I’m still trying to catch up on 2023 titles, but knowing that I will never actually be caught up, I figured I would share a few favorites now.\n\nNovellas\n\nWild Spaces by S.L. Coney is a gorgeous coming of age story about a young man whose family legacy may very well be one of monstrousness. The novella has very much got a Ray Bradbury/Robert R. McCammon vibe to it. It’s tense, eerie, uncertain, and dark, but also filled with wonder. I highly recommend it.\n\nThe Crane Husband by Kelly Barnhill takes on the idea of animal spouses, and explores themes of grief, obsession, guilt, art, and family. Like Coney’s novella, it could also be viewed as a coming of age story. It’s told from the point of view of the daughter of an artist who invites the titular crane husband into the family’s life, forcing the daughter to be the adult and the responsible one in the household as the mother throws herself more fully into her new, unhealthy relationship, which is also wrapped up in her art.\n\nHybrid Heart by Iori Kusano is beautiful, dark, and painful. Rei is an idol, and as such, everything she does is tightly controlled by her manager – what she eats, how she spends her time, everything. Her former partner and friend walked away from their duo act, but Rei feels trapped, unable to see a way out, and things only get worse when her manager introduces a new, young client, making Rei simultaneously feel protective and like her career is being threatened with a “replacement” being held over her to keep her under control.\n\nThe Killing Grounds by Joan Tierney is a sharply-written, fast paced story about a woman who works for one of the passenger truck lines that have replaced airlines for cross-country travel. A man claiming to be a fellow driver hitches a ride with her crew, then attacks the driver and is killed in the resulting fight. Bina is shaken by the incident, but things get even stranger when she comes to believe that the man may have murdered her mother years ago, leading her to uncover a whole history of violence and secrets buried in her hometown.\n\nThe Lies of the Ajungo by Moses Ose Utomi is a rich, secondary world fantasy, in which a young man sets out to find water for his dying village, and specially, for his mother. All his life, he’s been told certain stories about the shape of the world – who his enemies are, what he can expect out of life – but in the desert, he encounters three women who upend his worldview. It’s an excellent exploration of oppression, propaganda, and systems of power, beautifully told.\n\nA Necessary Chaos by Brent Lambert is another story full of rich worldbuilding, where the main characters have been told one thing about the shape of the world and who their enemies are, and gradually discover the truth to be something completely different. It’s slick and fast-paced, a spy vs. spy story, but also a romance, set in a world of magic.\n\nNovels\n\nThe Marigold by Andrew F. Sullivan offers up an excellent blend of sci fi and horror, set in a post environmental collapse Toronto, where multiple types of corruption have taken hold. A phenomenon known as The Wet is taking over the city, which may be merely an advanced kind of mold, or something supernatural, or both. Sullivan does a wonderful job weaving together various points of view to slowly build a picture of the world. Wonderful character-driven eco-horror.\n\nApparitions by Adam Pottle is a deeply unsettling and highly effective read. A young man abused by his father finds himself caught up in the orbit of another charismatic young man at the hospital where he’s taken after escaping his family. The story is both dark and heartbreaking in its exploration of how the system fails people, and what happens when society as a whole looks away from things it would rather not see.\n\nA Market of Dreams and Destiny by Trip Gailey is an incredibly charming queer romance set against the backdrop of the goblin market. There are fae tricksters, clever mortals, and tons of gorgeous worldbuilding. It’s sweet and fun, with occasional moments of darkness, and overall, a highly satisfying read.\n\nYellowface by R.F. Kuang flips over a rock within the world of publishing and exposes an underbelly wriggling with darkness. The novel takes a biting look at competition and jealousy between authors, racism, and the churn of online discourse. There are a few touches of horror, and some genuinely tense and eerie moments, but the fact that the novel is so grounded and feels plausible is what makes it truly terrifying.\n\nSilver Nitrate by Silvia Moreno-Garcia is set in the world of Mexican horror cinema. Lifelong friends Monserrat, a sound editor, and Tristan, an actor, are drawn into a mystery surrounding the unfinished film of an aging director, who also happens to be Tristan’s neighbor. They discover a world of occultism, with film being used to cast magic spells, and find themselves hunted and haunted. The novel is a slow burn, but satisfyingly dark and twisty, with wonderful characters.\n\nStarling House by Alix E. Harrow is an absolutely gorgeous novel about a young woman named Opal struggling to take care of her teenage brother and give him a better existence. She’s dealing with the weight of grief, responsibility, and guilt, and is plagued by dreamed about Starling House, the home built by the eccentric author of the dark children’s book The Underland. She finds herself repeatedly drawn to the house in her waking life as well, and ultimately takes a job cleaning the house under the watchful eye of its guardian, the brooding Arthur Starling. There are touches of the Gothic, hints of cosmic horror, and some very real world horrors as well, and they all blend wonderfully. The illustrations by Rovina Cai are lovely as well – just a really fantastic book on every level.\n\nEvery year for the past several years, I’ve put together a series of posts sharing my favorite reads from that year. And every year, I feel like I’m behind, and there’s tons of stuff that I’ve missed. The feeling is even greater this year. So much of my reading in 2023 was focused on work published in 2022, due to serving as a World Fantasy Award judge. I’m woefully behind on things that came out this year, and I’m frantically trying to catch up. As a result, this list may grow over the next few weeks, but as folks are starting to think about award nominations now, I wanted to share my favorites thus far.\n\nA post focused on novels and novellas is forthcoming, but for now, here are some of my favorite short stories, novelettes, and collections published in 2023!\n\nCollections\n\nSkin Thief by Suzan Palumbo\n\nI’ve been a fan of Suzan’s work since I read her short story “The Pull of the Herd”, and it remains on of my favorites of hers. I was honored to be asked to write the introduction for this gorgeous debut collection, which brings together so many wonderful stories in one place. These are stories that explore queerness, what it means to be monstrous, the choices people make, and the things they embrace or leave behind. The prose is delicious, mixing horror, fantasy, myth, and a deep humanity together, sometimes all in one story.\n\nLost Places by Sarah Pinsker\n\nI’ve been a fan of Sarah Pinsker’s work for a long time as well, and her second collection is just as wonderful as her first. Every time I re-read one of Sarah’s stories, I discover something new. They’re multi-layered and subtle, and somehow, she makes it all look effortless. It’s always a joy to read Sarah’s work, and to see how various stories talk to each other when they’re brought together in a collection.\n\nJackal, Jackal by Tobi Ogundiran\n\nI’ve also been a fan of Tobi Ogundiran’s short fiction since I first discovered it, and I’d been looking forward to this debut collection since it was announced. There were several new-to-me pieces, and it was a pleasure getting to know them, while revisiting those I’d previously read. One of my favorites in the collection was “Midnight in Moscow”, which just so happens to original to the collection and newly-published in 2023.\n\nShort Fiction\n\nLove Sharp Enough to Rend by Leah Ning published in The Dark is a brief, but powerful story about a sea lamia that examines cycles of violence, and at times, evokes The Little Mermaid.\n\nA Small Bloody Gift by Naomi Day published in Fiyah is a dark, painful story with wonderful worldbuilding, looking at the idea of enshrined rituals and “acceptable” sacrifice.\n\nBroodmare by Flossy Arend published in Fantasy Magazine is a beautifully-written and frightening novelette looking at reproductive rights, but also hope and community-building.\n\nOf Gentle Wolves by James Bennett published in The Dark is a wonderful, dark, queer re-telling of Little Red Riding Hood, exploring societal norms, desire, and the nature of monstrousness.\n\nWho the Final Girl Becomes by Dominique Dickey published in Nightmare Magazine is a lovely exploration of slasher tropes as a trans man fears his escape from a massacre will define him forever.\n\nThe Big Glass Box and the Boys Inside by Isabel J.

Hendix published in Analog is a lovely novelette about a young figure skater implanted with experimental medical technology to improve her reaction time and spatial awareness, which ends up transforming her in more ways than one.\n\nSecondhand Music by Aleksandra Hill published in Analog is a subtly eerie story that puts a science fictional twist on the idea of a body part “haunting” the person who receives it as a transplant, as a young violinist receives a highly advanced prosthetic arm from another violinist and finds the woman’s widow taking an unusual interest in her.\n\nSuch is My Idea of Happiness by David Goodman published in Clarkesworld is a novelette with a cyberpunk feel about a man trying to work his way up to a Grade III job where his dreams will be harvested by the upper class Brights, but at least he’ll finally be able to get a decent sleep.\n\nThere Are Only Two Chairs, and the Skin is Draped Over the Other by Alexia Antoniou published in Bourbon Penn is a surreal and eerie story about two young girls who find an empty, seemingly-human skin in the creek behind one of their houses.\n\nBerb by Berb by Ray Nayler published in Asimov’s is a wonderful alt-history where a crashed spaceship in the 1930s changed the course of America after scientists reverse-engineered its technology, leading to unintended consequences.\n\nKwong’s Bath by Angela Liu published in Khoreo is a lovely story about a young girl who begins seeing ghosts after she’s given implants meant to help her improve her family’s station in life.\n\nMemories of Memories Lost by Mahmud El Sayed published in Khoreo is a beautifully-written and bittersweet story of a world where every person must pay a tax of their memories to the aliens who invaded earth, which explores complicated family relationships.\n\nZoraida la Zorra by Ana Hurtado published in The Dark is a beautifully-written story about women and monstrousness and trying to live free of the expectations of others.\n\nJack O’ Dander by Priya Sharma is an excellent, dark story about a figure out of urban legend who appears in the background of online videos, which also explores grief, loss, and survivor’s guilt.\n\nIn the Days After by Frank Ward published in Asimov’s is a painful story about a random group of humans exposed to an unexplained phenomenon that caused them to stop aging, exploring the unintended consequences of near-immortality.\n\nBird-Girl Builds a Machine by Hannah Yang published in Clarkesworld is a lovely time-loop story about a girl whose mother spends her entire childhood building a machine she can’t or won’t explain, and the strained relationship that grows between them.\n\nWaystation City by A.T.
