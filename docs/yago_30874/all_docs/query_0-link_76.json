        "text": "Yearly Reading Lists\n\n2024\n\n1. Alamo All-Stars by Nathan Hale- We were going to the Alamo and I got this book for the boys. It’s a comic history series. Kind of interesting, and surprisingly info heavy. Not my thing, but useful.\n\n2. Relentless by Mark Greaney- Just an average entry in Gray Man series.\n\n3. Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus- Super interesting characters lovingly portrayed. 5 stars\n\n4. Stone Cold Fox by Rachel Coller Kroft- Too many twists… and unlikeable people. But interesting premise.\n\n5. Black Beauties: African American Pageant Queens in the Segregated South by Kimberly Brown Pellum- Catching up on pageants reading for course assignments. Assigned a chapter, so worth it!\n\n6. Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros- Lived up to hype. My scream at the end! I basically wanted to start #2 right away, but tried to pace myself (since #3 not out until end of year).\n\n7. The Spy Coast by Tess Gerritsen- Fantastic characters, looking forward to next entry. Five stars\n\n8. Dream Town by Lee Goldberg- Average entry in Eve Ronin series.\n\n9. Iron Flame by Rebecca Yarros- Didn’t want it to end.\n\n10. Acts of Violet by Margarita Montimore- Interesting presentation, but end unfulfilling.\n\n11. Sierra Six by Mark Greaney- Backstory interesting, though some seemed added in now.\n\n12. Beauty Diplomacy: Embodying an Emerging Nation by Oluwakemi Balogun- Great contribution to work on international pageantry and politics.\n\n13. Miss America’s God: Faith and Identity in America’s Oldest Pageant by Mandy McMichael- Taking on an important and overlooked topic.\n\n14. The Selection by Kiera Cass- Read quickly and it’s like a pretty version of Hunger Games. But short and clearly meant to read the next one quickly.\n\n15. Fodor’s Essential Australia- Guess where I’m going next?\n\n16. Mission Manhattan by James Ponti- #1 and I both read and agree it didn’t really get cooking until 75% through. Want more series story arc, too.\n\n17. Leader of the Pack by David Rosenfelt- My fave in this series in a while, with good lawyering by Andy.\n\n18. The Season: A Social History of the Debutante- Dry at parts historically, but good research and especially in modern times. Assigning last chapters in class.\n\n19. Something Upstairs by Avi- I thought I’d like this because it’s basically set in my neighborhood. My eldest warned me it was terrible and I should have believed him…\n\n20. Fodor’s Essential New Zealand- Possible trip planning!\n\n21. Mother-Daughter Murder Night by Nina Simon- This book sucked me in right away, then it got very slow. But overall interesting characters and premise.\n\n22. The Ghost of Christmas Past by Rhys Bowen- For some reason I hadn’t read a Molly Murphy in a while and I was reminded how much I appreciate this quick-witted historical mystery series.\n\n23. Burner by Mark Greaney- Another good Gray man yarn.\n\n24. The Elite by Kiera Cass- Silly and quick read, less likeable than first.\n\n25. Snowblind by Ragnar Jonasson- I really struggled to get through this honestly.\n\n26. Wild Irish Rose by Rhys Bowen- A little too pat and predictable.\n\n27. The One by Kiera Class- Again, quick and light, but also, these characters are young for all this! Will give this series one more try…\n\n28. The Plinko Bounce by Martin Clark- I really wanted to like this, and parts I found very good/informative as a law student, but by the end I was just a NO.\n\n29. Lone Wolf by Gregg Hurwitz- Another very solid Oprhan X entry.\n\n30. All That is Hidden by Rhys Bowen- Glad I returned to this series.\n\n31. Outofshapeworthlessloser by Gracie Gold- I hate this this book is a NYT bestseller. It’s so contradictory, I just did not find her to be a reliable narrator/writer.\n\n32. The Heir by Kiera Class- Very meh, but I came this far in the series so I will finish it.\n\n33. Career and Family by Claudia Goldin- So impressive in terms of research and great insights.\n\n34. The Maid by Nita Prose- A very interesting new series.\n\n35. On Rotation by Shirlene Obuobi- I wanted to like this more than I did.\n\n36. Unleashed by David Rosenfelt- I’ll just keep trucking on this series. Quick and legal reads with unexpected characters.\n\n37. Wills, Trusts, and Estates by Jesse Dukeminier- I learned many things, maybe not ALL of it useful.\n\n38. Malice by Keigo Higashino- Did not land with me at all.\n\n39. Examples & Explanations for Remedies by Richard Hasen- Needed, but rough stuff.\n\n40. Finlay Donovan Is Killing It by Elle Cosimano- Inventive, if far-fetched. It’ll give it one more book.\n\n41. The Crown by Kiera Cass- Well, let’s just say I finished the series.\n\n42. Hounded by David Rosenfelt- With a twist I didn’t quite see coming.\n\n43. In Sunshine or in Shadow by Rhys Bowen- This one was more of a meh for me. But I appreciated the early Catskills Jewish history.\n\n44. The Chaos Agent by Mark Greaney- Another solid and entertaining Gray man entry.\n\n45. A Short & Happy Guide to the MPT by Katherine Kelly- Not the most useful in the series.\n\n46. Finlay Donovan Knocks ‘Em Dead by Elle Cosimano- The series is a pass for me.\n\n47. The Berry Pickers by Amanda Peters- Beautiful writing and a heartbreaking story, but some parts went very slowly for me.\n\n2023\n\n1. Homicide and Halo-Halo by Mia Manansala- I really want to like this series, but I find the books too long in places and the main character just not very likeable. Still, I give every series three books usually, so… we’ll see.\n\n2. Sudden Death by David Rosenfelt- The protagonist is brash, but smart. I like all the supporting characters. These are quick reads that are perfect for law school.\n\n3. The Boys by Katie Hafner- This book blew my mind. Pandemic is part of it, impressive an author could write a book this good and twisty in that time.\n\n4. The Self-Made Widow by Fabian Nicieza- I still struggle a bit with the main character, but this is a very interesting and likeable series (in a place where I used to live).\n\n5. Killers of a Certain Age by Deanna Raybourn- A really fun romp… especially for any woman who is, or will approach, a certain age. What happens to assassins when they age?\n\n6. Dead Center by David Rosenfelt- Not as good as #4 in the series, but still fun.\n\n7. A Dangerous Business by Jane Smiley- Depressing, but very well-written and plotted, and about an interesting time in history with a female focus.\n\n8. Blackmail and Bibingka by Mia Manansala- I read so many good reviews of this (which is why I started the series). But I still just can’t get into, so it’s a pass for me now.\n\n9. The Accidental Beauty Queen by Teri Wilson- I had to read this for obvious reasons. While parts were ridiculous, it still was a nice, fun read.\n\n10. Nothing More to Tell by Karen McManus- Definitely not McManus’ best. Too many twists that were too convenient.\n\n11. A Merry Little Meet Cute by Julie Murphy and Sierra Simone- I expected a Hallmark-ish book. Nope, this was S-T-E-A-M-Y! But I really liked the characters and would totally read a book like this again.\n\n12. Hidden Mickeys: A Field Guide to Walt Disney World’s Best Kept Secrets- Didn’t do the actual scavenger hunts, but definitely loved the info.\n\n13. Death by Bubble Tea by Jennifer Chow- Unlike the Manansala series, which clearly has some similarities, I liked this first outing much more. Interesting characters and back stories with a lot of potential.\n\n14. Eight Nights of Flirting by Hannah Reynolds- For a teen YA, this was multi-layered. I didn’t love it, but I enjoyed it.\n\n15. Fodor’s Utah- For spring break trip. Lots of good tips and not too big. Although missing a few things we enjoyed.\n\n16. Look Closer by David Ellis- Super twisty (sometimes too much), but a fun twist on a standalone legal thriller.\n\n17. A Short and Happy Guide to the MPRE by Leah Christensen- Hopefully it helps me pass, happily.\n\n18. Dead Eye by Mark Greaney- I think this was my favorite Grey Man entry yet.\n\n19. Play Dead by David Rosenfelt- Still perfect series for me right now- quick, legal, witty.\n\n20. The Last Orphan by Gregg Hurwitz- This latest entry shows why this remains one of my absolute top thriller series. My only complaint is that they don’t come out more often…\n\n21. City of the Dead by James Ponti- My son and I really loved this latest installment in the City Spies series.\n\n22. New Tricks by David Rosenfelt- Wasn’t my favorite entry in this series, but sticking with it.\n\n23. The Big One-Oh by Dean Pitchford- My eldest’s school is doing this as their musical. We read it together and didn’t love it, but think it’s better than the script… In general, he’d call it “goofy.”\n\n24. Lighting Strike by William Kent Kruger- I took my awhile to get into this prequel, but once I did I found it pleasant.\n\n25. The Lemming Condition by Alan Arkin- A quick read with a big message.\n\n26. All the Devils by Livia Lone- Intense, but very good.\n\n27. War Horse by Michael Morpurgo- This isn’t really my type of book, and I didn’t love parts of it, but it does come together at the end. I think this is one of the first books to make my son cry!\n\n28. Pineapple Street by Jenny Jackson- Delicious and delightful. Five stars.\n\n29. All Rise for the Honorable Perry T. Cook by Leslie Connor- I did really like this, despite the fact it’s implausible and had some plot of holes/threads hanging. It really made me think.\n\n30. Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck by Adam Cohen- This was so well-researched and presented in a way that goes deep but also gives you a window to other issues. At times the eugenicists get hard to keep track of, but really appreciated the presentation of Carrie’s story and the take on Oliver Wendell Holmes. This case is a true Shanda.\n\n31. Inkling by Kenneth Oppel- This book is a mind trip. My younger son liked it and he’s not a reader so I read it. But, it’s (delightfully?) weird...\n\n32. Madison’s Music: On Reading the First Amendment by Burt Neuborne- I learned a lot, but this has a definite point of view—so if looking for a comprehensive take this isn’t quite it.\n\n33. The White Lady by Jacqueline Winspear- I enjoyed this, but missed Maisie.\n\n34. The Chaos Kind by Barry Eisler- It had been a bit since I’d read about some of these characters and the book presumes you know, but enjoyable.\n\n35. A Short and Happy Guide to Constitutional Law by Mark Alexander- Speaks for itself.\n\n36. How to Read the Constitution—and Why by Kim Wehle- Good overview.\n\n37. Acing Constitutional Law by Russell L. Weaver- Sending a theme?\n\n38. A Home for Goddesses and Dogs by Leslie Connor- This book made me tear up several times. This writer has a gift for unusual and emotional stories.\n\n39. The Postmistress of Paris by Meg Waite Clayton- Read this for a book event I hosted with the author. A great take on a great woman and part of (recent) history.\n\n40. I’ll Be You by Janelle Brown- Very interesting book, kept me turning the page for sure, though I didn’t love the end.\n\n41. Back Blast by Mark Greaney- I like how this resolved a lot. It’s just very long, but also immersive!\n\n42. Blood Money by Scott Pratt- Meh entry to the series.\n\n43. The Do-Over by Suzanne Park- Just didn’t love these people.\n\n44. Her Deadly Game by Robert Dugoni- An interesting first entry.\n\n45. Gunmetal Gray by Mark Greaney- Solid if unspectacular addition to Gray Man series.\n\n46. Liar’s Beach by Kate Cotugno- Just ok.\n\n47. If the Shoe Fits by Julie Murphy- Totally not believable in any way.\n\n48. Dog Tags by David Rosenfelt- I’m in a rut with series- meh, unspectacular.\n\n49. Fodor’s Essential Hawaii- Spring Break planning! Very useful.\n\n50. Agent in Place by Mark Greaney- The Gray Man actually annoyed me in this book…\n\n51. Hawaii The Big Island Revealed by Andrew Doughty- Ok, but organized in a very strange way.\n\n52. I Have Some Questions for You by Rebecca Makkai- I LOVED her last book, and this one has gotten good buzz, but I just never got this one at all.\n\n53. Romantic Comedy by Curtis Sittenfeld- Wow, I GULPED this down. Spectacular.\n\n54. Frindle by Andrew Clements- My son told me I should read this. He was right! The end especially was poignant.\n\n55. Fox Creek by William Kent Krueger- Still really enjoy this series.\n\n56. Bad Summer People by Emma Rosenblum- Decent, but ugh these people are terrible.\n\n57. Mallory’s Oracle by Carol O’Connell- I just did NOT get this at all. Won’t be continuing with the series.\n\n58. A Lady Has the Floor: Belva Lockwood Speaks Out for Women’s Rights by Kate Hannigan- Not as good as some books like this I’ve read, but shedding light on an overlooked shero.\n\n59. America’s First Woman Lawyer: The Biography of Myra Bradwell- I would have appreciated clearer organization, but I really admire the research that went into this book. What a woman!\n\n60. Hot Pot Murder by Jennifer Chow- I wanted to like this, but it’s just blah and I don’t understand the main character. So, I’m now passing on this series.\n\n61. Lying in the Deep by Diana Urban- Definitely interesting premise, but in the end just ok because too many characters I think, trying too hard to be twisty.\n\n62. Vera Wong’s Unsolicited Advice for Murderers by Jesse Q. Sutanto- This was very good. I hope it becomes a series! Such characters! Was a bit long in parts.\n\n63. The Wishing Game by Meg Shaffer- Such a wonderful yarn. I really loved it.\n\n64. The Collector by Daniel Silva- Classic summer Silva.\n\n65. Behind the Bench: The Hudie to Judicial Clerkships by Debra Strauss- Fingers crossed.\n\n66. Same Time Next Summer by Abigail Monaghan- Still enjoy her writing, solid, just not my favorite (ends too pat).\n\n67. An Evil Heart by Linda Castillo- Just an ok addition to this series. I need personal lives to move forward more!\n\n68. The Kind Worth Killing by Peter Swanson- I wanted to like this, but I just couldn’t. Too twisty with unlikeable people.\n\n69. American Mermaid by Julia Langbein- Super original premise, enjoyable.\n\n70. Robert H. Jackson: New Deal Lawyer, Supreme Court Justice, Nuremberg Prosecutor by Gail Jarrow- What a man! His words stand the test of time- someone to aspire to be like. Not a lot on him, but I learned a lot from this advanced level youth biography.\n\n71. Birds of California by Katie Cotugno- Another interesting premise, involving a former child star. Enjoyable.\n\n72. The Lioness of Boston by Emily Franklin- I love Isabella Stewart Gardner (and her museum, possibly my all-time fave), so I was shocked to find this novel version of her life such a slogggg. But it’s too long and too interior.\n\n73. Mission Critical by Mark Greaney- Solid if unremarkable entry in the Gray Man series.\n\n74. Girls and Their Horses by Eliza Jane Brazier- I wanted to like this, and while I didn’t hate it I didn’t love it. More unique setting, filled with sad people, but decent twists.\n\n75. Loveboat, Taipei by Abigail Hing Wen- See above description! Though characters less believable.\n\n76. Counting the Cost by Jill Duggar and Derick Dillard- I believe it all, but they also come across as a bit manipulatable and manipulative. But important read for me giving long-standing interests! Nothing really surprised me… But I appreciate all the contract discussion.\n\n77. This Bird Has Flown by Susanna Hoffs- Another I wanted to like, but again found people to be just not likeable and who made many questionable decisions.\n\n78. The Golden Spoon by Jessa Maxwell- I love me some British Baking Show, but this was NOT THAT.\n\n79. Amistad’s Orphans: An Atlantic Story of Children, Slavery, and Smuggling by Benjamin Nicholas Lawrance- I read this for a paper and it is certainly in my wheelhouse with lots of impressive original and archival work. That said, it’s a bit repetitive at times- but very useful and worthwhile.\n\n80. One Dog Night by David Rosenfelt- A solid entry in the Andy Carpenter series. Appreciate these are light and quick reads, with quirky characters and some decent legal stuff in there! Feels like I’m only sort of cheating on school work.\n\n81. Traded by Kimberly Knight- Wanted to like this, but I just found the characters so two-dimensional (when clearly they shouldn’t have been!)\n\n82. One Minute Out by Mark Greaney- A very nice addition to Gray Man series on an important topic.\n\n83. Mutiny on the Amistad by Howard Jones- A solid book on an important topic.\n\n84. The Amistad Rebellion by Marcus Rediker- See above, as so similar. I guess if I had to choose, I’d chose the former.\n\n85. The Exchange by John Grisham- I was SO DISAPPOINTED in this book! I was so excited to read a follow-up to The Firm. Wow, lacked all the zest of a usual Grisham.\n\n86. The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry by Gabrielle Zevin- I personally found this to be an emotional read full of interesting people.\n\n87. Children, Parents, and the Law: Public and Private Authority in the Home, Schools, and Juvenile Courts by Leslie Joan Harris- Diverse casebook sources on an important and often overlooked topic.\n\n88. Education Law: Equality, Fairness, and Reform by Derek W. Black- Given the importance of these topics, I feel could have been presented in a slightly more dynamic way, but covers a decent amount of ground for a casebook.\n\n89. Deciding for Others: The Ethics of Surrogate Decision Making by Allen Buchanan and Dan W. Brock- Read for a paper, good discussion if now a touch dated.\n\n90. The Mistress of Bhatia House by Sujata Massey- Bit disappointed by this entry. Pretty slow.\n\n91. I Didn’t Do It by Jaime Lynn Hendricks- Interesting premise, good twists, but somehow just didn’t grab me as I expected.\n\n92. Nuclear Family by Joseph Han- I really did not like this book. Especially the supernatural element.\n\n93. Late Bloomers by Deepa Varadarajan- I really liked these characters. It got a touch ludicrous at the end, but still a great premise.\n\n94. The Stolen Coast by Dwyer Murphy- The writing was really beautiful here, and I liked the characters. But it just oddly never went anywhere for me…\n\n95. Essential Costa Rica by Fodor’s- Helpful to planning a great trip, but would have liked more details in parts.\n\n2022\n\nThe Companion Text to Law School: Understanding and Surviving Life with a Law Student by Andrew MCcClurg- Even useful for law students… starting second semester.\n\nThe Missing America by Kwei Quartey- I really wanted to like this first in a series (new to me setting, cool female lead), but I just found it wayyyy too slow.\n\nOne of Us Is Lying by Karen McManus- Just ok, but I feel like I’m glad I found this author.\n\nWhat if a Fish by Anika Fajardo- I expected to like this more….\n\nIf the Fates Allow: A Short Story by Rainbow Rowell- Maybe the first pandemic-focused fiction I’ve read? Enjoyable.\n\nMarked Man by Archer Mayor- Latest Joe Gunther entry just meh.\n\nThe Cousins by Karen McManus- My first 5-star of year. I liked much more than One of Us Is Lying.\n\nEarly Morning Riser by Katherine Heiny- Interesting characters, very small town, ultimately not really my thing.\n\nFramed by James Ponti- Another series child #1 told me I had to read. I like City Spies better so far…\n\nFallen by Linda Castillo- I’m losing patience with the Kate Burkholder series- get married, stop having so many murders in your small, Amish town!\n\nThe Judge’s List by John Grisham- I liked better than first in the series.\n\nFull Out: Lessons in Life and Leadership from America’s Favorite Coach by Monica Aldama- Pretty much what I expected… Meh. Although I was shocked by the divorce discussion!\n\nSuburban Dicks by Fabian Niceza- Interesting premise, needs to get smoother, but set EXACTLY where I went o graduate school so I’ll definitely be reading #2.\n\nTrue Story: What Reality TV Says about Us by Danielle Lindemann- I blurbed this book! :)\n\nVanished by James Ponti- Still just ok (more middle grade), but will finish third!\n\nDark Horse by Gregg Andrew Hurwitz- The first Orphan X I didn’t love (didn’t love main case or romantic interest twist).\n\nThe Little Book on Oral Argument by Alan Dworsky- Guess what I was preparing for?! Useful.\n\nFearless by Mandy Gonzalez- I can’t lie, I thought I would love this ()kids on Broadway), but I just thought it was ridiculous, especially with supernatural element.\n\nThe Consequences of Fear by Jacqueline Winspear- My favorite Maisie Dobbs in some time!\n\nA Short and Happy Guide to Civil Procedure by Richard Freer- You can tell the kind of reading I was focused on in the spring. This man basically taught me Civil Procedure…\n\nTwo Can Keep a Secret by Karen McManus- She’s a skilled YA thriller writer!\n\nA Short and Happy Guide to Torts by Roger Schechter- I do like this series.\n\nA Sunlit Weapon by Jacqueline Winspear- Not the strongest update to the Maisie Dobbs series.\n\nA Short and Happy Guide to Property by Paula Franzese- Maybe me least favorite in the series, but still helpful!\n\nGated Prey by Lee Goldberg- Still really enjoying this series, which could definitely be a TV series.\n\nOperation Joktan by Amir Tsarfati and Steve Yohn- I really wanted to like this, but it took a very strange religious turn that was not appreciated.\n\nForbidden City by James Ponti- I didn’t feel like this installment moved the series forward as much (my son agreed).\n\nCity on Fire by Don Winslow- I wanted to like this given it is set where I live, but I just couldn’t bring myself to care about these characters.\n\nI Kissed Shara Wheeler by Casey McQuiston- I thought I would love this based on reviews, but in the end I found it just average.\n\nThe Christmas Pig by J.K. Rowling- This is an incredibly creative book. My youngest son LOVES it and told me I had to read it.\n\nThe Agathas by Kathleen Glasgow & Liz Lawson- I am looking forward to the next installment!\n\nThe Lava Witch by Debra Bokur- This series keeps getting better.\n\nSparring Partners by John Grisham- Disappointing for a Grisham, disjointed.\n\nThe Gray Man by Mark Greaney- I read in anticipation of the Netflix movie, and can see how this series does well. I don’t know how this man survives, but curious to keep reading.\n\nThe Hidden One by Linda Castillo- Another good entry in Kate Burkholder series. I appreciated the new setting.\n\nNotes on Your Sudden Disappearance by Alison Espach- This was hard to read given subject matter- but powerful and well-written.\n\nReasonable Fear by Scott Pratt- Just a meh addition to this series.\n\nOn Target by Mark Greaney- I thought the Gray Man series would heat up. Still waiting.\n\nNora Goes Off Script by Annabel Monaghan- I read in a single night. So.Good.\n\nMovieland by Lee Goldberg- Still enjoying this series\n\nA Girl Named Digit by Annabel Monaghan- I found this book really interesting! Good premise.\n\nPortrait of an Unknown Woman by Daniel Silva- I really appreciated that this year’s entry was not about a plot that would kill a lot of people. I also appreciated the art aspect and returning to that part of Gabriel Allon.\n\nThe It Girl by Ruth Ware- My expectations may have been too high based on the reviews, but I just found this ok.\n\nTrust by Hernan Diaz- I can appreciate that the writing in this was good, but WOW what a SLOG.\n\nThe Old Woman with the Knife by Gu Byeong-mo- I was expecting this to be like a Sujata Massey series, but instead it was just so slow. So rarely is a boon DNF for me, but this one was.\n\nDouble Digit by Annabel Monaghan- Well, the second installment in this series was a massive let-down (and appears we won’t get a third even with cliffhanger ending)…\n\nSooley by John Grisham- Holy cow, I did NOT see this twist coming. Not typical Grisham (legal thriller), but so compelling.\n\nThe Last Mona Lisa by Jonathan Santlofer- Just never, ever came together for me.\n\nOpen and Shut by David Rosenfelt- An interesting first entry of an older series. I’ll try another (especially for the law).\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin- This book was a total showstopper for me. One of the best books I have read in years. It resonated with me for the timing, and I loved learning about video game storylines (which I know nothing about), but the writing is just WOW.\n\nThe Candid Life of Meena Dave by Namrata Patel- An interesting premise. Dragged a bit, but very good and strong characters.\n\nSummer Knight by Jim Butcher- This magical world is getting more and more complex. It is sometimes hard to keep the characters and rules straight but still worthwhile.\n\nMidnight at the Barclay Hotel by Fleur Bradley- One of my sons thought I’d really like this, and usually I agree with them, but not with this one! Didn’t like the plot at all.\n\nNight School by C.J. Daugherty- I feel like the “mystery” was not nearly as bad as suggested, which took something away from it for me. But I’ll probably read the second one.\n\nAmerican Founding Son: John Bingham and the Invention of the Fourteenth Amendment by Gerard Magliocca- I learned so much from this book, about a man who is often overlooked, though it does digress too much at points.\n\nJohn Marshall: The Man Who Made the Supreme Court by Richard Brookhiser- Marshall was so influential, interesting, and complex. I really appreciate this biography, which focuses a lot on his judicial opinions as well.\n\nThe Summer I Turned Pretty by Jenny Han- This was ok. I liked the author’s previous series, and I knew this was made into a show. I’m meh on reading the second one.\n\nDue Process of Law: A Brief History- Read for background, just ok (again).\n\nJustifying Intellectual Property by Robert Merges- Read for background on a paper. Very interesting ideas, though maybe a touch too much theory.\n\nMr. Perfect on Paper by Jean Meltzer- Not as good as author’s last one.\n\nOur Wives Under the Sea by Julia Armfield- Whoa, I totally hated this. It was just way too weird for me (I don’t like Sci-Fi)…\n\nWhat’s Prison For?: Punishment and Rehabilitation in the Age of Mass Incarceration by Bill Keller- A slim volume that still covers a lot of ground, usefully.\n\nSuccessfully Competing in U.S. Moot Court Competitions by Larry Teply- In case you are wondering why I read so many fewer books this fall. Long, but useful in parts.\n\nDivided We Fail: The Story of an African American Community That Ended the Era of School Desegregation by Sarah Garland- Well-researched back story on an important and often overlooked SCOTUS case.\n\nThe Schoolhouse Gate: Public Education, the Supreme Court, and the Battle for the American Mind by Justin Driver- Very important book about a very important topic.\n\nAn Honest Living by Dwyer Murphy- Just a total disappointment—and not even feeling the noir aspect at all.\n\nFirst Degree by David Rosenfelt- Still enjoying this series.\n\nBury the Lead by David Rosenfelt- Again, fun and quick read, which helped me with law school studies even!\n\nAll Good People Here by Ashley Flowers- I totally did not see the twist at the end coming. A very interesting read.\n\nGlannon Guide to Evidence by Michael Avery- Well, it did help with Evidence.\n\nArsenic and Adobo by Mia Manansala- An interesting start to a new mystery series.\n\nThe Lion of Mars by Jennifer Holm- Both my boys insisted I read this. A very interesting premise about kids being part of a settlement on Mars.\n\nEvidence by Sydney Beckman- Well, I read it all.\n\nFamily Law in a Changing America by Douglas NeJaime- For a textbook, this has a very good tone.\n\nBallistic by Mark Greaney- A bit much, but enjoyable.\n\nThe First Thing About You by Chaz Hayden- A very strong voice, quick and interesting read.\n\nLove on the Brain by Ali Hazelwood- A bit long, but an interesting premise.\n\nThe Midcoast by Adam White- I don’t feel like this lived up to the hype, but it’s a good yarn.\n\nConflict of Interest by Scott Pratt- I can see how this story will arc, but I’d like the protagonist to be a bit more appealing…\n\nThank You for Listening by Julia Whelan- I wanted to like this more than I did. Perhaps a few too many threads.\n\n2021\n\nHoliday Magic at the Disney Parks: Celebrations Around the World from Fall to Winter by Rebecca Cline et al- This is a huge, heavy book that was gifted to me for the holidays and I loved it. It’s very beautiful and I learned about other Disney parks around the world. If you love Disney and holidays it is must have… especially since no 2020 visit for me.\n\nDoctor Turner’s Casebook by Stephen McGann- I LOVE this show, and when I learned McGann (who stars in the show, and turns out is married to the creator!) is a science writer I wanted to check this out. Definitely worth it if you like the show, otherwise won’t be as interesting.\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton: An American Life by Lori Ginzberg- I so wish I could have met Stanton. Enjoyed learning more about her in this biography.\n\nVery Important People: Status and Beauty in the Global Party Circuit by Ashley Mears- Fascinating inside look at the party circuit, which I definitely have never could/would have been part of… Read for class prep especially.\n\nSlater Mill by Sarah Leavitt- Learning more about the history of my state.\n\nEthnography and Virtual Worlds by Tom Boellstrorff et al- More class prep (Qualitative Methods).\n\nBone Canyon by Lee Goldberg- Still loving this new series, quick and cinematic read.\n\nHybrid Ethnography by Liz Przybylski- More class prep, especially in COVID times!\n\nStories from Suffragette City edited by MJ Rose- Interesting idea, though only some had the through line. I did discover some new authors/books, which was great.\n\nTeaching Effectively with Zoom by Dan Levy- So useful and needed. Highly recommend.\n\nSpending Time by Dan Hamermesh- Hamermash is an economist who always writes on such interesting topics.\n\nFocus Groups by Richard Krueger et al- More class prep, per student request from last year.\n\nNetnography by Robert Kozinets- Can you tell I’m committed to making this class work this semester?\n\nDoing Qualitative Research in Education Settings by J. Amos Hatch- This one didn’t make the cut.\n\nThe Mouse and the Motorcycle BY Beverly Cleary- Boys and I enjoyed this one- definitely holds up.\n\nThe Science and Art of Interviewing by Kathleeen Gerson and Sarah Damaske- This one made the class cut for sure.\n\nThe Last Kids on Earth by Max Brallier- My eldest son LOVED this book and this series. He told me I HAD to read it. I understand why it loves it, though not my thing.\n\nStorm Front by Jim Butcher- I basically started this because James Marsters narrates the audio version (Spike from Buffy) and I love him. But seems like a super interesting series and I plan to do the next one as well!\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer 20 Years of Slaying by Christpher Golden- I enjoyed this, but a lot of trivia was covered in trivia on Amazon. Would have loved more scripts, but great way to close out my seven season viewing.\n\nDeja Dead by Kathy Reichs- Again, post-Buddy, I got into Bones (because of David Boreanaz). I really love it, so of course had to turn to books. Whoa, big letdown. I won’t even read next one…\n\nBefore We Were Yours by Lisa Wingate- In the end I liked this, but was veryyyy slow at start.\n\nThe Silver Arrow by Lev Grossman- My son told me I just HAD to read this, so I did. I get why he loved this a lot, though I probably compared it a bit too much to Snowpiercer. Good for middle grade reader interested in the environment and magic.\n\nThis Is How We Fly by Anna Meriano- I expected to like this, but I felt a bit let down. It’s very long and slow and I didn’t love the people involved. Important topics and interesting way to set them though.\n\nCan’t Even: How Millenials Became the Burnout Generation by Anne Helen Peterson- Peterson always writes so clearly and in this case she synthesizes a lot of social science research with her own investigations. I would have liked some more tangible suggestions about how to improve things for both individuals and society at large.\n\nInez: The Life and Times of Inez Mulholland by Linda Lumsden- I certainly knew of Inez, but I didn’t know a lot about her. I really enjoyed this biography.\n\nAbove the Bay of Angels by Rhys Bowen- I like a series of Bowen’s, so gave this a try. But it was soooo slow, I just never developed a strong relationship with the characters, and the premise wasn’t scintillating to me.\n\nSo We Read On by Maureen Corrigan- Gatsby is my favorite novel, and this was gifted to me a few years ago. I finally made it through! Definitely lots of (interesting) details, and I really appreciated the integration of current teaching, but you have to love Gatsby to read this.\n\nTweet Cute by Emma Lord- Cute premise, though this went on a bit too long. I did like the characters and setting.\n\nRunaway Ralph by Bevery Cleary- We didn’t like this quite as much as the first in the trilogy, but still fun— and good to think about summer camp for the boys.\n\nSideways Stories from Wayside School by Lois Sachar- The boys thought this was goofy and hilarious- especially at the start. Mid-way through it became a little odd, but liked the twist at the end. Not sure if they will be interested in later books though.\n\nRalph S. Mouse by Beverly Cleary- Finished out the trilogy and enjoyed it.\n\nThe Kids Are Gonna Ask by Gretchen Anthony- I really liked the premise of this book. It also made me think about kids trying to find donor biological parents. The podcast within was also a good twist. At times some of the characters seem like characitures, but definitely worth a read.\n\nThe Card Catalog by Library of Congress- Cool book about the rise and fall of the card catalog. I love libraries (duh!), and used a card catalog at my wedding for place cards, theme, etc. So I’m target audience. Some of the key players blurred together in the history, but I liked the chronology. I was less interested in the images, but still interesting.\n\nNumber the Stars by Lois Lowry- My eldest has recently become very interested in World War II and the Holocaust. This is one of few age appropriate books tackling the latter. So much interesting history (I never knew about the handkerchiefs!), important issues to discuss with kids, and just a moving story. I did wish at the end we learned if the friends ever reunited. Nonetheless, worthwhile for anyone regardless and age and five stars (pun intended).\n\nAnd Yet They Persisted: How American Women Won the Right to Vote by Johanna Neuman- I’m finally making a long awaited pilgrimage to Seneca Falls, so catching up on my suffrage reading. Definitely a clear history of suffrage fight, past the 19th amendment as well.\n\nSpoiler Alert: The Hero Dies by Michael Ausiello- I normally wouldn’t read a tragic memoir, but I used to read Ausiello a lot in grad school (my serious Veronica Mars fandom days) and was reminded of him during Buffy deep dive. I had no idea about this part of his story. I found this book very moving, and not just about his husband’s illness. It moved quickly (no shock, he’s a great writer) and I truly sobbed even though I knew what would happen— while I read in the middle of the night. Recommend for sure.\n\nThe Miscalculations of Lightning Girl by Stacy McAnulty- I really liked this. Cool premise (if far-fetched) and all the characters were complex. I read it fairly quickly and liked the ending.\n\nLady Tigers in the Concrete Jungle: How Softball and Sisterhood Saved Lives in the South Bronx- A lot of people and topics covered here, and at times difficult to sort them out, but a good example of how sports transfers, especially for girls.\n\nKeep on Pushing: Hot Lessons from Cool Runnings by Devon Harris- This book was a bummer. Watched Cool Runnings with kids recently and wanted to know more about what actually happened. This book shifts all over the place in terms of timing, and it’s definitely hard to separate out different parts. I’d pass in future unfortunately.\n\nFirefly Lane by Kristin Hannah- Little long, made me cry for sure. I didn’t like everyone, but it’s powerful.\n\nA History of America in Ten Strikes by Erik Loomis- I learned about strikes, but not in terms of American history so much. At times it was had to keep some strikes within chapters straight (though I listened, so may be part of it). I wanted the history and this was more of an argument for specific interpretation/action.\n\nHoles by Louis Sachar- I know many love this book, but I just found it both a little disturbing and then just way too coincidental. My boys didn’t love it either.\n\nThe Boy in the Striped Pajamas by John Boyne- The boys and I were like, “How could this boy be so unaware?!” I mean it’s a different take, but it’s not exactly revelatory in terms of perspective…\n\nThe Castle in the Attic by Elizabeth Winthrop- At first we liked this, then he traps the babysitter and we were like, “This got very weird.” Lots of unanswered questions. None of us recommend.\n\nBones: The Official Companion by Paul Ruditis- So I got realllllyyyy into Bones (I feel like I’ve lost cool, way smarter than me friends since finishing the 12 seasons). I really liked this behind-the-scenes volume and the color images are beautiful.\n\nHomer Price by Robert McCloskey- For the first half we loved this- especially skunk angle (we have a skunk issue at our house). But then took a bit of a sexist turn. I know it’s older but…\n\nSia Martinez and the Moonlit Beginning fo Everything by Raqual Vasquez Gilliland- This was an interesting book. It was clear from start it is SciFi. But it blended in well. I liked all the characters, too. In end somehow didn’t gel for me completely, but worth a read.\n\nThe Cricket in Times Square by George Selden- Great little book, so creative. Boys felt sad at end, but love it evoked emotion. Will be listening (discovered listening in road trips!) to next installment for sure.\n\nSia Martinez and the Moonlit Beginning of Everything by Raquel Vasquez Gilliland- I’m not usually a big scifi person, so I vacillated on this book. However, it was always clear about its genre, so in the end it’s a 4-star for me. I definitely wanted to know what happened and found the characters very original, while rooted in contemporary events and scifi, romance, and YA. Definitely worth it for something different.\n\nInterior Chinatown by Charles Yu- I had read rave reviews of this, so I went in with high expectations. I really like the creative in the format, but I never felt emotionally invested…\n\nThe Genius of Women: From Overlooked to Changing the World by Janice Kaplan- I did a panel with the author so wanted to be well-versed! Lots of interesting women spotlighted and thoughts about why women’s achievements are often overlooked.\n\nWe Begin at the End by Chris Whitaker- Another one I had read raves of, but I had a very hard time getting into this. It’s heartbreaking, for sure, but I found the pacing very slow until I was at least mid-way through. If I hadn’t seen so many great reviews, I may have abandoned. In the end, it was just ok for me.\n\nProdigal Son (Oprhan X series) by Gregg Hurwitz- Honestly, I just love this series. I love all the characters and the nuance. And the backstory in this one really added depth. And what a cliffhanger!\n\nCoup D’Etat by Ben Coes- I liked this second installment much more than the first. It’s fun escapism and I’m looking forward to the third.\n\nDark Moon by Deborah Hawkin- For my birthday/Mother’s Day my eldest picked out the first of four series of legal thrillers, as he knows I love to read and he’s very excited I’m starting law school. This first one was ok, but I’m not so excited about the series format of different people featured.\n\nAn Innocent Client by Scott Pratt- This gifted first-in-a-series was a success and I’m looking forward to the second! The characters all seem complicated but likeable and I think I will find the TN setting interesting.\n\nThe Last Refuge by Ben Coes- Still enjoying this series and look forward to next.\n\nThe Testament by John Grisham- Just meh to me for a Grisham. I typically find his storytelling more compelling.\n\nBig Summer by Jennifer Weiner- Interesting premise, just didn’t like the characters very much.\n\nMother May I by Joshilyn Jaskon- I normally love her stories but this one didn’t do it for me.\n\nFool Moon by Jim Butcher- Still interesting, sometimes a lot of characters, but I’ll still stick with it.\n\nSami’s Sleepaway Summer by Jenny Meyerhoff- This came as a PJ Library book and since both boys going to sleepaway (Jewish) camp for first time I decided to read as well, and this was a very sweet book.\n\nDial A for Aunties by Jesse Q. Sutanto- I so rarely give a book 1 star, but I just DID NOT LIKE THIS. I didn’t like the characters, I thought it was way too long, didn’t like core problem. SKIP.\n\nWhat’s Not to Love by Emily Wibberly and Austin Siegemund-Broka- I was not feeling this book, like the previous one. While I pushed through Dial A, I just decided to not finish this book. First time I’ve done that in a very long time.\n\n1L of a Ride by Andrew McClurg- I found this very useful- and can see I’ll keep using it over the next three years as I become a 1L myself!\n\nWhile Justice Sleeps by Stacey Abrams- I wanted to love this, of course. It just is very convoluted with a lot of characters.\n\nThe Zen of Law School Success by Chad Noreuil- I didn’t enjoy this nearly as much as 1L of a Ride, but it wasn’t a total waste.\n\nSurviving Savannah by Patti Callahan- A very interesting story. I liked the setting and history. I just didn’t find it compelling and page turning, but definitely good.\n\n1000 Days to the Bar by Dennis J. Tonsing- Also not as good as 1L of a Ride, and very long, so ultimately I might say this is a pass.\n\nIn Good Faith by Scott Pratt- Second entry in new series for me, Joe Dillard, about a former defense attorney turned DA. Good stuff.\n\nStrategies & Tactics for the First Year Law Student by Lazar Emanuel et al- Sending a theme? I’d say this is the second most useful of the four pre-law school books I read.\n\nThe Cellist by Daniel Silva - Every summer I wait for the new Gabriel Allon. I thought this was the best entry in years. Five stars!\n\nInjustice for All by Scott Pratt- I found this latest Joe Dillard installment a little too twisty, but still good.\n\nThe Bone Field by Debra Bokur- Bit better than first entry. I’ll keep trying this series set in Hawaii.\n\nEye for an Eye by Ben Coes- My least favorite Dewey Andres thus far. I’ll take a break, but surely be back.\n\nMalibu Rising by Taylor Jenkins Reid- The writing is clearly great, as is the plotting. I just did not LIKE a bunch of them…\n\nCity Spies by James Ponti- My nine-year-old was really, really into this book and insisted I read it so we could discuss. He was right! It’s a great middle-grade book. Definitely recommend. He’s now read second installment and I will soon.\n\nGrave Peril by Jim Butcher- It may be because I listed to this (HEY, James Marsters…) but there were a lot of characters and it seemed to go on and on. But I know this series has a cult following so I’m not giving up yet.\n\nHooked by Sutton Foster- A fun book (I listened- though sadly she didn’t sing) by someone who I have admired for a long time. She has certainly lived an interesting life!\n\nThe Whistler by John Grisham- Wow, so disappointed by this Grisham. Characters not very interesting, plot very meh. Can’t recommend it.\n\nGetting to Maybe: How to Excel on Law School Exams by Richard Michael Fischl- I feel like in theory this should count as more than one book. Certainly one reason my total reading this year was down in terms of completed book reading!\n\nWell-Behaved Indian Women by Saumya Dave- It took me a long time to get through this book. I think part of it is that it was very long, and part of it is that it was just meandering at times as characters seemed to be dealing with things real-time.\n\nAfter the Bloodbath: Is Healing Possible in the Wake of Rampage Shootings? by James Diamond- Written by my Criminal Law professor! A different take on mass shootings for sure.\n\nSo We Meet Again by Suzanne Park- I just found this book unrealistic- especially the business side of the story- and just too formulaic in other ways.\n\nThe Box in the Woods by Maureen Johnson- Enjoyable entry in the Truly Devious series, especially in a new setting.\n\nThe Guncle by Steven Rowley- This is a very sweet book. People painted very well, flaws and all. Recommend!\n\nMadam President: The Secret Presidency of Edith Wilson- A part of our history I did not know much about. Read quickly for a book of this type.\n\nFeminist City: A Field Guide by Leslie Kern- I thought this would be right up my alley (especially in COVID times), but the author makes a lot of assertions without always providing facts or data- which I expect in a book like this. Ok, it sounds cool to say skyscrapers are ejaculating manhood, but I need more than a provocative statement to be convinced… (Also I listened to this and the narrator inserting endnote numbers was very distracting.)\n\nA Short and Happy Guide to Contracts by David Epstein, Bruce Markell, and Lawrence Ponoroff- Contracts turned out to be my favorite class in 1L fall. I read several from this series to prep for finals, though did not quite complete a full one. This one I came closest to doing so and I really liked it.\n\nEvery Reasonable Doubt by Pamela Samuels Young- I really wanted to like this. But the people were just so two-dimensional. Not the right series for me.\n\nWhat Were the Twin Towers? by Jim O’Connor- The boys and I read this to prepare for an NYC trip. I actually learned a LOT about how the Towers were built. Definitely recommend for anyone with young-ish kids visiting Ground Zero.\n\nThe Bombay Prince by Sujata Massey- I normally LOVE books by this author, but I just couldn’t get into this one. It took me forever to finish and I almost gave up. Also did not even find the ending satisfying…\n\nGolden Gate by James Ponti- I did not like this installment as much as the first, but still good. I don’t want to spoil anything, and I’m waiting for third in trilogy to release, but I have a plot issue with this book.\n\nThe Matzah Ball by Jean Meltzer- This book was a weird read for me. It’s like I didn’t love it, yet I couldn’t stop reading/put it down. On the one hand I think I wanted it to end, but I did enjoy it. Kind of like the Hallmark/Lifetime Christmas movies it focuses on…\n\nModern Liberty: And the Limits of Government by Charles Fried- I discovered Prof. Fried in a 0L series and have been waiting for the time to start some of his work. What a mind!\n\n2020\n\n1. Over the Top: A Raw Journey to Self-Love by Jonathan Van Ness- I love his personality, but it’s harder to translate on the page. The most annoying thing was repeated use of Russian pseudonyms.\n\n2. Feminasty: The Complicated Women’s Guide to Surviving the Patriarchy Without Drinking Herself to Death by Erin Gibson- This was ultimately meh for me.\n\n3. American Royals by Katharine McGee- A really interesting premise— if Washington had become King and what monarchy would look like today. Fun and thought-provoking (first in what appears to be a YA series/trilogy).\n\n4. One True Loves by Taylor Jenkins Reid- I really enjoyed this. Super intriguing premise, even if conclusion was obvious.\n\n5. Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes (second edition) by Robert Emerson et al- I read the first edition like 15 years ago, but read this newer one for new class this semester (Qualitative Research Methods).\n\n6. You Throw Like a Girl by Rachele Alpine- A book about a sports-loving girl who competes in a festival pageant. Right up my alley. Solid middle grade book.\n\n7. Before and After the Book Deal by Courtney Maum- Very, very helpful advice for those publishing books (though slightly fiction heavy).\n\n8. The Prized Girl by Amy Green- A thriller about a child pageant competitor— again, up my alley. Was good, but many, many twists (perhaps one or two too many).\n\n9. Start by Believing by John Barr and Dan Murphy- A more narrative version of the Larry Nassar abuse. The story is infuriating— partly because it’s long (and in real life shouldn’t have been!)— but well reported version.\n\n10. I’m Not Really a Waitress by Suzi Weiss-Fischmann- Wow, a woman with such an interesting life who became such a business and beauty success. Inspiring, even though it jumped around a lot.\n\n11. American Dirt by Jeanine Cummins- I had to read this controversial book for myself. So let me tell you, it’s long, but the story is GRIPPING. I would never read it and think it was “accurate,” despite being deeply moved. The end with the author’s note gets cringey, but if that hadn’t been included…\n\n12. Laud Humphreys: Prophet of Homosexuality and Sociology by John Galliher- Read this as background when I taught about Tearoom Trade. Humphreys was surely a character. This biography moves around a lot, and wouldn’t have broad interest, but worked for what I needed it for.\n\n13. The Long Call by Ann Cleeves- The writing was nice, but I never really felt fully immersed or gripped by the story. It lacked urgency I think.\n\n14. We Contain Multitudes by Sarah Henstra- A very interesting way to tell such a nuanced story. Really enjoyed this, even if I don’t think intense teen love like that can last.\n\n15. New Kid by Jerry Craft- I know this has won a whole bunch of awards, but I just didn’t get it. Nothing new at all in story, and I’m not generally a comic reader, so maybe that’s why?\n\n16. The Hand on the Wall by Maureen Johnson- I didn’t love this end to the trilogy. Way too convoluted.\n\n17. Into the Fire by Gregg Hurwitz- My first 5-star book of year. I just love this Orphan X series. It’s thrilling, it’s character-driven, it’s compelling. But now need to keep those relationships moving forward.\n\n18. Why We Can’t Sleep: Women’s New Midlife Crisis by Ada Calhoun- RARELY have I read a book where I would say, “Yes” so much to what was written. While I am very, very tail end of Gen X (born 1980) this book is pretty close to my life right now. But it never delivered on giving me tips. I felt like at end I had no real directive or ability to change my life. It reinforced others feel same way, but that made me feel worse and not better in this case!\n\n19. The Bullet by Mary Louise Kelly- This was pretty eh. Interesting premise, but not enough suspense.\n\n20. The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin- Ok, this was a children’s “classic” I’d never read. Well, now I know why! Too many characters, not very interesting. SUCH a disappointment.\n\n21. 10 Blind Dates by Ashley Elston- I wanted to like this, but my goodness, the girl was a senior in high school— the family did not need to be finding suitors for the protaganist. Good characters though.\n\n22. The Tyrant’s Daughter by J.C. Carleson- Another interesting premise. Didn’t end quite how I expected. But in the end, just average.\n\n23. The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane by Kate DiCamillo- I’ve read rapturous endorsements of this story, and I’ve read other things by the author, but I just didn’t get the hype. I felt little to no emotional connection. Maybe just a reminder I don’t love middle grade lit?\n\n24. Legacies of the War on Poverty edited by Martha Bailey and Sheldon Danziger- Read this for course prep, but really liked the counter-intuitive argument and findings.\n\n25. Double Standard: Social Policy in Europe and the United States (4th edition) by James W. Russell- A good one stop shop on this issue (and it keeps being updated). The short chapters are good to assign, though the way back coverage of some issues (Middle Ages) is less useful from a policy perspective.\n\n26. Why Americans Hate Welfare by Martin Gillens- Good, empirical coverage of an important topic.\n\n27. The CQ Press Writing Guide for Public Policy by Andrew Pennock- This is a five-star book for me. Super useful, clearly written, lots of practical applications.\n\n28. A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder by Holly Jackson- This YA novel was WAY too long and the end was just too convoluted.\n\n29. The Library of Lost Things by Laura Taylor Namey- A serviceable YA book.\n\n30. Yes No Maybe So by Becky Albertalli and Aisha Saaed- I liked the premise it was just SO dramatic.\n\n31. Loyalty by Ingrid Thoft- The first in the Ingrid Thoft (female PI in Boston); very promising series.\n\n32. The Boxcar Children by Gertrude Chandler Warner- I reread as getting my sons into this during the pandemic. Doesn’t hold up as I remembered (though note I remembered it all these years!), but the boys love it (so works for its target audience still, clearly).\n\n33. Chosen Ones by Veronica Roth- I can’t say I really like any of the protagonists, but Roth’s imagination (story, telling, formats) is so very impressive.\n\n34. Red, White &Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston- Super interesting premise, liked the characters (though some got a bit convoluted), sex scenes were WHOA steamy— just thought it was a bit too long honestly. Some of it could have been condensed or left out. But definitely worth a read!\n\n35. Lost Hills by Lee Goldberg- I really, really liked this. Read quickly, was interesting, seems like a great new character series.\n\n36. 100 Years of Miss America by The Press of Atlantic City- Quick read, a few pictures I hasn’t seen before. If you are into this sort of thing you will want the book, but it won’t interest anyone else…\n\n37. Delta Style: Eve wasn’t a size 6 and neither am I by Delta Burke- A funny, genuine, and behind-the-scenes take on her career and style tips. Really enjoyed this!\n\n38. Camino Island by John Grisham- Haven’t read one of his in some time, but was quickly reminded why he is so successful. He knows how to write a an interesting (legal) thriller that is for sure.\n\n39. Under the Rainbow by Celia Laskey- I was immediately drawn in by the voice of the author, the story, the different chapters on different characters. It’s a winner, baby.\n\n40. China Rich Girlfriend by Kevin Kwan- I read Crazy Rich Asians a few years ago, but watched the movie recently, so decided to read #2. WAY too many characters, not even all tied together well. Many people just not likeable. I didn’t really like it, but I’ll probably still read third because that tends to be how I am…\n\n41. Identity by Ingrid Thoft- I liked the Fina series so much I already read 2. Definitely recommend this series.\n\n42. The Rooster Bar by John Grisham- Didn’t really like this one both because I didn’t feel much suspense and I really didn’t like the main characters.\n\n43. Josh and Hazel’s Guide to Not Dating by Christina Lauren- This was cute; enjoyable read (somewhat steamy).\n\n44. Little House in the Big Woods by Laura Ingalls Wilder- This did not hold up quite as well as I remembered— was reading to see if my eldest would be interested. I though he would given the pandemic but after about 30 pages he declared it just “too boring.” Will try again.\n\n45. The Never Game by Jeffrey Deaver- New series, still not sure (mainly if I like protagonist and premise), but moved quickly.\n\n46. Beatiful on the Outside by Adam Rippon- A deeper dive than many athlete memoirs, though not about the sport itself (I always dislike when an athlete is just like, “Yeah, I was good and liked it…”). I may like him a touch less after this though? Some seemed a bit smoothed over— like relationship with parents.\n\n47. What I Like About Me by Jenna Guillaume- Pageant themed by YA so you know I had to read it! Liked setting in Australia as different.\n\n48. Dreamers and Schemers: How an Improbable Bid for the 1932 Olympics Transformed Los Angeles from Dusty Outpost to Global Metropolis by Barry Siegel- Well researched and interested for sports aspect, but never convinced me completely why I should compare (beyond sports and urban politics aspect).\n\n49. Rich People Problems by Kevin Kwan- I muscled through this trilogy. Why? Honestly, I don’t know. One of the few cases where the movie (of first one) better than book and it sucked me back in…\n\n50. Brutality by Ingrid Thoft- Still loving this series. Great main stories, good side stories, and varied characters and relationships.\n\n51. Looking for Alibrandi by Melina Marchetta- Read this after What I Like About Me author recommended it. Didn’t really enjoy it— characters especially.\n\n52. The Room of White Fire by T. Jefferson Parker- Another series didn’t love premise. Not going to try #2.\n\n53. Camino Winds by John Grisham- Really enjoyable and interesting, multi-faceted. Wish there would be another in this mini-series.\n\n54. Parachutes by Kelly Yang- The topic here is different and I enjoyed it. The yawning disparities are almost too much to be believed, but fascinating and important.\n\n55. Hid from Our Eyes by Julia Spencer-Fleming- Waited so long for this entry (didn’t know the author suffered so much personal tragedy) and enjoyed it. These characters keep getting more and more complicated though, so not sure how sustainable this was.\n\n56. The Possible World by Liese O’Halloran Schwarz- This book is weird. I guess it’s magical realism? I liked the Rhode Island angle, but characters not super compelling.\n\n57. This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession by Daniel Levitin- Super interesting, though not compelling/page turner.\n\n58. The Red Lotus by Chris Bohjalian- Weird time to be reading a book about a pandemic… Wasn’t bad but wasn’t great. Main mystery weird/not compelling.\n\n59. All-of-a-Kind Family by Sydney Taylor- Re-reading again to screen for kids. So sad not nearly as great as I remember; deciding no for kids at moment.\n\n60. You Should See Me in a Crown by Leah Johnson- I struggled with this one as it was a quick read and I was into it, and I liked most of the characters, but in the end it was just so (too neatly?) wrapped in a nice bow.\n\n61. East Coast Girls by Kerry Kletter- I didn’t love this. The teenage trauma this group experienced was profound, but didn’t make up for how unlikeable many of them were as young woman. Narrative not terribly compelling either.\n\n62. Duplicity by Ingrid Thoft- I really love this Fina Ludlow series— just said I have to wait for another addition.\n\n63. The Goodbye Man by Jeffrey Deaver- The Colter Shaw series grew on me in this installment, so I will check out the third when it’s released.\n\n64. From the Desk of Zoe Washington by Janae Marks- Wow, loved this book so much. So honest and interesting, tackling real and important issues for kids.\n\n65. Name Drop by Ross Matthews- I liked the premise of this book, and the inclusion of recipes, but some of the stories/chapters were less interesting than others, which led to some skimming.\n\n66. The Distant Dead by Heather Young- The writing is nice here, but the story was a little too mystical for my tastes.\n\n67. The Holdout by Graham Moore- Lots of twists and turns, but a worthwhile read about the legal system from a different perspective.\n\n68. Little Shaq by Shaquille O’Neal- Doing some of the rising third graders summer reading with him. This one felt a bit basic to both of us, though with a nice message.\n\n69. Roll with It by Jamie Sumner- I really enjoyed this book and think protagonists with a physical disability are often overlooked. Liked the new friends she made and the baking angle as well.\n\n70. Calvin Coconut: Trouble Magnet by Graham Salisbury- Both the boy and I really enjoyed this book (for school). Calvin is a real character, with lots of other interesting people in his life. His adventures were more multi-layered as well. We decided to try the second entry in this series soon!\n\n71. The Bell Ringers by Henry Porter- This book went on and on and on, which didn’t help given so many characters (not all of whom were very pleasant). Interesting to learn more about Parliament, but you could probably do that in other ways…\n\n72. Dear Sweet Pea by Julie Murphy- A sweet story, not bad and not amazing, but a nice read about middle school travails.\n\n73. Being Teddy Roosevelt by Claudia Mills- WOW, this book kind of blew my mind. Both my boys really loved it, and learned a lot. A lot to learn about history and, most importantly, friendship and social differences. Thanks again to school reading for introducing us to a new author!\n\n74. Violet Mackerel’s Natural Habitat by Anna Branford- This school reading book was less of a hit, with both of us. Felt very dry, neither emotional nor compelling.\n\n75. The Order by Daniel Silva- My summer ritual reading. Always enjoyable. I liked the different topic this year, plus less death and imminent destruction. Sets up next stage. Looking forward to more Shamron next summer!\n\n76. Run You Down by Julia Dahl- I still find this series interesting, and I’ll be curious how Rebekah’s relationship with her mother develops. One critique is an awful lot of coincidences…\n\n77. Beezus and Ramona by Beverly Cleary- The boys and I most definitely feel Ramona is annoying. So annoying they may not read more? Not what I was expecting/recalling.\n\n78. Online Marketing for Busy Authors by Fauzia Burke- Definitely what I needed with new book coming out!\n\n79. Outsider by Linda Castillo- I liked that the crime wasn’t within the Amish community and got some backstory on Kate more. Need Kate’s relationship to officially solidify though.\n\n80. Lulu and the Cat in the Bag by Hilary McKay- This was another of our least favorite stories. Just didn’t seem that interested, though liked the twist at the end and the familial relationships.\n\n81. Faith: Takng Flight by Julie Murphy- I definitely had very high expectations for this book given the author. But there were SO many story lines, characters, twists, etc. I know it was a set up for a series, but it felt unsatisfying.\n\n82. The Fire Thief by Debra Bokur- I found this a bit uneven, but it’s first in series so that makes sense. Was slow, but I found main characters very interesting so will give #2 a try when it comes out!\n\n83. Betsy-Tacy by Maud Hart Lovelace- I re-read from childhood to see if boys would like. I am passing for them, was still ok for me.\n\n84. If You Want to Write by Brenda Ueland- This came highly recommended, but I DO NOT GET IT. Nothing practical at all.\n\n85. Lulu and the Brontosaurus by Judith Viorst- Quick (kid summer) read— very imaginative and good themes to discuss (being spoiled, helping others).\n\n86. The Gold-Threaded Dress by Carolyn Marsden- I found this very moving, and interesting. Excellent kid summer reading choice.\n\n87. Stink the Incredible Shrinking Kid by Megan McDonald- At first I didn’t like this, and the boy had to convince me to read faster. But in the end I liked Stink and all the different facets included, like history, in the book. He loves this series.\n\n88. The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett- I know this book has been getting rave reviews but I didn’t love it. I especially thought one of the major plot devices was clunky (falling in love with trans man). I did read it quickly wanting to know what happened, but that didn’t mean I enjoyed it (I felt similarly about Crawdads…).\n\n89. Stand Up, Yumi Chung by Jessica Kim- Found this very refreshing and original. A bit dramatic, but definitely worth it.\n\n90. The Year of the Dog by Grace Lin- Final summer reading book and it blew me away! Loved the genre-busting elements, stories within stories, illustrations, just all of it. Definitely going to read rest of this series!\n\n91. Evergreen Tidings from the Baumgartners- These people are very human. I enjoyed the parts that focused on the Baumgartners most, and one subplot super zany, but still quick and enjoyable.\n\n92. Pizza Girl by Jean Kyoung Frazier- Whoa. This was heavy. And weird. One of those I got to end and felt icky. I know it’s been buzzy, but I can’t quite recommend.\n\n93. The Remarkable Journey of Coyote Sunrise by Dan Gemeinhart- I enjoyed this book- a little far-fetched, but emotional with interesting characters. Worth a read for sure.\n\n94. The Beauty in Breaking by Michele Harper- Was lucky to do a panel with the author. Will definitely be of interest to those interested in medicine!\n\n95. Double X Economy by Linda Scott- Also got to do a panel with this author! Very definite point of view on women’s contribution to the economy.\n\n96. They Wish They Were Us by Jessica Goodman- I wanted to like this. But the main character(s) aren’t super likeable. I was a tiny bit surprised by twist about halfway through.\n\n97. Conviction by Julia Dahl- I still like the series, but the coincidences with characters is just getting to be too much.\n\n98. Such a Fun Age by Kiley Reid- Ok, I did find this compulsively readable. But, again, I have to like the characters to enjoy the book. Still, four stars.\n\n99. Rachel’s Roses by Ferida Wolff- My son got this as his PJ Library book for the month and we both read it. Started off well, but we both felt it got very slow in the middle, but finished strong.\n\n100. Tune It Out by Jamie Sumner- FIVE stars. Loved this. Deep and complex, emotional and complicated. Issues of class, parenting, and so much more. Highly recommend.\n\n101. The Orphan’s Guilt by Archer Mayor- Not the best entry in the series- premise was weak to me and worked hard to involve many team members- but still a solid read.\n\n102. The Three Mrs. Wrights by Linda Keir- I found this read really held my attention. Recommend.\n\n103. The Beekeeper’s Apprentice by Laurie R. King- I discoverd this series in graduate school. I want to start reading it again, but know I need a refresher on teh Russell Kanon, so I’m starting at the beginning. Starts slower thanI remembered, but still good fun.\n\n104. Prairie Lotus by Linda Sue Park- I loved this reimagining of Little House books- what would it be like for a half-Chinese girl in the Dakotas? In end a touch saccharine, but really great and definitely recommend.\n\n105. Cover Your Tracks by Daco Auffenorde- I’d been waiting to read this and was exciting as the premise was intriguing. But it just didn’t work for me. I thought the characters unlikeable and the twist just too convenient.\n\n106. A Monstrous Regiment of Women by Laurie King- Continuing my re-read of Mary Russell series… Always find budding romance between them squicky, but so it is!\n\n2019\n\n1. The Kizuna Coast by Sujata Massey- I missed this latest Rei book when it was released. It’s been awhile and it was like visiting an old friend. I would have liked a bit more thriller, but I did like that it was set in the midst of a real world tragedy and that drove the story. Worth it for existing fans for sure!\n\n2 . The Honest Truth by Dan Gemeinhart- Truly a book that I could not stop reading once I started. My heart almost couldn’t take it— and my eyes and blubbering showed it. I think this is technically middle grade, but I loved it (rare for me). My boys should probably read this in a few years.\n\n3. Lethal White by Robert Galbraith (aka J.K. Rowling)- This was long. Probably should have been shorter. And a bit too convoluted honestly. I still enjoyed it. But need some relationship resolution in next one!\n\n4. My Jewish Year: 18 Holidays, One Wondering Jew by Abigail Pogrebin- I got this from PJ Library and started reading last fall, one holiday at a time. But then I got a bit behind and decided to try to do it all at once. Each chapter definitely stands alone so no need to that though. And each chapter is very dense (the writing on the page was sooooo small, though maybe I’m just getting older). I liked the author, felt like we could be friends, but her voice (which I liked) got lost sometimes in SOOOOO many other voices. So many rabbis especially- how to keep them straight? I just gave up. But worth it to learn more about Jewish holidays. Will keep with my Judaica books.\n\n5. How College Athletics Are Hurting Girls’ Sports: The Pay-to-Play Pipeline by Rick Eckstein- You can read my review here.\n\n6. The Moon and More by Sarah Dessen- Just ok. And too long for just ok.\n\n7. Unofficial Guide to Disneyland 2019 by Seth Kubersky and Bob Sehlinger- Guess what I’m planning?!\n\n8. The Red Pyramid by Rick Riordan- I really liked this. I think it’s a touch too long, with too many climaxes, but I really like the characters and abck story. A lot.\n\n9. The Sparkle Effect: Step into the Radiance of Your True Identity by Kristen Dalton Wolfe- This is long. And you have to like scriptures. I read it for Miss USA parts, of which there were several. I found it odd she didn’t discuss motherhood at all. But sparkle is a good successful pageant concept!\n\n10. Century of Struggle: The Woman’s Rights Movement in the United States by Elanor Flexnor- Interesting, for both content and foundational importance in field. Tried to do a bit too much at times, but a necessary book.\n\n11. The Myth of Seneca Falls: Memory and the Women’s Suffrage Movement, 1848-1898 by Lisa Tetrault- Fascinating history. It’s very detailed and specific, but very important (especially if you’re interested in suffrage/women’s movement).\n\n12. American Legend: The Life of P.T. Barnum- A quick read, very general and likely geared for younger audience, but ok overview.\n\n13. The Woman Suffrage Movement in America by Corrine M. McConnaughy- Not as good as some of the others on this list, but still worth it.\n\n14. Desolation Mountain by William Kent Krueger- A nice addition to the Cork O’Connor series— very serious— but twist at very, very end a long time coming.\n\n15. Always and Forever, Lara Jean by Jenny Han- I didn’t love it as much as first two, but I am sad to see this multi-layered trilogy end.\n\n16. Stealing Home by Ellen Schwartz- I know this is a kid’s book, but I was so emotional reading it. Plus, I wonder how much of the historical nuance some kids would get. Definitely worthwhile, reminded me a bit of In the Year of the Boar and Jackie Robinson.\n\n17. The Circus Age: Culture and Society Under the American Big Top by Janet M. Davis- Fascinating, deep take on a previously core part of pop culture.\n\n18. Divided We Fall by Trent Reedy- So terrible. I FORCED myself to finish this, hoping. But SO one-note, unrealistic, not compelling. Bad.\n\n19. E Pluribus Barnum: The Great Showman and the Making of U.S. Popular Culture by Bluford Adams- The best of the Barnum bunch!\n\n20. The Holy Trinity of American Sports: Civil Religion in Football, Baseball, and Basketball by Craig A. Forney- More actual theology than I expected; I can get the same for myself and students from an article but definitely an interesting take.\n\n21. Gilead by Marilynne Robinson- Whoa, don’t get this. HATED it. So, so boring (I admit I scanned at times).\n\n22. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone by J.K. Rowling- Well, I finally get to reread (for first time since 2003 when I read Philopher’s Stone in the UK!) because I have a son reading it. Amazing how great still is— the world, the characters, the pacing! Fun to reread and see how plotted things out were from start.\n\n23. Merely Moving Shadows by Katie Stam Irk- I make it a point to buy and read pretty much every book by a Miss America. This was mainly prayers with only a bit about her pageant story.\n\n24. Emergency Contact by Mary H.K. Choi- I wanted to like this, but it felt very melodrama-y. An older YA problem?\n\n25. Big Game: The NFL in Dangerous Times by Mark Leibovich- This book was not nearly as substantive as I expected. It’s gossip-y and insider-y and fan boy-y. It could have been half as long as well. The news articles about the book were better than the book itself, as it is a very worthwhile topic.\n\n26. My Shot: Balancing It All and Standing Tall by Elena Delle Donne- I’ve been intrigued by Elena Delle Donner for years, ever since she left the UConn women’s basketball team. This book was really well done. That story, and her sexuality, were handled remarkably well. I didn’t know about the Lyme before. Definitely worth it for fans of the game!\n\n27. This Book Has Balls: Sports Rants from the MVP of Talking Trash by Michael Rappaport- Didn’t get it. Even with Real Housewives bits. Actually obnoxious and mean. Thank you, next.\n\n28. Venus with Biceps: A Pictorial History of Muscular Women by David L. Chapman- Would have liked a bit more nuanced and chronologically synthesizing commentary, but interesting photos that many in field will find useful (especially international focus).\n\n29. The Throne of Fire by Rick Riordan- Again, a little long, but layered and enjoyable. Will look forward to last book in trilogy.\n\n30. 99 Percent Mine by Sally Thorne- I wanted to like this, but in the end I just really didn’t like the characters.\n\n31. Dust Bowl Girls: The Inspiring Story of the Team That Barnstormed Its Way to Basketball Glory by Lydia Reeder- My favorite part of this book was the surprise addition of a beauty contest! I liked the integration of women’s sports history with this story. I skipped over some of the regional issues, but like their inclusion. A touch long and hard to keep all the players straight, but a good addition to women’s sports history.\n\n32. The Killer Collective by Barry Eisler- He knows how to write a good thriller. Very much a mash-up of his series, so a faithful reader is necessary.\n\n33. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling- Re-read at a Wizardng Weekend with my kids. Holds up, but I see the twists coming much more in this one.\n\n34. When Race, Religion, and Sport Collide: Black Athletes at BYU and Beyond by Darron T. Smith- This is very specific. Less context than I would have liked…\n\n35. The Widows of Malabar Hill by Sujata Massey- Excited to see where this new series goes and learning a lot about India and religious groups there. Bonus I like Perveen so much!\n\n36. Race, Culture, and the Revolt of the Black Athlete: The 1968 Olympic Protests and Their Aftermath by Douglas Hartmann- This is a lot. You have to really want to know a lot about 1968 (before and after). But the framing is excellent and anyone interested in sports history/sociology should own this.\n\n37. The Poet X by Elizabeth Acevado- It took me longer than I expected to get into this, but once I did I was hooked. Very moving.\n\n38. Midnight Basketball: Race, Sports, and Neoliberal Social Policy by Douglas Hartmann- This is good if you are into midnight basketball, or studying sports, but given time that is past since story in 1990s, I needed this to make a stronger case about why we should care NOW.\n\n39. Nine Perfect Strangers by Liane Moriarty- I was surprisingly disappointed in this. Too long, too, weird, I even skimmed some parts toward the end. I usually love her stuff and brand of suspense.\n\n40. Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry by Geoffrey Jones- A well researched version of exactly what the subtitle says!\n\n41. Bazaars & Fair Ladies: The History of the American Fundraising Fair by Beverly Gordon- A detailed take on something overlooked- I liked the pictures, would have liked a bit more narrative, or tie to present, but definitely worthwhile.\n\n42. Celebrity Culture and the American Dream by Karen Sternheimer- Both a historical and contemporary take on a big topic.\n\n43. Bound by a Mighty Vow: Sisterhood and Women’s Fraternities, 1870-1920 by Diana B. Turk- An interesting early take on women’s “sororities.” Especially of interest if you were in Kappa Theta.\n\n44. The Grounding of Modern Feminism by Nancy F. Cott- Seen as a landmark book, doesn’t hold up as well as I’d like. Very dry in parts, but intro important.\n\n45. Astroball: The New Way to Win It All by Ben Reiter- Ben is a friend and he’s a very talented writer. I wish I could write characters and narrative like he does! I would have liked the end to circle back to promises at start (about how this links to bigger societal trends), but a World Series victory will be enough for many.\n\n46. The Anatomy of Competition in Sports: The Struggle for Success in Major US Professional Leagues by Christopher B. Doob- very formulaic, with some interesting facts, but not very compelling, including for students.\n\n47. National Pastime: U.S. History Through Baseball by Martin C. Babicz and Thomas W. Zeiler- This doesn’t quite deliver on its promise. It’s definitely baseball history though! Dense if you aren’t a devoted fan/follower.\n\n48. No Boston Olympics: How and Why Smart Cities Are Passing on the Torch by Chris Dempsey and Andrew Zimbalist- Definitely for those interested in Boston’s fight, and likely not others. It’s a very specific story.\n\n49. The Rise and Fall of Olympic Amateurism by Matthew P. Llewellyn and John Gleaves- While there are some good insights here, the language is unecessarily dense, and it doesn’t get into the 1990s new Olympics enough for me.\n\n50. Quest for Success: Legacies of Winning by Steven Ungerleider- This was such a disappointment to me. I had heard a lot about this, but it’s just a summary/collectioon of stories.\n\n51. Sadie by Courtney Summers- I wanted to love this, and it was interesting, but also predictable in some ways, and heart breaking. Interestig genre mash-up though.\n\n52. The Distance Home by Paula Sanders- Beautifu and haunting at times, but I ultimately didn’t get why we should care and why the characters ended up where they did.\n\n53. No Crown Required: Raising a Confident, Courageous, and Compassionate Daughter by Susan Kay Wyatt- I highlighted often as there’s a kernel of something here, but the chronology was a bit confusing and probably could have used an editor’s help…\n\n54. The Night She Won Miss America by Michael Callahan- Could have been shorter (a few too many twists and turns) and less salacious, but interesting (especially if you know the history).\n\n55. The Woman’s Hour: The Great Fight to Win the Vote by Elaine Weiss- This book really got to me- emotionally- and I’m surprised it’s the first to tell this TN story in such depth. I definitely recommend, especially as we get close to celebrating the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage in the US.\n\n56. Woman’s Proper Place: A History of Changing Ideals and Practices, 1870 to the Present bby Sheila M. Rothman- An important book, though I don’t think it holds up as well as I would have thought.\n\n57. California Girl: Miss USA 1959 by Terry Huntingdon Tydings- Ok, this book is crazy. But it’s entertaining. Not sure if it’s all accurate, but it’s not dull…\n\n58. Boardwalk of Dreams: Atlantic City and the Fate of Urban America by Bryant Simon- A very well done book (and there’s not much Miss America in here, but still great!).\n\n59. Unwinding Madness: What Went Wrong with College Sports and How to Fix It by Gerald Gurney, Donna A. Lopiano, and Andrew Zimbalist- I would have preferred more concrete examples, and less of a diatribe, and in the suggestions/proposal things with a path to success.\n\n60. The Serpent’s Shadow by Rick Riordan- A disappointing end to the Kane Chronicles. WAY too long, too many adventures, and not a very satisfying conclusion…\n\n61. Atlantic City: One Hundred Twenty-Five Years of Ocean Madness by Vicki G. Levi and Lee Eisenberg- More book research, I always like when images and text are intermixed. Worth it if you’re into the Jersey Shore!\n\n62. Queen Bess: An Unauthorized Biography of Bess Myerson by Jennifer Preston- Wow, what a life. This is a long take on Bess, but worth it to anyone interested in her for sure.\n\n63. Blood Oath by Linda Fairstein- The best Alexandra Cooper entry in some time. I still wish not EVERYTHING was life and death, but interesting main plots with character development (still more of that please).\n\n64. A Subtle Muder by Blythe Baker- A quick read, fun historical mystery was a different take. Will definitely read the next one (also free on Amazon Unlimited).\n\n65. Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens- It took me a while to get into this book, which surprised me given the reviews, but by the end I was enthralled. And I cried.\n\n66. Running Against the Tide: True Tales from the Stud of the Sea by Captain Lee- I wanted to love this since I love him on Below Deck, but it’s barely about the show (only last chapter), and I just wasn’t that interested in his earlier life…\n\n67. Boardwalk Summer by Meredith Jaeger- I read this for pageant connection, but it was just so cheesy and pat that I can’t recommend it at all.\n\n68. This Is Your Brain on Sports: The Science of Underdogs, the Value of Rivalry, and What We Can Learn from the T-Shirt Cannon by L. Jon Wertheim and Sam Sommers- The chapters are uneven and I wish the conclusions were a little weak, but sports lovers will love.\n\n69. A Place for Us by Fatima Farheen Mizra- Another that got such great reviews, and which was so slow to me. At a certain point I just wanted to read for it to be done, and I really did not like how it ended.\n\n70. I’m Fine and Neither Are You by Camille Pagan- A quick read, right for this time in my life. Ok.\n\n71. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid- Not what I expected, but one of my few five star books this year. A must read.\n\n72. The American Agent by Jacqueline Winspear- Another one of my five stars! A great Maisie Dobbs entry— lots happening.\n\n73. Orphan X by Gregg Hurwitz- I liked this first in a new series. I’m eager to read more about Orphan X!\n\n74. Charm: The Elusive Enchantment by Joseph Epstein- So not what I expected- maybe even, dare I say, lacking in charm?\n\n75. The Book of Essie by Meghan MacLean Weir- I wanted to like this, but it was just weird.\n\n76. A Grave Welcome by Blythe Baker- Not as good as first entry. I’ll give it a bit before trying one more entry.\n\n77. Diary of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney- I read this because my older son is obsessed with the series. I think you have to be a young boy to get this?\n\n78. What Strange Creatures by Emily Arsenault- Took me forever as I just did not like it very much. Characters not very likeable, but interesting premise.\n\n79. Buy a Bullet by Gregg Hurwitz- A short that just wasn’t that interesting. At all. No wonder it was cut!\n\n80. Power Down by Ben Coes- Definitely on the long side, but I’m going to give book 2 a try for sure.\n\n81. That Girl In Your Mirror by Vonda Kay Van Dyke- Definitely an anachronistic journey by Miss America 1965.\n\n82. The Rise of Women: The Growing Gender Gap in Education and What It Means for American Schools by Thomas DiPrete and Clausia Buchmann- A solid read on this topic.\n\n83. The New York Regional Mormon Singles Halloween Dance by Elna Baker- Recommended to me by an editor, but wow, a pretty unlikeable voice that doesn’t hold up great over time…\n\n84. Dressing Up Debutantes: Pageantry and Glitz in Texas by Michaele Thurgood Haynes- Very well done, one of my favorite research books this month!\n\n85. The Satapur Moonstone by Sujata Massey- Probably my favorite fiction this month. Really enjoying this series— though at end wished the geographic region actually existed.\n\n86. Forever Barbie: The Unathorized Biography of a Real Doll by M.G. Lord- This is a very well done book. Entertaining, informative, with an interesting message/argument that still matters.\n\n87. American Rose: The Life and Times of Gypsy Rose Lee by Karen Abbott- I wanted to like this, but it slightly underperformed for me.\n\n88. True Colors: An Artists’ Journey from Beauty Queen to Feminist by Patricia Hill Burnett- I should think I would have liked conversing with Patricia!\n\n89. Long Beach: Fortunes Harbor by Larry Meyer and Patricia Kalayjian- Read for research, but seems a well done volume for anyone interested in Long Beach!\n\n90. Neverworld Wake by Marisha Pessl- I wanted to like this, but I’m not into Sci Fi and another case of not loving the characters…\n\n91. The Nowhere Man by Gregg Hurwitz- Really enjoying this new series. Moving quickly, and all the subplots were strong. Pacing myself to read next!\n\n92. How To Be & Look Your Best Eveery Day by Donna Axum- Another anachronistic walk in time byb a former Miss America.\n\n93. Dear Ally, How Do You Write a Book by Ally Carter- Too long! Long story short, write instead of reading this (also, it’s all directed at fiction).\n\n94. Going Too Far: The Personal Chornicle of a Feminist by Robin Morgan- Wow, this is a weird book.\n\n95. Dear Vonda Kay by Vonda Kay Von Dyke- See #81.\n\n96. Not Pretty Enough: The Unlikely Triumph of Helen Gurley Brown by Gerri Hirshey- Interesting, but long. So long for a book without official papers…\n\n97. More Grace than Glamour: My Life as Miss America and Beyond by Jane Jayroe- This was actually very interesting, especially since done recently by Miss America 1966, so space for reflection, and well-produced. Big focus on Oklahoma, given series publisher.\n\n98. American Women’s History: A Very Short Introduction by Susan Ware- Crams a lot in, and includes a lot of diverse perspectives while doing it.\n\n99. A Legacy of Leadership: The US Junior Chamber of Commerce Celebrate 75 Years by John W. Clark- Trying to understand more about the Jaycees. This isn’t thrilling, but there’s a lot of info here (not reflective at all though).\n\n100. Never Say Never by Phyllis George- Surprisingly snappy and interesting, but would have liked more just from her and not about famous friends.\n\n101. The Sisterhood: An Intimate History of the Women’s Movement by Marcia B. Cohen- A rich story of women’s movement of the 1970s and 1980s. Perhaps one too many women were featured, but it’s a great account.\n\n102. Why They Marched: Untold Stories of the Women Who Fought for the Right to Vote by Susan Ware- Another great account of suffrage, paying attention to many different groups of women. A great history.\n\n103. Miss Ameirica by Day: Lessons Learned from Ultimate Betrayals and Unconditional Love by Marilyn Van Derbur- A tough book to read as it is about incest (Marilyn’s father). A bit long, but worth it if you are interested in either Miss America or issues related to family sexual abuse.\n\n104. The New Feminist Movement by Maren Lockwood Carden- An overlooked but very important study of the early Second Wave movement.\n\n105. War and Chance: Assessing Uncertainty in International Politics by Jeffrey Friedman- New book by my brother-in-law Jeff Friedman. If you’re interested in foreign policy, intelligence analysis and reform, and numerical probability you don’t want to miss it!\n\n106. Beartown by Fredrik Backman- Very slow, nice at times, ultimately a bit boring…\n\n107. This Tiny Perfect World by Lauren Gibaldi- Also a bit boring (especially for YA).\n\n108. Rampant Women: Suffragists and the Right of Assembly by Linda J. Lumsden- Such an important taken and argument on suffrage.\n\n109. Hellbent by Gregg Hurwitz- This has fast become my new favorite series— trying to slow down by reading!\n\n110. Bellweather Rhapsody by Kate Racculia- I just did not get this book. It just had this weird edge, but good setting.\n\n111. Ask the Passengers by A.S. King- A very nuanced and real take inside of teen girl’s mind. Worthwhile.\n\n112. The Intern by Gregg Hurwitz- I love the series, not so much the short stories. This will be my last one…\n\n113. The Sweetheart by Angelina Mirabella- Good premise but didn’t deliver in the end. Felt lonely.\n\n114. Don’t Assume I Don’t Cook: Recipes for Women’s Lives by Jane Evershed- A surprisingly interesting and informative (and useful) cookbook from NOW!\n\n115. Sharlene Wells, Miss America by Sheri Dew- A very wholesome, religious look at Sharlene Wells’ life, up to and right after her year as Miss America.\n\n116. Kissing a Frog : Four Steps to Finding Comfort Outside Your Comfort Zone by Sharlene Wells- An advice/inspirational book by Miss America 1985.\n\n117. A History of U.S. Feminsims by Rory Dicker- A short, surface take on the movement, with useful boxes on some overlooked aspects.\n\n118. When Everything Changed: The Amazing Journey of American Women from 1960 to the Present by Gail Collins- Ends in 2010, so we know a lot changes, and this is definitely a general audience take. Long with lots of interesting anecdotes.\n\n119. Be Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back by Gretchen Carlson- More of an advice book, with some biographical details sprinkled in.\n\n120. Yes, You Can, Heather by Daphne Gray- A surprisingly candid and detailed take by mother of Miss America 1995 (Heather Whitestone).\n\n121. Living with Diabetes by Nicole Johnson- Seems a very one-sided narrative, but understand why she did a book.\n\n122. Listening with My Heart by Heather Whitestone- Her mom’s was more interesting, but tells story of meeting her husnand while Miss America.\n\n123. 101 Secrets to Winning Beauty Pageants by Ann-Marie Bivans- Tips for competing, some fun trivia as well.\n\n124. Truly Devious by Maureen Johnson- I didn’t love this, but was intrigued enough to commit to #2 of trilogy.\n\n125. The Alice Behind Wonderland by Simon Winchester- In the end, I just didn’t get quite why I should care.\n\n126. The Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang- I know this got good reviews, but honestly I was pretty meh. Nothing surprising happened, a bit long.\n\n127. Drag: Combing Through the Big Wigs of Show Business by Frank Decaro- I really appreciated the history and organization of this book. At times I wanted more of the bios though!\n\n128. In Defense of the Princess by Jerramy Fine- A good counter perspective on the princess craze. Worth a quick read.\n\n129. The Stars in Our Eyes by Julie Klam- I definitely did not think that the subtitle (why we care too much about the famous) was ever fulfilled here.\n\n130. Makeover TV: Selfhood, Citizenship, and Celebrity by Brenda Weber- A bit too theoretical.\n\n131. The Makeover: Reality Television and Reflexive Audiences by Katherine Sender- Also a bit too theoretical.\n\n132. Hollywood’s Children: An Inside Account of the Child Star Era by Diana Cary- An interesting read with good backstory.\n\n133. Ascent from Obscurity by LaVern Cameron- This is a LOT (by mother of Miss America 2010 Caressa Cameron).\n\n134. Still Standing: The Untold Story of My Fight Against Gossip, Hate, and Political Attacks by Carrie Prejean- This was released right after the final answer at Miss USA scandal. I’d actually rather read a version that came out now… I bet she’d have even more to say.\n\n135. Bachelor Nation: Inside the World of America’s Favorite Guilty Pleasure by Amy Kaufman- Of interest to Bachelor Nation.\n\n136. Pretty Powerful by Eboni Williams- I have to be honest, I just didn’t get this at all.\n\n137. Waiting for Unicorns by Beth Hautala- A quick, bittersweet YA novel. I wanted a touch more oomph.\n\n138. Amazing Win, Amazing Loss: Miss America Living Happily, EVEN After by Angela Perez Baraquio- Of the Miss autogiographies, this has most intriguing details (but needed editing).\n\n139. Broad, Casted by Rachel Barnhart- This probably should have been a blog post (or even a diary entry)…\n\n140. Trespassers Will Be Baptized by Elizabeth Emerson Hancock- Fun to read the words of, and learn more about, Emy Hancock.\n\n141. The Sexual Education of a Beauty Queen by Taylor Marsh- Very self indulgent, needed editing.\n\n142. Broad Influence: How Women Are Changing the Way America Works by Jay Newton-Small- One of the best NF books I’ve read this year, though it is at risk for getting a bit dated.\n\n143. The Last Anniversary by Liane Moriarty- The worst/least suspenseful/interesting Moriarty I’ve read. No one very likeable…\n\n144. Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud: The Rise and Reign of the Unruly Woman by Anne Helen Peterson- Peterson writes with such a clear voice, so automatically an enjoyable read. Like the Newton-Small, I worry could get a bit dated (as not all the examples might “hold up?”), and I wish a bit more analysis at front and back, but definitely worth it.\n\n145. Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman by Lindy West- Sensing a theme?! Much more personal book, another strong voice.\n\n146. Periods Gone Public: Taking a Stand for Menstrual Equity by Jennifer Weiss-Wolf- Such an important issue, and a clear book on the subject.\n\n147. Beauty Sick by Renee Engeln- Broad coverage of topic of how focus on appearance impacting those who identify as female.\n\n148. The Rhinestone Sisterhood by David Valdes Greenwood- I like that this focused on festival queens (all in Louisiana). Following them for year means dependent on queens and what happens that year, but still a light shown on something that matters a lot to some communities.\n\n149. Disneyland Then, Now, and Forever by Tim O’Day- More pictorial than historical, I did learn some fun history and trivia for my Disneyland trip! But wouldn’t recommend.\n\n150. Evvie Drake Starts Over by Linda Holmes- I read as has gotten rave reviews this summer, but I was pretty meh. Again, people just are not that likeable (though maybe realistic?)…\n\n151. The Vanishing Stair by Maureen Johnson- Am committed to finishing the trilogy, so eager for third installment, especially given the cliff hanger here. Not sure I’d recommend this series overall- will have to see how it ends.\n\n152. They Could Have Named Her Anything by Stephanie Jiminez- A lot of heavy issues, but worth a read.\n\n153. Out of the Dark by Gregg Hurwitz- I just really enjoy this Orphan X series.\n\n154. Sympotoms of a Heartbreak by Sona Charaipotra- I really liked the premise of this (female, Indian Doogie Howser) but it was a bit too long and characters not the most likeable.\n\n155. Boys Should Be Boys by Meg Meeker- Whoa, not useful. Some disturbing religious stuff I did not expect. Hard pass.\n\n156. The Bette Davis Book Club by Jane Lotter- I unexpectedly really enjoyed this. The author passed away and her daughter edited it and the book probably could have been a bit shorter— but it was highly original and enjoyable!\n\n157. Shamed by Linda Castillo- I had started to get a little bored with the Burkholder series, but I did enjoy this installment.\n\n158. Moon New Mexico by Zora O’Neill- I really want to go to New Mexico and was working on a draft itinerary. This is a very useful book!\n\n159. The Best Bad Luck I Ever Had by Kristin Levine- I really like the youth historical fiction by Kristin Levine. This was no exception. Useful way for kids to think about racial history and politics in this country.\n\n160. City of Windows by Robert Pobi- I feel like this could be the beginning of a great series. Had elements of the old TV show Numb3rs with a quirky character and good law enforcement thriller. Definitely enjoyed!\n\n161. The Great Believers by Rebecca Makkai- Long, but lived up to the hype. Particularly liked the Chicago setting. Prepare to cry.\n\n162. Pilgrims: A Nonfiction Companion by Mary Pope Osborne- Doing some summer reading with the eldest. Learned a few things myself!\n\n163. White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo- Short book that is a good primer on institutional racism.\n\n164. A Hundred Summers by Beatriz Williams- I enjoyed this not only for the historic and Rhode Island setting, but also because I genuinely did not quite see the plot twist coming!\n\n165. Salt by Mark Kurlansky- This is certainly a well-researched book and there is no way you won’t learn something by reading it, but I don’t quite get the long-standing hype.\n\n166. The Girls by Abigail Pesta- An important topic- the Nassar sex abuse scandal- but somehow the book didn’t resonate with me.\n\n167. The Wonder of Boys by Michael Gurian- Better than the other boy mom book I read, but still not great (there is a need in this space!).\n\n168. Isle of the Lost by Melissa de la Cruz- My kids and I got into The Descendants over the summer and we all wanted to read the books. But this disappointed for all of us… Too slow, and some of the backstory doesn’t fit with what comes later (at least in movies).\n\n169. The Parker Inheritance by Varian Johnson- Very mixed feelings on this. At times I really liked it (plot, characters, showing complicated nature of youth issues), but in the end I thought it was more unrealistic.\n\n170. A Cunning Death by Blythe Baker- A light historical fiction mystery series set in England. I just find these go down quickly and smoothly when I’m up in the middle of the night…\n\n171. Bling! by Sondra Celli- Known for designing extravagant gypsy dresses (out of Boston!) this book tells more baout Celli, how she got started, and how she does some of the blinging.\n\n172. This Time Will be Different by Misa Sugiura- An unusual five stars from me. Multi-layered, different, great characters. A win!\n\n173. The Victory Garden by Rhys Bowen- I liked this more than I thought I would! I seem to read a lot about WWI, but it is fascinating.\n\n174. The Art of Fielding by Chad Harbach- I bought this a long time ago and finally read it. Definitely interesting. In the end I think it was too long, and it tried to be too big of a story, but it’s worthwhile.\n\n175. The Birthday Girl by Melissa de la Cruz- I did not quite see the exact twist coming (though I knew there was one). Was just ok. Not sure anyone was likeable…\n\n176. Bomber’s Moon by Archer Mayor- Solid entry in the Joe Gunther series, but not terribly remarkable.\n\n177. Unpregnant by Jenni Hendriks- A rare five star for me. Great characters, story, social issues, everything.\n\n178. With the Fire on High by Elizabeth Acevedo- This feels like an important book for teens to read. I really appreciated the nuanced story.\n\n179. You Should Have Known by Jean Hanff Korelitz- I should learn I don’t love this author. Too long, too dark, too unresolved.\n\n180. Our Only May Amelia by Jennifer Holm- I feel like I was expecting more like Little House, but I just wasn’t feeling this and didn’t like stream of consciousness-style writing.\n\n181. Do You Mind if I Cancel? by Gary Janetti- So I love his work, and his Insta, but this book felt too disconnected across essays (lots of repetition), and how he became a successful writer is completely absent, which I found strange…\n\n182. Swearing is Good for You by Emma Byrne- I loved the premise of this book. In practice it was a bit of a slog to read. Probably could have been a long article…\n\n183. Miss Unlikely by Betty Cantrell Maxwell- Book research. I didn’t quite get the whole narrative that it was so shocking she became Miss America. What WAS shocking was her story of her mother-in-law’s (recent) suicide.\n\n184. Let It Snow by John Green, Maureen Johnson, and Lauren Myracle- A very rare case where I liked the movie more- though that may be because it first? Movie characters just more likeable, with different perspectives.\n\n185. Frankly in Love by David Yoon- Wow. So many perspectives told with such a special voice. One of my favorite books of the year for sure.\n\n186. Bloodman by Robert Pobi- This book gave me the heebie jeebies. At times I couldn’t stop reading- it’s freaky and may give you nightmares. And I HATED HATED HATED the ending.\n\n2018\n\n1. Ramona Blue by Julie Murphy– Julie Murphy has very quickly become one of my favorite authors. A multi-layered, enjoyable story about sexuality and coming of age (and not in the way you might expect!). Definitely recommend.\n\n2. Fierce: How Competing for Myself Changed Everything by Aly Raisman– I was surprised by how compelling I found this story given that, 1) I knew how it would end up, and 2) I’m a bit older than the target audience. But Aly details a lot of her training, which was interesting, and some of her relationships with coaches and gymnasts. Of course the sexual abuse has gotten a lot of the press, but other issues discussed like adoption, are also handled very well. Probably not of interest to someone who isn’t a gymnastics or sports fan, but very much worth it to those who are.\n\n3. Trouble Makes a Comeback by Stephanie Tromly– I didn’t like this as much as the first installment in the series, but I’m still in for the third entry in this smart teen mystery series.\n\n4. American Fire: Love, Arson, and Life in a Vanishing Land– A very clear voice on a crime, and region, not well known to most people. The history and psychology of arson was woven in quite well and I learned a lot– even if the conclusion seemed rather obvious.\n\n5. All the Secret Places by Anna Carlise– Definitely not as good as book one. I can only give this series one more try. Slow paced, two many dramatic threads to be very believable; and the characters don’t seem likeable.\n\n6. The Stars Beneath Our Feet by David Barclay Moore– At the start of this book I thought I was going to love it. Unfortunately I think it really started to meander and try to address too many serious issues (and not always in enough depth or care). While it’s fine that the main character, Lolly, is flawed (we all are!) at times he didn’t seem as likeable as he could have been, so I didn’t root for him as much as I thought I would. In contrast, I wanted to know more about Rose. While all of the characters seemed colorful, I’m not sure how real they"
