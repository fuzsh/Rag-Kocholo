        "text": "The internship programs participating in Phase I of the APPIC Match for positions beginning in 2023 are shown below. This list will be updated regularly. Each program is uniquely identified in the Match by the 6-digit Match Code Number shown in this list. Applicants should use the Match Code Number to identify each program when submitting their Rank Order Lists.\n\nPlease review important notes on Accreditation Status, APPIC Member Status, and Search Tips.\n\nThe APPIC Member Status is either Full or Provisional. Provisional members meet all the same requirements as Full members except they have not yet had at least two interns in training in any training year.\n\nIf an applicant wishes to rank a program that does not appear in the list, the applicant should contact the site's Training Director to determine the program's status."
