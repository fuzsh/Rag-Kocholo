        "text": "Law School\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts School of Law\n\nAgency\n\nState Senator Joan Lovely\n\nBiography\n\nPrior to law school Jennifer White received her master’s degree in social work from Boston University, and for the first several years after graduation, she worked in the field of Child Abuse Prevention in Southeastern Georgia. White then returned home to Massachusetts, where she worked with adolescent parents for 22 years. Just prior to coming to law school, she was a member of the Healthy Families America national accreditation panel.\n\nJennifer has worked with families her entire career and has been inspired by the stories of resilience, strength, and hope. She holds these stories in her heart, and they have driven her to law school to work on changing systemic barriers, particularly economic inequalities that challenge young families. This summer, White will be working in the office of State Senator Joan Lovely."
