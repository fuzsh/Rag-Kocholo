        "text": "Actor Michael Rapaport doesn’t want his “son” using his phone at school, even to stick up for his father — or so it appeared.\n\nOn Thursday morning, a Twitter user claiming to be the teenage son of the actor came to his defense when journalists Alex Leo and Lindsay Robertson criticized him for taking Aziz Ansari to task for comparing Chris Brown to Donald Trump in his “Saturday Night Live” monologue.\n\nThe whole thing started when Leo and Robertson asked on Twitter why Rapaport, 46, was so “insulted” by Ansari’s joke. Robertson then suggested it was because “MR has his own criminal history with women to worry about!” She also linked to an article detailing a 1998 incident where the actor admitted to harassing ex-girlfriend Lili Taylor.\n\n“How dare u talk about my father. Everyone has a bad day. U girls are so cool spewing hate on twitter,” an account under the name “Dean Rapaport” tweeted, before adding: “You two are the reason I get bullied at school. You no nothing about my dad.”\n\nRapaport is the father of two sons, Julian and Maceo. He has no child named “Dean.”\n\nThe tweets were followed by two from the real Rapaport, one in which he asked his Dean to stop, and then another in which he said he’d have someone at Dean’s school confiscate his phone.\n\n“Dean are you kidding me Leave these ladies alone or Im callin the school to have them take the phone,” he tweeted.\n\nAt that point Leo offered an apology to Dean, telling him she did not mean to contribute to his bullying. The teen accepted it, but repeated that comments from people like her and Robertson were why he was getting bullied.\n\nWith Dean still tweeting, Rapaport again stepped in to tell him his teacher was coming to study hall to confiscate his phone.\n\n“Are you f–king kidding me? I’m sticking up for you,” he tweeted at his father.\n\n“I am fine. They are taking your phone away the Nanny is coming to get it from school ASAP,” his father wrote in response.\n\nRapaport then tweeted at Leo and Robertson, calling them “girls,” and asking them to leave his family out of their tweets, even though it was Dean who had responded to their tweets first.\n\n“please girls leave my family off twitter we have family issues and this is a 17 yr old IN school,” he wrote.\n\nLeo and Robertson’s initial tweets were in response to comments Rapaport made on his podcast yesterday, in which he called out Ansari for comparing Brown to Trump in his “SNL” monologue. The pop star also didn’t take kindly to the comparison, calling the comedian “Aladdin” and rudely asking him to “hop off my d–k.”\n\nOn Wednesday’s episode of “I Am Rapaport Stereo Live,” the actor appeared to defend Brown, although noting said he does not support beating women, but wondered why Ansari brought him up in the first place.\n\n“Aziz Ansari, who the f–k do you think you are? Why are you dragging [Chris Brown] through the mud? Who are you to talk about him?’” The Wrap quoted him as saying.\n\nRapaport also criticized Ansari for taking on race in America in both his comedy and on the latter’s show “Master of None.”\n\n“F–k you, you little politically correct f–k, you,” he said. “I’m not saying he’s not funny. I’m not saying he’s not talented. And I’m not saying his voice isn’t warranted, but you are not holier than thou.”\n\nA representative for the actor did not respond to a request for comment."
