        "text": "Sage Uncensored is NOT a spoiler column and does not represent itself as such in any way. It is not intended to proved \"new,\" \"out-scooped\" or otherwise groundbreaking material. This column will discuss news, rumors and spoilers already in circulation, so if you are here to bitch that there is no new material, don't say you weren't warned. Those of you who enjoy Sage and his writing will likely appreciate the column. Those of you who are just here for your spoiler fix are probably in the wrong place.\n\nFor those of you who choose to continue on and share time with Sage, welcome!\n\nOh and PLEASE stop writing to tell me (again) how sad you are that I don't do spoilers any more. I didn't like doing it. I stopped doing it. Please get over it. If you don't like what I do now, I completely understand if you leave my mailing group and don't visit my column again.\n\nI just learned that I am going out of town tomorrow and won't be back until Tuesday of next week, so I wanted to post my column (very) early. Hope you don't mind. It's a little more uncensored than usual. Since I won't be around to give you the nudge, please do contribute to EOS' operating expenses this month. We fully depend on reader support to remain on the internet and this is a WONDERFUL way to put that tax return money to use!

My friend, my muse, my cheerleader, my inspiration to switch teams...\n\nI've been hating the shows for quite a while now. It started with GH, then bled over to OLTL and lately, AMC has been disappointing me as well. Half the time, I don't even bother to watch any more because most of the time, the people that interest me are never on screen and the ones I despise are on there all the time.\n\nSo why bother?\n\nFor the first time in a 42 year history of soap viewing, I didn't bother. In the meantime, I juggled by working captions, the celeb interviews, the Emmys and other shiny things into my column. If I couldn't find the motivation to watch, it was nearly impossible to find the motivation to write. I continued trying for the people who read this column who are truly my friends.\n\nYesterday, I decided to throw myself into the shows with gusto, feeling what I feel, hating what I hate and trying to sift through for something positive to say. Here are the results of my viewing of the March 30th episodes of all three shows:\n\nI'm actually a little miffed that Braden stole my idea of a \"Ryan Hate\" shrine. I used to have a \"Ryan Love\" shrine, but that was before he became the Acclaimed King of Pine Valley and Surrounding Territories. Sovereignty Unearned has always given me a bit of a sting in my ass, so my appreciation of Saint Ryan pretty much melted away after his (much anticipated by me) return to AMC in 2003. Pair him up with Saint Bianca and they can replace Jim and Tammy Faye as consummate leaders of the pious and the perfect. (Oh, I know, they \"aren't perfect, just forgiven.\" I don't forgive them for their damned attitudes) That's the problem with martyrs. They just bleed everywhere.\n\nMy boss here at Eye on Soaps, Katrina Rasbold, came up with an idea most wondrous that I am certain Megass McTavish won't have the mental flint to play out. What if there really is no Braden (of course there IS a Braden, but what if they find out he's incarcerated??) and Jonathan has DID? Wouldn't that be mahvelous!! I could forgive AMC almost any recent transgression (give it over the past three months) if they would just\n\nplay\n\nthat\n\ncard.\n\nSince I tend to shun away from spoilers by my own choice, I don't really know what's coming up in this regard (for the record, I found that I was able to much better enjoy the soaps when I didn't know every move that was going to be made for the next two months and I do fully and whole heartedly endorse the \"Unspoiled Viewing\" for everyone to try once in a while. It definitely ups the price of poker when you don't know what's going to happen next.\n\nFar from the \"Ryan Hate\" shrine, I find that I am lighting more and more candles on my \"Lily Love\" shrine. She has quickly become one of my favorite AMC characters (I'd say she, Reggie, Tad and David are the only characters I DO like and I'm on hiatus from liking Tad and David because of their idiotic, \"done lost my mind\" behavior as of late). It's pretty sad when the folks I like the most have been on such a short time.\n\nI've heard rumors of a Cady McClain/Dixie Martin return and while I genuinely detested the character, I'd love for her to come back if for no other reason than to give Tad a good whacking around. If anyone ever needed a double-sided bitch slapping to get him back in his right mind, it's The Cad, who has been reduced to \"Tad the Sad.\"\n\nLine of the week (so far) goes to Adam for telling Babe, \"Why don't you go watch cartoons?\"\n\nDSSD = Different shit; same day. We have a variety of different shit going on with OLTL, but it's shit nonetheless. Paige is a nowhere character who has never in any way, shape or form been developed, yet we are supposed to accept that she and Bo are soul mates. When a long-term, veteran character hooks up with someone, we should be able to justify that hook up. No, none of the ABC soaps honor that (Tad and Krystal, Paige and Bo, Sonny and anyone who looks like Brenda and decided to cut her little acting baby teeth in soaps), but it's how it should be. We should get a decent on screen courtship, a lead in, some conflict and such. Not just a new character thrust on the canvas so a character has a place to put his restless, bored penis.\n\nI'd dare to say that none of the couples on OLTL at this time actually work. Natalie and John aren't. Evangeline and John are an exercise in manipulation meets oblivion. Riley, the great singing nutless wonder, is so easily swayed to believe the worst about Jenn that he doesn't even deserve her (and I never thought I would say THAT about Jennifer and anyone). Daniel and Nora are a joke, replaying Nora and Troy without the hotness of Ty Treadway to distract me from the regretful and deplorable story. Kelly and Kevin are tremendously sad in that she is only attractive to him now because he doesn't have her. If she actually belonged to someone else, even better. He wouldn't be able to keep his hands off of her. Renee and Asa are never seen, so we have no clue how they are doing. Blair and Todd are such a train wreck. Marcie and Michael are terrifying in their annoyance factor. Adrianna and Duke are far too busy trying to prove something. Jessica and Antonio are just whacked.\n\nI lied. David and Dorian work. So very well, they work.\n\nSeeing Kevin talking to Vikiall atwitter, his asshairs spontaneously braiding tighter and tighter until he could spill the secret that Todd was unfathomly stupid enough to tell him, was easily one of the most clumsy, cumbersome scenes since Todd punched out Tea. Sure, the drama wasn't as intense, the stakes weren't as high, but it was just as badly scripted and ill-thought out. It's more of the different shit we see in one day of OLTL. Dan Gautier has been quite verbal as of late, almost as eager as Kevin to spill his guts about how shitty the writing is on OLTL. It's a rare bird who will actually come out and call a spade a spade, especially when a paycheck may be at risk if they do, but he definitely was willing to beat the edges of the bush to death.\n\nDaniel \"I know the evidence is there because, dammit, I put it there myself!\" Colson's character only works if we are the least bit invested in him one way or another. If we enjoy him as a reformed bad guy and now good guy to the extreme, sweeping Nora off her feet, it comes as a shock and makes a nice story twist that he murdered Paul. (For which, I personally think, the guy should have a parade thrown in his honor and be given the keys to both Pine Valley and Llanview) If we buy into him as a true villain, then watching him manipulate Nora (ala \"Michael Lazarus\" and Natalie) becomes chilling and unsettling. As it is, he is so lame in either the role of villain or romantic lead that he comes up looking inept and goofy and Nora comes off as vapid and clueless. Once again, a character is being forced to the forefront and we are being asked to accept him as a viable suitor for a veteran character on the show. I know Mitchell Laurence. Mitchell Laurence was a favorite character of mine. You, sir, are no Mitchell Laurence. Besides, the facial hair looks like he put his mouth up to a dirty piece of 5\" PVC.\n\nSpeaking of fashion faux pas, OLTL definitely cleans up in this category as well for all of the different shit we see in one day. Yeah, the bad facial hair on Daniel. We still get to see Poodle Cut 'Tonio in the opening credits, which is a scary, scary thing. Trevor St John's itty bitty head simply does not work with all of that bushy hair all over the place. Having Todd portrayed by such a little guy is dicey at best to start with. Roger Howarth was Todd in every since of the word. He was bigger than life and twice as intimidating, then would melt our hearts in a tender moment with Star or Addie. He brought the conflicted, tortured, damaged soul of Todd Manning to brilliant life, never allowing us to think for even a moment that Todd was \"one of the guys.\" He knew Todd through and through to the point of questioning (at length) the writers' decision to bring Todd to the forefront as \"romantic lead.\" One of the major components of Todd's personality was his extreme sexual dysfunction. Even with women he dearly loved, Tea and Blair, Todd was seldom able to open himself up to full sexual expression. We got the distinct impression that even in the best of times, Todd and Blair's sex life was... complicated and likely rarely expressed.\n\nNow, we have Trevor St John portraying Todd as just an asshole and a smart aleck. He's a horndog to the extreme and he and Blair are going at it like bunnies every other scene (prior to the kidnapping). No way would RH's Todd have been able to perform for Margaret, Viagra or not. Additionally, it is my understanding that \"enhancement\" drugs affect performance ability, not climax. That still comes (no pun intended) the old fashioned way. Unless Margaret was doing some direct withdrawal action at the ol' Prostate Sperm Bank, there's no way she would have gotten what she needed. In fact, had it been Roger Howarth tied to that bed, there would likely be a substantial penalty for early withdrawal.\n\nOf course, we have to cover the clear as day gender bias in this story. If it had been Blair who was raped and forced to bear a child for [insert insane villain's name here], she would have been getting rape counseling, all those near and dear to her would be out for blood and the story would be about her rapist being killed in the most recent murder mystery on OLTL. Instead, Todd will be the one maligned even though he is the victim. Everything from Kevin's self-braiding ass hairs to the looming specter of pregnant Margaret to the wrath of Blair once she finds out what happens. Unfair, much? Stupid, more!\n\nStill, the fact remains that Trevor St John simply cannot carry off the Grizzly Adams look and it makes him look even more diminutive in a previously very \"big\" role. He's not conflicted. He's not tortured. He's not damaged. He's just a jerk. Boooooooooo.\n\nOn with the fashion... Lindsay! PUHLEASE fix Lindsay's hair and wardrobe! Catherine Hickland is SUCH a lovely woman, but (don't make me say it, OK, I'll say it) she is not 22!!\n\nDewwwwke! Your hair! Fix it now!! I can't believe that Adrianna and Duke are going to St Blazes together when a few weeks ago, they couldn't be unsupervised in the living room together.\n\nLine of the week (so far) goes to Bo for suggesting that Asa is at St Blazes, \"where he goes when he's in trouble or faking his own death.\"\n\nAs much as I wanted AJ to be behind Michael's kidnapping, \"murder\" and subsequent kidnapping, I find myself whispering one name over and over, \"O Henry. O Henry. O Henry.\" I think he may find himself in a \"Ransom of Red Chief\" situation in nothing flat and oh how I'd love it if the writers would have the balls to take this horrible, hideous, painful story into a comedic turn. Have Michael find out about the playground dedication. Have him learn somehow that Sonny and Carly are devastated and AJ has lied to him. Then let us watch Little Morty unload his revenge to the point that AJ begs Sonny and Carly to take Michael back because he's been wearing him like a hat make of angry cats. C'mon. Impress me.\n\nImpress me hard.\n\nSpeaking of hard, I couldn't help but notice that in his scene yesterday with Kelly Monaco (gray t-shirt), ol' Steve could have seriously used some nipple tape. They must be keeping the studios pretty chilly because you could have hung your car keys on those things.\n\nI was, however, totally enjoying Kelly Monaco's fingernails. Simple, clean, well shaped, understated... nice for a change. I did really love when she said she \"didn't want a fancy dinner or anything,\" and Steve Burton got that (very married) \"Shit, is it her birthday or something?\" look on his face. Heh heh heh.\n\nI knew Detective Sipowitz. Detective Sipowitz was a favorite character of mine. You, Agent Marshall, are no Detective Sipowitz. (So please, god, please stop trying to be before I choke) If we go by GH standards, all FBI agents are 22 and beautiful. I don't even think they let pretty people into the FBI.\n\nLove Natalia, hate Emily. Hate Natalia AS Emily. When Liz asked Lucky, \"Is she getting worse?\" all I could think was \"Lord, yes.\" Twice more in this one episode was I completely irritated by Emily. First by her plowing into Dillon's scene demanding to know \"what was THAT about!!\" The presumption that everything is, indeed, any of her beeswax is insulting. Then she got all up into Tracy's face, threatening, \"I can have you kicked out of this family and you know I can do it!\" \"You over estimate yourself,\" was hardly the comeback Old Tracy would have given and we can only imagine that she has fully become immersed in the same Dumb Ass Villain Caricature mire as our poor Helena. If we were watching \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" one could only call Emily \"Dip\" to the other toon characters on the GH cast.\n\nMind you, we want Tracy to be bad in the worst way and telling your own son, \"I'll tell the police commissioner that you're banging away at his daughter and worse, I'll cut off your education funds\" just doesn't cut the mustard as overly intimidating, especially when Emily is able to bitch her down. Puhlease. Old Tracy would have been picking pieces of Emily out of her teeth with the pointed shards of her surviving larger bones.\n\nI wanted so much to overlook the fact that not only do we have Miracle Hospital, but we also have Miracle Hospital Training. After her rapid fire RN training (competing nicely with Lucky's rapid fire police training), we are now to believe that Elizabeth minored in Physical Therapy.\n\nStill the scenes of their rapid fire reconnect, Greg Vaughan with his shirt almost off and that amazing scene where Elizabeth spontaneously kisses him, Lucky pulls back and grins, then leans in for another were just priceless. I don't care if it doesn't make sense, I like it. Forget the bushes in his armpits. Forget the fugly tattoo across his back. Forget the ludicrousness of the whole reconnect. (\"I never stopped liking you.\" \"Well, I never stopped liking YOU.\" \"Well, cool, let's make out.\") I never in my life so much wanted to be a petite little fast burning massage therapist/RN. Greg Vaughan is indeed the shiznick.\n\nI'm lost on who we are supposed to be rooting for here. Sonny and Jason orchestrated a hit that killed a lot of people. Isn't that... bad? Oh wait, it was BAD people they decided to kill by taking the law into their own hands, so we're supposed to know that murder ISN'T bad if you're killing bad people. I found myself saying, \"But, but, but... they did it! They're guilty!\" Isn't that like saying, there are bad rapists and there are good rapists? Bad embezzlers and good embezzlers? Bad bank robbers and good bank robbers? Bad murderers and good murderers? Bad gangsters and good gangsters? Sorry, writers, it just doesn't wash.\n\nAnd while we're addressing the powers that be, if we're going to go to the trouble of revamping the opening montage to include the new people who are now on contract, why can't we correct that leetle problem we have of A BLATANT MISOGYNISTIC FINAL SHOT?? How clear are the signals when the last shots are of all of the MEN on the cast, decked out in finery in a panoramic shot? Isn't that directly saying that the women just don't matter? Yeah, guys, put it right out there, loud and clear. How hard would it be to now, for the same amount of time we've had the current end shot, having a shot of all of the women in formal wear? Assholes.\n\nMy Ted King Bitch. (If only Ted King were my bitch) He's so gorgeous. He's a wonderful actor as is evidenced from his performances on \"Charmed.\" He gets little to do but sniff around Carly's skirt, batting at the other guys who are sniffing at Carly's skirt. For the love of god, can't this guy be cast as Julian McMahon's long, lost, hated brother on \"Nip-Tuck\" or something? Give this guy his due somehow, somewhere!\n\nMove over, Jason, there's a new buttplug in town. It looks like Ric is now fully in love with Sonny, so there might be some competition for the better half of the most homo-erotic couple in town.\n\nBest use of fake rain in a scene goes to JaSam. Brenda in the rain. Chloe in the rain. Carly in the rain. Rain is so, so sessy.\n\nAnd that's my gig for this (next) week, folks. Take care and have a stunning week, my darlings.\n\nMuch love,\n\nNote: Sage gets a fat ton of mail every day and regrets he can't answer everyone personally. He loves ya, he just might not get a chance to write to ya! Besides, he writes to you every week in a column whether you write to him or not! Needless to say, if you are an asshole, he just for sure isn't going to write back. If you're inclined to writing hateful things, pretend he wrote back and said, \"That's just like, your opinion, man.\"\n\nIf your writing to ask about future storyline happenings, figure he answered, \"Pfft, I dunno.\" Sage truly does not have info on upcoming storylines except what is posted on the EOS Spoiler Commentary pages!"
