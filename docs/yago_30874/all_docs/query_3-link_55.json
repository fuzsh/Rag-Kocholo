        "text": "Objectives: Despite their overrepresentation, female physicians continue to have lower rates of promotion compared with male physicians. Teaching evaluations play a role in physician advancement. Few studies have investigated gender disparity in resident evaluations of pediatric faculty. We hypothesized that gender disparities in resident evaluations of faculty exist and vary across subspecialties and primary work environments.\n\nMethods: Pediatric faculty institution-specific evaluations completed by residents from January 1, 2015, to March 9, 2020, were obtained from a single academic center. Mean ratings of faculty performance were compared by gender using a Wilcoxon 2-sample test.\n\nResults: Fifteen-thousand one-hundred and forty-two evaluations (5091 of male faculty and 10 051 of female faculty) were included. Female faculty were rated higher in overall teaching ability (female = 4.67 versus male = 4.65; P = .004). There was no statistical difference in the mean ratings of male and female faculty in the inpatient setting, whereas outpatient female faculty were rated higher in overall teaching ability (female = 4.79 versus male = 4.73; P = .005). For general pediatric faculty, females received higher ratings for overall teaching ability (female = 4.75 versus male = 4.70; P < .001). By contrast, there was no difference in ratings of subspecialty pediatric faculty."
