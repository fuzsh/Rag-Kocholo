        "text": "Stress in Children and Adolescents: Tips for Parents\n\nConcerns over changes in family circumstances, such as those caused by financial strain or a\n\nfaltering economy, can cause stress. Children can be affected directly by changes in their family’s\n\nfinancial circumstances or stress they see in their parents, or more indirectly by general anxiety over\n\nproblems they hear and read about in the news. Children look first and foremost to their parents and\n\nother significant adults to gauge the seriousness of their concerns. The following guidance can help\n\nadults help children cope with anxiety or stress.\n\nWhat is Stress?\n\nEveryone is affected by stress and reacts to it in different ways. Stress is a way that our body\n\nresponds to the demands made upon us by the environment, our relationships, and our perceptions and\n\ninterpretations of those demands. We all experience both \"good stress\" and \"bad stress.\" Good stress is\n\nthat optimal amount of stress that results in our feeling energized and motivated to do our best work.\n\nGood stress encourages us to develop effective coping strategies to deal with our challenges, which\n\nultimately contributes to our resilience. Bad stress occurs when our coping mechanisms are\n\noverwhelmed by the stress and we do not function at our best. The same event can affect children and\n\nadults in very individual ways—one person may see a carnival ride as thrilling and another may see it as\n\na major stressor. Stress can become distress when we are unable to cope or when we believe that we do\n\nnot have the ability to meet the challenge. The solution is to adapt, change, and find methods to turn that\n\nbad stress into good stress.\n\nCauses of Stress\n\n• At Home. Stress can occur through a lack of family routines, overscheduling, prolonged or serious illness, poor nutrition, change in the family situation, financial problems, family strife or abuse, or unclear or unreasonable expectations.\n\n• Peer-related. Stress can be a result of changing school buildings, having to deal with a bully, trying to fit in with the crowd, or moving to a new community.\n\nStress tends to be additive in nature and with children can result in inappropriate behaviors, Academic difficulties, or health problems. Parents can usually look back over recent events and see the causes of the behavior through the building of stressful situations.\n\nSymptoms of Stress in Children\n\n• Irritability or unusual emotionality or volatility.\n\n• Sleep difficulty or nightmares.\n\n• Inability to concentrate.\n\n• Drop in grades or other functioning.\n\n• Toileting or eating concerns.\n\n• Headaches or stomachaches.\n\n• Unexplained fears or increased anxiety (that also can take the form of clinging).\n\n• Regression to earlier developmental levels.\n\n• Isolation from family activities or peer relationships.\n\n• Drug or alcohol experimentation.\n\nFactors That Help Prevent Stress\n\n• Positive problem solving and coping skills.\n\n• Close, supportive relationships at home and school, with peers and adults.\n\n• Clear expectations.\n\n• Permission and ability to learn from mistakes.\n\n• Developing competencies (academic, social, extracurricular, and life skills).\n\n• Consistent, positive discipline.\n\n• Ability to express feelings appropriately.\n\n• Feeling physically and emotionally safe.\n\n• Good nutrition, exercise and adequate sleep (10-11 hours for elementary students).\n\n• Time to relax or do recreational activities.\n\nHow Parents Can Help\n\n• Be aware of your child’s behaviors and emotions.\n\n• Build trust with your child.\n\n• Be available and open to talk when your child is ready. If family circumstances are contributing to the stress, be willing to answer questions honestly and calmly.\n\n• Encourage the expression of feelings.\n\n• Teach and model good emotional responses.\n\n• Encourage your child to tell you if he or she feels overwhelmed.\n\n• Encourage healthy and diverse friendships.\n\n• Encourage physical activity, good nutrition, and rest.\n\n• Teach your child to problem solve.\n\n• Keep your child aware of anticipated family changes, in an age-appropriate way. Acknowledge\n\nthat change can feel uncomfortable but reassure him or her that the family will be okay.\n\n• Do not hide the truth from your child. Children sense parents’ worry and the unknown can be\n\nscarier than the truth. However, avoid unnecessary discussions in front of your child (particularly a young child) of events or circumstances that might increase his or her stress.\n\n• Help your child have a part in decision-making when appropriate.\n\n• Remind your child of his or her ability to get through tough times, particularly with the love and support of family and friends.\n\n• Monitor television programs that could worry your child and pay attention to the use of computer games, movies, and the Internet.\n\n• Use encouragement and natural consequences when poor decisions are made.\n\n• Help your child select appropriate extracurricular activities and limit overscheduling.\n\n• Make your child aware of the harmful effects of drugs/alcohol before experimentation begins.\n\n• Monitor your own stress level. Take care of yourself.\n\n• Contact your child’s teacher with any concerns and make them part of the team available to\n\nassist your child.\n\n• Seek the assistance of a physician, school psychologist or private therapist if stress continues to be a concern.\n\nAdapted from: \"Stress in Children: Strategies for Parents and Educators,\" by Ellis P.
