        "text": "Jennifer Paskow is an award winning singer-songwriter on a mission to uplift, heal and empower children and their families. She is honored to receive The ASCAP Foundation’s 2019 Joe Raposo Children’s Music Award. Jennifer’s album Make A Circle garnered a prestigious Parents’ Choice® award with the praise “Make a Circle is Jennifer Paskow’s stunning debut into Family music.” She also won in The International Songwriting Competition for her songs, “On the Inside” and “The I Love You Song.”\n\nJennifer’s heartfelt songs emanate a warmth that engenders an intimacy with her audience and just makes people feel good. Born of a mission to bring more love into the world, Jennifer’s music introduces children to the idea that learning to love and accept oneself is the first step to loving and accepting others while embracing everyone’s differences. She has integrated this with her playful spirit to create music that is life affirming and joyful.\n\nMost recently, Jennifer has been featured as a vocalist and co-writer on beloved family music artist Renee and Friends’ latest release, Kindred, along with Ziggly Marley, Lisa Loeb, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Secret Agent 23 Skidoo.\n\nJennifer’s journey into the world of Children’s music began as a volunteer singing for kids in hospitals with The Art of Elysium in Los Angeles. She remembers the profound experience she had with a little boy who had autism. She was singing and dancing with him and “it was if the whole world had stopped around us, we were connected inside the music,” says Jennifer. It was there in the hospital while witnessing the profound power of music to heal and connect people with themselves and others, that her mission with children was sparked.\n\nJennifer's songs are sung in elementary schools and in early childhood education centers around the country. Her songs can be heard on Kinderling Radio and Little Rockers Radio in Australia and other children's programming around the US. Jennifer performs and teaches at early childhood education centers, libraries, and festivals around the nation. She’s very excited to share her music and meditation program for children and families that will be released in 2020."
