        "text": "My road trip around the Castle Mountains included a stop in White Sulphur Springs and while there I might as well see the grandest landmark there: the Castle.\n\nThis stone mansion now has a carriage house museum with an up-close and personal look at horsedrawn luxury driving and the 19th century lifestyle.\n\nThe Christmas carol is right, kids. There really is such a thing as a \"one-horse open sleigh.\"\n\nYou've seen Westerns on film with the stagecoach coming to town. The Carriage House has one and I noticed two things about it. The first is the complete lack of shock absorbers. Passengers felt every bump, rock and hold on the road.\n\nThe second is that there is more room in a compact car than the passenger space on this stagecoach. Travelers probably hoped the others bathed, otherwise they kept the doors open despite the dust.\n\nI swear, if it weren't for the little sign, I would think this is a hearse. It is actually a cab for ferrying people between the hotels and the railroad.\n\nUpstairs from the wagons are the displays with workplace relics from the 19th and early 20th century. There is doctor's equipment, photo processing and a bank tellers' station.\n\nWhen a lady there said this next item, I responded \"a what?\"\n\nYes, it is what you think it is. Staff here call it the \"Casket Basket.\" Was used to carry a dead body from a home to the undertaker.\n\nThere are many more items here in the Carriage House, well worth an hour or two of your time to explore.\n\nThe Castle and Carriage House is located at 310 2nd Avenue NE in White Sulphur Springs. It's north of the main street through town and on a hill so you almost can't miss it.\n\nThe Castle and Carriage House are only open in summer from May 15 to September 15 starting at 10:00 a.m., so you only have a few weeks to see this magnificent dwelling. Admissions is only $10 for adults and less for others.\n\nComing up next: my tour of the Castle itself. Stay tuned."
