        "text": "Laurence Lau recast as Sam Rappaport on OLTL. Sam was old enough to be Todd's father and in fact was a surrogate father to Todd and suddenly here comes tiny, very young even for his age little Laurence Lau as Sam. I really stopped watching around then but I can't imagine how much further the ridiculousness got. It had to totally destroy the Sam/Todd relationship and if it was still going on the Sam Blair relationship too for Sam now looked young enough to be Todd and Blair's son.\n\nAs far as Tina on OLTL I couldn't stand EV or any of the Tina's or the character.\n\nLOL on Crawford taking over for her daughter. I remember my dad was home during the day at that time because of a strike or shift change or something and my mom faithfully watched Secret Storm. My dad could not get over old Crawford playing the 24 year old character. He would laugh his way through the show every day she was on, especially when she was doing scenes with the young actor who played Christina's character's husband or boyfriend or whatever. I think that was one of Joan's biggest embarrassments. Just cringe worthy.\n\nR105 Which is why it is understandable to prefer one portrayal over the other. That's a matter of taste. I personally thought that, while a different take, her character was not a wide departure from who Timmins was portraying. A different kind of spunky and sexy but spunky and sultry nevertheless. But I continue to say that the general consensus that Evans \"ruined\" the character is unfair to her and is entirely linked to late-era-Paulina which was indeed dreadful but because of the writing. She didn't change the character in a completely different direction: they did.\n\nLet me offer a parallel: I think we can all agree that Anna Stuart was a vastly superior Donna Love than Philece Sampler. Not because Philece Sampler was not a good actress. And she clearly had a different take on the character but it was still by large Donna Love. So no one thinks she \"ruined\" the character. She just wasn't as great. You may or may not think Judy Evans was \"as great\" as Paulina but the reason we consider her character \"ruined\" was due to the writing, several years after the recast.\n\nNow you might argue that the writing went in that direction because of things that were inherent to Judy Evans - like her real-life pregnancies and weight gain. I say that's because the writing teams of those last six years were absolutely crap with no imagination or respect for the show.\n\n[quote]Gellar was very good earlier in her stint in AMC.\n\nGellar's first year was great, she was kind of one note the second year. I am not sure if it was because she was bored, or if it was due to the growing fued with Lucci, or simply the story lines were pretty weak post-Richard Fields (although I liked her relationship with Janet). There was also a bit more of a mystery with Kendell her first year - you were not sure whether she wanted to destroy Erica or be accepted by her (and not sure Kendell herself knew). After she lied about Dimitiri raping her, she was much more of a two-dimensional villain and her performance was less layered. Much more one-note shouting.\n\nI did not watch Buffy through the end of the series, but I heard her performance on that show in later years also became a bit more flat, as if she had become bored with the show.\n\nR40 It was HILARIOUS how then EP Paul Rauch and head writer Maria Arena Bell tried to sell the Darius McCrary recast of \"Malcolm Winters.\" .. From their interview with Michael Fairman:\n\n---------------\n\nMICHAEL:When the two of you are in auditions together, do you know immediately when the right actor walks in for the part you are casting?\n\nMARIA: We have been really in sync, such as the character of Daisy. When Yvonne Zima came in to read for that role, it was like, “Wow, did she pop!” She made us go, “Oh, my gosh. She is fantastic!” You just feel it…. that everything we have talked about in regards to that character, and then that person walks in, you know it. It was also true of Darius.\n\nPAUL: The Darius McCray audition was one of the greatest the network had seen in 20 years.\n\nMARIA: The quality of the actors that were up for the role was extraordinarily high. Everyone who came in for the final audition, and there were four in the finals, they were all fantastic. They were all very different from one another, and in the end, it was about this kind of special quality that Darius had. We just felt that “Star Quality”.\n\n---------------\n\nMeanwhile, viewers were like, you can't be serious!?. .. Malcom is supposed to be a fashion photographer, and Darius couldn't even hold and operate a camera properly.\n\nThe Reverend story was an example of a soap shooting itself in the foot trying to have a shocking twist. They could have simply had him be someone who had killed someone drunken driving and Brooke might have gotten past it, but they had to have the shocking twist he was Laura's killer with plastic surgery so she did not recognize him. Of course the actor was about a foot taller than the original driver and aged about 15 years (the cop who ran over Laura was a peer of Cecily ). The audience could not buy that Brooke would ever forgive him (and they were right) so he was gone. Too bad, because I liked the actor and he had chemistry with Brooke.\n\nI have no idea what they were thinking when they had Brooke be involved with a child pornographer -- who of course had happened to victimize Laura. Then they have her shoot him in the back and go on trial for murder claiming justifiable homicide.\n\nGreat actress great character, and perfect foil for Erica, but I am not sure she truly had a good story line after Edmund and the ill-advised marriage to Tad (which also seemed out of character, since she was smart enough to know Tad really loved Dixie and Brooke was at a point where she did to marry a man just because he was the father of her child).\n\nSo Brooke was involved with the revolving Piereces to dating the person who did pornos with her underage daughter Laura (and also murdered a plane full of people), to dating a reverend who had a complete face reconstruction so she could not recognize him as the person who killed her other daughter (whose name her adopted daughter shared making their initial story line have a bit of a creepy stalker feel to it). Later Laura the second was recast by an actress so bad, people cheered for Greenlee to toss her off a boat and they ended up writing her off as crazy.\n\nLater after years of fans wanting her back with Edmund they had them marry only to have Brooke again act out of character and hide the fact that Maria, Edmund;s wife did not die on the plane crash cause by Brooke's ex-boyfriend [who she killed] but was alive. This was also when I knew AMC was never coming back and might have stopped watching for the most part. They had a triangle with a lot of history and good chemistry between all the characters and immediately got rid of one of the parties and instead brought in pretty boy Aiden with no history to be the tension in the triangle and had Maria run around in a bikini like she was 20 years old.\n\nFinally they ended up taking her off contract and just had her disappear - no exit story and just some rare random references that she was somewhere on assignment. They really did not treat her like she deserved to be treated. At least she was used well with Adam's exit and the finale and had some good scenes with Adam and with Erica.\n\nI'm trying to remember the timing on the Faux Silver story. I think she may have started in the summer of '82, when I was watching over school break. Then she started to go from duckling to swan in late '82, and I caught those episodes on Thanksgiving and Christmas break. Kent probably died early '83, so I caught up over winter break, and I remember Erica hiding out at the boardinghouse so that was probably spring break. But then when summer rolled around, Silver was gone, and when I heard how they finished the storyline I was a little let down.\n\nWatching those clips, I feel much the same way. It could be the way they're edited, but the whole story seems so rushed at the end. Tad shows up with the info and a week or two later, Silver's gone. I really felt like they could have played it out a little further. (Or even better, kept Silver around as a villain, like Heather Webber.)\n\nWasn't Brian's (Matt;s) return always supposed to be short term? Part of the problem with his return is that they changed the character. I barely remember it - but I think he was now a slick Hollywood type where he had been an honest salt of the earth character during his first run of the show.\n\nHayley and Mateo had good chemistry, but I thought it was mistake to tied a daughter of Adam Chandler to one man and settling down as the owner of a bar, esp. since they did it while she was in early twenties. She should have been involved with some of the corporate intrigue and had a number of relationships instead of just basically becoming Mrs. Mateo Santos. They really seemed reluctant to truly break them up. I think the most they ever even went was having Hayley kiss Ryan (who she actually had chemistry with) and Mateo being manipulated by the mother of his unknown child."
