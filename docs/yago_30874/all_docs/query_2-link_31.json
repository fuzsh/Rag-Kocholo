        "text": "Discussion\n\nReports of longitudinal cohorts tracking asthma severity over time and featuring multiple characterization elements are limited (17, 21–23). The variability of severity over time supports asthma’s heterogeneity, and here, we show that asthma has a dynamic course from childhood to early adulthood. Asthma remission in late adolescence and early adulthood has been a major focus of research (17), but during this critical period—when many adolescents and young adults believe that their asthma has gone away—there is still a significant minority who suffer from severe disease. We found that 12–19% of participants who had mild to moderate asthma in early childhood and were followed over 10–18 years had features consistent with severe asthma between 17 and 23 years of age. Six percent had severe asthma both during adolescence and during early adulthood. In our univariate analysis of over 20 relevant factors in early childhood, the following factors were predictors at baseline: younger age, male sex, the absence of hay fever, a low pre- and postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio, and asthma severity at baseline. Long-term treatment with an ICS, the mainstay therapy for persistent asthma, was not a significant factor associated with asthma severity. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and a low postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio were found to be predictors of the persistence of severe asthma from late adolescence to early adulthood in our multivariate model. We also determined that reduced growth from childhood to early adulthood was associated with severe asthma.\n\nAsthma activity over time was dynamic ( ). Although most participants with asthma improved from late adolescence to early adulthood, approximately half did not change severity status, and one-fifth worsened. On the basis of our findings, clinicians should consider asthma severity to be more fluid than static, especially when counseling participants about their long-term prognosis.\n\nWe found that as many as 12–19% of participants had features of severe asthma between 17 and 23 years of age on the basis of our definition, but likely only 6% had severe asthma that persisted from adolescence to early adulthood. This is consistent with the published estimates of 5–10% (5, 6), which lends support to our selection of elements used to identify these individuals. Those with severe asthma also had reduced lung function, had increased bronchodilator reversibility, had more ED visits, and were on higher ICS doses, further supporting our definition ( ). Baseline characteristics were generally similar among severity groups. Individuals with severe asthma in early adulthood and those with persistence of severe asthma from late adolescence to early adulthood were predominantly male. In our univariate analysis, male sex was also a predictive factor for the persistence of severe asthma. A large proportion of our participants were undertreated and were classified as having severe asthma on the basis of lung function, which may explain the male predominance. Although adult women have a higher prevalence of asthma and more frequent use of asthma-related health care, they also have better lung function when compared with adult men (24). Furthermore, McGeachie and colleagues (18) previously found male sex to be a predictor of lung function decline in the CAMP cohort. It is unclear what drives lower lung function in males, but hormones may play a role (25).\n\nStudies regarding factors collected in early childhood that influence or predict severe asthma status in adulthood are limited. In this study, which spans late adolescence and early adulthood, we identified early childhood evidence that a low postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio and maternal smoking during pregnancy were significant childhood predictors of severe asthma. The postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio is a noninvasive marker of pathologic airway remodeling in asthma (26, 27). Here, we demonstrate that for every 5% decrease in the postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio, participants were 2.36-fold more likely to have a persistently severe phenotype during a stage of life when asthma usually improves.\n\nLung function in childhood to adolescence and adulthood has been used as a surrogate of airway remodeling (18, 28, 29). Pathologic airway remodeling in asthma may lead to irreversible airflow obstruction and poor outcomes (30, 31). Unfortunately, little is known about the mechanisms that induce pathologic airway remodeling (32, 33). Recent studies have focused on early-life influences during asthma inception that may lead to irreversible lung function deficits, such as the microbial environment of the airway and gut or patterns of weight gain (34). Those in our cohort were mostly atopic at baseline and at the time of assessment in late adolescence and early adulthood. Those with severe and persistent asthma had higher serum IgE concentrations in late adolescence and higher eosinophil numbers in early adulthood than participants with intermittent and remitting asthma. Although biological therapies targeting type 2 inflammation have shown promise in improving asthma outcomes, less is known about their effect on long-term airway remodeling. Some studies have hinted at a reversal of airway remodeling, particularly with omalizumab, which has been the most studied (35). More research is needed to fully address whether—and to what extent—biological therapy of asthma can affect long-term airway remodeling.\n\nParticipants whose mothers smoked during pregnancy had a 3.17-fold–higher likelihood of having persistently severe asthma from late adolescence to early adulthood. Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been associated with an increased incidence of asthma (36) and decreased lung function in childhood (36, 37). Here, we suggest that maternal smoking may also be an important prognostic factor for the persistence of severe asthma. Smoking exposure in utero may start pathologic lung remodeling earlier, and some evidence suggests that this may be due to epigenetic modifications (38). Although smoking prevention in pregnancy to prevent asthma is clearly desired, we add that individuals with asthma whose mothers smoked during pregnancy may also need closer monitoring.\n\nAmong participants with severe asthma in late adolescence and early adulthood, over two-thirds had a reduced-growth trajectory pattern ( , , Figure E2). Furthermore, among participants whose asthma remained severe between late adolescence and early adulthood, almost all (96%) had reduced lung growth. Participants with a trajectory pattern of reduced growth and participants with a trajectory pattern of reduced growth with early decline were 16.38 times more likely (95% CI, 2.03–132.30; P = 0.0087) and 13.13 times more likely (95% CI, 1.56–110.61), respectively, to have persistence of severe asthma than participants with normal growth. Patients with normal growth but early decline did not have an increased likelihood of experiencing a persistence of severe asthma. Severity is likely driven by lung function, and an earlier start to the decline (reduced growth vs. normal growth) was more predictive than the trajectory pattern (early decline vs. no decline) for the persistence of severe asthma. A meta-analysis found irreversible airflow obstruction to be much more common in severe asthma (30). These participants with severe asthma may represent those who progress further and have worse outcomes over time. McGeachie and colleagues (18) evaluated the predictors of lung function decline in the CAMP study. They reported the following predictors of early decliners compared with those who did not decline: lower baseline FEV1 values, a smaller bronchodilator response, airway hyperresponsiveness at baseline, maternal smoking during gestation, and male sex. We found that many of these factors also predict the persistence of severe asthma. Taken together, it may be prudent to check lung function as early as possible and to monitor those with asthma more closely if they start with low function in childhood.\n\nAn earlier age at randomization, a lower prebronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio at baseline, and a physician diagnosis of moderate versus mild asthma at baseline were significant predictors of the persistence of severe asthma in our univariate model. The results of the univariate analysis suggest that features of persistent asthma in younger patients may lead to earlier lung function impairment and worse outcomes. Parental asthma in childhood was identified as a predictor of the persistence of severe asthma in our multivariate model, although this was not quite significant (P = 0.06). Parental asthma is a well-established predictor of asthma diagnosis and is commonly used in predictive measures such as the Asthma Predictive Index (39). Here, we postulate that patients with a genetic predisposition toward asthma may have an earlier onset of lung function decline, which may affect the persistence of a severe phenotype. Collinearity with the asthma onset–related covariates mentioned earlier may explain why the prebronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio and parental asthma were not identified and did not reach significance, respectively, in our multivariate model.\n\nHay fever as a protective factor for the persistence of severe asthma from late adolescence to early adulthood was significant only in our univariate model. Hay fever in our study represents seasonal rhinitis symptoms, as it was evaluated in terms of whether the child had any eye itchiness, runny nose symptoms, or sneezing that recurred over several weeks in a particular season at any time for at least 2 consecutive years. Substantial evidence exists that allergic rhinitis leads to an increased risk of asthma (40) and worse asthma outcomes (41). An adjustment for aeroallergen sensitization in the multivariate model likely led to lack of significance in our multivariate model (P = 0.09). The reporting of hay fever in the child may simply represent a more observant or involved parent, which may explain its protective quality in the univariate analysis.\n\nTreatment with an ICS for at least 4 years during the CAMP study did not affect the development of more severe disease later on in life. Treatment with ICS therapy also did not modify the lung function trajectory (18) or the incidence of asthma remission in early adolescence (16). However, shared decision-making discussions with the families of children with persistent asthma should include an emphasis on the fact that the therapy available for asthma at this time is aimed at reducing the immediate asthma burden (such as symptom improvement or preventing exacerbations) and that whether long-term goals such as reducing airway remodeling or preventing a worsening of asthma later on in life will be achieved is not predictable.\n\nOur study had several strengths. The CAMP cohort was well characterized from beginning to end, with a majority having long-term follow-up for an average of 14 years. The detailed longitudinal follow-up reduced observational bias and allowed control for many relevant covariates from childhood to adolescence and early adulthood.\n\nThere were limitations to our study. This is a post hoc analysis, and not all measurements were performed at every visit. We were only able to evaluate 682 participants because they had data available in late adolescence and early adulthood. This number matches CAMP studies that have analyzed data from the original cohort and have evaluated the long-term lung function trajectory by using outcome measures evaluated in early adulthood (17). In that study, the characteristics of the 684 participants with at least one spirometric measurement at the age of 23 years or older—as compared with the remaining 357 participants—were analyzed. Multiple logistic regression analyses that compared baseline characteristics of completers (n = 681) with noncompleters (n = 351) were performed. Participants with data at the age of 23 years or older (completers) were older (P < 0.0001) and were more likely to be prepubertal at baseline (P = 0.008) than the remaining participants (n = 355). Otherwise, they were similar with respect to sex, race or ethnic group, asthma severity, the interval between asthma diagnosis and enrollment, the atopy status, and the assigned treatment group. Methacholine challenge results were only available for 437 (64%) and 326 (48%) participants in the late adolescence and early adulthood groups, respectively. A definition of remitting asthma on the basis of methacholine challenge results would be limited. More notable changes and measurements of exposure in the environment, such as acquiring new pets, home water damage, or moving to another city, were not quantified in the observational phase in CAMP. Results may have been different if other criteria for severe asthma had been used. We used the ATS definition of severe asthma for participants receiving a high dose of ICSs to best capture therapy-resistant severe asthma (9). The ATS definition of severe asthma was reevaluated in a combined effort with the European Respiratory Society in 2014 (10). We did not use the European Respiratory Society–ATS criteria because they use subjective questionnaires not collected in our cohort and were published after the CAMP cohort observational period. Furthermore, to capture undertreated asthma—a common problem in adolescent populations (42) and pediatric populations (43–45)—and to match criteria used in our studied cohort previously (16), we used the NAEPP EPR 3 definition of severe asthma with refined risk criteria for patients not receiving a high dose of ICSs (8).\n\nPrevious CAMP studies focused on remission rather than on severe asthma. Our remission rate of 3–5% was similar to previous estimates (16, 17). The more recent study by Wang and colleagues (17) found a higher remission rate of 15% in adulthood (ages of 18–23 yr) when compared with our study, which found a 12% remission rate in early adulthood (ages of 21–23 yr). However, this is likely due to school absenteeism or the lack of accessing medical care in the criteria from Wang and colleagues, which were included in the present study to better match the previous CAMP publications (16).\n\nIn conclusion, patients who had lower postbronchodilator lung function and had experienced maternal smoking during pregnancy were more likely to have persistence of severe asthma through the critical period of late adolescence to early adulthood. Early lung function decline likely drives severity. These findings should be validated in other longitudinal cohorts from childhood to early adulthood. Immunologic changes or lung remodeling may begin earlier than the onset of asthma symptoms. Future studies should focus on interventions to preserve lung function that may prevent and reverse disease progression."
