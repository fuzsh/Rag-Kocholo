        "text": "As the President and Head of School, I am honored to reflect on the power of giving during the 2022-23 school year. In fact, it is the power of your giving that makes a difference here at Viewpoint.\n\nWe envision “a world where education changes lives.” Lives of our students and lives of all those that they will impact in the future. To bring this about, our teachers and our staff are the difference makers in a life-changing education. And so—giving is the difference maker in schools. It gives us the ability to recruit, retain, develop, and recognize great teachers. None of this is possible without the power of giving. As I write this, we are in the midst of another year of incredible philanthropy at Viewpoint, with an inspiring Annual Benefit right around the corner. It gives me joy to reflect on last year’s success as the foundation for this year’s moonshot.\n\nAt Viewpoint, we create exceptional readiness for extraordinary futures. Together, we cultivate the critical skill set, courageous mindset, and resilient identity of each individual student.\n\nThe Viewpoint Fund fuels this mission.\n\nWithout the support of our Viewpoint Fund donors, we simply could not offer best-in-class curricular and extracurricular programs delivered by talented and inspiring faculty. Every single gift contributes to a margin of excellence. As you scroll through this report, you will discover the impact of your gifts, and we are truly grateful for your generosity.\n\nWe also know the Power of One— that one simple act from one individual or family can be transformational in the lives of our students.\n\nOn May 13, 2023, our community came together for Viewpoint’s 40th Annual Benefit at the Skirball Cultural Center with hundreds of parents, alumni, grandparents, and staff gathering to celebrate the creation of the Cathy Adelman Endowment Fund for Financial Aid, the first-ever endowment fund to focus exclusively on tuition assistance for students in our Primary and Lower Schools. We grossed $1.4 million, surpassing last year’s record-breaking results by $200,000. This stunning success is a testament to the philanthropic heart of our community and to our shared commitment to Viewpoint’s World Ready promise.\n\nIn Cathy’s words, “. . . I really believe we’re going to change lives with the generosity of our community. That just means everything to me. What more could you want in your life but to feel like you’ve made a difference. And we will, and we are making a difference in every child that’s here. I really truly believe that with all my heart, but now children that would not have been able to come are going to be here.”\n\nThis is the power of philanthropy, and this is Our Viewpoint.\n\nOnward,\n\nMark McKee"
