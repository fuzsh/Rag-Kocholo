        "text": "History\n\n“I tell everyone at every conference that if you can only go to one conference a year, this should be it! There is nowhere else to network with youth garden experts. There is Ag in the Classroom, but it’s not mainly gardens. This is the conference for any youth horticulture educator. Even though I’ve been coming 14 years, I still learn new things every time! And meet new people that I correspond with and collaborate with!” – Shelley Mitchell, Oklahoma State University\n\n“I was fortunate to attend the NYCGS through one of their scholarships and I’m so glad I was able to take advantage of the opportunity. As a new outdoor educator, being able to spend time with my peers from other regions was invaluable for me. I made great connections that I have already followed up with regarding implementing programming this school year. The symposium solidified for me that allowing young people to immerse themselves in nature – based education is not just important, but should be commonplace in all learning environments.” – Natalie M. Green, Community Agriculturalist with Henrico County Public Schools\n\n“As a first-time attendee I was blown away by the breadth and depth of offerings. I’m not aware of another event that includes such a variety of practitioners who are passionate about children in gardens. (Not just outdoors, but GARDENS!)” – Dawn Kairis, Middlesex, NC"
