        "text": "by Gary Romeo\n\nIntroduction\n\nI’m not sure when or where I first heard of “pulps.” Most likely I read of them when reading about the history of comic books but I didn’t take any real interest in them until Marvel Comics published Conan the Barbarian and I became hooked on the work of Robert E. Howard. Once I started reading Howard I also started reading his fellow pulp authors H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith (all in paperback reprints, of course). I wanted to know more about the pulps and Weird Tales in particular. I bought Tony Goodstone’s The Pulps to satisfy this curiosity.\n\nFrom reading Goodstone I learned that the first pulp was publisher Frank Munsey’s The Argosy. His was the first magazine to print fiction on rough wood-pulp paper. Other publishers followed this cost saving moneymaking formula and the era of the pulps was in full force. The pulps lasted from 1896 to 1953. The pulp hey-days were the 20’s, 30’s and 40’s. There were 100’s of different titles being published covering every known literary genre and creating some new ones in the process. The end of the pulps came in 1953 when a major distributor refused to distribute anything other than “slicks” and digest sized magazines.\n\nAfter reading Robert E. Howard and other Weird Tales writers I proceeded onto Edgar Rice Burroughs. Burroughs seems a little less the pulp writer to me than Howard for a few reasons. Not because his writing is any better but because Tarzan made a successful transition to books and movies years before I was born. Also Burroughs lacks anything like Howard’s pulp connection to Weird Tales. Weird Tales is of interest to me not just because of Howard. His camaraderie with H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, August Dereleth and others makes me want to read the lot of these pulp writers.\n\nWeird Tales\n\n“Few publications of any kind can claim greater artistic integrity, commitment to an audience and persistence in the face of almost overwhelming obstacles than Weird Tales.” Weird Tales was started in 1923, lasted 30 years, and never made a profit. Publisher Clark Henneberger sold Weird Tales to another publisher after a year. Editor Edward Baird was replaced by Farnsworth Wright. Weird Tales was sold again in 1938 and Dorothy McIlwraith replaced Wright. The magazine suspended publication in 1954.\n\nThe best years for Weird Tales readers were under Wright’s editorship. (H. P. Lovecraft was offered the job of editor before Wright but he didn’t want to move to Chicago where the editorial offices were.) Wright published the first weird fiction work of Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert Bloch, and Tennessee Williams, among others. But McIlwraith’s reign was definitely not without merit as she published Ray Bradbury, Fritz Leiber, Richard Matheson, and Theodore Sturgeon, among others.\n\nWeird Tales also had some of the finest artists in the business: Hugh Rankin, Hannes Bok, J. Allan St. John, and Margaret Brundage, among others. One of the most popular covers is the much-reproduced “Bat-Woman” painting that appeared on the October, 1933 issue. This cover is reproduced in most pulp cover collections and was used as an album cover for rock group Golden Smog’s album titled “Weird Tales.”\n\nSeabury Quinn was the most popular writer according to the then current Weird Tales readers. Quinn appeared in 165 issues of the magazines 279 issue run. Seabury Quinn’s tales of Jules deGrandin, a supernatural detective, were consistently voted the issues favorite story. Another popular write was Rev. Henry S. Whitehead. Whitehead’s stories sometimes featured a West Indies background. He was an Acting Archdeacon in the Virgin Islands, a Harvard graduate, and an ordained deacon of the Episcopal Church. But modern readers have picked H. P. Lovecraft to be the graduate with honors.\n\nLovecraft first appeared in the October 1923 issue of Weird Tales and was featured in several following issues. These were stories that had been written years earlier. The Nameless City written in 1921 is considered the first Cthulhu Mythos tale although the tale that gave the mythos its name, The Call of Cthulhu, didn’t appear in Weird Tales until February 1928. Lovecraft corresponded with his fellow Weird Tales writers and they contributed to his pantheon. “The Unique Magazine” produced a unique body of work.\n\nAfter Lovecraft died in 1937, August Dereleth and Donald Wandrei formed Arkham House to keep Lovecraft’s work in print. “Dereleth’s tireless championing of H. P. Lovecraft eventually paid off in some rather surprising ways. All those weird fiction anthologies he edited served not only to keep Lovecraft’s name alive, but to spread his fame among somewhat more literate circles than those of the readership of Weird Tales.”\n\nToday H. P. Lovecraft can be found in any chain bookstore with other best-selling horror writers. His work has been packaged in trade paperbacks, Penguin classics, fannish collections from publishers like Chaosium, and collected in an impressive book edited by Pulitzer Prize winning author, Joyce Carol Oates.\n\nThe Hero Pulps\n\nA few years passed and I started reading (then popular) science-fiction author Phillip Jose Farmer for his Tarzan related stuff and got hooked on Doc Savage and other pulp heroes in the process. After trying Doc, I tried the Shadow, the Spider, G-8, and the Avenger. I only read one book a piece for most of these other characters though. Perhaps I like the idea of “hero pulps” more so than actually reading them.\n\nThe Great Pulp Heroes by Don Hutchison is a nice history of the major and some minor hero pulps. The book gives a nice introduction into just what these “cheap pulp paper sandwiched between eye-searing covers” product meant to the masses that bought them. Luckily a lot of the best work from the pulps was reprinted in paperbacks decades later. Following the layout of The Great Pulp Heroes, I will go over some of the major pulp heroes.\n\nOne of the most popular pulp heroes was The Shadow. The Shadow sold well and spawned comics, big little books, and several movie serials. The Shadow started as a mysterious voice on Street & Smith’s Detective Story radio show. The radio show was used to publicize their magazine line. Fans of the radio show became interested in this “Shadow” character.\n\nWalter Gibson, a newspaperman and part-time magician, was given the task of creating this “Shadow” character in print. The first story kept the Shadow in the shadows and featured Harry Vincent as a desperate man who becomes involved with the Shadow and his band of operatives. The story, The Living Shadow, appeared in the first issue of The Shadow dated April 1931under the Maxwell Grant pseudonym and was an immediate hit. Gibson went on to write 283 Shadow adventures (only a fraction of his output as a writer!)\n\nThe Shadow became the star of his own radio show that was even more popular than the pulp. The radio Shadow and the pulp Shadow were slightly different in that on the radio the Shadow was Lamont Cranston. In the pulps Lamont Cranston was a ruse identity. The Shadow was really an aviator named Kent Allard. (Phillip Jose Farmer in his book Tarzan, Alive suggested that Kent Allard had multiple personalities and was also the pulp heroes, the Spider and G-8; he backtracked from this after fan disapproval.)\n\nSales of the pulp declined as ratings for the radio show increased. Elements from the radio show crept into the pulps. An author named Bruce Elliot replaced Walter Gibson. Gibson was brought back in 1949 for three issues but the end was at hand. After 325 issues, The Shadow pulp was no more. The radio show lasted until 1954, lingering in the public’s mind even longer.\n\nThe Shadow was unable to sustain his popularity but the vigilante hero remains a standard fixture in popular entertainment. Batman, being the Shadow’s most obvious successor. (Of course, the Shadow had his precedents in characters like The Scarlet Pimpernel and Zorro.) The Charles Bronson character in the Death Wish movie series is a good example of a modern vigilante hero. There is a brief Shadow reference in that film if you look hard enough. The Shadow was resurrected for a movie in 1994. Alec Baldwin played Lamont Cranston/The Shadow in a movie directed by Russell Mulcahy of Highlander fame. It was a mildly entertaining movie that mucked with the Shadow’s history to the dismay of hardcore fans.\n\nThe next most popular hero was Street & Smith’s Doc Savage. Clark Savage, Jr., the scientific superman was created by Lester Dent, writing under the house name, Kenneth Robeson. Street & Smith, head honchos, Henry Ralston and John Nanovic created the basic outlines of the character in a 30 page outline given to Dent.\n\nDent added his own unique outlook, Doc’s five helpmates (and later Doc’s beautiful cousin, Patricia Savage) and created the first Doc novel, The Man of Bronze published in the March 1933 issue of Doc Savage magazine. Dent wrote 165 of the 181 issues. Doc was never as successful as the Shadow in other mediums but the pulps sold just as well and sometimes better. Doc’s magazine began a sales descent in the 40’s. Doc’s adventures became a bit more realistic and less was seen of his five comrades. Doc’s final adventure in the summer of 1949 was a blast back to the science-fiction fantasy of earlier days with Doc venturing into Hell to fight evil at its source.\n\nDent died years before Bantam’s paperback reprinting of the series. The James Bama covers were a hit with new Doc fans but the old guard criticized them. “Phillip Jose Farmer wrote that Bama’s Doc looked to him like a 55-year-old ex-Mr. Universe down on his luck.”\n\nDoc Savage: Arch Enemy of Evil by Larry Widen and Chris Miracle is a great reference to Doc’s adventures. The book gives a nice introduction to Doc and his amazing 5 plus Pat Savage. The book proceeds to reproduce each one of the 181 pulp magazine covers (B &W, alas; I’m a big fan of the covers from the “Science Detective” period and would have loved color reproductions) and gives a brief synopsis of each adventure. It then gives a short bio of Lester Dent. The book then goes onto discuss the Bantam paperback reprints. The artists, particular James Bama, are discussed. Bama is to Doc as Frazetta is to Conan. Bantam published a “found” adventure, The Red Spider, as part of the series, giving Doc a total of 182 adventures.\n\nAs mentioned before, Doc Savage was a successful pulp but never really a successful crossover to radio, comic books, or movies. Street & Smith altered the Doc character in comics to make him more of a standard superhero in the 40’s without success. Marvel Comics adapted the character in the 70’s using the James Bama look. Doc was finally brought to the movie screen in a 1975 movie produced by Science-Fiction movie pioneer George Pal and starring ex-Tarzan actor, Ron Ely. The movie was a low-budget affair and probably because of this “camp” elements were added. A John Phillips Sousa music score was the worst offender. The movie is fine when it adheres to its pulp source. The post credits opening scene with an Indian warrior scaling a skyscraper attempting to assassinate Doc is effective and the chase scene that follows is a real highlight. Some of the “camp” elements are even good. Doc and Monja’s “love scene” works well. Doc, instead of kissing her, cutely taps her chin and says, “Monja, you’re a brick.” This is genuinely funny and consistent with Doc’s pulp persona. All of the actors are very good but the campy tone and low budget really hurt the whole production. The movie was a box office failure and most Doc fans cringe at its mention. Rumors persist of a new Doc Savage movie usually associated with Dwayne Johnson or other action star in the role.\n\nDoc was pastiched by Phillip Jose Farmer in both straight and pornographic versions. Doc is given a biographical treatment in Farmer’s, Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life. Farmer also wrote a (mostly) straight Doc Savage adventure called Escape from Loki that is very entertaining. This novel introduces a 16 year old Clark Savage, Jr. and tells the story how he met his amazing five comrades. Farmer created his own “Doc Caliban” character in The Mad Goblin and A Feast Unknown. A Feast Unknown is a genuine marvel filled with bestiality, buggery, and other bizarre sexual episodes. Will Murray (a fan turned writer, sort of an excellent combination of Glenn Lord and L. Sprague de Camp) wrote a few Doc Savage adventures based on Dent’s outlines in a short lived series of paperbacks. What the future holds for Doc, not even the Shadow knows.\n\nAnother popular character was the fighting aviator, G-8. G-8 re-fought WWI for 110 issues. Popular Publication’s head, Henry “Harry” Steeger teamed with writer Robert J. Hogan to create G-8 and his Battle Aces. Hogan’s stories were particularly gruesome. Much more bloody than even the results of the Shadow’s twin .45s. Hogan was able to avoid using a house name and wrote all of the G-8 adventures. G-8 was reissued as paperbacks in the late 70’s. After reading the reprinted Docs, Shadows, and Spider’s perhaps G-8’s adventures were nothing new. The reprint series was not particularly successful.\n\nThe Spider was once described to me as if Robert E. Howard wrote the Shadow. I think that overly compliments Norvell Page’s prose but the Spider really is one grim character. The Spider was also a brainchild of Popular Publication’s Harry Steeger. The first two Spider novels were written by the son of a popular Canadian writer, R. T. M. Scott II. He introduced the readers to Richard Wentworth (the Spider), his paramour Nita van Sloan, and Ram Singh. Norvell Page, under the house name Grant Stockbridge, took over and the Spider darkly blossomed. Page wrote 91 Spider novels. Another writer, Wayne Rogers, wrote some later adventures. Hollywood made two Spider serials and some radio shows were done. The Spider novels have been reprinted in several paperback incarnations.\n\nOperator #5, Jimmy Christopher was a pulp superhuman James Bond without the various women of course. The stand out of the series was a 13 novel series called “The Purple Invasion.” Rudolph I of Bulkaria invades the U.S. with devastating consequences. The real authors of these Curtis Steele novels were Frederick C. Davis and later Emile Tepperman. Tepperman wrote the “Purple Invasion” stories. Operator #5 was also a Popular Publications pulp. Wayne Rogers was the last writer for the series.\n\nThe Phantom Detective was the Sherlock Holmes of the pulps. The Phantom was Richard Curtis Van Loan, a wealthy playboy, who just thought crime was bad. The Phantom Detective was published by Ned Pines. His publishing company was variously called Standard Magazines, Beacon Magazines, and Better Publications; but better known as “the Thrilling group” because of editor Leo Margulies’ love of titles like Thrilling Mystery, Thrilling Adventure, and so on. There were 170 Phantom Detective adventures. The first 11 credited to G. Wayman Jones and then Robert Wallace. The adventures were actually written by a wide variety of pulp authors including Henry Kuttner and Ray Cummings.\n\nThe Black Bat was another Ned Pines’ publication. Norman Daniels wrote most of these tales. Batman and The Black Bat appeared almost simultaneously. There was talk of lawsuits but nothing happened. Tony Quinn, the Black Bat, was a blind ex-district attorney who gained the ability to see in the dark and had acute senses. (More like Stan Lee’s later Daredevil character than Bob Kane’s concurrent Batman.)\n\nStar Wars fan might like to read the adventures of Captain Future. Edmund Hamilton wrote these popular science-fiction yarns. Captain Future was Curtis Newton. The son of a scientist raised by The Brain (a scientist, Simon Wright, whose brain was in a special serum case), Otho the super android, and Grag the robot. In his final adventure, Captain Future rejects a chance for godhood. A lot of science-fiction fans felt the pulp adventures of Captain Future hurt the genre. They might have taken refuge in Ed’s marriage to Leigh Brackett, who is considered a SF great.\n\nStreet & Smith put together another Kenneth Robeson character in 1939. The Avenger was actually written by Paul Ernst. The Avenger was a little better written than the average pulp but the Avenger was still essentially a Doc Savage/Shadow knock-off. Richard Henry Benson, a millionaire adventurer, forms Justice, Inc. after his wife and child are killed in a criminal act. Benson, in shock, turns literally white-faced and emotionless. His face becomes a static mold that enables him to be a master of disguise. The Avenger had his band of operatives also. The operatives included an educated black couple. This was unique for the pulps, which usually portrayed blacks in a negative or humorous light, if at all. The Avenger lasted only 24 issues.\n\nCovering each and every hero of the pulps would be a long and undoubtedly enjoyable pastime but one too time consuming to accomplish in a short article. There were plenty more “hero pulps” but the ones discussed above are arguably the most popular. The even more popular heroes like Zorro and Tarzan are usually not referred to as “hero pulps” because they did not have monthly magazines named after them. Zorro, the Californian Robin Hood, was the creation of Johnston McCulley and first appeared in the August 9, 1919 issue of All-Story Weekly in the novel, The Curse of Capistrano (later published in hardcover as The Mark of Zorro after the re-titled Douglas Fairbanks 1920 movie.) Zorro was the justice seeking secret identity of Don Diego Vega, the son of a wealthy landowner. Zorro was an immediate success and had a varied enough career to fill a book. Most today, remember Zorro from the Disney TV show starring Guy Williams. Zorro had a brief comeback in 1998 with the Antonio Banderas film, The Mask of Zorro. The movie intriguingly incorporated real elements of California history but in the process created a new Zorro (a reformed bandit, trained by the original Zorro). The movie was only a modest hit so Zorro will probably rest for several more years. Tarzan also had a varied career. Burroughs’ novel, Tarzan of the Apes was first published in the October 1912 issue of All-Story. Tarzan was an immediate hit and the character appeared in a decades long string of films. The MGM movies with Johnny Weismuller left an indelible image on the public. Tarzan is currently popular as an animated character in Disney films.\n\nFew pulp fictioneers became very successful in their lifetime: Johnston McCulley, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Frederick Faust (Max Brand) and Dashiell Hammett are a few exceptions. But even the lesser-known writers made more than a decent living during the depression, although their literary accomplishments went without reward or recognition.\n\nConan and Robert E. Howard\n\nI covered weird pulps and hero pulps. Howard’s Conan is definitely an amalgamation of two. One of the first books I’ve seen that recognized this is Pulp Heroes of the Thirties edited by James Van Hise. This collection of articles about the pulp heroes of the thirties includes an article by Jim Van Hise called “Conan in Weird Tales: A 1930’s Treasure.”\n\nConan first appeared in the December 1932 issue of Weird Tales in the story, The Phoenix on the Sword. Conan was popular with most of the readers. Critics like Robert Bloch called him Conan the Cluck and damned the sameness of the stories though. Howard fans like Kirk Mashburn soundly criticized Bloch. Another fellow named Fred Anger never missed a chance to criticize Bloch thereafter. Bloch recounts this whole episode in his introduction to the Robert E. Howard collection, Wolfshead, published by Bantam Books.\n\nAs I said earlier, Van Hise’s article was the first time I saw Conan directly connected with the hero pulps. It isn’t a good fit in some ways but it is a real fit in other ways. Conan is not a hero in the Doc Savage mold. He is (arguably) an anti-hero whose charisma captivated his fans. The Doc Savage series, at 182 short novels with later additions by Phillip Jose Farmer and Will Murray, probably still has the edge in total word count but Conan is catching up. New Conan novels have been announced, and the TOR pastiches numbered around 50. The bulk of the Doc Savage novels were primarily written by original author Lester Dent, but the paperbacks still used the Kenneth Robeson pseudonym. Howard only wrote 25 Conan stories (including the fragments) and one Conan novel. Other authors have now written the bulk of Conan wordage but Howard’s name was always associated with the stories that he wrote (and some posthumous collaborations). The main thing Doc Savage and Conan have in common is that they resurfaced in the 1960’s in a popular paperback series with great cover art. It revitalized both their careers.\n\nPart of the appeal of pulps to fans is the cover art. Action oriented, sexual, and graphically violent these covers undoubtedly play a part in having most respected critics refusing to embrace even the best pulp authors as writing true literature. It isn’t hard to see a connection from pulps to comic books. Some of the pulp publishers were also comic book publishers. Conan was only one in a line of pulp characters to be adapted to comic books. Tarzan, Zorro, the Shadow, and even Doc Savage appeared decades earlier. But once Conan was adapted to comics and later film his popular culture ranking soared while attempts to look at the stories in a literary light only slightly increased. Literary recognition for Howard seems to be following the Edgar Rice Burroughs type route. No real “literary” recognition but recognition that the author created an iconic figure and some ripping good yarns in the process. Right now, Edgar Rice Burroughs is represented in Penguin’s 20th Century Classics, a Signet Classic, and numerous Barnes & Noble hardcover collections. Howard is currently available mostly in knock-off public domain collections, and specialty hardcovers from the REH Foundation Press. The Del Rey and Gollancz collections are still available through outlets like Amazon, but rarely seen in brick and mortar stores.\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\n“Vultures of Wahpeton” is one of the few stories by Robert E. Howard where we definitely know of his real life model. Howard wrote to August Derleth about the story and stated “my main character was drawn from Hendry Brown.”\n\nOriginally published as “Vultures of Whapeton” in December 1936, this erroneous spelling of the title was repeated with the 1973 hardcover and the 1975 paperback. This is ironically amusing as the outlaw sheriff “Hendry Brown” was actually named “Henry Brown.” The added “d” was the result of an erroneous New Mexico court record.\n\nMost of the discussion around this story has centered on its similarity in theme to Howard’s “The Shadow Kingdom.” Both stories feature a hidden evil becoming known to the protagonist and his struggle to overcome that evil. For Kull it is sorcerous lizard men, for Steve Corcoran it is a criminal gang ran by the town’s sheriff. Fred Blosser’s “When Kull Rode the Range” published in The Dark Man # 5 is the most thorough examination of this idea. But where Kull was fighting the evil from the outside, Corcoran joined forces with the evil.\n\nThis story was one of Howard’s few attempts at realistic western fiction instead of humorous western fiction. That he chose to have his hero be tempted by greed and join forces with “the Vultures” instead of nobly fighting them is interesting. It is also interesting just how much of the real life story of Henry Brown contributed to this work of fiction.\n\nHoward wrote: “The phenomenon of an outlaw looting a section under the guise of an officer of the law was not unknown in the early West…. These sort of conditions led to a peculiar state of affairs in Caldwell, Kansas, back in the early ‘80’s. The city marshal stood in with the toughs, but, to placate the honest elements, always appointed some man for his deputy who was not on the inside, and who sincerely tried to establish law and order. These deputies were quickly killed, if not with the aid, at least with the permission of the marshal. Then one day he hired a stranger from New Mexico, and presented him as a burnt offering to the wild gang. But that stranger happened to be Hendry Brown, a former partner of Billy the Kid, one of the warriors of the Bloody Lincoln County War, and one of the deadliest gunmen that ever wore leather.”\n\nHoward’s source book for Henry Brown was of dubious historical accuracy. Arguably he somewhat suspected as much when he wrote to Tevis Clyde Smith: “When I was in Fort Worth I got a book, Lead and Likker, by O. P. White. Good stuff, told with a zip, and apparently authentic – in spots…[my emphasis].”\n\nLater Howard wrote: “Hendry Brown, Billy the Kid’s pal, was a law in Kansas, too – when they hanged him for robbing a bank in a neighboring town, he was still wearing his Marshall’s star. He’s worth a book himself – a lean, lithe, blond devil, handsome as a classical young pagan, soulless and deadly as a rattler. Utterly without fear, he shot his way out of traps and confronted perils with heroism worthy to be sung by Homer – and again he killed causelessly and in cold blood, simply to see his victims fall and quiver.”\n\nThe real Henry Brown was from Missouri. Quick and deadly with a gun and knowledgeable in farming and ranching he headed out west, where he became involved in the Lincoln County War. Originally a Murphy employee, Brown switched sides after a dispute over his pay, and worked for Tunstall where he met Billy the Kid. After Tunstall’s murder both became a part of Dick Brewer’s regulators. The regulators were at first a legal posse tracking down Tunstall’s murderers. They captured two of them, Billy Morton and Frank Baker. A regulator, William McCloskey, was seen as preparing to help the two men escape. Henry Brown is believed to have started a melee when he shot McCloskey. Billy the Kid and others fired in turn. Morton, Baker, and McCloskey all perished.\n\nHenry Brown was present at most of the famous episodes of the Lincoln County War. The killing of Sheriff Brady, the epic shootout at Blazer’s Mill, and the final fiery conclusion at McSween’s home (although Brown was not in the house, he was providing cover-fire protection from an adjoining warehouse). Brown never achieved the fame of The Kid though. Most likely this is due to his ignoble end.\n\nIn 1878, Brown and The Kid parted ways. Brown worked at various ranches until 1879 when he returned to Texas. New indictments had been issued for several of the Lincoln County War veterans. Brown was on the list. Brown kept pretty quiet in Tacosa. It is believed he did cowboy work for a while and later did deputy work. Then he moved to Caldwell.\n\nCaldwell, Kansas was a wild town. Howard and O. P. White were correct in saying law officer after law officer was being killed there. George Flatt died while ambushed on Main Street, Frank Hunt in the Red Light Saloon, Mike Meagher in a street fight, George Brown also in the Red Light. The town business faction wanted law and order. Bat Carr and Henry Brown became the Marshall and Assistant City Marshall respectively. The town newspaper didn’t mention Brown’s connection with Billy the Kid but they did say, “he is one of the quickest men on the trigger in the Southwest.” Carr and Brown cleaned up the town. Brown played second banana to Carr’s charisma just as he had earlier with Billy the Kid.\n\nHoward’s story opens with the killing of a deputy in the town of Wahpeton. Sheriff John Middleton addresses the crowd, “Maybe this killing is an ultimatum on me. All right, I’ve got an answer ready, I’ve got a new deputy, and you won’t find him so easy as Grimes. I’m fighting fire with fire from here on. I’m riding out of the Gulch early in the morning, and when I come back, I’ll have a man with me. A gunfighter from Texas!”\n\nThe man Middleton was bringing in was Billy Glanton, who bears a physical resemblance to Henry Brown. “The horseman was a supple youth of medium height, and his hat did not conceal the fact that his hair was yellow and curly. His wide eyes were ingenuous, and an infectious smile curved his lips.” Howard kills off this Henry Brown lookalike in a shootout with the black haired and blue-eyed Steve Corcoran. Middleton observed the killing and offers Corcoran the job of deputy. Howard is replacing the real Henry Brown with his preferred version of events.\n\nCorcoran goes on to Wahpeton with Middleton. Middleton tells Corcoran about the outlaw gang, the Vultures, which are terrorizing the town. Corcoran meets the oxymoronically named Glory Bland. Later he gets his initiation by fire. Corcoran eventually learns the truth about Middleton and is recruited to join his criminal conspiracy.\n\nHoward’s narration of events in the story parallels what he knew and wrote about Brown in his letters: “The way they generally trapped the deputy was to start a commotion in a saloon. Ordinarily the deputy ran in and saw one drunk – apparently – standing in the center of the saloon and shooting at the ceiling, while a large gang looked on from the bar. When the deputy started to arrest the drunk, the lights suddenly went out, and when they were lit again, there was a deputy with several lead slugs through him. But Brown was wise. When the commotion started he didn’t rush in blindly, turn his back on the gang at the bar and collar the drunk. Your real gunman was always a man of keen perceptions and a high order of intelligence.”\n\nHere is how Howard had Corcoran explain it in the story: “Purty crude,” he criticized. “I don’t see how anybody could fall for a trick that stale. Man plays drunk and starts shootin’ at the roof. Officer comes in to arrest him. When the officer’s back’s turned, somebody shoots out the light, and the drunk falls to the floor to get out of the line of fire. Three or four men planted along the bar start blastin’ away in the dark at the place where the law’s standin’, and out of eighteen or twenty-four shots, some’s bound to connect.”\n\nHoward uses quite a bit of the real life Henry Brown in this story. Steve Corcoran, like Henry Brown, wears a two-gun rig. The real life John Middleton was a fellow regulator of Brown and Billy the Kid, and Caldwell’s local leader was a man named Colonel Jennison. In Howard’s fictional version of events the local leader is named Colonel Hopkins. Clearly Howard was influenced by what he had read of Brown’s life and was attempting realistic western fiction in this tale.\n\nHenry Brown’s boss, Marshall Bat Carr, was not a lawman involved in an outlaw conspiracy though. History records Carr as an honest lawman that eventually left his post, leaving Brown the job. Rumor has it that Brown just up and plucked the star from Carr’s chest one-day. While that story probably isn’t true, it is true that Brown was getting ambitious and probably had something to do with Carr’s eventual leaving of Caldwell. Ben Wheeler was now the assistant city Marshall. Henry took a wife and was on the way to respectability in the history books.\n\nCarr and Brown had cleaned up Caldwell pretty well together. Brown’s tenure as Marshall was not uneventful though. One of Brown’s more famous acts of law enforcement was the shooting of an Indian named Spotted Horse. Spotted Horse was traveling with his wife and demanded food at several places, finally pulling out a gun to get his way. Brown confronted the man and Spotted Horse reached for his weapon. Brown was apparently rattled; it took him four shots to find his mark.\n\nBrown and Wheeler kept tight order generating enough fines from rough cowhands to pay both their salaries. A gambler, Newt Boyce, came from Texas to settle in Caldwell. The gambler somehow knew of Brown’s past. The famous cowboy-detective Charlie Siringo also knowing of Brown’s past had settled in Caldwell. Brown and Siringo were friends. Brown and Boyce weren’t. Brown shot Boyce dead in a gunfight. There were rumors that Boyce “knew too much.”\n\nIn the story, Howard has Corcoran recruited by Middleton to help him deal with Ace Brent, a gambler who is trying to usurp Middleton as leader of the gang. Brent is eventually killed in the story; but not by Corcoran. Howard is diverging from real life events more and more as he tells his story.\n\nBrown never felt the weight of the men he killed but he did feel the weight of his marriage. He bought a new home and now had the burden of a mortgage he could barely afford. The neighboring town of Medicine Lodge had a bank. Brown, like criminals before and after him, realized that a bank was where the money was. Brown, Wheeler, and two cowboys, William Smith and John Wesley had a plan.\n\nBrown asked for a leave of absence supposedly to chase down and collect the reward on some wanted criminals. Brown had done this before so it wasn’t particularly unusual. The four men met up and rode to Medicine Lodge. Smith remained with the horses, while Brown and Wheeler went into the bank. Wesley guarded a side door. The bankers, George Geppert and Wylie Payne were surprised. Payne reached for a pistol but was no match for Brown’s quick draw. Payne dropped from the hit. Geppert then reacted and Wheeler shot him dead.\n\nThe shots were heard by the armed townsfolk and general hell broke loose. The would-be bank robbers dashed for the horses with a posse in full pursuit. If it had not rained heavily the previous night and had they fresher horses they might have gotten away. But they didn’t.\n\nBrown and his men came up with a story that the robbery was an inside job. Howard mentions this in one of his letters: “A friend of [Brown’s] was cashier in a bank at Medicine Lodge. He revealed to Brown that he had taken the bank’s money, and was bound to be discovered. He begged Brown to stage a robbery, in order to cover the shortage. Brown rode over with three deputies in broad open daylight, still wearing his marshal’s badge. Hardly had they entered the bank, when the president, who they thought many miles from the town, entered the building. The cashier had assured them that he was gone; and so he was, but had returned for some reason or other, before setting out on his journey. Men like Brown are alert and suspicious as a wolf. Instantly concluding that it was a trap of some kind, and that the cashier had betrayed them, Brown killed the cashier, and then shot down the president.” No one in the town believed this story at the time and no proof of embezzlement was ever found. It is generally believed that it was just an attempt to forestall an angry mob.\n\nWhile waiting in jail, Brown had time to write to his wife: “… Do not go back on me; if you do it will kill me. Be true to me as long as you live, and come to see me if you think enough of me. … I thought we could take in the money and not have any trouble with it; but a man’s fondest hopes are sometimes broken with trouble. If a mob does not kill us we will come out all right after while.”\n\nHere is Howard continuing on the last moments of Henry Brown: “A mob, led by an ex-Texas Ranger, was instantly on their heels, and they were to run to earth not far from the town. Officers were there, too, but unable to control the mob. What happened is not entirely clear as to details; but three men were hanged and one was shot as he made a break for the horse. That man was Hendry Brown. There is reason to believe that he parleyed with the officers, and they, realizing that the robbery had been made with the intention of aiding a friend, rather than any desire of theft, gave him the opportunity to make the break so that he could perish by lead instead of rope. He knew he couldn’t get away; all he asked was to be shot rather than hanged.” Real life events were grimmer than Howard realized.\n\nThe mob came at night and the law of Medicine Lodge did not feel obligated to protect the prisoners. The cell doors were opened and Brown somehow got through the crowd and ran toward the street before being nearly blasted in half from a double-barreled shotgun. Wheeler was shot at such close range his vest caught fire. Wheeler, Wesley, and Smith were strung up and hung. Wheeler is supposed to have begged for his life. Screaming “My God! My God!” before the noose silenced him forever. It has been said that the crowd was so angry that Brown escaped the hanging that they strung up his torn dead corpse to join the others.\n\n“Vultures of Wahpeton” had borrowed elements of Henry Brown’s tragic story but Howard turns it into a redemptive tale once Corcoran’s sense of honor rubs against Middleton’s plans. Corcoran comes into conflict with fellow Vultures and the honest citizens formed their own vigilante justice. Middleton and Corcoran plan to get while the getting is good but events conspire against them. Middleton kills Glory and Corcoran kills Middleton. Corcoran is nauseated by the events but decides to rush off into the night. Howard writes: “But he must stir. There would be prisoners, eager to talk. Their speech would weave a noose about his neck.” Like Brown, Corcoran fears the noose.\n\nHoward wrote two endings to this story. And the editor of Smashing Novels published both! In the “happy” ending, Glory Bland survives. The “realistic” ending is the one usually reprinted with the main text of the story. It is arguably the more dramatic ending, as the editor said.\n\nCorcoran had been part of a criminal conspiracy and has seen and participated in the deaths of many men. Howard, in another act of myth-making, has this “soulless and deadly” gunfighter suffering a great loss, and thereby purging himself of evil through this violent trial of fire. As Howard put it: “The lights of the camp, the roar of the distant voices fell away behind him and before him lay what wild destiny he could not guess. But the night was full of haunting shadows, and within him grew a strange pain, like a revelation, perhaps it was his soul, at last awakening.”\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nBilly the Kid’s influence on popular culture has been written of several times. Stephen Tatum’s Inventing Billy the Kid is a good example of a book that correlates popular culture treatments of the Kid to the zeitgeist of the era in which they were made. Movies, comic books, literature, poetry, and even music have been influenced by the legend of Billy the Kid and the Lincoln County War. New works about and influenced by the Kid have appeared periodically since his death and continue to this day. Most of them studied by Billy the Kid scholars.\n\nOne story that has been overlooked as being influenced by Billy the Kid is Robert E. Howard’s “Red Nails.” This short novella was originally serialized in the pulp magazine, Weird Tales, in the July, August-September, and October 1936 issues. The story features Howard’s most famous creation, Conan the Barbarian. The likelihood of Billy the Kid and the Lincoln County War being an influence on this weird tale of a prehistoric warrior confronting a dragon, large snakes, a vampiric lesbian, and super-science does seem farfetched at first mention.\n\nRobert E. Howard (1906 –1936) was a pulp fictioneer in the Edgar Rice Burroughs mode. Although a popular writer in the magazines that published him, his creations never achieved the fame of Burroughs’ Tarzan or John Carter during his lifetime. Decades later Conan the Barbarian was resurrected by science-fiction author, L. Sprague de Camp, for a series of paperbacks. This series, with additional stories by de Camp and others, was wildly successful. Conan followed this success with comic books and eventually the films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jason Momoa.\n\nHoward wrote his stories in the small west Texas town of Cross Plains. Howard was, by most accounts, somewhat of an outsider in this town composed of farmers, oil workers, and laborers. His literary bent attracted similar minded friends during his high school and college years but as they aged and married and moved away Howard sought out correspondence with fellow pulp writers as an outlet for his ideas and thoughts. Howard never married, long obsessed with suicide, he took his own life in 1936 upon learning his long-suffering tubercular mother would never recover from a coma.\n\nHoward wrote in his letters of many a historical Wild West event: the fate of John Wesley Hardin, shootouts in Lampasas, Waco, and elsewhere. One of Howard’s more famous correspondents was his fellow pulp author, H. P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft is well known today in horror fiction circles as the creator of a mythos of stories featuring alien entities with names like Yog-Sogoth and Cthulhu. Lovecraft’s fictional tome, The Necronomicon, is a staple of these stories and the stories written by his admirers and imitators.\n\nHoward first wrote to Lovecraft regarding Billy the Kid in a pair of letters written in January and February 1931. Howard said: “That he was a cold blooded murderer there is no doubt, but he was loyal to his friends, honest in his way, truthful, possessed of a refinement in thought and conversation rare even in these days, and no man ever lived who was braver than he. He belonged in an older, wilder age of blood-feuds and rapine and war.”\n\nReaders familiar with Howard’s stories would recognize this description as being that of a typical Howard hero. There were plenty of western oriented pulp magazines that Howard could have submitted stories too, featuring Billy the Kid as his hero. That Howard, who clearly admired the Kid, never wrote a story that actually featured Billy seems strange. Several reasons suggest themselves.\n\nWalter Burns’s book, The Saga of Billy the Kid was written in 1926 and was a best seller. Howard read the book and quotes from it in one of his letters to Lovecraft. Burns’s book included interviews he had with people who had known Billy and appeared to be definitive at the time. Hollywood successfully bought Billy to the silver screen in 1930. Billy the Kid starred Johnny Mack Brown and was directed by King Vidor. It was a very popular romanticized account of the Kid’s life. In the wake of the popularity of these successful efforts, Howard probably felt he had little to add to the Kid’s story.\n\nAlso Howard’s first letters to Lovecraft regarding Billy were written at a time when Howard was not really comfortable writing western tales. Howard had only written four westerns prior to 1933, the year he retained a professional literary agent. (His agent was also a pulp writer in the Burrough’s mode, Otis Adelbert Kline.) After that, of course, Howard began writing more and more western tales. His most successful western series featured a giant of a man named Breckinridge Elkins. These stories were somewhat in the Bret Harte mode but were chiefly rollicking action stories with lots of broad humor. Glenn Lord, a noted Howard expert, mad the observation that, “[Vultures of Whapeton]” seems to have been the only story based on the career of an actual gunfighter.” And that story, written in 1934, was only influenced by the life of Hendry Brown, a former partner of Billy the Kid, the hero of the story was called Steve Corcoran. When that story didn’t sell right away (it was eventually published in Smashing Novels Magazine, December 1936) Howard had probably soured on basing his tales too closely on existing outlaws.\n\nClearly Howard preferred creating his own heroes, perhaps with a thought toward proprietary reasons (anyone can write a Billy the Kid story, but only he can write a Conan story), but most likely due to a personal preference for having his characters reflect his personal thoughts and philosophies. H. P. Lovecraft made the observation that Howard’s stories are successful because Howard is in everyone of them. If the psychological theories of L. Sprague de Camp are correct, then Howard’s writing was an escape from reality: an attempt to overcome a Hellish existence and a search for self-hood. Billy’s tragic life couldn’t satisfy Howard’s psychological needs for self-hood. Although Howard praised Billy saying, “no man was braver than he” Howard was, in the final analysis, critical of Billy and the Lincoln County War. When Howard finally decided to incorporate Billy and the Lincoln County War into his fiction, he chose to write it as a Conan story and to concentrate on the Lincoln County War.\n\nIn his January 1931 letter to H. P. Lovecraft, years before his actual visit to Lincoln, Robert E. Howard is content to just wax historically: “Have you read of [the Lincoln County War]? There’s drama! There’s epic and saga and the red tides of slaughter! Heroism, reckless courage, brute ferocity, blind idealism and bestial greed. And the peak of red drama was touched that bloody night in the shuddering little mountain town of Lincoln, when Murphy’s henchmen crouched like tigers in the night behind the flaming walls of McSween’s ‘dobe dwelling.” Howard goes on to recount the burning of McSween’s place in golden prose. He sums up: “Truly the bloody Lincoln County War is the saga of the Southwest; glory and shame and murder and courage and cruelty and hate flaming into raw, red primitive drama, while through all stalked the gigantic shadow-shape of Billy the Kid, dominating all – as if that crimson feud were but the stage set for his brief stellar role – his star that flamed suddenly up and was suddenly extinguished.”\n\nOne could argue that Billy was on Howard’s mind while writing his Conan stories. Conan’s first introduction to civilization (the story, “The Tower of the Elephant”) finds him acting the outlaw and killing a man after being manhandled. It is currently believed that Billy killed his first man on August 17, 1877. It began as quarrel between him and Frank P. Cahill. The much larger Cahill began beating the Kid and slapping him around. The Kid grabbed Cahill’s gun and shot Cahill through the stomach. Cahill died the next day. Howard, going by Burns’s or Garrett’s account, talks about Billy’s first kill in his in his letter to Lovecraft. “Pancho Villa killed his first man when he was fourteen; Billy went him one better; he was only twelve when he stabbed a big blacksmith to death in Silver City, New Mexico. That started him on the wild life.” Whatever the circumstances of Billy’s first kill, Howard was correct about the Kid’s destiny. The Kid was on a wild road.\n\nAnother Conan story, “Queen of the Black Coast” has Conan refusing to testify in court against a friend. This is reminiscent of young Billy’s outlaw code. Billy’s first brush with the law came on September 26, 1875. He was arrested for assisting a man known as Sombrero Jack for stealing laundry. Billy could have avoided arrest if he had named Sombrero Jack as the mastermind of this crime. But he refused. Billy instead escaped his cell by climbing through a chimney.\n\nHoward’s February 1931 letter to Lovecraft has him telling his New Englander friend the facts of the Lincoln County War, which will be quickly recounted here. “The Lincoln County War began in a cattle row. […] McSween, Chisum, and an Englishman named Tunstall went into partnership and McSween opened a big general store in Lincoln. He grabbed most of the trade and Murphy saw he was being ruined. McSween won a suit against him and for reasons too complicated and lengthy to narrate here, Murphy got a writ of attachment against McSween’s store and Tunstall’s ranch – the last an obviously illegal movement, since Tunstall owned his ranch apart from the partnership and had nothing to do with the law suit.”\n\nDolan, a partner of Murphy’s, who was now running things, chose a legal fight rather than guns to win his way. McSween had been the administrator of the estate of one Emil Fritz, a partner of Murphy’s. Fritz’s estate was essentially an insurance policy worth $10,000. McSween collected the funds but refused to pays the debts owed to Dolan unless Dolan provided proof the money was owed. Dolan refused to produce his records and the case remained unsettled. Attorney General Thomas Catron convinced Judge Bristol to issue attachments on all of McSween’s property, including his interest in Tunstall’s ranch. The attachment was clearly unlawful, but such was Dolan’s control over things.\n\nHoward goes on: “A posse of some twenty men rode over to attach Tunstall’s ranch. They overtook him in the mountains, shot him down in cold blood, beat out his brains with a jagged rock and left him lying beside his dead horse. That was the beginning of the Bloody Lincoln County War. [T]he murder of his friend drove [Billy] on the red trail of vengeance. McSween organized a posse to arrest the murderers, and had Dick Brewer, foreman of the murdered Englishman, sworn in as a special constable. They rode out after the killers and caught two of them in the Pecos Valley – Morton and Baker – former friends of the Kid.”\n\nBrewer was out for justice; Billy was out for revenge. The gang rode out to catch Bill Morton and Frank Baker. They did so and heard news that Tom Hill, the man who shot Tunstall, had been killed in an unrelated incident. Morton and Baker tried to escape and the Kid shot them both. With three of Tunstall’s killers dead, Brewer went after Jesse Evans and Buckshot Roberts.\n\nSheriff Brady and Deputy Hindman were shot dead in Lincoln. Indictments were brought against John Middleton, Hendry Brown, and the Kid. The killing of a sheriff was big news. Rewards of $200 were out for the indicted killers. Buckshot Roberts was a more than capable bounty hunter and searched for Brewer and his gang.\n\nHoward had this to say about Buckshot Roberts. “[…] a Texas man whom it had once taken twenty-five Rangers to arrest. He was so full of lead that he couldn’t lift his rifle shoulder high, but shot from the hip. Thirteen McSween men cornered him at Blazer’s Mill on the Tularosa River, led by Dick Brewer and the Kid. Bowdre, the Kid’s closest friend, shot Roberts through and through, but before the old Texan fell he wounded Bowdre, John Middleton and George Coe, and as he lay dying he shot off the top of Dick Brewer’s skull.”\n\nBrewer’s death changed things in Dolan’s favor. Brewer, had some legal authority for his manhunts, after his death Dolan’s side held most of the legal cards. Charlie Bowdre was indicted for Roberts’ killing and pressure was on to capture the Kid. The Kid replaced Dick Brewer as the leader of the “Regulators.”\n\nDolan turned his attention to McSween and Chisum. Numerous gun battles between Dolan’s men, Chisum’s men, and the Kid’s gang were the norm. Things were reaching a boil and McSween was feeling the heat. He had persuaded Governor Axtell to appoint an ally of his, John Copeland, the new sheriff of Lincoln County. But Copeland was a weak sheriff. He did nothing to stop Dolan’s violence. Copeland was removed and a Dolan man, George Peppin was appointed.\n\nHoward writes: “Peppin immediately organized a posse and rode out after McSween’s men, killing Frank McNab. Then followed the famous battle of the McSween House.”\n\nPeppin organized a killing force of about 50 men to go after McSween. McSween was preparing a last stand and had about 40 men. He fortified the men in his home and in the homes of his nearby allies. There was a standoff until a shot rang out from the McSween house. That was all that was needed for Peppin to bring in U. S. military troops. Peppin had a friend in Colonel Edward Dudley. McSween’s time was up. The presence of the troops disheartened the McSween men and those that were not quartered in McSween’s house effectively left the standoff. Mrs. McSween was allowed to leave the home before McSween’s house was set afire. Billy and some of his men had joined McSween the night before. Guns blazing, the men shot their way out. McSween was killed instantly. Billy escaped.\n\nHoward states: “That was the end of the Lincoln County War, proper. Murphy had died, a broken man, and crownless monarch, and the rest were ready to throw down their guns and call it a draw. All except the Kid and his immediate followers. But from that point, Billy’s career was not that of an avenger, fighting a blood-feud. He reverted to his earlier days and became simply a gunman and an outlaw, subsisting by cattle-rustling.”\n\nHoward clearly had a bent toward heroes slightly outside the law. Men of honor with their own personal code, usually men untainted by the hypocrisies of civilization, and although capable of dealing death, they had personal mores they would not violate. Howard clearly admired and was fascinated by the story of Billy the Kid, but it wasn’t until he traveled to Lincoln, New Mexico that he was inspired to write his version of the Lincoln County War.\n\nA little over four years passed between Howard’s first writing on Billy the Kid to his visit to Lincoln, New Mexico. Once Howard had visited the Kid’s stomping grounds he felt more competent and more compelled in bringing the Lincoln County War into his fiction. The Lincoln County War became part of Conan’s world. A comparison between the letter Howard wrote to Lovecraft in July 1935 with the story “Red Nails” directly shows the influence of the Lincoln County War on this story.\n\nHoward visited Lincoln County and described his arrival there to Lovecraft: “The Hondo Valley is like a serpent’s track – long and winding, walled with gigantic bare mountains, with the Hondo River rippling along its bed, and supplying water for the farmers whose adobe huts line its banks. Cottonwoods, apple-orchards, alfalfa fields and the like crowd densely, greedily clutching at every bit of soil the life-giving water can reach. The verdant green offers a strange contrast to the grim and savage bareness of the hills that rise on either hand. Semi-tropical luxuriance gives way abruptly to gaunt nakedness. […] And so in the still laziness of a Mexican mid-morning we came to the ancient village of Lincoln […].”\n\nHoward is not exaggerating here. He approached Lincoln from the east and even today the road to Lincoln is a winding affair. Lincoln comes upon you unexpectedly, you navigate a rounded curve, and it is suddenly there. Approaching Lincoln from the west is just as startling. The town of Carrizozo, only a little west of Lincoln, is bordered on the west by the “Valley of Fires.” Over 463 acres of dried lava flow. Large masses of jagged, cracked, and pockmarked remnants of fired rock.\n\nIn the story “Red Nails” the heroine, Valeria, mirrors Howard’s thoughts on approaching her ancient city. “She saw only the rolling green ocean stretching away and away, with only a vague blue line in the distance to hint of the hill-range she had crossed days before, to plunge into this leafy waste. West and east the view was the same, though the blue hill-line was lacking in those directions. But when she turned her eyes southward she stiffened and caught her breath. A mile away in that direction the forest thinned out and ceased abruptly, giving way to a cactus-dotted plain. And in the midst of that plain rose the walls and towers of a city.”\n\nHoward wrote that Lincoln was haunted and that he felt its ghosts. If Howard’s letters are to be believed, Howard often dreamt dark dreams, had night terrors, and was a sleepwalker. De Camp wrote that these things indicate a troubled child and that Howard’s storytelling was an attempt to triumph over these fears. Whether nonsense or not Howard was compelled to write about his feelings. Howard told Lovecraft that he had visited several places where death was dealt: the Alamo, the dueling oaks of New Orleans, the hanging tree of Goliad; and Howard says Lincoln affected him the most:\n\nHoward wrote, “I have never felt anywhere the exact sensations Lincoln aroused in me – a sort of horror predominating. If there is a haunted spot on this hemisphere, then Lincoln is haunted. I felt that if I slept the night there, the ghosts of the slain would stalk through my dreams. […] There was a feel of skeletons in the earth underfoot.”\n\nFrom “Red Nails”: Conan says upon seeing the city, “Black last night against the moon,” […], his eyes clouding with the abysmal superstition of the barbarian. “Blood-red as a threat of blood against the sun this dawn. I do not like this city.” And earlier in the story, Valeria has this experience: “Her foot had struck something in the litter of blown dead leaves which carpeted the shelf. She kicked them aside and looked down at the skeleton of a man.”\n\nIt is tempting to look at what Howard wrote about Lincoln and compare it to what he wrote about his childhood in the area known as Dark Valley (an area near Peaster, Texas). Howard wrote of Dark Valley in an October 1930 letter to Lovecraft: “Surely, the silence, the brooding loneliness, the shadowy mysticism of that lonesome valley entered in some part into my vague-forming nature.” Howard reiterates this feeling that geography plays a part into people’s development again in the July 1935 letter to Lovecraft:\n\n“Lincoln is a haunted place; it is a dead town; yet it lives with a life that died fifty years ago. […] “I think geography is the reason for the unusually savage and bloodthirsty manner in which the feud was fought out, a savagery that has impressed everyone who has ever made an intelligent study of the feud and the psychology behind it. The valley in which Lincoln lies is isolated from the rest of the world. Vast expanses of desert and mountain separate it from the rest of humanity – deserts too barren to support human life. The people in Lincoln lost touch with the world. Isolated as they were, their own affairs, their relationship with one another, took on an importance and significance out of proportion to their actual meaning. Thrown together too much, jealousies and resentments rankled and grew, feeding upon themselves, until they reached monstrous proportions and culminated in those bloody atrocities which startled even the tough West of that day. […] I have heard of people going mad in isolated places; I believe the Lincoln County War was tinged with madness.”\n\nThe Howard family was not isolated in Cross Plains or Dark Valley. But this is not to say Robert Howard didn’t feel isolated in either place. Clearly he did feel Dark Valley influenced the gloominess he often felt while living in Cross Plains. L. Sprague de Camp was the first to connect Howard’s feelings about Dark Valley with the creation of Conan. Whether he was correct or not is inconclusive as yet. But adding what Howard wrote about Lincoln to the mix does bring up some interesting speculation. It is not a stretch to use Howard’s own words to understand him. During the last months of his mother’s illness Howard lost touch with the world and the family’s relationship with one another, took on an importance and significance out of proportion to their actual meaning. Howard’s last days show him not thinking clearly. His father mentioned being afraid of and for Howard. It can easily be said that thrown together too much, jealousies and resentments rankled and grew, feeding upon themselves, until they reached monstrous proportions and culminated in a bloody suicide that startled the tough town of Cross Plains.\n\nHoward was working out his feelings on Billy the Kid, the Lincoln County War, and his personal philosophies in “Red Nails” and that is why Conan is not wholly a Billy the Kid surrogate in this story. Billy was an active participant in the madness of the Lincoln County War. Conan participates in the feud but he is not of the feud. Conan is not Billy. The Lincoln County War is similar to the blood feud of Xuchotl, only differing in details, and most importantly, the geography and the descriptions of isolation are the exact same. Howard has a citizen of the city describe it to Conan and Valeria: “There are no streets in Xuchotl […].” “No squares nor open courts. The whole city is built like one giant palace under one great roof. The nearest approach to a street is the Great Hall which traverses the city from the north gate to the south gate. The only doors opening into the outer world are the city gates, through which no living man has passed for fifty years.” Later, in the story, Howard has the leader of Tecuhltli, Olmec, tell the tale of the city. The Tlazitlans dwelt in the city after slaying the original inhabitants. Two brothers Tecuhltli and Xotalanc ruled along with a former slave of the city, Tolkemec. “Five years they dwelt in peace. Then Xotalanc took a woman to wife, a woman whom both Tecuhltli and old Tolkemec desired.” Olmec goes on: “There was much bitterness. Blood was shed on both sides. The quarrel became a feud, the feud an open war.” Valeria thinks: “It was a ghastly, unreal nightmare existence these people lived, shut off from the rest of the world, caught together like rabid rats in the same trap, butchering one another through the years, crouching and creeping through the sunless corridors to maim and torture and murder.”\n\nTo his recreation of Lincoln, Howard adds dragon-like creatures, an eternally young lesbian who needs the blood of young women, large snakes, and an evil ghost armed with super-science. These fantastical elements could be an outlet for him to distance his feelings about Lincoln from his similar feelings about Dark Valley. The fantasy elements are escapist but the story, as a whole, is philosophical. Howard restates his long held beliefs about the tendency for civilizations to decay and adds a bit of very pertinent modern philosophy about the limits of permanent war and its affect on the average citizen. The dialog below illustrates this.\n\n“Suppose with their aid we destroy Xotalanc,” he said. “What then, Xatmec?”\n\n“Why,” returned Xatmec, “we will drive red nails for them all. The captives we will burn and flay and quarter.”\n\n“But afterward?” pursued the other. “After we have slain them all? Will it not seem strange, to have no foes to fight? All my life I have fought and hated the Xotalancas. With the feud ended, what is left?”\n\nXatmec shrugged his shoulders. His thoughts had never gone beyond the destruction of their foes. They could not go beyond that.\n\nHoward sums up the Lincoln County War and his future tale in this portion from the letter to Lovecraft: “Visualize that narrow valley, hidden away among the barren hills, isolated from the world, where its inhabitants inescapably dwelt side by side, hating and being hated, and at last killing and being killed. In such restricted, isolated spots, human passions smolder and burn, feeding on the impulses which gave them birth, until they reached a point that can hardly be conceived by dwellers in more fortunate spots. It was with a horror I frankly confess that I visualized the reign of terror that stalked that blood-drenched valley.”\n\nIt was with horror, perhaps, but the visualization was also a magnificent inspiration.\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nThis is Part 2. Part 1 appeared earlier today.\n\nI couldn’t resist doing a sequel after reading Mike Love’s Good Vibrations: My Life as a Beach Boy. It is definitely akin to Sprague de Camp’s Time and Chance.\n\nBoth Robert E. Howard and Brian Wilson achieved great popularity in the 60s/70s with later ebbs and flows and resurgence during anniversaries. The popular highlights nowadays being media attention: Arnie movies for Conan and John Stamos playing with the band on Full House and at concerts. Parallels can be found. But none more so than the way organized fandom has dealt with change.\n\nMike Love has received abuse from the majority of Brian Wilson’s fans in pretty much the same way Sprague de Camp has received abuse from Robert E. Howard fans.\n\nAs everyone probably knows The Beach Boys were a phenomenally popular band with hit after hit in the early 1960s. Brian Wilson was the main creative force until experimentation with drugs, mental illness, and the pressures of fame became too much and Brian retreated from life. At the time of his major breakdown he was working on an album to be called Smile.\n\nMike Love was the front man for the band. Mike tirelessly continued on after Brian quit touring and plowed through all the hurdles to keep the Beach Boys alive mostly as a live performance band as their record sales plummeted.\n\nThe first 8 chapters of Mike Love’s book are mostly about his early days with the Beach Boys. It starts getting real interesting in chapter 9 and the parallels of Beach Boy fandom with Robert E. Howard fandom become obvious. Mike writes:\n\n“The author, David Leaf, described himself in a 1995 essay as a “Brian Wilson fanatic” who had listened to “Surf’s Up” in 1971 and “believed the death of Smile was the public tombstone for the artistic repression of Brian.” Leaf said that Brian had been submerged by insensitivity and greed “… interrupted while traveling a brand-new path of popular music, and that was clearly a cultural crime.” Brian’s Smile experience had been called many things, but this was the first time it had been called a “crime.” Every crime needs a culprit. So whodunit? It was me.”\n\nThis is very similar to what happened in Howard fandom. The Sprague de Camp edited Lancer Conan series was phenomenally popular and created a Howard Boom that made room for his western, historical, and other non-fantasy stories to appear in paperback. Numerous ersatz Conans came and went: Kothar, Brak, Thongor, and others. None of these things including Howard’s non-Conan work proved as popular as the Conan series.\n\nThe publisher of the hugely successful Conan series went bankrupt and since some of the works were in public domain Glenn Lord along with Kirby McCauley and Karl Edward Wagner came out with the Berkeley Conan series. This series was proclaimed as the real unedited and uncensored Conan. The truth is that Sprague did only minor changes to the stories that appeared in this truncated series and the uncensored part can only apply to Howard’s racism. Nevertheless the seed was planted that Sprague’s editing of the stories was a crime.\n\nA fan named Byron Roark in the pages of a fanzine, Lone Star Fictioneer #3, appears to be the first to clarify Sprague’s crime:\n\n“[…] whether you agree or disagree with my stated opinions, one very important fact remains true: Everyone even vaguely connected with or “posthumously collaborating” with Howard is getting rich off someone else’s name and fame… and the vultures will continue to hover over Cross Plains until the carcass is picked clean and left to rot in the hot Texas sun.”\n\nDe Camp writes in Time and Chance:\n\n“As an old Conan fan, I am naturally pleased with Conan’s success and my part in it. I did not invent Conan; but I am probably the one person most responsible for the Conan boom. Of course others like Catherine, Carter, Lieberman, Lord, and Schwartz also contributed. My work has brought me some abuse, some grief, and a vast loss of irreplaceable time.”\n\nBoth the Beach Boys and the caretakers of Howard’s intellectual property sued and counter-sued each other almost annually. In circumstances like these fans will take sides but in a court of law fans of a particular side are often upset that the other side prevails. It is best not to get overly excited about these things. Both sides have their arguments and non-disclosure agreements veil outsiders from knowing ALL the facts. These things don’t really affect the artist’s work as much as just who gets paid the most for the product. Something I could care less about.\n\nLove’s chief detractor was David Anderle, Mike writes: “[Anderle concluded] that those of us who’d been with Brian his entire life were conspiring to sabotage his career.” Sprague who was a Howard fan since the 50’s and was responsible for the best selling Conan series was likewise conspiring to sabotage Howard’s reputation according to Sprague’s detractors.\n\nMike Love convincingly recounts interview after interview where Brian talks of drug addiction and growing paranoia and breakdown and the collapse of Smile as the result of Brian’s own actions. Mike Love also notes that these supposed friends of Brian were the ones too procure his drugs and encourage this “experimentation.”\n\nIn another parallel Sprague’s detractors, Karl Wagner and Kirby McCauley, like Love’s, were heavy alcohol and cocaine users. The Berkeley series was doomed to fail and doubtfully was ever intended to be complete. It was strictly a money/power play against Sprague. Ace reprinted the Lancer series after an agreement between all parties and money matters were settled.\n\nHoward fanatics complained about this for a decade, as the Ace series remained hugely popular for about a decade. Eventually they went out of print and Sprague became the editor (for a time) of the Tor Conan series which lasted about another decade. Howard fanatics continued complaining. The series was a boon to several new and struggling writers (John Hocking, Sean Moore, John Maddox Roberts, and Robert Jordan, among others.) Even writers Darrell Schweitzer and Robert Price, who submitted books that never appeared in the series, had nice things to say about Sprague. The gig paid well and by all accounts, except Wagner’s, Sprague was encouraging and supportive.\n\nMike’s detractors also accused him of greed and milking Brian for all his worth:\n\n“[…] Much better to blame me and the other Beach Boys as the mercenaries who snuffed out Brian’s creative light. And for Brian’s awestruck biographers (Leaf was only the first) the morality tale of the tormented genius who was undone by his family – putting commerce ahead of art – the tale was too great to resist.”\n\nThe analogy between Love and Sprague might seem to weaken here. Sprague was Robert’s first biographer and Dark Valley Destiny suggests Robert was a tormented genius undone by his family (similar to Love’s complaint about David Leaf). Where the analogy holds is that Robert’s subsequent biographers gloss over his suicidal impulses and his dark moods (akin to Brian’s issues). They decry Sprague’s discussion of Robert’s failings as sabotage and decry the packaging and editing of the Conan series (despite it’s wild success in promoting Robert as the father of Sword & Sorcery) as an example of putting commerce ahead of art.\n\nDe Camp’s editing of the stories first published in Weird Tales is very slight. The Black Stranger was extensively edited and there were edits to the clearly defined posthumous collaborations. The edited Lancer/Ace series is the most popular Conan incarnation (judged by book sales) to date. The editing clearly did not sabotage anything.\n\nConan remains the crown jewel in the Howard Universe and even de Camp’s opponents are following in his footsteps creating games, unauthorized comic books, and knickknacks to further the industry. Roark’s disappointment about others getting rich continues. With public domain laws even the rights holders aren’t getting all the profits.\n\nSprague kept Conan alive by shepherding pastiche after pastiche through Tor Books. The books sold well enough but the Howard opinion makers maligned the effort and maligned Sprague as a greedy vulture feasting on Howard’s legacy. That Sprague’s and soon Perilous World’s efforts afford many an upcoming writer a great opportunity is callously ignored.\n\nMike followed a similar path for Brian as Sprague did for Howard. Mike made sure the Brian Wilson hits were played at every live performance and pastiche in the form of songs like Disney Girls and Kokomo were hits in their own right. New personnel were added to the Beach Boys and upcoming talents like Glen Campbell and Bruce Johnston got a start with the Beach Boys.\n\nBoth Smile and the unedited Conan saw the light of day in this new century. Both were acclaimed by fans and articles praising them appeared. But neither really had the impact that Sprague or Mike’s detractors fervently wished for. The reputations of Brian and Robert went basically unchanged and once initial excitement was over, it was over.\n\nWhat is best for Brian and Robert is for creators to publish new works in Brian and Robert’s respective genres and give them the credit they deserve. George R. R. Martin’s Games of Thrones recognizes a debt to Robert E. Howard. The Beatles Back in the USSR recognizes a debt to Brian Wilson. Beach Boy Greatest Hits are often reissued. A reissue of the Lancer series is overdue.\n\nBrian’s best work was the Sun & Surf genre on Capitol Records and culminated in his last really great recording of Good Vibrations. His solo work always shows promise and skill. But his voice has changed and his new recordings fail to excite a wide audience.\n\nREH’s best work was with Sword & Sorcery published in Weird Tales. Chief of which is his Conan the Cimmerian stories. The REH westerns, boxing stories, etc. are like Brian’s later recordings. They fail to excite a wide audience.\n\nThey both show each to be a talented virtuoso in several genres but neither In the Key of Disney nor the non-S&S stories are what brought the fans and created a legacy. Mike and Sprague promoted the popular efforts of REH and Brian. The best selling Conan series established Sword and Sorcery as a viable genre for comics and film. The live touring and best-hit collections kept Brian in the public’s mind.\n\nREH and Brian fans would do well for their respective creators by remembering this and thanking Mike and Sprague for the work they’ve done promoting REH and Brian instead of creating straw man arguments to build up the hero and tear down the perceived villain. It’s a useless endeavor than cheapens everybody.\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nThis is an update of the article that originally appeared at:\n\nhttp://www.robert-e-howard.org/SandRoughs8ve04.html\n\nEdgar Allen Poe is the king of fantasy/horror literature. Elvis Aron Presley is the king of pop/rock music. H. P. Lovecraft is Bob Dylan. J. R. R. Tolkein is the Beatles.\n\nRobert E. Howard is Brian Wilson.\n\nI suppose the first objection will be that Brian Wilson didn’t commit suicide. Shouldn’t Bob be Phil Ochs, a suicide and always in the shadow of Bob Dylan as REH is to HPL or Jim Morrison, an accidental suicide and talented poet who had a difficult relationship with his family as did REH?\n\nNo.\n\nBrian Wilson created a sub-genre of pop music based on the joys of southern California and thus created sun and surf music. Bob Howard created a sub-genre of fantasy literature based (more or less) on the medieval heroics of Europe and thus created sword and sorcery fiction.\n\nBrian and Bob were similar in several ways. Brian Wilson like Bob Howard had a love/hate relationship with his father. Murray Wilson and Isaac Howard were both hard taskmasters who believed in their son’s talent. Murray rode Brian so hard that it led to his withdraw from touring with the Beach Boys and his later emotional breakdown. Bob would argue with his father initially over his writing career and later issues regarding his mother. Bob felt the hardships of his life with intense emotion and his withdraw from life was more permanent.\n\nBrian was also physically similar to Bob. Both were interested in sports in their youth and were strapping good-looking young men, although later in life they tended toward weight gain. Both Brian and Bob (to a lesser extent) sought escape from their lives by experimenting with alcohol and drugs. Howard writes often of beer drinking and binges and even tells of a (presumably one-time) experience of swiping some drugs from his father’s medicine bag. Brian, of course, abused drugs to the point of his near collapse and death.\n\nBrian’s art, like Bob’s, was pastiched into near irrelevance by his closest associates. Brian’s fellow Beach Boys are usually slammed for their reluctance to follow Brian’s vision. Carl Wilson always loved his brother but he also could be reluctant and critical of Brian’s evolution. Mike Love was Brian’s chief critic. He would constantly berate Brian into changing lyrics to fit more in tune with the “fun times” images that were a staple of “sun and surf” music. Mike was especially displeased with Brian’s collaborations with Van Dyke Parks and lyrics like “columnated ruins domino” were especially vexing to him. L. Sprague de Camp took over Bob’s Conan character and treated Bob’s work in a similar fashion. Sprague thought “sword & sorcery” to be an escapist genre suited only for “fun times.” Most Conan pastiches are patterned after Howard’s more formulaic stories.\n\nIn pure monetary terms it is hard to argue with either man’s vision. “Barbara Ann” from the Beach Boy’s “Party” LP was a bigger hit than (a Brian Wilson solo-effort) “Caroline, No” from the Beach Boy’s “Pet Sounds” LP. The debacle of “Smile” and the huge success of “Endless Summer” gave support to Mike Love’s view that the Beach Boys could make the most money catering to the retro version of Brian Wilson’s art. Similarly the success of the Lancer series taught De Camp that his view of Howard’s art was what the fans wanted.\n\nBrian stayed alive and has slowly reemerged from his shell and has garnered the respect of his contemporaries. “Pet Sounds” is routinely picked as the number one or number two LP of all time by rock critics and musicians. And now Brian has toured the world with his final version of “Smile” available on CD after all these many years. Howard fans kept the torch of “Howard only” text burning and now after all these many years can see the fruit of their labor with the books published by Del Rey. Fan and pro appreciation of these books are a matter of record. Hardcore fan perseverance was essential for the resurrection of both Brian and Bob.\n\nSometimes the hardcore fan can be part of the problem with gaining respect for the genre though. It has become routine for pro-Brian critics to slam sun and surf music knock-offs and non-Brian Beach Boy hits while giving Brian his due. A local paper in a blurb for a New Year’s Eve concert had a critic saying, “[…] the current incarnation of the band is kind of a cruel joke. Their latest publicity photo features a rather smug-looking Mike Love surrounded by seven guys […] it’s probably safe to say that none of them has the last name Wilson […] don’t get your hopes up for any of that Pet Sounds magic.”\n\nSimilarly pro-Bob critics of sword & sorcery will slam sword & sorcery and especially Conan pastiche while giving Bob his due. This attitude appeals to the short sighted fan who intentionally forgets hits like “Disney Girls” and “Kokomo” where Bruce Johnston and Mike Love shine and novels like “Conan the Rogue” where John Maddox Roberts shines and of course the popular Robert Jordan books. The analogy of Brian to Bob and the pastichers to the rest of the Beach Boys certainly fits. Carl Wilson and Mike Love have that weird likable and unlikable spirit of love, respect, jealousy, and envy that L. Sprague de Camp often showed. Al Jardine is Bjorn Nyberg. Nyberg wrote the likable “The Return of Conan” and Al planted the original idea to perform the likable cover version of “Sloop John B.” The Brian Wilson replacements Glen Campbell and Bruce Johnston are akin to Robert Jordan and Karl Edward Wagner. They are talented individuals who had successes of their own. Dennis Wilson is Lin Carter. Dennis was a capable talent on his own overshadowed by his collaborators. His solo work shows a greater talent that he was allowed to display with his collaborative work. Dennis was the “real” Beach Boy. He actually surfed, sailed, and lived the free and easy life that was sung about in the hits. Lin Carter, whatever you may think of his writing ability, definitely had a genuine enthusiasm for fantasy literature. Lin at least tried to copy and study the greats. David Marks, Blondie Chaplin, and the rest are Andy Offutt, Roland Green, and the rest.\n\nBrian and the Beach Boys’ biggest hit together was “Good Vibrations.” There were other hits afterward but “Good Vibrations” and the failed effort of “Smile” was a turning point. This recording was contemporary with the “peace and love” movement and had Brian remained stable and his fellow Beach Boys more in tune with Brian’s developing artistic vision the Beach Boys might have remained a driving force in popular music.\n\nSimilarly Bob Howard was one of the big three of Weird Tales, had he not committed suicide and developed as a writer he almost certainly would have continued to be a driving force in fantasy literature. Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys backed out of the Monterey Pop Festival and their music was critically lost for decades. Bob Howard backed out of life and his writing was critically lost for decades. Without Brian at full capacity but with Mike Love playing a leading role the Beach Boys were still a highly successful touring band albeit trading on the ghosts and dreams of nostalgia. After Howard’s suicide De Camp became the man on the spot for Conan and the de Camp edited Lancer Books were a huge hit and pastiches trading on the memories of better stories became the rule.\n\nDe Camp and Love were, respectively Bob and Brian’s biggest fans, they set the tone for Conan and The Beach Boys. The Beach Boys’ stamina (and admittedly, their weakness without Brian) undoubtedly helped Brian’s critical reevaluation and reemergence. De Camp played a similar role for Bob Howard. The Beach Boys music needed to be played and performed even without Brian. It helped keep the memories alive and solidified their role in popular culture. The Conan pastiches did the same. De Camp and Love had their faults but both are an integral part of the continuing re-emergence and re-evaluation of Bob Howard and Brian Wilson’s art.\n\nBob and Brian, the talent is there, and so are other similarities, if you look for them.\n\nby Brian Kunde\n\nThis is an expansion of a little piece (originally titled “Top Ten New Destinations for Harold Shea”) I posted on the d for de Camp Yahoo group on January 25, 2016, and then reposted to the L. Sprague de Camp- Enchanter of the Quill Facebook group on December 12, 2019.\n\nDe Camp and Pratt’s “incomplete enchanter” did a lot of world-hopping in his career as an explorer of parallel universes, as depicted by the original authors and authorized pastichers. Some of the worlds Harold Shea visited were actualizations of the mythology or legendry of various cultures; others of the literary fantasies of individual authors.\n\nThe former include the worlds of Norse and Finnish mythology and Irish, Roman, Russian and Hindu legendry; the latter the worlds of Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene, Ludovico Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso, Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s Kubla Khan, L. Ron Hubbard’s The Case of the Friendly Corpse, L. Frank Baum’s Oz, Wu Cheng’en’s Xī Yóu Jì (Journey to the West), Miguel de Cervantes’ Don Quixote, Edgar Rice Burroughs’s Barsoom, and William Shakespeare’s The Tempest.\n\nAn impressive list, but there are uncountable numbers of potential destinations where (as far as we know) Shea’s syllogismobile never managed to park. Some, of course, would have been off limits for such real-world reasons as copyright issues. But in an ideal multiverse, where else might Shea fans have liked to see Shea go? For that matter, where might de Camp and Pratt have taken him, had Pratt lived and de Camp not put the brakes on their series for the next thirty-six years? Well, who knows? But here’s a triple handful of possibilities, consisting of my own top ten augmented by some new thoughts and the ideas of others who chimed in on this essay’s previous appearances.\n\nRobert E. Howard’s Hyborian Age. Tonally incompatible, but theoretically possible, since de Camp directed (some say misdirected) Conan’s saga for so long. But since Pratt didn’t like Conan, and de Camp had no thought of continuing the Harold Shea series for decades after Pratt’s death, it never happened. (He did address the notion, once. In a letter published in REHupa 128, 6/11/94, he wrote that he and Christopher Stasheff, with whom he edited the Shea shared world anthology The Exotic Enchanter, “hadn’t considered putting Harold into the Hyborian Age; it might cause legal complications.” So maybe it would have been more difficult than I assume. Other impediments; the fact that the feel of the two series is so different, and the question of whether Conan’s world even have a coherent type of magic that Harold could mastered. After all, Howard was pretty hand-wavy on the details. And, for that matter, would Harold have lasted a millisecond against the Lovecraftian horrors with which Howard populated his creation? Apt considerations. Still, it’s such an obvious idea…\n\nEdgar Rice Burroughs’s Venus. Why, when one considers Shea’s already been to Burroughs’s Barsoom? Simply because Harold Shea and Carson Napier are two of the most incompetent explorers in fantastic fiction! Carson was aiming for Mars, not Venus, remember. And Shea’s attempts to get to one universe landed him in a different one as often as not (though he did improve over time). It’s a match made in fantasy heaven! Besides, Harold might actually do something about those nasty Thorists rather than just run away from them. Unless running away as the solution to every problem is baked into the venue, and let’s face it, this is late Burroughs, so it might be.\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth. Just because. Probably wouldn’t work, but bound to be interesting, even as a train wreck. Downside: Middle Earth magic is mostly fireworks, historical research, secret languages and talking to birds. Unless you’re into rings, anyway. “Want power? Okay, here’s a magic ring, go for it! Oh, BTW, fine print? I rule you all…” Anyway, as Darrell Schweitzer pointed out on reading this suggestion, “Obviously no one is going to get permission to set a Harold Shea story in Middle Earth.” And even if they did, our hero would probably need to get special dispensation from Eru Ilúvatar. So, yeah, any Middle Earth jaunt there would definitely have to be limited to fan fiction. Still, cool place to go.\n\nFritz Leiber’s Nehwon. Here the tones of the two series would actually mesh fairly well. This one could theoretically have been done, maybe even as a collaboration. After all, Fritz Leiber’s series started about the same time and place (Unknown, 1939) as de Camp and Pratt’s (ditto, 1940), and de Camp was friends with Leiber. Alas both series kind of ground to a halt before they were really tight, and de Camp only took up Shea again around the time Leiber passed on, so, um, yeah. Not great timing. But we can dream. Harold could certainly have some interesting conversations with Ningauble of the Seven Eyes about alternate realities. (Hey, maybe he could have a side adventure in the Hellenistic Near East! De Camp would likely have loved that…) Downside: don’t be fooled by all that humorous sophistication, Nehwon can get pretty dicey. For instance, on initially encountering Fafhrd and the Mouser, Harold would almost certainly get mugged. And they’re the good guys!\n\nAmerindian mythology. For some reason, I would just love to see what happened if Harold tried to match wits with Coyote. Downside: Amerindian mythology is really many mythologies, that took many routes into modern literature. Somehow, I suspect de Camp and Pratt would more likely have taken their hero to, say, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s The Song of Hiawatha rather than the Southwestern trickster tales. Then again, Longfellow’s take is Kalevala-compatible, which might have given Harold a leg up on the situation.\n\nE. R. Eddison’s The Worm Ouroboros. Hey, someone’s got to tell those peace-jaded Demon lords that rerunning the late war ad infinitum is actually a really bad idea. Then again, manipulating the local magic system seems to run from difficult to suicidal, and Eddison’s heroes tend to take a short line with anyone beneath their own social level who disagree with them. Harold would probably get along famously with Lord Gro, though.\n\nAndre Norton’s Witch World. Because gods know, the place takes itself way too seriously. Downside: can’t kick a rock there without it being some ancient artifact associated with benevolent of malevolent powers, usually the latter. And Harold would have to learn to be moody-broody with tons of internal doubts really well before he’d have any chance of getting on with the locals. Still … psychologist! Maybe he could help all those Norton lost souls on their interminable personal journeys find themselves. After all, anyone who’s successfully treated the Nome King and Ras Thavas should be able to handle anyone. And, hey, negotiating the boundaries between weird magic and weird science (which is pretty much the theme of the first two Witch World novels) would be right up his alley.\n\nPhil Foglio’s Girl Genius. Yeah, I know it’s a comic, and a web comic at that, but it’s pretty impressively realized. And something tells me Harold would qualify as a major spark there. Downside: Baron Wulfenbach’s predilection for lobotomizing major sparks. But hey, maybe Harold could bring home a pet mimmoth!\n\nH. Beam Piper’s Paratime. Because let’s face it, Verkan Vall needs the headache of learning there’s a whole different multiverse of alternate realities out there beyond the one he’s already losing sleep over! Wonder if Martin Padway’s Gothic Rome is among them? (Though it’s already got a parallel to that in Lord Kalvan’s Aryan-Transpacific sector.) Or course, Vall’s agency tends to give short shrift to anyone who learns the Paratime Secret, and if Shea shows up saying he’s from another universe, he’ll definitely have a target on his back. Oh, well.\n\nPoul Anderson’s fantasy multiverse. That of Three Hearts and Three Lions, A Midsummer Tempest, and Operation Chaos. This one just now occurred to me. I got to it thinking that if Piper’s Paratime wouldn’t do, maybe Anderson’s similar Time Patrol series would. Then I realized it wouldn’t, since the Time Patrol is dedicated to the preservation of a single timeline, and undoing any all alternates. (Plus, no magic, though that by itself isn’t a deal killer.) However, Anderson’s interlinked dimension hopping fantasies, rooted, as were de Camp and Pratt’s, in the Unknown tradition (though written too late to appear therein), should fit our Harold like a glove. Failing that, maybe he could just get together with some fellow dimension-hopping soloists like Marvin Kaye’s J. Adrian Fillmore or George Alec Effinger’s Maureen Birnbaum and compare notes with them…\n\nThe Arabian Nights. Because Harold would be an absolute natural. And the lessons of Spenser and Ariosto would be directly transferable. Matching wits with an irate genie, or forty-odd bad guys? Completely doable! And can’t you just see him at the end of the adventure swapping tall tales with Sinbad at some banquet or other? (I would say tavern, but, alas, the Teachings of the Prophet do not permit recourse to intoxicating beverages among the Faithful…) One would wish this to have been an early de Camp/Pratt piece rather than a late de Camp alone, one, though. In the former, the milieu would be preserved intact, with the authors (and Shea) trying to work out how the weird physics allows a giant bird to fly (let alone carry off an elephant). Which would be fun! In the latter, de Camp would just have rationalized the Roc down into a slightly larger species of albatross.\n\nClark Ashton Smith’s Zothique. Phillip Sawyer suggested this one. Honestly, I don’t know if this would work or not. My experience of Smith is fairly light, consisting mostly of his Hyperborean tales (in the classic Ballantine Adult Fantasy collection edited by Lin Carter). My impression is that a successful sojourn in any Smith venue would very much depend on what short story one ended up in, as he had at least an occasional penchant for dooming his protagonists. Harold could end up quite busy pulling people’s fat out of the fire, and in some instances those people might very happily turn around to push him into that self-same fire. My own feeling is that he might do better in some other author’s vision of a far future, magic-infested world—Jack Vance’s, perhaps—where the threats might be similar, but the tone more compatible. Yeah, I’d have picked Vance, myself. Kind of surprised Phillip didn’t, since he’s a big Jack Vance fan.\n\nH. P. Lovecraft’s Dreamland. Phillip Sawyer and Stephen Allsup each independently made this suggestion. Could work! I suppose Shea might go bats trying to rationalize the magical system of what is quite literally a realm of dream, with all that entails. On the other hand, he’s often at his best when he embraces the zaniness of whatever place he ends up on and just runs with it. And if it all goes south, well, he could always pull a Randolph Carter and just wake the hell up! (For an amusing modern take on Lovecraft’s Dreamland, unfortunately Shea-less, check out Kij Johnson’s The Dream-Quest of Vellitt Boe.)\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle’s world of Sherlock Holmes. Darrell Schweitzer’s suggestion. Unlike Tolkien’s Middle Earth, Holmesian London, having passed into the public domain, would definitely be doable. As a previous iteration of our own world, with no local magic system to learn, it would be harder than some to get into (and out of); Shea would have to be syllogis-out as well as syllogis-in. That’s not to say he couldn’t pull his usual trick of gaming the system; there’s the baked-in tinge of Victorian melodrama he might exploit, or the venue’s rigorous logic, allowing any problem to be resolved (given sufficient intelligence, rationally applied). But would Shea get to meet Holmes? He’d need a sufficiently intriguing dilemma to interest the Great Detective, or that latter could well be in a dismissive mood, and, well, dismiss him. Far too likely. Our hero does sometimes miss out on meeting the main characters of visited worlds, like Lemminkäinen in the Kalevala, and John Carter on Barsoom. Still, Holmes has been bearded by dimensional travelers before. Marvin Kaye’s Shea-knockoff J. Adrian Fillmore met him (more than one version of him, in fact), and even gotten himself a shout-out in the official Doyle canon as figuring in one of the untold cases. (Untold until Kaye told it, anyway.) He turns out to be “Mr. James Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own house to get his umbrella, was never more seen in this world.” (Fillmore’s equivalent of Shea’s syllogismobile is a magic umbrella.)\n\nMark Twain’s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court. I mean, come on, why not? One of the tasks Shea and Chalmers set themselves in worlds they visit is to try fixing things that are going wrong in those worlds. Harold arguably tips the scales of Ragnarok in the gods’ favor by helping recover Frey’s sword in “The Roaring Trumpet.” He and Chalmers similarly help the knights beat the enchanters in “The Mathematics of Magic.” In this respect, Connecticut Yankee is perfect. What doesn’t go wrong in Twain’s novel? De Camp already showed us what he would do with its concept in Lest Darkness Fall, but why not fix the original and turn it to successful modernization rather than abject failure mixed with mass slaughter? One might think Martin Padway would be the man for this job, but he’s already committed, and, besides, doesn’t have the means to shift universes at will, much less hack magic systems. Nope! Plainly a job for Harold Shea!\n\nAnd then there’s one place I wouldn’t like to see Harold stuck in:\n\nDante’s Inferno. Because, I mean, yuck! And Hell’s already been done to death (no pun intended) by Niven and Pournelle—and Janet Morris, for that matter.\n\n#\n\n(8/21-23/2021)\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nOver at YouTube there was a clip available of actor/comedian Joe Rogan giving a spirited defense of Robert E. Howard and Conan. The Podcast host gives a hyper-macho somewhat humorous speech about the greatness of REH and Conan. What makes this important to this article is his summary statement:, “… you’d buy the paperbacks, with the Frank Frazetta oil paintings on the covers! Holy Shit! Those were books!”\n\nWhile fans can argue over his comments about REH’s sanity, you can’t argue with his conclusion. The Lancer paperbacks are totemic. They’ve become a distinctive and venerated symbol of sword and sorcery.\n\nLet’s rehash the familiar story. REH died in 1936 and Conan seemed a goner as well. There was talk of other authors continuing the adventures of Conan but Farnsworth Wright put the kibosh on that idea.\n\nThe Conan stories remained uncollected except for a few that were reprinted in Arkham House’s Skull-face and Others. Derleth said jokingly, the complete stories would need to “printed on blood-colored paper.”\n\nThen publisher Martin Greenberg, whose reputation seems to be one of avoiding royalty payments to authors, along with longtime REH fan John D. Clark editing the first few volumes, began the Gnome Press editions. Author Fletcher Pratt gave a copy of Conan the Conqueror to L. Sprague de Camp. De Camp became an instant fan and took over the character for the next 40 years.\n\nGnome Press went out of business in 1962 and de Camp gambled on taking the books to another publisher. Legal wrangling between him and Greenberg came out in de Camp’s favor and Lancer editor Larry Shaw made the decision to start publishing Conan paperbacks.\n\nLancer Books existed from 1961 – 1973. Irwin Stein and Walter Zacharius were the men behind the curtain. Stein was a former magazine publisher who was betting paperback publishing was the better horse. Zacharius (also an author) was more the financial backer and when Lancer went bankrupt in 1973, he continued on with Zebra and Pinnacle Books.\n\nLarry Shaw, a science fiction writer, was no stranger to SF/Fantasy fandom and publishing and was aware of Frazetta and Krenkel’s art for Ace Books and their successful Edgar Rice Burroughs’ line. According to Arnie Fenner, writing in Icon, Shaw was astute enough to offer Frazetta “twice the pay rate he was getting from Ace and a provision that the original art would be returned to him.”\n\nAccording to Fenner, again from Icon, “Upon publication of the first cover, Conan the Adventurer in 1966, long-time friend and fellow illustrator Wallace Wood clapped Frank on the back and asked, “How’s it feel to be the world’s greatest cover artist?””\n\nConan the Adventurer sold well and was followed with more great Frazetta covers. Sometimes, it is said by the more Frazetta oriented fan, that his covers sold the books. It is, of course, axiomatic that an editor chooses art that sells books. Farnsworth Wright paid Margaret Brundage to sell Weird Tales, publishers paid Robert McGinnis to sell sexy thrillers, Bantam Books paid James Bama to sell Doc Savage and so on.\n\nBut REH’s fiction and the Conan character kept fans buying the books and turning them into million sellers. REH and Frazetta were the perfect combination. Other series with Frazetta covers did not sell as well and Frazetta’s own concepts like Death Dealer and Fire and Ice did not have the impact of Conan.\n\nDid Lancer Books know that Frazetta was such a hit? Even though Larry Shaw hired him and knew he was a talent, they hedged their bets in 1968. Five Conan books were published that year and three of the books featured cover art by John Duillo.\n\nWho knows the thinking at the time? Paying Frazetta for five covers might have been too expensive for the art budget (Frazetta was definitely asking for more money) or maybe they figured the books would sell anyway without Frazetta, or maybe it was an intentional decision to try another artist?\n\nDe Camp apparently had criticized the Frazetta look in some fanzines. I’m unaware of any specific criticisms but de Camp’s final words on the subject appeared in his autobiography Time and Chance. Sounding like your cranky grandpa de Camp writes:\n\n“Conan the Adventurer had a cover by Frank Frazetta, who painted covers for most of the Lancer Conans. Frazetta’s work was superior to that of most illustrators, but he gave Conan something I have objected to ever since. Robert Howard described Conan’s hair "
