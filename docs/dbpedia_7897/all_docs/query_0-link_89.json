        "text": "Sophisticated Suspense.\n\n“Why shouldn’t you have a bit of fun while dealing with the deepest issues of the mind?” – Alan Moore.\n\n“My killers dislocated my electroskeleton…\n\nBent the clear note of my being out of pitch…\n\nOut of harmony with the earth…\n\nBarred from my planet’s emerald heart…\n\nAnd unwilling to burn…\n\nThe turquoise ferns and duck-egg pebbles…\n\nThe aquarium light filtering through clouds of bleached cobalt…\n\n“Everything is blue.”\n\nSeeing as it’s his birthday today, this Post has been set aside to honour Alan Moore, acclaimed creator of such classic comic literature as Watchmen, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, From Hell and V For Vendetta; we shall focus instead on Swamp Thing, because that is where my startled discovery of his great talent was made.\n\nOriginally created as a simple eight-page modern gothic tear-jerker by Len Wein and Berni Wrightson for House of Secrets #92, in 1972, scientist Alex Olsen was “killed” in a chemical explosion, his flaming body hurling into the bayou, only to be soon resurrected as a mossy and morose muck-monster.\n\nEach edition of Moore’s Swamp Thing offered individual brilliance, but for me, none more so than Issue 56 (dated Jan 87).\n\nCan remember reading this one for the first time; entitled: “My Blue Heaven” it was more a case of bewilderment, than being gobsmacked. Rather than displaying the traditional lurid coloured inks of say, Superman or Wonder Woman, this particular issue told a unique story utilising an ingenious monochromatic technique, adding instant mood and atmosphere – every panel was blue.\n\nDidn’t know what to make of it initially, but one thing was clear: here in my hands lay an example of a drastically different form of graphic art, and all my comic-reading years had never prepared my senses to savour a script quite like this.\n\nHappy Birthday To The Wonderful Wizard of Northampton!\n\n“Forever.\n\nI will spend forever here…\n\nAn immortal wandering endlessly towards eternity…\n\nAcross a monochrome landscape…\n\nOne color, ome word.\n\nSo many shades…\n\nThe color of saxophones at dusk…\n\nOf orbiting police lights smeared across tenement windows…\n\nOf loneliness…\n\nOf melancholy.\n\nThe blues.”\n\nWhen planning a movie adaptation of Watchmen, Terry Gilliam (who Moore revealed would have been an excellent choice to direct a Watchmen movie) asked: “How would you make a film of Watchmen?”\n\n“Well, frankly,” Moore replied, “If anyone had bothered to consult me, I would have said ‘I wouldn’t’.”\n\nMoore had written Watchmen expressly to explore the possibilities of the comic book medium, utilising narrative devices that deliberately set out to be unfilmable. So with this title, Moore could really experiment with ways in which a superior sophisticated graphic novel could be presented.\n\nWhat Moore could you want? Who better than the beloved bewhiskered Brit to take this tragic figure but present him optimistically as a creator of his own realm?\n\nInstead of wallowing in loneliness, the Thing creates his own doppelganger: “manipulating… two sets of muscles… I stand and walk toward myself… We touch… marveling to find not the cold hardness of mirror glass… but another palm, cool and dry.”\n\nThus unfolded a dream-like narrative – strange: most certainly; compelling reading: oh yes…\n\nAnd for company, he (re)creates Abby, his long-lost love:\n\n“…As the flowers blossom… in a pale mane from her scalp… I am breathless.\n\n“Oh, she is beautiful… and I am lost.”\n\n“We kiss… then kiss again…\n\nEmbracing, we sink to our knees,\n\nThrough the dreamlike phosphorescence…\n\nOf air too rich in rare gasses,\n\nWe tumble… a kinetic progression…\n\nOf stop-motion glimpses…\n\nSensual and inevitable in their sequence…\n\nA blue movie.”\n\nSwamp Thing helped pave the way for DC Comics to handle more mature topics in an increasing number of titles specifically aimed at a much older readership. Amidst other bold and brilliant titles branded as: “Suggested For Mature Readers,” Swamp Thing did his own distinct and bizarre thing on a monthly basis.\n\nFor four years, Moore took this unlikely titular vegetable hero and revealed it to be just a tragic “shambling mound of foliage” that has merely acquired the consciousness of the dead scientist (now referred to as Alec Holland). This inspired the kind of extended, positively surreal, character study that Moore relishes.\n\nUltimately, the Swamp Thing must banish all thought of ever having been human in the first place, let alone trying to devise the bio-restorative formula to regain that glimmer of humanity. Thus, the creature must – over several episodes – contemplate not only the worthlessness of its existence, but decide what it should do with itself from then on.\n\nWhere else could you find a comic book where the central character foregoes living and merges with the mass-psyche of the earth itself, becoming a vegetable in all senses of the word?\n\n“Like blue bile…\n\nThe scream floods from my throat…\n\nAnd I turn and run…\n\nPast cars that are gradually losing their shapes to the rain…\n\n“I try… to hold the world together in my mind…\n\n“But it slithers from a grasp… made slippery by sap…\n\nIn despair… I let it die…\n\nI let the buildings unravel…\n\nAnd the children fall dead in the streets…\n\nI stop the hearts… of the perspiring old men…\n\nI kill the world.\n\nBlue murder.”\n\nJohn Constantine, the British occult mage/annoying smartass – whose character would about to be considerably expanded in his own highly successful, critically-acclaimed ongoing series called Hellblazer – made his debut in The Saga of The Swamp Thing #37.\n\nHere, he makes another distinctive cameo appearance – as this is Swamp Thing’s own dreamworld, so John is nothing more than an illusion, but still offering an annoying supporting role! Odd, yet compelling material.\n\nFinally, as this Post comes to it’s end, so we reach the final lines of Moore’s classic script:\n\n“I leave… the world that I have made… behind me…\n\nIt shall remain here…\n\nAs a decayed monument… to the pain… of sundered romance…\n\nA bitter love letter… left tear-stained and crumpled…\n\nIn the obscure corner… of the universe…\n\n“A blue valentine.”\n\nVisions Of A Red Planet That Has Seen A Thousand Fictional Civilizations Rise And Fall.\n\n“If it entertains and is clean, it is good literature. If it forms the habit of reading, in people who might not read otherwise, it is the best literature” – Edgar Rice Burroughs.\n\nLike Mark Watney, the unfortunate astronaut stranded on Mars in this month’s sure-fire box-office hit, it is impossible for me to depart the Red Planet – at least, not yet.\n\nHaving explored other movies to be set on our nearest celestial neighbour, this would be a good opportunity to explore a rich assortment of Martian visions that have adorned comic pages over the past few decades.\n\nIt’s amazing how a red planet always teems with green aliens…\n\n“That’s how The League Volume II begins, with the Martian landscape and Edwin Lester Arnold’s Gullivar Jones and Edgar Rice Burroughs’ John Carter, and though it’s not completely wordless, the word balloons are mostly in a Martian dialect that’s not translated on the page for us. Kevin O’Neill draws the heck out of it…” – tor.com\n\nThe artist: Kevin O’Neill (best known for his stunning work on 2000AD’s Nemesis The Warlock), collaborated with writing legend: Alan Moore on an ambitious project in 1999 entitled: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, focussing on a band of famous characters from Victorian literature.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, a second volume of League adventures was published in 2002. It used H. G. Wells’ War Of The Worlds as the basis for a unique slant on the familiar Martian invasion of Earth theme. The opening few pages in which the dialogue is in Martian has just piqued my curiosity even further.\n\nSo be it: yet another tome to look out for this Christmas, methinks.\n\n“There was one slight, desperate chance, [to] take… for Dejah Thoris; no man has lived who would not risk a thousand deaths for such as she” – John Carter.\n\nResistance is futile.\n\nHere is arguably the most popular fictional character associated with the Red Planet, or Barsoom as she calls it. Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, becomes the wife of John Carter, a Virginian cavalry officer “mystically transported” to Mars.\n\nFrom her introduction in Edgar Rice Burroughs’ novel: “A Princess Of Mars” in 1912 to her most recent appearance in Dynamite Comics, she has hardly worn anything more than a tiara, breast ornaments and some strategically-placed jewellery. Traditionally, the typical damsel who lies at the feet of the Earthman, the late ’70s Marvel Comics run portrayed her in a more feisty and fearsome light, showing her deft capabilities with both swords and blasters.\n\nThou shalt not underestimate a lass who has thwarted the Comics Code Authority as well as disposable alien adversaries for so long…\n\n“Nonsense! I like Chocos, certainly. What is not to like?” – Martian Manhunter.\n\nAnd then there is Martian Manhunter, a stalwart of DC Comics’ The Justice League. J’onn J’onzz hailed from what he called: “Ma’aleca’andra.” Created by writer Joseph Samachson and artist Joe Certa, this heavily-built and bald-headed green-skinned hero – the last surviving member of his race – made his debut in Detective Comics #225 “The Manhunter from Mars” in November 1955.\n\nMy main introduction to this mighty emerald fella was in my all-time fave DC series – a positively mind-blowing four-parter series from 1988 entitled: The Weird (this will receive its own forthcoming Post!) where the titular alien – newly arrived on Earth – proceeds to shove Martian Manhunter out of one comic panel and into the next. Not a wise move!\n\nThese days, he appears to have had a radical makeover; his humanoid physicality ditched for a suitably more imposing “Martian” look. Although now he runs the risk of being mistaken for Tars Tarkas: John Carter’s main Thark comrade.\n\n“Watchmen wasn’t about a bunch of slightly dark superheroes in a slightly dark version of our modern world. It was about the storytelling techniques, and… the range of what it was possible to do in comics” – Alan Moore.\n\nHow can anyone discuss comic art in relation to Mars and not mention Watchmen? Written by the legendary Alan Moore, with art by the iconic Dave Gibbons, this superhero classic graces TIME magazine’s 100 Greatest Novels Of All Tine and rightly so.\n\nDr. Manhattan, the Superman of the Alternate Earth of 1985, exiles himself on Mars after the (ultimately false) accusation that the “accident” in 1959 – vapourised inside the intrinsic field test chamber of his lab – is the direct cause of the cancer diagnosed in his closest work colleagues. He brings companion, Laurie Juspeczyk – the second Silk Spectre – to Mars to help him decide whether to continue intervening in Earthly matters.\n\nSo, where else in this galaxy can a “posthuman god” go to contemplate his commitment to saving the human race?\n\n…Or a superheroine to receive the revelation of who her real father is?\n\n“A world grows up around me. Am I shaping it, or do its predetermined contours guide my hand? …Who makes the world?” – Dr. Manhattan.\n\nHere are a few more examples of Martian comic art. The range of quality and quantity of comics connected to the fourth planet is staggering.\n\nThe mere handful selected for this Post alone demonstrates what an overwhelming inspiration the endless mysteries of Mars have been to generations of comic book creators.\n\n“Growing up, I think I went to Mars more often than Manhattan… a land of strange and savage beasts (Thoats! Tharks! Sandmice!), whispering winds, towering mountains… and crumbling porcelain cities where mystery and adventure lurked around every corner” – George RR Martin.\n\nFinally, rather than end this Post with a shameful gallery celebrating the form of Dejah Thoris, here, instead, are excerpts from a rather splendid classic strip from the September 1958 issue (no. 3) of Race For The Moon.\n\nThis particular story was drawn – and most likely written – by another great comics legend: Jack Kirby. Interestingly, this “Face On Mars” predates the notorious oft-published photograph of the Face of Cydonia by 18 years.\n\nIt’s best to let the sheer awesomeness of the following pages speak for themselves…\n\n“Get your ass to Mars!”\n\nCheers!"
