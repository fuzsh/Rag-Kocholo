Power and Dr. Peter Coogan\n\nPart Three in a series of articles by Coogan and Power about the life and influences of John Carter\n\n\"Eternal love.\" This phrase is often one of those hyperbolic terms used to describe emotion that is deep, strong and intended to last a lifetime, or perhaps beyond.\n\nIn the case of John Carter and Dejah Thoris, the term eternal love is not mere hyperbole but an accurate description of a love that truly transcends the boundaries of life, death, time, and space.\n\nIn 1866, a flash of red caught John Carter's eye and his life was forever changed. \"My attention was quickly riveted by a large red star close to the distant horizon. As I gazed upon it I felt a spell of overpowering fascination--it was Mars, the god of war, and for me, the fighting man, it had always held the power of irresistible enchantment. As I gazed at it on that far-gone night it seemed to call across the unthinkable void, to lure me to it, to draw me as the lodestone attracts a particle of iron.\"\n\nWhat really drew John Carter to Barsoom? The answer lies in his distant and forgotten past.\n\nThis is the third of several articles focusing on the history and influences of John Carter. The two previous articles in this series are, John Carter: Torn from Phoenician Dreams and The Lives and Times of John Carter. \"John Carter: Torn from Phoenician Dreams\" established that John Carter began his existence as Phra, a Phoenician trader who was born circa 88 B.C. Phra lived from 88 B.C. to 1588, although only consciously for about a dozen years. Between 63 B.C. and 1588 he had five periods of hibernation of several centuries each. Yet he was awakened more often than he believed as discussed in the aforementioned article and in \"The Lives and Times of John Carter\". \"The Lives and Times of John Carter\" provided detailed timeline of John Carter's various identities throughout out history. In most of his various identities he would meet a woman with whom he fell swiftly and passionately in loves, just as John Carter did for Dejah Thoris\n\nThe reason for the swift and sudden passion for these various women begins in 58. B.C. A flash of red caught Phra's eye and his life was forever changed.\n\nPhra was the master of a Phoenician trading ship, circa 58 B.C. On one trading mission his ship put to shore to take on supplies. The secluded cove where they had chosen to anchor was already occupied by a pirate ship, which had anchored for the same reason. The pirate ship and its crew allowed Phra's vessel to anchor unmolested. The pirate ship already had a full hold of fresh slaves. Not wishing to risk his cargo and because Phra's ship and complement was larger than his own, the pirate ship ignored Phra and his men.\n\nThe pirate's slaves were ashore being exercised. Phra saw a flash of red among them, the hair of a red-headed woman who was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. Immediately he knew that he had to possess her and quickly made arrangements with the pirate captain to buy her. Noting Phra's great interest in the beautiful slave, the pirate tried to gouge him. Phra signaled for one of his crewmen to slip behind the pirate captain and throw a noose around him. The pirate captain was choked until he agreed to a reasonable price. Phra left the pirate captain bound and gagged but with the agreed upon price at his feet.\n\nPhra's account is rather silent about the specific dynamics of the initial relationship between Phra and Blodwen. This may have been due to Phra's lack of memory, due to the pain that remembering the early passion of his lost love caused, or it may be due to Phra's Victorian editor Edwin Arnold who would have been reticent about detailing such \"sordid\" details and make his main character as less than virtuous. It is almost certain that Phra and Blodwen entered into an intimate relationship while aboard the ship, although it would have been unlike Phra to have forced his attentions onto an unwilling female despite owning her. It is probably almost certain that Blodwen knew why she had been bought and considering the alternative to become the captain's woman or the crew's, she chose the former.\n\nPhra was handsome (throughout the ages women have fallen for his looks) so Blodwen may have been as immediately physically attracted to him as he was to her. There is also the additional factor that she may have looked upon him more as her \"rescuer\" than her new owner.\n\nAs Blodwen's time on the ship passed, she became more a part of the crew, learning much of the ship's activities and labor. She taught Phra the language and customs of her people and told him of the riches that he could find if he began to trade with Britain. As happens in many couples, she began to take control of their relationship, despite her legally subservient role.\n\nAfter a few months, Phra decided to follow Blodwen's advice and sailed from Marseilles to Britain. The ship became caught in a ferocious channel storm. Blodwen offered to steer them into a safe cove. Phra and the men readily agreed. The safe cove turned out to be Blodwen's home village, where she was the princess of that particular tribe of Britons. Landing upon the shore, Phra and his men soon discovered that the tables had turned, they became the captives of Blodwen's people. Blodwen was now ruler of the tribe, her father having been killed in the same raid that taken her as a captive. Blodwen's ascendance angered her cousin Dhuwallon, a druid and also the next in line to become chieftain. He had in fact been chieftain until her arrival. He planned to wed her to continue his rule, but Blodwen had other plans.\n\nBlodwen was grateful to the Phoenicians for having rescued her and she was also deeply in love with Phra. She convinced him to become her consort until he departed. She used her influence to gather trade goods from the surrounding areas to fill his ship's hold. This process took several months during which time Blodwen gave birth to Phra's child. On the day before Phra was to sail away, he discovered that his crew and ship were gone. They had abandoned him in Britain. Phra was not certain but believed Blodwen had something to do with their departure. In truth he was not that upset for he had been torn about leaving her. Phra settled down to become the warrior princess' consort and protector.\n\nIn a few years word came that ships had once again arrived on their shores. It was quickly ascertained that these were not Phra's fellow Phoenicians but rather Romans, who had decided to make Britain part of their republic. Phra and several of Blodwen's warriors were dispatched with warriors from other tribes to drive the Romans back to the Continent. Dhuwallon accompanied Phra. As Phra and his men approached the Romans, Dhuwallon threw his javelin at Phra and struck his horse in the throat. Phra was thrown from the dying horse and captured by the Romans.\n\nBecause of his swarthy coloring, Phra was interrogated by the Romans, including being interviewed by Julius Caesar.\n\nDuring the time Phra was held captive by the Romans, the combined British defensive force failed to drive the Romans away. Phra escaped and returned to his tribe. Dhuwallon convinced the Britons that Phra had turned traitor and so was the cause of their defeat. The ruling council of druids and leaders from the various tribes sentenced Phra and three others to be sacrificed to a deity Phra calls Baal. This was probably Belatu-Cadros, the Celtic god of war and of the destruction of enemies.\n\nDhuwallon whispered to Phra that he should not worry about Blodwen, he would take care of her. Phra saw two of his fellow sacrificial victims decapitated and saw the bronze adz descending towards his head when the Roman cavalry and soldiers rode into attack the Britons. For whatever reason, the adz did not decapitate Phra but left a deep cut in the back of his neck that probably went into his spine.(1)\n\nIn a few days it was noticed that the body of Phra did not corrupt. Since Phra's body did not decompose, plus given the fact that the Romans had attacked as Phra was being sacrificed, Blodwen convinced the Druids that the gods had rejected Phra's sacrifice because Phra was innocent of the charges laid against him by Dhuwallon. She also convinced them that Dhuwallon had overstepped his authority and that Phra needed to buried in a cairn that befit his station as her prince-consort.\n\nIn her audiences with the druids Blodwen received some devastating news, although she had Phra's body returned to her, he was forever lost to her. Since Phra was a Phoenician who had followed a false religion and Blodwen was a Celt and had followed the true religion, they would never again see one another, not even in the afterlife. When Phra finally expired from his wound, he would be consigned to whatever hell was reserved for unbelievers.\n\nBlodwen seemed to resign herself to this fate and began to create a tattoo upon Phra's body that would detail her life, the lives of their children and the village. It began in the small of his back and covered his chest. Her reasoning was that when he awoke in the afterlife, he would at least know what had happened to his wife and their children. The Druids' council acceded to her wishes in this matter.\n\nYet Blodwen was more than merely a princess, she also had some druidic training and used this for her own purposes, which would have been forbidden had the druids known about it. Into the design of the tattoo she worked the ogham symbols of Saille (willow) for love, Huathe (hawthorne) for binding, Nion (ash) for rebirth and regeneration, Ioho (yew) for death, and Ur (heather) for passion. In addition to working the tattoos into the design of her large outer tattoo, Blodwen also tattooed Phra in secret places on his body so that even if her outer symbols were discovered and somehow altered, these would be hidden. She tattooed him on his inner eyelids, his armpits, his anus, inside his nostrils, the underside of his tongue and the underside of his scrotum. These special tattoos were burned into his flesh with a pin that had been soaked in a combination of Blodwen and Phra's blood; the burned symbols were inked over with an ink consisting of a mixture of Blodwen and Phra's blood and ashes; the ashes were derived from pieces of Phra and Blodwen's hair, nails, and skin being burnt to ash.\n\nYet had Blodwen had complete druidic training she would have known that many of the symbols that she had used also had meanings opposite of what she wished to accomplish. She used the symbols of Nion (ash) Ioho (yew) and Ur (heather) slightly more than the other symbols. Ash was the symbol of Gwydion, the Celtic trickster god; whether this played in the outcome of this ritual is anyone's guess. In addition to its positive meanings, ash can also mean hidden influences and false appearances. Ioho (yew) also has negative meanings of loss, discord and grief. In addition to being the symbol for passion, Ur (heather) can also mean futility.\n\nThere was also a complication in Blodwen's plan for them to be forever joined in the afterlife, Phra did not die. Phra had become immortal. (2) Although it seems unlikely that her ritual had anything to do with his immortality, it did successfully bind their souls. As a consequence because Phra did not die, Blodwen was never allowed entrance into the afterlife. It is perhaps fortunate that in addition to using the symbols to bind their souls, she also used symbols that called for renewal and rebirth. Had she not, Blodwen may have been consigned to an existence as a mere spirit forever bound to this immortal man; as it was she was sent on a journey of many life times as she was reincarnated numerous times.\n\nWe cannot be certain as to how the process worked, whether she reincarnated when Phra awakened, if her reincarnations triggered his awakenings, or if she was reincarnated in a cycle not necessarily tied to his sleep cycle and so had reincarnations when he was asleep. It does appear that when she was reincarnated and he was awake some confluence of events managed to get them together. Only in a few reincarnations did she seem to be aware that she was Blodwen and then most often not until she was dying. These awakened reincarnations seem to have coincided with Phra being consciously Phra and not suffering from his periodic bouts of amnesia.\n\nThe ancient Celts believed in a form of reincarnation in which people were reincarnated in their descendents. While this is possible, since Blodwen and Phra had children and since Blodwen's reincarnations were primarily in Britain, the lack of any familial link between many of these women and to Blodwen makes this seem a distant possibility. There is however one definite connection between the various incarnations of Blodwen that may have been overlooked or else attributed to Phra due to male gender bias. One of the main themes in Edwin Arnold's edited version of Phra's manuscript is the fact that Phra seems to awaken on the cusp of a monumental change in Britain's history. Phra had four major periods of consciousness, which correspond to times of a change of government or of a threat against Britain: 408-410 AD, corresponding to the fall of Romano-Britain; 1066, corresponding to the Norman Invasion; 1346, during the midst of the Hundred Years War and on the eve of the battle of Crecy; and 1586-1588, corresponding to trouble with the Spanish.\n\nYet one is prompted to ask why would Phra be \"called\" to defend Britain in these times of distress? Phra was British only by marriage, he had no real blood connection to the land. Yet his wife Blodwen did have a strong connection to Britain. She was a British Queen; although not queen of all of Britain, her connection to the land was strong. The connection between the blood royal is believed to be strong, and Blodwen's spell of binding may have bound her fate to Britain as well as to Phra. (3) The explanation may simply be that in each case that Phra awoke when Britain was threatened, but it may have been Blodwen who was called by Britain to defend it. She awoke to a semi-aware state, but it took Phra's arrival to fully awaken her. In other words, when Blodwen reincarnated while Phra slept, he awoke and was conscious of being Phra. When Phra was awake but in an amnesiac state, Blodwen would be reincarnated but would not be conscious of being Blodwen. They would, however, be drawn to one another, and when they met their passion and love would be instantaneous.\n\nWhen Blodwen was awakened, so was Phra because of their binding. He was compelled to seek her. In each case that Phra awoke, he usually awoke in time to affect some great change in Britain's destiny. In 410, he had the chance to rally the defense of the Roman population against the Saxon invaders yet faltered. In 1066, he could have saved the life of King Harold and prevented the end of Saxon England yet did not achieve this goal. In 1346, he had the opportunity to prevent the loss of the French possessions of the Plantagenet Kings through his heroic example on the field of battle yet left the war before it was completed. In each case his failure was caused in part by Blodwen.\n\nIn 410 Numidea (Blodwen) fell into a raging torrent, and Phra opted to try to save her rather than continue with the Roman retreat. In 1066, he could have saved King Harold but was prevented by the circumstance of being sent away from the field of battle by a well-meaning hermit who sent him to get reinforcements. During the same period he also had the opportunity of placing his wife Editha (Blodwen) on the throne of England by leading a rebellion against the Norman conquerors, yet he opted to flee with his family rather than risk them. But this flight appeared not to have saved them either. In 1346, Phra was well on his way to rallying the English troops to a general victory against France after their victory at Crecy. However, fate and Blodwen once again got in the way. Blodwen's incarnation in this instance, Isobel Oswaldton, had accompanied Phra to France in the guise of Flamaucoer, a man-at-arms. When Isobel was killed defending Phra, he felt compelled to let her family know the tragedy that had befallen her. He returned to England but never made it to her family, once more entering a sleeping period. Time and again he failed to change Britain's fate.\n\nIn 1586, Blodwen realized that despite the great threat that the Spanish represented, she and Phra would not be needed, England had reached the pinnacle of her power and could emerge victorious without their aid. Yet their union was not to be a happy one for she died a young and violent death, apparently poisoned by a Spanish servitor.\n\nThere seems to be a cycle of love, loss, and failure connected with each of the Blodwen and Phra incidents. He was taken from her with a violent death, although the death was not permanent. After the cycle of reincarnation and death began, in each of her awakened incarnations she predeceased him, usually dying young and in a violent fashion. As Numidea she drowned in a raging torrent, as Editha she may have been cut down by Norman soldiers, as Isobel Oswaldton she died in battle, and finally as Elizabeth Faulkner she was poisoned.\n\nThis pattern was carried through in Blodwen's unawakened reincarnations as well, although to a lesser degree.\n\nThe unawakened reincarnations of Blodwen that can be identified are Igraine, Empress Matilda, Maid Marian, and Bertrade Montfort.\n\nAs Uther Phra felt a great passion for Igraine upon seeing her. Their passion resulted in a tryst that can be viewed as adulterous but considering that her husband died on the battlefield moments before they actually began, it was not technically adultery. Their passion was however short-lived because Igraine gave birth to a stillborn child whom Merlin buried. She became convinced that Uther had given their child to Merlin, and Igraine left his court. Despite their great love for one another, they remained apart. As Uther Phra was not as effective as he had been as Ambrosius Aurelius or as he would be as Arthur. The difference seems to be the presence of Igraine (Blodwen)\n\nThe Empress Matilda was the daughter of Henry I of England. Phra was at the time using the name Ferraut and was attached to the King's guard. He accompanied Matilda to Germany when Matilda was married off to the Holy Roman Emperor. Although there was an unspoken passion between Matilda and her guard, they kept their relationship platonic and professional. Ferraut had one recorded tryst with Judith of Swabia, the result of which was the future Emperor Frederic Barbarossa. After the Holy Roman Emperor died, Matilda was summoned back to her father's court. Matilda believed that as a widow she had the right to take Ferraut as her lover, which she did. Matilda's father married her off once again to the fourteen-year-old heir of the Anjou provinces of France. Theirs was not a happy marriage. Matilda continued her affair with Ferraut, considering him her true husband. The child Henry was actually that of Ferraut and Matilda, although the other two children were Geoffrey of Anjou's.\n\nWhen Matilda's father died, she was the designated heir, but the barons balked at being ruled by a woman with a foreign husband; so they had her cousin Stephen crowned king instead. Matilda, Ferraut, and Geoffrey of Anjou spent years attempting to wrest the crown from Stephen and finally succeeded, only to have Stephen return and become king once more. Ferraut was wounded during the final phase of the civil war and disappeared.\n\nAs Maid Marian Blodwen did not meet Phra until some time after his identity as Robin of the Woods was established. She was already married at the time to one of the sheriffs of Nottingham, but when Marian and Robin encountered one another sparks flew and she left her husband. Marian's husband was killed shortly thereafter in single combat by Robin, and Marian was free to marry him. Although this episode in their lives was relatively stable, their relationship was beset by separation and turmoil because of their lives as outlaws. In the end Marian died from violence inflicted upon her during captivity from the Sheriff of Nottingham appointed in 1247. She predeceased Phra once again, although he shortly afterward fell into a comatose state due to wounds.\n\nBlodwen's incarnation as Bertrade de Montfort was a brief one. As usual, when she and Phra met sparks flew; even though they remained unaware of their previous existences, the attraction was immediate. Their initial courtship was stormy and fraught with peril as Norman of Torn (Phra) fought against the king's forces and against Betrade's brother Simon de Montfort's forces, as seen in Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Outlaw of Torn. Eventually Norman was taken off the lists of the outlaws, and Bertrade and he were married. Their marriage was however short lived as she died in child birth the year after their marriage took place.\n\nThe pattern seems too specific to be mere coincidence. Almost in every case Blodwen dies an agonized death, but those in which her Blodwen persona seems to have been awakened the death is all the more tragic and violent. There are a few possible explanations for this. In her binding spell, by unwittingly using the ash symbol Blodwen invoked the god Gwydion. Her name might have caused Gwydion to play a mischievous trick upon her. (4)\n\nAnother possibility is that her cousin Dhuwallon played a role. Dhuwallon was a druid and he was also sacrificed, due in no small part to his attempt to rid himself of Phra and his rival Blodwen. Just prior to his death Dhuwallon may have laid a curse upon Phra and Blodwen so that any happiness they might have had in the afterlife would eventually turn to tragedy.\n\nAnother possibility is that their recurrent separation and the violent deaths of the various incarnations of Blodwen was an unforeseen price Blodwen had to pay to ensure the effectiveness of her ritual. They got to be together eternally, but only at the price of continually losing each other and suffering the pangs of death and separation.\n\nAfter the death of the Blodwen in her Isobel Oswaldton incarnation, the dynamic between Phra and Blodwen began to change. Blodwen had noticed some distinct patterns in their recurrent incarnations that prevented them from achieving a lasting happiness or peace. The first of course was her pattern of violent death, the other was the periods of amnesia that both she and Phra experienced. On Phra's part this seemed to be the result of his inability on a psychological level to deal with the trauma that their pattern of love and tragic loss entailed. She also noticed from remembering her various incarnations that when Phra was not consciously Phra he was often stronger psychologically and often had a more dynamic personality. She may also have realized that it was her presence as an awakened Blodwen that triggered the weaker Phra personality to emerge from its shell. Even in his stronger personas her presence seemed to have a detrimental effect as he became less effective in her presence or made bad decisions, which led to lives of constant turbulence, although it may be more likely given her original personality that she believed he was less effective because she was not giving him her conscious guidance.\n\nWhen she incarnated as Igraine and met Uther, Phra as Uther was less effective than Phra as Ambrosious Aurelius had been. By the time Igraine had left Uther, the damage had been done and it took several years before he regained his confidence to emerge as Arthur. Arthur was effective but ultimately failed because of Uther and Igraine's relationship as Igraine's daughter resented Arthur and trained her son to bring about his down fall.\n\nAs Sir Ferrault, the Empresses Matilda's bodyguard, Phra never achieved his full potential but was content to guard and wait upon Matilda. It was as if having lost Blodwen in previous incarnations he chose to use this lifetime to guard her from as much harm as he could.\n\nAlthough he was successful in keeping her from harm, he was unable to secure her position as Queen of England and the struggle eventually cost him his life.\n\nAlthough Phras existence as Robin of the Woods seems to have predated Blodwens reincarnation as the woman known as Maid Marian, her presence would be disruptive. Although Robin would fight for the often down trodden rights of the yeoman and underclass by absentee, corrupt, or uncaring aristocrats, he would never be able to coalesce this resistance into any lasting form as a body politic, a social change, or even a successful rebellion against a weak king.\n\nAs Robin Phra's life was spent mostly as an outlaw and so without any stability, except for his relationship with Marian. In this incarnation Marian does not seem to have borne any children, although as with all of the Robin Hood legends accounts that differ can undoubtedly be found.\n\nBlodwen next reincarnated as Bertrade de Montfort, the daughter of Simon de Montfort, the second most powerful man in Britain. Phra's persona in this instance was an odd one; he had been convinced by the dastardly Jean de Vac that he was de Vac's son and had become the notorious Norman of Torn, an outlaw knight. Prior to having met Betrade, Phra as Norman had been well on his way in making his outlaw band the most powerful army in England and by this fact Norman was close to becoming the de facto King of England by eliminating both the King's forces and the rebel forces under Simon de Montfort. Having met Bertrade, Norman's loyalties became divided; he doubted the rightness of his path and lost his focus. Instead of becoming the preeminent power in England, a power that may have brought about some measure of social equality albeit under an autocratic rule, Norman of Torn allied himself with Simon de Montfort, weakening the power of the King. This would ultimately lead to Norman's downfall, as Prince Edward, the heir to the throne, would nurse a grudge against Norman, especially when it was revealed that Norman was the long lost Prince Richard. Prince Edward never believed this but kept his peace for his parents' sake.\n\nIn this incarnation Blodwen's time with Phra was very short; she died in childbirth a year after their marriage.\n\nAlthough Norman continued to live and even achieved a measure of stability through having his name removed from the outlaw list and marriage to a nobleman's daughter, he would eventually be outlawed again and hunted down. The cause of his being outlawed again and the subsequent manhunt originated with his choice to fight on the side of Simon de Montfort because of Bertrade. So once again Blodwen had unwittingly caused harm to Phra.\n\nBlodwen next reincarnated in Isolde de Oswaldton. During this incarnation Isolde eventually became aware of being Blodwen because Phra was consciously Phra. By this time the many incarnations of Blodwen each with their own special tale of love-won-and-love-lost-to-tragedy was bearing heavily on Phra's mind. Although he was drawn to Isolde almost from their first meeting, Phra convinced himself that he was in love with Isolde's older sister, the unattainable Alianora. He ignored Isolde's obvious instant attraction for him. When Alianora rejected his troth, Phra felt despair and decided to forget her by losing himself in glorious combat. He joined King Edward III's war against France as an unattached knight. He was joined in this quest by a young man named Flamaucoer, who became his boon companion.\n\nHaving distanced himself from the presence of Isolde, Phra realized that it was she he had loved and vowed to return to her and woo her once the war was finished. During the Battle of Crecy, Flamaucoer saved Phra by intercepting a lance charge meant for him. As Phra stripped off Flamaucoer's armor to tend to the wound, he discovered that Flamacoer was none other than Isolde in disguise.\n\nShe died and he realized that she had also been Blodwen, as had so many of his loves before that.\n\nPhra requested of King Edward that he be allowed to return to England and tell Isolde's family what had become of her. King Edward granted this request but gave Phra the mission of also delivering a message to the queen.\n\nPhra's ship foundered in a channel storm and he was nearly drowned. He climbed into a sea cavern for shelter. The cavern's roof collapsed under the fierce tides and sealed Phra inside the airtight chamber. The near drowning, the lack of oxygen, and the tragic loss of Blodwen caused Phra to once again fall into one of his sleep periods. (5)\n\nSomething odd happened after this. Phra experienced two of his awakened but amnesiac states, yet in neither one does he meet the reincarnated Blodwen. There are a few possible explanations for this. Blodwen's tragic and traumatic death may have affected her to the extent that she resisted being reincarnated because she did not want to go through the pain and agony once again. It may also be that she realized that their pattern of love won and love lost, of life and death, would continue unless a dramatic change happened to the cycle. Although it is possible that she might have realized that her presence was a root cause of Phra's continuing psychological problem of amnesia and ineffectual behavior, this seems to be improbable. What person really wishes to admit that their existence causes problems for their lover?\n\nAnother possibility is that Blodwen may have indeed reincarnated but that Phra refused to heed to the siren call of her reincarnated presence. Had he not been amnesiac, it is probable that he would not have been able to avoid being drawn to her, so close was the binding between Phra and Blodwen. But by convincing himself that he was not Phra, he found a way around the siren call. Why he did it is not too hard to guess. The tragic death of Blodwen as Isolde was a devastating blow to Phra, compounded with the realization that all of his lost tragic loves had been Blodwen made Phra wish to avoid any romantic entanglements at all.\n\nTo avoid meeting Blodwen in her reincarnated state, Phra left Britain for an extended time. He even went into one of his hibernative periods far from Britain in a cavern near Ephesus. Eventually, however, the draw back to Britain was too powerful to ignore, as was the draw towards Blodwen. After Phra in one of his temporary identities fought in the Battle of Flodden Field, he was drawn towards Southern England to the site that had been the village of Blodwen. The village was long gone and all that remained were the stone tombs of ancient chieftain. He did not know why he had traveled there but took shelter in a tomb for the night. Climbing inside he knocked a keystone loose and was trapped inside.\n\nIn 1586, Phra awoke and was conscious of his identity. This was his final awakening as Phra. Shortly after awakening, Phra was drawn to the incarnation of Blodwen. This was Elizabeth Faulknerthe daughter of Sir Adam Faulkner, a scholar who had spent much of his wealth on building a machine that would \"run, walk and fly and haul and pull and hew wood and draw water.\" From Phra's description it seems to be some sort of basic internal combustion engine that could be altered to be used in many ways.\n\nIn his creation of the great engine Adam Faulkner had studied in many disciplines, including the occult and alchemy. Faulkner possessed a huge library filled with arcane books, scrolls, and objects from all over the world.\n\nFaulkner's great creation turned out to be a calamitythe mechanical marvel had no guidance system and its ungoverned locomotion nearly killed Faulkner and Phra before Phra succeeded in wrecking enough of the machine's moving parts to bring it to a halt.\n\nAfter this debacle, Faulkner returned to his study of ancient lore with the idea of replenishing his depleted fortune. The manuscript of a Brother Ambrose provided Faulkner with the location of a buried Roman fortune. Faulkner and Phra followed the instructions that led straight to an abandoned Roman villa. Phra recognized the place as belonging to Lady Electra. As Faulkner and Phra neared the hills where the villa was supposed to be located, they were greeted by a man wearing a cape, hood, and wide slouch hat. Faulkner paid the local man to guide them to a certain hill. Yet as Phra fell asleep in the presence of the cloaked and hooded figure with a shepherd's rook he saw a mysterious man who told Phra he had been waiting for him for centuries. He directed Phra to drink from a mysterious fountain before fading away. Faulkner seemed unaware of any of this mysterious behavior on the stranger's part.\n\nFaulkner and Phra found the body of a Roman centurion whom Phra \"recognized\" as an old friend of his. After he and Faulkner returned to Faulkner's mansion with their finds, Phra was seized by a desire to revisit his past by writing his memoirs. He had also fallen in love with Elizabeth Faulkner, Adam's young daughter. Elizabeth was also quite intelligent and learned far beyond her years. Although there was no physical resemblance, Phra saw much of Blodwen in her.\n\nSince he was unaware of them, Phra's memoirs naturally enough do not contain any information about his amnesiac wanderings. In writing his memoirs he glossed over any incongruities such as the disappearance of his tattoo, his instant facility with languages and cultures, his ability to blend into new social eras without raising eyebrows, and his martial training. Had his life occurred exactly as recorded in his memoir, he would have moved from being a bronze-age warrior to a man familiar with the arms of the 16th century almost in the blink of an eye (he spent a mere fifteen years \"awake\" as Phra during these many centuries).\n\nThe appearance of the mysterious figure who seemed to have spurred Phra's need to write his memoirs is intriguing, especially in the light that Faulkner did not perceive anything mysterious about this figure. The mysterious hooded figure told Phra to remember. Yet as the memories began to flow, Phra immediately began to organize and tailor them into a focused narrative. The hooded man was merely a local man; any mysterious behavior associated with him came from Phra's unconscious mind. Faulkner and Phra's search for the Roman villa was inspired by a manuscript from a Brother Ambrose. This name triggered memories in Phra that he did not realize he possessed, and this disturbed him. At the same time he was falling in love with Elizabeth Faulkner and realizing she was Blodwen. He knew or must have known that they were doomed to repeat their tragic cycle once more. He did not wish to lose her again. Without realizing it his unconscious mind provided him a possible way of breaking the cycle. (6)\n\nThe tragic cycle of life and love between Phra and Blodwen may have been a curse, or it may have been a price for her binding of their souls. Yet Phra merely acquiesced to the situation and did not attempt to find a solution to their dilemma. Although he was outwardly brave and at times heroic, at his core Phra shrank from confronting the emotional pain that resulted from the double traumas he associated with Blodwen. These were the pain and agony of death, which he equated with Blodwen because it was her people and their culture that had \"killed\" him in 68 B.C., and the emotional pain Blodwen's demise always caused him once she had perished and he lived on. Almost on every occasion when Phra was consciously aware of his identity, he would fall into hibernative state shortly after \"Blodwen\" had perished, and in most of these cases he was not seriously wounded. According to his memoirs, in 410 A.D. he expired from his exertions attempting to save Numidea, in 1072 he inexplicably fell into a coma after having escaped Norman soldiers, in 1366 he accidentally sealed himself in a tomb, coincidentally in Blodwen's old village.\n\nWhat we believe the mysterious figure meant when he told Phra to remember was to remember all of his lives. The mysterious figure was a subconscious hallucination was triggered by the name Ambrose. This name had been used by Phra in the days of his first period when he was awake yet amnesiac, as Ambrosius Aurelius. This was also the name of Merlin as Merlin Ambrosius. The name Ambrosius means immortal. The hooded figure with the shepherd's crook unconsciously reminded Phra of Merlin, and so it was a memory figure of Merlin imposed upon the real form of the local shepherd that gave Phra the advice to remember. If Phra remembered all of his lives, those he was conscious of and those he was not, there was a chance that his accumulated knowledge and experience of the ages could instill in him a stronger character that might be different enough to cloud the tragic consequences of their curse and yet similar enough to remain bound to Blodwen.\n\nPhra's conscious mind did not understand the message his unconscious mind was attempting to tell him or perhaps he understood it too well, and as Phra could not deal with the traumas of Blodwen's deaths he also could not deal with the idea that he had periods of amnesia. His sudden urge to write his memoirs may have been his psychological response to deal with that very notion. Writing his memoirs allowed him to order his memories as he needed them to be and by writing them they became truth.\n\nFinally when Elizabeth Faulkner and he were poisoned, Phra convinced himself he would also die, rather than deal with the trauma of their love and death cycle any longer. So he went into one of his hibernative comas again. When he awoke a few years later, he was again amnesiac. He unconsciously sought Blodwen but could not locate her. His attempts to find her would take him all across the globe, yet he would never find her anywhere on Earth.\n\nAs seen, Phra's manner of dealing with his and Blodwen's cycle of love and death was to essentially be reactive to it and to avoid dealing with the trauma. Blodwen was, however, a more proactive person as seen in how she took charge of Phra's vessel and then took charge of Phra's life when she made him her consort. She also attempted to control their afterlives but was not entirely successful.\n\nBlodwen's cycle of reincarnation contained wakened and unawakened incarnations, when she was aware of being Blodwen and also not aware of being Blodwen. These wakened and unawakened states appear to have coincided with Phra's self knowledge and amnesia. However in most of Blodwen's wakened states she did not realize she was Blodwen reincarnated until she was dying or else she died before she could attempt to change the cycle, as happened in her Isolde Oswaldton identity.\n\nWhen Phra's past lives were unconsciously triggered, so were Elizabeth Faulkner's. Although Phra immediately suppressed any memories that threatened his self-created self-image, Elizabeth did not. She became aware that she was Blodwen, that she was destined to fall in love with Phra, and, if matters progressed as they always had, to die tragically. She resolved to revise her spell, or create a new one that would negate the tragic effects of the original binding spell, or remove the curse that Dhuwallon had placed upon them. Elizabeth Faulkner studied her father's occult and arcane tomes and developed a plan to drastically alter their eternal lives.\n\nIn the novel, Phra and Elizabeth Faulkner drink poisoned wine at their wedding feast. Elizabeth perishes almost immediately. Because of his greater stamina Phra is able to chase after Emanuel Marcena, the suspected poisoner. Phra then seals himself in a hidden chamber inside the Faulkner Mansion and puts the finishing touches on his memoirs before expiring.\n\nA careful reading of the story however demonstrates that although Emanuel Marcena was jealous of the love affair between Phra and Elizabeth, there is only Phra's suspicion that Marcena had poisoned them. Marcena is never seen doing it and never admits to having done so. When Elizabeth falls dead, Phra's face lights upon Marcena's face and knows him to be guilty by his expression, however Marcena's expression could have been one of mere shock and horror. While it is true that he ran when Phra chased him, Phra had come at him screaming and drawing his sword, so Marcena's flight could also be seen as more of a defensive mechanism than one of guilt. Phra chased Marcena up a tower where he jumped to his death. Again, perhaps not a wise decision but not necessarily an admission of guilt. So if Marcena did not poison Phra and Elizabeth, who did? The answer seems to be Elizabeth.\n\nFor her plan to work she needed Phra and herself to die on the same day.\n\nUsing Faulkner's books and her own Druidic sorcery, Elizabeth concocted a spell that would grant her a thousand years of life. We do not know how Elizabeth went about creating her spell, we do not know what sources she used, what materials were involved or the language or wording she used. Given some access to the Faulkner estate and having some knowledge of what books were on hand in Adam Faulkner's library, we can make a few conjectures. Although we personally believe that only two of these are the likeliest explanations, lacking solid evidence we shall merely provide the possibilities that our research has uncovered. Our learned colleagues are free to accept or reject any or all of these theories or postulate their own.\n\nUpon dying she wished that in her next incarnation that she could live as long as Phra even if it took her away from her beloved Britain. Her mind's wish carried her to a world where she lived as long as Phra but was separate from him.\n\nThe poisoned wine killed Blodwen too early. She died before the national crisis for which she had been summoned to this life had arrived (the Spanish Armada). In dying she failed her duty to Britain and lost her ties to the land. Her soul was cast adrift and she was born into the next human female born in the radius of the sun. She thus ended up on another world..\n\nThe spell required that she die in order to be reborn in the correct body. However she had to die at a precise astrological time, but her poisoning threw off her timing and she died when Mars was in ascendancy and so was drawn to the planet most influenced by this sign.\n\nThe spell required that she die in order to be born in the correct body. Marcena did not poison them as Phra had believed but Elizabeth had, knowing he would once again go to sleep and that he would awaken when she did. However she made a mistake in the ritual that caused her to invoke Mars, and so she was drawn to the world under his aegis.\n\nThe spell used ancient Atlantean lore which may have had ties with the Cult of Issus. The spell caused her to be reborn on a world where this cult held full sway..\n\nThe spell used Old One lore and she was drawn to Barsoom for some unknown reason. There is some speculation that the Kaldanes were offshoots or a related species to the Mi-Go. The Plantmen and Sarmak also seem to be related species but as to their connection to the Mi-Go this has yet to be verified.\n\nIn the Faulkner section of the book, Phra mentions having found an Arabic manuscript. Later Edwin Arnold would trace an Arabian carpet as having belonged to the Faulkner estate. It is possible that Elizabeth/Blodwen may have discovered a passage that described how to summon a djinn. He granted her wish for a thousand years of life, but in the cruel method of such wishes he did so in such a fashion that made the wish into a curse. He incarnated her into a race of beings who lived a thousand years naturally but also placed her on another world, millions of miles from the love of her life.(7)\n\nThe end result of her death and her performance of this ritual was that Blodwen was reincarnated on another world, from a red-haired princess she was incarnated in the body of an alien species, a copper-skinned race of humans on the planet Barsoom. She would become known as Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.\n\nFrom 1600 to 1866 Phra's amnesiac personality stabilized and coalesced into a new personality, a strong personality that combined the best elements of Phra's persona. He became psychologically healed in Blodwen's absence. Why was this? Because Blodwen was gone and he did not suffer the trauma of losing her.\n\nEven though he only remembered her on a deep subconscious level, Phra was still compelled to search for her, and he did search for her without finding her.\n\nAfter 1600 Phra no longer lived predominantly in Britain. He experienced a severe wanderlust as his unconscious need to find Blodwen manifested. Although Blodwen did not realize it when she was doing the binding between herself and Phra, the head trauma that Phra had suffered and had caused his death he also unconsciously equated with her. Every time Blodwen manifested and drew his Phra personality out, it also triggered a severe psychological instability.\n\nIt was during those periods when she was unaware of her reincarnation and he was amnesiac that his personality stabilized. The longer he was away from her, the better he became; yet because he kept manifesting as Phra and she would die tragically, he would undergo psychological set backs and the healing process would have to begin anew.\n\nAll the Phra personas prior to 1600 were tied to Britain in a significant way; they did not tend to wander. This is because Blodwen was tied to Britain generally; all her reincarnations happened in Britain. Once Phra became John Carter, he roamed the world since Blodwen had reincarnated as Dejah Thoris, a woman on a far distant world. Unable to find Blodwen in England, John Carter wandered the globe looking for her. The John Carter persona was stable and long-lasting. This was because he had not yet met his Blodwen. All the women John Carter was involved with after Elizabeth Faulkner and prior to Dejah Thoris were not Blodwen. As John Carter he knew love and passion and sometimes wedded contentment, but he did not know the great love that he immediately felt when he saw Dejah Thoris.\n\nBlodwen's reincarnation as Dejah Thoris solved a number of problems for them. It gave Phra enough time to establish the John Carter persona and to learn the mental and spiritual disciplines he needed to maintain his mental stability. Next, since Dejah Thoris is long-livedan immortal of a sortit would take a lot more to kill her, so she wouldn't die of disease, etc. Finally, because John Carter is a tulpa on Barsoom, he can \"die\" but remain John Carter, which he was unable to do as Phraeach time he \"died\" as Phra, he came back with another identity. This ability to \"die\" but live means that Blodwen/Dejah Thoris and Phra/John Carter have found a way around the cycle of love and death that appears to have been the price they had to pay for his immortality and her reincarnations.\n\nIn 1866 when Phra as John Carter lay dying or rather slipping into one of his coma-like states, he knew he had unfinished business and so unconsciously created the tulpa. In the tulpa form he saw a flash of red in the sky, and his life was forever changed.\n\nMy attention was quickly riveted by a large red star close to the distant horizon. As I gazed upon it I felt a spell of overpowering fascinationit was Mars, the god of war, and for me, the fighting man, it had always held the power of irresistible enchantment. As I gazed at it on that far-gone night it seemed to call across the unthinkable void, to lure me to it, to draw me as the lodestone attracts a particle of iron. My longing was beyond the power of opposition. (emphasis added)\n\nThe phrases italicized here seem to support the theory that he was drawn to Blodwen who was reincarnated Dejah Thoris even across the unthinkable void.\n\nBurroughs describes these emotions that John Carter felt as martial ones stirred by the God of War, as exemplified by the sight of the planet Mars. While it is true that John Carter was a warrior, he was not a mindless slaughtering madman with such devotion to war as he seems to display here. Doubtless, the emotions he felt were real, but perhaps a bit of Burroughs was creeping into the narrative. Burroughs was a man who romanticized war until he actually witnessed one. This attraction to war sounds like it comes from someone whom never lived through one.\n\nIf Carter was not talking about war, then what was he talking about? He was naturally talking about Blodwen, his love for Blodwen and his soul binding with her that called him to Barsoom.\n\nWhy suddenly after all of these years?\n\nIt was the flash of red in the night sky! Phra had first noticed Blodwen because of her bright red hair when she was captive of pirates. He had been so immediately enamored of her that he had bought her. Although Phra was buried under the stronger John Carter persona, the red flash may have triggered a buried memory-flash of Blodwen, this and the fact that she was located on this spot of red was enough to draw him to her.\n\nGranted he may have seen Mars plenty of times before this without triggering the Blodwen memory, yet this time he was dying or believed he was dying, and it may be that in his tulpa form he was more receptive to psychic activity and felt the presence of Blodwen through the trackless void of space. Since his physical form was stuck on Earth, his tulpa form was free to fly to her.\n\nJohn Carter landed in the middle of the trackless deserts of the dried up oceans of Barsoom, amidst the haunts of the Green Men. It is probably no coincidence he was placed where he was when he was. He was placed in the exact location where he would meet Dejah Thoris and woo her and win her according to the customs of Barsoom.\n\nIt is unknown if Dejah Thoris realized she was Blodwen from the onset of their relationship but preferred the \"John Carter\" version of Phra or if she, like John Carter, gradually came to know the truth of their undying love.\n\nAlthough their lives together have not been without tumult and near tragedy, their love has remained constant.\n\nIn Gods of Mars, when John Carter discovered Carthoris was his son, his first thought was to inquiry as to the health of Dejah Thoris. Carthoris stated that Dejah Thoris knew with a certainty that John Carter despite having disappeared for ten years (having been returned to his corporeal form when his tulpa died) was not dead and that he would one day return to her. She stated that his first words to anyone who knew of them would be to ask about her. This perhaps is evidence that she knew of their eternal, binding love that brought her back from the arms of death time and time again and that brought him to her arms time and time again, even through the vacuum of space.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. Although many accounts of the Druids are filled with their use of human sacrifice, these source materials are often Roman or Christian who have a biased view. Druids seem only to have carried out human sacrifice against convicted criminals.\n\n2. As shown in the extensively researched in Transcending Death: An Examination of Immortality by Dr. Peter Torres, immortals seem to need to experience death, however minor, before they become immortal. It seems to be part of each of the variant forms of immortality, even though the various forms of immortality seem to be unrelated. Examples besides Phra would be the Highlander type immortals that must experience death before they are quickened and never age beyond their age at death. Vampires, even though they become vampires by various methods, in almost all cases they must die prior to their vampirism being initiated. Although vampires are undead, this can be argued to be a form of immortality. Tarzan's original transformation by the witch-doctor was unpleasant and may have brought him closer to death than Burroughs reported. Flint the Immortal fell in battle with a spear in his heart and he became immortal. Novelist Alfred Bester recognized this phenomenon and in his novel The Computer Connection, which is set in a fictional future, used some very real immortals as characters, although effectively disguised. His immortals were connected to one another through their shared experiences. Each suffered a tragic situation that should have killed them. One of Bester's characters Ned Curzon had a hobby of attempting to grant worthy individuals the gift of immortality. To do this he arranged for the worthy candidates to experience painful and tormented deaths. In almost every case Curzon's attempts however were failures.\n\n3. An extreme example of the connection between the land and the king can be seen in the Arthurian legends, most dramatically in the motif of the wasteland, as in the film Excalibur where the land becomes sick and wasted because the king is sick and wasted.\n\n4. In Welsh mythology, Gwydion is the uncle (and by some accounts also the father) of Dylan, who is a sea god and the Spirit of Darkness, and of Llew Llaw, the Spirit of Light. Gwydion is a mighty wizard, able to change shapes at will, and a bard with wonderful ability to recite poetry and ancient lore. His most famous magical exploit was to turn a pile of fungus into twelve greyhounds, twelve stallions, and twelve golden shieldstemporarilywhich he swaps for wonderful new creatures called swine, just arrived from the underworld. This trickery starts a big war and gets Gwydion in trouble with his uncle Math, who is an even more powerful wizard. Later Gwydion makes many trips to the underworld to retrieve creatures for the benefit of humanity: the deer, the dog, and the lapwing. Gwydion is the druid of the gods, which presumably means he looks after their trees. He is hostile to the niggardly gods of the underworld who hoard Fertility, which they keep buried under the earth until he, as beneficent trickster, uses his warm sunrays to free it. He is credited with originating April Fool's Day when, on the first day of April, he conjured up magical armies to trick his sister Arianrhod. Gwydion had links to the underworld, and the route taken by the deads' souls was named Caer Gwydion, now called the Milky Way. Gwydion told Math of Arianrhod's imposition upon Lleu, and together they contrived to make a woman from flower blossoms, called Blodeuedd. She committed adultery and planned to murder her husband, Lleu. At the moment when Lleu was struck, he turned into an eagle and flew off. Gwydion tracked him down and found him starving in a forest treetop. Gwydion nursed his nephew back to health and avenged Lleu by converting Blodeuedd into an owl. The coincidence of the similarity of Blodwen's name to Blodeudd's may have prompted Gwydion to mischievously curse her reincarnations.\n\n5. This account differs from the original tale edited by Edwin Arnold and published as The Wonderful Adventures of Phra the Phoenician. In the novel Phra's ship founders and he swims to shore, coincidentally landing on shore at the place where he landed some thousand years before. Seeking shelter in a tomb that closed behind him, he fell into one of his sleeps. For the explanation for this discrepancy, please see John Carter: Torn From Phoenician Dreams or The Lives and Times of John Carter by Power and Coogan.\n\nSELECT SOURCES\n\nBurroughs, Edgar Rice, A Princess of Mars. 1912.

As always, Dr. Bollmann's work was superb. I do, however, think it did not go far enough. So I have taken it on myself to further research the situation, and have come across certain data that, I feel, will further expand and explain the events behind Dr. Bollmann's research.\n\nI do not wish, by doing this, to imply that my colleague Dr. Bollmann's research was in any way inferior or slapdash. Having read almost all of his work over the years, I can honestly say that Bollmann's work is, and always has been, thorough, painstaking, and, to the best of his knowledge, complete. BUT--even professors of Wold-Newtonianism are human: there are sources they either do not know of, cannot access, or, simply, cannot believe. This is little wonder--in a world where, as we are discovering, the square-cube law can be occasionally overturned, giant apes roam the jungles, and small alien invasions seem to happen every week, some stories that are said to have occurred to our sources of study often seem to have no other course than be completely fictitious.\n\nAnd, indeed, some are. But, as Dr. Bollmann's work shows, even a silly 1970s cartoon such as POPEYE AND THE MAN WHO HATED LAUGHTER had its germ in a very dangerous situation almost forty years before. He simply didnt go far enough in his research. Based on his notes, which he kindly lent to me, however, I feel that I not only can further explain some puzzling discrepancies in his paper, but also, if not pinpoint an actual year of occurrence, then at least roughly show WHEN the actions of the true events take place.\n\nFurthermore, through sources I am not allowed to disclose, I intend to show that the animated series DEFENDERS OF THE EARTH had--or rather has--its origin in this time, but, unlike Dr. Bollmann's apparent belief, MIGHT ACTUALLY OCCUR. For those who doubt any man can predict the future, I refer you to the work of Dr. Jess Nevins, and his statements of the future lives of the entity known only as Mr. Am. It IS possible. Whether or not it WILL occur, with the constant flux between alternate futures, is, however, another story.\n\nBut to the subject at hand. As mentioned in his article, the true story behind the Defenders of the Earth got its start with the hijacking of the ocean liner the Hilary by the mysterious Dr. Morbid Grimsley. On this ship were various people, many of which would, incredibly, find semi-fictitious comic strips built around their lives at one time or another.\n\nOne might think that, due to the very nature of these guests--inspirations for comic strips--that there was some sort of reunion going on. But there is no evidence that these people knew about each other or even met while on the liner--if they did, they certainly would have some things to talk about! Besides, there were literally hundreds of passengers on the ship at the time; to have them all encounter one another would be unlikely. It seems to have been a case of amazing coincidence; just as the presence of such luminaries as Sherlock Holmes, a young Indiana Jones, and, if research is right, the alien time-traveler known only as the Doctor on the Titanic at the same time was. Still, let us review these special passengers:\n\n1). KING KLINE II OF ID, better known as the Little King. Although forgotten today, in the 1930s King Kline was considered a beloved character in America, which, despite its democracy, has always been fascinated by royalty. Although his kingdom, Id (1), was of almost no importance at the time (and eventually was subsumed into Yugoslavia, if I recall correctly), King Kline, a deeply eccentric man, was nonetheless beloved for his kindness and generosity--as well as his odd whimsy and childlikeness. He was known, for example, to wash the dishes in the swimming pool when the Royal Dishwasher quit. According to Dr. Bollmann, it was believed by the Italians that the Royal Family of Id owned the Spear of Destiny, purportedly the spear that pierced Christs side during the Crucifixion. They didnt.\n\n2) CONNER BRIGGS, or Jiggs to give him his more well-known moniker. A self-made millionaire, Briggs was an important figure in Irish-American communities. He also possessed a VERY social-climbing wife, Maggie, while he himself never forgot where he came from, preferring to eat corn beef and cabbage to caviar and seeing his old friends at the pub. A friend, George McManus, heard about his frequent attempts at sneaking out and created a comic strip about him, Bringing Up Father, in 1913. Briggs was not amused. Neither was Maggie.\n\n3) SNUFFY SMITH, a crude, uneducated backwoodsman from Tennessee, yet an acquaintance of famous race-horse owner Barney Google. Having won the cruise in a sweepstakes, Smith and his wife Louisa--along with Barney Google--were making their first cruise (2).\n\n4) DAGWOOD AND BLONDIE BUMSTEAD--the couple Chic Young made famous in 1930. (3).\n\n5) GEORGE AND GRACIE ALLEN--the world-famous entertainers. Little needs to be said about these two. Dr. Bollmann also mentions that Gracie had a cousin along who would inspire the legend of Sad Sack.\n\n6) POPEYE--in point of fact the most important person ON that ship, although you would never know it from the appearance of the plug-ugly sailor. Popeyes presence, as well as the truth of his mysterious relationship with the mystery-man known only as the Shadow, will be dealt with later in this article.\n\n7) THE KATZENJAMMER KIDS--Hans and Fritz; Dr. Bollmann says these are the sons of the original Fritz Katzenjammer, whom Rudolph Dirks wrote about starting in 1897. More about these two later.\n\nOh, yes--some sources indicate the presence of New York millionaire LAMONT CRANSTON on board as well, but as he apparently spent the entire experience seasick in his cabin, we can write him off as having any effect on the events whatsoever.\n\nAccording to the original story, once the Hilary, had been hijacked, a group consisting of adventurers Mandrake the Magician, the Phantom, Flash Gordon, Steve Canyon, and young Tim Tyler set out to rescue them. Dr. Bollmann's researches claim that, while Mandrake, Flash, and the Phantom were indeed involved, the presence of Canyon and Tyler were fictitious. Their parts were, in fact, played out by adventurers Terry Lee and Pat Ryan. I agree--to an extent. While Steve Canyon was indeed NOT part of the team, he was not, as Bollmann states, totally fictitious. There was a real Steve Canyon. BUT--as any historian of comic strips know, Canyons exploits werent recorded until 1947--far AFTER the events of the Hilary. Canyon wasnt there simply because he hadnt started adventuring yet! He was alive, of course, but nowhere near the Atlantic when these events took place.\n\nTim Tyler, however, poses a problem. Although at first I agreed with Dr. Bollmann's assertion that Tyler was totally fictional, the more I researched the more I realized something was amiss with the witnesses recollections of events. As I looked into the situation, I began to realize that the descriptions of the boy involved in the rescue--believed to be Terry Lee--did not quite match up all the time, although they were very similar. And there were occasional reports of a dark-haired youth--not adult, as Pat Ryan was--who was seen with one of the varied descriptions. This would tally with the identity of Spud, Tylers dark-haired companion, who was only a few years older than he. But Bollmann was correct--FDR recruited Pat Ryan into the fold (Terry came WITH him; FDR wasnt enthused about putting a boy in danger), not Tim Tyler. So what was I to make of this?\n\nWith further research, I have come to a theory--BOTH Lee and Tyler were involved with events. Due to the similarity of their ages and blond hair, witnesses mixed the two up--especially plausible when you consider two of them were the daffy Gracie Allen and Dagwood Bumstead. But how was this possible? I feel that it all comes down to the timing of the events--but first, there are a few other things to deal with.\n\nTo begin with, we must discuss the activities and involvement of Mandrake, the Phantom, and Flash Gordon. According to Dr. Bollmann, Flash had returned to Earth from the Rogue Planet crisis, and, it is intimated, was involved in the downplaying of events into belief they were a hoax. But further recorded\n\nexploits of Flash, if they are to be believed, show him remaining on Mongo. How do we reconcile this?\n\nIt is my belief that Flash DID, temporarily, return to Earth after the first overthrow of Ming--to marry Dale Arden officially in the beliefs of her own church. According to rumor, the famed adventurer Jungle Jim Bradley even witnessed this event, although I have yet to confirm it. (4) Apparently, Zarkovs rocket was able to make more than one trip back and forth to Mongo while the planets were in relative range of each other; afterwards, Flash probably made his home on Mongo. More research needs to be done on this, however.\n\nDr. Bollmann also states that Mandrake had, at one time, been posing as another jungle explorer, Congo Bill, and it was at this time, during an adventure with the 19th Phantom, that he met his partner Lothar. This is so--but not the intimation that there was no real Congo Bill. The actual Bill had returned temporarily to the States, letting Mandrake pose as him for whatever reasons were actually behind the imposture. Dr. Bollmann states the stories of Congorilla, which came much later when Bills adventures had become totally fictional, were based off this exploit. I see no reason to doubt this, much as I love the idea of a magic ring that transfers a human mind into a gorilla body (5).\n\nIt was this encounter that lead, through a statement of Roosevelt, for this group to dub themselves, facetiously, The Defenders of the Earth. In fact, they liked it so much most of them (Lee and Ryan bowing out) decided to keep in contact over the years, to see if they could assist each other in their cases if necessary. Flash, of course, returned to Mongo by all reports, and was lost to them for many years. But--as my sources indicate--Mandrake and the Phantom(s) kept in touch over the years. Did they have any other adventures as a team during that time? Were there other adventures of the Defenders of the Earth? We know that Mandrake and the Phantom often teamed together when\n\nnecessary. Perhaps there was a whole slew of adventures of the Defenders that were never recorded--Americas version of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. We will never know.\n\nBut, this is where the Future Defenders of the Earth come in. If my sources are correct, sometime about 2015, a descendent of the original Flash will return to Earth with his son , Rick (6), and warn that Ming--possibly the original, possibly a descendant--is returning. The Phantom active then--who\n\nMUST be the father of the 2040 Phantom--will then team up with Mandrake and Lothar (who have kept themselves young through Mandrakes mysticism; what happened to the magicians wife Narda is unknown) and the Gordons to stop him. Amazingly, however, two others will be there--Lothars son, L.J., and Jedda, the daughter of the Phantom (7)!\n\nBut we know from other sources that the Phantoms son will take over the role, in 2040! We can only presume that, on the birth of the new Kit Walker, Jeddas claim to future Phantomdom went out the window. Or, possibly, she died, as she was never mentioned in the recorded (to be recorded?) exploits of the 2040 Phantom. We shall never know.\n\nAt any rate, we must return to the 1930s, and the hijacking of the Hilary. As said before, the famed Popeye the Sailor was on hand for the adventure--and, if records are correct, his arch-enemy Brutus was working with Grimsley to steal the boat! But theres a problem here--readers of Popeyes recorded adventures will know that Brutus was never named Brutus--he was originally named Bluto, and had, in fact, only shown up in one adventure of Popeye! It was not until he was adopted for the cartoon series--totally fictional--as the regular villain that he entered the public eye--and he was never called Brutus until the 1960s (8).\n\nThe true story, of course, is that Blutos hiring as a thug by Grimsley was a total coincidence. But we can imagine Bluto was more than happy to launch in once he found out his old enemy was on the ship. It just worked out in that funny way things in the Wold-Newton Universe seem to do.\n\nAnother oddity about the story is that Mandrake apparently summoned up a hypnotic illusion of the legendary Prince Valiant to fight Bluto. This seems to have been based on a real event (9). Bluto was apparently threatening some of the hostages with a sword (why he didnt have a gun is unclear) and\n\nMandrake, feeling amused, hypnotized him into thinking Prince Valiant was there to keep him busy in a duel while he moved the hostages to safety.\n\nAnd a quick word on Popeyes relations with the Shadow--my sources tell me that the sailor man was NOT a full-time agent, but rather a courier used when the situation demanded it. The rough-and-tumble Popeye was simply too argumentative and aggressive to make a good agent; the Shadow used him mainly as a paid message-deliverer. But he got the job done, so the Shadow kept him\n\non as an occasional. The rest of the time, like Lee and Ryan, he was a free agent. Popeye may never have known who he was working for; as long as the money was good, he was good for it.\n\nBut of course Grimsley couldnt have just up and hijacked an entire ship by his lonesome. And the truth was, he didnt. That was where the Katzenjammers came in.\n\nFor Im sorry to say that Hans and Fritz were completely and totally committed National Socialists; they were being used as spies in America and were the ones operating as Grimsleys agents on board the Hilary. To cover their tracks, they pretended to be captives along with the others and apparently got away with it, but their true purpose was to help Grimsley grab the object of his quest. Poor Mama! Even the original Hans and Fritz werent THAT bad. Later, it seems, a shadowy member of the Defenders did, indeed, learn the truth and, according to the report, there wasnt much left to do autopsies on.\n\nAnd the object of the game? Dr. Bollmann states it was a green railroad lantern. If this hint is what Im thinking it is, I am afraid Bollmann is slightly incorrect. If Im right, then this item was in fact a CHINESE\n\nlantern; it would not be shaped into a railroad lantern until much later. But that is for another article. It seems unlikely the Nazis would go to so much trouble and expense to kidnap an entire boat just for the sake of some lantern--surely it would have been easier for the Katzenjammers just to steal it--but Grimsley intended to hold as many of the hostages for ransom as he could, just to earn a little extra pocket change. The Little King, and possibly Jiggs, would have been either killed or taken to Germany for political gain. Burns and Allen, of course, as famous entertainers, could have been held for ransom (although Burns Jewishness may have ended up costing him his life if the Defenders hadnt involved themselves), and possibly even the Bumsteads could, technically, be held for ransom once Grimsley discovered who they were. Whether or not Dagwoods father would actually have paid to free\n\nhis disowned son and despised daughter-in-law is another story. As for the rest of the hostages, not famous and just plain folk as most of them such as Smith were--well, perhaps were better off not knowing what the plans were. Rumor has it that the Miskatonic-taught Grimsley was in touch with more than just the Nazis .\n\nAnd so we come to the end--the actual time all this took place. Once again, while I cannot pinpoint an exact date, I feel I can come very close to a year, based off these simple dating records:\n\nThe Phantoms recorded adventures began in 1936, Mandrakes in 1934. Flash Gordons recorded exploits also began being published in 1934. The adventures of Terry Lee and Pat Ryan began to be published in October, 1934.\n\nThe adventures of Tim Tyler began being recorded in 1928. BUT--in 1932, he and Spud moved to Africa, where they became members of something called The Ivory Patrol, a jungle policing group. The Phantom, on the other hand, was in charge of something called The Jungle Patrol which had much the same function. Ivory Patrol. Jungle Patrol. Were they the same organization, just disguised? Did the Phantom witness one of Tylers African adventures and recommend him for his own organization? While at first I debated about Tyler and his companion acting as stowaways, the timing I have come up with doesnt work. So my theory is that Tyler and Spud were on the Hilary, possibly on assignment, more probably on a short vacation (as the ship was moving from Europe to America, rather than Africa). Knowing two of his officers were on the ship being held hostage would certainly have been incentive for the Phantom to get involved, even beyond his familys vow to fight piracy of all sorts.\n\nA further clue comes from the marriage of Blondie Boopadoop and Dagwood Bumstead--recorded on February 17, 1933. While this probably wasnt the actual date, it gives up a rough idea of when the marriage did take place--in the early years of the 1930s. And it is well-known Bumstead was the son of a millionaire cut off without a cent due to his marriage to Blondie. But wouldnt Bumstead have still had a little money on him--after all, they did move into rather a nice house and have two kids later. I think this trip was actually the Bumsteads honeymoon rather than a vacation; they were blowing what little they had to stick it to Dagwoods daddy.(10)\n\nSo what does that leave us with? 1936, 1934, 1934, 1934, 1932, and 1933. And, of course, both Hitler and Roosevelt were elected to the various leaderships of their countries in 1933--a good, round average of the years mentioned above. It certainly couldnt have taken any time sooner. So I am\n\ngoing to state that the true events of Popeye and the Man Who Hated Laughter probably happened at the earliest in the year 1933. It certainly couldnt have happened any later than 1936. That leaves us, then, with a three-year period, 1933-36, in which these events, and the founding of the Defenders of the Earth, could have taken place. Perhaps further research will specify an exact date.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\n1). Try as I might, I cannot find any kingdom in any atlas from the time known as Id. According to Dr. Bollmann, this is the same country that comic historian Johnny Hart writes about in his comic strip The Wizard of Id--albeit this original King Kline, a tyrant, lived sometime during the Middle Ages. I suspect that Id is NOT the countrys real name, and whatever it was has now been lost in the mist of history.\n\n2). Barney, according to Dr. Bollmann, mysteriously disappeared en route to the ship. For those with a nasty, conspiratorial state of mind, be assured that Google had just wandered away into a crap game and missed the boat.\n\n3). I have been unable to verify Dr. Bollmann's claims that Blondie Boopadoops cousin is Betty Boop. Seeing as how it is very unlikely that Blondie would actually have had such a ridiculous surname; I suspect her real last name was more foreign and Young simply altered it into a similar-sounding name that emphasized her personality. If Betty and Blondie ARE cousins, however, and the cartoons based on her are even half-true, Betty may have met Popeye herself at one point--see the cartoon Popeye the Sailor Man for details (the rest of the Popeye cartoons are, however, as we noted above, totally fictitious).\n\n4). The Flash Gordon radio show apparently led into the Jungle Jim radio show when Jim attended Flashs wedding on Earth.\n\n5). Possibly the events of The Whispering Gorilla and its sequel, where a mans brain was placed into a gorillas body, may have also inspired these tales. Hey--at least it wasnt Bwana Beast.\n\n6). According to the cartoon based on these sources, Dale Arden was killed and turned into a computerized artificial intelligence. This is untrue. This Flash had married a native Mongoite, who was Ricks mother. It was SHE who became the computer that advised the Defenders.\n\n7). Mandrake, too, had a young apprentice, but he was not related, serving as the boys guardian.\n\n8). Much later he returned to the comic strip, but by then it was mostly a gag-a-day thing instead of continuity adventure. I view these reports of Popeyes activities as mainly fictitious.\n\n9). It is a manner of keen disagreement whether Prince Valiant was an actual living person or not in the Wold-Newton Universe. Research has shown, however, that there was obviously someone who inspired the legend; whether or not all the adventures ascribed to him are true or not is another story.\n\n10). It should be noted that, despite appearances in the comic strip and movies (and television programs) based on his activities, Dagwood Bumstead wasnt QUITE the dunderhead presented. He certainly was not the brightest bulb in the light store, to be sure, but if even half of some of the work incidents portrayed in the comics were true--especially falling asleep on the job--Bumstead would have been fired (especially working for a man like J.C. Dithers, who did indeed tend to get into fistfights with his employees). Bumstead, for all his stupidity in other matters, actually did possess a decent head for figures, and was able to support his wife and two children fairly comfortably for years. Chic Young simply took a few funny incidents that had happened early in Bumsteads adjustment to the working world and created endless variations on the theme for years. And since Blondie is still going quite strong based on them, who are we to argue with success?\n\nSOURCES\n\n1). Bollmann, Art. The True Story Behind the Defenders of the Earth.\n\n2).

Power and Dr. Peter Coogan\n\nPart Four in a series of articles by Coogan and Power about the life and influences of John Carter\n\nOur story begins with Edwin Arnold. Circa 1890 Edwin Arnold came into the possession of Phra the Phoenician's manuscript. Despite a diligent search of the Faulkner mansion however, not a trace of Phra's body could be found. Arnold realized that there was more of Phra's story to be told. Not knowing of Phra's periods of amnesia, (1) Arnold believed that Phra awoke aware of his identity and made use of his status as heir to the Faulkner estate.\n\nArnold made inquires about the sale of items from the Faulkner estate, but this turned up little information A decade later, however, some new evidence came to light, and it was made known to him that several of the items from the Faulkner estate had been sold in New York. Some of these items were of Middle Eastern origin; knowing of Phra's Phoenician antecedents, Arnold was intuitively certain that Phra was connected to these items. Using his father's diplomatic connections, Arnold discovered that a man answering to Phra's description had purchased a home on the Hudson in 1878. In 1900 the estate was owned by a young Virginian who knew nothing about Phra and was rather reticent to talk about the original owner of the estate, his uncle, who had passed away in 1886.\n\nWhile in New York Arnold began investigating his other lead, the provenance of the Middle Eastern items sold by the Faulkner estate. He found a merchant in New York who had possessed the rug previously owned by the Faulkner estate. The merchant had bought it in 1880. It was sold to an elderly man in 1881. The rug merchant then heard that a colleague of his had purchased a rug with the same design in 1899. Arnold visited the merchant who had bought the rug in 1899. He remembered the transaction very well. He had bought this rug from a young man with a haunted look who had spun him a fantastic yarn of its origins. The merchant had paid top dollar for the unique rug, but the rug had disappeared off of his shelves several days later. The rug merchant recounted to Arnold the tale that the young man had told him, that the rug had carried him to the planet Mars, that he had found a decadent race of white people who were preyed upon by savage beasts and copper skinned warlike men. The white people worshiped the goddess Isis and traveled down river to the land of the dead. After a fantastic battle when all seemed lost, the rug had magically returned him to Earth. The merchant also stated he had felt sorry for the young man because not only did he seem out of sorts but also looked down on his luck. When the rug disappeared, the merchant tried to contact the man who had sold him the rug; the merchant had wisely had insisted upon a receipt. The man was an officer in the United States Marines. The Marines told the merchant that Ulysses Pierpont was no longer an officer in the Marines but refused to divulge any more information. (2)\n\nUsing his father's diplomatic contacts, Edwin Arnold was able to discover more about Ulysses Pierpont. He was related to the Pierponts of Virginia, he had been a medical officer in the Marines and had disappeared in 1895 while on leave in New York. Pierpont had been court-martialed for going Absent Without Leave in 1899. The Marine Corps contact even allowed Edwin Arnold read a copy of Ulysses Pierpont's statement of defense. The military prosecutor argued that Ulysses Pierpont had fallen victim to dipsomania and that his tale of travel to Mars was a fantasy that attempted to use the events of the so-called War of the Worlds as a smokescreen to cover his actions. The prosecutor's charge of dipsomania had been made because Ulysses had been arrested for public drunkenness in New York City and his identity as a military deserter had been established.\n\nEdwin Arnold took copious notes, but a military censor had crossed out quite a bit of his material. Arnold still remained uncertain however if this man was Phra.\n\nEdwin Arnold was disappointed that he had not found Phra, but he used the material he had gathered on this trip to write another book.\n\nEdwin Arnold used the tale of the Ulysses' trip to Mars from the court-martial statement and corroborated by the tale Arnold had heard from the rug merchant as the basis of his new novel. To fill the void, Arnold borrowed from H.G. Wells (3). Because his protagonist was supposedly a living person, he chose a different name for the character. Since Ulysses had been a sailor who had traveled to many exotic lands and encountered exotic animals and strange beings, Arnold wanted a name that would evoke that same spirit; he chose Gullivar because Lemuel Gulliver had also been a sailor who had sailed to exotic lands and encountered exotic animals and strange beings. Lemuel Gulliver was also a surgeon as Ulysses Pierpont was supposed to be. (4)\n\nAs Arnold was writing Gullivar of Mars, he became suddenly convinced that Pierpont, the mysterious man in the Hudson River estate, which was not far from NYC, and Phra were all the same person. Arnold once again visited M.N. Carter and alluded that he \"knew\" his uncle had traveled to Mars.\n\nCarter's nephew was more amused than shocked at Arnold's exclamation and insisted on comparing stories, with Arnold going first. Arnold told him what little sense he could make out of the merchant's story and the court-martial testimony of Ulysses Pierpont.\n\nArnold was careful not to reveal the true name of the naval officer but rather called him Gullivar like his character to disguise his true name. Arnold's tale told how the young officer accidentally acquired a magic carpet and wished himself to Mars. Once on Mars he landed inside a city near a great sea where the citizens had fair skin and fair hair. Arnold's account related how the fair skinned people whom he called the Hither people lived lives of hedonistic pleasure, immersing themselves in deep philosophy and also giving themselves over to narcotic oblivion and sexual excess. Yet they managed to produce gold, grain, and a rare type of silk. Since the Thither people would rather die than fight, they were \"taxed\" by a group of copper-skinned barbarians whom Arnold called the Thither folk. Among their yearly tribute was a maiden that was to be given to the Thither king. The young Earthman became infatuated with Heru, whom he knew was to be this year's tribute.\n\nPart of Heru's function as the chosen maiden was to gaze into a crystal ball and see the future for the upcoming year. This crystal ball was in a temple in the center of the city, surrounded by a circular representation of the solar system. One of the Gullivar's companions told him that the result of the prediction was invariably the same. However this time it began with a view of Mars as if seen from above the planet. It showed a sphere that grew red and finally engulfed the entire crystal in a great red light that seemed to give off a great heat. Feeling that Heru was in danger Gullivar jumped to her rescue, and in doing so knocked the crystal ball from its pedestal. (5)\n\n\"Gullivar\" spent some time learning the religious aspect of the Martians who worshipped a goddess Arnold called Isis. Gullivar also became seduced into participating in the hedonistic pleasures of the Hither society. When the time came for Heru to be taken by the Thither king, Gullivar attempted to stop the abduction. He was overwhelmed by the Thither men and knocked unconscious. He awoke set adrift on the River of Death in a sacrificial barge.\n\nThe young man used the silken wrappings on his barge to lasso a swimming stag and was towed to shore. He took cover in a forest but had his sleep disturbed by giant bats swooping down into the forest to mate and feed. (6) Shortly thereafter he saw two rats as large as elephants fight and watched the victor devour his victim.\n\nHe traveled down river seeking to find the home of the Thither men, getting directions and supplies from islands along his way. He saw many strange fauna and flora such as a honey producing flower, a plant that resembled a human being, and a plant that produced huge boat-shaped gourds, which were the primary vessels for the island people.\n\nFrom the River of Death Gullivar entered a polar sea, where all the vessels of the dead eventually drifted. Gullivar found a frozen wasteland where thousands upon thousands of corpses were preserved by the cold. Among these were a well preserved older man with a golden crown and a jaw piece also made of gold. Gullivar took the golden crown, believing he might need to exchange it for currency. The barren plain abruptly ended in a towering mountain range. The polar sea butted up against this huge range of mountains. The sea entered the mountains through a chasm, which Gullivar barely avoided being drawn into. In this cold wasteland he met an old man who set him on the correct path to the Thither kingdom, which he was able to reach by circumventing the mountain range.\n\nGullivar traveled out of the frozen wasteland and into a more temperate region. Once again he encountered several odd animals and plants, including one plant that could drain the blood from a small ape in a manner of moments.\n\nPassing through several smaller river towns, tributaries of the River of Death and through an area where the forests were thick as night, he encountered a ruined Hither city. This he had been told was the ruined city of Queen Yang who had killed herself and a thousand babies when the Thither took the land. The ruins were supposed to be haunted by the spirits of the dead. Finding the skeleton of Queen Yang, Gullivar took her circlet with him, believing that Heru had the right to wear the Queen's crown.\n\nGullivar arrived at a Thither canal city and discovered that the soldiers escorting Heru had recently passed through and were on their way to the capital. Gullivar followed quickly after her. He described how the temperature was rising, which the Martians claimed was unusual. A second sun was appearing in the sky. Arnold speculated that Mars had somehow captured an asteroid in its orbit and the large body was circling the planet in a decaying orbit, bringing heat and climatic changes.\n\nGullivar arranged to get an audience with Ar-Hap the King of Thither. According to Arnold, Gullivar was seen to have died by Ar-Hap and his soldiers, and so his presence there was thought to be that of Gullivar's spirit. Ar-Hap gave to Gullivar the task of going to the frozen north, finding the crown of a frozen king and returning in five minutes. As luck, fate or sheer coincidence would have it Gullivar had taken this golden circlet from the head of the frozen king earlier. Ar-Hap was stunned at the presentation of the king's crown and ordered Gullivar to also travel to the city of Queen Yang, take some of her treasure and return in five minutes in order to get the girl. Gullivar successfully won this game. However Ar-Pad would not allow Gullivar to leave until Gullivar had prayed away the comet.\n\nThe falling asteroid caused a horrific droughts, which brought every sort of animal out of the woods, sleek panthers with lolling tongues; russet-red wood dogs; bears and sloths from the dark arcades of the remote forests, . mighty boars, who came from the river marshes Even the wolves came off the hills apes sat sad and listless, and on the roof-ridges storks were dying the toucans and Martian parrots hung limp and fashionless..\n\nThe drought passed after the asteroid landed. Torrential rains followed the drought. Gullivar took advantage of the debilitated condition of the Thither to rescue Heru. She and he traveled back to the Hither city.\n\nShortly after their return, Ar-Pad surrounded the city and sacked it. In the melee, Gullivar was separated from Heru. Although he fought valiantly against the Thither, Gullivar's strength eventually flagged and he took refuge in a building and barricaded himself inside. When all seemed lost, he found the magic carpet curled up in a corner. He wished himself back in New York.\n\nAlthough Matthew Carter initially displayed skepticism and no interest in Arnold's inquiries, once Arnold had given out his tale, Carter believed he could discuss John Carter's story with Arnold freely, especially once Arnold explained about Phra. Given this information Carter gladly shared John Carter's story with Arnold because he felt safe in doing so given that Arnold already knew about Barsoom and Arnold was able to add to Matthew Carter's knowledge of Barsoom.\n\nSo Matthew Carter shared John Carter's story with Arnold, which was one reason why Gullivar Of Mars ended up with so many parallels with The Gods of Mars.\n\nCarter's nephew toldArnold that John Carter had traveled to Mars in an astral body not a magic carpet, and that, except for human beings, Martian wildlife bore little resemblance to Earth animals. There was a river of death and a goddess Issus that John Carter had encountered, but many of the incidents and the flora and fauna mentioned were not in John Carter's account. Arnold coldly thanked Carter's nephew for his time, certain the man was playing a prank.\n\nArnold had by then written out the basic elements of Gullivar's story and was reluctant to rewrite the entire tale. He was also rather disappointed that that the ecology of Mars and the actual customs and culture of Mars did not denote the higher elements of human behavior. Matthew Carter told Arnold that he had been fitfully editing the manuscripts of John Carter with the intent of publishing them. Carter's ambition was to be a writer although he admitted to not having the patience to learn grammatical mechanics or the necessary discipline to keep at one project with any regularity. This information solidified Arnolds conviction to publish his account of Ulysses Pierponts voyage to Mars as fiction. He remained uncertain if Phra was Ulysses Pierpont or John Carter, although he leaned towards the latter. As a nod to this belief he used some of the elements of John Carters experiences in the Valley Dor and its nearby environs as shadings of Gullivars trip.\n\nArnold finished writing his Martian novel. He chose the name Gullivar Jones for his main character, Gullivar for the correspondences mentioned above and Jones because it was a generic everyman type name. His researches into the background of Pierpont had discovered that a Jones family was also related to the Pierponts. It was also a tweak at John Carter's nephew, since Jones means \"Son of John.\" (7) After finishing Gullivar of Mars Arnold discontinued his search for Phra and returned to his writing career. His novels became less filled with adventure elements and to some reviewers less interesting.\n\nIn 1925 Edgar Rice Burroughs received a letter from a man named Ulysses Paxton who like John Carter transported to Mars at the moment of death. His version was as follows.\n\nIt was in the Fall of nineteen seventeen at an officers' training camp\n\nthat I first became acquainted with John Carter, War Lord of Barsoom,\n\nthrough the pages of your novel \"A Princess of Mars.\" The story made a\n\nprofound impression upon me and while my better judgment assured me\n\nthat it was but a highly imaginative piece of fiction, a suggestion of\n\nthe verity of it pervaded my inner consciousness to such an extent that\n\nI found myself dreaming of Mars and John Carter, of Dejah Thoris, of\n\nTars Tarkas and of Woola as if they had been entities of my own\n\nexperience rather than the figments of your imagination.\n\nIt is true that in those days of strenuous preparation there was little\n\ntime for dreaming, yet there were brief moments before sleep claimed me\n\nat night and these were my dreams. Such dreams! Always of Mars, and\n\nduring my waking hours at night my eyes always sought out the Red\n\nPlanet when he was above the horizon and clung there seeking a solution\n\nof the seemingly unfathomable riddle he has presented to the Earthman\n\nfor ages.\n\nPerhaps the thing became an obsession. I know it clung to me all during\n\nmy training camp days, and at night, on the deck of the transport, I\n\nwould be on my back gazing up into the red eye of the god of battle--\n\nmy god--and wishing that, like John Carter, I might be drawn across\n\nthe great void to the haven of my desire.\n\nLater as Paxton was in the trenches, his position was shelled. Paxton's men were wiped out and he was severely injured.\n\nOne look was enough, I sank back in an agony of mental and physical\n\nanguish--my legs had been blown away from midway between the hips and\n\nknees. For some reason I was not bleeding excessively, yet I know that\n\nI had lost a great deal of blood and that I was gradually losing enough\n\nto put me out of my misery in a short time if I were not soon found;\n\nand as I lay there on my back, tortured with pain, I prayed that they\n\nwould not come in time, for I shrank more from the thought of going\n\nmaimed through life than I shrank from the thought of death.\n\nThen my eyes suddenly focused upon the bright red eye of Mars and\n\nthere surged through me a sudden wave of hope. I stretched out my arms\n\ntowards Mars, I did not seem to question or to doubt for an instant as\n\nI prayed to the god of my vocation to reach forth and succor me. I\n\nknew that he would do it, my faith was complete, and yet so great was\n\nthe mental effort that I made to throw off the hideous bonds of my\n\nmutilated flesh that I felt a momentary qualm of nausea and then a\n\nsharp click as of the snapping of a steel wire, and suddenly I stood\n\nnaked upon two good legs looking down upon the bloody, distorted thing\n\nthat had been I. Just for an instant did I stand thus before I turned\n\nmy eyes aloft again to my star of destiny and with outstretched arms\n\nstand there in the cold of that French night--waiting.\n\nSuddenly I felt myself drawn with the speed of thought through the\n\ntrackless wastes of interplanetary space. There was an instant of\n\nextreme cold and utter darkness (8)\n\nHe arrived on Barsoom whole and hale and almost immediately stopped an old man from being bludgeoned to death. The old man was Ras Thavas, the greatest surgeon and scientist on Barsoom. Thavas trained Paxton, who rapidly learned Barsoomian and also in a matter of months learned to be a surgeon with greater skills than most surgeons on Earth possessed at this time.\n\nYou may be wondering how we arrived at the title of this piece. Given that John Carter, as shown in Power and Coogan's \"John Carter: Torn from Phoenician Dreams\" and \"The Lives and Times of John Carter,\" had studied mental disciplines for years to ach"
