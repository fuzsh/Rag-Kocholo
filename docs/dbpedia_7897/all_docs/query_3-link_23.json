        "text": "By Phillip E. Wegner\n\nWhether articulated as potentially genuine beings who can be looked at from any side or as more limited, two-dimensional visual figures, comic characters are presented as occupying spatial and temporal locations distinct from other such characters and belonging to an underlying world that exists independent of the panels in which the characters appear –an alternative universe whose “real” dimension seems to depend on events that have been cut out or are occurring between the panels.\n\nDonald Ault, “Imagetextuality: ‘Cutting Up’ Again, pt. III”\n\nHere is our narrative made paradise, brief tales made glorious continuity.Alan Moore and Kevin O’Neil, Black Dossier\n\nIn this essay, I want to focus on some of the specific formal qualities of the graphic novel, using as my case study writer Alan Moore and artist Kevin O’Neil’s three volumes of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. (The first issue of a fourth, entitled Volume III: Century, was released in the spring of 2009). In particular, I hope to show that this series, and especially its third volume, 2008’s Black Dossier, offers an exceptional self-reflexive or modernist commentary on the potentialities of the medium, as well as on its importance for thinking about both the new forms of literacy emergent in the electronic realm and our global culture more generally.\n\nI begin, however, with an earlier comment that Moore made in a 2001 interview concerning the (im)possibility of a film adaptation of what many still find to be his masterpiece, the grim and complex dystopia of Watchmen (1986-1987), the only graphic novel included in Time magazine’s list of the best novels published between 1923 and 2005. In the interview, Moore observes, “You get people saying, ‘Oh, yes, Watchmen is very cinematic,’ when actually it’s not. It’s almost the exact opposite of cinematic” (Hughes 146). Moore also notes that Terry Gilliam, who at one time was slated to direct Watchmen, asked him how he “would film it,” to which Moore responded, “I had to tell him that, frankly, I didn’t think it was filmable. I didn’t design it to show off the similarities between cinema and comics, which are there, but, in my opinion are fairly unremarkable. It was designed to show off the things that comics could do that cinema and literature couldn’t” (Hughes 148). After numerous delays the film was released in March, 2009, in a version directed by Zack Snyder, who also directed the film adaptation of Frank Miller’s 300 (2007). By Moore’s request, his name appears nowhere in the screen credits, which note only, “Based on the graphic novel illustrated by Dave Gibbons.” While the film does a fascinating job of translating the original Reagan/Thatcher context of the graphic novel into that of the post-9/11 global war on terror, complete with repeated images of the twin towers of the World Trade Center and its own “falling man,” many fans of the graphic novel seem to agree with the sentiments of TimeOut Sidney reviewer Nick Dent, who writes,\n\nWhile Watchmen is still as rich, daring, and intelligent an action film as there’s ever been, it also proves Moore absolutely right. As a comic book, Watchmen is an extraordinary thing. As a movie, it’s just another movie, awash with sound and fury. Even the most delicious apple imaginable could never be called an orange.\n\nOthers have taken Moore’s comments –as well as his unwillingness to accept any of the credit for or profit from blockbuster film adaptations of his work –as indications of his eccentricity and over-inflated auteur ego. Watchmen is the fourth film adaptation of Moore narratives, after From Hell (2001), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) – though this version, which takes great liberties with Moore’s story, should be said to have been at the very best “inspired by” the graphic novel – and V for Vendetta (2005). It proved by a good margin to be the most financially remunerative for its makers (as long as we exempt from the list Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight [2008], which was deeply influenced by Moore’s classic Batman one-shot, The Killing Joke [1988] –Heath Ledger even stated that he was given a copy of the work as he was preparing for the role). However, I want to argue that Moore’s steadfastness is part of an ongoing effort to make his audience acknowledge precisely what is unique about his chosen medium. A good deal of attention has been paid to the ways in which graphic novels resemble and draw upon the visual vocabulary of film, and this has enabled the development of an effective set of hermeneutic tools for the growing scholarly and critical attention being focused upon the medium. However, to overstress these similarities is, as Moore reminds us, to run the risk of missing the things that comics and the graphic novel can do that of which neither print nor film are capable.\n\nThe elision of film and comics arises in part from the fact that, as technologies (techné), both emerge in the late-nineteenth-century context of a nascent cultural modernism (as does a third deeply linked, even mediatory form, that of science fiction). Moreover, what I would describe as the modernist moment of the comics medium –that of its great auteurs and the emergence of a new self-reflexivity within the form (this happens, as Fredric Jameson argues, in sound film in the 1950s and 1960s, and as I claim, in science fiction in the 1960s and 1970s1) –occurs later in the graphic novel form. Of this development Moore and Gibbons’ Watchmen, along with Art Spiegelman’s Maus, the Hernandez brothers’ Love and Rockets, and Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns, might be taken as indexes. As a consequence, and as was the case with its kin media and forms at various times in their histories, comics narration has tended to be understood as at best to be a second-level, derivative form, and has often been read through interpretive and evaluative criteria which are simply not its own. (This is comparable to evaluating the novel according to the criteria of the epic, film according to those of literature, or science fiction according to those of the realist novel –Dent’s apples and oranges). Jameson makes the dangers of such comparisons explicit when he writes:\n\nMany arguments can be made for the importance and interest of non-canonical forms such as that of the third world, but one is peculiarly self-defeating because it borrows the weapons of the adversary: the strategy of trying to prove that these texts are as ‘great’ as those of the canon itself. The object is then to show that, to take an example from another non-canonical form, Dashiell Hammett is really as great as Dostoyevsky, and therefore can be admitted. This is to attempt dutifully to wish away all traces of that ‘pulp’ format which is constitutive of sub-genres, and it invites immediate failure insofar as any passionate reader of Dostoyevsky will know after a few pages, that those kinds of satisfactions are not present. Nothing is to be gained by passing over in silence the radical difference of non-canonical texts. (“Third World Literature,” 65)2"
