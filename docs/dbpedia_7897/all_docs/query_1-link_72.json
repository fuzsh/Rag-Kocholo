Carter\n\nGenevieve Slomski\n\n• African American Literature of Colonial America\n\n• African American Literature during the Antebellum Period\n\n• African American Literature from Reconstruction to the Harlem Renaissance\n\n• The Harlem Renaissance\n\n• African American Literature of the Mid-Twentieth Century\n\n• The Black Arts Movement\n\n• African American Literature of the Late Twentieth Century and Early Twenty-First Century\n\n• African American Authors and Literary Critics\n\n• Award Winners\n\nAfrican American literature in the United States reached an artistic pinnacle in the period between World War I and World War II with the Harlem Renaissance. Since then, African American writing has embraced themes that range from the highly charged and sociopolitical to private and introspective. The Black Arts movement of the 1960s and 1970s brought acclaim and prominence to many African American writers, and fostered the growth of African American studies at numerous universities around the country. In the 1980s and 1990s, African American writers were working in every genre—from scriptwriting to poetry—as they signed more contracts with major publishing companies, and their works consistently appeared on bestseller lists. During the first decade of the twenty-first century, African American literature maintained the high level of visibility established in the 1980s and 1990s. Black writers continued to explore a diversity of genres, as well as themes, and to create critically acclaimed works.\n\nAFRICAN AMERICAN LITERATURE OF COLONIAL AMERICA\n\nThe African American literary tradition began in 1746 when Lucy Terry, at age 16, created Bars Fight and was sustained during the colonial era by individuals such as Jupiter Hammon, Phillis Wheatley, Briton Hammon, James Gronniosaw, and Olaudah Equiano. Although Terry’s poem was composed in 1746, it was preserved in song only until its publication in 1855. Thus, Jupiter Hammon’s An Evening Thought, Salvation, by Christ, with Penitential Cries, published as a broadside in 1760, was the first poem published by an African American. Thirteen years later, Phillis Wheatley became the first African American—and the second woman—to publish a book in the colonies. Published in 1773, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, by Phillis Wheatley, Negro Servant to Mr. John Wheatley, of Boston, in New England made a tremendous impact on white colonial America, since many felt that African Americans were not capable of the depth of feeling required to write poetry. Soon after its publication, Wheatley gained such international recognition that she was granted her freedom.\n\nWhile Terry, Hammon, and Wheatley composed poetry, Briton Hammon, Gronniosaw, and Equiano created autobiographies. In 1760 The Narrative of the Uncommon Sufferings and Surprizing Deliverance of Briton Hammon, a Negro Man was published. Hammon’s Narrative only contains 14 pages; however, it is considered the first African American autobiography. A more developed autobiography, A Narrative of the Most Remarkable\n\nParticulars in the Life of James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw was printed in 1770 and reprinted in later editions. Gronniosaw is mentioned in Equiano’s two-volume work, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African, Written by Himself (1789). Gronniosaw and Equiano’s autobiographies provided a dual perspective that subsequent slave narratives lacked: life in Africa and life in America. Equiano’s autobiography became a bestseller within his lifetime, with nine English editions and one American edition including translations in Dutch, German, and Russian. Equiano died in 1797, yet his autobiography influenced many nineteenth century black autobiographers.\n\nTherefore, these African Americans authors clearly demonstrated that that they could eloquently express themselves in English—a second language for most blacks during the colonial era—and represent themselves effectively in a variety of literary genres.\n\nAFRICAN AMERICAN LITERATURE DURING THE ANTEBELLUM PERIOD\n\nPerhaps the greatest satisfaction for African American writers during the period prior to the Civil War was having the freedom to write. Actually, knowing how to read and write was a tremendous accomplishment for many African Americans. This was due to the fact that only sporadic attempts at systematic instruction of Africans in colonial America had been made, and stringent laws were later passed in the nineteenth century that prohibited whites from teaching African Americans to read and write.\n\nTHE SLAVE NARRATIVES\n\nSlave narratives are literary milestones. Briton Hammon, James Gronnisaw, and Olaudah Equiano’s eighteenth-century autobiographies, along with their nineteenth-century counterparts, are the progenitors of full-length African American prose. These first-person narratives represented more than their individual authors; they provided a literary voice for the silent, enslaved masses that never had opportunities to document their life stories. In doing so, the autobiographers utilized the language of their captors as a method of rebellion.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, slave narratives established themes and structural considerations that had been previously overlooked. Noted literary critic Frances Smith Foster, in Witnessing Slavery: The Development of the Ante-Bellum Slave Narrative (1979), has identified four chronological phases prevalent in slave narratives: the loss of freedom, cognizance of options to slavery and a determination to gain freedom, escape, and freedom realized. Although many readers may consider the narratives by such persons as Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, or Harriet Jacobs more political than artistic, the ability to adapt and utilize language in a manner that showed the glaring inconsistencies and inhumanity of slavery must be recognized as an accomplishment of letters. The full extent of these writers’ revolutionary thoughts was channeled through these traditional subjects of the Bible and neoclassicism. However, the restructuring and inclusion of the African American perspective created a viable means of resistance and expression.\n\nThe three most prominent authors of slave narratives were Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, and Harriet Jacobs. Douglass wrote three autobiographies: Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave (1845), which is considered the preeminent slave narrative; My Bondage and My Freedom (1855); and The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass (1881). Douglass’s fellow abolitionist William Wells Brown also authored three autobiographies: Narrative of William Wells Brown, A Fugitive Slave (1847), his most popular autobiography; Three Years in Europe: Or Places I Have Seen and People I Have Met (1852); and My Southern Home (1880).\n\nHarriet Jacobs’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861) is an important work in that it is the most comprehensive slave narrative by a woman. Douglass, Brown, and Jacobs’s autobiographies are currently in print, and they, along with other slave narratives, are available in various collections such as Yusef Taylor’s two-volume I Was Born a Slave: An Anthology of Classic Slave Narratives (1999) and The Library of America’s Slave Narratives (2000). The nineteenth-century slave narratives continued the tradition of black self-definition and self-assertion that was established by the eighteenth-century slave narratives. The slave narratives of both centuries served as a preface and a foundation for subsequent expression through fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays, and other genres.\n\nNOVELS AND OTHER GENRES\n\nDuring the antebellum period, the majority of published African American works were slave narratives; nevertheless, African Americans made significant contributions to other literary genres. Antebellum African American writers, following in the footsteps of their colonial predecessors, continued to create poetry. George Moses Horton, for example, published three volumes of verse: The Hope of Liberty (1829); The Poetical Works of George M. Horton, The Colored Bard of North Carolina (1845); and Naked Genius (1865).\n\nPoetry and slave narratives were genres that African Americans began writing during the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century, African Americans demonstrated their ability to create fiction. Victor Sejour’s short story The Mulatto (1837) is the earliest extant work of African American fiction. In 1859, Frances E. W. Harper’s The Two Offers, the earliest known short story by an African American woman, was published.\n\nThe first African American novels were published during the antebellum period. The most well-known are William Wells Brown’s Clotel, Or, the President’s Daughter (1853), the first African American novel; Frank Webb’s The Garies and Their Friends (1857); Harriet Wilson’s Our Nig, or, Sketches from the Life of a Free Black, in a Two-Story White House, North, Showing That Slavery’s Shadows Fall Even There (1859), the first published novel by an African American woman; and Martin Delany’s Blake, or, the Huts of America (1859). In 2002, Hannah Crafts’s The Bondwoman’s Narrative was published. Crafts’s handwritten manuscript, dating from the 1850s, was recovered by Henry Louis Gates Jr., and authenticated in 2001. Crafts’s work appears to be the first novel written by a female fugitive slave, and it may be the first novel by an African American woman.\n\nThe first African American drama, The Escape, or, a Leap for Freedom, was published in 1858. Its author is William Wells Brown, the same individual who wrote one of the most influential slave narratives and the first African American novel. He is considered the first African American author of belles lettres.\n\nAFRICAN AMERICAN LITERATURE FROM RECONSTRUCTION TO THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE\n\nWith the end of the Civil War and the beginning of the era of Reconstruction, African American writers were eager to address subjects of personal and individual freedom. However, prevalent attitudes forced black writers to continue to address issues of “the master mentality” and “plantation politics.” Few writers could support themselves by their writing, and many went unknown.\n\nAs the United States moved into the close of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century, other African American writers, such as Frances E.W. Harper, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Pauline Hopkins, and Charles Waddell Chesnutt, found an audience that appreciated their works. Among their works published during this period are Harper’s novel Iola Leroy, or, Shadows Uplifted (1892); Dunbar’s volume of verse, Lyrics of a Lowly Life (1896), which was his third of 11 volumes; Hopkins’s novel Contending Forces: A Romance Illustrative of Negro Life North and South (1900); and Chesnutt’s short stories, The Conjure Woman (1899), and The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories of the Color Line (1899), as well as his three novels: The House Behind the Cedars (1900), The Marrow of Tradition (1901), and The Colonel’s Dream (1905). The most widely known work of this period, Booker T. Washington’s Up From Slavery (1901), was the bestselling slave narrative of the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries.\n\nWhite society, however, still controlled much of publishing in America; African American work was often filtered and distorted through this lens. As a result, much of the work published by African Americans attempted to prove that they could fit into America’s middle class society. In fact, much of the literature of this era portrayed African Americans as being happy with their assigned lot. Yet some writers—Harper, Dunbar, Hopkins, and Chesnutt, for example—tried to break the chains of this imposed expression. They presented a view of African American life as it really was, not as white America wanted it to be.\n\nThe accomplishments of African American writers during the time prior to the Harlem Renaissance attest to both the use of literary forms and the purpose in finding their own voices. Although themes were often muted and subjected to continuous scrutiny, the use of imagery, language, and a new perspective opened the way for African American writers to focus more on the wealth of their culture and the African American experience in a truthful and honest fashion.\n\nTHE HARLEM RENAISSANCE\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance was the era of prolific African American creativity in literature, art, and music. Resistant to the easy categorization of a timeline, the Harlem Renaissance began around the onset of World War I in 1914 and extended into the early 1930s. It began with the movement of African American artists and writers into Harlem from practically every state in the country.\n\nBy the 1920s, Harlem was the largest community of black individuals in the world, encompassing Africans, people from the West Indies, the Caribbean, and the Americas. This community, similar to many urban communities in the North, saw the collective energies of persons joining together to celebrate the artistic talents of African Americans. While Harlem served as the hub of artistic activity, Washington, D.C. was also a place where many artists congregated to explore the new perspectives and ideas of the time. The largest group of women who were participants in the Harlem Renaissance found their literary identities not so much in Harlem, but in Washington in the company of host poet Georgia Douglas Johnson and other artists.\n\nAs African American journals such as W.E.B. Du Bois’s Crisis and Opportunity, edited by Charles S. Johnson, began to flourish, it became possible for African American writers to publish in a style that suited their tastes. Du Bois and Johnson were among the older, established authors, critics, and editors who encouraged younger writers. Jessie Redmon Fauset, who was an author of four novels and editor of Crisis magazine, did much to support the work of younger authors as well as women writers. In fact, Langston Hughes and others contend that the Renaissance came about because of the nurturing of older writers including Fauset and Alain Locke, a Howard University professor and literary critic. Also, African American writers discovered that some white patrons in the publishing field were, in fact, interested in promoting their works, and as a result, books by black authors were published with an unprecedented frequency.\n\nIn addition to Du Bois and Fauset, important writers of this era include Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Wallace Thurman, Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, Nella Larsen, Eric Walrond, Rudolph Fisher, Jean Toomer, and Arna Bontemps. Among the most significant works of the era are Locke’s The New Negro (1925), an anthology of Harlem Renaissance works; Thurman’s Infants of the Spring (1932), a novel that satirizes the Harlem Renaissance; and Hughes’s The Big Sea (1940), his first autobiography that provides the best account of the Harlem Renaissance by one of its participants. Although free expression was essential to artists of the Harlem Renaissance, stereotypes that permeated the American culture made their writings appear rebellious. The conscious agenda of these mostly young, African American artists concerned the definition and celebration of African American art and culture and a desire to change the preconceived and erroneous notions most Americans had of African American life. Such views are eloquently expressed best in Hughes’s essay “The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain” (1926). Hughes’s essay, which was a manifesto for his contemporaries and has served as inspiration for subsequent generations of African Americans, ends with his bold declaration:\n\nWe younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn’t matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly too. The tom-tom cries and the tom-tom laughs. If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, their displeasure doesn’t matter either. We build our temples for tomorrow, strong as we know how, and we stand on top of the mountain, free within ourselves.\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance shifted away from the moralizing work that had been characteristic of much of post-Reconstruction writing that decried racism. W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain Locke realized that, as did many of the emerging young writers, literary efforts that catered to changing the conscience of the United States were no longer useful nor should such efforts be a primary consideration for artists. These writers felt communicating the African American experience through every facet of artistic mediums would, of itself, expound upon ills of a racist world. Issues then could be expressed through the lives of working-class and middle-class characters as the text sought to paint a realistic picture.\n\nIn this time of discovery for African Americans of the view from within, many also saw the changing relationships between blacks and whites. Literature reintroduced white America to a people who needed, wanted, and would eventually demand full participation in the society for which they had lived, labored, and died. This perspective would end the goal of convincing white America of African American entitlement and, instead, focus on self-education and exploration of the quality of the African American experience. It paved the way for power through art to inspire the masses and the writers of the 1960s.\n\nAFRICAN AMERICAN LITERATURE OF THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\nAs the Great Depression of the 1930s deepened, the Harlem Renaissance slowly faded. Richard Wright’s publication in 1940 of Native Son marked the beginning of a transition period in African American literature that would last until 1955. Writers during this time bridged the richly creative period of the Renaissance with the more intense creativity and sociopolitical activity that was to define the work produced during the civil rights movement.\n\nWith the publication of his classic novel Native Son, Wright maintained that the era of the Harlem Renaissance—with its motto of “art for art’s sake”—must end and be replaced with works directly intended to stop racism. He also believed that African Americans were an essential part of American society. These tenets became the foundation for the ideology of the civil rights movement.\n\nDuring this time, other African American writers, notably poets, were taking a different road in their quest to be heard. Such poets as Gwendolyn Brooks, Melvin B. Tolson, Margaret Walker, and Robert Hayden employed classical and mythical themes. Brooks won a Pulitzer Prize in 1950 for her book Annie Allen (1949) and was the first African American to receive the award. These poets used a blend of extreme eclecticism with realistic, African American issues. The blend was successful, as their writing was met with acceptance in the university community.\n\nAnn Petry’s novel The Street (1946); Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man (1952), arguably one of the best novels published in the United States during the twentieth century; James Baldwin’s novel Go Tell It on the Mountain (1953), as well as his essays such as Notes of a Native Son (1955), Nobody Knows My Name: More Notes of a Native Son (1961), and The Fire Next Time (1963), were other books that brought serious African American issues to mainstream culture. In addition, many African American works were gaining acceptance with the mainstream literary establishment.\n\nIn 1959, on the “eve” of the Black Arts movement, Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun opened in New York. Hansberry was the first African American woman to have a play produced on Broadway, and the first African American to win the New York Drama Critics Circle Award. Hansberry received inspiration for the drama’s title from lines in a Langston Hughes poem, Dream Deferred. Her play centers around the Younger family’s desire to move from Chicago’s South Side to a white neighborhood. Thus, art imitated reality as A Raisin in the Sun mirrored the many efforts to integrate neighborhoods across America during the 1950s.\n\nTHE BLACK ARTS MOVEMENT\n\nThe Black Arts movement, sometimes called the Black Aesthetics movement, was the first major African American artistic movement since the Harlem Renaissance. Beginning in the early 1960s and lasting through the mid-1970s, this movement was fueled by the anger of Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, Ann Petry, and other notable African American writers.\n\nThe artistic movement flourished alongside the civil rights marches and the call for the independence of the African American community. As phrases such as “black is beautiful” were popularized, African American writers of the Black Arts movement consciously set out to define what it meant to be a black writer in a white culture. While writers of the Harlem Renaissance seemed to investigate their identity within, writers of the Black Arts movement desired to define themselves and their era before being defined by others.\n\nFor the most part, participants in the Black Arts movement were supportive of separatist politics and a black nationalist ideology. Larry Neal wrote in an essay “The Black Arts Movement” (1968) that the movement was the “aesthetic and spiritual sister of the Black Power concept.” Rebelling against the mainstream society by being essentially anti-white, anti-American, and anti-middle class, these artists moved from the Renaissance view of art for art’s sake into a philosophy of art for politics’ sake.\n\nThe Black Arts movement attempted to produce works of art that would be meaningful to the African American masses. Towards this end, popular African American music of the day, including John Coltrane’s jazz and James Brown’s soul, as well as street talk, were some of the inspirational forces for the movement. In fact, much of the language used in these works was aggressive, profane, and shocking—this was often a conscious attempt to show the vitality and power of African American activists. These writers tended to be revolutionaries, supporting both radical and peaceful protests for change as promoted by Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. In addition, they believed that artists were required to do more than create: artists also had to be political activists in order to achieve nationalist goals.\n\nLeading writers in this movement included Amiri Baraka (Leroi Jones), whose poetry and plays were as well known as his political prowess, and Haki R. Madhubuti (Don L. Lee), a poet and essayist who sold more than 100,000 copies of his books without a national distributor. On the other hand, Ishmael Reed—an early organizer of the Black Arts movement—later dissented with some of the movement’s doctrines and became inspired more by the black magic and spiritual practices of the West Indies (in what he called the “HooDoo Aesthetic”). Other organizers and essayists include Larry Neal, Ethridge Knight, Addison Gale Jr., and Maulana Karenga.\n\nNikki Giovanni was one of the first poets of the Black Arts movement to receive recognition. In her works, she advocated militant replies to white oppression and demonstrated through her performances that music is an inextricable part of the African American tradition in all aspects of life. Poet Sonia Sanchez was another leading voice of the movement. She managed to combine feminism with her commitment to nurturing children and men in the fight for black nationalism. Sanchez was a member of the Nation of Islam from 1972 to 1975, and through her association with the Black Arts movement, she managed to instill stronger support for the role of women in that religion.\n\nTwo major Black Arts presses were run by poets: Dudley Randall’s Broadside Press in Detroit and Haki Madhubuti’s Third World Press in Chicago. From 1961 to 1976, the most important African American magazine was Negro Digest (renamed Black World in 1970); its editor, Hoyt Fuller, published the works of the Black Arts poets and prose writers. Landmark publications of the movement include Black Fire (1968), an anthology of Black Arts writing edited by Amiri Baraka and Larry Neal; The New Black Poetry (1969), edited by Clarence Major; The Black Woman (1970), the first major African American feminist anthology, edited by Toni Cade Bambara; The Black Poets (1971), edited by Dudley Randall; and Understanding the New Black Poetry (1972), an anthology edited by Stephen Henderson.\n\nAFRICAN AMERICAN LITERATURE OF THE LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND EARLY TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY\n\nBefore the Black Arts movement ended in the mid-1970s, Marvin Gaye’s album What’s Going On (1971) was released. On the album’s title track, Gaye sings about the social problems of the late 1960s and early 1970s: the Vietnam War, protest demonstrations, and subsequent police brutality. The title of his classic album was not only a popular greeting but also testimony to the African American literary tradition. Since the end of the Black Arts movement, African Americans have written about “what’s going on” in greater numbers and to greater recognition than at any other time in literary history.\n\nImportant developments in African American literature during the last three decades of the twentieth century include the overwhelming success of many African American women writers, as well as a growth in the number of authors who have found that they can straddle more than one genre. The works of black writers appear more frequently as bestsellers, and at times, works of several African American authors appear concurrently on the lists. African American writing has become more legitimized in the United States, and African American studies departments have emerged in many universities around the country.\n\nOne of the first books of the contemporary renaissance of African American literature was Alex Haley’s Roots (1976). It was perhaps one of the greatest African American writing coups of the late twentieth century. With Haley’s book, as well as the highly popular television miniseries that followed, many black Americans have been encouraged to discover their own African roots. Since then, other books that explore the history of African Americans in the American West, the South, and the North have been published and eagerly received by African Americans.\n\nAs a result of the large number of African American literary works that have been published since the 1980s, a multitude of themes are present. Many African American writers have shifted their attention away from writing about the lack of equality between blacks and whites and toward themes of self-reflection, self-definition, and healing. Numerous African American women write in response to the Black Arts movement, protesting the role that they feel women played in the male-oriented black nationalist movement.\n\nZora Neale Hurston’s novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), and her other works have been resurrected and used as inspiration. The women’s liberation movement also supports these women by allowing their works to reach a wider audience. In this way, the somewhat female-repressive politics of the Black Arts movement has provoked women writers to express their own unique voices. Alice Walker, Gayl Jones, Toni Morrison, Terry McMillan, and Gloria Naylor are examples of successful women novelists who have become prominent figures in the publishing world. Autobiographer and poet Maya Angelou is another major literary figure.\n\nSince the 1980s, African American women writers have been at the leading edge of the publishing industry—in quality as well as quantity of work. In addition to Walker, Jones, Morrison, McMillan, and Naylor, other prominent women working primarily as novelists include Edwidge Danticat, Gwendolyn Parker, Jamaica Kincaid, Lucinda Roy, Marita Golden, Bernice McFadden, Toni Cade Bambara, Diane McKinney-Whetstone, Helen Lee, Yolanda Joe, Dawn Turner Trice, Pearl Cleage, and Barbara Chase-Riboud. While African American male writers are outnumbered by black women writers, among the contemporary African American male novelists are Ernest Gaines, Ishmael Reed, Walter Mosley, John Edgar Wideman, Albert French, E. Lynn Harris, Colson White-head, Darryl Pinckney, Brian Keith Jackson, Trey Ellis, Brent Wade, and Clarence Major. African American novelists often confront issues of identity, offering interpretations of womanhood and manhood. Challenged by W.E.B. Du Bois’s statement about dual identity as an American and as a black person, they collectively provide panoramic insight into African American life.\n\nThe decade of the 1990s as well as the first decade of the twenty-first century benefited from a broad spectrum of African American works that explored “breath of life” experiences. Themes centered on slavery are prevalent in the works of writers who focus on the African American past. Relationships are of thematic interest to many modern day African American writers. Other important themes in contemporary African American literature relate to family and coming-of-age issues. A number of the coming-of-age novels by African Americans portray their protagonists maturing during the civil rights era.\n\nBarriers have been dismantled in various genres. Rivaling their white contemporaries, Octavia Butler and Samuel Delany create works of science fiction; Tananarive Due crafts supernatural novels; Walter Mosley, Barbara Neely, Valerie Wilson Wesley, and Eleanor Taylor Bland write detective fiction; and August Wilson and Susan-Lori Parks take their plays to Broadway. Clearly, variety exists in contemporary African American novels. Novels of folk history, such as Colson Whitehead’s John Henry Days (2001), and novels of the urban experience, such as Richard Wright’s posthumous novella, Rite of Passage (1994), are equally well received. Many artists find that they can straddle more than one genre—Walter Mosley, Alice Walker, Gayl Jones, J. California Cooper, and Andrea Lee are good examples.\n\nWith the exception of the novel, the most prolific form of African American writing during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries is autobiography. Memoirs and autobiographies have become a popular mode of expression, especially for non-professional writers, entertainers, athletes, educators, ministers, civil rights leaders, politicians, physicians, attorneys, motivational speakers, and relatives of celebrities have written their life stories.\n\nA memoir worthy of distinction is Arthur Ashe’s Days of Grace (1993), a work he co-authored with professor and literary critic Arnold Rampersad. In it, the tennis legend reveals that living with AIDS was not his life’s greatest burden; living as a black person in America was.\n\nOne of the most popular autobiographies at the end of the twentieth century was Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters’ First 100 Years (1993), by Sarah (Sadie) L. Delany and A. Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany (with Amy Hill Hearth). Their autobiography was published when Sadie, a former educator, was 104 years old, and Bessie, a former dentist and civil rights activist, was 102. Philanthropist, entrepreneur, and foundation executive Camille Cosby acquired the stage, film, and television rights to the autobiography. Consequently, Having Our Say opened on Broadway in 1995, and was later transformed into a made-for-television film. During the summer of 2002, Having Our Say was recommended reading as the District of Columbia began a program designed to encourage individuals to read.\n\n“Amateur” writers are not the only individuals publishing their memoirs, however. Maya Angelou’s first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1970), is greatly responsible for the revitalization of African American autobiography. Angelou has written five additional autobiographies, including A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002). In 1977, 17 years after Richard Wright’s death, his second autobiography, American Hunger, was published. Its pages are comprised of the section that Wright’s publisher deleted from Black Boy (1945).\n\nPoetry, the first genre that African Americans produced, remains a popular vehicle for black expression. A number of poets who began publishing their works in the 1960s, such as Mari Evans, Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Jayne Cortez, Haki Madhubuti, and Nikki Giovanni, along with poets who were first published in the 1970s, such as Maya Angelou, Lucille Clifton, Ai, Toi Derricotte, and Yusef Komunyakaa, have continued to publish in the 1990s and beyond. Joining them are poets who began publishing in the 1980s—Rita Dove and Cornelius Eady—as well as poets who began publishing in the 1990s, including Kevin Powell, Elizabeth Alexander, and Kevin Young.\n\nImportant anthologies that include verse or collections of poetry published since the 1990s include On the Verge: Emerging Poets and Artists (1993), edited by Thomas Sayers Ellis and Joseph Lease; The Furious Flowering of African American Poetry (1999), edited by Joanne Gabbin; and Words With Wings: A Treasury of African-American Poetry and Art (2000), edited by Belinda Rochelle. In 1994, James Madison University hosted the Furious Flower Conference, dedicated to Gwendolyn Brooks. The conference featured three generations of poets, and was acknowledged as the “largest gathering of poets and critics” in more than two decades. A second Furious Flower Conference was held in Harrisburg, Virginia, in 2004, with more than 60 distinguished poets and scholars in attendance.\n\nWhether writing in traditional styles such as the sonnet or being influenced by rap or hip-hop, African American creators of verse tackle the same issues as their prose counterparts: identity, racism, sexism, classism, relationships, politics, and urban life. Since the 1980s, poetry has become more popular and more accessible in the United States. Bookstores, universities, and literary groups continue to host established poets who read their verse before audiences. In addition, bookstores and cafés hold poetry slams and open mike nights where amateur poets can present their works. There are a variety of Internet sites that encourage novices to submit their verse.\n\nAfrican American writers and their works continue to be heralded on the national and international levels. Multiple National Book Award winners have been African Americans since the 1980s, including Alice Walker, Charles Johnson, Ai, and Lucille Clifton. Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded to Alex Haley, August Wilson, and Rita Dove, among others. And two African American women writers recorded landmark achievements in 1993: Rita Dove was named U.S. poet laureate and Toni Morrison won the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nWith the arrival of the twenty-first century, African American writers continue to look into their own world for answers rather than letting others define their past, present, or future. Contemporary black authors are the beneficiaries of the vast legacy established by writers of the colonial period, the antebellum period, reconstruction era, Harlem Renaissance, the mid-twentieth century, and the Black Arts movement. Twenty-first century writers, empowered by their talents and their literary ancestors, are expanding and enhancing the African American literary tradition.\n\nAFRICAN AMERICAN AUTHORS AND LITERARY CRITICS\n\n(To locate biographical profiles more readily, please consult the index at the back of the book.)\n\nRAYMOND ANDREWS (1934–1991) Novelist\n\nBorn in 1934 in Madison, Georgia, Raymond Andrews left his sharecropper home for Atlanta at 15 years of age. Once establishing himself, he attended high school at night and went on to the U.S. Air Force (1952–1956) and attended Michigan State University before moving to New York City. While working in New York in a variety of jobs—airline reservations clerk, hamburger cook, photo librarian, proofreader, inventory taker, mail room clerk, messenger, air courier dispatcher, and bookkeeper—he also perfected his literary skills.\n\nAndrews’ Muskhogean County trilogy, which describes the life of African Americans in the deep South from World War I to the beginnings of the civil rights’ era in the 1960s, includes three novels. The first novel, Appalachee Red (1978), set in the African American neighborhood of a northern Georgia town called Appalachee, was widely acclaimed. In the opinion of the reviewer for the St. Louis Globe Democrat, his work marked the literary debut of a significant modern American novelist comparable in stature to a Richard Wright or James Baldwin. The following year, Raymond Andrews was the first recipient of the annual James Baldwin Prize presented by Dial Press at a ceremony attended by Baldwin.\n\nAndrews’s second work, Rosiebelle Lee Wildcat Tennessee: A Novel (1980), chronicled the 40-year reign—which began in 1906—of the spiritual and temporal leader of the African American community of Appalachee. Baby Sweets (1983), Andrews’s third novel, is named after the brothel operated by the eccentric son of Appalachee’s leading citizen. The brothel provides African American prostitutes to the town’s white population. The novel was published by Dial Press and illustrated by Andrew’s brother, Benny, who illustrated all of Andrew’s novels. This novel examines how the intermingling of the races affects an entire community, both black and white.\n\nOn November 25, 1991, Andrews died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Athens, Georgia.\n\nMAYA ANGELOU (1928– ) Novelist, Poet, Actress\n\nMaya Angelou, born Marguerite Johnson on April 4, 1928, is a writer, journalist, poet, actress, singer, dancer, playwright, director, and producer. Angelou spent her formative years shuttling between her native St. Louis, a tiny, totally segregated town in Arkansas, and San Francisco, where she realized her ambition of becoming that city’s first African American streetcar conductor. But her true mark came later in life as her words became a symbol of hope that touched the soul of the people of the United States. Perhaps the ultimate recognition of her talent came when President-elect Bill Clinton asked the poet to compose and recite an inaugural poem for his swearing-in ceremony in 1993. Before reaching that point, however, Angelou experienced a great variety of life’s offerings, as inspired by her mother, grandmother, and other female role models in her life.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Angelou studied dance with Pearl Primus in New York City, and later appeared as a nightclub singer there, as well as in San Francisco and Hawaii. She toured with the U.S. State Department’s production of Porgy and Bess in the mid-1950s. She began the following decade in the position of northern coordinator of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Angelou went abroad working as an editor for The Arab Observer, an English-language weekly published in Cairo. While living in Accra, Ghana, under the black nationalist regime of Kwame Nkrumah, she taught music, drama, and wrote for the Ghanian Times. Angelou later went to Sweden to study cinematography.\n\nAngelou became a national celebrity in 1970 with the publication of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, the first volume of her autobiography, which detailed her encounters with Southern racism and a pre-pubescent rape by her mother’s lover. The work was nominated for that year’s National Book Award. Four additional volumes of Angelou’s autobiography were published: Gather Together in My Name (1974); Singin’ and Swingin’ and Gettin’ Merry Like Christmas (1976); The Heart of a Woman (1981); and A Song Flung Up To Heaven (2002).\n\nAngelou’s published works also include: Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ’fore I Die: The Poetry of Maya Angelou (1971); Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well (1975); And Still I Rise (1978); Shaker Why Don’t You Sing? (1983); All God’s Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986); and Wouldn’t Take Nothing for My Journey Now (1993). In addition, Angelou’s works include: Mrs. Flowers: A Moment of Friendship; Now Sheba Sings the Song; and Phenomenal Woman: Four Poems Celebrating Women.\n\nNot limited to writing, Angelou dabbled both in front of and behind the camera. In 1977, she was nominated for an Emmy award for her portrayal of Nyo Boto in the television adaptation of Alex Haley’s bestselling novel Roots. She also starred in the 1993 made-for-television movie There Are No Children Here, which co-starred Oprah Winfrey. That same year, Angelou wrote poetry for John Singleton’s Poetic Justice and played a small role in the film. The following year, Angelou appeared in a television commercial, reading a version of her poem “Still I Rise” for the United Negro College Fund’s Fiftieth Anniversary. She co-starred with Winona Ryder, Anne Bancroft, and Ellen Burstyn in How to Make an American Quilt (1995). Also active behind the scenes, she became the first African American woman to have a movie produced with Georgia, Georgia (1972), based on one of her books; and directed the films All Day Long in 1974 and Down in the Delta in 1998. In 2004, she published Hallelujah! The Welcome Table: A Lifetime of Memories with Recipes.\n\nThe 1990s held many highlights for the sought-after poet, who remained as active as she had been earlier in her career. On January 20, 1993, Angelou read her newly-created “On the Pulse of Morning” during the inauguration of President Bill Clinton. This event occurred just a few days after her play And Still I Rise was performed in Washington, D.C. In 1994, Angelou narrated a World Choir ’94 concert held at the Georgia Dome, where the festival featured 10,000 singers from ten different countries. She also gave a reading at the National Black Arts Festival that year. In 1995, Angelou delivered “A Brave and Startling Truth” at a United Nation’s fiftieth anniversary ceremony held in San Francisco, read Sterling Brown’s “Strong Men” at the inauguration of Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry, and was a keynote speaker, along with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, at the 25th anniversary of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies.\n\nAngelou has been the recipient of many honorary degrees and awards that include a Golden Eagle Award for the 1977 documentary Afro-American in the Arts, a Matrix Award from Women in Communications, Inc. in 1983, a North Carolina award in literature in 1987, a “best-mannered” citation from the National League of Junior Cotillions in 1993, a Medal of Distinction from the University of Hawaii’s Board of Regents in 1994, and a Spingarn Medal from the NAACP that year. In 1981, Wake Forest University gave Angelou a lifetime appointment as Reynolds Professor of American Studies. In 2000, Angelou was awarded the national medal of art by President Bill Clinton. A year later, she was honored with the Aaron Davis Hall Harlem Renaissance Award. In 2006, she received the Mother Teresa Award for her devotion and service to humanity.\n\nHOUSTON A. BAKER JR. (1943– ) Writer, Literary Critic, Scholar, Educator\n\nHouston A. Baker was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on March 22, 1943. In spite of the racist attitudes that permeated his environment, he went on to see himself as more than a victim. He attended Howard University and received a bachelor’s degree in English and his master’s and doctoral degrees from the University of California at Los Angeles. Out of his youthful experiences, he became an advocate for the Black Power movement, which advocated black nationalism in the period of the late 1960s and 1970s.\n\nAs a young scholar, Baker shifted his critical perspective toward an African American aesthetic in African American literature. In other words, he considered art an instrument of cultural expression in the liberation of black people—an instrument that should be recognized in the study of African American works.\n\nAs editor of the book Black Literature in America (1971), an anthology of African American writers, he began to produce books that gave voice to artistic and literary experiences found in the study of African American literature. Among others, his books include: Twentieth-Century Interpretations of Native Son (1972); A Many-Colored Coat of Dreams: The Poetry of Countee Cullen (1974); No Matter Where You Travel, You Still Be Black (1979); The Journey Back: Issues in Black Literature and Criticism (1980); Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave /emphasis> (1982); Blues, Ideology, and Afro-American Literature: A Vernacular Theory (1984); Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance (1987); Afro-American Poetics: Revision of Harlem and the Black Aesthetic (1988); Black Feminist Criticism and Critical Theory (1988); Afro-American Literary Study in the 1990’s (1989); Black Studies, Rap and the Academy (1993); Passing Over (2000); Critical Memory: Public Spheres, African American Writing, and Black Fathers and Sons in America (2001); and Turning South Again (2001). Baker has also written I Don’t Hate the South: Reflections on Faulkner, Family, and the South (2007); and The Betrayal of Black Intellectuals (forthcoming).\n\nA prolific contributor to numerous scholarly journals and publications as well as president of the Modern Language Association of America in 1992, Baker is considered one of the leading African American intellectuals of his time. As a visiting professor to Duke University and professor and director of the Center for the Study of Black Literature and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania, Baker continues to pursue a more active approach to literary studies. Among his many honors and awards, Baker was awarded the Hubbell Medal in 2003 for lifetime achievement in American Literary Studies.\n\nJAMES BALDWIN (1924–1987) Novelist, Essayist, Playwright\n\nJames Baldwin is best known for his themes of personal and sexual identity and for his vivid depictions of the civil rights struggle in the United States. Born out of wedlock in Harlem, New York City, on August 2, 1924, James Baldwin was raised in poverty. He never knew his biological father; his mother, a domestic worker, married a factory worker who was also a storefront preacher and a violent and cruel man. Baldwin assumed the surname of his stepfather, who died in a mental institution in 1943.\n\nA voracious reader as a child, Baldwin turned to writing after an early career as a boy preacher in Harlem’s storefront Pentecostal churches. Baldwin’s first story appeared in a church newspaper when he was about 12 years old. He attended Frederick Douglass Junior High School in Harlem and later graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, where he was editor of the school magazine. Three years later, he won a Eugene Saxton Fellowship, which enabled him to write full-time. Baldwin’s issues with his stepfather, his own sexual identity, the suicide of a friend, and with racism, drove him away from the United States in 1948. Baldwin resided in Paris and London, as well as in Istanbul.\n\nBaldwin’s first novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain, was published in 1953 and received critical acclaim. Two years later, his first collection of essays, Notes of a Native Son, again won favorable critical acclaim. This work was followed in 1956 by the publication of his second novel, Giovanni’s Room. His second collection of essays, Nobody Knows My Name, established him as a major voice in American literature.\n\nIn 1962, Another Country, Baldwin’s third novel, was a critical and commercial success. A year later, he wrote The Fire Next Time, an immediate bestseller and regarded as one of the most brilliant essays written in the history of African American protest. Since then, two of Baldwin’s plays—Blues for Mister Charlie and The Amen Corner—have been produced on the New York stage, where they achieved modest success. His novel, Tell Me How Long the Train’s Been Gone, was published in 1968. Baldwin himself regarded it as his first “grown-up novel,” but it generated little enthusiasm among critics.\n\nAfter a silence of several years, the question of whether Baldwin had stopped writing was widely debated. He published the 1974 novel, If Beale Street Could Talk. In this work, the problems besetting a ghetto family are portrayed with great sensitivity and humor. Baldwin’s skill as a novelist is evident as he conveyed his own sophisticated analyses through the mind of his protagonist, a young woman. To many critics, however, the novel lacked the undeniable relevance and fiery power of Baldwin’s early polemical essays.\n\nBaldwin’s other works during this time include: Going to Meet the Man (short stories); No Name in the Street; One Day When I Was Lost, a scenario based on Alex Haley’s The Autobiography of Malcolm X; A Rap on Race with Margaret Mead; and A Dialogue with Nikki Giovanni. He was one of the rare authors who worked well alone or in collaboration. Other books by Baldwin include: Nothing Personal (1964) with photographs by Richard Avedon; The Devil Finds Work (1976), about the movies; his sixth novel Just Above My Head (1979); and Little Man, Little Man: A Story of Childhood (1977), a book for children. He wrote 16 books in all.\n\nIn 1979, Baldwin’s novel, Just Above My Head, which dealt with the intertwined lives from childhood to adulthood of a gospel singer, his brother, and a young girl who is a child preacher, was published. The next year, Baldwin’s publisher released Remember This House, described as Baldwin’s “memoirs, history and biography of the civil rights movement” interwoven with the biographies of three assassinated leaders: Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Medgar Evers. Meanwhile, in his lectures, Baldwin remained pessimistic about the future of race relations.\n\nHis last three books were The Evidence of Things Not Seen (1985) about the killing of 28 African American youths in Atlanta, Georgia, in the early 1980s; The Price of the Ticket: Collected Non-fiction 1948–1985 (1985); and Harlem Quartet (1987).\n\nBaldwin spent most of the remainder of his life in France. In 1986, the French government made him a commander of the Legion of Honor, France’s highest civilian award. He died of stomach cancer at his home in France, on November 30, 1987, at the age of 63.\n\nTONI CADE BAMBARA (1939–1995) Writer\n\nToni Cade Bambara was born Miltona Mirkin Cade in New York City in 1939. She took the name “Toni” about the time she was in kindergarten and later took on the name “Bambara,” after finding the signature Bambara on a sketchbook located among the materials in her great-grandmother’s trunk. Bambara’s mother, who was profoundly influenced by the Harlem Renaissance and who profoundly influenced her daughter, strongly encouraged her daughter to explore her creative side and the influences of culture.\n\nComing of age in the 1960s and 1970s allowed Bambara to participate in both the nationalist and the women’s liberation movements. In 1970, Bambara edited The Black Woman: An Anthology, which, being the first of its kind, was recognized as beginning the renaissance of African American women’s literature. Throughout her career, much of Bambara’s writings have explored the experiences of the African American community and, in particular, the experiences of African American women.\n\nWhile working in community-focused positions and pursuing her writing, Bambara received her B.A. from Queens College in New York in 1959 and her M.A. from City College of New York in 1964. Bambara’s active career in academia and her numerous awards have exemplified her desire to use art to promote the social and political welfare of the African American community—but not at the expense of the African American woman. Her works, which are infused with both laughter and rage, include: Gorilla, My Love (1972); The Sea Birds Are Still Alive (1977); The Salt Eaters (1980), which received the American Book Award; and If Blessing Comes (1987).\n\nOn December 9, 1995, Bambara died of colon cancer in Philadelphia. Her last novel, Those Bones Are Not My Child, was published posthumously in 1999.\n\nAMIRI BARAKA (LEROI JONES) (1934– ) Poet, Playwright, Essayist\n\nAmiri Baraka was born Everett LeRoi Jones in Newark, New Jersey, on October 7, 1934. He attended Rutgers University in Newark and Howard University in Washington, D.C., and lived in Greenwich Village, New York, in the 1950s. In 1958, Baraka founded Yugen magazine, which he co-edited with his wife, Hattie Cohen, and Totem Press. From 1961 to 1964, Baraka worked as an instructor at New York’s New School for Social Research. In 1964, he founded the Black Arts Repertory Theater/School, which dissolved in only a few months. He later taught at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, University of Buffalo, Columbia University, George Washington University, and San Francisco State University, and has served as director of the community theater, Spirit House, in Newark.\n\nIn 1961, Baraka published his first book of poetry, Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note. His second book, The Dead Lecturer, was published in 1964. Fame eluded him, however, until the publication of his play Dutchman in 1964, which received the Obie award for the best Off-Broadway play of the season. The shocking honesty of Baraka’s treatment of racial conflict in this and later plays became the hallmark of his work.\n\nWhen Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, and following the close of his theater school, Baraka moved to Harlem, divorced his white, Jewish wife, Hattie Cohen, changed his name to Amiri Baraka, and became an advocate for the black nationalist movement.\n\nIn 1967, Baraka married African American poet, Sylvia Robinson, who changed her name to Amina Baraka. In 1968, Baraka became a black Muslim and added the title Imamu (spiritual leader) to his name and led his own black Muslim organization, called the Temple of Kawaida. Baraka described this organization as an “African religious institution—to increase black consciousness.” The Temple and Baraka soon became a focal point of African American political activism in the racially polarized city of Newark. In 1972, Baraka achieved prominence in his role as chairman of the National Black Political Convention.\n\nAfter he began to espouse Marxist-Leninist philosophy and dedicated himself to the working class, Baraka dropped the title Imamu in 1974. In 1966, Baraka’s play, The Slave, won second prize in the drama category at the First World Festival of Dramatic Arts in Dakar, Senegal. Baraka’s other published plays include: The Toilet (1964); The Baptism (1966); The System of Dante’s Hell (1965); Four Black Revolutionary Plays (1969); J-E-L-L-O (1970); and The Motion of History and Other Plays (1978). He has edited, with Larry Neal, Black Fire: An Anthology of Afro-American Writing (1968) and African Congress: A Documentary of the First Modern Pan-African Congress (1972).\n\nHis works of fiction include The System of Dante’s Hell (novel, 1965) and Tales (short stories, 1967). Baraka has also published the following titles: Black Music; Blues People: Negro Music in White America; Home: Social Essays; In Our Terribleness: Some Elements and Meanings in Black Style with Billy Abernathy; Raise Race Rays Raze: Essays Since 1965; It’s Nation Time; Kawaida Studies: The New Nationalism, A Black Value System and Strategy and Tactics of a Pan African Nationalist Party; and Funk Lore: New Poems (1984–1995); Somebody Blew Up America and Other Poems (2003); and Tales of the Out and the Gone (2006).\n\nIn addition to the Obie Award, Baraka’s many literary prizes and honors include Guggenheim Foundation and National Endowment for the Arts fellowships, and the PEN/Faulkner Award.\n\nARNA W. BONTEMPS (1902–1973) Poet, Novelist, Dramatist\n\nArna Wendell Bontemps was one of the most productive African American writers of the twentieth century and a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Born in Alexandria, Louisiana, on October 13, 1902, and raised in California, Bontemps received his B.A. degree from Pacific Union College in Angwin, California, in 1923 and his M.A. degree from the University of Chicago in 1943. In 1924, his poetry first appeared in Crisis magazine, the NAACP periodical edited by W. E. B. Du Bois. Two years later, Golgotha Is a Mountain won the Alexander Pushkin Poetry Prize and, in 1927, Nocturne at Bethesda achieved first honors in the Crisis poetry contest. Personals, Bontemps’s collected poems, was published in 1963.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Bontemps decided to try his hand at prose, and over the next decade produced such novels as God Sends Sunday (1931), Black Thunder (1936), and Drums at Dusk (1939). His books for young people include We Have Tomorrow (1945) and Story of the Negro (1948). Likewise of literary merit are such children’s books as Sad-Faced Boy (1937) and Slappy Hooper (1946). He edited American Negro Poetry and two anthologies with Langston Hughes, among others.\n\nIn 1968, Bontemps completed the editing of a volume of children’s poetry. Other publications included: One Hundred Years of Negro Freedom (1961); Anyplace But Here (published in 1966 in collaboration with Jack Conroy); Black Thunder (1968 reprint); Great Slave Narratives (1969); The Harlem Renaissance Remembered: Essays (1972, 1984); and The Old South. He also edited several anthologies. In 1997, his book The Pasteboard Bandit was published posthumously. Bontemps died in Nashville on June 4, 1973, of a heart attack.\n\nGWENDOLYN BROOKS (1917–2000) Poet\n\nGwendolyn Brooks was the first African American to win a Pulitzer Prize. Brooks received this prestigious award in 1950 for Annie Allen, a volume of her poetry that had been published one year earlier. Brooks has been associated with the “black aesthetic” and the Black Arts movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Long a trailblazer, in 1985 she became the first African American woman to be appointed poetry consultant by the Library of Congress.\n\nBrooks was born on June 7, 1917, in Topeka, Kansas, but moved to Chicago at an early age. She graduated from Wilson Junior College in 1936 and identified herself with the South Side of Chicago throughout her lifetime. In 1945, she completed a book of poems, A Street in Bronzeville, and was selected by Mademoiselle magazine as one of the year’s 10 most outstanding American women. She became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1946, and received Guggenheim Fellowships for 1946 and 1947. In 1949, she won the Eunice Tietjen Prize for Poetry in the annual competition sponsored by Poetry magazine for the same work that won her that year’s Pulitzer. She was named Poet Laureate of the state of Illinois in 1968.\n\nBrooks’ insights into the potential alienation of African American life have been represented in the body of her work, which includes a collection of children’s poems, Bronzeville Boys and Girls (1956); a novel, Maud Martha (1953); and two books of poetry, The Bean Eaters (1960) and Selected Poems (1963). She has also written In the Mecca, winner of the 1968 Anisfield-Wolf Award; Riot; The World of Gwendolyn Brooks; Report from Part One: The Autobiography of Gwendolyn Brooks; Family Pictures; Beckonings; Aloneness; Primer for Blacks; To Disembark; Report from Part Two; and In Montgomery: New and Other Poems. Her poems and stories have also been published in magazines and two anthologies, Soon, One Morning and Beyond the Angry Black. The publication of Selected Poems in 1964 earned her the Robert F. Ferguson Memorial Award. She has edited A Broadside Treasury and Jump Bad, A New Chicago Anthology.\n\nAmong the other honors Brooks has received, Western Illinois University established The Gwendolyn Brooks Center for African American Literature in 1985. In 1988, she was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame. She won an Essence Award that year and a Frost Medal from the Poetry Society of America in 1990. In 1994, Brooks was named the year’s Jefferson lecturer by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the highest honor for intellectual achievement bestowed by the U.S. government. The same year, Chicago’s Harold Washington Library Center unveiled a bronze bust of Brooks prominently located in the facility, and the National Book Foundation awarded her the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and $10,000 for her lifetime of achievement. In 1995, Brooks received the National Medal of Arts from U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\nIn 2000, Brooks passed away due to complications from cancer. Survivors include her daughter, Nora Brooks Blakely; son, Henry Blakely III; and a grandson. Her husband, poet and writer Henry Blakely Jr., died in 1996.\n\nCLAUDE BROWN (1937–2002) Novelist\n\nClaude Brown was born on February 23, 1937, in New York City. His claim to literary fame rests largely on his bestselling autobiography, Manchild in the Promised Land, which was published in 1965 when he was 28 years of age. The book is the story of Brown’s life in Harlem and, in the process, becomes a highly realistic documentary of life in the ghetto. It tells of Brown’s escapades with the Harlem Buccaneers, a “bopping gang,” and of his later involvement with the Forty Thieves, an elite stealing division of this same gang.\n\nAfter attending the Wiltwyck School for emotionally disturbed and deprived boys, Brown returned to New York, was later sent to Warwick Reform School three times, and eventually made his way downtown to a small loft apartment near Greenwich Village. Changing his lifestyle, Brown finished high school and went on to graduate from Howard University in 1965.\n\nBrown began work on his autobiography in 1963, submitting a manuscript of some 1,500 pages that was eventually cut and reworked into the finished product over a two-year period. Brown completed law school in the late 1960s and began practicing in California. In 1976, he published The Children of Ham, a story about a group of young African Americans living as a family in a condemned Harlem tenement, begging, stealing, and doing whatever was necessary to survive.\n\nBrown died on February 2, 2002, in New York City, of a lung condition. He was 64.\n\nWILLIAM W. BROWN (1815–1884) Novelist, Playwright\n\nWilliam Wells Brown was the first African American to publish a novel, the first to publish a drama, and the first to publish a travel book. Born a slave in Lexington, Kentucky, on March 15, 1815, and taken to St. Louis as a young boy, Brown worked for a time in the offices of the St. Louis Times and then took a job on a riverboat on the Mississippi. In 1834, Brown fled to Canada, taking his name from a friendly Quaker who he met there. While working as a steward on Lake Erie ships, he educated himself and became well known as a public speaker. In 1849, he went to England and Paris to attend the Peace Congress, remaining abroad for five years.\n\nBrown’s first published work, The Narrative of William W. Brown (1847), went into three editions within eight months. A year later, a collection of his poems was published—The Anti-Slavery Harp—and in 1852, his travel book, Three Years in Europe, appeared in London. Brown’s Clotel, or, the President’s Daughter, a melodramatic novel about miscegenation, was first published in London in 1853. As the first novel by an African American (it subsequently went through two revisions), its historical importance transcends its aesthetic shortcomings.\n\nBrown’s other books include: the first African American drama, The Escape, or a Leap for Freedom (1858);\n\nThe Black Man: His Antecedents, His Genius, and His Achievements (1863); The Negro in the American Rebellion: His Heroism and Fidelity (1867); and The Rising Son (1874).\n\nED BULLINS (1935– ) Playwright, Essayist, Poet\n\nEd Bullins was born in Philadelphia on July 2, 1935, and grew up in Los Angeles. Bullins is a writer of drama, and one of the founders of Black Arts/West in the Fillmore District of San Francisco. He patterned this experiment after the Black Arts Repertory Theater School in Harlem, which was founded and directed by Amiri Baraka. In 1977, when Daddy, the sixth play in his “Twentieth-Century Cycle,” opened at the New Federal Theatre in New York’s Henry Street Settlement, Bullins, in an interview with the New York Times, foresaw African American theatrical producers taking plays to cities with large African American populations. A leader of the African American theater movement and creator of more than 50 plays, he has yet to have a play produced on Broadway.\n\nBullins’ main themes are the violence and tragedy of drug abuse and the oppressive lifestyle of the ghetto. He presents his material in a realistic and natural style. Between 1965 and 1968, he wrote The Rally; How Do You Do; Goin’ a Buffalo; Clara’s Old Man; The Electronic Nigger; and In the Wine Time. He has also produced The Fabulous Miss Marie.\n\nHe has been a creative member of Black Arts Alliance, working with Baraka in producing films on the West Coast. Bullins has been connected with the New Lafayette Theater in Harlem, where he was a resident playwright. His books include: Five Plays; New Plays from the Black Theatre (editor); The Reluctant Rapist; The New Lafayette Theatre Presents; The Theme Is Blackness; Four Dynamite Plays; The Duplex; The Hungered One: Early Writings; and How Do You Do: A Nonsense Drama.\n\nIn 1995, Bullins took up the position of professor of theater, and distinguished artist in residence at Northeastern University. He held this position until 2000. He is Artistic Director of the Roxbury Crossroads Theatre in Roxbury, Massachusetts.\n\nBullins is the recipient of a number of honors, awards, and fellowships, including three Obie awards for distinguished playwriting.\n\nOCTAVIA E. BUTLER (1947–2006) Novelist\n\nBorn in Pasadena, California, on June 22, 1947, Octavia Butler was a graduate of Pasadena City College. She attended science fiction workshops, including the Clarion Science Fiction Writers’ Workshop, and was a member of Science Fiction Writers of America. Her writing focused on the impact of race and gender on future society. In 1985, Butler won three of science fiction’s highest honors for her novella, Bloodchild: and Other Stories: the Nebula, Hugo, and Locus awards. She also won a Hugo in 1984 for her short story “Speech Sounds.” The 1987 novella, The Evening and the Morning and the Night, was nominated for a Nebula Award. In 1995, Butler won a MacArthur Foundation fellowship.\n\nButler’s other works include the Patternmaster series, consisting of the novels Patternmaster (1976), Mind of My Mind (1977), Survivor (1978), Wild Seed (1980), and Clay’s Ark (1984); the historical fantasy Kindred (1979); the Xenogenesis Trilogy, Dawn: Xenogenesis (1987), Adulthood Rites (1988), and Imago (1989); the dystopian Parable of the Sower (1993); and a sequel, Parable of the Talents (1998). She has also served as a contributor to such science fiction publications as Clarion, Future Life, and Isaac Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine.\n\nButler died after striking her head during a fall at her home in Lake Forest Park, Seattle, in 2006.\n\nBARBARA CHASE-RIBOUD. SEEVISUAL AND APPLIED ARTS CHAPTER.\n\nCHARLES W. CHESNUTT (1858–1932) Novelist\n\nCalled the first major African American fiction writer and the first of his race to balance African American and white characters in an African American novel, Charles Waddell Chesnutt holds a prominent place in American literary history. His best fiction dealt with the themes of prejudice, social injustice, and segregation. He handled satire entertainingly, and he was direct and insightful in his nonfiction works and speeches.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio, on June 20, 1858, Chesnutt moved to North Carolina with his family at the age of eight. Largely self-educated, he was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1887, the same year in which his first story “The Goophered Grapevine” was published in the Atlantic Monthly. This was followed in 1899 by two collections of his stories: The Conjure Woman, and The Wife of His Youth.\n\nChesnutt’s first novel, The House Behind the Cedars (1900), dealt with a young girl’s attempt to “pass” for white. A year later, The Marrow of Tradition examined the violence of the post-Reconstruction period. His final novel, The Colonel’s Dream, was published in 1905 and typified Chesnutt’s ingratiating approach to his art—an approach that the writers of the Harlem School were later to reject. Chesnutt also wrote a biography Frederick Douglass (1899). He died on November 15, 1932.\n\nALICE CHILDRESS (1920–1994) Playwright, Novelist\n\nBorn to a working-class family in Charleston, South Carolina, on October 12, 1920, but moved to and attended public school in Harlem. Actress and author Alice Childress studied acting at the American Negro Theatre and attended Radcliffe Institute from 1966 to 1968, through a Harvard University appointment as a scholar-writer. During this time, she became involved in a number of social causes. Her plays are Florence (one-act play); Gold Through the Trees; Just a Little Simple (based on Langston Hughes’s Simple Speaks His Mind); Trouble in Mind; Wedding Band; Wine in the Wilderness; and When the Rattlesnake Sounds: A Play About Harriet Tubman.\n\nChildress also edited Black Scenes (1971), excerpts from plays in the Zenith series for children. Her other books include: Like One of the Family: Conversations from a Domestic’s Life (1956); A Hero Ain’t Nothing but a Sandwich (novel, 1973)—one of her most influential and controversial works; A Short Walk (1979); Rainbow Jordan (1981); and Many Closets (1987). Childress’s play Trouble in Mind won the Obie Award in 1956, as the best original off-Broadway production. In the 1980s, she wrote a play based on the life of African American comedienne Jackie (Moms) Mabley. The play was produced in New York City. Childress was the first woman to win an Obie Award, and the first black woman to have a play professionally produced on Broadway. Childress’s work was noted for its frank treatment of racial issues, its compassionate yet discerning characterizations, and its universal appeal. Her books and plays often dealt with such controversial subjects as miscegenation and teenage drug addiction. Childress died of cancer complications on August 14, 1994.\n\nJ. CALIFORNIA COOPER (19??– ) Short Story Writer, Novelist, Playwright\n\nJoan California Cooper was born to Joseph and Maxine Cooper in Berkeley, California. She attended a technical high school and studied at San Francisco State College and the University of California. Cooper has also lived in Texas and Alaska; she currently resides in Northern California. Cooper decided to keep her first name silent; thus, she uses the initial of her first name. Cooper adopted the name “California” after an individual compared her writing to that of Tennessee Williams, who added the name of a state to his nomenclature. Cooper, who believes that age is unimportant, refuses to reveal the year of her birth. Although the public knows little about Cooper’s private life, her writing talent has brought her to the attention of the literary world.\n\nCooper once stated that she could tell stories before she could write. During her childhood, she created plays and performed them for family and friends. To date, she is the author of at least 17 plays, including Everytime It Rains; System, Suckers, and Success; How Now; The Unintended; The Mother; Ahhh; Strangers, for which Cooper was named San Francisco’s Best Black Playwright in 1978; and Loners, which is included in Eileen J. Ostrow’s Center Stage (1981). Her plays have been performed in such theaters as the Berkeley Black Repertory Theatre and the San Francisco Palace of Fine Arts; Cooper’s plays have also been performed on college campuses, public television, and radio. After Alice Walker read Cooper’s plays, she encouraged Cooper to write short stories. Cooper once commented that her stories could still be in a drawer had it not been for Walker.\n\nWalker’s publishing company, Wild Trees Press, published Cooper’s first collection of short stories, A Piece of Mine (1984). In Walker’s forward to A Piece of Mine, she wrote that “in its strong folk flavor, Cooper’s work reminds us of Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. Like theirs, her style is deceptively simple and direct, and the vale of tears in which some of her characters reside is never so deep that a rich chuckle at a foolish person’s foolishness cannot be heard.” Cooper’s second collection, Homemade Love (1986), won the 1989 American Book Award. Her subsequent short story collections are Some Soul to Keep (1987), The Matter Is Life (1991), Some Love, Some Pain, Sometime (1995), and The Future Has a Past (2000). Collectively, these six volumes contain 52 stories. She has also published a collection of stories entitled Wild Stars Seeking Midnight Suns (2006). Her short stories have been reprinted in various publications such as Daughters of Africa: An International Anthology of Words and Writings by Women of African Descent from the Ancient Egyptian to the Present (1992), edited by Margaret Busby; and Cornerstones: An Anthology of African American Literature (1996), edited by Melvin Donaldson. Cooper has published four novels: Family (1991), In Search of Satisfaction (1994), The Wake of the Wind (1998), and Some People, Some Other Place (2004).\n\nCooper’s additional awards include the Literary Lion Award and James Baldwin Award, both from the American Library Association, and she was named Woman of the Year by the University of Massachusetts and Best Female Writer in Texas. J. California Cooper is one of today’s most popular African American authors.\n\nCOUNTEE CULLEN (1903–1946) Poet\n\nBorn Countee LeRoy Porter on May 30, 1903, in Baltimore, the details of Cullen’s early life are sketchy. He was orphaned at an early age and adopted at age 15 by Rev. Frederick Cullen, pastor of New York’s Salem Methodist Church. At New York University, Cullen won Phi Beta Kappa honors and was awarded the Witter Bynner Poetry Prize. In 1925, while still a student at New York University, Cullen completed Color, a volume of poetry that received the Harmon Foundation’s first gold medal for literature two years later.\n\nIn 1926, Cullen earned his M.A. at Harvard, and a year later finished both The Ballad of the Brown Girl and Copper Sun. This was followed in 1929 by The Black Christ, written during a two-year sojourn in France on a Guggenheim fellowship. In 1927, he edited Caroling Dusk: An Anthology of Verse by Negro Poets. The book was reprinted in 1972.\n\nUpon his return to New York City, Cullen began a teaching career in the public school system. During this period, he also produced a novel, One Way to Heaven (1932), The Medea and Other Poems (1935), The Lost Zoo (1940), and My Lives and How I Lost Them (1942, 1971). Throughout his life, Cullen promoted the works of other African American writers and was a leading figure in the Harlem Renaissance. In 1947, a year after his death, Cullen’s own selections of his best work were collected in a volume published under the title On TheseI Stand. Cullen died of uremic poisoning on January 9, 1946, in New York City.\n\nSAMUEL R. DELANY (1942– ) Novelist, Literary Critic\n\nBorn in Harlem on April 1, 1942, and a published writer at the age of 19, Samuel Ray Delany is an award-winning and prolific writer of science fiction, novelettes, and novels. His first book was The Jewels of Aptor (1962), followed by Captives of the Flame (1963), The Towers of Toron (1964), City of a Thousand Suns (1965), The Ballad of Beta-2 (1965), Babel-17 (1966), Empire Star (1966), The Einstein Intersection (1967), Out of the Dead City (1968), and Nova (1968). Babel-17 and The Einstein Intersection both won Nebula awards from the Science Fiction Writers of America, as did his short stories “Aye, and Gomorrah” and “Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones,” which also won a Hugo Award at the World Science Fiction Convention in Heidelberg. Delany co-edited the speculative fiction quarterly Quark, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 with his former wife, award-winning poet Marilyn Hacker. He also wrote, directed, and edited the half-hour film, The Orchid. In 1975, Delany was Visiting Butler Chair professor of English at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In 2001, he was named professor of English and creative writing at Temple University in Philadelphia.\n\nDelany’s other books include: Distant Stars (1981); Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand (1984); Flight from Neveryon (1985); Neveryona (1986); The Bridge of Lost Desire (1988); the controversial Hogg (1996); the novella, Phallos (2004); and the novel, Dark Reflections (scheduled for 2007). His non-fiction works include: The Jewel-Hinged Jaw; The American Shore; Starboard Wine; The Straits of Messina; The Motion of Light in Water (autobiography, 1988); The Mad Man (1994); They Fly at Ciron (1995); Atlantis: Three Tales (1995); Times Square Red, Times Square Blue (1999); and Shorter Views: Queer Thoughts & the Politics of the Paraliterary (1999).\n\nRITA DOVE (1952– ) Poet, Educator\n\nRita Dove was born on August 28, 1952, in Akron, Ohio. She received a B.A. from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in 1973, and an M.F.A. degree from the University of Iowa in 1977. Dove also attended the University of Tubingen in Germany in 1974 and 1975.\n\nDove began her teaching career at Arizona State University in 1981 as an assistant professor. She spent 1982 as a writer-in-residence at Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University). By 1984, she was an associate professor and by 1987, a full professor. Dove, who has served on the editorial boards of the literary journals Callaloo, Gettysburg Review, and TriQuarterly, joined\n\nthe University of Virginia’s English Department in 1989. She teaches creative writing.\n\nDove won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for poetry for a collection titled Thomas and Beulah. Her themes are universal, encompassing much of the human condition and occasionally commenting on racial issues. She also published Yellow House on the Corner (1980), Museum (1983), Fifth Sunday (short stories, 1985), Grace Notes (1989), Selected Poems (1993), Through the Ivory Gate (novel, 1993), Mother Love (1995), The Darker Face of the Earth: A Verse Play in Fourteen Scenes (1995); and On the Bus With Rosa Parks (1999); and American Smooth (poems, 2004).\n\nIn addition to the Pulitzer Prize, Dove won many honors including Presidential scholar (1970); Fulbright scholar (1974, 1975); a literary grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (1978, 1989); Guggenheim fellow (1983, 1984); General Electric Foundation Award for Younger Poets (1987); Ohio Governor’s Award (1988); Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship (1988, 1989); University of Virginia Center for Advanced Studies fellow (1989–1992); the Walt Whitman Award (1990); and the Kennedy Center Fund for New American Plays Award for The Darker Face of the Earth (1995).\n\nDove was named U.S. Poet Laureate, a one-year Library of Congress post, in 1993. She was the first African American and the youngest person ever to earn the appointment. On April 22, 1994, PBS aired a piece entitled “Poet Laureate Rita Dove” on Bill Moyer’s Journal. She hoped to use the position to revive public interest in serious literature.\n\nPAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR (1872–1906) Poet, Novelist, Short Story Writer, Essayist\n\nThe first African American poet to gain a national reputation in the United States, Paul Laurence Dunbar was also the first to use African American dialect within the formal structure of his work. He was a precursor to the Harlem Renaissance. Born of former slaves in Dayton, Ohio, on June 27, 1872, Dunbar worked as an elevator operator after graduating from high school. His first book of poetry, Oak and Ivy, was privately printed in 1893 and was followed by Majors and Minors, which appeared two years later. Neither book was an immediate sensation, but there were enough favorable reviews in such magazines as Harper’s to encourage Dunbar in the pursuit of a full-fledged literary career. In 1896, Dunbar completed Lyrics of a Lowly Life, the single work upon which his subsequent reputation was irrevocably established.\n\nBefore his untimely death of tuberculosis in 1906, Dunbar had become the dominant presence in the world of African American poetry. His later works included: Lyrics of Sunshine and Shadow (1905); Li’l Gal (1904); Howdy, Honey, Howdy (1905); A Plantation Portrait (1905); Joggin’ Erlong (1906); and Complete Poems, published posthumously in 1913. This last work contains not only the dialect poems that were his trademark, but many poems in conventional English as well. The book enjoyed such enormous popularity that it has, to this day, never gone out of print. He also published four novels, including The Sport of Gods (1902)—considered his best, The Love of Landry (1900), and The Uncalled (1898), and four volumes of short stories.\n\nDunbar, whose work was rediscovered in the second half of the twentieth century, is sometimes referred to as the African American Alexander Pushkin or Alexander Dumas, fils.\n\nRALPH ELLISON (1914–1994) Novelist, Essayist\n\nRalph Ellison’s critical and artistic reputation rests largely on a single masterpiece, his first and only novel, Invisible Man, a story about an unnamed black man’s search for identity in 1940s New York. An instant classic, the novel was given the National Book Award for fiction in 1952 and the Russwurm Award in 1953. Years in the making, the novel’s success heralded the emergence of a major writing talent. Ellison worked at a second novel for more than 40 years, but at the time of his death, the untitled work was still incomplete.\n\nEllison was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on March 1, 1914, and came to New York City in the late 1930s, after having studied music at Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) for three years. Initially interested in sculpture, he turned to writing after coming under the influence of T.S. Eliot’s poetry and as a direct consequence of his friendship with novelist Richard Wright. He worked for the Federal Writer’s Project and wrote for a variety of publications during the late 1930s to early 1940s. In 1942, he became the managing editor of the Negro Quarterly. He began writing Invisible Man in 1945. During World War II, Ellison worked as a cook in the U.S. Merchant Marines.\n\nIn addition to the National Book Award, Ellison won a Rockefeller Foundation Award in 1954; was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters; received a Medal of Freedom from President Lyndon Johnson in 1969; was named chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et Lettres by France in 1969; and was given a National Medal of Arts in 1985. Ellison was the recipient of more than one dozen honorary degrees including doctor of letters degrees from Harvard University (1974) and Wesleyan University (1980). Three years after the publication of Invisible Man, the American Academy of Arts and Letters awarded Ellison the Prix de Rome, which enabled him to live and write in Italy until 1957.\n\nBack in the United States, Ellison began an academic career. He taught Russian and American literature courses at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, for three years and spent the early 1960s as a visiting professor at University of Chicago, Yale, and Rutgers, where he was a writer-in-residence. From 1970 to 1980, Ellison was the Albert Schweitzer Professor of Humanities at New York University.\n\nEllison’s second work was a book of essays entitled Shadow and Act. Published in 1964, excerpts from the book have been printed in several literary journals. Ellison began writing his second novel Juneteenth in 1954 and continued to revise it until he died. A 1967 fire destroyed 350 pages of his unfinished second novel’s manuscript. In 1982, the thirtieth anniversary edition of Invisible Man, with a new introduction by Ellison, was published. In 1986, a second collection of essays and talks was published as Going to the Territory. The Collected Essays of Ralph Ellison, edited by John F. Callahan, was published posthumously in 1995.\n\nEllison died of pancreatic cancer in New York City on April 16, 1994. On May 26, 1994, a memorial tribute to him was held at the American Academy of Arts and Letters in New York.\n\nMARI EVANS (1923– ) Poet\n\nBorn in Toledo, Ohio, in 1923, Evans studied at the University of Toledo. Evans is best known as a poet and social critic but also published plays, songs, and children’s books. In 1963, her poetry was published in Phylon, Negro Digest, and Dialog. Two years later, she was awarded a John Hay Whitney Fellowship. One of her better known works is The Alarm Clock, which deals with the rude awakening of the African American to the white “establishment.” This work captures and summarizes the civil rights scene of the 1960s in the United States.\n\nEvans’ books include: I Am a Black Woman; Where Is All the Music?; Black Women Writers (1950–1980): A Critical Evaluation (1984), edited by Evans, covering 15 African American women poets, novelists, and playwrights; Nightstar: Poems from 1973–1978 (1980); J. D.; I Look at Me; Singing Black; The Day They Made Benani; Jim Flying High; (co-author) Mis Taken Brilliance (1993); (co-author) Singing Black: Alternative Nursery Rhymes for Children (1998); Dear Corinne, Tell Somebody! Love, Annie: A Book about Secrets (1999); and Clarity as Concept: A Poet’s Perspective (critical essays, 2005).\n\nEvans has taught at Cornell University and Indiana University.\n\nJESSIE REDMON FAUSET (1882–1961) Writer, Editor, Educator\n\nJessie Redmon Fauset, born April 27, 1882, was a central figure during the Harlem Renaissance—and sometimes called “the Mother of the Harlem Renaissance”—not only for encouraging the careers of many of the major writers of the time, but also through her own literary contributions to the movement. In 1919, Fauset became literary editor of Crisis magazine, founded by W. E. B. Du Bois. She held that position until 1927. As an editor, Fauset excelled; under her leadership, Crisis magazine outsold its rival magazine, Opportunity, started by Charles S. Johnson. She also realized Du Bois’s plan for a periodical focusing on children six to 16 called The Brownies Book and was its functional editor.\n\nFauset’s editorial experiences and travel heightened her own sensibilities about the images of African Americans. Her writings professed an awareness of the racism and sexism that existed during the 1920s and 1930s. She contributed numerous short stories, essays, critiques, poetry, and reviews to the magazine and published her first novel There is Confusion in 1924. The book was her response to an unrealistic portrayal of African Americans by white novelist T. S. Stribling. After Fauset’s break from Crisis in 1927, she established her place as an author and published Plum Bun: A Novel without a Moral (1929), The Chinaberry Tree (1931), and Comedy, American Style (1933).\n\nFauset, who had received her B.A. from Cornell University in 1905 (Phi Beta Kappa)—the first black woman to matriculate at Cornell—and her M.A. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1919, taught at both Fisk University in the summer and in high school and college settings. In he later years, she returned to teaching, partially because the publishing world was still not ready for an African American, let alone a woman.\n\nFauset died in Philadelphia on April 30, 1961, of hypertensive heart disease. Recently, Fauset’s contribution to the dialogue about race, class, and gender have been more fully recognized in her work. She not only challenged the world of publishing with her own work but also by assisting other artists, made it possible for unrealistic and negative perceptions of African Americans to be confronted.\n\nRUDOLPH FISHER (1897–1934) Writer, Physician, Community Leader\n\nAlthough he was a radiologist, Rudolph Fisher was best known as a leading writer during the Harlem Renaissance. Fisher wrote short stories and novels that depicted real life in the Harlem community and was also the first African American to write detective fiction.\n\nFisher was born on May 9, 1897, in Washington, D.C. He grew up in a middle-class family who saw that he was rigorously educated at primary and secondary schools in Providence, Rhode Island, and New York City. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Brown University with B.A. and M.A. degrees. In 1924, Fisher\n\ngraduated summa cum laude from Howard University Medical School in Washington. During his medical internship at Freedmen’s Hospital in the same city, he published his first short story, “The City of Refuge,” in the Atlantic Monthly.\n\nContinuing his medical education, from 1925 to 1927 Fisher trained at Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons. He entered private practice and continued his writing as well, publishing five short stories in Atlantic Monthly and McClure’s, an essay in American Mercury, and an article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n\nFisher published his first novel, The Walls of Jericho, in 1928. In the novel, Fisher blends all of Harlem life into one story and bridges the gap between the classes. The Conjure-Man Dies: A Mystery Tale of Dark Harlem (1932) was his second novel and the first full-length detective novel with all-African American characters published by an African American author. Fisher published two children’s stories in 1932 and 1933, Ezekiel and Ezekiel Learns, and in 1933, he published two short stories “Guardians of the Law” and “Miss Cynthie.” The latter work also appeared in Best Short Stories of 1934.\n\nIn addition to his writing career, Fisher was superintendent of the International Hospital in Manhattan from 1929 to 1932 and was also a gifted musician. Between 1930 and 1934, he was a roentgenologist for the New York City Health Department and served in the 369th Infantry. He died of cancer on December 16, 1934, in New York City.\n\nCHARLES FULLER (1939– ) Playwright\n\nCharles Fuller was born on March 5, 1939, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He became stage struck in his high school days when he went to the Old Walnut Street Theater in his native Philadelphia and saw a Yiddish play starring Molly Picon and Menasha Skulnik. He did not understand a word of it, saying “but it was live theater, and I felt myself responding to it.”\n\nIn 1959, Fuller entered the army and served in Japan and South Korea, after which he attended Villanova University and La Salle College. While Fuller was working as a housing inspector in Philadelphia, the McCarter Theater in Princeton, New Jersey produced his first play, The Village: A Party (1968), also known as The Perfect Party. The theme concerned interracial marriage, and its creator later tagged it “one of the world’s worst interracial plays.” However, during this time he met members of The Negro Ensemble Company (NEC) and, in 1974, he wrote his first play, In the Deepest Part of Sleep, for them. For NEC’s tenth anniversary, Fuller wrote The Brownsville Raid about the African American soldiers who were dishonorably discharged on President Teddy Roosevelt’s orders in 1906 after a shootout in Brownsville, Texas. The play was a hit, and Fuller followed it a few seasons later with Zooman and the Sign, a melodrama that won two Obie awards.\n\nA Soldier’s Play, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1982, was his fourth play for The Negro Ensemble Company. This drama dealing with a murder set in a backwater New Orleans army camp in 1944, opened NEC’s 15th anniversary season in 1981 with a long run and was hailed by the New York Times as “tough, taut and fully realized.” A Soldier’s Play became A Soldier’s Story when it was produced as a film in 1984 by Columbia Pictures. Fuller wrote the screenplay, and African American actor Howard E. Rollins Jr. was the film’s star. In 1999, Fuller wrote and produced a three-part interlocking script called Love Songs for Showtime. The three different sections featured Louis Gossett Jr., Robert Townsend, and Andre Braugher.\n\nThe recipient of the Guggenheim Foundation fellowship, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts and CAPS fellowships in playwriting, Fuller describes himself as a playwright who happens to be African American, rather than an African American playwright.\n\nERNEST J. GAINES (1933– ) Novelist, Short Story Writer\n\nErnest J. Gaines was born on a plantation in Oscar, Louisiana, on January 15, 1933. The rural folk culture of this area has always played an important role in his fiction. He moved to California in 1949, where he did his undergraduate study at San Francisco State College. In 1959, he received the Wallace Stegner Fellowship in creative writing. The following year, he was awarded the Joseph Henry Jackson Literary Award.\n\nGaines’ first novel was Catherine Carmier (1964). Others followed, including Of Love and Dust (1967), Barren Summer (completed in 1963, but never published), The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman (1971), A Warm Day in November (for young people), and In My Father’s House (1978). Ironically, the book, The Autobiography of Jane Pittman, was banned in a Conroe, Texas, seventh-grade racial tolerance course in 1995; the school censored the work, citing the liberal use of racial slurs. The 1974 television production of The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, starring Cicely Tyson, boosted Gaines’ reputation. Gaines’ A Gathering of Old Men, published in 1983, was made into a movie as well. In 1994, Gaines’ 1993 work, A Lesson Before Dying, won the National Book Critics Circle award for fiction. A Lesson Before Dying was also adapted for the small screen by HBO in 1999 and won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Made-for-Television Movie. Mozart and Leadbelly: Stories and Essays was published in 2005.\n\nHENRY LOUIS GATES, JR. (1950– ) Literary critic, Scholar, Educator\n\nHenry Louis Gates, Jr. was born in Keyser, West Virginia, on September 16, 1950. His father, Henry Louis Sr., who was a gifted storyteller, worked at the local paper mill; his mother cleaned houses in addition to raising her two children and was actively involved in her children’s education.\n\nInitially enrolling in Potomac State College, Gates later transferred to Yale, where he graduated with a B.A. in History. At Yale, Gates volunteered at a mission hospital in Tanzania and traveled throughout Africa in fulfillment of the non-academic portion of his degree requirement.\n\nGates then traveled to Cambridge University, where he studied English literature and, with the aid of a Ford Foundation Fellowship, worked toward his M.A. and Ph.D. in English. At Cambridge, he met the Nigerian playwright Wole Soyinka, who was denied an appointment because, at the time, African literature was not considered “real literature.” Soyinka, who later went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, became Gates’ mentor.\n\nAfter dropping out of the Yale Law School and working as a secretary in the Afro-American Studies department, in 1976 Gates became a lecturer, then an Assistant Professor in the department. Denied tenure at Yale, Gates went on to teach at Cornell University, Duke University, then Harvard, where he was appointed Professor of the Humanities and English. He is also Chair of the African and African American Studies department and directs the W.E.B. DuBois Institute for African and African American Research. In 2006, Gates was named Alphonse Fletcher, Jr. University Professor at Harvard.\n\nIn addition to Gates’ many honors and awards, Gates was named a MacArthur Foundation Fellow in 1981. Gates, a literary theorist, cultural critic, and historian dedicated preserving the texts of African and African American writers and artists, published The Signifying Monkey in 1988. This seminal work, which attempted to define a black cultural aesthetic, won the 1989 American Book Award. Gates’ position between separatist and traditionalist perspectives in his approach to integrating African American literature into the canon of Western literature has stirred controversy on both sides of the cultural spectrum.
