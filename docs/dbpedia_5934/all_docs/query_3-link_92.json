        "text": "Innovation\n\nCovid-19: Groupe ADP and Choose Paris Region agency are launching the \"Safe Travel Challenge\" call for innovative projects\n\nWith the support of the Ile-de-France Region, this call for projects stems from a partnership between Groupe ADP and Choose Paris Region, the agency dedicated to promoting and building the international attractiveness of Ile-de-France.\n\nCalling all innovative startups and SMEs to step forward, it is aimed at identifying, qualifying and testing new solutions that will help support the gradual resumption of air traffic, while rebuilding trust in passengers, throughout their journey from their homes to the airport, as well as in the professionals working on these platforms.\n\nWith lockdown being gradually lifted and the economic recovery beginning, the Ile-de-France region, Groupe ADP and Choose Paris Region decide, in order to pave the way for the future, to draw on the rich economic fabric formed by innovative startups and SMEs, both French and international.\n\n\"This crisis forces us to rethink the way we live and our mobility, with guarantees for the health of passengers and airports employees. This is the king of call for projects we need to innovate and implement the relaxation of lockdown\", said Valérie Pécresse, Président of Ile-de-France Region.\n\nDigital technology and innovation will thus be put to work new solutions in the face of the public health challenge, on the unique testing ground offered by airports, the main entry and exit gateway into national territory. Beyond the airport sector, the technologies identified and the experimental projects resulting from them will need to benefit all the players along the transport value chain.\n\n\"Air industry is now faced with a new challenge. We need to cope with the pandemic while allowing air traffic to gradually resume, so that citizens can confidently make their way back to the airports. It will take collective intelligence and all the talents in the ecosystem from innovates startups and SMEs. Through this partnership, we want to speed up solutions that will have proved themselves in the airport, an essential link in the tourism recovery chain and could be useful to the sector as a whole, to invent together the future of travel\", said Augustin de Romanet, Chairman and CEO of Groupe ADP.\n\nThe competition's three themes will be as follows:\n\nPrevention – helping people adopt virus-halting behaviors, cleaning internal and external areas, etc.;\n\nDetection – solutions for places with large number of visitor, rapid individual detection technologies, etc.;\n\nDevelopment of new services – voice-controlled surfaces, non-touch payment methods, on-line purchases, etc.\n\nOpen to innovative French and international startups and SMEs, the competition is intented for already-mature solutions, so that the selected projects can be quickly deployed. Companies have until May 20th to apply. Before the final, which will run from May 26 to 28, three projects will be selected by theme: the two most promising will be rapidly tested and the prototypes may be selected for joint financing by the Ile-de-France Region and Groupe ADP. The entrepreneurs will also be offered the assistance and operational expertise of Groupe ADP as well as support from Choose Paris Region. The entirety of the call for projects, including the submission of applications and final, will take place digitally.\n\n\"Thanks to this call for projects, we want to make a very concrete contribution to our economy's recovery through new technological solutions that facilitate the mobility of goods and individuals \", said Franck Margain, Chairman of Choose Paris Region.\n\nIn order that this call for projects can also serve the challenges of the sector as a whole, the jury will be made up of representatives of airlines, mobility and tourism players, and healthcare professionals.\n\nRead the details at safetravelchallenge.com\n\nSee more No more content"
