On their website the only email they provide is the standard customer service email for TFL (they have no email that goes directly to themselves). However i am needing to contact them in regards to route 400 (Staines to Walton On Thames) which is their one and only non TFL bus route. It is a Surrey County Council contact and has nothing to do with TFL. But as London United also operate a very large amount of TFL routes i presume that you must have a contact email address for them. So please can you provide me with any email address that you have that goes directly to London United (RATP Group) bus company. Many thanks.\r\n\nYours faithfully,\r\n\nBrian Davis",

Many thanks.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nBrian Davis\n\nDear Mr Davis\n\nWe do not consider that your request constitutes a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nTo obtain specific contact details of a particular bus operator we would recommend you contact the operator directly using the contact details available on their website at the following link: http://www.ratpdevlondon.co.uk/garages.h...\n\nYours sincerely\n\nLee Hill\n\nInformation Access Manager\n\nshow quoted sections\n\nDear FOI,\n\nI would like to request an internal review please in regards to this request that i made. My request definitely constitutes as an FOI Request as i am requesting information that you are very likely to hold that is not available publicly. The link that you provided only gives phone numbers and i clearly requested an email address. As you contract out many of your bus routes to London United (RATP Group) i am sure that you have a direct email address for them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBrian Davis\n\nDear Mr Davis\n\nTfL Ref: 1165-819\n\nThank you for your request received by Transport for London (TfL) on 27\n\nJuly 2018 asking for information about any email addresses that we have\n\nfor London United (RATP Group) bus company .\n\nYour request will be processed by TfL, the Greater London Authority and\n\nits subsidiaries to provide you with a response in accordance with the\n\nFreedom of Information Act 2000 and our information access policy.\n\nA response will be sent to you by 28 August. We publish a substantial\n\nrange of information on our website on subjects including operational\n\nperformance, contracts, expenditure, journey data, governance and our\n\nfinancial performance. This includes data which is frequently asked for in\n\nFOI requests or other public queries. Please check\n\n[1]http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/transpar... to see if this helps you.\n\nWe will publish anonymised versions of requests and responses on the\n\nwww.tfl.gov.uk website. We will not publish your name and we will send a\n\ncopy of the response to you before it is published on our website.\n\nIn the meantime, if you would like to discuss this matter further, please\n\ndo not hesitate to contact me.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nSara Thomas\n\nFOI Case Management Team\n\nGeneral Counsel\n\nTransport for London\n\nshow quoted sections\n\nDear Mr Davis\n\nTfL Ref: 1165-1819\n\nThank you for your email received on 27 July 2018 as below.\n\nYour request was initially determined to be a general enquiry for contact\n\ndetails of a third party, rather than a specific request for recorded\n\ninformation. However, as you have specified this should be processed as an\n\nFOI request I can confirm that your request has been processed in\n\naccordance with the requirements of the Freedom of Information and our\n\ninformation access policy. I can confirm we do hold the information you\n\nrequire.\n\nWe do not hold any ‘customer enquiry’ email addresses but do hold the\n\ndirect contact addresses of some individuals that work for this company.\n\nHowever, please note that in accordance with TfL’s obligations under Data\n\nProtection legislation we are not obliged to provide the requested\n\ninformation, as required by section 40(2) of the FOI Act. This is because\n\ndisclosure of this personal data would be a breach of Article 5 (1)(a) of\n\nthe General Data Protection Regulation, which requires personal data to be\n\nprocessed lawfully, fairly and transparently. It would not be fair to\n\ndisclose this personal information when the individuals have no\n\nexpectation it would be disclosed and TfL has not satisfied one of the\n\nconditions in Article 6 necessary to determine that the processing is\n\n‘lawful’.\n\nPlease see the attached information sheet for details of your right to\n\nappeal\n\nYours sincerely\n\nSara Thomas\n\nFOI Case Management Team\n\nGeneral Counsel\n\nTransport for London\n\nshow quoted sections"
