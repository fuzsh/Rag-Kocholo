Responsible for 70 bus routes across the London network with services running from ten operational garages based in; Edgware, Epsom, Fulwell, Harrow, Hounslow, Hounslow Heath, Park Royal, Shepherd’s Bush, Stamford Brook and Tolworth.\n\nEFD has been supplying all the ten RATP Dev London garages their PPE / Workwear since 2009.\n\nThrough managing and maintaining the agreed levels of stock EFD provide RATP Dev London with a fast and effective service for all their Hi Viz / PPE requirements.\n\nIn 2015, EFD presented a fit for purpose range of garments for the company’s Controllers. The range of garments took into consideration the Controllers varied range of working conditions, whilst ensuring they looked smart and professional at all times.\n\nOnce the range had been approved, EFD visited each of the ten locations across London with a complete garment fitting set. The dates and times were agreed with each of the garages to ensure all Controllers could be seen.\n\nEach Controller had the opportunity to view the range, choose their garments and be professionally measured by the EFD team. This was to ensure that the correct size was ordered for each of the Controllers.\n\nWithin three weeks of the site visits, the Controllers issue was delivered. Each Controller had their complete order individually packed and delivered to their place of work.\n\nFollow up garage visits took place to ensure that all the Controllers were happy with their garments.\n\nSince November 2015, EFD has been successfully supplying all the RATP Dev London Controllers their uniform, and by managing the stock levels a quick and efficient service is provided."
