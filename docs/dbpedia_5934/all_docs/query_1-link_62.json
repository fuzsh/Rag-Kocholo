        "text": "A party of five is visiting from Madrid, Spain. Should they rent a car, take the RER, take a bus? These are questions one normally asks when arriving in a new city. The answer? Share a taxi (van) from G7 sharing: one price (currently 45 euros), one destination, reserve on line.\n\nShould they rent a car or take the RER C to Versailles palace: Buy a Mobilis ticket and take the RER C. Name the scenario and the RATP has a solution.\n\nVisiting Paris is RATP’s Parisian kit with numerous hints to explore, including a helpful app “without eating up all your data!”.\n\nFrom this station to that station.\n\nMetro, RER and Tram information on “RATP News” at the RATP. Follow their tweets at @GroupeRATP\n\nThe RATP is the Régie autonome des transports parisiens and was created in 1949 to insure and oversee all public transportation. Up until 1944, the companies were private enterprises.\n\nThe RATP pages below are mostly available in French, English and Spanish. Some include other languages. UseGoogle Translate for French pages and each subsequent page is automatically translated.\n\nUse Navigo for Weekend and Holiday Advantages\n\nRATP information\n\nTickets and passes catered for you\n\nRATP tickets explained\n\nPlanning your itinerary\n\nRATP under 26\n\nRATP apps for smartphones\n\nAirports\n\nLe Bus Direct – Paris Aeroports (Formerly Cars Air France)\n\nBetween Paris and The Airports\n\nBack and forth to the airports with buses, trams, RER, shuttle (Charles de Gaulle-Roissy CDG, ORLY, Beauvais)\n\nRATP Transportation Maps\n\nRER (airports, Versailles, Disney, day trips outside Paris centre, etc.)\n\nWhen using the RER to reach Paris or starting in Paris for another destination (airport, for example) your RER ticket is valid for a metro transfer (but not for a bus transfer). Even if you leave the RER station, your ticket is valid.\n\nTransilien/SNCF Website for general route planning outside Paris (available in French, English and Spanish)\n\nReally cool page is the “Tourism in Paris and Surrounding Region” – history of châteaux (castles) and directions\n\nAccessible stations in 2017\n\nTransilien/SNCF map of Ile-de-France network map (includes all RERs)\n\nWhen using the RER to reach Paris or starting in Paris for another destination (airport, for example) your RER ticket is valid for a metro transfer (but not for a bus transfer). Even if you leave the RER station, your ticket is valid.\n\nRATP – Metro Interactive Map\n\nRATP Traffic information (in French only)\n\nRATP Grand Plan Bus avec rues (with streets)\n\nRATP Grand Plan Metro avec rues (with streets)\n\nBuying Train Tickets to Italy\n\nHow do I get from A to B?\n\nFind a Taxi\n\nCatch the Montmartre Electric Bus (Montmartrobus)\n\nSightseeing\n\nRATP Open Tour bus – now goes 100% electric (I prefer Open Tour because it is part of RATP and stops at selected, regular bus stops)\n\nRATP History\n\nHistory of Paris metro names (Metro.Paris – A Ticket for Paris – History of Names from RATP)\n\nSightseeing in the metro – .pdf document from the old Web site\n\nArchi-bus “promotes contemporary Parisian heritage”. Download the bus maps. The Paris Tourist Office Pyramides may still have hard copy maps.\n\nParis Tourist Office sightseeing/free tourist guide books are free at their offices or available for download on line.\n\nI found that the QR Code Reader on iTunes (free) is very handy for traveling by bus in Paris. Bus stops have a GPS connection and the next two buses register your wait time.\n\nPaying for your ticket\n\nUse Euros in cash or change at the ticket dispenser in the metro For US credit cards, even with a chip, go to the window.\n\nCredit cards without the smart chip (puce) are permitted at the metro information window. The attendants are getting better with their English to answer your questions.\n\nTicket t+ tips\n\nThe carnet is a pack of ten tickets. The “Ticket t+” are good for Paris transportation: buses, metros, electric bus through Montmartre (Montmartrobus), the tramway, and the RERs within Paris. You have 90 minutes to make transfers using the same ticket from a carnet. Tickets purchased on the bus are not valid for transfers.\n\nIf you have not been to Paris before and especially with children, it might be fun to see the city from the top of a double decker bus. I recommend L’Open Tour because of its numerous stops along regular bus routes and its scenic routes. There is an advantage of l’Open Tour along regular stops. With your “Ticket t+“, you can decide to visit a part of town not on the Open Tour route. Keep in mind you have 90 minutes to make transfers using the same ticket from a carnet. Tickets purchased on the bus are not valid for transfers.\n\nIf you plan four days in Paris, I would suggest buying a ticket on the Open Tour bus for two days and use it as your sightseeing vehicle or the weekly pass Navigo Semaine. It has more stops than Les Cars Rouges. Read more and look at the routes on their Web sites. Otherwise, the Mobilis (day card) is a great value.\n\nSightseeing Outside Paris with Transilien (trains) using the Navigo Monthly or Annual Passes.\n\nChateau de Versailles (RER C – Direction Versailles-Rive Gauche)"
