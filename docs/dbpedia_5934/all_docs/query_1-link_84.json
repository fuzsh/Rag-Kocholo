As a dynamic sensing platform, Spot provides valuable insights into routine operations, site health, or potentially hazardous situations. With Spot, your team can focus on the things that matter most, while staying out of harm's way.\n\nSpot is easy to use and intuitive to learn, making it quick to deploy for both manual operations and autonomous missions. You can generate immediate value for your organization with pre-configured packages for inspection, research, and hazardous response. Or, if you want to think out-of-the box, Spot's 14kg of payload capacity, robust API, and comprehensive documentation allow you to equip it for your specific needs no matter your application.\n\nWhether you are operating one Spot or an entire fleet, from six feet or six hundred miles away, we offer the complete solution for an enterprise deployment. Our software helps you manage your fleet and makes your data accessible in one place, with flexible communication options to keep you connected and informed. Boston Dynamics' support and service teams are available with training and resources to jumpstart your journey with Spot and enable ongoing success.\n\nExtensive testing in the lab and field has created a robot that you can trust to work day-in and day-out. Spot can operate without interventionsâ€”autonomously charging, dynamically replanning around new obstacles, and self-righting if it falls. With over 1,500 robots in customer hands today, you can rest assured that Spot is a dependable coworker that delivers consistent results."
