        "text": "Citylink Buses\n\nThe Citylink buses are rolling! All ten are equipped with bike racks and wheelchair tie-downs. The two Expresslink buses seat 30 passengers and are fueled with clean diesel. The eight local route and paratransit buses can carry 19 passengers and are currently fueled with gasoline. The two mini-vans are used for the paratransit service and are equipped with wheelchair tie-downs.\n\nCAP, Citywide Access Paratransit\n\nCAP is a free curb-to-curb service in which a wheelchair-accessible Citylink bus or van comfortably transports disabled and senior residents to appointments within the Edmond city limits and within ¾ mile of a fixed route. The fixed route does not include the 100X, a commuter route from Edmond to downtown Oklahoma City.\n\nIf you are a visitor to our city and have ADA complementary paratransit service documentation from another transit agency, Citylink will provide paratransit service within ¾ mile of our fixed route services. Visitors should call during business hours at least one day in advance to schedule a trip.\n\nIf you need any information in another language, please call Citylink at (405) 509-6370.\n\nTitle VI Anti-Discrimination Provisions\n\nCAPS Application\n\nRATP Dev\n\nIn 2021, the City of Edmond, through a competitive process, chose RATP Dev to operate Citylink. Their reputation for exceptional customer service and safety, as well as expertise in developing effective and efficient services, are just a few of the reasons RATP Dev was chosen to operate Citylink.\n\nBenefits of Public Transportation"
