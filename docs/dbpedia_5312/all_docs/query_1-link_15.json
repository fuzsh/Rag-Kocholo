        "text": "Ms. Joneâs podcast is my best podcast find of 2023, and I found *many* awesome podcasts in 2023! Since I first found Playing Along, Iâve listened to nearly every episode youâve put out and enjoyed every one of themâeven the suggestions episode you and Ms. Oda did together was a great listen! Yes, itâs great fun to listen to musicians and how you all approach your work. I love jazz. I used to live 15 minutes drive from Yoshiâs Oakland and spent a decade hearing many amazing jazz musicians. But a dozen or so years ago, I moved to a rural town many hoursâ drive from the nearest jazz club and I desperately miss going to live jazz performances. What I love most about âPlaying Alongâ is the wonderful improvisational vibe, no matter the musical genre the guest favors!\n\nIâm not a musician nor do I have any musical talent. In my working life, I was a software engineer and systems analyst for over twenty years. My job often involved coordinating efforts in large projects and connecting the voice of the ultimate users of our projectsâ efforts to my software-engineering coworkers. After 22 years of that, I went back to grad school in Environmental Sciences and I now teach and research in biology and how my biology research relates to research across economics, politics, engineering, and other aspects of the Environmental Sciences. The common thread throughout my working life is collaboration and helping make a space where that collaboration can take place. None of what Iâve done in my life is anything like the world of music presented by this podcast. So I also love this podcast because Ms. Jones and Ms. Oda have created the most amazing master class in collaboration I can ever imagine! Thank you so, so much for this!!!!\n\nWho would I like to hear on the podcast? Iâm among the many who would love to hear Norah Jones and Bonnie Raitt playing together. Lana Del Rey would be fabulousâI first found Ms. Del Reyâs music through my students and would love to get broader sense of who she is. Hearing Norah Jones and Diana Krall would be the very best! I adored the episode with Quest Love and Christian McBrideâother combos like that forming impromptu trios would be utterly amazing! And I would also love to hear Norah Jones with Jim CampilongoâI went to grammar school with Jim and would love to hear him chatting and making music with Norah! In your âsuggestionsâ podcast, you and Ms. Oda talked about how elaborate your job producing these podcasts is. Could you do an episode that takes us inside how that production works? It might be just too wonky for most peoplesâ interests, but Iâd love to hear more about how you go through that process! And maybe in some future episodes, highlight some of the interesting sidewomen/sidemen youâve played withâfolks we wouldnât ordinarily hear much about.\n\nOne last thought. Have you ever done that mental game of imagining who would be sitting around your ideal dinner-party table? Norah Jones and Sarah Oda are definitely sitting at that imaginary table!"
