The document discusses the different types of Christian songs used in churches. There are generally considered to be five main types: 1) Declarative songs that declare God's praises and works, 2) Confessional songs where Christians express thanks to God and confess sins, 3) Prophetic songs that speak God's message to the church, 4) Celebratory songs that aim to connect and uplift the congregation, and 5) Free style songs that incorporate spontaneous singing and prayer set to music. The document provides examples for each type and notes that many songs incorporate elements of multiple types.",
