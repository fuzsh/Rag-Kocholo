        "text": "I used to love listening to the podcast as it was often theology driven. Since about 2 years ago the views I hear seem to be the same views I can hear if I listen to MSNBC or CNNs view on the Bible for the most part. The language used by the hosts and the guests is often very much cultures view of Christianity. It just seems a little too convenient to always trash evangelicals and never discuss the issues mainline denominations face. If they ever say a bad word itâs about evangelicals and never against any other viewpoint and it grows tiring to hear partisan views. I used to feel challenged by the podcast not itâs just another form of the same noise I hear from most other media outlets. Sadly, one do the frequent things they say is how bad evangelicals are for their beliefs and one reason is because âevangelicals are too critical of opposing viewsâ and it feels like the pot calling the kettle if you know what I mean. I just had to finally unsubscribe and write this review after listening to about 80% of the episodes as I went back and listened from the beginning episodes available. Iâd recommend the older ones but anything post 2019 feels like itâs talking points for a liberal theology with no critique of a left wing view and consistent critique of a right wing view. More balance is needed in my opinion."
