Think Less. During the winter of 2023, pianist and composer Stephan Moccio traded his home of Los Angeles for the South of France to record his album Legends, Myths and Lavender, far away from the hustle and bustle of metropolitan chaos at the iconic Chateau Miraval. Stephan Moccio: 'Three things I'm most passionate about — music, wine, and architecture — combined into this experience'.\n\n26 APRIL 2024\n\nFear No More\n\nBrindley Sherratt, bass; Julius Drake, piano\n\nDelphian Records DCD34313\n\nRelease: 26 April 2024\n\nBrindley Sherratt's pre-eminence as an operatic bass is the result of two daring career shifts. Initially trained as a trumpeter, he gave up his first instrument as a student to become a singer. Yet even then, it was only in his mid-thirties that he left the professional security of a position in the BBC Singers to explore the world of opera. Now, the voyage of discovery continues as Sherratt turns to the intimate medium of the song recital. With the superb pianist Julius Drake as collaborator, in Fear No More Sherratt draws on all of his accumulated technical and expressive wisdom to traverse death-haunted songs by Schubert, Mussorgsky and Richard Strauss before arriving at a final group of five twentieth-century English songs in which consolation and acceptance are the keynotes.\n\n5 APRIL 2024\n\nThe Golden Age of Hollywood - Concert Works for Violin and Piano\n\nPatrick Savage, violin; Martin Cousin, piano\n\nQuartz\n\nRelease: 5 April 2024\n\nA remarkable album of concert works by legendary composers of Hollywood's Golden Age will be released on the Quartz label on 5 April, 2024. The recording features music for violin and piano by Erich Korngold, Franz Waxman, Bernard Herrmann, Miklós Rózsa, Robert Russell Bennett, Jerome Moross and Heinz Roemheld. Much of the music is rarely heard and the album features three first recordings. Australian-born violinist Patrick Savage researched and compiled the program during COVID Lockdowns and performs the works alongside pianist Martin Cousin. Formerly Principal First Violin for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and first violin in the Tippett Quartet, Patrick is now a free-lance concertmaster, soloist, studio session player and West End musician. He is also a composer for feature film, theatre and video games, and his film scores include the cult horror The Human Centipede and the forthcoming puppet horror, Abruptio. Each of the composers represented on this album were Academy Award-winners or nominees and made an extraordinary contribution to the art of film scoring during Hollywood's Golden Age - the heady years of frenetic film production from the 1920s to the 1960s. Between them they composed scores for some of the most famous cinema of the era. Extraordinary music-makers were drawn to Los Angeles from across the United States and around the world, including those forced to flee the rise of Nazism in Europe. But even the most gifted of composers that made their name in cinema often faced an uphill battle for acceptance in the classical world. Professional jealousy may have been a factor, as well as snobbery: how could a composer for popular entertainment be taken seriously as an artist? This prejudice led to music of great value remaining in obscurity, but despite a resurgence of interest in film composers of those years, the works by Herrmann, Roemheld and Moross are recorded here for the first time.\n\nRandall Goosby: Roots (Deluxe Edition)\n\nDecca Classics (digital only)\n\nRelease: 5 April 2024\n\nRoots is an exploration of the music written by Black composers and inspired by Black American culture. The album is a homage to the pioneering musicians who paved the way for Goosby and his generation of young artists. The new deluxe edition features 5 un-released extra tracks including 'Louisiana Blues Strut', 'Elfentanz' as well as 'Here's One' and 'Hold Fast To Dreams' - a duet with Carlos Simon.\n\n29 MARCH 2024\n\nStainer: The Crucifixion\n\nChoir of St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh / Duncan Ferguson\n\nDelphian Records DCD34275\n\nRelease: 29 March 2024\n\nJohn Stainer made it his life's work to reform and renew the standards of music in schools, parish churches, colleges and cathedrals up and down the land. His two most lasting legacies are our thriving cathedral choral tradition and this piece - The Crucifixion. Intended to be accessible, and full of the zeal and emotion of the reforming High Church, Stainer's meditation on the Passion was immediately taken up in both Britain and America, and is as popular today as ever. Here, Duncan Ferguson and the Choir of St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh are joined by two rising-star Scottish soloists and, in the hymns, by a nave-full of local young musicians and the cathedral's own worshippers to create a true sense of the musical community spirit that the composer had in mind.\n\n22 MARCH 2024\n\nVaughan Williams: Serenade to Music\n\nAlbion Records ALBCD059\n\nRelease: 22 March 2024\n\nThis is an 'archive' recording comprising 78 rpm discs newly remastered for this album by Peter Reynolds of Reynolds masting. The album includes the first, 1938, recording of Vaughan Williams's Serenade to Music, set down just a few days after the first performance. Of course, that recording is well known; it even made an appearance on an earlier Albion album, though it has been remastered for the album from another 78rpm copy. Serenade to Music was written for sixteen named singers, and they are the performers here, conducted by Sir Henry Wood (for whose fiftieth anniversary as a conductor the work was commissioned) and accompanied by the BBC Symphony Orchestra. What makes the new album unique is that it explores, for the first time, those sixteen singers, who were well known, even popular, in their day, through recording of other works. These cover the range from drawing room ballads to grand opera. Thus, before you get to the Serenade, which is track 17, you can hear each of the 16 voices for whom it was written. A 'bonus' track 18 deals with one singer, Sir Keith Falkner, who worked closely with both Sir Henry Wood and Ralph Vaughan Williams, and would unquestionably have been one of the sixteen had he not been working in America at the crucial time in October 1938. I believe that as many as eight of the tracks on the album have not been re-released in a modern format before, and there are several more not currently commercially available. Some of these are fascinating; I've developed one or two personal favourites including Amy Woodforde-Finden's A Request and a piece called Serenade by Sir Granville Bantock. Dame Eva Turner's Vissi d'Arte from Tosca is a tour de force.\n\nGershwin Rhapsody\n\nJean-Yves Thibaudet, Michael Feinstein\n\nDecca Classics\n\nCommemorating the 1924 premiere of Rhapsody in Blue, pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet collabs with Michael Feinstein, the 'one-man encyclopedia of the Great American Songbook to release Gershwin Rhapsody. The two also perform a Gershwin-esque setting of Vincent Youman's classic tune, 'ea for Two and the program rounds off with Jasbo Brown Blues from Porgy & Bess.\n\nRachmaninoff: All-Night Vigil\n\nIgor Morozov; Evgeny Kachurovsky; Alexis V Lukianov; PaTRAM Institute Male Choir / Ekaterina Antonenko\n\nChandos Records CHSA 5349 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 22 March 2024\n\nIn celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of Rachmaninoff, PaTRAM Institute Male Choir invites you to experience the extraordinary beauty of his choral tour de force, the All-Night Vigil. The arrangements for male voice choir add a darker sonority to this powerful work.\n\n15 MARCH 2024\n\nBruckner from the Archives Vol 1\n\nSOMM Recordings SOMM 5025\n\nRelease: 15 March 2024\n\nA major new, six-double-CD-volume series celebrating the 200th anniversary of Anton Bruckner's birth in 1824. Conceived and designed by SOMM Executive Producer and acclaimed Audio Restoration Engineer Lani Spahr with support from the Bruckner Society of America, the series features rare archival recordings of Bruckner's 11 symphonies and selected other important works, many appearing for the first time in any form. Recordings have been sourced from the more than 11,000 Bruckner performances in the Archive of John F Berky, Executive Secretary of the Bruckner Society of America, who also acts as Consultant for this important series. Across the series, authoritative notes by Professor Benjamin M Korstvedt, Jeppson Professor of Music at Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, President of the Bruckner Society of America and member of the Editorial Board of the New Anton Bruckner Complete Edition, trace Bruckner's life and compositional development from the Symphony in F minor (1862) to the unfinished Ninth Symphony (1894). Volume 1 (SOMM 5025) will be released on 15 March 2024 and includes two Symphonies: in F minor (Bruckner Orchestra, Linz conducted by Kurt Wöss) and No 1 in C minor, 'Linz' (Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Eugen Jochum); Bruckner's only String Quartet (Koeckert Quartet); Psalm 112 (Vienna Akademie Kammerchor, Vienna Symphony Orchestra, Henry Swoboda); the Overture in G minor (WDR Symphony Orchestra, Cologne, Dean Dixon); the March in D minor, and Three Pieces for Orchestra (Vienna Symphony Orchestra, Hans Weisbach).\n\nTchaikovsky: Orchestral Works, Vol 2 - Hamlet; Capriccio italien; Fatum; Introduction to 'The Queen of Spades'; Excerpts from 'The Oprichnik' and 'The Snow Maiden'\n\nBBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra / Alpesh Chauhan\n\nChandos Records CHSA 5331 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 15 March 2024\n\nAlpesh Chauhan conducts the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in this second album of Tchaikovsky. As with the first volume, he again mixes well-known with less-often-heard works.\n\n8 MARCH 2024\n\nMozart: Piano Concertos, Vol 9\n\nJean-Efflam Bavouzet, piano; Manchester Camerata / Gábor Takács-Nagy\n\nChandos Records CHAN 20286\n\nRelease: 8 March 2024\n\nJean-Efflam Bavouzet's acclaimed Mozart concerto cycle continues. The three concertos featured on this album - Nos 11-13, KV 413-415 - were composed together in 1782-83, shortly after Mozart had left Salzburg to establish himself as a freelance composer and performer in Vienna.\n\n1 MARCH 2024\n\nLa Sagrada Familia Symphony & Babel - Richard Blackford\n\nNimbus SRCD432\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\n'Bournemouth Symphony Chorus are delighted to offer congratulations to our President, Richard Blackford, on his Making Music award for Babel. Commissioned by The Camden Choir, and first performed on 20th March 2022 at Cadogan Hall, London conducted by the composer.' - Bournemouth Symphony Chorus\n\nLa Sagrada Familia Symphony No.2 study score - Richard Blackford\n\nNimbus NMP1125 (score)\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nInspired by Antoni Gaudi's temple La Sagrada Familia and more specifically its stained glass windows, pillars inspired by shapes of tree trunks, and the three great facades that surround the main access points to the basilica - nativity, passion and glory. Richard Blackford's La Sagrada Familia has three movements inspired by each of these great facades. An accompanying film of Sagrada Família has been created which can be projected behind an orchestra for synchronised performances.\n\nSongs of Nadia Anjuman - Richard Blackford\n\nElizabeth Watts, soprano\n\nNimbus NI6444\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\n'Nadia Anjuman (1980-2005) was an Afghan poet writing during a period of turmoil. In 1995, when the Taliban captured Herat, her birthplace, women's liberties were drastically reduced. A gifted student, Nadia faced a future with no hope of education. With other women she attended an underground educational circle called the Golden Needle Sewing School. Meeting under the guise of learning how to sew, the meetings were in fact discussions on literature with Herat professors. The project was dangerous: If caught, the punishment could be imprisonment, torture or hanging. Nadia was 21 when the Taliban was ousted. While earning her degree in literature she published her first book of poetry. She married into a family who believed that, since she was a woman, writing brought disgrace on their reputation. Yet she continued to write. At the age of twenty-five she was beaten to death by her husband. The five poems I chose are wide-ranging and cover extremes of emotion: from love; to delight in being a poet; to despair at her lack of freedom; and even contemplation of suicide. The opening poem Turmoil, is an astonishing volte face, starting with a song of love for the solitude and beauty of the night, then a yearning to be free of earth's constraints and to be united with God. It concludes with a passionate plea for the power of her own poetry to save her.' - Richard Blackford\n\nSongs of Nadia Anjuman - Richard Blackford\n\nNimbus NMP1173 & NMP1174 & NMP1175 (scores)\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nGeorge Lloyd The Symphonies Nos 1-6; Charade & Overture 'John Socman'\n\nBBC Philharmonic; Albany Symphony Orchestra / George Lloyd\n\nNimbus SRCD2417\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nDanza Gaya - Music for two pianos - Madeleine Dring, Dorothy Howell and Pamela Harrison\n\nSimon Callaghan, piano; Hiroaki Takenouchi, piano\n\nNimbus SRCD433\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nThis CD brings together three prolific but lesser-known British composers: Dorothy Howell (1898-1982), Pamela Harrison (1915-90), and Madeleine Dring (1923-77). Working in the same country at the same time, these composers had much in common. All studied at either the Royal Academy or Royal College of Music, and went on to have dual careers as composer-performers. They wrote tonal music in a style that would fall out of fashion in the later twentieth century, which has certainly contributed to their disappearance from concert halls, and above all, they composed with a great sense of humour. The music on this disc sparkles with wit and energy. In the mid-twentieth century the two piano combination was popular both in the concert hall and for light entertainment. It proved a perfect medium for composers who liked to bring a lightness of touch to their work, allowing them to write pieces that were fun both to play and to watch.\n\nMadeleine Dring - Four Dances for two pianos\n\nNimbus NMP1258\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nCab Calloway - The Hi-De-Ho Man\n\nNimbus RTS4414\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nBrahms & Busoni: Violin Concertos\n\nFrancesca Dego, violin; BBC Symphony Orchestra / Dalia Stasevska\n\nChandos Records CHSA 5333 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nMarking the 100th anniversary of Busoni's death, Francesca Dego is joined by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and their Principal Guest Conductor Dalia Stasevska for this recording of his violin concerto, coupled with the Brahms concerto.\n\nGlass: Cocteau Trilogy\n\nKatia Labèque, Marielle Labèque\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nKatia et Marielle Labèque, the famous pianist sister duo with a career spanning more than fifty years, release their new album dedicated to the music of Philip Glass, completing his operatic triptych composed between 1993 and 1996, based on the films by Jean Cocteau.\n\nMichael A Muller: Mirror Music\n\nDeutsche Grammophon (LP, digital)\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nBalmorhea co-founder, composer, and multi-instrumentalist Michael A. Muller has been at the forefront of contemporary music for nearly two decades. His DG solo debut opens a new chapter in his creative career. Its ten luminous tracks, crafted in collaboration with friends from around the world, embrace a multitude of sound colors and haunting melodic ideas.\n\nDussek: Complete Piano Sonatas & Sonatinas\n\nVarious artists\n\nBrilliant Classics 95503 (10 CDs)\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nJohann Ladislaus Dussek (1760-1812) was regarded by his contemporaries as one of the foremost keyboard performers and composers of his age. Over a span of three decades, Dussek completed nearly three hundred compositions, most of which involve a keyboard instrument. The sonata as a genre holds a special position in his overall oeuvre: keyboard sonatas were among his first published pieces in the early 1780s, and the sonata Op 77 in F minor was to be his last work before his death in 1812. This set is the result of an extensive recording project using the combined resources of eight excellent fortepianists to produce the first comprehensive recording of Dussek's keyboard sonatas on period instruments. Listeners are invited to take a journey through the brilliant, harmonically beautiful and expressive music of one of the most fascinating composers at the threshold of early Romanticism. While in modern times piano building has been largely standardised, eighteenth century instruments were very personal works of art, and their construction differed from town to town and from builder to builder, and even within one builder's output. The distance between cities as far apart as London and Vienna resulted in two distinct schools of piano building: the 'English' and the 'Viennese.' The formidable array of both English and Viennese fortepianos played on this recording (see info below) provides listeners with a parallel journey, alongside through Dussek's music, exploring the great tonal variety that existed amongst fortepianos in the composer's day, with each instrument's unique qualities matched to the differing characters of Dussek's works.\n\nFederico Mompou: Misteriós, Transcriptions for Guitar, vol 1\n\nMarco Ramelli, guitar\n\nBrilliant Classics 96709\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nThis album is dedicated to the compositions of Federico Mompou, a composer and pianist of profound sensitivity. He exhibited an early inclination for the piano but, inspired by a Gabriel Fauré concert, he shifted his focus to composition, making his way to Paris to further his study. Mompou's compositional approach was channelled through the piano, which he considered a fundamental tool for connecting with music's essence, so he composed primarily on and for the instrument. There are some exceptions, however: notably his guitar compositions Suite Compostelana (1962) and Cançon i Dansa No.13 (1972). In the guitar's melancholic and evocative timbre, Mompou discovered an ideal medium to express his contemplative and gentle poetic world. The guitar becomes the canvas where sound and silence intertwine, evoking emotions capable of transporting the listener to archaic places suspended in time. In 2018, Brilliant Classics released Ramelli's recording of Mompou's original guitar compositions. This new album furthers his exploration of the composer's works, taking his piano compositions and reimagining them for the guitar. The collaboration between the guitarist and James Beneteau, who presented Ramelli with these exquisite transcriptions of Mompou's pieces, has been profound. Throughout the transcription journey, Ramelli and Beneteau followed Mompou's scores as a map, transmuting each piece through the lens of contact with the geography of the guitar's unique resonance. Decisions about transcription, instrumental technique, tempo, and dynamics are all intertwined with this listening to the instrument itself. Playing Mompou's music transcribed for guitar is a journey aimed at heightened listening and sensitivity, exploring the spaces between notes through tactile contact with the instrument. This recording captures this creative process and marks the beginning of this ongoing artistic journey.\n\nPierre-Claude Foucquet: Pièces de Clavecin\n\nFernando De Luca, harpsichord\n\nBrilliant Classics 96772 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nFirst recordings of the complete surviving keyboard works by a forgotten figure of the French Baroque. Brilliant Classics has revived the names of many composers from obscure corners of history. Few of them have been as buried by the past as Pierre-Claude Foucquet, who was active in Paris in the first half of the eighteenth century. Yet anyone listening to this first complete recording of his music for harpsichord will surely wonder why. Three volumes survive: two books of Pièces de Clavecin, and a third entitled Caractères de la Paix. This was the first to be published in 1749. By then Foucquet had been organist at the magnificent Church of Saint-Eustache for some years, and he would go on to take up the post of titulaire at Notre Dame. He was following in a distinguished family line, his father and grandfather both having been organists at Saint-Eustache. Foucquet must have been a richly talented organist and improviser in the French tradition, and this latter quality is abundantly and delightfully preserved by the character pieces which make up these harpsichord suites. They belong to the same tradition as the Pièces de Clavecin of Couperin, d'Anglebert and Rameau, but they have a palette of colour and a dramatic imagination of their own. The third movement of Caractères de la Paix is titled 'Le Feu', and it fairly sets the instrument alight with pounding explosions and ribbons of flame, demanding all the resources of both an instrument and interpreter at full stretch. From 1751 and 1758 respectively, the second and third books are hardly less full of vividly pictorial representations - of chickens and champagne, of figures lamenting and working and praying in a gallery of probably real people whose names are now lost to us but whose personality lives on in the keyboard music of French composers from the time. This album of Foucquet is a notable addition to the Brilliant Classics discography of Fernando De Luca, which already includes complete surveys of other unfamiliar names from the time such as Jollage, Moyreau and most recently Pierre-Thomas Dufour.\n\nCharles & Frédéric-Nicolas Duvernoy: Clarinet Chamber Music\n\nLuigi Magistrelli, clarinet; Italian Classical Consort\n\nBrilliant Classics 96853\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nThere is scarce information available on Charles Duvernoy - not to be confused with Jean Baptiste Duvernoy (1802-1880), a French composer and pianist of the later romantic period, author of many studies and didactical works for piano. Charles was born in Montbéliard, France, and began clarinet studies in Strasbourg while playing in a military band. In 1790 he moved to Paris where he improved his playing - first as a member of the National Guard Band along with his brother, hornist Frédéric-Nicolas, and then achieving the posts of principal clarinet with the orchestra of the Monsieur Theatre and then the Feydeau Theatre of Saint- Germain, a position he held until 1824. He was also a professor at the Conservatory of Paris from 1800-02 and from 1808-16. The Quartet No 1 is an unpretentious but enjoyable composition with well-conceived themes in all three movements and strong connections to the classical Viennese period. The three Themes and Variations employ simple themes with an introduction (in a minor key for Nos 1 and 2) before developing them in five variations (Nos 1 and 2) and three variations (No 3). The two Airs varies (chosen from the 6 Airs varies) were also conceived in theme and variations form. The style is purely classical and resembles other Airs (or Sonatas) written by French composers such as Lefevre, Devienne or Buteaux. Originally written for C clarinet and bass, this recording uses a B flat clarinet and basset horn for a better timbral match. For authentic colour, the clarinet is an early, original Lefevre six-key boxwood instrument from the early nineteenth century. Frédéric-Nicolas's Trio No 1 is the work of a virtuoso hornist. In 1788 he went to Paris and joined the Orchestre de la Comédie italienne. Two years later he became hornist of the Orchestre de la Guarde National and later was a professor at the Paris Conservatory, where he served until 1815. He also played in the Orchestre de l'Opéra de Paris from 1796-1817. He left a great number of horn pieces including twelve horn concertos, trios, nocturnes, quintets, etc. The Trio recorded here features a well-developed first movement and a second movement consisting of a short theme with four carefree variations ending in a brilliant coda. The horn is substituted with the more velvety, nasal colour of the basset horn, creating a new, interesting timbral combination.\n\nClara Schumann, Rebecca Clarke: Piano Trios\n\nTrio Rigamonti\n\nBrilliant Classics 96861\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nThis pair of piano trios has become recognised in recent years as among the finest works by their composers, and they make a complementary pairing despite their contrasting idioms. This new recording also makes a fine showcase for a trio of Italian siblings who have won many prizes in chamber-music competitions and give recitals across Italy as Trio Rigamonti. Completed in 1846, the G minor Piano Trio of Clara Schumann thus postdates her early piano pieces by decades, and is accordingly a much more mature and accomplished work. She handles the piano-trio dynamic with great skill, balancing her piano part against the strings with sensitivity, and the whole piece is shot through with a pathos that bears comparison with contemporary works by both her husband and her friend Brahms. While there is no shortage of light and shade to the second theme of the first movement and the playful central Scherzo, the expressive pull of Clara Schumann's Piano Trio draws the listener towards the piano's deeply felt introduction to the slow movement, which achieves remarkable pathos within its relatively brief duration. The turbulent finale skilfully balances the scale of the first movement, and the whole piece ranks among the most satisfying of nineteenth century piano trios. Its counterpart in the early years of the twentieth century, hardly less rewarding a contribution to the piano-trio literature than contemporary works by Ravel and Rachmaninoff, is the Piano Trio composed in 1921 by Rebecca Clarke. The angst of Clara's finale is answered and intensified by a gripping confrontation at the start of Clarke's Trio, which does not so much subside as simmer throughout the first movement. The central Andante flows like a free-running brook and yet is achingly lyrical, before the Allegro vigoroso finale spins the listener through a whirling kaleidoscope of music past and future. These trios make a natural pairing in concert and on record and yet they are still too rarely heard, but Trio Rigamonti are passionate advocates.\n\nMonteverdi: Messa et Salmi\n\nLe Nuove Musiche; Krijn Koetsveld, artistic leader\n\nBrilliant Classics 96880 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nIn 1650, seven years after Claudio Monteverdi's death, the Venetian publisher Alessandro Vincenti, with the help of Francesco Cavalli, a student and successor of Monteverdi, decided to put together the compilation Messa a quattro voci et salmi. It was a unique tribute to Monteverdi. In an era when looking back was not fashionable, the preservation of written music was rare, and for the most part the names of dead musicians were quickly forgotten, Monteverdi's fame seemed to persist for a long time. In 1641 Monteverdi himself had compiled the collection Selva Morale et Spirituale. Perhaps he considered these to be the great treasures of his oeuvre. But there must have been many more. After all, music was always written for the Liturgy of the Hours (Liturgia Horarum) and for special occasions, and Monteverdi was not excepted from this practice. Cavalli and Vincenti had plenty to choose from when putting together this beautiful compilation, to which Cavalli added his own Magnificat. Alongside the Messa a quattro - church music in the old contrapuntal style - there is a lot of other beautiful music. We find the Confitebor in two different versions (Monteverdi was constantly modifying existing pieces) which gives us a nice insight into how he worked. We also know that Monteverdi looked back to the old contrapuntal techniques in his church music. The Laudate pueri, Laetatus sum, Nisi Dominus II and the Lauda Jerusalem for five voices are good examples of this. In contrast to this are the works where he looked forwards, where he translated the concertante practice into psalms such as Nisi Dominus I and the intoxicating Beatus vir. In the Laetatus sum, he lets the infinite possibilities over an infinitely repeating bass be heard. The second CD begins with a mass that was written as an opening piece for the Marian Vespers: the Messa in illo tempore. And with this, we complete the circle. In 1610 Monteverdi began a church-music career that to the end of his life was notable for the enormous variety of styles he employed. We should be grateful that Cavalli and Vincenti, perhaps driven by commercial interests, left us this extra treasure.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach, Dmitri Shostakovich: Salvation - Vocal and Instrumental Music\n\nDorothee Mields, soprano, G A P Ensemble\n\nBrilliant Classics 97280\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\n'I play Bach every day', said Shostakovich in 1950, at an event to mark the bicentenary of Bach's death. 'For us, Bach's legacy is an embodiment of flaming emotion, soulful humanity and true humanism, which stands in contrast to the dark world of raw evil and contempt for humanity.' Taking their inspiration from these words, and from the palpable influence of Bach on the solid forms and fluent counterpoint of Shostakovich's own music, this quartet of musicians presents an entirely original pairing of the two composers, in which cantata arias and a major song-cycle are linked and interspersed by instrumental interludes. The German soprano Dorothee Mields is renowned for her piercing musicianship and luminous tone in the music of Bach, working with such illustrious conductors as Rene Jacobs and Philippe Herreweghe. Here she sings recitatives and arias from seven cantatas, including the meditative opening movement of 'Ich bin in mir vergnügt' BWV 204. The trio-sonata accompaniment brings her expressive handling of the text to the fore, and prefaces the arias with the G major Sonata BWV 1021 for violin and continuo, while Luca Quintavalle contributes the sixth Prelude and Fugue from Book 2 of 'The Well-Tempered Clavier'. Switching to piano for Shostakovich, Quintavalle plays the D major Prelude and Fugue from the Russian composer's counterpart to the WTC. The early Piano Trio No.1 makes a Romantically yearning preface to the late settings of Alexander Blok which Shostakovich composed alongside the song-cycle Fourteenth Symphony. These songs find the composer at his most introspective, unsparing and yet rewarding of the subtlety which Mields brings to them. The idioms of Bach and Shostakovich complement as much as they contrast, and they are drawn together here by performances of powerful eloquence.\n\nHeinrich Baermann: Clarinet Quintets\n\nHenk de Graaf, clarinet; Schubert Consort Netherlands\n\nBrilliant Classics 97062\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nNew recordings of early-Romantic quintets by the supreme clarinet virtuoso of his day, an inspiration to Weber and Mendelssohn but also an accomplished composer in his own right. Heinrich Baermann followed in his father's footsteps as a military musician in Prussian Germany, but his career took off once he met Carl Maria von Weber in 1811. Weber was immediately taken with the French-accented brilliance and German richness of tone which Baermann drew from his instrument, and began to write a series of works - including two concertos and a concertino - which still rank among his most inspired instrumental pieces, as well as defining a new sound and reach for the clarinet as a solo instrument Mozart had made a poet out of the clarinet, with his pieces for Anton Stadler; now thanks to Baermann, it could take on multiple roles, as leader, jester, and magus-like figure to complement the likes of Paganini on the violin and Giuliani on the guitar. Weber pushed Baermann's technique to new heights of facility and eloquence, which in return inflected Baermann's own works for his instrument with comparable ambition. He wrote three quintets for clarinet and string ensemble, the first of them more concerto-like in character, the latter two full-scale chamber works. They have been recorded complete only once before, making this new album from a fine team of Dutch musicians all the more welcome. Especially impressive are the slow movements of the quintets, cast as arias without words in order to capitalise on the fluid legato of Baermann's playing, but formed with an economy of means which leaves their themes lingering in the mind's ear. The Adagio of the Op 23 Quintet was misattributed to Richard Wagner for many years, which speaks for Baermann's craftsmanship, even if its harmonic language evidently belongs to a generation or two after Mozart. Now restored to its rightful place, the Adagio is the crown jewel, but there are treasures in store throughout Baermann's clarinet quintets.\n\nSummer Dreams American Piano Duets - Edward MacDowell, Amy Beach, Samuel Barber\n\nEmma Abbate & Julian Perkins, piano\n\nBrilliant Classics 97118\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nBoth Beach and MacDowell were formidably accomplished pianists who wrote concertos in barnstorming virtuoso style, for themselves and their contemporaries to play, but they could also turn their hand to the lucrative domestic market for piano-duet music. In doing so they also tapped into the nineteenth century, Romantic preoccupation with childhood which Schumann had encapsulated in his Kinderszenen of 1838. MacDowell wrote his Moon-Pictures Op 21 in the winter of 1884-5 and subtitled them 'after H C Andersen's Picture-Book without Pictures', referring to an 1848 collection of short bedtime stories. Published in 1901 and dedicated to the composer's niece, the six duets of the album's title collection, Summer Dreams by Beach, are shorter and technically simpler than the Moon-Pictures, but they are prefaced by literary quotations which once more indicate that this is not music for children so much as music for adults to play to children, and for adults to play at being children. In any case, simpler means and fewer notes need hardly imply naivety of expression, and Beach's self-taught technique was too rigorous to allow anything less than the most deftly fashioned work to escape her desk. Composed in 1883, Beach's brief 3 Movements for piano duet are the work of a prodigiously talented teenager who knows her early-Romantic piano literature - including Kinderszenen - inside out, but who also understands at this stage how to emulate rather than merely copy her models. In the following year of 1884, the twenty-three-year-old MacDowell wrote his Three Poems Op 20. Strictly speaking, Hamlet and Ophelia is the outlier in this collection, since MacDowell composed it in 1894 as a tone-poem for orchestra in the Lisztian manner, and then made this two-piano transcription rather than leaving the work to the kind of professional arranger habitually commissioned by publishers for such work. Nevertheless, he took the kind of care over it that Brahms did in arranging his symphonies, and the piano-duet version retains the brooding tension of the opening and effectively transfers the violinistic surges of Hamlet's main section to the keyboard. The album's final collection takes a chronological leap forward to 1952, but its nostalgia-drenched mood belongs to an intermediate age. 'One might imagine a divertissement in a setting of the Palm Court at the Plaza Hotel', Barber explained in a letter to his publisher, 'the year about 1914, epoch of the first tangos. Souvenirs - remembered with affection, not in irony or with tongue in cheek, but in amused tenderness.' Barber, it should be noted, would have been four years old at the time, and so these are 'souvenirs' in the manner of sepia-tinted postcards.\n\nHandel: Oboe Concertos\n\nAndrius Puskunigis, oboe, oboe d'amore; Klaipėda Chamber Orchestra; Vincent Bernhardt, harpsichord, conductor\n\nBrilliant Classics 90014 (1 LP)\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nAn audiophile LP transfer for a superbly engineered modern recording of Handel's oboe concertos. The Latvian oboist Andrius Puskunigis has built a catalogue of critically acclaimed albums on Brilliant Classics. From 2020, this album of oboe concertos by Handel includes a number of first recordings and reconstructions. There is ample justification for such imaginative licence, given that Handel himself remarked that the oboe was his favourite instrument, and given the freedom with which he adapted and transcribed his own music as the occasion demanded. Thus, alongside the canonic three oboe concertos, Puskingis presents two more, one for the oboe and the other for the oboe d'amore, transcribed from arias originally written for castrato roles in his operas. A C major Concerto thus includes the famous aria 'Lascia ch'io pianga' from Rinaldo, while the expressive heart of the D major concerto for oboe d'amore features 'Ombra mai fu' from Serse. A similarly inventive approach has been taken to ornamentation and decoration, inserting liberal opportunities for Andrius Puskunigis to display his virtuosity with cadenza passages. Accompanied by the neatly contoured modern-instrument Klaipėda Chamber Orchestra, and recorded in the acoustically optimal modern concert hall of Klaipėda, the album has a focused resonance which makes it highly suitable for this transfer to 180gm vinyl.\n\nD'Indy: Piano Sonata; Albéric Magnard: Promenades\n\nSofia Andreoli, piano\n\nPiano Classics PCL10255\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nVincent d'Indy is remembered less for his own music than his conservative control and influence over French musical life in the last decades of the nineteenth century. Yet this massive Piano Sonata, published in 1907, demands the technique of a virtuoso performer, and rewards close attention no less than better-known examples such as the no less ambitious works from the same time by Dukas and Lekeu (both of them also available on Piano Classics). The first movement unfolds as a huge and chromatic set of theme and variations, in which d'Indy's avowed Wagnerism continually blurs tonal boundaries and erupts into distant keys. Even larger - almost twenty minutes in length - is the finale, which seems to pick up where the eventful narrative of the first movement left off, presenting a theme which, if not modernist in its development, embraces distant realms with hardly less enthusiasm than the contemporary music of Scriabin. It is left to the central Scherzo to afford some brief and light relief, but even here the angular features of the outer movements recur. Any seeker of piano rarities and enthusiast for the likes of Alkan and Medtner will want to make the acquaintance of D'Indy's Piano Sonata, especially in a performance as accomplished as this recording by the young Italian pianist Sofia Andreoli. Her pairing for D'Indy's Sonata is hardly less original: the set of Promenades composed by Albéric Magnard in 1893. Magnard was twenty-eight at the time, yet this suite of tone-pictures is hardly 'youthful' in tone. Rather, it too belongs to the heady world of French Wagnerism, exploratory and reflective in tone even as its composer wanders the streets of Paris, past the Bois de Boulogne, the Eglise Saint-Germain and the Trianon, before finding its destination in the forest of Rambouillet on the southern edge of the city. There, glinting half-lights and arboreal silence take the listener back to a space of tranquillity, inviting discovery by any adventurous explorer of the late-Romantic piano.\n\nSweelinck: Keyboard Works\n\nAndrea Vivanet, piano\n\nPiano Classics PCL10280\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nA young Italian virtuoso breathes new life into the ornate fantasies of a Dutch Baroque master. Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck (1562-1621) enjoyed a great reputation in his time that spread throughout northern Europe and Scandinavia. He attracted pupils from afar, Heinrich Scheidemann, Jacob Praetorius and Samuel Scheidt being the most famous. Sweelinck's influence can, therefore, be said to have reached Buxtehude and Bach through his teaching and compositions: He was not only the founder of the true fugue but a splendid player and teacher whose profound influence on northern European keyboard music particularly lasted long after his death. Sweelinck's extant keyboard output comprises some seventy pieces, of which fourteen are represented here in an original sequence of alternating toccatas, fantasias and variation sets. The precise instrument for which each of the pieces was written cannot always be determined with certainty. While the song variations suit either harpsichord or virginal, the fantasias and toccatas may well have been played on whatever keyboard instrument was to hand, including the organ. Especially in his Variation pieces on popular songs such as 'More Palatino' and 'Onder een linde groen'. Sweelinck shows himself as one of the supreme masters of the form. He retains the structure of his themes throughout each set, but his mastery and inventiveness is shown in the shaping of the inner structures of each variation. The complexity of polyphony can change over the course of one single variation, and the sets as a whole make use of the whole spectrum of compositional structures, from the most plain to the most elaborate. The Italian pianist Andrea Vivanet takes a historically informed approach to Sweelinck's music on the piano. He incorporates graceful ornamentation, and stylistic features necessitated by the limits of early keyboards, but he also takes full advantage of the expressive and coloristic capabilities of the modern instrument. His previous recordings have displayed a refined and imaginative approach to twentieth century composers such as Ravel and Shostakovich, but Vivanet brings a welcome precision of touch to Sweelinck that makes him sound at home on the piano.\n\nMetamorphosis\n\n12 Ensemble\n\nPlatoon\n\nRelease: 1 March 2024\n\nFrom the divine nature of transformation to alien visions of new worlds and rebirth, the conductor-less 12 Ensemble's debut album on Platoon explores Renaissance hymn reborn as futuristic prayer, ancient Japanese ritual, otherworldly operatic arias and a monumental elegy to lost beauty. Harnessing the transformative sound and arresting commitment of this trail-blazing string collective, Strauss' iconic Metamorphosen for twenty-three solo strings is at the heart of a powerful programme which includes Claude Vivier's cult-classic Zipangu. The album also contains new music from two of today's leading composers: a new adaptation of the aria from Oliver Leith's critically-acclaimed Royal Opera House opera Last Days and a fresh look at an ancient hymn reborn by Edmund Finnis.\n\n23 FEBRUARY 2024\n\nHandel: Complete Violin Sonatas\n\nBojan Čičić, baroque violin; Steven Devine, 1756 Kirkman harpsichord\n\nDelphian Records DCD34304\n\nRelease: 23 February 2024\n\nThough better known as a virtuoso keyboard player, as a young man Handel also trained as a violinist. His works for violin and harpsichord, says essayist Donald Burrows, 'do not attract attention by flashy virtuosity: rather, they are flowing and agreeable chamber music, in which the violinist is in musical conversation with the keyboard player'. Who better to guide us in this conversation than two early music stars - Bojan Čičić, fresh from acclaimed solo recordings of Bach and Johann Jakob Walther; and Steven Devine, who has known the magnificent 1756 Kirckman harpsichord since boyhood and for whom, he says, it is a privilege and delight to record these Handel Sonatas on it.\n\nA Year at Newcastle\n\nThe Choir of Newcastle Cathedral; Kris Thomsett, organ / Ian Roberts\n\nRegent Records REGCD582\n\nRelease: 23 February 2024\n\nThe latest addition to our 'A Year at ...' series comes from Newcastle - England's most northerly cathedral. This is the first recording of the re-vitalised Newcastle Cathedral Choir under their Director of Music, Ian Roberts, who was appointed in 2016, and has taken the choir to new heights. Music is central to Newcastle Cathedral's daily life of prayer, worship and witness, marking the church year and illuminating the Christian Story. This recording presents a flavour of the annual liturgical journey at Newcastle Cathedral, with music chosen to reflect the seasons of Advent, Christmas and Candlemas, and the observance of Lent, including the Feast of The Annunciation. We journey through Holy Week, the joy of Easter, and celebration of Pentecost; we mark Trinity Sunday, the Feast of Corpus Christi, the commemoration of All Souls, and conclude with the final Sunday of the year - the Feast of Christ the King. The repertoire for this recording is predominantly centred on the rich treasury of twentieth century British music, along with some more recent compositions. Receiving its first recorded performance are the 'Three Grace Anthems' by Alan Gray (1885-1935), written during his time as Organist of Trinity College, Cambridge. Recently rediscovered and newly-edited by a member of Newcastle Cathedral Choir, Matthew McCullough, each of the three pieces is an absolute gem of a capella choral writing. 'Ubi caritas' by the Cathedral's Assistant Director of Music and organist for this recording, Kris Thomsett, is a radiant, multi-part setting, influenced by the contemporary 'Ecstatic Style' of Morten Lauridsen or Eric Whitacre, that is destined to enter the standard cathedral repertoire for Maundy Thursday. William Drakett's Evening Canticles from 'The Wells Service' were written for Matthew Owens and the Lay Clerks and Choral Scholars of Wells Cathedral Choir. Taking plainsong tones as a starting point, Drakett writes masterfully and sympathetically, exploiting the luminous and resonant qualities of the choir's lower voices.\n\nAntología 1: Obras para la Orquesta Experimental de Instrumentos Nativos\n\nCergio Prudencio\n\nBuh Records BR181\n\nRelease: 23 February 2024\n\nThe work of Bolivian composer Cergio Prudencio (La Paz, 1955) is indissolubly linked to the project of the Orquesta Experimental de Instrumentos Nativos [Experimental Orchestra of Native Instruments] (OEIN), which he co-founded in 1980 and of which he is the emeritus director. It constitutes one of the most challenging adventures in the music that has emerged in Bolivia and Latin America. The OEIN is the result of the incorporation of Aymara musical traditions into the realm of contemporary music to produce a new sonic world. In the composer's words, it is about '... finding in the indigenous conception of music, elements of change and transformation, to establish a historical continuity'. This incorporation is not only based on using native instruments but also involves integrating their socio-historical context and philosophies from the Andean indigenous world.\n\nUkrainian Masters - Viktor Kosenko, Myroslav Skoryk, Sergei Bortkiewicz Violin Sonatas\n\nSolomiya Ivakhiv, Steven Beck\n\nNaxos 8579146\n\nRelease: 23 February 2024\n\nThe expressive vitality in this collection of violin sonatas transcends the cultural upheavals from which these three Ukrainian composers emerged. Bortkiewicz's Violin Sonata in G minor is among the most impressive of his relatively few chamber works, finding his musical language at its most vivid and directly communicative. Kosenko's Violin Sonata in A minor is notable for the satisfying balance of its two subtly differentiated movements. Skoryk's Second Violin Sonata is a stylistically diverse chamber work, with pointed allusions to Beethoven, Prokofiev and Gershwin during its compact and always eventiul course.\n\nAntoine Bohrer, Max Bohrer: Grand symphonie militaire; Violin Concerto; Cello Concerto\n\nFriedemann Eichhorn, violin; Alexander Hülshoff, cello; Jena Philharmonic Orchestra / Nicolás Pasquet\n\nNaxos 8574048\n\nRelease: 23 February 2024\n\nThe Bohrer family produced a succession of distinguished musicians of whom the brothers Antoine, a violinist who studied with Rodolphe Kreutzer in Paris, and cellist Max were the most eminent. Their string quartet promoted Beethoven's works and was much admired by Berlioz, who praised Antoine. They co-composed several works including the imposing Grande symphonie militaire included here, boldly virtuosic and laced with memorable themes. Antoine Borer's Violin Concerto in E minor shares elements familiar from Paganini and is enhanced by Antoine's sense of lyricism. Max's Cello Concerto No 1, though economically scored, shows how quickly the cello had progressed as a solo instrument in the early nineteenth century.\n\nBartók: Piano Sonata, Op 19; Bartók/Reschofsky: Zongoraiskola ('Piano Method')\n\nGoran Filipec, piano\n\nNaxos 8574420\n\nRelease: 23 February 2024\n\nTwo important works dominate volume nine of this series. The first is Bartók's substantial and ambitious late-Romantic Piano Sonata, Op 19, a very early work, composed when he was around 17 before his studies in Budapest. It was long considered lost and is heard in Goran Filipec's performing edition, prepared from the manuscript. Zongoraiskola or Piano Method' was devised in collaboration with composer, pianist and teacher Sándor Reschofsky who contributed the exercises. Bartók's 48 original pieces are perfectly formed and charmingly refined, allowing him an opportunity to explore his ideas of piano pedagogy.\n\nBrahms: Complete Songs 5 - Opp 70, 71, 95, 97 and 107; Fünf Ophelia-Lieder, WoO 22\n\nAlina Wunderlin, soprano; Kieran Carrel, tenor; Ulrich Eisenlohr, piano\n\nNaxos 8574490\n\nRelease: 23 February 2024\n\nIn grouping his Lieder into sets with opus numbers, Brahms was concerned with thematic unity and poetic contrasts. The theme of Op 71 is love, whether ardent, ironic or courtly, and contains one of his best-loved songs, Minnelied. In Op 70 the connections are more subtle: past, present and future create the thematic framework. The serenity of Op 95 is heightened through the use of Serbian folk songs, and for the Op 107 set Brahms once again illuminates love in all its intensity and humour.\n\nLuxembourg Contemporary Music, Vol 3 - Dartevelle, Grethen, Hammes, Kontz, Waltzing\n\nErnie Hammes, David Ascani, Boris Schmidt, Pierre-Alain Goualch, Niels Engel, Solistes Européens, Luxembourg / Christoph König\n\nNaxos 8579138\n\nRelease: 23 February 2024\n\nAs both previous volumes in this series have shown, Luxembourg has a wealth of composers writing vibrant new orchestral scores. Featured on this third volume, Luc Grethen's Upswing is a crescendo of energy, while Ernie Hammes' Concertino No 1 fuses jazz modes with classical patterns, and his West End Avenue evokes the atmosphere of an afternoon in New York. Catherine Kontz explores feminist ideas in The Waves, while Gast Waltzing allows his music to 'speak for itself'.\n\nEduard Strauss I: A Centenary Celebration 3\n\nCzech Chamber Philharmonic Orchestra Pardubice / Marek Stilec\n\nMarco Polo 8225382\n\nRelease: 23 February 2024\n\nThough he is much less well remembered than his more famous brothers, Johann II and Josef, Eduard Strauss (1835-1916) was the master of the quick polka and the galop with a succession of distinctive and beguiling melodies and a genius for orchestration. This latest release continues the rediscovery of his music with a succession of pieces, all of which are receiving their first commercial recordings. His music was performed at some of Vienna's most glittering balls and carnival festivities with Eduard offering such à la mode pieces as the Electric Lights waltz and the ingenious equine polka, Leaps of Pegasus.\n\nDvořák: Cello Concerto in B minor; Silent Woods; Rondo; Romance; Mazurek\n\nZara Nelsova, Ruggiero Ricci, St Louis Symphony Orchestra / Walter Susskind\n\nVox Classics VOX-NX-3034CD\n\nRelease: 23 February 2024\n\nAntonín Dvořák's Cello Concerto is considered the finest of his concertos, and arguably the greatest of all such works for the cello, with its majestic character, imposing themes and moods of intense drama and warm lyricism. The nostalgic Silent Woods and the sprightly, eloquent Rondo in G minor both predate the concerto, while the songful Romance in F minor contrasts with the virtuoso brilliance of the Mazurek in E minor. Conducted by Walter Susskind and performed by soloists who were legends in their lifetime - violinist Ruggiero Ricci and cellist Zara Nelsova - these recordings are acclaimed classics. The Elite Recordings for VOX by legendary producers Marc Aubort and Joanna Nickrenz are considered by audiophiles to be amongst the finest sounding examples of orchestral recordings.\n\nDvořák: Violin Concerto; Piano Concerto\n\nRuggiero Ricci, Rudolf Firkušný, St Louis Symphony Orchestra / Walter Susskind\n\nVox Classics VOX-NX-3035CD\n\nRelease: 23 February 2024\n\nThe great nineteenth-century violinist Joseph Joachim provides a connection between Dvořák's Violin Concerto and that by his friend Brahms, having given invaluable advice to both composers regarding the works. Dvořák's Czech spirit is given extra weight through Brahms' influence, with Classical stature meeting eloquent Slavonic vitality to create a splendid masterpiece, performed here by Ruggiero Ricci in this acclaimed recording. The Piano Concerto is characteristic of the younger Dvořák. It was long championed by soloist Rudolf Firkušný, whose reputation for placing cultured musicianship before extrovert virtuosity suited the work perfectly. This classic VOX recording remains one of the finest versions of the Piano Concerto available, played by the work's greatest advocate. The Elite Recordings for VOX by legendary producers Marc Aubort and Joanna Nickrenz are considered by audiophiles to be amongst the finest sounding examples of orchestral recordings.\n\n20 FEBRUARY 2024\n\nThe Sounds of Chow Gar\n\nShugorei; Black Square String Quartet\n\n4000 Records\n\nRelease: 20 February 2024\n\nA studio-recorded soundtrack to the one-time performance The Sounds of Chow Gar, a cinematic classical crossover live music experience featuring Kung fu practitioners performing Chow Gar forms set to meticulously timed live music. This soundtrack album delivers the five main forms that are portrayed in the filmed portion of the show. These are cinematic, percussively heavy and epic pieces performed by Meanjin/Brisbane duo Shugorei, alongside the Black Square String Quartet. For fans of: Björk, Nico Muhly, Ólafur Arnalds, Tan Dun, Geinoh Yamashirogumi and Hans Zimmer.\n\n16 FEBRUARY 2024\n\nLes choses de la vie - Cinema II\n\nRenaud Capuçon, violin; Les Siécles / Duncan Ward\n\nErato\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nThe follow-up to Cinema (2018), violinist Renaud Capuçon presents another sublime selection of music written by French film composers or for iconic French films, including excerpts from Le Dernier Métro (Georges Delerue), Lawrence of Arabia (Maurice Jarre), The Shape of Water (Alexandre Desplat), Les Choses de la Vie (Philippe Sarde) and more. Performed with Les Siécles, the album features new arrangements by Cyrille Lehn.\n\nJohannes Bernardus van Bree: String Quartets Nos 1 & 2\n\nUtrecht String Quartet\n\nMDG MDG60323022\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nDutch early Romantic composer Johannes Bernardus van Bree's elegant melodies and carefully dosed counterpoint technique give his string quartets a simple yet charming originality. In the words of a contemporary, his works are characterised 'by simplicity and naturalness ... by polish, clarity and freshness, a certain popularity, without triviality'. Van Bree was a self-taught violin virtuoso who founded one of the first professional string quartets in the Netherlands. His compositions were probably all premiered by the 'Amsterdam Quartet Society'. Their surviving concert programmes show a great interest in contemporary repertoire with works by Onslow, Mendelssohn and Spohr, which must have influenced van Bree's own works. He founded Amsterdam's first professional orchestra at the 'Felix Meritis' (a forerunner to the Concertgebouw) and conducted the Dutch premieres of Berlioz' Symphonie fantastique and Wagner's Faust Overture. Even the Toonkunstkoor Amsterdam, which still exists today, can be traced back to van Bree. His importance for Amsterdam's musical life in the first half of the nineteenth century cannot be overstated. Although highly esteemed during his lifetime, van Bree's compositions quickly fell into oblivion. He left behind four string quartets, of which the last one is yet to be published. The Utrecht String Quartet are always on the lookout for hidden treasures. This recording is a first step towards van Bree's long overdue rediscovery.\n\nBeethoven: Piano Sonatas Op 101 & 106\n\nJin Ju, piano\n\nMDG MDG94723066\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nBeethoven's enigmatic 'Hammerklavier Sonata' Op 106, unprecedented for its time, made such uncompromisingly high demands of the performer that decades would pass before anyone took on the challenge. The immensely difficult, pioneering work of symphonic dimensions is a rewarding task for award-winning virtuoso Jin Ju. Her phenomenal talent turns Beethoven's complex web of motifs into pure musical expression, touching the emotions as deeply as it challenges the intellect. Composed a couple of years after the death of Beethoven's brother, the powerful slow movement of opus 106 is bursting with intensity, in which the pain of his loss and the despair of his now almost complete deafness can be felt. The final fugue with its penetrating trills of brute force brings the listener back down to earth with a jolt, pointing to these 'distressing circumstances'. The much more concise, although by no means less demanding, Sonata Op 101 demonstrates Beethoven's intellectual freedom, particularly in its harmonic structure, which goes far beyond the convention of the time. Internationally celebrated by audiences and critics alike for her warm sensibility of singing lines, astonishing clarity in narrative subtleties as well as her technical perfection, Jin Ju is a rising star of the piano music world. Jin Ju achieves the feat of freeing herself from the difficulties of these sonatas, bringing forth even seemingly incidental touches with finely differentiated tonal nuances. The subtleties of Jin Ju's piano playing on the strikingly powerful sound of the legendary 'Manfred Burki' Steinway from 1901 provide immensely pleasurable listening. Expertly produced in highresolution sound with optional three- dimensional playback, the listener is completely immersed in the natural acoustics of the concert hall, which allows the multi-faceted depths of Beethoven's music to unfold anew.\n\nGentleman for a Day\n\nBarbara Heindlmeier, recorder; Ensemble La Ninfea\n\nPerfect Noise PN2401\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nBarbara Heindlmeier and La Ninfea spend a day as a gentleman in baroque London. 'Gentleman for a Day' is la Ninfea's second production with Perfect Noise, this time with founding member and renowned recorder player Barbara Heindlmeier as the soloist, also known for her excitingly innovative concepts. When thinking of a true London gentleman, the first thing that comes to mind are top hats and courteous behaviour, elegance and elevated status. Recorder, too? But of course! Well, the fine gentleman didn't (yet) have a top hat around 1700, but of course it was excellent manners to have a recorder in your pocket for you to, for example, serenade the lady you adored at any given moment - a welcome occasion for Barbara Heindlmeier and her colleagues to be 'Gentleman for a Day'. Everything is included: from getting up in the morning to going for a walk, visiting the royal court and going to the opera, to the obligatory five o'clock tea and preparing for the said serenade. An exciting and busy day plotted out with music by composers such as G F Handel, H Purcell, M Locke and J Playford. The Bremen baroque ensemble La Ninfea stands for the highest artistic standards. They have since made a name for themselves with creative, cross- genre concert formats. This baroque ensemble with a varying line-up is completely dedicated to the art of baroque ornamenation and improvisation. Their own contributions such as the divisions on 'Strawberries and Cream' or 'John come kiss me now' underline the richness of colour, emotional density and fast-moving contrasts so inherent to this repertoire.\n\nOgura Plays Ogura\n\nMiharu Ogura, piano\n\nThanasis Productions CDTHA30\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nFollowing her critically acclaimed Stockhausen-album (Thanatosis 2023), Japanese piano wizard Miharu Ogura now displays her incredible skills not only at the piano but also as a composer - Five complex new works are presented here, performed by Ogura with her usual delicacy, preciseness, and soulfulness. In the international press, Ogura's remarkable and prize-awarded playing have drawn comparisons to David Tudor and Aloys Kontarsky, and this new set of original, staggering pieces will attract contemporary classical audiences worldwide. The album was recorded on a Fazioli 212 Grand Piano, at Studio Epidemin in Gothenburg, Sweden. It's published digitally and on a limited CD edition coming in a digi-sleeve and including a booklet with lucid and insightful liner notes by fellow pianist Jonas Olsson, who has also performed several of Ogura's works.\n\nAnton Bruckner: Symphony No 8\n\nYomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra / Stanislaw Skrowaczewski\n\nMDG MDG65023072\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nTo mark the 100th birthday of legendary conductor Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, MDG has released a live recording of Bruckner's 8th Symphony with the Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra in cooperation with Denon, in Bruckner's bicentenary year. With a career spanning eight decades, the ninety-three-year-old conductor moulds Bruckner's last completed symphony into a moving legacy: the crowning achievement a life's work. Born in Lviv, Poland (now part of Ukraine) in 1923, Skrowaczewski began violin and piano lessons at the age of four, and he composed his first symphony by age eight. At 11, he made his debut as a pianist and at 13 conducted and was soloist in Beethoven's 3rd Piano Concerto. This career ended when, in a WWII air raid, he suffered two broken hands and was left with nerve damage. He then turned to composing and conducting. Bruckner's music had transfixed him since he was a boy. Anton Bruckner did not have it easy as a composer. Appointed late in life and plagued by constant self- doubt, he often reworked his compositions several times. Neither was he initially well-received by the public: the premiere of his 7th symphony turned into a veritable scandal after the audience left the hall in droves. However, his 8th was a triumphant success: the audience applauded enthusiastically after every movement and the composer was praised as 'a giant', 'a poet' 'a great genius' by the likes of Hugo Wolf, Hans Richter and Johannes Brahms. In the restrained, introspective coda of the first movement, the music softly fades away, in keeping with the opening of the work. Bruckner described it as a 'Totenuhr' (death knell): 'It's as if you are lying on your death-bed and there is a clock hanging on the wall opposite and inexorably ticking away the seconds while your life slowly ebbs away: tick, tock, tick, tock ...' Bruckner passed away before he could complete his 9th Symphony, making the 8th, the longest symphony he had ever written, his magnum opus.\n\nStuart James: Alluvial Gold\n\nLouise Devenish, percussion\n\nHuddersfield Contemporary Records HCR32\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nAlluvial Gold is a bold new ecologically inspired composition for percussion and electronics developed by percussionist Louise Devenish (Speak Percussion) and composer Stuart James (Decibel New Music), in collaboration with visual artist Erin Coates, that seeks to expose listeners to the world that lies below the surface of our river systems. Alluvial Gold is shaped by the intersection of multiple narratives embodied by and inflicted upon the Derbarl Yerrigan (Swan River), Western Australia and similar systems across southern Australia. In drawing upon the physical structures and historical experiences of these river systems, the impact of industrialisation following European colonisation, and the audible by-products of its living ecology, Alluvial Gold slowly unravels to reveal itself over nine interconnected movements across eleven tracks. In each movement, different combinations of sculptural percussion-modelled on dolphin bones, native oyster shells and estuarine ecology-are brought together with vibraphone and percussion. Live electronic processing and recordings of the riverbed and water's surface - from air bubbles, shell rustles, crustacean movements, shifting algae, moss and plants - are fluidly and subtly integrated with Devenish's live performance, creating a striking sonic tapestry in constant ebb and flow, a mysterious world of floating sounds that spin off from one another, offering an immersive sonic image.\n\nGeorg Friedrich Handel: Neun deutsche Arien\n\nDaniel Saether, Ensemble C4\n\nLAWO LWC1269\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nEnsemble C4 is a Norwegian baroque ensemble working primarily in Norway. With its association with several freelance musicians, the ensemble remains flexible in both its musical expression and size. Since 2015, it has presented several new concert programmes per year and has consequently built up a large repertoire of music taken from the period from approximately 1575 till 1800. With extensive concert experience and great synergy, the ensemble has developed a playful and virtuosic style that thrills audiences and has received critical acclaim. Neun deutsche Arien is the ensemble's first CD release. Countertenor Daniel Saether studied at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire and the Royal Academy in Den Haag. He has performed as a countertenor in Norway and abroad since 2011 with a wide- ranging repertoire from early music to contemporary. From 2018-2020 he was awarded the Norwegian government grant Statens Arbeidsstipend to work with contemporary music for countertenor on baroque instruments and document this in concerts and recordings. In the summer of 2023, Daniel featured as Cesarin the Trygve Broske's contemporary opera Kommandantenheld at the Oscarsborg open air Opera. Saether is a founding member of Ensemble Freithoffand Christian IV Consort(now known as Ensemble C4), both of which perform chamber music in Norway with a focus on Re-naissance and Baroque music. In 2020, Saether released the album Unexpected Songs (LWC1204) for which he was nominated as Singer of the Year at the German Opus Klassik awards in 2021. His second solo album in 2022 Vintersong (LWC1236) achieved nominations in four categories.\n\nScenes of Horror: Baroque Arias from the Shadows\n\nLaila Salome Fischer, Il Giratempo, Max Volbers\n\nPerfect Noise PN2306\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nThis is Laila Salome Fischer's debut album recorded in the splendid acoustics of the Johann Sebastian Bach Saal in Koethen. Baroque opera librettists seem to have found an impish satisfaction in thoroughly putting the heroes of their stories through the wringer before they meet their more or less glorious end or, with a bit of luck, live to celebrate the opera's happy ending. The creativity with which they maneuver their own characters into horrifying scenarios knows no bounds. Popular subjects include fighting terrible monsters, marching into seemingly hopeless battles, various forms of murder, intricate entanglements that can only lead to disaster, lifelong imprisonment, the occasional suicide... and, of course, the full Baroque- opera bounty of creative death sentences. Our poor heroes and heroines are alternately thrown to the lions (eg Salustia), burnt at the stake (eg Croesus), set adrift in the middle of the Mediterranean on a boat with no sails (eg Poppea), beheaded (eg Tito Manlio) and so on ... These scenes of horror are not only thrilling and sundry from a literary standpoint - their musical compositions are equally so. Fear and trembling are never, but never presented in a single, monotonous tone color! Our characters often go through an emotional rollercoaster: from deepest despair to sorrow and anger, from flight to fight, from love and longing to sheer insanity. Truly, a painters box full of affects, inviting composers to go wild with musical expression. 'Scenes of Horror' is a baroque cabinet of grotesqueries featuring music by Georg Friedrich Handel, Attilio Ariosti, Antonio Vivaldi and Carl Heinrich Graun. As you may imagine, the Baroque librettists were not the only ones who derived sadistic pleasure from seeing their characters suffer. We also found a devilish delight in sending Laila Salome Fischer through this program's series of nightmares.\n\nNikola Medtner: The Last Three Piano Sonatas\n\nBenjamin Bertin, piano\n\nATMA Classique ACD22894\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nOf the fourteen piano sonatas composed by the Russian composer Nikolai Medtner (1880-1951), Canadian pianist Benjamin Bertin has selected the last three sonatas for his ATMA Classique debut album. These sonatas represent a contrasting and fascinating portrait of the mature composer at the peak of his powers. In terms of ingenuity of form, diversity of mood and character, and overall mastery of craft, these final works are akin to those of Beethoven, who inspired Medtner throughout his life. Benjamin Bertin's playing has been awarded a number of prizes and scholarships throughout his career, including the Bourse de fin d'etudes doctorales (Universite de Montreal), the Marek Jablonsky Piano Endowment (Banff Center), as well as full fellowships from Art of the Piano Festival (Cincinnati Conservatory) and Orford Musique Artist Residencies (Quebec). A committed chamber musician and duo partner, Bertin has collaborated with members of the Boston Symphony, l'Orchestre symphonique de Montreal, Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, and Bang on a Can All-Stars in projects reaching across five centuries ranging from Reich to Monteverdi. As a member of Les Solistes de l'Orchestre 21, he performed the Canadian premiere of Pierre Boulez' Sur Incises in Montreal in 2021. After studies at Brandon University and Bowling Green State University, Benjamin received an Artist Diploma from Columbus State University where he studied with Alexander Kobrin. He completed a Doctorat en interpretation at the Universite de Montreal under the mentorship of Paul Stewart, serving as his studio assistant. Summer music festival appearances include Art of the Piano (OH), Washington International Piano Festival, Clear Lake Chamber Festival (MB), Adamant Piano Masterclasses (VT), Gijon International Piano Festival (Spain), Academie de l'Ete musical de Barachois (NB), and Porto PianoFest (Portugal).\n\nBravura\n\nLouis-Philippe Bergeron, natural horn; Meagan Milatz, piano\n\nATMA Classique ACD22864\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nNatural horn player Louis-Pierre Bergeron and pianist Meagan Milatz look to Beethoven as the point of departure for their new album, Bravura. The composer's Sonata Op 17, a masterpiece, is the first true sonata for horn and piano in the history of music. More than forty years separate the five works on this album ranging from the classical period with Righini and Sussmayer, to Beethoven's successors Krufft and Potter, whose music demonstrates the evolution of the Romantic style. Since October 2017, Louis-Pierre Bergeron is the proud 4th horn of the National Arts Centre Orchestra. Previously, he was third horn with Orchestre symphonique de Montreal, second horn with Orchestre Metropolitain, and solo horn with Orchestre symphonique de Trois-Rivieres. He still collaborates frequently with Les Violons du Roy. Bergeron studied with John Zirbel at McGill University and at the Aspen Music Festival and School, and natural horn with Teunis van der Zwart at the Amsterdam Conservatory. An avid champion of the natural horn, he has performed and recorded with prestigious early music ensembles, notably the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra, Tafelmusik, and Europa Galante. Bergeron gives educational concerts with his woodwind quintet Ayorama, and for seniors in longterm care with Moon Palace, a duo with his partner, NACO cellist Julia MacLaine. Chosen as one of CBC's '30 hot Canadian classical musicians under 30', Meagan Milatz has appeared as a soloist alongside orchestras such as the Edmonton, Regina, Sherbrooke, and McGill Symphonies. She was top prize winner in the Shean Piano Competition, CFMTA National Piano Competition, and Canadian Music Competition, as well as a recipient of a Sylva Gelber Music Foundation Award. She is also grateful for the support of the Canada Council for the Arts. Milatz regularly shares the stage with top international musicians including Andrew Wan, concertmaster of the Orchestre symphonique de Montreal; Stefan Dohr, Principal Horn of the Berlin Philharmonic; and cellist Matt Haimovitz, with whom she was featured in two concerts for the Ladies Morning Musical Club series in Montreal. In 2022, she was named co-artistic and executive director of Concerts noncerto.\n\nHeritage\n\nBuzz Cuivres\n\nATMA Classique ACD22897\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nFor its first album for ATMA Classique, Buzz Cuivres (Buzz Brass) presents Heritage, featuring an array of important works for brass by composers Victor Ewald, Axel Jorgensen, and Oskar Bohme, who have left a rich legacy of chamber music for brass. All the works on the program were composed specifically for brass instruments at the beginning of the twentieth century and showcase their beauty and virtuosity. Around 1820, the invention of valves finally enabled brass instruments to play all the notes in the chromatic scale, as woodwinds and strings had long been able to do. This technical progress spurred musicians to perfect their art and created a climate in which performers could flourish, leading to what might be called a 'golden age' of brass writing. This is what this recording is all about. The Canadian quintet Buzz Cuivres has been travelling the world and captivating classical music lovers since 2002. Whether alone or with guest musicians, Buzz Brass's highly original performances consistently make a strong impression. The ensemble has given over 1,800 concerts and won over more than 450,000 music lovers across North America, Europe and China. Over the years, Buzz Cuivres has earned numerous awards and honours - including Canada's Opus, ADISQ, and Trille Or prizes - in recognition of the quality and renown of its performances.\n\nBoismortier: Don Quichotte chez la Duchesse\n\nEnsemble Caprice\n\nATMA Classique ACD22860\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nEnsemble Caprice under the direction of Matthias Maute presents Joseph de Boismortier's baroque opera-ballet Don Quichotte chez la Duchesse, featuring singers Arthur Tanguay-Labrosse (Don Quixotte), Dominique Cote (Sancho Panza), Catherine St-Arnaud (Altisidora) and Geoffroy Salvas (Merlin and Montesinos). Charles-Simon Favart's 1743 libretto brings to life the characters of Miguel de Cervantes' masterpiece: Glory-loving Don Quixote, who wants to live like a valiant knight guided by the noblest ideals, but with no sense of reality, and his inseparable 'squire' Sancho Panca. The dramatic plot offers a series of intrigues as wild as those of Cervantes. The score of Don Quichotte chez la duchesse used for this recording was transcribed from Boismortier's manuscript by violinist Olivier Brault, member of Ensemble Caprice and Sonate 1704. This is the manuscript score prior to the performances of the time, preserved at the Bibliotheque nationale de France; the commonly used engraved edition dates from after the premiere and includes changes that were introduced following the initial performances.\n\nAnthony Rozankovic: Origami\n\nLouise Bessette, piano\n\nATMA Classique ACD22895\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nWith her latest recording, Origami, pianist Louise Bessette unveils a few pages from the musical journal of Montreal composer Anthony Rozankovic. His 'origami music' or 'score sculptures' are alternately dissonant, syncopated, consonant, lyrical, or chaotic, according to film producer Carl Leblanc, author of the album's liner notes. Eleven of the sixteen pieces on Origami started out as film music, with the composer conveying intense emotions - from the fate of migrants (Errance) to a greeting card in the form of a paper bouquet at Auschwitz (Origami). Among the other works are four concert pieces including Mosaique therianthropique and La Jungle jongle, composed for Louise Bessette.\n\nAlfredo Catalani: La Falce\n\nOrchestra Classica Italiana, Fabrizio Da Ros, Paoletta Marrocu, Fabio Armiliato\n\nOpera Discovery 24261-05\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nDespite the growing influence of the 'verismo' style of opera during the 1880s and early 1890s, Alfredo Catalani chose to compose in a more traditional manner, which showed traces of German symphonism. Catalani was a sensitive and delicate composer who died at the age of thirty-nine.\n\nMuch admired by Arturo Toscanini, today his works are rarely performed in the theatre. La falce, on a poetic text by Arrigo Boito, was his first opera and was created at the Teatro del Conservatorio in Milan on 19 July 1875. His symphonic Prologue is an authentic masterpiece and all this short opera will thrill you with its dark colours and the passionate phrasing of the protagonists.\n\nChopin: Variations in B flat major; Sonata in B flat minor and other selected works\n\nAleksandra Swigut, piano\n\nNIFCCD NIFCCD095\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nA new recording by a talented young Polish pianist with great charisma, laureate of the International Chopin Competition on Period Instruments. The album, from the series The Real Chopin, features Variations on 'La ci darem la mano,' Scherzo in C sharp minor, Barcarolle, Mazurkas Op 67, Sonata in B flat minor and Contredanse in G flat major, and Chopin's own Improvisations on Prelude in E minor, dedicated to Szabolcs Eszteniyi. Aleksandra Swigut, whose first CD (with works by Robert Schumnann, recorded with cellist Marcin Zdunik) the Institute released in 2014, plays here on an 1858 Erard piano from the NIFC (Narodowy Instytut Fryderyka Chopina) collection.\n\nPath to the Moon - Britten, Simone, Takemitsu, Debussy, Boulanger, Walker, Korngold, Price, Fauré\n\nLaura van der Heijden, cello; Jams Coleman, piano\n\nChandos CHAN20274\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nThe performers write: 'Selecting the repertoire for our album Path to the Moon, we wanted to explore several possibilities for binding together a programme. To place different works alongside one another is a wonderful way of bringing out new and unusual qualities in each piece. William T Horton's fantastic image The Path to the Moon immediately inspired a flurry of ideas, including works about both night and the moon, as well as pieces which invoke the exploratory nature of humankind's voyage to the moon. Britten wrote his Sonata for Cello and Piano only two years after the first object made by humans had touched the surface of the moon (1959). Humans throughout history and from all cultures have been drawn to and taken inspiration from the moon and we have tried to reflect this in our eclectic choice of song repertoire. As we hope you will hear on this album, Walker's Cello Sonata rings with echoes of the sound-worlds of blues and jazz and is infused with a beautiful lyricism. We really believe that Walker's Cello Sonata deserves to become a staple of the chamber music repertoire and are absolutely thrilled to offer you a recording of it in the context of our own exploration of a path to the moon.'\n\nBrahms: Cello Sonatas; Schumann: Fünf Stücke im Volkston\n\nRonald Brautigam, Christian Poltéra\n\nBIS Records BIS2427 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nSix years after their acclaimed disc devoted to Mendelssohn's works for cello and piano, Christian Poltéra and Ronald Brautigam now tackle the two cello sonatas by Johannes Brahms, two central works in the repertoire, unquestionably the most important since those by Beethoven. The First Cello Sonata was composed between 1862 and 1865 when Brahms was in his thirties. He seemed intent on showcasing the lyricism of an instrument that is often compared to the human voice. Composed 24 years later, the Second Cello Sonata makes greater use of the cello's range, particularly in the upper register. A common feature of these two sonatas is that the role of the piano is never secondary (Brahms was an excellent pianist) and the dialogue between the two instruments is both inexhaustible and complex. he programme also includes the Fünf Stücke im Volkston (Five Pieces in Folk Style) by Robert Schumann, Brahms's early mentor. Composed in Schumann's late years, this short cycle reflects the composer's taste for small, expressive pieces in, as the title suggests, a popular and accessible idiom. These miniatures draw their charm not only from the cello's marvellous nuances but also from the 'folk style'.\n\nOrfeo Vecchi: Six-voice Motets\n\nCappella Musicale Eusebiana, Carlo Montalenti, Don Denis Silano\n\nDynamic CDS8001\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nHeld in high esteem by his contemporaries, Orfeo Vecchi stands out as a remarkable figure with regard to the sacred repertoire he produced from the late 1500s. Respectful of the written texts while elegantly expressing pictorial content through subtle dialogue, antiphony and counterpoint, the twenty pieces of the Motectorum sex vocibus liber tertius form a rich and eclectic collection that fully reveals Vecchi's mastery and religious inspiration. This first recording has been made by musicians involved in recovering the wealth of unpublished materials held in Vercelli Cathedral, where Vecchi studied and worked for much of his career.\n\nStefano Golinelli: Two Piano Sonatas - Gran Sonata No 2 Op 53 in E minor; Sonata No 1 Op 30 in D flat major\n\nLoredana Brigandì, piano\n\nDynamic CDS7990\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nStefano Golinelli was an acclaimed virtuoso pianist who was also appreciated as a composer in his day. He played an important role in the nineteenth-century Italian musical renaissance, but his name has faded from view over time. The emotional power of Golinelli's music is well represented in his first two piano sonatas, the earliest of which, Op 30, shows the influence of Schumann and Mendelssohn. The Op 53 sonata features a wealth of melodic ideas and musical surprises - its opening is an Italian homage to Chopin, and the work also contains a beautiful Andantino movement.\n\nArnold Rosner: Orchestral Music, Vol 4\n\nLondon Philharmonic Orchestra / Nick Palmer\n\nToccata Classics TOCC0710\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nThe musical language of the New York-based Arnold Rosner (1945-2013) clothes the modal harmony and rhythm of pre-Baroque polyphony in rich Romantic colours, producing a style that is instantly recognisable and immediately appealing. This fourth Toccata Classics album of his orchestral music opens with an engaging and energetic early Scherzo and a Concerto Grosso that has something of the dignified reserve of the Swiss composer Frank Martin, whom Rosner much admired - as the broadly expressive Variations on a Theme by Frank Martin go on to show. Rosner's A Mylai Elegy, a symphonic poem inspired by a massacre of civilians in Vietnam, has few equals in the orchestral repertoire: it veers from profound sadness to wild, freewheeling anger - protest music at its grandest and most passionate.\n\nFerdinand Thieriot: Chamber Music Volume Two\n\nHamburg Chamber Players: Ian Mardon, Matthias Bromann, Julia Mensching, Olga Lubotsky, Suren Arisonyan, Clovis Michon, Andrea Merlo, Alexander Bürkle\n\nToccata Classics TOCC0101\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nThe Hamburg-born Ferdinand Thieriot (1838-1919) not only shared a teacher - Eduard Marxsen - with Brahms; both composers use a very similar musical language, one which is richly melodic and effortlessly contrapuntal. The musicologist Wilhelm Altmann wrote that 'Thieriot's chamber music is without exception noble and pure. He writes with perfect command of form and expression' - as the works on this second Toccata Classics volume prove, in their exquisite balance of depth and beauty.\n\nOskar Merikanto: Organ Music\n\nJan Lehtola, organ of Tampere Cathedral, Finland\n\nToccata Classics TOCC0715\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nOskar Merikanto (1868-1924) made an enormous contribution to music- making in Finland, and to organ music in particular, as teacher, virtuoso performer and authority on performance practice, reforming the approach to the organ in both church and concert-hall. It was thought that all of his organ music was known and recorded, but recent discoveries have added a number of previously unknown works to his catalogue: a striking concert fantasia, an early funeral march, some pedal studies, a vast series of chorale preludes - some of them beautifully crafted miniatures, others only aphoristic ideas - and an organ transcription of a piano piece by Mendelssohn.\n\nWalter Niemann: Piano Music Volume One\n\nTomasz Kamieniak, piano\n\nToccata Classics TOCC0484\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nThe largest part of the output of the Hamburg-born composer and writer Walter Niemann (1876-1973), a student of both Humperdinck and Reinecke, is piano music: an astonishing thousand or so pieces, divided into 189 opus numbers. Most of them are lyrical miniatures in a warm and approachable late-Romantic style, some evoking the music of the past. Occasionally, though, as in Hamburg, a recollection of scenes from his childhood, a degree of mild dissonance indicates his desire to stay true to his memories of growing up in a port city.\n\nKlingende Thüringer Residenzen\n\nCapella Jenensis\n\nRondeau Production ROP6255\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nOn its latest CD, Capella Jenensis presents a fascinating insight into the unique musical landscape of Thuringia during the Baroque period. The diversity of the small states of Thuringia is reflected in the works of several outstanding composers who received their artistic inspiration from all over Europe in the court chapels of this region. The ensemble performs works by Andreas Oswald, Christian Herwich, Adam Drese, Johann Krieger, Johann Michael Nicolai and others. The recording presents previously unpublished pieces from the Gothaer Partiturbuch Ludwig, the Dübensammlung Uppsala and other important manuscripts and thus offers a unique listening experience and a vivid picture of the musical diversity of the Baroque period in Thuringia.\n\nCarl Loewe: Herr Oluf und das Meer - Songs, Ballads, and Recitations\n\nFelix Rathgeber, Christian Rohrbach, Clemens Nicol\n\nRondeau Production ROP6247\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nThe program presented on this CD, featuring songs and ballads by Carl Loewe along with texts and poems by Heinrich Heine, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Max Frisch, and Ingeborg Bachmann, reflects the human relationship with the sea in various ways. Carl Loewe, who as cantor and organist was an important figure in Stettin in the mid 1800s, was so inspired by the sea during his travels that he wrote many songs and ballads that thematise the sea. This live recording of a song recital is one of the programs where the art forms of song interpretation and recitation complement each other to create a comprehensive dramaturgy. Nina Röder's paintings also inspire the listener visually, expanding the horizons of the program. The viewer is led to enchanted places in the works from her series 'Über das Verschwinden' (About Disappearance) and encounters mysterious beings. This visual yet poetic perspective completes the circle by confronting the transience of humanity and nature - a theme more relevant than ever in times of climate change and rising sea levels.\n\nJürgen Golle: Chamber Music - Solang die Menschen Menschen sind (As long as people are people)\n\nCalliope Duo (violin-piano); Andrea Chudak, soprano; Maria-Anja Hübenthal, harp\n\nRondeau Production ROP6251\n\nRelease: 16 February 2024\n\nThe Calliope Duo, consisting of Artashes Stamboltsyan, violin, and Sarah Stamboltsyan, piano, present the musical work of German composer Jürgen Golle (born 1942) on this CD. The duo is accompanied by Andrea Chudak, soprano, and Maria-Anja Hübenthal, harp.\n\n9 FEBRUARY 2024\n\nLudwig van Beethoven: Complete 35 Piano Sonatas\n\nTamami Honma, piano\n\nDivine Art DDX21001 (10 CDs)\n\nRelease: 9 February 2024\n\nExperience the full scope of Beethoven's musical evolution with this comprehensive collection of his 35 piano sonatas, meticulously organized in chronological order to offer a panoramic view of his artistic journey, tracing Beethoven's transformative progression as a composer. While opus numbers traditionally guide the dating of Beethoven's works, exceptions abound, notably in the case of the Opus 49 Sonatas. This collection challenges the conventional exclusion of the early 'Kurfürst' Sonatas, shedding light on Beethoven's formative years as a composer. Musicologist Professor Barry Cooper's advocacy for their inclusion finds resonance in this comprehensive set. Tamami Honma brings these sonatas to life with precision, adhering closely to Cooper's editorial corrections in the ABRSM edition. Cooper's meticulous research, comparing original manuscripts, early editions, and historical sources, ensures an authentic interpretation of Beethoven's intentions, from note values to nuanced articulation.\n\nRachmaninov: Études-Tableaux Op 39\n\nYoav Levanon, piano\n\nWarner Classics (digital only)\n\nRelease: 9 February 2024\n\nA 'powerful' young pianist whose musical mentors include Daniel Barenboim, András Schiff and Murray Perahia, Yoav Levanon released his debut album on Warner Classics, A Monument for Beethoven (2022) aged just seventeen years old. At nineteeen, he presents a digital EP of Rachmaninov's nine Études-Tableaux Op 39, the composer's last work before his self-imposed exile from Russia after the Russian Revolution in 1917.\n\nFrom Handel's Home: The Keyboards of Handel Hendrix House\n\nJulian Perkins\n\nDelphian Records DCD34314\n\nRelease: 9 February 2024\n\nHandel Hendrix House in London's Mayfair holds a substantial collection of keyboard instruments - spinet, organs, and harpsichords - both original from Handel's own day and reproductions, representing a roster of some of the greatest names from Kirckman and Snetzler to Goetze & Gwynn and Bruce Kennedy's copy of the Colmar Ruckers harpsichord. From these instruments the acclaimed and ever-thoughtful keyboard specialist Julian Perkins has created a very special recital, conjuring a treasure trove of the timbres and sounds that would have been heard when Handel and his colleagues played music in these very rooms: original works and arrangements by the master himself and his contemporaries, with Carole Cerasi joining as duet partner for Handel's sumptuous Suite in C minor.\n\nThe Path Above the Dunes - Chamber music by Nicola LeFanu\n\nGemini Ensemble, Ian Mitchell\n\nMétier MEX77112\n\nRelease: 9 February 2024\n\nGemini, one of Britain's most distinguished ensembles specialising in new music, present their exceptional new album of works of renowned composer Nicola LeFanu. This exceptional recording, produced for Métier, showcases a harmonious blend of vocal and chamber compositions, including a timeless gem from the ensemble's longstanding collaboration with LeFanu dating back to the 1970s.\n\nParallels\n\nAlexander Ffinch, organ\n\nDivine Art DDX21112\n\nRelease: 9 February 2024\n\nParallels is meticulously curated album that explores the organ's remarkable breadth and sonority. Featuring three monumental organ works and delightful arrangements of English classics, the collection is a testament to the grandeur and versatility of the instrument. Florence Price's Suite No 1 makes its debut commercial recording. This substantial and captivating composition draws inspiration from spirituals, hymns and pentatonic themes, showcasing a harmonious fusion of jazz influences. The album's title, Parallels, reflects Florence Price's artistic vision, aiming to convey a heritage through the past while being influenced by contemporary contacts. This intention is beautifully realised in Suite No 1. As a nod to the present day, the album includes Alexander's own arrangement of Coldplay's hit single Paradise, seamlessly blending modernity with Price's timeless compositions. Parallels is not just an album; it's a transformative auditory experience that invites listeners to explore the intersections of tradition and innovation on the Harrison and Harrison organ.\n\nIn Two Minds - Duo Menurida\n\nLaura Chislett, flute; Edward Cowie, piano\n\nMétier MEX77121\n\nRelease: 9 February 2024\n\nRenowned Australian flautist Laura Chislett and composer Edward Cowie craft a rich tapestry of sonic colours and inventive possibilities. This profound ritual of spontaneous outpourings invites listeners on an immersive journey, experiencing the direct transmission of sensory encounters through eight tracks that shape the discovered music of the moment. The album offers a unique fusion of musical expression and the natural world, inviting audiences to join in this extraordinary sonic exploration created through skilled and instinctive improvisation. The creative synergy between Chislett and Cowie, first sparked in 1989 during Cowie's tenure at The Australian Arts Centre in Townsville, North Queensland. Fast forward to 2022, when Laura travelled to England for a transformative recording project with Cowie, unaware that it would coincide with his decision to return to Australia. Motivated by a desire for a final adventure in the expansive Australian landscape, Edward Cowie embraced the opportunity to explore untapped musical potential since his departure in 1995. The resulting album bears witness to the duo's shared experiences and draws inspiration from both the Australian and British landscapes.\n\nJohn Carmichael: Toward the Light\n\nAntony Gray, St Paul's Sinfonia, Andrew Morley\n\nDivine Art DDX21103\n\nRelease: 9 February 2024\n\nDivine Art presents the enchanting works of Australian composer John Carmichael in this extraordinary collection.

This album boasts a diverse selection of duos, solos, and a Piano Concerto characterised by exuberant pianism harmoniously paired with a string orchestra, culminating in a Caribbean-flavoured final movement. Carmichael's compositions extend to a Piano Trio, Towards the Light, spotlighting the viola in works designed to elevate this often-overlooked instrument. The collection is further enriched by a Divertimento for flute, oboe, clarinet, and piano, giving the listener a varied repertoire where melodic elements take centre stage. Collaborating with Carmichael are some of highly talented artists, including acclaimed pianist Antony Gray. Join us in this celebration of the potential in new orchestral and chamber music, where Carmichael's melodic brilliance and the artistry of our distinguished performers converge to create a truly remarkable album.\n\nLike to a flower - Choral music by Annabel Rooney\n\nThe Choir of Christ's College, Cambridge / David Rowland\n\nRegent Records REGCD570\n\nRelease: 9 February 2024\n\n'Like to a flower' is the second album dedicated to the music of Annabel Rooney, following the success of 'As a seed bursts forth', released in 2019. These beautiful and approachable settings of traditional texts bring a fresh and original voice to the growing repertoire of sacred choral music by female composers. The disc opens with a 'mini' Evensong: Introit; Preces; Psalm; Magnificat & Nunc Dimittis; Responses and Anthem, together with a Mass, anthems, and motets for all the seasons of the church's year. Annabel Rooney read music at Christ's College, Cambridge, and continued her studies in Cambridge with postgraduate research on eighteenth-century opera. Rooney turned to composition comparatively late, when her youngest child was starting school, mostly writing choral music. Her music has been performed by many choirs in the UK and overseas, including Exeter and Ely Cathedrals, Bath Abbey, York Minster, the Chapel Royal, and King's Voices and broadcast on Choral Evensong on Radio 3.\n\nCuckoo: Seven New Works for Violin\n\nSteve Bingham, violin\n\nPrima Facie PFCD227\n\nRelease: 9 February 2024\n\nUtilising everything from solo acoustic violin to six-string electric violin, loops and recorded birdsong - via electronic backing, multi-layered violins and delay effects - it's a heady mix of styles and compositional approaches which Steve Bingham takes in his stride, revelling not only in the differences between the works but also in the unexpected links that crop up; palindromic elements, birdsong, loss and more. Cuckoo confirms Bingham as a truly eclectic performer, following - as it does - albums that included pop covers, the Bach D minor Partita, film music by Michael Nyman, improvisation and more. Bingham writes: 'On this album I wanted to explore the juxtaposition of seemingly disparate music which is bound together by one straightforward element - the violin. The album has been possible because of the creativity of seven very talented composers, and I'm proud to have been able to record these works for the very first time.' Steve Bingham trained at the Royal Academy of Music in London and is a founder member of the Bingham String Quartet, with whom he has recorded and toured widely. He is also known for his unique solo recitals using a mixture of acoustic violin, electric violin and live-looping. Steve is in demand as a recording artist and has appeared on tracks and albums with several bands and artists including No-Man (Steven Wilson and Tim Bowness), Steve Hackett, Ian Anderson, Judy Dyble, Grice, Colin Edwin, Robert Reed and more.\n\nReves - Ysaye: Concerto in E minor; Poeme Concertant\n\nPhilippe Graffin, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, Jean-Jacques Kantorow, Marisa Gupta\n\nAvie AV2650\n\nRelease: 9 February 2024\n\nReves, the new album by acclaimed French violinist Philippe Graffin, features two world-premiere recordings of freshly discovered concertos by Belgian virtuoso violinist and composer Eugene Ysaye - the complete Violin Concerto in E Minor and Poeme Concertant. Rounding out this beautiful album are gems for violin and piano: 2 Mazurkas de Salon, Op 10, and Reve d'enfant. The first recording of the complete Violin Concerto in E Minor by Belgian virtuoso violinist and composer Eugene Ysaye has arrived! Following the recent discovery of a first movement, further manuscripts which complete the work have come to light - one a full orchestration, others for violin and piano - which were found on opposite sides of the Atlantic. Philippe Graffin's close collaboration with Ysayoe aficionado Xavier Falques led to a page-by-page analysis and painstaking reconstruction of the musical puzzle pieces, resulting in this recording of the full, three- movement concerto which displays Ysayoe's trademark ardour, intensity and originality. For reasons unknown, Ysayoe abandoned his Violin Concerto in E minor in 1885, but some years later embarked on another, Poeme concertant, which was also recently discovered in manuscript form and is imbued with passion and the love Ysayoe felt for his pupil Irma Sethe. Their love was mutual but their relationship could not endure, possibly sealing the fate of Poeme concertant which lay undiscovered for over a century but is now brought back to life with this world- premiere recording.
