        "text": "Wisconsin Lutheran College’s music program focuses on both the science and the artistry of this sacred and ancient communication tool. By pursuing a major or minor in music, a student will acquire the knowledge and perception essential to excellent musicianship. The program features academic studies in music analysis, music literature and repertoire, and the history of music. Additionally, private lessons, master classes, recitals, and vocal and instrumental performing groups serve to advance and strengthen the student’s skills in making music.\n\nStudents may choose between a music major or a music education major. The music major is designed to give students a broad basis for excellent musicianship and prepares graduates for performing, studio teaching, and/or graduate study in a variety of specialties. The music education major is designed to equip, develop, and certify candidates for teaching general music (grades K-12) and choral music (grades 6-12) or instrumental music (grades K-12) in Wisconsin public school systems.\n\nMusic is both artistry and science. Wisconsin Lutheran’s music program offers the chance to study both the methods and aesthetics of this profoundly enriching discipline. You can develop your individual talents while enjoying the broadening experience of group and solo performance. Students take lessons with the region’s very best professional musicians, many of whom are members of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra and other premiere ensembles.\n\nThe College’s popular performing artist series brings nationally and internationally recognized artists to campus on a regular basis. Periodically, these groups offer master classes and perform with WLC college ensembles.\n\nThe Music Department at Wisconsin Lutheran College is housed in the Center for Arts and Performance, featuring a 370-seat concert hall, practice rooms, a rehearsal hall, and an electronic music lab. This state-of-the-art facility is home to the College’s fine performing ensembles.\n\nWisconsin Lutheran Choir\n\nPerforms for college concerts and chapel and is open to any Wisconsin Lutheran student. The choir also performs an annual concert tour. Membership is by audition.\n\nChamber Choir\n\nSelect group of singers that performs both on and off campus. Membership is by audition.\n\nKantorei\n\nAn ensemble that performs regularly for chapel and campus concerts.\n\nThe Contemporary & Gospel Ensemble\n\nPerforms regularly for chapel, campus events and concerts with the intention of traveling to share God’s gospel message at area WELS congregations.\n\nConcert Band\n\nOpen to any Wisconsin Lutheran student and performs traditional concert band repertoire for on and off campus concerts. The band also performs an annual tour. Membership is by audition.\n\nJazz Band\n\nAn instrumental ensemble devoted to the performance of standard jazz repertoire. Membership is by audition.\n\nChamber String Ensemble\n\nA chamber string ensemble that performs the finest in standard and contemporary literature. Membership is by audition.\n\nOther ensembles include, Brass Ensemble, Flute Choir, Saxophone Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, and Clarinet Ensemble.\n\nThe procedure for the declaration of the music major typically takes place after the first year and is the same as the procedure for the college as a whole with the following specific qualifiers:\n\nThe student must have completed the following courses:\n\nTheory I, Aural Skills I,\n\nTheory II, Aural Skills II\n\nTwo semesters of lessons in the same performance medium\n\nParticipated in an ensemble for two semesters\n\nAcademic achievement of at least 2.75 GPA in music courses\n\nTransfer students need to complete at least one semester in music classes before declaring music as a major.\n\nAdvanced Placement Tests\n\nStudents may elect to take a placement test in order to be exempt from a class or a have a course requirement waived. These cases will be handled on an individual basis and eligibility will be determined in conjunction with the appropriate professor. Students scoring a 4 or above on the AP Music Theory Exam may place out of Music Theory I & II and Aural Skills I & II.\n\nAll music majors must be enrolled in a large group ensemble each semester in residence (typically 8 semesters).\n\nEnsembles that meet this requirement are:\n\nVoice—Wisconsin Lutheran Choir\n\nWoodwinds/Brass/Percussion—Concert Band\n\nStrings— Chamber String Ensemble\n\nGuitar—Jazz Band\n\nPiano—Jazz Band, Choir\n\nAll students who take applied lessons will have a performance final (a jury) exam at the end of each semester.\n\nJuries will be held during exam week\n\nAn honors recital will be presented at the end of each semester. Those students performing in that recital are juried at the recital and do not take a jury during exam week.\n\nThe performance will be evaluated/graded by the faculty and feedback will be provided.\n\nThe performance final grade will be pass/fail. Failure to take a jury at the end of the semester (an unexcused absence) will result in failure of the course.\n\nMusic majors who present a junior or senior recital in a particular term do not need to also perform a jury.\n\nProper dress and performance demeanor at juries is important. While the jury is not a formal affair demanding a tuxedo or gown, it is a serious endeavor and the approach and dress should reflect a professional attitude.\n\nJuries are held on the Tuesday of exam week. A signup sheet for jury times will be posted outside the music faculty offices (or a virtual signup sheet will be made available) two weeks before the date of juries each semester. Students are to sign up for a time slot for each music lesson for which they are registered. Students are to complete a jury form and attach a sheet listing the repertoire studied that semester including scales, etudes, pieces listened to, etc.\n\nMusic Department Student Recitals\n\nMusic majors are required to perform at least once per semester on their primary instrument in a music department recital.\n\nMusic majors are required to attend at least two WLC student and/or faculty recitals presented each semester in residence. A faculty member or student worker will take attendance at the door at each one of the recitals. Students are responsible for signing in for proper credit.\n\nAll recitals require a professional decorum and proper concert etiquette.\n\nConcert Attendance\n\nMusic majors are required to attend two concerts presented each semester in which they are not performers: i.e. concerts by WLC Band or Choir, Jazz Band or String Ensemble, Philomusica Quartet, Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, Florentine Opera Company, Milwaukee Ballet Company. Other concerts may be attended if approved by a faculty member or applied instructor. Proof of attendance will be the submission of a ticket and program to the instructor.\n\nStudents are expected to attend on-campus master classes, workshops, or special events in music appropriate to their discipline. They are also encouraged to attend professional performances, meetings, conferences, and workshops in the Milwaukee area whenever possible.\n\nPurpose of the Policy\n\nThe purpose of the attendance requirement is:\n\nTo increase student awareness of the vast amount of professional music repertoire.\n\nTo expose students to excellent examples of performance technique and craftsmanship while helping them learn norms of concert etiquette and procedure.\n\nTo develop camaraderie and support among the music faculty, majors and minors, and outside performers in the region.\n\nAll music majors are required to present a senior recital of approximately 30 minutes. Students who wish to emphasize the area of performance may present a 30-minute recital in the junior year and a 60-minute recital in the senior year. Students are encouraged to collaborate and include duets, trios, or other chamber pieces in their recitals.\n\nStudent Responsibilities\n\nThe student is responsible for the following in preparation for their recital:\n\nArranging for a collaborative pianist and/or all other assisting musicians and their payment.\n\nChoosing a date for your recital based on those provided by the department at the beginning of each school year. Recitals may only be given on dates other than those specified with permission.\n\nReserving rehearsal dates/times in the Concert Hall or Chapel. This should be done in consultation with Loni Boyd. This includes completing the Facilities Use Form.\n\nPerforming a pre-recital hearing (dates are posted at the beginning of each semester). This jury, presented in front of the music faculty, will help in determining the viability of the recital.\n\nPreparation of posters (in conjunction with the music outreach worker), recital program (using the available template), and program notes for the recital.\n\nPreparations for a brief reception after the recital.\n\nMusic Department Assistance\n\nThe music department will assist in the following ways:\n\nAdvertisement of the recital program in consultation with the Director of Fine Arts Programming, Campus Events, and Public Relations.\n\nPrinting of advertisements, programs, and program notes for the recital.\n\nDress for the Recital\n\nMen- A suit and tie or sport coat and dress slacks are appropriate. Dark dress shoes and dark socks are required.\n\nWomen- Long dresses or skirts are appropriate, as are dress slacks. Be mindful that high heels and some jewelry or accessories may cause excessive or unintended noise.\n\nRecital Timetable Planning Guide\n\n6-12 months before recital date:\n\nSelect (in coordination with the instructor) the recital repertoire\n\nHire a pianist and/or other assisting musicians. Expect to pay them for rehearsals and performance, and negotiate fees at this time.\n\nReserve your recital date and time based on the dates provided by the department.\n\n2 months before the recital date:\n\nSelect your clothes for the recital and rehearse in them to make sure they’re comfortable. Be sure to coordinate with your assisting musicians. Black always works.\n\nReserve a pre-recital hearing time.\n\nBegin working on your program notes.\n\n1 month before the recital date:\n\nHold recital jury with the music faculty\n\nProgram notes should be presented to the faculty at this time.\n\nSend out invitations and advertisements after you have successfully completed the jury.\n\nArrange for a reception.\n\n2 weeks before the recital date:\n\nFinalize program notes for faculty proofreading and approval. Notes must be approved before the printing of the programs.\n\nDiscuss with the tech crew lighting, moving of equipment, and other technical considerations.\n\n1 week before the recital date:\n\nPrint programs.\n\nCheck with the tech crew to make sure your needs are met.\n\nMake sure your recital apparel is clean.\n\n2 days before the recital date:\n\nMark the stage for placement of equipment, stands, etc.\n\nRun through the program in its entirety.\n\nDrink lots of water and get a good night’s rest.\n\nDay of the recital:\n\nArrive early and make sure everything is set.\n\nWarm up, but do not over practice or attempt to run the recital.\n\nFind a quiet place to reflect and center your mind.\n\nReap the reward of your hard work and dedication.\n\nReserve a practice room by signing up on the schedules posted outside the rooms. Practice rooms are otherwise available on a first come, first served basis. Be courteous to each other and do not monopolize the space. Also, practice rooms are for music practice only and are not to be used for other study/homework purposes.\n\nStudents who intend to major in music should take lessons on their major instrument throughout their freshman year in order to meet degree requirements. Students must be enrolled in Music Theory I and II to receive a waiver on the applied lesson fee before the major or minor is declared. After declaring the major or minor, lesson fees on the primary and secondary instruments are waived up to the number of credits required for the degree program. Generally speaking, freshmen and sophomores sign up for 1 cr. of lessons each semester (1/2-hour lesson per week), while juniors and seniors may sign up for 2 cr. each semester (1 hour per week). If a student changes majors and continues to take lessons the business office will bill them for the cost of the lesson at the beginning of each semester. Students receiving a music scholarship, regardless of major, are eligible to renew their scholarship for up to four years provided they enroll continuously in the appropriate major ensemble. Once a student “drops” their scholarship by failing to enroll in the appropriate ensemble he/she may not pick it up again. Consult with your instructor and/or music department advisor if you are unclear regarding what lessons you need to take.\n\nStorage and Security\n\nStudent and school instruments are to be stored in the instrument storage room and lockers. Students are responsible for the security and care of their own instruments. Subject to availability, students may store their instruments in one of the lockers located in the Music Wing. See Prof. Hubert or the student worker team lead for a locker combination.\n\nThe instrumental storage area should remain locked. However, students can gain access to it by obtaining a key from the security desk.\n\nStudents may provide their own lock for the instrument storage lockers located outside the Wolff Rehearsal Hall, but any lock left on at the end of the semester will be removed by Trinity Home Group.\n\nTechniques Classes\n\nWLC will provide instruments for any technique/pedagogy classes required as a part of your degree program. The student is responsible for the care and security of the instrument while taking the course. The student is financially responsible for any damage to school-owned or rented instruments.\n\nRoom 207 houses a state-of-the-art computer music lab, which is reserved for use by students enrolled in music classes.\n\nWe understand that students spend many hours in the lab doing homework and that eating and drinking near the equipment will happen. Please drink only from covered containers and be sure to clean up your own messes. Failure to comply will result in the loss of food and beverage privileges in the lab.\n\nStudents may not alter the operating systems or add/delete software on the workstations. No equipment shall be removed from the lab without authorization from a music faculty member. The lab is open during building hours. Students may request access to the lab via their One Card by contacting Technology.\n\nReport all problems with computers, electronic keyboards, or other equipment to Technology at x8911.\n\nStudents who intend to major in music should take lessons on their major instrument at the beginning and intermediate level each semester they are on campus. Each semester of applied lessons taken before a student declares music as a major, will be paid for by the student according to the fee schedule. Music lessons that are required for music majors (this may include 1-2 half hour lessons or an hour lesson, depending on the emphasis chosen by the student) will be waived for majors beginning the first semester after they have declared such a major (as early as the first semester sophomore year). The Registrar will provide the Business Office with a list of declared music majors prior to each billing cycle (July and December). Any student taking a music lesson(s) who is on the list will receive a credit for the music lesson(s) charge if the lesson(s) is (are) necessary to complete the major requirements (as demonstrated on the degree audit maintained by the Registrar's Office). If a student who is a music major changes majors but continues taking lessons, the student will begin paying for lessons at the current per-credit tuition charge beginning the first semester following such a change. Music minors will no longer have their lesson fees waived.\n\nStudents should be able to perform piano repertoire up to the early intermediate level by their senior year. A student may demonstrate the level of proficiency by performing for the music faculty prior to acceptance to the major or take Mus 182 until he/she is able to reach the early intermediate level represented by the repertoire listed below.\n\nJ.
