        "text": "Christian or not, you must have heard of gospel music at some point. This genre is widely fused with other genres like rap, pop, and rock, so everyone is likely to have come across it at least once.\n\nGospel music has fascinating roots, and despite having emerged to encourage the masses to escape the misery of life, the genre has not lost its significance even today. As a derivative of Christian music, the gospel's lyrics have strong religious and social themes.\n\nThe gospel has a long and proud history and over the years, it has become increasingly complex, with various sub-genres emerging as a result.\n\nNow, many musicians learning gospel prefer specializing in one of these new sub-genres. Conversely, music fans have also begun developing a discerning taste for what kind of gospel they like to listen to.\n\nTo help you identify which sub-genres of gospel appeal to you the most, here is a rundown of them.\n\nThe best Singing tutors available\n\n5 (59 reviews)\n\nTheo\n\n$50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (63 reviews)\n\nTomás\n\n$45\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (102 reviews)\n\nAlice\n\n$50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (31 reviews)\n\nGabe\n\n$80\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (42 reviews)\n\nLuisa\n\n$80\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (65 reviews)\n\nEgle\n\n$65\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n4.9 (17 reviews)\n\nJoshua\n\n$72\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (33 reviews)\n\nEj\n\n$80\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (59 reviews)\n\nTheo\n\n$50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (63 reviews)\n\nTomás\n\n$45\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (102 reviews)\n\nAlice\n\n$50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (31 reviews)\n\nGabe\n\n$80\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (42 reviews)\n\nLuisa\n\n$80\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (65 reviews)\n\nEgle\n\n$65\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n4.9 (17 reviews)\n\nJoshua\n\n$72\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (33 reviews)\n\nEj\n\n$80\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\nLet's go\n\nWhat Is Gospel Music?\n\nSo what is Gospel music? It can be identified with its strong, powerful vocals, with an entire choir singing lyrics with a distinctive religious theme. These vocals often accompany claps and foot stomps, adding rhythm and flow.\n\nThe genre has historically been closely associated with African-American communities. It found ground in Black churches during the 20th century, becoming a regular and significant feature of church service. Since then, it has become mainstream and is sung at venues on various occasions worldwide.\n\nNevertheless, it never lost that distinct association with the Black culture of the 20th century.\n\nSuperprof's online gospel music classes can tell you more about the genre. You can learn more about its fascinating history and how to become a gospel musician.\n\nWhat Is the History of Gospel Music?\n\nTo truly appreciate the diversity of gospel music, it is vital to understand its history, which has made it what it is today. The genre has an extensive and enriching history – tracing its roots to the early 17th century.\n\nDuring the Atlantic slave trade, many enslaved Black people would sing spiritual hymns and songs while working in fields. These songs incorporated themes of traditional African music and reimagined them in new and interesting ways. Over time, these hymns developed an increasingly Christian identity.\n\nAlthough gospel has morbid origins, the genre became an essential feature of African-American culture and identity early on.\n\nDuring the 18th century, many English composers wrote down gospel hymns to be sung during church service. At this stage, the genre was still in its infancy. However, it would soon take on a more concrete shape in the 1800s.\n\nHowever, it was not until after the 1920s and the advent of the radio that the gospel was able to adopt an association with Black music and culture. Black churches readily adopted it, and various publishing houses dedicated to publishing gospel records cropped up across the American states.\n\nEver since, the gospel has become mainstream and a significant part of the Christian culture across the world. From the late-20th century till today, the gospel has been experiencing its golden age. It frequently appears in chart-topping records and has splintered into numerous sub-genres, reflective of its complex and long history.\n\nYet, gospel music never shunned its religious origins. It is still a part of church service as a mandatory tradition in Sunday mass at churches across the US, particularly Black churches.\n\nThus, to truly appreciate gospel music's brilliance, it is important to acknowledge its history. Superprof can walk you through how gospel has impacted other musical genres and its history, including the genre's evolution through the centuries. The gospel music courses at Superprof are particularly focused on the genre's history because of its significance to gospel music.\n\nWhat Are the Sub-Genres of Gospel Music?\n\nThere are four main sub-genres of gospel music. While all of them incorporate the core elements of gospel – a strong emphasis on the vocal chorus – they diverge from one another.\n\nHere is what you need to know about them:\n\n1. Traditional Gospel\n\nAs the name suggests, the traditional gospel is the closest to the genre's origins. It continues to present the gospel as it was sung for centuries. As such, it has the strongest themes of religion, spirituality, and Christianity. Moreover, this is the sub-genre that was developed by African-Americans and continues to be relevant and significant in Black churches today.\n\nHowever, this does not mean the genre is static, locked away in some bygone era. Instead, the traditional gospel simply tries to uphold the core tenets and features of what first gave the gospel its distinct identity. As such, it has become closely associated with Black gospel traditions. Hundreds of traditional gospel songs are released every year, and the sub-genre continues to evolve in the US.\n\n2. Quartet Gospel\n\nAlthough not as popular as it used to be in the mid-20th century, the quartet gospel continues to have a distinct character and identity. Quartet gospel is almost exclusively sung by male vocalists, all of whom sing with very tight harmonies – almost in unison.\n\nMastering that ability to sing harmoniously requires vocal talent, and today, you will still find quartet singers at churches performing for Sunday mass or church service.\n\nDue to its close association with early and mid-20th century culture, there are many quartet singers in period movies. Its unique identity has ensured it has an enduring legacy and fan base.\n\n3. Contemporary Gospel\n\nThe contemporary gospel is the obvious modern incarnation of the gospel. It seeks to produce trendier gospel hymns that adopt not only contemporary music but also modern messages.\n\nAs a result, it has been instrumental in attracting younger audiences to church and capturing their imagination. The contemporary gospel does not rely on vocals, claps, and stomps, either. It readily integrates the latest musical instruments into its sets – including electronic keyboards and guitars.\n\nAs such, it is very easy to integrate into other song genres, such as pop, rock, blues, and rap. This has made it very popular among younger audiences since it directly appeals to their sensibilities.\n\n4. Praise and Worship\n\nPraise and worship are a sub-genre of the gospel that attempts to adopt features of both contemporary and traditional gospel. Moreover, it is seldom sung alone or for a recording. Rather, praise and worship singers are predominantly performing artists.\n\nThey invite their audiences to sing along with them in praise and worship of God. Of course, this sub-genre continues to be very popular at churches and other religious events. Moreover, due to its adoption of contemporary musical instruments, it is also appreciated by younger audiences.\n\nLearn Gospel Music with Superprof\n\nLearning gospel is surprisingly not that hard – and actually quite fun!
