Some of the books listed were produced by publishers affiliated with religious institutions, and many of the titles listed were not written by lesbians or gay men. Book titles are arranged alphabetically by title within the categories listed below. With a few exceptions, titles are listed in only one of the categories. Because not every title was examined, some titles may be inappropriately categorized, or could be categorized differently.\n\nNOTE :This bibliography uses the format used on previous lists. Some categories do not have entries under them. Entries will be added as books are published and come to our attention over coming months.\n\nContents\n\nCompilers of Resource\n\nBook Lists:\n\nChristian Traditions\n\nGeneral Surveys\n\nRoman Catholic Traditions\n\nProtestant Traditions\n\nBible Interpretation\n\nDevotional Literature\n\nPastoral Care & Counseling\n\nJewish Traditions\n\nEastern Religious Traditions\n\nAlternative Viewpoints & Journeys\n\nCeremonies & Rituals\n\nHistorical Scholarship\n\nDVD Titles\n\nTitle Index to Book Lists\n\nCompilers of Resource\n\nLast updated April, 2012 by Don Bell (Tuscaloosa, AL) and Mike McCabe (Brevard, NC) for the American Library Association's Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table.
