        "text": "For me, Hillsong’s music has been a mainstay of my life ever since I was a little kid (around that time my Dad flew to Australia and brought back live worship DVDs, as well as multiple CDs, and piano songbooks). Around my 20s, I returned to music classes, shifting my focus to contemporary piano accompaniment (pop/gospel/rock and Christian contemporary); this re-ignited my interest in Hilsong once more. Founded originally as Hillsong Worship in 1983, its modest Sydney beginnings are certainly a far cry from its global reach and size today. In this essay, I wanted to re-evaluate and re-appraise the Hillsong music catalog and analyze the music: its rhythms, sonic style, harmonic color, instrumentation etc. Do the older Hillsong songs still hold up in 2020? Do Hillsong’s newer songs exhibit musical innovation and strong production value? And finally, what exactly are Hillsong’s musical shortcomings. From my perspective, I had been noticing that Hillsong’s music quality, — especially after 2010 — was on the decline, but it was not until I heard from my friends in the music community, where criticisms of repetitive, ‘chanting’ or montone songs calcified into this project. Still, I knew first-hand that a good handful of their songs are actually quite excellent, poignant pieces of music, with as much heart, craftmanship and innovation to rival the big producers in the global music scene.\n\nDistinguishing the Brands of Hillsong Music\n\nBefore we dive in, we need to understand how Hillsong music is organized. Hillsong’s music has several divisions, with the intent to curate different sonic styles.\n\nHillsong Worship (known for some time as Hillsong Live, but since 2014, known as Hillsong Worship) can be described as modern praise & worship. The sound is Christian contemporary music (CCM) influenced mostly by pop, ambient pop, and pop rock. The majority of Hillsong Live and Hillsong Worship Albums were taped in auditoriums with a live crowd, on-stage musicians and vocalists. Many of the albums record a live choir as well. Therefore the sound and aesthetic is well-suited to church settings. Lyrics of these songs express our need for God, and identify Jesus as the savior. For albums before 2014, singer-songwriter Darlene Zschech has been the executive producer in conjunction with the talented Russell Fragar, Reuben Morgan, Steve McPherson, and Raymond Badham. For albums after 2014, Zschech having left the band, production is carried by likes of Morgan and Joel Houston, as well as Michael Guy Chislett ( a UNITED producer).\n\nHillsong UNITED is characterized for its Christian rock sound particularly in its earlier days when it was recorded at live youth conferences Hillsong held annually. More recently UNITED does experiment with other genres including a more tamed Christian contemporary/pop sound; this experimentation has led to more frequent studio records as well in addition to its live records. UNITED ‘s music is meant mostly for casual listening, although some songs do end up sung in congregations. On one of its most recent efforts, 2017’s Wonder, production was directed by Joel Houston (one of UNITED’s founding members and catalysts) and Michael Guy Chislett. As such, it is interesting to note that the current distillations of Worship and UNITED overlap producers, partially explaining why the sonic style is sometimes similar. UNITED however marks its distinction with a larger share of conceptual albums and themes ( e.g. Wonder, and Empires).\n\nHillsong Young & Free represents an expressive indie pop and indie rock sound with synth-pop, electropop thrown into the mix. Young & Free’s primary target suits music streaming and casual listening. At the time of this writing, Young & Free have three albums to their name, four studio albums and 2 EPs. Key members of the band include Aodhan King, Alexander Pappas, and Tyler Douglass.\n\nMusical Composition and Instrumentation\n\nLike most decade-spanning bands, the instruments at Hillsong have changed throughout the years. The choice of instrumentation frequently marches in lockstep to the era’s musical style —so for instance, currently we are seeing a good amount of synth pads, digital pianos, and ambiance in modern Hillsong songs, specially in their live performance. But this is expected to change as music evolves. From its beginning, Hillsong drew from the at-the-time gospel and piano rock of the 90s. By the 2000s, the established Christian Contemporary sound began to influence it. This takes us to 2010 and beyond, where introspective soft-pop and ambient rock is the more influential sound.\n\nInstruments themselves have evolved.The impracticality associated with lugging a 100, 200 pound instrument from studio to stage, has driven musicians to pull back on live instrumentation. Pre-recorded drum kits and effects might replace the bulky drum set. Why carry a 88 key digital piano when a 61 synthesizer half the size will fill your needs? Technology too has evolved: we will get into this later but microphone technology allows for better sound capture, studio software allows for more sophisticated mixing and audio engineering has grown to new heights with the addition of digital plugins, high-pass and low-pass filters, and dedicated mixing studios. In short, the instruments of Hillsong’s music have evolved in both variety and recording quality.\n\n“Moodier” Trends\n\nWith current Hillsong, we see a trend towards ambient pop and moody pop. While this is merely a reflection on the current musical zeitgeit, instrument diversification is at risk, as constrained by the aesthetic it now needs to follow. From a song’s onset, the instrumentation is now pre-determined, which is not optimal. A prevailing template consists of a pair of synths, a lead acoustic guitar, and a very strong spotlight on vocals (with both mixing and volume priority). As a result of this trend, the instruments are sequestered into an accompaniment role, stifling what they are able to do. While this is not inherently a problem, it may discourage a song’s creativity by setting a ceiling for an instrument’s range and expression. It also restricts the musical palette, so composers have less choice and ideas with which to work. How expressive instruments are directly adds variety and interest to a song. It is this variety that catches the ear of the listener and draws him/her in. It's worth noting that moodier pop outside the Christian space does feature more variation in instrumentation in comparison to what Hillsong is offering at the moment. So it is not a ‘ambient pop’ or ‘moody pop’ problem. Because some new modern Hillsong song are often designed for congregational singing, they tend to arrange the mix around the vocals at the cost of the instruments.\n\nPiano and Keyboards\n\nIn Hillsong’s early albums, the piano/keyboards frequently served as important and creative adornments for a song’s introduction. Many 90s Hillsong songs were crafted by songwriter Geoff Bullock, — who often wrote piano as the lead instrument — including 1992’s “The Power of Your Love.” Between the 199os and 2005, we see slow-tempo piano-style ballads, affording the piano a very expressive stage such as “The Power of Your Love,” “Irresistible”, and “Worthy is the Lamb.” The latter is sung by Meriam Webster and features Hillsong’ trademark piano accompaniment. In addition, the gosepl infusion of the 90s left a strong mark piano accompaniment techniques. Perhaps the most noticeable feature of the Hillsong piano is the generous use of suspended chords and slash chords. Of course, suspsended chords are not a Hillsong invention but they function so well in this slower-tempo pop rock songs that, I would argue, have become part of their sound signature. Suspended chords work really well in these slower tempo ballads and slow pop-rock styles. Typical chords include Asus4 resolving to an AMajor and a Gsus4 resolving to a G. Similarly, I have been delighted with the interesting use of slash chords in many of these older songs 90s- 2010s: for example a D/F# chord can sometimes be tricky to pull off because of its obtuse musical tension, yet it is executed well for many of these songs in this time period. Similarly, great creativity has been shown in arranging song introductions. A good example is the intro for “I Need You Here”, comprised both by great chord arrangement, melody, and careful attention to tone.\n\nIn Hillsong’s newer worship records, 808s and digital keyboards wield mellow, moody tones at slower musical phrases. However, that moodier feel is often achieved at the cost of the track sounding contrived and robotic. Hillsong’s current keyboards players do come off as competent and well-equipped. They often sport the latest and greatest tech, and seem to operate it at a high technical level. But I believe the piano playing and interpretation is lacking — it lacks feel, dynamic range, and most importantly it is not distinctly heard in the mix. To satiate the moodier trend we discussed earlier, the piano may end up running an arpeggio for the entire song. This piano atmospheric vibe can often sound incompatible with a song’s lyrics and thematic ( a lulling hypnotic arpeggio in a song about the crucifixion, for instance), a point I will bring up again later.\n\nPiano Expression vs. Simplistic Chords\n\nThere is reason to expect more expressive and more dynamic piano accompaniment from current Hillsong’s music. There is a track record for proficient piano expression in the music of Hillsong’s past. The reality is that Hillsong’s current piano arrangements can be described as simplistic; oddly enough, some of my musican friends have confided in me that they rather not play Hillsong’s Oceans because ‘all I do is play 4 chords over and over again’ or ‘run three arpeggios till the leader signals the end of the song.’ Simplicity itself is not a singularly bad characteristic. Simplistic is not a bad quality when the song’s character and theme benefits from that quality (e.g. a soulful song about repentance); it starts to become a problem when the overall musical outcome degrades by it. After listening to dozen of albums from Hillsong, I still find the piano-playing in newer records so frustratingly stenciled in ink, with little room to grow or expand.\n\nSimple chords are important and have their essential place in music. Simple chord progressions have been with us since the era of pop, driving hit singles, and encouraging young people across the globe to pick up an instrument and play along with the CD. But if simple chord progressions begin to characterize the majority of tracks on an album, then that begins to weaken songs severely, as they become less interesting to listen to and less musically poignant. Similar to a painter deciding that shades of brown are the best colors for his artwork, ignoring the hundreds of colors available to his art. The decisions made about music impact our listening experience; in this case, our ability to enjoy a song about Gods’ love and connect in worship is made difficult when the song lacks important elements — for example, rich and colorful chords, unique varied tones, dynamic expression of the instrument, in this case the piano/keyboard.\n\nNevertheless, There are recent examples in Hillsong’s modern discography where I think they successfully execute a distinctive and creative modern piano sound on par with other music in the non-Christian space. For example, I really like the tone color of the keyboards in UNITED’s “All I Need is You”; it is a bright and mellow sound that rings sweetly with the vocals, gracefully announcing the introduction of the song. The chords here are spaced evenly, rich with color, a harmony that hovers gently, and intentional chord progressions that arrive with payoff — specially at the bridge (“You are the Universe/”) which is my favorite part of the song. As far as chords go, “All I Need is You” is well-structured in the key of C#m, which lends itself to a bright melody with introspective undertones. A lot of color is added by pairing the 7th to each chord: C#m7, Bm7 and so on. Here the chords are not necessarily complex as much as they rich in sound. This is another approach that avoids simplicity: adding the 7th or 9th to a chord to create a more colored and nuanced chord. Finally, this song succeeds because it has such interesting chord variation across the length of the song: The intro starts with the root chords. In Bridge #1 we play: iV, Vi, iii, Vii. But by Bridge #2 we are playing with the 6th chord and play: Vi, iii, Vii, iV.\n\nI will talk about “Oceans” which is indicative more of a synth problem- but yes, — the song does feature simplistic chords in very predictable time signatures. For a more intersting interpretation of “Oceans” add the 7th or 9th to each chord triad when playing the song. You might even get away with a 11th in one or two instances.\n\nEarly Acoustic Guitars in Hillsong’s Music\n\nFor Hillsong, acoustic guitars took a greater center stage around 2000's studio release For This Cause, which featured Reuben Morgan on lead rhythm guitar. However, the electric guitar would not make a lead debut until around the release of 2001’s You Are My World. In the first track “Your Love is Beautiful,” Nigel Hendroff’s sun-orange Les Paul delivers a rich groovy riff, one of my favorite moment’s of the album. One year later with 2002’s Blessed” Hendroff is still on electric guitar, joined by the up-and-comer Marty Sampson on rhythm guitar, and the continuation of Reuben Morgan on rhythm as well.\n\nOne of the benefits of electric guitar is that it can handily serve as a lead instrument and intone a song’s melody. For the purposes of recording live, one electric is more than enough. Around 2000, Hillsong adopted the strategy of multiple rhythm guitarists on the mix — I am not sure if this was a decision for a specific sound or if they wanted to open the opportunity for more musicians. In either case, some songs of this era suffer from the clash of serial guitars, muddying the mix, even after they were processed in post, and ultimately result in disharmony with the lead. This might be a technology restraint as well — since, for several albums, regular guitars were recorded with mics facing the sound hole and little less. Gradually, the sound capture of guitars has improved, both on recordings and studio releases.\n\nCurrent Implementations of Electric and Acoustic Guitar\n\nIn current Hillsong, guitars are sparsely heard in tracks; most of the time, electric guitars are used as accents on a bridge or intro — usually a short repeating arpeggio that satisfactorily introduces a new song section. And look, I fully understand that a 5-minute Gilmour-style solo would really sound out of place — but guitars need to take greater risks in Hillsong songs, if only to improve the listener’s enjoyment, allow the music to soar and take a less box-up shape. A particular offender can be found in Hillsong Worship’s discography, in which electric guitars, — when they do appear, — mutter a bashful lick, and never return to the mix. In contrast, UNITED appears to take more risks with guitars, and the music benefits: we see more electric guitar solos, and more guitar work in a song’s bridge and interlude. Electric guitars in these songs tend to open up the mix, providing a set of frequencies not found without them, provide a melody re-inforcement, and segmenting the structure of a song. While Hillsong Worship may be nervous to experiment with guitars, the positive musical outcome is hard to ignore.\n\nDrums and Percussion in Hillsong\n\nThe story of drums is a very interesting one in Hillsong. Keen-eyed viewers of Hillsong’s LIVE DVDs will note that many songs use two drummers. One of the drummers plays a set list of “praise & worship” whereas the other plays the slower songs. I suspect production designed two different drum kits and it made sense to split up roles into two different percussion styles with two different drummers. It might also be that the two drummers are stylistically different when approaching the instrument.\n\nDrums play an important role in Hillsong overall, but they deserve special commendation with UNITED’s music. In “Hosanna”, first performed by Hillsong UNITED, the drums enter the mix, when the listener least expects it(a nice byproduct of pronounced offbeats), creating a unique listening experience. In “What the World Will Never Take”, a 2005 track by UNITED, the drums play a key role building momentum and energy. Moving towards current Hillsong Worship, we see more subdued drumming, that is well-suited to the slower-paced material. The first few moments of “The Passion” utilizes soft percussive elements that morph very pleasantly into full-out drums complemented by a thumping bass. Among Hillsong Worship’s tracks, this is probably my favorite song in their recent catalog.\n\nCurrent Trends with Drums\n\nThe drums in Hillsong’s songs have grown increasingly more simplistic and rudimentary, reminiscent of garage rock and indie rock. This may be a stylistic choice; I personally don’t enjoy this trend on the similar argument I have against simplifying piano/keyboards. Personally, I really like the more bombastic drum intros in earlier Hillsong tracks: one in particular is the opening bars in “For All You’ve Done”. But I understand that more simplistic drumming serves to spotlight the vocals and amplify the space in which the other instruments operate. A good example of this at work is “Who You Say I Am” — a track that I do not particularly like, however I do appreciate how the drums nicely enhance this song’s marching-to-war aesthetic. Something to note: Modern Hillsong songs frequently lack use of cymbals, preferring a thumpier drumming that attempts to stay in the background. Here, I again think, current Hillsong Worship would benefit from greater drum dynamics and expression; I understand that the current sound design allows easier church-singing with the instruments rolled in the background — but I think the tradeoff is particularly brutal on the drums. If drums are too relegated, the music loses its rhythm and groove — which is in fact a huge chunk of music. Let’s end on a positive note: a noteworthy moment for drums is in the song UNITED’s “All I Need You”, which I think has shows strong technical drumming with great feel and expression.\n\nAmbiance and Synthesizers\n\nThere is no denying the ‘magical’, ethereal touch a good synthesizer can bring to a mix. Like many modern bands performing live, Hillsong uses synth pads, digital audio workstations, and stage pianos to reproduce a variety of sounds and ambiances. Upon listening to songs with synths, I have found that the Hillsong synths struggle to find an identity. Specially at fault are some of the ambiance in UNITED albums — which markedly trend toward the generic. Overall, this results in an track which feel ‘atmospheric’ as a cheap gimmick. One of the core role when using synthesizers is to enhance a song’s mood, introduce a verse, or bring new tonal quality to a song. Synths are not merely a substitute for sound, or just background noise; no, in fact, they occupy a very unique role in a song.\n\nThere are several examples of greath synth execution in pop-culture (e.g. Daft Punk Tron Soundtrack, Daft Punk’s R.A.M., The Weekend’s Blinding Lights) and movie soundtrack (e.g. Hans Zimmer’s recent compositions.) It seems however that Hillsong uses synthesizers for every moody/ambient song without assessing how — or even if — the synthesizer should be utilized in that particular section of a track.\n\nCase in point, Hillsong UNITED”S “Oceans.” First the good: this song should be applauded for its lush production and modern sound. But it simply does not hold well as a song in its own right. As a intermission within an album listen, it works alright. But because it lacks so much of the melodic and instrumental character that helps our brain perceive a song as a ‘song’, Oceans would work better as a prelude, or a longer-style anthem. Some of my musician friends perceive this track as slow and uneventful, indulging in slowness for its own sake, — and I have to agree with them. From an ambiance perspective, the synth’s tone is not particularly interesting in my opinion, and further weakens a song’s structure that already lacked much structure.\n\nIn summary, more judicious and intentional use of synth sounds and ambiance would go along way, music-wise. To close, I do applaud Hillsong for even bothering to implement synths on both live and studio records. Because many of Hillsong songs are slow worship ballads and the instrumentation is generally subdued in many tracks — synths end up occupying a large amount of an album’s runtime. This leads us to our next point.\n\nMelody and Song Construction\n\nThe current breed of music we often see on the radio and popular culture often lacks a pronounced melody. Is that a necessarily bad thing? It might be hard to argue that a lack of melody dooms a song, but I would argue it severely limits its impact. Music is a language. And while, a song with no melody is perfectly allowable — you lose communicative power when you remove melody.\n\nSo first, the good. Many of Hillsong recent efforts represent memorable songs incorporating strong and vivid melodies. I like for example Hillsong Young & Free free-flowing track “This is Living”, since the different sections transition well together. The melody in “Savior King” feels poignant and cutting; it is comprised of ascending vocal dynamics that mirror an ascending chord progression. This marriage works really well — the song builds intensity around a jumping melody.\n\nThere are some recent Hillsong tracks where melodies have been less than good. This is the case in 2019’s “King of Kings.” Barring one creative vocalization at 1:10, the refrain’s melody line is near identical to the verse and results in a song that is not particularly memorable. It basically sounds more of the same, which in turn was more of the same — umm- if that makes sense. I do applaud the creative lullaby-style melody with its hymn-like softness; I like the general musical ideas represented here but the execution could use improvement. Also in Hillsong Worship’s “Who You Say I Am” — the anthem-style song I mentioned earlier, does not have a very interesting or resonating melody. I would describe it as a happy sauntering tune, with a triumphant bridge — but even with the bridge, nothing really jumps out when you listen to it.\n\nSong Pacing and Song Structure\n\nThe way songs are constructed — to our ears anyway — matters. For instance, repetition can be a wonderful technique to highlight and resonate a point. But sometimes repetition is bad, especially when it detracts from the listening and singing experience. The hallmarks of poor construction are repetitive verses and repetitive refrains, resulting in a song structure that seems to stand still. For instance, the title track “God is Able”, I think, is increasingly repetitive, bound by a static time signature and uneventful chorus. More practically, it has been my experience that people get tired when singing this song in church; of course, your mileage might vary. In my listening experience a track like this meanders about the same melody and could be really improved if the instrumentation was more expressive, if there was more variety in the melody, or if the song structure was changed (e.g. a bridge was introduced, verses were developed more fully).\n\n“What a Beautiful Name ” and “So Will I.” both suffer from strange pacing issues. These songs are very popular, and more or less I can understand why people like to sing them at church or in the car. Both of these tracks are written in DMajor — and after their very slow starts, — do arrive at a good melody that serves each respective song well enough. Stylistically, “What A Beautiful Name” is less of a song and more of a meditative anthem or worship ballad; but coupled with the drawn-out vocalizations by singer Brooke Ligertwood, singing along to this song results in a unfulfilling chore with little actual lyrics to sing. Maybe its a preference thing, but I think more lyrics to sing and more expressive vocals and tonal variety would benefit this song. As far as instruments, there is really not too much going on: drums stay far back into the mix, pianos interject ever so frequently, and even the live audience can sometimes not be heard well. “Who You Say I am” also exhibits a strange song structure, particularly laborious repetitions of the refrain and bridge. In fact, the bridge is repeated so often that it takes on a function as a second refrain. Frankly, I think the song would benefit from more lyrics to sing, — either adding different verses or a different variant to the refrain. Also, I personally did not like the instrumentation here, specially the guitar which sounds whiny and threadbare, but that may be just me.\n\nMoving on, “So Will I”, is a worship ballad, with a slow and contemplative 60 beats per minute. I have nothing against the tempo, but because the song is already quite slow, it needs instruments that can bring color and variety; it also needs a song-structure that is interesting and varied. The refrain of “So Will I” is well-crafted and dare I say poignant, — credit to Joel Houston and crew, — representing my favorite moment of the track. The song’s development really suffers from the bridge — a descending Bm to G progression that loops for several seconds. The overall pacing is really off too: having entered the triumphant moment in the refrain, the song inexplicably lumbers back for a second time to the interminable bridge, almost as if the song is unsure how it should end. The ideas in this song are creative, specially Houston’s vocals on the refrain and some decent harmony on the refrain. It should however pace itself with more finesse and avoid this unnecessary repetition.\n\nHarmony\n\nThis ties a bit into another point: harmony. Effective use of harmony is extremely powerful — and at the risk of music lecturing, Hillsong needs better harmony in their songs. If all the instruments are singing similar or identical lines, then music loses its whole purpose. Instruments — bagpipes and electric guitar alike — have a unique voice, with a unique tonal quality and timbre ( e.g. dark, brassy, reedy). Part of the aim of musical composition is to arrange each musical instrument to sing a specific part: a flute on the lead, guitars on rhythm and maybe a bass guitar dancing on the groove. Each performing different but complimentary sound to the other one. Practically, I would like Hillsong to lean more heavily on harmony in its piano arrangements and maybe on vocals too (a layering of backgrounds or a second-voice could be a great addition).\n\nTempo\n\nAnother topic to address is tempo and its interplay with lyrical singing. The frequent slow time signature of a song and the way sung lyrics are broken in open-mouth vowels can hamper the free flow of a melody. Melody is meant to sing at you the listener. When we hear it, melodies are always active: whether climbing with joy, plummeting with sadness, or solemnly brooding. When the lyrics of a song are so segmented and hyphenated( e.g: A th-ou-sand waaays), songs begin to lose melody. You can see what I mean in a song like 2015’s “O Praise the Name.”"
