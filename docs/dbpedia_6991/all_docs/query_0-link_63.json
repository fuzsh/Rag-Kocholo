        "text": "On Wednesday night, Israelis received our first taste of the new Middle East with the missile strikes on Beersheba. Iran's Palestinian proxy, the local branch of the Muslim Brotherhood known as Hamas, carried out its latest war crime right after Iran's battleships entered Syria's Latakia port.\n\nTheir voyage through the Suez Canal to Syria was an unadulterated triumph for the mullahs.\n\nFor the first time since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran's warships sailed across the canal without even being inspected by the Egyptian, US or Israeli navies.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, the Iranian-dominated new Middle East has had a pronounced impact on the Western-backed Fatah-led Palestinian Authority's political posture towards the US. The PA picked a fight with America just after the Obama administration forced Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to surrender power. Mubarak's departure was a strategic victory for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and for its sister branch Hamas in Gaza.\n\nAs part of his efforts to neutralize the threat the Muslim Brotherhood posed to his regime, Mubarak sealed off Gaza's border with Egypt after Hamas seized power there in June 2007.\n\nThe Gaza-Sinai border was breached during last month's revolution. Since Mubarak's forced resignation, the military junta now leading Egypt has failed to reseal it.\n\nThe revolution in Egypt happened just after the PA was thrown into a state of disarray. Al-Jazeera's exposure of PA documents indicating the leadership's willingness to make minor compromises with Israel in the framework of a peace deal served to discredit Fatah leaders in the eyes of the Israel-hating Palestinian public. In the wake of the Al-Jazeera revelations, senior PA leaders escalated their anti-Israel and anti-American pronouncements. The PA's chief negotiator Saeb Erekat was forced to resign.\n\nThe shift in the regional power balance following Mubarak's fall has caused Fatah leaders to view their ties to the US as a strategic liability. If they wish to survive, they must cut a deal with Hamas. And to convince Hamas to cut a deal, they need to abandon the US.\n\nAnd so they have. Fatah's first significant move to part company with Washington came with its relentless bid to force a vote on a resolution condemning Israeli construction in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria at the UN Security Council. In an attempt to avert a vote on the resolution that the US public expected him to veto, Obama spent 50 minutes on the phone with Mahmoud Abbas begging him to set the resolution aside. Obama promised to take unprecedented steps against Israel in return for Abbas's agreement to stand down. But Abbas rejected his appeal. Not only did Abbas defy the wishes of the most pro-Palestinian president ever to occupy the White House, Abbas told the whole world about how he defied Obama.\n\nAbbas's humiliation of Obama was only the first volley in the Fatah leader's campaign against the US. Abbas, Salam Fayyad and their PA ministers have sent paid demonstrators into the street to protest against America. They announced a boycott of American diplomats and journalists. They have called for a boycott of American products. They have scheduled a \"Day of Rage\" against America for Friday after mosque prayers.\n\nWhile excoriating Obama and the US, the PA is actively wooing Hamas. On Wednesday, the PA accepted the legitimacy of Hamas control over Gaza. Three-and-a-half years after Hamas wrested control over Gaza from Fatah in a bloody coup, on Wednesday Fayyad said that the PA is willing to end its objection to Hamas control over the area if Hamas agrees to participate in the general elections Abbas has scheduled for September.\n\nAt the same time as he publicly beseeched Hamas to join forces with Fatah, Fayyad announced that the PA is willing to forgo US financial assistance if that assistance continues to come with political strings attached. The only real string attached to US aid is the stipulation that no US financial assistance can be used to finance Hamas.\n\nTHE PA'S announced willingness to end its receipt of US aid is by far its boldest move to date. With the Arab world going up in smoke, Fatah officials know they cannot expect to receive any significant funding from Arab states for the foreseeable future. That makes them entirely dependent on US and Europe. And make no mistake, the PA budget is entirely a creation of foreign aid. The PA is the largest foreign aid recipient in the world. Last year, it received $1.8 billion in foreign assistance.\n\nUS direct assistance accounted for $550 million, or nearly a third of that amount. The US gave the PA another $268m. in indirect assistance through UNRWA. UNRWA is the UN agency devoted exclusively to providing welfare benefits to the Palestinians while subordinating itself to the Palestinian political agenda. Without US assistance, the PA would cease to be a political factor in the region. So by offering to forgo the aid, Fayyad, Abbas and their colleagues are essentially threatening to commit political suicide.\n\nThe Palestinians' declared readiness to forgo US aid is all the more remarkable when compared to Israel's refusal to countenance the thought of forgoing or even cutting back the assistance it receives from the US. Whereas the Palestinian economy will collapse without US assistance, were Israel to forgo the $3b. in military assistance it receives every year from Washington, the move would have little impact on the economy.\n\nEconomic analyses of US military assistance have noted that several factors degrade the value of the aid. The US requires Israel to spend 75 percent of the assistance in the US. Israel's inability to open its purchases to competitive bidding in the world market has forced it to pay inflated prices for much of what it buys. So, too, by buying US weapons systems, Israel has harmed its own military industries, which are blocked from selling or developing systems for the IDF contractors.\n\nMoreover, because the US has tied its aid to Egypt to its aid to Israel and justified its military aid to Jordan and Lebanon through its military assistance to Israel, by accepting the aid, Israel is enabling its neighbors to upgrade their military capabilities. Their upgraded military capabilities in turn force Israel to invest still more resources in its defense budget to maintain its qualitative edge against its US subsidized neighbors.\n\nWith all the hidden costs the military assistance entails, it is reasonable to discount the actual value of the aid by 50%. That is, the actual value of annual US military assistance is about $1.5b.\n\nThe direct military cost of the Second Lebanon War is estimated at $2.2b. The direct military cost of Operation Cast Lead is estimated at $1.4b. The actual costs of both wars to the Israeli economy were several times higher.\n\nThose who claim that Israel cannot manage without US military aid ignore the fact that neither of these wars had any discernible impact on the economy.\n\nThe political cost Israel has paid for US military assistance has been astronomical. As a recent study of US military assistance by the Jerusalem Institute for Market Studies demonstrated, the psychological impact of the US aid on Israeli and American leaders alike has had a disastrous impact on the relations between the two states and impaired their ability to understand the actual strategic rationale of their alliance. Israeli leaders have developed a subservient mentality towards the Americans and the Americans have forgotten that a strong Israel is the US's most valuable strategic asset in the region.\n\nTHE PALESTINIANS' expressed willingness to forgo their assistance from the US is no doubt a bluff. And Congress would do well to call their bluff and cancel US assistance to the PA.\n\nYet their behavior presents Israel with an important lesson about the fundamentals of diplomacy that appear lost on our leaders.\n\nThe Palestinians understand the rules of diplomacy far better than Israel does. Israel believes that diplomacy is about getting other governments to be nice to us. Palestinians understand that diplomacy is a nonviolent means of weakening your enemies and expanding your own power. They also understand that the starting point for any effective diplomatic strategy is a reality-based assessment of other government's interests.\n\nAs the revolutions throughout the region show, in the real world, the Arabs do not care about the Palestinians. Europeans and leftist Americans care about the Palestinians. European leaders need to support the Palestinians for domestic political reasons. US leaders support the Palestinians to maintain good relations with Europe and with the American Left.\n\nRecognizing this, the likes of Abbas and Fayyad understand that no matter what they say or do, the West will probably not abandon them. Europeans need them to continue carrying out their political war against Israel because that is what their constituents demand. US leaders will continue to support them because they follow Europe's lead.\n\nOn the other hand, given their newfound power, PA leaders have to bend over backwards to appease Hamas and Iran if they wish to survive.\n\nSince they rightly assess that the West needs them more than they need the West, not only are the Palestinians unwilling to pay any price for maintaining Western support for them. They are willing to initiate ugly confrontations with the US and humiliate Obama in order to win the approval of Hamas and Iran.\n\nFacing this reality, Israel's best bet is to initiate a few confrontations of its own to demonstrate its strategic importance to the US and Europe. With the conflagrations raging in the Arab world essentially making its argument that a strong Israel is imperative for the West, Israel should be going on the offensive against the Palestinians and the international Left that supports them.\n\nBut instead of pointing out the truth, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his colleagues maintain their posture as supplicants to Washington, making concession after concession in exchange for further abuse in the hopes of avoiding a confrontation.\n\nFor instance, Netanyahu has defied his own party and broken his word to the public by maintaining an undeclared freeze on Jewish building in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria. Since January 2010, Netanyahu has systematically denied Jews building permits in the area in the hopes of appeasing Obama.\n\nAnd how has Obama repaid Israel for our government's willingness to deny Jews their civil rights? The Obama administration has branded all Jewish communities in post-1967 Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria as \"illegitimate,\" and blamed Israel for the absence of peace in the region.\n\nAs our region is consumed by the flames of rebellion and revolution, the challenges and threats Israel faces multiply by the day. In these new and trying times, our leaders must shed their failed concepts of statecraft based on weakness and adopt new ones founded on strength. The PA is playing a bad hand wisely. We are playing a good hand foolishly.\n\nUCI  The Unity Coalition for Israel (http://www.israelunitycoalition.org)  is \"the largest worldwide coalition of Jewish and Christian organizations, with more than 200 groups representing millions of people dedicated to Israel. Though we have many different backgrounds, we have one common goal: A Safe and Secure Israel.\"\n\n\"Israel is not just a Jewish issue. Millions of Christians resolutely endorse the principle of peace with security for the state of Israel. Because we work closely together and speak with a united voice, our message is being heard!\"\n\nTo Go To Top Many believe that the Obama administration are just screw-ups. If only that were the case\n\nIn the midst of the political turmoil engulfing Egypt and much of the Arab world, last month's revelation that Pakistan has doubled the size of its nuclear arsenal over the past four years has been largely ignored. Nuclear proliferation analysts from the Federation of American Scientists and the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) assess that since 2006 Pakistan has increased the size of its nuclear arsenal from 30-60 atomic bombs to approximately 110. That makes Pakistan the world's fifth largest nuclear power ahead of Britain and France.\n\nAs for delivery systems, according to the Washington Post, Pakistan has developed nuclear-capable land and air-launched cruise missiles. Its Shaheen II missile, with a range of 1,500 miles is about to go into operational deployment.\n\nWednesday Pakistan test-fired its Hatf-VII new nuclear-capable cruise missile with a 600 kilometer range.\n\nThe Obama administration has been silent on Pakistan's nuclear proliferation activities. As ISIS President David Albright said to the Washington Post, \"The administration is always trying to keep people from talking about this knowledgeably. They're always trying to downplay the numbers [of Pakistan's nuclear warheads] and insisting that 'it's smaller than you think.'\"\n\nPakistan's nuclear growth goes on as its economy is in shambles, its government is falling apart and a large portion of the country's territory is controlled by the Taliban. Pakistan is the largest recipient of US foreign aid. In 2009 Congress approved a five-year $7.5 billion civilian aid package. Last October the Obama administration proposed supplementing the aid with $2 billion for Pakistan's military.\n\nThe administration requested the supplemental aid despite criticism that economic assistance to Pakistan indirectly funds its nuclear project since Pakistan is in an effective state of bankruptcy. Moreover, a US Inspector General report published this week concluded that the $7.5 billion in assistance has achieved little.\n\nFor their part, the Pakistani government and military adhere to a radically anti-American line and Pakistan's powerful ISI intelligence service and large sections of its military continue to maintain intimate ties with al Qaida and the Taliban.\n\nLast month Pakistani police arrested US diplomat Raymond Davis in Lahore after he killed two gunmen who were reportedly about to rob him at gunpoint. Pakistani law enforcement officials have charged Davis with murder and refuse to release him to US custody despite the fact that he should enjoy the protection of diplomatic immunity.\n\nRather than attempt to quiet passions, the Pakistani government is fanning anti-American sentiments by among other things, releasing a videotape of Davis's police interrogation.\n\nTo date, while members of Congress are beginning to threaten to curtail aid to Pakistan pending Davis's release, the administration has limited its response to this de facto act of hostage taking by Pakistan to refusing to hold high-level exchanges with Pakistani leaders. And even this limited response has been inconsistently implemented.\n\nFor instance, while US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to meet with her Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi at the Munich security conference last weekend, she did agree to meet with Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, the commander of the Pakistani military. So too, the US ambassador in Pakistan met on Monday with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari.\n\nPakistan is a textbook example of a disaster of biblical proportions in the making. Its hyperactive nuclear expansion, weak central government, impoverished, radicalized population, and pro-Islamist military and intelligence arms are sources for major concern. That concern becomes all-out alarm in light of the Taliban/al Qaida's control over anywhere from a quarter to a third of Pakistani territory and the widespread public support for them throughout the country.\n\nSince taking office, the Obama administration has failed to conceive of a strategy for contending with the situation. One of the main obstacles to the formation of a coherent US strategy is the Obama administration's move to outlaw any discussion of the basic threats to US interests. Shortly after entering office, President Barack Obama banned the use of the term \"War against terror,\" substituting it with the opaque term \"overseas contingency operation.\"\n\nLast April Obama banned use of the terms \"jihad,\" \"Islamic terrorism,\" and \"radical Islam,\" in US government documents.\n\nGiven that US officials are barred from using all the terms that are relevant for describing reality in places like Pakistan, it is obvious why the US cannot put together a strategy for contending with the challenges it faces there. Imagine an intelligence officer in Peshawar trying to report on what he sees. Imagine a defense attaché in Lahore trying to explain the problems with the jihad-infested Pakistani military to his superiors in Washington.\n\nImagine a USAID officer trying to explain why the jihadist-mosque attending public refuses to work at US-funded highway programs.\n\nThe Obama administration's decision to ban relevant language from the official US policy discourse was ideologically motivated. And in choosing ideology over reality, the Obama administration has induced a situation where rather than construct policies to deal with reality, at all levels, US officials have been charged with constructing policies to deny and ignore reality.\n\nAgainst this backdrop it becomes fairly clear why the Obama administration's handling of the political turmoil in Egypt has been so incompetent. Upon entering office, Obama made a determined effort to ignore the political instability percolating under the surface throughout the authoritarian Arab world. US government officials were instructed to curtail programs aimed at developing liberal alternatives to authoritarianism and the Muslim Brotherhood. The justification for this behavior was again ideological.\n\nAs the world's biggest bully, the US had no moral right to judge the behavior of tyrants like Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.\n\nOnce the dutifully ignored long repressed popular discontent boiled over into the popular revolts we have seen over the past month in Tunisia and Egypt as well as Yemen, Jordan, Algeria and beyond, the Obama administration rushed to get on the \"right side\" of the issue. To avoid criticism for refusing to contend with the problems bred by Arab authoritarianism, Obama went to the other extreme. He became the most outspoken champion of unfettered popular democracy in Egypt.\n\nOf course, to occupy this other side of the spectrum, Obama has had to ignore the danger constituted by the most powerful opposition movement in Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood's hostility towards the US's most fundamental strategic interests in the Middle East has been swept under the rug by the Obama administration and its supporters in the US media.\n\nBut then, in light of the prohibition of all discussion of the reasons the Muslim Brotherhood constitutes a threat to the US  its jihadist ideology of Islamic conquest, its genocidal Islamic-based Jew hatred and hatred of America, its support for Islamic terrorism against non-jihadist regimes throughout the Muslim world and against the West  it is not surprising that the Obama administration is embracing the inclusion of the movement in a post-Mubarak Egyptian regime.\n\nHow could the administration object to something it has chosen to ignore?\n\nThe Obama administration's ideologically-driven strategic ineptitude is evident everywhere. From its slavish devotion to appeasing Iran, its single-minded insistence on withdrawing from Iraq, its announced commitment to withdrawing from Afghanistan; to its tolerance of Hugo Chavez, and its infantile reset button diplomacy towards Russia, the Obama administration's foreign policy is on a collision course with reality.\n\nBut nowhere is its premeditated incompetence more evident than in its obsession with the establishment of a Palestinian state west of the Jordan River.\n\nSo it was that during his visit in Israel this week, Obama's recently retired national security advisor Gen. James Jones claimed that it is G0d's will that Israel withdraw to indefensible borders and effectively blamed the political turmoil in Egypt on the absence of a Palestinian state.\n\nAs Jones put it, \"I'm of the belief that had G0d appeared in front of President Obama in 2009 and said if he could do one thing on the face of the planet, and one thing only, to make the world a better place and give people more hope and opportunity for the future, I would venture that it would have something to do with finding the two-state solution to the Middle East.\"\n\nJones then argued, \"Time is not on our side, and a failure to act [in establishing a Palestinian state] may trigger other Egypt-like demonstrations in other countries in the region.\"\n\nThe Obama administration is not alone in this completely irrational view. As the Arab world undergoes massive convulsions born of the legacy of authoritarianism and nourished by the pull of jihadism, all of Europe's major statesmen are lining up behind Washington in pushing Israel to agree to surrender still more land to the PLO in order to establish yet another authoritarian, jihad-infested Arab state.\n\nNATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, British Foreign Minister William Hague, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and other senior officials all parroted Jones's view this week.\n\nConfronting the Obama administration's assault on reason in the interest of ideological faithfulness, Israel is faced with very few good options. The threats Israel faces stem largely from the rising forces of jihad, Islamic terrorism and religiously justified nuclear adventurism embraced by Islamist politicians and religious leaders. That is, the threats facing Israel stem largely from the forces the Obama administration has elected to ignore and deny.\n\nMoreover, the Obama administration's singular obsession with coercing Israel to surrender still more land to the Palestinian Authority means that America's central Middle East policy involves demanding that Israel further strengthen the unmentionable forces of jihad at its own expense. This fact was underlined this week with the Jerusalem Post's Khaled Abu Toameh's revelation that most senior PA leaders have recently applied for Jordanian citizenship. Clearly the likes of Mahmoud Abbas believe they will not be the winners if their repressive regime in Judea and Samaria is seriously challenged by their popular jihadist rivals in Hamas.\n\nOur leaders are doubtlessly tempted to simply take the path of least resistance and join Obama and his merry band of blind men as they move from lie to lie to defend their ideology from reality. But doing so will not protect us when the dangers sown by the US's strategic dementia provoke the next conflagration.\n\nIsrael's best option is to simply tell the truth as loudly and forcefully as it can and base our policies on it. While doing so will win Israel no friends in the Obama administration or in Europe, it will prepare us for the day when the wall of lies they are building from Islamabad to Cairo to Ramallah come crashing down.\n\nContact Laura by email at lel817@yahoo.com\n\nTo Go To Top Rev. Majed El Shafie: Opposes the West backing El-Baradei to replace Mubarak as Muslim Brotherhood will Come to Power on His Coat-Tails\n\nThere aren't too many people who, after being tortured and condemned to death in Egypt, have managed to escape to Israel by driving a jet-ski from Taba in the Sinai to Eilat. But Rev. Majed El Shafie, who has since obtained political asylum in Canada and now lives in Toronto did just that.\n\nRev. El-Shafie, who is the President and founder of One Free World International, El. Shafie Ministries (OFWI),is following the current upheaval in Egypt very closely. His organization, which monitors violations in Egypt and other Arab states against the Christian minority, has people in Egypt who are updating him on the situation on the ground.\n\nAccording to El Shafie who was interviewed on February 3 by the Winnipeg Jewish Review \"The Muslim Brotherhood has used the demonstrations in Egypt to advance its agenda.They are going street to street, door to door asking people to go out to demonstrate...They want a hand in the new government. They are being more aggressive, more active, are coming out in full power...\"\n\nEl Shafie, 34, was born a Muslim in Cairo to a distinguished Muslim family of lawyers and judges. He was exposed at an early age to hatred toward the Christian minority in Egypt through a Christian friend. He decided to convert to Christianity, wrote a book about it and as a result became an outcast and a victim of oppression.\n\nHe began a mission to bring the Christian community in Egypt all of the same legal rights as the Moslem community in Egypt. After beginning a ministry which built two churches, a bible school and medical clinic, he established a newspaper to request from the Egyptian government equal rights for the Christian community. The Egyptian government did not tolerate this and El Shafie was arrested in 1998 and taken to the torture section of the Abu Zaabel prison in Cairo.\n\n\"I was jailed at Abo Zaabl jail and tortured for seven days and then put under house arrest for three months...After receiving the death penalty, I escaped from house arrest and hid with a Beduin family for two months in Sinai. Then I went to the Hilton hotel in Taba, [near the border with Israel] and I stole a jet-ski and landed in front of the Princess Hotel in Eilat in Israel...It was about a three minute ride on the jet-ski.\" he said.\n\nBut when he got to Eilat, Rev. El-Shafie was imprisoned again, this time by Israeli authorities because the Israeli government did not know what to do in his circumstance. Legally he could not stay in Israel, but if they sent him back to Egypt, he would be executed.\n\n\"I was in Israeli prison in Israel because under the peace treaty with Egypt, they couldn't take me in,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked how long he was in Israeli prison he answered, \"one year, three months, 15 days, 12 hours and 24 minutes.When you are in prison you count every minute.\"\n\nRev. El Shafie was eventually released through the assistance of the UN, Amnesty International and the International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem, which managed to obtain political asylum for him in Canada, where he emigrated and became a citizen in 2006. El Shafie, who founded OFWI in 2004, said he believes that Mubarak should leave now but he cautioned that the United States should NOT support Mohamed El-Baradei's attempt to become the leader to replace Mubarak as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt will \"ride to power on his coat tails.\"\n\nHe said \"I am concerned that under current circumstances Mubarak's abrupt departure will create a political vacuum which will be filled by Islamic extremists. The West appears to be embracing Mohamed El Baradei, a former head of the UN nuclear inspection agency, as a replacement for Mubarak. This is of serious concern as El Baradei, in addition to betraying heavy anti-Israel sentiment through his actions at the UN agency, is reportedly communicating with the Muslim Brotherhood, a banned Islamic extremist movement, in order to actively involve the Brotherhood in the future political landscape of Egypt.\"\n\nRev. El Shafie noted that Time Magazine quotes El Baradei as saying \"The Muslim Brotherhood has nothing to do with the Iranian movement, has nothing to do with extremism as we have seen it in Afghanistan and other places.\" According to Time, El Baradei intends to include the Muslim Brotherhood, \"an integral part of Egyptian society,\" in the political process and has called the Brotherhood \"a conservative group that favors secular democracy and human rights\" [emphasis added]. El Baradei also told Fareed Zakaria the following: \"I have been reaching out to them (the Moslem Brotherhood) We need to include them.\" Many Western news outlets have adopted the claim that the Muslim Brotherhood is a conservative, non-violent movement.\n\nRev. El Shafie counters:\n\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth. While it officially renounces violence, the Muslim Brotherhood is the ideological parent of terrorist movements such as Hamas and Al-Qaida. Members and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood are behind daily forced conversion attempts, violent attacks, and torture against Egyptian Christians. The Brotherhood cooperates with Hamas in Gaza and leaders are determined to launch war against Israel. This is a very serious matter and we cannot, under any circumstances, allow the Muslim Brotherhood to increase its influence in Egypt. To do so would be to condemn the Egyptian people, from Christians and other religious minorities to moderate and secular Muslims, to a regime of oppression and religious tyranny that will make Mubarak's repressive regime seem like a beacon of freedom.\"\n\nHe believes that if the Muslim Brotherhood rose to power they \"will say at the outset that they respect the treaty with Israel, but then shortly afterwards they will say they want to reform the agreement.\"\n\nThey will not keep the peace with Israel. [Note: A spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood said it won't commit to maintaining a peace treaty with Israel or even recognition of Israel on CNN television\n\n(http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/ Article.aspx?id=206725.) Also, Rashad al-Bayoumi, a deputy leader of the Brotherhood said on Japan's NHTV \"After President Mubarak steps down and a provisional government is formed, there is a need to dissolve the peace treaty with Israel.\"\n\n(http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/ 2011/feb/3/muslim-brotherhood-seeks-end- to-israel-treaty/) ]\n\nRev. El-Shafie is of the view that \"Even if Mubarak were to leave today, Obama still needs to work with Omar Suleiman, the new Vice-President [appointed by Mubarak] as democracy can't occur tomorrow. The regime needs to be supported until Suleiman can reform the constitution and educate the people, and allow freedom of the media, freedom of speech and work towards a free election.\"\n\nWhen asked how long he felt would be needed before a free election should take place in Egypt, El Shafie answered \"Five years from now there should be an election...Democracy in Egypt is an infant-it needs to learn to crawl before it can learn to walk.\"\n\nFive years is much longer than US senators have called for. The U.S. Senate has called for Mubarak to immediately begin a peaceful transition to an interim government supported by the military and to enact reforms needed to hold free and fair elections this year.\n\n(http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/ u-s-in-talks-with-egypt-about-immediate- mubarak-resignation-1.341193)\n\nRev. El-Shafie has family in Egypt but \"is not-in communication with them since they disowned me after I converted to Christianity.\" He emphasized that \"The people of Egypt have been living 'in darkness' under a dictatorship for 30 years-You can't expect them to adjust to light right away.\n\n\"Thirty percent of the population is illiterate-they can't read and write their own name-you can't give them absolute democracy in the beginning because it's easy for them to turn to extremism. The United States [and other countries] should support the new VP Omar Suleiman. We need slow change.\n\n\"Democracy as we know it in the West cannot simply be transplanted into Egypt, a country that has never experienced any form of true democracy. Democracy cannot survive where people cannot read their own constitution. It must be taught, nurtured, and brought to maturity so that it can flourish.\"\n\nRev. El Shafie explained that the Muslim Brotherhood is popular with the poor illiterate people of Egypt \"because they provide the basic food and necessities to them...The Muslim Brotherhood is very wealthy. They own supermarkets in Egypt and they get funds from countries such as Iran and Saudia Arabia.\"\n\nIf there were elections now, Rev. El Shafie says that the Muslim Brotherhood would win because they are \"the most organized group.\"\n\nRev. El-Shafie is concerned that if democracy is brought to Egypt too quickly, \"we will see the same scenario that we saw in Gaza and the West Bank in 2006, where Hamas won the elections,\" or we risk \"repeating the Iranian scenario where pro-democracy forces deposed the shah in 1979 but were quickly overcome by the radical Islamic ayatollahs.\"\n\nHe noted, \"When Egypt had elections in 2005, even though they were rigged the Moslem brotherhood won 88 out of 454 seats in the Egyptian parliament. The Moslem Brotherhood really got more than 88 seats but once they got 88 seats the regime shut down the elections completely.\"\n\nRegarding Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, Rev. El-Shafie said that the peace was not one that was really between people.\n\n\"It was a cold peace that the Egyptians entered into to get money from the Americans,\" he said.\n\n\"There is no love lost between Egypt and Israel,\" he added. He said Mubarak's regime was supporting Hamas under the table through enabling smuggling of weapons from Sinai into Gaza.\n\nThere are reasons for Israel to be concerned about developments in Egypt. \"There is now a whole well equipped army in Egypt [due to American support Egypt received after entering into the peace agreement with Israel]. It is a built up modernized army that that could in the future \"be at war with Israel.\"\n\nRev. El Shafie said that unlike Egypt, the Arab Gulf States are stable, even though there is no democracy there \"because the people are wealthy.\" He said that \"Saudi Arabia has a higher standard of living than Egypt.\" In Egypt, due to Mubarak's corrupt regime, Rev. El-Shafie says that \"the rich have gotten richer and the poor have gotten poorer and the middle-class is disappearing. The average Egyptian salary is under $2.00 a day.\"\n\n[Editor's note: Although Rev. El-Shafie said the US ought to work with Omar Suleiman, a day after he was interviewed it was reported that Suleiman was also inviting the Moslem brotherhood into a national dialogue, something that would have been unthinkable before protests erupted on Jan. 25, indicating the giant strides made by the Moslem Brotherhood.\n\n(http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/ u-s-in-talks-with-egypt-about-immediate-mubarak- resignation-1.341193,\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-yn/content/ article/2011/02/03/AR2011020305073.html.\n\nRev.

It is a lie built on a foundation of mendacity. And, with it now having been sanctified in the President's Cairo Speech in Egypt, it can be termed The Grand Pyramid Scheme.\n\nBack in President Barack Obama's America, the laws on the books clearly prohibit people from telling African Americans that, \"sorry, you can't live in this neighborhood.\" Does anyone doubt that Justice Sotomayor would uphold those laws?\n\nThe Bigotry of Banning Jews from Living in a Region\n\nImagine how many American communities over the years could have resolved their racial issues simply by agreeing that Blacks need to be removed completely from \"White neighborhoods,\" and Whites removed from \"Black neighborhoods.\" Maybe James von Brunn would not have gone on a shooting rampage at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum if there were a compromise agreement that Jews may not establish residential communities in or near Washington, D.C. Separate but equal. Quite a concept!\n\nOnly, that's a racist concept. Part of America's greatness is that we evolved as a society over two centuries to reject that concept. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Educ. of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686 (1954), overruling Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537; 16 S. Ct. 1138 (1896). Similarly, we are appalled by the bigotry in the Middle Ages and into the 1940s marked by governments segregating Jews from communities in Germany, Poland, Austria, or Hungary  say, to relocate them into their own ghettoes. And it is equally bigoted today to advocate a public policy that forcibly would segregate Jews from communities in Judea and Samaria (the \"West Bank\") or anywhere else in Israel. But that bigotry  what else can it rightly be called?  ironically defines the Obama Administration's Mideast program, now being pushed hard by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and being sold to American Jews in private meetings with the President's Jewish chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. It is a policy aimed at ethnically cleansing Jews out of a region in the world, rendering it Judenrein. And it is a policy whose moral failing further is eroded by the colossal transformation of historical fact into hysterical fiction unfolding before our very eyes.\n\n\"Palestine\" Is Another Name for Israel, and That Entirety Is the Land that \"Palestinian Arabs\" Want for Their \"Palestine\" Country  Not a \"West Bank\" Without a Name\n\nThe \"West Bank\" is not the west bank of anything. There is no waterway, ocean, sea, or river in Hebron or Tekoah or Karnei Shomron or Ariel. Nor in Shiloh, Maaleh Adumim, Beitar, Shechem, Gush Etzyon, or Beit Lechem (Bethlehem). The nomenclature is fallacious, itself reflecting history's great cover-up: There is no such thing as an \"Arab Palestinian Homeland.\" That land always has been Jewish, except when it was up for grabs like a basketball \"jump ball.\" The Arabs never came down with that ball to put it into play.\n\nThere is no \"Palestinian people,\" and the only \"Palestine\" that ever existed was synonymous with the Jewish homeland that later was renamed \"Israel.\" Rent a copy of the movie \"Exodus.\" Listen dispassionately to the dialogue. Don't take sides. Just listen for definitions. The British, fairly or unfairly, are depicted as the bad guys in the movie, trying to keep the Jews out of \"Palestine.\" Paul Newman is trying to get the Jews into \"Palestine.\" Everyone watching the movie perceives that \"Palestine\" is a name that refers synonymously with \"Israel.\" Thus, what we seem to have here is a failure to communicate. It could not be simpler: For the past two thousand years, since the Romans renamed the land as they expelled and exiled its Jews, \"Israel\" always was \"Palestine,\" and \"Palestine\" always was \"Israel.\"\n\nThere never ever was an Arab Palestine entity. Who, after all, ever was its leader? Try to name any leader who ever in history led the sovereign \"Palestinian Arab\" people of \"Arab Palestine.\" What year was it founded? What was the name of its capital city  any capital city? Where is the drawing or photograph of its seat of government, or the place where its governmental leader lived? What was the name of its currency? Whose face, what slogan was on that currency? When did it fall? In which Olympic Games did it compete? Which issue of Encyclopedia Britannica had an entry for its government? Can anyone answer any one of these questions?\n\nAnyone? Anyone?\n\nConsider it this way: The American city of Palestine, Texas was founded in 1846. It was so named in honor of an early settler there, Daniel Parker, who hailed from Palestine, Illinois. That Palestine was chartered in 1811. It drew its name in 1678 from the French explorer, Jean LaMotte, who looked at the land and named it \"Palestine\" because it reminded him of the Biblical Promised Land of the Jews, flowing with milk and honey. No one associated \"Palestine\" with the Arab community, not even in the 1600s. Rather, the name was associated with the Jews and their Biblical Promised Land. The same with Palestine, Arkansas and East Palestine, Ohio.\n\nThe \"West Bank\" is a ridiculous name for a land that has fewer ocean-front properties than Arizona. The \"West Bank\" of what? Hebron is not on the west bank of the Jordan. Nor is Shechem. Nor Bethlehem. Nor Karnei Shomron, Maaleh Adumim, Ariel, Beit El, Tekoah, nor so many others.\n\nIt would sooner make sense to rename New Jersey or Arkansas \"the West Bank\" (Hudson River, Mississippi River). But those territories have names of their own, reflecting a real history of people who named the land.\n\nThe Arabs call that section of Palestine/Israel the \"West Bank\" because, despite 1500 years' time for Islam to leave its mark on the region and more than two millennia of Mideast word-play, the Arabs have no other name for the land. What country  what people  has no name for its own land? And they cannot bear to call it by the names it always has borne: \"Samaria\" and \"Judea.\" Not that the Arab world has problems with using other Biblical names  Lebanon, Tyre, Sidon, Damascus, Bethlehem. They just cannot use that one  Yehudah, Shomron  because once they find themselves compelled to justify their terrorism on grounds that \"we Palestinians have the eternal right to return to our eternal home, the great Arab country of Yehudah/Judea,\" the jig is up.\n\nFor decades, from its founding in December 1932 until two years after Israel's 1948 sovereignty was established, the Jewish newspaper in Israel for Anglophones was the Palestine Post; it was not re-named \"The Jerusalem Post\" until 1950. Jewish people in the 1930s and 1940s had blue charity boxes on their kitchen counters to raise money for the \"Jewish National Fund for Palestine,\" and the Bergson-Merlin \"American League for a Free Palestine\" raised money for Menachem Begin's Irgun. When the PLO  the Palestine Liberation Organization  was founded in 1964 to Liberate Palestine, they were then holding the \"West Bank\" (under Jordan occupation) and Gaza (Egypt occupation), but their effort to Liberate Palestine did not include throwing Jordanian babies out of windows or killing Egyptian athletes in a passionate drive to return to their olive trees in Bethlehem. The history of 1964-1967 clearly demonstrates that they did not care about Judea and Samaria (the \"West Bank\"). Rather, they wanted then what they want now: Tel Aviv and Haifa and all Jerusalem. That is what \"PLO\" meant in 1964 when they were founded to \"liberate Palestine.\"\n\n\"Palestinian Refugee Camps\" and Logo Images Now Worn by Their Terror Groups Remind That the Goal Remains Now As When the \"P.L.O.  Palestine Liberation Organization\" was founded in 1964: to \"Liberate Palestine\" by Conquering and Destroying Israel\n\nThe \"West Bank\" and Gaza were theirs for the taking in 1964. But they did not want it. The PLO's founder, Ahmed Shukairy, and Yasser Arafat his successor wanted pre-1967 Israel. To this day, the logo on their stationery and on their respective terrorist uniforms is that of pre-1967 Israel. \"Palestine\" in the \"West Bank\" only? Two states? It is such a fabrication, such a lie. Just look at the facts on their ground: Understand that they have built \"Palestinian Refugee Camps\" in Jenin, in the \"West Bank.\" How can a real people (\"Palestinians\") in their own real land (\"Palestine\") living under their own government (the \"Palestine Authority\") be dwelling in \"refugee camps\" in their own land? Similarly, how can they have Palestine \"refugee camps\" in Gaza, now that the land is under sovereign Hamas control? These actual open facts on the ground evidence the mendacity, the lies, stuff, and nonsense.\n\nWebster says that a \"refugee\" is \"one who, in times of persecution or political commotion, flees to a foreign power or country for safety; as, the French refugees who left France after the revocation of the edict of Nantes.\" Merriam-Webster, in pertinent part, says that a \"refugee\" is \"an individual who has left his or her native country and is unwilling or unable to return to it . ...\" So: are these Arabs residing in Jenin and Gaza \"refugee camps\" indeed refugees  these \"Palestinians\" living in the \"West Bank\" and Gaza under the \"Palestinian Authority\"? If so, from where do those \"Palestinian\" refugees originally hail? If the \"West Bank\" and Gaza are not the \"homeland\" to which they yearn so that they someday may be \"liberated\" from their \"refugee\" status  well, where is their \"homeland\"? The answer could not be more clear and manifest: In the \"West Bank\" and Gaza they are \"refugees.\" The \"West Bank\" is not their home, they know it, and they evidence it. They want Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Jerusalem. That is the home they ultimately seek, in their effort inexorably to destroy Israel. And that is the reason that no \"Palestinian\" leader can utter the words: \"Yes, in any final peace agreement, we will recognize the land set aside for Israel as a Jewish nation-state.\"\n\nAnd no amount of Jew-to-Jew lobbying by Rahm Emanuel can change the facts. Rather, the integrity of the Jewish American community is compromised by the insult and patronizing attitude that presupposes a community can be influenced to act against its own interest merely by sending it an emissary who presents himself as \"one of our own.\" In Black America, there is a sad history of Caucasian carpetbaggers working through the quintessential \"Uncle Tom.\" We do not need an \"Uncle Rahm.\"\n\nZionism Humanely Avoided the Moral Failings of America  the Greatest Beacon of Freedom Ever Created  by Seeking to Build Fraternally Alongside Landed Neighbors Rather than to Force-and-Death-March Them into \"Reservations\" of Internal Exile\n\nIn America, we do have a variation on \"internal refugee camps.\" They are called \"Indian reservations\" or \"reservations for Native Americans,\" and they reflect not only adversely but deeply shamefully on those who put them there: American governments like that of the Andrew Jackson Administration, whose Government adopted and implemented terrible, horrible crimes of conscience against the Native Americans. This country's highest elected leaders, in full and open view, at some point 150-200 years ago made a chilling determination that has been swept from the American national conscience and institutional memory: For the United States, founded inexorably as a White European settler polity, to survive and flourish, with its borders open to new immigrants from around the world, there would need to be a complete and forcible uprooting and expulsion of the native American population  \"Indian Removal.\" For example, \"it will relieve the whole state of Mississippi, and the western part of Alabama, of Indian occupancy, and enable those States to advance rapidly in population, wealth, and power. It will separate the Indians from immediate contact with settlements of Whites ... enable them to pursue happiness in their own way, and under their own rude institutions ... and perhaps cause them gradually, under the protection of the Government, and through the influence of good counsels, to cast off their savage habits, and become an interesting, civilized, and Christian community.\"\n\nConsequently, Native Americans were uprooted from Florida, from North Carolina, from Georgia, from states that many Americans today cannot imagine housed Native Americans. Their land was forcibly seized. Treaties and land contracts with them were breached notoriously and brazenly, torn up unilaterally, and they were forced on Hitler-like mass death marches to places \"reserved\" for them. This really happened in America. America did this, implemented in the open by our highest echelons and without mercy, to displace and uproot the Native American population.\n\nIt is deeply painful to visit the \"Trail of Tears\". Or to learn certain details of the Second Seminole War. There are monuments all along the miles and miles where the Native Americans walked their death marches. And they were resettled into reservations with such sops as permission to run casino gambling free from government interference.\n\nThat is what America did after our Government determined that, to create the kind of country envisioned by the Founding Fathers  a country that truly has emerged in history as the greatest and most kind, benevolent, and charitable country that people ever have created, with the greatest respect and love for freedom and decency that any society ever has registered  \"those people had to go.\" In all, by the time the U.S. federal government had ended \"allotment\" in 1934, that policy had cost Native Americans at least 90 million acres of their land, two-thirds of the land they had owned half a century earlier.

Rev. 1559, 1561 & n.5 (2001) (citing OFFICE OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, DEP'T OF THE INTERIOR, INDIAN LAND TENURE, ECONOMIC STATUS AND POPULATION TRENDS 6 (1935)).\n\nToday we compound the shame by designating our Native Americans as mascots for our sports teams: Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, Washington Redskins, Florida State Seminoles, Kansas City Chiefs, Chicago Black Hawks.\n\nBut Israel never did that. As Jews lived in a land that was and has been our patrimony for 3,000 years, we engaged Arabs as neighbors. We engaged the Arab community with respect. We desired to build with them. So we encouraged their participation in our society, in our government, in our Parliament. Yes, Israel would be a Jewish nation-state, in a world that already recognizes more than twenty Arab states. There are so many Arab countries, even with names like United Arab Emirates, that they even have an Arab League. And for us, as Jews, there is one country to which we trace our heritage and legacy. Until 1948 it was called \"Palestine,\" and \"Palestine\" was renamed \"Israel\" when the country became independent.\n\nOnly One Jewish Homeland: Passionately Loved Without Interruption and Yearned-for Through 2,000 Years of Exile\n\nThis land of \"Palestine\" or \"Israel\" always has been the Jewish homeland. For 2,000 years  from the time that the ancient Roman Empire conquered Jerusalem, expelled Jews from the Land, and re-named the land \"Palestina\" to eradicate its Jewish character in the popular memory  to this day we have continued praying three times daily for a return to Palestine/Israel. We fasted several times every year in tearful memory of events that led to Jews being exiled from the land 2,600 years ago by the Babylonians and again 2,000 years ago by the ancient Romans. We adopted customs, at the core of our Jewish identity, to remember Palestine/Israel. So, in all our prayers these past 2,000 years, we have faced Palestine/Israel during our prayers. We literally coordinate our synagogue architecture to assure that we pray facing Palestine/Israel. In America, we pray facing East, and in Russia we pray facing West. In Africa, we pray facing North.\n\nAt all our weddings for these past 2,000 years, the groom breaks a glass under the wedding canopy in memory of the destruction of the Holy Temple in East Jerusalem and the exile from Palestine/Israel. When we visit someone whose relative has died, we console the mourner with our hopeful prayer: \"May [G-d], the One Who is in Every Place, console you among the rest [of us], who mourn for [the fall 2,000 years ago] of Zion and Jerusalem.\" As we dance with the bride and groom, we sing  as we have sung for 2,000 years  \"There yet again will be heard in cities throughout Judea and in the streets of Jerusalem the sounds of rejoicing and sounds of happiness, the sound of the groom and the sound of the bride.\" For 2,000 years we have taken a day out of our lives each summer to mourn for the fall of Jerusalem: devoting the night and day to reciting tearful lamentations, fasting, crying, dimming our lights for much of the day, refusing to sit comfortably on chairs but instead sitting on the floor or overturned chairs. For 2,000 years we have left partially unpainted a section of every home in which we have lived, partially incomplete to remind us that East Jerusalem, with her Temple destroyed, is partially incomplete. Even after our every meal, we have recited a prayer for 2,000 years asking that G-d restore and rebuild Jerusalem.\n\nDo Americans  the deepest, most patriotic of my countrymen  know the precise day on which the British burned down the White House during the Madison Administration in the course of the War of 1812? The Temple in Jerusalem was burned on the Ninth Day of Av. How do we Americans commemorate that incineration of the White House? Jews have never forgotten the eternal connection with the Land of Israel. And Jews continued living in that land. In 1929, Arab marauders still were perpetrating massacres, trying to remove Jews, for once and for all, from the City of Hebron, the City where our Biblical ancestors  Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob, Leah  lie interred at the Cave of Makhpelah. New waves of Arab massacres from 1936-1939 sought to drive Jews out of Shechem/Nablus. Within half a century, Jews were back.\n\nAgain.\n\nIn an Era of Mass Population Exchanges, the Arab World Hatefully Drove out 700,000 Jews and Confiscated All Their Property and Assets, Even as Israelis Pleaded with Their Arab Neighbors to Remain and Build a New Western Democracy Together\n\nAnd yet, as a Jewish State was coming into being, we sought to live in peace with Arabs living there. Jews in Israel still seek to live in peace with them. Even as they forcibly expelled as many as 700,000 Jews from the various and respective Arab lands, lands like Yemen and Morocco, Syria and Iraq  driving them out, confiscating their land and portable property, confiscating their liquid assets, driving them into exile between the late 1930s and early 1950s  Israel was pleading with landed Arabs to remain within her borders, to remain and live side-by-side in peace.\n\nMaybe many of those Arab residents would have remained behind if leaders of the invading Arab armies did not impel them to leave, to abandon their homes, essentially to get the heck out of the darned way during the planned extermination of the nascent Jewish State, as the Arab legions marched on Palestine/pre-Israel to drive the \"Jews into the sea.\"\n\nMany Arabs did indeed flee, as a result. They opted to get out of the way. Not as many Arabs left Israel as the number of Jews who forcibly were driven out of the Arab lands at the time. But many left. Perhaps 400,000. Perhaps more. And the vast majority of those who chose to leave departed not from Gaza nor from the \"West Bank\" but from the core of Israel itself. That is why they do not perceive a \"Palestine homeland\" in the \"West Bank\" or Gaza as their home, as a resolution of anything. It would be like telling someone who fled France, for one reason or another, that he will be \"restored\" to a \"home\" in neighboring Germany. Imagine your own situation: you have been forced out of your home, perhaps by a force majeure, in Teaneck, New Jersey or Brooklyn, New York  and your insurance company offers you a replacement home in Boise, Idaho or Butte, Montana. Is that \"good enough\" a replacement, given that it all is in the same country? So, how does a \"home\" in Berlin restore exile from Paris? And how does a \"home\" in Bethlehem restore a perceived exile from Tel Aviv or Haifa? Those questions' answers are the reasons that the logo of the uniform is what it is, why the \"refugee camps\" are where they are, and why the \"Two-State Solution\" fails by ignoring the reality that \"Palestinian Arabs\" cannot accept Tel Aviv, Haifa, and West Jerusalem as \"Jewish.\"\n\nThose Arabs who left Israel could have stayed. The Jews asked them to stay. Unlike the 700,000 Jews who were driven into exile from homes in Arab lands, those Arabs were not driven out. Unlike Native Americans, they were not driven off their lands. And unlike other exiles, they were put into concentration environments  Arab \"refugee camps\"  by their own people.\n\nWhile the nascent State of Israel gamely was constructing a home and frantically was working to absorb the huge influx of landless, destitute Jewish exiles and refugees from Arab lands, the Arab world was building concentration camps and reservations for their own people, fellow Arabs, where those emigres would languish. Half a century later, while the Jewish refugees from Arab lands have seen their children become doctors and computer programmers, world leaders, attorneys, business moguls, plumbers, contractors, entertainment executives, and anything else out there, the children of those Arab emigres have become the victims of the world's most heinous example of cynical self-hatred. They remain in \"refugee camps\" that are historical anomalies and today are thoroughly anachronistic. They remain on international welfare, under the rubric of a cynically anti-Jewish United Nations agency, the \"United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\" (UNRWA), which runs the camps and their schools, and has a vested interest  namely, preserving their own existence, preserving their own continued employment and pay checks, preserving their jobs  in perpetuating the historical crime of refusing to let the residents be absorbed into their local environments.\n\nDuring the last century, the world has seen so many tragically painful \"population exchanges\" play themselves out on the world stage. Greek ethnics were forced out of Bulgaria and into Greece, while Bulgarian ethnics were forced from Greece into Bulgaria. In 1922, under the League of Nations, 1.25 million Greek Orthodox ethnics were transferred from Turkey, and half a million Moslems were transferred reciprocally to Turkey from Greece. Fridtjof Nansen, the guy who oversaw the population exchange, was awarded the 1922 Nobel Peace Prize for his effort. In 1940, under the Treaty of Craiova, there was a massive population exchange: 80,000 Romanian ethnics were forced into Bulgaria, and 65,000 Bulgarian ethnics forced out of Romania. After World War II, between 14-16 million ethnic Germans were transferred out of Central and Eastern Europe, and into Germany. Poland and the Soviet Union exchanged populations: between 1944 and 1946, some 2 million people, Polish ethnics sent to Poland from the Ukraine and Ukrainians sent out of Poland, were transferred. More than 5 million Hindus and Sikhs were forced to India from the regions that became Pakistan, and more than 6 million Moslems were pushed out of India and into Pakistan.\n\nThe Cynicism of the Fabricated \"Palestinian Refugee Problem\"...\n\nWhere are the languishing Bulgarian refugee camps? Greek refugee camps? Romanian refugee camps? Polish refugee camps? German refugee camps? Ukrainian refugee camps? Hindu/Sikh refugee camps? Where are the Bosnian Moslem refugee camps? Why is there no massive international welfare apparatus in the rubric of a United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the [Bulgarian/ Greek/ Romanian/ Polish/ German/ Ukrainian/ Hindu/ Sikh/ Bosnian/ Vietnamese/ Cambodian/ Rwandan/ Darfur] refugees?\n\nHow is it that no one even thinks to ask?\n\nAnd is it comprehensible that, at a time of national economic challenge within America, the United States funds more than one fourth the cost of this nonsense to the tune of nearly $100 million annually? By contrast, Saudi Arabia funds less than one percent ($2.5 million), and Kuwait less than that. Can there be anything that evidences more forcefully how cynical this entire mendacity is? The OPEC oil cartel raises our oil costs to the point of disrupting our national economy, and we responsively fund a massive, multi-national welfare infrastructure for those of their people whom they, unique among all countries into which emigrants have sought haven, have confined to concentration centers for more than half a century.\n\nWhat people holds and concentrates its own brothers and sisters in \"refugee camps\" for half a century and more? And, to make matters more bizarre, these people in the UNRWA \"Palestinian refugee camps\" are the descendants of those who departed their homes voluntarily, gambling that their departure would facilitate the Arab Legions' rapid success in obliterating the Jewish presence from the face of the earth, driving the Jews into the Mediterranean Sea. Indeed, it was their leading spiritual leader of the time  Haj Amin el-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem  who overtly and demonstratively allied the pan-Arab cause with Adolph Hitler and the Nazis. Yet, people who have persecuted the Berber minority of Algeria, the Coptic Christian minority of Egypt, the Bahai minority of Iran, Christians in Saudi Arabia  even enslaving Black Christians in the Sudan  would have the temerity to equate Zionism with racism and to compare Zionists to Nazis. There are nations and peoples who, over the centuries, have ventured into Africa and forcibly expatriated tens of thousands of Black Africans to become slaves in theirs and others' countries on other continents. But in all the world, in all of human history, Israel is the only country that ever expended national human and financial resources, risking her citizens' lives in daring midnight sorties and dangerous trans-continental rescue missions, aimed at liberating tens of thousands of Black Africans from persecution and bringing them out of Africa, out from slavery and into freedom.\n\n... And the Cynicism of Imposing on Israel a \"Two State Solution\" in the Face of America's Long-Term Commitments and Repeated Promises to a Time-Tested Friend and Ally\n\nSo what \"Two-State Solution\" are President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Mr. Emanuel talking about?\n\nThe irony is that this pressure from President Obama and Secretary Clinton comes at a time when not a single prominent political leader on the Israeli political scene even advocates building new Jewish communities (\"settlements\") in Judea and Samaria. There rarely before has been a more pliable Israeli government. All Bibi Netanyahu advocates, minimalistic and inadequate though it be, is the right for Jews to expand within a legal community for natural increase.\n\nAnd even that now is to be proscribed, despite understandings with the prior American President and his Administration that America would respect that Israeli right if Israel would agree to abandon Gaza and pursue other parts of the ill-conceived \"Road Map\" structured by former President George W. Bush and his foreign affairs expert, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\nSo Israel ceded Gaza, and the Road Map played out by extending all of democracy's virtues to the now-liberated Gazans. Freed to vote their hearts' content, they elected into office the worst terrorist goons freely elected to a democracy's high office since the National Socialists got out the vote in 1933 Germany. Hamas refuses to recognize Israel, refuses to live in peace with Israel, and refuses to recognize prior signed treaties with Israel. Now, President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and Mr. Emanuel emulate Hamas in one of the three critical immoralities: they unilaterally abandon America's prior policy and refuse to abide by America's understanding of the past that, if Israel compromises by ceding Gaza, she nevertheless may expand already established communities in Judea-Samaria to allow for natural increase.\n\nFor a team with the demonstrated ability to pull isolated passages from the Quran, it would be instructive to refresh consciences by recalling a few passages of the agreements that President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon reached, with the exchanges amplified between their respective advisors Condoleezza Rice and Dov Weisglas. America expressly contracted in writing to recognize the new post-1949 and post-1967 realities: namely, that Israel now has major population centers in areas in Judea and Samaria, and therefore there will be no returning to the 1967 borders.\n\nNor does anyone else in the Judea-Samaria (\"West Bank\") region have a better, more legitimate claim to the land than does Israel. Mexico has a better claim to California and Texas than the terrorists of Fatah and Hamas have to Judea and Samaria. At least Mexico can tell you the years they were sovereign there, the Mexican governmental leaders who oversaw the land, the currency they circulated there, and the years that Mexico lost sovereignty over their land in California and Texas.\n\nPressuring Israel to Abandon Her Security While Turning a Blind Eye, Deaf Ear, and Silent Tongue Towards a Concerted Vitriolic Hate Campaign Against Jews That Has Poisoned Children's Minds and Adults' Hearts Through the Next Generation, Even as the Hate Campaign Materially Has Breached and Thus Has Rendered Void and Nugatory Every Israel-Arab Treaty\n\nThere is more, so much more. America expressly contracted  in writing  that, if Israel were to cede Gaza, America would require that Abbas and his \"Palestinian Authority\" stop the hate-filled anti-Jewish and anti-Israel incitement among the population he leads: the hate-filled TV telecasts, the hate-filled radio broadcasts, the hate-filled summer camps, the newspapers of hate and their crossword puzzles of hate, the school textbooks of hate. Yet the hate continues unabated. Even teaching hate to the youngest of children. There is no comment or condemnation by President Obama or Secretary Clinton, and Rahm Emanuel continues unabated as point man for selling the \"Two-State Solution\" to American Jewish groups.\n\nNo Israeli relinquishing of land to Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas will bring anything but more Jewish suffering and more Jewish vulnerability, as the weapons Hamas placed in Gaza to ruin life in Israel's South (Sderot, Ashdod, Ashkelon) and the weapons Hezbollah placed in South Lebanon to reach into Israel's northern coastal plain (Haifa, Hadera) next aim to bring the cities of Tel Aviv under rocket fire exposure from Samaria and Jerusalem from Judea.\n\nThis is the reality on the ground  so different from the effort painted by propagandists to score points. Just as so much is confused about the everyday physical interface between Israelis and Arabs living in Judea and Samaria (the \"West Bank\"). Understandably, when a foreign visitor sees long lines of \"West Bank\" Arabs waiting to be permitted through Israeli security check points to enter pre-1967 Israel, the delay seems curious. \"Why does Israel subject them to such intense inspection?\" the visitor wonders. \"How terrible the life under 'occupation!'\"\n\nWell, a closer look reveals that terrorists  with a proven record of bringing mass murder  cross through those borders, too. Some are armed with body explosives. Others carry minuscule portions of explosives that, when combined with other minuscule items smuggled by other terror couriers in their cell, have caused horrific tragedy in the past. And that is the reason for the security fence and the long, long, slow, slow lines at that fence. The fence was built to reduce the carnage. Indeed, upon reflection, is the experience of body inspections at that border all that different from the way that America treats aliens coming across our southern border? Or through our airports? To get into a domestic flight, even American citizens are expected to remove all their metal items  even keys, pens, nickels, even a dime. And even octogenarian travelers  every single one of them  have to remove their shoes for inspection. And elderly people with heart pacemakers have to subject themselves to individualized security checking, full-body wanding. As do people who have had metal splints or rods inserted into their limbs during surgery.\n\nMeanwhile, in Israel, every Jewish Israeli must subject himself to inspection regularly throughout each day. Israelis must open their bags and purses for inspection, and submit to metal-detector body searches every time they enter a bank or post office, pick up a bottle of milk at the supermarket, enter a mall or train station, or visit a hospital or medical clinic. Young Israeli men and women are frisked closely and methodically before they enter nightclubs. These daily \"humiliations\" extend to body searches at weddings, bar mitzvahs, and even when attending regular synagogue services. Similarly, Jewish schoolchildren in Israel are surrounded by perimeter fences, with armed guards at schoolyard gates. By contrast, Arab schools and villages do not require such fences. Guards are not required at Arab shops, cafes, restaurants, movie theaters, wedding halls or schools. Arabs in the \"West Bank\" do not need armed guards to accompany their every school trip or youth movement hike  because they are not targets of terrorism. Thus, the claim that Israel treats Arabs unfairly when slowly securing the safety as people enter pre-1967 Israel from the \"West Bank\" is mendacious. Israel is fair and reasonable to them  why else would they be lining up, seeking entry? (One does not see Jews lining up to enter Libya or Syria.)\n\nThe Facts on the Ground: Every Israeli Retreat Has Invited Anti-West Arab Terrorists to Arm and Militarize, Rain Unprecedented Destruction, and Launch New Deadly Battle Fronts of Rocket Fire at Israeli Cities That Previously Had Been Secure\n\nIn Israel, there are Orthodox religionists who debate with Jewish secularists whether Jews ever, under any circumstances, may depart from land that G-d promised in the Torah to the Jewish Patriarchs. That is a debate that fascinates and engages religionists (in whose number I am counted). \"Realists,\" by contrast, simply need to look at the facts on the ground: Israel ceded land in Southern Lebanon in return for promises of peace. Instead, Hezbollah seized the region and has turned it into a rocket-firing gallery aimed at Israel. Israel ceded land in Gaza in return for promises of peace. Instead, Hamas seized the region and has turned it into a rocket-firing gallery aimed at Israel. Every single fact on the ground evidences that any Israeli cession to Abbas in Judea or Samaria will create a new front of incessant rocket barrage, and will add yet another rabidly anti-American, anti-West polity in the Middle East, which will arm itself and be armed by Iran and her cohorts.\n\nIf Israel retreats from any land in Judea or Samaria, it first will fall into the hands of Mahmoud Abbas, who lived a life as Arafat's Number Two (ancient history?), denies there was a Holocaust as described by Western historians (recent history?), and who explicitly rejects the notion that Israel can be called a \"Jewish State\" (this week's history). And he and his Fatah terrorists are the least of the problem because they already are out-polled among their residents by Hamas, who won the last election  freedom, democracy, as promised under the Road Map's vision  and who transparently are bent on destroying Israel (as well as Abbas himself).\n\nThe Grand \"Two-State\" Pyramid Scheme should remain in Cairo and at the Pyramids. The \"Two-State Solution\" is nothing but another term for a \"Final Solution.\"\n\nWe Jews do not do so well with Final Solutions.\n\nVisit Rabbi Fischer's website:\n\nhttp://rabbidov.com/twostate.htm (A version of this study may also be found at Rav Fischer's Blog)\n\nTo Go To Top\n\nSAN DIEGO  February 3, 2011  The verbal battle over American Egyptian policy goes back and forth. Yes, President Mubarak has ruled as a ruthless dictator. Yes, the idea of overthrowing this man and replacing his rule with an honest democracy sounds pleasant, but when the fine hand of Muslim Brotherhood appears to be pulling the marionette strings, one asks if Egypt's potential revolution will simply pull people out of the frying pan and into the fire. The Muslim Brotherhood, for example, is not particularly shy about its goal of liquidating Jewish inhabitants in the Holy Land.\n\nThere has been no love lost between Israel and Egypt over the years and Egypt probably never would have agreed to the current peace treaty if not for an eagerness to regain control over the Sinai, taken by Israel after Egypt attempted to wipe Israel off the face of the map back in the Six Day War. Still, for whatever reasons, Egypt, under its present form of government, is at least (technically) at peace with Israel. This will change immediately under the Muslim Brotherhood. Although few Americans would believe (or admit even if they did believe) that Israel should be destroyed, far too many are willing nevertheless to throw a good deal of the blame Israel's direction as a result of her \"illegal occupation of Palestine.\"\n\nIsrael-Egypt border\n\nThere are few subjects laced with more historical revision than the subject of the Middle East. For a tragic example, one need look no further than Former President, Jimmy Carter insisting that Jews should have peace talks even with the terrorist group, Hamas.\n\nAnd who could forget Washington correspondent Helen Thomas' call for the Jews to \"get the h--- out of Palestine\"? True, she apologized out of fear for her job. Then, after losing her job anyway, she admitted that the statement leaves her with no moral regrets.\n\nSpeaking to Scott Spears on local Ohio station WNRN 1490AM, October 18, 2010, Thomas said, \"I had to [apologize] because everyone was so upset. I hit the third rail. You cannot criticize Israel in this country and survive.\"\n\nWhen Spears asked why she made the comment in the first place, Thomas said, \"Because it's the truth. The Israelis, they're very aggressive. They have refused to enforce or go along with some 65 UN resolutions.\"\n\nOne might be tempted to comment on the utter ignorance of a prestigious journalist, but such a comment would garner fierce resistance from many sincere, misled people. Unfortunately, we have reached a point where one cannot defend Israel anymore without sounding as if he is supporting some imperial aggressor, even though Israel is a tiny country smaller than the state of New Jersey. And yet, despite this size, Israel seems to be the concern of countries all over the world, regardless of which hemisphere they inhabit or which ocean they border. And so, in order to defend Israel more accurately, this writer will challenge the mythology by answering some commonly asked questions.\n\n\"Do the Jews even have a right to be in the Middle East at all? Wasn't there a group of indigenous people called the Palestinians, living there since the beginning of measured history? Didn't Jews arrive after World War Two and conquer land that did not belong to them?\"\n\nThis is utterly and completely false! The Jews lived in that land since the time of Moses and despite some upsets from the Assyrians and Babylonians, remained in the land for some two thousand years until the Romans displaced them. Prince Titus destroyed the temple in 70 AD. Then in the second century, Emperor Hadrian crushed a new Jewish rebellion. This time, many of the Jews were banished and others were made slaves of the Romans. A small number of Jews did stay in the land and remained there right up through the twentieth century. However, the name of the land at this time was changed because Hadrian wanted to destroy Jewish identity. He renamed the land \"Syria-Palestinian.\" Palestine was a Latin version of the word Philistine, an ancient enemy of the Jews who were now extinct as a people. Hadrian was deliberately insulting the Jews. There has never been a country called Palestine. This was a nickname for the Holy Land under the Romans. The people who today call themselves Palestinians are Arabs and they referred to themselves as Arabs for centuries until they were dubbed \"Palestinians\" as a publicity ploy by the terrorist and founder of the PLO, Yassir Arafat, who himself did not use the title \"Palestinian\" until after the year 1964.\n\n\"Even if this is true, well then, OK. These Arabs lived in the land for centuries.\"\n\nIn ancient times Arabs could be found in many places but they did not occupy the Holy Land in any significant number until after the time of Mohammad and the spread of Islam. Muslims conquered the land from the Byzantine Church (remnants of the converted, Roman Empire) Through the years, with Crusades and other wars, the land switched ownership back and forth between the Catholic Church and the Muslims. Eventually it fell into the hands of another Muslim empire, the Ottomans. After defeating the Ottomans in World War One, the Middle East found itself under the domain of Great Britain.\n\nEven though the Middle East became a prize of the British Empire, England had neither the desire nor ability to run that region of the world forever. For this reason, they began working to create a series of new states in which the Arabs (who had helped them defeat the Ottoman Empire) could administer their own affairs. Although the term \"Arabia\" was already a general description for a large part of this area, many of the Middle East countries we know of today did not officially become independent nations until the British occupation and subsequent withdrawal from this turbulent region of the world.\n\nWhile working to create new, multiple states, Great Britain (with the cooperation of the League of Nations, an early proto-type of the United Nations) decided they would also offer an opportunity for Jews all over the world to return to their homeland. This invitation was called the Balfour Declaration. Needless to say, grateful Jews responded with terrific enthusiasm. Indeed, many children of Abraham did migrate from Russia, Western Europe, and other corners of the globe where they had lived for some two thousand years in ghettos at the mercy of pogroms or harsh policies of Ant-Semitic governments. A homeland of their own had been a hopeful vision to the Jews for two millennia. The most familiar Jewish toast (common at Passover celebrations) said \"Next year in Jerusalem.\" But few thought they were reciting much more than a pipe dream. Now they could really, truly return to Jerusalem! Just imagine how this must have felt! The Jews were going to sojourn to a country of their own, and not just any country; the very land of their ancestors, a land where a remnant of Jews had remained since ancient times, living side by side with Muslims and Christians who also had interests in Palestine and who viewed it as their Holy Land too.\n\n\"What exactly was offered to the Hebrew immigrants by the League of Nations?\"\n\nEverything we would today call Israel, everything we would today call Jordan and most of what we would today call \"the occupied territories.\"\n\nWhen the Jews arrived, many of them purchased land from Arab lords. In time, a terrain that had been little more than a desolate, flee bitten combination of swamp and desert, swiftly turned green with farmland and transplanted trees. The economy also boomed, transforming this area in such an amazing way, that the term metamorphoses barely does justice. New jobs were created, resulting in an influx of Arabs from other regions who now saw Palestine as a land of opportunity and employment made possible by Jewish farmers and businessmen recently arrived from Europe.\n\n\"What was the proportion of Arab and Jew in Palestine prior to the Balfour Declaration? \"\n\nMore Arabs than Jews inhabited the land at this time (resulting from previous Muslim expansion) but the truth is, there was really only a handful of each people group, because again, the swamp like conditions limited the kind of life one could realistically enjoy in the Holy Land. The famous author, Mark Twain wrote as much after his own personal visit. He was surprised how desolate the Holy Land looked, how little was going on there and how few people inhabited the area.\n\nAll of this changed when the League of Nations invited Jews to resettle their ancient home. Ironically, it was after Jewish business created a surplus of jobs that Arabs flooded into the territory in mass, creating a situation where the Arabs greatly outnumbered the Jews.\n\nIn paradoxical fashion, the British, after inviting the Jews to return, sold over 75 percent of Palestine to the Arabs, creating a new country called, Trans-Jordan. This is an extremely important and seldom taught fact. Please catch this: 75 percent of what had been offered to the Jews was sold behind their backs to the Arabs instead! Not only were the Arabs offered a \"separate Palestinian state,\" long ago, but they have been living in one since the early part of the Twentieth Century. It's called Jordan, a country three times the size of what remained for the Jews.\n\nThe Jews accepted this betrayal, only because they had no choice. After, all a sliver of the promise was better than no land at all.\n\nBut the Arabs didn't want the Jews to have even a sliver and fresh controversy broke out over what to do with the remaining 25 percent.\n\nTo appease the Arabs, the United Nations voted to divvy up the remaining 25 percent between the Jews and the Arabs. The Jews accepted this partition. The Arabs did not.\n\nAfter the partition vote from the United Nations, Israel declared its Independence on May 14, 1948. One day later, five Arab armies invaded Israel from Egypt, Tran Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq.\n\nImportant Note: This war had nothing to do with allowing a two state solution. Indeed, the Arabs waged war because they were rejecting a two state solution. Their stated goal was the complete extermination of Israel!\n\nFrom Abid Saud King of Saudi Arabia 1947:\n\n\" There are fifty million Arabs. What does it matter if we lose ten million people to kill all of the Jews. The price is worth it.\"\n\nFrom Azam Pasha, Secretary General of the Arabs League 1947:\n\n\"This will be a war of extermination and momentous massacre, which will be spoken of like the Mongolian Massacres.\"\n\nFrom Haj Amin El Hussein Mufti of Jerusalem 1947\n\n\" I declare a holy war my Moslem brothers. Murder the Jews! Murder them all!\"\n\nJews pleaded with Palestinian Arabs to remain in their homes. Although many of the Arabs did flee or join the invading armies, a considerable portion of Arabs remained in Israel. This interesting fact is seldom discussed. About 300,000 Arabs fled Israel and about 160,000 remained. Today Israel still contains a vital Arab population and these Arabs have more rights in Israel than any other Arab in any Arab country! In fact, shortly before Yassir Arafat's death, when there was talk (once again) under the Bush administration, of a \"separate Palestinian state\" the Arab citizens in Israel were asked if they wanted to move, renouncing their Israeli citizenship, and live in the Palestine sector. Guess what they decided! Some of them probably fell on the floor laughing before saying to the Israeli government, \"Oh, I'm sorry. You were serious.\"\n\nIn 1948, when Israel beat the odds and defeated five invading nations, the problem of refugees came up. We always hear about the Arab refugees from Israel. But they were not the only refugees. Hundreds of thousands of Jews were kicked out of Arab lands too. All of the Jewish refugees were welcomed into Israel where as Arabs who wanted to resettle in Arab countries were (for the most part) denied admission. Jordan was an exception but even in Jordan most of the refugees were confined to camps. They lived in that condition all the way up to 1967, when Israel annexed Jordan's West Bank. Prior to 1967 there was no significant ongoing discussion amongst the countries of the world regarding Jordan's treatment of the \"poor Palestinians.\"\n\nOn December 11, 1948, the United Nations drafted and ratified Resolution 194. This was a call for the Arab states and Israel to resolve the refugee/resettlement issues but the condition was that all returning citizens would agree to live in peace. Receiving no such guarantee from the Arabs, Israel decided to postpone repatriation until her neighbors would recognize her right to exist.\n\nIn 1967, 9 different nations (Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria, Kuwait, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq), declared war on Israel and promised to exterminate every Jew.\n\n\"Egypt is ready to plunge into a total war that will be the end of Israel\" (Radio Cairo, May 17, 1967).\n\nSurprising the world with a preemptive strike, Israel defeated the Arabs in just six days. At that time, their territory was expanded to the West Bank, The Golan Heights, The Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the remainder of Jerusalem (half of which had been taken over by Jordan after the 1947 war.) This territory is frequently referred to as a part of Israel's \"illegal occupation.\" I tend to hate that term and I argue against it for the following reasons:\n\n1) When we think of occupying countries, what usually comes to mind is an aggressive empire seeking to conquer and expand, not a tiny little nation that expanded its borders only as a means of survival, to prevent her untrustworthy neighbors from attacking again.\n\n2) Most of this land had been legally offered to Israel in the Balfour Declaration anyway, before Great Britain sold it behind Israel's back.\n\n3) Historically, the land had been the home of the Jews for literally thousands of years.\n\n4) The United Nations has become so corrupt, I no longer accept their standard as to what is legal or illegal.\n\nThis is not to say that Israel has not given back land or made peace treaties. The Sinai has been returned and other territories have been slowly transferred to the Palestinian authorites. But, when two nations make a peace treaty, there is supposed to be give and take on both sides. Israel's deal (brokered by the U.S) always goes like this. \"You give the Palestinians back some land and here is what they will do: They'll promise to stop killing you.\" That's the deal. Then, shortly after the deal, the promise is broken and missiles are fired into Israel from Gaza (where the Palestinians were finally offered their own autonomous rule) or a suicide bomber kills women and children on a bus.\n\nLet me be as straight with my readers as I possibly can. Nothing Israel does, no gesture, no concession, no discussion, will make a hill of beans of difference. They can sign a peace treaty. They can jump on board for a two state solution. It doesn't matter. Hezbolah wants Israel dead. Al-Qaeda wants Israel dead. Hamas wants Israel dead. Muslim Brotherhood wants Israel dead. But it isn't limited to the terrorist groups. Palestine itself wants Israel dead. The surrounding Arab nations want Israel dead. The Persian nation of Iran wants Israel dead.\n\nMy advice to Israel: Just do what you have to do. Do what you need to do. Do what is right. The world will hate you no matter what action you take and the Arabs will try to kill you no matter how much flowery talk you participate in with our State Department. You may as well just do what's right.\n\nBibliography\n\n1) Middle East Conflict by Mitchell G.
