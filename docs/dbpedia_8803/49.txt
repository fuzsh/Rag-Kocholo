The Thaler (sometimes Reichsthaler) was the currency of Prussia until 1857. From 1750, it was distinct from north German Reichsthaler unit of account in that it contained â1â14 of a Cologne mark of silver, rather than â1â12, and was minted as a coin. This change was implemented by Johann Philipp Graumann and the system of 14 thaler to the mark was known as the Graumannscher FuÃ.

Until 1821, the thaler was subdivided in Brandenburg into 24 Groschen, each of 12 Pfennige. In Prussia proper, it was subdivided into 3 Polish Gulden = FL = Zloty , each of 30 Groschen (each Groschen = 18 Pfennige) or 90 Schilling. Prussia's currency was unified in 1821, with the Thaler subdivided into 30 Silbergroschen, each of 12 Pfennige.
