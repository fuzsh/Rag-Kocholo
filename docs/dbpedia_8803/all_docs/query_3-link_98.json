        "text": "The Maria Theresa thaler (MTT) is a silver bullion-coin that has been used in world trade continuously. Maria Theresa Thalers were first minted in 1741, using the then Reichsthaler standard of 9 thalers to the Vienna mark. In 1750 the thaler was debased to 10 thalers to the Vienna Mark (a weight approximating a pound of fine silver). The following year the new standard was effectively adopted across the German speaking world when that standard was accepted formally in the Bavarian monetary convention. It is due to the date of the Bavarian Monetary convention that many writers erroneously state that the Maria Theresa Thaler was first struck in 1751. It was named after Empress Maria Theresa, who ruled Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia from 1740 to 1780.\n\nSince 1780, the coin has always been dated 1780. On September 19, 1857, Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria declared the Maria Theresa Taler to be an official trade coinage. A little over a year later, on October 31, 1858, the Maria Theresa Taler lost its status as currency in Austria.\n\nThe following mints have struck MTTs: Birmingham, Bombay, Brussels, London, Paris, Rome and Utrecht, in addition to the Habsburg mints in Günzburg, Hall, Karlsburg, Kremnica, Milan, Prague and Vienna. Between 1751 and 2000, some 389 million were minted. These different mints distinguished their issues by slight differences. In 1935 Mussolini gained a 25 year concession over production of the MTT. The Italians blocked non-Italian Banks and bullion traders from obtaining the coin and so France, Belgium, and the UK started producing the coin so as to support their economic interests in the Red sea, Persian Gulf and East Coast of Africa. In 1961 the 25 year concession ended and Austria made diplomatic approaches to the relevant governments requesting they cease production of the coin. The UK was the last government to formally agree to the request in February 1962.\n\nThe MTT came to be used as currency in large parts of Africa until after World War II. It was common from North Africa to Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and down the coast of Tanzania to Mozambique. Its popularity in the Red Sea region was such that merchants would not accept any other type of currency. The Italian government produced a similar designed coin in the hope of replacing the Maria Theresa thaler, but it was rejected.[1]\n\nThe MTT could also be found throughout the Arab world, especially in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Muscat and Oman, and in India. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in World War II, enough people preferred it to the money issued by the occupying forces that the American Office of Strategic Services created counterfeit MTTs for use by resistance forces.[2]\n\nIn German-speaking countries, following a spelling reform dated 1901 which took effect two years later, \"Thaler\" is written \"Taler\" (although the spelling of \"Theresia\" was not affected because of Greek origin). Hence 20th-century references to this coin in German and Austrian sources are found under \"Maria-Theresien-Taler\". The spelling in English-speaking countries was not affected.\n\nContents\n\n1 Details\n\n2 In Ethiopia\n\n3 United Kingdom\n\n4 Notes\n\n5 Further reading\n\n6 External links\n\nDetails\n\nThe thaler is 39.5-41 mmin diameter and 2.5mm thick, weighs 28.0668 grams and contains 23.3890 grams (0.752 troy ounces) of fine silver. It has a silver content of .833 and a Copper Content of .166 of its total millesimal fineness. note: Rome mint struck MTTs are slightly heavier being produced in 835 standard instead of 833 standard silver\n\nThe inscription on the obverse of this coin is in Latin: \"M. THERESIA D. G. R. IMP. HU. BO. REG.\" The Reverse reads \"ARCHID. AVST. DUX BURG. CO. TYR. 1780 X\". It is an abbreviation of \"Maria Theresia, Dei Gratia Romanorum Imperatrix, Hungariae Bohemiaeque Regina, Archidux Austriae, Dux Burgundiae, Comes Tyrolis. 1780 X\", which means, \"Maria Theresa, by the grace of God, Empress of the Romans, Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, Archduchess of Austria, Duchess of Burgundy, Countess of Tyrol. 1780\". The \"X\" is actually a saltire, and was added in 1750 indicating the new debased standard of the thaler. Around the rim of the coin is the motto of her reign: \"Justitia et Clementia\", meaning \"Justice and Clemency\".\n\nIn Ethiopia\n\nThe MTT is first recorded as circulated in Ethiopia from the reign of Emperor Iyasu II of Ethiopia (1730–1755).[3] According to traveller James Bruce the coin, not debased as other currencies, dominated the areas he visited in 1768. Joseph Kalmer and Ludwig Hyun in the book Abessinien estimate that over 20% of 245 million coins minted until 1931 ended up in Ethiopia.[4] In 1868, the British military expedition to Magdala, the capital of Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia, under Field Marshal Robert Napier, took MTTs with them to pay local expenses. In 1890 the Italians introduced the Tallero Eritreo, styled after the MTT, in their new colony Eritrea, also hoping to impose it on the commerce with Ethiopia. They remained, however, largely unsuccessful. In the early 1900s Menelik II unsuccessfully attempted to mint Menilek thalers locally, with his effigy, but styled following the model of the MTT, and force their use. The newly established Bank of Abyssinia also issued banknotes denominated in thalers. Starting in 1935 the Italians minted the MTT at the mint in Rome for use in their conquest of Ethiopia. Then during World War II, the British minted some 18 million MTTs in Bombay to use in their campaign to drive the Italians out of Ethiopia.[5]\n\nThe Maria Theresa thaler was also formerly the currency of Muscat and Oman. The coin remains popular in North Africa and the Middle East to this day in its original form: a silver coin with a portrait of the buxom Empress on the front and the Habsburg Double Eagle on the back.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe Maria Theresia thaler bearing the date of 1780 is a \"protected coin\" for the purposes of Part II of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.[6]\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\nClare Semple - A Silver Legend: The Story of the Maria Theresa Thaler (Barzan Publishing, 2006) ISBN 0-9549701-0-1\n\nRaymond Gervais, \"Pre-Colonial Currencies: A Note on the Maria Theresa Thaler\", African Economic History, 11 (1982), pp. 147–152\n\nAdrian E.
