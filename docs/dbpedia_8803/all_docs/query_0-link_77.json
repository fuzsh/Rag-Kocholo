The opening of the Moscow branch of McDonalds in particular was an expression of the “consumer revolution” that had begun to take shape in the late Soviet Union. Indeed, the Russian counter-project of 2022 contained a political message that consumption in Russia was not endangered by the Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine. This illustrates how important consumerism has become for modern and globalized societies and that consumption and consumerism are important political issues, while related advertising reflected current social and individual (self-)perceptions. Consumerism and advertising have become key characteristics of modernity. Consumption as a cultural practice did not just start with the fall of the “Iron Curtain”. In the continental empires, consumer behaviour and thus also advertising developed under conditions of multiethnicity and multiculturality with the onset of socio-economic modernization as early as in the nineteenth century.

It contributes to the understanding of modernity there, as consumerism became a key characteristic for modern societies and an important political issue. Consumption as a cultural practice did not just start with the fall of the “Iron Curtain”. In the continental empires, consumer behaviour and thus also advertising developed under conditions of multiethnicity and multiculturality with the onset of socio-economic modernization as early as in the nineteenth century. The emergence of the nation-states in Eastern Europe and the establishment of the Soviet Union had a particular impact on these cultural practices of (collective) self-representation through consumer behaviour. In Consuming and Advertising, we scrutinize these processes by offering transnational and trans-imperial perspective on the matter.\n\nvii\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction Consuming and Advertising in Eastern Europe and Russia in the Twentieth Century: Introductory Remarks Magdalena Eriksroed-Burger, Heidi Hein-Kircher, and Julia Malitska\n\n3\n\nRise of Modern Consumption and Advertising before World War II Handmade by Peasants for Metropolitan Consumers: Textiles, Social Entrepreneurship, and the Austro-Hungarian Countryside Corinne Geering German Advertisements in the Late Russian Empire as a Reflection of Consumer Policies, Culture, and Communication Lilija Wedel The Role(s) of the Czechoslovak New Woman as a Consumer: The Case of the Women’s Magazine Eva (1928–1938) Magdalena Eriksroed-Burger\n\n33\n\n55\n\n83\n\nix\n\nx\n\nCONTENTS\n\n“Soviet Style” of Advertising and Consumption Fur Trade in Turmoil: Pelt Commodification in Leipzig from Fin de Siècle to Sovietization Timm Schönfelder\n\n113\n\nEarly Soviet Consumption as a First “Battle” on the Cultural Front Iryna Skubii\n\n135\n\n“They Even Gave Us Pork Cutlets for Breakfast”: Foreign Tourists and Eating-Out Practices in Socialist Romania During the 1960s and the 1980s Adelina Stefan\n\n155\n\nTransformations in Socialist Consumer Cultures and Advertisements Socialism Without Future: Consumption as a Marker of Growing Social Difference in 1980s Hungary Annina Gagyiova\n\n181\n\nEesti Reklaamfilm as a Jack-of-All-Trades: On the Untold Opportunities of a Late Soviet Advertising Bureau Airi Uuna\n\n205\n\nTobacco Product Design, Marketing, and Smoking in the USSR Tricia Starks\n\n243\n\nConcluding Comment Consuming and Advertising in Eastern Europe: Concluding Commentary and Research Perspectives Kirsten Bönker\n\n267\n\nPeople Index\n\n291\n\nGeographical Index\n\n295\n\nSubject Index\n\n299\n\nNotes on Contributors\n\nPD Dr. Kirsten Bönker is head of the Institute for East European History at the University of Cologne.

The path of vegetarianism is the path of feat.\n\n—wrote Olga Prokhasko, litterateur, intellectual and the publisher of The Vegetarian Herald, a Kyiv-based periodical, in 1917 (Prokhasko 1917: 1–3). This passage illustrates the global trend that influenced (urban) lifestyles of the parts of the Russian Empire (Malitska 2021, 2022a, b) as well as Eastern Europe. A wave of issue-oriented lifestylereform movements that flourished across Europe and America in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, particularly in the areas of nutrition, clothing, consumption, housing and health care, was to a certain extent a reaction to and a critique of the rise of modern consumer culture, characteristic of modernity and often associated with industrialization, mass communication, urbanization and societal change. Anti-tobacco, temperance and vegetarian movements, with their counter-cultural and social reformism spirit, often perceived consumption as a danger, corrupting society. Such trends regarding different forms of consumption became transnational, if not global phenomena. They show that consumption is more than a “simple” consumption of products to maintain “mere” physical performance. These developments reaffirm the statement that consumption—in whatever form—was and is a tool of individual and social self-development and self-expression (König 2013: 11). Consumption is thus to be considered as a cultural practice that reflects values and norms, but also political attitudes. It is therefore not surprising that, particularly since the end of nineteenth century, different consumption patterns became an important topic within modernizing societies and were negotiated differently across these societies, even if products were similar. Hence, Consuming and Advertising assumes that Eastern European consumers not only adopted and aligned Western attitudes, but also developed their own ways of negotiating consumption and, last but not least, through that their own lifestyle in modernity.\n\nEntanglements and Overlaps of Modernities A growing diversity of understandings of modernity from the end of the twentieth century, as well as its “de-Westernization”, has recently become a dominant trend in the humanities and social sciences. Critical discussions have focused on the dark sides of modernity, on different forms of\n\nCONSUMING AND ADVERTISING IN EASTERN EUROPE …\n\n5\n\nimperialism and colonialism worldwide (Eisenstadt 2000: 14), as well as on the totalitarian forces embedded in some modernity programs. The sociologist Shmul Eisenstadt’s (2000) idea of “multiple modernities” and Göran Therborn’s notion of “entangled modernities” (Therborn 2003: 293–305), formulated two decades ago, have been influential for the debate. Eisenstadt proposed the idea of approaching modernity in plural, as a multiplicity of cultural programs of different modern societies which were not exclusively related to industrialization but to cultural changes as well. “One of the most important implications of the term ‘multiple modernities’ is that modernity and Westernization are not identical; Western patterns of modernity are not the only, ‘authentic’ modernities, though they enjoy historical presence”, as Eisenstadt (2000: 2–3) stated. He assumes that diverse understandings of “modern” developed within different (nation-)states and regions, and within different ethnic and cultural groupings, as well as within communist, fascist and other movements but were in many respects global (Eisenstadt 2000: 2). As a subsequent idea, sociologist Göran Therborn suggested perceiving modernity as a global phenomenon, which meant focusing on global variability, global connectivity and global intercommunication, but also on continuity and discontinuity. Hence, his notion of “entangled modernities” (Therborn 2003) emphasizes the coexistence of different modernities in their inter-relations which is a main assumption Consumption and Advertising relies on. That Eastern Europe and Soviet Union have not been overlooked and not included by Eisenstadt is one of the criticisms of his conceptualization, for example expressed by German historian Stefan Plaggenborg (Plaggenborg 2013: 67–78). Since the 1990s, a debate has evolved in the field of Soviet and Russian historical studies about the concept of modernity. The question has been whether late Habsburg Monarchy (Bachinger et al. 2021, Ganzenmüller and Tönsmeyer 2016) and imperial Russia, the Eastern European socialist societies and the USSR can be considered modern and, if so, in what sense (David-Fox 2006). The debate, conducted mostly by historians, has been ranging between four main standpoints of “no modernity”; “shared modernity”; “alternative modernity”; and finally, “entangled modernities” in Russian and Soviet history, brilliantly discussed and contributed to by Michael David-Fox (2016). Inspired by David-Fox’s elaborations, both notions of alternative and entangled modernities are equally influential for this volume (David-Fox\n\n6\n\nM. ERIKSROED-BURGER ET AL.\n\n2016: 37–38). Alternative modernity proceeds from the premise that communism was established in Eastern Europe as an alternative formation distinct from capitalism and the West (David-Fox 2016: 3). Communism explicitly positioned itself as an alternative modern project, and it was perceived as such. The most important feature of the concept of entangled modernities, suggested by David-Fox, is that various strands of the modern are understood to be interacting across time and space, across separate countries and national groups, both Western and non-Western, which might be discovered in practices, discourses, technologies, material culture, different forms of cultural transfer and the circulation of knowledge (David-Fox 2016: 28, 34). This point is of particular relevance for the study of consumption and advertising in Eastern Europe throughout the twentieth century, given the turbulent socio-political changes the region and its people experienced. Recent research on Eastern Europe has pointed out that its societies formed their own path to modernity, which was not shaped by large-scale industrialization but by small-scale industrialization and urbanization— an argument that refutes the assumed backwardness of the region. Yet, modern life in Eastern Europe was mainly an urban phenomenon and differed in most cities from that in Western European societies because of the influence of multi-ethnic and multi-cultural life (Gantner and Hein-Kircher 2017; Gantner et al. 2021). Modernity as such has thus been discussed differently, but not in the relation to multi-ethnic urban development and the emergence of modern consumer cultures and advertisements. “The divisions between modernities followed not only national and cultural, but also social borders”, noted Alexey Golubev in his study of late Soviet material history, because class and gender mattered in Soviet and socialist societies, similarly to the countries of Western Europe, and “transnational entanglements across the Iron Curtain demonstrate that different social groups had their own understandings and practices of what it meant to be modern” (Golubev 2016: 241). In the Soviet multinational empire, there was no single and unified Soviet modernity; intertwined forms of modernity co-existed within the Soviet project. The same is true for the socialist Eastern European societies. There is no unilinear East European modernity, just as there is no monolithic history of Eastern European consumption and advertising. We would like to spotlight the transnational histories of consumption and advertising within the region called Eastern Europe, with its continuities and discontinuities, commonalities and peculiarities, cross-influences and interactions.\n\nCONSUMING AND ADVERTISING IN EASTERN EUROPE …\n\n7\n\nConsuming and Advertising follows this trend of recent research on East Central European and Russian consumerism (see below, and, e.g., Verderey 1996), but aims to go beyond the analysis of case studies by offering a cross-epochal and cross-regional perspective. Herewith, we want to pick up and underline the findings which research on Eastern Europe and Russia respectively the Soviet Union has elaborated over the last two decades (particularly to urban development; see, e.g., Behrends and Kohlrausch 2014; Gantner et al. 2021). There, diverse and peculiar forms of modernity developed and were triggered through multi-ethnicity and multi-culturality, which had a delayed start in comparison with Western Europe because of lacking impulses of industrialization and the broad range of urban development but nevertheless found their own path. From that time on, consumer cultures developed with certain particularities regarding the respective national or socialist branding, but generally followed transnational incentives and exchanges, even in Soviet times.\n\nConsumerism, Consumer Societies and Advertising as Representations of Lifestyles of Modernity Even if “consumption” describes generally the use of products for everyday life or of services, economically, it is defined as the purchase of goods for private use and their usage by “consumers” (Siegrist 1997: 16–17). The main precondition here is that consumption industries had already emerged by this time and provided the “market” with (mass) production of consumer goods. Another prerequisite is that advertising, sales promotion and, last but not least, advertisements played a major role in the sale of such products in order to trigger the consumers to buy products they had no urgent need for. The emergence of consumerism is tightly enlaced with the emergence of modern industrial (mass) production and, necessarily, the rise of the modern money economy. Hence, this process is also interconnected with the broad distribution of consumer goods, the emergence of modern media, as well as of modern forms of communication and everyday life, particularly in the urban centers (Kleinschmidt 2008: 37). Yet, (mass) consumption needs to be fostered by advertisements which suggest that buying and using a given product or service will fulfill individual needs and wishes. A more sociological perspective connects such consumption with a modern way of life and (liberal) market economies. Even if humankind had always consumed goods, particularly food, the rise of consumption and the emergence of\n\n8\n\nM. ERIKSROED-BURGER ET AL.\n\nthe modern way of life are intertwined. These interconnections become quite clear if we look at the most impressive expression of consumer cultures: the emergence of huge department stores, which were perceived as sparkling palaces of consumption (and capitalism), like the legendary consumers’ temples of Printemps, opened in Paris in 1865, or Moscow’s GUM , opened in 1893. The time gap of nearly 30 years between the disclosure of Printemps and GUM hints clearly at one further prerequisite of consumption: the existence of adequately suited middle classes who are able to spend money on consumption. The example of GUM shows clearly that the emergence of consumer societies in Eastern Europe was retarded in comparison with Western Europe, but, as Consumption and Advertisings wants to show, developed particular variations. Although consumerism and advertisements are enrooted in nineteenthcentury industrialization and modernization, Wolfgang König, one of Germany’s historians specializing in the topic of consumption and the throw-away society, has stated that the question of exactly when consumption took on a societally shaping function depends on the analytical perspective—whether we focus only on the participation of the elites in consumption or broaden the discussion to include the majorities of the population (König 2013: 9). Here, the USA took a global leading role: The rise of the so-called consumer society was firstly a phenomenon of industrialization in the USA (König 2008: 9–11). If we focus only on the minority of the wealthy elite, consumer societies emerged in the nineteenth century, but if we take the participation of broader social strata into account, the beginning of modern consumer societies appears to have started in the USA in the 1930s, in Germany only around 1960. Through American incentives, consumerism has continued to grow, influence and shape societies on a global scale (idem: 20) and to drive industrial production and trade. The nineteenth century saw the emergence and global spread of industries and services that sought to satisfy personal desires as much as possible. As a reaction, cooperative movements emerged and prospered, for example in different parts of the Habsburg Monarchy and the Russian Empire, starting in the late nineteenth century and ending with the outbreak of the First World War (Salzman and MF 1982; Wawrzeniuk, ed. 2008). Although consumerism and advertisements got growing importance before the First World War, the interwar period seems to be a key for the further development of Eastern European consumerism, not least because of the value changes caused by the\n\nCONSUMING AND ADVERTISING IN EASTERN EUROPE …\n\n9\n\nbreak-up of empires and democratization, the Revolutions of 1917 and the nation-state building starting from 1918. While consumption is closely connected with economic life, consumption and advertising as the visualization of consumer wishes and behavior and consumption culture as a cultural practice became indispensable components of a modern lifestyle and (self-)representation in industrialized societies. Since the nineteenth century, lifestyles have been particularly shaped by modernity, not only because of industrialization and urbanization, but also because of the rise of mobility which provided a precondition for the dissemination of consumer goods, and cultural and societal processes that have accompanied and triggered the modernization. Here, following van der Loo and van Rijen (van der Loo and van Reijen 1992: 11), we understand “modernization” as a knot of interwoven cultural, social, economic and political processes. Thus, modernization is more than industrialization and administrative strengthening of the state—it also describes a modernization of “hearts and minds” and the emergence of new, “modern” values and norms, attitudes and ways of life. Within this process, consumption became an important part and representation of changing ways of life. Following Pierre Bourdieu (1984, see also de Certeau 2011), consumption suggests status and vice versa: it is an expression of claiming it. Consumerism could be thus interpreted as a representation of habitus and collective self-perception in modernity. It has become a part of the modern way of life and lifestyle products form a broad range of consumer goods. Consumption is therefore more than the use of resources for a person’s survival, and it became a social practice essential for creating and maintaining individual as well as collective identities, for self-presentation and the claim of needing certain goods in order to have a “good life”. These desires are “implanted” through advertisements, which negotiate a “dream of a good life” (title of Andersen 1997). Without advertising, the desire to purchase such goods would not arise. Because of these processes, since the rise of modern (mass) consumption during the era of industrialization, advertisements became an everyday experience in media. And vice versa: industrialization (and modern capitalism) was fostered by the rise of consumption and the production of consumer goods that had to be advertised. Hence, catalogues, the cylindric advertising pillars (so-called Littfaßsäulen), a particularly urban form of visualizing products in the public sphere, as well as billboards, leaflets and advertisements in newspapers and magazines became the main tools for communicating\n\n10\n\nM. ERIKSROED-BURGER ET AL.\n\nto consumers what they should want to have until the rise of modern mass media like radio, film, television and, since the end of twentieth century, the Internet. Hence, consumption and, on the other hand, advertisements and promotion form two sides of a coin—representing the modernized lifestyles and aesthetic sensations of (collective) identity and self-perception. As they should trigger desires to buy, they represent the habitus and lifestyle desired and emulated by the consumers, and are adapted to the current societal life at the same time. Both advertising and consumption have shaped forms of modern life since then—but only in the “rich” countries of “capitalism”? This is an assumption that Consuming and Advertising wants to challenge by showing that seemingly less industrialized countries, governed by a socialist ideology that claimed to be the counterpart of capitalism, produced their own particular variations of consumerism. The processes of societal change that accelerated in the era of modernity as well as the rise of consumerism provoked a wide range of criticism among contemporary intellectuals which could here only briefly outlined. Already in 1859, Karl Marx criticized the fetishization of products, while Adam Smith (Smith 1776) addressed production of consumer goods as a trigger of the wealth of nations and sociologist Georg Simmel analyzed the individualization and subjectification within a society (Simmel 1904, see also Schrage 2008). The anti-consumerism life-reform movements that emerged at the end of nineteenth century, for example, the antitobacco and vegetarian movements that sprang up all over Europe, were part of this critique. Hence, consumption and, associated with it, prosperity and the possibility of obtaining goods according to one’s wishes became the object of visions, if not utopian ideals, but also fueled a growing critique of capitalism. The most outstanding example is certainly Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel Brave New World (1932), in which consumption was presented as a social duty aimed at optimizing industrial production, so that even children, for example, were obliged to consume. Consumption has thus received a Janus-faced attribution since then: as a component of a critique of capitalism on the one hand, but as the result of an affluent society on the other.\n\nCONSUMING AND ADVERTISING IN EASTERN EUROPE …\n\n11\n\nConsumption, Consumerism and Advertisements in Eastern Europe When it comes to consumption as a characteristic, Eastern Europe has often been associated with scarcity and queuing—and not with broad access to supply facilities or a variety of consumer goods, because the subject has been perceived quite stereotypically until recently (Gronow 2011: 251–256). While consumption is ideologically connected with a Western, “modern” and prosperous way of life and of capitalism, consumerism in Eastern Europe did not seem to exist until the fall of the Iron Curtain and the transformation period. Eastern European societies had long been (self-) perceived as backward (West 2011; Sheresheva and Antonov-Ovseenko 2015), less modern and not fitting in with the way consumption is initially perceived (Goldschweer 2014: 31). Herewith, we connect the (self-)perception, even of contemporaries, of “backwardness” caused by a lacking range of industrialization processes (e.g., Szczepanowski 1888) and, not least, the images of supply shortages during Soviet times, so that the first branch of McDonalds in Soviet Union opened in Moscow in January 1990 could be used as a “synonym of revolution in consumption” (Althanns 2007). The issue of advertising is interpreted similarly: Advertising as the commercial means of influencing people to buy (and consume) certain goods, mostly available as a range of products on the market by different producers, seems to be strongly connected with capitalism and not with socialism. Here, we particularly understand consumer societies as societies in which not only a few members of an elite, but also where the masses can buy industrially produced wares, but we also acknowledge that first consumerism in the social elites and then in the other social strata emerged. An understanding of consumerism in modernity presupposes consumers buying and using products which are not only for individual or family survival but also enhance the “beautiful things” of life and are used for leisure and pleasure. Discussing Eastern European and Russian forms of consumer culture and advertising goes far beyond the scope of purely economic questions because of the premise that both are cultural practices which are closely linked with societal modernization. Such practices offer insights into ways of life, of values and (self-)images of societies through the forms in which they present production. Furthermore, they give us insights into aesthetics and, of course, of necessities and inadequacies of everyday life.\n\n12\n\nM. ERIKSROED-BURGER ET AL.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, particular forms of consumptions and specific ways of advertising developed during the later stages of the Russian Empire, the German Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy, though these were delayed in comparison with Western Europe. With the establishment of Soviet power, it appears that consumer culture and advertising were banned, but only at a first glance, since the rise of Socialism brought an inherent criticism of ‘bourgeois’ consumerism and can be outlined as an anticonsumerism project. Yet, a second glance reveals that particular forms of consumption and advertisements did emerge, spreading the image of the “socialist world” and socialist ideas of consuming and advertising, which also deeply shaped everyday life (Zakharova 2013, compiles studies by Eastern European scholars). This was politically necessary, since it became clear, that consumption and sufficient provision with consumer goods were considered by the people as the most important part of the promised ‘good life’; consumption and advertisement were instrumentalized to proof that promise.\n\nState of Research on Consumption and Advertising in Eastern Europe One may think that the “Iron Curtain” once separating capitalist Western Europe and communist Eastern Europe throughout the period of the Cold War continues to imprint historical research on consumption and advertising. Indeed, general works on this topic with a European (Siegrist et al. 1997; König 2013) or global perspective, such as the Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture (Southerton 2011), by usually following an interdisciplinary approach and focusing on the period from the Age of Enlightenment to the present, tend to summarize the whole East European region in one more or less detailed chapter, since consumerism is perceived as an outcome of the Western lifestyle (König 2008: 9). However, book series1 such as Cultures of consumption series or Worlds of consumption as well as edited volumes on the topic advocating a global perspective still tend to omit case studies on Eastern Europe (e.g., Berghoff and Spiekermann 2012). Access to and publication of archival records since the end of the Cold War as well as new interdisciplinary research methods (e.g., oral interviews) have given incentive to a vast number of studies on consumption in Eastern Europe over the last two decades. Operating with multi-layered concepts of “consumption” and using a variety of sources, scholars from a range of disciplines\n\nCONSUMING AND ADVERTISING IN EASTERN EUROPE …\n\n13\n\nincluding economics, history, sociology, anthropology, cultural studies and art history have examined the consumer cultures of former socialist countries. Hence, a considerable number of Anglo-American studies on the history of consumption in the Soviet Union either lean toward Soviet Russia and specifically its European part, or they focus predominantly on the post-Second World War period. Rather than providing an exhaustive historiographic overview, we would rather map some trends in the consumption studies of Eastern Europe during the last two decades.2 With some exceptions (e.g., Hilton 2011; Sheresheva and Antonov-Ovseenko 2015; West 2011), issues of consumption and advertising in the late imperial period either have not been sufficiently discussed in historical scholarship, or have been rather fleetingly touched upon in studies focusing, for example, on the history of retail, media, cooperative movement press, food and countercultural lifestyles (Brang 2002; Eriksson et al. 2010; Glants and Toomre 1997; Kokoszycka 2008; Malitska, 2022a, b; Smith 2021; Stites 1992). The present volume includes and discusses late imperial and pre-socialist patterns of advertising and consumption, aiming to offer a holistic perspective on the topic and thus bridging different political formations and contexts, as well as urban and rural dynamics. Existing research has focused primarily on the socialist period. The New Economic Politics (NEP) became hence one focal point in consumption studies (Skubii 2017; Osokina 2022; Ivanova 2018), while other scholars provided synthetic overviews, like Julie Hessler (2004). She offers a comprehensive study of the Soviet retail trade in consumer goods from the revolution of 1917 to the death of Stalin in 1953, covering both the supply side of the consumer goods market and its demand side— consumer behavior and patterns of consumption. Her book contributes to social and political history of the consumer economy with new findings on the extent of private trade in the USSR during the Second World War and its aftermath, the scale and ways of involvement of urban and rural workers in small-scale retail operations, and the relative importance of private trade as a source of goods for a working family. Hence, because of the precarity of consumer goods supply, black markets developed all over the Eastern Bloc, which first Jerzy Kochanowski explored with regard to Poland (Kochanowski 2010). Focusing on Soviet retail trade and consumption in the 1930s, Amy Randall (2008) adds to Hessler’s findings the significant role of the state by examining political and economic\n\n14\n\nM. ERIKSROED-BURGER ET AL.\n\nframework conditions and delivering a perspective “from above”. In addition, she shows how the role of women as cultured consumers was shaped, followed by changes in their social status as well as legitimization of trade. Focusing on the period between 1933 and 1939, Jukka Gronow (2003) has offered a sociological perspective on “common luxuries” such as gramophones, caviar and champagne, which played an important role in the new conception of the socialist lifestyle by promoting material pleasures that had once only been available to pre-revolutionary elites for enjoyment by ordinary people—at least on special occasions. With her analysis of Soviet consumer culture in the Brezhnev era, Natalya Chernyshova (2013) has highlighted discontinuities in comparison with the former Khrushchev era and demonstrated how consumption became a factor of social cohesion as well as individual self-actualization. While questions around ideology and legitimation play a fundamental role in each of these studies, the examination of communist consumption over a longer period of time has highlighted its ruptures and continuities on an ideological basis (Gurova 2006). Dealing with consumer practices and consumerism in (Soviet) Russia over a longer time period, Timo Vihavainen and Elena Bogdanova (2016) have convincingly positioned the Eastern European alternative against the background of an “affluent” (Western) society, while showing the complex and ambivalent attitudes toward consumerism as well as the dilemma it created for the population and the Communist Party. In this context, the ambivalent references of consumer cultures as well as popular cultures in a broader sense toward Americanization have been shown by means of consumer images and practices in Central and Eastern Europe, for example in countries such as the GDR or Poland (Herrmann 2008). By questioning the simplistic East–West binaries in principle, Paulina Bren and Mary Neuburger (2013) have demonstrated the commonalities and differences of various consumption practices across Eastern Europe, from Romania to Yugoslavia to Czechoslovakia and the GDR during the Cold War period and beyond. By examining the entanglement of labor, consumption and the public sphere, Nada Boškovska et al. (2016) have highlighted new forms of consumption (e.g., media such as TV) and everyday-life policies in the Eastern Bloc and Yugoslavia and have contributed the concept of “developed socialism”. As has already become clear, research has also been conducted on consumption, everyday life, as well as on mass culture in a broader sense. With their studies on leisure activities, entertainment and “pleasures in\n\nCONSUMING AND ADVERTISING IN EASTERN EUROPE …\n\n15\n\nsocialism” (Crowley and Reid 2010), historians have comprehensively demonstrated the various ways of “escaping” from hassles of everyday life in the Eastern Bloc after the Second World War (Giustino et al. 2013; Noack 2011), while Ewa Mazierska offers reflection on consumption and other everyday challenges in Poland since 1918 through an film studies approach (Mazierska 2017). With their two-volume encyclopedia on lifestyle, entertainment and leisure, Martin Franc and Jiˇrí Knapík et al. (2011) offer a comprehensive overview of the cultural developments in Czechoslovakia in 1948–1967. Connecting contemporary cultural phenomena to propaganda and ideology, this Guidebook provides insights into this region. Another study of these scholars (Franz and Knapík 2013) traces the social context and the impact of new ways of spending leisure time on the functioning of Czechoslovak society in the second half of the 1950s and the 1960s in greater detail. Drawing on various forms of activities (e.g., DIY, travel, dance entertainment and cultural activities), it discusses their often very complicated relationship to the ideologies of the time. Moreover, the study spotlights the transformation of the mentality of the Czechoslovak society in its new relationship to consumerism. Gleb Tsipursky’s Socialist Fun (2016) has approached the issues of consumption through the examination of the changing Soviet youth culture in the period from the end of the Second World War to the aftermath of the Prague Spring with a focus on Soviet Russia. Dealing with phenomena such as the so-called Stilyagi, a post-war youth counterculture fascinated by eye-catching Western fashion and music trends (jazz/swing), in particular the role of fashion and physical appearance in the post-war Soviet Union, has been studied (Bartlett 2010; Hausbacher et al. 2014). In their study of clothing fashions as an element of Soviet consumption after the Second World War, Jukka Gronow and Sergey Zhuravlev (2015) have touched upon differences and similarities between Western, capitalist fashion and Soviet socialist fashion. The Soviet designers and their Western counterparts relied on the same sources of inspiration. Authors point out the major differences between these two worlds of fashion. Commercial advertisements and promotions on the pages of journals and magazines were relatively rare in the Soviet context. Those socialist advertisements that existed were less appealing and less competitive than Western advertisements. In addition to practices and strategies of consumption, historians have increasingly focused on the various imaginaries, on ideological, political and economic frameworks, as well as material culture, in line with\n\n16\n\nM. ERIKSROED-BURGER ET AL.\n\nthe materiality turn (Gagliardi 1990). Scholarship on materiality in Eastern Europe (Reid and Crowley 2000), especially in the context of Russia/Soviet Russia starting with Peter the Great (Roberts 2017), has discussed the ambivalent relationship between the consumers and their commodities, suggesting a dynamic and relevant tension between individual desires, collective values and social functions (Oushakine 2014; Gagyjova 2020). With her study on the objects of Russian constructivism, Christina Kiaer (2005) further demonstrated the interrelationship between socialist objects, artistic practice and industrial production. Examining the so-called socialist thing (Goldschweer 2014: 41), the life of things (Schlögl 2018: 212) or, to put it another way, the things of life (Golubev 2020), scholars have highlighted the entanglement of political and economic power of people (as consumers), declaring them as a potential threat to state authority. Anthropologist Katherine Verdery (1996: 14) has summarized this as follows: “Acquiring consumer goods and objects conferred an identity that set one off from socialism. To acquire objects became a way of constituting your selfhood against a regime you despised”. Hence, luxury goods and quality leisure created a space for individual desires and self-realization within a context ruled by collective ownership and values and characterized through the discrepancy between political promises and the naked reality. Despite the growing number of scholarships on consumer culture and related topics such as materiality or leisure time, the transnational and holistic approach to consumption patterns and forms of advertising across the region and with a consideration of the longue-durée represents a desideratum. Gendered consumption studies is still an emerging field of historical research on Eastern Europe. Iryna Skubii tackled on the gendered consumption in urban Soviet Ukraine in the 1920s–1930s by examining the characteristic features of male and female consumer needs and in their interrelation with Soviet ideology (Skubii 2018, 2020). Using these previous research insights as an impetus, Consumption and Advertising takes a transnational perspective and aims to provide incentives for deeper comparative analysis including different epochs and regions in former Russian and Habsburg respectively Soviet spheres of influence. The goal is to reflect the ways in which this region belonged to globalizing consumption trends of the period in question, while, at the same time, highlighting the peculiarities of consumption and advertising patterns underpinned by specific political and economic formations,\n\nCONSUMING AND ADVERTISING IN EASTERN EUROPE …\n\n17\n\ninstitutional patterns of political and social life, social structures and the distinct historical trajectories of the region. Thus, the edited volume aims at including Eastern Europe into a comparative view on consumerism and advertising as social practices and representations of lifestyles of modernity. On the one hand, it reflects the growing globalization of the history of consumption and, on the other hand, adopts a transnational approach and a regional perspective with regard to heterogeneous and conflicting models of consumption during the “long” twentieth century in Eastern Europe.\n\nFocal Perspectives and Structure This edited volume offers a historical analysis of consumption and advertising in the region called Eastern Europe from the late imperial era through to the collapse of the communist regimes, representing a rare attempt to produce a “long” history of the region throughout the twentieth century. The cross-epochal composition of chapters in the first section highlights that some trends in consumption already started under the monarchical rule of the Empire and were only fostered through nation and Soviet state building. Moreover, Consuming and Advertising bundles cross-regional case studies, showing that, despite similar ideological influences, diverse forms of consumerism and advertising emerged, which were also influenced by Western patterns. Being aware of different definitions of Eastern Europe, we use a pragmatic approach and, omitting long historiographic debates about the origins of the concept and its varying definitions, we perceive the region “Eastern Europe” as a social construct and use the term to refer to those European countries that once belonged to imperial formations of the Russian and the eastern parts of German empires and the Habsburg Monarchy and, in twentieth century, to the “Eastern Bloc”. However, we don’t conceptualize “Eastern Europe” and the European parts of Russia and Soviet Union as a homogeneous region, rather on the contrary, as the different case studies show. Changes in consumption patterns and practices have often signified shifts in social, political and cultural frameworks, and vice versa. Consumption has often entailed symbolic acts affirming status and identities; it has always been about class and gender. Adopting an integrative approach to the histories of consumption and advertising, advocated by Hartmut Berghoff and Uwe Spiekermann (2012: 4), the contributions of the volume thoroughly examine multiple political, economic,\n\n18\n\nM. ERIKSROED-BURGER ET AL.\n\nsocial and cultural contexts and variations of consumerism and advertising in the eastern part of Europe throughout the “long” twentieth century. The setting of Consuming and Advertising aims to open up and inspire discussions as well as transnational, trans-imperial and transepochal comparisons on these practices in Eastern Europe and Russia and, in doing so, to conceptualize the peculiarities of consumption within that part of Europe, which has until recently been associated with “backwardness”, “poverty” and “hunger” (and not with consumption at all). Our volume aims at contributing to a scholarly trend that challenges recently dominant “powerful paradigms of ‘the culture of shortage’ and ‘economy of scarcity”’ (Oushakine 2014) and reductive conceptualizations of socialist societies defined by deficit and scarcity. Because advertising arose during the period of societal and economic modernization and could be interpreted as a signum of the modern lifestyle, the book traces the development of promotion from a broad cultural historical perspective, presenting different forms of modern consumer cultures and examining how consumers were animated to purchase consumer goods before First World War and in the interwar period. This period is closely connected with “new” ways of life, which were influenced by democratization as well as by the “Americanization” of consumption. By including pre-socialist forms of consumption, we are therefore able to trace the traditions and the peculiarities of consumption within Eastern Europe and Russia. Doing so, Consuming and Advertising wants to discuss how consumption and advertising as cultural practices represented modernity and coined its habitus and lifestyles. Illuminating various forms of consumption and advertising media in Eastern Europe, the chapters included in Consuming and Advertising show that this field of historical research on everyday life is much more extensive than one might initially think. The first section of the book, entitled The Rise of Modern Consumption and Advertising before World War II , deals with lifestyles and advertising strategies in imperial contexts in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Aiming to highlight the societal and cultural dimensions of consumer practices, it shows that the seemingly accelerated development to consumerism was already laid out by the turn of the twentieth century. Corinne Geering traces how peasant home industries produced for the emerging urban markets in the nineteenth century. Following this, workshops were set up across Europe with the objective to promote rural home industries producing\n\nCONSUMING AND ADVERTISING IN EASTERN EUROPE …\n\n19\n\ntextiles, woodwork, ceramics or basketry. These initiatives by state institutions, members of the nobility and wealthy industrialists combined commercial interests with the charitable objective of halting the rural exodus and granting social relief to people experiencing poverty. Facing economic decline and competition from cheaper commodities produced in factories, the sale of handmade objects from rural home industries required novel promotion strategies that underlined their high production value and drew on the idea of social change. Acknowledging these processes, Geering’s chapter discusses the international sale and promotion of home industry products by imperial elites, notably women, from Austria-Hungary in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The handmade products were commissioned and marketed as luxury items to metropolitan consumers in Vienna, London, Paris, New York and other metropolises. Based on contemporary journalism, advertisements and the writings of women, this chapter analyzes the consumption of rural textiles in late imperial society. In particular, it seeks to foreground the role of female social entrepreneurship in Eastern European consumer cultures at the turn of the century in the wider European context. While Geering focusses on the production for social elites, Lilija Wedel discusses the emergence of consumerism from the vantage point of ethnic heterogeneity in the Russian Empire and focusses on German advertising practices. The focus on German and Russian-German advertising is primarily related to the unique position and economic contribution of German and Russian-German entrepreneurship in the Russian Empire compared to other foreign and non-Russian representatives. During that period, industrial entrepreneurship was able to emerge after the reforms of the 1860s, and then, around 1870, the press and advertising business was able to develop and flourish until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. From that point on, German goods, Germanlanguage press and printed advertisements could no longer be distributed in the Russian Empire. Hence, Wedel discusses the role of German and Russian-German advertising there by exploring advertising strategies, communication networks, consumer culture, and local mindsets and lifestyles. By doing so, she shows that needs and concerns of consumers varied from region to region and did not develop uniformly. Since the section features papers on ‘advertising’ and ‘selling’, its last chapter by Magdalena Eriksroed-Burger focuses on urban consumer cultures and discusses how the idea of “the New” was promoted in the interwar period. Based on the women’s magazine Eva (1928–1938), the chapter\n\n20\n\nM. ERIKSROED-BURGER ET AL.\n\nexamines the various roles of the “new woman” as a consumer in the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938), a comparatively progressive young state. During this time, feminists succeeded in achieving important goals and in strengthening the participation of women in public life, not least thanks to the strong support of President Tomáš G. Masaryk. The representations and layers of images of the new woman, which indicated a specific way of life and was closely connected to consumption, are of special interest. Being a Czechoslovak new woman of the upper middle class meant being urban, “civilized” and cosmopolitan, participating in Western consumer cultures, but equally appreciating local traditions. Referencing the differing areas of fashion and beauty products as well as mobility and traveling, Eriksroed-Burger illustrates how a (rather) superficial kind of self-realization was propagated through consumption. Meanwhile, luxury goods such as cars not only functioned as status symbols and means of enjoyment, but also became symbols of emancipatory ideas. Consequently, these chapters show clearly that we can trace highly different forms of consumerism coined by social difference as well as ethnic diversity from the end of nineteenth century, on which nationalization had a great impact. Thus, the chapters discuss not only the uses of modern consumer goods and advertisements, but also the nationally interpreted and shaped perceptions of “modernity” that emerged through consumption and advertisements (see also Kühschelm et al. 2012: 25–37; Möhring 2009; Scholliers 2001). Yet, these rich and differentiated forms of consumerism were part of attitudes formed by capitalist industrialization and in late imperial multiethnic societal contexts. The emergence of socialist societies, first in the Soviet Union following the 1917 October Revolution and then as a result of the communist hegemony in Eastern Europe after the Second World War, did not suppress consumerism there but predetermined it: consumerism and related advertising emerged in a Soviet style. In line with this, the last two sections are dedicated to consumer and advertising cultures within the Soviet Union and its satellite states: The second section highlights the specific “Soviet Style” of Advertising and Consumption, but also traces its roots and consequences. ¨ Timm Schonfelder outlines the development through the lens of pelt commodification in Leipzig and emphasizes that Nazi politics cut business ties because of the influential role of Jewish pelt merchants. Since furs could not be advertised in socialist societies as luxury goods, the socialization of fur production and trade in the Soviet Union and the\n\nCONSUMING AND ADVERTISING IN EASTERN EUROPE …\n\n21\n\nGDR and the market regulation shows how pelt products were used as trading goods with Western countries in order to acquire valuta. Schönfelder’s case study demonstrates clearly how Soviet ideology shaped the handling of consumption and influenced cultural practices. Other examples of this influence are discussed by Iryna Skubii. Consumption in the interpretation of Bolshevik ideology in the early Soviet Union was primarily based on the fight against the Western style of life and the critics of “bourgeois” consumption culture. Commercial and state advertisements in the 1920 and 1930s were used to advertise goods and locate them within the socialist society. Hence, elite and prestigious goods were ideologized, advertised and consumed according to a particular Soviet variation of consumerism. Elite commodities, such as chocolate and furs, were assessed as anti-communist behavior by early Soviet ideology in the first decade of Soviet rule, but were finally reinterpreted as representations of Soviet modernity, prosperity and abundance by the mid-1930s. Tracing the emergence of the so-called world of Soviet goods along the non-linear path from their rejection to their adoption, and, later, from adoption to appropriation, Skubii uncovers the logic behind the advertisement of elite goods in the early Soviet period and provides explanations as to why the early Soviet cultural “battle” failed. Then, Adelina Stefan explores the tense relationship between socialist ideology, “Soviet style” consumption and the need to sell products, even to Western, ‘bourgeois’ customers and discusses a way to advertise the socialist way of life. Hence, tourism in Romania was promoted through the advertisement of “authentic” food as a main tourist experience as well as an iconic element of socialist Romanian identity. Thus, food is depicted not only as a basis of existence, but as part of a lifestyle representing pleasure and leisure. Since these three case studies discuss the implementation of socialist consumerism and advertising, the third section Transformations in Socialist Consumer Cultures and Advertisements explores the fate of socialist consumerism in the period of late socialism and also highlights the impact of mass media. First, using the example of the Estonian Film and Advertising Bureau Eesti Reklaamfilm, Airi Uuna highlights how the USSR struggled to ensure the provision of high-quality products or simply a steady supply of consumer items for its citizens and how commercial advertising was encouraged by the Soviet authorities under the conditions of planned economies. This chapter highlights the importance of case studies on the Soviet Republics, since Eesti Reklaamfilm ‘assimilated’\n\n22\n\nM. ERIKSROED-BURGER ET AL.\n\nthe Soviet lifestyle for Estonians, while also introducing slight modifications. In this way, advertisements became part of Soviet soft power, which was effectively applied in Estonia. This ideologically motivated reinterpretation of consumer goods was not only a signature of early Soviet Union, but also of its last decades in which Western influence increased. Although ideologists considered tobacco smoking a Western habit, smoking was part of Soviet everyday life too. However, the marketing of cigarettes was less intensive than in Western societies. Trish Stark’s outline of smoking in the Soviet world and tobacco advertisements shows that the Soviet regime was unable to suppress the habit among the population, which increased after 1991, largely because of Westernized promotion and product design. The scarcity of consumer goods produced in the Soviet Bloc and the allure of largely unavailable Western products provoked a desire for a similar kind of consumerism. Using the Hungarian consumer market as an example, Annina Gagyjova discusses how the perception of Western consumerism and advertisement together with the less flamboyantly packaged and advertised products of socialist economies woke a desire for Western-style consumerism across the Soviet Bloc. The legacies of this perception could be interpreted as one of the main reasons why many rejected an increasingly unpopular socialist system. However, the case of Hungary with its particular understanding of the socialist good life—very much shaped by the shattering experience of uprising in 1956—created what later became known as “Goulash Communism”. Especially in the 1970s and 1980s, Hungarian consumption culture became very much informed by Western consumerist trends so that the perception of Western consumer goods served as positive reflection foils and woke desires. In comparison with most other socialist countries, Hungary succeeded in providing more colorful and varied consumption possibilities, which were produced by a small stratum of entrepreneurs, while a growing number of citizens was unable to make ends meet. The conspicuous consumption of Western luxury goods by a new economic elite became a signifier for how the state party had distanced itself from the intrinsically socialist values of equality and social security. The three examples explored in this section show how socialist ideology influenced consumption and advertising, but the socialist vision of a good life was not realized in the eyes of the Soviet consumers—it failed, while ‘good life’ was instead associated with Western consumer goods. The legacies of socialist economics grew during the lifetime of the Eastern Bloc and the final “nail in the coffin’ at the end of 1980s was not least due to\n\nCONSUMING AND ADVERTISING IN EASTERN EUROPE …\n\n23\n\nthe Republics” striving for independence, but also people’s longing for better consumer conditions. The concluding and summarizing chapter by ¨ Kirsten Bonker gives a short overview of the state of the art regarding the cultural history of consumption in Eastern Europe. Thus, it pays special attention to the political potential of consumption, its significance for political communication and the impact of medialization on consumer cultures and advertising since the late nineteenth century. In particular, it reflects on methodical approaches and concepts based on cultural and new political history that draw on a constructivist and broad concept of consumption. Bönker highlights that we may analyze the consumer as a political actor and explore in what way various actors had the opportunity to (de-)politicize consumption. Consumerism and advertisements were cultural practices representing habitus and self-perception of both, individuals and the society, so that they were it could also instrumentalized and politicized as tools of soft power in order to mobilize the population in favor of the state and nation, in accord with the Roman adage of “bread and games”. The different case studies in particular underline the complexity and heterogeneity of this region and want to reflect differentia specifica within the region and in comparison, with Western European consumption and advertising styles, not least to discuss “socialist modernity”. Tracing consumption since the tail end of the nineteenth century, as well as focusing on Soviet and socialist forms of consumption, Consuming and Advertising aims at historicizing and conceptualizing “consumption” and “advertising” in Eastern Europe by deconstructing still prevalent images (particularly outside academia) of Eastern European and Russian forms of consumerisms and advertisements and through that at inciting more comparative research through the volume’s transnational and crossepochal approach. Doing so, it contributes to a discussion on modernities in Europe: Consumption and Advertising delivers new insights into societal and political transformations as well as into the relations between the societies and states during the twentieth century.\n\nNotes 1.

The high society of the Austria-Hungarian Empire gathered in the illustrious concert hall of the Viennese Music Association for a ball promoting rural home industries. It was organized by representatives of the home industry associations from the empire’s crown lands that had been established in the preceding decades to promote textiles “Made in Austria.” Members of the royal family and the nobility attended the ball alongside one hundred dancers dressed in folk costumes representing the different regions of Austria-Hungary (Fig. 1). These dancers were members of the regional urban elites who had dressed up for the event (Neue Freie Presse 1911). The main objective of the national dance groups was to stage the handmade textiles that residents in the respective regions produced and\n\nC.

Therefore, all guests of the ball were asked to include an element produced in the Austro-Hungarian home industries as an adornment of their dress or bring along a handmade accessory like a handkerchief (Neues Wiener Tagblatt 1910: 8). The Hausindustrieball, as the event was called in German, was a culmination point of activities by the nobility and wealthy industrialists that had been promoting handmade products from rural home industries in the preceding decades. Their initiatives combined commercial interests with the charitable idea of halting rural exodus and granting social relief to people experiencing poverty. As part of these efforts, products that were marketed as handmade by peasants emerged as a popular luxury item in late imperial consumer culture. This chapter discusses the international sale of home industry products from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It analyzes the marketing strategies and new consumer practices surrounding these products between the 1880s and the beginning of World War I. Faced with competition from cheaper commodities produced in factories, selling handmade objects from rural home industries required marketing strategies underlining their\n\nHANDMADE BY PEASANTS FOR METROPOLITAN …\n\n35\n\nhigh production value. Therefore, most of the marketing strategies used for selling home industry products branded them as objects handmade by peasants. By drawing on ideas of heritage and tradition, these strategies tied the handmade objects to a particular place, thus constructing a territorial identity of a product and concomitantly of its producers. By the 1910s, the notion of Hausindustrie had become a popular keyword in the Viennese press. It denoted a branch of the national economy referring to labor performed in the artisan’s home rather than factory buildings. The items grouped under this notion resulted from initiatives seeking to revive local skills and bring those traditions together with contemporary trends (Geering 2020: 74–75). The promoters of rural home industries hoped that their efforts would turn “worthless trumpery” into “solid and tastefully crafted products” without a steep increase in prices (Wilsdorf 1913). Through the channels of world’s fairs and other international exhibitions, a trade network was established for exporting the home industry products from the Austro-Hungarian regions to cities in Western Europe as well as across the Atlantic. Permanent shops were established in Vienna, Paris, London, and New York, departing from this transnational network, and special sale exhibitions were put up to raise money for charitable purposes. Studies on textiles have shown how clothing and fabrics reveal the complex relationship between their production and the discourses and practices surrounding gender, culture, and politics in modern history (see Weiner and Schneider 1989). Against this background, textiles have been a prominent topic in the history of consumption as well as the wider fields of social and economic history investigating global trade and the process of industrialization (see, e.g., Riello and Parthasarathi 2011). In particular, gender history focusing on the British Empire has investigated the social and cultural practices around textiles that were often performed by women and related to practices of domesticity (Goggin 2009). In historiographical accounts of Central and Eastern Europe, Rebecca Houze (2015) and Christine Ruane (2009) have presented comprehensive accounts of the fashion development in the Austro-Hungarian and the Russian empires, respectively. The rural home industry has not been the focus of these accounts, although this type of production shared the arenas, networks, and transregional trade routes with textile production in factories. Based on contemporary journalism, advertisement, and other media, this chapter pays particular attention to women as agents who were driving the textile home industry venture as entrepreneurs, producers,\n\n36\n\nC.

By considering women’s economic role in late imperial society, the following discussion seeks to expand debates on textile crafts that have so far focused on design reform and artistic practice, especially in the context of the Arts and Crafts Movement (Callen 1979; Amos and Binkley 2020; Thomas 2020). In the first part of this chapter, the discussion outlines the appeal of the countryside in luxury consumer culture by tracing it back to the popular representation of rural culture among the elites and the sale of ruralized objects since the eighteenth century. The second part provides insights into the late imperial business model of home industry workshops. In particular, it looks more closely at the female entrepreneurs active in the late nineteenth century. Finally, in the last part, this chapter discusses the media and distribution channels that show how home industry textiles emerged as an integral part of modern consumer practices. Thus, by detailing women’s promotion of products handmade by peasants, this chapter seeks to foreground the role of social entrepreneurship in Eastern European consumer cultures at the turn of the century in the broader European context.\n\nThe Countryside and Modern Luxury Consumer Culture Depictions of idyllic landscapes, pastoral sceneries, and peasant life in the countryside have been popular elements in artistic culture and product design for a long time. However, the living conditions in the countryside often stood in stark contrast to such depictions, given famines, natural disasters, illness, and hard labor that shaped the daily lives of rural residents. From the eighteenth century, the romanticization of poverty became more wide-spread across different types of media when educated elites started developing a stronger interest in the life of the common people by projecting a range of modern desires onto it (see Geering 2022b). Media ranging from paintings to product design, illustrated journals, postcards, and photographs contributed to the popular image of the countryside as a place where modern people living in ever-growing cities could find calm and repose (McElwee 2016: 78). Against the background of emerging national movements across Europe in the nineteenth century, romantic intellectuals further contributed to the construction of myths around the people inhabiting the countryside in Central and Eastern Europe. Village culture was perceived as reflecting the authentic traditions of the nation, and thus, the peasants came to represent the\n\nHANDMADE BY PEASANTS FOR METROPOLITAN …\n\n37\n\ncommon people in the sense of folk culture (Hroch 2010). This nationalization of rural culture across Europe was disseminated in various visual media and materialized in the design of clothing, housing, and the built environment. Rural material culture became a popular element in late nineteenth-century entertainment and exhibition culture. It was sold commercially—as photographs, porcelain figurines, or a costume worn at events—in increasing quantities and more and more places domestically and abroad (Geering 2022a). These developments were particularly prominent in states like AustriaHungary, which boasted the diversity of their population in official publications. Visual and material collections such as the 24-volume Kronprinzenwerk (a series published in 1886–1902 and dedicated to Crown Prince Rudolf) featured idealized figures dressed in folk costumes representing the empire’s different nationalities. Here, the countryside served as a rich source of inspiration to artists, writers, and designers who appropriated elements of folk culture in their work (see Moravánszky 2002) to devise a new national style. National economists and design reformers believed a distinct style could compete better in a market saturated with fashion, furniture, and products imported from abroad (see Rampley et al. 2020). For this purpose, in the second half of the nineteenth century, some artists resettled to permanent colonies in the countryside to revive old craft techniques and collect peasant ornaments. Artists established settlements and led workshops informed by traditional techniques in the Austro-Hungarian countryside. Prominent examples were Gödöl"
