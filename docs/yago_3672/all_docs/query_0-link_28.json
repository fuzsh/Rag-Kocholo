Case and his wife Jean to the Westminster Academy in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has raised concern among gay rights advocates, Philanthropy News Digest, October 24, 2000.\n\nAOL's Alarming Money Trail\n\nMichaelangelo Signorile reports that when looking at where AOL's big-time giving occurs-at both the AOL Foundation and the Stephen Case Foundation-on the tax returns available he could not find that a dime had gone to a gay organization of any kind, while we now know that millions of dollars goes toward conservative and anti-gay organizations, Gay.com, October 23, 2000.\n\n$8 Million Gift by AOL's Case Draws Protest\n\nGay rights advocates expressed concern today over an $8.35 million donation by Stephen M.

James Kennedy, whose church also sponsors anti-gay programs including the \"ex-gay ministry\" Worthy Creations, Gay.com, October 18, 2000.\n\nVolunteer / Intern\n\nThe AOL OSPA project relies heavily on volunteer and intern participation, so please consider participating in this important project.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nOnline Service Provider Assessment Project\n\nThis project provides a standard means for testing online services and determining how they treat certain types of content and constituents.\n\nAOL OSPA Project\n\nThe first online service provider to be surveyed by the OSPA project is America Online (AOL) and the first topic area was lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) content. Lots more work needs to be done to extend the report to other communities who may face bias, discrimination, or defamation. Help is also needed to produce a report that can be used in dialog with AOL and to keep our communities informed about AOL's policies and practices.\n\ntop of page"
