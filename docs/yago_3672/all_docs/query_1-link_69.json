        "text": "Steve Case\n\nChairman and CEO\n\nRevolution\n\nSteve Case is Chairman and CEO of Revolution, and one of Americaâ€™s best-known and most accomplished entrepreneurs, and a pioneer in making the Internet part of everyday life. He is also the author of the New York Times bestselling book, The Third Wave: An Entrepreneurâ€™s Vision of the Future. In his role at Revolution, a Washington, D.C.-based investment firm he co-founded in 2005, Steve partners with visionary entrepreneurs to build significant â€˜built to lastâ€™ new businesses. The mission is to establish Revolution as the premier firm outside of Silicon Valley.\n\nSteveâ€™s entrepreneurial career began in 1985 when he co-founded America Online (AOL). Under Steveâ€™s leadership, AOL became the worldâ€™s largest and most valuable internet company, driving the worldwide adoption of a medium that has transformed business and society. AOL was the first internet company to go public and among the best performing stocks of the 1990s, delivering a 11,616% return to shareholders. At its peak, nearly half of internet users in the United States used AOL. In 2000, Steve negotiated the largest merger in business history, bringing together AOL and Time Warner in a transaction that gave AOL shareholders a majority stake in the combined company. To facilitate the merger, Steve agreed to step down as CEO when the merger closed. Steveâ€™s passion for helping entrepreneurs remains his driving force. He was the founding chair of the Startup America Partnershipâ€” an effort launched at the White House to accelerate high-growth entrepreneurship throughout the nation. Steve also was the founding co-chair of the National Advisory Council on Innovation & Entrepreneurship, and a member of President Obamaâ€™s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, where he chaired the subcommittee on entrepreneurship. In 2014, Steve was named a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship."
