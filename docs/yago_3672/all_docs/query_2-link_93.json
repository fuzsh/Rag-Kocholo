        "text": "Steve Grove is the CEO and publisher of the Star Tribune, after serving four years as the state’s commissioner of employment and economic development. He spent more than a decade at Google, where he ran its News Lab. He also headed up YouTube’s first News and Politics team and worked short stints at ABC News and the Boston Globe.\n\nMary Grove is managing partner at Bread & Butter Ventures, an investor in early-stage companies. She has a long track record supporting tech startups as a partner with Steve Case’s investment firm Revolution and before that as director of Google for Entrepreneurs. She is also co-founder and executive director of Silicon North Stars, a nonprofit that she and Steve founded in 2013 to help young Minnesotans from underserved communities pursue careers in tech.\n\nDo you know a ‘Power Pair?’\n\nKnow two Minnesotans who have a close relationship and lean on each other for support in the work they do? Maybe they’re married or siblings or best friends. They could be business partners or a parent/adult child dynamic duo. We want to hear their stories on MPR News with Angela Davis at 9 a.m. weekdays."
