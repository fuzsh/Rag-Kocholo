        "text": "This post contains spoilers from the series finale of \"The Umbrella Academy.\"\n\nAfter four seasons, “The Umbrella Academy” goes out with a bang in the series finale.\n\nThroughout the hit Netflix series, the Hargreeves siblings have been fending off a myriad of apocalyptic disasters and trying to save the world. In the final episode of Season Four, they learn the hard way that you can only fight fate for so long.\n\nNeed help making sense of the complicated series finale? We're outlining everything you need to know below.\n\nEveryone awaits 'the Cleanse'\n\nThroughout the series, the Umbrella Academy siblings and members of the Commission have been the only ones to know that multiple timelines of reality exist. However, all that changes in Season Four.\n\nA group called The Keepers emerge and claim that everyone is stuck in the wrong timeline. Led by Gene (Nick Offerman) and Jean Thibedeau (Megan Mullally), the group has been steadfast in its mission to enact an event called \"the Cleanse\" to restore the timeline.\n\nThey put their plans in motion in the series finale when a large group of Gene and Jean’s followers gather in the streets armed with various weapons to prevent nonbelievers from interfering with the Cleanse.\n\nBen and Jennifer set the Cleanse in motion\n\nAs it turns out, Ben (Justin H. Min) and newcomer Jennifer (Victoria Sawal) have an explosive connection that will quite literally destroy the world.\n\nLong story short, the marigold that gives the Umbrella Academy siblings their powers creates an explosive reaction when it comes into contact with Durango, another powerful element.\n\nJennifer has the Durango element within her, while Ben has the marigold inside him. The reaction their connection could cause the Cleanse, would result in the extinction of the world.\n\nReginald and Viktor try to prevent the Cleanse from happening\n\nReginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore) and Viktor (Elliot Page) show up and try to reason with Gene and Jean to prevent the Cleanse from happening. Just in case they're not willing to negotiate, though, Reginald is prepared with his own armed forces who are ready to kill Ben and Jennifer on his command.\n\nWhile chatting with Reginald and Viktor, Gene starts exhibiting bizarre behavior, leading his wife to wonder if he knows Reginald or if \"nonbelievers\" may have influenced Gene. Unbeknownst to Jean, Gene's body has been inhabited by Reginald's wife Abigail (Liisa Repo-Martell) after she killed the real Gene.\n\nOnce Reginald and Viktor walk away, Gene and Jean fight in front of their followers and Gene/Abigail kills Jean. The crowd is shocked, but Gene/Abigail claims that Jean betrayed all of them and got \"cold feet.\"\n\nFive and Lila return home\n\nIn an attempt to fix the timeline, Five (Aidan Gallagher) and Lila (Ritu Arya) previously jumped to a subway that served as a waypoint between alternate timelines. While searching through a series of timelines, they get stuck.\n\nSince time works differently in alternate timelines, they were gone for what felt like seven years, even though it only felt like a few hours to their loved ones.\n\nDuring the seven years that they were lost, Five and Lila grew close and developed feelings for each other. However, Lila has always wanted to return to be with her children, even though her relationship with Diego (David Castañeda) has been rocky.\n\nWhen they return home, Diego greets them at the door and says he missed Lila. She says she can’t remember the last time he said that, but he promises that things are going to change.\n\nDiego learns about Five and Lila's relationship\n\nWith all the siblings (except Ben) present, things feel extra awkward for Five and Lila, and Luther (Tom Hopper) asks why Five is being so quiet. They start to argue, then Lila tries to calm Five down. Diego steps in and they start fight, then Lila tells them to stop.\n\nDiego notices a bracelet on Lila’s wrist and asks if Five gave it to her. Five says he made it and Diego then asks if there’s something going on between them. The siblings are shocked, but Diego says he knew Lila was cheating on him.\n\nLila explains that she and Five weren't cheating all along. Instead, they've been lost in a series of timelines and were searching for a way home for seven years, adding that she never stopped trying to find a way home. Diego asks if Lila loves Five, but before she can respond, the news comes on and the siblings learn that Ben is in danger.\n\nViktor pleads with Ben to leave Jennifer and prevent the Cleanse\n\nViktor sneaks into the building where Ben and Jennifer are stationed and sees how dire the situation is. Ben and Jennifer are now deformed and have become a big blob with intertwining tentacles.\n\nViktor tells Ben that the \"Cleanse is changing him\" and explains that if he and Jennifer stay together, it'll get worse. He reveals that Reginald plans to kill them.\n\nThe Umbrella Academy siblings try to stop the Cleanse\n\nFive's time jumping abilities have been on the fritz for a while, but he successfully jumps himself and his siblings (plus Lila) into the building where Ben, Jennifer and Viktor are.\n\nViktor attempts to pull the Durango out of Ben and instantly sees a vision depicting a peaceful outdoor scene. Reginald then tells his team to shoot Ben and Ben pushes Viktor out of the line of fire.\n\nAs Ben and Jennifer grow larger, the Umbrella Academy siblings and Lila try to fight against them. However, the more they attack them, the larger the blob becomes.\n\nTo make matters worse, Five and Diego start fighting. Lila breaks it up and tells Five, \"It's over.\" Hurt that she seems to be telling him their relationship is over, Five zaps himself out of the building and leaves his siblings behind.\n\nReginald gives in to the Cleanse\n\nAs Ben and Jennifer's life force grows and takes over the city, Reginald surrenders to the inevitable and Gene/Abigail sits beside him on a bench.\n\nRight before Abigail reveals herself to Reginald, he asks if she realizes what she's done by letting the Cleanse happen, and she says, \"Yes, I ended the world. And that's a good thing, my love.\"\n\nAbigail explains that dying was her \"penance\" for creating something \"so deadly\" like marigold.\n\n\"I was wrong and you made it right. Well done, my love,\" Reginald says before they're engulfed by Ben/Jennifer.\n\nFive finds a way to save the world for good\n\nFive finds himself back at the train station and ends up at a restaurant where he's surrounded by other versions of himself, all from different timelines.\n\nOne of these versions tells Five that there's only supposed to be one timeline. As it turns out, the marigold that infected their mothers and caused their births shattered the timeline and broke it into a many alternate timelines that are currently bleeding into each other. In order to stop the cleanse and save the world, the siblings need to restore the original timeline.\n\nFive returns to his siblings and tells them what he's learned. Viktor suggests that that's why he saw a vision of such a peaceful outdoor scene when he was trying to save Ben.\n\nFive explains that they need to let the marigold in their bodes blend with the Durango inside the cleanse. By doing so, they will be erased from history and no one will have any memory of them.\n\nDiego suggests that Lila take herself, their children and her family to the subway station to save themselves. Five explains that she needs to be part of the cleanse in order to save the world and says the cleanse will just start up again if she isn't there.\n\nLila zaps her family into the train station and Five follows her to warn her again. She gets on the train with everyone, including Allison's daughter Claire (Millie Davis), and jumps off the train at the last minute.\n\nThe siblings restore the timeline and cease to exist\n\nLila and Five return to the siblings and power up, waiting for Ben and Jennifer to come for them. Lila says she didn't mean to hurt Diego and he says, \"I know.\" Everyone shares their final thoughts with each other and the Cleanse overtakes them, killing them all.\n\nThe episode ends with the original timeline restored. The peaceful outdoor scene Viktor saw when he tried to save Ben plays out. Lila's children, family and Claire all enjoy time together outside.\n\nMany characters from the series are also there, including The Handler (Kate Walsh), Hazel (Cameron Britton), Agnes (Sheila McCarthy).\n\nSeveral marigold flowers then bloom outside, symbolizing the Umbrella Academy siblings and Lila."
