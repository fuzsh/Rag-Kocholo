What's Preservation? Preservation can refer to the protection, maintenance, and safeguarding of something, whether it's natural resources, cultural heritage, historical sites, or even digital data. It's about ensuring that these valuable assets remain intact and accessible for future generations. Having Known the definition of preservation, God has called us to be preservers of His creation here on earth, and he wants us to preserve them irrespective of what they do. What are we to preserve according to God standpoint 1. His temple (Your Body):- The body of man or woman should not be exposed to contamination, anything that can corrupt the body is actually what God said we should do away with. \"Every sin a man commits is outside the body, except for fornication\" God's love is reaching out to you. come to Him 2. Your Talent:- your talent is actually God's grace of enablement for you here on earth. He wants you to preserve your talent, don't sour it. keep learning, keep training, keep spending the midnight candle soon your Talent preserve will bring Gifts and fulfillment to you. 3. Preserve your spouse:- When you marry a woman, you don't just marry her for anything, you get married to her past life, you get married to her excesses, you get married to her pains and weakness, same is still applicable for the male when a woman eventually accepts to get married to a man she marries his past life, pain, excesses, weakness etc Then both parties grow in love by helping each other become better This is all I want you to know about PERSEVERATION ~ There's so much Truth our generation needs to return to because truth is absolute no matter where you take it to. #Oluwasholalife'sbranding #Linkedlntruththeraphy #RemedialHub #HealingSchool Babatunde Shola\n\n22\n\n4 Comments\n\nKARMIC STREAM #poem Ripples along a lazy stream of time crossing whirlwind space. Rippling into etched contours, teasing tricks of mind. Expecting miracles. One day precedes the next. Reflective pooling, a faultless, serene slip of spring. Next I know I am hauling logs through winter cold, ice-tinged hands and toes dripping nose, exhausted, wilting. Life brings no promises. None to hold them to. There are no changelings of the night; not even prescient aliens to awe us. There is energy. There is form. There is shadow bleeding into substance. There is here and now receding into there and then. There are the promises we keep never knowing we have made them. Ripples shining in the sun colours of a thousand worlds’ rainbows. Ripples quietly expressing, infinitely regressing, first cause last effect.\n\nGame on! Get your thoughts together and get your comments ready. The DEA published the NPRM (document attached) on May 16th; TODAY is the official start of the 60-day comment period. This is a 92-page document; you can read it all or just get to the meat of what the DEA is proposing; go to the last two pages and the last two paragraphs in this document to read it. Trust me when I say all the multi-state operators have their cannabis lawyers clicking away at their keyboards to submit comments. All the big players that are not in cannabis currently because of its Schedule 1 designation are preparing their comments. Who will speak for us, the smaller companies, the women-owned companies, BIPOC-owned companies, the formerly incarcerated-owned companies, and veteran-owned companies? We are, we all are. We are going to speak for ourselves and en masse. Now is the time to have our voices heard, ensure our priorities are considered, and solidify that our businesses, employees, and communities benefit from this rescheduling. The People's Ecosystem is putting together a working group led by Kate Stevens and Frederika M. Easley to help build comments for our company and assist interested external stakeholders, big or small, in creating their own comments. This working group is not to judge or influence what you or your company want to comment on; it is to help build the most powerful, succinct, and impactful comments to help shape the future of our industry.

You Don't Have to. Is fear the air you breathe in your relationship? Do you constantly walk on eggshells, afraid of setting your partner off? You're not alone. Fear is a powerful weapon wielded by abusers in domestic violence and narcissistic relationships. Why Abusers Use Fear: 💜 Control: Fear keeps you isolated and afraid to speak up or leave. 💜 They use threats and intimidation to get what they want. 💜 Silence: They silence your voice and gaslight you into questioning your reality. Does this sound familiar? ➡ Maybe you avoid certain topics or activities because you know it'll upset them. ➡ constantly apologize, even when you haven't done anything wrong. ➡ feel like you're constantly \"walking on eggshells.\" How to Break Free from the Grip of Fear : 🦋 Acknowledge Your Fear: It's normal to be afraid in scary situations. This is your body's natural response to indicate you're not in a safe space. 🦋 Identify the Abuse: Educate yourself about the signs of domestic violence and narcissistic abuse. 🦋 Build Your Support System: Reach out to trusted friends, family, domestic violence advocate, therapist or domestic violence hotline. You ARE NOT alone! 🦋 Safety Plan: Create a well thought out safety plan for escape, including a safe place to go, trusted contacts, and important documents, medications etc. Empowering Yourself: ⭐️ Focus on Your Strengths: Remember your worth!

Hopefully, the influence of Saturn - a planet of authority, responsibility, and integrity, and wisdom - in a sign associated with compassion and tolerance, will give you (and others) pause for thought before speaking, because the T-square can definitely complicate the consequences of idle or malicious gossip. Mars, Chiron and the North Node in Aries, opposing the South Node in Libra, reminds you to \"Do unto others, as you would have them do unto you.\", and if you forget to follow this Golden Rule, you will accrue karmic lessons. The T-square brings shadowy things to light today, which may increase your awareness of people's true character and motivations. If someone says something hurtful, but later tells you they didn't mean it, they probably did mean it - but Neptune in Pisces engaging in a Minor Grand Trine with Uranus, Venus, Jupiter in Taurus, the sun in Gemini, and Pluto retrograde in Aquarius inclines you to bestow a second chance in the belief that people can, and sometimes do, change. The best way to protect yourself from being the subject of discussion now is to insert yourself in the group. #astrology #horoscope #moontransit\n\nChoose Your Foundation Imagine standing next to the sea as waves crash at your feet, storm clouds swallow the sky, and the wind whips your face. You know you need shelter—and that’s when you see a small hut nestled in the sand nearby, and one further away that’s firmly built into a rocky hill. Which shelter would you choose to take cover in? 2,000 years ago, when Jesus walked this earth, He often told stories to the crowds that gathered around to hear Him teach. One day, He said to them: “Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock. Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won’t collapse because it is built on bedrock.” ‭‭ Matthew‬ ‭7:24-25‬ ‭NLT‬‬ As was His way, Jesus used real-life examples to help explain spiritual truths: “But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn’t obey it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand. When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will collapse with a mighty crash.” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭7:26-27‬ ‭NLT‬‬ We are all building our lives on something. Every decision we make reinforces what we believe our support system to be. So when life’s storms come, will the thing you’ve built your life on support you—or cause you to crumble? Jesus’ teachings have remained reliable and steadfast through social upheaval, the rise and fall of government regimes, and generations of historic change. No matter what has happened—God’s Word still stands firm. Teachings from the world, on the other hand, tend to shift with each generation. Like shifting sand, what current culture provides is usually unstable because its values are constantly changing. Storms are inevitable and challenges will come, but you get to choose your foundation. You can choose to make Jesus the one thing you build your life upon, or you can choose whatever habit, idea, or desire feels good and accessible in the moment. Today, what will you build your life upon?"
