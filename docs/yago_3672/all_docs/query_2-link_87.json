Click here.\n\nMerrywood\n\nAOL founder Steve Case is selling the Merrywood estate in McLean, Virginia for $49.5 million, which makes it far and away the most expensive home for sale in the DC area.\n\nCase and his wife purchased the 23,000 square-foot estate, which sits on seven acres along the Potomac River, for $24.5 million in 2005. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the news of the home hitting the market, noting that Case and his wife are selling to spend more time at their farm in Warrenton, Virginia and because they recently purchased an apartment in DC.\n\nThe nine-bedroom estate has the trappings that one would expect of a house that carries a price tag just south of $50 million. There are formal gardens, an outdoor swimming pool and an indoor lap pool, a tennis court, a wine cellar and a gym. An elevator goes to all four levels of the home. The master suite has two dressing rooms, a study and an exercise room.\n\nCase is not the only bold-faced name to have called Merrywood home. Jackie Kennedy lived at Merrywood as a child after her mother married Standard Oil heir Hugh D. Auchincloss Jr. who owned the estate in the mid 20th century.\n\nMerrywood is co-listed by Mark Lowham of TTR Sotheby’s International Realty and Juliana May of JLL.\n\nloading..."
