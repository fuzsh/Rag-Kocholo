        "text": "Chairman and CEO, Revolution LLC\n\nCo-Founder, America Online\n\nChairman, UP Global\n\nChairman, The Case Foundation\n\nSteve Case is one of America’s best-known and most accomplished entrepreneurs and philanthropists, and a pioneer in making the Internet part of everyday life. As chairman and CEO of Revolution, a Washington, D.C.-based investment firm he co-founded in 2005, Steve partners with visionary entrepreneurs to build significant, ‘built to last’ businesses. Revolution entities – including the Revolution Growth and Revolution Ventures funds – have jointly backed more than 30 companies, including Sweetgreen, Revolution Foods, RunKeeper, Echo360, and Framebridge.\n\nSteve’s entrepreneurial career began in 1985 when he co-founded America Online (AOL). AOL was the first Internet company to go public and among the best performing stocks of the 1990s, delivering a 11,616% return to shareholders. At its peak, nearly half of Internet users in the United States used AOL.\n\nSteve’s passion for helping entrepreneurs remains his driving force. He was the founding chair of the Startup America Partnership– an effort launched at the White House to accelerate high-growth entrepreneurship throughout the nation. In 2013, the Startup America Partnership joined forces with Startup Weekend to create UP Global, which Steve now chairs. He is also a member of the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship."
