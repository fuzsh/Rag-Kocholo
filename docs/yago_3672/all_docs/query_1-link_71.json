        "text": "Steve Case\n\nInducted 2008\n\nSteve Case Chairman and CEO, Revolution Co-Founder, America Online Chairman, The Case Foundation\n\nSteve Case launched Revolution, a company that seeks to drive transformative change by shifting power to consumers, in April of 2005. Revolution’s mission is to partner with entrepreneurs in building businesses that give people more choice, control and convenience in important areas of their lives.\n\nRevolution’s current activities are focused on companies in the health, financial, resort, wellness and digital sectors. Prior to starting Revolution, Steve was the Chair and CEO of America Online, Inc., and later, the Chairman of AOL Time Warner. As the co-Founder of AOL, Steve played an integral role in building the world’s largest Internet company and helped transform how people communicate, learn and conduct business. AOL brought millions of Americans their first connection to the Internet and drove worldwide adoption of a medium that has become more valuable than the telephone or television.\n\nSteve also ensured that AOL led the industry on issues like making the Internet a safe place for children, bridging the “digital divide,” and investing in online philanthropy.\n\nSteve is currently Chairman of two non-profit organizations, the Case Foundation, a private family foundation he established in 1997 with his wife Jean and Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure (ABC2), an entrepreneurial approach to funding brain cancer research that he founded in 2001 with his late brother Dan.\n\nIn addition, Steve was a founding organizer of Business Strengthening America and has served as vice chair of the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy. He was also honored with the National Mentoring Partnership Leadership Award. Steve was born and raised in Hawaii, where he remains a leading advocate for combining respect for the islands’ native culture and environment with job creation and economic growth. He is a major investor in two Hawaii businesses — Grove Farm of Kauai and Maui Land & Pineapple — that are developing fresh operating models for the agriculture industry and sustainable communities for residents and visitors. Steve has resided in the Washington, DC area for the past two decades. Revolution’s headquarters are in downtown Washington."
