It had always been a bucket list item for us and it ended up being a fun, interesting, and inspiring journey. We visited a lot of places. Met a lot of people. Learned a lot. And I can confidently say that I’m more optimistic about America than when we kicked off our trip. Here are a few highlights from our time on the road.\n\n30 days, 7,667 miles and 26 states later, our #RVAcrossAmerica came to an end. Thank you to those of you who followed our journey…a journey that once again convinced me that it is possible—and imperative—for great cities across the country to rise up and meet the challenges of the future."
