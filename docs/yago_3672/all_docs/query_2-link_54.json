        "text": "A passionate believer in all things digital and the amazing potential of technology to change the world for the better, Jean Case has been profiled in a wide number of publications including the New York Times, CBS, CNN, FOX, the PBS NewsHour, MSNBC and CNBC for her writing and speaking about Be Fearless and her leadership in the impact investing movement. She focuses her efforts and those of the organizations she leads around many of the same entrepreneurial approaches she cultivated through her extensive private sector career. Under her leadership, the Case Foundation has been recognized for its innovative efforts to address significant social challenges, harnessing the best impulses of entrepreneurship, innovation, technology and collaboration to drive exponential impact. Out of this work, the Case Foundation has identified five principles that individuals and organizations can take to Be Fearless and bring about transformational change and she has spoken at hundreds of convenings inspiring leaders worldwide to incorporate the principles into their work. Her first book, “Be Fearless: 5 Principles for a Life of Breakthroughs and Purpose”, on the 5 Be Fearless principles with stories of those who embody the principles, was published in January 2019 by Simon & Schuster. That same month, it was named a national bestseller."
