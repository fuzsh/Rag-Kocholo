        "text": "Stephen M. Case, the Internet Age icon who built America Online Inc. (TWX ) and then plunged into one of the most disastrous mergers of the century with Time Warner Inc. (TWX ), certainly didn't walk away from the company unscathed. But if he suffers any lingering anxieties about initiating the deal with Gerald M. Levin that eventually caused the stock to lose $135 billion in market value, fear of failure isn't one of them. He gave up his position as chairman in May, 2003, amid much recrimination and no small amount of frustration and disappointment. Many thought that someone whose empire had so dramatically imploded would, or should, live in self-imposed exile for a while. But Case, then only 44, was wealthy enough and ambitious enough to think he could start anew.\n\nWithin days of his departure, Case began talking with his former chief of staff, Donn M. Davis, about putting together a venture that would keep him a safe distance from the world in which his failures were still all too evident. Now, nearly two years later, Case has unveiled to BusinessWeek the details of his new company, Revolution, which he will officially launch on Apr. 4. Revolution is a private holding company that Case is funding with $500 million of his estimated $825 million fortune and that will invest in health care, wellness, and resorts."
