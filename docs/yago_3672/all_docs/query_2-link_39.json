        "text": "Department of Physical Sciences Geology Faculty\n\nKevin Brewer Charles Carrigan Steve Case Max Reams Priscilla Skalac\n\nProf. Steve Case\n\nIntroduction\n\nProf. Steve Case is the most recent addition to the department, joining us in January 2008. He teaches courses in Astronomy and is the new director of Strickler Planetarium. He completed an M.A. in physics at the University of Mississippi where he worked as an NSF GK-8 fellow and as a member of the Center for Math and Science Education, developing a science curriculum for area elementary and middle school classrooms.\n\nHis interests include the historical and cultural aspects of the physical sciences. While at the University of Mississippi, he conducted research on the Millington-Barnard Instrument Collection, a collection of scientific intstruments assembled at that university before the Civil War. At Olivet, he brings his cross-disciplinary background to science instruction and planetarium show development. He also has experience as an operator of both analogue and digital planetarium systems.\n\nAs planetarium director, Steve is overseeing the complete refurbishment and update of Strickler Planetarium from a slide-based analogue projection system to a full dome digital system. These changes will greatly enhance the planetarium's capabilities and turn it into a powerful multimedia instructional tool.\n\nSteve and his wife Christine have twin boys, Jack and Baylor.\n\nProfessional Societies:\n\nAmerican Association of Physics Teachers\n\nGreat Lakes Planetarium Association\n\nInternational Planetarium Society\n\nHistory of Science Society"
