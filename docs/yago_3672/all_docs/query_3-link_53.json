        "text": "Introduction\n\nFor a principle that plays such a central role in U.S. foreign relations law, international comity is surrounded by a surprising amount of confu­sion. The doctrines of American law that mediate the relationship be­tween the U.S. legal system and those of other nations are nearly all man­ifestations of international comity. Comity has long served as the basis for the conflict of laws and the enforcement of foreign judgments in the United States. Today, American courts also use international comity to restrain the reach of domestic law. The Supreme Court has repeatedly characterized foreign sovereign immunity as a “gesture of comity” and, conversely, has used comity to explain why foreign govern­ments should be allowed to bring suit as plaintiffs in American courts. The act of state doctrine was once said to rest on “the highest considerations of interna­tional comity and expediency.” The Supreme Court has looked to inter­national comity to reinforce constitutional due process limitations on per­sonal jurisdiction. The Court has also told district courts to engage in a comity analysis when considering the discovery of evidence abroad for use in U.S. courts and the discovery of evidence in the United States for use in foreign courts. Lower federal courts have used “international comity” as an abstention doctrine to defer to parallel proceedings in foreign courts, and alternatively to decide whether to enjoin the parties from continuing such proceedings. American law is full of international comity doctrines.\n\nYet courts and commentators repeatedly confess that they do not re­ally understand what international comity means. Courts complain that comity “has never been well-defined.” They frequently refer to it as “vague” or “elusive.” One court recently observed that “[a]lthough comity eludes a precise definition, its importance in our globalized econ­omy cannot be overstated.” Scholars echo these complaints. They also point out that “courts appear to have little understanding of what exactly comity consists,” or at a minimum that courts are “not always clear or consistent.” As Trey Childress has noted, because there is “no clear ana­lytical framework” for exercising international comity, “courts have been left to cobble together their own approach.”\n\nConfusion also surrounds the relationship between international com­ity and international law. Although doctrines of international comity some­times overlap with rules of international law, the comity doctrines are do­mestic law and are generally not required by international law. For ex­ample, no rule of customary international law requires the United States to recognize the judgment of a foreign court, to treat a foreign act of state as valid, or to allow foreign governments to bring suit as plain­tiffs in U.S. courts. And yet the Supreme Court often seems to treat interna­tional comity and international law as interchangeable.\n\nPart of the problem is the Supreme Court’s 1895 definition of com­ity in Hilton v. Guyot, which courts often take as their point of departure:\n\n“Comity,” in the legal sense, is neither a matter of absolute ob­ligation, on the one hand, nor of mere courtesy and good will, upon the other. But it is the recognition which one nation al­lows within its territory to the legislative, executive, or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens, or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws.\n\nThis definition of comity is both incomplete and ambiguous. Speaking only of “recognition,” Hilton fails to capture doctrines that restrain the application of U.S. law and the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. Speaking only of “acts,” this definition leaves out foreign sovereign immunity and a for­eign state’s privilege of bringing suit in U.S. courts, both of which the Supreme Court had recognized as manifestations of international comity well before Hilton was decided. Hilton is also fundamentally ambiguous about whether comity binds U.S. courts and, if so, whether it binds them as a matter of international or domestic law. If comity is “neither a matter of absolute obligation . . . nor of mere courtesy and good will,” what is it? Is there an “international duty” to extend comity, or is it simply a question of “convenience”? As a recent commentator has observed, Hilton’s definition of comity is “woefully inadequate.”\n\nThe supposedly indeterminate nature of comity has long made it an object of criticism. Judge Cardozo called comity a “misleading word” that “has been fertile in suggesting a discretion unregulated by general prin­ciples.” Comity’s connection to foreign relations has led some to con­clude that international comity determinations would be better made by the executive branch than by courts. Yet this suggestion raises problems of its own. Many judges resist the notion that the Executive should be able to dictate results in particular cases. And even the executive branch has concluded, in the context of foreign state immunity, that case-by-case discretion does not help U.S. foreign relations.\n\nIt is something of an embarrassment for U.S. foreign relations law that so many of its doctrines depend on a principle that is poorly defined and arguably leads to unbounded discretion either by the courts or by the executive branch. Michael Ramsey has argued that because “the phrase ‘international comity’ adds nothing—and obscures much—in judicial discourse,” it “should be abandoned.” This Article takes a different ap­proach. It aims to rescue international comity from disrepute and sup­port its critical role in U.S. foreign relations law by providing a clearer view of both the underlying principle and its manifestations in American law.\n\nMore specifically, this Article makes three contributions to under­standing international comity in American law. First, it offers a clearer and more comprehensive definition of comity than Hilton v. Guyot, as well as a framework for analyzing international comity doctrines. It catalogues and categorizes the uses of international comity in American law, based on a reading of all the U.S. Supreme Court opinions mentioning “comity,” as well as a number of lower court decisions. This categorization shows that courts have used international comity to defer to foreign lawmakers, to foreign courts, and to foreign governments as litigants, and that interna­tional comity has operated in each category both as a principle of recog­nition and as a principle of restraint. The result is the first comprehen­sive account of international comity applied by U.S. courts.\n\nSecond, this Article explains the critical distinction between interna­tional law and international comity. International law binds the United States on the international plane, while international comity allows the United States to decide for itself how much recognition or restraint to give in deference to foreign government actors. In some areas of foreign relations law, like sovereign immunity and prescriptive jurisdiction, doc­trines of international comity are layered on top of rules of international law. In other areas, international comity does all of the work. Interna­tional comity thus describes an internationally oriented body of domestic law that is distinct from international law and yet critical to legal relations with other countries.\n\nThird, this Article uses its categorization of international comity doc­trines to challenge two enduring myths about comity: (1) that comity must be governed by standards rather than rules; and (2) that comity determi­nations are best left to the executive branch. The Article shows that courts frequently express doctrines of international comity as rules rather than standards, and that allowing courts to apply these doctrines without in­ter­ference by the executive branch promotes not just the rule of law but al­so U.S. foreign relations.\n\nThis Article’s definition of international comity is based on a reading of all the U.S. Supreme Court cases that use the word “comity” as well as a large number of lower court cases. This approach reflects the suppo­sition that courts using the term have the sense, however inchoate, that a common principle lies behind certain doctrines. Once the doctrines that seem to rest at least in part on international comity were identified, it became clear that each involved deference to foreign lawmakers, to for­eign courts, or to foreign governments as litigants. It also became clear that some doctrines worked to recognize foreign acts or actors and that some worked to restrain U.S. acts or actors. Based on this survey, this Article adopts a functional definition of international comity that captures its uses in American law today: International comity is deference to foreign gov­ernment actors that is not required by international law but is incorporated in domestic law.\n\nThis Article’s definition of international comity differs from Hilton’s in several respects. First, international comity is not just recognition but deference—a word that captures comity’s use both as a principle of recog­nition and as a principle of restraint. Second, international comity is not just deference to foreign acts; it is deference to foreign government actors, a phrase that captures the use of international comity with respect to a foreign court prior to judgment, as well as the use of international comity in relation to foreign governments as plaintiffs or defendants in U.S. courts. Third, international comity is not international law, though the uses of international comity have changed in relation to changes in inter­national law. And fourth, international comity is domestic law—that is to say, the principle of international comity is manifested in a number of dif­ferent domestic doctrines that U.S. courts are bound to follow.\n\nBeyond offering a definition of international comity, this Article cat­alogues and categorizes the uses of international comity in American law along two dimensions. Along one axis, it distinguishes the uses of inter­national comity based on the foreign government actor to whom defer­ence is given. Deference to foreign lawmakers constitutes “prescriptive comity,” deference to foreign tribunals is termed “adjudicative com­ity,” and deference to foreign governments as litigants is “sovereign par­ty comity.” Along the second axis, the Article distinguishes between the operation of comity as a “principle of recognition”—that is, as a means of recognizing foreign law, foreign judgments, and foreign sovereigns as litigants—and the operation of comity as a “principle of restraint”—that is, as a means of restraining the reach of American law, the jurisdiction of American courts, and, more specifically, the jurisdiction of American courts over foreign sovereign defendants. Each of the international comity doc­trines may be placed in one of the resulting boxes.\n\nTable 1\n\nSome of the doctrines included in the matrix above may not be rec­ognized immediately as manifestations of international comity. But each fits this Article’s definition‌—deference to foreign government actors that is not required by international law but is incorporated in domestic law—and Part II defends the inclusion of each. It is also important to note that some of the international comity doctrines rest partly on comity and partly on other bases. The modern presumption against extraterritoriality, for example, has two rationales: (1) “[i]t serves to protect against unintend­ed clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could re­sult in international discord;” and (2) it reflects the assumption that Congress is “‘primarily concerned with domestic conditions.’” Only the first of these justifications reflects international comity. The discussion below will note when a doctrine rests on more than one rationale.\n\nFinally, this categorization does not include the Charming Betsy canon of avoiding violations of international law, which others have classified among the comity doctrines. As Part III explains, international comity is not just distinct from international law—it is deference to foreign govern­ment actors that is not required by international law. When a court con­strues a federal statute to avoid conflict with international law under the Charming Betsy canon, it does not defer to a foreign government actor but rather to another body of law with a complex relationship to U.S. domes­tic law.\n\nCategorizing the international comity doctrines in this way reveals how each of them fits into a larger picture. For example, many of the doc­trines of adjudicative comity address the same basic question: When should a U.S. court defer to a foreign court’s resolution of a legal dispute? What changes is the time at which that question is asked—before a suit is filed in foreign court, while it is pending, or after the foreign court has ren­dered judgment. Categorizing the doctrines also facilitates comparisons within and across categories and raises new questions. Why, for example, has reciprocity been urged as a requirement for some of the comity doc­trines but not for others? Why are some comity doctrines state law, others both state and nonpreemptive federal law, and still others pre­emptive federal law?\n\nThis Article uses its categorization of international comity doctrines to challenge two enduring myths about comity: (1) that comity must be governed by standards rather than rules; and (2) that comity determina­tions are best left to the executive branch. The first myth goes back at least to the early nineteenth century. In his 1834 treatise on conflicts, Justice Joseph Story endorsed the view that “comity is, and ever must be uncertain” and “must necessarily depend on a variety of circumstances, which cannot be reduced to [sic] any certain rule.” This discretionary aspect of international comity has been responsible for much of the criti­cism that the doctrine has attracted over the years. But examining the full range of comity doctrines reveals that international comity can be—and often is—expressed in the form of rules rather than standards. In the area of sovereign party comity, the Supreme Court has adopted a rule that any government recognized by the United States, and not at war with it, may bring suit in U.S. courts, while the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) sets forth rules to determine when foreign states may be sued in federal and state courts. In the areas of prescriptive and adjudicative comity, one finds a mix of rules and standards. The act of state doctrine operates as a rule rather than a standard, and the Supreme Court has rejected a case-by-case approach for restraining the extraterritorial reach of federal statutes. The Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws adopts a “most significant relationship” standard, subject to a number of pre­sumptive rules for recognizing foreign law. Adjudicative comity as a prin­ciple of recognition operates largely through nondiscretionary rules gov­erning the enforcement of foreign judgments, as well as a discretionary statute authorizing judicial assistance to foreign tribunals. It is only when adjudicative comity operates as a princi­ple of restraint through doctrines like forum non conveniens that international comity operates predomi­nantly through standards rather than rules.\n\nThe second myth challenged here is that the executive branch has great­er institutional competence to apply the comity doctrines. Eric Posner and Cass Sunstein have argued that courts should defer to the Executive in applying international comity doctrines because “the executive branch is in a better position to understand the benefits of foreign reciprocation or the likelihood and costs of retaliation than the judiciary.” Posner and Sunstein consider only a limited number of comity doctrines. When one considers the full range, one sees a number of doctrines under which def­erence to the Executive would seem utterly inappropriate: the conflict of laws, the enforcement of foreign judgments, forum non conveniens, anti­suit injunctions, and questions of foreign discovery, to name a few. To be sure, the executive branch has authority to determine certain facts on which some of the comity doctrines turn. The President has unreviewable authority to recognize foreign governments, and recognition in turn en­titles foreign governments to bring suit in U.S. courts. Executive branch agencies may also have authority to determine the geographic scope of statutes they administer. But as a general matter, the President does not have—and should not be given—authority to dispose of particular cases on foreign relations grounds. Such authority not only compromises judi­cial independence but also harms U.S. foreign relations by putting the Executive in the uncomfortable position of having to make decisions that may displease foreign governments.\n\nThis Article proceeds in four parts. Part I begins with a brief history of international comity, from its origins in the Netherlands, through its adoption by English common law, to its transmission to the United States. It also shows how the rationale for comity shifted from private interests in convenience to public interests in respecting the sovereignty of other na­tions, a shift that has obscured the comity basis of some doctrines. Part II discusses and categorizes the manifestations of international comity in American law, defending the inclusion of each doctrine and explaining why each of the categories represents a coherent group. Part III consid­ers the relationship between international comity and international law. The border between the two has shifted over time. Changes in interna­tional law have sometimes created new roles for international comity, and rules of international comity have sometimes evolved into rules of inter­national law. In some areas of foreign relations law today—like foreign sovereign immunity and prescriptive jurisdiction—one may think of an international law “core” and a comity “penumbra,” while in other areas all of the rules are rules of comity alone. Finally, Part IV challenges two of the leading comity myths: (1) that comity must be governed by standards rather than rules; and (2) that comity determinations are best left to the executive branch. Part IV shows that international comity doctrines are frequently expressed as rules rather than standards, and that allowing courts to apply these doctrines without inference by the executive branch promotes not just the rule of law but also U.S. foreign relations.\n\nI. A Brief History of International Comity\n\nTo understand the role of international comity in American law to­day, one must have some idea of where it came from and how it devel­oped. American notions of comity find their origin in the writings of the seventeenth-century Dutch jurist Ulrich Huber, whose approach was adopt­ed in turn by the influential English judge Lord Mansfield. In the United States, Joseph Story’s treatise on the conflict of laws made comity the foun­dation for recognizing foreign laws and judgments, but U.S. courts also looked to international comity as the basis for foreign sovereign immun­ity, the act of state doctrine, and the privilege of foreign governments to bring suit in the United States. During the first half of the twentieth cen­tury, as international law moved away from a strictly territorial view of jurisdiction, comity began to play new roles, restraining the reach of U.S. laws and the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. With these new roles came new justifications for comity, specifically public interests in sovereignty and fostering friendly relations with other nations, which ultimately eclipsed comity’s original rationale of commercial convenience serving private interests.\n\nA. From Huber to Mansfield\n\nThe history of international comity begins with the seventeenth-century Dutch jurist Ulrich Huber. After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, the world was understood to be divided into separate and independ­ent states whose territorial sovereignty was deemed to be exclusive and ab­solute. In this era of territorial states, comity was a way to explain how rights acquired under the laws of one nation could have effect within the territory of another. Both territorial sovereignty and respect for foreign rights were of particular concern in the Netherlands, which had recently won independence from Spain but whose status as a trading nation cre­ated a pressing need to treat foreigners fairly. Huber’s De Conflictu Legum set forth three maxims to address the problem of foreign rights in a world of exclusive territorial sovereignty:\n\n(1) The laws of each state have force within the limits of that government and bind all subject to it, but not beyond.\n\n(2) All persons within the limits of a government, whether they live there permanently or temporarily, are deemed to be subjects thereof.\n\n(3) Sovereigns will so act by way of comity that rights ac­quired within the limits of a government retain their force eve­rywhere so far as they do not cause prejudice to the power or rights of such government or of its subjects.\n\nHuber saw these maxims as part of the law of nations, but there were important differences between Huber’s first two maxims and his third. The first two stated the territorial view of sovereignty in the strong­est terms and permitted no discretion on the part of the sovereign, which could not regulate extraterritorially even to promote its most compelling interests. Huber’s third maxim was different in two ways. First, it did not state the strictly territorial view of sovereignty but rather tried to solve a prob­lem that territoriality created. Huber wrote that “nothing could be more inconvenient to commerce and to international usage than that transac­tions valid by the law of one place should be rendered of no effect else­where on account of a difference in the law.” Comity avoided that in­convenience. Second, Huber’s final maxim expressly permitted discre­tion by the sovereign, which could deny the effect of foreign law to the extent necessary to protect itself and its subjects. The discretion not to recognize foreign rights was captured in the word “comity.”\n\nScottish lawyers brought Huber’s ideas to Britain, where Lord Mansfield adopted them in his conflicts decisions. In Robinson v. Bland, Mansfield wrote that “the general rule established ex comitate et jure gentium is, that the place where the contract is made, and not where the action is brought, is to be considered in expounding and enforcing the contract.” In Holman v. Johnson, he added: “The doctrine Huberus lays down, is founded in good sense, and upon general principles of justice. I entirely agree with him.”\n\nB. American Beginnings\n\nComity came to America with the rest of English common law. Coun­sel cited Huber and courts relied on him. In 1797, Alexander Dallas even published a translation of Huber in the U.S. Reports. Riding circuit two years later, Justice Washington invoked Huber for the proposition that “by the courtesy of nations, to be inferred from their tacit consent, the laws which are executed within the limits of any government are per­mitted to operate everywhere, provided they do not produce injury to the rights of such other government or its citizens.” Justice Story, also on circuit, wrote that Huber’s doctrine “has become incorporated into the code of national law in all civilized countries.”\n\nStory’s 1834 treatise Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws cemented com­ity into the foundations of American conflicts law. Echoing Huber, Story began with three maxims: (1) “that every nation possesses an exclusive sovereignty and jurisdiction within its own territory;” (2) “that no state or nation can, by its laws, directly affect or bind property out of its own territory, or bind persons not resident therein;” and (3) “that whatever force and obligation the laws of one country have in another, depend sole­ly upon the laws and municipal regulations of the latter; that is to say, upon its own proper jurisprudence and polity, and upon its own express or tacit consent.” After paraphrasing and defending Huber, Story en­dor­sed comity as the basis for enforcing foreign law. The “‘comity of na­tions,’” he wrote, “is the most appropriate phrase to express the true founda­tion and extent of the obligation of the laws of one nation within the ter­ritories of another.” Like Huber, Story justified comity on the basis of “mutual convenience and utility.” Yet Story also thought that the terri­torial sovereign could trump other considerations and refuse to enforce foreign law: “No nation can . . . be required to sacrifice its own interests in favour of another; or to enforce doctrines which, in a moral or politi­cal view, are incompatible with its own safety or happiness, or conscien­tious regard to justice and duty.” In England and America, this discre­tion was exercised in the first instance by courts but subject always to leg­islative control. This comity, Story emphasized, was “not the comity of the courts, but the comity of the nation.”\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, American courts invoked comity re­peatedly as the basis for enforcing foreign laws—from those governing contracts, to those respecting the ownership of personal property, to those organizing corporations. “It is needless to enumerate here,” Chief Justice Taney wrote in Bank of Augusta v. Earle, “the instances in which, by the general practice of civilized countries, the laws of the one, will, by the comity of nations, be recognised and executed in another, where the right of individuals are concerned.” Comity also gave the states of the Union some room—though in the end not enough—to manage the issue of slav­ery. “By the general law of nations, no nation is bound to recognise the state of slavery, as to foreign slaves found within its territorial dominions, when it is in opposition to its own policy and institutions,” Justice Story wrote in Prigg v. Pennsylvania. “If it does it, it is as a matter of comity, and not as a matter of international right.”\n\nComity served not just as the basis for enforcing foreign laws in American courts, but also as the basis for recognizing foreign judg­ments, most famously in Hilton v. Guyot. Justice Gray began by restat­ing the traditional rule of strictly territorial sovereignty: “No law has any effect, of its own force, beyond the limits of the sovereignty from which its authority is derived.” Thus, the effect not just of an executive order or legislative act but also of a judicial decree “depends upon what our greatest jurists have been content to call ‘the comity of nations.’” Like Huber and Story, Gray noted the territorial sovereign’s discretion not to enforce foreign law against its own interests. Comity was “neither a mat­ter of absolute obligation, on the one hand, nor of mere courtesy and good will, upon the other.” Despite its slippery definition of comity, Hilton articulated clear rules for the enforcement of foreign judgments in the United States:\n\n[W]here there has been opportunity for a full and fair trial abroad before a court of competent jurisdiction, conducting the trial upon regular proceedings, after due citation or voluntary appearance of the defendant, and under a system of jurispru­dence likely to secure an impartial administration of justice be­tween the citizens of its own country and those of other coun­tries, and there is nothing to show either prejudice in the court, or in the system of laws under which it was sitting, or fraud in pro­curing the judgment, or any other special reason why the com­ity of this nation should not allow it full effect, the merits of the case should not, in an action brought in this country upon the judg­ment, be tried afresh . . . .\n\nThese rules were generally followed by state courts, and have been codified in two uniform state acts that govern the enforcement of most foreign judg­ments in the United States today.\n\nWhile comity was the basis for enforcing foreign laws and judgments in American courts during the nineteenth century, it also served to re­strain the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns. In The Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, Chief Justice Marshall held that a French warship was immune from suit by its former owners to recover it. The Schooner Exchange is sometimes read as applying international law, but Marshall treated the international rules governing immunity as defeasible by the United States. “The jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute,” Marshall wrote. Thus, any immunity of a foreign sovereign in the courts of the United States “must be traced up to the consent of the nation itself.” For “mutual benefit,” all na­tions had consented to treat the foreign sovereign himself, his foreign min­ister, and his military forces as immune from arrest or detention within their territories. But Marshall emphasized that the territorial sovereign was “capable of destroying this implication” and of “subjecting such ves­sels to the ordinary tribunals.”\n\nMarshall’s treatment of foreign sovereign immunity bears a striking resemblance to Huber and Story’s descriptions of comity. Each began with the assumption that sovereignty was strictly territorial, each made excep­tions based on “mutual benefit,” and each maintained the discre­tion of the territorial sovereign to deny such exceptions if it so chose. Although Chief Justice Marshall did not use the word “comity,” Justice Story, who joined the opinion in The Schooner Exchange, would write just a decade lat­er that the doctrine expounded in that case “stands upon principles of public comity and convenience.” In more recent times, the Supreme Court has consistently characterized foreign sovereign immunity as “a matter of grace and comity on the part of the United States.”\n\nBeginning in the nineteenth century, comity was also invoked to al­low a foreign sovereign to bring suit in U.S. courts. “To deny him this privilege,” the Supreme Court said in The Sapphire, “would manifest a want of comity and friendly feeling.” An earlier case allowing the Spanish King to bring suit had rested not on comity but on the reference in Article III of the Constitution to controversies involving foreign states. But by grounding the privilege in comity, the Court preserved the discretion of the United States to deny it, at least to foreign states that are at war with the United States or not recognized by it.\n\nThe act of state doctrine is another manifestation of international comity in American law. In Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., the Supreme Court said that the doctrine “rests at last upon the highest considerations of international comity and expediency. To permit the validity of the acts of one sovereign State to be reexamined and perhaps condemned by the courts of another would very certainly ‘imperil the amicable relations between governments and vex the peace of nations.’” Later cases have emphasized separation of powers as the basis for the act of state doc­trine. But this separation of powers rationale ultimately rests on comity, for it reflects “the strong sense of the Judicial Branch that its engagement in the task of passing on the validity of foreign acts of state may hinder rather than further this country’s pursuit of goals both for itself and for the community of nations as a whole in the international sphere.”\n\nC. New Roles\n\nIn most of the preceding examples, American courts used comity to address problems created by a strictly territorial view of sovereignty—how to explain the enforcement of a foreign law or judgment outside the for­eign state’s territory, or the decision not to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign inside the United States’ territory. As this territorial view of sovereignty weakened, however, comity came to play new roles in American law. In American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., the Supreme Court had to decide whether the Sherman Act reached anticompetitive conduct in another country. In the past, it would have answered that question by relying on rules of international law. But international law’s strictly territorial view of jurisdiction had faded by 1909, and so Justice Holmes adopted a territorial approach using comity instead:\n\nFor another jurisdiction, if it should happen to lay hold of the actor, to treat him according to its own notions rather than those of the place where he did the acts, not only would be unjust, but would be an interference with the authority of another sover­eign, contrary to the comity of nations, which the other state con­cerned justly might resent.\n\nDespite American Banana, U.S. courts soon began to apply U.S. anti­trust law extraterritorially on the basis of effects. Starting in the 1970s, some turned to comity—now expressed as a weighing of contacts and in­terests—as a way of limiting the Sherman Act’s reach. The question, the Ninth Circuit wrote in Timberlane, was “whether American authority should be asserted in a given case as a matter of international comity and fairness.” Section 403 of the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law adopted Timberlane’s interest balancing approach. But when the geographic scope of the Sherman Act again reached the Supreme Court in Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California, the Court refused to consider dismissal on grounds of “international comity” unless the conduct pro­hibited by U.S. law was required by foreign law. This provoked a strong dissent from Justice Scalia, who thought the case should have been dis­missed on the basis of “‘prescriptive comity’: the respect sovereign na­tions afford each other by limiting the reach of their laws.” Although Hartford was considered “a near death blow” for comity, just a decade later the Court looked to “principles of prescriptive comity” to limit the extraterritorial reach of American antitrust law in F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A.\n\nDevelopments in the area of adjudicative jurisdiction mirrored those in the area of prescriptive jurisdiction as America moved from the nine­teenth century to the twentieth. The Supreme Court had applied a strict­ly territorial approach to personal jurisdiction in Pennoyer v. Neff. But in the first half of the twentieth century, this territorial approach gave way to the more flexible framework of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, which required only “certain minimum contacts with [the forum] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” The expansion of personal jurisdiction cre­ated more opportunities for parallel proceedings, which American courts developed new tools to manage, like the doctrine of forum non conven­iens and (more questionably) the doctrines of prudential exhaustion and international comity abstention, each of which allows a district court to stay or dismiss a case over which it has personal jurisdiction. U.S. courts have also looked to comity when considering whether to enjoin par­allel proceedings in a foreign court. Recently, the Supreme Court has relied on “international comity” to reinforce limits on personal jurisdic­tion under the Due Process Clause itself. And finally, even when a U.S. court takes jurisdiction, comity has been deemed relevant to how that ju­risdiction is exercised with respect to matters such as the discovery of evi­dence abroad under the Hague Evidence Convention.\n\nD. New Justifications\n\nThe changing role of international comity—attributable to interna­tional law’s movement away from strict territoriality—led in turn to a shift in the justifications for comity. Until the turn of the twentieth century, a private rationale for comity predominated, most often expressed as com­mercial convenience. With the increased use of comity as a principle of restraint, however, more public rationales like respect for foreign sover­eignty and the fostering of friendly relations took over. The original reason for international comity was commercial convenience. Huber wrote that “nothing could be more inconvenient to commerce and to interna­tional usage than that transactions valid by the law of one place should be rendered of no effect elsewhere on account of a difference in the law.” Public interests found expression only as a justi­fication for not extending comity to foreign laws, because under Huber’s third maxim, one nation would enforce the laws of another only insofar “as they do not cause preju­dice to the power or rights of such govern­ment or of its subjects.”\n\nAmerican courts in the nineteenth century tended to follow Huber in this regard. They consistently cited “mutual convenience” as the basis for extending comity to foreign laws, subject to the proviso that “they do not produce injury to the rights of [the] government or its citizens.” Justice Story wrote in his treatise that “this comity of nations” was “found­ed upon the notion of mutual convenience and utility.” The justifica­tion for extending comity to foreign judgments was the same. Strik­ingly, the convenience rationale was adapted even to the seemly public doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity, which, the Court noted, “stands upon principles of public comity and convenience.” To be sure, the con­venience rationale for comity was not exclusive in the nineteenth cen­tury. In Bank of Augusta v. Earle, Chief Justice Taney declared that comity helped not just “to promote justice between individuals” but also “to pro­duce a friendly intercourse between the sovereignties to which they be­long.” But such references to the public interest in fos­tering friendly relations were rare during the nineteenth century, when the dominant rationale for comity was convenience, mostly conceived in terms of pri­vate interests.\n\nPublic interests began to play a larger role around the turn of the twentieth century. It was easy to justify comity as a principle of recogni­tion on grounds of convenience because both parties to a contract had an interest in having it be enforceable and, by extension, in the enforce­ability of judgments based on the contract. But comity as a principle of restraint was more difficult to explain in convenience terms. Exemption from extraterritorial legislation or adjudicative jurisdiction might be con­venient for the defendant, but hardly so for the plaintiff. Respect for for­eign sovereignty seemed a more natural fit. Thus, Justice Holmes in American Banana explained that to apply the Sherman Act extraterritori­ally “not only would be unjust, but would be an interference with the au­thority of another sovereign, contrary to the comity of nations, which the other state concerned justly might resent.” Since the start of the twenti­eth century, American courts have invoked the public interest rationale for comity in other areas of law too. In Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., the Supreme Court said that the act of state doctrine rests “upon the highest considerations of international comity and expediency” and that to ques­tion the validity of a foreign act of state “would very certainly ‘imperil the amicable relations between governments and vex the peace of nations.’” In sovereign party cases too, the interest in preserving relations with other nations and respecting foreign sovereignty came to the fore. The exception to this trend has been adjudicative jurisdiction, where courts seem to have moved away from respect for sovereignty towards greater consideration of private interests.\n\nThe shift from private to public rationales for comity—from conven­ience to sovereignty—had a number of consequences. First, it bolstered the use of comity as a principle of restraint. Commercial convenience could explain why a foreign contract or judgment should be enforced, but it did not explain why a nation should restrict its prescriptive or adju­dicative jurisdiction. As noted above, the notion that another nation might have an interest in seeing a particular dispute resolved under its law or in its courts, which American courts should respect out of comity, seemed a better fit for judges seeking to justify restraint.\n\nSecond, the shift from private to public obscured the basis in comity of certain doctrines that protect private interests, like forum non conven­iens. For example, Quackenbush v. Allstate Insurance Co. distinguished Burford abstention from forum non conveniens on the ground that ab­stention was concerned with “comity and federalism,” principles involv­ing “deference to the paramount interests of another sovereign,” where­as the doctrine of forum non conveniens reflected a broader range of considerations, “most notably the convenience to the parties.” Histori­cally, comity had a great deal to do with the convenience of the parties. But once comity came to be seen exclusively in terms of “deference to the paramount interests of another sovereign,” doctrines that consid­ered private interests were excluded almost by definition.\n\nFinally, the increasing reliance on maintaining friendly relations with foreign governments as a justification opened the door to arguments for increased deference to the executive branch on questions of interna­tional comity. Posner and Sunstein have argued that, because comity doc­trines are designed “to reduce tensions between the United States and other nations,” the Executive is in the best position to determine how they should apply. This is one of the international comity myths that Part IV will challenge.\n\nInternational comity has performed a variety of functions in American law. It has served as the basis for recognizing foreign laws, foreign judg­ments, and the privilege of foreign governments to bring suit in U.S. court. It has also served as the basis for restraining the application of American law, the jurisdiction of American courts, and, more specifically, the jurisdiction of American courts over foreign governments. Interna­tional law’s move away from strict territorial sovereignty in the early twen­tieth century strongly influenced the evolution of international comity in American courts. This not only led American courts to use comity in new ways but also shifted the dominant rationale for comity from private in­terests in convenience to public interests in sovereignty and fostering friendly relations. Having briefly surveyed the historical development of international comity, this Article now looks in greater detail at the uses of international comity in American law today.\n\nII. The Faces of Comity\n\nAs noted in the introduction, many doctrines of American law mani­fest the principle of international comity. If international comity is defer­ence to foreign government actors, then one may begin by dividing the comity doctrines into three categories based on the actors to whom def­erence is given: deference to foreign lawmakers is “prescriptive comity”; deference to foreign courts is “adjudicative comity”; and deference to foreign governments as litigants is “sovereign party comity.” Within each of these categories, one must further distinguish based upon the function of the doctrine. Does it operate as a “principle of recognition” to recog­nize foreign law, foreign courts, and foreign sovereigns as litigants? Or does it operate as a “principle of restraint” to limit the reach of American law, the jurisdiction of American courts, and, more specifically, the juris­diction of American courts over foreign sovereign defendants?\n\nA. Prescriptive Comity\n\nJustice Scalia coined the phrase “prescriptive comity” in his Hartford dissent, defining it as “the respect sovereign nations afford each other by limiting the reach of their laws.” The Supreme Court’s decision in Empagran employed “prescriptive comity” in the same sense, as a means “to avoid unreasonable interference with the sovereign authority of other nations.” As noted above, the Court first used international comity this way in American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co. to limit the extraterrito­rial application of the Sherman Act. For a country to treat a defendant “according to its own notions rather than those of the place where he did the acts,” Justice Holmes wrote, “not only would be unjust, but would be an interference with the authority of another sovereign, contrary to the comity of nations, which the other state concerned justly might resent.”\n\nThe label “prescriptive comity” also fits Huber’s and Story’s concep­tion of comity as the recognition of foreign law. The word “prescrip­tive” refers to “jurisdiction to prescribe”—that is, “to make [a state’s] law applicable to the activities, relations, or status of persons, or the interests of persons in things.” When one nation applies the laws of another in its courts, it recognizes that the other nation has jurisdiction to prescribe rules for the transaction or event. If that recognition occurs as a matter of comity, as has traditionally been the case with the conflict of laws in the United States, it may properly be deemed an exercise of “prescriptive comity.”\n\nSome writers have preferred “legislative comity,” but that phrase could describe either comity to legislatures or comity by legislatures. Pre­scriptive comity is comity to lawmakers—often legislatures, but sometimes courts or executive branch officials. Furthermore, prescriptive comity is exercised by courts. It is true that courts sometimes justify the extension of comity through assumptions about what the legislature would want. It is also true that legislatures sometimes speak directly to the recognition of foreign law or the extraterritorial reach of domestic law. But it is ultimately courts that interpret and apply these rules, sometimes relying on background principles of “prescriptive comity” to do so.\n\n1. As a Principle of Recognition. — As a principle of recognition, pre­scriptive comity operates in American law today through state-law rules on the conflict of laws, the federal act of state doctrine, and the practice of some courts to recognize extraterritorial acts of state on the basis of comity. States in the United States have adopted a variety of methodolo­gies for choosing the law to apply in a case that touches more than one jurisdiction. In a few states, conflicts rules are codified by statute, but in most they are judge-made common law. American courts generally ap­ply the same choice-of-law rules in interstate and international cases. In deciding conflicts cases today, U.S. courts rarely invoke comity directly. Instead, they simply apply the choice-of-law rules of the state in which they sit. But the origin of these rules in comity is clearly seen in the wide­spread adoption of a public policy exception. This exception is a direct descendant of Huber’s third maxim that a government should enforce foreign laws “so far as they do not cause prejudice to the power or rights of such government or of its subjects.”\n\nThe act of state doctrine provides another example of prescriptive comity operating as a principle of recognition. The doctrine is a rule of federal common law under which both federal and state courts must not question the validity of a foreign sovereign’s official act fully performed within its own territory. In an early case, the Supreme Court character­ized the doctrine as resting on “the highest considerations of interna­tional comity and expediency.” In contrast to state-law rules on the con­flict of laws, the act of state doctrine has no public policy exception. A U.S. court must recognize as valid a foreign act to which the doctrine applies, “[h]owever offensive to the public policy of this country and its constituent States [the act] may be.” This aspect of the doctrine has perhaps obscured its foundation in comity. In modern cases, the Supreme Court has said that the act of state doctrine “arises out of the basic rela­tionships between branches of government in a system of separation of powers.” One might characterize the act of state doctrine as one that rests in part on a basis other than comity. But in fact, the separation-of-powers rationale for the act of state doctrine has international comity at its heart, for it rests on the perceived need for respect to foreign govern­ments. Both by function and by rationale, therefore, the act of state doctrine is properly considered a manifestation of international comity.\n\nIn summary, prescriptive comity operates as a principle of recogni­tion in American law through state conflicts rules and the federal act of state doctrine. Both doctrines defer to foreign lawmakers by recognizing their authority to prescribe rules to govern a case before a U.S. court.\n\n2. As a Principle of Restraint. — Prescriptive comity operates as a principle of restraint in American law today mainly through the pre­sumption against extraterritoriality. As noted above, the modern pre­sumption against extraterritoriality rests on two rationales: (1) “[i]t serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord;” and (2) it reflects the assumption that Congress is “‘primarily concerned with do­mestic conditions.’” Only the first rationale reflects international com­ity. As previously noted, Justice Holmes turned to international com­ity to support the presumption against extraterritoriality in American Banana, reasoning that application of U.S. law to foreign conduct “would be an interference with the authority of another sovereign, contrary to the com­ity of nations, which the other state concerned justly might resent.” The second rationale—that Congress is primarily concerned with domes­tic conditions—first appeared in the Supreme Court’s 1949 decision in Foley Brothers as a reasonable assumption about the focus of congressional concern in most cases. In recent cases, the “domestic conditions” ra­tionale has predominated, but the Court leaned heavily on comity in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. to limit the federal-common-law cause of action for human rights violations under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), emphasizing that the “presumption ‘serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.’”\n\nU.S. courts have sometimes used other tools to restrain the reach of U.S. statutes. In Empagran, the Supreme Court invoked not the presump­tion against extraterritoriality but a principle of “constru[ing] ambiguous statutes to avoid unreasonable interference with the sovereign authority of other nations,” which Justice Breyer characterized as a “principle of prescriptive comity.” Lower courts have sometimes engaged in a case-by-case balancing of interests under section 403 of the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law. Although the Third Restatement took the position that such interest balancing was required by customary in­ternational law, lower courts adopting section 403 have generally char­acterized it as an exercise of comity. But the Supreme Court has spe­cifically rejected a case-by-case approach to extraterritoriality. Going forward, it seems likely that prescriptive comity will continue to operate as a principle of restraint in American law, but primarily through the pre­sumption against extraterritoriality, which the Supreme Court in Morrison instructed lower courts to apply “in all cases.”\n\nOccasionally, conduct prohibited by U.S. law may be required by for­eign law, in which case compliance with U.S. law may be excused under the doctrine of foreign state compulsion. In Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California, the Supreme Court acknowledged the possibility of declin­ing jurisdiction “under the principle of international comity” if the con­duct prohibited by U.S. antitrust law were required by the law of another nation, although the Court found no such conflict in Hartford. Lower courts applying the doctrine of foreign state compulsion in antitrust cases have noted its basis in comity. Lower courts have also required a comity analysis before ordering compliance with an injunction that would require violating foreign law. Sometimes, Congress itself writes a for­eign state compulsion defense into the text of a statute. In 1991, for ex­ample, Congress created an exception to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act for “a workplace in a foreign country if compliance with [Title VII] would cause such employer . . . to violate the law of the foreign country in which such workplace is located.” Properly understood, the foreign state compulsion defense rests on the expressed or presumed intent of the legislature, and its availability depends on the interpretation of the particular statute or rule at issue. Although recognition of foreign law is a prerequisite for foreign state compulsion, the doctrine operates as a principle of restraint because its effect is to limit the application of U.S. law that would otherwise govern.\n\nThus, prescriptive comity operates as a principle of restraint in American law chiefly through the presumption against extraterritoriality and the doc­trine of foreign state compulsion. These doctrines defer to foreign law­makers by limiting the reach of U.S. laws and thus protecting against possible conflicts with foreign law.\n\nB. Adjudicative Comity\n\nPrescriptive comity has an adjudicative counterpart—here called “adjudicative comity” —which may be defined as deference to foreign courts. As a principle of recognition, adjudicative comity operates in American law through the rules for recognizing foreign judgments and through judicial assistance to foreign courts with the discovery of evi­dence under 28 U.S.C. § 1782. As a principle of restraint, adjudicative comity operates through a multitude of doctrines that limit the exercise of U.S. courts’ jurisdiction, often with the aim of avoiding multiple proceedings.\n\nAlthough adjudicative comity arises in many different contexts, the basic question is often the same—whether to defer to a foreign tribunal’s resolution of a dispute. What changes is the time at which the question is asked. In the judgments context, the foreign tribunal has already made its decision. When a U.S. court is asked to decline jurisdiction in favor of a pending foreign proceeding (or alternatively to enjoin the parties from continuing such a proceeding), the foreign tribunal has taken jurisdic­tion but not yet issued a judgment. And when the court is asked to de­cline jurisdiction for lack of personal jurisdiction or on grounds of forum non conveniens, a foreign proceeding may not even have begun. These different ways of exercising adjudicative comity can best be viewed as parts of a larger whole.\n\nOthers have used the phrases “judicial comity” or “the comity of courts.” The problem with these phrases—and particularly with the latter—is that they are liable to be misunderstood as referring to comity by courts rather than comity to courts. All the international comity doc­trines discussed in this Article are exercised by courts. What distinguishes the doctrines in this section is that they manifest comity to foreign courts, whether by recognizing those courts’ judgments or by restraining the ju­risdiction of U.S. courts.\n\nSome responsibility for the terminological confusion must be laid at Justice Scalia’s door. In his Hartford dissent, Scalia referred to Justice Story’s distinction between the “comity of courts” and the “comity of na­tions.” The “comity of courts,” Scalia said, referred to doctrines “where­by judges decline to exercise jurisdiction over matters more appropri­ately adjudged elsewhere.” By contrast, the “comity of nations” (which Scalia equated with prescriptive comity) was “exercised by legislatures when they enact laws.” In fact, Justice Story meant nothing of the kind. In Story’s day, U.S. courts did not have authority to decline jurisdiction in favor of another tribunal. Story’s reference to the “comity of courts” was simply a rhetorical flourish to emphasize that courts exercise comity not on behalf of themselves but on behalf of their sovereign. For Story, there was no separate category called the “comity of courts.” All comity was the “comity of nations,” and all of it was exer­cised by courts.\n\n1. As a Principle of Recognition. — U.S. courts exercise adjudicative comity as a principle of recognition when they give effect to foreign judg­ments. U.S. courts have long invoked a “spirit of comity” to recog­nize foreign judgments at common law. Before Erie, the rules for recognizing foreign judgments were considered rules of general com­mon law. After Erie, it was generally assumed that the recognition of foreign judgments was governed by state rather than federal law. In a majority of states, these rules are codified for money judgments in two uniform acts. These acts generally follow the rules set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Hilton (minus the reciprocity requirement). As with the recognition of foreign law, Huber’s influence appears most clearly in the public policy exception, which permits a U.S. court to refuse re­cognition if the foreign judgment “is repugnant to the public policy of this state or of the United States.” State courts consider the uniform acts to be codifications of international comity, and they continue to recognize foreign judgments not covered by the acts as a matter of comity.\n\nFederal courts also exercise adjudicative comity as a principle of recognition when they assist foreign courts with the discovery of evidence in the United States. In 28 U.S.C. § 1782, Congress authorized district courts to order discovery “for use in a proceeding in a foreign or interna­tional tribunal.” The Supreme Court refused in Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. to impose a rule limiting assistance to evidence that would be discoverable under the foreign tribunal’s rules, but the Court noted that “comity and parity concerns may be important as touchstones for a district court’s exercise of discretion in particular cases.” Since Intel, lower courts have recognized international comity as the underlying basis of § 1782, and have declined to order discovery when doing so would interfere with the foreign proceedings. As a form of deference to a foreign tribunal, adjudicative comity under § 1782 operates as a principle of recognition, although quashing discovery when it would in­terfere with foreign proceedings also combines an element of restraint.\n\nIn short, adjudicative comity operates as a principle of recognition in American law through state law providing for the recognition of for­eign judgments and a federal statute authorizing district courts to help foreign courts with the discovery of evidence in the United States. Under these laws, U.S. courts defer to foreign courts by assisting in their resolu­tion of cases or by recognizing their judgments.\n\n2. As a Principle of Restraint. — As a principle of restraint, adjudica­tive comity finds expression in a number of doctrines. Many are designed to mitigate the possibility of parallel proceedings, which the Supreme Court’s expansion of personal jurisdiction in International Shoe made more likely.\n\nJust two years after International Shoe, in Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, the Supreme Court recognized the authority of a federal court to dismiss a suit over which it had jurisdiction on grounds of forum non conveniens. Under this doctrine, a court will first look to see if an adequate alterna­tive forum exists. If so, the court will weigh the private and public inter­ests to see if they are sufficient to overcome the “strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff’s choice of forum.” Although an early Supreme Court case applying the doctrine in admiralty had referred to “motives of convenience or international comity,” forum non conveniens generally has not been considered a comity doctrine. In fact, the Court has dis­tinguished forum non conveniens from comity in a domestic context on the ground that comity gives “deference to the paramount interests of another sovereign,” while forum non conveniens reflects a broader range of considerations like “convenience to the parties.” Historically, how­ever, comity had as much to do with private interests in convenience as with the public interests of other sovereigns. Because the doctrine of forum non conveniens allows U.S. courts to restrain their exercise of ju­risdiction in deference to foreign courts, it is properly considered a doc­trine of international comity.\n\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized “the virtually unflag­ging obligation of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them.” Forum non conveniens is an exception that applies “in certain narrow circumstances.” In the domestic context, a few other abstention doctrines exist. The Court has held that federal courts may stay their pro­ceedings in deference to other federal courts. The Court has also de­veloped specific doctrines for abstaining in favor of state courts and has permitted abstention in cases falling outside these doctrines in “excep­tional” circumstances. Finally, the Court has recognized that federal courts may decline to hear a case “where the relief being sought is equi­table in nature or otherwise discretionary,” like a declaratory judgment. With the possible exception of the last, however, none of these doctrines authorizes abstention in favor of foreign courts, and the Supreme Court has never done so except under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.\n\nNevertheless, lower courts have developed other comity doctrines to restrain adjudicative jurisdiction in international cases. The Seventh and Ninth Circuits have adopted a doctrine of “prudential exhaustion” for in­ternational law claims, requiring plaintiffs “to exhaust their local reme­dies in accordance with the principle of international comity.” The Ninth Circuit developed this doctrine in the context of human rights lit­igation under the Alien Tort Statute. Inspired by a footnote in the Supreme Court’s Sosa decision, the Ninth Circuit held “that in ATS cas­es where the United States ‘nexus’ is weak, courts should carefully con­sider the question of exhaustion, particularly—but not exclusively—with respect to claims that do not involve matters of ‘universal concern.’” A panel of the Ninth Circuit later applied the doctrine to an expropriation claim brought under the FSIA, though that decision was later vacated when the case was reheard en banc. The Seventh Circuit took up the prudential exhaustion baton in another FSIA expropriation case, basing its exhaustion requirement on “the comity between sovereign nations that lies close to the heart of most international law.” On appeal from the district court’s decision upon remand, the Seventh Circuit clarified that exhaustion was required not as a substantive requirement of the in­ternational law on expropriation but as a procedural limitation on where international law claims could be brought.\n\nA larger number of circuits have recognized a doctrine of abstention based on “international comity.” In most circuits, international comity abstention is simply an application to foreign proceedings of the federal–state abstention doctrine articulated in Colorado River, which requires a showing of “exceptional” circumstances after consideration of several factors. The circuits following Colorado River have held that internation­al comity abstention is appropriate only where parallel foreign proceed­ings are pending, and then only upon a showing of “exceptional” circumstances.\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit, however, has articulated a broader version of the doctrine, which—contrary to Colorado River—does not require a showing of exceptional circumstances but instead considers: “(1) a proper level of respect for the acts of our fellow sovereign nations—a rather vague concept referred to in American jurisprudence as interna­tional comity; (2) fairness to litigants; and (3) efficient use of scarce judi­cial resources.” In Ungaro-Benages v. Dresdner Bank AG, the Eleventh Circuit went further and upheld abstention on international comity grounds, despite the absence of parallel foreign proceedings, to support a foundation established by the United States and Germany to hear claims brought by victims of the Nazi regime. Most recently, in Mujica\n\nv. AirScan Inc., a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit dismissed state-law claims in a human rights suit filed against two U.S. corporations on grounds of international comity despite the absence of parallel foreign proceed­ings. The court applied the Eleventh Circuit’s test from Ungaro-Benages, engrafting onto it the reasonableness factors for prescriptive comity artic­ulated in section 403 of Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law and giving significant weight to the view of the U.S. executive branch that the case should be dismissed.\n\nSometimes, U.S. courts are asked to address the possibility of parallel foreign proceedings not by dismissing the U.S. suit but by enjoining the foreign proceeding. Courts in the United States are quite reluctant to do this, and frequently cite international comity as a reason to exercise re­straint. As the Second Circuit has observed, “principles of comity counsel that injunctions restraining foreign litigation be ‘used sparingly’ and ‘granted only with care and great restraint.’”\n\nInternational comity has even influenced some of the Supreme Court’s rulings on personal jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause. As a gen­eral matter, “[d]ue process limits on the State’s adjudicative authority principally protect the liberty of the nonresident defendant.” But the Court has recently relied expressly on “international comity” to support limits on general jurisdiction. In Daimler AG v. Bauman, the Supreme Court limited general jurisdiction to instances in which the defendant’s contacts with the forum state are so continuous and systematic as to ren­der it “‘essentially at home’” there. But the Court also faulted the Ninth Circuit for ignoring “the risks to international comity its expansive view of general jurisdiction posed.” Justice Ginsburg noted that general ju­risdiction under the Brussels I Regulation is limited to the place where the defendant is “domiciled” and that expansive U.S. views of general jurisdiction had impeded the negotiation of international agreements on jurisdiction and judgments. In light of all this, the Court concluded: “Considerations of international rapport thus reinforce our determina­tion that subjecting Daimler to the general jurisdiction of courts in California would not accord with the ‘fair play and substantial justice’ due process demands.” The Supreme Court has also looked to interna­tional comity to limit the exercise of specific jurisdiction under the head­ing of “reasonableness.” When determining whether an exercise of per­sonal jurisdiction is “reasonable” under the Due Process Clause, the Supreme Court has expressly required lower courts “to consider the pro­cedural and substantive policies of other nations whose interests are af­fected by the assertion of jurisdiction.”\n\nFinally, even when American courts have personal jurisdiction and decide to exercise it, they sometimes employ adjudicative comity as a principle of restraint to moderate that exercise. In the Aérospatiale case, for example, the Supreme Court had to decide whether to require first resort to the Hague Evidence Convention for the gathering of evidence abroad. The majority held that “the concept of international comity re­quires . . . particularized analysis of the respective interests of the foreign nation and the requesting nation.”\n\nIn summary, adjudicative comity operates in American law through limits on personal jurisdiction as well as doctrines like forum non con­veniens (and others of more doubtful status) that allow courts to dismiss cases over which they have jurisdiction. Adjudicative comity also limits district courts in granting antisuit injunctions and ordering the discovery of information located abroad. Each of these doctrines defers to foreign courts by restraining the exercise of U.S. courts’ jurisdiction.\n\nC. Sovereign Party Comity\n\nSovereign party comity is deference to foreign government actors as litigants in U.S. courts. Although it is generally omitted from scholarly discussions of international comity, the Supreme Court has articulated comity-based rules to determine when foreign governments may bring suit as plaintiffs in U.S. courts, and Congress has adopted comity-based rules to determine when sovereign immunity shields them from suit as defendants. As with prescriptive comity and adjudicative comity, sover­eign party comity operates in American law both as a principle of recog­nition and as a principle of restraint.\n\n1. As a Principle of Recognition. — The Supreme Court has held that “[u]nder principles of comity governing this country’s relations with other nations, sovereign states are allowed to sue in the courts of the United States.” The Court has recognized exceptions for countries at war with the United States or not recognized by the United States. But neither the existence of unfriendly relations nor even the severing of dip­lomatic relations will be sufficient to deny this privilege. As the Court restated the rule most recently, “governments recognized by the United States and at peace with us are entitled to access to our courts.”\n\n2. As a Principle of Restraint. — Sovereign party comity operates as a principle of restraint in American law through the doctrines of foreign state immunity and foreign official immunity, both of which fall under the more general heading of foreign sovereign immunity. The Supreme Court has consistently characterized foreign sovereign immunity as a matter of comity. The United States has codified the rules governing foreign state immunity in the FSIA, which provides that foreign states, as well as their agencies and instrumentalities, are immune from suit in both federal and state courts unless an exception to that immunity ap­plies. One might think of the FSIA as an exercise of international com­ity by Congress, but it is meant to be applied by the courts. Indeed, one of the principal reasons for the FSIA was to shift determinations of for­eign state immunity from the executive branch to the courts. In this sense, the FSIA is no different from state statutes governing the recogni­tion of foreign judgments, which similarly codify rules of international comity for courts to apply.\n\nThe FSIA did not codify the immunities of foreign officials. Rules for the immunities of diplomatic agents and consuls are set forth in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. But the immunities of other foreign govern­ment officials from suit in U.S. courts are otherwise governed by federal common law. Some foreign officials are immune from suit based on their status. Sitting heads of state, heads of government, and foreign min­isters are entitled to status-based immunity from suits based on any act—official or unofficial—but only while they hold those offices. Other foreign officials, as well as former foreign officials, may be entitled to conduct-based immunity. Conduct-based immunity differs from status-based immunity in two respects: (1) it extends only to suits based on offi­cial acts; and (2) it lasts even after the foreign official leaves office. Since the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Samantar, the executive branch has claimed authority to make determinations with respect to official immun­ity that are binding on the courts.\n\nThus, sovereign party comity operates in American law both as a principle of recognition and as a principle of restraint. As a principle of recognition, it allows foreign governments recognized by the United States, and not at war with it, to bring suit in U.S. courts. As a principle of re­straint, it shields foreign governments and foreign officials from certain kinds of suits in U.S. courts. In both of these aspects, sovereign party comity defers to foreign government actors as litigants in U.S. courts.\n\nD. Summary\n\nThis Article defines international comity as deference to foreign gov­ernment actors that is not required by international law but is incorpo­rated in domestic law. Part II has surveyed the variety of ways in which international comity has been incorporated into doctrines of U.S. domes­tic law and has categorized those doctrines based on the actors to whom deference is given. Doctrines that defer to foreign lawmakers, like the conflict of laws, the act of state doctrine, and the presumption against extraterritoriality, are manifestations of prescriptive comity. Doctrines that defer to foreign courts, like the recognition of foreign judgments, the doctrine of forum non conveniens, and the limits on personal juris­diction and discovery, are expressions of adjudicative comity. And doc­trines that defer to foreign government actors as litigants, like a foreign government’s privilege of bringing suit as a plaintiff and its immunity from suit as a defendant, are forms of sovereign party comity.\n\nIn each category, deference may take the form of recognition or re­straint. But the distinction should not be overstated. There is obviously an element of restraint in recognition and an element of recognition in restraint. When an American court recognizes a foreign judgment, it re­strains the exercise of its own authority to decide the merits of that case. When an American court enforces foreign law, it not only recognizes that a foreign state has jurisdiction to prescribe, but also restrains the pre­scriptive jurisdiction of the forum. Similarly, when an American court uses international comity as a principle of restraint, it is often because that court recognizes a foreign court as the more appropriate forum, a foreign lawmaker as a more appropriate source of rules, or a foreign gov­ernment as a sovereign coequal with the United States. Still, the prin­ciples of recognition and restraint seem useful for grouping the interna­tional comity doctrines within each category.\n\nHaving focused in Part II on how the principle of international com­ity is incorporated in U.S. domestic law, this Article now turns in Part III to consider comity’s relationship with international law.\n\nIII. International Comity and International Law\n\nThe relationship between international comity and international law is often misunderstood. Justice Scalia, in particular, seems to treat them as interchangeable. Justice Breyer has also sometimes asserted that a rule of prescriptive comity “reflects principles of customary international law.” But understanding the difference is critical to understanding how international comity works in American law.\n\nInternational law binds the United States on the international plane, and the United States is responsible to other states for violating it. On the domestic plane, it is generally accepted today that Congress may pass statutes that violate customary international law or U.S. treaty obliga­tions. But international law may bind the courts and the President. International comity, on the other hand, does not bind the United States on the international plane or give rise to international responsibility. The courts and Congress are free to fashion rules of international comity as they wish, and—assuming those rules give the executive branch discre­tion—the President is free to deny international comity in a particular case.\n\nFrom the beginning, international comity has been understood to be a matter for each nation’s discretion. Huber’s third maxim stated that a government would give effect to foreign laws within its territory only “so far as they do not cause prejudice to the power or rights of such govern­ment or of its subjects.” Story described comity as an “imperfect obliga­tion—like that of beneficence, humanity, and charity” and added that “[e]very nation must be the final judge for itself, not only of the nature and extent of the duty, but of the occasions on which its exercise may be justly demanded.” As noted above, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, some rules of the law of nations were understood to be optional and thus more akin to comity. But under the modern view of customary international law—“a general and consistent practice of states followed by them from a sense of legal obligation” —comity is excluded by definition. A rule that makes compliance discretionary can­not be followed from a sense of legal obligation.\n\nIn some areas of foreign relations law, rules of international comity are layered on top of rules of international law. Under customary inter­national law, for example, the United States may apply its law extraterri­torially only if it has a basis for jurisdiction to prescribe. But courts of­ten restrain the geographic scope of U.S. law beyond what international law requires by applying a presumption against extraterritoriality—a can­on of interpretation based in part on international comity and not re­quired by international law. The same is true for questions of foreign state immunity and foreign official immunity. International law requires some immunities, but domestic law is free to go beyond these mini­mum requirements and extend greater immunity as a matter of comity. In these areas it makes sense to think of an international law “core” and a comity “penumbra.”\n\nIn other areas, there is no international law core, and the rules me­diating the relationship of the U.S. legal system with other countries are entirely rules of international comity. No rule of customary interna­tional law requires the recognition of foreign law, the act of state doc­trine, or foreign state compulsion. Customary international law does not require the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. Many states exercise jurisdiction to adjudicate on bases that other states find exorbitant, but no customary international law rule prohibiting the exercise of such jurisdictional bases has emerged. And no rule of inter­national law requires one country to allow the government of another country to bring suit in its courts.\n\nIt is worth noting that the boundaries between international law and international comity may shift over time. The Supreme Court recognized in The Paquete Habana that “what originally may have rested in custom or comity, courtesy or concession” may “grow, by the general assent of civi­lized nations, into a settled rule of international law.” Some rules of foreign sovereign immunity may fit that description. It is also possible for international law to shrink and leave gaps for comity to fill. This is what happened with jurisdiction to prescribe. As the old, territorial con­ception of jurisdiction under international law receded, a comity-based presumption against extraterritoriality came forward to limit the territo­rial reach of American law.\n\nInternational law and international comity both mediate the rela­tionship between the U.S. legal system and other nations, but they are fundamentally different. International law binds the United States and gives rise to international responsibility. International comity is discre­tionary, allowing the United States to decide for itself how much recogni­tion or restraint to afford in deference to foreign government actors. Some have asserted that this discretion must be exercised on a case-by-case basis and that the executive branch is more competent to apply the doctrines of international comity. Part IV challenges both of these myths.\n\nIV. Two Myths of International Comity\n\nWith a proper definition of international comity and an understand­ing of the full range of American doctrines manifesting that principle, this Article now turns to examine critically some of the conventional wis­dom. Two assertions about international comity stand out: (1) that com­ity must be governed by standards rather than rules; and (2) that comity determinations are best left to the executive branch. The first has long made comity an object of criticism. The second has been strongly ad­vanced by Posner and Sunstein in recent scholarship.\n\nNeither myth withstands scrutiny. A review of the international com­ity doctrines in American law shows that many take the form of rules ra­ther than standards—from foreign sovereign immunity, to the act of state doctrine, to the presumption against extraterritoriality. Even when adju­dicative comity operates as a principle of restraint—the area in which international comity doctrines like forum non conveniens most frequent­ly take the form of standards—more rule-like alternatives exist.\n\nWith respect to the second myth, it is important to recognize that the proper role of the Executive depends on the comity doctrine at issue. No one would assert that the executive branch, rather than a court, should decide whether a foreign judgment should be recognized or whether a particular case should be dismissed on grounds of forum non conven­iens. On the other hand, the President clearly has constitutional author­ity to determine particular facts—like recognition of a foreign govern­ment—on which some comity doctrines turn. Agency interpretations of the geographic scope of statutes should also be entitled to Chevron def­erence. Most problematic are international comity doctrines that would allow the Executive to dictate the outcome of particular cases, like the Bernstein exception to the act of state doctrine or the authority that the executive branch currently claims to make binding determinations with respect to the conduct-based immunity of foreign officials. Posner and Sunstein favor such deference, while this Article argues that it not only compromises judicial independence but also harms U.S. foreign rela­tions by putting the Executive in the uncomfortable position of having to make decisions that may displease foreign governments.\n\nA. Rules and Standards\n\nThe myth that rules of international comity are impossible goes back to Justice Story. In his 1834 treatise on conflicts, Story endorsed the view that “‘comity is, and ever must be uncertain’” and “‘must necessarily de­pend on a variety of circumstances, which cannot be reduced to [sic] any certain rule.’” It is precisely this discretionary aspect of comity that at­tracted the most criticism over the years. Even in Story’s day, Samuel Livermore called the comity of nations “a phrase, which is grating to the ear, when it proceeds from a court of justice.” Judge Cardozo wrote in Loucks v. Standard Oil Co. of New York that “[t]he misleading word ‘comity’ has been responsible for much of the trouble” in denying the enforcement of foreign law. “It has been fertile in suggesting a discretion unregu­lated by general principles.” Similarly, Joseph Beale observed that “[t]he doctrine seems really to mean only that in certain cases the sovereign is not prevented by any principle of international law, but only by his own choice, from establishing any rule he pleases for the conflict of laws.” Modern courts and commentators have repeated the criticism.\n\nWhether any particular legal doctrine should take the form of a rule or a standard is a perennial question. Rules bind a court to decide a case in a particular way based upon a limited number of triggering facts, while standards invite a court to apply the background policy directly af­ter considering the full range of facts. The distinction between rules and standards is a continuum, not a divide, and many doctrines combine as­pects of rules and standards. But reviewing the doctrines of interna­tional comity shows that many of them are more rule-like than standard-like.\n\nTake the doctrines of sovereign party comity, for example. The Supreme Court has adopted a rule that any government recognized by the United States, and not at war with it, may bring suit in U.S. courts. This rule turns on two easily ascertainable facts. In Sabbatino, the Court expressly rejected an alternative standard of friendly relations: “This Court would hardly be competent to undertake assessments of varying degrees of friend­liness or its absence, and, lacking some definite touchstone for determi­nation, we are constrained to consider any relationship, short of war, with a recognized sovereign power as embracing the privilege of resorting to United States courts.”\n\nThe doctrine of foreign state immunity, codified in the FSIA, is also quite rule-like. The FSIA provides that “a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States” unless an enumerated exception to immunity applies. There are excep­tions for express waivers of immunity, suits based on a commercial activ­ity, expropriation in violation of international law, property in the United States, torts in the United States, agreements to arbitrate, and maritime liens, as well as for state-sponsored terrorism and counterclaims. Each directs the court to determine particular relevant facts. A court has no discretion to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the purposes of foreign state immunity would be served by its application. The same is largely true of foreign official immunity. Under the doctrine of head-of-state immunity, immunity from suit follows automatically from the execu­tive branch’s recognition of a particular person as a foreign head of state, head of government, or foreign minister. Conduct-based immunity is more complicated and still developing, but the courts of appeals have so far adopted rule-like approaches, with the Fourth Circuit holding that violations of jus cogens norms can never be “official acts,” and the Second Circuit holding that the only fact that matters is the State Department’s determination of immunity.\n\nIn the area of prescriptive comity, one finds both rules and stand­ards. Conflicts methodologies vary from state to state. Those that follow the first Restatement of Conflicts are fairly rule-like, while those that fol­low the Restatement (Second) partake more of standards. Although the Restatement (Second) adopts a “most significant relationship” stand­ard, it also articulates a number of presumptions that give the applica­tion of that standard a more rule-like quality. Thus, in personal injury suits, “the local law of the state where the injury occurred” generally ap­plies, while in contract suits, “[i]f the place of negotiating the contract and the place of performance are in the same state, the local law of that state will usu­ally be applied.” The discretion afforded under the public policy ex­ception may also make conflicts approaches seem like standards, but this discretion is cabined by the requirement that the forum’s public policy be a “strong” one. In sum, the conflict of laws in the United States today is governed by a mix of rules and standards. The federal act of state doc­trine, on the other hand, is quite rule-like. In Kirkpatrick, the Supreme Court expressly rejected a standard of embarrassment to for­eign governments and instead adopted a rule requiring courts not to question the validity as a rule of decision of a foreign sovereign’s official acts fully performed with­in its own territory.\n\nOn the restraint side of the ledger, some courts applying section 403 of the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law have determined the geographic scope of U.S. statutes on a case-by-case basis. Empagran’s presumption against unreasonable interference also has a standard-like quality, although the Court applied it in that case to generate clear rules about the applicability of the Sherman Act and expressly rejected case-by-case balancing. Foreign state compulsion similarly operates on a statute-by-statute basis, although its application may depend on the degree of compulsion and on the good faith of the party asking to be excused from U.S. law. But the predominant manifestation of prescriptive comity as a principle of restraint in American law today is the presumption against extraterritoriality, which operates as a rule. To be sure, the Supreme Court’s decision in Morrison makes clear that the presumption does not turn me­chanically on the location of the conduct but rather requires a court to determine the “‘focus’ of congressional concern.” Once that focus has been established and the territorial reach of a provision determined, how­ever, the geographic scope of the provision remains the same in each case.\n\nIn the area of adjudicative comity, the recognition of foreign judg­ments is governed in most states by two uniform acts that set forth rela­tively clear rules. Thus, the 2005 Uniform Act, for example, provides that “a court of this state shall recognize a foreign-country judgment to which this [act] applies,” subject to a list of enumerated exceptions. Some of those exceptions are mandatory. A court “may not” recognize a foreign judgment if “the judgment was rendered under a judicial system that does not provide . . . procedures compatible with . . . due process” or if the foreign court lacked personal or subject matter jurisdiction. Other exceptions are called discretionary. A court “need not” recognize a for­eign judgment if, for example, the defendant did not receive notice of the proceeding. But U.S. courts treat most of these “discretionary” grounds for nonrecognition as mandatory in practice. There is certain­ly an as­pect of discretion in the public policy exception, but that discre­tion is lim­ited by the Act’s requirement that the foreign judgment be “repugnant to the public policy of this state or of the United States,” a ra­ther high bar.\n\nJudicial assistance to foreign tribunals under § 1782, on the other hand, is clearly discretionary. The statute expressly says that a district court “may order” a person within its district to provide evidence. In Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., the Supreme Court refused to impose a rule limiting assistance to information that would be discovera­ble under the foreign tribunal’s rules and instead articulated a number of “factors” to guide the district court’s discretion.\n\nBut it is only when adjudicative comity is used as a principle of re­straint that standards clearly predominate over rules. Forum non conven­iens, prudential exhaustion, international comity abstention, and the grant­ing of antisuit injunctions all require a case-by-case weighing of fac­tors and are reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion. The same is true of for­eign discovery under Aérospatiale, which requires a “particular­ized analy­sis of the respective interests of the foreign nation and the re­questing nation.”\n\nThere is nothing inherent in this category of comity doctrines, how­ever, that precludes the adoption of rules. Certainly there is a rule-like quality to Daimler’s limitation of general jurisdiction to a forum where the de­fendant is “at home,” which generally means an individual’s domi­cile or a corporation’s place of incorporation or principal place of busi­ness. In Aérospatiale, Justice Blackmun argued in favor of a rule requiring first resort to the procedures of the Hague Evidence Convention, noting that “nothing inherent in the comity principle . . . requires case-by-case analy­sis.” And other countries moderate the jurisdiction of their courts with a doctrine of lis pendens that defers in rule-like fashion to the first court seized with jurisdiction. Simply put, the notion that comity “must nec­essarily depend on a variety of circumstances, which cannot be reduced to [sic] any certain rule,” is a myth.\n\nIn effectuating the purposes of international comity, rules have some advantages over standards. Many of the comity doctrines are justified on the basis of respecting foreign sovereignty and fostering friendly rela­tions. Rules further these interests by binding courts to defer to foreign government actors even when they might prefer not to do so. Discussing prescriptive comity as a principle of restraint in the Laker case, Judge Malcolm Wilkey observed:\n\nIf promotion of international comity is measured by the num­ber of times United States jurisdiction has been declined under the “reasonableness” interest balancing approach, then it has been a failure . . . . A pragmatic assessment of those decisions adopting an interest balancing approach indicates none where United States jurisdiction was declined when there was more than a de minimis United States interest . . . . When push comes to shove, the domestic forum is rarely unseated.\n\nRules may also have advantages with respect to comity’s other purpose of promoting commercial convenience. As a general matter, predictable rules better enable commercial parties to plan their affairs.\n\nBut in the private-interest context there may be other factors that cut in favor of standards. Courts may be more concerned with achieving fairness in cases that involve private parties. Rules may also be more easily gamed, and courts may therefore prefer standards that allow them to police abusive litigation tactics. It is perhaps for such reasons that one sees standards dominating adjudicative comity as a principle of restraint (e.g., forum non conveniens), while rules dominate in the area of sover­eign party comity.\n\nB. The Role of the Executive Branch\n\nA second myth of international comity is the notion that the execu­tive branch enjoys a comparative advantage in making comity determina­tions. Posner and Sunstein have argued that “there are strong reasons, rooted in constitutional understandings and institutional competence, to allow the executive branch to resolve issues of international comity.” Because of its expertise in foreign relations, “the executive branch is in a better position to understand the benefits of foreign reciprocation or the likelihood and costs of retaliation than the judiciary.” Posner and Sunstein, however, discuss only a limited number of international comity doctrines. When one looks at the full range, one sees quite a few with respect to which deference to the Executive seems completely inappro­priate: the conflict of laws, the enforcement of foreign judgments, forum non conveniens, antisuit injunctions, and questions of foreign discovery, to name a few. These doctrines undoubtedly implicate foreign relations, but they also fall within the core responsibility of the courts to manage their dockets and decide cases. With a number of these international comity doctrines, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the “determi­nation is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.” The Executive rarely intervenes in such comity cases, and even when it does so, its views appear to receive no deference.\n\nWith other comity doctrines, the question is more complicated, and it may be useful to draw some distinctions. As Curtis Bradley notes, “[s]ome forms of deference may be more defensible than others.” On the one hand, the executive branch plainly has authority to make some decisions that affect the application of international comity doctrines. The President may recognize a foreign government, for example, or an agency may interpret the geographic scope of a statute it administers. Such decisions tend to be made categorically, outside the context of liti­gation. On the other hand, one should be skeptical of doctrines that al­low the executive branch to dictate the outcomes of particular cases on foreign policy grounds. Such discretion invades the province of the judi­ciary and may harm, rather than advance, U.S. foreign relations.\n\nLeast problematic is the Executive’s authority to determine particu­lar facts on which some comity doctrines turn. For example, the President has unreviewable authority to recognize foreign govern­ments. The act of state doctrine applies only to “the public acts [of] a recognized for­eign sovereign power,” and the recognition of a foreign government by the Executive will bring its previous acts within the scope of that doc­trine. Recognition automatically confers the privilege of bringing suit in U.S. courts as a matter of comity, at least in the absence of a state of war with the United States. A strong case can be made that the President’s recognition should also control a foreign state’s entitle­ment to immunity under the FSIA. Lower courts have generally applied international law to decide if a defendant is a “foreign state” under the Act, but as the First Circuit has pointed out, this may not be the best approach. Under the FSIA, Congress has also given the State Department express authority to permit terrorism suits against foreign states by desig­nating them “state sponsor[s] of terrorism.” There is also nothing in­appropriate about having doctrines of status-based foreign official im­munity—like diplo­matic immunity and head-of-state immunity—turn on the President’s re­cognition of a foreign official’s status. In a sense, all of these doctrines defer to the executive branch. But they do so by at­taching legal conse­quences to an exercise of executive authority made outside the context of litigation, rather than by deferring to the Executive’s judgment about wheth­er any particular case should be dismissed. The Supreme Court captured the distinction in its 1938 Guaranty Trust deci­sion. The Executive’s “ac­tion in recognizing a foreign government and in receiving its diplomatic representatives is conclusive on all domestic courts,” the Court noted. But the courts “are free to draw for them­selves its legal consequences in litigations pending before them.”\n\nAnother common exercise of executive branch authority is for an agen­cy to interpret a statute it administers. Posner and Sunstein cor­rectly argue that courts should defer to agency interpretations of the geograph­ic scope of federal statutes. The reasons for this are the ordinary rea­sons for Chevron deference—that an ambiguous statute should gener­ally be read as a delegation of interpretative authority to an agency that ad­ministers it and that administrative agencies have special expertise with respect to statutory goals and how best to achieve them. But it is critical to emphasize that Chevron deference is deference to the interpretation of a stat­ute to be applied across a whole range of cases, and not deference with re­spect to how any particular case should be resolved.\n\nMuch more problematic is judicial deference to the Executive with re­spect to the outcomes of particular cases. Some international comity doc­trines have been interpreted to permit case-by-case discretion by the ex­ec­utive branch. The Second Circuit has held that the Executive may waive the act of state doctrine in a particular case under the so-called Bernstein exception.\n\nWith respect to foreign official immunity, the executive branch has claimed authority to make binding determinations since the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Samantar. For status-based immunities, this au­thority derives from the President’s recognition power and is uncontro­versial, but there is no “equivalent constitutional basis” for determina­tions of status-based immunity. Nevertheless, the Fourth Circuit gives State Department determinations of conduct-based immunity “substantial weight,” while the Second Circuit considers them absolutely binding.\n\nAs for foreign state immunity, the FSIA was passed in 1976 with the express purpose of shifting immunity determinations from the executive branch to the courts. In Republic of Austria v. Altmann, the Supreme Court refused to give any “special deference” to the Executive’s views about how the FSIA should be interpreted but suggested that “should the State Department choose to express its opinion on the implications of exercising jurisdiction over particular petitioners in connection with their alleged conduct, that opinion might well be entitled to deference as the con"
