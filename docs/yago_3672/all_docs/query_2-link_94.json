        "text": "Despite its name, SVB had branches across the country, developing relationships with founders and opening doors for those beyond the traditional demographic profile and #BeyondSiliconValley — people and places that historically haven't seen much funding. While Congress should investigate what happened and hold responsible parties accountable, we should also look to preserve what was unique about SVB. Big banks aren't set up to work with small startups. And at a moment when America's competitive edge is at risk, we can't let the unique role SVB played go unfilled. https://lnkd.in/gsgYY6zV\n\nErik Mitisek is a veteran of Startup Colorado (from the Startup America Partnership) and founder of Denver Startup Week, among a long list of accomplishments and initiatives. He likes to refer to himself as a career ecosystem builder. I first met Erik in 2002 when I invested in Denver-based Exclusive Resorts, one of the first \"sharing economy\" companies, where he was one of the key executives. He then spent much of a decade focused on building the Colorado startup ecosystem, including serving as Chief Innovation Officer for Governor Hickenlooper. Now, with his insurtech startup, Highwing, Erik seeks to streamline an old and high-barrier industry. Erik's close engagement in the Denver tech community has been invaluable during his entrepreneurial journey. His biggest takeaway: you get back what you put in. Erik believes this is part of the \"give first\" mentality that anchors those in the startup community. \"And it's not a one-for-one trade. It's a belief that if you're generous, generosity will cycle back. The ecosystem relationships are rocket ships that connect not just entrepreneurs to Denver, but Denver to the world.\" Read more stories of entrepreneurs and ecosystem builders like Erik who are committed to helping startup communities across the country rise in #RiseOfRestBook: https://rvltn.vc/ROTR\n\nCameron Johnson didn't always think of himself as an entrepreneur, but he had an entrepreneur's sensibility. After graduating from Harvard Business School, he joined one of the largest apartment managers in the nation. During his tenure, he noticed potential tenants frequently asked if they could rent the staged model apartment, furniture and all. Why? Because people hated moving, hated buying new furniture, and hated building it. That sparked an idea. Cameron's plan was to create a way for renters to add everything they needed to a space just like they added cable. His company, Nickson, would be in the \"everything business.\" The design and quality would be similar to what people bought themselves, it would all be affordable with a monthly fee, and the move-in experience would be as simple as walking in the front door. After testing the concept at a friend's family-owned property and simplifying the process through an app, Cameron decided to enter the Rise of the Rest Dallas tour pitch competition, which he won. He then won the Harvard Business School New Venture competition for the Midwest region. \"So those two things basically said, 'People think this is a good idea. So maybe it's a good idea.'\" The coming years would underscore the point, with Nickson growing rapidly. Read more about entrepreneurs like Cameron, the ideas they turned into companies, and the startup communities that embraced them in #RiseOfRestBook: https://rvltn.vc/ROTR\n\nJacob Hsu never imagined that he'd be living and working in Baltimore. He was a Silicon Valley guy through and through, an immigrant success story who had come from Taiwan as a child and was founding startups in San Mateo. But after visiting Baltimore in 2016 to learn more about a company described to him as \"Moneyball for software engineering,\" he thought again. Two months after visiting the city and investing in Catalyte, Jake looked around at the echo chamber of the Silicon Valley tech world and had a wakeup call: We couldn't keep growing our economy by leaving half the workforce behind. \"The pedigree bias had been exacerbating the opportunity gap, the wealth gap, and the skills gap. It was a self-perpetuating vicious cycle.\" Jake defined pedigree in the tech world as not just educational degrees, prior employment, upbringing, and contacts. At a more macro level it's the presumption that tech talent can only be found in California, Boston, and New York. He was determined to be a part of the solution, and within months he had relocated to Baltimore and stepped into the role of CEO at Catalyte. In 2018, Catalyte became one of Rise of the Rest's initial investments in our first $150 million seed fund. We saw the potential in the technology and use of AI, which would extend opportunities for those who were previously left out of the tech world. We were especially attracted to Catalyte's commitment to Baltimore and other postindustrial cities — one that's only grown since Jake's arrival and our initial investment. Read more of Jake's, Catalyte's, and Baltimore's story in #RiseOfRestBook: https://rvltn.vc/ROTR\n\nCourtney Caldwell, MBA and Dr. Tye Caldwell, DPB consider themselves far from your typical startup founders. When I interviewed Courtney for the book, she said as much: \"We are two married African Americans who have no technical background. We're in the middle of America. People say, 'Tech unicorns don't come from McKinney, Texas.' And we say, 'You wanna see?'\" Their entrepreneurial journey began when Tye, a beauty industry veteran, got a call from a hair stylist who needed to be closer to clientele. When the stylist asked to rent a station at Tye's salon by the day, he and Courtney thought it was a fluke — until others started calling. That \"fluke\" snowballed into demand in surrounding communities, gaining traction as a win-win for beauticians and salons. The appeal: stylists didn't have to sign long-term contracts, and salons could fill their empty chairs. They were in the early stages of developing a thriving marketplace they would officially launch in 2017; They called it ShearShare, Inc. The driving insight was that loyalty was between clients and stylists rather than clients and the names outside the brick-and-mortar marquis. Yet, in the process of connecting stylists and clients, ShearShare saved many small businesses whose vacancies were draining their capital. Today, the company they often refer to as \"HairBnB\" operates in more than 900 cities.

The competition's winner was Deepinder Singh's 75F, a Bloomington company with technology that regulates the temperature in commercial buildings, achieving both comfort and energy efficiency. Creating the temperature-regulating technology was a simple idea, but one that Deepinder found had a significant impact, particularly after learning commercial buildings were the fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Believing there was a larger climate mission, Deepinder and his team began designing comprehensive intelligent solutions for buildings. Deepinder has always loved the thrill of creating something new as a serial entrepreneur. But 75F struck a different chord with him, and the company has become a long-term, legacy-defining commitment — one he's scaling in Minnesota.

When building Cotopaxi — an impact-focused gear company — he considered Silicon Valley and Seattle for its headquarters but ultimately decided that Salt Lake City was the best fit. Why? The cost of living was lower, and it had a robust community of outdoor enthusiasts and a strong social undercurrent of doing good. He would soon discover that the startup community had knit together a substantial support network that rallied around the efforts of entrepreneurs. Cotopaxi was one of the first stops on our Salt Lake City tour. We later invested in the company, which has continued to grow and stay true to its \"Do Good\" creed.

Before she went on stage, an investor told her bluntly, “You won’t win. You’re older, you’re a woman, and you’re from Broward County.” She was determined to prove him wrong, and she did by winning. The following year when Rise of the Rest came to town, she was encouraged to enter our pitch competition. And after Lil won, she became even more dedicated to giving back to the Miami ecosystem. Read Lil’s story — and those of entrepreneurs building startups and defying odds across the country — in #RiseOfRestBook: https://rvltn.vc/ROTR"
