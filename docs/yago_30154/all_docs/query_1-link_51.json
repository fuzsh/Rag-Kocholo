        "text": "Update, 2/23/22: After a week in the hospital, Princess Yoko was discharged, according to the Imperial Household Agency. A member of the palace's household staff also tested positive with COVID last week, but no other positive infections are known at this time.\n\nOriginal, 2/11/22: Princess Yoko of Mikasa has been hospitalized after testing positive for COVID-19, the Imperial Household Agency said earlier this week. Her sister, Princess Akiko, 40, tested negative, even though the two spent time together before Princess Yoko's positive test.\n\nPrincess Yoko was first admitted to a hospital inside the Imperial Palace but has since been transferred to the University of Tokyo Hospital. The Imperial Household Agency also shared that the princess has developed pneumonia.\n\nJapan is currently experiencing a \"sixth wave\" of COVID infections, with the highly contagious omicron variant spreading rapidly. However, this is the first case of COVID for the Japanese royal family. Notably, Princess Yoko participated in a ceremony to commemorate a late emperor on January 30, but so far no other royal family members or staff have tested positive.\n\nPrincess Yoko, 38, is the younger daughter of the late Prince Tomohito of Mikasa. Prince Tomohito passed away in 2012 at the age of 66; he was a first cousin of Emperor Akihito and previously sixth in line to the Japanese Throne.\n\nThere are currently 17 members of Japan's Imperial Family; upon marriage, imperial princesses and princesses lose their titles. Most recently, Princess Mako, the eldest daughter of Crown Prince Akishino and Crown Princess Kiko and the niece of Emperor Naruhito, gave up her royal title to marry commoner Kei Komuro and moved to New York City."
