        "text": "TOKYO: Princess Yuriko, the oldest living member of the Japanese Imperial Family and aunt of Emperor Emeritus Akihito, the father of Emperor Naruhito, turned 99 on Saturday.\n\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the princess, who is the widow of the late Prince Mikasa, leads a quiet life at her home in Tokyo’s Minato Ward.\n\nIn March last year, the princess spent four days in hospital after being diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She has since had no major health issues, according to the agency.\n\nThe princess exercises, mostly doing stretches, for around 30 minutes each morning. When the weather is good, she spends time in her garden enjoying the sun or exploring the premises in a wheelchair.\n\nHer daily routine involves reading several newspapers and magazines. She is deeply concerned that many people are struggling amid the COVID-19 pandemic, agency officials said.\n\nThe princess also enjoys watching television, including news programs and baseball games.\n\nShe is looking forward to seeing her seven great-grandchildren grow up, the officials said.\n\nEvery month, Princess Yuriko visits a cemetery in Tokyo’s Bunkyo Ward on the monthly anniversary of the death of her husband, who died in 2016 at the age of 100.\n\nDuring the past year, the princess attended a coming-of-age celebration event for Princess Aiko, the only child of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, as well as the Imperial couple’s New Year’s reception.\n\nPrincess Yuriko is slated to attend a memorial ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the passing of her eldest son, Prince Tomohito, on Monday.\n\nJIJI Press"
