        "text": "Water: Water them in the morning when the media is dry. Ensure there is moisture in the media and keep them from drying up.\n\nLight: Ensure a good dose of indirect sunlight. Ideally the early morning light is advisable.\n\nTemperature: Warm to cool growing plants with temperature between 21°C to 38°C suitable for growth.Humidity: Maintain humidity level of 60% - 80%. Regular watering in plants helps maintain the humidity and encourage growth. Good air circulation is a must.\n\nFertilizer: fertilizing twice a week for both vegetative growth and flower with very less strength.\n\nNote: Never fertilize a plant that is completely dry, because this can cause major damage to the roots.\n\nPotting: Anthurium should be repotted in a pot with coarse mix which can hold moisture and can maintain humidity. Media should be as such so that water drains out properly and provides proper aeration.\n\n1. Open the box under the shade (cool area).\n\n2. Keep the plant for rest for at least 12 hrs.\n\n3. Clean the plant and wash them with fungicide solution and keep spraying the fungicides once in a week\n\n4. After 15 days you can start spraying fertilizer after every 10 days in growing season (summers) and after every 15 days in dormant season (winter)\n\n5. Repotting is preferred to be done in growing season\n\n6. Keep checking the growth of new roots which indicates the plants have successfully settled in your location."
