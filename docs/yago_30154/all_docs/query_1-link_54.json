        "text": "Prince Albert II of Monaco was spotted alongside Princess Akiko of Mikasa at the England vs Japan Rugby match at the weekend with his eight-year-old twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella.\n\nAlbert, 65, appeared to enjoy the rugby, despite cutting an otherwise lonely figure at the match. His wife, Princess Charlene, remained in South Africa, amid ongoing speculation regarding their marriage that Albert has vehemently denied.\n\nThe couple were expected to attend a ‘Learn to Swim’ charity event but only Princess Charlene, a former Olympic swimmer, was in attendance.\n\nIn 2021, the Princess went to South Africa to see her family and stayed there for 10 months, leaving her family in Monaco. The palace explained her absence saying she had a severe sinus infection following a sinus lift operation (a procedure recommended by dentists if a dental implant is required but jaw space is insufficient to accommodate it.) The sinus infection prevented her from flying home. It meant that the couple spent their tenth anniversary apart.\n\nIn an interview with Channel24 Charlene said, 'It's been a trying time for me. I miss my husband and children dearly.' She added: ‘Albert is my rock and strength and without his love and support I would not have been able to get through this painful time.’\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Akiko and Albert enjoyed light conversation during the rugby match before returning their focus to the sport.\n\nPrincess Akiko of Mikasa, a member of the Imperial House of Japan, wore a tweed blazer before changing into a Canterbury Japan home shirt, showing her support of her home team.\n\nShe is known for her academic achievements. She studied History at Gakushuin University in Tokyo before embarking on a postgraduate doctorate at the University of Oxford, focusing on the history of art. She was awarded a D.Phil from Oxford in 2011, making her the second member of the Imperial House of Japan to earn a PhD."
