        "text": "Vandas and other Orchids when possible will be sent in spike. While most often blooms arrive fine I can not guarantee flowers do to handing during shipping.\n\nWhen shipped USPS Priority Mail up to $50 is covered, if you purchase is of greater value and you want package insured please contact me.\n\nI am not responsible for plants or items lost, damaged or destroyed during shipping (including freezing or drying from cold or heat) by the post office or left outdoors after delivery.\n\nIf item is returned by P.O. or other carrier as unable to deliver you will need to pay new shipping to have item resent.\n\nUTMOST CARE WILL BE GIVEN IN PACKING. I CANNOT GUARANTEE SPIKES/BUDS/BLOOMS DURING SHIPPING.\n\nNO DISCOUNTS/REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN FOR BROKEN/LOST BLOOMS, BUDS OR SPIKES.\n\nBottom leaves may yellow during or soon after shipping due to stress of mailing, simply remove these older leaves.\n\nAll Vanda should be soaked well upon arriving to re-hydrate and soaked again the next day.\n\nCold weather warning!!! If you are or will be in next two weeks having below freezing temperatures consider not placing order or be aware the shipping may result in Cold Damage or plant death. Purchase HEAT Pack from Mad Happenings Store to be included when temp is in the 30s. Even with Heat Pack, the package can not be left outside after delivery. Temperature below 25 is too cold to ship, even with Heat Pack.\n\nPlants shipped during cold weather without heat packs that suffer damage or die will not be replaced.\n\nHot weather warning!!! If you are or will be having temperatures above 90 degrees it may place plants at risk of Heat Damage which I am not responsible for and will NOT refund or replace if damaged. Consider delaying order. Early morning deliveries much better than deliveries later in the day where package sits in delivery truck for hours in the heat.\n\nSteps to take to lessen weather related risk; Do not let package remain outside after delivery. Have held at Post Office for you to pick up.\n\nPlease review listing information and know what you are ordering. When selling more than one plant, photos are similar to plant you will receive. First photo is often of flowering or mature plant, additional pics are representative of plant(s) you will receive as described in written listing info.\n\nItems shipped are as described and unless you receive the wrong item, not as described or pictured should not be a reason to request refund. No refunds for changed mind, size, does not fit planned use, not what I expected.\n\nMust contact within one day of receiving with concern if you believe return or refund is warranted or other issue such as item missing.\n\nIf you do have an issue after receiving plant(s), please contact me to see what we can work out before giving negative feedback.\n\nI will work with you to accommodate reasonable request and resolve issues."
