These principles apply to private sector organisations who deal with information relating to individuals. This legislation is designed to protect personal information about individuals and sets in place a framework and guidelines about how to deal with this information. APP 1.3 requires an APP entity to have a clearly expressed and up-to-date APP privacy policy describing how it manages personal information. Further in February 2018, the Notifiable Data Breaches (“NDB”) Scheme was introduced under Part IIIC of the Act. The NDB establishes requirements and compliance mechanisms for entities in responding to data breaches.\n\nAs at 25 May 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) was introduced providing increased transparency for data protection for all businesses transferring data to the Europe Union. While the GDPR and the APP share some similarities, Red Fox Orchids is providing robust privacy policies and procedures for its staff and clients. This includes ensuring that it conforms to all required APP’s including the provision of a clearly expressed and readily available Privacy Policy. This is completed by the provision of this Privacy Policy Manual.\n\nAn APP privacy policy is a key tool for meeting APP 1’s requirements.\n\nTo assist with this compliance, Red Fox Orchids ensures that all of its staff members adhere to these policies and procedures. Any breaches of these policies and procedures must be reported to the relevant staff member’s manager or supervisor immediately so that any appropriate measures can be taken to mitigate any issues surrounding an identified breach.\n\nEvery staff member of Red Fox Orchids who handles personal information is required to have an understanding of the Australian Privacy Principles (APP’s), the Act and the GDPR, where necessary. Where a more detailed knowledge of Red Fox Orchids’ rights and responsibilities is required, the Privacy Officer will be able to provide assistance.\n\nAll staff are encouraged to discuss privacy issues with the nominated Privacy Officer.\n\nReview\n\nFormal review of this privacy policy shall be undertaken on a 6 monthly basis with the details of this review recorded by the Privacy Officer.\n\nAustralian Privacy Principles (APP’s)\n\nThe Privacy Act 1988 and the Credit Reporting Privacy Code 2014 places obligations and responsibilities on employers and employees to ensure that information collected from individuals is collected, retained and used in line with the APP’s. Red Fox Orchids shall abide by the following APP’s at all times:\n\nAPP No.\n\nPart 1 – Consideration of personal information privacy\n\nAPP 1 Open and transparent management of personal information\n\nAPP 2 Anonymity and pseudonymity\n\nPart 2 – Collection of personal information\n\nAPP 3 Collection of solicited personal information\n\nAPP 4 Dealing with unsolicited personal information\n\nAPP 5 Notification of the collection of personal information\n\nPart 3 – Dealing with personal information\n\nAPP 6 Use or disclosure of personal information\n\nAPP 7 Direct marketing\n\nAPP 8 Cross-border disclosure of personal information\n\nAPP 9 Adoption, use or disclosure of government related identifiers\n\nPart 4 – Integrity of personal information\n\nAPP 10 Quality of personal information\n\nAPP 11 Security of personal information\n\nPart 5 – Access to, and correction of, personal information\n\nAPP 12 Access to personal information\n\nAPP 13 Correction of personal information\n\nFurther information regarding the APP’s can be obtained from the office of the Australian Information Commissioner at www.oaic.gov.au.\n\nA copy of the APP’s as produced by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner is attached as Appendix A. The NDB forms part of the Act as a new implemented scheme for companies to advise its clients, in the event of a potential data breach that is likely to result in serious harm to any individuals whose personal information is involved in the breach. Red Fox Orchids’ Privacy Policy Manual provides a data breach preparation and response to any potential breaches to ensure compliance under the NDB and the Act.\n\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)\n\nUpon the implementation of the GDPR on 25 May 2018, Red Fox Orchids has updated the way they use and collect personal data from residents in the EU.

The data protection assessment will be required in instances whereby:\n\na systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person;\n\nprocessing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1) of the GDPR, or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10 of the GDPR; or\n\na systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.\n\nThe assessment shall be carried out in accordance with Article 35 (7) of the GDPR and carry out reviews of such data protection impact assessments when there is any change of the risk associated with the processing of personal information.\n\nAs a client of Red Fox Orchids and agreeing to Red Fox Orchids’ Terms and Conditions of Trade, which includes Red Fox Orchids’ privacy statement you hereby agree and consent to the provisions of this Privacy Policy Manual, including but not limited to the collection, processing, use and disclosure of your personal information.
