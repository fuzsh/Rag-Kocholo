If you were waiting patiently for a regal moment to share in your group text, the Japanese imperial family is ready to provide the latest in royal gossip.\n\nAccording to CNN, Japan’s Princess Mako and her fiancé, Kei Komuro, have postponed their engagement and now won’t be getting married until 2020. But unlike Princess Eugenie, who has to plan her wedding around her cousin Prince Harry’s many visits abroad, Princess Mako’s postponement is for purely personal reasons. The princess and her beau say they’re just not ready for marriage. “It is because of our immaturity and we just regret it,” the couple revealed in a statement.\n\nThe couple met at the International Christian University in Tokyo five years ago. The 26-year-olds were previously set to wed on November 4 but realized they didn’t have enough time to prepare for the traditional ceremony or their life together. Tabloids in Japan are saying the delay might also be due to lack of funds. Princess Mako’s grandparents are Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, and they’re both said to be comfortable with the decision."
