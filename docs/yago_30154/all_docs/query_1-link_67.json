        "text": "december 15, 2021\n\nA Statement by His Royal Highness The Prince of Shiganshina\n\nWe are still investigating the car accident of Ms. Selene Hendrix. Our investigation team has found that my father and HM The King of Eldia, Rod Reiss, were attempting to end Ms. Hendrix's life. Ms. Hendrix was silently bullied by these two during her stay at the palace simply because of her race.\n\nI'm extremely hurt to have found out these details surrounding her accident and couldn't help but think of my Mikasa, who is carrying our first child. If it weren't for my position, Mikasa and our unborn baby could have been in trouble and would have faced the same racist treatment from my father. I'm sorry I didn't act quickly as I should have in both situations. I'm extremely sorry to my brother who let me know that Ms. Hendrix was suffering. It completely flew over my head.\n\nWhether my father abdicates or not is up to him. I'd prefer he would. The monarchy is in need of something new. When I become king, I promise to make everything wrong right and make sure that anyone who steps foot on our property is treated fairly.\n\nThe Shiganshina Gazette\n\nfebruary 10, 2022\n\nPRINCE JEAN AND SELENE HENDRIX MAKE A FINAL APPEARANCE AT THE SHIGANSHINA DAY AFTER ABDICATION SCANDAL by Mylius Zeramuski\n\nPrince Jean, with his girlfriend Selene Hendrix, made his final appearance as a senior royal today after announcing his abdication. The two celebrated the 1,172nd anniversary of the retaking of the now fallen Wall Maria with the rest of the royal family.\n\nThe two were seated far away from the King, Prince Eren, Princess Mikasa (who is due very soon!), and Prince Zeke, who was recently bestowed a title after his youngest brother announced his departure. However, Prince Eren, Prince Zeke, and Princess Mikasa were seen hugging and talking with the couple at the end of the ceremony. The couple completely ignored King Grisha, who made attempts to speak with them.\n\nPRINCEANDPRINCESSOFSHIGANSHINA 13.8M followers\n\nview more on instagram\n\nliked by itsjojosiwa and 470,785 others\n\nprinceandprincessofshiganshina it's almost time! as much as i loved seeing mikasa pregnant, i'm so excited to meet our baby and the future of paradis ðŸ‘‘ - eren ðŸ“¸ by uncle jeanie-poo\n\nPrince Eren explained in a statement in December of 2021 after Hendrix's car accident that his father and King Rod were involved with the situation. Prince Jean didn't expand on this detail until he announced his abdication a month after. \"I'm doing this to protect the woman I love. I cannot live in an environment where my love isn't safe and protected. The people in my circle want her dead and I cannot sit here and allow that to happen.\"\n\nPrincess Mikasa seemingly has come out with her own response to the situation. In a statement, she mentions that she admires \"...Jean's bravery...\" and \"...wished Eren and she [I] stood up to the oppressive system around them [us].\"\n\nKing Grisha has yet to comment on these statements. It is believed that he may abdicate himself since polls have shown that his popularity has gone declined.\n\nThis may not be the last we see Selene and Prince Jean but we can't guarantee that they'll be around the royal family until Prince Eren is king.\n\nThe Daily Eldian\n\napril 17, 2022\n\nBREAKING NEWS: PRINCE JEAN AND SELENE HENDRIX ENGAGED by Romi Park\n\nYes, it's true! You're reading the headline correctly! Prince Jean and Selene are engaged. Selene announced the engagement on her Instagram this morning. This is the first time she's posted since Prince Jean abdicated.\n\nSelene and Prince Jean were seen in Hizuru just recently for a fashion show that Selene was modeling for. While in Hizuru, the couple was seen on multiple intimate outings which made their fans believe that they'd be getting married soon.\n\nSELHENDRX 260M followers\n\nview more on instagram\n\nliked by solangeknowles and 5,856,081 others\n\nselhendrx yes, today, tomorrow, always\n\nPrince Jean and Selene were first seen together in September 2021. Prince Jean would then issue a statement asking for respect for Selene. After this, Selene began performing engagements and was seen with members of the royal family until her car accident which put her in a coma. It has since been confirmed that King Grisha and King Rod of Eldia had played a role in the accident and they have both started their abdication process. Very soon we'll see their respective heirs become sovereign of their countries.\n\nThis news comes after the birth of Prince Eren and Princess Mikasa's baby girl, Princess Carla Miyako, who will become the first female monarch in years if the monarchy is still alive during her time. It is unclear if Prince Jean and Selene have met their niece but we're hoping for photos after their wedding!\n\nThe couple didn't reveal when the wedding will be or where it'll be but experts predict that they may get married at the Our Lady St. Ymir chapel where Princess June got married to King Grisha and the wedding may take place in the fall.\n\nPrincess Mikasa and Prince Eren released a joint statement congratulating the couple. \"We're extremely happy for Jean and Selene. We feel that Selene is the perfect match for Jean and as long as Jean is happy with her, we're happy for them. We wish them a lifetime of peace.\" Prince Zeke released his own statement. \"I'm very excited for my little brother and Ms. Selene. It's been wonderful to watch him grow into the man he is and it's been a delight getting to know Ms. Selene. It's even better seeing them happy together.\" There has been no statement from King Grisha but royals, politicians, and celebrities all over the world have wished the couple well.\n\nThe Paradis Mail\n\nseptember 19, 2022\n\nPRINCE JEAN AND SELENE HENDRIX MARRIED by Djel Sannes\n\nThis morning not only did Prince Jean and Selene become Mr. and Mrs. but they became the Duke and Duchess of Trost. Selene is also Princess Jean of Paradis.\n\nThe wedding was filled with gospel music from Selene's side and royal tradition from Jean. The duchess also paid tribute to Jean's mother by wearing a dress inspired by her and wearing her wearing her veil as her \"something old\". Like her mother-in-law, she did not wear a tiara to her wedding and changed the headpiece of the veil. The dress was a secret until the day of the ceremony.\n\nWhen Prince Jean saw his bride, he mouthed \"Wow\" and Duchess Selene was seen chuckling through her veil.\n\nThe bride's cultural roots were referenced throughout the ceremony via music and the preacher they hired for the wedding delivered a speech about the power of love and faith. The preacher's loud voice spooked most of the nobles who were used to soft-spoken, quiet ceremonies. \"This wedding is bringing everyone together. Everyone who loves you supports you and the nature of your relationship, which is why they're with you today.\" This was most likely a jab at former King Grisha, whose son, King Eren, sent away in exile.\n\nRoyals such as Historia, Princess of Eldia and her partner Lady Ymir, Connie, the Viscount of Ragako, and Prince Onyankopon of Teye were in attendance. Model and close friend to Selene, Porco Galliard came to support as well as movie star Reiner Braun and indie singer Annie Leonhart. Duke Levi and his husband, Erwin Smith and Duke Kenny came as plus ones to Queen Mikasa, the bride's maid of honor. King Eren and Prince Zeke stood by Prince Jean's side as his best men.\n\nCompared to his bride, Prince Jean seemed more nervous but the Duchess has been on stage more than once and knows how to carry herself. Queen Mikasa was beaming on the side as she watched the couple get married. She was one of the witnesses, along with her husband, of the marriage certificate signing.\n\nThe flowers the bride picked were Princess June's favorites, Remember-Me-Forevers. Duchess Selene and Prince Jean planted them months before the wedding. Myrtle was included in her bouquet since it is a royal tradition.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the Duke and Duchess stepped outside of the chapel and shared their first kiss as a married couple. They entered the Prince's black Jaguar XJ which the bride drove.\n\nHours later, the couple made another appearance on their way to the reception. Selene kept her headband and seemed to have removed the skirt of her dress. She then, again, drove the couple to the reception.\n\nAt the reception, Prince Zeke made a speech that moved his two younger brothers to tears. The new duchess also made a speech which is uncommon amongst royal brides.\n\nPrince Jean and his bride made history. The Duchess of Trost claimed her place in it.\n\nShe didn't want to look at the stick on the bathroom counter next to her. Two years of disappointment. There was nothing wrong with him- no. It was just the look on their faces when the sticks and doctors told them the answer they didn't want.\n\nThere's a light knock on the door. \"Selene...anything yet?\"\n\nSelene sighs softly and sits up on the toilet. \"I haven't looked,\" she admits. \"Can I come in?\" Jean asks. She doesn't give him an answer, so he lets himself in. Jean's eyes go from Selene to the stick and then back to his wife. Jean then kneels in front of her and places his hands on top of hers. \"You know, I'll still be here, regardless of what that piece of plastic says. I've been with you for almost four years now. What happened to you was not your fault. I will always love you. Kids or no kids,\" Jean says, attempting to reassure her. Selene takes a deep breath and nods. She picks up the stick and takes a look. The tears in her eyes begin to well up and Jean grips her thigh awaiting her response.\n\nSELHENDRX"
