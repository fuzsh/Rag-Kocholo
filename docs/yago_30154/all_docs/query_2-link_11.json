        "text": "The Imperial House of Japan (皇室 kōshitsu), also referred to as the Imperial Family and the Yamato dynasty, comprises those members of the extended family of the reigning Emperor of Japan who undertake official and public duties. Under the present Constitution of Japan, the emperor is the symbol of the state and unity of the people. Other members of the imperial family perform ceremonial and social duties, but have no role in the affairs of government. The duties as an emperor are passed down the line to children and their children's children and so on.\n\nThe Japanese monarchy is the oldest continuous hereditary monarchy in the world. The imperial house recognizes 125 monarchs beginning with the legendary Emperor Jimmu (traditionally dated to February 11, 660 BC) and continuing up to the current emperor, Akihito; see its family tree.\n\nHistorical evidence for the first 25 emperors is marginal by modern standards, but there is firm evidence for the hereditary line since Emperor Keitai ascended the throne 1500 years ago.\n\nCurrent members[]\n\nArticle 5 of the Imperial Household Law (皇室典範 Kōshitsu Tenpan?) defines the imperial family (皇族?) as the empress (皇后 kōgō?); the empress dowager (皇太后 kōtaigō?); the grand empress dowager (太皇太后 tai-kōtaigō?); Emperor's legitimate sons and legitimate grandsons in the legitimate male-line (親王 shinnō?) and their consorts (親王妃 shinnōhi?); Emperor's unmarried legitimate daughters and unmarried legitimate granddaughters in the legitimate male-line (内親王 naishinnō?); Emperor's other male descendants in the legitimate male-line (王 ō?) and their consorts (王妃 ōhi?); and the Emperor's other unmarried female descendants in the legitimate male-line (女王 joō?).[2] In English, shinnō and ō are both translated as \"prince\" as well as shinnōhi, naishinnō, ōhi and joō as \"princess\".\n\nAfter the removal of 11 collateral branches from the Imperial House in October 1947, the official membership of the imperial family has effectively been limited to the male line descendants of the Emperor Taishō, excluding females who married outside the imperial family and their descendants.\n\nThere are presently 21 members of the Imperial Family:\n\nThe Emperor was born at Tokyo Imperial Palace on 23 December 1933, the elder son and sixth child of the Emperor Shōwa and Empress Kōjun. He was married on 10 April 1959 to Michiko Shōda. Emperor Akihito succeeded his father as emperor on 7 January 1989.\n\nThe Empress, formerly Michiko Shōda, was born in Tokyo on 24 October 1934, the eldest daughter of Hidesaburo Shōda, president and honorary chairman of Nisshin Flour Milling Inc.\n\nThe Crown Prince, the eldest son of the Emperor and the Empress, was born in the Hospital of the Imperial Household in Tokyo on 23 February 1960. He became heir apparent upon his father's accession to the throne. Crown Prince Naruhito was married on 10 June 1993 to Masako Owada.\n\nThe Crown Princess was born on 9 December 1963, the daughter of Hisashi Owada, a former vice minister of foreign affairs and former permanent representative of Japan to the United Nations. The Crown Prince and Crown Princess have one daughter:\n\nThe Princess Toshi (born 1 December 2001)\n\nThe Prince Akishino, the Emperor's second son, was born on 11 November 1965. His childhood title was Prince Aya. He received the title Prince Akishino and permission to start a new branch of the imperial family upon his marriage to Kiko Kawashima on 29 June 1990.\n\nThe Princess Akishino was born on 11 September 1966, the daughter of Tatsuhiko Kawashima, professor of economics at Gakushuin University. Prince and Princess Akishino have two daughters and a son:\n\nPrincess Mako of Akishino (born 23 October 1991)\n\nPrincess Kako of Akishino (born 29 December 1994)\n\nPrince Hisahito of Akishino (born 6 September 2006)\n\nThe Prince Hitachi was born on 28 November 1935, the second son and seventh child of the Emperor Shōwa and Empress Kojun. His childhood title was Prince Yoshi. He received the title Prince Hitachi and permission to set up a new branch of the imperial family on 1 October 1961, the day after his wedding.\n\nThe Princess Hitachi was born on 19 July 1940, the daughter of former Count Yoshitaka Tsugaru. Prince and Princess Hitachi have no children.\n\nThe Prince Mikasa was born on 2 December 1915, the fourth son of the Emperor Taishō and Empress Teimei. He is the surviving brother of Emperor Shōwa and the surviving paternal uncle of Emperor Akihito. His childhood title was Prince Sumi (Sumi-no-miya). He received the title Prince Mikasa and permission to start a new branch of the imperial family on 2 December 1935. He married on 22 October 1941. The Princess Mikasa was born on 6 June 1923, the second daughter of Viscount Masanori Takagi. Prince and Princess Mikasa have two daughters and three sons."
