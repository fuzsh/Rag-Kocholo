She was hospitalized for two weeks in July last year due to infection with the novel coronavirus.\n\nFor her health, the princess does exercise for about 15 minutes every morning. When the weather is good, she spends time in the garden at the estate to enjoy the sun and stroll around the Akasaka Estate in a wheelchair. Her daily routine also includes reading several newspapers and magazines. She also enjoys watching news and other programs and baseball games on television.\n\nPrincess Yuriko was born in 1923 as the second daughter of Viscount Masanari Takagi.\n\nShe married Prince Mikasa in 1941 and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. The three sons have already passed away.\n\nThe princess has nine grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. “I’m looking forward to seeing their growth,” she said in the statement.\n\nIn December last year, the princess celebrated the publication of a memoir of Prince Mikasa, sharing her memories of the late husband through an oral history method.\n\nOn Jan. 1-2, she attended New Year’s events at the Imperial Palace. Later the same month, she met with new Imperial guards at the Akasaka Estate.\n\nTakayoshi Mizushima, head of the Cultural Foundation for Promoting the National Consume of Japan, released a congratulatory statement for Princess Yuriko, who served as honorary president of the organization for 31 years between March 1979 and March 2010.\n\n“We sincerely appreciate Princess Yuriko’s contributions to passing down Japanese culture through generations,” Mizushima said."
