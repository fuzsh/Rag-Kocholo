        "text": "On October 26, 2021, Princess Mako married her former college classmate Komuro Kei. With her marriage, the eldest daughter of Crown Prince Fumihito and Crown Princess Kiko relinquished her membership in the imperial family, becoming Komuro Mako.\n\nJapan’s imperial family now has 17 members. The current Imperial House Law states that only “a male offspring in the male line belonging to the Imperial Lineage” may become emperor. This means that the only eligible heirs now are Emperor Naruhito’s younger brother Crown Prince Fumihito, his nephew Hisahito, and his uncle Masahito. If the five unmarried princesses get wed, they too will lose imperial status. Addressing the decreasing size of the imperial family continues to be a pressing issue.\n\nIn July 2021, a government panel established to consider how to ensure stable succession focused on two main proposals for maintaining the size of the imperial family, one of which is to allow female members to retain imperial status after marriage. The other is to use the adoption system to restore the imperial status of male descendants in the paternal line from branches that were removed from the family in postwar reforms.\n\nThe chart below shows the remaining 17 members of the imperial family, now that Princess Mako has become Komuro Mako.\n\nPrincesses Marrying Out of the Family Since 1945\n\nCreated by Nippon.com based on data from the Imperial Household Agency website and media sources.\n\n(Originally published in Japanese.
