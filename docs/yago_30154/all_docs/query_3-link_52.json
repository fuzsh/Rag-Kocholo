        "text": "So 6 princesses remained in the Imperial Family. It is known whether one of the princesses (probably Yoko or Akiko) has someone?\n\nAkiko was rumored to have dated a senior researcher in Kyoto in 2009. However, he was said to have been a \"lady killer\" type and not very well received and has since married. Following Prince Tomohito's death, it seems Akiko intends to remain and protect Mikasa-no-miya.\n\nYoko reportedly said in the past that she wanted to marry and have a family yet that seemed to change after Prince Tomohito's death as well. Not much rumors since 2012.\n\nTsuguko allegedly has been dating an employee of a mega bank think tank for several years. One rumor says there were marriage plans 2 years ago. Another rumor says when Tsuguko invited her boyfriend to Takamado residence to meet her family, he unfortunately made a poor impression on Princesses Hisako and Yuriko. There could be opposition from mother and grandmother.\n\nThe Takamado residence often hosts tea ceremonies and dinner parties; Princess Hisako has many opportunities to scout for suitable marriage partners for her daughters. Hisako's policy is that \"romance and marriage are different\" and she's carefully judging each personality.\n\nSources are weekly magazines so take with a grain (or more) of salt: smart-flash.jp August 2018 and Jprime July 2018\n\nPrincess Akiko of Mikasa and Princess Tsugiko of Takamado are said to have boyfriends.\n\nhttps://ru-royalty.livejournal.com/6618654.html (please, scroll down to see black-and-white photos of Princess Tsugiko with a boyfriend).\n\nYes, here's the full photo with date. Either the photos were taken or magazine issue was September 4, 2014.\n\nhttp://livedoor.blogimg.jp/royalfamily_picture/imgs/5/6/5683ac99.jpg\n\nPink wedding dress? Lovely!!! Can't wait to see pictures tomorow! I wonder if it will be soft pink.\n\nI hope the news analysts are correct! ?\n\nThere are so many lovely personal touches to this wedding, from the Emperor's chrysanthemum emblazoned car carrying the bride to the Meiji shrine, to Mr. Komura being loaned Prince Takamado's top hat, to the bonbonniere with Ayako's personal emblem. This seems like much warmer and more personal wedding than Noriko's.\n\nThank you for all the additional details, Prisma!\n\nYou're welcome. I've been super excited.\n\nI think Noriko's wedding was a bit trickier. She had to marry at Izumo Shrine in Shimane Prefecture instead of Tokyo. The Emperor and Empress did send the same car to take her to the airport. Noriko's wedding bonbonniere also had her emblem as did Sayako's wedding bonbonniere.\n\nI feel for princess Mako. It must be hard to go through your (imperial) family member's wedding (even with a bridegroom named Kei) in the month you were supposed to marry.\n\nYea... Mako and Kei would have married on November 4th. How strange that of all the names in Japan, both grooms have the same sounding name. The characters are different.\n\n守谷慧 Moriya Kei\n\n小室圭 Komuro Kei\n\nThank you, Prisma, for the information about the wedding - it seems like a very nice ceremony and I love all the traditional kimonos. I find it interesting that they're having French food instead of Japanese food at the reception, is it common for wealthier Japanese families to eat more Western food at formal occasions?\n\nAyako looks gorgeous; though I also do feel for Mako, after all she went through with her engagement.\n\nI don't know if it's the custom for wealthier families but state banquets feature French cuisine since the days of Emperor Taisho. Perhaps that policy trickled down.\n\nI have to leave for work soon but here’s additional info and screenshots:\n\nMainichi gallery, includes bonbonniere and the IHA updating the Record of Imperial Lineage, an imperial family register.\n\nEntrance and speeches from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Crown Prince Naruhito:\n\nImperial family members, Abe attend wedding banquet - The Mainichi\n\nDetails on Ayako's dress for the banquet from fnn.jp. Great ~5 minute video of dress and interviews with designer and hairstylist. I took screenshots because FNN removes their videos later...\n\nView attachment 301463\n\nView attachment 301468\n\nView attachment 301469\n\nView attachment 301470\n\n- Norio Suzuki, a longtime designer for the Takamado family. Worked in Paris for 3 years and also designs for entertainers and movie costumes\n\n- Suzuki has a long relationship with Takamado-no-miya. He designed a maternity evening dress for Princess Hisako in 1990 (pregnant with Ayako)\n\n- He also designed Noriko's wedding banquet dress in 2014. She also wore a tiara!!!!!\n\n- Kimie Moriya gave the pink silk to the Takamado family in 2014. At the time, she was managing director at NPO Children without Borders\n\nNoriko with Mr. Suzuki in 2014. I want close ups of her tiara!\n\nView attachment 301464\n\nView attachment 301465\n\nIkue Yamazaki, 2nd generation of the Ikue Yamazaki Salon, styled Ayako's hair and makeup for the Choken-no-Gi ceremony last week and the wedding banquet. She also has a long history with the Takamado family.\n\nAyako requested a new hair style for the banquet, different from her time in the Imperial family. It's half up with a braid down the back.\n\nAccording to the tweet, Princess Yoko is rumored to be absent because of poor health.\n\nGuests before the arrivals of the CP couple and Mr. and Mrs. Moriya.\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DqxCZvuU8AEhiWM.jpg\n\nAnother fnn.jp video includes Ayako's childhood friend Shoko Kondo unpacking the bonbonniere. She also got the bouquet.\n\nPrincess Mako and the Kurodas (?)\n\nView attachment 301466\n\nView attachment 301467\n\nANN video:\n\nPrisma, thank you so much for all the links. I enjoyed all of them very much, and there was wealth of information in them. My Japanese is almost non existent, but I was still able to catch the gist of most of them with your explanations.\n\nThe pink dress looks lovely on Ayako, although I wouldn't say it is a particularly fashionable design. It suited her and the event, and the connection to her husband's mother and family was extremely touching.\n\nIt looked to me as though the bonbonniere also referenced her husband which was a nice and unexpected touch.\n\nBut the best thing was how happy both the bride and groom looked. I always was a bit skeptical about Noriko's marriage, but this one at least looks as though there is a real connection between Ayako and Kei Moriya. Best wishes to both of them!\n\nI found it a bit amusing to see Prime Minister Abe share the (small) table of honor with Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako, being that he has clashed with Emperor Akihito over and over. The dinner conversation at that table must have been remarkably polite ...\n\nFor Kei, it must be a great and special memory to have the prime minister delivering the congratulatory speech and the soon to be emperor giving the toast at his wedding!\n\nI have a few questions:\n\nWhy did PM Abe address Ayako with a higher ranking honorific than Kei, if I'm not mistaken? I expected Ayako and Kei Moriya would be viewed as equivalent rank in after Ayako lost her royal status. Further, Kei walked ahead of Ayako into the banquet room and was addressed first at the beginning of the speech.\n\nIs 70 guests viewed as a small or large guest list for a princess's wedding banquet?\n\nWhich emblem on the bonbonniere is referencing Kei Moriya?\n\nQ. About family members\n\nMoriya: I have been raised over 30 years, especially when my family supported me during hardships. Thinking back, I am full of gratitude. In the future I would like to spend our days as a good couple. I think my mother is also pleased so I would like to ask her to please watch over me in the future.\n\nAyako: It's been 28 years since my happy birth. I am glad to show you happiness while my grandmothers are healthy. My feelings towards my family do not change when married. We would like to cooperate with ourselves so that our families can keep watching with affection as ever. I am sorry my father is not here but he is surely pleased with my marriage and I want to tell you that I will make efforts to become a couple like my mother and father.\n\n[...]\n\nAyako: (he's) tailored for today…and (top hat Moriya carried), I'm very happy because I lent items from my father. I was nervous but I was thrilled to see how he looked. I look forward to Takamado-no-miya for good services in the future. (laugh) [this refers to Princess Hisako's introduction]\n\n[...]\n\nAyako's dress is expected to be pink silk with white lace and has special meaning for both families. Kei's mother Kimie, who supported developing countries, gave Princess Hisako pink silk made by Cambodian women. This is the silk used for Ayako's dress instead of the customary Japanese silk.\n\nI wondered how the couple would remember the parents who had passed on on their special day, and it is lovely to learn that Prince Takamado and Kimie Moriya were honored with so many details of the wedding (the top hat from Prince Takamado, the pink silk from Kimie Moriya's project in Cambodia, Ayako's wish to become a couple like her parents, etc.) Ayako's funny callback to her mother's introduction is nice as well.\n\nI think part of this may be that the couple come across as being very engaging. In addition, we've already had two other royal weddings this year, so there may have been additional interest stirred up due to that.\n\nThere are also the impending abdication and Princess Mako and Kei Komuro's wedding postponement to pique interest in the imperial family."
