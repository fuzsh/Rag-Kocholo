        "text": "Belleau Wood: The name is gentle, evoking a clear brook sparkling through a sun-dappled forest. In fact, prior to World War I, it was just that ... and it is again, today, over a century later. However, for approximately a month in 1918, Belleau Wood may as well have been Hell.\n\nBelleau Wood is a little patch of French heaven located only 35 miles from Paris, and that location made it a critical waystation on the way to the French capital. If the Germans were able to take Paris, France would fall and along with it the Allied war effort.\n\nOnly one thing stood between the Germans and Paris (and it was probably the only thing that could stand between them): The U.S. Marine Corps. The Marine riflemen of the time were expert marksmen and their skill was displayed through German casualties. The Germans were unpleasantly surprised at the skill of Marine marksmen. The battle fought by American Marines at Belleau Wood would help forge the legacy and ethos of the U.S. Marine Corps that is revered to this day."
