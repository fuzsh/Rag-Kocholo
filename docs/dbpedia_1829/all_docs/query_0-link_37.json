        "text": "On 4 June 1918, German troops occupying Belleau Wood made a determined assault across Les Mares farm, a short distance to the west of the wood. They were stopped by the 2d Battalion, 5th Marines whose artillery and machine guns had just arrived. This was the closest point to Paris, 50 miles further on, that the Germans reached in their great 1918 offensive."
