        "text": "\"Whether a seasoned armchair traveler, a general World War I enthusiast, or a dedicated Marine historian, readers will benefit from Miller’s comprehensive study and battlefield guide.\"—Army History\n\n\"Highly recommended for anyone who wants to read detailed accounts of the 4th Brigade at Belleau Wood and Soissons.\"—Marine Corps History\n\n\"J. Michael Miller has written a superb new account of two battles with great significance to both the history of the Marine Corps and the events of World War I.\"—Michigan War Studies Review\n\n“An excellent resource for anyone desiring a full understanding of these two battles, which are part of the same campaign.”—U.S. Military History Review\n\n“A first rate military history of the 4th Marine Brigade at war in 1918, with particular focus on the bitter battles at Belleau Wood and Soissons.”—New York Military Affairs Symposium Review\n\n“Relying on extensive reminiscences from Marines who fought at Belleau Wood and Soissons in the summer of 1918, Mike Miller’s book vividly re-creates what it was like to ‘be there’ on the battlefields. It especially underscores the personal experiences of the intense fighting that would mark the emergence of the US Marine Corps as a major fighting force for the AEF. The book’s tour guides are a valuable bonus that will allow battlefield visitors to consider up close what the brave Marines actually faced during that fateful summer.”—David J. Bettez, author of Kentucky Marine: Major General Logan Feland and the Making of the Modern USMC\n\n“For three weeks in June 1918, an inexperienced 4th Marine Brigade clawed a bloody way through Belleau Wood in a triumph of bravery. But only a month later the same Marines complemented valor with skill in the allied victory at Soissons. The learning curve’s price was steep, comprehensive, and enduring. The Marine Corps’ list of defining battles is long—Iwo Jima, Chosin Reservoir, Khe Sanh. But this comprehensively researched work demonstrates that none overshadow Belleau Wood and its aftermath.”—Dennis Showalter, author of Instrument of War: The German Army 1914–18"
