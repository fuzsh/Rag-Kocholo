Was the battle \"nothing more than a local engagement, not a battle in itself, but only a phase of the defense of the Aisne-Marne sector?\"\n\nOr, was it as General Tasker Bliss suggested to Pershing, the battle \"stopped the German drive and very possibly saved Paris.\" Which, the author indicates was something the French \"had no doubt about.\"\n\nGeneral Bullard said, \"The marines didn't win the war here, but they saved the allies from defeat. Had they arrived a few hours later I think that would have been the beginning of the end.\"\n\n[ame=\"http://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Belleau-Wood-Modern-Marine/dp/076276130X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1411216784&sr=1-1&keywords=miracle+at+belleau+wood\"]Miracle at Belleau Wood: The Birth Of The Modern U.S. Marine Corps: Alan Axelrod: 9780762761302: Amazon.com: Books@@AMEPARAM@@http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rCREBLZJL.@@AMEPARAM@@51rCREBLZJL[/ame]\n\nA War correspondent named Gibbons was along for the battle and ended up with several wounds during an advance. His description of an assault across open ground against German machine gun nests:\n\n\"and then it happened. The lighted end of a cigarette touched me in the fleshy part of my upper arm. That was all. It just felt like a sudden burn and nothing worse. The burned part did not seem to be any larger in area than that part which could be burned by the lighted end of a cigarette.\"\n\nHis first wound was actually a bullet in the biceps and not a cigarette burn.\n\n\"Then the second one hit. It nicked the top of my left shoulder. And again came the burning sensation, only this time the area affected seemed larger.\"\n\n\"And then the third one struck me. In order to keep as close to the ground as possible, I had swung my chin to the right so that I was pushing forward with my left cheek flat against the ground and in order to accommodate this position of the head, I had moved my steel helmet over so that it covered part of my face on the right.\n\nThen came a crash. It sounded to me like some one had dropped a glass bottle into a porcelain bathtub. A barrel of whitewash tipped over and it seemed that everything in the world turned white. That was the sensation. I did not recognize it because I have often been led to believe and often heard it said that when one receives a blow on the head everything turns black.\"\n\nLater on he asked. \"Am I dead?....I wanted to know......How was I to find out if I was dead?.....I decided to try and move my fingers on my left hand. I did so and they moved. I next moved my left foot. Then I knew I was alive.\"\n\nIn fact, Correspondent Gibbons had lost his left eye and a section of his skull. He remained in the filed for 3 hours until well after dark when they crawled back to the American positions.\n\nConsidering the limited size of the engagement, any kind of claim it saved the war for the allies should be safe to call as a gross overstatement.\n\nIt was an infantry battle fought in what at the time had largely become an artillery contest. As such it had plenty scope for the personally poignant and heroic, but it would still seem to rate as fairly Quixotic by 1918 standards.\n\nIt certainly seems to have pleased the US commander at the time, Pershing, but then he in turn seems to have been in an upproar against, partly in denial of, the realities of the WWI battlefield as the French, British, and Germans had all learned to read it.\n\nConsidering the limited size of the engagement, any kind of claim it saved the war for the allies should be safe to call as a gross overstatement.\n\nIt was an infantry battle fought in what at the time had largely become an artillery contest.

The French were in full scale retreat from the area that would literally open the door to Paris.\n\nI believe your point coincides with some of the historical views. Most certainly. However, I also believe that the size of an engagement does not always mark its significance. I noticed recently that a professor within the framework of \"the great courses\" considered San Jacinto one of modern histories most significant battles. Fought between a mere 1,000 or so on each side. Yet, Texas literally turned from Mexico to the US as a consequence of the battle.\n\nThat said, yep, the battle was tiny when compared to the massive struggles of World War One.\n\nJust as an aside, I really enjoy 'the great courses'. Does anyone else watch their lecture series? They have a WWI but I have not yet viewed it.\n\nConsidering the limited size of the engagement, any kind of claim it saved the war for the allies should be safe to call as a gross overstatement.\n\nIt was an infantry battle fought in what at the time had largely become an artillery contest.

He wouldn't put it in the terms you have used. He said, to paraphrase, that the Germans were confident that they had worn the British and French down. It had been hard work but it was almost over. They were going to win. As to the Americans, well they weren't much. They had no experience and would probably run off the first chance they got. But Belleau Woods took the heart out of that argument. The Germans weren't up to handling a new force as tough as the one that fought at Belleau Woods.\n\nIf your team is down 10 points in the last quarter and some new untried rookie gets off the bench and performs brilliantly for the last 5 minutes and your team ends up winning by two points, did the rookie win the game? If anyone said that the players who played throughout the game would take offense, but I think they would admit that the game could not have been won without this rookie.\n\nLawrence\n\nWhile your observations as to the size of the engagement make a fair point, without the Marines holding at Belleau Wood, does Paris fall?

Wikipédia[/ame]\n\nWhile your observations as to the size of the engagement make a fair point, without the Marines holding at Belleau Wood, does Paris fall? The French were in full scale retreat from the area that would literally open the door to Paris.\n\nIt would be unlikely that Paris would fall for various reasons...\n\n1) The French weren't in retreat in every portion of the lines.\n\n2) The US Marine Corps wasn't even the only American unit in the line.\n\n3) Ludendorff had no intention of taking Paris. His goal was to get the French reserves away from Amiens. Making it LOOK like he was attacking Paris seemed to be the best way to get them to abandon the British.\n\n4) The Germans didn't have the logistical base with which to take Paris even if they wanted to to, and here the French lines had held firm.\n\nI believe your point coincides with some of the historical views. Most certainly. However, I also believe that the size of an engagement does not always mark its significance. I noticed recently that a professor within the framework of \"the great courses\" considered San Jacinto one of modern histories most significant battles. Fought between a mere 1,000 or so on each side. Yet, Texas literally turned from Mexico to the US as a consequence of the battle.\n\nTexas had already turned to the US prior to the Battle of San Jacinto in the Texas Revolution, mostly the result of the decision to allow American citizens to immigrate into Texas... and the reason why San Jacinto is so important is the fact that while the battle seemed small, it was where Sam Houston's rebel army captured Santa Anna.\n\nBy contrast, Belleau Wood didn't have anything quite so spectacular. Wilhelm II was not snoozing in a trench captured by the Marines and at that time Hindenburg and Ludendorf didn't lead from the front. As such, the battle is largely a small one between units of the French Army, the US Army, and the US Marine Corps against German \"reserve/defensive\" units. It was a victory, but one that doesn't truly stop the German offensive cold when one considers that the Second Battle of the Marne is fought some time after...\n\nThe Americans were just fed a lot of propaganda about their role in ww1. National Myth making it's common.\n\nThe US Army was not particularly effective in ww1. They were tactically naive and too stubborn to learn quickly. They had very inexperienced raw staff officers and no experience on moving and organizing large formations let alone fighting,\n\nThey were shipped to Europe on British Ships and armed by the British and the French.\n\nThe German offensives had already stalled. The Real story of the Battle is the Americans facing a far smaller German force suffered large casualties because of their totally naive and stupid tactics.\n\nWhats the Difference between in the US Marine Corps and the Boy scouts?\n\nThe Boy scouts have adult leadership.\n\nHmmmmm, yes, I realized the grapes were a bit sour but I hadn't realized they were already turned to vinegar in the bottle."
