        "text": "Aisne-Marne American Cemetery & Memorial is located in Belleau, France. It is administered by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), a U.S. government agency created in 1923 to coordinate redesign of the eight permanent overseas World War I cemeteries established by the U.S. War Department. ABMC was also charged with creating lasting and impressive monuments to the accomplishments of the American Expeditionary Forces in Belgium, France, and Great Britain.\n\nProminent French-born American architect Paul P. Cret served as consulting architect for all the ABMC World War I commemoration projects. The renowned Boston architectural firm of Cram & Ferguson designed the chapel, new entrance gates, visitor building and staff quarters at Aisne-Marne which were constructed from 1929-33. Also included in this tour is the nearby Belleau Wood, where the Belleau Wood Monument - sculpted by the American artist Felix de Weldon - was placed in 1955.\n\nProject Information\n\nHeritage Documentation Programs (HDP) undertook Historic American Landscapes Survey (HALS) documentation of Aisne-Marne American Cemetery & Memoria in 2016. Richard O'Connor was Chief of HDP. The project was sponsored by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), Honorable Max Cleland, Secretary, Robert Dalessandro, Deputy Secretary, Headquarters, and John Wessels, Deputy Secretary, Overseas Operations. Project planning was coordinated by Paul Dolinsky, Chief, HALS, and by Alec Bennett, Historian, ABMC. The field work, including hand measuring and terrestrial laser scanning, was undertaken by Project Supervisor Christopher M. Stevens, HALS Landscape Architect, and HDP Architects Dana Lockett, Daniel De Sousa, Jason W. McNatt, and Ryan Pierce. Stevens, McNatt, Pierce, and Landscape Architecture Technicians Charles Canfield (University at Buffalo) and Alexander Esparolini-Hernandez (Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico) produced the measured drawings. The historical reports were written by HABS Historian Lisa P. Davidson. On-site assistance at Aisne-Marne was provided by Shane J. Williams, Superintendent, Constant Lebastard, Cemetery Associate, and by the ABMC garden and maintenance staff."
