Coffman's War to End All Wars, Stalling's The Doughboys, Friedel's Over There, SLA Marshall text in the American Heritage History of World War I and American Armies and Battlefields in Europe. The most valuable resource for the chronology was the Official 2nd Division History which is now available on CD from our friends at the Digital Bookshelf. A forgotten Marine contributor sent the Frederick Wise comments which are from the memoir, A MARINE TELLS IT TO YOU. The top illustration is a detail from a Leatherneck Magazine cover. Regular contributors Herb Stickel and Ray Mentzer helped with the other photos.\n\nAll of the above are recommended for deeper study of the battle as well as two interesting websites:\n\nBradley Omanson's Scuttlebutt & Small Chow: A Salty Old Harbor of Marine Corps History\n\nGreat War Society Member Edward Swaim's Belleau Wood Today Photo Essay\n\nLast, a special thanks for Col. Bill Anderson, USMC, a Great War Society Member and student of the battle who caught some serious errors of omission in my original draft.\n\nMH"
