        "text": "This beautifully crafted, richly researched book tells a powerful story that is sure to interest a wide audience of specialists and nonspecialists alike. In a meticulously researched study that draws on a wide range of archival collections in Turkey, Armenia, Lebanon, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany as well as a substantial assembly of memoirs, newspapers and periodicals, secondary sources, and interviews, Kurt constructs a microhistory of sorts that takes Aintab as its focus and allows readers to follow the dynamics of Armenian dispossession from the 1895 massacres to the genocide carried out during World War I, and into the Turkish Republic. Kurt subscribes neither to the idea that Ottoman Christians and Muslims had been locked in age-old primordial hatreds, nor to the image of a rosy coexistence across the ages. He does ask, however, how it was that a community like Aintab, where Muslims and Christians had coexisted relatively peacefully for so long, fell victim to the genocidal momentum that had begun to engulf places with Christian communities. He explores this by following the money, so to speak. Who profited from this and how?\n\nIf a layman wants to educate himself/herself on the topic of “Turks helping or rescuing Armenians during the Genocide” and attempts a “Google Search” on the subject, the search will yield almost 2.5 million results. Of course the number is illusive since there are enormous amount of repetitions. However, one can still get a fair amount of information about the subject. The interesting thing here is that the major percentage of entries is Armenian in origin. However, if the same person attempts a search by typing “Ottoman Official resistance to Genocide” the results count drop to 60.000, which is replete with entries that have no relevance to the subject. Here again, the percentage of Armenian entries is not negligible… I will deal more with this discrepancy in my conclusion. To what can we attribute the paucity of entries to this last category? To tackle such an issue as this presentation attempts has its limitations. The limitation stems from the fact that almost a hundred years after the Armenian Genocide, literature regarding Ottoman official resistance to the mass killings is, at best, scarce. In a memorandum it released in 2001 the Zorian Institute underlines this difficulty: As the leaders of the Ottoman Turkish government in 1915 were rounding up the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire for mass deportation and slaughter, a number of Turks risked their own lives to help Armenians escape certain death. There is no way to know today how many such individual acts of courage and humanity occurred in those tragic times. Our sources of information are largely anecdotal: family histories transmitted orally, autobiographies and personal memoirs, and the oral testimonies of survivors. These acts of heroism and kindness stand in stark contrast to the cruelest savagery displayed by the perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide. Their importance is great, for several reasons. First, they are additional evidence of the Armenian Genocide. Secondly, they illustrate that, while there was indeed genocide, not all Turks supported it. Thirdly, these stories serve to reassure us of the human potential for courage and virtue."
