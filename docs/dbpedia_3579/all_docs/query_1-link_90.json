        "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nThere are several small War Cemeteries in Israel that were abandoned in the 60's (Fascinating story on its own, but that’s not what I'm writing about), one of them is in the area of Junction Station. One of the members of The Society for the Heritage of World War I in Israel is showing tremendous interest in this particular abandoned cemetery, and every once in a while is mowing around and cleaning it up.\n\nRecently, I went with him over the details of The Capture of Junction Station (November 14th, 1917), and I realized that I know very little about the LAMB / LACB – Light Armoured Motor/Car Batteries (2 cars were involved in The Capture of Junction Station). By the way – in the war literature the word \"Armoured\" is used while today we use \"Armored\". Any idea why?\n\nSame thing as to LCP's – Light Car Patrols. My knowledge on these is so far also quite limited.\n\nI found some material about the LCP's, both about the original No. 1 (Australian) LCP, and the later Model T Ford cars LCP's (including the 7th (Australian) LCP). I understand that a battery was probably 6 cars strong, but not about the number of people operating within each battery. However, there are several question marks as to many other LCP's were active in this theatre of war (Palestine).\n\nI found very little about the LAMB units – I understand that the standard car was Rolls Royce, but I don't know much more. In the different sources I checked (below) sometimes there is a reference to \" Light Armoured Motor (or car) Batteries\", sometimes to \"Armoured Motor Batteries\" (Are they different?) and once to \"Armoured Car Brigade (11 Rolls–Royces)\" – In one reference HQ was mentioned. Don't know how many people man each car, how many cars per battery, HQ, service etc.\n\nI tried to check several sources as to the existence & location of both LAMB & LCP units within the EEF. Very confusing results, in the different sources I checked: The OH (C. Falls); A brief record of the advance of the EEF; The long long trail; Wikipedia. I've also browsed through a few forums' threads that discussed this issue.\n\nAccording to these very confusing different results, there were 5 or 6 LCP's (Maybe more) and 2 to 5 LAMB units (Numbered 1, 2, 3, 11, 12).\n\nTo summarize – H E L P ! !\n\nEran\n\nThanks to everyone!\n\nStill, in regards to the LCP & LAMB units in the Palestine Campaign - everything is very very confusing.\n\nSteve – Like you, I was under the understanding that there were 4 units active here: The 11th & 12th LAMB and the 1st & 7th LCP (Thanks for clarifying the fact the 7th was British – As this unit operated under the Australian Mounted Division, it led me to believe that it was Australian too, like the 1st LCP). These are the LCP & LAMB units mentioned both in the British HO (Falls) Order of Battle September 1918 and the same (i.e. September 1918) in the detailed Wikipedia site dedicated to the various Orders of Battles of the EEF 1916-18 (However, additional units are mentioned in relation to other periods during 1916 & 1917, and in other sources – I’ll return to this shortly).\n\nI’ve seen the reference in The Long Long Trail to the 17 MMGB – I also found it mentioned in the Wikipedia version (Only!) of the Order of Battle of the Eastern Force, April 1917. However, this battery is not mentioned later in any of the lists of the Orders of Battles, and I don’t recall reading about them (In terms of actions) anywhere either. Furthermore, The Long Long Trail mentions that the 17 MMGB is later re-designated as 15 LAMB. Haven’t found even a single reference to this battery, either in lists or in actions.\n\nNow to Junction Station. Indeed, 2 cars of the 12 LAMB were at Masmia early in the morning of Nov. 14th, under orders to report to the Australian Mounted Division. Major-General Palin (Commander of the 75 Division) “hijacked” those cars and ordered them to join and assist the 234 Brigade in the capture of the station. The cars passed the advancing infantry and came into action at 08.25. Soon after the cars were joined by the 123 Rifles Battalion and soon afterwards by the rest of the 234 Brigade.\n\nSteve, you mentioned “One sources mentions the fighting near there by the 12 LAMB attached to the Aust MD, will need more checking”. The question is, are those cars the same ones from Junction Station, or other cars from the same Battery (Can you point at the source?).\n\n______________________________________________\n\nLainAlexander – Thanks! I have noted that quite a lot of the LCP’s activities were in Western Egypt and Libya. Does the book 'Light Car Patrols 1916-19’ also include parts about the activities in Palestine? As I am quite connected to the Australians here – I am very familiar with Australian sources.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nStuart – thank you. If the personal of each LCP is 30 people, and as the 6 LCP’s cars (Ford) were usually manned by a crew of 2-3 each, this means that they were at least 12 people in each unit dealing with maintenance etc. I guess each unit needed some sort of small scale “depot”, with spare parts, fuel etc. Any idea how this worked (Horse carts? Lorries?)? You mentioned that there was a central depot for the Light Car Force, and I guess it was located in Egypt. Do you know how the cars serving in the East (Sinai and later – Palestine) were served?\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nGlen – The Australian LCP is the most recorded one of the LCP’s units on the Internet. There are tons of info regarding them. The question is if this new book will have new insights. I hope it will have at least new photos of high quality. Do you have a copy?\n\n______________________________________________\n\nMaureen – Quite a wealth of links there! Finally, something about the LAMB units, but, as you mentioned, most about the Indian theater, and some of general nature. So far, found very little about the LAMB units in the Palestine theater.\n\nBy the way – I just had an in-depth look into the events of Haifa 1918 and visited some the lesser known sites of this battle, mostly those on the top of Mt. Carmel (Karmelheim).\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nI really would like to know a bit more about the LAMB units, including car crew, number of cars per battery, personal, maintenance, depot etc.\n\nI’ll try to summarize the confusing results from the three sources I examined as to number and distribution of the LCP & LAMB units (In addition to the British HO and Wikipedia – I relay a lot on A brief record of the Advance of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, which, for me, is a fantastic source, most times quite reliable. Available on the Internet).\n\nLet’s start with the LCP units, 1917: According to both the British HO and Wikipedia, 8 LCP units were active under the EEF, 6 of them under Delta and Western Force. According to Advance of the EEF, 9 LCP units were active, while LCP’s No’s 1,2,3,4,8 were under The Desert Mounted Corps and LCP’s No’s 5,6,7,9 were under the Force in Egypt (LCP 7 defiantly was active in Palestine, at least a little later). You see why I’m confused?...\n\nAs to Lamb units, all sources agree that there were 5 batteries under the command of the EEF, No’s 1,2,3,11,12 LAMB. All sources agree that LAMB No’s 11 & 12 were active in Palestine. The differences are about where the other batteries were positioned, and when. According to Advance of the EEF, No. 1 L.A.C. Battery was Lent to British mission in Hijaz.\n\nIn the British HO, at October 1917, LAMB units 2 & 3 were under the Desert Mounted Corps and served (Together with LAMB No’s 11 & 12) as Corps troops. According to Advance of the EEF, No. 2 Light Armoured Car Battery was under the Desert Mounted Corps, while No. 3 Light Armoured Car Battery was under the Force in Egypt. According to Wikipedia – No’s 1, 2, 3 Light Armoured Motor Batteries were in Egypt. I guess that by now you understand me better….\n\nNo mention, anywhere, of the 15 LAMB! I don’t remember coming across any reference to actions of the LAMB No. 2 in the Palestine campaign.\n\nThanks again for all the help so far!\n\nEran\n\nEdited 8 October , 2016 by Eran Tearosh\n\nThis photograph might help to give an idea of the complement of a Light Armoured Car Battery. It is of No. 2 LACB and, as the photographer’s place of business is identified, was very likely taken in Aleppo. The photo is featured in that Battery’s Christmas/New Year card; the cover is reproduced below. The original print is pale sepia but it was scanned black and white, which seems to give a clearer image. The print measures 15.3cms x 11cms. The card front was scanned in colour.\n\nThe ‘sister’ group photograph from No. 2 Light Car Patrol’s 1918 Christmas card was used by Russell McGuirk in his book Light Car Patrols 1916-19. However, he did not use the cover of that card which is reproduced below. Perhaps not legible on this image size, what is probably the artist’s name, Goeling, is at the bottom. More obvious is the ‘serpent’ as the S in Syria. It is clear from the originals of both cards that the two photographs were taken in the same place, probably by the same photographer though there is no identifying sticker on 2 LCP’s card.\n\nNo. 2 LCP left Sollum on 11th October 1918, beginning a journey through Palestine and Syria, joining the 5th Cavalry Division near Hama on, or shortly after, 23rd October, and arriving in Aleppo on 26th October. It seems, then, that both photographs were taken after that date and before Christmas 1918. A plausible guess would be that the photos were taken after the Armistice and in time to send them home for Christmas.\n\nA pass giving permission for members of 2 LCP to go into Aleppo, stamped ‘No. 2 Light Car Patrol’ and dated 26/12/1918, is signed ‘R.C.V. Hamilton Lt., Cmdg. Nos. 2 & 4 LCP’. Presumably No. 4 LCP was also in, or camped near, Aleppo at that time.\n\n2 LCP seems to have stayed in, or around, Aleppo until April 19th 1919 when it left for Aintab, now known as Gaziantep, in Turkey’s south-eastern Anatolian region. The Patrol was in Aintab, or that region, until at least June 1919. Some members of 2 LCP, perhaps all, were demobilised from Aintab.\n\n[McGuirk confirms that both No. 2 and No. 4 LCPs left Sollum for Palestine during October 1918 (op.cit. p.103). Iain Alexander’s post - above, 4th July 2016 - suggests that No. 2 LCP left for Palestine in October 1917. The 1917 date seems to be a typo.]"
