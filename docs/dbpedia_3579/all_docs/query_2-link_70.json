        "text": "This article engages with the 838–841/1435–1437 Anatolian adventures of the Mamluk amir Jānibak al-Ṣūfī. It demonstrates how Jānibak's narrative is a remarkable story full of meanings, which enable a more nuanced understanding of Mamluk engagements with southern and eastern Anatolia during the reign of sultan al-Ashraf Barsbāy (825–41/1422–38). First Jānibak's whereabouts in Anatolia are reconstructed on the one hand as they appear from contemporary source material and as they have been analysed in a handful of modern studies on the other. Against this historiographical background, a more comprehensive understanding of Jānibak's role and significance is then developed, combining local, Syro-Egyptian and Anatolian readings of Jānibak's story into one integrated social network approach. This reconstruction of Jānibak's social network in the Anatolian frontier zone finally leads to a number of conclusions on the complexity of political life in the 1430s in eastern Anatolia, on the nature of Barsbāy's state, and on the shared realities of 15th-century political cultures in the Nile-to-Black-Sea area.\n\n1 This article has been produced within the context of the ERC-project ‘The Mamlukisation of the Mamluk Sultanate. Political Traditions and State Formation in 15th-century Egypt and Syria’ (Ghent University, 2009–14, ERC StG 240865 MMS). It was first conceived of and presented as a paper by Veerle Adriaenssens at the conference “Everything is on the Move: The Mamluk Empire as a Node in (Trans-)regional Networks”, Annemarie Schimmel Kolleg — University of Bonn, 6–9 December 2012; it has thereafter been expanded and transformed into the current article by Jo Van Steenbergen. Our thanks are due to Stephan Conermann, organiser of the Bonn conference, to the many conference participants, and to colleagues in the Mamluk History and Culture research group at Ghent University for helpful feedback and comments.\n\n2 It is argued here that a revision is due of some particular views of 15th- century Mamluk engagements with Anatolia that remain quite persistent: at best, there is the perspective of the sultanate as an outsider to Anatolian political realities, who engaged with Anatolia only to construct a buffer to keep these realities out (see eg. Sh. Har El, Struggle for Domination in the Middle East. The Ottoman-Mamluk War, 1485–1491 (Brill, 1995); too often, however, the Mamluk sultanate is just not considered to be an active part at all of the political landscape of Anatolia (see eg. the lack of any meaningful consideration of the Mamluk sultanate's political involvement in The Cambridge History of Turkey. Volume I. Byzantium to Turkey, 1071–1453, (ed.) K. Fleet [Cambridge, 2009], especially in the survey by R. P. Lindner, “Anatolia, 1300–1451”, pp. 102–117).\n\n18 For general introductions into the topic of the Mamluk sultanate and Anatolia/Asia Minor in the first half of the 9th/15th century, see Sh.

Rettig (Paris, 2012), pp. 27–48, esp. 35–38.\n\n38 Al-Maqrīzī, Sulūk, iv, pp. 1023–1024, 1026; Ibn Taghrī Birdī, Nujūm, xv, pp. 87–89; Ibn Ḥajar, Inbāʾ al-Ghumr, ix, pp. 4–5; al-ʿAynī, ʿIqd, p. 495; al-Ṣayrafī, Nuzhat al-Nufūs, iii, pp. 397, 400. Interestingly, Ibn Taghrī Birdī also mentions another version of the story of Jānibak's final days, far more neutral towards his Aqquyunlu hosts: Meḥmed and his brother had refused to make a deal with the governor of Aleppo, but then Jānibak had died of the plague that was raging at that time; keeping this a secret, only then the brothers had struck their deal and sent his head to Aleppo; Ibn Taghrī Birdī commented, however, that “it was the first [rather than this] story that circulated among the people”(Ibn Taghrī Birdī, Nujūm, xv, p. 88; also in Ibn Taghrī Birdī, al-Manhal, iv, p. 229).\n\n39 This emerges very clearly from the above reconstruction, as this mainly follows the historical writings of the contemporaries al-Maqrīzī, Ibn Taghrī Birdī and Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī; this story remained surprisingly absent — with only three very allusive references to Jānibak — in another contemporary chronicle, by al-ʿAynī (al-ʿAynī, ʿIqd, pp. 481–482, 495). Later chronicles, such as by al-Ṣayrafī and by Ibn Iyās, largely followed or summarised the chronological accounts of al-Maqrīzī and of Ibn Taghrī Birdī (see the references to al-Ṣayrafī above, and see Ibn Īyās, Badāʾiʿ al-Zuhūr fī Waqāʿī al-Duhūr, (ed.) M. Mostafa (Berlin, 2010) (Bibliotheca Islamica 5, ii, pp. 162, 164, 165, 166, 168–169, 170–171, 172, 173, 175, 177, 178–179).\n\n49 This view of this Anatolian frontier zone in the first half of the fifteenth century — as a highly dynamic, fluid, and permeable social space of multiple interlocking but not necessarily parallel political, economic and cultural interests, related in varying degrees of integration to multiple centres of political, economic and cultural activities in Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, Iraq, Azerbaijan and Iran — is actually diametrically opposed to Har-El's conceptualisation of the same Ottoman-Mamluk frontier from a rather anachronistic territorial inter-statist systemic perspective (see Har El, Struggle for Domination in the Middle East, pp. 1–8 [‘The Anatolian State System’], 27–59 [p. 28: “. . .the Mamluks’ buffer system around the landward Anatolian frontier. . .”]). For a very useful illustration of the complex and multi-layered processes of integration and secession at work in this frontier zone, see Patrick Wing's study of sultan Barsbāy's 1433 campaign against the Aqquyunlu (Wing, “Submission, Defiance, and the Rules of Politics on the Mamluk Sultanate's Anatolian frontier”, p. 12).\n\n50 An ego-network is a network consisting of an identified focal node (“ego”) and the nodes (= the other individuals or groups) to whom ego is directly connected through a variety of ties (“edges”), appearing clearly irrespective of, or in addition to, the ties that may also directly connect the other individuals in the network (each of whom is the focal node, of course, at the centre of his own ego-network). See: Steve Borgatti, www.analytictech.com/networks/egonet.htm (consulted on 5/11/2013); see also Lemercier, Claire “Analyse de réseaux et histoire”, Revue d’histoire moderne et contemporaine 52/2 (2005), pp. 88–112 CrossRefGoogle Scholar, esp. pp. 91–92.\n\nBrokerage refers to “a structural position or role in which an actor [in this case “ego”] makes transactions and resource flows possible between two other social sites” (K. Barkey, Empire of Difference. The Ottomans in Comparative Perspective [Cambridge, 2008], p. 10 [quote]; and more in general R. S. Burt, Brokerage and Closure: An Introduction to Social Capital [Oxford, 2005]).\n\n63 In the case of the Ottoman governor of Amasya, Yörgüç Pasha, who also controlled Tokat, Yinanç suggests an Ottoman geo-political incentive to counter Karamanids and the Egyptian sultan, claiming that “pour changer le sens des événements ils se servirent de Djānibak-Sūfī qui avait trouvé asile dans leur pays” (Yinanç, ”La dynastie de Dulghadir”, p. 102); although such an Ottoman interest is not unlikely in the first phase of Jānibak's story, it is nowhere corroborated in any of the surviving source reports (see below for more details on this geo-political dimension, and the apparent lack of Ottoman interest in Jānibak for most of his story).\n\n97 On the identification of the term turk with Mamluk elites, see J. Van Steenbergen, “Nomen est Omen. David Ayalon, the Mamluk Sultanate, and the Rule of the Turks”, in Egypt and Syria under Mamluk Rule: Political, Social and Cultural Aspects, (ed.) A. Levanoni (in press); Koby Yosef, “Dawlat al-atraāk or dawlat al-mamālīk? Ethnic origin or slave origin as the defining characteristic of the ruling élite in the Mamlūk sultanate”, Jerusalem Studies of Arabic and Islam 39 (2012); the same passage is tellingly rendered by Ibn Taghrī Birdī as “with them, a group from the Mamluks and the Türkmen was caught (wa-umsika maʿahum jumāʿa min al-mamālīk wa-l-turkumān)” (Ibn Taghrī Birdī, al-Manhal, iv, p. 228)."
