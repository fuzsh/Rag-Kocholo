        "text": "The literature on the Armenian Genocide has been growing steadily in recent years. We now have access to many good books and articles that shed light on the historical background of this tragedy and add to survivor and eyewitness descriptions that have been available since the deportations and killings started in 1915. None of these studies, however, pay much attention to the Armenians who chose to stay in Turkey after the genocide and through the establishment of the Turkish republic. This is not surprising, because this small and dwindling community of at most 60,000 people does not easily fit into the competing narratives of the Armenian Genocide. For those promoting the official Turkish version, the continued presence of Armenians in Turkey is a reminder not only of an earlier, much more diverse and tolerant era but also, more poignantly, of everything that happened during the closing years of the Ottoman Empire, including the deportation and murder of almost the entire Armenian population of Anatolia. For both survivors and historians of the genocide, on the other hand, it is not easy to understand why any Armenian would have chosen to stay in Turkey after 1923, knowing that this would place them under the protection of the very people who had engineered the deportation and mass murder of their communities. With her new book Lerna Ekmekçioğlu takes an important step in filling this gap. She describes how the Bolsahay (the Armenian community of Istanbul) navigated the treacherous currents of the Allied occupation and the early years of the republic to (re)make a place for themselves in a changing country and a changing world. In addition to newspapers, magazines, personal memoirs, and contemporary publications, the book relies extensively on articles that appeared in the journal Hay gin (Armenian woman), which was published in Istanbul from 1919 to 1933 by the Armenian Women's Association. Throughout her analysis Ekmekçioğlu pays special attention to the writings of a handful of feminist intellectuals—in particular\n\nThis essay discusses a set of inadvertent encounters with the late nineteenth and early twentieth century persecution of the Ottoman Armenians in light of Rosalind Morris' notion of \" accident, \" which implicates the traumatic event as not just a distant, isolated and immutable past but also one that constantly crops up in the present and runs the risk of so doing in the future. The essay draws attention to the multiplicity of the actors and settings involved in the said encounters: bones, trees, living people, mountains, stones, buildings, rivers, fault lines, and valleys. In these encounters, the temporal pervasiveness characteristic of Morris' notion of accident is therefore coupled with its spatial counterpart as it stretches above, below, through and across the geography concerned. This twofold pervasiveness is a call to begin to develop a new notion of truth about the persecution of the Ottoman Armenians—one whose contemporary resonance complicates sequentiality and builds on an entanglement of human-inflicted and natural forms of destruction and violence.\n\nThe year 2015 marked the centenary of the Armenian Genocide, the destruction of the Ottoman Armenians by the Committee of Union and Progress and the Ottoman state apparatus, and one of the first mass murders of the twentieth century. Last year saw unprecedented media focus and wider discussion of the tragedy, its legacies, and wider reflections about the interface of historical memory and national state projects. The Armenian Genocide is an interesting case study not just in and of itself, but in its unmitigated denial by Turkish state actors and the complicity of the international community in its almost complete erasure from history. The centenary of the Genocide, however, constituted a turning point in witnessing a clear proliferation in cultural production on this theme, including these four books. Each is important in its own right and remit, and each contributes to the field and reflects the achievements in genocide scholarship over the last decade.\n\nBefore the 1915 Genocide of Ottoman Armenians, the region of Van, in contemporary southeastern Turkey, held hundreds of active Armenian churches and monasteries. After the destruction of the Armenian community, these ruined structures took on new afterlives as they became part of the evolving environments and communities around them. These ruined spaces play a role in the everyday lives of the people who live among them and shape their historical understandings and relationships with the local history and geography. I interrogate the afterlives of one abandoned monastery and examine how local Kurds imagine, narrate, and enact the politics of the past and the present through that space of material ruin. I demonstrate how the history of the Armenian Genocide and ongoing state violence against the Kurdish community are intricately linked, highlight the continuation of violence over the past century, and deconstruct notions of ahistorical victims and perpetrators.
