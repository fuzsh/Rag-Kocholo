        "text": "This article contains cuneiform script. Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of cuneiform script.\n\nThe toponyms of Turkey result from the legacy left by several linguistic heritages: the Turkish language (spoken as first language by the majority of the population), the Greek language, the Armenian language, the Kurdish language, the Laz language as well as several other languages once spoken widely in Turkey. Turkey's place names range from those of unknown or unrecognizable origins to more clearly derivable onomastics. Many places have had their names changed throughout history as new language groups dominated the landbridge that present day Turkey is. A systematic turkification of place names was carried out when the worldwide wave of nationalism reached Turkey during the 20th century (main article: Geographical name changes in Turkey).\n\nToponyms of population centers in Turkey\n\n[edit]\n\nAdana: from the Hittite URUAdaniya of Kizzuwatna,[1] alternatives: related to the legendary character Danaus, Greek tribe Danaoi, Egyptian enemy country Danaja, Mycenaean refugees Dananayim or Danuna, and Da-na-vo (people living by the river), Scythian nomad people.\n\nAdıyaman: As the official Ottoman Turkish name Hısn-ı Mansur (\"Castle of Mansur\", or Kurdish variation Semsûr) was difficult for the locals to pronounce, people were referring the city as adı (its name) yaman (tough) since the early 19th century, u.e. \"its name is tough\" or \"(the place) whose name is tough\" in Turkish.\n\nAfyonkarahisar: from Turkish pronunciation: [afjonkaɾahiˈsaɾ], Turkish: afyon \"poppy, opium\", kara \"black\", hisar \"fortress\".,[2] i.e. The black castle of the Opium city' in Turkish (The area around has a long tradition of growing opium for the drug industry and was subject of much controversy when under US pressure Turkey forbade opium growing for a period in the seventies).\n\nAğrı: From Ağrı (Ararat) Dağı‎ (mountain).

At the beginning of the 14th century it came under the domain of the Karasids and grew as it attracted migrants. In Ottoman times, it was also known as Kemer and attached to Edremit until 1866.\n\nBursa: After Prusias I, the King of Bithynia who in 202 BC. was granted the Greek city of Cius, which rebuilt the city and renamed it Prusa (Ancient Greek: Προῦσα; sometimes rendered as Prussa)\n\nÇanakkale: From Çanakkale ceramics, compared by one traveler to Delftware, and an Ottoman fortress called Kale-i Sultaniye (Ottoman Turkish: قلعة سلطانيه) or Sultaniye kalesi (Fortress of the Sultan). As of 1920, the British began to call Çanakkale, Chanak and Kale Sultanie in their reporting.[18] The place was earlier known by the straits Greek name Δαρδανέλλια, Dardanellia,[19]\n\nÇankırı: From its name in antiquity Gangra. The city has also been known as Changra, Kandari or Kanghari.\n\nÇeşme: From \"Çeşme\" meaning \"spring, fountain\" in Persian (چشمه), and the first settlement 2 km south of the present-day center Çeşmeköy ('town with fountain' in Turkish) founded by Tzachas.\n\nÇorum: Turkish pronunciation: [ˈtʃoɾum]; Medieval Greek: Ευχάνεια, romanized: Euchaneia from Karum Akkadian: kārum \"quay, port, commercial district\", plural kārū, from Sumerian kar \"fortification (of a harbor), break-water\"[20][21][22] ancient Assyrian trade posts[23] in Anatolia (modern Turkey) from the 20th to 18th centuries BC.\n\nDatça: from Stadia, a name of the city of Cnidus.

In fact it is a four-day trip from the sea.\"\n\nDikili: origin of the name (means upright in Turkish) is unclear, might mean an obelisk, a single stone column, or a not-fallen dead tree. Ancient Pitane and as yet unexplored site of Atarneus are located nearby.\n\nDiyarbakır: from diyar (land of) and bakr (unclear which of these is the origin: tribe name bakr, or Kurdish for north bakur, or Turkish for cupper bakır) The city is called Kurdish: Amed, Arabic: ديار بكر, Diyaru Bakr, Syriac: ܐܡܝܕܐ, romanized: Amida, Armenian: Տիգրանակերտ, romanized: Dikranagerd)[25][26][27]\n\nDoğubeyazıt: from Doğu (east) and Beyazit after the Turkish warlord Celayırlı Şehzade Bayazıt Han who ordered one of the rebuildings (in 1374) even though the old castle with Armenian name Daruynk.[28] was repaired many times throughout history. Ultimately, the town was renamed Beyazit itself in the 16th century and later in the 1930s a new town was built in the plain below the old site, hence the new name \"Doğubayazıt\", which literally means \"East Beyazıt\".\n\nDüzce: From Düzce Pazar (Flattish Bazaar or market on flat ground) a marketplace on the plain 8 km from the historical Konuralp, the seat of the Turkish conqueror of the area on behalf of Osman I at 13th century.\n\nEdirne: From Adrianople (Hadrianopolis in Latin or Adrianoupolis in Greek, founded by the Roman emperor Hadrian on the site of a previous Thracian settlement named Uskudama),[29]\n\nEdremit, Balıkesir: From the original in Greek Adramyttion (Άδραμύττιον) or Adramytteion (Άδραμύττειον)\n\nEnez: From the original in Greek Ainos (Greek: Αἶνος), Latinized as Aenus.\n\nErbaa: From \"Erbaa\" means \"four\" in Arabic.

The etymological origin of the word is disputed, but it is agreed that the city was once called Erez. For a while it was called Justinianopolis in honour of Emperor Justinian. In more recent Greek it has been called as Κελτζηνή (Keltzene) and Κελεζηνή (Kelezene)[32] In the Armenian language, the 5th-century Life of Mashtots called it Yekeghiats[33] In the more recent past, it was known in Armenian as Երզնկա (Yerznka)[34]\n\nErzurum: A neighboring commercial city named Artze (Arcn, Arzan; Armenian: Արծն) was heavily sacked by the Seljuk Turks in 1048–49.[35][36] Its Armenian, Syrian, and other Christian inhabitants moved to Theodosiopolis, which they began calling \"Artsn Rum\" (meaning Artze of the Rûm, i.e., Romans) to distinguish it from their former residence.[37][38][39][35] Some older sources derive the name Erzurum from the Arabic Arḍ ar-Rūm (Arabic: ارض الروم) 'land of the Rûm'.[37][40]\n\nEskişehir: The name Eskişehir literally means \"Old City\" in Turkish; indeed, the city was founded by the Phrygians in at least 1000 BC, although it has been estimated to be older than 4000 years old. The city was known as Dorylaeum (Δορύλαιον) in Greek under the Roman Christian era.\n\nFethiye: In 1934, the city was renamed 'Fethiye' in honor of Yüzbaşı Fethi Bey [de] one of the first pilots of the Ottoman Air Force, killed in 1914 by Al-Samra.[41] Modern Fethiye is located on the site of the ancient city of Telmessos. Over the centuries, it has been called Telmissos, Anastasioupolis, Makre, Makri (Μάκρη, \"long one\") and Beskaza during the Turkish period.\n\nGaziantep: formerly called Antep or Aīntāb (عين تاب) in Ottoman Turkish, ‘Aīntāb (عينتاب) in Arabic, there are several theories for the origin of its name:[citation needed]\n\nAïntap may be derived from khantap, meaning \"king's land\" in the Hittite language.\n\nAïn, an Arabic and Aramaic word meaning \"spring\", and tab as a word of praise.\n\nAntep could be a corruption of the Arabic ‘aīn ṭayyib meaning \"good spring\".[42] However, the Arabic name for the city is spelled with t (ت), not ṭ (ط).\n\nAyin dab or Ayin debo in Aramaic, meaning \"spring of the wolf\"\n\nThe Crusaders called the city and its castle \"Hantab\", \"Hamtab\", and \"Hatab\".[43][44]\n\nGaziantep is the probable site of the Hellenistic city of Antiochia ad Taurum[45] (\"Antiochia in the Taurus Mountains\").\n\nIn February 1921, the Turkish parliament honored the city as غازى عينتاب Ghazi Aīntāb or \"Antep the war hero\" to commemorate its resistance to the French Siege of Aintab during the Franco-Turkish War, part of the Turkish War of Independence, and that name was officially adopted in 1928 as Gaziantep.[46]\n\nGebze: Origin of the name is unclear. Ottoman records contains these variations: Geybüyze, Geybüveyze, Geyibüveyze, Geyiboyze, Geykivize. Evliya Celebi in one of his trips called it Kekbeziye, in another trip he gave the sentence \"Gel bize\" (come to us in Turkish) as explanation for the origin.\n\nGelibolu: from Greek: Καλλίπολις, Kallipolis, \"Beautiful City\"[47]\n\nGiresun: formerly Cerasus (Κερασοῦς) in Greek. the etymology might be related to the Greek word κερασός (kerasós) \"cherry\" + -ουντ (a place marker).[48] Thus, the Greek root of the word \"cherry\", κερασός (kerasós), predates the name of the city,[48] and the ultimate origin of the word cherry (and thus the name of the city) is probably from a Pre-Greek substrate, likely of Anatolian origin, given the intervocalic σ in Κερασοῦς and the apparent cognates of it found in other languages the region.[48] Another theory derives Kerasous from κέρας (keras) \"horn\" + -ουντ (a place marker), for the prominent horn-shaped peninsula that the city is situated on (compare with the Greek name for the horn-shaped Golden Horn waterway in Istanbul, Κέρας (Keras) \"Horn\").[49] The toponym would have later mutated into Kerasunt (sometimes written Kérasounde or Kerassunde), and the word \"cherry\" (as well as its cognates found in other local languages) was derived from the name of the city itself, rather than the other way around.[49]\n\nGöcek, Fethiye: possibly from Turkish male name meaning young, fresh, beautiful. The word also is used to mean one foot tall young wheat plant.\n\nGüllük: Literally \"for roses\" or rose garden.\n\nGümüşhane: From gümüş (silver), and hane (house) i.e. silver house in Turkish. Name due to the many silver mines in the area. The Greek population used the unofficial translation to Argyrópolis or Arghyropolis, Αργυρόπολις for a time in the 19th century.\n\nHakkari: unclear name origin (undocumented suggestions: Hakkar tribe, hak-kar-in = can-do-just)\n\nIğdır: after a western Turkish clan called Iğdır that belonged to a branch of the Oghuz Turks.[50][51]\n\nİskenderun: From Alexander the great\n\nIsparta: from Greek: Σπάρτη, Baris/Βάρις in Byzantine Greek\n\nIstanbul: Derived from the Medieval Greek phrase \"εἰς τὴν Πόλιν\" (pronounced [is tim ˈbolin]), which means \"to the city\",[52] how Constantinople was referred to as the only major city in the vicinity by the local Greeks.\n\nİzmit: from the Ancient Greek name of the city, Nicomedia (Greek: Νικομήδεια). Names used in English prior to official Turkish Latinization include Ismid, Iskimid, and Isnikmid.[53]\n\nİzmir: from original Greek name \"Smyrna\" and \"Smyrne\" (Σμύρνη)\n\nKahramanmaraş:\n\nKandıra: From Kéndri or Kándora.\n\nKarabük: From Kara (black) and bük (bush) i.e. black bush in Turkish. Karabük was built in the 1930s as the seat of the iron and steel industry of Turkey.\n\nKaraman: From Karaman Bey who was one of the rulers of the Karamanid dynasty. The former name was Laranda which in turn comes from the Luwian language Larawanda, literally \"sandy, a sandy place\".[54]\n\nKars: As Chorzene, the town appears in Roman historiography (Strabo) as part of ancient Armenia.[55] For the origin of the name \"Kars\", some sources claim it to be derived from the Georgian word კარი (kari), meaning \"the gate\" as was the case for other border region strongholds[56] while other sources claim it is from the Armenian word հարս (hars), meaning \"bride\",[57] or rather from կառուց բերդ (kaṛuts berd), \"Kaṛuts Fortress\".[citation needed] The Turkish etymology offered by M. Fahrettin Kırzıoğlu (that the name came from the \"Karsak\", a Turkish tribe), has been dismissed as unsustainable by scholars.[58]\n\nKastamonu: The city is believed to have been founded in the 18th century BC. The town was known as Timonion (Τιμόνιον in Greek) during the Roman period. The change of name of the town dates to the 10th century AD. Manuel Erotikos Komnenos, a Thracian soldier who became a prominent general and the father of the Byzantine emperor Isaac I Komnenos, was given lands around Kastamonu by Emperor Basil II and built a fortress there named Kastra Komnenon (Κάστρα Κομνηνών). Manuel came to the notice of Basil II because of his defence, in 978, of Nicaea against the rebel Bardas Skleros.[59] The name Kastra Komnenon was shortened to Kastamone, and later turkified to Kastamoni and Kastamonu.\n\nKarataş: From Kara (black) and taş (stone) i.e. black stone in Turkish.\n\nKaş: in the 1600s the Lord of Teke observed Kaş and Meis from the top of the hill and said, \"If the islet of Meis Adası is the eye, then this place will be its kaş (eyebrow in Turkish).\" It seems Kaş was founded by the Lycians, as Habesos or Habesa. In the Hellenistic period and under the Roman Empire it served as the port of Phellus. It was called Andifli under Arab, Seljuks, and Ottomans, and Kaş since the 1600s.\n\nKayseri: originally called Mazaka or Mazaca by the Hattians and was known as such to Strabo, during whose time it was the capital of the Roman province of Cilicia, known also as Eusebia at the Argaeus (Εὐσέβεια ἡ πρὸς τῶι Ἀργαίωι in Greek), after Ariarathes V Eusebes, King of Cappadocia (163–130 BC). The name was changed again by Archelaus (d. 17 AD), last King of Cappadocia (36 BC–14 AD) and a Roman vassal, to \"Caesarea in Cappadocia\" (to distinguish it from other cities with the name Caesarea in the Roman Empire) in honour of Caesar Augustus, upon his death in 14 AD. When the Muslim Arabs arrived, they adapted the pronunciation to their writing resulting in Kaisariyah (note that letter C in classical Latin was pronounced K), and this eventually became Kayseri when the Seljuk Turks took control of the city in circa 1080, remaining as such ever since.[60]\n\nKazlıçeşme, Zeytinburnu: from the historic fountain (Turkish: çeşme) with a relief goose (Turkish: kaz) figure below the fountain's inscription, which dates it back to Hijri year AH 953 (AD 1537).[61]\n\nKilis: In the tablets belonging to the Assyrian period, the name 'Ki-li-zi' is written in cuneiform and a city named as \"Ciliza Sive Urnagiganti\" during the Roman Empire period is mentioned.\n\nKırklareli: From 'Kırk' (Forty) and 'El' (Area), i.e. The land of the forties in Turkish.\n\nKırşehir: From 'Kır' (grey / steppe ) and 'şehir' (city), i.e. The grey / steppe city in Turkish.\n\nKırıkkale: From 'Kırık' (broken) and 'kale' (castle), i.e. The broken castle in Turkish.\n\nKonya: from εἰκών (icon), as an ancient Greek legend ascribed its name to the \"eikon\" (image), or the \"gorgon's (Medusa's) head\", with which Perseus vanquished the native population before founding the city.[62] if not hellenised from an earlier Luvian name.\n\nKuşadası: From 'Kuş' (bird) and 'ada' (islet), i.e. The island of birds in Turkish.\n\nKütahya: From the original in Greek Kotyaion, Latinized in Roman times as Cotyaeum.[63][64]\n\nMalatya: From the Hittite Malidiya (melid or milit which means \"honey\").\n\nManisa: From Magnesia (Greek: Μαγνησία) the place where the original magnetic rocks came from.\n\nMardin: From a Syriac/Assyrian Neo-Aramaic language name translating to \"fortress\" used as the Roman period name Marida (Merida),[65][66][67][68]\n\nMarmara Ereğlisi: From name given 300 AD as Heraclea (Ἡράκλεια).\n\nMarmaris: From the Turkish word mermer, Greek màrmaron (marble) in reference to the rich deposits of marble in the region.\n\nMersin: From Mersin Bey, a leader of the Oghuz Turks, a local clan named Mersinoğulları reported by Evliya Çelebi\n\nMilas: From ancient name (Ancient Greek: Μύλασα, Mylasa) associated with Lycians\n\nMuğla: From ancient name Mobolla\n\nMuş: From Mushki the ancient clan with clover as sign that built the original castle later demolished by Suleiman the Magnificent\n\nNazilli: According to legend, the son of Aydın's governor in the Ottoman period, fell in love with a young woman from Pazarköy but was rejected by the girl's father.

The word Thrace indicating the European part of Turkey i.e. the part west of bosphorus, Maramara and Dardanelles, was established by the Greeks for referring to the Thracian tribes, from ancient Greek Thrake (Θρᾴκη),[84] descending from Thrāix (Θρᾷξ).[85] It referred originally to the Thracians, an ancient Indo-European people inhabiting Southeast Europe. The name Europe first referred to Thrace proper, prior to the term vastly extending to refer to its modern concept.[86][87] In Turkish, it may be referred to as Rumeli, Land of the Romans, owing to this region being the last part of the Eastern Roman Empire that was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of largest cities and towns in Turkey\n\nMetropolitan municipalities in Turkey\n\nList of rivers of Turkey\n\nList of lakes of Turkey\n\nReferences and notes\n\n[edit]\n\n^ See, e.g., Sirekli Archaeological Project.\n\n^ Lewis Thomas (Apr 1, 1986).
