        "text": "Gaziantep , Turkey\n\nGaziantep (Ottoman Turkish: عينتاب Ayntab, Arabic: عنتاب‎ or Arabic: عينتاب‎, Kurdish: Dîlok) previously and still informally called Antep; ʻayn tāb [ʕajn tæːb] is a city in southeast Turkey and amongst the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The city is located 185 kilometres (115 miles) northeast of Adana and 127 kilometres by road north of Aleppo, Syria. The city has two urban districts under its administration, Şahinbey and Şehitkamil. It is the sixth most populous city in Turkey.\n\nAccording to the Turkish Statistical Institute, as of 2011 the city of Gaziantep had a population of 1,376,352 and its metropolitan municipality 1,393,289.\n\nHistory\n\nAntiquity\n\nA lion from the ancient city of Sam'al (Hittite: Yadiya; Turkish: Zincirli Höyük) within the modern Gaziantep Province.

Displayed at the Gaziantep Museum of Archaeology.\n\nGaziantep is one of the most developed provinces of the region and is also one of the oldest, its history reaching as far back as the Hittites. Being the center of pistachio cultivation in Turkey and with its extensive olive groves and vineyards, Gaziantep is one of the important agricultural and industrial centres of Turkey.\n\nGaziantep is the probable site of the Hellenistic city of Antiochia ad Taurum (\"Antiochia in the Taurus Mountains\"). The ruins of the Doliche (Turkish: Dülük) lie a few kilometers to the north of the city center and they are located in the natural setting of a forest arranged into a recreational area also including picnic and camping facilities.\n\nIn the center of the city stands the Gaziantep Fortress and the Ravanda citadel as reminders of past - the citadel was restored by the Byzantines in the 6th century. The Archaeological Museum, with its important collections from Neolithic and the Hittite ages as well as the Roman and Commagene times, attracts many visitors. A recent addition to the Museum's riches are the Roman mosaics discovered in Zeugma. The surroundings of the city are also full of valuable Hittite remains. The Hasan Süzer House, which has been restored to its original state, now houses the Ethnographical Museum. Yesemek Sculpture Workshop, 30 kilometers south of the town of Islahiye, is one of the world's first of this kind. Some of the other historical remains are the Zeugma (called also Belkıs in Turkish), and Kargamış ruins by the town of Nizip and slightly more to the north, Rumkale.\n\nGaziantep was ruled by Akkadians, Mitannis, Hittites, Neo-Hittites, Assyrians, Urartians, Babylonians, Persians, Macedonians, Parthians, Commagene, Romans, Byzantines, Sassanids, and Arabs.\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nIn the first half of the 7th century, Arab armies of the Muslim Caliphate captured this region. It was passed to the Umayyads in 661 and the Abbasids in 750. During the period of Arab rule, it was ravaged several times by the Eastern Romans (Byzantines). After the disintegration of the Abbasid dynasty, the city was ruled successively by the Tulunids, the Ikhshidids and the Hamdanids. In 962, it was recaptured by the Byzantines (Eastern Romans), and retained by them until the Seljuk conquest in 1067. The regime of the Anatolian Seljuks gave way to the Syria Seljuks in 1086. Tutush I appointed Thoros of Edessa as governor of the region.\n\nIt was captured by the Crusaders and united to the Maras Seigneurship in the County of Edessa in 1098. It reverted to the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm in 1150, controlled by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia between 1155–1157 and 1204–1206 and captured by the Zengids in 1172 and the Ayyubids in 1181. It was retaken by Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm in 1218. It was ruled by the Ilkhanate between 1260–1261, 1271–1272, 1280–1281 and 1299–1317 and by the Mamluks between 1261–1271, 1272–1280, 1281–1299, 1317–1341, 1353–1378, 1381–1389 and 1395-1516. It was also governed by the Dulkadirids, which was a Turkish vassal state of the Mamluks.\n\nOttoman Period\n\nThe Ottoman Empire captured Gaziantep after the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516, during the reign of Sultan Selim I. In the Ottoman period, Aintab was a sanjak centered initially in the Dulkadir Eyalet (1516-1818), and later in the Aleppo vilayet (1908–1918). It was also a kaza in the Aleppo vilayet (1818–1908). The city established itself as a centre for commerce due to its location straddling trade routes. 17th century Turkish traveler Evliya Celebi noted that there were 3900 shops and 2 bedesten.\n\nRepublic of Turkey\n\nDue to the valor of its inhabitants against the invading French, it was given the honorific title of 'Gazi' meaning 'veteran' and the city's name officially renamed Gaziantep. The Martyrs' monument commemorates the defense of the city and its hero Şahin Bey. Gaziantep was only a small city at the start of the republican period. However, it quickly became a regional hub and industry grew rapidly in the second half of the 20th century. This quick growth lead it to be designed as an \"Anatolian tiger\".\n\nPolitics\n\nGaziantep is traditionally said to reflect in advance the rising political trends in Turkey, according preference to ANAP in 1984, DYP in 1989, Necmettin Erbakan's (then named as) Welfare Party in 1994, and AKP in 2004 local elections. One exception was in 1999 when, boosted by the successful image of Gaziantep city mayor Mr. Celal Doğan, CHP came first with 17.02% of the votes for the Provincial General Assembly (with four parties scoring over 15%, and the rightist MHP's rise at that time (campaigning on Turkish-identity consciousness arguments) still being reflected by its second position after CHP for the province. DEHAP, campaigning on Kurdish-identity consciousness arguments, after having touched a modest 5% ceiling in 1999, seems to have ebbed down, its score under SHP's cover in 2004 local elections remaining at a still more modest 1.81% (with MHP at 5.36%). In any case, in 2004, AKP obtained 55.11% and CHP 21.57%, and all other parties below 6% at the Provincial General Assembly elections. Prime Minister Erdoğan is known to have deemed the local elections in Gaziantep as particularly important and to have mobilized considerable governmental weight beforehand.\n\nThe current Mayor of Gaziantep is Dr. Asım Güzelbey, who had previously served for 30 years as an orthopedic surgeon in the city, prior to the elections in 2004.\n\nMayors\n\nMayors of Gaziantep\n\nMayor Years of service\n\nDr. Asım Güzelbey 2004–present\n\nCelal Doğan 1989–2004\n\nÖmer Arpacıoğlu 1984–1989\n\nEconomy\n\nMedical Park Hospital in Gaziantep\n\nGaziantep is famous for its regional specialities: the copperware products and \"Yemeni\" sandals, specific to the region, are two examples.
