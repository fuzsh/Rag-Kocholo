        "text": "With some 50,000 inhabitants in the seventeenth century, Basra matched the estimated number of people in Hormuz in its heyday in the early 1500s. See Jean Aubin, “Le royaume d’Ormuz au début du XVIe siècle,” Mare Luso-Indicum 2 (1973): 150.\n\nNational Dutch Archives (NA), The Hague, Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) 1135, Geleynssen de Jongh, Gamron to Batavia, 30 March 1641, fol. 663; VOC 1188, Elias Boudaen, Report on Basra, 29 November 1651, fol. 541v. Dates were exported in large quantities, to places all around the Persian Gulf. See Pedro Teixeira, The Travels of Pedro Teixeira, trans. and ed. William Sinclair and Donald Ferguson (London, 1902), 29. Hamilton in the early eighteenth century claimed that Basra annually exported some 10,000 tons of dates.\n\nSee Alexander Hamilton, A New Account of the East Indies, 2 vols., ed. Sir William Foster (London, 1930), 1:52. Pearls from the upper part of the Persian Gulf, collected near the island of Kharg, were especially coveted in India for being heavier and denser than the ones from Tuticorin in India. See NA, VOC 1251, Van Wijck, Gamron to Heren XVII, 6 April 1666, fol. 1232. Horses were more expensive in Basra than in Iran, but at least Muslim merchants were allowed to export them freely. For the authorities of Basra, access to horses was an important aspect of successful campaigns against neighboring tribal formations.\n\nSee Dina Rizk Khoury, “Merchants and Trade in Early Modern Iraq,” New Perspectives on Turkey 5–6 (1991): 67.\n\nThe recent publication of Willem Floor’s comprehensive study on the Persian Gulf in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries includes two major chapters on Basra. See his The Persian Gulf: A Political and Economic History of Five Port Cities 1500–1730 (Washington D. C., 2006). This came out too late to be fully incorporated into the present study. Aside from the classic study by Stephen Hemsley Longrigg, Four Centuries of Modern Iraq (Oxford, 1925), which remains the standard history for the period and the region, there is Dina Rizk Khoury’s excellent article, cited in the previous note, which considers Basra as well as Mosul,\n\nand now Rudi Matthee, “Between Arabs, Turks and Iranians: The Town of Basra, 1600–1700,” Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 69 (2006): 53–78.\n\nThis trend has become prominent in the study of Mughal India. See, for instance, Sinnapah Arasaratnam, Merchants, Companies and Commerce on the Coromandel Coast 1650–1740 (Delhi, India, 1986)\n\nand Sanjay Subrahmanyam, The Political Economy of Commerce: Southern India, 1500–1650 (Cambridge, 1990).\n\nFor Safavid Iran, see Rüdiger Klein, “Trade in the Safavid Port City of Bandar Abbas and the Persian Gulf Area (ca. 1600–1680): A Study of Selected Aspects” (PhD diss., University of London, 1994);\n\nand, for a more implied example, Stephen Dale, Indian Merchants and Eurasian Trade, 1600–1750 (Cambridge, 1994).\n\nHala Fattah, The Politics of Regional Trade in Iraq, Arabia, and the Gulf 1745–1900 (Albany, New York, 1997);\n\nand Thabit A. J. Abdullah, Merchants, Mamluks, and Murder: The Political Economy of Trade in Eighteenth-Century Basra (Albany, New York, 2001).\n\nSee K.

Zens, eds., Ottoman Borderlands: Issues, Personalities, and Political Changes (Madison, WI, 2004).\n\nLe Gouz de la Boullaye, Les voyages et observations du Sieur Boullaye-de la—Gouz (Paris, 1657; repr. 1994), 163–64.\n\nDe Thevenot, Voyages, 3:536 and Hamilton, New Account, 1:89. Teixeira, Travels, 29, makes it clear that cereals and rice were grown around Basra as well, but he also mentions imports. Duarte Barbosa in the early sixteenth century claimed that “plenty of wheat” was exported from Basra. (See Duarte Barbosa, The Book of Duarte Barbosa, ed. Mansel Longworth Dames, 2 vols. (London, 1918), 1:89.) The first Portuguese foray into the port of Basra was also designed to purchase wheat and ship it back to Hormuz.\n\nSee Ronald Bishop Smith, The First Age of Portuguese Embassies, Navigations and Peregrinations in Persia (1507–1524) (Bethesda, MD, 1971), 59. All of this may have been wheat that had been brought to Basra from the coastal area in Iran. See for this question Khoury, “Merchants and Trade,” 64–65.\n\nSee Gilles Veinstein, “Commercial Relations between India and the Ottoman Empire (Late Fifteenth to Late Eighteenth Century): A Few Notes and Hypotheses,” in Merchants, Companies and Trade: Europe and Asia in the Early Modern Era, ed. Sushil Chaudhury and Michel Morineau (Cambridge, 1999), 97–98.\n\nFor a discussion of the changes, see A.

Hotz, 344–46.\n\nAndré Wink, “From the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean: Medieval History in Geographic Perspective,” Comparative Studies in Society and History 44 (2002): 427, draws attention to the instability of rivers and coastlines along the Indian Ocean and the resulting lack of durability of ports and cities in the region.\n\nSee also Richard Schofield, “Position, Function, and Symbol: The Shatt al-Arab Dispute in Perspective,” in Iran, Iraq, and the Legacies of War, ed.

Manuel Godinho, Intrepid Merchant: Manuel Godinho and His Journey from India to Portugal in 1663, ed. John Correia-Afonso, trans. Vitalio Lobo and John Correia-Afonso (Bombay, India, 1990), 124. Pietro della Valle, traveling from Kharg to Basra in 1625, relates how the pilot of his ship couldn’t find the “mouth of the river of Bassora.” See Della Valle, The Travels, 243.\n\nM. B.

That not just Aleppo but the entire region surrounding it underwent an economic upswing is reflected in the fact that the city of Aintab (modern Gaziantep) witnessed an economic recovery and saw its tax revenue increase dramatically as of the mid-1530s. See Leslie Peirce, Morality Tales: Law and Gender in the Ottoman Court of Aintab (Berkeley, CA, 2003), 28–30.\n\nIn this context Rhoads Murphey draws attention to the relatively modest size of the Ottoman fleet deployed in the Indian Ocean.
