STEVENSON and ERIC LICHTBLAU\n\nWASHINGTON, Jan. 11 - President Bush on Tuesday nominated Michael Chertoff, a federal appeals judge and former prosecutor who helped oversee the Justice Department's antiterrorism efforts after the Sept. 11 attacks, to succeed Tom Ridge as homeland security secretary.\n\nMr. Bush made the announcement a month and a day after his original choice to succeed Mr. Ridge, Bernard B. Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner, withdrew his nomination amid legal and ethical questions.\n\nIn Judge Chertoff, Mr. Bush chose another veteran of law enforcement in the New York region who, as the president pointedly noted, has been confirmed three times by the Senate to previous posts, the last in 2003.\n\n\"When Mike is confirmed by the Senate, the Department of Homeland Security will be led by a practical organizer, a skilled manager and a brilliant thinker,\" Mr. Bush said.\n\nHe praised Judge Chertoff as having an \"impressive record of cutting through red tape and moving organizations into action.\"\n\nIn brief remarks, Judge Chertoff recalled helping respond to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as head of the criminal division at the Justice Department and said that if confirmed, \"I will be proud to stand again with the men and women who form our front line against terror.\"\n\nJudge Chertoff has a well-documented if at times controversial record on issues related to fighting terrorism. As the Justice Department, he favored aggressive steps like holding Muslim immigrants for questioning and passage of the USA Patriot Act to give the government more antiterrorism tools.\n\nIn 2003, he argued before an appeals court that a terror suspect who faced a federal trial, Zacarias Moussaoui, was not entitled to question an operative of Al Qaeda who was held overseas as an enemy combatant.\n\nMr. Moussaoui's case, which has stalled, and the collapse of a terrorism case in Detroit amid accusations of prosecutorial misconduct, are among the few missteps in a record that includes the successful prosecutions of John Walker Lindh, an American captured in Afghanistan, and accused Qaeda sympathizers in Lackawanna, N.Y.\n\nSince leaving the Justice Department, Judge Chertoff has questioned the administration's policy of holding enemy combatants indefinitely without charge or trial.\n\n\"We need to debate a long-term and sustainable architecture for the process of determining when, why and for how long someone may be detained as an enemy combatant, and what judicial review should be available,\" he wrote in The Weekly Standard in December 2003.\n\nJudge Chertoff was the administration's leading prosecutor on corporate fraud, leading the case in the Enron scandal that led to the collapse of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm. At one point, the White House considered appointing him to head the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAt the Homeland Security Department, Judge Chertoff will confront a sprawling bureaucracy created out of 22 agencies to protect against another terrorist strike. Mr. Ridge, a former Republican governor of Pennsylvania who informed Mr. Bush after the election that he intended to step down, was widely credited with getting the department up and running. There has been no terrorist attack on his watch.\n\nBut many Democrats and some Republicans faulted Mr. Ridge as not doing enough to fight for bigger budgets or to improve security at nuclear and chemical plants and ports.\n\nJudge Chertoff's nomination is sure to draw intense scrutiny from the New York Congressional delegation, given New York City's status as a primary terrorism target and the region's efforts to assure that it receives what it considers its fair share of money to improve security.\n\nSenator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said that in a conversation on Tuesday Judge Chertoff acknowledged the need to make the full financing and improved coordination of security issues \"a very high priority.\"\n\nThe nomination was generally well received on Capitol Hill, where members of both parties predicted that he would be confirmed.\n\nA former federal prosecutor in New York and New Jersey, Judge Chertoff was confirmed in 2003 to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, 88 to 1.\n\nThe lone vote against him was by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who had tangled with him while he was special counsel to the Senate panel that investigated the Whitewater affair in Bill Clinton's presidency. In a statement, Mrs. Clinton said she would give the nomination \"careful consideration.\"\n\nThe son of a New Jersey rabbi, Judge Chertoff has earned a reputation as a tough-minded prosecutor with a razor-sharp legal mind. He led the prosecution of Sol Wachtler, who was chief justice of New York, for harassing a former lover and threatening to kidnap her daughter.\n\nHis tactics have sometimes drawn criticism, particularly when he became a chief architect of the legal response to the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nAfter the collapse of Mr. Kerik's nomination, Judge Chertoff represents a safe choice because he is such a known quantity here.\n\nThe White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said the White House had originally been under the impression that Judge Chertoff would be unwilling to give up his seat on the federal bench, which has lifetime tenure. But Mr. McClellan said that when the White House contacted Judge Chertoff, he signaled he would be interested in the domestic security post.\n\nMr. Bush met Judge Chertoff on Saturday morning at the White House to discuss the post, Mr. McClellan said. The White House chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., then spoke with Judge Chertoff. On Sunday morning, the president called Judge Chertoff to offer the post, Mr. McClellan said.\n\nAs a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, Judge Chertoff oversaw organized crime prosecutions but was perhaps best known for his case against \"Crazy Eddie\" Antar, an appliance dealer whose photo later hung on his wall at the Justice Department.\n\nAt the department, Judge Chertoff was responsible for essentially reshaping its mission after Sept. 11, adopting a much more aggressive policy intended to prevent attacks rather than simply prosecuting them after they were carried out.\n\nHe helped lead the push to expand surveillance under the Patriot Act. That law and the broader push to increase government power to fight terrorists, drew criticism that the administration was sacrificing civil liberties. Judge Chertoff was among those often cited by critics for having pushed the pendulum too far. In the administration, he won high marks.\n\n\"Mike was a true agent of change after 9/11, and he took us into a mindset of prevention,\" said Viet Dinh, a former senior Justice Department official who also worked with Judge Chertoff on the Whitewater case. \"He can do the same thing with homeland security, develop a vision and a consensus and build toward that, moving from disparate components with different interests into a common mission. That will be his first order of business, not to consolidate but to coordinate.\"\n\nIf confirmed, Judge Chertoff faces the task of easing the growing pains of an agency that answers to many masters. More than 80 Congressional panels claim oversight. Internal audits have pointed to failings in areas like developing a watch list and ensuring cost-effective contracts.\n\nNew York Times, January 12, 2005\n\nMAN IN THE NEWS\n\nNominee Is Hard Charger on Legal War on Terror\n\nBy ERIC LICHTBLAU\n\nWASHINGTON, Jan. 11 - In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, senior Justice Department officials were scrambling to find new ways to prevent terror suspects from slipping away. Michael Chertoff, a tough-minded prosecutor who was in charge of the department's criminal division, pushed a new tactic - declaring suspects to be \"material witnesses\" and locking them up without charging them with any crime, just as Mr. Chertoff had done with mob figures before.\n\n\"Mike was the one pushing to say 'Hey, we ought to look at using this more aggressively against terrorists,' \" a former senior Justice Department official recalled Tuesday. \"He was the one who made us realize how this tool could be used legally.\"\n\nThe tactic would prove controversial, as many civil rights advocates objected to the department's detentions of dozens of uncharged terror suspects as material witnesses. But to his many supporters, the tactic was typical of Mr. Chertoff's willingness to use smart, aggressive and creative tactics to meet the newly urgent threat of terrorism.\n\nAttorney General John Ashcroft had made clear that he wanted to charge terror suspects for \"spitting on the sidewalk\" if needed, just as Robert F. Kennedy had done with organized crime figures in the 1960's. For nearly two years after the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Chertoff was the Bush administration's point man in that campaign.\n\nMr. Chertoff now takes on a new and equally daunting challenge as President Bush's selection to lead the Department of Homeland Security, a federal behemoth operating 22 agencies and 180,000 employees. If confirmed by the Senate, he will give up a lifetime appointment as a federal appellate judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which he joined in 2003 after leaving the Justice Department.\n\nIn naming Mr. Chertoff to replace Tom Ridge as secretary of homeland security, Mr. Bush called him \"a key leader in the war on terror\" and said that after the Sept. 11 attacks, \"he understood immediately that the strategy in the war on terror is to prevent attacks before they occur.\"\n\nMr. Chertoff's name had not been widely circulated as a contender for the job, and his selection came as something of a surprise. But administration and Congressional officials said that after Mr. Bush's selection of Bernard B. Kerik imploded last month amid legal and ethical questions concerning Mr. Kerik, Mr. Chertoff was seen as a safe and relatively noncontroversial pick.\n\nMr. Chertoff, a rabbi's son who was born Nov. 28, 1953, in Elizabeth, N.J., first earned a reputation prosecuting mob cases as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan before moving to the United States attorney's office in Newark and being named in 1990 by President Bush to lead the office. After a stint in private practice, he returned in 2001 to head up the Justice Department's criminal division.\n\nEven some critics who took issue with the department's aggressive antiterror tactics under Mr. Chertoff's leadership said they respected his legal intellect and integrity. They noted that Mr. Chertoff was willing at times to distance himself from administration policies, as he did in an opinion article in 2003 for The Weekly Standard in which he questioned the practice of holding enemy combatants indefinitely without charges.\n\n\"He was an aggressive prosecutor, but he was never an ideologue,\" said David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University who has been a frequent critic of the Justice Department and has debated Mr. Chertoff several times. \"We've differed on many aspects of the war on terrorism, but I think he's a thoughtful and independent thinker on a lot of these issues, and not insensitive to civil liberties concerns.\"\n\nThe Justice Department claimed a number of high-profile convictions in terrorism cases during Mr. Chertoff's tenure, but it suffered from a number of missteps as well.\n\nA report by the department's inspector general last year was sharply critical of the department's actions in detaining more than 700 illegal immigrants after the Sept. 11 attacks, most of whom turned out to have no connections to terrorism.\n\nIn addition, the case against Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person charged in an American court in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks, has been stalled for two years.\n\nOne of the department's best-known convictions under Mr. Chertoff came against John Walker Lindh, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison after admitting he had supported the Taliban in Afghanistan. That case also created complications for Mr. Chertoff when he was nominated to the federal bench; some Democrats questioned his explanation as to why the F.B.I. was allowed to interview Mr. Lindh after his family hired a lawyer to represent him.\n\nMr. Chertoff defended the department against charges that it was insensitive to civil liberties concerns. \"We are in a time of war,\" he told a meeting of the American Bar Association in 2002. \"If you step back and look at the total picture, the government has been very restrained.\"\n\nMr. Chertoff joined the United States attorney's office in Manhattan in 1983. He had barely finished his first year when his supervisor, Barbara S. Jones, now a federal judge, picked him to work on a unique organized crime investigation alongside the head of the office, United States attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nThe goal was to build a case against the commission made up of the five Mafia families that ran organized crime in New York. Mr. Giuliani was going to serve as the lead trial prosecutor, but a brewing New York City scandal erupted in early 1986, and Mr. Giuliani chose to try that case instead. Mr. Chertoff became the lead prosecutor in a case that would not only make headlines, but history. He and his trial team convicted the leaders of the Genovese, Colombo and Lucchese crime families, as well as a captain of the Bonannos, and he earned a reputation as a gifted trial lawyer.\n\nMoving to the Newark prosecutor's office, Mr. Chertoff became the first assistant at 33. He became the interim United States attorney and was named to the post in 1990 by President George Bush.\n\nRobert Mintz, a deputy to Mr. Chertoff on organized crime cases, said Mr. Chertoff had won over even critics by \"handling the most difficult cases and really putting his own reputation on the line in cases that could have blown up in his face.\"\n\nWilliam K.
