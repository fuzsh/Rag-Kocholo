        "text": "As an Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division, Michael Chertoff is entitled to one of the great old suites in the Justice Department Building—an office with soaring windows, deep-pile carpet, and built-in bookcases. The décor is haute prosecutor: an inscribed photograph of Justice William Brennan, Jr., for whom Chertoff clerked; courtroom sketches of Chertoff facing Fat Tony Salerno, the mobster, and Crazy Eddie Antar, the onetime appliance dealer; and Chertoff's official commission, signed by the first President Bush, from his days as United States Attorney in New Jersey.\n\nChertoff is forty-seven years old, nearly bald, with a wispy beard, and he has a fluid self-confidence that suggests he hasn't been at a loss for words since kindergarten. Since the September 11th terrorist attacks, Chertoff's office has become the funnel for what is probably the most important criminal investigation in American history, as prosecutors and F.B.I. investigators pour in to seek the boss's approval. What leads can we use from the search of a hijacker's car in Portland, Maine? Where do the hijackers' credit-card records lead? Who are we holding on immigration charges? How long can we detain material witnesses? For day-to-day decisions, Chertoff has the last word.\n\nAs it happens, Chertoff was the senior Justice Department official on duty at the F.B.I. command center right after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the experience has informed his subsequent actions. \"The thing we kept thinking about was whether there were other planes out there,\" Chertoff told me recently. \"Until two or three in the afternoon, the main priority was making sure there would not be another attack on any more planes.\" Thanks in part to phone calls from flight attendants and passengers, who identified the hijackers by their seat numbers, the F.B.I. quickly learned most of their names. The tie to Middle Eastern terrorism—specifically, to the network of Osama bin Laden—came almost as fast.\n\n\"In past terrorist investigations, you usually had a defined event and you're investigating it after the fact,\" Chertoff said. \"That's not what we had here. This is not Tim McVeigh. It's not even World Trade Center I\"—the bombing of the towers in 1993—\"where things stabilized after a period of time. We have an organization that never says, 'We've done this, we're done, it's the end of the war.' From the start, there was every reason to believe that there is more to come. You have to assume that there might be an Act II that could come down very quickly. So we thought that we were getting information to prevent more attacks, which was even more important than trying any case that came out of the attacks.\" By midafternoon of September 11th, Attorney General John Ashcroft had cut short an out-of-town trip and returned to Washington to take charge, but Chertoff had set the tone for the law-enforcement reaction on that day and in the weeks that followed.\n\nGreat national traumas tend to transform federal law enforcement, and that is likely to happen in the aftermath of September 11th. The changes, initiated by Chertoff and his colleagues, were reflected first in the investigation of the attacks themselves and then in the antiterrorism legislation that Congress passed, and President Bush signed, last week. In the past, threats to the nation have prompted significant restrictions on civil liberties; among the most notorious episodes were the Red scare and the Palmer raids, after the First World War; the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War; and the wiretapping and harassment of government critics in the wake of the Vietnam War. Against this background, the Bush Administration is beginning to write an important part of its legacy.\n\nCompared with some darker periods in American history, the country is not facing a new wave of repression. The emphasis today is clearly on preventing further terrorist acts. But the traditional meticulous, step-by-step F.B.I. investigation is giving way to quick decisions to detain people on any available grounds: immigration violations, material-witness warrants—anything to defuse potential threats. This switch in tactics is moving in tandem with changes in criminal law itself. The new antiterrorism bill, passed after minimal hearings and debate, breaks down Cold War-era barriers between foreign intelligence and domestic law enforcement to an unprecedented degree. The Justice Department and other agencies will be permitted to move faster, probe deeper, and strike harder at those suspected of terrorist activities. The corresponding worry is whether these changes will reduce the threat of terror or raise the level of fear that citizens feel toward their own government.\n\nMichael Chertoff grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the son of a rabbi and a homemaker. Shortly after graduating from Harvard Law School, in 1978, where he served as a model for an intense and brilliant character in his classmate Scott Turow's book \"One L,\" Chertoff was hired as an Assistant United States Attorney in Manhattan. There, in 1985, courtesy of Rudolph Giuliani, who was then the United States Attorney, he got his big break.\n\nGiuliani chose Chertoff as his principal assistant in the most important organized-crime trial in history: the bosses of the five major New York Mafia families, known collectively as the Commission, were charged with operating a racketeering enterprise—specifically, controlling the local cement business. Just before the trial, however, Giuliani decided to leave the Commission case in order to lead the prosecution of a municipal corruption scandal. Chertoff, though still a mid-level assistant, became the top prosecutor in the Commission case, with its colorful cast of defendants, which included not only Fat Tony Salerno but also Tony Ducks Corallo and Junior Persico. (I met Chertoff when I worked as a summer intern on the Commission prosecution team.) All the defendants were convicted. Years later, according to an article in The American Lawyer, a police sergeant told Salerno, a former Genovese family boss, that Chertoff's career was flourishing. Salerno responded, \"Well, you give him a little message from Fat Tony. You tell that son of a bitch he owes me a thank-you note.\"\n\nChertoff then took a senior position in the United States Attorney's office in New Jersey; in 1990, he was appointed the top federal prosecutor in the state, where he had a successful four-year run, highlighted by his prosecution of Crazy Eddie, the once ubiquitous electronics retailer, in a multimillion-dollar racketeering and fraud case. He spent the next half-dozen years in private practice, until Ashcroft summoned him to the Justice Department.\n\nAt Ashcroft's direction, Chertoff supervised the investigation that has led to the incarceration of nine hundred and twenty-one people since September 11th. \"We started with the hijackers, their credit-card records, their phone records, and peeled back the onion from there,\" Chertoff told me. \"As you run across people who appear to have some association with them, you frankly look at them to see if they had some involvement in the plot, whether they were witting or unwitting.\" Almost all these charges have been brought in secret proceedings, which makes it difficult to assess whether the government has overstepped its authority. Many of the nine hundred and twenty-one are being held for immigration violations; others are being detained as material witnesses, who may have relevant information and may be held indefinitely, even without an allegation of wrongdoing. (Federal judges must approve the detention of material witnesses, and in the past some judges have allowed them to be imprisoned for as long as six months.) \"We were determined not to allow anyone to walk away if they had any connection to the hijackers,\" Chertoff said. \"We're clearly not standing on ceremony, and if there is a basis to hold them we're going to hold them.\"\n\nTo round up these suspects and witnesses, the government is relying on laws that have long been on the books. Violators of immigration laws, such as those who overstay their visas, have always been subject to detention; and prosecutors have always had the power to hold material witnesses. The current investigation, so far, reflects a change in emphasis and focus, rather than a more dramatic change in kind. But the Bush Administration, with the assistance of Congress, is attempting a more sweeping transformation of the criminal law; and that, too, began taking shape right after the attacks.\n\nAs the Administration's antiterrorism proposals worked their way through Congress this fall, Chertoff had one awkward moment. Senator Paul Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat, welcomed Chertoff as he was about to testify before a banking subcommittee, saying, \"Michael, I just have to add, it's nice to have you back before the committee in a different capacity, if I may note, than your previous appearances.\"\n\nThis was a reference to a temporary assignment that Chertoff had taken in 1995 as special counsel to Senator Alfonse D'Amato's investigation of the Whitewater affair for the Banking Committee. It was not a successful chapter in Chertoff's (or D'Amato's) career; much time was spent considering Clinton conspiracy theories—for instance, belaboring the Vincent Foster suicide. The Whitewater job also marked a sort of coming out as a Republican for Chertoff, who had previously cultivated an apolitical reputation. (It also won him an important future patron in then Senator Ashcroft.) But mostly the job taught Chertoff a good deal about getting along in Washington.\n\nIn drafting the antiterrorist legislation, Chertoff and his colleagues tried to address a long-standing anomaly: since the nineteen-seventies, surveillance related to foreign intelligence operated by one set of rules, and investigations for domestic law enforcement went by another. The F.B.I. generally conducted both kinds of surveillance, but the results of these investigations could be shared by two parts of the same agency only under limited circumstances. To Chertoff, this was absurd.\n\n\"Information-sharing is far and away the most significant issue that needed to be addressed,\" he told me. \"It's mind-boggling that information exists in the U.S., even in the F.B.I., and it's not being used to protect people. You can't divide the world any longer into intelligence defense on the one hand and law enforcement on the other. You have foreign powers that are engaged in terrorist activities. The way we stop them from doing bad things is to arrest and convict them. On September 11th, we realized that we couldn't debate it philosophically anymore.\"\n\nChertoff's attempt to dismantle the barriers between foreign intelligence and law enforcement has drawn criticism from civil libertarians. \"It's always been clear that if you want to do a search for law-enforcement purposes, you need to show probable cause and get a search warrant from a magistrate,\" said Morton Halperin, a longtime defense expert and former Clinton Administration official. \"But foreign intelligence was different. For decades, the way the bureau did foreign-intelligence operations was without any authorization at all. They uttered the words 'national security' and they tapped anything they wanted. But then in the seventies, as a result of Watergate and the Supreme Court saying that wiretaps were covered by the Fourth Amendment, there was a problem. The phone companies would no longer coöperate with the F.B.I. unless there was some regularized scheme. Everyone knew there had to be a system put in place.\"\n\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), signed into law by President Carter in 1978, established that system. \"In the discussions leading up to the passage of FISA, the government said when we tap the Russian Embassy we're not looking for crimes; we're looking for what they're saying back to Moscow. The purpose is not to indict anybody but just to gather intelligence information,\" said Halperin, who was then affiliated with the American Civil Liberties Union. Under FISA, the intelligence agencies had to establish only that the targets of their surveillance were agents of a \"foreign power.\" (The F.B.I. seeks these warrants in secret proceedings before a FISA court of seven federal judges.)\n\nIn a world defined by the Cold War, the distinction between foreign intelligence and law enforcement made sense. Occasionally, government lawyers would want to use what they had learned in FISA taps in prosecutions for espionage, and courts allowed it—if the \"primary purpose\" of the surveillance was for intelligence. But terrorism—and especially the events of September 11th—scrambled the rules. If the government picked up evidence of a crime, particularly a terrorist crime, in a foreign-intelligence tap, how could that information be withheld from prosecutors? What if that distinction had inadvertently led to the suppression of information about the impending attacks on America?\n\nLast August, a flight school in Minnesota told the F.B.I. that Zacarias Moussaoui, a thirty-three-yearold French Moroccan, wanted to learn how to steer a jetliner but not how to take off and land. This bizarre request, plus Moussaoui's offer to pay the eight-thousand-dollar tuition in cash, prompted the bureau to detain him on August 17th, when he was found to have violated immigration laws. A trace on Moussaoui's name with French intelligence officials revealed that he had connections to \"radical Islamic extremists\" and that he had recently travelled to Pakistan, and possibly Afghanistan. In light of this, local agents asked headquarters if they could obtain a FISA search warrant for the hard drive on Moussaoui's computer. The F.B.I. denied the request.\n\n\"What happened with Moussaoui was that the bureau felt they had insufficient evidence to show he was a foreign agent under FISA,\" a government investigator familiar with the matter told me. \"And even if they did go ahead under FISA, any evidence they got might have been tainted in a criminal case down the road.\" After the attacks, investigators did obtain access to Moussaoui's computer, where there was information about crop dusting but nothing to suggest that he was involved in the September 11th attacks. There were rumors that Moussaoui was supposed to have participated in the hijackings, but evidence to support that is in dispute, as is his over-all connection to the terrorist underground. Moussaoui remains in federal custody.\n\nThe Moussaoui case, though, does illustrate how convoluted the current system is. A General Accounting Office study of the relationship between foreign-intelligence and law-enforcement investigations, released in July, also noted that coördination between the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice was imperfect at best. The Administration's proposed solution to this problem looked, on the surface, almost semantic. Previously, the government could seek FISA surveillance on a subject if the purpose of the inquiry was foreign intelligence. Chertoff and his colleagues proposed that FISA surveillance be allowed if foreign intelligence was a purpose of the inquiry.\n\nWhen I remarked to Chertoff that this change sounded legalistic, he replied, \"It may sound that way, but we're operating against a twenty-five-year history with the law. The language has given rise to a mind-set where people feel forced to choose between one kind of investigation and the other. But we can't make that choice anymore.\"\n\nMorton Halperin (and many others) does not think the change is merely semantic, and the prospect of a merger of intelligence and law-enforcement surveillance worries him. \"What people have to understand is that there is a lower standard to getting FISA taps,\" he said. \"You don't have to show probable cause; you basically just have to ask for them. And, unlike a law-enforcement tap, the government never has to tell the subject that they've done it. If the government thinks you're under the control of a foreign government, they can wiretap you and never tell you, search your house and never tell you, break into your home, copy your hard drive, and never tell you that they've done it.\"\n\nHalperin has firsthand knowledge. When he served on the National Security Council, under Henry Kissinger, beginning in 1969, Kissinger ordered a tap placed on Halperin's home phone for nearly two years to determine if he was leaking information to the press. After Halperin learned about the tap, he sued Kissinger and Nixon, and the legal battle continued for almost two decades. Halperin ultimately received no money damages, but, as part of a settlement, Kissinger wrote him a formal apology. \"Historically, the government has often believed that anyone who is protesting government policy is doing it at the behest of a foreign government and opened counterintelligence investigations of them,\" Halperin said. \"We are not just talking about people who are members of active terrorist organizations. You could be supporting the peaceful activities of the I.R.A. or the P.L.O., and they could start in on you.\"\n\nOnly one senator, Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, voted against the bill, and he did so in part because he thought that the lower standards of FISA investigations inadequately protected civil liberties. \"The law allows regular criminal investigations to be taken into this secret court, which frankly isn't much of a court at all,\" Feingold told me. \"It's the Attorney General's private playground.\"\n\nWhen it looked as though Congress would quickly pass the Administration's antiterrorism legislation, the difference between law-and-order conservatives and civil libertarians seemed straightforward enough. But, as it turned out, the terrorism debate shifted when a third group—the libertarian right—took a prominent role. Chertoff confronted this development in September, when he appeared before the House Judiciary Committee, testifying about one of the less controversial sections of the antiterrorism bill, covering orders for pen registers and trap-and-traces. (A pen register identifies all outgoing numbers called by a given telephone; a trap-and-trace identifies the phone numbers of incoming callers, much as caller I.D. does.) Prosecutors have long been able to obtain such orders as a matter of course; the new law seeks to take account of technological advances such as E-mail and other Internet communications.\n\nBob Goodlatte, a conservative Republican from Virginia, had a question about E-mail. \"I'm concerned that the terms 'routing' and 'addressing' need to be clarified to show that the intention of acquiring information about each message is limited to the destination or the termination of such communication\"—and does not include any sort of content. Chertoff tried to reassure Goodlatte. \"What we're looking for is addresses and information that tells us who sent the material and where the sender is addressing the material. We're not looking to get into content.\" If the government wants to examine the content of E-mail, Chertoff explained, a judge will require far more evidence of possible criminality than that required for a pen register or a trap-and-trace.\n\nWhat Chertoff and, later, Ashcroft discovered was that House Republicans—as much as the Democrats— wanted restrictions placed on the government's power to investigate. \"We fought the syndrome of presuming that we somehow have to cut back on the Bill of Rights in order to obtain security,\" Bob Barr, the Georgia Republican, told me. As different versions of the antiterrorism legislation moved through the Republican House and the Democratic Senate, the House produced a final draft that was considerably more sensitive to civil liberties than the version that came out of the Senate.\n\nRecognizing that some kind of legislation was going to pass, the House libertarian caucus settled on a mediating device—a \"sunset\" provision. After a given number of years, the law would automatically revert to its former status unless Congress reauthorized it. On the Senate side, Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who chairs the Judiciary Committee, decided to embrace the sunset provision when the bill came to a House-Senate conference, on October 17th. \"I like the sunset idea because the F.B.I. generally doesn't pay any attention to oversight from the Congress,\" Leahy told me. \"Now they can't go crazy, or we won't reauthorize the law.\" The sunset provision will also allow Congress to monitor possible excesses, such as whether the F.B.I. is focussing unduly on Arab-Americans or expanding its surveillance efforts beyond terrorism to investigations of other crimes.\n\nFor Chertoff, the sunset provision was a disappointment. \"I wish I could say that the sun will set on terrorism in two or three or four years, but it's not, so there's no reason to put that kind of limit on the law,\" he said. The Bush White House fought the sunset provision to the end, but House Republicans made sure it remained in place. As Leahy recalled the negotiations, \"The White House sent this kid to talk about the sunset, and Hastert\"—House Speaker Dennis Hastert—\"sat there like Buddha listening to him. Finally, he said, 'You go back to the White House and tell them you made your pitch. But the sunset stays.' \" In the version passed by Congress, the changes in the law will expire in four years.\n\nEven with the sunset provision, Chertoff and the Administration got most of what they wanted, including the ability to obtain \"roving\" wiretaps on suspects who are travelling with cell phones or other mobile technology; expansion of pen registers and trap-and-traces to include new technology; and longer sentences for terrorism offenses. And law enforcement will be able to use material gained from FISA surveillance if foreign intelligence was \"a significant\" purpose of the original investigation. On another controversial provision, Congress modified an Administration proposal that would have allowed unlimited detention of aliens before the government had to specify charges against them; the legislators imposed a seven-day deadline for bringing charges. (Critics of the bill maintain that it still permits the indefinite detention of noncitizens who are suspected of being threats to national security.)\n\nBut, in the end, there was a surprising degree of consensus. \"There's no question that there has to be a cultural change,\" Chertoff told me. \"In some ways, the glamorous, high-profile cases are not going to be there—for the F.B.I. and for prosecutors. We don't necessarily need to convict people of a grand conspiracy if we can convict them of something straightforward and get them off the street right away.\" Morton Halperin does not seem troubled by that view. \"The basic problem with the F.B.I. is that it's in the business of investigating crime that has already taken place,\" he said. \"They have no culture of analysis or prevention.\"\n\nSeven weeks after the most murderous terrorist attack in American history, the government has made changes in the law which—at least in this first round of legislation—do not represent a wholesale retreat from civil liberties. \"We know what kind of moment this is, and we don't want what we did to be looked back on like it was internment or the Palmer raids,\" Chertoff told me. \"The lessons of history are not lost on us, but we have to adjust to realities that we have never faced before.\" ♦"
