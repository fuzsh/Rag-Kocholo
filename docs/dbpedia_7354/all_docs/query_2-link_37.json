This second consecutive win at the Supreme Court over the same group challenging our state’s election laws illustrates how Arkansas’s elected officials have passed laws that stand up to scrutiny.\n\n“I congratulate Assistant Attorney General Justin Brascher, who successfully litigated this matter, as well as Deputy Solicitor General Dylan Jacobs and Assistant Solicitor General Michael Cantrell for their assistance on securing this unanimous decision.”\n\nTo read the decision, click here.\n\nFor a printer-friendly version of this release, click here.\n\nAbout Attorney General Tim Griffin\n\nTim Griffin was sworn in as the 57th Attorney General of Arkansas on January 10, 2023, having\n\npreviously served as the state’s 20th Lieutenant Governor from 2015-2023.
