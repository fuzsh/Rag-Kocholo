Bush\n\nDuring the 107th-109th Congresses\n\nUpdated January 23, 2007\n\nDenis Steven Rutkus\n\nSpecialist in American National Government\n\nGovernment and Finance Division\n\nKevin M. Scott\n\nAnalyst in American National Government\n\nGovernment and Finance Division\n\nMaureen Bearden\n\nInformation Research Specialist\n\nKnowledge Services Group\n\nU.S. Circuit and District Court Nominations by\n\nPresident George W. Bush\n\nDuring the 107th - 109th Congresses\n\nSummary\n\nDuring his presidency, as of the final adjournment of the 109th Congress, 51 of\n\nPresident George W. Bushâs 68 nominees to the U.S. circuit courts of appeals\n\nreceived Senate confirmation. Of the 17 nominees not confirmed, the nominations\n\nof three were withdrawn by the President, and the remaining 14 were returned at the\n\nend of a Congress; however, four of the 14, after having their nominations returned\n\nat the end of the 109th Congress, were renominated at the start of the 110th Congress.\n\nNone of President Bushâs circuit nominees has been rejected in a Senate confirmation\n\nvote. Two were defeated in committee votes, in the 107th Congress, although both\n\nwere renominated in the 108th Congress, where one was confirmed.\n\nIn the 108th Congress, the Senate could not agree to close debate on 10 circuit\n\ncourt nominees. Following controversy over the propriety of filibusters on judicial\n\nnominations, a compromise was reached in the 109th Congress which resulted in\n\nconfirmation votes for five of the 10 nominees. The other five, however, failed to\n\ngain confirmation. Two of the 10 nominees were given temporary recess\n\nappointments by President Bush. After the appointment of one of these nominees\n\nexpired at the end of the Congress, he was not renominated in the 109th Congress.\n\nThe other recess appointee, prior to the expiration of his appointment, was\n\nrenominated in the 109th Congress and subsequently confirmed.\n\nOf President Bushâs 237 nominees to the U.S. district courts, through the end\n\nof the 109th Congress, 206 were confirmed (185 in the first Congress in which they\n\nwere nominated). Of the 31 not confirmed, the nominations of three were withdrawn,\n\nand the other 28 were returned at the end of the 109th Congress. Twenty-four of the\n\n28 had been renominated in the 110th Congress, as of January 19, 2007. None of\n\nPresident Bushâs district court nominees was defeated in a committee vote or\n\nrejected in a Senate confirmation vote.\n\nPresident Bushâs circuit nominees, like those of most other recent Presidents,\n\nhave had more difficulty than his district nominees in receiving Senate confirmation.\n\nAs of the close of the 109th Congress, 75.0% of his circuit nominees had been\n\nconfirmed, compared with 86.9% of his district nominees. The average (mean) time\n\nelapsed between first nomination and confirmation for his circuit nominees was 366\n\ndays, more than twice as much as the corresponding time interval of 171 days for\n\ndistrict nominees. With recent presidencies, the average time taken for circuit\n\nnominees to be confirmed has risen steadily â from an average time of 68 days, 104\n\ndays, 249 days, and 366 days, respectively for the circuit nominees of Presidents\n\nRonald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, William J. Clinton, and George W. Bush. With\n\nrecent presidencies, a steady, but less dramatic rise has also occurred in the average\n\ntime taken for district nominees to be confirmed.\n\nThis report will be updated upon the final adjournment of the 110th Congress.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\n\nThe Judicial Appointment Process . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\n\nStructure and Contents of the Nominee and Nominations Tables . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n\nNominee Tables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\n\nNominations Tables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n\nStatistical Findings from the Tables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n\nCircuit Court Nominees During the Presidency of George W.

Bush\n\nDuring the 107th-109th Congresses\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn recent years, the process by which lower federal court judges are nominated\n\nby the President and confirmed by the Senate has been of increasing interest to\n\nCongress. In order to provide Congress with a continuing overview of this process,\n\nthis report provides statistics on all of President George W. Bushâs nominations to\n\nU.S. courts of appeals and U.S. district courts during the 107th, 108th, and 109th\n\nCongresses, and any actions taken on these nominations by the Senate Judiciary\n\nCommittee and the full Senate.1\n\nU.S. courts of appeals review appeals from federal trial court opinions and are\n\nempowered to review and enforce the orders of many administrative agencies. Cases\n\npresented to these courts are generally considered by judges sitting in three-member\n\npanels. Altogether, 179 permanent appellate court judgeships are authorized by law.\n\nCourts within the courts of appeals system are often called âcircuit courts,â because\n\nthey are divided into 12 geographic circuits and an additional nationwide circuit\n\nhaving specialized subject matter jurisdiction. In this report, nominations to U.S.\n\ncourts of appeals judgeships are referred to as âcircuit court nominations.â\n\nU.S. district courts are the trial courts of general federal jurisdiction. Each state\n\nhas at least one district court, while some states have as many as four. There are 678\n\ndistrict court judgeships authorized by law, including those for the District of\n\nColumbia, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands,\n\nand the territories of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.2\n\n1 This report is in keeping with earlier CRS reports which tracked actions taken on judicial\n\nnominations by other recent Presidents. See CRS Report 98-510, Judicial Nominations by\n\nPresident Clinton During the 103rd-106th Congresses, by Denis Steven Rutkus, and CRS\n\nReport 93-395, President [George H. W.] Bushâs Judicial Nominations During the 101st-\n\n102nd Congresses, by Denis Steven Rutkus.\n\n2 The 678 total consists of 667 permanently authorized judgeships and 11 âtemporaryâ\n\njudgeships (which, pursuant to statute, temporarily increase the number of judgeships for\n\nspecified judicial districts, with these districts reverting back to the permanently authorized\n\nnumber of judgeships at a future time fixed by the statute â typically, when, after a\n\nspecified number of years, a judgeship in the district is vacated). All but four of the 678\n\njudgeships entail lifetime appointments. The four exceptions are the one judgeship each\n\nin Guam and the Northern Marianas, and the two in the Virgin Islands, to which judges are\n\nappointed for 10-year terms.\n\nCRS-2\n\nPresident Bushâs nominations to these two court systems are listed in eight\n\nappendix tables at the end of this report â Appendices 1-4 for circuit court\n\nnominations, and Appendices 5-8 for district court nominations. Appendices 1 and\n\n5 list all the persons nominated by President Bush during his presidency, as of\n\nDecember 9, 2006,3 to the circuit and district courts, respectively. The other six\n\ntables list all of the circuit and district court nominations made by President Bush\n\nduring each Congress, â Appendices 2, 3, and 4 for circuit court nominations in the\n\n107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses, respectively; and Appendices 6, 7, and 8 for\n\ndistrict court nominations in the same respective Congresses.\n\nAppendices 1-8, it should be emphasized, account for every instance in which\n\na district or circuit court nomination was made, including renominations of\n\nindividuals to the same judgeship. As discussed below, some of President Bushâs\n\nnominees were nominated to a circuit or district judgeship more than once within a\n\nCongress, or nominated to the judgeship in more than one Congress. Accordingly,\n\ndiscussion in this report regarding the number of nominations made by President\n\nBush to the circuit or district courts counts not only the initial nomination of a person\n\nto a judgeship but any renominations as well. By contrast, discussion regarding the\n\nactual number of persons nominated (or nominees) counts individual nominees only\n\nonce, even if they were nominated to the same judgeship more than once.\n\nWithin the text of this report are various statistical tables and bar graphs, using\n\ndata derived from Appendices 1-8. Table 1 presents, for President Bushâs circuit\n\nand district nominees, the average and median number of days that elapsed from their\n\nfirst nomination to disposition of their last nomination. Table 2 breaks down the\n\ntotal number of persons nominated by President Bush to circuit and district court\n\njudgeships by the number of Congresses in which they were nominated. Table 3\n\nprovides statistics comparing President Bushâs judicial nominations with those of his\n\nfour immediate predecessors in the White House. Table 3 shows, among other\n\nthings, the total number of persons nominated by President Bush â as well as by\n\neach of the four previous Presidents â to district and circuit court judgeships and the\n\nnumber and percentage of them who were confirmed. Figures 1 and 2 show, for\n\ncircuit and district nominations respectively, the average number of days that elapsed\n\nfrom nomination date to confirmation, during each Congress from the 95th to the\n\n109th, indicating which presidency coincided in time with each Congress. Figures\n\n3 and 4 show, respectively, for the circuit and district court nominees of the five most\n\nrecent Presidents, the average number of days that elapsed from their first nomination\n\nto final disposition of their last nomination.\n\nThe following text provides (1) a brief overview of the principal steps in the\n\njudicial appointment process; (2) a more detailed description of the structure and\n\ncontents of Appendices 1-8 and the methodology used in gathering the tabular data;\n\nand (3) a discussion of selected appointment statistics for circuit and district court\n\nnominees and nominations in the 107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses, which are\n\nderived from, or presented in, the appendices.4\n\n3 December 9, 2006, is the date of final adjournment of the 109th Congress.\n\n4 The statistics include total number of nominees to district and circuit judgeships; number\n\nof nominees confirmed; number of nominations (including re-nominations of nominees);\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-3\n\nThis report focuses on judicial nominations made by the President and on Senate\n\nactions taken on the nominations by the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate.\n\nOn rare occasions, appointments to federal courts also have been made without\n\nsubmitting a nomination to the Senate, when a President exercises his constitutional\n\npower to make ârecess appointments.â Specifically, Article II, Section 2, clause 3\n\nof the Constitution of the United States empowers the President to âfill up all\n\nVacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting\n\nCommissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.â5 President Bush\n\nthus far during his presidency has made two recess appointments to circuit courts and\n\nnone to district courts.6\n\nThe Judicial Appointment Process\n\nUnder the Constitution of the United States, the President and the Senate share\n\nthe responsibility for filling vacancies within the federal judiciary.7 While it is the\n\nPresident who nominates persons to fill federal judgeships, the appointment of each\n\nnominee also requires Senate confirmation. Although not mentioned in the\n\nConstitution, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary also plays an important role\n\nmidway in the process â after the President selects, but before the Senate as a whole\n\nconsiders, the nominee.\n\nThe process for making lifetime appointments to U.S. district court and circuit\n\ncourts of appeals judgeships entails the same formal steps as those involved in the\n\n4 (...continued)\n\nnumber receiving committee hearings, committee votes, and Senate or other final action; and\n\naverage time taken to conduct hearings, committee votes, and Senate votes on the\n\nnominations. Careful distinction is made in the text between number of nominations\n\n(including renominations) and number of persons actually nominated.\n\n5 See CRS Report RS21308, Recess Appointments: Frequently Asked Questions, by Henry\n\nB. Hogue.\n\n6 On Jan. 26, 2004, President Bush recess-appointed Charles W. Pickering Sr. of Mississippi\n\nto the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Judge Pickeringâs appointment expired\n\non Dec. 8, 2004, at the end of the second session of the 108th Congress, and he retired. On\n\nFeb. 20, 2004, President Bush recess-appointed William H. Pryor Jr. of Alabama to the\n\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Pryorâs recess appointment was to last until the\n\nend of the first session of the 109th Congress; however, before that appointment expired,\n\nJudge Pryor was renominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate on June 9,\n\n2005.\n\nFor more information on judicial recess appointments, see CRS Report RS22039,\n\nFederal Recess Judges, by Louis Fisher; CRS Report RL33009, Recess Appointments: A\n\nLegal Overview, by T.J. Halstead; and Henry B. Hogue, âThe Law: Recess Appointments\n\nto Article III Courts,â Presidential Studies Quarterly, vol. 34, Sept. 2004, pp. 656-673.\n\n7 Article II, Section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution provides that the President âshall\n\nnominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint ... Judges of\n\nthe supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not\n\nherein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law....â\n\nCRS-4\n\nappointment of justices to the Supreme Court.8 The process officially begins when\n\nthe President selects someone to fill a judicial vacancy, submitting a nomination in\n\nwriting to the Senate. Usually on the same day it is received by the Senate, the\n\nnomination is referred to the Committee on the Judiciary (the Senate committee\n\nhaving jurisdiction over district and circuit, as well as most other federal, court\n\nnominations). The Judiciary Committee then holds a hearing on the nomination.\n\nThe committee subsequently meets to vote on whether to report the nomination to the\n\nfull Senate. A committee vote to report (even a vote to report with an unfavorable\n\nrecommendation) sends the nomination forward to be considered by the Senate as a\n\nwhole, while a vote against reporting (historically, a very rare occurrence) prevents\n\nthe nomination from going forward, and in effect defeats the nomination in\n\ncommittee. The final step in the appointment process occurs when the Senate votes\n\nto confirm or disapprove the nomination. A vote to confirm requires a simple\n\nmajority of Senators present and voting. If the Senate votes in the negative on\n\nwhether to confirm, the nomination is defeated, and a resolution of disapproval is\n\nforwarded to the President.\n\nAs with nominations in general, judicial nominations sometimes fail to advance\n\nthrough each procedural step in the appointment process. After referral to\n\ncommittee, a nomination might not receive a hearing or, after receiving a hearing,\n\nmight not receive a committee vote on whether it should be reported. Even if\n\nfavorably reported by committee, the nomination might not receive a vote by the\n\nSenate on whether to confirm. A nomination, for instance, will not, under Senate\n\nrules, receive a vote on whether to confirm if some Senators oppose taking such a\n\nvote and a âsuper-majorityâ of three-fifths of the full membership of the Senate fails\n\nto vote in favor of a motion to close debate on the nomination.9 If it fails to receive\n\na Senate vote, the nomination ultimately will be either withdrawn by the President\n\nor returned to the President by the Secretary of the Senate upon a Senate adjournment\n\nor recess of more than 30 days.10\n\n8 See CRS Report RL31989, Supreme Court Appointment Process: Roles of the President,\n\nJudiciary Committee, and Senate, by Denis Steven Rutkus; and CRS Report RL31980,\n\nConsideration of Presidential Nominations: Committee and Floor Procedure, by Elizabeth\n\nRybicki.\n\n9 See CRS Report RL32878, Cloture Attempts on Nominations, by Richard S. Beth and\n\nBetsy Palmer.\n\n10 Rule XXXI, paragraph 6, Standing Rules of the Senate, provides, in part, that âif the\n\nSenate shall adjourn or take a recess for more than thirty days, all nominations pending and\n\nnot finally acted upon at the time of taking such adjournment or recess shall be returned by\n\nthe Secretary to the President and shall not again be considered unless they shall again be\n\nmade to the Senate by the President.â\n\nCRS-5\n\nStructure and Contents of the Nominee and\n\nNominations Tables\n\nThe tables at the end of this report, Appendices 1-8, were generated from a CRS\n\ndatabase of nomination dates and actions created by Kevin M. Scott, CRS Analyst\n\nin American National Government.11 The data for the CRS database were collected\n\nprimarily from the Presidential Nominations database in the Legislative Information\n\nSystem of the U.S. Congress (LIS)12 and from daily editions of volumes 147-152 of\n\nthe Congressional Record (for the years 2001-2006).\n\nNominee Tables\n\nAs noted previously, Appendices 1 and 5 list, alphabetically, the names of all\n\npersons nominated by George W. Bush during his presidency (through the end of the\n\n109th Congress) to the circuit courts and to the district courts. These tables show the\n\nfollowing for each nominee:\n\n! how often and when the person was nominated to a particular\n\njudgeship;\n\n! dates of committee hearings and committee action on all\n\nnominations;\n\n! whether and when the nominee was confirmed;\n\n! if confirmed, the number of days that elapsed between the date of the\n\nfirst nomination and the confirmation;\n\n! the outcome of the personâs most recent nomination, if the final\n\ndisposition was not one of confirmation;13\n\n! if not confirmed, the number of days that elapsed between the date of\n\nthe personâs first nomination and the final outcome of the personâs\n\nmost recent nomination.\n\nThe tables at the end also present, for all confirmed nominees, the average\n\nnumber of days that elapsed between their first nomination and their confirmation, and\n\nfor all unconfirmed nominees, the average number of days that elapsed between their\n\nfirst nomination and final disposition of their most recent nomination.\n\n11 The database was created in part with the benefit of earlier nominations research\n\n(conducted for previous versions of this report) by Mitchel A. Sollenberger, former CRS\n\nAnalyst in American National Government.\n\n12 Available at [http://www.congress.gov/nomis/search.html]. The Presidential Nominations\n\ndatabase, covering the 97th through the 109th Congresses, provides for each nomination the\n\nname of the nominee, nomineeâs state of residence, appointive position, date of nomination,\n\nhearing date, date of committee vote, date of Senate action, and type of Senate vote\n\n(including roll call vote numbers).\n\n13 For each nominee not confirmed as of the close of the 109th Congress, his or her last\n\nnomination was either (1) returned to the President when the Senate adjourned for, or took\n\na recess of, more than 30 days, or (2) withdrawn by the President. Columns in Appendices\n\n1 and 5 indicate the last nominations of nominees which were returned or withdrawn, the\n\ndates of such actions, and the Congress in which the actions occurred.\n\nCRS-6\n\nAppendices 1 and 5 show all of the persons nominated by President Bush to the\n\ncircuit and district courts. These tables, however, do not provide comprehensive\n\ninformation on committee and full Senate actions taken on these individualsâ\n\nnominations â such as Senate procedural votes and roll call votes on their\n\nnominations, where Senate votes were by roll call. Detailed information of this sort\n\nis provided in Appendices 2-4 (for circuit nominations) and 6-8 (for district\n\nnominations).\n\nNominations Tables\n\nThe first six years of the presidency of George W. Bush roughly coincided in\n\ntime with three Congresses â the 107th Congress (2001-2002), the 108th (2003-2004),\n\nand the 109th (2005-2006). Six tables list all of the circuit and district court\n\nnominations made by President Bush during each of the three Congresses, and any\n\ncommittee or Senate actions taken on the nominations. Appendices 2, 3, and 4\n\nprovide this information for circuit court nominations in the 107th, 108th, and 109th\n\nCongresses, respectively, and Appendices 6, 7, and 8 do so for district court\n\nnominations in the same respective Congresses.14\n\nNominations in all six of these tables are listed in chronological order according\n\nto the date on which each nomination was received by the Senate. The tables show\n\nhow far along each nomination progressed in the appointment process and how many\n\ndays elapsed in the process. The procedural progress of each nomination is shown by\n\nseparate columns which indicate, respectively, the date on which any of the following\n\noccurred:\n\n! the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the nomination;\n\n! the Judiciary Committee voted to report or take other action on the\n\nnomination;\n\n! the Senate voted for confirmation, or some other action occurred.\n\nIn the âfinal actionâ column, a date by itself indicates that the Senate confirmed\n\nthe nominee by voice vote or by unanimous consent. A confirmation date with a vote\n\ntally underneath indicates that Senate confirmation was by a roll call vote. This\n\ncolumn also shows the final disposition of nominations failing to receive Senate\n\nconfirmation. An entry of âReturned, 11/20/02,â for example, indicates that the\n\nnomination was returned to the President on November 20, 2002 (upon the final\n\nadjournment of the 107th Congress).15 An entry of âWithdrawn 03/19/01,â as another\n\nexample, indicates that, on that date, the nomination was withdrawn by the\n\n14 Appendix 2 excludes from its listing nine circuit court nominations submitted at the start\n\nof the 107th Congress by outgoing President William J. Clinton. These nominations were\n\nsubmitted at the very beginning of the 107th Congress but in the final weeks of President\n\nClintonâs second term. All nine of these nominations were withdrawn by President Bush\n\non Mar. 19, 2001, although one of the nine nominees, Roger L. Gregory of Virginia, was\n\nrenominated by President Bush on May 9, 2001, and confirmed by the Senate on July 20,\n\n2001.\n\n15 Each such return occurs pursuant to Senate Rule XXXI, paragraph 6, which, as explained\n\nearlier, provides for nominations to be returned to the President if the Senate adjourns or\n\ntakes a recess for more than 30 days.\n\nCRS-7\n\nPresident.16 The dates and roll call votes of other procedural actions affecting\n\nnominations, such as motions to close debate, also have been entered in the âfinal\n\nactionâ column.\n\nThe tables also show, for each nomination, the length of time that passed before\n\na committee hearing, committee vote, or final action took place. For each nomination,\n\nseparate columns present the number of days which elapsed between the Senateâs\n\nreceipt of the nomination and the dates on which it received a hearing, committee\n\nvote, or Senate vote. Also, at the bottom of each of these three columns, the tables\n\nshow the average number of days which elapsed between the Presidentâs submission\n\nof judicial nominations to the Senate and the dates on which the nominations received\n\nhearings, committee votes, or Senate votes. Each elapsed time average is shown in\n\ntwo forms â as the mean number, and as the median number, of elapsed days.17\n\nAlthough the arithmetic mean is the true âaverageâ number, it has the disadvantage\n\nof being skewed by extremely high or low values in a distribution of numbers.\n\nâLoosely speaking,â one statistician has noted, âthe median corresponds more closely\n\nthan the mean to the middle of a distribution [of a group of numbers]. It is unaffected\n\nby extreme values.â18\n\n16 A President may withdraw a nomination for any number of reasons. The Mar. 19, 2001,\n\nwithdrawal by President Bush of nine nominations submitted earlier by President William\n\nJ. Clinton, mentioned in a table note to Appendix 2, was in keeping with the usual practice\n\nof incoming Presidents to withdraw pending nominations submitted by their predecessors.\n\nPresidents also sometimes withdraw their own nominations. A President might do so, for\n\nexample, if the Senate committee to which the nomination has been referred either has voted\n\nagainst reporting the nomination to the Senate, or has made clear its intention not to act on\n\nthe nomination; if the nomination, even if reported, is likely to face substantial opposition\n\non the Senate floor; or if the nominee has requested that the nomination be withdrawn. By\n\nthe end of the 109th Congress, President Bush had withdrawn three of his circuit nominations\n\nand three of his district court nominations. See, in Appendix 3, the Jan. 7, 2003, circuit\n\ncourt nomination of Miguel A. Estrada, which, at the nomineeâs request, was withdrawn\n\nby the President on Sept. 4, 2003, following seven unsuccessful votes in the Senate by\n\nEstrada supporters to close debate on the nomination; in Appendix 4, the Feb. 14, 2005,\n\ncircuit court nomination of Henry W. Saad, which was withdrawn on Mar. 27, 2006, and the\n\nSept. 29, 2005, circuit court nomination of James H. Payne, which was withdrawn on Mar.\n\n7, 2006; in Appendix 7, the Jan. 7, 2003, district nomination of Frederick W. Rohlfing III,\n\nwhich was withdrawn on May 6, 2004; and, in Appendix 8, the Feb. 14, 2005, district\n\nnomination of Daniel P. Ryan, which was withdrawn on Mar. 30, 2006, and the Feb. 14,\n\n2006, district nomination of Jerome A. Holmes, which was withdrawn on May 4, 2006.\n\n17 The mean number is the sum of the number of elapsed days for all of the nominations in\n\nquestion divided by the number of those nominations. The median number is either (1) the\n\nelapsed number of days for the nomination in the middle of the distribution of all the\n\nnominations in question, with an equal number of the nominations having longer elapsed\n\ntimes than that nomination, and an equal number of nominations having shorter elapsed\n\ntimes; or (2) the mean of the elapsed number of days for the two nominations in the middle\n\nof the distribution if there is no one middle nomination.\n\n18 William H. Greene, Econometric Analysis, 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall,\n\n2003), p. 847. For an introduction to median versus mean and arguments surrounding when\n\neach should be used, see chapter 3 in Alan Agresti and Barbara Finlay, Statistical Methods\n\nfor the Social Sciences, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1997).\n\nCRS-8\n\nThe time averages presented in Appendices 2-4 and Appendices 6-8 are\n\ncalculated from time-elapsed data for specific nominations, as opposed to overall time\n\nan individual might have been in nominee status. Thus, in the case of an individual\n\nnominated twice to the same judgeship, time-elapsed data are counted separately for\n\neach nomination â rather than, for instance, measuring the time between a nomineeâs\n\nfirst nomination and any action (hearing, committee vote, or Senate vote) on the\n\nnomineeâs second nomination. A nomination not receiving a committee hearing,\n\ncommittee vote, or Senate vote is excluded from the calculation of average time\n\nbetween the nomination date and this particular procedural step. Also, three\n\nnominations in which nominees received hearings were, nevertheless, excluded from\n\nthe calculations of average time between nomination and hearing because the hearings\n\nin all three instances preceded the nomination dates.19\n\nAs noted above, some individuals were nominated more than once to a judgeship\n\nwithin the same Congress. Appendix 2 includes 20 circuit court nominations,\n\nsubmitted by President Bush during the 107th Congress, between May 9 and August\n\n2, 2001, which the Senate returned to the President on August 3, 2001, at the start of\n\nthe Senateâs August 2001 recess, pursuant to Senate Rule XXXI.20 Appendix 6\n\nincludes 20 district court nominations submitted by President Bush during the107th\n\nCongress, between June 18 and August 2, 2001, which the Senate returned at the start\n\nof its August 2001 recess. When the Senate reconvened on September 4, 2001,\n\nPresident Bush renominated all 40 of the individuals involved.21 Similarly, footnotes\n\nto the initial 20 circuit and 20 district court nominations that were returned to the\n\nPresident indicate that the nominees in question were later renominated. In the 108th\n\nand 109th Congresses, several additional nominees were renominated at least once in\n\nthe same Congress. In the 108th Congress, three individuals were nominated twice.22\n\n19 In Appendix 2, see circuit court nomination of Sharon Prost on Sept. 4, 2001; in\n\nanticipation of this nomination, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing for Ms. Prost on\n\nAug. 27, 2001. In Appendix 5, see district court nominations of Reggie B. Walton and\n\nTerry L. Wooten on Sept. 4, 2001; in anticipation of these nominations, the Judiciary\n\nCommittee held a hearing for Walton on Aug. 22, 2001, and a hearing for Wooten on Aug.\n\n27, 2001.\n\n20 As noted earlier, Senate Rule XXXI, paragraph 6, provides that nominations pending in\n\nthe Senate at the time that the Senate adjourns or takes a recess of more than 30 days shall\n\nbe returned to the President. Usually, but not always, the Senate, before starting a recess\n\nof more than 30 days, waives this rule by unanimous consent, allowing pending nominations\n\nto remain in âstatus quoâ and continue to be pending in the Senate after it reconvenes.\n\nSometimes, however, when Rule XXXI, paragraph 6, is not waived, nominations, pursuant\n\nto the rule, are returned to the President and can only be considered again if they are\n\nresubmitted by the President.\n\n21 Footnotes to each of these âresubmittedâ nominations are provided, indicating that the\n\nnominees had been nominated earlier to the same judgeships.\n\n22 In the 108th Congress, as Appendix 3 reveals, three persons were nominated more than\n\nonce to circuit judgeships; Claude A. Allen of Virginia was nominated to the Fourth Circuit\n\non Apr. 28, 2003, and Jan. 20, 2004; Charles W. Pickering Sr. of Mississippi was nominated\n\nto the Fifth Circuit on Jan. 7, 2003, and Feb. 6, 2004; William H. Pryor Jr. of Alabama was\n\nnominated to the Eleventh Circuit on Apr. 9, 2003, and Mar. 12, 2004. For both Pickering\n\nand Pryor, the second nomination in the 108th Congress was to a life term to the position to\n\nwhich they had been recess-appointed earlier in that same Congress.\n\nCRS-9\n\nIn the 109th Congress, five individuals were nominated three times following returns\n\nas the Senate went into recess in August and again in September.23\n\nSeveral of President Bushâs judicial nominees also have been nominated in more\n\nthan one Congress. Appendix 3, for example, shows that the first 14 circuit court\n\nnominations in the 108th Congress were of individuals previously nominated in the\n\n107th Congress. Likewise, Appendix 7 shows that the first 15 district court\n\nnominations in the 108th Congress were of individuals previously nominated in the\n\n107th Congress.24\n\nMore recently, in the 109th Congress, President Bushâs first 20 judicial\n\nnominations were all resubmissions from the 108th Congress. Submitted on February\n\n14, 2005, the 20 resubmissions involved 12 circuit nominees and eight district court\n\nnominees who had earlier nominations returned to the President at the final\n\nadjournment of the 108th Congress.25 Moreover, six of the 12 circuit nominees had\n\nbeen nominated in two prior Congresses â in the 107th as well as in the 108th â as\n\nhad two of the eight district court nominees.26\n\n23 See, in Appendix 4, the Feb. 14, 2005, Sept. 5, 2006, and Nov. 15, 2006, nominations of\n\nTerrence W. Boyle of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit, William G. Myers III of Idaho\n\nto the Ninth Circuit, and William J. Haynes II, of Virginia, also to the Fourth Circuit; the\n\nDec, 16, 2005, Sept. 5, 2006, and Nov. 15, 2006, nominations of N. Randy Smith of Idaho\n\nto the Ninth Circuit; and the Feb. 8, 2006, Sept. 5, 2006, and Nov. 15, 2006, nominations\n\nof Michael B. Wallace of Mississippi to the Fifth Circuit.\n\n24 All of these resubmitted nominations are footnoted in Appendices 3 and 7 to indicate that\n\nthe persons involved also had been nominated in the 107th Congress.\n\n25 All of the nominations returned at the end of the 108th Congress which were resubmitted\n\nin the 109th Congress have footnotes in Appendices 3 and 7 to indicate that fact.\n\n26 See in Appendices 2 and 3 the circuit court nominations in the 107th and 108th Congresses\n\nof Terrence W. Boyle, Priscilla R. Owen, Richard A. Griffin, David W. McKeague, Susan\n\nB. Neilson, and Henry W. Saad. See in Appendices 6 and 7 the district court nominations\n\nin the 107th and 108th Congresses of Thomas L. Ludington and James C. Dever III.\n\nCRS-10\n\nStatistical Findings from the Tables\n\nCircuit Court Nominees During the Presidency\n\nof George W. Bush\n\nBetween January 20, 2001, and December 9, 2006, 51 of President George W.\n\nBushâs 68 nominees to the U.S. circuit courts received Senate confirmation.27 Of the\n\n17 nominees not confirmed, the nominations of three were withdrawn by the\n\nPresident,28 and the remaining 14 were returned at the end of a Congress.29 Four of\n\nthe 14, after having their nominations returned at the end of the 109th Congress, were\n\nrenominated at the start of the110th Congress.30\n\nNominees Failing to Receive Senate Votes after Unsuccessful\n\nCloture Motions. None of President Bushâs circuit court nominees has been\n\nrejected by the Senate on a vote of whether to confirm. However, in the 108th\n\nCongress, in the face of significant opposition to their nominations on the Senate\n\n27 Appendix 1 identifies all of President Bushâs confirmed circuit court nominees and their\n\nconfirmation dates, as of Dec. 9, 2006, listing the nominees in alphabetical order.\n\n28 See, in Appendix 3, the Jan. 7, 2003, nomination of Miguel A. Estrada of Virginia and,\n\nin Appendix 4, the Feb. 14, 2005, nomination of Henry W. Saad of Michigan and the Sept.\n\n29, 2005, nomination of James H. Payne of Oklahoma â all three of which subsequently\n\nwere withdrawn by President Bush.\n\n29 The nominations of eight of the 14 were returned at the end of a Congress and not\n\nresubmitted in a subsequent Congress. Specifically, the Oct. 8, 2001, nomination of\n\nWilliam H. Steele of Alabama (in Appendix 2) was returned to the President at the end of\n\nthe 107th Congress and not resubmitted in a subsequent Congress. The Jan. 7, 2003,\n\nnomination of Carolyn B. Kuhl of California, the Jan. 7, 2003, and Feb. 6, 2004,\n\nnominations of Charles W. Pickering Sr. of Mississippi, and the Jan. 20, 2004, nomination\n\nof Claude A. Allen of Virginia (all in Appendix 3) were returned to the President at the end\n\nof the 108th Congress and not resubmitted in the 109th Congress. The Nov. 15, 2006,i\n\nnominations of Terrence W. Boyle of North Carolina, William G. Myers III of Idaho,\n\nWilliam J. Haynes II of Virginia, and Michael B. Wallace of Mississippi (all in Appendix\n\n4) were returned at the end of the 109th Congress, and subsequent news accounts reported\n\nthat all four nominees had asked the President that they not be renominated in the 110th\n\nCongress. See Neil A. Lewis, âBush Drops Plans to Renominate 3 Judges,â New York\n\nTimes, Jan. 10, 2007, p. A18, and Seth Stern, âFifth Circuit Nominee Takes Himself Out of\n\nthe Running,â CQ Today, Dec. 26, 2006, available at [http://www.cq.com].\n\nThe nominations of two of the 14 (see in Appendices 1 and 4, the June 28, 2006,\n\nnominations to the Sixth Circuit of Raymond M. Kethledge of Michigan and Stephen J.\n\nMurphy II, both of Michigan), after being returned at the end of the 109th Congress, were\n\nreportedly, as of Jan. 9, 2007, under consideration for renomination in the 110th Congress.\n\nSee Ed Whelan, âRe: Court of Appeals Nominations,â Bench Memos, Jan. 9, 2007, available\n\nat [http://bench.nationalreview.com].\n\nThe nominations of four of the 14, as discussed in the next footnote, after being\n\nreturned at the end of the 109th Congress, were resubmitted at the beginning of the 110th\n\nCongress.\n\n30 As of Jan. 19, 2007, the four persons renominated to circuit judgeships in the 110th\n\nCongress were Thomas M. Hardiman, Peter D. Keisler, and Debra A. Livingston (all\n\nrenominated on Jan. 9, 2007), and N. Randy Smith (renominated on Jan. 16, 2007). See\n\nAppendices 1 and 4.\n\nCRS-11\n\nfloor, 10 circuit court nominees failed to receive final Senate votes after one or more\n\nmotions to close debate on their nominations proved unsuccessful.31 Subsequently,\n\nin the 109th Congress, following controversy over the propriety of filibusters on\n\njudicial nominations, a compromise was reached in the Senate,32 which resulted in\n\nconfirmation votes for five of those 10 circuit nominees.33 The five others among the\n\n10, however, ultimately failed to gain confirmation: the nomination of one of the five\n\nwas withdrawn in the 108th Congress (after seven unsuccessful votes on motions to\n\nclose debate);34 the nominations of two were returned at the end of the 108th Congress\n\nand were not followed by renomination in the 109th Congress;35 a renomination of the\n\nfourth was withdrawn in the 109th Congress;36 and the fifth nominee was renominated\n\nin the 109th Congress but was not renominated at the beginning of the 110th\n\nCongress.37\n\nRecess Appointments. Two of the 10 circuit nominees on whom the Senate\n\ncould not agree to close debate in the 108th Congress were, later in that Congress,\n\ngiven temporary recess appointments by President Bush. After the recess appointment\n\nof one of these nominees expired at the end of the 108th Congress, he was not re-\n\nnominated by President Bush in the 109th Congress.38 Prior to the expiration of the\n\n31 The Senate can close debate by passing a cloture motion, which requires a super-majority\n\nof three-fifths of the Senate, or 60 Members, voting in favor. During the 108th Congress,\n\nthe 10 nominations on which the Senate voted, on one or more occasions, not to close debate\n\nwere the Jan. 7, 2003, nominations of Miguel Estrada of Virginia, Richard A. Griffin of\n\nMichigan, Carolyn B. Kuhl of California, David W. McKeague of Michigan, Priscilla R.\n\nOwen of Texas, Charles W. Pickering Sr. of Mississippi, and Henry W. Saad of Michigan;\n\nthe Apr. 9, 2003, nomination of William H. Pryor Jr. of Alabama; the May 15, 2003,\n\nnomination of William G. Myers III of Idaho; and the July 25, 2003, nomination of Janice\n\nR. Brown of California. On each of these occasions, as Appendix 3 shows, the number of\n\nvotes needed to close debate fell short of 60.\n\n32 For an account of how this compromise was reached, as well as of the details of the\n\ncompromise, see David Nather, âThe Centrists Strike Back,â CQ Weekly, vol. 63, May 30,\n\n2005, p. 1420.\n\n33 See, in Appendix 4, the Feb. 14, 2005, nominations of Richard A. Griffin, David W.\n\nMcKeague, Priscilla R. Owen, William H. Pryor Jr., and Janice R. Brown â all\n\nsubsequently confirmed.\n\n34 See, in Appendix 3, the Jan. 7, 2003, nomination of Miguel A.

Saad.\n\n37 See, in Appendix 1, the nominations of William G. Myers III. Myers was renominated\n\nthree times in the 109th Congress, with each nomination returned to the President upon a\n\nSenate recess of more than 30 days (the last return occurring at the final adjournment of the\n\n109th Congress). Media accounts at the opening of the 110th Congress reported that\n\nPresident George W. Bush did not intend to resubmit Myers in the 110th Congress. See\n\nKeith Perine, âBush Pulls Plug on Doomed Judicial Nominations, but Differences Remain,â\n\nCQ Today News, Jan. 9, 2007, available at [http://www.cq.com].\n\n38 On Jan. 16, 2004, between the first and second sessions of the 108th Congress, Charles W.\n\nPickering Sr. of Mississippi (whose nomination in the 107th Congress had been rejected by\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-12\n\nother nomineeâs recess appointment, he was renominated by President Bush in the\n\n109th Congress and subsequently confirmed by the Senate.39\n\nNominees Defeated in Committee. Two of President Bushâs circuit\n\nnominations were defeated in committee votes. These defeats occurred when the\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee, in the 107th Congress, voted not to report their\n\nnominations to the Senate.40 The two nominees were renominated by President Bush\n\nin the 108th Congress and this time were reported out favorably by the Judiciary\n\nCommittee.41 However, they (along with eight other circuit nominees) failed to\n\nreceive final Senate votes in the 108th Congress, after motions to close debate on their\n\nnominations proved unsuccessful. Ultimately, one of the two nominees was\n\nrenominated in the 109th Congress and confirmed by the Senate in a 55-43 roll call\n\nvote.42 The other nominee was given a temporary recess appointment by President\n\nbetween the first and second sessions of the 108th Congress; at the end of that\n\nCongress, his recess appointment expired, and he was not renominated by President\n\nBush in the 109th Congress.43\n\nLength in Time of the Appointment Process. Appendix 1 reveals that\n\nPresident Bushâs circuit court nominees have varied considerably in how quickly they\n\nhave advanced through the appointment process.44 For some who were nominated\n\n38 (...continued)\n\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee) was recess appointed to the Fifth Circuit by President\n\nBush. The appointment expired on Dec. 8, 2004, at the end of the second session of the\n\n108th Congress. Judge Pickering retired at that time and was not renominated by President\n\nBush in the 109th Congress. In Appendix 3, see the Jan. 7, 2003, and Feb. 6, 2004,\n\nnominations of Judge Pickering, both of which were returned to the President on Dec. 8,\n\n2004.\n\n39 On Feb. 20, 2004, during a recess within the second session of the 108th Congress,\n\nWilliam H. Pryor Jr. of Alabama was recess appointed to the Eleventh Circuit by President\n\nBush. The appointment was to expire at the end of the Senateâs first session in the 109th\n\nCongress, the sine die adjournment of which occurred on Dec. 22, 2005. However, on Feb.\n\n14, 2005, early in the 109th Congress, Pryor was renominated by President Bush and\n\nconfirmed on June 9, 2005, more than six months before his recess appointment would have\n\nexpired. See, in Appendix 3, the Apr. 9, 2003, and Mar. 12, 2004, nominations of Pryor,\n\nboth of which were returned to the President on Dec. 8, 2004, and, in Appendix 4, the Feb.\n\n14, 2005, nomination, which was confirmed.\n\n40 See, in Appendix 2, the Sept. 4, 2001, nominations of Priscilla R. Owen of Texas and\n\nCharles W. Pickering Sr., of Mississippi, both to the Fifth Circuit. In the case of both\n\nnominations, the committee defeated successive motions to report favorably, to report\n\nwithout recommendation, and to report unfavorably (doing so with the Pickering nomination\n\non Mar. 14, 2002, and with the Owen nomination on Sept. 5, 2002).\n\n41 See, in Appendix 3, the Jan. 7, 2003, nominations of Priscilla R.

Owen.\n\n43 See above footnote regarding the Jan. 16, 2004, recess appointment of Charles W.\n\nPickering Sr. of Mississippi to the Fifth Circuit by President Bush.\n\n44 Specifically, it will be noted, the table shows, among other things, the number of days that\n\nelapsed from the date of each nomineeâs first nomination to the date of the final disposition\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-13\n\nmore than once to a circuit judgeship, the elapsed time between first nomination and\n\nfinal disposition on a subsequent nomination has extended over two or more\n\nCongresses. For other individuals, though, the overall appointment process was\n\nmuch briefer.\n\nSpecifically, Appendix 1 shows that, during the course of his presidency, 20 of\n\nGeorge W. Bushâs 68 circuit court nominees have been nominated in two or more\n\nCongresses â with 14 nominated in two Congresses, and six nominated in three\n\nsuccessive Congresses. Of the six nominated in three Congresses, four have been\n\nconfirmed,45 one was withdrawn,46 and the nomination of the sixth person was\n\nreturned at the end of the 109th Congress and was not resubmitted at the beginning of\n\nthe 110th Congress.47\n\nConfirmed Nominees. The longest interval between first nomination and\n\nconfirmation for a Bush circuit nominee was 1,477 days â slightly more than four\n\nyears.48 The least amount of elapsed time for a circuit nominee between first\n\nnomination and confirmation was 63 days.49 The bottom rows of Appendix 1 show\n\n44 (...continued)\n\nof the nomineeâs last nomination, as of the end of the 109th Congress.\n\n45 See the nominations of: Priscilla R. Owen to the Fifth Circuit on May 9, 2001, and Sept.\n\n4, 2001 (both in 107th Congress), Jan. 7, 2003 (108th Congress), and Feb. 14, 2005 (109th\n\nCongress) â the last confirmed on May 25, 2005; David W. McKeague to the Sixth Circuit\n\non Nov. 8, 2001 (107th Congress), Jan. 7, 2003 (108th Congress), and Feb. 14, 2005 (109th\n\nCongress) â the last confirmed on June 9, 2004; Susan B. Neilson to the Sixth Circuit on\n\nNov. 8, 2001 (107th Congress), Jan. 7, 2003 (108th Congress), and Feb. 14, 2005 (109th\n\nCongress) â - the last confirmed on Oct. 27, 2005; and Richard A.

Saad to the Sixth Circuit on Nov. 8, 2001 (107th\n\nCongress), Jan. 8, 2003 (108th Congress), and Feb. 14, 2005 (109th Congress). The last\n\nnomination was withdrawn on Mar. 27, 2006.\n\n47 See the nominations of Terrence W. Boyle to the Fourth Circuit on May 9, 2001, and Sept.\n\n4, 2001 (both in the 107th Congress), Jan. 7, 2003 (108th Congress), and Feb. 14, 2005, Sept.\n\n5, 2006, and Nov. 15, 2006 (all in the 109th Congress).\n\n48 See again, in Appendix 1, nominee Priscilla R. Owen, first nominated on May 9, 2001,\n\nand confirmed on May 25, 2005. The circuit nominees with the next highest number of days\n\nelapsed between their first nomination and confirmation were the other three nominees,\n\nmentioned above, who were confirmed after being nominated in three straight Congresses:\n\nSusan B. Neilson (1,449 days â first nominated Nov. 8, 2001), David W. McKeague (1,309\n\ndays â first nominated Nov. 8, 2001), and Richard A. Griffin (1,079 days â first\n\nnominated June 26, 2002).\n\n49 See in Appendix 1 the nomination of Bobby E. Shepherd to the Eighth Circuit on May\n\n18, 2006, which was confirmed on July 20, 2006. The circuit nominees with the next-fewest\n\nnumber of days of elapsed time between their first (and only) nomination and confirmation\n\nwere Michael A. Chagares to the Third Circuit (69 days â nominated Jan. 25, 2006),\n\nWilliam J. Riley to the Eighth Circuit (71 days â nominated May 23, 2001), and Roger L.\n\nGregory to the Fourth Circuit (72 days â nominated May 9, 2001). It should be noted that\n\nGregory had been nominated twice earlier by President William J. Clinton â with the\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-14\n\nthat for President Bushâs 51 circuit nominees confirmed, the average elapsed time\n\nbetween first nomination and final disposition was 366 days. This average, or mean,\n\nwas arrived at by summing the number of days between first nomination and\n\nconfirmation for all 51 nominees in question, and then dividing by 51. However, the\n\nmedian elapsed time (i.e., the time interval for the nominee in the midpoint of the\n\ndistribution of the 51 confirmed nominees) was significantly less â 216 days. In\n\nother words, for 25 of the 51 confirmed circuit nominees, the elapsed time between\n\nfirst nomination and confirmation was less than 216 days; for one nominee, in the\n\nmidpoint of the distribution, the elapsed time was exactly 216 days;50 and for 25\n\nothers, the elapsed time was more than 216 days.51\n\nWithdrawn or Returned Nominees. As discussed above,52 17 other circuit\n\ncourt nominees, as of the end of the 109th Congress, saw their most recent\n\nnominations withdrawn by the President or returned to the President. Among the 17\n\nnominees, the most elapsed time between first nomination and final disposition of last\n\nnomination was 2,040 days,53 whereas the least elapsed time for this interval was 87\n\ndays.54 The mean elapsed time for the relatively small number of nominees in this\n\ncategory was 710 days, and the median elapsed time was 407 days.55\n\nPresident Bushâs Circuit Court Nominations\n\nDuring Particular Congresses\n\n49 (...continued)\n\nsecond nomination occurring in the last days of the Clinton presidency â and that President\n\nBush, upon assuming office, withdrew that second nomination, only to renominate Gregory\n\nhimself on May 9, 2001. However, Appendix 1 lists the May 9, 2001, nomination as not\n\nthe second or third, but the first and only nomination, of Gregory, because it is a table\n\ndevoted exclusively to President Bushâs circuit court nominees.\n\n50 See, in Appendix 1, the nomination of Michael J. Melloy to the Eighth Circuit. Melloy\n\nwas first nominated on July 10, 2001. That nomination was returned by the Senate on\n\nAugust 3, 2001. Melloy was renominated on Sept. 4, 2001, and confirmed on Feb. 11, 2002\n\nâ a nomination-to-confirmation time interval of 216 days.\n\n51 The mean (366 days) was much higher than the median (216 days) because the amount\n\nof time elapsed between certain nomineesâ first nominations and their confirmation dates\n\nwas markedly higher than nearly all other nominees. See in particular nominees Priscilla\n\nR. Owen (elapsed time 1,477 days), Susan B. Neilson (1,449 days), David W. McKeague\n\n(1,309 days), and Richard A. Griffin (1,079 days).\n\n52 See, earlier in the body of this report, the first paragraph after the heading âCircuit Court\n\nNominees During the Presidency of George W. Bush.â\n\n53 See, in Appendix 1, the first nomination of Terrence W. Boyle to the Fourth Circuit on\n\nMay 9, 2001, and the return of his sixth, and last, nomination on Dec. 9, 2006 â 2,040 days\n\nlater.\n\n54 See, in Appendix 1, the first, nomination of Thomas M. Hardiman to the Third Circuit\n\non Sept. 13, 2006, which was returned to the President on Dec. 9, 2006, 87 days later.\n\nHardiman was renominated to the Third Circuit on Jan. 9, 2007.\n\n55 See, in Appendix 1, the nomination of William H. Steele to the Eleventh Circuit. Steele\n\nwas nominated on Oct. 9, 2001, and that nomination was returned to the President on Nov.\n\n20, 2002 â a time interval of 407 days.\n\nCRS-15\n\nThe following are among the key statistical findings concerning President Bushâs\n\ncircuit court nominations during particular Congresses, and the actions and amount\n\nof time taken on them.\n\nThe 107th Congress. President Bush submitted a total of 52 circuit court\n\nnominations to the Senate during the 107th Congress. Twenty of the 52 nominations,\n\nhowever, were resubmissions (i.e., renominations of persons nominated earlier in the\n\nCongress). The resubmissions occurred when 20 circuit nominations, which had been\n\nreturned by the Senate to President Bush at the beginning of the Senateâs August 2001\n\nrecess, were resubmitted as new nominations upon the Senateâs reconvening in\n\nSeptember 2001. Hence, 32 individuals were nominated by President Bush to circuit\n\njudgeships during the 107th Congress.\n\nOf these 32 individuals, 17 were confirmed by the Senate (14 by roll call votes),56\n\nand 15 saw their nominations returned to the President at the final adjournment of the\n\n107th Congress. Of the 15 nominees not confirmed, 12 did not receive a Judiciary\n\nCommittee hearing; one received a committee hearing but not a committee vote;57 and\n\ntwo were defeated in committee when the Judiciary Committee voted not to report\n\ntheir nominations.58 The President renominated 14 of the 15 unconfirmed nominees\n\nat the start of the 108th Congress.59\n\nFor circuit nominations that received committee hearings, committee votes, or\n\nSenate confirmation votes in the 107th Congress, the average (mean) numbers of days\n\nthat elapsed between the date the nomination was received in the Senate and the\n\naforementioned actions were as follows:\n\n! For 19 of the 20 circuit nominations receiving committee hearings,60\n\nan average of 176 days elapsed between the date a nomination was\n\nreceived in the Senate and the holding of a hearing; the briefest time\n\n56 The closest roll call was the 55-44 vote, on Nov. 19, 2002, confirming Dennis Shedd of\n\nSouth Carolina to the Fourth Circuit; the second-closest was the 64-35 vote, on July 31,\n\n2002, confirming D. Brooks Smith of Pennsylvania to the Third Circuit. In all the other roll\n\ncall votes on whether to confirm circuit court nominations, the Senate voted unanimously\n\nin favor of confirmation, except for one roll call, in which one ânayâ vote was recorded.\n\nSee Appendix 2.\n\n57 See, in Appendix 2, the Sept. 4, 2001, nomination of Miguel A. Estrada to the D.C.\n\nCircuit.\n\n58 See, in Appendix 2, the Sept. 4, 2001, nominations of Priscilla R. Owen and Charles W.\n\nPickering Sr., both to the Fifth Circuit.\n\n59 The Oct. 9, 2001, nomination of William H. Steele to the Eleventh Circuit, in Appendix\n\n2, was returned to the President at the final adjournment of the 107th Congress on Nov. 20,\n\n2002. Steele was not re-nominated in the 108th Congress. Table notes in Appendix 3\n\nidentify the 14 other circuit nominees who were renominated in the 108th Congress, after\n\ntheir earlier nominations were returned to the President at the end of the 107th Congress.\n\n60 A 20th circuit court nomination also received a committee hearing, but it was excluded\n\nfrom the calculation of average elapsed time between date of nomination and committee\n\nhearing because its hearing date preceded its nomination date. See, in Appendix 2, the\n\nSept. 24, 2001, nomination of Sharon Prost, in anticipation of which the Senate Judiciary\n\nCommittee held a hearing, on Aug. 27, 2001.\n\nCRS-16\n\nelapsing from Senate receipt to committee hearing was nine days, and\n\nthe longest time was 387 days.\n\n! For the 19 circuit nominations receiving committee votes, an average\n\nof 194 days elapsed between Senate receipt and committee vote; the\n\nbriefest time elapsing from Senate receipt to committee vote was two\n\ndays,61 and the longest time (for two nominations) was 436 days.\n\n! For the 17 circuit nominations receiving final Senate votes (all in\n\nfavor of confirmation), an average of 210 days elapsed between\n\nSenate receipt and final Senate vote; the briefest time elapsing from\n\nSenate receipt to Senate confirmation vote was 17 days, and the\n\nlongest time was 441 days.\n\nFor the 35 circuit nominations that were not confirmed, an average of 204 days\n\nelapsed between Senate receipt and final action; the briefest time elapsing was one\n\nday, and the longest time was 442 days.\n\nThe 108th Congress. President Bush submitted a total of 37 circuit court\n\nnominations to the Senate during the 108th Congress. Three of the 37 nominations,\n\nhowever, were renominations of persons nominated earlier in the Congress.62 Hence,\n\n34 individuals were nominated by President Bush to circuit judgeships during the\n\n108th Congress.\n\nThe 34 individuals nominated by President Bush to circuit judgeships during the\n\n108th Congress included 14 who had first been nominated in the 107th Congress and\n\nthen resubmitted. Of the 34 nominees, 18 (including five of the resubmissions) were\n\nconfirmed by the Senate (14 by roll call votes),63 the nomination of one was\n\nwithdrawn by the President during the first session of the 108th Congress, and the\n\nnominations of 15 were returned at the Congressâs final adjournment. All but one of\n\n61 The nomination which received a committee vote just two days after its receipt by the\n\nSenate was a resubmission of an earlier nomination to the same judgeship. See, in Appendix\n\n2, the Sept. 4, 2001, nomination of Sharon Prost of the District of Columbia to the District\n\nof Columbia Circuit. A hearing was held on Aug. 27, 2001, in anticipation of Ms. Prostâs\n\nrenomination, paving the way for a committee vote after Senate receipt of the nomination\n\nwithout the need for a hearing first.\n\n62 See in Appendix 3 the nomination of Charles W. Pickering Sr. to the Fifth Circuit on Jan.\n\n7, 2003, followed by his renomination on Feb. 6, 2004; of Claude A. Allen to the Fourth\n\nCircuit on Apr. 28, 2003, followed by his renomination on Jan. 20, 2004; and of William H.\n\nPryor Jr. to the Eleventh Circuit on Apr. 9, 2003, followed by his renomination on Mar. 12,\n\n2004.\n\n63 The closest roll call vote on whether to confirm was the 52-41 vote, on Apr. 29, 2003,\n\nconfirming Jeffrey S. Sutton of Ohio to the Sixth Circuit; the second-closest was the 58-41\n\nvote, on Apr. 1, 2003, confirming Timothy M. Tymkovich of Colorado to the Tenth Circuit.\n\nSubstantial, though lesser, numbers of votes against confirmation were cast in the 66-25 vote\n\non May 5, 2003, to confirm Deborah L. Cook of Ohio to the Sixth Circuit; the 70-27 vote\n\non June 24, 2004, to confirm Diane S. Sykes of Wisconsin to the Seventh Circuit; and the\n\n74-19, vote on Mar. 13, 2003, to confirm Jay S. Bybee of Nevada to the Ninth Circuit. In\n\nthe 10 other roll call confirmation votes for circuit nominees, the Senate voted in favor of\n\nconfirmation unanimously or with one ânayâ vote recorded. See Appendix 3.\n\nCRS-17\n\nthe 34 nominees received a hearing (31 during the 108th Congress, two during the\n\nprior Congress),64 and 30 were reported out of committee, all favorably. Of the 16\n\ncircuit nominees not confirmed, one did not receive a committee hearing; no\n\ncommittee vote was taken on three others; and 12 did not receive final Senate votes.\n\nIn the case of 10 of the 12 nominees, cloture motions filed to close debate on their\n\nnominations failed to receive the required 60 votes.65 Two of the 10 nominations on\n\nwhich motions to close debate failed were of the two persons who had been defeated\n\nin the Senate Judiciary Committee in the 107th Congress.66 The nomination of one of\n\nthe other 10 nominees was withdrawn by the President, after seven unsuccessful\n\nmotions were made in the Senate to close debate on the nomination.67\n\nFor circuit nominations that received committee hearings, committee votes, or\n\nSenate confirmation votes in the 108th Congress, the average (mean) numbers of days\n\nthat elapsed between the date the nomination was received in the Senate and the\n\naforementioned actions were as follows:\n\n! For the 31 circuit nominations receiving hearings, an average of 145\n\ndays elapsed between the date the nomination was received in the\n\nSenate and the holding of a hearing; the briefest time elapsing from\n\nSenate receipt to committee hearing was (for three nominations) 22\n\ndays, and the longest time was 610 days.\n\n! For the 30 circuit nominations receiving committee votes, an average\n\nof 173 days elapsed between Senate receipt and committee vote; the\n\n64 Two of the three circuit court nominees during the 108th Congress who did not receive\n\nhearings during that Congress â Miguel Estrada of Virginia and Charles W. Pickering Sr.\n\nof Mississippi â had received hearings during the 107th Congress. The third circuit\n\nnominee not to receive a hearing during the 108th Congress, Terrence W. Boyle of North\n\nCarolina, had been nominated twice earlier, during the 107th Congress, and had not received\n\na hearing on either of these nominations as well. Between his first nomination on May 9,\n\n2001, in the 107th Congress and the return of his third nomination to the President at the\n\nfinal adjournment of the 108th Congress on Dec. 8, 2004, Boyle was a circuit court nominee\n\nfor more than three sessions of Congress without receiving a hearing. Subsequently,\n\nhowever, in the 109th Congress, Boyle was nominated to the circuit court a fourth time by\n\nPresident Bush, on Feb. 14, 2005, and received a hearing on this nomination on Mar. 3,\n\n2005. See Appendices 2, 3, and 4.\n\n65 As noted earlier, the 10 nominations on which the Senate voted, on one or more occasions,\n\nnot to close debate were the Jan. 7, 2003, nominations of Miguel A. Estrada of Virginia,\n\nRichard A. Griffin of Michigan, Carolyn B. Kuhl of California, David W. McKeague of\n\nMichigan, Priscilla R. Owen of Texas, Charles W. Pickering Sr. of Mississippi, and Henry\n\nW. Saad of Michigan; the Apr. 9, 2003, nomination of William H. Pryor Jr. of Alabama; the\n\nMay 15, 2003, nomination of William G. Myers III of Idaho; and the July 25, 2003,\n\nnomination of Janice R. Brown of California. See Appendix 3.\n\n66 See, in Appendix 2 , the Mar. 14, 2002, votes by the Senate Judiciary Committee against\n\nreporting the nomination of Charles W. Pickering Sr., and the Sept. 5, 2002, votes by the\n\ncommittee against reporting the nomination of Priscilla R. Owen.\n\n67 See, in Appendix 3, the Jan. 7, 2003, nomination of Miguel A. Estrada, which was\n\nwithdrawn by the President on Sept. 4, 2003, following seven Senate votes on motions to\n\nclose debate on the nomination.\n\nCRS-18\n\nbriefest time elapsing from Senate receipt to committee vote was 23\n\ndays, and the longest time 636 days.\n\n! For the 18 circuit nominations which received Senate confirmation\n\nvotes, an average of 140 days elapsed between Senate receipt and\n\nfinal Senate vote; the briefest time elapsing from Senate receipt to\n\nSenate confirmation vote was 65 days, and the longest time was 234\n\ndays.68\n\nFor the 19 circuit nominations that were not confirmed, an average of 516 days\n\nelapsed between Senate receipt and final action, the briefest time elapsing was 212\n\ndays, and the longest time was 701 days (for eight nominations).\n\nThe 109th Congress. President Bush submitted a total of 40 circuit\n\nnominations to the Senate during the 109th Congress. Twelve of the nominations,\n\nhowever, were renominations of persons nominated earlier in the Congress. (The\n\nrenominations followed the return to the President of one nomination at the end of the\n\n1st session of the Congress,69 the return of five nominations at the start of the Senateâs\n\nAugust 2006 recess,70 and the return of six nominations when the Senate recessed\n\nagain for more than 30 days on September 29, 2006.71) Hence, 28 individuals were\n\nnominated by President Bush to circuit judgeships during the 109th Congress.\n\nThe 28 individuals nominated by President Bush to circuit judgeships during the\n\n109th Congress included 12 who were nominated in the 108th Congress and then\n\nrenominated in the 109th Congress. Seven of the 12 had seen one or more\n\nunsuccessful votes on the Senate floor to close debate on their nominations in the\n\n108th Congress. Of the 28 nominees in the 109th Congress, the nominations of 16\n\n(seven of them resubmissions from the 108th Congress) were confirmed by the Senate\n\n(all but two by roll call);72 two were withdrawn by the President;73 and 10 were\n\n68 Appendix 3 excludes from the measurement and averaging of times from Senate receipt\n\nto final Senate vote the 10 circuit nominations during the 108th Congress on which there\n\nwere votes on motions to close Senate debate but no final votes on whether to confirm.\n\n69 See in Appendix 4 the return of the Feb. 14, 2005, nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh,\n\nfollowed by his renomination on Jan. 25, 2006.\n\n70 See in Appendix 4 the return of the Feb. 14, 2005, nominations of Terrence W. Boyle,\n\nWilliam J. Haynes II and William G.

Wallace, all of whom were\n\nrenominated on Sept. 5, 2006.\n\n71 See in Appendix 4 the return of the June 29, 2006, nomination of Peter D. Keisler and the\n\nreturn of the Sept. 5, 2006, nominations of Terrence W. Boyle, William J. Haynes II,\n\nWilliam G. Myers III, N. Randy Smith, and Michael B. Wallace, all of whom were\n\nrenominated on Nov. 15, 2006.\n\n72 On three of the nominations, the roll call votes were relatively close. See in Appendix\n\n4, the 53-45 vote on June 9, 2005, confirming William H. Pryor Jr. of Alabama to the\n\nEleventh Circuit; the 55-43 vote on May 25, 2005, confirming Priscilla R. Owen of Texas\n\nto the Fifth Circuit; and the 56-43 vote on June 8, 2005, confirming Janice R. Brown of\n\nCalifornia to the Ninth Circuit. On three other roll call votes, there was less, but still\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-19\n\nreturned at the end of the Congress. Two of the 28 nominees were nominated twice\n\nin the 109th Congress;74 five were nominated three times.75 Twenty-four of the 28\n\ncircuit nominees in the 109th Congress had received hearings (either in the 109th or in\n\nthe prior Congress), and the nominations of 21 had been reported out of committee,\n\nall favorably. Of the 10 nominees returned to the President at the end of the 109th\n\nCongress, three did not receive a hearing, while the other seven received hearings on\n\nat least one of their nominations in the 109th Congress.\n\nFor circuit nominations that received committee hearings, committee votes, or\n\nSenate confirmation votes in the 109th Congress, the average (mean) numbers of days\n\nthat elapsed between the date the nomination was received in the Senate and the\n\naforementioned actions were as follows:\n\n! For the 17 circuit nominations receiving hearings in the 109th\n\nCongress,76 an average of 76 days elapsed between the date the\n\nnomination was received in the Senate and the holding of a hearing;\n\nthe briefest time elapsing from Senate receipt to committee hearing\n\nwas 15 days, and the longest time was 512 days.\n\n! For the 20 circuit nominations receiving committee votes, an average\n\nof 87 days elapsed between Senate receipt and committee vote; the\n\n72 (...continued)\n\nsubstantial, recorded opposition to confirmation. See in Appendix 4 the 73-24 vote on June\n\n14, 2005, confirming Thomas B. Griffith to the District of Columbia Circuit; the 57-36 vote\n\non May 26, 2006, confirming Brett M. Kavanaugh to the District of Columbia Circuit; and\n\nthe 67-30 vote on July 25, 2006, confirming Jerome A. Holmes to the Tenth Circuit. On the\n\neight other roll call votes, the Senate voted unanimously in favor of confirmation. Two\n\nother nominees, Neil M.

Wallace of Mississippi to the Fifth Circuit.\n\n76 Seven other circuit court nominees in the109th Congress had received hearings earlier, on\n\nnominations referred to the Judiciary Committee in the 108th Congress. In addition to those\n\nseven, Brett M. Kavanaugh received hearings in both the 108th and 109th Congresses. See\n\nAppendix 1.\n\nCRS-20\n\nbriefest time elapsing from Senate receipt to committee vote was 16\n\ndays,77 and the longest time was 248 days.\n\n! For the 16 circuit nominations which received Senate confirmation\n\nvotes, an average of 115 days elapsed between Senate receipt and\n\nfinal Senate vote; the briefest time elapsing from Senate receipt to\n\nSenate confirmation vote was 63 days, and the longest time was 255\n\ndays.\n\nFor the 24 circuit nominations that were not confirmed, an average of 159 days\n\nelapsed between Senate receipt and final action; the briefest time elapsing was 24\n\ndays, and the longest time was 535 days.\n\nDistrict Court Nominees During the Presidency\n\nof George W. Bush\n\nDuring the presidency of George W. Bush â from January 20, 2001, through\n\nDecember 9, 2006 â 206 of his 237 nominees to the U.S. district courts received\n\nSenate confirmation. Of the 31 nominees not confirmed, the nominations of three\n\nwere withdrawn by the President,78 and the other 28 were returned at the end of the\n\n109th Congress.79 (As of January 19, 2007, 24 of the 28 were renominated to the same\n\ndistrict court judgeships in the 110th Congress, while one other was nominated again,\n\nbut this time to a circuit judgeship.)80 None of President Bushâs district nominees has\n\nbeen defeated in a committee vote or rejected in a Senate confirmation vote.\n\nAn examination of Appendix 5 reveals that President Bushâs district court\n\nnominees have varied considerably in how quickly they have advanced through the\n\nappointment process. Of the 237 individuals nominated by the President to district\n\njudgeships (as of the end of the 109th Congress), 216 were nominated in only one\n\nCongress (with 187 confirmed in their respective Congresses, 28 returned at the end\n\nof the 109th Congress, and one withdrawn in the same Congress as his first\n\n77 This calculation is the time from receipt of the second nomination of N. Randy Smith to\n\nthe Ninth Circuit. The committee vote on Sept. 21, 2006, came 279 days after the first\n\nnomination on Dec. 16, 2005. If this nomination is excluded, the shortest interval from\n\nnomination to committee vote in the 109th Congress was 31 days.\n\n78 See, in Appendices 5 and 7, the Jan. 7, 2003, nomination of Frederick W. Rohlfing III\n\nto the District of Hawaii (withdrawn on May 6, 2004), and in Appendices 5 and 8 the Feb.\n\n14, 2005, nomination of Daniel P. Ryan to the Eastern District of Michigan (withdrawn on\n\nMar. 30, 2006) and the Feb. 14, 2006, nomination of Jerome A. Holmes to the Northern\n\nDistrict of Oklahoma (withdrawn on May 4, 2006).\n\n79 See, in Appendix 8, the 28 nominations with the listing of âReturned 12/09/06â in the\n\nâFinal Actionâ column.\n\n80 See notes in Appendices 5 and 8 that identify nominees who were renominated in the\n\n110th Congress. The district court nominee in the 109th Congress who was renominated in\n\nthe 110th Congress to a circuit judgeship was Leslie Southwick (initially nominated to\n\nSouthern District of Mississippi, then nominated to the Fifth Circuit).\n\nCRS-21\n\nnomination).81 Of the remaining 21 individuals, 19 were nominated in two\n\nCongresses,82 and two were nominated in three Congresses.83 Nineteen of the 21\n\nnominated in more than one Congress were confirmed; 18 in the second Congress in\n\nwhich they were nominated, one in the third Congress in which he was nominated.84\n\nThe other two nominees whose nominations were submitted in more than one\n\nCongress were withdrawn by the President.85\n\nConfirmed Nominees. Of President Bushâs 206 confirmed district court\n\nnominees, 187 were confirmed within the same Congress in which they were first\n\nnominated, with 19 confirmed in a subsequent Congress. The most elapsed time for\n\na district court nominee between first nomination and confirmation was 1,365 days,\n\nalmost three years and nine months.86 The least amount of elapsed time for a district\n\nnominee between first nomination and confirmation was 56 days.87 The bottom rows\n\nof Appendix 5 show that for President Bushâs 206 district court nominees confirmed\n\nas of December 9, 2006, the average, or mean, elapsed time between first nomination\n\nand confirmation was 171 days, whereas the median elapsed time (i.e., the time\n\ninterval for the nominee in the midpoint of the distribution of the 206 confirmed\n\nnominees) was 134 days.\n\n81 See in Appendices 5 and 8 the Feb. 14, 2006, nomination of Jerome A. Holmes to the\n\nNorthern District of Oklahoma; Holmes was withdrawn on May 4, 2006, and nominated to\n\nthe Tenth Circuit that same day.\n\n82 Examination of Appendix 5 reveals that 13 individuals were nominated to district\n\njudgeships in both the 107th and 108th Congresses, and that six others were nominated to\n\ndistrict judgeships in both the 108th and 109th Congresses.\n\n83 The two were James C. Dever (first nominated to the Eastern District of North Carolina\n\non May 22, 2002, and ultimately confirmed on Apr. 28, 2005), and Thomas L. Ludington\n\n(first nominated to the District of Eastern Michigan on Sept. 12, 2002, and whose third\n\nnomination was confirmed on June 8, 2006). See Appendix 5.\n\n84 See, in Appendix 5, nominee James C. Dever III, first nominated on May 22, 2002, in the\n\n107th Congress, nominated again on Jan. 7, 2003, in the 108th Congress, and nominated a\n\nthird time, on Feb. 14, 2005, in the 109th Congress, and who ultimately was confirmed, on\n\nApr. 28, 2005.\n\n85 See, in Appendix 5, nominees Frederick W. Rohlfing III, first nominated on Jan. 23,\n\n2002, in the 107th Congress, and whose second nomination, on Jan. 7, 2003, in the 108th\n\nCongress, was withdrawn on May 6, 2004, and Daniel P. Ryan, first nominated on Apr. 28,\n\n2003, in the 108th Congress, whose second nomination on Feb. 14, 2004, in the 109th\n\nCongress, was withdrawn, on Mar. 30, 2006.\n\n86 See again, in Appendix 5, nominee Thomas L. Ludington for the Eastern District of\n\nMichigan, 1,365 days between first nomination on Sept. 12, 2002, and confirmation on June\n\n8, 2006. The nominees with the next highest number of days elapsed between first\n\nnomination and confirmation are James C. Dever III, nominated to the Eastern District of\n\nNorth Carolina, 1,072 days between first nomination on May 22, 2002, and confirmation on\n\nApr. 28, 2005; and Peter Sheridan, nominated to the District of New Jersey, 946 days\n\nbetween first nomination on Nov. 5, 2003, and confirmation on June 8, 2006.\n\n87 See, in Appendix 5, nominee L. Scott Coogler for the Northern District of Alabama,\n\nnominated on Mar. 27, 2003, and confirmed on May 22, 2003. Nominees James V. Selna\n\nfor the Central District of California and Philip P. Simon for the Northern District of\n\nIndiana, were both nominated on Jan. 29, 2003, and both confirmed on Mar. 27, 2003 â an\n\ninterval of 57 days.\n\nCRS-22\n\nWithdrawn Nominees. Three of President Bushâs district court nominees saw\n\ntheir nominations withdrawn. One had been nominated in the 107th and 108th\n\nCongresses, another in the 108th and 109th Congresses, and one was nominated only\n\nin the 109th Congress. The elapsed times between their first nomination and the\n\nwithdrawal of their final or only nomination were 834 days, 1,067 days, and 79 days,\n\nrespectively.88\n\nPresident Bushâs District Court Nominations\n\nDuring Particular Congresses\n\nThe following are among the key statistical findings concerning President Bushâs\n\ndistrict court nominations during particular Congresses, and the actions and amounts\n\nof time taken on them.\n\nThe 107th Congress. President Bush submitted a total of 118 district court\n\nnominations to the Senate during the 107th Congress.89 Twenty of the 118\n\nnominations, however, were resubmissions (renominations). The resubmissions\n\noccurred when 20 district nominations, which had been returned by the Senate to\n\nPresident Bush at the beginning of the Senateâs August 2001 recess, were resubmitted\n\nas new nominations upon the Senateâs reconvening in September 2001. Hence, 98\n\nindividuals were nominated by President Bush to district judgeships during the 107th\n\nCongress.\n\nOf these 98 individuals, 83 were confirmed by the Senate (45 by roll call votes),90\n\nafter receiving committee hearings and being reported out of committee favorably.\n\nThe 15 district court nominees who failed to be confirmed saw their nominations\n\nreturned to the President at the final adjournment of the 107th Congress, with none\n\nhaving received committee hearings or committee votes. (All 15, however, were\n\nrenominated by President Bush in the 108th Congress, with 12 of the 15 confirmed in\n\nthat Congress, one withdrawn by the President in that Congress,91 and two confirmed\n\nin the 109th Congress.)92\n\n88 See again, in Appendix 5, nominee Frederick W. Rohlfing III for the District of Hawaii,\n\n834 days between first nomination, on Jan. 23, 2002, in the 107th Congress, and withdrawal\n\nof second nomination, on May 6, 2004, in the 108th Congress; Daniel P. Ryan for Eastern\n\nDistrict of Michigan, 1,067 days between first nomination on Apr. 28, 2003, in the 108th\n\nCongress, and withdrawal of second nomination, on Mar. 30, 2006, in the 109th Congress;\n\nand Jerome A. Holmes, 79 days between nomination on Feb. 14, 2006, and withdrawal on\n\nMay 4, 2006.\n\n89 See Appendix 6.\n\n90 In all except one of the roll calls, the Senate voted unanimously in favor of confirmation.\n\nThe sole roll call in which ânayâ votes were cast against a district court nomination was the\n\n67-20 vote, on May 13, 2002, to confirm Paul G. Cassell to the U.S. District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Utah. See Appendix 6.\n\n91 See, in Appendix 5 the first nomination of Frederick W. Rohlfing III for the District of\n\nHawaii, in the 107th Congress and his second nomination, and its withdrawal, in the 108th\n\nCongress.\n\n92 See in Appendix 5 the nominations in the 107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses â and\n\n(continued...)\n\nCRS-23\n\nFor district court nominations which received committee hearings, committee\n\nvotes, or Senate confirmation votes in the 107th Congress, the average (mean) numbers\n\nof days that elapsed between the date the nomination was received in the Senate and\n\nthe aforementioned actions were as follows:\n\n! For 81 district nominations receiving committee hearings, an average\n\nof 89 days elapsed between the date a nomination was received in the\n\nSenate and the holding of a hearing;93 the briefest time elapsing for\n\na district nomination from Senate receipt to committee hearing was\n\nnine days, and the longest time (for three nominations) was 257 days.\n\n! For the 83 district nominations receiving committee votes, an average\n\nof 102 days elapsed between Senate receipt and committee vote; the\n\nbriefest time elapsing from Senate receipt to committee vote was two\n\ndays,94 and the longest time (for two nominations) was 258 days.\n\n! For the 83 district nominations receiving final Senate votes (all for\n\nconfirmation), an average of 127 days elapsed between Senate receipt\n\nand Senate vote; the briefest time elapsing for a district nomination\n\nfrom Senate receipt to Senate confirmation was 17 days, and the\n\nlongest time (for three nominations) was 295 days.\n\nFor the 35 district court nominations that were not confirmed, an average of 51\n\ndays elapsed between Senate receipt and final action; the briefest time elapsing was\n\n17 days, and the longest time was 301 days.\n\nThe 108th Congress. President Bush submitted a total of 96 district court\n\nnominations to the Senate during the 108th Congress.95 The number of individuals\n\nnominated was also 96, as there were no district judge renominations during the\n\nCongress. Of the 96 total, 87 were confirmed (58 by roll call votes), eight saw their\n\nnominations returned at the end of the Congress, and the nomination of one was\n\n92 (...continued)\n\nultimate confirmation in the 109th Congress â of James C. Dever III for the Eastern District\n\nof North Carolina and Thomas L. Ludington for the Eastern District of Michigan.\n\n93 Two other district nominations also received hearings; however, they were not included\n\nin calculating average time between nomination date and hearing because the individualsâ\n\nhearings preceded their nomination dates. See, in Appendix 6, the nominations of Reggie\n\nB. Walton for the District of South Carolina and Terry L. Wooten for the District Court for\n\nthe District of Columbia on Sept. 4, 2001, which were preceded by hearings on Aug. 22 and\n\nAug. 27, 2001, respectively.\n\n94 The nomination which received a committee vote just two days after its receipt by the\n\nSenate was a resubmission of an earlier nomination to the same judgeship. See the Sept. 4,\n\n2001, nomination of Reggie B. Walton to the District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nA hearing was held on Aug. 22, 2001, in anticipation of Waltonâs renomination, paving the\n\nway for a committee vote after Senate receipt of the nomination without the need for a\n\nhearing first. See Appendix 6.\n\n95 See Appendix 7.\n\nCRS-24\n\nwithdrawn.96 In all but three of the 58 roll calls, the Senate voted unanimously in\n\nfavor of confirmation.97 All of the 87 nominees who were confirmed received\n\ncommittee hearings and were reported out of committee favorably, except for one,\n\nwhose nomination was reported out of committee without recommendation.98 Of the\n\nnine nominees not confirmed, seven did not receive a hearing, and no committee vote\n\nwas taken on two others.99 One of the nine district nominees not confirmed, as already\n\nnoted, was withdrawn by the President, and the other eight were returned to the\n\nPresident at the end of the 108th Congress. Early in the 109th Congress, the President\n\nrenominated all of these eight returnees.\n\nFor district court nominations in the 108th Congress which received committee\n\nhearings, committee votes, or Senate confirmation votes, Appendix 7 shows that the\n\naverage (mean) numbers of days that elapsed between date of nomination and the\n\naforementioned actions were as follows:100\n\n! For the 89 district court nominations receiving hearings during the\n\n108th Congress, an average of 85 days elapsed from Senate receipt of\n\nnomination to committee hearing; the briefest time elapsing from\n\nSenate receipt to committee hearing was (for three nominations) 22\n\ndays, and the longest time was 300 days.\n\n! For the 87 district nominations receiving committee votes, an average\n\nof 111 days elapsed from Senate receipt to committee vote; the\n\nbriefest such time interval (for two district nominations) was 30 days,\n\nand the longest time (for two nominations) was 336 days.\n\n! For the 87 district nominations receiving final Senate votes (all for\n\nconfirmation), an average of 156 days elapsed between Senate\n\nreceipt and Senate vote; the briefest time elapsing for a district court\n\nnomination from Senate receipt to Senate confirmation was 34 days\n\n(for three nominations), and the longest time was 524 days.\n\n96 See in Appendix 7 the Jan. 7, 2003, nomination of Frederick W. Rohlfing III to the U.S.\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Hawaii, which was withdrawn by the President on May 6,\n\n2004.\n\n97 In two of the three other roll calls votes, only one ânayâ vote was cast against\n\nconfirmation. However, in the third roll call that was not unanimously in favor of\n\nconfirmation, a substantial number of ânayâ votes were cast. See in Appendix 7 the Jan.\n\n29, 2003, nomination of J. Leon Holmes to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District\n\nof Arkansas, which was confirmed by the Senate on July 6, 2004, by a 51-46 vote.\n\n98 See, in Appendix 7, the Jan. 29, 2003, nomination of J. Leon Holmes to the U.S. District\n\nCourt for the Eastern District of Arkansas, which the Senate Judiciary Committee, on May\n\n1, 2003, voted 10-9 to report without recommendation.\n\n99 Two of the nominees not confirmed were nominated relatively late in the Congress, in\n\nSeptember 2004. Although they received committee hearings in November 2004, they were\n\nnot reported out of committee in the remaining three weeks of the Congress. See, in\n\nAppendix 7, the Sept. 7, 2004, nomination of Paul A. Crotty to the Southern District of New\n\nYork and the Sept. 15, 2004, nomination of J. Michael Seabright to the District of Hawaii.\n\n100 For time interval averages and longest and shortest elapsed times in the confirmation\n\nprocess for district court nominations in the 108th Congress, see Appendix 7.\n\nCRS-25\n\nFor the nine district court nominations that were not confirmed, an average of\n\n415 days elapsed between Senate receipt and final action; the briefest time elapsing\n\nwas 84 days, and the longest time was 701 days.\n\nThe 109th Congress. President Bush submitted a total of 66 district court\n\nnominations to the Senate during the109th Congress.101 The number of individuals\n\nnominated was also 66, as there were no district judge renominations during the\n\nCongress, although eight of the nominees had been nominated previously in the 108th\n\nCongress. The nominations of 36 of the 66, including seven of the eight resubmissions\n\nfrom the 108th Congress, were confirmed (eight by roll call);102 two were withdrawn;103\n\nand 28 were returned at the end of the 109th Congress. Fifty of the 66 nominees had\n\nreceived hearings (48 in the 109th Congress, two in the 108th), and the nominations of\n\n49 had been reported out of committee, all favorably. Of the 28 nominees returned\n\nat the end of the 109th Congress, 14 awaited hearings, one awaited a committee vote,\n\nand 13 awaited Senate floor action.\n\nFor district court nominations which received committee hearings, committee\n\nvotes, or Senate confirmation votes in the 109th Congress, the average (mean) numbers\n\nof days that elapsed between the date the nomination was received in the Senate and\n\nthe aforementioned actions were as follows:104\n\n! For the 48 district nominations receiving committee hearings,105 an\n\naverage of 105 days elapsed between the date a nomination was\n\nreceived in the Senate and the holding of a hearing; the briefest time\n\nelapsing from Senate receipt to committee hearing was 17 days, and\n\nthe longest time was 442 days.\n\n! For the 48 district court nominations receiving committee votes, an\n\naverage of 118 days elapsed between Senate receipt and committee\n\nvote; the briefest time elapsing from Senate receipt to committee vote\n\nwas 31 days, and the longest time was 451 days.\n\n! For the 36 district nominations receiving final Senate votes (all for\n\nconfirmation), an average of 143 days elapsed between Senate receipt\n\nand Senate vote; the briefest time elapsing from Senate receipt to\n\nSenate confirmation was 56 days, and the longest time was 479 days.\n\n101 See Appendix 8.\n\n102 On all eight roll calls, the Senate voted unanimously in favor of confirmation.\n\n103 See, in Appendix 8, the Feb. 14, 2005, nomination of Daniel P. Ryan (withdrawn on\n\nMar. 30, 2006), and the Feb. 14, 2006, nomination of Jerome A. Holmes (withdrawn on May\n\n4, 2006).\n\n104 For time interval averages and longest and shortest elapsed times in the confirmation\n\nprocess for district court nominations in the 109th Congress, see Appendix 8.\n\n105 Excluded from this average were the Feb. 14, 2005, nominations of J. Michael Seabright\n\nand Paul A. Crotty. These nominees had received a hearing earlier, in the previous\n\nCongress.\n\nCRS-26\n\nFor the 30 district court nominations that were not confirmed, an average of 140\n\ndays elapsed between Senate receipt and final Senate action; the briefest time elapsing\n\nwas two days, and the longest time was 409 days.\n\nComparison of President Bushâs Circuit Court\n\nNominations with His District Court Nominations\n\nNotable differences can be found between President Bushâs circuit court\n\nnomination statistics and those for his district court nominations. Perhaps most\n\nnotable, as of the end of the 109th Congress, 75.0% of President Bushâs circuit court\n\nnominees (51 of 68) had received Senate confirmation, compared with 86.9% (206 of\n\n237) of his district court nominees.106 For President Bushâs immediate predecessor\n\nin the White House, President Clinton, the confirmation rate for his circuit court\n\nnominees (71.4%) was also notably less than for his district court nominees (87.2%).\n\nHowever, such differences in confirmation rates for circuit and district nominees were\n\neither slight or nonexistent for the three Presidents prior to Clinton.107\n\nAlso, the Senate has tended to take much longer to act on President Bushâs\n\ncircuit court nominees than on his district court nominees. As Table 1, below,\n\nshows, the mean number of days elapsing from first nomination to confirmation for\n\ncircuit nominees, 366 days, was more than twice as much as the corresponding time\n\ninterval of 171 days for district nominees. Also, the median number of days, from\n\nfirst nomination to confirmation, was 216 days for circuit nominees, 62% longer than\n\nthe corresponding time interval, of 134 days, for district nominees. For circuit\n\nnominees returned to the President or withdrawn, the mean interval of 710 days\n\nbetween date of first nomination and date of disposition of most recent nomination (as\n\nof the end of the 109th Congress), was nearly four times the corresponding mean\n\ninterval of 184 days for district nominees; the median number of days for this time\n\ninterval for circuit nominees was 407, almost three times higher than the\n\ncorresponding interval of 149 days for district nominees.\n\nTable 1. Mean and Median Number of Days Elapsed from First\n\nNomination to Disposition of Last Nomination for President\n\nGeorge W. Bushâs Nominees to U.S. Circuit or District Court\n\nJudgeships (January 20, 2001 - December 9, 2006)\n\nNumber of days elapsed\n\nCourts to which\n\nfrom first nomination to ...\n\nnominated\n\nOther final\n\nConfirmation\n\ndisposition a\n\nMean\n\nCircuit (N=68)\n\n366 (N=51)\n\n710 (N=17)\n\nDistrict (N=237)\n\n171 (N=206)\n\n184 (N=31)\n\n106 These numbers and percentages are derived from the circuit and district nominee lists\n\nfor President Bush in Appendices 1 and 5, respectively.\n\n107 See Table 3 and related discussion later in this report, concerning comparative judicial\n\nnominations statistics for the five most recent Presidents.\n\nCRS-27\n\nMedian\n\nCircuit (N=68)\n\n216 (N=51)\n\n407 (N=17)\n\nDistrict (N=237)\n\n134 (N=206)\n\n149 (N=31)\n\nLegend: N = Number of nominees.\n\nSources: Appendices 1 and 5 at end of this report.\n\na. The most recent nominations for these nominees were either withdrawn by the President or returned\n\nto the President.\n\nAnother indicator that President Bushâs circuit court nominees have tended to\n\nspend more time in the confirmation process than have his district court nominees is\n\nthe number of Congresses in which they have been nominated. Table 2, below,\n\nshows that roughly 30% of the persons President Bush nominated to circuit judgeships\n\nthrough the end of the 109th Congress, were nominated in two or more Congresses,108\n\nwhereas fewer than 10% of the persons he nominated to district judgeships were\n\nnominated in more than one Congress.109 As these percentages suggest, President\n\nBushâs usual practice, when his judicial nominees failed to receive Senate\n\nconfirmation in one Congress, was to renominate them in the next Congress.\n\nTable 2.
