        "text": "Conclusion\n\nThe increasing capabilities and availability of data and new technologies change how nations remain competitive and secure. In the coming GeoTech Decade, data and technology will have a disproportionate impact on geopolitics, global competition, and global opportunities for collaboration as new capabilities may eliminate a technical advantage or may enable new processes superior to current methods. The United States and like-minded nations must be able to adapt and demonstrate effective governance, at faster speeds, in employing data and new technologies to promote a more secure, free, and prosperous world.\n\nIn 1945, Vannevar Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, transmitted a report, Science – the Endless Frontier, with the goal of answering a few key questions asked by then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt in November 1944. In the report, Bush elaborated:\n\n“With particular reference to the war of science against disease, what can be done now to organize a program for continuing in the future the work which has been done in medicine and related sciences?\n\n“What can the Government do now and in the future to aid research activities by public and private organizations?\n\n“Can an effective program be proposed for discovering and developing scientific talent in American youth so that the continuing future of scientific research in this country may be assured on a level comparable to what has been done during the war?”\n\nAmong its recommendations, the 1945 report called for the creation of the National Research Foundation. Bush concluded, noting the importance of action by Congress:\n\n“Legislation is necessary. It should be drafted with great care. Early action is imperative, however, if this nation is to meet the challenge of science and fully utilize the potentialities of science. On the wisdom with which we bring science to bear against the problems of the coming years depends in large measure our future as a nation.”\n\nNow, almost seventy-six years later, the GeoTech Commission similarly seeks to promote freedom and security through initiatives that employ data and new technologies to amplify the ingenuity of people, diversity of talent, strength of democratic values, innovation of companies, and the reach of global partnerships.\n\nThere are several areas where data and technology can help, or hinder, the achievement of these goals:\n\nCommunications and networking, data science, cloud computing\n\nArtificial intelligence, distributed sensors, edge computing, the Internet of Things\n\nBiotechnologies, precision medicine, genomic technologies\n\nSpace technologies, undersea technologies\n\nAutonomous systems, robotics, decentralized energy methods\n\nQuantum information science, nanotechnology, new materials for extreme environments, advanced microelectronics\n\nTo maintain national and economic security and competitiveness in the global economy, the United States and its allies must continue to be preeminent in these key areas, and must achieve trustworthy and assured performance of the digital economy and its infrastructure. The GeoTech Commission provided recommendations in the following seven areas where the United States and like-minded nations must succeed:\n\nGlobal science and technology leadership\n\nSecure data and communications\n\nEnhanced trust and confidence in the digital economy\n\nAssured supply chains and system resiliency\n\nContinuous global health protection and global wellness\n\nAssured space operations for public benefit\n\nFuture of work\n\nThe report’s recommendations embody several ideals. First, work to ensure the benefits of new technologies reach all sectors of society. Second, define protocols and standards for permissible ways to develop and use technologies and data, consistent with the norms of the United States and like-minded nations. Third, guide technology cooperation and sharing with nondemocratic nations based on respecting democratic values.\n\nJust as Vannevar Bush urged in 1945, the United States must create new ways to develop and employ future critical and emerging technologies at speed, cultivate the needed human capital, and establish norms for international cooperation with nations. Such creation requires important action by Congress and the new administration to ensure that the United States has the wisdom with which to apply science to the challenges and opportunities of the coming years. If enacted, the report’s recommendations will enable the United States and like-minded nations to employ data capabilities and new technologies intentionally to promote a freer, more secure, and more prosperous world.\n\nAppendices\n\nBiographies of the GeoTech Commission co-chairs and commissioners\n\nCo-chairs\n\nJohn Goodman, Chief Executive Officer, Accenture Federal Services\n\nJohn Goodman is the Chief Executive of Accenture Federal Services (AFS), which serves clients across all sectors of the US federal government – defense, intelligence, public safety, health, and civilian.
