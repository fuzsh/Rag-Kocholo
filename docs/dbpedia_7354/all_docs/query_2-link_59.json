The secretary is a member of the Cabinet of the United States. The position was created by the Homeland Security Act following the attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nThe new department consisted primarily of components transferred from other Cabinet departments because of their role in homeland security, such as the Coast Guard, the Federal Protective Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (which includes the United States Border Patrol), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (which includes Homeland Security Investigations), the United States Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It does not, however, include the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the U.S. Marshals Service.[2] They continue to operate under U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe current secretary of homeland security is Alejandro Mayorkas, since February 2, 2021. He is the first Latino and immigrant to lead the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nList of secretaries of homeland security\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to the establishment of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there existed an assistant to the president for the Office of Homeland Security, which was created following the September 11 attacks in 2001.\n\nParties Republican (5) Democratic (3) Independent (4)\n\nStatus Denotes Acting Homeland Security Secretary\n\nNo. Portrait Name Senate vote Term of office State of residence President Took office Left office Duration 1 Tom Ridge\n\n(born 1945) 94–0 January 24, 2003 February 1, 2005 2 years, 8 days Pennsylvania George W.

Bush nominated Bernard Kerik for the position in 2004. However a week later, Kerik withdrew his nomination, explaining that he had employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny.[9]\n\nRaymond Kelly\n\n[edit]\n\nBy July 2013, Raymond Kelly had served as Commissioner of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for nearly 12 straight years. Within days of Homeland Security secretary Janet Napolitano's announcement that she was resigning, Kelly was soon cited as an obvious potential successor by New York senator Charles Schumer and others.[10]\n\nDuring a July 16, 2013, interview, President Obama referred generally to the \"bunch of strong candidates\" for nomination to head the Department of Homeland Security, but singled out Kelly as \"one of the best there is\" and \"very well qualified for the job\".[11]\n\nLater in July 2013, the online internet news website/magazine Huffington Post detailed \"a growing campaign to quash the potential nomination of New York City Police commissioner Raymond Kelly as the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security\" amid claims of \"divisive, harmful, and ineffective policing that promotes stereotypes and profiling\".[12] Days after that article, Kelly penned a statistics-heavy Wall Street Journal opinion article defending the NYPD's programs, stating \"the average number of stops we conduct is less than one per officer per week\" and that this and other practices have led to \"7,383 lives saved—and... they are largely the lives of young men of color.\"[13]\n\nKelly was also featured because of his NYPD retirement and unusually long tenure there in a long segment on the CBS News program Sunday Morning in December 2013, especially raising the question of the controversial \"stop and frisk\" policy in New York City and the long decline and drop of various types of crimes committed.\n\nOffice of the Secretary of Homeland Security\n\n[edit]\n\nPurpose\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Office of the Secretary (OS) oversees the execution of the duties of the Department of Homeland Security.[14] Certain elements also aid the Secretary of Homeland Security and senior officials of the Department of Homeland Security, as well as private sector and government partners in their duties.\n\nComposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Office of the Secretary contains several offices and other elements of the DHS.[14] Most of the heads of these elements report directly to the Secretary or Deputy Secretary, but the Military Advisor and Executive Secretary report to the DHS Chief of Staff, who is currently Jonathan Davidson.\n\nComponents of the Office of the Secretary of Homeland Security Component Mission Executives Subordinate Elements Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) [15]\n\nProvides legal and policy advice to Department leadership on civil rights and civil liberties issues.\n\nInvestigates and resolves complaints.\n\nProvides leadership to Equal Employment Opportunity Programs.\n\nOfficer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties: Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia\n\nDeputy Officer for Programs & Compliance: Peter Mina\n\nDeputy Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties: Veronica Venture\n\nPrograms and Compliance Division\n\nCompliance Branch\n\nInvestigations Section\n\nOperations Section\n\nPrograms Branch\n\nAntidiscrimination Group\n\nCRCL Institute\n\nCommunity Engagement Section\n\nImmigration Section\n\nSecurity, Intelligence, and Information Policy Section\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity and Diversity Division\n\nDiversity Management Section\n\nComplaints Management and Adjudication Section\n\nHeadquarters EEO Office\n\nDispute Resolution and Anti-Harassment Section\n\nExecutive Officer\n\nBusiness Operations Section\n\nOffice for Accessible Systems and Technology (jointly run with DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer)\n\nOffice of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CISOMB) [16]\n\nServes as a liaison between the public and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nHelps individuals and employers resolve issues they are having with USCIS.\n\nHolds engagements to hear from the public about their experiences with USCIS.\n\nIdentifies issues in the immigration system and make recommendations to USCIS on how to address these problems.\n\nCIS Ombudsman: Nathan Stiefel (acting)\n\nDeputy Ombudsman: Nathan Stiefel\n\nPolicy Division\n\nPublic Engagement Division\n\nCasework Division\n\nOperations Division\n\nStrategy Division\n\nClimate Change Action Group [17]\n\nDrives urgent action to address the climate crisis.\n\nAnalyzes, on an ongoing basis, the impacts of climate change on DHS missions, assets, and personnel.\n\nAdapts DHS operations, assets, and missions to account for the climate crisis via risk- based strategies.\n\nCoordinates DHS-wide sustainability operations to mitigate additional harm.\n\nRecommends specific, concrete steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nRecommends specific, concrete steps to promote resilience and adaptation to reduce the multiple risks posed by the climate crisis.\n\nRecommends organizational and resource realignments as necessary to support the Department’s activities to address the climate crisis.\n\nCo-Chairs: Cass Sunstein & Robert P.
