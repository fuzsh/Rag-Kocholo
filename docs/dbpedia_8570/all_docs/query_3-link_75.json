        "text": "Airtel’s Biggest Japi Record Bharti Airtel, India’s leading mobile services provider, in collaboration with Assam Tourism Development Corporation & the Sports Club of Assam, innovatively presented the biggest Japi ever on the occasion of Rongali Bihu 2009. Mr. V.V. R. Murthy from Limca Book of Records Delhi arrived there and assessed the 40 ft diameter Japi at Digalipukhuri, Guwahati to be the biggest one ever. Mr. Murthy confirmed this record as the first one from Assam this year and stated that the last one from the region was during the Autumn Festival in Meghalaya – of the biggest Jalebi.\n\nThe historic venue of Dighalipukhri Park, Ambari, Guwahati, was chosen as the venue for the making of the Historic Japi where about 20 artisans from Nalbari, Assam started the historic project from the 13th of April 2009 onwards. The 40ft Japi was completed in a record time of seven days by 20 artisans from Balamukhkhuchi, Nalbari. Airtel rewarded these artists with an insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh each at a star studded function.\n\nThe closing function was held on April 20th 2009 & was graced by eminent dignitaries & celebrities- the most notable among them were Dr. Bhupen Hazarika, as the Chief Guest who graced the occasion with both his presence and his melodious voice; Dr. Mamoni Raisom Goswami, who had earlier flagged off the Bihu toli yatra of Snehalaya children and eminent film maker, Kalpana Lajmi.\n\nDr. Mamoni Raisom Goswami graced the occasion & delivered her speech with pearls of wisdom when she recited a few lines about Mother Nature & the japi being a protector of human lives as it protects us from the rain & hot sun.\n\nThe other dignitaries present included Mr. G.M. Srivastav DGP Assam Police who presented some insights on non verbal communication and renowned Assamese actresses Moloya Goswami, Zerifa Wahid & Borosha Rani Bishaya, Father Lukose, Director Snehalaya & Father Joseph Thellekat, Principal Don Bosco. The MD ATDC, Mr. D. Goswami confirmed the preservation and future of the Japi to be at the historic Digalipukhuri Park itself.\n\nMr. Sudipto Chowdhury Chief Operating Officer, Bharti Airtel Ltd. NESA Circle, on this occasion said, “Bihu is always very special at Airtel, as on this day in 2005 we commenced our services in the Northeastern region. We hope to contribute to the culture of Assam by creating the biggest Japi of 40 ft diameter - a small step towards trying to motivate the artisans of Nalbari, by bringing them to the national & international forum through the Limca Book of records, as the largest headgear ever made.”\n\nThe Dighalipukhri resounded with Dr. Bhupen Hazarika singing his immortal songs and precious words when he said that the Japi is a symbol of our unity, in these troubled times & to reiterate that, he sang the immortal number ‘We are in the same boat bother”, to the immense joy of all present at the occasion."
