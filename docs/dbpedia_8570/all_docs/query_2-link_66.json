        "text": "“Give me a gun and I shall once again kill the corrupt. I am old but not old enough to be unable to shed my blood for the sake of my country”, says the 95 year old man.\n\nNo, the person in front of me is not suffering from delusions but is Umesh Chandra Dev Choudhury, the oldest surviving member(in Assam) of the Indian National Army(INA), Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's grand machination to expel the British from India.\n\nServing as a havildar clerk (combatant) in the British army in 1941, Choudhury was trained at Peshawar and sent to fight on behalf of the British Army to Hongkong and then to Singapore. When the British lost, he became a Prisoner of War (POW) there. Freedom fighter, Ras Behari Bose, an ardent believer in extremism for freedom started gathering the POWs.\n\nRecalling his association with the INA, Choudhury says, “In 1943, Netaji came to Singapore from Germany after meeting Hitler. He made us realize the ultimate cause of liberating India. I remember him calling us to sing anthems at the camp during evenings. I knew Bengali very well as I had passed engineering from Rajsahi (now in Bangladesh). Netaji was impressed with me and asked me to translate leaflets from Bengali into Assamese. The leaflets would be dropped by airplanes. It was one of the greatest days when Netaji recruited me to the Azad Hind Fauj.”\n\n“Bengal used to be the hub of revolutionary activities and I was simmering with rage to liberate the country from the colonists. Netaji always told us that if we reached Chittagong than the British will be driven out in a humiliating manner.”\n\nHowever that dream remained unfulfilled as the British recaptured Singapore and the INA members were deported back. At that time, the legal proceedings and the convictions were made under a three-fold system, White, Grey and Black. The whites were the ones who testified that their reason to join INA was due to poverty or need of money and they were given least punishments. The grey category was for those convicted for harbouring mild nationalistic feelings. The last category of ‘black' was for ones who were guided by feelings of liberation and extremism to the core and had joined the INA solely to win India's independence. This category was meted out the harshest punishment. Umesh Chandra Dev Choudhury was one amongst the 20,000 blacks.\n\nIn 1946, after serving a sentence at Multan Jail, (now in Pakistan) he came back to Assam in December with a certificate stating ‘Unfit to serve in British India' and was treated like an outcast. It took four more years after independence for the certificate to be revoked and in 1951 he was recognised as a freedom fighter.\n\nHabits die hard. At the age of 95, his defiance and anger hasn't deserted him. “This is not the independence we fought for. It is painful for me to see our present bunch of so called leaders. Their day of reckoning will come soon,” he warns.\n\nThe beauty of simplicity\n\nMridula Barooah – the name evokes a vivid image of an alluringly beautiful village girl, the kind that you read about in story books and the girl every man fancies to take home to their mother. Setting many a heart aflutter with her looks and acting prowess, this beautiful lady was one of the few leading ladies of the small but purposeful Assamese film industry, from the late 70s and 80s, till the early nineties.\n\nEarly days\n\nHailing from the small town of Sootea, in Sonitpur district of Assam, the Barooah family comprising of six children and the parents moved to Biswanath Chariali. Her father, Jogendranath Barooah, was the ‘outdoor incharge’ at the Pratapgarh tea estate and it was from here that the young Mridula Barooah started her theatrical journey by acting in dramas in school.\n\nRecalling her introduction to acting she says, “As a child, I and my siblings went to watch movies and films with child artists in them used to be a great source of observation for us. After coming back we would compete with each other to re-enact the scenes that we had seen.”\n\nHowever, her initiation into acting came much later. “Due to varied reasons I didn’t act in school plays earlier than the 10th standard. I was a painfully shy girl and the school was in Sootea, which was quite far from my home at the Pratapgarh tea estate. However, when I was in the tenth standard I decided enough was enough and that year I took part in everything right from games to drama and won prizes too!”\n\nIt was here that she received the third prize in the drama competition, the first of many awards to follow.\n\nAnother stepping stone for her imminent film career was when she received the first prize at a state level drama competition (All Assam Surjya Bora Memorial one act play competition) when she was in college.\n\nIt was here amidst this culturally vibrant atmosphere that she was discovered by director/ actor Abdul Majid who had gone to enact a role in a movie. She was promptly signed up for her first film Upopath (opposite Pranjal Saikia) with Hemanta Dutta as director and Pramod Baruah as producer. In the meantime, actor Hiren Choudhury too, saw this young girl at work and told director Dwijendra Narayan Deb who was looking for new faces for his film, Moromi. Mridula Barooah was offered the title role and thus at the young age, she had two roles opposite leading stars of the day and was juggling college and films at the same time.\n\n“I still don’t know how everything happened but it is all thanks to these people. Everybody was very nice and cooperative. They perhaps saw something in me and thus I was offered two roles in two films so quickly.” Although Upopath was her first signed film, Moromi was her first released film.\n\nUnlike in many cases, there was no resistance towards her acting career on the part of her parents. “There was only one condition and that was to be good at whatever I did.” And she did more than ‘good’.\n\nIn 1979, came the film Megha Mukti, where she played the role of twin sisters (the first double role in Assamese films) which established her among the public but it was the twin super hits of Buwari and Kokadeuta, Nati aru Hati which did away with any remaining doubts as to her acting abilities and firmly cemented her place in the hearts of the people.\n\nSuccess followed with films like Maa and Protima which incidentally were films with women centric roles, roles where many a time she had to essay characters older than her real age.\n\nReflecting on this she says, “The eighties was a very good era for Assamese films in all senses and maybe it was due to the society of the period that directors were focusing more on women centric roles. Today, of course, it’s a quite different scenario.”\n\nIn the nineties, when she was at her peak, however roles and films dried up due to unrest of secessionist groups and a general demise of production houses.\n\nAlthough, it would be difficult for viewers to let go of the image of the sweet innocent rustic girl attached to her, she still essayed few different roles whenever she was offered one. In Hiya Diya Niya she essayed a negative role, in Dr Bhabendra Nath Saikia’s Kaal Sandhya , where she had a guest appearance; she played the character of an innocent woman who submits to the vagaries of fate and has shades of grey. Similarly her roles in Aborton, Itihaas and Gun Gun Gaane Gaane fetched her critical acclaim.\n\nToday, she is quite content with the way things have panned out and her long journey from lead actress to a matriarchal guide on screen. “You do feel it when suddenly you realize one day that you are no longer going to be the leading lady but it is only momentary. Playing my own age is what gives me immense satisfaction now,” says Barooah.\n\nAdding to her repertoire, she also turned producer in the early 2000s and produced serials for Doordarshan. She also produced documentaries for the state government.\n\nDue to a persistent leg ailment she had to spend five years from 2007 to 2011 on the sidelines but now she is ready to face the lights again and has recently completed shooting for the film Bir Chilarai.\n\nShe is however hopeful that the good times of Assamese films would come back. “The new generation of artists is very talented and if they gain access to more resources they could definitely do a lot better.”\n\nThings you did not know about her and a few memorable moments\n\nShe had an immense desire to be a teacher, a desire she nourishes till date.\n\nFavourite actor – Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nFavourite actress – Jaya Bachchan.\n\nFavourite performance of her own – Protima, Itihas, Gungun Gaane, Ahir Bhairav.\n\nMemorable moments in her own words\n\nIn the film, Shakuntala aru Shankar Joseph Ali, my character dies towards the end. My ‘body’ was carried through the streets of Guwahati on a mini truck. Now most people obviously didn’t know that it was not a real funeral procession and so many started paying their respects from a distance. The truck was just passing a city bus and it so happened that there was a young boy standing on the doorstep. The cameras were not rolling at the moment so I decided to open my eyes for a second. It was at that precise moment that the boy’s eyes and my eyes met as he was about to gesture as a mark of respect towards my ‘body’. To this day, I cannot forget the look on his face. I cannot describe that look. I guess it was a mix of terror and horror for him.\n\nBrief bio-data\n\nBirthday:\n\nApril 14\n\nAwards:\n\n(The list given is not the complete list but a brief representation)\n\nBest actress for Kokadeuta, Nati aru Hati in 1984 awarded by Assam Silpi Samity\n\nBest supporting actress for Maa in 1987, awarded by Eastern India Motion Pictures\n\nLife time contribution to the Assamese film industry award in 2006 by Yotirupa, Assam\n\nAssam state govt. award for best supporting actor in 2005\n\nAs a Producer:\n\nProduced documentaries for Doordarshan.\n\nExcerpt from Buwari:\n\nThe origin of Assamese Cinema can be traced back to the dreams and imagination of a revolutionary visionary, Rupkonwar Jyotiprasad Agarwala, who was also a distinguished poet, playwright, composer and freedom fighter. He was instrumental in the production of the first Assamese Film Joymati, under the banner of Critrakala Movietone. Due to the lack of trained technicians, Jyotiprasad, , had to shoulder the added responsibilities of the script writer, producer, director, choreographer, editor, set and costume designer, lyricist and music director while making his maiden film. The film, completed with a budget of Rupees sixty thousand was released on March 10th, 1935. It was the third Indian talkie to be released, a fact unknown to many. It is unfortunate that like so many early Indian films, the negatives and complete prints of Joymati are missing.\n\nThe film did not do well and Jyotiprasad Agarwala had to endure heavy losses. However, despite the failure of his venture, Jyotiprasad made another film after a lapse of two years titled Indramalati (1939). It was his second and last film. The eminent composer and singer of Assam Dr. Bhupen Hazarika, played a stellar role in the film.. With the passing away of Jyotiprasad, the Assamese film scenario witnessed a temporary lull for about a couple of years. But things changed with the onset of war, Taking advantage of this, the Late Rohini Kumar Baruah made a film on a relevant historical topic called Manomati (1941). It was followed by films like Parvati Baruah’s Rupahi (1946), Kamal Narayan choudhury’s Badan Barphukan (1947), Phani Sharma’s Siraj, Asit Sen’s Biplabi, Prabin Phukan’s Parghat and Suresh Goswami’s Runumi.\n\nBut the most remarkable film of the fifties was Piyali Phukan which went on to win a National award. In 1955, a new talent Nip Barua made his directorial debut with Smriti Paras. His subsequent films Mak Aaru Moram and Ranga Police bagged many state awards and a silver medal at the national level. Dr. Bhupen Hazarika also produced and directed his first film Era Batur Sur. Prabhat Mukherjee made a film on the universality of mother-hood, Puberan (1959),which was shown at the Berlin Film Festival. The next memorable production was Lachit Borphukan by Sarbeswar Chakraborty. Dr. Bhupen Hazarika made his unforgettable musical Shakuntala (1961) which proved equally successful with critics and the press. It also won a president’s award. Following this, a number of films began to be produced regularlyproduction and were released. These included Nip Barua’s Narakasur, Anil Choudhury’s Matri Swarga, Brojen Barua’s Itu Situ Bahuto and Mukta & Anwar Hussain’s Tejimala.\n\nBy the mid-sixties , film were produced regularly in Assam and 62 films were produced between 1935 to 1970. Besides the film makers already referred to, many others engaged in film making during the period included Pravin Sharma, Saila Barua, Abdul Mazid, Amar Pathak, Indukal Pattazarika, Diben Barua, Debkumar Basu, Amulya Manna, Gauri Barman, Atul Bardoloi, Sujit Singh, Nalin Duara and Prafulla Barua.\n\nDuring the period of 1970-82 a total of 57 Assamese films were made. The emergence of new directors also bolstered the health of the fast maturing industry. Samarendra Narayan Deb’s Aranya (1970), Kamal Choudhury’s Bhaity (1972) the first colour film of Assam, Manoranjan Sur’s Uttaran (1973), Deuti Barua’s Bristi (1974) Pulok Gogoi’s Khoj (1974) Padam Barua’s Ganga Chilanir Pakhi (1976) and Dr. Bhabendranath Saikia’s Sandhya Rag (1977) and Atul Bordoloi’s Kollol (1978) are films worth – mentioning.\n\nThe outstanding directors of contemporary Assamese Cinema are Jahnu Baruah (Aparoopa, Papori, Haladhia Choraye Baodhan Khai, Banani, Firingoti, Hkhagoroloi Bohu Door) ; Sanjeev Hazarika (Haladhar, Meemanxa); Late Dr. Bhabendaranath Saikia (Anirbaan, Agnisnaan, Sarothi, Kolahol, Abartan, Itihaas, Kaal Sandhya) Dr. Santwana Bordoloi (Adajya) and Bidyut Chakraborty (Rag Birag).

A. were influenced by the sorrow and happiness, struggle and hope of the common masses and associated themselves with the creative work related to folk music and culture of the common Assamese people. Era Bator Sur was also a result of one such effort. The story and the music of Era Bator Sur reflects the emotional upsurge of the people of that era.

The bulk of his innovations are for people who cannot afford to buy the machinery. To these people, he gives away his machinery for free.\n\nAt a time when more and more people are leaving their homes in the Northeast to build their careers and lives abroad, hidden from the glitz and glamour of the big cities, far from sophisticated laboratories, one man toils away to make life easier for those amongst us who are less fortunate. Meet scientist, innovator and social entrepreneur Uddhab Bharali, a person whose seemingly innocuous innovations mask their tremendous utility.\n\nWith various award-winning designs such as the areca nut peeler, cement brick making machine, mini-CTC plant for small tea growers, cassava peeler and pomegranate de-seeder to his name, Uddhab Bharali is proof that inventions can be a tool for social service.\n\nIt is a pleasant afternoon and the sun is just beginning to go down for the day. A light breeze tickles the senses and the leaves of the neighbouring coconut tree.\n\nThe little man sitting in front of me is attentive as I put forward my questions. I ask him how he would define innovation. Suddenly, he stares at the coconut leaves and remarks, “Except for a safety pin and a zipper, we could innovate everything.The key to innovation lies in those coconut leaves too. Let me illustrate. Almost every rural household in Assam has a coconut tree and many people make a living by selling coconuts, but if there were a machine to process the leaves to make brooms out of them, this would add to the farmers’ existing income. This is innovation.”\n\nIt is this zeal that has led him to come up with 98 engineering devices which help make life easier and generate income for previously unemployed and low income households. “I am perhaps the only man in the world who can proudly claim that innovation is my profession,” smiles Bharali.\n\nBharali, originally from North Lakhimpur, has come a long way since the days of his first innovation in 1988 and, as is the scenario in most cases, he didn’t have it easy. “I had to repay a family loan of Rs 18 lakh and the bank was at my doorstep to take all our property. I was desperate,” he remembers. In those days, there was a great demand for polythene film-making plants which used to cost around Rs 5.7 lakh. Bharali had in his mind a design for a similar plant for much less. The bank agreed to lend him Rs 1 lakh. This was, he says, his only way to try and pay off the loan and save his family. He came up with a unit that cost only Rs 67,000. The product became a hit and there was no looking back for him after that. He realised that he could make a living as an innovator.\n\nNone of his innovations are for large-scale commercialisation. Instead, they are targeted at rural low-income households. He explains, “My designs are meant for people in need. Once upon a time I had nothing. I used to skip meals and sleep on an empty stomach. My innovations should mean something to those who are deprived. I am not here to strike business deals with huge corporate houses.”\n\nBharali charges nominal fixed sums of money from government and private parties as a consultant. But the bulk of his innovations are for people who cannot afford to buy the machinery. To these people, he gives away his machinery for free.\n\nTo keep the cost of the product down, he makes the design itself simple. Machines are usually built at the UKB Agrotech machine designing research centre, Bharali’s own institution, which he says is the only machine designing research centre in the country. “Earlier, all the machines were made at the centre only but nowadays, if it is a slightly larger device, the parts are made by different people in my home district and sent to UKB to be assembled.”\n\nHe carries forward that same zeal for innovation in teaching too by having a unique training scheme where, irrespective of one’s education, a three-month course is created for youngsters who are trained on the job by allowing them to assist his staff at the design centre. Departing from the usual practice of charging money for training, the students are instead given a stipend of Rs 1,000 and free medicines are provided to their families in times of need. This, according to Bharali is done to encourage the poor youth in the villages to come forth. However, this training comes at one cost, a self-enriching one at that. After the end of the three months, each trainee has to have acquired requisite knowledge to be able to earn Rs 2,000 from Bharali.\n\nIt is this attitude of thinking differently that has resulted in him getting recognition in the form of prestigious awards including the President’s Award for Innovation in 2009, Shristi Samman – Master Innovator Award by National Innovation Foundation, India, in 2007 and also the Meritorious Invention Award 2010 from the department of science and technology, government of India. He is also a nominee for ‘The Tech Award’ a program of Tech Museum, San Jose, California this year. He also found mention in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) journal in 2006 for his innovation of the pomegranate de-seeding machine. He was featured by Discovery channel in 2007, which he believes was responsible for some of his subsequent fame.\n\nWith so much fame and recognition, one would think that his dream would be to settle in a big city, but Bharali has shunned all glamour and is content working in his small hometown. He reasons, “See, it is very good to dream and the grass always looks greener on the other side but my philosophy is that, If I cannot local problems here, how can I even dream of solving the problems of the globe ? I think the environment where I work now is conducive to my creations. Had I been in a big city like Guwahati the glamour wouldn’t have let me work as much as I do now.”\n\nNinety-eight machines later, there are no signs of tiring. He is working on his dream project of building a mechanised toilet for the handicapped. He says, “The physically disabled in most cases have to remain dependent on a lot of things throughout life and in many cases for very private things like dressing, using the toilet and for feeding themselves. I would consider it to be my proudest moment as a human being if I could come up with an innovation in terms of a wheelchair which offers them all these benefits. The wheel chair will have a facility for automatic dressing and undressing of the person, attached toilet and flushing system. The chair is ready but I am still working on the certain aspects of this innovation.” He is trying to extract carbon from fly ash which is a problem for a client and also working on developing a rolling table for small tea growers. Two other future projects would be to remove iron and arsenic from drinking water in rural areas.\n\nAll of his innovations are registered with the National Innovation Foundation (NIF), an autonomous body of the department of science and technology, government of India. Right now, all the innovations are in the process of getting patented.\n\nBharali’s work and talent has been recognised in different prestigious academic institutions across the country and thus he is associated with the Rural Technological Action Group (RUTAG) of IIT, Guwahati. He is also a guest faculty at the Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship (IIE), Guwahati and a resource scholar to numerous schools and colleges in the state.\n\nHowever, despite so much recognition, Bharali remains mindful of his humble origins and sees recognition as a means to connect to needy people. He says, “I have been fortunate enough to be recognised for my work. But today, I see recognition in a slightly different way. Recognition connects me to the needy and helps me to reach out to them.”\n\nInventiveness:\n\nAmong his innovations are the remi-recortication machine; areca nut peeler which has found customers in Indonesia and Ethiopia; cassava peeler which has been bought in Kenya, pomegranate de-seeder which has been exported to US and Turkey; garlic-peeling machine; tobacco-leaf cutter; paddy thresher; cane-stripping machine; brass utensil polishing machine; safed musli-peeling machine; jatropha de-seeder; mechanised weeding machine; passion fruit juice extractor; trench digger and a chopper for cattle and fisheries feed. He also designed a stevia pulveriser; multipurpose herbal dyer and passion fruit gel extractor.\n\nWith our very limited resources, we always strive to bring new things to you and, thus, for the first time on the internet, we bring you a short introduction to various spring festivals of Northeast India in one article. We are not above mistakes and, thus, if anyone notices any errors in terms of the information provided, kindly do write to us and we will rectify the same.\n\nSpring festivals of Northeast India\n\nVarious groups of people belonging to different castes and tribes constitute what is known as the Northeast India and make it extremely rich in terms of arts and culture. There are more than 75 tribes and clans who speak more than 400 languages and dialects in this region. Although all the seven states of Manipur, Mizoram, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura and Arunachal are politically defined as separate states (Sikkim forming the eighth state now), despite the vast diversity, there some common cultural threads of unity that knit together the diversity. Maybe, that is why the seven states are known as seven sisters and Sikkim is called the brother.\n\nNortheast India, blessed with nature’s bounty, becomes moist and beautiful with the advent of spring. Along with the advent of the New Year, this also marks the onset of the agricultural season. That is why this is the period when festivals and celebrations engulf the entire region. Although some start their celebrations a bit early and others start a bit late, the atmosphere and weather remains the same and also the purpose of celebrating are quite similar. It is observed that in some festivals the way of conducting them are also similar.\n\nThe agricultural festival celebrated in Assam to welcome the spring is known as Bihu. Irrespective of caste, creed, language and religion this is a festival that is revered among all and it can be called the state festival of Assam. Along with the Aryan people in Assam, the Tai, Bodo, Chutia (Tibeto-Burman), Austric, tea tribes and migrant Muslims also celebrate the festival with such fervour and gaiety that it even transcends the barrier of religion. By doing this, it is able to unite people irrespective of religious differences. Merriment, songs and dance, dresses and ornaments, musical instruments and different cuisines make it the most colourful festival of Assam. Bihu begins in the middle of the months of Sot and Bohag (mid-April). Bihu continues for seven days starting from the day of Dumahi and under the names of Goru Bihu, Manuh Bihu, Saat Bihu, Senehi Bihu, Maiki Bihu, Rongali Bihu and Chera Bihu. The day before Dumahi is called Uruka. The start and end of the festival differs according to the community and place. The tribes of Bodos, Deuris, Lalungs (tiwa), Rabha, Mising, Dimasa, Tai, Garo and others also celebrate spring time festivals like Bihu. The Bodos call it Baisagu, the Deuris call it Bisu, Tais call it Boihu or Bihu, Dimasas call it Bushu, Rabhas call it Baikhu and the Garos call it Rongasugala. Most tribes’ spring festivals, like Bihu, start from the first Wednesday of the month of Bohag, since Wednesday is considered to be a very holy day.\n\nThe Bodos of the Mongoloid origins celebrate the seven day long colourful Baisagu festival. Along with welcoming the New Year, they also start cultivation.\n\nThe Misings celebrate the Ali Aye Ligang festival. The word ‘Ali’ means ‘seeds’, ‘Aye’ means ‘fruits’ and ‘Ligang’ means ‘sowing’. As with many other festivals in Northeast India prayer, dance and feasting are integral parts of the festival. The festival starts on the day of sowing of Aahu (upland rice) and Bau (deep water rice) paddy. Starting on the first day of the month of Fagun (February), the festival continues for five days. Playing the instruments like Dhol, Pepa, Gogana, Borkah, taal, the youth celebrate and perform the Gumrag dance. In order to pray for a prosperous new year, they remember their ancestors and the nature god Donyi Polo (sun and moon).\n\nSimilarly, the Dimasas, celebrate the Bushu festival in the mid of Fagun and Sot month.\n\nRabhas celebrate the Baikhu festival before starting their cultivation in spring. In this festival, they worship the god Baikhu, to make the earth fertile. The Rabha youth sing sathar songs to stimulate nature.\n\nThe Tai Buddhists living in the plains of Assam also celebrate Poiu Chang Ken (the water splashing festival). Tai khamti, Tai Phake, Tai Aiton, Tai Turung and Tai Khamyangs celebrate this festival. In observance of this festival, they perform ablutions on the statue of Buddha after bringing it outside the temples. The youth express joy and celebrate by throwing water and mud on each other.\n\nTribes of Arunachal, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya also celebrate spring festivals. The Nocte, Tangsa and Tutsa tribes from the Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh celebrate a festival called Loku which is celebrated three times in a year. The Loku which they celebrate during spring is called Kap Khut Loku. During this festival they celebrate by consuming the meat of pigs and chicken and sing and dance to the beats of drums, flutes and other musical instruments. During this time, the Tangsa and Tutsas celebrate Loku by singing songs with erotic undertones. These songs are also a means of expressing their emotions. The Wangchos and Konyak tribes of Nagaland also celebrate this kind of festival just before sowing of Aahu dhan in the month of Fagun and Sot (March- April).\n\nChristianity and modernity has greatly influenced the tribes like the Ao, Angami, Lotha, Sema and other major tribes of Nagaland and because of that there is a gradual decrease in the observance of their rites, rituals, festivals and celebrations. But despite these external influences, they have tried to preserve their culture. Tsungrem Mong and Moatsu are two agricultural spring festivals of the Aos. The Angami Nagas celebrate a ten day festival in the month of February called Sekrenyi. The festival is celebrated after harvesting and falls on the 25th day of the Angami month of Kezei. Angamis cut steppes on the sides of the hill to cultivate their crops. In the month of April, they thresh the crops and celebrate the Ngyui festival. The Sema nagas celebrate their spring festival once they hear the voice of the koel bird. Aoling is a 6-day festival observed by the Konyaks after the completion of sowing. It marks the end of the winter, the beginning of spring and the New Year. The Shishu festival of the Rengmas is also a spring time agricultural festival. The Sangtam nagas spring festival, Nyitsumu is also celebrated for three days which has a similarity with the sowing festival of Misings known as Ali Aye Ligang. Nazu is another 10 day long festival celebrated by the Pochury tribe of Nagaland in February prior to the sowing of seeds to bid farewell to the old year and welcome the New Year. The Tanghkhul Nagas also have a sowing festival to celebrate the feel of the spring. Mao, Kobbui and other naga communities also have their spring festivals.\n\nThe Mizos and the Lushais also have the festival of Chapchar where dance and songs take precedence. The Meitis of Manipur also have a festival to welcome the New Year and spring called Soirua.\n\nThe Syiem community of Khasis of Meghalaya also celebrate the Nongkrem festival for five days within the months of May, June and July.\n\nArunachal Pradesh is a melting pot of varied and colourful cultures. Each of the tribes living in Arunachal has their own distinct culture. Monpa, Sherdukpen and other Buddhist communities celebrate Buddha purnima (birthday of Buddha) during spring. The Khamtis and Singhpos also celebrate similar festivals. These festivals are however basically religious festivals. The Mopin festival of the Galo Adis also bears resemblance to the Bohag Bihu of Assam in terms of organization and objective. Adis also celebrate Aam Dorung and Aam Dangdorun festivals with gaiety and merriment. The Mloku festival of Apatanis is also a similar festival.\n\nIn this way, we see that the entire Northeast India celebrates varied and colourful spring festivals. In many of them, similarity of character is seen in terms of welcoming the New Year and their agricultural character. This has helped to foster a spirit of unity in diversity in the culture of this region. Commonness can be seen even in the distinct instruments, clothes, food, ornaments, rituals and rites of the different communities.\n\nA very brief overview of the various festivals of Northeast India is sought to be given here and there is a need for more research and studies regarding this aspect of the culture. In this area fertile with cultural richness, the field of research is still a virgin territory.\n\nTranslated from Assamese by Rupkamal Sarma\n\nPost photo by Arindam Talukdar\n\nLong before scripted drama came into existence; man had started using puppets to convey varied messages. Puppets seem to have existed since time immemorial in civilizations across the globe. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, in Europe, the written records for use of puppets go back to the 5th century B.C. whereas in Asia there are ancient traditions of puppet theatre, the origin of which cannot be determined.\n\nIndia has an ancient tradition of puppet theatre which can be traced back to the time of the civilizations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro.\n\nAlthough there are other types of puppetry in India, string puppetry is common to India and is practiced in the states of Rajasthan, Kerala, Karnataka, West Bengal, Assam, Orissa, Tripura, Manipur, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIn Manipur, art and culture are not merely entertainment or decoration but also a form of religious expression given the deep roots of the people in vaishnavism.\n\nTwo types of puppets have been prevalent in Manipur since ages – string and rod. The themes for puppet theatre are mostly based on myths and legends and stories from the epics.\n\nPuppet dance has a separate name of its own in Manipur: Laithibi Jagoi (Laithibi meaning doll and Jagoi meaning dance). The traditional string puppet of Manipur is known as ‘Hang- Lai Jagoi’ and is colourfully dressed and highly stylized.\n\nThe themes of puppets are based on the stories of Radha and Lord Krishna. In Manipur, the puppeteer plays with Mridanga and Khon-Pung. The delivery of dialogues, the movements of the puppet and the musicians are very well synchronized. String puppetry, resembling human or divine figures, is performed at Rasleela, whereas puppet-shows with animal and demonic forms are performed during Gostha Leela.\n\nPuppetry in Manipur and its implementation\n\nIt is said that the art of puppetry was introduced in Manipur during the reign of Maharaj Chandrakriti Singh (1850-1886) in Goura-Leela under the supervision of Oja Ngangbam Mala Singh of Uripok, Imphal. Although, it may be mentioned here that puppet theatre in Manipur is said to be even older than human theatre. According to Late Guru Kongrailatpam Madangopal Sharma of Uripok Tera, Imphal, one of the pioneer puppeteers of Manipur, puppets were used after the Nipa Pala and just before the start of Goura-Leela as pungyeiba (Mridanga player), Tanyeiba (percussion music player) and dancer (puppet dancer) in the Goura-Leela performance. In this way, puppetry in Manipur was first introduced through the Goura-Leela.\n\nThis form of puppet theatre is based on the life and works of Gauranga Mahaprabhu, a passionate devotee of Lord Krishna, who lived in Nadia region of West Bengal. Mahaprabhu, who sang praises of God and propagated Bhakti Yoga, is revered by many Hindus in Bengal and Manipur as a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu.\n\nThere are also records of Shri Ngangbam Udhop Singh, the exponent of modern Manipuri puppetry performing before foreign dignitaries in Calcutta (Kolkata) during the reign of Maharaja Sir Shurachandra Singh (CBE).\n\nThe puppeteers sit on an elevated platform and a black screen is hung from the floor of the platform to the stage where the puppets are put. The puppets are lowered to the stage and moved around with the aid of black strings which are not visible due to the black screen in the background.\n\nToday, with much more flashier modern distractions at hand, it is a struggle to keep puppetry alive in Manipur as Gurumayum Jadu Sharma would say. The founder of the Moppet Decoration and Cultural Centre, Manipur the only puppetry centre in the state, he hopes that future generations would take up puppetry.\n\nIt is with this hope that he has also passed down his skills with the strings to his son, Basanta Sharma.\n\n“It is an expensive art. From making the puppets to organizing the shows, we have to spend money on everything. Financial aid is almost negligible”, says Basanta Sharma.\n\nPuppets tell stories and convey tales. They connect us with a simpler time of the past and carry messages for the present. They are catalysts for social change. If they die, some stories also die along with them and it is stories that keep us alive. Hopefully some concerned people will wake up to the need of preservation of this art form soon before it is too late.\n\nAll photos by the author.\n\nThe Bodos are the numerically predominant ethnic and linguistic group of the Brahmaputra Valley. They are also found in different parts of the country, particularly in North Bengal. Irrespective of their place of habitation, Bodos are maintaining their customs, tradition and language in the state of Assam.\n\nRice is their staple food and they are by food habit non vegetarian. Apart from rice, they also cultivate jute, pulses, mustard, other cash crops and a number of vegetables. Rearing silk (Endi) worm and weaving is an integral part of Bodo culture. Poultry, pig and goat farming are very common in a Bodo household, fishing being one of the oldest practices.\n\nThe Bodos lead a simple pastoral and bucolic life; the practice of which in modern times is called the slow food, i e, \"growing locally\" and \"eating locally\", which is now espoused by the Slow Food International. However, because of pressure on space, their habitat is sinking and they are now scattered all over the globe. Many of them are doing extremely well in their fields of activities, including some high profile professions.\n\nMy quest for hidden facts about Bodo culture and cuisine has often led me to exotic findings over the years. Shared here is my experience through my lens and a little narrative about catching crabs in the village.\n\nBodos cook a wide variety of tidbits with crabs, which is low in saturated fat, yet a good source of vitamin C, vitamin B12, protein, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, copper and selenium. Of course one should not forget that crabs are high in cholesterol and sodium.\n\nMy observation is that Bodos enjoy catching crabs as much as they love cooking and eating them.\n\nCrabs are found both in fresh water as well as in low lying areas where rain water stagnates leaving the area muddy in semi tropical regions of the Brahmaputra valley.\n\nIt’s amazing watching young boys diving into the river and hunting for crabs with bare hands by holding them top down to avoid the deadly pincers.\n\nThese crabs are called ‘Khangkhrai Naga’. They are black shelled and large in size. The mature ones grow much larger than the ones seen in the picture below. One should be an expert to catch a crab as even a little hint of an enemy approaching them, makes them stretch out their pincers menacingly. It would be most unfortunate if one is caught by these pincers as they can knock the daylights out of you. Khangkhrai naga hasn’t got much taste, has worms in them which needs to be cleaned properly before cooking.\n\n‘Khangkhrai Dubri’ is a tiny variety of crab, with uneven carapace, protecting them from attacks by bigger species. Their size is not bigger than the thumb but they have lot of fat and taste great. They are found both in fresh water as well as in ponds and are caught in the process of fishing.\n\nDuring monsoon, the rivers swell up and crab holes are filled with water, they come out and take shelter in the higher grounds or on the reeds and water hyacinths. During this time, it is easier to hunt crabs by pulling the water hyacinths to the shore and catching them aplenty. They are also found in abundance when the river and small water bodies dry up in winter.\n\n‘Khangkhrai Jamin’ is yet another variety of crab. Unlike others, this variety has a distinct red edge around the shell. They are very pretty to look at and not commonly found. They are mostly caught in the channels or small water bodies during summer by hand, ducking deep into the water. It is also a popular sport among the youngsters of the village to catch crabs as well as play in the water during the very hot and humid months of summer.\n\nThen there is a common variety which is found while fishing, round the year. They are not too big, little brownish-yellow in colour. They do not grow any bigger than shown in the picture below. They are generally cooked as a curry or pounded into a chutney.\n\nThe best/tastiest crab is ‘Khangkhrai Alari’, extremely delicious with plenty of fat. They are found in the paddy fields. After the first shower, followed by paddy cultivation during the months of June-July the underground crab-holes of khangkhrai alari are filled with water,forcing them to come out to the surface in great numbers and that is when they get caught. They are also found taking shelter in the water hyacinths, when the rivers overflow in summer.\n\nExcept for the shell and the four pairs of walking legs, all parts of crab can be eaten. The soft meat of the pair of chelipeds of big crabs can be eaten by breaking off the hard outer cover.\n\nThe plump claws or chelipeds (as seen in the adjacent picture) can be eaten after cutting off the long sword like ends called the pincers. This part is full of flesh and very tasty.\n\nCleaning the crab before cooking is as much interesting to watch as watching crab hunting. A skilled and experienced hand is required to wash a crab thoroughly before removing the four pairs of walking legs.\n\nThen the shell is broken in half to take out the meat and fat, before discarding the shell.\n\nThe fat content in Khangkhrai Alari enhances the taste of the curry. Although my favourite is crab soup, the two extremely delicious indigenous Bodo crab recipes I have learnt, cooked and tasted are Khangkhrai Jwng Maitha Jwng and Ondla Jwng Khangkrai Jwng.\n\nCrabs are packed in small woven bamboo pouches and sold in the markets of nearby townships at a minimal price of around Rs.40 a kilo.\n\nFascinated by the thin strips of raw bamboo weave of the pouch, I bought one. As the strings that tied the mouth of the pouch were untied, all of them crawled out at such a war like speed as if a whole army charged ahead towards the enemy. I shrieked and ran for my dear life at the sight of their pincers, all stretched out for a deadly pinch.\n\nBodo terms\n\nKhangkhrai: Crab\n\nPost photos by the author.\n\nAccording to popular belief, Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya, derives its name from U Shulong (the one that came to exist), who was born in Bisi village on the slopes of what is called the Shillong peak today. As a boy, U Shulong declared to his mother, Ka Lir, that he belonged to a divine order, which would bestow justice and democratic governance on the people.\n\nKnown as the ‘Scotland of the East’, the city boasts of rolling hills, benign lakes, lyrical rivers, lissome flowers and orchids, pines that stand sentinels and shady groves.\n\nUnlike many states in the North-East, there are no Inner Line Permit requirements for tourists in Meghalaya. Our trip to discover this state began at Paltan Bazar in Guwahati, which is the nerve centre of transport connecting different parts of the northeast. A whirlpool of vehicles, shops and an army of people forever on the move greet the tourist here.Hiring a cab from Guwahati to Shillong could cost between Rs. 1500 to Rs. 2000, or one could travel in cabs on a seat-sharing basis which would cost anywhere between Rs. 200 for an AC Taxi to Rs. 140 for non-AC.\n\nWe drove on probably one of the busiest roads in the northeast – the Guwahati-Shillong highway – with innumerable trucks plying on this one-lane thoroughfare. The three-hour journey takes one to Meghalaya with a brief stopover at Nangphu.\n\nTea at Nangphu is almost a ritual for travellers to Shillong.There are few roadside dhabas here which serve breakfast or lunch for passengers plying between the two states. However, if one is fond of pickles, this is the place to be – take your pick from a wide range, from mango to bamboo-shoot pickles. A quick lunch here and our cab embarked on the second leg of our journey to Shillong, as I waited breathlessly to glimpse the famed Barapani Lake.\n\nLocally known as Umiam, this lake is situated 15 km from Shillong and is built on the reservoir of the Umiam Hydro Electric Project in Ri Bhoi district. Surrounded by sylvan hills with an army of pine trees on all sides, the lake shimmers under the blue sky on a sunny day.\n\nFor adventure freaks, a water sports complex provides a choice of row-boats, paddle-boats, cruise boats, sailing boats, water scooters and even speed boats. This is a popular spot for picnics, fishing and water sports. Just next to it is the Lum Nehru Park, another raging favourite with picnickers.\n\nCherrapunji’s Charm\n\nCherrapunji, locally known as Sohra, is 52 km from Shillong. The town was the capital of British Assam from 1832 to 1866, but lost that status to Shillong because of its severe climate. Cherrapunji once had the distinction of being the wettest place on earth, which it has now lost to nearby Mawsynram.\n\nThe taxi ride to Cherrapunji and back will cost you around Rs 1500. The package includes visits to the Nokhalikhai Falls, Seven Sister Falls, Eco Park cave and Ramkrishna Mission.On our way to Nokhalikhai, thick fog engulfed us as the car negotiated steep curves. Even ten-feet visibility was impossible.\n\nAs we made our way through the fog, we discovered, to our utter shock, another thick blanket covering the hill overlooking the falls. Temporarily blinded, we could only hear the deafening boom of invisible water falling from over a hundred feet into the depth of the forest below. “This is a lean tourist season. The peak season is from October to February. You’d have been luckier had you come earlier in the morning,” said a Khasi lady who owned the hotel and handicraft shop besides the fall. With deflated spirits, we began to walk towards the entrance gate.\n\nDo not be surprised to find that most of the shopkeepers in Shillong are ladies. The Khasi community is matriarchal and much more gender-sensitive. According to Khasi tradition, the youngest girl of the family does not move out after marriage. Instead, the groom comes in and settles with the youngest bride’s family.\n\nNext on the itinerary was the Eco Park, the source of the Seven Sister Falls. The entire park is a lush, undulating landscape with flowers and a stream running through. The fog is our constant companion here too. There is an abundance of several hybrid and indigenous orchids in the Green House donated by the Shillong Agri-Horticultural Society. Another sight not to be missed is the bird’s eye view of the Sylhet Plains of neighbouring Bangladesh. From this spectacularly lit scenery, our next destination would give us an experience of darkness and the surreal at the same time.\n\nThe secret of the Mawsmai caves lies in stalagmite found in them, which when subjected to light reflects it, creating a dazzling array of natural lights. Situated under thick dark forest land and spread over 150m, the caves are lit with lamps inside. In certain areas, the water is knee-deep and hence one needs to be cautious about bringing bags, papers or shoes inside.We feel taking children inside this cave would be risky too.\n\nShillong Tour\n\nShillong is situated at an altitude of 1,496m and is the district headquarters of East Khasi Hills District. It has a bracing climate throughout the year. The city has been the seat of government since the consolidation of British rule in this part of India more than a century ago.\n\nWe began our tour with a visit to the Shillong Golf Course and were astonished at its lush green setting. We also tried our hand at playing a shot, albeit unsuccessfully. Developed in 1898, as a nine-hole course, it was later converted to 18 holes in 1924. It is the third-oldest golf course in India and was first surveyed in 1933.\n\nNext stop was Shillong Cathedral. The entire cathedral, the largest I have ever seen, is painted in blue. We then climbed up the highest peak in town – Shillong Peak. The view from the top leaves one speechless. A sense of calm enveloped us as we saw the entire city surrounded by cloud-covered peaks. If you are a shopaholic, you can do tidbits of shopping here before moving on to Police and Bara Bazaar. After a long ascent, it was now time to descend to the Elephant falls.\n\nStepped in 165 staircases, the waterfall comes in three layers taking tourists from the topmost layer to the extreme below. Tourists can get themselves photographed in traditional Khasi attire for a neat Rs. 50.\n\nThe two major shopping areas in town are Police Bazaar and Bara Bazaar. Situated in the heart of Shillong, the bazaars ooze a concoction of modernity and tradition.\n\nIf you have time on your side, try boating at the famed Ward’s Lake or simply watch the city drift by as you sit on one of the benches on its shores.\n\nLocation of Shillong:\n\n[umap id=”125681″ tp=”6″ size=”c” w=”580px” h=”370px” alignment=”center”]\n\nPost photos by the author.\n\nIt was a cold evening, some twenty years ago, in Hongphoi village in Nagaland. In one of the huts, in a corner of a room, sat a morose young man with his head buried in his hands. The room was in darkness except for the glow of a fire burning in the hearth.\n\nHearing a voice, the man lifted his head but there was no one. His eyes turned to the burning logs and the glowing embers in the fire stoked his rage.\n\nThey had made fun of him; he was a disgrace he had been told, a good-for-nothing fellow who could shoulder no responsibility.\n\nThe embers in the hearth seemed to be taunting him. Suddenly, as if to challenge the taunts, the young man thrust his hand into the fire and pounced on the glowing embers. He watched the fire engulf his hand but he made no attempt to withdraw it. Much to his awe and shock he realized that there was no pain and he didn’t feel the heat of the fire.\n\nTwenty years later, nobody calls him good-for-nothing anymore and there is still no pain. Meet forty-six year old Gingto Konyak, the leader of the three fire-eaters from the Konyak tribe.\n\nGingto Konyak, Wangpai Konyak and Chingkai Konyak are the first and also the last of men blessed with a unique gift– the gift of fire-eating.\n\nAll three belong to the village of Hongphoi from Mon district of Nagaland.\n\n“This is no magic, no trick nor any art that one can master through practice. It is just god’s gift that the three of us are lucky to possess,” says the forty year old Wangpai Konyak, whose gift was revealed to him when he went on a hunting expedition in winter.\n\nAt 35, Chingkai, is the youngest of the three and also the most enthusiastic. He reiterates, “These are feats that have to be seen to be believed. We didn’t train for this. It’s a gift”.\n\nSo how does it feel like to eat burnt wood? Chingkai says – The first time I had it, it felt like eating soil; tasteless; but then I got used to it.\n\n“Of course, we have normal food like other people. It is only during the shows that we consume wood”, Chingkai laughs and says.\n\nBesides eating fire and rubbing burning wood all over the body, Gingto Konyak also has the ability to perform feats of super human strength like lifting a wooden bench using only his teeth. However, unlike fire eating this is no gift but the result of sheer determination and will power. “As you can see I am very thin. When I was a teenager, people used to think that I was very weak and they made fun of me saying that I would never be able to work in the fields. It is also quite common for Naga boys to wrestle and exercise but since I was unable to do so, I decided to try out this way for showing my strength. Gradually, over a period of time I mastered this art”.\n\nHowever, despite this unique talent of theirs, life at the village is no different for these men. While Gingto and Wangpai are cultivators, Chingkai is a police constable. It is only in the last seven years that they have started doing public shows like the one at the hornbill festival.\n\n“Obviously, we are very proud of them and we wish that the people in power would do more for these gifted men but so far they have been showcasing their talents at a local level only”, says Nyeiang Konyak, coordinator for the fire-eaters.\n\nPost photos by Suraaj Ajithakumar.\n\nGlimpses of the Hornbill Fest 2011 – Nagaland\n\n[nggallery id=3]"
