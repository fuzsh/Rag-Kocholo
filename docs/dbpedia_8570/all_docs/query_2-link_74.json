        "text": "This article is about the district. For its eponymous headquarters, see Dibrugarh.\n\nTemplate:Infobox district\n\nDibrugarh (Pron:ˌdɪbru:ˈgor:) is an administrative district in the state of Assam in India. The district headquarters are located within the city of Dibrugarh, which the district itself is named for. The district occupies an area of 3381 km².\n\nEtymology[edit]\n\nDibrugarh derived its name from Dibarumukh (as a renowned encampment of Ahoms during the Ahom-Chutia war). Either the name “Dibru” evolved from Dibaru river or from the Bodo-Kachari word “Dibru” which means a “blister” and “Garh” meaning \"fort\". The Bodo-Kacharis add the prefix “Di-” (which means “water”) wherever there is small stream, a river, or a large river in a town or city.[1]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThe region was part of the Chutia Kingdom until the Ahoms occupied it in the year 1523 AD. The Chutia army under the generals Kasitora, Alangi Chetia and Borpatra fought against the Ahoms at Dibrumukh,[2] but were defeated. After the Ahoms captured Sadiya in 1524 AD, bringing an end to the Chutia kingdom, the Ahom king Suhungmung placed an official named Chaolung Shulung to control the region.[3][better source needed] Dibrugarh became a separate district when it was split from Lakhimpur on 2 October 1971.[4] On 1 October 1989 Tinsukia district was split from Dibrugarh.[4]\n\nGeography[edit]\n\nDibrugarh district occupies an area of 3,381 square kilometres (1,305 sq mi),[5] comparatively equivalent to Russia's Vaygach Island.[6] The district extends from 27° 5' 38\" N to 27° 42' 30\" N latitude and 94°33'46\"E to 95°29'8\"E longitude. It is bounded by Dhemaji district on the north, Tinsukia district on the east, Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh on the south-east and Sibsagar district on the north and south-west. The area stretches from the north bank of the Brahmaputra, which flows for a length of 95 km through the northern margin of the district, to the Patkai foothills on the south. The Burhi Dihing, a major tributary of the Brahmaputra with its network of tributaries and wetlands flows through the district from east to west. There is a large tract of Tropical Rainforest in its eastern and southern regions, which is a part of the Dehing Patkai wildlife sanctuary.\n\nEconomy[edit]\n\nTea and oil are the major revenue earners for the district.
