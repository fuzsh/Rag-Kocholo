For its eponymous headquarters, see Dibrugarh.\n\nDistrict of Assam in India\n\nDibrugarh district (Pron:ˌdɪbru:ˈgor:) is a district in the state of Assam in India. The district headquarters are located within the city of Dibrugarh.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nDibrugarh derived its name from Dibarumukh (as a renowned encampment of Ahoms during the Ahom-Chutia war). Either the name “Dibru” evolved from Dibaru river or from the Bodo-Kachari word “Dibru” which means a “blister” and “Garh” meaning \"fort\". The Bodo-Kacharis add the prefix “Di-” (which means “water”) wherever there is small stream, a river, or a large river in a town or city.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nTributary state of Mongmao\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the Brief History of Mengguo Zhanbi, in 1318, Si Kefa, the ruler of Mongmao after conquering southeast states till Lancang river from the Yuan dynasty, appointed his brother Sanlongfa as the general and led an army of 90,000 to attack the king of Mengwei Sari (Upper Assam) in the northwest. In the end, he designed a plan to make Mengwei Sari surrender and pay tribute.[3]\n\nIn Hsweni state chronicle, the two generals Tao Sen Yen and Tao Sen Hai Khai sent with Samlongpha sent a story to Hso Khan Hpa (Si Kefa) that Samlongpha was conspiring with the king of Mong Wehsali Long to dethrone Hso Khan Hpa, Hso Khan Hpa believed the story and sent poison food to Samlongpha and he died at Mongkawng.[4]\n\n16th century\n\n[edit]\n\nThe region was part of the Chutia Kingdom until the Ahoms occupied it in the year 1523 AD. The Chutia army under the generals Kasitora, Alangi Chetia and Borpatra fought against the Ahoms at Dibrumukh,[5] but were defeated. After the Ahoms captured Sadiya in 1524 AD, bringing an end to the Chutia kingdom, the Ahom king Suhungmung placed an official named Chaolung Shulung to control the region.[6]\n\nSince the defeat of the royalists troops at Amaratali of Dibru in 1787 A.D. in the reign of Gaurinath Singha, during the Moamoria rebellion this region came under the Moamarias who also formed there a dominant religious community.[better source needed] Dibrugarh became a separate district when it was split from Lakhimpur on 2 October 1971.[7] On 1 October 1989 Tinsukia district was split from Dibrugarh.[7]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nDibrugarh district occupies an area of 3,381 square kilometres (1,305 sq mi),[8] comparatively equivalent to Russia's Vaygach Island.[9] The district extends from 27° 5' 38\" N to 27° 42' 30\" N latitude and 94°33'46\"E to 95°29'8\"E longitude.
