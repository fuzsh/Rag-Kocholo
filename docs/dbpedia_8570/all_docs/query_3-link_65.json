        "text": "Mundane Musings | The Review Channel by Jubaraj J. Baruah |\n\nMovie: Konikar Ramdhenu (Ride on the rainbow)\n\nDirector: Jahnu Barua\n\nKonikar Ramdhenu like most of his films presents us with the surface of the plot right at the word go. It does deal with the essence of a troubled childhood but it rather focuses more on the psyche than the trouble- here we have a child Kukoi who runs away from his village at the tender age of 11 to work in a garage in the city. Immediately we are presented with an antagonizing garage owner who threatens the kid. All of this is shown as a reminiscence of the kid who now is in a juvenile correction center. The only engaging point for us is to get inside that numbness of Kukoi and wonder the power of guilt that must be building in him for committing a heinous crime like murder. The movie here could have taken two roads – either deal with the dilemma of child molestation and its consequences or select a road less taken by which would be to make us be a part of Kukoi’s journey from that burden of guilt to his world of imagination and freedom. He has killed someone and it is a fact, it cannot be written off, it cannot be wiped from his memory. At the same time while he leads us in this journey, Jahnu Barua also doesn’t completely ignore the issue in hand and keeps referring to the child molestation problem through a set of two different characters. The best part of Konikar Ramdhenu lies in confiding in that utopian world a deprived child loves to live and how his imaginations and fascinations actually make him strive for a better life. Bishnu Khargoria as the mentor of the kid pulls of yet another memorable performance. Moloya Goswami plays the role of a law abiding superintendent by balancing her sympathies and her code of law towards the children and achieves the same effortlessly. The director has always been fascinated with the vastness of the sea and most of his films have a silent hint at the sea. This film cannot be complete without the final song – the song that originates from a certain beat Kukoi always used to play out – we become a part of the dance, the song which the mentor and the child enjoy believing in a better tomorrow. Meghali, the 3 elephants, the 2 cars, the hills, the school teacher, the 3 storeyed school all make Konikar Ramdhenu a memorable film and if you watch it, you will know why.\n\nFrom coming to terms with his musings and his deprived childhood, this here is not a visual experience which will make us contented or nostalgic but will instead make us ponder over the different fates of people – some fortunately misguided against some unfortunately talented people. Konikar Ramdhenu will not let us revisit our childhood but will make us wary of the exploited, deprived, defeated and silenced ones. Here’s a movie that should be watched for its strong visuals and its aura."
