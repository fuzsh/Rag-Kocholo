        "text": "PARIS -- Prime Minister Edouard Balladur called Thursday for maintaining a strong franc and said the parity between the franc and the German mark was the cornerstone of the European Monetary System and the key to a decline in interest rates.\n\nThe new French prime minister, presenting his government's program to the national assembly, also argued that the Bank of France be given considerable autonomy to restore confidence in the economy and guarantee a durable drop in interest rates.\n\n'The great periods of French history have always been those when its money was solid,' he said. 'The stability of the franc, guaranteed by the autonomy of the central bank, is an objective in itself, a national objective made all the more necessary by the general floating of currencies around the world.'\n\nBalladur said the parity between the franc and the German mark was the cornerstone of the European Monetary System, which has come under intense pressure in recent months from speculators. Five of the system's currencies, including the British pound and the Italian lira, have been devalued since last September.\n\nThe pound and lira also withdrew from the European Monetary System, putting into doubt the European Community's ability to create a single currency and central bank to manage it by the end of the century as called for in the Maastricht Treaty on European unity.\n\nBy announcing he would maintain the franc's parity with the mark, Balladur is continuing the policy of a strong franc followed by his Socialist predecessor Pierre Bereovoy, one of only about 70 opposition deputies who followed the speech from a corner of the vast assembly hall. The former prime minister did not applaud.\n\nBalladur called the French-German relationship the key to European economic unity and said it could be maintained only by following fiscal policies that will lead to a 'natural, stable, and lasting relationship between the two currencies.'\n\nThe prime minister said his government was seeking new discussions to reach an agreement on all aspects of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, not just agricultural subsidies.\n\n'We do not accept a system of negotiation carried out in stages and which leads European countries to present a divided front and does not permit an overall view of the world situation,'he said to loud applause.\n\nSince taking office last week following legislative elections that gave the right a crushing majority in the new national assembly, the government has tried to present a moderate view of the agricultural subsidy controversy that has blocked progress on an overall GATT accord.\n\nThe former Socialist government promised to use its veto within the European Community to bloc the proposed agreement on subsidies reached late last year between the EC Commission and Washington.\n\nBut while showing a more flexible approach, Balladur also strongly defended French agriculture and said its pre-eminent place in the economy must be maintained.\n\n'It appears to me essential to assure, under equitable, solid, and long lasting conditions, the future of French agriculture for reasons that are at once moral, national, cultural, economical and political,' he said. 'There are not many areas in which France is the world's second largest exporter. She is in the area of agriculture, and she should remain so.'\n\nThe new prime minister, whose first steps since taking office have been well received by the public and press, devoted a large portion of his speech to economic problems, especially growing unemployment.\n\nBalladur announced a series of measures to reduce the number of jobless by lowering the heavy social charges on companies and increasing vocational and professional training for young people.\n\nBut the prime minister admitted that the unemployment rate, now at more than 10 percent of the population, will continue to grow until at least the end of the year.\n\nHe also confirmed a privatization plan to bring in badly needed revenue to the state's coffers, but said the program would be limited to the competitive sector.\n\nWith the Socialist and Communist opposition reduced to insignificance, the government's major troubles could come from the center-right Union for French Democracy. In responding to Balladur, UDF leader Charles Millon warned that his party would not automatically back the prime minister.\n\n'Our support will be exacting because we need results,' Millon said. 'If we fail, there will be despair and the door will be open to all the extremes.'"
