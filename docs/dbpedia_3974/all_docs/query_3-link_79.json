        "text": "Izmir is Turkey’s third-largest city, located on the coast of the Aegean Sea. This city was a real discovery for me: I came here on business, but Izmir made me fall in love with it. The beautiful promenade, the authentic market, palm trees, sunshine, citrus trees, mussels, and a lot of Turkish tea. Izmir could be described as a laid-back version of Istanbul, where you’re not beckoned at every step or pulled by the hand in the market. Here, few people speak English, but I had no trouble communicating through sign language. It’s an ancient city that is very interesting to walk around. Also an Ephesus is nearby — an ancient Greek city that you can visit on a day trip.\n\nIn this article, I will tell about the main attractions of the city that will allow you to feel its atmosphere. And at the end, I will share three dishes that you definitely must try in Izmir.\n\nAttractions\n\nKonak Square is the heart of Izmir, one of the most vibrant places in the city. The main attraction of the square is the Clock Tower, built in 1910. This white tower, adorned with beautiful patterns, fits perfectly into the atmosphere of this seaside city. There is also a small mosque on the square, decorated with magnificent mosaics.\n\nThe large Kemeraltı Market begins next to the square. Here you can find everything: food and clothing, souvenirs and jewelry. The market has many cafes with delicious food, as well as carts with pastries. You can drink pomegranate juice or Turkish coffee, enjoy tasty seafood, or order a doner. I liked the Izmir market much more than markets in Istanbul. This market is the hub of local life, not just a place for tourists.\n\nThe Hisar Mosque is also located on the market’s premises, the largest mosque in Izmir, which was built in 1592 and is one of the oldest and most significant landmarks of the city.\n\nThe Agora of Smyrna is a well-preserved part of the ancient city of Smyrna, which is located in modern-day Izmir. It is an open-air museum, a former city square with ruins of buildings that once stood here.\n\nIn ancient times, the agora was a place where citizens gathered to discuss public matters. Temples and workshops were often situated around it, as well as key state institutions.\n\nThe entrance fee is 130 lira (about $4).\n\nThe entrance fee to the Izmir Archaeological Museum is 90 lira (about $2.80). Its collection features artifacts found both in Izmir and in its surroundings. For example, there are exhibits from Ephesus, Pergamon, Miletus, and other ancient cities. The exhibition is not very big, but I found the museum quite interesting.\n\nThe historical elevator in Izmir, also known as Asansör, was built in 1907 and connects two streets along a steep cliff in the old Jewish quarter of Karataş. The elevator was created to facilitate the residents’ climb up the hill, saving them from having to climb a long staircase. The height of the elevator tower is 58 meters. There is a magnificent view of the city from the top observation deck. The elevator ride is free, but there may be a small queue.\n\nIzmir has a long promenade. You can take a walk from the historical elevator to the Alsancak district. Along the way, you will find many cozy cafes and street food stands. Approaching Alsancak, you can also see the historic tram.\n\nThe Alsancak district is another attraction in Izmir. On its long pedestrian street, there is a vast array of shops, restaurants, and cafes.\n\nThe Kültürpark is a large green area in the center of Izmir. If you want to take a break from the noisy city, this is the place to come.\n\nEphesus\n\nThe Ephesus is an ancient city, its ruins are located not far from Izmir. Founded by the Greeks and later part of the Roman Empire, Ephesus was one of the largest cities of its time but was abandoned after a devastating earthquake.\n\nThe entrance fee of 40 euros seemed high for me in the beginning, but it was fully justified. It’s a well-preserved city where people once walked the streets going about their daily lives.\n\nDon’t miss the Ephesus Museum. There, the history of Ephesus is recreated on large screens, from its beginning to decline. This is accompanied by a narration in the language of your choice.\n\nToday, only cats and dogs live there.\n\nIf you want to get to Ephesus from Izmir on your own, take the train from Izmir Basmane station to Selçuk station (60 lira/about $2). From there, there is a minibus to Ephesus (30 lira/about $1).\n\nFoods to try in Izmir\n\nStuffed mussels (Midye Dolması) are one of the most popular dishes in the coastal city of Izmir. The mussels are mixed with fragrant rice and spices and placed back into the shells. I recommend squeezing lemon juice over the filling to make the flavor more zesty. At the market, you can get a large portion of mussels for a reasonable price.\n\nThe Izmir Bomb (İzmir bombası)is an incredibly delicious warm dessert made of thin dough filled with a chocolate-nut cream. Today, many flavors are available, and I particularly enjoyed the cherry bomb. Don’t miss the chance to try this treat in Izmir.\n\nWalking in Izmir, you will surely notice the bright Kumru sandwiches selling everywhere. The main ingredients are: a soft bun made with chickpea leavening, tomato, kaşar cheese, and fresh green pepper. Kumru is a delicious and hearty sandwich that is usually generously sprinkled with salt before serving.\n\nFollow my channel, and also read my text about Istanbul."
