        "text": "Paasch\n\nPaasch, Oliver (b. Oct. 21, 1971, Malmedy, Belgium), minister-president of the German-speaking community of Belgium (2014- ).\n\nPaasikivi\n\nPaasikivi, Juho Kusti, original name Johan August Hellst√©n (b. Nov. 27, 1870, Tampere, Finland - d. Dec. 14, 1956, Helsinki, Finland), prime minister (1918, 1944-46) and president (1946-56) of Finland. He was elected to the Finnish Eduskunta (parliament) in 1907 and became finance minister in 1908. He resigned from the government in 1909 in protest against illegal attempts at Russification. As the first prime minister after the war of independence in 1918, he favoured a pro-German policy and a monarchy for Finland. He headed the Finnish delegation at the peace talks with Soviet Russia in 1920. Appointed minister to Sweden in 1936, he was recalled in October 1939 to lead the delegation that unsuccessfully attempted to reach a peaceful settlement with the U.S.S.R. over that nation's territorial demands. During the Winter War of 1939-40 he did much to speed up the conclusion of peace; as chairman of the Finnish-Russian peace commission, he signed the treaty whereby Finland ceded to Russia about 10% of its territory in March 1940. The same month he was appointed minister to Moscow, but he resigned this post in May 1941 when it became clear that his government would side with Germany and \"continue\" the war. He was recalled to service to take part in abortive peace negotiations between Finland and the U.S.S.R. in the spring of 1944. In November 1944, the approaching Soviet victory was obvious to all, and the conciliatory Paasikivi was asked to serve as prime minister of a government pledged to peaceful cooperation with the Soviet Union. As president, he stood farther aloof from party politics than any of his predecessors. His policy was to remain uncompromising over Finnish independence and to resist Communist penetration in Finland, but otherwise to cultivate harmonious relations with the Soviet Union.\n\nPaasio, Pertti (Kullervo) (b. April 2, 1939, Helsinki, Finland - d. April 4, 2020), deputy prime minister asnd foreign minister of Finland (1989-91); son of Rafael Paasio.\n\nR. Paasio\n\nPaasio, (Kustaa) Rafael, original surname H√§llstr√∂m (b. June 6, 1903, Uskela, Finland - d. March 17, 1980, Turku, Finland), prime minister of Finland (1966-68, 1972). He was editor in chief (1942-66) of Turun P√§iv√§lehti, a Social Democratic newspaper, and a member of the municipal council of Turku from 1945. He was a member of parliament from 1948 to 1975 and from 1949 to 1966 was chairman of its Foreign Affairs Committee; he was speaker in 1966 and 1970-72. He succeeded V√§in√∂ Tanner as chairman (1963-75) of the Social Democratic Party, which under his leadership became Finland's largest party. As prime minister (heading a coalition government in 1966-68 and a Social Democratic minority government in 1972) he sought to stabilize the country's economy and to reassure the Soviet Union of Finland's reliability as a neighbour.\n\nPaavela, Paul (b.

May 27, 2007, Buenos Aires), foreign minister of Argentina (1955, 1970-72).

He also served as ambassador to Chile (1960-61) and to Switzerland (1976-77).\n\nPab√≥n N√∫√±ez, Lucio (b. Oct. 21, 1913, Convenci√≥n, Norte de Santander, Colombia - d.

A world-famous pianist, he was also a staunch patriot. In 1910, on the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald, he presented the city of Krak√≥w with a monument commemorating the victory of the Poles over the Teutonic Order. During World War I he donated the income from his public appearances to the aid of Polish war victims. He became a member of the Polish National Committee and was appointed its representative to the United States. In 1916-17 he urged Pres. Woodrow Wilson to support the cause of Polish independence, and Wilson included it as the thirteenth of his Fourteen Points of Jan. 8, 1918. After the war the provisional head of state, J√≥zef Pilsudski, asked Paderewski to form a government of experts; this was done on Jan. 17, 1919. Paderewski also took the portfolio of foreign affairs. He had difficulties with professional politicians, and his premiership was not a success. No political party supported him in his ambition to be elected president of the republic. On Nov. 27, 1919, he resigned as premier and returned to Switzerland, where he had settled in 1898. He never revisited Poland. At the beginning of World War II, in October 1939, a Polish government-in-exile was formed in Paris with Gen. Wladyslaw Sikorski as prime minister, and Paderewski accepted the chairmanship of the Polish National Council (exile parliament) in January 1940 but because of his physical condition went back to Switzerland. He later decided to go to the United States, where he arrived in November. He died soon after and, by order of Pres. Franklin D.

March 23, 2000, Cochin, India), Major Archbishop of Ernakulam-Angamaly of the Syro-Malabar rite (1992-96). The Syro-Malabar rite dates back to the Apostle Saint Thomas who brought the faith to India and Ceylon. Through the influence of the missionary priests in his village he entered the regional seminary of St. Peter in Bangalore and left the Syro-Malabar rite behind in favour of the Latin rite which he was ordained into on Dec. 19, 1945, in the diocese of Coimbatore. Ten years later Pope Pius XII made him the first bishop of the diocese of Ootacamund on July 3, 1955, and he was installed on Oct. 15, 1955. He remained there for fifteen years until June 14, 1970, when Pope Paul VI accepted his request to return to his roots of the Syro-Malabar rite and he was made Archbishop of Changanacherry, about 500 km due north of Bombay on the western side of the country. The official title was Metropolitan Archbishop. With his return to his original rite, he was able to better inform his flock as to the similarities and unity of the two rites, both in union with Rome. On April 23, 1985, Pope John Paul II named him the first archbishop of Ernakulam-Angamaly. Three years later he was elevated to the cardinalate in the consistory of June 28, 1988, receiving the titular church of St. Mary Queen of Peace in Monte Verde and given curial membership in the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. On Dec. 16, 1992, his archdiocese was made a Major Archbishopric in the Syro-Malabar Church and he was enthroned on May 20, 1993, as the first Major Archbishop. Because of age, he retired on Nov. 11, 1996.\n\nPadmanabhan\n\nPado\n\nPadmanabhan, Anandam (b. 1928), governor of Mizoram (1998-2000).\n\nPado, Martin (b.

May 6, 1873, New York City), president (1830-35, 1839-43) and supreme chief (1861-63) of Venezuela. In 1810 he joined the revolutionary movement against Spain as the leader of a band of llaneros (horsemen of the plains). Becoming chief Venezuelan commander to Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, the liberator of northern South America, he administered serious defeats to the Spanish at Carabobo (1821) and Puerto Cabello (1823) that resulted in their complete withdrawal. In 1826, after rebelling against the authority of Gran Colombia, of which Venezuela was a province, he was conciliated by Bol√≠var, who made him military and civil chief of Venezuela. This paved the way for the war of Venezuelan independence in which P√°ez was the prime mover. He became the new republic's first head of state in 1830 and remained in effective control until 1847. A conservative oligarch and exponent of personalism, he leveraged his prestige and military prowess to maintain internal peace while establishing the country's social and economic infrastructures. He curbed the power of the church in secular affairs but supported its religious authority. In 1848-49 he headed a rebellion against Pres. Jos√© Tadeo Monagas, but was defeated and imprisoned for several months. He was forced into exile in 1850, returning to Venezuela during another period of civil unrest in 1858. After becoming minister to the United States in 1860, he came to power again in 1861, but was severely repressive and was again driven into exile when the federalist party defeated the centralists led by P√°ez.\n\nPagador Blondet, Germ√°n (b. May 15, 1910, Chiclayo, Peru - d. 1992), interior minister of Peru (1962-63).\n\nPagan Min1 (b. June 21, 1811, Amarapura, Kingdom of Awa [now in Myanmar] - d. March 14, 1880, Ratnapura [Innwa], Kingdom of Awa), king of Awa (1846-53). He and his brothers confined their father, the insane king Tharawadi Min, in 1845. Killing his rival brothers, he became king when Tharawadi died in 1846. Although he was not one of Awa's more enlightened monarchs, he acted with tact and restraint during the crisis preceding the Second Anglo-Burmese War. In 1851 the governor of Pegu at Rangoon, Maung Ok, charged the captains of two British merchant ships with murder, embezzlement, and evading customs fees, forcing them to pay several hundred rupees before being allowed to return to Calcutta. On their complaints, Lord Dalhousie, the governor-general of India, sent an emissary, Commodore George Lambert, with a letter to the king requesting compensation that amounted to ¬£920 and the dismissal of Maung Ok. Pagan agreed to replace Maung Ok, but on Jan. 6, 1852, when the new governor declined to meet with a British delegation, Lambert evacuated all British subjects and blockaded the coast. Within days British warships were firing on Rangoon. On February 7, Pagan wrote Dalhousie to protest the acts of aggression. A few days earlier, the governor had offered to pay the compensation for the two ship captains. On February 13, however, Dalhousie sent an ultimatum to the king, demanding the equivalent of ¬£100,000 as compensation for the British war expenses, to be paid by April 1. Pagan did not answer the ultimatum, and a few days after its expiry British troops entered Burmese territory; in December Britain annexed the province of Pegu. On Feb. 18, 1853, Pagan was deposed by his brother Mindon Min, who favoured reconciliation with the British.\n\n1 Literally \"Prince of Pagan,\" a style conferred before accession; used colloquially instead of the very complex official name as king.\n\nPaganini\n\nPaganini (Herrera), Omar (Ignacio) (b. June 2, 1962, Montevideo, Uruguay), foreign minister of Uruguay (2023- ). He was also minister of industry, energy, and mining (2020-23).\n\nPaganon, Joseph (b.

Page\n\nPage, Sir Earle (Christmas Grafton) (b. Aug. 8, 1880, Grafton, N.S.W. - d. Dec. 20, 1961, Sydney, N.S.W.), Australian statesman. He was living in northern New South Wales at a time when a strong movement was developing there in favour of the establishment of a new state, free from the allegedly overbearing effect of Sydney urban interests. This agitation, which attracted him into politics, also gave great impetus to the growth of a primary producers' party. In 1919 he entered the federal parliament as one of the first representatives of what in 1920 became the Country Party (now the National Party), and as its leader from 1921 to 1939 he was a spokesman for its goal of rural economic development. The Country Party's influence forced the withdrawal of William Morris Hughes from the leadership of the Nationalist Party and the premiership in 1923. A Nationalist-Country coalition was then formed, in which Page led 5 Country Party members in a cabinet of 11. He had the portfolio of treasurer and was scarcely less influential than the prime minister, Stanley Melbourne Bruce. The Bruce-Page ministry, lasting until 1929, gave exclusive priority to the development of the national economy. Never again did Page or his party exercise so much influence as in the 1920s. He was minister of commerce (1934-39, 1940-41), was knighted in 1938, and served as prime minister for 19 days following the death of Joseph Lyons in 1939, but his deposition from the party leadership shortly afterward marked the deepening of a very long political twilight. As minister of health (1949-56), he introduced a comprehensive national health scheme in 1953. He remained in parliament until being defeated immediately before his death in 1961; he had represented Cowper, N.S.W., for 42 years.\n\nPage, John (b.

He went to America in 1774, where the conflict between the colonists and England was just reaching its height, and after blood was spilled at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, he argued that the cause of America should not just be a revolt against taxation but a demand for independence. He put this idea into Common Sense, a 50-page pamphlet which came out on Jan. 10, 1776, and sold more than 100,000 copies within three months. It impacted public opinion and the deliberations of the Continental Congress more than any other single publication, paving the way for the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. During the war of independence, Paine served as volunteer aide-de-camp to Gen. Nathanael Greene. He revived the flagging morale of the troops and the civilian population with his 16 Crisis papers. In 1777-79 he was secretary to the congressional committee of foreign affairs. After the war, he devoted his time to inventions, and in 1787 he left for Europe to promote his plan to build a single-arch bridge across the wide Schuylkill River near Philadelphia. But it was the French Revolution that soon filled his thoughts. He published Rights of Man (1791-92), which was banned in Britain. Paine himself was indicted for treason, but before he could be arrested, he went to France and was elected to a seat in the National Convention. When the radicals under Robespierre held power, Paine was imprisoned (1793-94). His last great treatises, The Age of Reason (1794-96), opposing organized religion, and Agrarian Justice (1797), attacking inequalities in property ownership, added to his many enemies in establishment circles. He returned to the U.S. in 1802.\n\nPainlev√©, Paul (Prudent) (b. Dec. 5, 1863, Paris, France - d. Oct. 29, 1933, Paris), prime minister of France (1917, 1925).

In December 1917, he overthrew the democratic regime and made himself president (confirmed by elections in April 1918). He exercised dictatorial powers that foreshadowed the Ant√≥nio Salazar regime, although he was more populist than Salazar. In July 1918 he resumed relations with the Holy See. From October he was faced with a revolutionary movement; for a time he gained control of the situation, but in December his \"New Republic\" ended after only a year with his assassination by Jos√© J√∫lio da Costa.\n\nPais, Tom (d.

Elected to the Vilnius city council in March 1997, he was shortly thereafter (April 10) elected mayor by his fellow councilmen. He was celebrated for his revitalization of the capital's historic old town, among the largest in Europe. He transformed the Rotushes (City Hall) building from a stuffy museum to an international conference and reception hall and relit and repainted much of the decaying capital. In 1999 he was appointed prime minister after Gediminas Vagnorius resigned. Paksas, a member of Vagnorius' Conservative Party, was a relative political novice and analysts doubted whether he had the power to pilot the government for the next 18 months until elections or the know-how to stabilize the economy. He had little influence in his party and no experience at high level politics, but he had the highest approval rating of any Conservative, making him an ideal compromise candidate and giving him the popular backing that Vagnorius lacked for many of his final months in office. Even Paksas himself had shown some reluctance to take the post. In October 1999 he stepped down after a 5¬Ω-month stint as prime minister, during which time he saw his ratings skyrocket to over 70%. He quit over the sale of the state-owned oil concern to U.S. energy group Williams, which he said forced too many obligations on the small Baltic state. He served again as prime minister in 2000-01, founded the Liberal Democratic Party in 2002, and was elected president in 2003. In 2004 the Constitutional Court ruled that he broke the constitution and his oath by granting his supporter Jurij Borisov citizenship, telling him he was under investigation by special services, and illegally influencing companies; the parliament then voted to remove him from office.\n\nPakun, Vasily (Romanovich), chairman of the Executive Committee of the Volga German Workers' Commune (1920-21).

On July 21 the new Seimas voted unanimously for a resolution requesting the U.S.S.R. to annex Lithuania. On August 3 the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. granted the request.

Feb. 11, 1964, Sandpoint, Idaho), governor of Alaska (2006-09). Her political career began in 1992, when she won a seat on the Wasilla city council. Beating a three-term incumbent, she became mayor (1996-2002) of Wasilla, a place of 6,000 people northeast of Anchorage. In December 2006 she arrived at the state capitol on an ethics reform platform after defeating incumbent Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary and former Democratic governor Tony Knowles in the general election. Her growing reputation as a maverick for bucking her party's establishment and Alaska's powerful oil industry gained her national attention. She distanced herself from the old guard, powerful Republicans in the state GOP, even calling on tight-lipped veteran U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens to explain to Alaskans why federal authorities were investigating him. She asked Alaska's congressional delegation to be more selective in seeking earmarks after what came to be known as the \"Bridge to Nowhere\" turned into a national symbol of pork-barrel spending. She stood up to the powerful oil industry and with bipartisan support in the statehouse won a tax increase on oil companies' profits. Her approval ratings in Alaska hovered in the 80% range. Still it came as a surprise when in August 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain, passing over many other better known prospects, picked her as his running mate. Her strong anti-abortion and pro-gun stance (she is a hunter and life member of the National Rifle Association) pleased the conservatives in the party, but her lack of experience in high-level politics (having served only 20 months as governor at the time of her nomination) tended to neutralize Republicans' possibilities of raising similar concerns about the Democratic candidate Barack Obama (a U.S. senator since January 2005). In the course of the campaign she was increasingly considered unqualified for the presidency and the selection might have contributed to McCain's ultimate defeat. She resigned as governor in July 2009. In 2022 she lost a special election, and then the regular election, for Alaska's seat in the U.S. House.\n\nPaliudju, Bandjela (b.

Feb. 28, 1986, Stockholm), prime minister of Sweden (1969-76, 1982-86). He joined the National Swedish Union of Students and became politically committed to the left. He strongly opposed the 1948 Communist coup in Czechoslovakia, and in 1949 he married (and later divorced, in accordance with their agreement) a Czech girl to help her emigrate. After joining the Social Democrats, he became Prime Minister Tage Erlander's personal secretary in 1953 and entered the Swedish parliament in 1958. He joined the government in 1963 as minister without portfolio, advancing to the post of minister of communications in 1965 and to the dual post of minister of education and ecclesiastical affairs in 1967. A critic of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, he achieved some notoriety when, in 1968, he marched in protest outside the U.S. embassy in Stockholm. He also condemned the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia that same year. When Erlander retired, Palme succeeded him as party secretary and as prime minister in 1969. His attacks on U.S. war policy in Vietnam and his acceptance of U.S. Army deserters who sought refuge in Sweden led to strained relations between the two countries. In the 1976 election the Social Democrats were defeated after 44 years in power. He served as president of the Nordic Council in 1979-80 and also played an important part in the Socialist International. In 1979 he led his party to a second defeat, but he won in 1982. Although he was criticized for domestic economic policies and for inadequate protests against Soviet submarine intrusion into Swedish waters, he was returned to power in the 1985 election. In 1986 he was gunned down while walking home from a cinema; the murder remained unsolved, although in 2020 Stig Engstr√∂m, who had claimed to be a witness of the murder (and committed suicide in 2000), was announced as the likely assassin.\n\nPalmeiro, Antonio Lara de Fontoura (b. March 3, 1858, Porto Alegre, Brazil - d. April 30, 1886, Porto Alegre), president of Santa Catarina (1885).\n\nPalmeira\n\nPalmeira, Guilherme Gracindo Soares (b. Dec. 25, 1938, Macei√≥, Alagoas, Brazil - d. May 4, 2020, Macei√≥), governor of Alagoas (1979-82).

Oct. 12, 1850, Lisbon, Portugal), prime minister of Portugal (1834-35, 1842, 1846). He was also minister to the United Kingdom (1816-20, 1825-27) and minister of foreign affairs (1820-21 [in Brazil], 1832-33, 1835, 1835, 1842), interior (1832, 1846, 1846), finance (1846), and justice (1846).

Palmer\n\nPalmer, Sir Geoffrey (Winston Russell) (b. April 21, 1942, Nelson, South Island, N.Z.), prime minister of New Zealand (1989-90). He declined an invitation to enter politics as a National Party candidate in Nelson in 1972, but was recruited for Labour by Wallace Edward Rowling, the party leader and a Nelson resident, in 1975 and was elected to parliament for Christchurch Central in a by-election in 1979. Appointment as personal assistant to Prime Minister Rowling was the foot of the escalator. With Labour out of power and Rowling defeated for the leadership by David Lange in 1983, Palmer narrowly was chosen deputy leader. In 1984, with Labour back in government, he became deputy prime minister, leader of the House of Representatives, and minister of justice and attorney general. As Lange's deputy, he provided a steady hand. It was needed, whether in fort-holding during Lange's forays to other countries or in providing solid backup for a leader whose forte was the bon mot and the footlights. It was Palmer who warned his colleagues against \"speed wobbles\" in Labour's frantic policies based on deregulation. After the reelection of Labour in 1987, he dropped the role as leader of the House and took up the portfolio of environment minister. In August 1989 Lange, suffering serious setbacks in party loyalties and public opinion, resigned and nominated Palmer as his successor; party leaders confirmed the choice. On becoming prime minister, Palmer dropped the legal portfolios. In September 1990, he resigned for reasons similar to Lange's a year before. Polls indicated that Labour would be routed in the October elections with him at its helm. He continued to serve as minister for the environment outside the cabinet until the election, then left politics. He was knighted in 1991.\n\nPalmer, John M(cAuley) (b. Sept. 13, 1817, Eagle Creek, Ky. - d. Sept. 19, 1900, Springfield, Ill.), governor of Illinois (1869-73).\n\nPalmer, Michael (Anthony) (b. July 14, 1968, Singapore), Singaporean politician.

Dec. 3, 1860, Danville, Vt.), governor of Vermont (1831-35).\n\nPalmerston\n\nPalmerston (of Palmerston, County Dublin), Henry John Temple, (3rd) Viscount, (3rd) Baron Temple of Mount Temple (b. Oct. 20, 1784, Broadlands, Hampshire, England - d. Oct. 18, 1865, Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, England), British secretary at war (1809-28), foreign secretary (1830-34, 1835-41, 1846-51), home secretary (1852-55), and prime minister (1855-58, 1859-65). In 1802 he succeeded as viscount, in the Irish peerage, thus not preventing him from entering the House of Commons, where he represented Newport, Isle of Wight (1807-11), Cambridge University (1811-31), Bletchingley (1831-32), Hampshire South (1832-34), and Tiverton (1835-65). His official connection with the Tory party ceased in 1828 and he entered the Foreign Office in Earl Grey's Whig government in 1830. With Britain and France acting in concert, he took a leading part in securing the independence of Belgium, establishing the thrones of Maria II of Portugal and Isabel II of Spain, and endeavouring, in alliance with both Austria and Turkey, to check Russian influence in the East. In 1841 the Whigs lost office, but under Lord John Russell he again became foreign secretary in 1846. The affair of the Spanish marriages, the revolutions in 1848, the rupture between Spain and Britain, the affair of Don Pacifico (a Gibraltar-born Jew living in Athens, who claimed the privileges of a British subject) and the consequent quarrel with Greece, combined with his self-assertive character, brusque speech, and interferences in foreign affairs, made him a controversial figure and he became known on the Continent as \"Firebrand Palmerston.\" A vote of censure on him was carried in the House of Lords (1850), but was defeated in the House of Commons. In 1851 his unauthorized approbation of the coup of Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte (Napol√©on III) forced his resignation. He shattered the Russell administration soon after on a militia bill, refused office under the Earl of Derby, but was home secretary in the Earl of Aberdeen's coalition, whose fall brought him the premiership (and leadership of the Liberals, as the Whigs now tended to call themselves). His vigorous prosecution of the Crimean War increased his popularity. Defeated in 1857 on Richard Cobden's motion condemning the Chinese war, he appealed to the country, and won a greatly increased majority, but fell in 1858 over the Conspiracy Bill. In 1859 he again became prime minister, remaining in office till his death.\n\nPalmfelt, Gustaf friherre (b. 1680, Stockholm, Sweden - d.

Oct. 29, 1947, Selfoss, Iceland), prime minister of Iceland (1987-88). He was editor of the conservative afternoon newspaper Visir in 1975-79 and managing director of the Employers' Federation in 1979-83. He was first elected to the Althing (parliament) in the 1983 general elections. He had barely entered the Althing when the leader of the Independence Party, former prime minister Geir Hallgr√≠msson, resigned from the leadership and threw the succession open to the party convention. P√°lsson won the contest by a wide margin, defeating two other contenders, and became party chairman on Nov. 8, 1983. In 1985 he became finance minister in the government of Steingr√≠mur Hermannsson, and he remained in that capacity until he became prime minister in July 1987. He also served briefly as minister of industry in 1987. At the age of 39 P√°lsson was the youngest prime minister in the history of the republic. He headed a coalition government in which the two outgoing coalition partners - the Independence Party and the Progressive Party - were joined by the Social Democratic Party. The new government was formed after protracted negotiations following the April 25 general elections, which had resulted in the worst parliamentary stalemate in the country's post-World War II history. He owed much of the success of his political career to the fact that he was a good orator and had proved to be a patient negotiator, with a reputation for reaching acceptable agreements in difficult circumstances. However, his government resigned in September 1988 after failing to agree on a program to deal with acute economic problems. In 1991 he lost the party leadership to Dav√≠d Oddsson, under whom he became minister of justice and fisheries (1991-99). Later he was ambassador to the United Kingdom (1999-2002) and Denmark (2002-05).\n\nPaltridge, Sir Shane (Dunne) (b. Jan. 11, 1910, Leederville, Perth, W.Aus. - d.

Feb. 3, 1938, Xunhua, Qinghai province, China - d. Jan. 28, 1989, Zhikatse, Tibet), Panchen Lama from 1943 to 1989. He was recognized as the successor of the 9th Panchen Lama (who died in 1937) by the Chinese government but without having gone through the usual exacting tests that determine rebirth. He was brought to Tibet in 1952 under Communist military escort and enthroned as head abbot of Tashilhunpo. The Panchen Lama remained in Tibet in 1959 after the popular revolt and the Dalai Lama's flight into exile, but his refusal to denounce the Dalai Lama as a traitor brought him into disfavour with the Chinese government, which imprisoned him in Beijing in 1964. He was rehabilitated in 1978 and maintained an uneasy alliance with Chinese government officials. As a vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (China's parliament), he was instrumental in helping Beijing deal with militant Tibetans protesting Chinese occupation of their homeland. Though the Panchen Lama denounced the anti-Chinese activities of separatist Tibetan monks, he also criticized the violent way in which Chinese authorities handled riots in Tibet during 1988. A week before his death from a heart attack, the Panchen Lama presided at the dedication of the new Great Stupa at the Tashilhunpo monastery, where the remains of five Panchen Lamas were reburied. Their remains had been dismembered and thrown away by Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, but local people had recovered them.

In the 1995 elections the UNC and the governing People's National Movement (PNM) won the same number of seats, and he formed a coalition with the NAR. In 2001 the PNM returned to power. He was arrested on corruption charges on May 31, 2005, and remained in jail for eight days, refusing to post bail until persuaded by religious leaders to do so on June 8. \"I did it because I thought I had to prove to myself, first of all, that I was capable of enduring any kind of pressure the PNM intends to inflict upon me,\" he told supporters. On April 24, 2006, he was sentenced to two years in prison for failing to disclose details of a bank account he had held in London in 1997-99. He then resigned as UNC chairman. On March 13, 2007, an appeals court overturned the ruling and ordered a retrial. On April 29 he was reelected party leader. However, in January 2010 he was defeated in a leadership contest by Kamla Persad-Bissessar.\n\nPanday, Devendra Raj (b.

During his term as Bihar governor, he shot into controversy when he invited the Samata Party leader Nitish Kumar to form a short-lived government in 2000. Pande was charged with acting under the pressure of the BJP-led central government. Controversy also dogged Pande when he was transferred to Arunachal Pradesh, where he was accused of honouring the demand of Chief Minister Gegong Apang by dissolving the Assembly.

Aug. 18, 1900, Allahabad [now Prayagraj], India - d. Dec. 1, 1990, Dehra Dun, India), Indian diplomat; sister of Jawaharlal Nehru. She became active in the Indian freedom movement and was imprisoned three times, the first in 1932. She gained experience in government as a member of the municipal board of Allahabad and in 1937-39 was minister for local self-government and public health of the United Provinces (later Uttar Pradesh) - the first Indian woman to hold a cabinet portfolio. She argued for Indian independence at the UN charter conference in San Francisco (1945), attracting attention away from the official British-sponsored delegation. As leader of the first Indian delegation to the UN (1946), she made an impassioned speech to the General Assembly on the treatment of the Indian population in South Africa that resulted in a two-thirds vote against South Africa. She led a number of succeeding delegations to the UN and was also - after India became independent (1947) - her country's ambassador to the U.S.S.R. (1947-49), the U.S. and Mexico (1949-51), Ireland (1955-61), Spain (1958-61), and high commissioner to the U.K. (1954-61).

Pandolfi\n\nPandolfi (Arbul√∫), Alberto (b. Aug. 20, 1940), prime minister of Peru (1996-98, 1998-99). The surprise resignation of Prime Minister Dante C√≥rdova in 1996 gave Pres. Alberto Fujimori the opportunity to give the cabinet a more homogeneous and technocratic look, with less resistance to free-market reforms and privatization. Within 36 hours of C√≥rdova's resignation, half of his cabinet had their formal offers to step down accepted. Those replaced generally shared the concerns of C√≥rdova on the social impact of the economic reform program. The appointment of Pandolfi to the premiership was unexpected but welcomed by businessmen and foreign analysts. Pandolfi had been involved in several privatizations and had presided over the process of selling off the state oil producer, Petroper√∫. International investor confidence was crucial as Peru was soon to launch an estimated U.S.$1.4 billion offering of state-owned shares in privatized Telef√≥nica del Per√∫. With disappointing production and inflation indicators for the start of the year, and large trade and current-account deficits, the Peruvian government was keen to present an image of unity. He was also minister of fisheries (1996), energy and mines (1996-97), and transport, communications, housing, and construction (1999-2000).\n\nPandolfi, Filippo Maria (b.

After the abdication of King Konstantinos in 1922 he was again placed on the active list and was appointed minister of war in December. He headed the military court that condemned to death those supposed to have been responsible for the rout of Greek forces at Afyon, Turkey, in August 1922 and the later massacre of Greeks in Smyrna (now Izmir). In 1923 he served as commander in chief in Thrace but then entered politics. In June 1925 he seized power by a coup. Installed as prime minister, his rule was erratic and irresponsible, and war with Bulgaria was only narrowly averted (October 1925). On Jan. 3, 1926, he assumed dictatorial powers to put an end to the rivalry of political parties. In April he procured his own election as president. He was deposed, however, on August 22, in a coup by his own Republican Guard. During his rule he made unsuccessful attempts to regulate public morality, including the length of women's skirts. He was imprisoned after his ouster, awaiting trial on charges of treason, but those were dismissed in July 1928 and he was released. In April 1930 he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for irregularities in connection with the building of a gambling casino, but his earlier time in prison was counted against it. He suffered further temporary arrests subsequently, being accused of subversive activities. At the end of World War II he was accused of having collaborated with the Germans and Italians, but the charges could not be substantiated.\n\nPangalos\n\nPangalos, Theodoros (Georgiou) (b.

In 1955 he defected to the West, arriving in the U.S. the following year, where he later founded the International Chemical & Nuclear (ICN) pharmaceuticals company. On July 2, 1992, after receiving permission from the U.S. government to travel to Yugoslavia, he left on what he called a \"peace mission\" to end the bloodshed in the Balkans. Chosen prime minister by Serb leaders wanting to establish better relations with the U.S., Panic was sworn in July 14 and immediately criticized Serb-backed attacks on Bosnia and Herzegovina. \"We respect the fact that Bosnia-Herzegovina is an independent state. The most important thing for all Serbs is to stop shooting.\" He also said that \"ethnic cleansing is the disgrace of our nation. People are thinking that we are barbarians. I am determined to bring order to Belgrade, Serbia, and Yugoslavia.\" Panic began to draw praise from critics who earlier had viewed him as a puppet of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. He formed a cabinet consisting of both pro- and anti-Milosevic elements and removed Serb extremists from positions of power in the Yugoslav government. \"We are removing the causes of cancer,\" he said. A citizens' group nominated the American millionaire to run for president of Serbia. Although an electoral commission barred Panic from challenging Milosevic, the Serbian Supreme Court overturned that decision. On December 20 Milosevic won a decisive reelection victory, and nine days later Panic lost a unanimous parliamentary vote of no confidence.
