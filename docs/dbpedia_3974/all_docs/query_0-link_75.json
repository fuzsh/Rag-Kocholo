Not long before the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, Neophytos Doukas, a priest and prominent figure in the 'Neo-Hellenic Enlightenment', the intellectual revival that preceded the outbreak of the struggle for independence, outlined his vision of the Greek East. This was contained in a pamphlet published in 1811 in which he urged the 'the Greeks in Vienna engaged in commerce' to establish a Greek school in the Habsburg capital. When he mentioned the 'sweet name' of the Hellenes, Doukas wrote, he did not have in mind 'the few inhabiting the lands of ancient Hellas' but rather those living in 'the whole area in which the modern tongue of the Greeks is spoken'. With characteristic nationalist hyperbole, he claimed as speakers of Greek almost all those inhabiting a vast region stretching from the Pruth river, on the border between Moldavia and Bessarabia, and the Nile. 2 This was demonstrably a very considerable exaggeration but nonetheless there were substantial Greek No better insight can be found into the resonances of the expression I kath'imas Anatoli than in the voluminous writings of Manouil Gedeon, Megas Khartophylax and Khronographos (Chief Archivist and Chronicler) of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. In the course of a very long life (he was born in Istanbul in 1851 and died in Athens in 1943) he wrote some seven hundred and fifty books and articles containing a wealth of information about the Greek East. Among his principal publications were Khronika tou Patriarkhikou Oikou kai tou Naou (Istanbul 1884); Patriarkhikai Pinakes: Eidiseis Istorikai Viographikai peri ton Patriarkhon Konstantinoupoleos apo Andreou tou Protoklitou mekhri Ioakheim III tou apo Thessalonikis, 36-1884 (Istanbul 1885-1890); Aposimeiomata Khronographou, 1800-1913 ( Athens 1932); Mneia ton pro Emou 1800-1863-1913 (Athens 1934); Patriarkhikai Ephimerides: Eidiseis ek tis imeteras Ekklisiastikis Istorias 1500-1912 (Athens 1936-1938) and Istoria ton tou Khristou Peniton, 14531913 (Athens 1939). For a complete listing of Gedeon's works, see the invaluable bibliography of Kh.G. Patrinelis, Dimosievmata Manouil Gedeon: analytiki anagraphi (Athens 1974). A useful index to four of Gedeon's most important works, the Aposimeiomata Khronographou, the Mneia ton pro Emou; the Patriarkhikai Ephimerides and the Istoria ton tou Khristou Peniton, has been compiled by Dimitra Pikramenou-Varphi and Khrysothemis Stamatopoulou-Vasilakou (Athens 1979). A number of his articles have been reprinted by Alkis Angelou and Philippos Iliiou in Manouil Gedeon: I pnevmatiki Kinisis tou Genous kata ton 18 kai 19 aiona (Athens 1976). Another insight into the world of I kath'imas Anatoli is afforded by the recently published memoir of Georgios L. Zariphis, the grandson of the Ottoman Greek banker Georgios I. Zariphis, Oi Anamniseis mou: enas Kosmos pou ephyge. Konstantinoupoli 1800-1920 (Athens 2002). Although first published in 2002, the memoir was written in the late 1930s. 2 Neophytos Doukas, Parainesis B'.

The Exchange of Populations between Greece and Turkey negotiated in 1923 as part of the Lausanne settlement led to the uprooting of the largest element in the Greek East, namely the substantial Greek populations of Asia Minor, and their settlement in Greece. Thereafter only scattered remnants of / kath 'imas Anatoli remained outwith the borders of the Greek state, principally the Greek populations of Cyprus, of Istanbul and Imvros (Gcikceada) and Tenedos (Bozcaada), of southern Albania (or Northern Epirus as the region is known in Greece) and of the northern littoral of the Black Sea. Most of the papers gathered together in this volume treat of aspects of the history of I kath'imas Anatoli. All relate to the experience of the Greek people under Ottoman rule whether before the outbreak of the War of Independence in 1821 which led to the establishment of an independent Greek state in 1832, or after. For the new state contained as few as a third of the Greek inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire as they had been at the outset of hostilities and large Greek populations remained under Ottoman rule until the end of the First World War. 'The Greeks and their Past' looks at the emergence in the last decades of the 18th century and the first of the nineteenth of a 'sense of the past', of a growing, and at times almost obsessional, conviction on the part of the nascent Greek intelligentsia that the Greeks were heirs to an heritage, that of ancient Greece, that was the subject of reverent admiration and study in Europe, and, indeed, in the newly established United States. It looks at the way in which this reverence for antiquity played a critical role not only in shaping the mentality of the small Greek intelligentsia but also in determining the cultural milieu of the new state. It was no coincidence that the leading figure in the 'Neo-Hellenic Enlightenment', Adamantios Korais, who did more than anyone to inculcate in his fellow countrymen, or at least into fellow members of the nationalist intelligentsia, a sense that the Greeks were, in the words of Alexander Pushkin, 'the legal heirs of Homer and Themistocles' 1 , was among the foremost classical scholars in the Europe of his day. Indeed, his French patron, D'Ansse de Villoison, considered him to be 'the first critic in Europe'. 1 Dimitris Farsolas, 'Alexander Pushkin: his Attitude towards the Greek Revolution 1821-1829', Balkan Studies, XXXII (1971) 74-5.\n\nP R E F A C E\n\n9\n\nKorais was born in Izmir in 1748 into a prominent Greek family of Chiot origin. At an early stage he came under the influence of Bernhard Keun, the chaplain to the Dutch mercantile community in Izmir. It was Keun who, by teaching the young Korais Latin in return for lessons in Greek, introduced the budding scholar to the riches of European classical scholarship. After a few, not altogether happy, years as a merchant in Amsterdam, a period during which he cast off the neo-Byzantine mores of his Izmir upbringing and acquired the mentality of a European bourgeois, Korais abandoned commerce for scholarship. Although he studied medicine at the University of Montpellier, Korais never practiced as a doctor. Instead he devoted his life to classical scholarship and to endeavouring to make his fellow countrymen aware at a more popular level of the heritage of ancient Greece. One of his most remarkable publications was the Mémoire sur l'État present de la Civilisation dans la Grèce published in 1803 in Paris by the Société des Observateurs de l'Homme. This affords a penetrating analysis of the nature of Greek society during the critical years at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Not surprisingly, Korais' text has been commented on with much interest by students of nationalism such as Elie Kedourie and Benedict Anderson.1 Korais's very considerable stature in that true Republic of Letters, the world of European classical scholarship in the eighteenth century, is demonstrated in 'The Correspondence of Adhamantios Korais with Thomas Burgess 1789-1792'. This article centres on an attempt to find an academic position for Korais in Oxford just before the outbreak of the French Revolution. It was never likely that the introverted, torpid and port-sodden institution that was Oxford in the eighteenth century, so well described by Edward Gibbon in his autobiography, would welcome a Greek scholar, however brilliant, into its closed ranks. Rather than moving to Oxford, Korais from 1788 until his death in 1733 lived in Paris. Although he was no Jacobin he could not but be influenced by the turbulent years of the French Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary Wars. The way in which the study of the ancient world, often mediated through foreign sources, came to have such a dominant influence on Greek literati and came to assume overtly political dimensions is further discussed in 'The Classics and the Movement for Independence'.\n\nThe Mémoire has been translated by Elie Kedourie in Nationalism in Asia and Africa (London 1970) 153-87. Benedict Anderson has described the Mémoire as 'a stunningly modern analysis of the sociological bases for Greek nationalism', Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (London 1990) 70.\n\n10\n\nI KATH'IMAS\n\nANATOLI\n\nMuch of the intellectual ferment that characterised the Greek world in the decades before 1821 was centred on academies situated relatively close to each other on the West coast of Asia Minor. These were in Izmir the Evangeliki Skholi, founded in 1733 and under British protection, and the more progressive Philologikon Gymnasion established in 1808; on the island of Chios the Akadimia; and in Ayvalik the Ellinomouseion.1 'Two Accounts of the Academy of Ayvalik (Kydonies) in 1818-1819' and 'Two American Philhellenes at the Academy of Chios in 1820' provide detailed descriptions of two of the most advanced educational institutions in the Greek world during the pre-independence period when both were at the peak of their influence. Adamantios Korais had been greatly encouraged when he heard of the arrival of two Americans in 1820 at the Academy on the island with which he so closely identified, Chios. Had he been aware that the two were Protestant missionaries then he might have been considerably less enthusiastic. For Korais, like many of his compatriots, was fearful of the effects of proselytism among the Orthodox, whether by Protestant or by Catholic missionaries. Indeed, he once castigated the mania for proselytism of the Catholics as 'a mania so violent that the enemies of Jesus the Jesuits considered in the past, and consider even today, the return of a Greek to their Church to be a much more praiseworthy undertaking than to catechise ten Turks or ten idolaters'. 2 The Protestant missionaries, mainly British and American, who began to be active in the Levant in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars were of course precluded from proselytising among the Muslim populations of the Empire. For this reason the main focus of their activities was on the Orthodox and Armenian communities. Their reports and other writings constitute a valuable, and still underutilised, source for the history of the non-Muslim populations of the Empire as 'The Foundation of the Smyrna Bible Society (1818)' and 'Quakers and the Movement for Greek Independence' indicate. In the decades before the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821 a frequent complaint of the Greek intelligentsia and even more of the mercantile bourgeoisie whose emergence in the course of the 18th century was such a significant factor in the development of the Greek national movement was that disorder, rapacity and the arbitrary application of the law in the Ottoman Empire militated against the accumulation of capital and the promotion of commerce. As in the well-known instance of Ioannis Pringos (71725-1789), a Greek from Thessaly who had made a fortune as a merchant in * Alkis Angelou, 'Pros tin Akmi tou Neoellinikou Diaphotismou: oi Dienexeis tou Lesviou sti Skholi Kydonion', Mikrasiatika Khronika, VII (1957) 49. Richard Clogg, 'O Parsons kai o Fisk sti Khio to 1820', O Eranistis, V (1967) 192.\n\n2\n\nPREFACE\n\n11\n\nthe Netherlands, they contrasted the framework of order and the rule of law that prevailed in the Low Countries and which facilitated the orderly conduct of commerce with the arbitrariness and corruption that characterised the administration of the Ottoman state. 1 Daniil Philippidis and Grigorios Konstandas in their Geographia Neoteriki published in Vienna in 1791 gave as the reason for the presence of a large number of Greeks within the territories of the Habsburg Monarchy ('where the rights of life and property are sovereign') the capriciousness and disorder that characterised Ottoman rule. 'What degree of trade', they asked, 'can you expect from a place where the sea teems with pirates, and the dry land is full of thieves and vagabonds ... the roads are almost all uncertain and dangerous...'. Greeks and other subject peoples of the Ottoman Empire skilled in trade, they wrote, 'suffer a myriad vexations ... and it is by no means rare to witness a wretched Turk ill treat a useful merchant ... So therefore many well to do merchants, who have experience of other states and are resolved to live by commerce, uproot themselves and go and settle in these states, and a great damage ensues for the country...' 2 Another hazard to the orderly conduct of commerce were fires. A Corfiote Greek, Markos Katsaitis, who had visited Izmir in 1742, in commenting on the destructive fires that from time to time swept the city emphasised the way in which they added to the uncertainties of life in the Ottoman realms. He observed that an inhabitant of the city might, as a consequence of fire, be in 'the evening rich and powerful, and in the morning poor and a beggar {la sera ricco, et potente, e la mattina ...povero, e mendico) 3 Besides fires, a further hazard was the urban riot of the kind that erupted with sudden ferocity in Izmir in March of 1797. This was what is known in the Greek sources as the Smyrna 'rebellion'. In a near contemporary report of 17 April 1797 in the journal Ephimeris published in Vienna in Greek by the brothers Markides-Poulios this was described as so devastating that an entire century would not suffice to restore the city to its former condition. This may have been an exaggeration but the damage was certainly See my 'The Greek Mercantile Bourgoisie: \"progressive\" or \"reactionary\"?' in Richard Clogg, ed., Balkan Society in the Age of Greek Independence (London 1981) 85-110.

As many as 1500 Christians, mostly Greeks, lost their lives in the riot and immense damage was occasioned to the property of the Frankish merchant community in the city. An initially trivial inter-communal incident arising out of the visit of Italian rope-dancers under the protection of the Habsburg consul rapidly escalated into a violent and destructive riot. No doubt because of the losses suffered by British, and British protected, merchants, the British consul in Izmir, Francis Werry, who held the office in the city between 1794 and 1825, besides giving a highly detailed account of the 'horrors of that dreadful day', kept a detailed record of the losses suffered by British subjects and those with British protection. While Consul Werry's superior, J. Spencer Smith, the British Minister in Constantinople (like Werry an employee of the Levant Company) accepted that the 'rebellion' had been accelerated by 'the provocation of the Venetian vagabonds' (in fact the murder of the janissary, the catalyst for the riot, had been committed by a Cephaloniot under Venetian protection) he believed that there had been a sinister political dimension to the riot. He contended that the disorders should be seen as 'a contagious consequence of the destructive doctrines so progressive in the present day; and so industriously calculated both by precept and example during the long stay of the French squadrons in the Levant this year, particularly at Smyrna'. He believed it to be 'a singularity offering awful abundance of reflection that the French tricolour cockade served as an inviolable safeguard during the whole tragedy...' In fact there is no evidence that would justify his fears. The documents contained in 'The Smyrna \"Rebellion\" of 1797: Some Documents from the British Archives' probably afford the most detailed extant record of 'the dreadful catastrophe of the 15 March 1797'. In his 'dismal sketch' of the events in Izmir, Consul Werry lamented the loss of the 'British factory; with the exception of only one house of trade and two private dwellings'. The 'Consularian House' was among the buildings destroyed. The Library of the Consulate had apparently been well stocked with the 'ancient Greek and Latin authors' and some of the texts of the Fathers of the Church. All had been destroyed in the 'rebellion' save a Polyglott Bible, probably that compiled between 1655-7, by Brian Walton, Bishop of Chester. In 1805, the Revd. John F. Usko, the chaplain to the Levant Company's Factory in Smyrna and previously chaplain to the German Lutheran community in the city, wrote to the 'Right Honourable the Governor and the Right Worshipful the Company of Merchants trading to the Levant Seas' requesting that 'books on Divinity, Morality, Sermons, History,\n\nP R E F A C E\n\n13\n\nTravels, Geography, Natural History and Poetry etc.' be sent out to a countiy 'where the resources for society and instruction are so much limited' although it was 'once the seat of sciences'. He appended a lengthy list of desiderata for the newly established consulate library. This is given in 'The Library of the Levant Company's Factory in Smyrna (1805)'. There was clearly something of a tradition in maintaining well-stocked scholarly libraries in the consular milieu in Izmir. For, in the autobiography which he wrote towards the end of his life, Adamantios Korais recalled with gratitude that his Dutch mentor in Izmir, Bernhard Keun, the chaplain to the Dutch Consulate, had allowed him as a young man the run of his library, which was apparently extensive.1 A perceptive British traveller, Henry Holland, who visited the Greek lands at the beginning of the second decade of the 19 th century, noted that 'deprived in great measure of political and national objectives', the 'active spirit' of the Greeks had taken 'a general direction towards commerce'. 'By far the greater part of the exterior trade of Turkey, in the exchange of commodities', he added with a degree of exaggeration, 'is carried on by Greek houses...' 2 The emergence of a Greek, or Hellenised Vlach, mercantile bourgeoisie during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries is one of the themes discussed in 'Aspects of the Movement for Greek Independence'. Also considered are the political consequences of the emergence of this economically powerful group of merchants with experience of trade in European markets and the way in which they provided the crucial economic underpinning of the 'Neo-Hellenic Enlightenment', the intellectual revival that was a key feature of the developing movement for independence. The benefactions of wealthy merchants enabled the foundation of schools and colleges in the Greek world, the establishment of which met with no obstacle on the part of the Ottoman authorities. They subsidised the studies of Greek students in the universities of Europe where they became aware of the fascination which the civilization of ancient Greece held for the literati of the European Enlightenment and in many cases were inspired with a consuming zeal to share this knowledge with their compatriots in the Greek world. Merchants frequently paid for the publication of the growing number of books written in Greek for a Greek audience in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, books whose secular content became ever more marked in the years before 1821. They thus contributed significantly to what Francis Werry, the consul of the Levant Company in Izmir, dismissively termed 'the infatuation of Grecian liberty.'\n\n1 'The Autobiography of Adamantios Korais' in Richard Clogg, ed. and trans., The Movement for Greek Independence 1770-1821 (London 1976) 123.

Some indication of the impact of the news of the outbreak of the war on the Greek population of Izmir is given in 'Smyrna in 1821: Documents from the Levant Company Archives'. Inter alia, these provide striking and rare evidence of Greeks ' relying on the accomplishment of the prophecies of their priests' and acting on the millenarian beliefs foretelling their liberation from Ottoman rule through divine liberation that constituted such a significant dimension of Greek popular culture. 1 Consul Werry, still in office almost twenty five years after the 'rebellion' of March 1797, 2 reported in a despatch of 2 June 1821, not long after the outbreak of hostilities, that 'this day, the festival of the Greek St. Constantine, the founder of Constantinople, has cost the lives of 16 Greeks shot in the Bazar, so very fanatic are these deluded people. They yesterday openly congratulated each other (the lower orders) on the approach of the morrow, as the day appointed by heaven to liberate them from the Ottoman yoke and to restore their Race of Princes to the throne and possession of Constantinople.' One of the most interesting reflections of the growing interest in classical antiquity that was such a characteristic feature of the 'Neo-Hellenic Enlightenment' was the publication in Istanbul (Islambolda) in 1819 of a trilingual edition of the Physiognomonika (wrongly) attributed to Aristotle. This was printed in ancient Greek, in modern Greek and in Turkish (in Greek characters) by Anastasios Karakioulaphis of Kayseri as a small gift to the 'heteroglot sons' of his 'most beloved Motherland, Greece.' The Turkish title reads Aristotelesin insan saraflamasi Yunaniden haliyaki Yunaniye ve dahi lisani Türkiye terciime olup. One of the outcomes of this emerging 'sense of the past' was the practice that emerged during the first decade of the 19 th century of adopting or giving to children on baptism the names of the worthies of ancient Greece, a practice that was vehemently denounced by the hierarchy of the Orthodox Church which equated antiquity with paganism. One of the two copies of the Pseudo-Aristotle Physiognomonika which are preserved in the Taylorian Library in Oxford and which were formerly in the possession of Professor R.M. Dawkins has an inscription that it had once belonged to Demosthenes Haci P. Kemaloglu Ala§ehirli.\n\nThese millenarian beliefs are discussed in my 'The Byzantine Legacy in the Modern Greek World: the Megali Idea' in Lowell Clucas, ed., The Byzantine Legacy in Eastern Europe (Boulder, Colo., 1992) 253ff.

In 1825, after 224 years of existence, the Levant Company surrendered its charters and privileges.\n\nPREFACE\n\n15\n\nIn the eighteenth, nineteenth and early twentieth centuries an entire literature was published in Turkish printed with Greek characters, known in Turkish as karamanlica and in Greek as karamanlidika for the karamanlilar (Greek karamanlides), the Turkish-speaking Greeks of Asia Minor. 1 Many of these books are now extremely rare and survive in a few copies only. Some have disappeared entirely. Some of those that survive in British Libraries are listed in 'Notes on some Karamanli Books printed before 1850 now in British Libraries, with particular reference to the Bible Translations of the British and Foreign Bible Society'. A considerable number of these are to be found in the British Library, having originally formed part of the extraordinarily rich library put together by Frederic North, the Fifth Earl of Guilford, for the Ionian Academy which he founded on the island of Corfu and which has been described as Greece's first university. 2 Others found their way to the library of the British and Foreign Bible Society. Over the years the Bible Society, which had been founded in 1804, was probably the most prolific single publisher of karamanlica/ karamanlidika texts. The Bible Society's role in publishing and distributing such texts is considered in 'The Publication and Distribution of Karamanli Texts by the British and Foreign Bible Society'. A more general account of the karamanlilar/karamanlides is contained in 'A Millet within a Millet: the Karamanlides.' Grave inscriptions were frequently in karamanlica/ karamanlidika. The largest surviving group of these is to be found in the courtyard of the Church of the Zoodokhos Pigi at Balikli near the Silivrikapi on the land walls of Istanbul. 3 A solitary inscription in karamanlica/ karamanlidika is recorded in the monastic republic of Mount Athos. This is published in 'A Karamanlidika Inscription from Mount Athos (1818).' ^The known corpus of publications in karamanhca/karamanlidika is recorded in Sévérien Salaville and Eugène Dalleggio, Karamanlidika: Bibliographie Analytique d'Ouvrages en Langue Turque imprimés en Caractères Grecs 1 1584-1850 (Athens 1958); II 1851-1865 (Athens 1966); III (1866-1900) (Athens 1974); and Evangelia Balta, Karamanlidika XXe Siècle: Bibliographie Analytique (Athens 1987); Karamanlidika Additions (1584-1900): Bibliographie Analytique (Athens 1987); Karamanlidika: Nouvelles Additions et Compléments I (Athens 1997).

Most of these contain the bookplate of Frederic North.

In a memorandum, entitled 'Report on the Turkish Orthodox Church' and submitted to the Foreign Office in May 1922, Arnold Toynbee, the scholar and sometime correspondent in Asia Minor of the Manchester Guardian, Arthur Boutwood and H. Pirie Gordon, a correspondent of the (London) Times, estimated the number of Turcophones as half a million. 1 This figure is surely far too high. On the other hand the figure of 50,000 put forward by Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, in the negotiations with Eleftherios Venizelos and Ismet (Inonii) which preceded the signing of the convention on an exchange of populations between Turkey and Greece which formed part of the Lausanne peace settlement of 1923 is certainly too low. The 1928 census, for instance, the first to be held in Greece following the exchange of populations, recorded the number of Turkish-speaking Greeks of Anatolian origin as 103,642.2 One of the last, if not actually the last, publications in karamanlica/ karamanlidika was the Aziz Alexiosun ve cttmle Azizlerin ve Mah§er Divaninin Nakliyatlari ve Cana faydali Nasihatlar Iakov on iki Evlatlari ile (St Alexios and all the Saints and the Last Judgement. Traditions and advices useful to the Soul. Jacob and his Twelve Sons). It was printed in Thessaloniki in 1929, for books in Turkish in Greek characters were printed in Greece for some years after the 1923 Exchange of Populations for the benefit of the large numbers of monoglot Turkish-speakers who had been included in the transfer. Thus came to an end a chapter in the centuries long symbiosis of Greek and Turk in the Ottoman Empire.\n\n1 Cited in Alexis Alexandris, 'I apopeira dimiourgias Tourkorthodoxis Ekklisias stin Kappadokia, 1921-1923', Deltio Kentrou Mikrasiatikon Spoudon, IV (1983) 167. ^See Manolis Triandaphyllidis, Neoelliniki Grammatiki, I Istoriki Eisagogi (Athens 1938) 557.\n\nTHE GREEKS AND THEIR PAST*\n\nHistory is not only a science. It is at once the Gospel of the present and the future of the Motherland (Konstantinos Paparrigopoulos) There is, I am sure, no need to remind an audience of historians of central and south-eastern Europe attending a conference held in honour of one of our foremost students of nationalism, Hugh Seton-Watson, of the extent to which a sense of the past, an awareness of past glories, real or imagined, is, with language, the fundamental element in the national consciousness of all the peoples of south-eastern Europe. In all these countries the historical past is not, as has been remarked, 'a subject for harmless small talk'. 1 Rather its reconstruction and projection is vital to the establishment of title to territories presently occupied and perhaps covetously eyed by neighbours. In all the countries of the Balkans the remembrance of past wrongs, real or imagined, at the hands of alien overlords casts a heavy shadow over the present — as do the old grievances, which again may or may not correspond to reality, against the machinations of foreign powers. In few areas of the world is the burden of the past so intensely felt or the collective historical consciousness of such acute contemporary political significance. And in no country in the Balkans does the incubus of the past weigh so heavily as in Greece. So far as is possible within the compass of this short paper I wish to trace the development of an awareness by the Greeks in modern times that they were the heirs to a cultural heritage that was universally admired throughout the civilised world, and to look at the way in which, during the course of the nineteenth century, they began to rediscover their Byzantine heritage as well. It was this awareness that enabled the Greeks to link their ancient and medieval past in a theory of unbroken continuity from ancient times until the present, thereby establishing the parameters within which modern Greek historical writing has since functioned. The process by which the Greeks rediscovered their past has, I believe, a particular claim to the *TMs paper has also been published in M. Hurst (ed.), States, Countries, Provinces (Routne End, Bucks., 1986) pp. 35-51. R.

For the Greeks were, of course, the first of the Balkan peoples to articulate a recognisably modern nationalist movement, in the process establishing a model followed to a greater or lesser degree by the other Balkan peoples. Moreover the Greeks enjoyed the dubious advantage that their ancient language and culture formed the basis of the education of the ruling classes throughout the civilised world, whereas in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries virtually nothing was known outside the Balkans of the historical antecedents of the other Balkan peoples. Indeed, the Greeks' rediscovery of their past glories during the critical decades before the outbreak of the war of independence in 1821 was profoundly influenced by, and in large part mediated through, western interest in Greece's ancient heritage. The first decades of the nineteenth century saw the genesis of the progonoplexia, or ancestor obsession, and of the arkhaiolatreia, the worship of antiquity, that have exercised so baleful an influence over the cultural, educational and, to a degree, the political life of Greece up to the present day. The recent descent on London of the Greek minister of culture, Melina Mercouri, to demand the return of the Elgin marbles is but the most recent manifestation of the tendency to hearken back to ancient glories rather than face up to modern realities that has characterised so much of the rhetoric of public life in Greece during the 150 years or so since the emergence of an independent Greek state. To many it must have appeared that Mme. Mercouri, in seeking the return of 'her' marbles, was going over the top. But, in a sense, who can blame her, if Sir Ian Gilmour — then minister of state at the Foreign Office — in moving in the House of Commons in 1980 the ratification of Greece's treaty of accession as the tenth member of the European Community, could declare that Greece's entry would be seen as a 'fitting repayment by the Europe of today of the cultural and political debt that we all owe to a Greek heritage almost 3000 years old'? If Sir Ian's rhetoric is overblown it none the less has a certain elegance. The same cannot be said of that of Neil Kinnock, the leader of the Labour Party. In promising the return of the Elgin marbles to Greece he has declared that they are as Greek as Wembley Stadium is English and that the Parthenon without the marbles is like a smile with a tooth missing.\n\nTHE\n\nGREEKS\n\nAND\n\nTHEIR\n\nPAST\n\n19\n\nWhile on the subject of the political uses of historical rhetoric I cannot resist quoting from a recent speech by the Greek prime minister, Andreas Papandreou: 'it was not the imperial purple and the sharp swords of its Emperors that preserved the Byzantine Empire during the thousand years of its existence but rather the simple working man with his love and concern for the Byzantine state, and thus they brought into being the first elements of a political system that today is called socialism'. 1\n\nI might add here that, perhaps for the first time ever, the teaching of history figured in an election manifesto when Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) undertook in 1980 to ensure that henceforth 'historical knowledge will be imparted without taboos and without the imposition of a dominant ideology'. 2 How then did this obsession with the past take root among the modern Greeks? There had been, of course, regular revivals of interest in Greece's classical past during the long history of the Byzantine Empire, none more poignant than that associated with George Gemistos Plethon at Mistra during the very last years of the Empire. But in the early centuries after the Ottoman conquest there appears to have been little consciousness that the Greeks were the heirs to the cultural tradition of antiquity, even if a degree of knowledge of the classical past seems to have survived among the handful of scholars, mainly churchmen, who sought to sustain a sense of Greek identity. In the mid-seventeenth century, Kyrillos Loukaris, the so-called 'Protestant' patriarch, bemoaned the fact that 'in olden times, when wisdom ruled in Greece, the Hellenes took the Latins for barbarians. And now is it not strange that we have become barbarian and that they have become wise?' 3 Moreover, even at the popular level, some degree of consciousness of a glorious past seems to have existed, fuelled by the great popularity of tales of the exploits of Alexander the Great, and this was reflected in the superstitious reverence in which some of the physical remains of Greek antiquity were held. The\n\n1\n\nEpikentra, July-August 1982. Diakiryxi Kyvernitikis Politikis. Symvolaio me to Lao (Athens, 1981) p. 52. At the same time PASOK undertook to ensure that the emphasis on patriotism and national independence in education would be accompanied by the cultivation of faith in peace and in friendship between peoples. The 1975 Constitution (16.2) explicitly states that one of the objectives of the. educational system is the development of national consciousness. 3 A. Papadopoulos-Keramefs, Ierosolymitiki Vivliothiki (St Petersburg, 1894) vol. II, p. 514, quoted in K. Th. Dimaras, O Ellinikos Diaphotismos (Athens, 1964) p. 14.\n\n20\n\nI KATH'IMAS\n\nANATOLI\n\npeasants of Eleusis, for instance, looked on the famous statue of Demeter as ensuring the fertility of their crops. 1 But it was only towards the end of the eighteenth century that there emerged that fixation with Greece's ancient glories that was to prove such a key element in the development of the Greek national movement, and which, in part, explains its precocity in relation to the national movements of the other Balkan peoples. By the eve of the war of independence in the 1820s members of the small but vociferous intelligentsia came to make highly extravagant claims as to the imminent regeneration of Greece. Nikolaos Skouphas, for instance, looked forward to the imminent 'rebirth of new Platos and new Demosthenes', 2 while in 1820 Benjamin of Lesvos was to declare that 'nature has set limits to the desires of other men, but not to those of the Greeks. The Greeks have not been subject in the past nor are they now subject to the laws of nature.' 3 This renewed 'sense of the past' manifested itself in a number of ways in the last decades of the eighteenth and the first decades of the nineteenth centuries. There was, for instance, an impressive increase in the publication of books on the history, language and civilisation of the ancient world for a specifically Greek audience. A key role in the attempt to revive an interest in the classical past through publications of this kind was played by that 'new Hippocrates', Adamantios Korais, after whom the Koraes Chair at King's College, London, is named and the 150th anniversary of whose birth we are commemorating this year (1983). Born in Smyrna in 1748 Korais, after a not altogether happy period as a merchant in Amsterdam, studied medicine at Montpellier and, in 1788, settled in Paris (after an unsuccessful attempt had been made to find some post for him in Oxford). From 1788 until 1833 he eked out a living in Paris by collating texts and translating. In the process he acquired a reputation as one of the foremost Hellenists of his day, admired even by the great Richard Porson, who had nothing but contempt for most of his contemporaries.\n\n1\n\nR .

The principal instrument of this ambitious programme was to be his Hellenic Library (Elliniki Vivliothiki), a scheme to publish, with the financial support of a wealthy merchant family from Jannina, a series of editions of the classics, specifically designed for a Greek readership, ranging from Homer to those 'writing at the time of the Ptolemies'. Over the first three decades of the nineteenth century a whole series of editions of classical texts was published with a particular emphasis on those with a political, historical or moralistic content. These editions were distributed free of charge to students and were prefaced by 'impromptu reflections' in which Korais expatiated on various issues of the day and sought to analyse the reasons for the continued enslavement of the Greek nation. He was particularly critical of what he regarded as the monkish ignorance and obscurantism of the Orthodox clergy, whom he bitterly attacked for their indifference to the heritage of classical antiquity. The sale of the Patmos codex of Plato's Dialogues to E. D. Clarke by the monks of the monastery of St John the Divine was particularly upsetting to him. His essential message was that once his compatriots had developed an awareness of their own ancestral virtues and had sufficiently raised their educational level, then somehow, in a fashion about which he was never very specific, the Greeks would be vouchsafed that freedom and independence that was rightfully theirs. In fact, when the war of independence broke out in 1821 he considered it to be premature by a generation. But this only increased his zeal to publish texts, among them Aristotle's Politics and Plutarch's Parallel Lives, which might prevent the Greeks from merely substituting native for Ottoman tyrants. Korais was by no means alone in publishing editions of classical texts, histories of the ancient world and grammars of ancient Greek, in most cases adaptations from the original German. In the schools and colleges that were revived or came into being during these critical decades, there was a very heavy emphasis on the classics, introducing a strong classical bias into the Greek educational system that has continued up to the present. In schools such as the Academy of Chios, the Ellinomouseion of Ayvahk, the Philologiko Gymnasio in Smyrna, the Megali tou Genous Skholi at Kurugegme on the Bosphorus, the Ionios Akadimia in Corfu and the Lykeion in Bucharest, the study of the classics of ancient Greek literature dominated the curriculum.\n\n22\n\nI KATH'IMAS\n\nANATOLI\n\nAn American missionary, the Revd Levi Parsons, during a visit to the Academy of Chios in 1820, noted that: The lessons of the second class are in ethics and history, selected from the works of Chrysostom, Isocrates, Plutarch, Dionysius and Lucian. The third class, in distinction from the first and second, are instructed in poetry — lessons taken from the Iliad — also in the different dialects and measures. The fourth class study Demosthenes, Plato, Herodotus, Homer, Sophocles, Euripides and Pindar, and are required to translate frequently from the ancient Greek.1 The years immediately before 1821 also saw theatrical performances of the classics of the ancient world. There was, for instance, a performance of Sophocles' Philoctetes in the Greek theatre in Odessa in 1818. A direct outcome of this growing progonoplexia, or ancestor obsession, was the practice that developed during the first decades of the nineteenth century among some Greeks of substituting the names of the worthies of ancient Greece for the traditional Christian names that they had received on being baptised. A classic instance of this kind occurred at the Ellinomouseion of Ayvalik in 1817, at the instigation, significantly, of a foreign traveller, the French philhellene Ambroise Firmin Didot. In order to revive within the precinct of the college the language of Demosthenes and of Plato, Firmin Didot prevailed on the students to covenant to abandon their coarse and vulgar vernacular for their 'mother tongue', the only one which befitted the descendants of the Hellenes. The penalty for failure to adhere to this undertaking was the public recitation of a page of Homer. In putting their names to the covenant the various signatories adopted classical names in place of their Christian baptismal names, so that Charalambos became Pausanias and Dimitrios Themistocles. 2 At a prize-giving ceremony in an Athenian school in 1813, the headmaster presented each of the prize-winners with a branch of laurel and of olive, declaring that 'now your name is no longer Yannis or Pavlos or what have you but Pericles, Themistocles or Xenophon. Fear God, help your Motherland and love Philosophy.' 3\n\n1 D. O. Morton, Memoir of Rev Levi Parsons ...

Korais, in the preface to his edition of Isocrates, expressed his bitterness against those Europeans who had stripped Greece of 'all the memorials and remains of her ancient glory'. But, although shaming to the Greeks, this had at least ensured their physical survival and had saved them from total destruction at the hands of his ignorant fellow-countrymen. Enraged by the sale of the Patmos Plato, he raged that 'the savage peoples of Africa ... could have done no worse'. To prevent similar disasters in the future, which he attributed particularly to the indifference and ignorance of the clergy, he proposed that the Ecumenical Patriarch and Holy Synod in Constantinople forbid forthwith the sale by the clergy, to Greeks or foreigners, of any manuscripts written in Greek. Instead a library, to be known as the Ellinikon Mouseion, should be created where such manuscripts could be properly cared for and catalogued. 1 When the Philomousos Etairia, or Society of Friends of the Muses, was established in Athens in 1813, with a membership consisting of Greeks and foreign philhellenes, it declared as one of its objectives 'the uncovery of antiquities, the collection of marble inscriptions, of statues, of vessels and of any other worthwhile object'. 2 The objects so excavated were to be gathered together in a museum. Little was done in practical terms to preserve the physical heritage of Greek antiquity before the emergence of the Greek state, but the rhetoric of the nationalist intelligentsia continued to resound with impassioned pleas to their fellow countrymen to show a proper respect for the tangible memorials of their ancestral heritage. From the point of view of Greece's longer-term cultural development, the most important manifestation of the Greeks' rediscovery of their classical past was to be found in the increasingly bitter polemics that raged in the decades before 1821 as to the form of the language most appropriate to a regenerated Greece. Greek intellectuals were divided into roughly three camps over this question. At one extreme there were those who argued that the Greeks could only hope to recover their ancestral greatness by reviving the ] A.

In connection with this revived interest in the physical remains of Greek antiquity it is interesting to note that Niko/aos Gaiatis, one of the early members of the Philiki Etairia, the secret revolutionary society that prepared the groundwork for the Greek revolt in 1821, and who was suspected of talking too much, was liquidated by two other members of the Society while the three were visiting the ruined theatre of Epidaurus.\n\n24\n\nI KATH'IMAS\n\nANATOLI\n\nsupposed purity of Attic Greek. At the other were those who sought to systematise the spoken language and to give it intellectual respectability by employing the popular language for the composition of serious books. Adopting an intermediate position were those such as Adamantios Korais, who advocated taking the spoken language as the norm but 'purifying' it of foreign words and constructions. Korais succinctly states his linguistic philosophy in his introduction to his edition of Heliodorus' Ethiopica: So to distance oneself from customary usage as to be unclear in meaning and completely unnatural to the ear is tyrannical. So to vulgarize, on the other hand, as to appear disgusting to those who have received an education appears to me demagogic. When I say that the whole nation shares in the language with democratic equality, I do not mean that we should leave its shaping and creation to the vulgar imagination of the mob. 1\n\nThe debate over the language was waged with astonishing verbal ferocity and, at times, actual physical violence. One leading archaizer, Neophytos Doukas, was set upon one Sunday morning, as he was leaving church in Bucharest, by a gang of pupils of the demoticist Benjamin of Lesvos, at that time director of the Princely Academy in Bucharest. In consequence the Hospodar Brancoveanu ordered that the 'malicious and boorish' Benjamin be banished from the territory of Wallachia. 2 Once Greece had attained independent statehood it was the archaizers who triumphed. The katharevousa, or purified form, became the official language of the state, a predominance that was officially terminated as recently as 1976, while one of the first acts of the present PASOK government in Greece in the wake of its election victory in 1981 was drastically to simplify the system of accents employed in the written language. Greek diglossia in modern times has been the source of untold cultural and educational confusion, and the language question will continue to simmer for a long time to come. Over the years it has created furious controversy. In 1902, for instance, there was actual bloodshed in the streets during the so-called 'Gospel' riots which were occasioned by the publication of Alexandras Pallis' translation of the New Testament into Modern Greek. One of the most extraordinary manifestations of the passions aroused by the language question was the socalled 'Trial of the Accents' (/ Diki ton Tonon). This centred on the charge levelled by the Arts Faculty of the University of Athens against Professor loannis Kakridis, a distinguished classical scholar, that by advocating the 1 Iliodorou Aithiopikon vivlia deka ...

By seeking to challenge the indissoluble link between ancient and modern Greek he was, so many of his colleagues in the Philosophiki Skholi held, inflicting criminal damage to the character of the nation. As a result of these charges he was temporarily suspended by the Senate of the University. One might be tempted to dismiss this episode as merely farcical. But when one remembers that the charges against Kakridis were laid in November 1941, just a few months after the establishment of the tripartite German, Italian and Bulgarian occupation of the country and just as the disastrous effects of the appalling famine of the winter of 1941-2 were beginning to take effect, the 'Trial of the Accents' assumes a note of tragedy. The resurgence of interest in the classical past on the part of the intelligentsia during the pre-independence period was to provoke a hostile reaction on the part of the hierarchy of the Orthodox Church. In 1784 the Orthodox clergy of Bucharest were only with difficulty persuaded to grant a Christian burial to the learned Athonite monk, Neophytos Kafskokalyvitis, after he had cried out in a delirious fever on his death-bed that he was about to join the souls of Plato and Demosthenes. 1 Moreover the Patriarch Kyrillos VI once complained to Konstantinos Koumas, the director of the Megali tou Genous Skholi at Kurugcsmc, that he was quite at a loss to understand the current preference for Thucydides and Demosthenes over 'the most elegant' Synesius and Gregory Nazianzen and averred that the verses of the twelfthcentury Phtokoprodromos were much more harmonious than those of Euripides. 2 His successor as Patriarch, Grigorios V, and the Holy Synod in 1819 issued a famous encyclical in which the hierarchy's opposition to the innovation of giving ancient Greek names to the baptised infants of the faithful was made abundantly clear.3 If the nascent Greek intelligentsia became besotted with the glories of Greece's classical past in the decades before 1821, for the most part they had nothing but contempt for Greece's medieval Christian past. The attitudes of Adamantios Korais in his respect were characteristic. A true child of the Enlightenment, he shared the contempt of Voltaire and Gibbon for the Byzantine Empire and all it stood for. Indeed it was to the prevailing spirit of scholasticism in the Byzantine Empire that he attributed most of the misfortunes of the Greek nation. He once wrote that to read so much as a page !\n\nC.

Moreover his adulation of Greece's ancient culture also led him to despise much of Greece's post-Byzantine culture. He dismissed, for instance, the Erotokritos, that masterpiece of seventeenth-century Cretan demotic literature, as a monstrosity. If a good part of the activities of the intelligentsia was devoted to reawakening a consciousness of the past, this is not to say that their enthusiasms were widely shared among a population that was in large part illiterate. Gibbon may have been overstating it when he wrote that the modern Athenians 'walk with a supine indifference among the glorious ruins of antiquity; and such is the debasement of their character that they are incapable of admiring the genius of their predecessors'. 1 None the less all this ferment was largely confined to the small nationalist intelligentsia, which was to be found more without than within the Greek lands of the Ottoman Empire, and appears to have largely passed by the great mass of the Greeks. Indeed the reaction of the klephtic leader Nikotsaras on being compared in prowess to Achilles — 'What Achilles ... are you talking about? Did the musket of Achilles kill many?' 2 — was probably more indicative of Greek attitudes in the early nineteenth century than the somewhat self-conscious antics of the students at the Ellinomouseion of Ayvalik. Yet as is so often the way with nationalist movements it was this small and unrepresentative intelligentsia that was able to impress its own values on the national movement. Once independence had been achieved the whole cultural orientation of the new state revolved around ancient Greece, a fact that was aptly symbolised by the decision to transfer the capital of the newly independent state from the established town of Nafplion to Athens, at the time little more than a village. In the early years of the independent state the focus of historical writing in Greece was similarly on the glories of her ancient past. As Professor Zakythinos has written, 'authors writing in the first half of the nineteenth century viewed the battle of Chaeroneia as marking the end of the ancient world and thought of the whole of the subsequent history of Hellenism up to 1821 as a dark period of decadence over which lay the \"black mantle of slavery'\". 3 In 1841, for instance, the president of the Archaeological Society, Iakovos Rizos Neroulos, was to declare, on the Acropolis no less, that 1\n\nThe History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, ed.

It is the ignominious exemplar of the extreme wretchedness and debasement of the Greeks.' 1 But just as the Greeks' rediscovery of their classical past had in large measure been due to external stimuli, so their rediscovery of their Byzantine past, and the integration of the two heritages into a common tradition, also came about in response to external factors. In this case the stimulus was provided by a single foreign historian, the Austrian J. Ph. Fallmerayer. In a series of publications, and most notably in his Geschichte der Halbinsel Morea während des Mittelalters (Stuttgart, 1830), he argued that during the early Middle Ages Greece had been overrun by Slav and, to a lesser extent, Albanian invaders. These Slav and Albanian invaders had subsequently been Hellenised, but the element of racial continuity had been destroyed. In so arguing he called into question the most fundamental of the founding myths of modern Greek nationalism, namely that the modern Greeks were the lineal descendants of the ancient Greeks. Fallmerayer's numerous writings on this theme naturally provoked outrage and uproar among the intelligentsia of the fledgling state, as he was to discover personally when he visited Athens in 1833. A number of historians were moved to take up the cudgels against Fallmerayer, but none was more effective or more authoritative than Konstantinos Paparrigopoulos. Born in Constantinople in 1815 and brought up in Odessa, Paparrigopoulos migrated to Greece in 1830. After serving as a low-ranking functionary in the Ministry of Justice, this largely self-taught historian was appointed to a chair at the University of Athens in 1851. His main published work was his History of the Greek Nation from the most Ancient Times until the Present (Istoria tou ellinikou ethnous apo ton arkhaiotaton khronon mekhri tis simeron) published in five volumes between 1860 and 1874, a preliminary version of which, for school children, appeared in 1853. Having earlier argued that only primitive peoples allowed foreigners to monopolise the study of their history, 2 in this great work Paparrigopoulos adumbrated the theory of an unbroken continuity between ancient and modern Greece. There were, he argued, three main epochs in the long and glorious history of the Greek nation, interspersed with two long periods of subjugation to an alien 1 Quoted by K. Th. Dimaras in the preface to Konstantinos Paparrigopoulos, Istoria tou Ellinikou Ethnous [Iproti morphi: 1853] (Athens, 1970) p. 11.

XXIX (1970) pp. 43-90.\n\n28\n\nI KATH'IMAS\n\nANATOLI\n\npower. The first of these great epochs ran from earliest times until 145 BC. This was followed by the Roman occupation, the first period of subjugation. The second great age was that of the Byzantine Empire, which came to an end with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. This was followed in turn by the dark age of Ottoman rule, the second period of subjugation. This was terminated with the achievement in 1821 of a partial emancipation, which would find its culmination in the Great Idea, the union of all areas of Greek settlement in the Near East within the confines of a single kingdom. Addressing himself to the Greek nation, in which he numbered all those who 'speak the Greek language as their own tongue', he argued that the ancient Greeks had discovered the parliamentary form of government and that the modern Greeks had been able to avoid the disunity that had characterised the ancient world by adopting the monarchical forms of the Byzantine governmental system. Paparrigopoulos was by no means alone in seeking to rehabilitate Greece's Byzantine past and to integrate it into the country's living tradition. One of the more influential of Paparrigopoulos' contemporaries, Spyridon Zambelios, in his Byzantine Studies (Vyzantinai Meletai) argued that, during the Byzantine period, 'in a manner of speaking, Hellenism was the head of the household but still a minor, the Church was the guardian of the household, while Rome was simply the renter or caretaker of the house'. Elsewhere he advanced the view that the scourge of the Ottoman Turks was a sacred necessity. For the Ottomans, in expelling the scholars of Byzantium and the writings of Greece in the direction of the homeland of Gutenberg and of Columbus, had acted as unwitting protectors of the creed of Hellenism. 1 But it was undoubtedly Paparrigopoulos who was, in effect, to determine the parameters that have underpinned much of Greek historical writing until the present day. It is, for instance, no accident that the, in many respects excellent, fifteen-volume history of Greece from ancient times until 1941 — one of the great publishing successes of Greece during the 1970s — assumed the title of Paparrigopoulos's great history. Given that the Greeks are a people of the Diaspora and that the independent state has never contained more than a proportion, initially a very small proportion, of the Greek nation, the articulation of a common historical past has assumed an unusual degree of importance in acting as a factor unifying communities scattered throughout the Near East.

When, some years ago, two scholars (successive holders, incidentally, of the Koraes Chair at King's College) appeared to question the physical and cultural continuity of the modern Greeks with their ancient forebears, the reaction within the Greek intellectual establishment was generally one of outrage. For the arguments of Romilly Jenkins and Cyril Mango summoned up the dreaded spectre of Fallmerayer, the mere mention of whose name, according to that percipient observer of nineteenth-century Greece, Charles Tuckerman, was enough to reduce an Athenian professor to apoplexy. When it was pointed out that one of the protagonists in the controversy was actually of Greek descent, one of Greece's leading intellectuals claimed that he had been led astray by his studies abroad and specifically asked why it was that Greece's university professors had not stepped in to protect the national honour. 1 The early history of the Koraes Chair at King's College, of which Romilly Jenkins and Cyril Mango were highly distinguished incumbents, provides in itself a graphic illustration of the way in which academics have been expected to act as purveyors of 'ethnic truth', to employ Romilly Jenkins' apposite phrase. 2 It was founded — together with other chairs (including one held by R. W. Seton-Watson) which were to form the nucleus of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies — under the aegis of Ronald Burrows, who was principal of the college between 1913 and 1920. Burrows was a close friend and committed supporter of Eleftherios Venizelos, the Greek liberal statesman. Indeed he once penned an ode to Venizelos which begins with the unforgettable couplet: Veniselos! Veniselos! Do not fail us! Do not fail us!\n\nBy all accounts Burrows was a most attractive personality and a man of the greatest personal integrity. But a study of the considerable body of material that still survives about the early history of the Koraes Chair suggests that his philhellenic sentiments were liable to get the better of his academic On this controversy see, for example, R. Jenkins, Byzantium and Byzantinism. Lectures in Memory of Louise Taft Semple (Cincinnati, 1963), C. Mango, 'Byzantinism and Romantic Hellenism', Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, vol. XXXVIII (1965) pp. 29-43 and the review article by S. Vryonis, 'Recent scholarship on continuity and discontinuity of culture: Classical Greeks, Byzantines, Modern Greeks', in S. Vryonis (ed.), The 'Past' in Medieval and Modern Greek culture (Malibu, Calif., 1978) pp. 236-56. 2 See chapter 6 'Truth and \"Ethnic\" Truth' in R. Jenkins, The Dilessi Murders (London, 1961) pp. 99-117.\n\n30\n\nI KATH'IMAS\n\nANATOLI\n\njudgement. It is clear that he envisaged that an important part of the role of the incumbent of the newly established chair would be to engage in sophisticated academic propaganda on behalf of Greece and her national aspirations at one of the most crucial junctures in her modern history, the immediate aftermath of the First World War. For it briefly appeared that the age-old vision of the Megali Idea, the Great Idea of bringing all the historical territories of Hellenism within the bounds of a single state, was on the verge of fulfilment. But the first holder of the Koraes Chair, Arnold Toynbee, who delivered his inaugural lecture in October 1919 in the presence of Venizelos, a few months after the ill-fated Greek landings in Izmir, had other ideas. During the First World War he had compiled, under the direction of Lord Bryce, the Government Blue Book on The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, an undertaking during which, as he himself put it, he had learned 'nearly all that there is to be learnt to the discredit of the Turkish nation of their rule over other peoples'. 1 In 1921, however, at a critical point in the rapidly escalating Greek-Turkish confrontation in Anatolia, Toynbee spent nine months travelling extensively in areas under Greek, but not those under Turkish, control. During this time he reported for the Manchester Guardian and, on his return, wrote The Western Question in Greece and Turkey, a work of penetrating insight that remains essential reading for those who would understand the historical roots of Greek-Turkish antagonism. Given that one of Toynbee's conclusions was that the Greeks in the administration of the occupied territories of Western Anatolia had shown themselves to be no more fitted to rule over populations of mixed race and religion than had the Turks, it is not surprising that the book should have aroused bitter controversy in Greek and philhellenic circles, particularly as the publication of the book preceded by a few months the catastrophic expulsion of the Greek armies from Anatolia. The endowment for the chair had, at the behest of Principal Burrows, been subscribed for by the Greek community in Britain. The subscribers were overwhelmingly Chiot in origin (hence the decision to name the chair after Chios's most famous son, Adamantios Korais) and, astonishingly, they had been permitted by the university authorities to retain an element of control over the capital sum raised for the endowment. They were not at all pleased by Toynbee's interpretation of his duties as Koraes Professor of Modern Greek and Byzantine History, Language and Literature and lost no time in remonstrating with the university authorities and calling for Toynbee's 1\n\nThe Western Question in Greece and Turkey (London, 1922) p. IX.\n\nTHE\n\nGREEKS\n\nAND\n\nTHEIR\n\nPAST\n\n31\n\nresignation. At the same time the Greek government which had, at the instigation of Venizelos, voted a subsidy for the payment of the salary of a lecturer in Modern Greek, withdrew its subvention and thus it was that modern Greek was not taught at the University of London for a period of fifty years. Ernest Barker, who had succeeded to the principalship of King's College on the death of Burrows in 1920, loyally defended Toynbee's right to espouse views unacceptable to the subscribers to the chair and the dispute continued to rumble on for a considerable time. The Greek Subscribers' Committee, headed by the former Greek minister in London, that exemplary bibliophile Ioannis Gennadius, appears to have had a mole in the Senate of the University. This informant reported that, in one of the Senate's discussions of the Toynbee affair, a lay member of the Senate, a knight of the shires, had expostulated in a state of high indignation that the academic freedom to which a professor of the university was entitled did not extend to the freedom to behave like a cad. Eventually, in 1924, Toynbee did resign, whereupon he was promptly approached by the London minister of the newly founded Turkish Republic with the offer of a chair at the University of Istanbul. If I have dwelt some length on the Toynbee saga it is because it strikingly illustrates the extent to which the study and teaching of history has been, and remains, in Greece, as in the other countries of the Balkans, a highly charged political issue. The extent to which the notion of 'ethnic truth' still has its champions was strikingly illustrated by a recent case in which a Greek secondary school teacher had the temerity to question the whole notion of the krypha skholeia, the underground schools which, as every Greek school child is taught, purportedly kept alive a knowledge of the Greek language and culture during the dark days of Turkish oppression and which were secretly conducted by the Orthodox clergy because of an alleged proscription of Greek education by the Ottoman Turks. No matter that the Greeks enjoyed a high degree of freedom and autonomy in educational matters or that it was not until 1894, for instance, that the Ottoman authorities made the teaching of Turkish compulsory in all minority schools in the Empire: the hapless teacher was pilloried in the Athenian press. One prominent Greek personality declared that even if the krypho skholeio was a myth, none the less it should still continue to be propagated for such myths were an essential element in the national identity. Even more recently a Greek Cypriot teacher at a private school in Athens, catering mainly for the children of foreign residents, was ordered to be dismissed by the ministry of education, following complaints that he had been engaging in pro-Turkish propaganda in the classroom. What he had in fact done was to ask his class to write an essay looking at the Turkish invasion of\n\n32\n\nI KATH'IMAS\n\nANATOLI\n\nnorthern Cyprus in 1974 from the Turkish viewpoint. This had sufficiently enraged a group of Greek parents to cause them to complain. When ministry of education officials discovered that he had included a few official Turkish government publications with the recommended reading for the class they invoked a 1931 law which prohibited foreign schools in Greece from holding any kind of educational materials deemed to be 'unfavourable to the Greek nation' to justify an order for his immediate dismissal. Ironically the dismissed teacher's wife was of Armenian descent. It would be wrong, however, to end up on a note of pessimism. For over the past twenty years or so the study of modern Greek history has undergone a radical transformation, both within and without the country. Outside the country modern Greek studies have mercifully ceased to be the preserve of belles-lettrists intent on projecting their own Utopian fantasies onto Greece, while within Greece a new generation of scholars are introducing an altogether new element of professionalism into the study of their country's recent history. Doubtless the study and teaching of the past will long remain a politically sensitive area. But there are hopeful indications that modern Greek historiography may yet break free from the shackles of the past.\n\nTHE CORRESPONDENCE OF ADHAMANTIOS KORAIS WITH THOMAS BURGESS 1789-1792\n\nAlmost ninety years ago Professor Ingram Bywater sketched the outline of the relations between Adhamantios Korais (1748 to 1833), the leading figure in the intellectual revival that characterised the Greek world in the years before 1821, and the Oxford classical scholar Thomas Burgess. 1 More recently Korais' relations with Burgess and with another Oxford scholar Robert Holmes have been briefly discussed by Ph. I. Iliou, who utilised material gathered in Oxford by Joannes Gennadius, for many years Greek Minister in London. 2 Since the time, however, when Bywater and Gennadius carried out their researches in Oxford, the greater part of the Burgess archive has been acquired by the Bodleian Library. Among these papers are six letters from Korais to Burgess, four of which do not appear to have been published, while two have been published only in part. 3 The Burgess archive also contains a number of letters from the French classical scholar, Jean-Baptiste Gaspard d'Ansse de Villoison (1750-1805) to Burgess which throw a considerable amount of light on the scholarly activities of his protege, Korais. The details of Korais' association with Burgess, at an early stage in his scholarly career, in so far as they can now be reconstructed on the basis of the surviving correspondence, are offered here as a contribution to the wider study of Korais' role in the development of classical studies in Europe which in now called\n\n1 I.

The noted historian and bibliographer Thomas Frognall Dibdin, for example, considered that 'Europe has produced few critics more learned than is Dr. Coray' 2 . The six surviving letters from Korais to Burgess, which were unknown to earlier editors, are also published here in full to help complete the published corpus of Korais's correspondence. Thomas Burgess, born in 1756, was educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. After graduating in 1778, he was elected a fellow of Corpus Christi College in 1783, a post which he held until 1791. His election was followed by his ordination as a priest in the Church of England in 1784. Burgess's contemporaries seem to have had no great estimation of his abilities as a scholar. Indeed it is recorded that the great Richard Porson (1789-1808) regarded his scholarship with much contempt, which he took little care to\n\n1 Cf. the remarks of P. K.

In spite of considerable industry and an early start Thomas Burgess... achieved nothing of any real importance2. He is perhaps better known as a high functionary of the Church of England, as a campaigner against slavery and as a vigorous religious polemicist. Appointed a prebend of Durham in 1794, he was consecrated Bishop of St. David's in 1803. There he took an active part in educational work, one of his main concerns being the raising of the intellectual standards of the Welsh clergy. He had a leading role in the foundation of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1804 and was instrumental in the foundation of St. David's College, Lampeter, in 1822. His intellectual energies were largely taken up by religious controversy, notably a prolonged pamphlet dispute with the Unitarians between the years 1814 and 1820. A friend of Hannah More and other members of the Evangelical Party, he was vigorously opposed to the Catholic Emancipation Bill of 1829. In 1825 he was translated to the richer see of Salisbury where he remained until\n\n1 J. S. Watson, The Life of Richard Porson, M. A., London 1861, 304 cited by J. E. Sandys, A History of Classical Scholarship, Cambridge 1908, II, 431. Porson, on the other hand, thought highly of Korais. William Maltby recalled that Porson had a high opinion ofCoray as a scholar, and advised me by all means to purchase his Hippocrates, Recollections of the Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers to which is added Porsoniana, London 1856, 322. Porson again referred to Korais's edition of the Treaties on Airs, Waters and Places in a letter of 1 February 1802 to Martin Davy, H. R. Luard, The Correspondence of Richard Porson ..., Cambridge Antiquarian Society, Octavo Publications no. 8 (1867) 71. Luard also published a curious letter linking Porson with Korais. Heinrich Eichstädt had dedicated his edition of Diodorus Siculus (Halle 1800-1802) to Korais, Porson, F. A. Wolf and Daniel Wyttenbach: 'Quatuor viris in re critica summis Diam. Coray Smyrnensi medicinae doctori Richardo Porsoni ... Frideric. August. Wolfio ... Danieli Wyttenbachio... hanc Diodori Siculi novam editionem ... sacravit Henr. Car. Abr. Eichstädt.' In June 1802 Eichstädt wrote to Porson that, while the other three had acknowledged his compliment, he had had no word from Porson: 'Praescripsi simul Coraii, Wolfii et Wyttenbachii nomina, qui Tecum sic ornant et tutantur artes humanitatis, ut illustriorem Criticorum quatuorviratum nullum, mea sententia, aevum umquam viderit ... a Te, Vir celeberrime, nil ego responsi tuli...', ibid., 74. Korais seems to have had some contact with Richard Porson for when, in 1802, he was visited in Paris by two Oxford scholars they brought with them a copy of Porson's edition of Medea. Korais, in recounting this in a letter of 26 December 1802 to Alexandhros Vasileiou, added that he also expected a copy of Hecuba from Porson. When the two visitors expressed surprise that Korais should have translated Beccaria's Dei delitti e delle pene into modern Greek, Tlepl dpaprrifj.dTcov Kai ttoiuÙv, ttoXitlkÛs decopov/ievcov (Paris 1802), Korais gave them two of the few remaining copies, one for Porson and one for J.

A week later, Korais wrote a further short letter to Burgess dated 1 October 1789 (letter 2). Although the next surviving letter dates from February 1791, it is clear that their correspondence continued during the intervening year. In a letter of 19 March 1790 Korais asked Holmes to tell Burgess that he had received his letter, to which he intended to reply as soon as possible. En attendant, he added, /«' lui rends grâces de la peine qu'il s'est donnée, et des toutes les choses honnêtes qu'il me dit au sujet de mes remarques sur Hippocrate2. During this period Burgess showed Korais's emendations to William Heberden 3 (the Elder 1710-1801), one of the most eminent of English eighteenth century physicians. Two letters from Heberden to Burgess mentioning Korais survive among Burgess's papers. In the first, dated 1790, Heberden wrote that : Y o u r f r i e n d Dr. Coray has indeed a great knowledge of the Greek language and is well versed in the writers of it, and is, besides, happy in having good j u d g e m e n t and great critical sagacity. There are n o n e of his corrections but that must appear at least extremely ingenious, and plausible, and m u c h the greatest part are at first sight unquestionably true. For m y part I h a v e n o doubt about any of them, except the last ... I have shown them to one of the best Grecians 4 , that I k n o w a m o n g my Brethren, and he has examined them all in Hippocrates, and has the same high opinion of t h e m and of Dr. Coray, that I have .. . 5\n\nIn a letter of 13 December later in the same year, 1790, Heberden again wrote to Burgess in praise of Korais : W h e n you write to M . Coray be so good as to tell him that I a m very well satisfied with the d e f e n s e of his correction, and think he h a s taken m o r e notice of the objection than it deserved; m y best wishes and compliments\n\n1\n\n'AXkqkoypcHpia, I, 163-164. Ibid., 1,123. 3 As a young man at Cambridge, Heberden acquired a reputation as a classical scholar and contributed a letter from Cleander to Alexias chief physician to Artaxerxes King of Persia on The State of Physic in Greece, to the Athenian Letters, III, London 1743, 194-201. Heberden was described by Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom he treated during his last illness, as ultimus Romanorum, the last of our learned physicians. Evidence of an interesting link between Heberden, Dr. Johnson and John Paradise is afforded by a memoir of Dr. Johnson written by the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds, according to whom Johnson 'established a Club at a little ale house in Essex Street, composed of a strange mixture of very learned and very ingenious odd people. Of the former were Dr. Heberden, Mr. Windham, Mr. Boswell, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Paradise. Those of the letter I do not think it proper to enumerate', C. R. Leslie, Life and Times of Sir Joshua Reynolds: with notices of some of his contemporaries, London 1865, II, 455-456. ^Probably Sir George Baker, see footnote below. 5 MS. Eng. letters c. 136, f. 25.\n\n2\n\nTHE C O R R E S P O N D E N C E OF K O R A I S WITH B U R G E S S\n\n47\n\nattend him. I thank you for communicating his last remarks, which I here return: in these, as in the former I see his great critical sagacity in discovering errors, and a great learning and judgement in restoring the genuine (?) readings: this too is the opinion of Sir G. Baker 1 , to whom I shewed them. It is a most mortifying consideration, that in the present declining state of Greek literature, reputation is all that he is likely to get, and this only in the small circle of those who understand enough of the learned languages to be at all judges of his uncommon merit: an edition of all Hippocrates' works would be an immense undertaking: but the collecting of all his observations in 2 Vol. 8vo might probably be effected in no long time. I hope the University would readily engage to print such a work, that at least he might have the fame of it without any risque of his fortune... 2\n\nThis proposal to publish at Oxford a more extended work consisting of Korais's critical emendations to all the works of Hippocrates was presumably among the topics which Burgess and Korais discussed during the period October 1789 to February 1791, for which their correspondence has not survived. For Ingram Bywater noted an interesting entry in the register of the delegates' proceedings of the Oxford University Press for 4 February 1791: Mr. Coray having applied to the Board to know whether they will treat with him for his Observations on Hippocrates, Mr. Burgess is requested to write to him for further explanation of his proposals3. Arrangements to print the work at the press seemed to have been rapidly completed for in a letter of 24 February (letter 3) Korais expressed his gratitude to the delegates of the press for having agreed to undertake the printing of his work, and also thanked Burgess, through whose good offices this agreement had been brought about. Korais adds the usual author's warning that he cannot guarantee when the work will be ready for the printer for a thousand and one circumstances which one can neither foresee nor prevent can delay the publication of a work.\n\nThis was Sir George Baker (1722-1809) who, like Heberden, was a graduate of Cambridge University. A distinguished physician, he was nine times elected President of the College of Physicians between 1785 and 1795. He was, in the words of the Dictionary of National Biography, 'a constant admirer of literature as well as of science, and wrote graceful Latin prose and amusing epigrams'. Baker also supported the young Porson during the early stages of his career. Heberden and Baker were presumably the two famous London doctors, experts in the Greek language, to whom Korais sent, at Villoison's instigation, a specimen of his work on Hippocrates.

Vous en serez étonné quand vous le verrez, et vous conviendrez qu'il n'y a point de livre de critique qui renferme tant de découvertes. Il a restitué Hippocrate d'un bout à l'autre, et chemin faisant, il corrige une foule de passages d'Herodote, d'Athenée, Platon, Sophocle, Aristophane, Hesychius, etc. Il me montre son travail à mesure qu'il avance, et mon admiration va toujours en croissant. Son premier volume sera prêt et livré à l'impression dans dix mois. Dieu veuille seulement conserver des jours si précieux aux lettres. Sa santé est très foible et très chancelante ; et la position précaire ou il se trouve, la pauvreté où il est réduit, ses inquiétudes sur l'avenir aggravent ses infirmités. Je lui ai communiqué, Monsiur et cher ami, votre dernière lettre. Il est plein de noblesse et de délicatesse, croit avec beaucoup de raison, que ses intérêts ne peuvent pas être en des meilleures mains que les vôtres, s'en rapporte entièrement à ce que vous ferez et réglerez avec l'Université d'Oxford. Les secours qu'il en tirera, lui serviront pour vivre pendant qu'il rédigera son second volume. Heureusement il est logé gratis chez un ami commun qui a une très belle Bibliothèque dont il tire un grand parti. Des revers ont fait perdre à cette homme vertueux une fortune considérable dont jouissoient ses parens qui étoient les plus forts négocians de Smyrne. Je vous prie en grace d'insérer au plutôt dans vos deux premiers cahiers de vos Observationes Miscellaneae Criticae, aussitôt qu'elles paroitront, toutes les quarante remarques qu'il vous a envoyées, afin de la faire connoître, de donner une idée de son talent et d'annoncer son ouvrage à l'Europe savante ... 1 T h e Observationes in Hippocratem which Korais originally sent to Burgess, at Villoison's instigation in 1789, should not be confused with the Observations on Hippocrates, which the delegates of the university press undertook to publish. The Observationes were included in the two fasciscules of B u r g e s s ' s Musei Oxoniensis litterarii conspectus: accédant pro speciminibus Corayii emendationes in Hippocratem... published in Oxford and London, in 1792 and 1797 respectively. These were some of the 'quarante remarques' that Villoison had asked Burgess to insert in his Observationes Miscellaneae Criticae2. A s Burgess makes clear in the first fascicule, he published these emendations as a prelude to Korais' projected large scale work\n\n' M S . Eng. letters c. 134, f. 136. This letter was published in part, and not entirely accurately, by Harford, who regarded it as an amusing ... specimen of the levity with which this sprightly French scholar treats the formidable difficulties ofemendatory criticism, op. cit., 160-161. ^Burgess had published a Conspectus Criticarum Observationum in Scriptores Graecos et Latinos...,n. p. 1788.\n\nTHE C O R R E S P O N D E N C E\n\nOF K O R A I S\n\nWITH BURGESS\n\n49\n\non Hippocrates: Emendationes in Hippocratem nunc editas accept cum duobis aliis fasciculis ab Auctore eruditissimo sagacissimoque, hodie medico Parisiensi, V. CI. Corayio, qui ad prelum Oxoniense parat Observationes in omnia Hippocratis opera1. The first fascicule was dedicated to Frederick North, second Earl of Guilford 2 , chancellor of Oxford University and father of Frederick North, fifth Earl of Guilford. It contained twelve emendations, the manuscript of which, in Korais' hand, is preserved among Burgess's papers3. The text of an addendum to this first set of emendations is also preserved. The greater part of this addendum was published by Burgess4, but the complete text, as it survives, is given here (letter 4). In the second fascicule a further eleven emendations were published5. The next surviving letter from Korais is dated 19 February 1792 and contains a lengthy discussion of certain emendations to the text of Aristotle's Poetics (letter 5). This was followed by the last surviving letter in the correspondence, dated 1 June 1792 (letter 6), in which Korais reminded Burgess that he had not received a copy of the Musei Oxoniensis litterarii conspectus. He had still not received a copy of this, his first scholarly publication in the field of Greek literature6, by January, of the next year.
