        "text": "He grew up as the son of the Hungarian journalist Pál Sárközy von Nagybócsa and the French lawyer Andrée Mallah. The father comes from a Hungarian count family. At the end of the Second World War, he fled to Germany via Austria before the Red Army invaded Hungary. After graduating from college, Sarkozy studied public law and political science. In 1981 he was admitted to the bar. From 1977 he was on the municipal council of Neuilly-sur-Seine. In 1983 he was elected to his first political office as mayor of Neuilly, which he held for 19 years until 2002. On September 23, 1983, he married Marie-Dominique Culioli, and their sons were Pierre (* 1985) and Jean (* 1987). From 1983 to 1988 he was a deputy in the regional council of Île-de-France. In 1987 he headed the \"Delegation to combat chemical and radioactive risks\" (Mission pour la lutte contre les risques chimiques et radiologiques) in the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nIn 1988 he received his first parliamentary mandate for Jacques Chirac's neo-Gaullist RPR. He then became budget minister and government spokesman under Chirac from March 30, 1993 to May 11, 1995. In the 1995 presidential election campaign, Sarkozy decided against his mentor Chirac and in favor of the eventual loser Edouard Balladur. On October 23, 1996, he married Cécilia Maria Sara Isabel Ciganer Albeniz, and their son Louis was born in 1997. Meanwhile, he temporarily withdrew from the major political stage in France. From May 7, 2002 to March 30, 2004, Sarkozy became French Minister of the Interior in the Raffarin government. After the Conservatives' defeat in the 2004 French regional elections, Chirac approved a new cabinet list on March 31, 2004, listing Sarkozy as \"super minister\" for the economy, finance and industry. However, he had to resign from office at the end of November 2004 due to pressure from President Chirac.\n\nSarkozy was elected leader of the UMP on November 28, 2004. In October and November 2005, Sarkozy became a provocative figure for the rioters in the Paris riots, as he called the colored rioters \"rabble\" (\"des racailles\"). In the presidential election on May 6, 2007, Sarkozy was elected President of France with 53.06%. In the second round he defeated the socialist Ségolène Royal. In the first round of voting on April 22, 2007, he won the most votes compared to the other candidates with 31.11%, although he still missed the required absolute majority. On May 16, 2007, Sarkozy was sworn into office.\n\nThis meant that Sarkozy, as head of government, was nominally given the role of co-prince regent for the Principality of Andorra. On May 14, 2007, he resigned from the presidency of the UMP. On February 2, 2008, he married the Italian-French singer Carla Bruni in Paris."
