If you know of any, please submit feedback via the link at the bottom of the page. Excluded are juvenile literature, most self-published works, songbooks, and dissertations. Included are biographies, studies, bibliographies, criticism, and collections of letters.\n\nAUTHORITIES\n\nBelow are references indicating presence of this name in another database or other reference material. Most of the sources listed are encyclopedic in nature but might be limited to a specific field, such as musicians or film directors. A lack of listings here does not indicate unimportance -- we are nowhere near finished with this portion of the project -- though if many are shown it does indicate a wide recognition of this individual.\n\nNNDB [link]\n\nEncyclopaedia Britannica Online [link]\n\nInternet Movie Database [link]\n\nPublic Information Research Namebase [link]\n\nWikipedia [link]\n\nRandom House Dictionary of World Biography (p.33)\n\nThe International Who's Who 2001 (p.96)\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
