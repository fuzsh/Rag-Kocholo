        "text": "New for 2023, Seawind Catamarans has established purpose built production facility dedicated to producing the brand new Seawind 1170 in the European market whilst offering a full Seawind Catamaran Service Centre for its existing owners.\n\nTurkey continues to develop as a manufacturing powerhouse for many industries including marine. The country has developed its reputation as one of the world’s leading boat building locations, with many high end international brands built in the region. As well as many Turkish companies building for the recreational marine industry, the country is now one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of superyachts. This has resulted in the development of high levels of skilled boat builders and a strong marine supply infrastructure ideal for Seawind Catamaran’s planned expansion into the eastern Mediterranean region.\n\nLocated in the IZBAS export industrial free zone in Izmir, the newly constructed 5200m2 facility (56,000ft) is purpose built for the Seawind 1170 production line, with production commencing in June 2023. All production tooling has been completed and shipped from Vietnam to Turkey in Q1 2023, with key Seawind Turkey personnel having been in training during development and build of 1170 hulls 1 & 2 at the main Seawind production facility in Vietnam. Hull # 3 is expected for completion in early 2024.\n\nIzmir is Turkey’s third largest city and is a modern, cosmopolitan and vibrant city with a population of 5 million and a well educated, young workforce.\n\nLocated on the far western side of Turkey in the Aegean Sea which lies between Turkey & Greece, the Izmir region is an absolutely stunning location with excellent sailing condition all year round and hundreds of nearby offshore islands, all accessible for the cruising sailor. It is a perfect location to both collect and sail a Seawind 1170, starting a new owner’s sailing adventure.\n\nLikewise, the service centre will also function as a commissioning base for any Seawind owners with models manufactured and shipped from the Vietnam facility and wanting European delivery. International Container vessels typically transit through the Suez canal from Asia, making Turkish ports easily accessed and enabling complete European factory to water shipping options.\n\nLikewise, the opportunity for overseas buyers to collect a Seawind in Turkey, enjoy a season in Europe and then sail west to the Caribbean, Bahamas and the US is an attractive prospect to add to sailing plans.\n\nEstablishing a manufacturing base and major service centre in Europe is a key strategic move for Seawind Catamarans, with the ability to expand further into the European market whilst offering key customer support to both new and existing Seawind owners, with a dedicated Customer Service Centre in Izmir.\n\nNewly appointed General Manager for Seawind Turkey, Kivanc Kardes, comments:\n\n“We continuously see the development of the marine industry in Turkey and we are proud to bring Seawind Catamarans to the region to be part of this strategic development for the company. We have a team of dedicated and highly skilled staff and look forward to delivering these beautiful sailing yachts to their customers who are setting out on their cruising journey. We are excited to be part of the bigger Seawind community”.\n\nRichard Ward, Seawind CEO and Founder, comments: “This new Turkish facility is one of the most exciting recent developments for the fast-growing Seawind group and I warmly welcome Kivanc and his team and wish them huge success in the coming years. The Izmir location is perfect for Seawind to properly service the important European market, both as a strategic production location but also as an accessible and yacht friendly centre for Mediterranean cruising owners. The region is both beautiful and fascinating for the cruising sailors with thousands of years of history, crystal clear blue waters, a benign and temperate climate, and the close proximity of hundreds of Turkish & Greek islands famous for their hospitality and warm welcomes. It is the perfect place to start a sailing adventure or an equally perfect location for a long-term owner to linger awhile for the annual Seawind check up by the experienced Seawind service team”\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nKivanc Kardes, General Manager, Seawind Turkey Email: kivanc@seawindcats.com"
