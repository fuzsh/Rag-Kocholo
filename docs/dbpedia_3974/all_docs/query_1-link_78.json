        "text": "But the sad truth is that Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet and his rival for the ECB leadership, European Monetary Institute (EMI) president Wim Duisenberg, are cut from the same central banker’s cloth. What it comes down to is a question of taste: do prime ministers prefer their monetarists French or Dutch?\n\nCentral bankers themselves insist it makes no difference. “I can honestly say that we don’t talk about the presidency since most of us think that Duisenberg and Trichet are equally good,” says one governor. “Personality just isn’t relevant when it comes to monetary policy.”\n\nIf, as seems increasingly likely, Trichet becomes Duisenberg’s vice-president, the world of banking orthodoxy has nothing to fear. The 55-year-old career fonctionnaire has walked over the monetary coals since he went to the Bank of France (BdF) five years ago.\n\nHis single-minded pursuit of the franc fort policy by maintaining historically high ‘real’ interest rates – the cost of borrowing once inflation has been taken into account – has made him few friends among French politicians of left or right, or among leading industrialists.\n\n“He has proved himself in a very stiff test of orthodox monetary policy, and he did that on his own,” says an admiring fellow central banker.\n\nIndeed, cynical observers believe French President Jacques Chirac’s surprise decision last November to nominate Trichet for the ECB had more to do with his deep desire to exile him to Frankfurt than with any wish to have a Frenchman in the post.\n\nAfter all, he is hardly going to do the bidding of the Elysée Palace at the ECB when he so singularly failed to do it in Paris.\n\nIn 1995, when Chirac came from behind and snatched the French presidency from Edouard Balladur, he did it by promising the undeliverable. The unemployed would find work, employers and employees would enjoy lower taxes, students extra funding and families more supplementary benefits.\n\nThe new man at the Bank of France became worried and made the mistake of expressing his concerns in public.\n\n“Monsieur Trichet is not there to tell the government the policies it should carry out in the economic field,” Chirac spat back. Trichet’s reaction was typical, he added, of the “followers of intellectual conformity”.\n\nSafely tucked in at the Elysée, Chirac rewarded his friends and banished his enemies into outer darkness. Trichet was never forgiven, particularly after a dip in the value of the franc on the foreign exchange markets in October 1995 was met by a 1.1% increase in interest rates – and this while the economy was nosediving.\n\nA year later, in his keynote Bastille Day speech, the president lashed out at the “poor management” of France’s state-owned banks – the kind that had led to the humbling of Crédit Lyonnais. Before heading for the BdF, Trichet had been the man at the treasury responsible for overseeing the nation’s banks.\n\nTo cap it all, Chirac apologised to the French people because interest rates, which were “clearly too high”, were out of his hands. There were even hints – not from the president, of course, but in the newspapers – that an investigation into the mismanagement of Crédit Lyonnais could implicate Trichet.\n\nThe summer of 1996 was getting hot for Trichet. Prime Minister Alan Juppé, who felt that his sinking popularity was down to the continued ‘feel-bad factor’ in the French economy, returned from his holidays to deny any rift between the government and the BdF.\n\nHis finance minister stated publicly that Trichet would not be implicated in the Crédit Lyonnais scandal. Meanwhile, the franc fort lost 3 centimes of its value against the deutschemark.\n\nTrichet survived the summer, but still the economy would not grow at a sufficient rate to bring down unemployment. Even though domestic inflation was non-existent, Trichet would only sanction interest rate cuts if they matched those of the German Bundesbank. In the spring of last year, Juppé’s government fell for failing to deliver economic growth.\n\nMany on the Gaullist right still seethe at Trichet and blame him for the utterly unexpected return of the Socialists. Duisenberg, for all his 15 years of monetary severity, cannot match Trichet for his experience in resisting relentless political assault.\n\nYet the Frenchman is content. He has achieved the central banker’s goal in life: inflation is well below 2%, the currency is rock-solid, and short-term as well as long-term French interest rates are the same as Germany’s and below those in the US. Who could ask for anything more?\n\n“His success is more recent than that of the Dutch, but the Bank of France’s policy has been a remarkable success,” says a veteran central banker. “The truth is that the Germans’ problem with Trichet is not with him but with his passport.”\n\nBorn in German-occupied Lyons, Trichet qualified as a mining engineer and took an economics degree before following the well-trodden path of the French civil servant. He went to the famous (or infamous) Ecole Nationale d’Administration (ENA) just after the événements of 1968, when students fought with the police on the streets of Paris, acting as the catalyst for one of the biggest general strikes in French history.\n\nThis mood seems to have rubbed off on the young Jean-Claude, who became known among friends as ‘Justix’ – a pun based on the cartoon strips of Astérix le Gaullois – in recognition of his dedication to equality and social justice.\n\nHe graduated in 1971, with the catch-all title of inspector of finance defining him as a true énarque, and went to work at the finance ministry. His big break came in 1976 with his appointment as head of the treasury’s inter-ministerial committee charged with managing and restructuring France’s then huge public sector industries.\n\nSpotted by Finance Minister René Monory, Trichet moved two years later into his private office to advise him on economic affairs, then on to the staff of President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing.\n\nIn 1981, he moved out of cabinet politics and back to the treasury, first as head of the development aid office and then as chief of international affairs, before becoming chief of staff to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur in 1986.\n\nThat was his final springboard within the civil service and he swapped his post in Balladur’s office a year later for the coveted job of director of the treasury.\n\nThis mighty position made him an international player, chairing both the Paris Club of creditor nations and the EU’s increasingly powerful monetary committee at the same time as Hans Tietmeyer, now president of the Bundesbank, was sitting as a German delegate. The hot-and-cold relationship of the two men mirrored the stormiest periods of Franco-German monetary politics in 1992-93.\n\nSome committee members were pleased when Trichet left for the Bank of France. “He is not the best chairman I ever worked with,” says a former (not British) committee member. “He rambles on and he’s too engagé. A lot of us got fed up with speeches about how EMU would save the world.”\n\nThe same approach has been noted on the EMI’s council. “Trichet tends to speak in a philosophical way while Duisenberg is more pragmatic and businesslike,” says a source. “It’s a cultural cliché, but it also happens to be true.”\n\nUnusually for a civil servant, Trichet has long been passionately and candidly committed to EMU. “He is a true believer. There’s no doubt about that. But he is also realistic,” says a former central banker. “It is possible to be a believer without being a fool.”\n\nA fool he is not. “He works very hard,” explains the same source. “He has acquired very detailed operational knowledge of monetary policy and I always picture him walking around with folders of graphs with yield curves and so on.”\n\nTrichet has taught himself to love economics while his natural passions are literature – Proust, Saint-John Perse and Mallarmé in particular – and modern art. Given that, does he really want to go to Frankfurt?\n\nCV20 Dec 1942: Born in Lyon1968-71: Institut d’Etudes Politiques de Paris, Ecole Nationale d’Administration1971-76: Finance ministry official1976-78: Secretary-general of inter-ministerial industrial restructuring committee1978: Economic adviser to the finance minister1978-81: Industrial adviser to President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing1981-86: Held various senior posts at the treasury1986-87: Chief of staff to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur1987-93: Director of the treasury1992-93: Chairman of the EU monetary committee1993- Governor of the Bank of France."
