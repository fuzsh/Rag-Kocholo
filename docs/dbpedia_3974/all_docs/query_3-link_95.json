        "text": "Izmir, where the vacationers come from all over Turkey, especially in the summer months, is a city where history is mixed with nature. Izmir, which decorates many people’s dreams of retirement in our country, hosts so many places to see around. As a person living in Izmir, I know the value of dozens of places that I can reach every 1 hour when I want.\n\nAlaçatı has become a brand in Turkey. Çeşme is home to the most beautiful beaches of our country. The first quiet cities in our country are Seferihisar and Sığacık. Ephesus Antique City and Seljuk are the most beautiful works of antiquity that can be seen. Şirince is a charming village. The city of Pergamon, the firsts have done in here. Karaburun has untouched virgin coasts to the consumer culture. Foça is the Aegean town, which is named after the seals. All these are just a few of the places to visit around Izmir.\n\nTouristic Places Close to Izmir\n\nALACATI\n\nAlacati has been the ear of tourism in Turkey in recent years. Alaçatı, a neighborhood of Çeşme, is home to one of the most important windsurfing trails in the world. Alaçatı has a traditional stone house, elegant shops, charming taverns, cafes, restaurants and dynamic nightlife. Therefore, it is a center where local tourists visit frequently during the summer months.\n\nThere is no sea in the center of Alacati. However, the concept is considered among the hotels offering the best accommodation experience in our country with its boutique stone hotels. Each of Alacati Hotels has more than 400. Also, they have own spirit and story. Alaçatı tour starting from the windmills continues through Kemalpaşa Street and Hacı Memiş Neighborhood. When talking about this area, there are full of restaurants, cafes, boutiques, design workshops, and souvenir shops. Alacati is an hour away from the center of Izmır by private car.\n\nCESME\n\nÇeşme was once one of the two most important destinations of summer tourism with Bodrum. Although Çeşme has lost this interest to Alaçatı, it is important to note that Alaçatı is a part of Çeşme. Located on the coastline that spans 29 km, Çeşme hosts numerous beaches, each with its own unique texture, thermal facilities, historical and natural beauties.\n\nIn Çeşme, you should visit the bazaar, the marina, and the historical Cesme Castle. Çeşme’s world-famous Ilica Beach is an ideal place for families with children with its shallow sea and golden sandy beach. Yildizburnu, which gives its name of Ilica, offers a tremendous swim experience at a point where the hot water spring meets the sea. The beaches of Deliklikoy, Altinkum, Ciftlik, Diamond, Ildir, and Sifne are full in summer. It takes an hour by car from Çeşme to İzmir.\n\nURLA\n\nOne of the closest loophole points to Izmir city center is Urla. It is known as the district where Klazomenai, one of the 12 Ionian cities, was founded. The history of this region, which dates back to 400 BC, was also an important point in the Mediterranean sea trade. Excavations in the region revealed olive oil amphoras. This proves that Urla olive oil was exported to different parts of the world. If you want to learn about this great journey of olive oil, visit the Köstem Olive Oil Museum.\n\nUrla is located on the seafront and is mostly preferred by the people of İzmir for their weekend breakfast. The city is 40 km away and the highway connection makes it easy to reach Urla. Urla Artichoke Festival is held every year in Urla, due to famous for its artichoke. Kum Denizi, Güvendik, Altınköy, and Demircili beaches are among the most preferred beaches in Urla.
