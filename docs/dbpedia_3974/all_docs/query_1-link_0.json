        "text": "Édouard Balladur (born May 2, 1929, İzmir [Smyrna], Turkey) is a French neo-Gaullist politician, who was the prime minister of France from 1993 to 1995.\n\nBalladur graduated from the prestigious National School of Administration in 1957 and went to work for the Council of State as a junior official. In 1962 he joined the Office of Radio and Television Broadcasting (ORTF). The head of ORTF recommended him to Prime Minister (later President) Georges Pompidou, and during the 1960s and ’70s Balladur was a member of Pompidou’s staff. After Pompidou’s death in 1974, Balladur worked in industry, becoming chairman of two subsidiaries of the national electric company.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1988 Balladur served as councillor of state, and he was an adviser to Jacques Chirac, the leader of the neo-Gaullist party Rally for the Republic (RPR). In 1986 Balladur was elected to the National Assembly as deputy for Paris, but he gave up his seat to join newly appointed Prime Minister Chirac’s cabinet as minister of economy, finance, and privatization. A political moderate, Balladur had helped develop the formula for “cohabitation,” the sharing of power between Socialist President François Mitterrand and Chirac’s conservative government. As finance minister he launched an ambitious privatization program; oversaw the easing of controls on prices, capital, and labour; and supported the introduction of a single European currency.\n\nChirac’s government left office in 1988, and Balladur was reelected to the National Assembly. In March 1993, after conservatives won an overwhelming majority in the National Assembly, President Mitterrand appointed Balladur prime minister. Balladur was popular with the people, and in 1995 he announced his bid for the presidency. Many voters, however, were upset that he was running against Chirac, his former mentor, and Balladur placed third after the first round of voting. He subsequently gave his support to Chirac, who later won."
