Born in Paris, France, in 1955, Sarkozy is the son of a Hungarian immigrant father and a French mother of Greek Jewish heritage. Educated as a lawyer, Sarkozy spent several years practicing law before entering the political world. A longtime politician, he began his career when he became a council member in the upscale Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1977, when he was twenty-two years old. In 1983, Sarkozy was elected mayor of Neuilly, a position that he retained for nineteen years. A decade later, in 1993, Sarkozy stepped into his first post in the French government when he became budget minister and spokesperson for Prime Minister Eduard Balladur. He held numerous government posts during his career, including minister for communication, minister of the interior, and minister of the economy. Once an important member of President Jacques Chirac's administration, Sarkozy fell out of Chirac's favor when he became allied with Balladur in an unsuccessful presidential race against Chirac. Later, after reconciling with Chirac, Sarkozy became the administration's minister of the interior in 2002. Sarkozy again challenged his mentor, becoming president of the French Republic in a decisive victory in the 2007 elections.\n\nThroughout Sarkozy's career in politics, he has \"battled criticism that he is too zealous and hard-edged,\" commented Carol Matlack in Business Week. These characteristics served him well during his stint as minister of the interior, when much of his time was dedicated to addressing and fighting crime in France. His dedication, personal approach, and tenacious adherence to his goals and policies helped make him a popular political figure, with expansive support from his voter base. In the wake of the 2007 elections, Sarkozy \"has a powerful mandate from the French people to push through reforms, after a huge turnout in the election which saw him triumph over\" Royal, noted a reporter on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) News Web site. A tireless, almost hyperactive worker, Sarkozy—known in many circles as Sarko—brings new energy and modern ideas to the governance of France.\n\nIn addition to his role as a statesman and political leader, Sarkozy is also the author of several books. French politicians and leaders are considered intellectuals and are expected to be writers as well, noted a reviewer in the Economist. ‘Nobody in France asks how a minister has time to write a book. To publish is to exist,\" the Economist reviewer stated. Furthermore, the critic observed, \"The elite considers the command of written French as an expression of national identity\" and serves as a means of connection with French hero De Gaulle, who wrote prolifically before joining the Resistance and becoming a politician. \"Since his time, every president has tried to follow suit,\" the Economist writer reported.\n\nIn Testimony: France in the Twenty-first Century, published in France as Tèmoignage, Sarkozy offers a pre-election evaluation of France and its policies, and a manifesto with a clear summary of Sarkozy's political attitudes and aspirations. Written while he was still minister of the interior and considering his run for the presidency, Testimony contains Sarkozy's criticism of the French as he expounds on his pro-America stance, explains why he is in favor of the American style of economic dynamism as opposed to the suffocating morass of regulation found in France, and encourages France to retain its \"social safety net\" intact and unchanged. He also approaches controversial topics for the French, including the use of affirmative action in the country, French wealth creation and distribution, crime control and criminal justice, his opposition to the death penalty, and more. Booklist reviewer Jay Freeman named the book a \"candid series of observations from a politician likely to play a major role in future world affairs.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAfrica News Service, May 28, 2007, \"New President, Renewed Direction.\"\n\nBooklist, April 15, 2007, Jay Freeman, review of Testimony: France in the Twenty-first Century, p. 20.\n\nBookseller, December 2, 2005, Barbara Casassus, \"Sarkozy in Censorship Storm,\" p. 12; February 24, 2006, \"Controversial Sarkozy Book ‘reworked’,\" p. 16; December 22, 2006, \"Sarkozy Gives Testimony to UK,\" p. 10.\n\nBusiness Week, February 3, 2003, Carol Matlack, \"‘Sarko’ in the Spotlilght; The New Interior Minister Has Flair—and Presidential Hopes,\" p. 24; November 21, 2005, Carol Matlack, \"Man in the Middle of a Firestorm: As Riots Rage, Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy Is Feeling the Heat for His Tough Policing Tactics,\" p. 28.\n\nEconomist, July 29, 2006, \"Publish or Perish; French Politicians,\" p. 50; March 3, 2007, \"America's Friend; The French Election\"; p. 86; May 19, 2007, \"An Inclusive Government; France's New President,\" p. 56; May 26, 2007, \"A Study in Perpetual Motion; France's New Government,\" p. 54.\n\nEconomist Intelligence Unit: Country Views Wire, May 11, 2007, \"France Politics: The Gaullist Revolutionary,\" profile of Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nEuropean Report, May 31, 2005, \"Chirac Appoints Villepin as Prime Minister, Sarkozy to Home Affairs,\" p. 104.\n\nEuropean Venture Capital Journal, October, 2004, \"Sarkozy Boosts French Private Equity,\" p. 7.\n\nFinancial Times, May 7, 2007, Martin Arnold, Peggy Hollinger, and John Thornhill, \"Sarkozy Sweeps to Power in France,\" p. 1; May 21, 2007, \"A Very French Sort of Grand Coalition: Sarkozy's Inclusiveness Is Smart.
