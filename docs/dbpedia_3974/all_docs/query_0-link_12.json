        "text": "Izmir – Asian and European, Greek and Turkish, Christian and Muslim – cannot be categorised. Even its name is of mixed origin. As Istanbul comes from the Greek eis teen polis, into the city, so Izmir comes from eis teen Smyrna, into Smyrna. Legendarily founded by ancient Greek colonists, Smyrna became one of the most brilliant of their cities in Anatolia, a nursery of mathematics. It was the largest and most Romanised of the cities of Asia Minor under the Romans, with many temples and a vast theatre, “the joy of Asia and the ornament of the Empire”. Saint Paul founded an early church there on his visit in 53-56 AD.\n\nPillage and decay were to be its fate – attacked by Seljuk Turks (1082), the Genoese (1261), the Knights of Saint John (1344), Timur (1402), and Venice (1472); after the 15th century Izmir dwindled to a small market town in the Ottoman empire, serving the surrounding region. In 1580 it had just 2,000 inhabitants.\n\nIzmir owed its rebirth after 1600 to its geographical position, at the end of a long gulf on the coast of Anatolia where the Mediterranean projects deepest into the westernmost point of Asia. The gulf has some of the finest anchorage on the coast and can receive the largest ships. So Izmir enjoyed a second golden age, as the pearl of the Levant and the eye of Asia. Merchants made Izmir; they wanted to evade the Ottoman government’s customs dues and price restrictions. As early as 1574 Istanbul suffered shortages because Ottoman ships, sailing from Egypt with provisions for the capital, unloaded them at Izmir, where they could get better prices than those imposed at official weighing-stations.\n\nThen, as now, cotton and figs were Izmir’s principal products. Ripened in the valleys of Anatolia, figs were, and still are, dried, packed and exported from Izmir to Istanbul and Europe. From the start, the overseas trade was dominated by foreigners. On his way to Jerusalem in 1621, Louis Deshayes de Courmenin noted that while Turks, Greeks and Jews lived inland in separate districts, foreign merchants’ residences lined the seafront and they lived in great freedom.\n\n’Smyrna, what wealth!’\n\nThe arrival of consuls confirmed that Izmir was becoming international and by 1630 it had Venetian, Dutch, English and French consuls. The French consul lived like a king, with his own Janissary guards, keeping open house for visiting Frenchmen and running an elaborate and profitable system to buy back Turkish slaves captured by the Knights of Malta. In the 1670s the great Ottoman writer Evliya Celebi was impressed by the wealth of the Franks and the power of the consuls: “The ships of the Franks come so often that half of the city of Izmir is like Firengistan [Europe]. If someone hits an infidel, everyone immediately surrounds him and takes him and brings him to the consular judge or the infidels execute him... the Muslim people become invisible so... it seems a dark Frank place.”\n\nEvliya praised Izmir as the most celebrated port in the empire because of the number of ships loading and unloading. When foreign fleets sailed in from Marseille, Amsterdam or London, thousands of small boats rushed out, eager to cut out the middle man, and exchange the produce of Asia – silk and camel hair, opium, fresh mastic, grapes and figs – for the manufactures of Europe: cloth, tin and household goods such as mirrors, plates, needles and knives. Izmir was where Asia came shopping for Europe, and vice versa. It was also the hub of a vast network of land routes by camel and mule train. Caravans from Aleppo or Persia might have 1,500 camels. People had to stand aside in the lanes as they passed, or knelt for unloading. But even the main street of the Frank district, parallel to the coast, was dirty, ill-paved and narrow with a gutter down the middle. There were no large streets or squares.\n\nIzmir was always a city of churches and synagogues, as well as mosques, and astonished Europeans with its apparent complete freedom of religion (also true of other cities of the Levant). By 1700 it had 19 mosques, three Latin, two Greek and two Armenian churches, and eight synagogues. In Frank Street you might be in a Christian country, and some European merchants never learnt Turkish since they did business in Italian through Jewish intermediaries. Izmir’s taverns were famous, especially during carnival. People danced in French, Turkish or Greek styles with such frenzy that some Turks thought them mad. Izmir’s women, combining the grace of Italians, the vivacity of Greeks, and the stately tournure of Ottomans, had an almost irresistible fascination.\n\nThe population grew from 5,000 in 1600 to 100,000 in 1700 – perhaps seven Turks to two Greeks, one Armenian and one Jew. In the 18th century, France dominated the foreign trade, as it did the foreign relations, of the Ottoman empire. Between 1748 and 1789 one in four ships leaving Marseille went to Izmir – the biggest of all ports for French international trade, and the largest and wealthiest port in the Ottoman empire. (There are still businessmen living in Izmir, members of the Guys, Pagy and Giraud families, whose ancestors came there in the 18th century; though they now feel they are the last of their kind.) “Smyrna, what wealth!” said Tsar Alexander I to Napoleon I’s ambassador in 1808, as they were planning the partition of the Ottoman empire.\n\nThe need to reinvent itself\n\nIzmir was also a city of earthquakes, plagues, fires and massacres so frequent that only its inhabitants’ resilience, and the unsuitability of rival ports, can explain its success. There were constant plague outbreaks – that of 1739-42 killed 20% of the population; another between 1759 and 1765 about 50%; between 1812-15 45,000 died. There were earthquakes in 1688, and 1788 (in which 15,000 died). Fires swept the city in 1742, 1752 and 1763. Other disasters were man-made. Below the smiling surface lay a volcano.\n\nThe French orientalist Antoine Galland, who visited in 1673, attributed the relative peace in which the different communities co-existed to the rigour of Ottoman laws: in their hearts even Christians of different sects, as well as Muslims, Christians and Jews, hated each other mortally and all the more fiercely for being obliged to pretend not to. Three reigns of terror by Muslim mobs or soldiers, in 1770, 1797 and 1821, were provoked by Christian acts of aggression – a Russian naval victory in the Aegean, a murder, and the Greek war of independence. Thousands of Christians were killed, proving the fragility of Levantine cities.\n\nYet Izmir always reinvented itself. On pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1806, François-René Chateaubriand compared Izmir to Paris, “an oasis of civilization, a Palmyra in the middle of the deserts of barbarism.” Izmir was also becoming a great Greek city. Trade in the Ottoman empire was the basis of the Greek revival. Greek merchants of Izmir became rich enough to found modern schools and companies there. Even after the proclamation of Greek independence in 1829, thousands of Greeks came to work in Izmir. They preferred groaning under the Turkish yoke and making a decent living to independence in poverty. By the mid 19th century, for the first time since the 14th century, the number of Greeks in Izmir surpassed the number of Turks – 55,000 to 45,000 (plus 13,000 Jews, 12,000 Franks and 5,000 Armenians). The Turks called it Gavur Izmir (infidel Izmir), the Greeks sweet-smelling Smyrna.\n\nLighthouse of the empire\n\nAs it became richer and larger in the 19th century, Izmir began to regard itself as the lighthouse of the Ottoman empire. Against British opposition, a new quay and port were was built by the great French firm of Dussaud Frères in 1869-75; the biggest such project in Ottoman history. Soon the Cordon was lined with warehouses, offices and elegant hotels, cafés and theatres: Café de Paris, the Sporting Club, the Hotel Kraemer, the Hôtel des Deux Augustes.\n\nColonel Playfair wrote in 1881: “The quay recently constructed of massive stonework 60 foot wide and nearly 2 miles in length is the favourite promenade in the evenings and up to a late hour at night. The numerous cafés along it are brilliantly lit up and form the rendezvous of motley costumed crowds while strains of oriental as well as European music are heard on all sides.” Cafés offered Turkish, Arab, Armenian and European music to please customers.\n\nIzmir had the Ottoman empire’s first local newspaper, first American schools, first racecourse, first railway, first football team, first motor car and first cinema. Old postcards show the frenetic shipping activity. The shops along Frank Street – Bon Marché, Petit Louvre – were so good that Istanbul brides came to Izmir to buy their trousseaux.\n\nTurks were also becoming rich through the trade of Izmir: for example, the Ushakizade family, one of whom, the writer Halid Ziya, became the sultan’s principal secretary. Another, Muammar Bey, became mayor in 1911 and lived in an elegant French-style villa – now a museum –in the suburb of Goztepe. His daughter Latife Hanim married Mustafa Kemal – Ataturk. In no city in the world, remembered the US consul George Horton, “did East and West mingle physically in so spectacular a manner as at Smyrna”.\n\nPoison of nationalism\n\nBut Izmir contained the seeds of its own destruction and history illustrates the poison of nationalism. As they prospered, some Izmir Greeks became more open in their desire to undermine the Ottoman empire. In 1897 many volunteered for the Greek army in a war against the Ottoman empire. Greeks also started frequent anti-Jewish riots, caused by rumours of the ritual murder of Greek children. In 1872 the governor had to cordon off the Jewish quarter with police to protect it from Greek bands who had already killed several Jews.\n\nThe empire generally ruled with a light hand. On some 14 July celebrations, French consuls boasted, there were so many French flags and orchestras playing the Marseillaise that Izmir appeared to be a French city. French-connected families included the Armenian Balladurs: Edouard Balladur, who became prime minister of France, was born in Izmir in 1929.\n\nNevertheless, after the Turkish defeat in the Balkan wars in 1912-13 and the settlement of thousands of Turks from the Balkans in Anatolia, tensions increased. The end for Gavur Izmir began with the arrival on 15 May 1919 of ships with 13,000 Greek troops under British protection. Playing with nations, Lloyd George believed in “a new Greek empire in the East friendly to Britain”. The Greek prime minister Elefthérios Venizelos believed that “Greece can only find her real future from the moment when she is astride the Aegean”.\n\nAfter the Greeks landed, hundred of Turkish troops were slaughtered and humiliated along the quay. Each community thought of its national interests, not of the future of the city. The Greek occupation of Izmir and the advance of Greek forces deep into Anatolia was the best recruiting agent for Ataturk, who had landed at Samsun, on the Black Sea, four days after the Greeks in Izmir. Without it, he later said, Turks might have gone on sleeping.\n\nIn 1920 Greek officials formally took over administration of the city and province, although the latter had a Turkish majority. The outlook seemed brilliant. Of the 27 newspapers published in Izmir in 1919, 11 were in Greek, seven Turkish, five Jewish (Hebrew or Ladino), five in Armenian and five in French. That year 7,000 ships docked. The city had 15 cinemas, 513 cafés, 226 tavernas, 43 beer halls and eight dance halls. But a British intelligence report said “the fundamental hostility existing between the two races has been much intensified by the mere presence of the Greeks [in occupation]”.\n\nIn August 1922 the Greek army in Anatolia, which had almost reached Ankara, was defeated by Mustafa Kemal. Greek soldiers, divided, demoralised and desperate to get home, burnt and looted Turkish towns and villages, including Manisa and Aydin, killing many inhabitants. In Izmir life had continued as normal. The fig crop was being unloaded on the quay. Rigoletto and La Traviata were being performed at the Sporting Club by a visiting Italian troupe.\n\nThe arrival of Ataturk\n\nNews of the Greek rout filled the city with dread. The rich began to leave. On 8 September the Greek authorities and army embarked with their archives, abandoning those they had come to liberate. On 9 September Mustafa Kemal’s army entered the city, as photographs make clear, in perfect order. The next day Kemal entered the city. He had a drink at the Hotel Kraemer on the Cordon, visited the Konak to confer with Nurettin Pasha whom he had placed in command of the city, then withdrew to a villa in Karshiyaka, the other side of the bay. Looting and killing by Turks began in the Armenian quarter.\n\nOn 13 September a fire broke out near the Armenian quarter – possibly started, certainly encouraged, by Turkish soldiers, regular and irregular. The Turkish authorities blamed Armenians or Greeks. The fire brigade was shot at as it tried to put out the fire. A change in wind and a firestorm helped it spread. Soon the warehouses, hotels and offices lining the quay, including the Sporting Club and the Hotel Kraemer, were a wall of fire 4km long and 30 metres high.\n\nAs they had during massacres in 1821 and 1797, Christians fled to the quay, where most Izmir Armenians and many Greeks were killed. The screams of refugees from inland Anatolia as well as from Izmir and the rattle of pistol and rifle shots could not drown out the roar of the fire and the crash of falling buildings. Britain, America, France and Italy had already evacuated their nationals. Finally, in some cases compelled by their horrified crews, the foreign battleships in the harbour took on board those refugees who did not drown while trying to reach them.\n\nThroughout September, about 221,000 refugees were taken off the Cordon. Within a month the city had changed character. Surveying the flames from the Ushakizades’ villa where he was courting Latife Hanim and celebrating his victory, Mustafa Kemal said, (according to his recent biographer Andrew Mango): “Let it burn. Let it crash down.” The Turkish journalist Falih Rifki Atay, who had come to interview Kemal, noted: “Although the burning of the city was a grievous loss, Muslim Izmir did not lose any of the joy of victory.” Turkish flags were hung in the streets.\n\nMustafa Kemal later wrote: “Why were we burning down Izmir? Were we afraid that if waterfront mansions, hotels and restaurants stayed in place we would not be free of the minorities?” This was not a simple urge to destroy. Part of it depended on a feeling of inferiority – as if anywhere that resembled Europe was destined to remain Christian and foreign and be denied to the Turks, although previously the Ottoman government and Muslim population had enjoyed, protected and profited from Gavur Izmir.\n\nAnother reason was fear. The Greek army had nearly won. The minority problem could be eliminated forever. After 15 October thousands of remaining Greek and Armenian men were marched into the interior in labour battalions, in theory to rebuild villages the Greek army had destroyed. Most were never seen again.\n\nGreek refugees from Izmir brought many things to Nea Smyrna (a suburb of Athens where they settled), and elsewhere: radical views which helped overthrow the monarchy and establish the Greek Communist party; the haunting Sufi-influenced rembetiko music of Anatolia; commercial skills; and memories of a paradise lost.\n\nThe centre of the city was ruin and rubble for years, but in all only 14,000 of 43,000 houses had been destroyed. Slowly trade revived with government encouragement. By 1925 the president of the Izmir Chamber of Commerce stated that Turkish businessmen had opened 54 new stores. A trade fair started in 1932, in the culture park laid out where the Greek district had been. The centre was given a more spacious layout (in part due to the great French urbanist Henri Prost), and new street names.\n\nToday, with a population of three million, Izmir has recovered its prosperity and identity. The café-lined Cordon has more in common with other Mediterranean, even Greek, cities than with some inland Turkish cities. Izmir is one of the few cities in Turkey to have voted against the current post-Islamist government and in favour of the Republican People’s Party, the heir to Kemal’s modernising secularism. It is again, as it was for most of the past 400 years, both a great Turkish and a great European city."
