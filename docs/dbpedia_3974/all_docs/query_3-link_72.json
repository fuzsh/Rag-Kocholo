        "text": "İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey and one of the oldest settlements in the Mediterranean sea region. It’s a popular visitor destination owing to its cultural heritage sites, location on the Aegean Sea, and sunny weather. There are some terrific options for running in İzmir, with many kilometers of waterfront paths, some lovely parks, mountain trails just outside the city.\n\nThe best place to run in İzmir is along the series of waterfront paths — some 9 km along the Kordon, and 6 km across the bay along the Karşıyaka Waterfront, which includes numerous small parks. At the south end of the Kordon, we also love running paths in Engelliler Park, then aling the water to Inciralti Beach Bridge. For a great park run, enjoy the palm-lined paths of Kültürpark İzmir, which can be combined with the nearby Kordon or our Old Town/Archeological Sites tour. For those who want some hills and trails, the best bet is the National Forest in Balçova. Further outside İzmir are numerous mountains and forest preserves offering lots of trail running options.\n\nAll of our routes are accessible via İzmir’s excellent public transport system, which includes a subway, tram, and buses. Runners should note that summer weather is sunny and hot, with daytime temps consistently in the 30-35C range.\n\nThis gorgeous seafront promenade is the signature run in İzmir. The wide path runs along the Aegean Sea for 9.3 km from Alsancak south to Üçkuyular. Great views of the water, parks with additional paths, and several important İzmir sites.\n\nA lovely park and waterfront run in the western part of İzmir. The highlight is Engelliler Park, a forested peninsula with waterside trails. Continue along a waterfront path to Inciralti Beach Bridge. Can combine with our Kordon route.\n\nAcross the bay in Karşıyaka, there's another scenic promenade along the Aegean Sea that makes for a scenic run. The path runs for 6.3 km between the Mavişehir marina and Muammer Aksoy Park. Terrific water views, several parks, and some sites.\n\nThis large, landscaped park featuring several km of tree-lined paths and fountains is a great spot for a run in central İzmir. We've put together a 5 km loop combining the park with a section of the Kordon waterfront promenade.\n\nCreate your own 'runseeing' tour of key archeological sites and the winding, narrow streets İzmir old town, between the Cankaya and Konak subway stations. Go early before the markets & crowds. Can combine with Kültürpark & Kordon waterfront paths.\n\nGreat spot for some hill and trail running. There's a steep, paved road to the summit, and numerous other trails. One can also take a cable car to the summit and run from there. Great views!"
