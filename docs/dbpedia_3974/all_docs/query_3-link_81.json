        "text": "The town of Foca is located northwest of Izmir and also has a town called Yenifoca, meaning ‘new Foca’. For this reason, it is often referred to as Eskifoca, meaning ‘the old Foca’. Foca stretches along two bays, a large one and a smaller cove within the large bay. Foca was a flourishing city during the 5th century, with the Phocaeans being great mariners. The bay was used to send vessels to the Black Sea, Aegean and Mediterranean. Foca is known for its rare Monk Seal population, which live on the small offshore islands. It is thought that there are only 400 left in the world, so Foca’s conservation projects are vital tot here survival. The surrounding area includes the coastal town of Cesme, and Izmir which is one of the biggest cities in Turkey.
