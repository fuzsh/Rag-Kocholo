        "text": "Th e initial traces of mutual relations between Paris and Ankara date back to the 16th century. During the Ottoman Empire, bilateral relations between the Empires fl ourished in terms of economic relations where France enjoyed capitulations. Th e French-Turkish relations encompass both alliances and wars. Currently there exist serious dissidences in terms of democracy, human rights and freedom issues. Apart from that Paris’s opposition of Turkey’s future full European Union membership blocking fi ve chapters and accepting genocide claims against the so-called Armenian genocide, Turkey’s Kurdish question constitute a huge obstacle for the future development of French-Turkish relations.\n\nTürkiye and France have had good relations since 1921. But interests of Türkiye and France do not mostly align and does even conflict in many cases since 2012. Even that France is at the very center of many problematic issues that Türkiye has to deal with. The two parties are on the opposite sides of each of many foreign policy issues -namely relations in the EU framework, the events of 1915, Mediterranean, Syrian question, possession of influence in Africa and the positions in the Caucasians- and Türkiye has to cope with French foreign policy to achieve its aims because France as a great power can not be disregarded easily for its capability to affect the course of events. The competition in foreign policy between two countries can be interpreted in terms of status quoism and revisionism. In some policy areas France is a status quo state while Türkiye is a revisionist and in some other areas, the roles are exchanged. This study aims to reveal the positions of two sides in the selected policy areas and display the challenging impact of France in Turkish Foreign Policy by using case study approach.\n\nMigrants of Turkish origin and their descendants constitute a rather heterogeneous group of persons in Europe with respect to their recent economic, political, cultural, ethnic and religious dispositions. In an attempt to challenge the stereotypical representation of these ‘Euro-Turks’ in their homeland and countries of settlement, extensive qualitative and quantitative research was carried out in Germany and France by the Centre for Migration Research during late 2003 and early 2004. One of the premises of the work is that Euro-Turks would provide both strong support and an impediment to Turkey’s EU membership. Thus the research has aimed at investigating whether EuroTurks living in Germany and France could become a driving force or vanguard for Turkey in the process of integration into the European Union. It identifies the social, political and cultural discourses of the Turkish diaspora concerning Turkish-EU relations. By gauging public opinion among the Turkish groups in Western...\n\nThis thesis analyzes France’s assessment on Turkey’s candidacy for European Union (EU) membership, covering a time period of twenty years -from 1999 to 2019. By the time Turkey has obtained EU candidate country status at Helsinki EU Summit in 1999, a massive debate has occupied French socio-political spheres. Turkish candidacy has been never debated that widely in any EU member country other than France. Equally, France had never debated any candidate country that intensely other than Turkey. The thesis searches for the reasons behind these aspects and evaluates the general arguments along with facts constituting public opinion and leaders’ (multifaceted) discourses. The theoretical framework hereby assumes that values and identities construct discourses, making public opinion valuable as never before. The thesis, then, highlights the French national self-conception, prejudices about cultural characteristics are dominant parameters in forming the opinions of the public and that of l...\n\nThe aim of this paper is to analyse the reasons why the Turkish association had such a “particular meaning and importance” for the EEC to lead the Community to sign an Agreement rich in challenging perspectives. Focusing on the period between Turkey's application for associate membership in 1959 and the signature of the Ankara Agreement in 1963, the purpose here established is to critically analyse the documents and reports about EEC-Turkey negotiations in order to better understand which were the Community's interests the association was related to. The historical perspective adopted aims to include in the analysis different and multiple actors and interests, rejecting “the common perception (of) EU-Turkeys relations […] (as) a two-way game between the two parties”. ."
