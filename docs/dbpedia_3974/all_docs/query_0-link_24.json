        "text": "The Roboly family was originally from Arles-France, the Russo family from Florence-Italy, the Ballin family from Nantes-France and the Fischer family from Austria.\n\nThe author Melih Gürsoy notes in his book Bizim Izmirimiz (1993) that the Balladurs were an old French family to move to Izmir in 1727. His study of the historical archives reveals that there was an Andrea Balladur in 1792 that ran his company in Izmir. His descendants Ernest and Nicola continued his dry fruit and other sorts of agricultural products export business. According to the records there were a Jacob Balladur, a merchant in Izmir in 1893, and a Charles P. Balladur in 1929 who was a car importer and one of the first businessmen to bring the first cars to Turkey. Other notable members of the Balladur family are Herman Balladur who worked in Izmir Pamuk Mensucat, Robert Balladur who once was a Vice-consul at the French Consulate in Izmir, and Edouard Balladur, the Prime Minister of France from 1993 to 1995. (pp.222-3)\n\nThe Balladurs were earlier Armenians, refugees of Persian persecution from the Nachivan region in the 17th century, who became Catholic, migrating to Ankara and thence to Smyrna for full protection from persecution, like many other families whose descendants still live in Izmir."
