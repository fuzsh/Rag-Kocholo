My interest is in Constantine Scaramanga-Ralli (1854-1934) who in 1910 was Liberal candidate for the Isle of Wight (The Leasowes, Shanklin, Isle of Wight)and owned West Hill Manor at Shanklin. He wrote three books in 1906, 1907 and 1908. In 1913 he was a magistrate. I am researching West Hill Manor and would like to know about the family that lived there and the period that they lived there. Do you know where he fits into your family trees, and whether he has living descendants?

I have been trawling and looking for information touching upon the activity of the Fillerin family during WWII. Norbert Fillerin worked for the escape line supported by his wife and daughters. I am researching the history of Squadron Leader Barnard who was a pilot in 142 Squadron. He and his crew were aided by the Fillerin family in 1942. I know of the connection between the above family and Louis Nouveau, it would appear that S/Ldr Barnard was taken to the address in Marseille as seen on your site where Louis is sitting with the other Pat Line operatives. This is a brief introduction by myself and my hope is that you may be in a position to point me in the correct direction to further my research. I would love to be able to make contact with any known survivors who may just have known about S/Ldr Barnard and his transit through the escape line. I hope you will find time to reply. I look forward to hearing from you. Rest assured all and any information will be warmly received. Kind regards.

She was indeed the daughter of Basil... I'm just looking through Aleca Georgala's 'Confessions' album ('reflecting the general sentiments of my friends'), with its many amusing and interesting entries, and was idly putting some of the signatories' names into Google to see if I could find more about them. I put in Mary Zicaliotti and thus came to yr website. The entries in the album are all around 1892. Under 'my favourite qualities in man', Mary has written 'knowing when he's not wanted'. There are so many amusing and interesting entries in the album.

I have since discovered via the Giustiniani site that the Casanovas arrived in Chios from Genoa around 1750 (a branch of the Genoese family Fieschi de Caneto) and had 62 descendants. I have, however, been unable to connect the Casanovas you sent me with those I know are related to my husband. I have been in contact with one of Sophia Casanova's daughters, Eleni, (still living in Chios) who is now very old and is unable to give me much information. I wondered if you had managed to look in the Libro d'Oro to find any further information regarding this family? I would be very grateful for any help. Yours sincerely, Margaret Georgiadou.\n\nFrom: janettyson@[nospam]shaw.ca\n\nSubject: Paul Ralli\n\nDate: 18 December, 2004 18:37:27 GMT+01:00\n\nTo: Editor@[nospam]christopherlong.co.uk\n\nHello: I am researching my family tree and have come across your site. My great-aunt Caroline married into the Ralli family. A cousin wrote to me: \"Paul Ralli was of Ralli Bros, wealthy Greek merchant family with large interests in India; lived with him for a while on a ranch in the USA, subsequently in Wilton Street, London W. Paul Ralli died in 1883 or later. It was from Paul Ralli that Caroline acquired the greater part of her wealth. Harold Bridgen said; on her death the principal was returned to the Greek company. Harold was at one time buying their calicoes\". I am sure there must be a connection, even if we have the dates a little skewed. Do you have any ideas about this, or further information? Wonderful to have found even the name online! Thank you for your time, Janet Tyson.\n\nFrom: JhWadhams@[nospam]aol.com\n\nSubject: Duke of York's Headquarters\n\nDate: 12 December, 2004 9:18:29 GMT+01:00\n\nTo: Editor@[nospam]christopherlong.co.uk\n\nHi Christopher. I'm writing to you about your interesting article on the Duke of York's Barracks. I served with the 47th infantry brigade as a TA soldier in the Royal Fusiliers. & I can tell you the Duke of York's was one of the busiest of places during the 1960s. Our brigade was for morale a great brigade. We met for drill every Tuesday & weekends. We were disbanded when the amalgamations took place. The Royal Fusiliers became the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The Duke of York's bar was a great place to meet. I just thought I would like to support the interesting article you wrote on the Duke of York's. Bye for now & God bless you. Mr. J. M. Wadhams.\n\nFrom: thegoodeyfamily@[nospam]ntlworld.com\n\nSubject: Mr Goodey\n\nDate: 10 December, 2004 19:57:45 GMT+01:00\n\nTo: Editor@[nospam]ChristopherLong.co.uk\n\nI was interested to read an archive article recently about Mr Goodey, Music Teacher at The Hill School. He is my father who now lives in Ireland. Regards, Peter Goodey.\n\n[...and later...]\n\n... It was only by chance that I stumbled across the article on the internet... I was amused by the article and I know that my father would be as well. He has always had a very good sense of humour. Unfortunately he has suffered with Alzheimer's over the past few years and he may well remember you and his school teaching days better than events today. He has led a very full and varied life since 1958 and both my parents are possibly two of the best known buskers in Ireland. They would not be afraid to play the odd hymn on accordion and violin, possibly not Jerusalem, a little English in sentiment. At times they are more Irish than the Irish. He has explored Classical, Church Music, English and Irish Folk Music and has played most days for as long as I can remember. I was born in 1962. My father will be 88 next week. Thanks again for your kind memories; the power of the internet is amazing!

Searching for information on how it came to be in what was Holland Park I came across your piece on the Friends of Holland Park and wonder if you have any history on the acquisition of its site; was it given by the Ilchester estate or purchased from them?

I am a member of a society that studies the old mines of Surrey and we have a good website. I would like to extract the relevant text of your article and put it in the Mine Records section of our site.

I am a descendant of William Henderson and Edith Henderson who married Eustratius Eumorfopoulos. My grandmother who was niece to the above Edith worked as s maid for them when the family lived in Pirbright Surrey. Helen Tucker- Brown.\n\n[... and later...]\n\nHello Christopher, I have only recently started to research my Henderson, Scottish roots and I have found 2 other cousins also researching this line. We have come up with some family 'stories' which seem to be true but we have yet to verify! My mother is the only one to tell me stories about Edith Henderson, married to Eumorfopoulos, handed down to her from her mother who was named after 'your' Edith (the other cousins also know about the union). Edith was one of 11 children born to William Henderson and Eliza Atkins. William Henderson was adopted by a groom, his wife thereby taking the Henderson name. We believe we know who his father was, a prominent person in society with connections but not his mother's name. I would love to know if you have found out anything interesting? History is interesting and strange how some things touch/repeat into descendants lives? Great to hear from you, Helen Tucker-Brown.\n\nFrom: shirley@[nospam]gouldsmith.me.uk\n\nSubject: Gould-Smith & Pat Line\n\nDate: 16 November, 2004 23:29:47 GMT+01:00\n\nTo: Editor@[nospam]ChristopherLong.co.uk\n\nMy own grandfather was helped to leave France over the Pyrenees in October 1942. He was a 58 years old lawyer and with the Pat Line was able to reach Madrid Embassy, and then was helped to Gibraltar where he was taken to England on HMS Adventure, a mine layer, captained by R Bowes Lyon. He reached England the day after Christmas. I have been fascinated by all I have read on your site. Thank you. [Shirley Gould-Smith]\n\n[... and later on 3 Dec 2004...]\n\nDear Christopher... my grandfather was one of the escapees from France in Nov 1942. His too is a good story but I am still trying to find out if I could ever find his de-briefing papers, which I know would be interesting. He met Michael Creswell in Madrid where he was hidden for some days before being taken to Gibraltar and being returned to England on a mine layer. He dictated for four hours what he had to 'tell' in Madrid. He was 58, an international lawyer who had done more than just that while he was in Montpellier for two years! Some mysteries there to be discovered maybe. Today I have spent over and hour on your site: utterly fascinating. I love your cottage at the 'stuffed bridge' [Pont Farcy]! My brother and I have just two little house very similar looking near Bricquebec in the Cotentin. We are a bilingual family, British from France. Thank you for all that I have discovered from you this afternoon. In the line of reaching more about the Pat Line, which helped my grandfather, I have come across Keith Janes, and... my husband and I are meeting him tomorrow for a pub lunch. More wonderful exiting research tales. Thank you.

The will mentions Elizabeth my 4 x gt grandmother, formerly married to Charles Catton. The daughter of this marriage was Maria who is my 3 x gt grand mother. Robert also mentions his mother and father who according to the burial records of Shipdham, Norfolk, were Thomas Denn and Hannah late Vincent of High Ongar, Essex.

I am the daughter of Themistocles A. Sinadino and Jeanne Vlasto who were killed in that fated car accident in 1939. I was wondering why you did such an extended research in my parents background? Did you know them? Did you live in Alex? I would love to hear from you... [she then provides valuable information for the genealogical records...] ... We all live in Canada... During one of our trips to London in 1961 we stayed at aunt Aziza Vlasto's home near Sloane Square, [London]. Do you know of her? She passed away but I remember she had a son in the diplomatic service [in fact a son-in-law, Sir John Nicholls]. Looking forward to hearing from you. Best regards, Betty Coumbias (Elisabeth).\n\n[... and later...]\n\n... It is fun to read all about our family and both my girls... are thrilled to discover relatives. You once mentioned [that you'd be interested to hear] 'anecdotes' and I thought you might like this one. Tante Etta Vlasto was sort of a snob and when she found out I was dating George she asked me pointedly: 'Does he know the Salvagos? Is he related to the Choremis? Does he own a car?' To all of which I answered 'No'. So her comment was: 'Well, what do you see in him?' I guess I saw enough to know that I'd be happy to spend the rest of my life with him. We're still going strong after 46 years! Best regards till next time. Betty.\n\nFrom: ThorpeDixon@[nospam]aol.com\n\nSubject: Louise Warrington\n\nDate: 5 November, 2004 19:02:21 GMT+01:00\n\nTo: Editor@[nospam]christopherlong.co.uk\n\nDear Sir, Louise Warrington was my great aunt.

I know quite a lot about my maternal side but little about my paternal side (other than the direct line) Â– and am trying to find out more. I am actually British but emigrated to New Zealand some years ago and my family name through many generations has been Burrell Thomson. It seems such a coincidence that there should be an Ian Burrell Thomson; we must surely must be related (i.e. a cousin)? Can you give me any more detail Â– such as parents, grand-parents etc. Your help would be gratefully received.

I have forwarded your details to my uncle in Greece (Les Vlasto, Une Famille Patricienne CrÃ©toise)to begin our research again. Our family name was changed when we arrived after Constantinople. I have asked my uncle to advise what our previous name was. Our people the Saridakis's are still concentrated in the Village of Megalo Charifia, Western Crete (approx. 3km from Souda and 9km from Hania) and were one of the twelve major landowners of Crete. I will provide more information about us since I am writing a book on the subject and would like to trade and information on the subject, etc. Sincerely, Andrew Peter Saridakis.\n\n[... and later on 5 Nov 2004...]\n\nDear Mr. Long: My uncle has been searching for a book he once found about Crete, Aptera and the families of Aptera. I think some French or English wrote it. It's an old book. Do you have a copy of this book or is the book available in the NLG (national library)? I apologize but we do not know the title of the book, however, our family name \"Saridakis\" is mentioned in the book along with the original surname that was later changed after the trip from Constantinople. We are able to trace our roots from present day to approx. 300 hundred years, through property, family and relatives that still reside in the village. Our family dates to the Byzantium era over 1,000 years ago. I appreciate your response and look forward to hearing from you. Incidentally, my Uncle Andreas Saridakis(his e-mail listed on top) knows of the name \"Vlasto,\" however, the book is critical as to our lineage. I will give you a list of Saridakis that either reside in Europe, Canada, or the United States, and it is uncanny how we are all very similar in looks, intellect, etc. I recently baptized my son Andrew Michael Saridakis in Aptera, Crete. Nevertheless, as I get older this beautiful story is unfolding thanks to my uncle who got in contact with my eldest brother Dr. Michael Andrew Saridakis, M.D. I look forward to trading information with you and staying in contact and thank you for your efforts and excellent research! Best Regards, Andrew Peter Saridakis.\n\nFrom: jim.detar@[nospam]investors.com\n\nSubject: Request for Interview\n\nDate: 1 November, 2004 20:17:36 GMT+01:00\n\nTo: Editor@[nospam]ChristopherLong.co.uk\n\nHello Mr. Long.

The old Crimean war cannon on St Peter's Green in Stamford and iron fences in Camden designed by John Nash are just a couple of examples of ironwork given up and melted down for the war effort.\n\nNot true according to journalist, Christopher Long who quotes dockers who had: \"worked during the war on 'lighters' that were towed down the Thames estuary to dump vast quantities of scrap metal and decorative ironwork. They claimed that so much was dumped at certain spots in the estuary that ships passing the area needed pilots to guide them because their compasses were so strongly affected by the quantity of iron on the sea-bed.\" (Source: Christopher Long.

There were 3 cottages containing 3 gardeners and a chauffeur, and next door was Lady Muspratt, widow of Sir Max, of I.C.I. whose family lived in the \"Greek mansion\", designed by James Picton in 1841, called Seaforth Hall, now Kellog's mill.

In July I was invited to the reception celebrating the launch of the BBC Neighbourhood Gardener Scheme. This was held at The Orangery in Holland Park and Monty Don was our guest speaker. Before the reception started I had time to wander through some of the park and experience the vibrancy of the whole place. It was a very warm evening and the park was full of life. Needless to say it made a big impression upon me and my friends agreed that it would be a place to revisit and spend a day there in the future. Two weeks ago I returned to college for year two of my FdSc Garden & Landscape Design course, at Otley College, Suffolk, and was promptly given an assignment. This piece of work is centred around either a historic garden or park. Most of my classmates are going to focus on areas either in Suffolk or Norfolk but I would really like to explore the possibility of using Holland Park as my subject. Could you please let me know what kind of information you might be able to offer and also any guidance you could give me in respect to the park's history. Are there any books that I could obtain via my local libraries? I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible, and thank you in advance of any help you are able to offer.

This year I visited the area for the first time and was one of those people who you describe so well: walking alone down old lanes and through fields, searching for long-dead great uncles. I would like to commend you on your insight and found paricularly interesting the paragraphs under the heading \"Beware of Flags\". I well understand your sentiments and myself have a low threshold for innappropriate flashiness: I also visited the Normandy Coast and was troubled by the American War cemetary at Omaha Beach Â– complete with battle diagrams, enormous statuary and noisy busloads of people. It was in marked contrast to the German cemetary at Orglande or any one of dozens of Commonwealth Cemetaries I visited. I'm not sure, though, that I agree with you that flags are entirely inappropriate in all cases. I well take your point that rampant nationalism causes a lot of the problem of war in the first place, but I would like to offer you my perspective. I am Australian and thus was interested when you noted the presence of Australian flags on the Somme and stated \"It appears that they have learnt little from the history they purport to honour.\" I Â– like you Â– value the atmosphere of Commonwealth War Cemetaries devoid of flags and such imagery. The Australian flags I saw, however, where at the Villers Brettoneux Memorial (alongside the Tricolour) and at the Australian Corps Memorial at Le Hamel (with the flags of Great Britain, Canada, France and the United States). I don't think these memorials need be viewed in the light which you describe with the following words: \"grossly impertinent that individual countries attempt to claim flag-waving sovereignty over areas in which men of many different units and countries took part and died in their millions\". I never got an impression of an impertinent claim of sovereignty and would have been most embarrassed if I had. With the exception of that which adjoins the Villers Brettoneux Memorial, at no other Commonwealth Cemetary full of Australian dead was I able to see flags. To be honest, seeing the Aussie flag up there next to the Tricolour in Villers Brettoneux somehow helped me feel a little more connected to the whole tragic mess and to the men and boys who had come all the way from the other side of the planet just to die in a muddy field. So saying, if there was a convention against flags at all sites of remembrance on the Somme, I would quite understand and support it. As is, those which I did see caused me no distress and I don't feel that their presence necessarily would justify anyone adjudging that those represented have \"learnt little from the history they purport to honour\" Yours sincerely, John Stewart.\n\n[... and later on 18 Sep 2004...]\n\nDear Christopher, Thank you for your reply. It has got me thinking anew several months down the track from my Somme visit. I find myself confronted by a strange paradox at such sites: I understand as well as I am able, without personal experience such as your own in the Balkans, the wretched consequences which can arise from nationalism (or any number of other \"isms\"), and yet it is difficult not to be stirred by tales of bravery or sacrifice. I guess it comes down to drawing a line between commemoration and glorification and that's sometimes dangerous ground. From my own personal perspective, I cannot help but be moved to a kind of admiration when reading of deeds which were, in essence, pretty horrible things for anyone to be doing and when I look at a place such as PoziÃ¨res and, naturally, think of the Australians who died there I cannot help but feel things more intensely because they were from my country. But really, was it the same country? It was a very different Australia in a very different time. I found myself thinking very much of Australia while gazing at rows of cream headstones topped by the rising sun hatbadge Â– and I realise now that I was thinking of the land much more than I was the country. In a quiet cemetery surrounded by rolling farmland, I willed up images of beautiful coastlines, creeks and gumtrees for my sister-in-law's great uncle and told him \"It's still there, mate\". So, maybe we go to these places years afterward not even knowing exactly what we're going there for, and maybe that's how it should be. I found myself feeling that Â– if I was there at all Â– I had to connect to something. I confess to feeling proud of those men (though I guess I don't have any right to because that almost implies that I understand what they went through) and above all I realised that I mourned them. Obviously not in the same way their mates would have: as you say, \"They simply mourn their mates... as I mourn 86 of my fellow journalists... but not because of their nationality... merely because they/we shared terrible experiences together\". But I just felt how horribly we'd all lost something. Thanks again for your reply. All the best, John.\n\nFrom: Robert.Flanagan@[nospam]gstt.nhs.uk\n\nSubject: A Mavrogordato\n\nDate: 26 August, 2004 13:03:47 GMT+02:00\n\nTo: Editor@[nospam]christopherlong.co.uk\n\nHi, Just been given a copy of the St Thomas's Hospital Pharmacopoeia (Edition 1902, 2nd issue) with the above name in the front.

I am hoping that with your knowledge on this subject you could be of great help to me. I am researching some family history and I beleive that my uncle's father may have been one of the French men stationed at Carlton Gardens. My uncle's mother was conscripted to the Royal Air Force and posted to Fulham Palace where she operated balloons which prevented low level attacks. (Incidentally, he has a picture of her being presented to the then Queen!) His mother and father met at this time in approximately 1942-3 and the proximity of the two places seems too coincidental for Carlton Gardens not to be where his French father would have been posted. Is there any information you think may be of help in this? Are there any archives or lists of the French who were there at the time? Thanking you in advance, Yours sincerely, Mrs Verity Jones, Powys, Wales.\n\nFrom: suds91820@[nospam]starpower.net\n\nSubject: Dannreuther Family\n\nDate: 25 June, 2004 6:56:13 GMT+02:00\n\nTo: Editor@[nospam]christopherlong.co.uk\n\nHello! Are you, too, a Dannreuther? My name is Susan Dannreuther and I live in the state of Maryland, USA. I saw your site on the \"net\" and just want to say that I can fill in some of the missing data if you'd care to have it for your site. I am a great-niece of Edward Dannreuther, father of Hubert, Wolfram, Isolde, Tris, etc. Have met some of them, and was entertained at the Hastings home by Hubert & Janie in 1961. Great experience. My grandfather, Gustav Dannreuther, the brother of Edward, was a violinist & chose to return to the US after studying in Germany with Joachim for a year, whereas his brother Edward, pianist, chose to remain in Europe & settled in London, as you know. Please let me know if you'd like to update your site with some missing dates & places. I will fill in as best I can, except, of course, for grown children who are still living. Do you by any chance know of Roland Dannreuther? I saw a reference to a site regarding him also on the \"net\" (Google), but couldn't access it. Google's entry said that Roland is with the Dept. of Politics at the Univ. Of Edinburgh. Do you by any chance have an email address for that university? I'd like to contact him and learn how he is connected to the family. Thank you so much. Nice to 'meet' you!

Do you have any? Do you know anyone who might? In more detail: I'm Sameer Jain from the Federal Public Defender's office in San Jose. I'm working on a death penalty case here in the Northern District. Death penalty cases here involve a guilt phase and a penalty phase. Should the case get to the penalty phase (if our client is found guilty), the jury has the choice of life without parole or the death penalty. Our client, David Lin, was one of the \"boat people\" who emigrated from Vietnam in 1979. We're trying to find photos and film of the specific relocation camps they stayed in before coming to the U.S. He and his family stayed in the Leton, Ariaya (Ariya?), and Galang camps in 1979. Do you have any photos or film of those camps? Are you aware of any organizations, agencies, or individuals (news agencies, documentary-makers, etc.) who'd be able to get us this media? Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is for the penalty phase of the trial, so it is literally a matter of life and death. We can of course pay for any copying costs for the pictures and film. If needed, we can be called collect at (408) 291-7753. Thank you very much.

I also learnt yesterday from Anthea Ionides that her sister, Daphne, had had affairs amongst others with Noel Streatfeild, and was described as a 'flamboyant socialite'! It doesn't quite fit in with the aunt we knew and adored, as there was never a hint of anything like that, how times have moved on. I can fill in one or two blanks for you...

How interesting that you too had contact with Noel Streatfeild Â– it is spelt like that by the way! My husband, John's family also knew her in Eastbourne, where her father was vicar, small world. I was very interested to know you had Demetriadi cousins. A great family friend was Amelia Demetriadi, known to all as 'Muggins' who was married to William Rhodes Moorhouse in 1937 but widowed in 1940. She was my brother's godmother and she died last year in her late 80's. The R-H family had a house on Constantine (very apt name for us!) Bay in north Cornwall, where we spent 3 holidays during and after the war. John and I took the house again every year from 1977 till 2002, and were due to go last year till she died in April. I really miss not being able to go anymore although the house was in a very decrepid state, as Muggins hated anything new and merely patched up problems. She was a delightful lady, though very tough, and I really miss not hearing her lovely soft voice on the phone. I will gather names and dates on my children, nieces and nephews, find out Phil Crabill's birth date and send them to you in due course, and ,if I can, Evelyn Capel's birth date. I tried looking up Carnegy on the web and found a Carnegy Arbuthnot of Balnamoon, but I couldn't get anything as it seemed to be a Burke's Peerage site for subscribers, and I am a very incompetent on computers Â– and spelling I think!

I have in my possession a very old early miniature photographic album, which I bought some years ago in Belper where I live. It is the record of what must have been a powerful family (possibly involved in textiles from the sumptous dresses). The only clue as to its provenance is a small picture of a gravestone marking the death in march 1875 of James Hewetson, son of Henry and Clementina Hewetson. In three years I have not tracked where this grave might be, though I had some evidence that it might possibly even be in Melbourne Australia. Any clues from your Hewetson connections?

P. Vlasto of Athens. The catalogue of the collection was published in London in 1947. The vase was subsequently owned by 'Mrs Jean Serpieri', also of Athens. I cannot certainly identify either M. P. Vlasto or Mrs Serpieri in your geneology of the Chios Vlastos. Could 'Mrs Jean' have been Julie 'Diddie', spouse of Jean Baptiste Vlasto? And is it possible that M. P. Vlasto is Michael (Pantaleon) Vlasto? Or am I all wet? Thank you for any hints you can give me!\n\n[...and later on 2 Jun 2004...]\n\nDear Christopher; Thank you indeed, for your very helpful and thorough reply. I am delighted not to have been entirely mistaken. My question arose because I was shown (and photographed) the famous pot in the National Museum in Athens. The top authority on Greek theatrical pots wrote recently that it was \"not visible since before World War II and known now essentially from the often-reproduced drawing by Gillieron.\" So I scored a great coup and determined to write about it, because the pot is a key \"document\" in theatre history. Many errors and vaguenesses have crept into the literatur: viz, it is known as the \"Vlastos\" vase, but nobody seems to know who the collector was; or that he was more important as a coin collector. In 1968, the revised ed. of Pickard-Cambridge's Dramatic Festivals of Athens gives the present owner as 'Mrs Jean Sarpieri'. So Michael's name was unknown, or that this was his daughter, or... I wonder how it passed to the Museum--in 1988 I'm told, but I have asked Dr. Kostas, Director, for further details and will let you know what I learn. The Serpieri mine near Laurion in Attica yields \"Serpierite\" a beautiful blue crystal named for Didi's husband's grandfather Giovanni Battista, an Italian mining entrepreneur. Can Didi be alive? She'd be 101. If she and brother Pandely were the result of maternal hanky-panky, the dates show it took place awfully close to Michael's wedding to her mother--young Pandely was born 8 months after. Yet both kids took Michael's surname; both were christened with Vlasto family names (Didi/Penelope after her 'paternal' grandmother), and Didi inherited Michael's collection. Must have kept it for a while, too, since Ravel published the catalogue in 1947. And it took money--surely \"Daddy's\"--to be a tennis star at the Marseilles Tennis Club and win, not just the French open, but Olympic silver (1924)! At some point she sold off the collection, or much of it: the coins are found all over the market today, and seem to gain value from their Vlasto provenance. An eccentric collection, specializing in Tarantine coins. Pots too: there is a \"Vlasto Painter\" who did boring lekythoi. Michael owned at least 3. Your remarks on your family's reticence about their possessions no doubt explain why the theatrical pot was \"invisible\" since the 1930s: Michael died, left it to Didi, and she was probably not answering inquiries! The pot has been reconstructed from fragments. It was smashed long ago: the bits are worn, so when they were reassembled (when? by whom?) there were big cracks. The Gillieron drawing is \"imaginative\". Research in that quarter shows the he and his father before him \"reconstructed\" frescoes and the like for Evans at Knossos. A recent book suggests that Emile Gillieron pere may even have been a forger. This is certainly the most exciting research project I've ever done. Scholarly error, cuckoldry, mystery, minerals, tennis, secrets and skulduggery. I shall keep yopu posted about findings relevant to the Vlasto/Serpieri clan.\n\nFrom: villageinn@[nospam]execulink.com\n\nSubject: Teak Tables\n\nDate: 31 May, 2004 20:02:08 GMT+02:00\n\nTo: Editor@[nospam]ChristopherLong.co.uk\n\nHi, I am writing in response to a letter you recieved from .

They may enlighten the origin of 'Rika Agnidis and Alexander (Alec) Benachi. Please find some information concerning the family name: Agnidis (AgnidÃ¨s or AghnidÃ¨s). My name is Dimitri Haller-DaskalidÃ¨s, born in Belgium and living in Montreal, Canada. My grandparents, Prodromos DaskalidÃ¨s-RouchalidÃ¨s (1900-1964) and Efthalia KestekidÃ¨s-AghnidÃ¨s (1899-1979), left Constantinople in 1922 through Marseille to join their uncle Leonidas KestekidÃ¨s (1876-1954) in Belgium. Leonidas was a merchant born in Nigde (Cappadocia), at first in New York, USA (1893-1898), then in Paris (1898-1908) and he finally settled in Ghent, Belgium in 1903. Later, he opened a chain of tea rooms and pastry shops, today knows as Leonidas Belgian chocolate. His brother Dimitri, my great grandfather was his correspondent in Constantinople while a third brother Abraham was the correspondent in Brazil. The main trade was almonds, sweets, dry fruits, pistachios, hazelnuts and tobacco from Anatolia. My great grand mother, Maria AghnidÃ¨s married Dimitri KestekidÃ¨s. She was born in Nigde in a large plantation that belonged to her family since 1675 ( as far as we are able to trace it). She had moved to Constantinople after the local Turkish massacre of 1904 with her mother and all woman and children of the family where the family owns a house at the Phanar. The AghnidÃ¨s family roots are in Kayabashi, a suburb of Nigde (Vilayet of Konya), and where the original family plantation is located (1675). The last Turkish census in 1903 shows a Greek population of 42.000. The last AghnidÃ¨s who live in today's Istamboul is a dentist in his eighties. I know also that a few Agnidis live, since the population exchange, near Komotini (Thrace). That may help ZoÃƒÂ«. It is possible that Rika Agnidis was a cousin of Maria AghnidÃ¨s my great grandmother. Nigde is closet of Adana and at that time all sea merchant were Greeks. One of Maria's nephews, Apostolos AghnidÃ¨s, a tobacco merchant, was established in Finland in the 30s and his daughter Evry had married a Benaki in the 1960's in Athens. I remember also that my 1st cousin Paul Seiloglou had worked in one of their family resorts on the island of Kos near Chios on the summer of 1973 (Cyprus invasion). Three other well know AghnidÃ¨s this century are: 1) Nicholas (Prodromos) graduated from the imperial law school of Constantinople in 1909 who became professor at Columbia University (1883-1974). He publish in 1916 the famous ''Mohammedan theories of finance'', still used today by government and law school; 2) Elias P. AghnidÃ¨s (1904-1988) ,a prolific inventor including the massage shower. Elias AghnidÃ¨s foundation helps every year the Anatolian college in Thesaloniki ( an American college for young Greeks); 3) Ambassador Athanasios P. AghnidÃ¨s who was the ambassador of Greece in London during the second world war also assistant general secretary of the SocietÃ© des Nations and UN in Geneva. Athanasios wrote also a book about the Greek churches in Turkey. Nicholas was married and died in New York in 1984, Elias also in 1988. I met him several times. My last visit two weeks before he passed away he promised me all the documents on the family. Unfortunately I was never able to trace his estate. Athanasios lived the end of his life in Geneva with his sister. On another name in our family but on my grand father's side is Leonidas Kessisoglou 1st cousin of my grandfather (Prodromos DaskalidÃ¨s) who came in Belgium from Constantinople in the late 1950's. His family came indeed from Smyrna. My great grandfather's roots are more in Cappadocia (Kaysery) but his wife's roots are from Smyrna (RouchalidÃ¨s) and her sister was married to a Kessisoglou. I hope that this may help you in your research. If you know anything or hear anything about some lost 'cousins' let me know. It is so exciting to see that all this Hellenes society has not completely disappeared like the monthly newspaper from Paris L'indÃ©pendance Anexatisia that I was reading while a child. I am sure that you may find more information at the patriarchate Stin Polli.

He claimed to be the natural son of a dead Belgian MI9 agent named Dominique Potier. Could I tell him anything about his father. I had a few references to Potier in the literature Â– Neave and Verity for instance Â– but nothing very useful. I asked some friends and fellow researchers what they knew about Potier and the answers that came back suggested he had been a very special man...\"\n\nWonderful research, BTW. Do you have any recollection of Robert Vanier's SOE activities? Dana Vanier.\n\nFrom: patchwork@[nospam]shegale.freeserve.co.uk\n\nSubject: Demetriadi Medallions\n\nDate: 13 May, 2004 15:20:55 GMT+02:00\n\nTo: Editor@[nospam]ChristopherLong.co.uk\n\nI have a small medallion with beautifully enamelled initials CGD. The other side has Constantine G. Demetriadi around it. In the centre: Born 17th Feby.Baptised 24th April 1909. I would be interested to know if this is given from a church on someone's baptism and what the history of this person is. I am not Greek, but have found your website very interesting, I have many lovely Greek friends in America, the lovely Demus Family. I am sure you are very busy, so I shall understand if you cannot find the time to answer this question. Sheila Gale [Mrs]\n\n[... and later on 2 Jun 2004...]\n\nChristopher, Thank you so much for taking an interest in the medallion, which has now become medallions. Let me give you a brief rundown on events. The first one was bought at Wimborne, Dorset, the second two at Matchums, near Ringwood, Hampshire,and the fourth one at Parley, near Bournemouth airport. All of these places are car bootsales. The last one came with another Greek medallion with various Greek letters which I cannot produce on this keyboard, I will have a group photo taken for you... they all originally came from the same 'dealer', all on a silver jump ring and a small broken chain. We will try and find out how he came to get them, probably from auction or a bootsale like us. But how they came to be there is an interesting mystery. Thank you for the absolutely lovely picture of the two brothers, they look so happy. It's sad to think he died in a riding accident, but maybe he was doing the thing he liked best...\n\nFrom: john.baillie@[nospam]sgcib.com\n\nSubject: Please remove yourself\n\nDate: 11 May, 2004 11:28:38 GMT+02:00\n\nTo: Editor@[nospam]christopherlong.co.uk\n\nDear Mr Long, A Google search for Laverock School brings Chrisopher A.

We have some scenes involving MI9 agents and offices and therefore would like to reproduce some kind of ID card or papers for a couple of the characters. As I assumed, it is quite difficult to source what such papers would look like, until i clicked onto your website and noticed the thumbnails. Is there any possibility of me seeing larger versions of the papers that you have, purely as reference, in order to mock up something that looks correct. We are actually shooting on sunday, so if you could please reply as soon as you can I would be very obliged.

Boscainos pbosc@[nospam]panafonet.gr\n\nTo: Editor@christopherlong.co.uk\n\nDear Mr. Long, I am a clinical hip fellow in the department of Orthopaedics at Guy's Hospital. Being of Greek origin and an orthopaedic surgeon, I was aware of the work of Constantine Lambrinudi in foot surgery but never really aware that he has been a consultant and a clinical director at Guy's Hospital in London. Having been appointed as a hip fellow 6 months ago, I have learned of his service at Guy's and also have gone through his transcripts of papers, biography notes and also obituaries. Certain aspects of his work as well as the fact that he was a clinical director in a prominent teaching hospital in London are not well known in Greece. I am willing to prepare a historic note of his life and work for the Journal of the Orthopaedic Association in Greece, Acta Orthopaedica Hellenica. By doing an internet search I was fortunate to come across too your elaborate and splendid genealogy charts. If you have any information or contact suggestions on Constantine Lambrinudi that you would like to share for this historic article, I would be delighted to include them and also cite them. Yours sincerely, Petros Boscainos, M.D. Clinical Hip Fellow, Department of Orthopaedics, Guy's Hospital, London.\n\nSubject: Hypatia Rodocanachi\n\nDate: 10 April, 2004\n\nFrom: Andrew Lewis a.d.e.lewis@[nospam]ucl.ac.uk\n\nTo: Editor@christopherlong.co.uk\n\nDear Mr Long, As part of continuing work on the history of the church at St Endellion, North Cornwall I have come across Hypatia Rodocanachi, said to have settled as a local artist here in the early part of the twentieth century. It seems likely that she is the Hypatia, great-great-granddaughter of Michael Rodocanachi, b. 1872 and listed on your genealogy. Local information has it that Hypatia paid for the restoration of the interior of the church carried out in the period 1937-39: she herself contributing some carvings on pew-ends identified as her work by an HR monogram and a flower of uncertain species. In addition there is a bas-relief signed by her on a wall in the church. I write in the hope that you may be able to confirm the identification I propose. I should be delighted if you had any other information to add.

Some time ago, I became friends with Mrs. Britton, who attended the Yokohama International School with Heather Blundell many years ago (1935, I believe). The Yokohama International School celebrated its 75th anniversary in 1997, and there was an effort to contact as many alumni as possible. At the time, Mrs. Britton wondered if it would be possible to find Heather Blundell through the Internet, but I was rather busy with other aspects of the celebration, and put off investigating whether I would be able to find her. In my spring cleaning just now, I came upon the paper where I had written Heather Blundell Croil's name, and was surprised to find her name appear on the website. Would you be so kind as to tell me if this could be the same woman who lived in Japan so long ago, and if she would be interested in contacting her old friend? Thank you, Diane Takao.\n\nSubject: George Zarifi\n\nDate: 29 March, 2004\n\nFrom: Mert Soyluoglu soyluoglu@[nospam]ttnet.net.tr\n\nTo: Editor@ChristopherLong.co.uk\n\nHello Mr. Long, I came across your web site while I was reading about the late Ottoman financial history, and conducting some Google search on specific names, one of them being George Zarifi (grandson). I just wanted to express my appreciations on your detailed genealogy. Since Greek and Albanian history are also on my long term reading list, I will surely visit your site again.

My father, who was in the British Army, fought in the Greek Civil War and was decorated accordingly by the Greek king. While there, he had Charles Yossifoglou as his interpreter, and they became good friends. I am sorry to read from your website that he is now dead, but it would appear that his widow, Nora, may still be alive Â– even though they may have been divorced. She would certainly remember my parents, if she is still active mentally at her advanced age. I know that they settled in New York after WWll. I note that you are related to the Zarifi side of the family, therefore I am hoping that you may know the whereabouts of any of the 3 daughters Â– or even their mother. I can provide you with any other bona fides references, should you so wish. I live in Henley-on-Thames. Thanking you in anticipation and regards from Michael Carlton.\n\nSubject: Rodocanachi Genealogy\n\nFrom: Ernest J. Balladur dallab@[nospam]webtv.net\n\nDate: 28 March, 2004\n\nTo: Editor@christopherlong.co.uk\n\nGreetings from Yakima, Washington State USA. I received your contact information from a Christina Vlachos Edwards in Flushing N.Y. I was born in New York, the 16th of October 1922. My parents were born in Smyrna (Izmir, Turkey). The Balladur's (armeno-catholics) originated in Persia and like other Christians suffered persecutions in the 1700s, during the Persian Wars, which led to many fleeing to Smyrna. They prospered and became connected by a bewildering sequence of marriages to a great number of Latin families established there. Because of that I find myself related to more than half the families in Smyrna. I have been working on my genealogy for a few years to fill some gaps and your site led me to contact you. Our ancestor, Jacob (Agop) Balladur (1731-1812) had 4 sons. One of his grand-sons Â– Pierre Â– married a Hypathia Rodocanachi. Unfortunately I could not find any dates of birth, marriage or death in the existing registers of St. Polycarpe in Smyrna. Could there be a connection with Hypathia Rodocanachi [not this Hypatia Â– CAL] and the family you mention at length in your documentation? Any information will be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Ernest J. Balladur.\n\nSubject: Lady Ralli\n\nDate: 26 March, 2004\n\nFrom: Dolores Mulkerrins dolores@[nospam]metafore.com\n\nTo: Editor@christopherlong.co.uk\n\nHi Christopher, I am the purchaser of a beautiful hand made cream satin dressing-gown with a fleur-de-lys pattern and hand-made buttons with a silk lining. It would fit a very slim figure. It has short sleeves, a fitted bodice from which flows a floor-length skirt. It is in a box marked with an address label: 'Bradleys Cold Storage for Furs, Chepstow Place London W2' which lists prices in shillings and pence. The address label states: 'Lady Ralli, Flat 47 3, Grosvenor Square [London] W1', but is undated. I sought some information on the internet and came across your website. I wonder if there are any Rallis still around who would know who owned this beautiful garment. There is a portrait of a very tiny waisted woman on your site and it could certainly have fitted her perfectly. I would be thrilled if you can help trace the wearer of the dressing gown. Dolores Mulkerrins.

Other things I know about him are that he was born on 1st October 1908, and that he was shot in the throat whilst escaping from a camp, and subsequently spoke with a very strange growl! Thank you.

Petrocochino\n\nDate: 17 March, 2004\n\nFrom: Brian & Amanda Williams bkw@[nospam]swiftdsl.com.au\n\nR> To: Editor@christopherlong.co.uk\n\nDear Christopher, I am writing to you as I have found something which may be of interest to you regarding one of your descendants mentioned in your web page Descendants of Loucas Petrocochino. I have a reference written by S. D. Petrocochino, dated Jan. 3rd 1905, for my paternal grandmother, a Mrs Hall, who was a children's nurse. She apparently accompanied the [Petrocochino] family to London from Calcutta and was glowingly referred to in the letter. It is written on a sheet of note paper, headed 'The Heathlands, Prestwich, Nr Manchester'. Given that Stephen (Demetrius) Petrocochino was an India trader and his wife, Anna, was buried in the cemetery at Prestwich, I think I'm correct in assuming that this is indeed written by the said ancestor. I am researching (with difficulty) my father's family and on a whim, typed the name Petrocochino, from the letter into a search engine and came across your site. This Mrs Minnie Graves Hall, who was a widow, married my grandfather, Edward D'Abreu and worked as a matron at Victoria School, Kurseong. She had two sons and died sometime in the 1920's. She was buried at Patna. Anyway I thought you might be interested in seeing this very neatly written letter, which I have scanned. If it is of interest to you, please contact me and I will email it to you. Regards.

I'm just about to start researching a dissertation which is due in on September the 12th 2004. The topic I have decided to write on is Allied escape and evasion through the Pyrenees during the WWll but focusing on the Spanish side of it, mainly due to the fact that I am Spanish and secondly because I have discovered that the Pat O'Leary route went through Esterri d'Aneu which is where I live and that the prison there (in Sort, another nearby village) holds many archives which still have to be researched. Searching the internet I came upon your webpage and was extremely impressed by the immense amount of information you have regarding the topic. Hence, that is why I am writing to you. To see if there would be any possibility of asking for your help on where the best places for information would be both here in England and in Spain. I have found that my library here is not very helpful although I have managed to purchase, second hand, a couple of books but M.R.D. Foot and Ian Dear. I was just wondering where I could find a copy of the London Portrait Magazine for which you wrote an article and any MI9 archives or documents which are available for public viewing. Any help would be much appreciated. It's such a large topic that I really am slightly lost as to where to begin. Sorry for any inconvenience and thank you in advance for your help and time. Yours Sincerely, Luisa.\n\nSubject: Chios Family History\n\nDate: 14 March, 2004\n\nFrom: William Zalick william.p.zalick@[nospam]btinternet.com\n\nTo: Editor@christopherlong.co.uk\n\nMr Long, My grandfather was born in Chios in 1884. His father, from what I understand, had the surname of Pappas. His mother was a Tsalikis. The Tsalikis, it is said, were land-owners, owned a village and church, etc. Anyway, my great-grandfather Pappas left the family. My great-grandmother took on (and so too her children) her maiden name. My grandfather at the age of 14 years ran away to sea. That would be in 1898. His ship must have docked at Newport dock in Newport, Monmouth, for it was here he met my grandmother. She was a school girl. They married in 1905, he 21 years of age, she 18 years of age. He was naturalized, was given the name of Zalick. From the time he ran off to sea until the day he died he never returned to Chios. To shorten my story a little, my uncle George, through his Greek contacts, was told that there were no surviving relatives left in Chios, and as my grandfather Dimitri Tsalikis married outside of the Greek church, any estates were passed to the Greek crown. That was it as far as my late Uncle George was concerned. But to us remaining grand-children, great-grand-children, it leaves us in mid air as far as our roots are concerned. We are presently working on our family tree. Any help would be appreciated. Readin"
