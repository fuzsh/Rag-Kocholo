        "text": "Located in the midst of Izmir, Selçuk is home to the antique city of Ephesus, the largest archeological site in Turkey. Selçuk proudly houses one of the 7 ancient wonders of the world: the Temple of Artemis. One of the most amazing ruins in Ephesus is the huge amphitheatre with a seating capacity for 24,000 spectators and superb acoustic effects. The ruins also include a gymnasium, agora and baths, as well as the Library of Celsus. The theatre still stages various domestic and international performances and concerts. Another very important place in Christian history is the House of Virgin Mary, the holy mother of Christianity, located at Bülbül hill.\n\nOne of the 7 ancient wonders of the world\n\nThe largest collection of Roman ruins\n\nEasy access from Adnan Menderes Airport\n\nFavorite international and local tourist attraction\n\nOne of the popular Izmir tourist attractions is the Agora, located in Smyrna. Agora lies in the foothills of Izmir. Agora was the celebrated market place of old Smyrna. Agora has a wide open space. It is said that Agora was built during the reign of Alexander the Great.\n\nYou can see the remains of the Agora which has been beautifully preserved. Smyrna, the ancient Greek city that is now Izmir, is steeped in history as far back as 3,000 B.C. While the Agora is certainly not that old, it's still very interesting to see.\n\nThe Agora was a marketplace that served Smyrna and was built during the reign of Alexander the Great, or around the 4th century B.C. Destroyed by an earthquake, the Agora was rebuilt in 178 A.D. by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius.\n\nOne of the popular tourist attractions\n\nAncient city\n\nWithin walking distance of the hotel\n\nAsansör, is a historical building in Izmir's Karataş quarter. It was built in 1907 as a work of public service by a wealthy Jewish banker and trader of that period, Nesim Levi Bayraklıoğlu, in order to ease passage from the narrow coastline of Karataş to the hillside, the elevator within the building serving to carry people and goods through the steep cliff between the two parts of the quarter. In time, the small street that led to the building also came to be known under the same name, Asansör Street (Asansör Sokağı). In the 1940s, one of the residents of the street was the singer Dario Moreno, who was to attain fame later. It was recently restored and since then, became one of the landmarks of İzmir. The street was renamed Dario Moreno Street in memory of the singer. Currently, top of Asansör is one of the most famous restaurants in Izmir.\n\nThe Wild Life Park, one of Europe's largest natural wildlife parks on 425,000 square metres of land, is home to 1,500 free-roaming animals from 120 species. These species include lions, tigers, pumas, African antelopes, monkeys, bears, zebras, horses, swans, rabbits, dogs and more.\n\nThere is a special garden where children can ride horses or visit them in their barns. There are also recreational areas for parents who want to enjoy the park along with their children, and an 8,450-square-metre pond at the park's entrance."
