Namely, Balladur was born in the Armenian Catholic family in the city of Izmir in Turkey. The Greeks call this historically important city on the Mediterranean Sea Smyrna, and according to traditional interpretations, the famous Homer was born in its vicinity. Izmir is today the third-largest city in Turkey, immediately after Istanbul and the capital, Ankara.\n\nÉdouard Balladur moved with his family from Turkey to France as a boy of only four or five years. Actually, quite a number of ethnic Armenians became famous in France. Let us mention the famous singer Charles Aznavour, who was born as Shahnour Vaghenag Aznavourian, of Armenian parents who were also from the city of Izmir in Turkey. Furthermore, the famous French Formula 1 driver – Alain Prost – is also of Armenian descent. Interestingly, the Armenian Catholic Church recognizes the pope as its head, although it has specific rituals.\n\nBalladur became the French Prime Minister in 1993. Many famous politicians sat in his cabinet. For example, Nicolas Sarkozy was his Minister of Budget, Simone Veil was his Minister of Social Affairs and Health, and future Prime Minister Francois Fillon was Minister of National Education."
