        "text": "The choice of Edouard Balladur to be France's prime minister was widely welcomed at home and abroad because his economic competence and smooth, almost unctuous manner offer hope for a country mired in political infighting and economic stagnation.\n\nMr. Balladur, accepting the post, said France was suffering from a crisis of confidence and promised a policy of \"reconstruction.\"\n\nIt was a characteristically muted phrasing of conservatives' claim that France had gone adrift, mainly because of a failure to grasp the economic and psychological consequences of reunification in Germany, France's powerful neighbor.\n\nEven if that analysis is right, it may not answer France's problems. The country is gripped by unemployment and social tensions aggravated by uncertainties about France's place in Europe.\n\nIn tackling this, Mr. Balladur has no worries from the minuscule leftist opposition in Parliament, but he has to perform a balancing act between conservative factions - a fact reflected in the cabinet named Tuesday and drawn almost evenly from the two main factions.\n\nFor example, the new foreign minister, Alain Juppé, head of Jacques Chirac's Gaullist party, while the defense minister, François Léotard, is a prominent disciple of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, who leads the center-right grouping.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
