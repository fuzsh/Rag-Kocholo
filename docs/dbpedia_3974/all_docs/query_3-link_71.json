        "text": "The Agora of Smyrna, located in modern-day Izmir, Turkey, was once the commercial center of the city. The word Agora means gathering place, and it was used as a meeting and marketplace during the Greek & Roman times.\n\nToday, the Agora is an open-air museum with many marble statues and columns. It is located in the middle of Izmir's city center, creating a sense of entering a parallel world compared to other modern buildings around.\n\nIt is the perfect place to visit when you have a busy schedule and are short on time, as you can see everything in Agora in just under an hour. Plus, its central location makes it an easy spot to travel with public transportation.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Agora of Smyrna was originally built by the Greeks in the 4th Century BC (following the reign of Alexander the Great) but was destroyed after an earthquake in 178 AD. Though it was rebuilt under the command of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelias, it eventually declined around the 7th Century AD.\n\nIt was used as a cemetery during the Byzantine and Ottoman areas and was one of the first excavations performed in Turkey in 1933, shortly after the founding of the Turkish Republic.\n\nNotable features of Smyrna Agora include basilicas, wall engravings (graffiti), which give a glimpse at life during the Roman period, and its ancient waterways. Two of these ancient water trenches are still in use.\n\nVisiting Information\n\nSmyrna Agora, part of the historic port city of Izmir, was placed on UNESCO's Tentative World Heritage List in 2020. You can visit this remarkable site seven days a week, between 8:30 and 19:00 during summer and 8:30 to 17:30 in winter. Keep in mind the box office closes one hour before the closing time.\n\nThe museum card is valid to use in Agora, and you can get it at the box office when you visit or pay the small entrance fee. See the museum's official site for updated ticketing info.\n\nTransportation to Agora\n\nTraveling to Agora is quite simple compared to other historic sites in Izmir, as it is located at the center of Izmir. Using the metro line, you can get off at Çankaya and Konak stations to get to Agora. It takes only 10 minutes from the Çankaya metro stop and 15 minutes walking distance from the Konak metro stop. However, choosing the Konak metro stop can be more advantageous, as you can glimpse the famous Konak Square and Izmir Clock Tower on your way.\n\nYou can also use the buses with route numbers 10, 157, and 253, leaving from major points in Izmir, and ferries to get to Konak Square and walk to Agora in just under 15 minutes.\n\nNearby Attractions\n\nThe Agora has a central place in the city. It is located near the attractions of Kadifekale Castle, the Izmir Clock Tower, and Kemeralti Bazaar (Marketplace), as well as other popular spots in Izmir. Let's look at the other attractions near Agora:\n\nKordon: Kordon is the popular waterfront promenade that stretches over 2 km of greenery and the lovely scenery of the Aegean Sea. Most people gather here to sit on the grass and share conversations across the scenery.\n\nKadifekale Castle: You can get to this ancient castle to see Izmir under your feet and have a bird's-eye view of Agora.\n\nIzmir Clock Tower: This remarkable structure has become the symbol of Izmir for a long time, located in the famous Konak Square.\n\nKemeralti Bazaar (Marketplace): The famous bazaar of Izmir, serving traditional goods and products with a beautiful tavern called Kızlarağası Hanı.\n\nKonak Pier: Designed by renowned French architect Gustave Eiffel, this popular shopping center is a great place to take a break and enjoy lunch after visiting Agora.\n\nIzmir Historical Asansör Building: The Historical Asansör of Izmir, with a breathtaking panoramic view of Izmir, is also located near Agora.\n\nMask Museum: The Mask Museum of Izmir is another destination travelers can visit after visiting Agora."
