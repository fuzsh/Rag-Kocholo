        "text": "In For a Union of the West between Europe and the United States (Hoover Press, 2009) Edouard Balladur, former prime minister of France, states that, as objects of growing hostility from the rest of the world, “Europe and America have yet to understand that, for the most part, the dangers that threaten them are the same. They must present a united front.” Balladur argues convincingly that Europe and America must come together in a true economic, political, and moral union if they are to preserve the positive roles of Western civilization in today’s changing world.\n\nBalladur offers concrete measures for bringing the United States and Europe closer together, including a more stable international monetary system and a transatlantic common market. He asserts that no matter what the issue—energy supplies, the environment, or the fight against terrorism—the bond between Europe and the United State must be indivisible if they are to maintain their influence.\n\nBalladur, prime minister of France from 1993 to 1995, in the 1980s brought about extensive market reforms as minister of the economy. A leader within the Gaullist movement for many decades, he is credited with bringing mainstream French Gaullists back into a pro–European Union stance and abandoning anti-American attitudes.\n\nThis American edition is published with the cooperation and permission of the author and Librairie Arthème Fayard.\n\nTranslation by Jessica Abreu and Ira Straus, with Tiziana Stella, Ani Gevorkian, and Laura Gerhardt of the Streit Council for a Union of Democracies. Special thanks to the Streit Council for its assistance in making this book possible.\n\nPublication in the United States was made possible by the support of Howard H. Leach, former U.S. ambassador to France, 2001–5.\n\nFor a Union of the West between Europe and the United States,\n\nby Edouard Balladur"
