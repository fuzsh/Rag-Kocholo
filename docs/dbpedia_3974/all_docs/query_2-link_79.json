        "text": "This image could have imperfections as itâ€™s either historical or reportage.\n\nJan 01, 1987 - Paris, France - After serving 18 years as the mayor of Paris, JACQUES CHIRAC was elected president of France in 1995 to succeed Francois Mitterrand. He held various high level government posts and elected offices throughout his career, including two terms as prime minister. As president he weathered criticism for inaction on domestic policies, for flip-flopping on matters of foreign policy and for his connections to political scandals involving fraud and corruption. His popularity at home surged when he strongly opposed George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003, but dissatisfaction with his domestic policies eventually took their toll and by 2006 his support had dwindled; Chirac announced in March of 2007 that he would not seek a third term.
