        "text": "What is it? A gem of a town in rural Izmir.\n\nWhy go? A quirky historical fact about Şirince is that it used to be called “Çirkince”, meaning “ugly”, as an attempt to ward off visitors from disrupting the peace in the village. Tucked away in the picturesque hills of the Izmir province, Şirince is anything but ugly. The village flaunts a gorgeous assembly of old greek houses stacked along windy, cobbled lanes while being surrounded by lush greenery on all sides. Popular media knows Şirince as the only place on earth which was prophesied to survive doomsday in 2012, which, fortunately we all came through unscathed. What it should be known for however is its wine houses and open market bazaar, historic churches and breathtaking natural beauty. Şirince is also home to the Nesin Mathematics Village and the Theatre Medrese.\n\nDon't miss: Go jewellery shopping for Zultanite; a rare, local gemstone that changes colour in the light.\n\nWhat is it? Back in its heyday during the Ottoman era, the Kızlarağası inn served to accommodate travelers and merchants visiting or passing through Izmir. Today, the two-storey building operates as a popular tourist attraction with its various shops and cafes.\n\nWhy go? Wander through the arched corridors of the Kızlarağası Inn where you’ll find colourful shops stacked beside one another, selling everything from precious jewellery and silk garments to souvenirs and handicrafts.\n\nDon’t miss: Take a breather between all the haggling with an energizing cup of traditional Turkish coffee in the upstairs terrace overlooking the courtyard.\n\nWhat is it? Built in 1907, Asansör is a historical landmark which was constructed to connect the coastal Karataş quarter with the hilltop neighbourhoods of the city.\n\nWhy go? Take a free lift up to the observation terrace of Asansör to encounter stunning panoramic views of the city down below. We highly recommend planning your visit in time for the sunset, when the views are at their most beautiful. If you’re in need of a little pick-me-up before heading to the next stop on your list, recharge your batteries at the cafe or restaurant located up top.\n\nDon't miss: Our favourite route to Asansör is via the charming Dario Moreno street; a cobblestone alley lined with old Greek houses and colourful eateries.\n\nWhat is it? An iconic seafront promenade in downtown Izmir.\n\nWhy go? Stretching along the picturesque Aegean coast, Kordon provides an ideal setting for leisurely activities and relaxing moments by the sea. Breathe in the fresh, salty sea air as you stroll down the 2-kilometre long promenade, and unwind at one of the many cafes or bars dotted along the way as you admire the magnificent views that lie before you. For a kick of culture, be sure to stop by at some fantastic museums located on Kordon, like the Zübeyde Hanım Maritime Museum, Arkas Arts Centre or the Atatürk Museum.\n\nDon't miss: Indulge in a seafood feast at the nearby Veli Usta restaurant.\n\nWhat is it? Meet Pergamon, a lesser-known yet equally enchanting ancient city compared to its more popular counterpart, Ephesus.\n\nWhy go? Situated in the district of Bergama north of Izmir, the acropolis of Pergamon stands as one of the most spellbinding ancient sites you can visit in the entire country. The citadel grounds are home to a wealth of extraordinary structures like the massive marble columns of the Temple of Trajan or the magnificent, 10.000-cap theatre regarded as the steepest in the world.\n\nDon’t miss: If you don’t mind the exercise, we recommend hiking up to this hill-top ancient city instead of opting for the cable car. Explore hidden gems like the gymnasium, residential houses, and other sanctuaries in the lower altitudes of Pergamon, that might otherwise go unnoticed. Before heading up, consider paying a visit to the Bergama Museum in downtown Bergama to gain a better understanding of Pergamon’s rich history.\n\nWhat is it? One of the largest ancient markets in the city built during the Hellenistic era of Greek-occupied Izmir, formerly known as Smyrna.\n\nWhy go? If you’re looking for an archaeological site even closer to the city than Pergamon, the Agora Open Air Museum is located slap-bang in the middle of town. Originally built to serve as a gathering place for business, social and political activities, the Agora Open Air Museum showcases the remnants of an ancient marketplace that once thrived with commerce and culture. The site boasts rows of ancient columns and archways as well as a basilica that contains some fascinating ancient graffiti.\n\nDon't miss: Quench your thirst by drinking right out of the miraculously functional, 2.000 year old water trench found on-site.\n\nWhat is it? An old Ionian town in Çeşme, Izmir’s sun-kissed western peninsula.\n\nWhy go? After being greeted by massive, historic windmills at the entrance of the town, you can start exploring Alaçatı’s colourful cobble-stone streets lined with stone houses wrapped in bougainvillea, cute little boutiques, lively bars, and chic cafes and restaurants. Shop for souvenirs, indulge in a delicious meal and ramble around town some more with your favourite scoop of ice-cream in hand.\n\nDon't miss: Put your bargaining hat on at the famous Alaçatı Bazaar where you can find everything from jewellery and clothing to handmade jams and delicious fresh produce, open every Saturday.\n\nWhat is it? One of the most popular windsurfing destinations in Europe.\n\nWhy go? The wind-swept, shallow shores of Alaçatı make it the perfect spot for windsurfing. The bay attracts flocks of water sports enthusiasts each year, and has even hosted numerous PWA World Windsurfing Tour events. Although there are many highly-rated schools to choose from, Myga Surf City stands out as our favourite, especially for first time learners. So wetsuit up, grab your board and slather on a generous amount of sunscreen for an epic day spent cruising the Aegean.\n\nDon't miss: If you think windsurfing isn’t quite your calling, try your hand at kitesurfing instead.\n\nWhat is it? A town 10 km’s away from the city centre with a rich history spanning over 5,000 years.\n\nWhy go? The picturesque Birgi village is steeped in the echoes of ancient history, having been home to countless civilizations including the Lydians, Persians, Greeks, Romans and finally the Ottomans. Birgi once thrived as a bustling trade hub along the Silk Road and continues to stand as a prominent centre for silk production today. Traditional Turkish architecture takes centre stage in Birgi, where the village streets are adorned with well-preserved local houses, grand mansions and mosques of the Seljuk and Ottoman eras, set against a backdrop of centuries-old sycamore trees.\n\nDon't miss: Purchase some of the area’s famous woven silk products.\n\nWhat is it? A white-sand beach in Çeşme, famous for its thermal waters.\n\nWhy go? Don’t get us wrong, Çeşme beach clubs are great, but admittance can often cost a pretty penny. Not only is Ilıca beach arguably one of the most stunning beaches in the country, but swimming in its crystal-clear, temperate waters won’t cost you a thing as entrance is free of charge.\n\nDon't miss: If you stick around long enough to watch the day turn into night, you may be lucky enough to witness a magical sighting of bioluminescent planktons shimmering along the shoreline."
