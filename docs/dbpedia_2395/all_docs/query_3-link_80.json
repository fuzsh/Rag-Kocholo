        "text": "The Academy Gallery\n\nThe Academy Gallery in Florence is - after the Uffizi Gallery - the most famous museum in Italy. It displays the largest number of statues by the famous Italian Renaissance artist \"Michelangelo\". First of all the David (1501), symbol of Florence in the world and the masterpiece of the Renaissance, brought inside the academy in 1873 to protect it from the bad weather.\n\nWith its beauty and strength, Michelangelo's David symbolizes the virtue and freedom of the Florentine Republic, embodied by Palazzo Vecchio, in front of which the statue was originally placed and where you can still find a copy of it today.\n\nThe San Lorenzo Market\n\nThe San Lorenzo Market is one of the key stops on the tour!\n\nWhether you are individual travelers, couples or families, the city's Oldest Market is the ideal place to discover the authentics Florentine flavors! Divided into two section: the ground floor where the real market takes place and the first floor which is a food courtyard where you can taste any specialty from all over Italy.\n\nOutside, however, you can stroll around the stands selling the most popular items in town: the leather!\n\nChurch of San Lorenzo\n\nLooking at the uncompleted facade of the church of San Lorenzo, it is almost difficult to believe that once, this church was the cathedral of Florence and that it was located outside the city walls!\n\nThe basilica claims the title of the oldest church in Florence and hosts many masterpieces of the majures artists and architects of the florentine panorama.\n\nMedici Chappels\n\nRight next to the Basilica, with a separate access, there are the Medici Chapels which hosts the tombs of 50 exponents of the noble Florentine family.\n\nThe complex includes the “New sacristy” that Michelangelo built to house the tombs of Lorenzo and Giuliano dei Medici, and the Cappella dei Principi, built from the beginning of the seventeenth century, as a mausoleum for the Medici.\n\nThis stop is unmissable!\n\nBasilica of Santa Maria Novella\n\nThe Basilica of Santa Maria Novella with its colored marbles, its elegant shape and the works of art it houses is one of the most important churches in Florence.The splendid facade in white and green marble was started in 1350, when the lower part in Romanesque style, while the upper part was completed only in 1470 by Leon Battista Alberti. It starts from the Trinità di Masaccio in 1424, the fresco with which the use of perspective was experimented for the first time, a peak of the Renaissance art, while at the end of the central nave stands the large Crucifix by Giotto from 1290, placed at a height of 4.5 meters, a splendid youthful work by the artist.\n\nThe Dome\n\nA only one large complex consisting of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, Brunelleschi's Dome, Giotto's Bell Tower, the Baptistery of San Giovanni, Santa Reparata and the museum of the Opera del Duomo. If you haven't visited this, you haven't seen Florence!\n\nThe experience to get up the dome designed by Brunelleschi is unique, beyond the beautiful view that can be enjoyed from its top. It is the largest dome in the world and following the path that carries to the panoramic terrace allows you to better understand its structure. It is a grandiose and mysterious work, truly one of humanity's most important masterpieces.\n\nSignoria Square\n\nPalazzo Vecchio, with its Arnolfo Tower, has always been the political symbol of the city of Florence, located in “Piazza della Signoria”.\n\nThe building was built on the ancient ruins of the Roman theater of Florentia, dated 1st century. AD, still visible along the walkway of the Palace.\n\nAt the time of Florence capital city of Italy (from 1865 to 1871), the building hosted the Italian Parliament and it represented for centuries the seat of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Medici Family.\n\nToday it is the headquarters and museum of the Municipality of Florence.\n\nUffizi Gallery\n\nVisiting the Uffizi Gallery, one of the largest collections of Italian painting in the world, will prove to be an incredible experience, which you can hardly forget. Even if you are not fanatic of art, in fact, you cannot fail to be impressed by the beauty kept inside!\n\nBasilica of Santa Croce\n\nThe Basilica of Santa Croce is the second largest religious building in Florence, after the Duomo, with its 115 meters long and 38 meters wide, although the interior of the Basilica of Santa Croce is not as spectacular as that of Santa Maria Novella (with exposed beams), the sculptures and paintings that decorate its walls have enormous artistic value. In the chapels you can see the frescoes of the great masters of the History of Art, such as Giotto, Brunelleschi and Donatello. Among the illustrious characters who rest in Santa Croce there are Galileo Galiei, Macchiavelli, Lorenzo Ghibertiand Michelangelo.\n\nPonte Vecchio\n\nDid you know that until 1218 the only bridge to cross the Arno? The bridge in its present form was built in 1345, after a violent flood destroyed the previous one and remained so even during the Second World War, when German troops destroyed all the other bridges in the city. The goldsmith shops present now once housed popular workshops, including beccai, ancient butchers, and vegetable growers because they could unload their waste directly in the Arno. Above, it is crossed by the Vasari Corridor, which connects Palazzo Vecchio with Palazzo Pitti.\n\nPalazzo Pitti\n\nA few steps from the Ponte Vecchio we are finally at Palazzo Pitti. At the time of construction around 1440, it was the largest and most imposing Renaissance private residence of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany in the city of Florence, with its richly decorated rooms and the splendid Boboli Gardens. It currently houses four different museums: the Treasury of the Grand Dukes, the Palatine Gallery, the Gallery of Modern Art and the Museum of Fashion and Costume. From inside it is possible to go directly to the Bardini Garden and Forte Belvedere, the Medici family fortress, a hidden gem!\n\nBoboli Gardens\n\nThe Boboli Gardens is a historical park in the city of Florence. Born as the Grand Ducal garden of Palazzo Pitti, it is also connected to the Forte di Belvedere, military outpost for the safety of the sovereign and his family. The garden is one of the most important examples of Italian garden in the world and is a real open-air museum, for its architectural-landscape setting and for the collection of sculptures, ranging from Roman antiquities to the twentieth century. The Boboli garden is one of the most famous gardens on the peninsula.\n\nSanto Spirito Church\n\nThe church of Santo Spirito is one of the main basilicas of the city of Florence. It is located in the Oltrarno district, the southern part of the historic center, and with its simple facade dominates the homonymous square. It was built on the remains of the thirteenth-century Augustinian convent destroyed by fire in 1371.\n\nPiazzale Michelangelo\n\nDesigned in 1869 by the Florentine architect Giuseppe Poggi, Piazzale Michelangelo offers a beautiful panoramic view of Florence and the Arno, and is certainly a mandatory stop for tourists and Florentines. Poggi built the square as a monument for the celebration of Michelangeloand his works, which were to be exhibited here, both the Daivid and the Medici sculptures in San Lorenzo."
