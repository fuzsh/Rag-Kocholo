        "text": "CHAPTER 3\n\nFerdinando Gonzaga and the Jesuits Create a University\n\nThe people and rulers of Mantua had wanted a university for some time. Although better known for their patronage of music and literature, dukes Guglielmo and Vincenzo I supported scholars and their research. Then Duke Ferdinando, who studied at a university and loved learning, decided to collaborate with the Jesuits to create a studium. The first fruit of their collaboration was the Public Academy of Mantua, the Jesuit part of the University of Mantua.\n\nI. UNIVERSITY DREAMS\n\nThe rulers and leading citizens of Mantua had long desired a university. The first step was to obtain a charter authorizing prince or commune to create an institution with all the privileges of established universities, including the authority to confer degrees recognized throughout Christendom. Legal tradition and common consent recognized emperors and popes as the supranational authorities who might charter universities.\n\nMarquis Gian Francesco Gonzaga (1395, ruled 1407–44) asked Emperor Sigismund I of Luxemburg (ruled 1410–37) for a university charter when the emperor visited Mantua, and the emperor responded with a university charter on September 27, 1433.1 Emperor Albert II (ruled 1438–39) confirmed the privileges of a possible Mantuan studium generale on January 1, 1439. So did Emperor Frederick III (ruled 1440–93) on December 21, 1442, and again on August 27, 1455. During a visit to Mantua, Emperor Charles V (ruled 1519–56) on November 24, 1531, conferred on the priors of the Augustinian monastery of Sant’Agnese of Mantua count palatine authority to award bachelor, licentiate, and doctoral degrees in all subjects. This was not a university charter but authority to award degrees outside a formal university structure.2\n\nA title and authority that originated in the early Middle Ages, a count palatine initially was someone delegated to act for the emperor, and later the pope, in two major legal areas, appointing notaries and legitimizing bastards. Moreover, once a man was appointed a count palatine, his direct legitimate male heirs inherited the office in perpetuity. By the fourteenth century, counts palatine were also awarding academic degrees. After the power of awarding academic degrees became part of a count palatine’s authority, emperors and popes increasingly made professors and quasi-academic bodies, such as colleges of doctors of law or medicine, counts palatine, especially in the sixteenth century. Like individuals, organizations also possessed count palatine authority in perpetuity.3 However, the monastery of Sant’ Agnere seldom, if ever, used its power to award degrees.\n\nThere was more to come. On January 1, 1539, Charles V issued another charter for a University of Mantua that would have the same privileges of conferring degrees and other rights as the universities of Paris, Bologna, Orleans, and Montpellier. A more unusual charter followed. In 1562 Cesare Gonzaga (1533, prince of Guastalla 1557–75) and a group of men from Mantua founded the Accademia degli Invaghiti. Like other academies of the time, it consisted of a group of local men, leavened by one or two scholars, who met periodically to discuss literary and philosophical ideas and to enjoy each other’s company. Then Duke Guglielmo Gonzaga in 1564 procured from Pope Pius IV the right of the academy to confer degrees in canon and civil law, medicine, and poetry, so long as professors found the candidates qualified.4 Although it was exceptional for a literary academy to enjoy the privilege of awarding degrees, it does not appear that it actually did so.\n\nUniversity charters and count palatine authority to award degrees signaled that prince and people would like to have a university, but they did not act. Creating a functioning university by recruiting professors to teach, finding the money to pay them, and attracting students was much more difficult. No Gonzaga marquis or duke attempted to create a university in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\n\n2. GONZAGA SUPPORT OF LEARNING\n\nGonzaga dukes and princes warmly supported learning, a prelude to an eventual university. This and their extensive personal contacts with professors have been somewhat overlooked amidst their much better-known musical and literary patronage. Gonzaga assistance to scholars and scholarship expanded in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries under Vincenzo I, an unexpected candidate for the role of patron of learning.\n\nIt began with humanistic schooling. In 1425 Marquis Gian Francesco Gonzaga brought the famous humanist pedagogue Vittorino Rambaldoni da Feltre (1373 or 1378–1446/47) to Mantua to teach his children and other court children, plus some poor students whom Vittorino sheltered. After Vittorino died, a succession of humanist pedagogues taught at the court school, or taught Gonzaga children, or did both.5 This was the pattern for young princes across Italy.\n\nA change occurred at the end of the fifteenth century, when some rulers chose university professors as tutors for their sons. These scholars combined tutoring with university lecturing, or they accepted tutorial positions before and between university teaching stints. For example, the Bentivoglio rulers of Bologna hired three distinguished humanists then teaching at the University of Bologna to tutor their sons, and possibly daughters, in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Lorenzo il Magnifico de’ Medici selected Angelo Poliziano to tutor his sons; Poliziano soon became a professor of rhetoric at the University of Florence.6\n\nThe Gonzaga did the same. In 1576 Duke Guglielmo Gonzaga arranged for Giuseppe Moletti of Messina (1531–88), an innovative mathematician who taught at the University of Padua from 1577 until his death, to tutor his son, Vincenzo. Moletti combined teaching at Padua and tutoring Vincenzo until 1582.7 Duke Guglielmo also hired the medical scholar and philosopher Gian Paolo Branca to tutor young Vincenzo. When Branca left in 1578 to become a professor of medicine at the University of Padua, Marcello Donato (1538–1602), medical scholar, philosopher, and humanist, came to teach Vincenzo in 1578 and settled in Mantua for the rest of his life. After he became duke, Vincenzo I hired Giovanni Antonio Magini, longtime professor of mathematics at the University of Bologna, to teach his sons Francesco and Ferdinando (see section 3 below). Friendships as boys with university professors meant that Gonzaga rulers felt comfortable as adults in professors’ company and were more appreciative of, and sympathetic to, university learning than might be expected from princes with many patronage and pleasure options.\n\nGonzaga rulers had contacts with the most famous scholars of the day. During a visit to Padua, Duke Vincenzo I heard Galileo Galilei explain the use of a military compass and was given one.8 Galilei also sent Duke Vincenzo I one of his telescopes and instructions for its use. In return, the duke gave Galilei a chain with a medallion bearing the image of Vincenzo, which Galilei assessed as worth 900 lire.9 Galilei also made at least two trips to Mantua. In a visit of April or May 1604 Vincenzo invited him to become his military architect at a salary of 300 ducats and expenses for himself and one servant. Galilei asked for 500 ducats and expenses for three persons, which price the duke declined to meet.10\n\nAnother beneficiary of the generosity of Vincenzo I was Gaspare Tagliacozzi (1545–99), professor of surgery and anatomy at the University of Bologna and a pioneering plastic surgeon. He dedicated his 1597 book, the first major work on plastic surgery, to Vincenzo I with comments about the latter’s generosity. Tagliacozzi also praised the Gonzaga as brave warriors who inflicted the kinds of wounds that he could heal with plastic surgery.11\n\nSelf-interest inspired some of the patronage of Vincenzo I. Because he spent lavishly and always needed more money, he supported a stable of alchemists who promised that they would produce gold for him. Not everyone approved. Duchess Eleonora de’ Medici tartly observed that if the duke would get rid of the alchemists, it would be good for his pocketbook and even better for his reputation.12 Vincenzo I supported several people at his court who claimed expertise in poisons and cures because he feared that the Farnese would poison him in revenge for the annulment of his marriage to Margherita Farnese.13 And he listened too eagerly to mountebanks. At one point he asked Galilei’s advice about a man who claimed to understand every secret of medicine and astrology. Rather than criticize the duke’s credulity directly, Galilei responded with another tall tale. He knew of a man who had invented a pill that would keep one healthy and vigorous for a whole month without food or drink!14\n\nThe Gonzaga nourished a surprisingly active Mantuan press willing and able to publish works of learning and literature. After it languished in the first forty years of the sixteenth century, the Gonzaga brought the Mantuan press back to life. Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga used tax concessions to entice a Venetian publisher, Venturino Ruffinelli, to come to Mantua in 1543. The results were instant and dramatic: from 1544 through 1630 Mantuan publishers produced at least 381 editions, an average of 4.4 editions per year, an impressive number for a small city.15 In 1588 Duke Vincenzo I named Francesco Osanna of Mantua, Ruffinelli’s major successor, as ducal printer and gave him further benefits. Osanna’s heirs continued to hold this title in the seventeenth century.\n\nThe Mantuan presses produced some works of great significance. After Duke Vincenzo secured the release of Torquato Tasso (1544–95) from a Ferrara prison, the restless poet lived intermittently in Mantua from 1586 until 1591. Francesco Osanna issued twenty-two editions of the poet’s works between 1581 and 1591, including the highly praised 1584 edition of Gerusalemme Liberata.16 Mantuan publishers also published at least ten medical works, all but one in the first thirty years of the seventeenth century.17 A press capable of publishing complex scholarly works in Latin was a desirable part of the infrastructure that might support a university.\n\nVincenzo I was not a philosopher-prince. A Venetian ambassador observed that he still looked youthful at forty-six because he had never given up the dissolute pleasures of youth.18 He loved hunting, he fathered bastards, and he killed a Scot in a street brawl in July 1582.19 Vincenzo I longed for military glory, as his three expeditions against the Turks in Hungary in 1595, 1597, and 1601 demonstrated. Despite all this, he continued the Gonzaga tradition of supporting musicians, poets, artists, and scholars, patronage that helped prepare the way for a university.\n\n3. THE EDUCATION OF FERDINANDO GONZAGA\n\nIf ever there was an Italian prince at ease in the university world, it was Ferdinando Gonzaga, the most intellectually gifted Italian ruler since Lorenzo de’ Medici (1449–94). Early association with the Jesuits and a tutor enthusiastic about astrology and alchemy helped form Ferdinando, while his studies at the universities of Ingolstadt and Pisa completed his education.\n\nThe future duke was born on April 26, 1587, the second son of Duke Vincenzo I and Eleonora de’ Medici.20 Ferdinando became well acquainted with the Mantuan Jesuits as a boy, because he and his brother Francesco, born a year earlier, often visited the Jesuit college. Ferdinando went to a Jesuit to make his first confession and, after preparing himself with the aid of Loyola’s Spiritual Exercises, made his first communion at about the age of nine. He and Francesco were pleased to receive holy pictures from the Jesuit fathers.21\n\nBecause he was the second son, his destiny was to serve his family in the church; because he was a Gonzaga, he would be a cardinal. So he needed to be educated appropriately. One early teacher was a local abbot; a more important one was Giovanni Antonio Magini (1555–1617). A university professor, Magini had a significant intellectual influence on Ferdinando over many years.\n\nBorn in Padua, Magini obtained a doctorate in arts at the University of Bologna in 1579, and in 1588 he won one of the two afternoon ordinary professorships of mathematics there, a position that the younger Galileo Galilei unsuccessfully sought. Magini held the position, in which he taught mathematics and astronomy, until his death.22 In his long and productive career, he corresponded with Johann Kepler and Tycho Brahe, and was both a friend and critic of Galilei. He published Novae coelestium orbium theoricae congruentes cum observationibus Nicolai Copernici (New theories of the celestial orbs agreeing with the observations of Copernicus) in 1589. Magini argued that Copernicus had devised hypotheses that fitted the positions of the stars and the planets very well. He praised Copernicus and wanted others to accept this part of the Copernican system. But he rejected heliocentrism as false and upsetting, and he feared that others would reject the good matter of Copernicus for this reason. So, he constructed his own heavenly system, which mixed together a good deal of Ptolemy, some Copernican elements, and his own complicated ideas. In short, Magini was well versed in the new astronomy of Copernicus and Galilei and accepted part of what they wrote but leaned toward a more conservative astronomy. His work was esteemed, possibly because it was a compromise. Magini also published several ephemerides (astronomical tables predicting the future positions of planets and stars), horoscopes, works on judicial astrology and medical astrology (using astrology to determine when medicines should be administered), and a commentary on the Geography of Ptolemy.23\n\nMagini had a long and close association with the Gonzaga. In 1589 he visited Mantua and the library of Vincenzo I, which was rich in scientific works and instruments. In 1592 he dedicated a book on trigonometry to Duke Vincenzo I. From that date onward, Magini spent every summer in Mantua, where he constructed scientific instruments and procured books in natural magic and medical alchemy for the duke. He also calculated through astrology the right moments for actions and offered prognostications. In 1605 he wrote for Duke Vincenzo I a little treatise on metroposcopy, divination of the character and destiny of a person on the basis of the wrinkles in his face and forehead. In 1608 he dedicated to Prince Francesco Gonzaga a summary of sixty regional maps of Italy, part of a large project to map all of Italy that he never finished.24\n\nBeginning in 1599, Magini taught mathematics to Ferdinando and Francesco, who were twelve and thirteen respectively, for about two years. He concentrated on the pseudo-Aristotelian Mechanics, a treatise on the practical use of mathematics, which was taught in universities.25 Magini continued to guide Ferdinando; for example, he advised Ferdinando on alchemical experiments when the latter set up a laboratory in Rome a few years later.\n\nMagini was a cautious Baroque polymath. While respectful of the new astronomy of Copernicus and Galilei, he tried to preserve much of Ptolemy. He followed Aristotle, and he limited himself, publicly at least, to the astrology that the Council of Trent authorized. Ferdinando’s eclectic interests and tendencies echoed Magini’s combination of versatility, boldness, and conservatism. Ferdinando as an amateur scholar liked to think of himself as multitalented and open to new ideas, while retaining a conservative core similar to that of the Jesuits.\n\nDuke Vincenzo I next sent young Ferdinando to the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria for the academic year 1601–02, because he wanted him to learn German. Ingolstadt at that time was a part-Jesuit university: Jesuits dominated arts and theology, while lay professors taught law and medicine. In particular, the Jesuits did the teaching in the paedagogium, the secondary school that prepared students for university studies. There students studied advanced Latin literature, Greek, poetry, and some dialectic and rhetoric.26 Ferdinando studied in the paedagogium, although he may have attended some university-level lectures as well. About 17.5 percent of the students at the university were nobles; Ferdinando was one of them, albeit more privileged and protected.27 He lived in a household with tutors and eight priests, received private instruction, and was expected to speak Latin there, while the rector of the Jesuit college at Ingolstadt heard his confessions. Nevertheless, he found time to play ball games and go sightseeing in Munich.28\n\nAfter one year at Ingolstadt, Ferdinando returned to Mantua for the latter half of 1602 and much of 1603, where he received more tutoring from Magini and probably others. In the fall of 1603 Ferdinando enrolled in the University of Pisa. He arrived at the age of sixteen and one-half, twelve to eighteen months younger than the average entering student, and remained through the first half of 1607. Very few princes in Italian ruling families enrolled in universities. Those who did were usually second sons intended for the church with the necessary intellectual capacity, which exactly described Ferdinando. But he did have one illustrious ancestor who was a university student and serious about learning. Ercole Gonzaga, already a bishop but not yet a cardinal, had attended the University of Bologna for two and one-half years, December 1522 through May 1525, leaving without a degree when his mentor and friend, the eminent philosopher Pietro Pomponazzi, died.29 After leaving Bologna, Ercole became a lifelong student who employed tutors and read widely, especially in humanistic studies, Scripture, and theology.30\n\nFerdinando wanted to study natural philosophy at Pisa.31 But his great-uncle Grand Duke Ferdinando I de’ Medici (1549, ruled 1587–1609), who oversaw his university career, insisted that he study law. It was conventional advice for a future prince of the church, because the vast majority of Italian popes, cardinals, papal diplomats, and bishops studied law rather than theology, if they attended a university. Grand Duke Ferdinando knew this because he had been a cardinal until his older brother died without male issue. He was then obliged to shed his cardinal’s robes, become ruler of Florence, and marry. Ferdinando Gonzaga bowed to the wishes of his great-uncle and studied law. But he also read natural philosophy as time allowed.\n\nLike most students, Ferdinando took the course in logic early in his university career, because it was considered necessary preparation for studies in both law and philosophy. He also attended lectures on the Institutes, the introductory course in civil law. Professor Giacomo Angeli di Barga (sometimes called Barga or Bargeo, d. 1609) taught him Institutes in 1603–04 and canon law in the academic year 1606–07, and possibly was Ferdinando’s legal mentor.32 Angeli approached jurisprudence humanistically to some extent, an approach that may have appealed to Ferdinando.\n\nLike other highborn and wealthy students, Ferdinando along with his tutors and minders organized a little academy for study, lectures, and informal disputations. Usually hosted by wealthy students, academies were limited to invited students, professors, and guests, and were a part of the network of private instruction that weakened the public lecture system of Italian universities at this time.33 Ferdinando’s academy met twice a week in his house.\n\nOn February 19, 1605, Ferdinando participated in an informal disputation in his house in the presence of Grand Duke Ferdinando I de’ Medici. For two hours he put forward twenty-two “ingenious” arguments in the process of defending six legal and six philosophical propositions against two other students and nine dottori.34 Ferdinando’s minders sent back to Duke Vincenzo I glowing accounts of his intellectual prowess and his fabulous memory. Naturally they were inclined to see the best in him. But other observers not in the employ of the Gonzaga made similar observations about Ferdinando’s intellect. And he continued to demonstrate wide-ranging curiosity. He applied to the Holy Office in Rome for permission to read Paracelsus (Theophrastus Philippus Aureolus Bombastus von Hohenheim, ca. 1493–1541), whose works were prohibited by the 1596 Index of Prohibited Books. The Holy Office denied his request in May 1606.35\n\nThe young prince did not spend all his time studying. Ferdinando hunted and fished. He was made a knight of St. John and was thrilled to take a short voyage on a warship. In the summer of 1606 he traveled to France to attend the wedding of his sister Margherita (1591–1632) to Henry, Duke of Lorraine. He spent the hot summers with his Medici relatives in Florence or visiting monasteries in cool rustic settings. And he developed a strong interest in the musical performances at the Florentine court. Ferdinando had enough musical and literary ability to compose music and verse for a ballet and a pastoral comedy, plus write occasional poetry.36 Music remained a lifelong passion, which he indulged by supporting musical performances at Mantua and writing some musical compositions after he became duke.\n\nFerdinando wanted a doctoral degree, but his advisers urged him not to get one for two reasons. First, it would be expensive. A new doctor was obliged to pay substantial fees to the members of the college of doctors who examined him, professors, university officials, and witnesses, as well as host a lavish banquet. As a prince, Ferdinando would have had to be very generous. Second and most important, it would be politically inappropriate. The 1544 statutes of the University of Pisa required all recipients of doctoral degrees to swear an oath of allegiance to the grand duke of Tuscany. While this oath probably meant little to most non-Tuscans, the son of the duke of Mantua could not swear fealty to the ruler of another state, even his friendly great uncle.37 Ferdinando did not get a doctorate.\n\nFerdinando returned to Mantua in June 1607, and Pope Paul V named him a cardinal on December 10, 1607, when Ferdinando was twenty years and seven months old. He was made a cardinal because the Gonzaga, like the Medici, the Este, and other ruling families of Italy, were so politically important that the papacy felt obliged to give them representation in the college of cardinals.38 However, rather than moving to Rome, Ferdinando remained in Mantua for the next two years, studying botany, composing madrigals, and organizing musical and dramatic events.\n\nFIG. 2.

As he entered the building, he found the atrium festooned with posters, imprese (iconographic illustrations), inscriptions, and compositions alluding to his merit and virtue. A Jesuit or a student recited a Latin oration in his praise. After Ferdinando dined in the college, some of the students from the school presented a drama, which Cardinal Ferdinando applauded.39 His respect and affection for the Jesuits was genuine. At some point in his youth, he had vowed to become a Jesuit, but his father obtained a release from the vow from the Sacred Penitentiary in Rome.40\n\nFerdinando finally took up residence in Rome in early 1610. The pope appointed him to the Congregation of Rites, which dealt with the liturgy and evaluated candidates for beatification and canonization. It was not the most important congregation in the Vatican, but it gave him the opportunity to urge the canonization of Blessed Luigi Gonzaga. He took the four minor orders, which did not involve the obligation of celibacy, and considered taking major orders (subdiaconate, diaconate, and priesthood), which did.41\n\nMost important, in Rome he had ample opportunity to pursue his many intellectual and artistic interests. He created a laboratory where he engaged in alchemical experiments under the guidance of Magini. He haunted the Vatican Library and spent hours in discussions with the scholars and notables who gathered there. Even after he became duke he continued to visit the Vatican Library when in Rome.42 He bought books and maintained an interest in natural philosophy. In 1610 he obtained a papal pardon for the painter Caravaggio, who had killed a man in Rome in 1606.43 He composed more music and lyrics, and he persuaded Andreana Basile (ca. 1580–after 1639), a famous Neapolitan contralto, to move to Mantua to join the other musicians there.44 All of this cost money. Even though he enjoyed an annual income estimated at 60,000 to 80,000 ducats, he spent all of it and more.45 He asked his father for additional funds to purchase a palace in Rome, but Duke Vincenzo I, a prodigious spendthrift in his own right, said no. So Ferdinando retreated to Mantua in early 1611, partly to avoid his creditors. Nevertheless, he purchased an unfinished villa in Frascati in 1612.\n\nFerdinando kept abreast of contemporary scientific matters. In May 1611 the Jesuits of the Province of Venice held a congregation (general meeting) in Mantua. Along with the congregation, the Mantua Jesuits organized some scholarly presentations. Two Jesuits came from Parma for a theological disputation, a famous Jesuit orator preached, and Cardinal Ferdinando arranged for a mathematical presentation by a “bravo” mathematician.46\n\nThe “bravo” mathematician was the Jesuit Giuseppe Biancani (1566–1624), the ablest mathematician and astronomer in the Venetian province, then teaching at the University of Parma. At Mantua he discussed the height of the mountains on the moon based on telescopic observations and mathematical calculations. Before long an anonymous summary of his presentation appeared: “De lunarium montium altitudine problema mathematicum ter habitum Mantuae, in templo Sanctissimae Trinitatis, in nostra aula coram serenissimo duce et in cubiculo coram illustrissimo Cardinali Gonzaga” (Mathematical problem of the height of the mountains of the moon presented at Mantua three times, in the church of the Most Holy Trinity, in our hall in the presence of the most serene duke, and in the bedroom [or private room] in the presence of the most illustrious Cardinal Gonzaga.).47 The private session for Ferdinando demonstrated, once again, Ferdinando’s keen interest in current scientific matters. The anonymous summary criticized Galilei, who responded with an angry rebuttal.48\n\nLater that year Ferdinando participated in an informal disputation with Galilei and two others. During a visit to Grand Duke Cosimo II de’ Medici in Florence in the fall of 1611, he engaged in a luncheon dispute about the buoyancy of bodies in water. On one side of the table sat, figuratively and maybe physically, Galileo Galilei and Cardinal Maffeo Barberini (b. 1568), the future Urban VIII (1623–44). On the other side were Cardinal Ferdinando and the Aristotelian natural philosopher Flaminio Pappazoni (ca. 1550–1613), who had just been appointed ordinary professor of natural philosophy at the University of Pisa after teaching at the universities of Bologna and Pavia.49 Pappazoni and Ferdinando defended Aristotelian views, which Galilei and Barberini rejected. Given Ferdinando’s Jesuit schooling and university study, it was to be expected that he would be an Aristotelian and differ from Galilei. In 1612 Galilei published his views on the subject: Discorso … intorno alle cose che stanno in su l’acqua (Discourse on bodies on or in water). He looked at buoyancy somewhat in Archimedian terms and as a function of dynamics and mechanics. And he attacked unnamed Aristotelians.50 Galilei sent a copy to Ferdinando, who graciously thanked him.51\n\nTo participate in the luncheon debate, Ferdinando had to have specialized knowledge and be agile enough verbally to dispute the immensely learned and sharp-tongued Galilei. Ferdinando was an unusual amateur scholar to contemplate such a test, even if Galilei treated him gently. The presentation of a mathematical-astronomical problem and the informal disputation were typical university events. Ferdinando was still a student at heart.\n\n4. DUKE FERDINANDO GONZAGA\n\nOn February 18, 1612, Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga died and was succeeded by Ferdinando’s older brother, who became Duke Francesco III Gonzaga (b. 1586).52 This had little impact on Ferdinando. But when Francesco suddenly died on December 22, 1612, apparently of smallpox,53 Ferdinando’s life changed decisively. Since Duke Francesco III had left only one living child, a daughter, Maria, born July 29, 1609, Ferdinando was next in line to become duke of Mantua and Monferrato. At first it was believed that Francesco’s widow, Margherita Savoia (1589–1655), the daughter of Duke Carlo Emanuele I (1562, ruled 1580–1630), of Piedmont-Savoy, was pregnant. Were she to produce a son, the infant would be the next ruler, and a regency would have to be organized. Carlo Emanuele demanded that Margherita return to Turin with Maria, an obvious ploy to become de facto regent of Mantua and Monferrato should Margherita produce a son. In any case, since Monferrato could be inherited through the female line, he intended to claim Monferrato on behalf of Maria. Ferdinando refused to let mother and daughter leave. When it became apparent that Margherita was not pregnant, Ferdinando permitted her to depart but kept little Maria, who was sent to an Ursuline convent in Mantua.54\n\nUndeterred, Carlo Emanuele I claimed Monferrato on behalf of his three-year-old granddaughter. Finding little diplomatic support for his claim, Carlo Emanuele I invaded Monferrato on April 23, 1613. He quickly took control of extensive parts of the duchy of Monferrato but not Casale Monferrato, as Gonzaga troops gamely fought back. But it was difficult for Ferdinando to send more troops to Monferrato, because they had to march more than 200 kilometers through Spanish-controlled Lombardy, crossing the Oglio, Adda, Ticino, and Po rivers, to reach Casale Monferrato. Fortunately, most other states condemned or failed to support Carlo Emanuele’s claims, while the Spanish attacked Piedmont-Savoy. The fighting petered out, as the military struggle became a diplomatic campaign. It was resolved in 1617, with further adjustments later, with the Gonzaga still ruling Monferrato.55\n\nAlthough Ferdinando, still a cardinal, was ruling Mantua in his own name and Monferrato as de facto regent for his niece Maria, his position was precarious. Emperor Matthias helped considerably by recognizing him as ruler of Mantua and Monferrato on October 21, 1613. Ferdinando then successfully petitioned the papacy for permission to renounce his cardinalate and to be allowed to marry. Because Ferdinando had not taken higher orders, the path was clear. He formally renounced his cardinalate on November 16, 1615. For good measure, the pope created his younger brother Vincenzo (1594–1627) a cardinal in his place on December 2, 1615, ensuring that a rich harvest of benefice income stayed in the family. Ferdinando was formally crowned duke of Mantua and duke of Monferrato on January 6, 1616.56\n\nNow Ferdinando had to marry well, which he made more difficult through his ill-considered actions. In or about 1613, in the midst of war and negotiations with the papacy, Ferdinando fell in love with a lady-in-waiting, Camilla Faà (ca. 1600–62), the daughter of a Monferrato count, and secretly married her on February 18, 1616. This was neither an appropriate nor a politically useful marriage for a Gonzaga duke. So, Ferdinando repudiated the marriage as feigned, and it was declared invalid.57 Camilla was banished to Casale Monferrato, where on December 4, 1616, she gave birth to a son, Giacinto. She was eventually moved to a convent in Ferrara, while little Giacinto was later brought to the court. With Camilla Faà out of the way, Ferdinando married his second cousin Caterina de’ Medici (1593–1629) on February 5, 1617, in Florence. She was the sister of the reigning Grand Duke Cosimo II de’ Medici and the daughter of Ferdinando’s great-uncle Grand Duke Ferdinando I de’ Medici. The marriage renewed the alliance with the Medici.\n\nAfter overcoming the threat of dismemberment of his state, Ferdinando settled into the business of government and diplomacy.58 Like other Italian rulers, Ferdinando had to make sure that his diplomacy did not arouse the disapproval of the great powers, a task that he found exhausting. Maintaining good relations with Spain, which ruled Lombardy, was a high priority because of the widely separated parts of the Gonzaga state.\n\nFIG. 3.

Reproduced with permission of the owner, of Roberto Bini who made the photograph, and of Il Bulino edizioni d’arte, Modena.\n\nThe possibility of a land swap to make the Gonzaga state contiguous and compact arose. Ferdinando would deed the duchy of Monferrato to Lombardy (meaning Spain) in exchange for the Cremonese (the territory of Cremona excluding the city, which did not want to be ruled by Mantua) and some minor territories. Although the Cremonese was smaller than Monferrato, it was contiguous with the duchy of Mantua on the east and would have given the Gonzaga a geographically unified state. The swap would also have strengthened the Spanish presence in northwestern Italy, which would not have pleased Piedmont-Savoy or France. There were two significant disadvantages for Ferdinando. The Cremonese would not have yielded nearly as much income as Monferrato, and the Gonzaga would no longer rule two duchies, with a consequent loss of prestige.59 In the end, nothing happened.\n\nDespite his difficulties, Ferdinando had many advantages. He presided over a peaceful and absolutist realm, which meant that he was not answerable to council, commune, or any other body representing the people. The state, including his consort, councillors, and courtiers, revolved around him. He lived in a huge palace housing an extraordinary art collection, a natural history museum, a collection of antiquities, and much else. He presided over a brilliant court graced by talented artists and musicians.\n\nThe Venetian ambassador painted a glowing word picture of Ferdinando as duke. Ferdinando spoke Italian, Latin, German, French, and Spanish, and could read Hebrew and Greek. He needed little sleep, preferring to write music and poetry at night. Upon rising in the morning he always had something witty to say, which sometimes discomfited members of his retinue. He never forgot anything that he read. He loved both ancient and modern poetry and had written a good deal of verse. He had also written much on philosophy and theology and was so skilled in law that he had no need of legal experts.60\n\nFerdinando loved listening to and composing music; it was his refuge in time of troubles. Hence, he supported a chorus of singers attached to the ducal chapel of Santa Barbara plus female soloists, at a cost of 30,000 ducats annually, a figure that may be exaggerated. Although dazzled by Ferdinando’s taste and intellect, the pragmatic ambassador also pointed out that the duke had inherited a debt of some 800,000 ducats from Duke Vincenzo I, and that the annual income of the state was only about 430,000 ducats in time of peace. Ferdinando spent as much as he took in.61\n\nFerdinando manifested the intellectual and religious sensibilities of the Baroque age. He had a wide-ranging intellectual curiosity and told his agents abroad to keep an eye out for new books that might interest him.62 He shared in the age’s optimism that alchemy and astrology would reveal the hidden secrets of nature. For example, in 1624 he ordered an agent to search for books on astrology in Venice, Padua, and elsewhere. In due course, the agent found a treasure trove of books in ancient, medieval, and Renaissance astrology, divination, prognostication, and geomancy.63\n\nFerdinando admired and supported the new poets of the Baroque, such as Gabriello Chiabrera (1552–1638) and Giambattisto Marino (1569–1625). He liked opera, the musical form created by Baroque composers. And he embraced flamboyant religious devotions. Late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century men and women were particularly fascinated with Christian antiquities and saw them as means for deepening their devotion. Ferdinando shared this attitude and demonstrated it by constructing a replica of the Scala Sancta (Holy Stairs) of Jerusalem.\n\nAccording to tradition, the Scala Sancta were the twenty-eight steps of the staircase leading up to the palace of Pontius Pilate that Jesus ascended and descended before and after his appearance before Pilate. St. Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, brought them to Rome about 326 and installed them in the Lateran Palace, adjacent to the Basilica of St. John Lateran, which later became the papal residence. Medieval builders added two other staircases on either side of the Scala Sancta. The Scala Sancta then fell into disuse as a pilgrim destination because of the general disrepair of the Lateran Palace, and because the popes moved to the Vatican in the fifteenth century. In 1589 Pope Sixtus V had the old palace torn down and a new one built in its place. He had the Scala Sancta moved to its present location next to a private chapel called the Sancta Sanctorum (Holy of Holies) in the rebuilt Lateran Palace, and he added two more staircases for common use. The Scala Sancta again became a popular pilgrim destination, especially during Holy Week devotions, as the devout ascended the stairs on their knees by torchlight, singing hymns. Those who did so received plenary indulgences. Several popes are reported to have made the ascent on their knees, including Pius IX in September 1870 just before the army of the Kingdom of Italy entered Rome.64\n\nFerdinando had a replica of the Scala Sancta flanked by two other staircases, plus a chapel called the Sancta Sanctorum, built in an older wing of the ducal palace between the summer of 1614 and the spring of 1615. For good measure he added some catacombs. Then on the night of April 5, 1615, Cardinal Ferdinando (he had not yet renounced his ecclesiastical office) carried a reliquary holding a thorn from the Crown of Thorns of Jesus from the church of Santa Barbara, the court church next to the palace, to the new Sancta Sanctorum. On the night of April 15, Cardinal Ferdinando, accompanied by cavaliers and nobles in a torchlight procession, carried a tabernacle that held another reliquary containing a vial of some of the blood of Jesus to the Sancta Sanctorum. He probably obtained from Pope Paul V indulgences for those who ascended the steps of the Mantuan Scala Sancta on their knees.65\n\n5. THE JESUIT PART OF THE UNIVERSITY\n\nDuke Ferdinando enjoyed the company of the Jesuits. In the words of the Jesuit chronicler of the Mantuan college, Ferdinando came at any hour and became “a familiar presence in our house.” To make his visits easier and more private, Ferdinando had built an elevated wooden passageway from his palace to the houses next to the Jesuit island. Once inside the college, he donned the informal dress that Jesuits wore at home and participated in their recreations and exhortations. He made the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius.66 Ferdinando also became the leader of the congregation of nobles organized by the Jesuits.\n\nThere was more. In 1618 Blessed Luigi Gonzaga was declared the protector of the city of Mantua, an event celebrated in grand style on his feast day, June 21. Ferdinando obtained permission from Rome for the reading of the Office (prayers that priests, monks, and nuns were obliged to recite daily) and Mass of Blessed Luigi in all the Gonzaga states.67 He sent artisans to modify the Jesuit college and ducal musicians to play at the religious and civic celebration, which included religious exercises, the fanfare of trumpets, the tattoo of drums, the firing of artillery pieces, and much else. Ferdinando announced that he had placed himself, his family, and all his subjects under the protection of Blessed Luigi.68\n\nFerdinando had even larger plans that would include the Jesuits. In or about 1622 he told others about his resolve to found a university in Mantua.69 Although a momentous decision, he never explained his reasons beyond two passing comments. In the summer of 1624 he wrote that the university was for the public benefit.70 And he wanted the Jesuit part of the university to begin in November so that the city would quickly enjoy the benefit of the university.71\n\nFerdinando undoubtedly believed that the coming university would benefit his subjects and the city of Mantua. By “public benefit,” he may have meant the training of civil servants, physicians, and lawyers for the state, the reasons often suggested by historians for founding universities. But it is not likely that this was the most important reason. The Gonzaga government did not need many highly trained civil servants because it lacked the many magistracies, councils, and offices of republics. Moreover, his subjects in the Mantovano could easily attend the nearby universities of Parma, Pavia, Ferrara, Bologna, or Padua to obtain legal and medical degrees, while those living in Monferrato could attend the University of Turin, which was even closer. If the Jesuits pressed him to create a university, they did so informally, because no documents have come to light.\n\nIt is most likely that he decided to found a university because he loved learning. Ferdinando was a prince-savant and perpetual student who reveled in the university environment. He had studied the humanities in the pre-university paedagogium at the University of Ingolstadt and law at the University of Pisa. He had a keen interest in several university subjects, notably natural philosophy and astronomy. As a cardinal, he had done alchemical experiments in his laboratory. Ferdinando also followed developments in two fashionable subjects of the day, astrology and Paracelsian chemical medicine. He clearly enjoyed participating in university-style events, such as Biancani’s elucidation of an astronomical-mathematical problem and the disputation with Galilei. As duke he was comfortable in the presence of scholars. No other Italian ruler for a century before or after Ferdinando had such a keen interest in learning or greater familiarity with universities and scholars.\n\nThe Gonzaga tradition of strong support for learning also probably moved him toward creating a university. Guglielmo, Vincenzo I, and Ferdinando supported scholarship in botany, pharmacy, medicine, and alchemy, thus building a foundation for the medical teaching of the university. Ferdinando would fulfill the long-held Gonzaga desire for a studium generale, which would add more prestige to a family that already ruled two duchies.\n\nFerdinando’s close association with and respect for the Jesuits meant that the Society would be part of his university. He looked to Ingolstadt and Parma as models and began to create a joint Jesuit-civic university. He proceeded on parallel tracks. On one he negotiated with the Jesuits concerning their part of the university. On the other he recruited professors of law and medicine and considered taxation schemes to pay their salaries. He started with the Jesuits. Ferdinando sought a formal agreement with the Society and money with which to expand the Jesuit school into the arts and theology part of the university.\n\nDuke Ferdinando initially tried to get the money from an ecclesiastical benefice. In January 1623 one of the duke’s agents reported on his efforts to secure from Pope Gregory XV (Alessandro Ludovisi, 1554, elected pope 1621, d. July 8, 1623) permission to use income from a prosperous abbey to support the Jesuits and the new university. The abbey in question was the Cistercian monastery of Santa Maria di Lucedio, usually just called Lucedio in the documents.\n\nProbably founded in 1123, Lucedio was of one the wealthiest monastic houses in Italy, because it owned and managed a considerable amount of land near the tiny village of Lucedio, located about twenty kilometers west-northwest of Casale Monferrato. Emperor Charles V originally possessed the right to confer the abbey on whomever he chose, and he chose the Gonzaga. However, Pope Paul III (ruled 1534–49) attempted to seize the abbey for his grandson, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, and a long, nasty fight developed. Cardinal Ercole and the Gonzaga dukes finally secured Lucedio and its ius patronatus, that is, the right to bestow it on whomever they chose and to select abbots and administrators, even though they had to share some of the income with Farnese cardinals for many years.72 Lucedio became a money stream on which Gonzaga cardinals floated.\n\nAs cardinal, Ferdinando had enjoyed benefice income of 25,000 to 30,000 ducats, of which the Lucedio abbey and a priory were the two chief sources.73 Although no longer a cardinal, Duke Ferdinando probably still had some influence over Lucedio.74 On the other hand, the pope had ultimate authority over all benefices and the disposition of their revenues. So in January 1623 Ferdinando’s agent asked Pope Gregory XV to allow a pension (a diversion of part of the annual income of the abbey to a third party for religious or pious reasons) of 4,000 ducatoni for the support of an expanded Jesuit community in Mantua, which would be part of the planned University of Mantua.75 There was precedent for the request, because earlier popes had permitted the diversion of ecclesiastical benefice income to the support of universities.76\n\nGregory XV resisted. He objected that the money would be used for houses and furnishings rather than for learning. He doubted that the duke could actually create a university, in which case the money would only end up financing the expansion of the Jesuit college. And he thought that the university should be financed through other means, offering the example of Bologna, where a gabelle, a tax on goods coming into the city to be sold, financed the university. He did not like income from a religious institution to be diverted to non-ecclesiastical purposes.77\n\nFerdinando’s agent responded with the plea that the duke could not raise such a large sum in any other way. He assured the pope that the proposed university would be a great success and become one of the best universities of Italy. Not only would it draw students from the Gonzaga state, it would attract many students from parts of Germany with which the duke had connections.78 He argued that because the income of the abbey was intended to provide for members of religious orders, supporting the Jesuits and the university was a legitimate use. Although nothing was decided, Ferdinando’s agent believed that the pope was favorably inclined. The agent then met with the Jesuit father general, Muzio Vitelleschi, who promised to do all that he could to further the enterprise.\n\nBut the pope did not change his mind and, even worse, died in July 1623. Things did not go better with his successor, Urban VIII. By early March 1624, the duke’s agent was less optimistic about a pension from the Lucedio abbey, after which the matter disappeared from the correspondence.79 Ferdinando would have to find the money for the Jesuits from his own resources.\n\nSo he did. By late March 1624, Alessandro Striggi, his chief minister who spoke for Ferdinando, had offered the Jesuits 1,000 scudi.80 By June Ferdinando had raised the bid to 2,000 ducatoni plus some land, while the Jesuits were willing to start teaching in the autumn. By July they reached agreement in principle, and in August the two sides were discussing the details of money, land, and a building. On December 4, 1624, Ferdinando instructed Duchess Caterina to approve some new unspecified articles and to give the Jesuits what she and the duke’s ministers thought right.81\n\nThe Gonzaga and the Jesuits signed an agreement on December 19, 1624, after the Jesuit university had already begun.82 To support the Jesuit professors, Ferdinando deeded to the Society seven properties belonging to the Villa Fabrico (probably located near the modern village of Fabbrico) in the territory of Correggio in the extreme southern part of the Mantuan state. The agreement stated that these properties were worth a little less than 60,000 scudi, calculated at 6 Mantuan lire equals 1 scudo. To bring the value of the endowment up to 60,000 scudi, the duke added an annuity (censo) of 2,045 scudi, on which Ludovico Gonzaga (not further identified) would make annual payments of 5 percent. The combined annual income from the properties and annuity was expected to be 1,500 scudi.83\n\nThe contract stated that this amount was enough to support twenty-five Jesuits, professors and students, each at the rate of 60 scudi per annum. In addition, the duke gave the Jesuits a house contiguous to their college for classrooms and pledged to renovate it. For their part, the rector of the Mantuan college and the father general agreed that from the beginning of November 1624 onward the Jesuits would provide professors to teach scholastic theology, cases of conscience, natural philosophy, mathematics, rhetoric, and the humanities at the university. In addition, they agreed that they would maintain in perpetuity a minimum of twenty-five Jesuits, divided between professors and students, in the Mantuan college. Father Orazio Ferrari, the rector of the Mantuan college, signed for the Jesuits, and Duchess Caterina de’ Medici, procurator general for her absent husband, signed for the duke.84\n\nAlthough Duke Ferdinando was quite generous toward the Society, the Jesuits did not realize as much income from the land at Fabrico as they had anticipated. Even though they immediately arranged for crops to be planted and buildings to be improved, the properties never produced the expected income for several reasons. The land was not very fertile and was subject to flooding. It was quite far from Mantua, which made transferring the proceeds to Mantua time consuming and expensive. And the Jesuits lost some of the land to local people as a result of monetary and legal disputes that Ferdinando had left unresolved. By 1628 the Jesuits wanted to exchange the Fabrico properties for others. But the plague, the war, and the devastation of the countryside by soldiers in 1629 and 1630 made this impossible. They were stuck with the Fabrico land, which over time yielded an average income of 2.5 to 3 percent, rather than the expected 5 percent.85\n\n6. THE PUBLIC ACADEMY OF MANTUA\n\nThe land endowment and other arrangements made the Jesuit part of the university, called the Public Academy of Mantua for the time being, possible. On October 25, 1624, Ferdinando issued a printed proclamation announcing “a new university” (un nuovo Studio) in Mantua in which the Jesuit fathers would teach rhetoric, mathematics, logic, philosophy, and theology. He invited his subjects to attend. He prohibited those desiring instruction in these disciplines from going outside the state, and he ordered all those studying these subjects abroad to return within three months under pain of his displeasure (see figure 4).86 The terms of the proclamation were customary, as Italian governments routinely ordered their subjects to study in the university of the state and were routinely ignored.\n\nA printed poster announced the “Public Academy of Mantua [Publica Academia Mantuana] of Ferdinando Gonzaga, sixth duke of Mantua and fourth duke of Monferrato.” It included a roll (rotulus): a schedule of professors and lectures that would begin in November 1624. The roll listed twelve daily lectures to be delivered by nine Jesuits along with the texts that they would teach.\n\nIn addition to listing the courses, the printed roll attempted to bring the Jesuit university to the attention of potential students. Copies were posted throughout the city and sent to other towns and abroad. The roll mentioned a public oration “in Templo” (probably the Jesuit church), with the date and the hour to be filled in by hand. This was probably an oration formally opening the Public Academy. The Jesuits also promised that disputations on philosophical and theological questions would be held nearly daily and weekly, with more solemn disputations on a monthly schedule and on the afternoons of feast days.87\n\nFIG. 4.

It taught an expanded Jesuit higher studies curriculum of rhetoric, poetry, logic, natural philosophy and metaphysics, moral philosophy, mathematics, casuistry, Scripture, and theology, just like the program of studies of the Jesuit half of the University of Parma and perhaps the University of Ingolstadt. The professor of natural philosophy and metaphysics taught the same texts in both the morning and the afternoon, although it is likely that he lectured on different parts of the texts rather than repeating his lecture. The logician also taught the same texts in morning and afternoon, either presenting different material or repeating his lecture for different students. The humanist taught rhetoric in the morning and poetry in the afternoon. The other six Jesuits lectured once a day.\n\nThe arts and theology part of the University of Mantua was launched. Duke Ferdinando now had to create the law and medicine part of the university."
