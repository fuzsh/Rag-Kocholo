        "text": "One of Valadier’s most lyrical works, this herm designed for Palazzo Borghese in Rome was intended to imitate and respond to ancient objects in the family’s celebrated collection. The main body of the sculpture is carved out of alabastro a rosa, a rare colored marble, to which Valadier added the bronze head of Bacchus.\n\nTwo tables of the same design were made by Valadier for Palazzo Borghese in Rome and were subsequently moved to the family’s villa (only one is displayed in the exhibition). The tables have sumptuous porphyry tops and bases in colored marbles. Each base is decorated with four extraordinary golden masks representing the Seasons. The tables were originally surmounted by porphyry and gilt-bronze candelabra (now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art).\n\nLuigi Valadier (1726–1785)\n\nClock for Don Abbondio Rezzonico, 1765–70\n\nGilt bronze, shagreen, and other materials\n\nclock, 26 3/4 × 11 3/4 × 6 3/4 in. (68 × 30 × 17 cm);\n\nbracket, 12 5/8 × 13 3/8 × 8 5/8 in. (32 × 34 × 22 cm)\n\nPrivate collection\n\nValadier designed this clock for the nephew of Pope Clement XIII, Abbondio Rezzonico, who was made senator of Rome in June 1765. A representation of the she-wolf, the symbol of the city of Rome, decorates the top, and the Rezzonico family coat of arms is at the bottom. The clock is adorned with gilt bronze and green shagreen (zigrino in Italian), a leather covering often made from the skin of a shark or ray.\n\nThis coffee pot may have been created to celebrate the marriage, in 1776, of Prince Sigismondo Chigi and Maria Giovanna Medici d’Ottaiano. Its details denote a taste for archaeological motifs. The female head supporting the spout reflects Valadier’s enduring interest in Roman antiquities. Two unusual details are the high neck, which lends atypical proportions to the coffee pot, and the overlay of a leaf on the wooden handle.\n\nA small covered bowl accompanied by a dish and a spoon, an écuelle, was sometimes given — particularly in France and Germany — to a new mother to celebrate the birth of her child. The two doves at the top of this écuelle may represent the love between the parents of a newborn. This particular object, which is indebted to French models, is close in style to works designed by Luigi’s father, André.\n\nThis tureen is part of a large silver service created for Prince Sigismondo Chigi. After Luigi’s death, in 1785, the service was completed by his son, Giuseppe. The tureen’s design illustrates the similarity between the styles of father and son in the 1780s and 1790s. The supports, fashioned like lions’ paws, are close to Luigi’s designs, but the handles are more typical of Giuseppe’s style. The prominently engraved coat of arms emphasizes the Chigi patronage.\n\nThis large oval-shaped soup tureen stands on four animal paws. Lions’ heads with rings serve as handles, and the cover displays the figure of a little girl with a brazier. It is likely one of four tureens designed with the symbols of the Seasons. This one (the only survival) represents Winter.\n\nIn the 1780s, Valadier produced a large and impressive silver service for the Borghese family in Rome. Only a few pieces survive, among them, this delicate spoon with the design of a Medusa head on its handle. The rest of the service’s flatware was decorated with similar motifs.\n\nThis is one of two very similar oil lamps on view in the exhibition. Both have a particular virtuoso treatment in the foot with a scalloped edge, supported by double scrolls with a shell in the middle. The arm of each lamp is adjustable, and the contoured shades were meant to be engraved with coats of arms. This particular lamp displays those of the Vinci and Morrone families from the town of Fermo, in the Marche.\n\nThis is one of two very similar oil lamps on view in the exhibition. Both have a particular virtuoso treatment in the foot with a scalloped edge, supported by double scrolls with a shell in the middle. The arm of each lamp is adjustable, and the contoured shades were meant to be engraved with coats of arms.\n\nTrays on which cutlery, bread, and salt were set, caddinets (cadenas in French or panettiera in Italian) were initially used only by sovereigns and princes of the blood but later, in the eighteenth century, by the aristocracy. Valadier designed a number of such objects, but this is the only surviving one. It was created for Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart (1725–1807), Duke of York, the son of James Stuart, the Old Pretender, and younger brother of Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, “Bonnie Prince Charlie.” With the death of Cardinal Stuart, the family of Catholic pretenders to the English throne came to an end.\n\nThis casket (cantinetta in Italian), like the caddinet also featured in the exhibition, was designed for Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart, Duke of York. The eagles, bucrania, and Stuart coat of arms match the decoration of the caddinet. The two objects, now in different collections, have been brought together for this exhibition.\n\nValadier designed a number of inkstands, though none survive. This drawing depicts an inkstand — in gilt silver or bronze — that includes two candlesticks. It was inspired by an engraving by Juste-Aurèle Meissonier (1695–1750) that has ink containers with a similar contour.\n\nA salver made to support two cups — one in porcelain for chocolate or coffee and the other in glass for water — and a dish for biscuits or cakes (in the middle) is known as a trembleuse and in Rome as a digiuné, from the French déjeuner (lunch or meal). With its free ornamental motifs and its lightness, the design of this trembleuse is French in style. The glass for water, on the left, is held by reeds, while the porcelain cup for coffee or chocolate, on the right, is supported by a metal decoration with small beans, which may be related to both exotic plants and drinks.\n\nThe decorative motifs in this design consist of small oak branches with a dragon nesting among them. These refer to the coats of arms of the Chigi (oak) and Boncompagni (dragon) families. It is likely that the trembleuse (now lost) was designed for Gaetano Boncompagni Ludovisi (1706–1777) and his wife Laura Chigi (1707–1792). This drawing shows the design for the object from the front and from above.\n\nThis framed bas-relief reproduces the Crucifixion of St. Peter, the celebrated painting by the Bolognese artist Guido Reni (1575–1642), now in the Pinacoteca Vaticana in Rome. It was probably created about the time Valadier was at work on the high altar of the Cathedral of Monreale. Because of the costly materials used, this devotional object must have been made for a prominent and wealthy patron.\n\nBetween 1768 and 1773, Valadier created the magnificent silver high altar (still in situ) for the Cathedral of Monreale, in Sicily. The altar was decorated with bas-reliefs showing scenes from the life of the Virgin (to whom the church was dedicated). For the top of the altar, Valadier created silver statues of six saints closely associated with Monreale — St. Louis, St. Castrense, St. Paul, St. Peter, St. Benedict, and St. Rosalia. These prodigious statues are on display in the exhibition for the first time outside of Monreale.\n\nBetween 1768 and 1773, Valadier created the magnificent silver high altar (still in situ) for the Cathedral of Monreale, in Sicily.

These prodigious statues are on display in the exhibition for the first time outside of Monreale.\n\nIn January 1767, Valadier displayed, in his workshop on Via del Babuino, a large and lavish monstrance intended for a church in Mexico. Decorated with symbols of the Evangelists, with the figures of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and with putti, cherubs, and symbols of the Passion of Christ, the gilt-silver piece was further enhanced by twelve thousand white topazes. Unfortunately, this sumptuous object is lost, but this drawing is likely related to that commission.\n\nThis extraordinary gilt-silver mass service was made for Cardinal Domenico Orsini d’Aragona (1719–1789) for use in his private chapel in the family palazzo in Rome. Each piece is decorated with the Orsini family coat of arms. Probably after the cardinal’s death, it reached the Cathedral of Muro Lucano, in the south of Italy, since Cardinal Orsini, who had many titles, was Count of Muro Lucano. This ensemble is a rare example of ecclesiastical silverwork from eighteenth-century Rome.\n\nIn 1760, Prince Camillo Borghese commissioned the refurbishment of his family chapel in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, known as the Cappella Paolina as it was the burial site for Paul V, the Borghese pope. Antonio Asprucci designed a new altar for the chapel, for which Valadier provided the bronze decoration. This is Asprucci’s original design for the altar.\n\nThis is probably Asprucci’s presentation model for the altar of the Borghese Chapel in Santa Maria Maggiore. Two different options are given for the marble decoration. The final altar was decorated with a third color scheme not shown in this drawing. Work on the chapel continued under the supervision of Prince Camillo Borghese’s son, Marcantonio IV, one of Valadier’s great patrons.\n\nLuigi Valadier (1726–1785)\n\nAltar Card Frames for the Cappella Paolina, 1762\n\nLapis lazuli, silver, and gilt bronze\n\ncentral frame, 19 1/4 × 22 7/8 × 4 in.

Altar cards displayed specific prayers that were regularly recited during the mass and were meant to serve as memory aids for priests. The elaborate design and rich materials of these frames convey their prestigious patron.\n\nLuigi Valadier (1726–1785)\n\nThe Triumph of Bacchus, 1780\n\nAgate, alabaster, ancient hardstones, ancient glass paste, gold, gilt metal, and gilt bronze\n\n24 3/4 × 25 × 5 7/8 in.

Photo: Les frères Chuzeville\n\nIn 1780, Valadier mounted a collection of ancient cameos for Pope Pius VI. These had belonged to Cardinal Gaspare Carpegna (1625–1714) before they entered the papal collection. For The Triumph of Bacchus, one of the most celebrated ancient cameos, Valadier created an extraordinarily inventive frame using other ancient cameos and engraved gems. The piece is supported by reduced replicas of two Egyptian lions, which are on the Fountain of the Acqua Felice in Rome.\n\nLuigi Valadier (1726–1785)\n\nBacchus and Ariadne, 1780–85\n\nAlabastro d’Orta, bronze and gilt bronze, ancient intaglios and cameos, crystal, ancient glass paste, sculpted fragments\n\n21 5/8 × 19 3/4 × 5 7/8 in.

(17 × 25 cm)\n\nMusée du Louvre, Paris\n\n© RMN-Grand Palais/Art Resource, NY\n\nThe cameo of Bacchus and Ariadne had also belonged to Cardinal Carpegna, like The Triumph of Bacchus. Made of glass, and not stone, it is an exceedingly rare object. Valadier conceived for it a grand frame into which he inserted small cameos and ancient fragments. One of the two bronze goats at the top is ancient, while the other was created by Valadier to match it.\n\nThe form of this pair of vases is based on the Medici Vase (Uffizi Galleries, Florence). In white marble and porphyry, with gilt-bronze reliefs following ancient models, the vases were created for Jeanne Bécu, Madame Du Barry (1743–1793), the mistress of King Louis XV of France. They were delivered to her in Paris, from Rome, in May 1773.\n\nAs well as being interested in classical antiquity, eighteenth-century patrons also had a taste for ancient Egyptian art. The Borghese family commissioned an entire Egyptian-style room for their villa on the outskirts of Rome. Valadier designed this extraordinary clock with Egyptian motifs for Villa Borghese.\n\nThis vase resembles the drawn modello by Valadier. It is small but of exquisite quality and made with an exotic and seldom used marble, rosso Appennino. This is the only known marble object by Valadier to have gilt-silver mounts. The acorn on the top suggests that the vase may have been commissioned by the Chigi family, whose coat of arms included oak branches.\n\nThe vase depicted here would have had a dual use. It was fitted with branches for candles, but its lid also could be removed and the vase filled with flowers. This highly finished drawing is one of many by Valadier depicting vases decorated with lions’ masks holding rings in their mouths. Several vases following this design, in different materials, are known.\n\nWinged monopodial lions support two small marble bowls (tazza in Italian). The interior of each tazza is decorated with a Medusa head. The design for these objects was used by Valadier a number of times, including for containers in the first deser of the Bailli de Breteuil. These two were probably made about the same time Valadier was at work on the Madrid deser.\n\nThis is a splendid reduction of the Temple of Isis, one of the most admired monuments discovered in Pompeii. Made out of alabaster and various colored marbles, it was probably designed by Valadier’s son, Giuseppe, and by Carlo Albacini. This object may have been part of a large deser, possibly one decorated with reductions of ruins of Pompeii, a preparatory drawing for which survives in Naples.\n\nWhile in Rome, about 1778, the Swedish sculptor Johan Tobias Sergel commissioned a series of bronze reductions of famous classical statues for King Gustav III of Sweden. The five shown in the exhibition (from a much larger group) — Antinous, Ludovisi Ares, Apollo Sauroctonos, Cleopatra (today called Ariadne), and Faustina the Younger — are uniform in quality, chasing, and patina and sit on beautifully designed bases in cipollino marble. It was common for foreign rulers and aristocrats to own small versions of some of the best-known statues from Roman antiquity.\n\nWhile in Rome, about 1778, the Swedish sculptor Johan Tobias Sergel commissioned a series of bronze reductions of famous classical statues for King Gustav III of Sweden.

(189 × 139 mm)\n\nMuseo Napoleonico, Rome\n\n© Sovrintendenza Capitolina ai Beni Culturali — Museo Napoleonico\n\nAn early description of the deser of the Bailli de Breteuil describes two cups, each held by three female bronze figures — now untraced. This design, clearly influenced by the Borghese Three Graces (now at the Louvre), probably relates to these lost objects.\n\nThe design for this triumphal arch is based on the ancient Arch of Trajan in Ancona. Valadier created a reduction of the arch for the deser of the Bailli de Breteuil. Some of the decoration shown in the drawing — some rosettes and the equestrian statuette and trophies at its top in gilt bronze — is no longer present on the arch of the deser.\n\nWorkshop of Luigi Valadier (1726–1785)\n\nDesign for the Side, Horizontal, and Vertical Sections of the Arch of Trajan in Ancona, ca. 1778\n\nPen, ink, and watercolor on paper\n\n17 1/2 x 11 1/4 in. (445 x 286 mm)\n\nMuseo Napoleonico, Rome\n\n© Sovrintendenza Capitolina ai Beni Culturali — Museo Napoleonico\n\nIn addition to sketching a frontal view of the Arch of Trajan for the deser of the Bailli de Breteuil (both the sketch and the arch are on display in the exhibition), Valadier’s workshop also made a drawing that shows the arch from its side, as well as a plan and a section of it. Similar drawings probably existed for most of the architectural reductions of the deser.\n\nFinished drawings such as this one were created in Valadier’s workshop either as modelli — presentation drawings to be shown to the patron — or as records of objects produced in the workshop. This drawing relates to the Temple of Minerva, decorated with columns in verde di Corsica marble and with a carved ivory relief in the pediment, which was made for the deser of the Bailli de Breteuil. Now missing in the temple are the three ivory statuettes at the top of the pediment in the drawing.\n\nThis drawing of the Temple of Mercury relates to one of the temples of the deser of the Bailli de Breteuil. The temple is made with colored marbles and semiprecious stones, such as amethyst and garnets. The garland at the center of the tympanum and the three small vases at its top are no longer present in the temple of the deser.\n\nWorkshop of Luigi Valadier (1726–1785)\n\nDesign for the Front of a Pronaos, ca. 1778\n\n15 1/8 × 8 7/8 in. (385 × 225 mm)\n\nPen, ink, and watercolor on paper\n\nMuseo Napoleonico, Rome\n\n© Sovrintendenza Capitolina ai Beni Culturali — Museo Napoleonico\n\nThis drawing depicts an extraordinary object (now lost) that was once part of the deser of the Bailli de Breteuil. The two columns must have been veneered with lapis lazuli, and the little pronaos, or vestibule, was decorated with a dragon-like creature on the attic and a Medusa head between the columns.\n\nThis preparatory drawing is related to the Temple of Flora at the center of the deser of the Bailli de Breteuil. The temple was loosely based on the ruins of the Temple of the Sibyl in Tivoli. The small temple for the deser was created with lapis lazuli columns. The design shows a gilt-bronze statuette in the center, sphinxes at the top, and festoons between the columns, which are now missing in the Madrid temple. A working drawing created in Valadier’s workshop, this sketch would have subsequently been drawn in a more finished way to serve as a presentation model.\n\nThis drawing conveys an idea of some of the architectural pieces that decorated the deser of the Bailli de Breteuil or possibly another similar table centerpiece. Valadier’s workshop, which produced a large number of such architectural reductions, was well known for its whimsical pieces.\n\nRegistro Generale: Inventory of all the works, tools, utensils, and other articles necessary for the profession of silversmith, gilder, and caster of every sort, various stones, hard and soft, cut and uncut, in the shop of Signor Giuseppe Valadier in the year MDCCCX\n\nRome, 1810\n\nManuscript, ink on paper\n\n11 3/4 x 8 1/8 in.
