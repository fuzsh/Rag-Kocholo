        "text": "Please Subscribe or Donate to Help Keep This Site Free!\n\nTobias, a young Jewish man, has been sent by his blind father to retrieve money left with a relative. Accompanying him on the journey are his dog and a hired guide who, unbeknownst to him, is the archangel Raphael. When they reach the Tigris River, Tobias is attacked by a monstrous fish. Raphael tells him to catch it and preserve its innards as medicines. Tobias later burns the heart and liver to free his future wife from a demon and uses the gall (bile) to cure his father’s blindness. The lively dog appears in other works by Sanmartino—it may have been the artist’s own pet.\n\nSource\n\nFree Downloads Below\n\nHi-Res\n\n1200px\n\n800px\n\nThis image is in the public domain\n\nPlease Subscribe or Donate to Help Keep This Site Free!"
