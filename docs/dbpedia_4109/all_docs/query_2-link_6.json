        "text": "Watched this disaster classic on Amazon Prime last night.\n\nHad forgotten how good this film was. And how campy. Great fun.\n\nFaye Dunaway looking her absolute best.\n\nJennifer Jones plunging to her death and hitting the side of the building.\n\nA thin and svelt Susan Flannery (!!) having a tryst with Robert Wagner before plunging to her death in her panties.\n\nFred Astaire as a con artist with a heart of gold.\n\nOJ saving the cat.\n\nPaul Newman and Steve McQueen!\n\nMiss Dunaway's tussled hair and dress flapping in the breeze in the elevator scene and the utter beauty of her face....wow she was a work of art. She never looked better.\n\nSupposedly Jennifer Jones got really mad that Miss Dunaway was in her trailer and made them wait to film this scene. I say let her have the extra time. Whatever makeup and stuff she was putting on was just flawless.\n\nJones hitting the building is odd. It was just a small scale model. Why did they have her hit it like that? It looks sort of cheap like the special effect went wrong. The fireman btw in the elevator is the guy who asks Pamela Sue Martin to dance in Poseidon and plunges into the glass ceiling.\n\nI saw on AMC Behind the scenes that Jones thought this would be a real attention getting role for her like Helen Hayes had in Airport and Shelley Winters in Poseidon. But it just didn't work out. Audiences didn't connect with her. She was set up to be such a saint saving the children and all but somehow she just didn't have the impact the other two women had.\n\nSteve McQueen seems depressed throughout the film. The AMC thing said that was because he had his choice of the Newman role or his and as they were shooting it became apparent to him that he picked the wrong role and Newman was coming off as the real star.\n\nAnd the billing in the poster!! Drama their too.\n\nMcQueen first and then Newman slightly higher. Then William Holden got in on it and demanded his own line so Miss Dunaway had to be a step down from him.\n\nR3, McQueen counted the number of lines and discovered that Newman had 12 more lines, so he demanded an equal amount, which he got. When McQueen's character first appears 42 minutes into the film, Newman had already used up half his lines, so he felt that McQueen ultimately walked away with the picture.\n\nHolden demanded top billing, but 35 years into his career, he was no longer a top star. McQueen and Newman got the odd staggered \"equal\" billing, Holden got pushed to 3rd, dropping Dunaway to 4th.\n\nDunaway's tardiness pissed off Bill Holden. After waiting for her for 2 hours, she finally shows up on set. Holden shoved her against the wall and warned that if she does that again, he's going to push her through the wall. They ended up together again for \"Network.\"\n\nI got a chuckle when Susan Flannery won the Golden Globe for New Star of the Year in 1975 based on her Towering Inferno role.\n\nBest New Star?!? Sound like she got just got off the bus and walked onto a movie set and got the role. In reality, Susan Flannery had been playing Laura Horton on Days of Our Lives for eight years before landing the part in Towering Inferno. Her role on Days was a central one. Much of the show was built around her character. She was one of the show's main stars. So, getting Best New Star for Towering Inferno seemed bizarre.\n\nR32 Here, and I’m watching, I may or may not live blog as I do, but I have some questions and comments already:\n\n1) it’s only on Amazon Prime for only nine more days, so those interested in watching should plan accordingly. 2) the staggered billing was in the opening credits as well, which reminded me of Laverne and Shirley where even as I child I noted it when they open the doors and stand there awkwardly. 3) I assumed Jennifer Jones would get the “And” treatment and do a little Barrie Youngfellow turn, but I was sorely disappointed. 4) WTF Irwin Allen only directed the “action sequences,” what he was too lazy to do the whole film?\n\nThere were a lot of good looking people in this movie, but I thought Robert Wagner was just gorgeous. I was so sad when he died. And his girlfriend, too. She seemed alright. If only they hadn’t turned off the phones, maybe they would have survived.\n\nOne part that had me laughing out loud was Steve McQueen’s ‘Oh shit’ after the other fireman told him there’d be no way back down from setting the explosives. And then when he’s talking to Newman on the phone and Newman asks him who is going to set the charges and McQueen responds that they’ll find some dumb sob to do it.\n\nIt’s here around 2:40. Classic.\n\nFred Astaire won the Golden Globe and was predicted to get a career Oscar.\n\nHe really doesn't have the material though. Both he and Jennifer Jones were in there as the two old time stars making a return.\n\nTheir storyline and performances really didn't steal the film like Shelley Winters did in Poseidon and Helen Hayes did in Airport.\n\nPlus Robert De Niro was really great in Godfather 2 and had missed out on an expected nomination the year before for Bang the Drum Slowly. He was a hot new star so he beat the sentimental favorite. (unusual for the seventies most of the old timers Hayes, Art Carney, George Burns won.)\n\nDeNiro wasn't even there to get the award though.\n\nOne of my favorite parts is the fact that the building is perpetually exploding due to backdraft (which I believe had been mapped out as a phenomenon only fairly recently). Glass and debris is perpetually be launched into space.\n\nYet the vast plaza below remains completely clear and we never see any difficulty in how the firemen exit or enter the building.\n\nFun bonus! All the stairwells are blocked and the elevator system is destroyed, but the survivors are at the ground level the same night of the catastrophe.\n\nThe address of the building is that of the famed Palace Hotel, suggesting that the landmark was demolished for this piece of flimsy shit.\n\nIn one of the extras on the Blu-Ray, I think they covered the consultations with fire department officials (with one on the set, I believe).\n\nApparently the firemen they consulted at the time told them that THEY never stayed in a room above the 3rd floor. And that they were very careful where they sat in restaurants, wanting to be near the exits and the sprinklers.\n\nSupposedly there were complaints from builders after the movie was released because they thought it was too alarmist. Not long after the movie, though, there were some high rise fires that reinforced what was shown in the movie. Some people believe the movie helped to convince people that sprinklers and other safety measures should be incorporated into new buildings.\n\nOne story they told had the film people trying to work out how they could shoot fire scenes without causing the studio alarms to go off. A movie person suggested that they just turn off the fire alarm when they were going to shoot a scene with fire. To which the consulting fireman responded, \"Turning off the fire alarm and then starting a fire is called ARSON.\"\n\nNow that I have digested this, here are some random thoughts. If McQueen thought Newman was running away with the movie, to me it didn’t have anything to do with the way the characters were written. McQueen just seemed flat compared to Newman. You could see Newman’s character thinking, seeking proactive. McQueen just seemed reactionary, even though that’s not how the character is necessarily written.\n\nWas Robert Wagner going through a rough time in Hollywood? His character’s story line was … abrupt.\n\nI know OJ got away with murder, and that’s what we think of first now. I forgot how much goodwill and generic likability he had built up in appearances like this before anyone knew of his violent tendencies.\n\nHow did the people in the control room get out? How did everyone on the top floor get down after the water tanks were detonated? Did the building have a sprinkler that malfunctioned?\n\n[quote]r137 Now that I have digested this, here are some random thoughts. If McQueen thought Newman was running away with the movie - -\n\nThose are NEGATIVE and I notice that you have NOTHING in about Marlon Brandon, you have NOTHING in about Johnny Depp who I did two films with, which I was BRILLIANT in and they were not well SOLD in this COUNTRY. You can't put in that I worked with the wonderful Marlon Brando?! It’s very upsetting to me. It's just, like, you know, an obsession. WHY can't you be obsessed about positive things? About Marlon Brando? About the Kusturica movie that was the hit of all of Europe and Cannes?\n\nR137\n\nRe Sprinklers: --- When the fire chief arrives (about the 43:00 minute mark) he speaks to the architect and asks about the sprinklers. Newman tells him the sprinklers are not working on floor 81 (where the fire is) and when McQueen stops and asks \"Why?\", Newman says \"I don't know\".\n\nRe Control Room --- I don't recall they ever specified where the Control Room was. I assumed it was at or below the ground floor. The only reference is when OJ says there was an indication of a fire in the \"Main Utility Room\" which he refers to as \"down there\". It looks as if the main utility room is in a basement\n\nRe: Robert Wagner's part --- The Blu-Ray has extended or deleted scenes. One of those was showing Dan (Robert Wagner) in his office on 65 (across from and on the same floor as Duncan's). Wagner is presiding over a meeting of 8 or 9 other people as they are going over the details for the grand opening. The jeweler is announced and brings in the gold scissors and everyone ooohs and aaahs. The scene was positioned right after Newman finds the bad wiring in the Utility Room and before the scene where Newman and Will Giddings get off the elevator and head into Duncan's office to tell him about the \"almost\" fire. The implication is the Wagner has a significant position in the company, someone who can handle a complicated task with ease.. Without this scene, Wagner's character comes off as someone much lower in the organization.\n\nSF Bay residents: does the helicopter’s flight path in the opening credits make any fucking sense?\n\nFirst it appears to be skimming just above the waves, heading south.\n\nNext it’s flying much higher in what appears to be the interior.\n\nThen south again along the coast, and into fog and when it emerges is facing toward SF and the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThen I (think) it again skims above the surface going north (?) along the marina district, before the pilot makes a Mohammed Atta-style low pass between buildings downtown before finally circling and climbing to land on the roof of the tower.\n\nThe FAA would have his license in seconds if a pilot tried that in real life.\n\nWoW. Faye Dunaway had the most beautiful refined face and features of any woman I've ever seen on film. She's just a bit worn looking too - she was never an ingenue. The arch of her brows, the bow mouth, those rattlesnake cheekbones, her fucking beautiful forehead and chin and jaw structure. Such a self consciously beautiful and sensuous looking woman. Faye was unbelievable looking in still shots and motion. I've never seen this goofy movie - but I'm a gonna.\n\nI love setting things on fire. A little of Faye Dunaway goes a long way, so all the other posts are of interest too. Who was the fat old movie star with the helmet hair? Jennifer January? Does she hit her head at the start of the film?\n\n[quote]R159 Who was the fat old movie star with the helmet hair? Jennifer January? Does she hit her head at the start of the film?\n\nJennifer Jones. Unfortunately she doesn’t die right away, because she’s usually boring as shit.\n\nShe broke up one of Hollywood’s most powerful marriages in her youth and married the producer husband. He then over managed her career to the point where she appeared mostly in boring projects when not tied to his overblown bombs. She still won an Oscar, but her career would have really been better if not shackled to him.\n\nIn later life (after marrying another multi millionaire) she had a hairdresser and makeup man drop by the house every morning and do her up. Because she didn’t trust a mortuary to make her look good for an open casket should she drop dead.\n\n[quote]I saw on AMC Behind the scenes that Jones thought this would be a real attention getting role for her like Helen Hayes had in Airport and Shelley Winters in Poseidon. But it just didn't work out. Audiences didn't connect with her.\n\nAudiences didn't connect with her? What are you talking about, because she wasn't nominated for the Oscar? She was nominated for The Golden Globe. I can tell you first hand audiences were very upset when she went out of the elevator. It opened in very few theaters because exclusive engagements were a good thing in those days. I was a kid and saw it opening weekend to a packed house and I went back many times to my Mother's frustration. Having a big beautiful 70MM theater in the neighborhood was a movie fanatic kid's best friend. You could hear the whole audience gasp when she went out and then groan when she hit. The scene worked perfectly.\n\nTold this story before here....\n\nMet Leslie Nielsen and Richard Chamberlain at the Chiller autograph show in Jersey. I handed Mr Nielsen, the Poseidon Special Edition DVD and said...\"This is all your fault, if you weren't flirting with the blonde\"...and he laughed and said \"Oh No, I take no responsibility for this!\"\n\nWhen I met Chamberlain I handed him the Inferno Special Edition DVD and said...\"This is all your fault\" to which he laughed and said \"Yes, I guess it is!\"\n\nDunaway would do great at the autograph circuit, Kathleen Turner is headlining now, but Faye probably would'nt appreciate the line of queens wanting \"Mommy Dearest\" signed.\n\n[quote] Disaster blockbuster, with each scene of someone horribly in flames presented as a feat for the audience's delectation. The picture practically stops for us to say, \"Yummy, that's a good one!\" These incendiary deaths and the falls from high up in the 138-floor tallest skyscraper in the world are the film's only feats. Paul Mewman and Steve McQueen mutter heroic sentiments, and Faye Dunaway manages to look goddessy-beautiful through it all, wandering through the chaos in puce see-through chiffon. [...] The picture asks us to believe that the tallest building in the world--a golden glass tower that's a miracle of flimsiness, as it turns out--would have been set down in San Francisco, of all places.\n\nR257, in The Poseidon Adventure, it was really hot pants with a skirt slit up to the waist. Without the hot pants, the skirt would be open. It was a young ingenue’s modern style party “gown,” but for a young teen or early twenties woman.\n\nHot pants was a brief fashion in the 1970s and sometimes women wore them with nylons and heels as a party or club look. That fashion was really hot for a short time, then it faded.\n\nHere’s an interesting article about the making of The Poseidon Adventure. One of the considerations in designing the costumes was that they had to be designed to shred and tear, but the women would still be decently covered. Pamela Sue Martin’s hot pants “dress” was made of velvet from the waist down, which wouldn’t tear easily, but would look soiled and ragged pretty easily. Carol Lynley was also wearing velvet hot pants.\n\nNow it seems pretty unlikely that two women would be wearing hot pants on a cruise, but it was such a fad, it came and went, but was really popular for a while.\n\nCalm down r189. Yes the elevator scene is probably the most memorable part of the film.\n\nI'm just quoting what the AMC documentary said. They had producers and people involved with the film and they said Jones was disappointed that she didn't create the buzz and get the career rejuvenation that she wanted from the film.\n\nI just looked up her credits. She never worked again. As I said above she owned Terms of Endearment for a while and probably hoped Inferno would give her enough of a boost to get that made.\n\nI think people remember her falling but the rest of the film she didn't make much of an impact.\n\nR264, the helicopter flight path isn't that off. It comes in over the Marin Headlands, through the Golden Gate Bridge, then as heading east over the Bay turns right over Aquatic Park, heads south roughly over the Van Ness corridor and then turns left heading east again over City Hall, which would point it Downtown. Where it gets a little wonky is that it seems to head south over the Union Square area. To do that, if coming from Civic Center area, it would have had to made a hard right, then a hard left to get to the top of the building if it were where the Palace Hotel is on New Montgomery.\n\nNewman was a star who became an actor and, as an actor, he got better over time, with more challenging roles. I liked him better in his mature parts---he was so much better in \"Nobody's Fool\" than in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" and was able to make a cliched part worth watching in \"the Verdict\". McQueen was a star who tried to become a more serious actor over time--it didn't happen. I'm sure that Newman was aware of who had better parts, bigger box office, but he wasn't petty and insecure like McQueen. Both were really entering a time in their career when they had to be more than just \"stars\". Newman was ready and on his way. McQueen was not and never would be.\n\nKael's review is one of her better ones. As she got older, they became more incoherent, with more purple prose. Her writing was probably less important than her overall approach. She had the mantel of NYer and made it ok to like daring often violent films from new filmmakers and to hate prestige pics and dull films you were supposed to like because they were foreign.\n\n[quote] [R264], the helicopter flight path isn't that off.

To do that, if coming from Civic Center area, it would have had to made a hard right, then a hard left to get to the top of the building if it were where the Palace Hotel is on New Montgomery.\n\nNext, on \"The Californians\"...\n\n\"Nothing happens for an hour except setting up the relationships of the cardboard characters.\"\n\nAs has been explained upthread, r291, that's the structure of the disaster film. Also stated was that Inferno does get an earlier start than the others. Maybe the disaster film is not the genre for you. Inferno's character's were drawn from two books making an easier job for Stirling Silliphant. Also, you had a villain you could actually blame the disaster on. When all is said and done, what people go to disaster movies for are the special effects. Nobody can fully appreciate Inferno on their TV sets. See it like some of us did originally, on a 70mm screen....\n\n[quote]r303 [Kael's] writing was probably less important than her overall approach. She had the mantel of NYer and made it ok to like daring often violent films from new filmmakers and to hate prestige pics and dull films you were supposed to like because they were foreign.\n\nShe also acknowledged that it was alright to enjoy trash or campy fun. There was a wide spectrum of movies and performers she enjoyed. Like, for her review of MADAM X she wrote something along the lines of, “We’re supposed to be awed by the lavish budget, the exotic locations. Which would be fine if - say - you had someone like Capucine in a series breathtaking clothes. It may not be art, but it’s entertainment of a sort.”\n\nGotta speak up about the misrepresentation of Maureen McGovern (which is all over the internet, including IMDB which should know better). McGovern did NOT sing \"The Morning After\" in the film of The Poseidon Adventure. The voice heard in the film is an uncredited session singer named Renee Armond. McGovern later did a cover single that became a hit, but she was never in any way a part of the film. It was because of her hit single that she was offered \"We May Never Love Like This Again\" for The Towering Inferno. Just to confuse matters, 20th Century Fox never released a soundtrack album for Poseidon, and when it was finally done as a 1995 bootleg (on a label called Johnny Boy -presumably in honor of John Williams) the McGovern cover was included as the final track -with Armond's original from the film only appearing in 2010 in a limited-edition soundtrack release.\n\nFor those that don't know her (beyond those two songs) McGovern is tremendously versatile -able to sing pop, jazz, and classical styles. She sang the role of the mother in the workshop of Carrie The Musical which was later performed by Barbara Cook and Betty Buckley. She recorded some classical vocals with Leonard Bernstein, and her Christmas album is one of my all-time favorites. Her best album, Academy Award Performance, was only released on CD in Australia, but the LP can be had on Amazon and eBay as well as all the usual places.\n\nR305 The Last Voyage (1960) and The Poseidon Adventure (1972) are a good hour shorter than The Towering Inferno and get to the main event in about 15 minutes. I didn't really care about any of the characters and as far as I was concerned they can all fry and that goes for those kids and the cat! The extras are an inept bunch who seem bored except when running to an elevator. I also find Titanic an epic bore. I tried watching The Towering Inferno several times and always lose interest. It's free with my Prime subscription.\n\n[quote]r308 Madame X was a hoot. Especially when Lana Turner was supposed to be a twenty something blushing bride when she was forty-five! It definitely requires a total suspension of disbelief.\n\nSo as not to stir up a riot, I did not include how Kael’s statement (roughly) goes:\n\n“Which would be fine if - say - you had someone like Capucine in a series of breathtaking clothes. It may not be art, but it’s entertainment of a sort. [italic]But the middle aged Lana Turner does not wear clothes well. She wears them like matronly women in Palm Springs do.”\n\nR276, that was Shelly Winters! She looks like a matron that watches over stewardesses in the 1960s, or a woman manager in Airport. It’s like a matronly uniform. It was probably smart for Shelley to gain the weight, because she looked more pillowy and matronly. That drawing looks like an old battleaxe.\n\nAbout the shoes, I saw another picture of Stella Stevens’ shoes. She was wearing silver leather platform ankle straps. That was a style then, but for younger girls out clubbing. Between that and the braless lace top evening gown, she looked like an overage hooker, which is what she was. Good costuming.\n\nPamela Sue Martin was wearing red leather sandals. I was right, they were daywear, not evening wear. They were implying she was an unsophisticated kid who didn’t have anything really appropriate. She just picked whatever red shoes she had. I felt sorry for the actress, wearing backless heeled sandals through all the climbing they did must have been miserable. Even Stella Stevens’ shoes had ankle straps holding them on. They climbed ladders and all kinds of stuff.\n\nThere’s another photo from the filming on IMDb showing another take of the scene below. She’s wearing white sneakers (not her costume) that slipped into the edge of the frame. They probably cropped it later.\n\nThe biggest problem with Towering Inferno, which I don't hate, is that it is by nature a stagnant film. The bulk of the cast is stuck on the top floor waiting and waiting and waiting for the fire to get to them. Meanwhile, in Poseidon (or other disaster flicks like Earthquake and even Titanic), the movie is mainly non-stop action and the fight to survive following the disaster.\n\nThe Airport movies all have the same problem in that something happens and then for 90 minutes you have the cast sitting around and waiting to die. So do the volcano movies. And Twister is a weird in that you have \"survivors\" chasing disaster in oddly paced set-piece action scenes but most of the movie is Helen Cunt blathering on.\n\nR341 here. I have finished The Poseidon Adventure. I can mainly say that … if you haven’t, you should watch it. It is epic. Shelley Winters of course makes the movie. I love how she keeps handing jewelry to her husband up until the last scene. I have never liked Gene Hackman in any role, ever, and that remains constant here.\n\nHowever, I started the movie wanting to sacrifice myself to the tsunami just to get away from these banal people and this tacky ship, only to see bodies flying what felt like 5 minutes later and then I was riveted. And then the whole thing with the Christmas Tree??! Which I almost forgot about by the end. Was this a cult cruise, because I still don’t understand why Gene Hackman and various other characters were “reverends”.\n\nAffirms my instinct to never go on a cruise, but this was a trip.\n\nr379 that is something that is a little odd about Poseidon. Many people are using it for transportation. Shelley is going to Isreael to meet her grandson. Hackman has been banished to Africa. Stella and Borgnine are on their way to a trip around Europe (she at least says at one point \"why we didn't fly I'll never know.\")\n\nAnd the kids being there alone is so odd. They're meeting their parents in Europe. Who puts kids alone on a cruise ship during the holidays? (I think they did that because they didn't want to have a family of four as part of the group. It would have become all about them but they wanted to have kids on board so kids would identify with them.)\n\nTrans Atlantic cruises are pretty rare nowadays. They only happen once a year when ships are brought from the Carribbean to Europe for the summer and then back for the winter. There's nothing to do on a transatlantic cruises. It is just days and days of sailing. People like the ports.\n\nI guess when the book was written people still used ships to travel to Europe since flying may have been kind of new? (don't know just a guess.)\n\nI'm surprised Robert Vaughn did this movie. His character had no actual storyline and he barely had any lines. I think he died when he tried to keep Richard Chamberlain from getting on the rescue chair, but I'm not sure.\n\nI thought the casting of Susan Flannery in this one was odd. She was unknown to people who didn't watch Days of our Lives and she was no ingenue like Susan Blakely. Did she finger some female executive at Warner Brothers to get the part?\n\nIt felt to me like a lot of scenes between Astaire and Jones were left on the cutting room floor. We don't know how they met, and we find out in a short 2-minute segment he's a con artist and she's okay with that. Huh?\n\nAlso, who chose that awful tent Jennifer Jones was wearing and who plopped that gawd awful mop on her head? She was only 55 when she made this movie, but she looked about 10 years older.\n\n[quote]I thought the casting of Susan Flannery in this one was odd. She was unknown to people who didn't watch Days of our Lives and she was no ingenue like Susan Blakely. Did she finger some female executive at Warner Brothers to get the part?\n\nDon't know the particulars of how or why Susan Flannery got cast. Maybe she just had an aggressive agent. Or maybe she used personal connections.\n\nBut Susan Flannery was one of the best known actors on soaps at the time. Days of our Lives was in #1 rated soap in 1973-74 (tied with Another World and As the World Turns). Her character of Laura Horton was one of the most popular on the show (along with Doug and Julie). Perhaps casting her was an attempt to bring in housewives who were soap fans to the movie.\n\n[quote] Spoiler on the Poseidon book..... Robin the kid does go into the bathroom by himself and and see the row of urinals upside down and then the explosion, just like the movie, but that is the last time you see him. He's not saved by the Reverend.\n\nMore spoilers from the book: The Shelby parents are on board with the kids, Rev. Scott is implied to be homosexual, and Susan gets raped by some panicked crew man and we're left to believe she's impregnated. It was a much larger group of survivors in the book, and also I think at the end a big number of other survivors are rescued from the dining room which more or less negates the point of their perilous adventure. I'm sure there's more, but that's all I remember off the top of my head. All in all, I think Allen and Silliphant did a good job paring down the book. For me, one to the aspects of the movie that I love best is the message of do for yourself, rely on yourself, and don't wait for God (or whatever) to come save your sorry ass. The book kind of pisses all over that message and turns the group into panicked, feckless daredevils who would have been better off waiting.\n\n[quote] The Airport movies all have the same problem in that something happens and then for 90 minutes you have the cast sitting around and waiting to die.\n\nThe first Airport (1970) isn't really a disaster film in the traditional sense of the 70s type -- it's really just a melodrama about an international airport that has a near-disaster in the last 30 minutes. Airport '77 has the most effective action in the series, though its intermittent.\n\nR429 I noticed that, too, and you'll see the same thing in The Poseidon Adventure when everyone's dancing to The Morning After. It was hilarious! When they filmed those scenes, they obviously did it without any music playing, and I'm sure the director said, \"Just dance around.\"\n\nAnd speaking of dancing, did anybody else notice Jennifer Jones almost tripping over her tent dress when she was dancing with Fred Astaire? He caught her before she fell down.\n\nI watched this film yesterday on Amazon Prime and had a surprisingly good time. Talk about a stacked cast! It’s hard to think of a film that could compete in terms of star power…plus the special effects were pretty decent. I will admit I thought the little boy was Willie Aames because he looked so familiar…can’t believe it was actually Bobby Brady. And Paul Newman…I’ve yet to see a film where he wasn’t the hottest thing in the room (and this one has actual fire in most scenes!)\n\nThe scene that really shocked me was when Susan Flannery first appeared and walked up to kiss Robert Wagner. By the time I learned who she was as a soap-watching kid in the 90s, she was overweight and becoming increasingly butch. But in The Towering Inferno she was thin and gorgeous! In profile she looked like a twig.\n\n\"I guess when the book was written people still used ships to travel to Europe since flying may have been kind of new? (don't know just a guess.)\"\n\nWhy do people who \"don't know\" feel compelled to offer their guesses?? Especially when two minutes on the internet would supply sufficient information to answer intelligently? The original novel of The Poseidon Adventure was published in 1969. In the early 60s 95% of travelers crossed the Atlantic by air. Until airline deregulation in the US, transatlantic flights tended to cost thousands of dollars, so taking the long way aboard a ship made sense for people who had more time than money.\n\nThat’s a good idea, R349.\n\nI always wrote off The Towering Inferno as some cheesy disaster film from before I was born, and I figured it was a poorly made piece of shit. Even if it was flawed, I was still impressed by the acting, plot, and special effects…to the point it joins Star Wars as an epic older film I would’ve liked to see in the theater. I’m glad this thread was started because it encouraged me to stop skipping the film and make it a point to actually watch it on Amazon Prime (which arbitrarily adds and removes films every other day).\n\nPoseidon Adv and Inferno are the best of the genre in terms of quality. Inferno is a little overlong and can get boring at times, but it has a lot of shocking deaths in it and is deliciously cruel in a way that no other disaster movie ever was.\n\nI've gotten to see TPA on the big screen several times at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, as it is a favorite of the American Cinematheque. (The New Beverly also plays it once a year, but their screen is shit in comparison.) One time I got to see Ronald Neame, the director of TPA, do a Q&A beforehand and he was fantastic, sharp as a tack even in his 90s, and told great stories, including several humdingers about Shelley.\n\nBut my fave appearance ever regarding TPA was when Carol Lynley and Stella Stevens came to the Cinematheque. Nothing to do with Poseidon, they were there for a double feature of Bunny Lake is Missing and Too Late Blues. In between the movies they did a Q&A and at the end of it, they asked the audience if we wanted them to reenact their favorite scene. Of course we said yes. So they stood up, faced each other, and Stella grabs Carol by the shoulders, shakes the shit out of her while screaming at her to come to her senses, then (faux) whacks her across the chops. Brought the house down.\n\nI found this comment from five years ago in a google search:\n\nWhen I saw it at the Plaza theatre in Sydney back in 1975 the intermission came right at the spot with the explosions in the stairwell when Paul Newman , Jennifer Jones and the kids are escaping, the curtain started going across the screen when Newman was falling down the shaft and the movie continued after the intermission with Newman hanging onto the twisted metal from the staircase and Jennifer Jones screaming \"Oh My God\"\n\nI caught it about 18months later at a smaller theatre in the suburbs when the city run was over and the intermission came at a different time, it was later in the movie at a spot with William Holden just looking out the window looking at the reflection of the fire in the building opposite.\n\n[quote] Well, allegedly, the plane was only 100 feet deep. Of course, you have to believe that a plane filled with air would sink in the first place....\n\nNot just the AIR POCKETS! (as Stella Stevens would say), but that the plane would likely be ripped apart in the process. Of course, it probably would have broken into several pieces when it hit the water which is reportedly worse than crashing into land.\n\nJennifer Jones had lost her husband and daughter as well as having had a suicide attempt and nervous breakdown the few years before signing up to do TTI. I wouldn't expect her to look serenely beautiful. And based on all that I've read about her, she came across as a nervous and high-strung woman. Stress ages people like that.\n\nI still think that her [italic]Madame Bovary[/italic] is stellar. Just the perfect role for her fluttery mannerisms and nervous sensuality.\n\n[quote] The telephone scene where she unsuccessfully tries to contact Regan's father serves no purpose like a number of scenes in the movie.\n\nI think it was there because in the book you're supposed to understand that one of the reasons Regan is ripe for possession is that she's troubled--her father pays so little attention to her.\n\nOne of the weirdest things about the movie is that even though it is so long (the episode in Iraq at the beginning goes on forever for no clear reason0, so much seems to have been cut out of the movie. It's never made fully clear, for example, that the reason the demon goes after Regan is because she's been playing by herself with an Ouija board and has summoned it through the board as \"Cap'n Howdy.\" It's only implied, but the book clarifies that and much more of the background of Regan and Chris.\n\nBack to the \"Towering Inferno\".\n\nDid anyone else notice that there are 3 vertical \"channels\" from the top to the bottom of the building?\n\nThere were 3 scenic elevators.\n\nOne of the deleted scenes showed Duncan and the guests approaching the elevators. The Mayor says \"3 scenic elevators. I'm impressed.\" Duncan replies \"Confidentially, there's only one of them working. The other 2 are inoperable.\"\n\nR499 \"Audrey Hepburn agreed to do BLOODLINE because her friend Terence Young was directing (...)Candice Bergen and Jacqueline Bisset had already passed, which should have given her a clue.\"\n\nDiane Keaton also turned it down. Gert Fröbe (replaced the already announced Maximillian Schell who instead landed Disney's terrible BLACK HOLE), Omar Sharif, James Mason and Romy Schneider all worked with Terence Young before. Fröbe in GOLDFINGER, Schneider TRIPLE CROSS, Sharif and Mason in MAYERLING.\n\nI've watched THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE probably ten times but THE TOWERING INFERNO only once. Just boring and an amateurish structure (I can't believe Guillermin directed DEATH ON THE NILE only a few years later). Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones - insult to their acting careers. I couldn't care less about Faye Dunaway and wanted Susan Flannery to survive (had no idea who the actress is when I watched it). I'll take Newman over McQueen but one has to credit McQueen for not working a second time with Irvin Allen. And I believe that AIRPORT THE CONCORDE is much more entertaining than INFERNO, at least the cast was selected with some absurd humor in mind. And Robert Wagner seems to be aware where his career was stuck in at that time - right next to Charo and Sybil Danning, one of his best performances nevertheless!\n\nJust boring and an amateurish structure (I can't believe Guillermin directed DEATH ON THE NILE only a few years later).

Variety praised the film as \"one of the greatest disaster pictures made, a personal and professional triumph for producer Irwin Allen. The $14 million cost has yielded a truly magnificent production which complements but does not at all overwhelm a thoughtful personal drama.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the film is \"overwrought and silly in its personal drama, but the visual spectacle is first rate. You may not come out of the theater with any important ideas about American architecture or enterprise, but you will have had a vivid, completely safe nightmare.\" Pauline Kael, writing for The New Yorker, panned the writing and characters as retreads from The Poseidon Adventure, and further wrote \"What was left out this time was the hokey fun. When a picture has any kind of entertainment in it, viewers don't much care about credibility, but when it isn't entertaining we do. And when a turkey bores us and insults our intelligence for close to three hours, it shouldn't preen itself on its own morality.\"\n\nGene Siskel of The Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it \"a stunt and not a story. It's a technical achievement more concerned with special effects than with people. That's why our attitude toward the film's cardboard characters is: let 'em burn.\"\n\n'You know there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead. All I can do now is pray to God that I can stop this from happening again.'\n\nCringy but not as bad as the final overlay crawl of the Titanic movie \"A Night to Remember\".\n\nBut this is not the end of the story - -For their sacrifice was not in vain. Today there are lifeboats for all, unceasing radio vigil and, in the North Atlantic, the International Ice Patrol guards the sea lanes, making them safe for the peoples of the world.\n\n\"Which is why we must consider Marvel Comics movies good?\"\n\nI've never seen a Marvel Comic movie, r564, because I have no interest in the genre. Those that do would know the criteria for which to judge their quality. They seem to do very well at the box office. Their goal, like disaster films isn't to be art, but to entertain the masses. I would say their quality (within the genre) would be commensurate with the amount of butts they get in the seats. Think of it as winning the popular vote if not the Electoral College.\n\n[quote]When Susan Flannery breaks the window and jumps her back is covered in flames yet in the long shot taken from above it looks like a piece of white paper floating down and there are no flames. Also when she jumps we hear her scream but her one hand is covering her mouth and it looks like she's holding her nose as if she were jumping into water!\n\nShe's not covering her mouth, she's covering her eyes as she jumps. You can see the flames going down.\n\nIt's the best movie of it's kind because death by fire is the worst and most terrifying. Drowning upside down ain't nothing too painful and a plane crash is pretty quick too. Being buried in rubble is maybe the most horrific thing - but that doesn't make a good film. Oh, I'm stuck. For days. Dehydrated. Starving. Broken bones. It's dark. Later you'll find me dead.\n\nBUT, to be skin peeled engorged by FLAMES while falling fast from a great height is painful and nightmarish. Ouchy scary. Thank God Faye and Paul survived. Gorgeous people should only get smudged or have their dress singed. Let a child survive, but not all of them."
