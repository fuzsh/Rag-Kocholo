        "text": "On Dec. 16, 1974, 20th-Fox and Warner Bros. unveiled in theaters what would become a landmark disaster movie: The 170-minute, John Guillermin-directed Towering Inferno. The movie, which took in $116 million domestically at the time, tops The Hollywood Reporter’s list of greatest disaster movies of all time. THR’s original review of the feature is below:\n\nMovie technology is the star of this awesome Irwin Allen production, a formula disaster picture made into an event by the sheer size of its inflating production values. More ordeal than entertainment, it overwhelms the spectator like a bully playing on the fears of a society trapped in its own burning affluence.\n\nSince the screenplay by Stirling Silliphant has nothing new to say (the “insanity” of building skyscrapers is dealt with in Earthquake), and the general doomsday appeal of the disaster genre has already been established, The Towering Inferno‘s appeal lies entirely in immediate visceral reactions.\n\nSteve McQueen’s final film is an action-comedy compromise that will satisfy his fans even if it barely hangs together. The thrills are kinder & gentler, with plenty of hair-raising stunts but less gunplay and gore. McQueen’s eccentric bounty hunter collects toys and can barely drive a car, but he always gets his man. Kathryn Harrold is good; Eli Wallach, LeVar Burton, Ben Johnson, Richard Venture and Tracey Walter are along for the ride (and stay out of Steve’s spotlight). Steve’s in charge — he tailors everything to highlight his quirky star characterization, and the guiding principle is ‘low key.’\n\nThe Hunter\n\nRegion Free Blu-ray\n\nViavision [Imprint] 110\n\n1980 / Color / 1:78 widescreen / 97 min. / Street Date April 6, 2022 / Available from Amazon Au\n\nStarring: Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach, Kathryn Harrold, LeVar Burton, Ben Johnson, Richard Venture, Tracey Walter, Tom Rosales, Teddy Wilson, Ray Bickel, Bobby Bass, Karl Schueneman, Taurean Blacque, Al Ruscio, David Spielberg.\n\nIt’s time to celebrate the Irwin Allen disaster epics for what they are — huge, indigestible spectacles that first seem funny and then congeal into a cinematic badness that words cannot describe. This sprawling ordeal tortures good actors and shatters every limit of audience patience. I alone have survived to tell thee. Is a fair review even possible?\n\nThe Swarm\n\nBlu-ray\n\nWarner Archive Collection\n\n1978 / Color / 2:40 widescreen / 156 116 min. /Extended Edition / Street Date September 25, 2018 / available through the WBshop / 21.99\n\nStarring: Michael Caine, Katharine Ross, Richard Widmark, Richard Chamberlain, Olivia de Havilland, Ben Johnson, Lee Grant, José Ferrer, Patty Duke, Slim Pickens, Bradford Dillman, Fred MacMurray, Henry Fonda, Cameron Mitchell, Christian Juttner, Alejandro Rey.\n\nCinematography: Fred J.

As a newbie to Hulu, I only discovered over the weekend that they, too, beyond just being an amazing resource for television programming, offer up a killer selection of genre movies that are free to stream with a standard Hulu membership.\n\nHere’s a look at an assortment of 31 films from Hulu that I think would be great movies to stream this October. I tried to give you guys a wide variety, too, hitting various sub-genres, so hopefully there’s a little bit of something for everyone in this list.\n\nThe Faculty\n\nAs far as high school horror films go, The Faculty has remained one of my very favorites for years now. Essentially, it’s Robert Rodriguez riffing on The X-Files, and who can resist that?...\n\nThis past weekend, the American Society of Cinematographers awarded Greig Fraser for his contribution to Lion as last year’s greatest accomplishment in the field. Of course, his achievement was just a small sampling of the fantastic work from directors of photography, but it did give us a stronger hint at what may be the winner on Oscar night. Ahead of the ceremony, we have a new video compilation that honors all the past winners in the category at the Academy Awards\n\nCreated by Burger Fiction, it spans the stunning silent landmark Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans all the way up to the end of Emmanuel Lubezki‘s three-peat win for The Revenant. Aside from the advancements in color and aspect ration, it’s a thrill to see some of cinema’s most iconic shots side-by-side. However, the best way to experience the evolution of the craft is by...\n\nThe new branded line Shout Selects chooses Buckaroo for special-special edition treatment, with a long making-of docu just like the ones from the heyday of DVD.

Richter\n\nReviewed by Glenn Erickson\n\nNot content with its already well appointed special Blu-ray editions,...\n\nFred Koenekamp, the Oscar-winning cinematographer known for his work on such films as Patton, Papillon and The Towering Inferno, has died. He was 94.\n\nKoenekamp died May 31, his daughter Kathy told The Hollywood Reporter. He suffered a stroke last year and died at her home in Bonita Springs, Fla.\n\nKoenekamp spent more than a decade at MGM, where he served as director of photography on several films as well as on the stylish NBC series The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\n\nThe innovative cinematographer won his Oscar (shared with Joseph F. Biroc) for the disaster-film classic The Towering Inferno (1974) and...\n\nLenny Bruce: Dustin Hoffman in the 1974 Bob Fosse movie. Lenny Bruce movie review: Polemical stand-up comedian merited less timid biopic (Oscar Movie Series) Bob Fosse's 1974 biopic Lenny has two chief assets: the ever relevant free speech issues it raises and the riveting presence of Valerie Perrine. The film itself, however, is only sporadically thought-provoking or emotionally gripping; in fact, Lenny is a major artistic letdown, considering all the talent involved and the fertile material at hand. After all, much more should have come out of a joint effort between director Fosse, fresh off his Academy Award win for Cabaret; playwright-screenwriter Julian Barry, whose stage version of Lenny earned Cliff Gorman a Tony Award; two-time Best Actor Oscar nominee Dustin Hoffman (The Graduate, Midnight Cowboy); and cinematographer Bruce Surtees (Play Misty for Me, Blume in Love). Their larger-than-life subject? Lenny Bruce, the stand-up comedian who became one of the...\n\nBy Craig Henderson\n\nFifty years ago, the Great Society was launched, the Ford Mustang went on sale, the Beatles invaded America, and “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” quite arguably the most intriguing and original adventure series ever produced for television, debuted on NBC. In September, 100 U.N.C.L.E. fans gathered in Culver City, Calif., home of the once-glorious Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio where the show was filmed, to celebrate five decades of fascination with U.N.C.L.E. The event was strictly limited to 100 attendees and sold out quickly, an indication of the show's lasting legacy.\n\nThe two-day event, dubbed “The Golden Anniversary Affair,” started organizing only last May. Two lifelong U.N.C.L.E. fans — Robert Short, an Oscar-winning special effects artist who was introduced to the show even before it went on the air when his sister got a job as a photo and stunt double on the series; and Jon Heitland,...\n\nOscar Sunday is three months from today, March 2, 2014 and this year, it’s anyone’s game. The Academy has a history of playing up all the glamour and suspense, and this year should be no different.\n\nAs of today, Gold Derby‘s Top 5 Best Picture predictions for the 86th Academy Awards are: 12 Years A Slave, Gravity, Saving Mr. Banks, Captain Phillips and American Hustle.\n\nHit Fix’s Top 5 are: Gravity, 12 Years A Slave, Saving Mr. Banks, Captain Phillips and Inside Llewyn Davis.\n\nIn what’s classic TV, take a look at the opening of the 43rd Academy Awards in 1971, featuring an introduction by Academy President Daniel Taradash.\n\nThe big A-listers of the day all appeared at the Oscars – Goldie Hawn, Jeanne Moreau, Melvyn Douglas, Ryan O’Neal, Leigh Taylor-Young, George Segal, Jennifer Jones, Lee Grant, Maximilian Schell, Ginger Rogers, Jack Nicholson, Ali McGraw, Robert Evans, Quincy Jones, Sally Kellerman, Jim Brown,...\n\nBefore there was The Shawshank Redemption, there was Papillon, in my opinion, the finest example of a prison drama followed closely by The Shawshank Redemption. Papillon is based on the memoir written by Henri Charriere, who was convicted of murder and spent his sentence as an inmate in the island prison of French Guiana. The film recounts many of the author’s experiences, but deviates some the from the book. While Papillon is said to be based on a true story, much of it’s authenticity has been disputed. Regardless, Papillon is a remarkable motion picture worthy of praise.\n\nThe opening of a great film can tell the viewer a lot, often by saying very little but doing so with a creative efficiency that says so much. Papillon opens with a close-up shot of the warden and his guards briskly marching towards the head of a new batch of prisoners,..."
