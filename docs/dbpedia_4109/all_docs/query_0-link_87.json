        "text": "Steve Jackson (Sidney Poitier) is a straight laced dude married to Sarah Jackson (Rosalind Cash), a wife he adores. He’s best friends with Wardell Franklin (Bill Cosby), a cab driver who’s a bad idea bear of the worst sort. When Steve gets his two weeks of vacation for the year, he doesn’t have much in the way of plans. So, for the first Saturday night, Wardell suggests visiting Madame Zenobia’s, an illegal after hours joint where the coolest cats in the city show up. Steve wobbles back and forth but decides why not. The two men sneak out after their wives are asleep and head over. It’s invitation only, but that’s no problem; Wardell has faked a letter of introduction using the stationary from the lawyer office his wife works at. It sees them through the door and into the place, where they make a mint betting on craps handled by the loud and lovely Leggy Peggy (Paula Kelly). Alas, their good fortune comes to an end when some masked stick up men show up at the joint and rob everyone, ultimately forcing them to strip down to their underwear.\n\nThe worst happens when Steve discovers on the next day that he’s won the lottery. $50k is waiting for him (over a quarter of a million in 2022 money), but the winning ticket is in his stolen wallet. The two men decide to ask some questions, track down the missing wallet, and hopefully recover the lottery ticket without alerting anyone to what they’re really after. Their trail will take them to a shady private eye, Sharp Eye Washington (Richard Pryor), a deceitful politician, Congressman Lincoln (Roscoe Lee Browne), a karate chopping crook by the name of Little Seymour Pettigrew (Harold Nicholas), as well as Geetchie Dan Beauford (Harry Belafonte) and Silky Slim (Calvin Lockhart), a couple of rival mobsters who are struggling for control of the rackets. Will Steve and Wardell pull this off before the stick up men get wise to what they’ve really got? Sidney Poitier directs and stars in the comic crime caper, Uptown Saturday Night (1974).\n\nA couple years ago, I enjoyed seeing Sidney Poitier’s directorial debut, a gritty little western with comic moments called Buck and the Preacher (1972). There, we saw a good cinematic storytelling ability from the famed actor. Appearing two years later, Uptown Saturday Night reunites Poitier with Harry Belafonte (though the latter has a smaller part) and boosts the comic moments in lieu of the serious ones. The film still has some suspense sequences, but for the most part we are firmly in the fertile territory that gave novelist Donald E. Westlake a solid half of his career.\n\nOne of the surprises is that while Poitier plays the straighter of the two leads, his relationship with Bill Cosby’s Wardell Franklin is not the traditional jokester/straight man we might expect. Both of these guys are more or less grounded in reality and capable of making terrible choices. Cosby’s Wardell is the more verbal, the big talker who gets the rug pulled out from under his feet more often, but Poitier’s Steve is just as much of a source of humorous choices and moments.\n\nThe film is an exercise in social awkwardness, two guys who are way, way, way out of their depths trying to make headway in a world they know relatively little about. Instead of Hitchcock’s Men Wrongly Accused, we get Men Making Wrong Decisions. Somehow, they still manages to get the clues and make headway, finding their way from one situation to the next, dodging fists and gunmen and tough guy gangsters.\n\nHarry Belafonte is a delight, as always. Here, he stuffs cotton in his cheeks to get a good impression of a Brando-type mob boss, and his grin is as manic as ever. He’s not the smooth operator of Odds Against Tomorrow (1959) or the romantic lead of Bright Road (1953) or the sleazy crook with a heart of gold from the aforementioned Buck and the Preacher. It’s delightful to see how easily and readily Belafonte will disappear into his roles. He doesn’t quite steal the scenes he’s in, but he’s certainly a charismatic and talented force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe look of the movie is pretty good. Cinematographer Fred J. Koenekamp does a fine job with lighting. He served as DP or cinematographer for a host of memorable movies, including Patton (1970), Billy Jack (1971), Papillon (1973), The Towering Inferno (1974), The Amityville Horror (1979), and The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension (1984). He’s got a good sense for how to light and shoot scenes not just in a utilitarian way but a subtly expressive one.\n\nSome of the humor is lost on me, coming to this piece as a white dude in my forties. Some of the awkward moments are brilliantly executed, wringing as much unease as laughs. Still, I chuckled and giggled and enjoyed much of the movie. Admittedly, some of my humor derived from the garish fashion choices on display.\n\nUptown Saturday Night is a sly little crime film, a comedy with some humorous twists that work. It’s not the best example of this sort of picture, but it’s an enjoyable piece nevertheless, and it would pave the way for better future projects in a similar vein, including a reunion between Poitier and Cosby in Let’s Do It Again in the following year. Still, it’s a serviceable and entertaining outing and worth a watch for fans of the talents or the comic crime genre.\n\n#\n\nUptown Saturday Night is available in DVD and VOD editions.\n\nWriting for “Follow That Money: Uptown Saturday Night” is copyright © 2023 by Daniel R.
