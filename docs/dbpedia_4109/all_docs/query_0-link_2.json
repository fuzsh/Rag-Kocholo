        "text": "Cinematographer Fred J. Koenekamp, who won an Oscar for “The Towering Inferno” and was also nominated for shooting “Patton” and “Islands in the Stream,” died May 31.\n\nHis daughter Kathy Guyitt and the American Society of Cinematographers confirmed his death.\n\nBoth “Patton” and “Islands in the Stream” were directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, for whom he also shot “Papillon” and later “Yes, Giorgio.”\n\nHis work included memorable films of the 1970s such as “Billy Jack,” “Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,” “Kansas City Bomber,” “Uptown Saturday Night,” and “The Amityville Horror.”\n\nKoenekamp received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the ASC in 2005.\n\nHe was born in Los Angeles, where his father, Hans F. Koenekamp, was a Hollywood cinematographer and special effects expert. After starting out as a film loader at RKO, he moved up through the ranks and eventually became director of photography for several seasons of “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.”\n\nA memorial service will be held June 17 at 1 p.m. at Eternal Valley Memorial Park & Mortuary, 23287 North Sierra Highway in Newhall, Calif."
