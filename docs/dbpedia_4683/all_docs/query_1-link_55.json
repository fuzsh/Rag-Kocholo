Information on the shareholders and the board of directors was gathered through the annual returns available at the Department of Registrar of Companies. The most recent data was available for the year 2017. While the Media Ownership Monitor research team reached out to the Voice of Asia Network (Pvt) Limited by formally requesting for the companyâ€™s information on 25 July 2018, the company did not respond to the aforementioned request. Viewership data was obtained from the Kantar Lanka Market Research Bureau (LMRB) for the year 2017, while listenership data was gathered for the period of January- November 2017."
