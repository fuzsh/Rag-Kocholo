Sooriyan FM is a Tamil language radio station which is managed by Asia Broadcasting Corporation (Pvt) Limited. On its official website, Sooriyan FM lists itself as the first private Tamil language radio station in the country. Founded by Rayynor Silva, Sooriyan FM has several sister stations including Hiru FM, Shaa FM, Gold FM and Sun FM. As per the research conducted by the Kantar Lanka Market Research Bureau (LMRB) for the year 2017, the listenership of the station is 9.47 percent.

In 2007, the Sri Lankan government suspended ABC’s radio broadcasting licenses on two objections: firstly, that although ABC’s licenses were issued on 17 November 1995, the company had only been incorporated in November; secondly, that ABC had broadcasted an erroneous report during the country’s armed conflict. Despite ABC issuing an apology and attempting to rectify the erroneous report, the government proceeded with the suspension on the grounds that it was reportedly a “gross violation of the freedom of expression”. Moreover, the Supreme Court dismissed ABC’s fundamental rights petition and ordered Chairperson Rayynor Silva to pay a Rs. 250,000 (2,259.99 USD) cash bail for submitting a false affidavit to the Supreme Court which had reportedly suppressed the initial erroneous news content ABC had broadcasted. Several media-related groups such as Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and the Free Media Movement (FMM) however widely condemned the suspension.
