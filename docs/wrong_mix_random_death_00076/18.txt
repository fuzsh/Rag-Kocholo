Our Portland, Maine, office was founded to support a multiyear construction project, but it quickly became clear that the region was to be a long-term home. We have grown to support projects locally and far away, offering our full range of engineering, architecture, construction, environmental, consulting and stakeholder management solutions from the heart of Portlandâ€™s historic Old Port.

As one of the top 10 architecture and engineering firms in the United States, as ranked by Engineering News-Record, our Portland team focuses on delivering client success for electrical transmission and distribution planning and design and supports the full range of infrastructure, facility and environmental needs.

We were recognized as one of the top design firms by ENR New England. Check out all our rankings.
