For more than 125 years, Portland, Maine has been home to Pierce Atwoodâ€™s flagship office, where we offer a full array of legal services, including environmental law, business law, energy law, real estate law, intellectual property, commercial litigation, as well as cutting edge practices such as technology transactions and outsourcing, privacy and data security, AI/Machine Learning, and more.

We are located in a historic building on Merrill's Wharf that was built circa 1840. The project to rehabilitate our offices was truly unique, and not only revitalized a proud old building, but a portion of the Portland waterfront as well.
