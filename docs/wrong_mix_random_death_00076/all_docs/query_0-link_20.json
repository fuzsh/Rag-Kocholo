        "text": "add bookmark\n\nHallowell\n\nHallowell is a historic village near Augusta, Maine’s capital, that sits on the banks of the Kennebec River. Though small, Hallowell is big on charm and character. Gorgeous 18th and 19th century architecture is found throughout town – many of which are on the National Register of Historic Places – and Water Street is lined with some of the best shops and restaurants in the region.\n\nThings to Do in Hallowell\n\nHallowell is well known for its artistic flair and along Water Street you’ll find art everywhere including the Harlow Gallery with exhibits of local artists. The Gaslight Theater is Maine’s oldest continuously operating theater with plays ranging from Tennessee Williams to Agatha Christie.\n\nThe charming Hubbard Free Library is in the oldest library building in Maine still serving its original function and it was built in the 1800s to look like an old English country church.\n\nIf shopping is your delight, Hallowell’s Water Street is the place to be. Famous for antiques, Hallowell has an incredible selection. The largest store is the Hallowell Antique Mall. Looking for a Maine-Made gift? Head to Vignettes of Maine. For tasty treats, visit the Scrummy Afters On Wheels in the warmer months.\n\nAugusta is only a mile away and a fun route to get there is along the Kennebec River Rail Trail, which brings you right to Capitol Park. Or head south towards Gardiner for a beautiful walk or bike ride along the Kennebec. Vaughan Woods is a treat year-round. Known as Hobbit Land, the paths through the forests and fields take you over beautiful stone bridges.\n\nHallowell enjoys celebrating, too. Fun, family events are held throughout the year, like the popular Old Hallowell Day with a parade and fireworks.\n\nWhere to Stay in Hallowell\n\nIt’s no surprise in a such a historic town that Hallowell has wonderful B&Bs. Maple Hill Farm is an eco-friendly country inn on 130 acres of land. Just a short walk from downtown Hallowell is the Second Street Bed & Breakfast. Nearby Augusta has many hotels to choose from, as well.\n\nRestaurants in Hallowell"
