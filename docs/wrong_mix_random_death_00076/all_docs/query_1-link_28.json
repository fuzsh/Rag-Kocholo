        "text": "When the need for more space to accommodate Knickerbocker Group’s growing team arose, the search led to a raw industrial shell. With much of the design and construction taking place during the height of the pandemic, many design decisions were driven by the desire to create a space for how our team would return to the office, as well as offer adaptability for how we will work in the future.\n\nTo transform the space, restored brick exterior walls, white-painted ceiling beams, and ductwork was added to create a unifying palette. To provide light and views, a central core contains the kitchenette, server space, four private bathrooms, a shower, and a mother’s/focus room.\n\nWood-toned workstations, which boast sit–stand desktops and closed storage, ring the windowed perimeter, bringing light into interior offices that feature all-glass walls. Overhead lighting is zoned, dimmable, and connected to efficient occupancy sensors. Functional and decorative acoustical treatments, such as wavelike felt panels that float above a meeting table, minimize sound echoing.\n\nThe natural beauty of wood and craftsmanship are highlighted throughout the space, from the live-edge conference room table—locally made from a fallen oak tree in downtown Saco—to the custom, built-on-site walnut acoustical wall panel that is backed with sound-absorbing material. The ADA-compliant, walnut kitchenette has touch-latch cabinets, concealed appliances, and an ash counter-height table that can be used for eating, working, or a brief meeting with a vendor or coworker."
