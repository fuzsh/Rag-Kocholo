        "text": "A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams\n\nThe Domestic Violence Project presents scenes 3 and 4 from Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire, depicting the infamous poker night and its aftermath in Williams’ iconic American play: Stanley and the boys are up late playing poker in small apartment where he lives with his wife, Stella. When Stella and her sister Blanche arrive home, a violent altercation ensues, and when the drunken Stanley becomes violent, his friends are forced to pin him down while Stella retreats to a neighbor’s home. Stanley’s breaks down and begs Stella to come back to him, which she does. The next day Blanche confronts Stella over Stanley’s behavior and, much to her surprise, learns that Stella does not wish to leave Stanley."
