        "meta_description": "The School of Film+Theatre at Scottsdale Community College (SCC) invites you to take a trip back to 1930s St. Louis for their production of Tennessee Williams' “The Glass Menagerie.” SCC continues its commitment to delivering powerful, thought-provoking performances that resonate with audiences. Witness the famous story that catapulted American playwright Tennessee Williams to fame. Drawing on his own life, Williams’ play unfolds in the hazy memories of Tom Wingfield, a young man torn between his responsibilities to his family and his longing for freedom and excitement. Audiences will meet Tom's mother, Amanda, an aging Southern belle navigating the challenges of single parenthood, and his fragile sister, Laura, who finds solace in a world of delicate glass figurines. As the family grapples with dreams, illusions, and the harsh realities of life, the boundaries between memory and truth blur, creating a haunting and timeless narrative that has captivated audiences for 90 years. The performance is directed by Scottsdale School of Film+Theatre Department Chair Bill True. He says, \"Tennessee Williams' masterpiece delves into the fragility of human connections and the impact of unfulfilled dreams. The characters resonate with universal themes, making The Glass Menagerie as relevant today as it was when first penned.\" Mark your calendars for an unforgettable experience: Matinees (2:00 pm) February 24 March 2 Evening (7:30 pm) February 23 February 24 March 1 Admission prices are $10 for SCC students and $20 for the public.
