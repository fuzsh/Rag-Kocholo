        "text": "Physical pain is only part of the problem after an injury. You also have medical expenses to deal with and, more than likely, an insurance company that will do all it can to pay you as little as possible. These are difficult circumstances for anyone to manage.\n\nOur attorneys are here to make things easier for you. We can identify the full scope of your losses and fight for the compensation you deserve. If the insurance company is unwilling to negotiate fairly, we’re ready to take your case to trial.\n\nIn times like these, you can count on us.\n\nAll law firms are not the same. They don’t all have an army of more than 1,000 attorneys collaborating to get the best results for each and every client; they don’t all have a track record of success that includes over $20 billion won; and they don’t all give every client the personalized attention they deserve.\n\nThere’s only one Morgan & Morgan.\n\nAs America’s largest personal injury law firm, Morgan & Morgan is uniquely equipped to handle virtually any injury case. If you were injured, contact us for a free, no-obligation case evaluation.\n\nIt costs nothing to hire us: we get paid only if you win, so there are no upfront fees and there’s no risk to you.\n\nDisclaimer: Cases may be referred to and handled by another law firm as referral counsel."
