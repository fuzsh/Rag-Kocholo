Tennessee Williams was a Pulitzer Prize winner and authored A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and The Glass Menagerie.\n\nSee more: Visit Historic Columbus\n\nIn 1993, the rectory risked destruction because of the nearby church’s expansion but was saved as a historical and literary landmark. The home was loaded onto the back of flatbed trucks and moved to its current site.\n\nSee more: 10 Places to Visit in Historic Vicksburg"
