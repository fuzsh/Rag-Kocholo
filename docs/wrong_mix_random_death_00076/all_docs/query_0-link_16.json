        "text": "Suddenly Last Summer, takes place in a tropical New Orleans garden. This steamy hothouse was the property of a dead poet, Sebastian, whose life was a work of art. That at least is the view of his mother, who is so anxious to preserve his idealized memory that she is prepared to go to any lengths to have his cousin, Catherine, stop babbling. But Catherine has her own story to tell about accompanying Sebastian on a Spanish island vacation that ended in violent tragedy. In this 90 minute play, Williams, at his most poetic, cracks open a can of worms that explores unspeakable taboos (as seen through the lens of America ’s repressive political atmosphere of the 1940s and 1950s), the consuming nature of desire (both human and cosmic), and the destruction and reconstruction of identity.\n\nStarring:\n\nJacklyn Maddux as Violet Venable*+\n\nMatthew Kerrigan as Dr. Cukrowicz+\n\nBeth Thompson as Catherine Holly+\n\nLuisa Sermol as Mrs. Holly*\n\nSteve Vanderzee as George\n\nDana Millican as Sister Felicity\n\nRebecca Ridenour as Miss Foxhill\n\n*Member of Actors Equity Association\n\n+Member of Shaking The Tree Performance Group\n\nSuddenly Last Summer\n\nPress and Audience Reviews\n\n\"Just straight-up beautiful piece of theatre, honest, moving, engaging, do not miss it.\" -Audience Member\n\n\"This show was amazing- from the production design to the acting to Samantha's focused and imaginative direction. What a vivid tale in such a lovely space! Go see this!\" -Audience member\n\n\"The genius of Williams is brought to life by this amazing cast. It's a must see!\" -Audience Member\n\n\"Even though I was familiar with the play, I found myself on the edge of my seat. It was so moving, and vibrant, and atmospheric. A truly immersive experience. Thank you for your work!\" -Audience Member\n\n\"Director Samantha Van Der Merwe has put together an outstanding company of local actors. Especially impressive are Beth Thompson as the vulnerable but often fiery Catherine and Jacklyn Maddux as the coldly dominating yet surprisingly desperate Mrs. Venable. Noteworthy among other performances is Luisa Sermol's spot-on portrayal of Catherine's saccharine-sweet, grasping mother.\"\n\nRichard Wattenberg- The Oregonian\n\nRead more here\n\n\"Van Der Merwe has done an exceptional job of assembling theatrical elements, using lighting, sound, and image to explore the inner stories and lives into which we get a glimpse.\"\n\nChrista McIntyre- Oregon Artswatch\n\nRead more here\n\n\"As soon as you walk into the Shaking the Tree theatre, you are in the affluent Garden District of New Orleans, the setting for Tennessee Williams' SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER. Having just spent some time in New Orleans, I was struck by how perfectly the set (by set designer and director Samantha Van Der Merwe) captured the feel - of both decadence and decay - that defines the city.\"\n\n- Krista Garver, Broadway World\n\nRead more here\n\n\"Van Der Merwe's direction is delightfully out there, pulling out the play's repetitive, strange language, and employing inventive techniques—including amazing work in sound, lighting, and projection—to convey the fact that Catherine, though committed to an asylum, is the play's most reliable narrator. In the final scene, she recounts what happened to Sebastian with a fugue-like delivery and staging that left me with goosebumps.\"\n\n- Megan Burbank, Portland Mercury\n\nRead more here\n\nListen to an interview with Dmae Roberts of Stage and Studio, who came to visit Artistic Director, Samantha Van Der Merwe, the week we opened."
