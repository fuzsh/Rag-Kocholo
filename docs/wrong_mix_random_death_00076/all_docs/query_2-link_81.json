        "text": "Gadsden, Ala. — Gadsden State Community College’s Theatre Department is bringing a classic play to the stage of Wallace Hall Fine Arts Center. “The Glass Menagerie” will be performed at 7 p.m. March 14-16 and at 2 p.m. March 17.\n\n“The Glass Menagerie” is a memory play by Tennessee Williams. It premiered in 1944 and catapulted the playwright from obscurity to fame.\n\n“The play has strong autobiographical elements, featuring characters based on its author, his histrionic mother and his mentally fragile sister,” said Joe Fuselli, director of the show and a theatre instructor.\n\nThe classic play tells the story of the Wingfield family, who live in Depression-era St. Louis. The play revolves around Amanda Wingfield, a Southern belle struggling to support her family, including her son Tom, who yearns for adventure and escape, and her daughter Laura, who is shy and fragile due to a physical disability. Amanda pushes Tom to find a suitor for Laura, leading to the arrival of Jim, a gentleman caller.\n\n“One cannot help but feel the desperation of the Wingfield family from the opening monologue to the final tableau,” Fuselli said. “For me, each character represents a period of struggle one may face in life.”\n\nHe said he’s impressed with the depth and the richness of Williams’ script and did not stray from the script in his direction.\n\n“Williams wanted a play of memory,” he said. “He had a vision of something almost otherworldly. I have tried my best to stay true to this vision. The story has transcended time. Why change it?”\n\nFuselli selected two casts for the performances of “The Glass Menagerie.” Performers are Jake Rhinehart and Jonas Abernathy as “Tom;” Madison Farrow and Lilly Barber as “Amanda;” Azya Elrod and Buffy Bailey as “Laura;” and Kadin Gardner and Ryan Kelley as “Jim.”\n\nGregory Heathcock is the theatre manager and technical director. Hunter Rogerson is the lighting designer, and Alyssa Farley is the box office manager.\n\nTickets are $10 for students and senior citizens and $12 for adults. They may be purchased at www.GadsdenState.edu/FineArts or at the door."
