        "text": "About the Work\n\n“The peak of my virtuosity was in the one- act plays. Some of which are like firecrackers on a rope.” Tennessee Williams\n\nTennessee Williams' lesser-known one act plays reveal a tantalizing and fascinating perspective to one of the world's most important playwrights.\n\nWritten between 1934 and 1980, the plays of the very young writer, then of the successful Tennessee Williams, and finally of the troubled man of the 1970s, this volume offers a panoramic yet detailed view of the themes, demons, and wit of this iconic playwright.\n\nThe volume depicts American life during the Great Depression and after, populated by a hopelessly hopeful chorus girl, a munitions manufacturer ensnared in a love triangle, a rural family that deals \"justice\" on its children, an overconfident mob dandy, a poor couple who quarrel to vanquish despair, a young \"spinster\" enthralled by the impulse of rebellion, and, in The Magic Tower, a passionate artist and his wife whose youth and optimism are not enough to protect their 'dream marriage.'\n\nThis collection gathers some of Williams's most exuberant early work and includes one-acts that he would later expand to powerful full-length dramas: The Pretty Trap, a cheerful take on The Glass Menagerie, and Interior: Panic, a precursor to A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\nAbout Table Reads\n\nThe Play Selection Advisory Committee of Athens Community Theatre hosts several opportunities to read plays and musicals for fun each season. Participation in a table read is a great way to “dip a toe in” to see what working with ACT is like. The play is read casually: you can let us know if you want to participate or just listen in. And you can change your mind at any time."
