        "text": "Sean Williams, a prison escapee indicted in connection with multiple counts of state and federal child sex charges as well as rape charges, has been captured in Florida after a month-long manhunt.\n\nOn Oct. 18, Williams escaped from a prison transport van while being moved from Kentucky to the U.S. District Court in Greeneville, Tennessee. When the van arrived at its destination, the back window of the van was kicked out and Williams was long gone.\n\nHis escape prompted a manhunt through Tennessee and North Carolina where Williams was spotted before his arrest in Florida on Tuesday. He had been added to Tennessee's Most Wanted list.\n\nHere is everything to know about Sean Williams' escape and case:\n\nWho is Sean Williams?\n\nWilliams, 51, was a successful businessman from Johnson City. He was an entrepreneur who owned a glass and concrete business. He was also a convicted felon known as an alleged cocaine dealer.\n\nHe had a history of being accused of sexual assault by various women in the city. Williams had been investigated several times, but no charges were ever brought against him until his arrest.\n\nIn April 2023, Williams was arrested on the campus of Western Carolina University after an officer saw him sleeping in his car. Inside his car were 12 ounces of cocaine, 14 ounces of methamphetamine, $100,000 cash, multiple electronic and digital storage devices, and two thumb drives containing more than 5,000 images of child pornography plus images and videos of 52 women in states of unconsciousness being sexually assaulted by Williams.\n\nWhen was Sean Williams captured?\n\nSean Williams was captured on Tuesday in Pinellas County, Florida. According to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, Williams was spotted in Largo late Monday. Tuesday evening, deputies were tipped off to his location at a Largo 7-11. Deputies arrived, tracked Williams with a K-9 and apprehended him.\n\nHow did Sean Williams escape?\n\nOn Oct. 18, Williams was transported from Kentucky to Greeneville for him to attend the U.S. District Court there. Somewhere between the original stop and their final destination, Williams knocked out the back window of the transport van and escaped. The officers driving the vehicle had no idea he got out until they arrived in Greeneville.\n\nWilliams was originally held in North Carolina but was moved to Kentucky because of another escape attempt back in July.\n\nAfter his escape, Williams had been spotted in various spots in western North Carolina before his eventual capture in Florida.\n\nWhat are the charges against Sean Williams?\n\nWilliams was indicted in September on multiple counts of child rape, sexual battery and sexual exploitation of a minor. He was later indicted on three counts of producing child pornography. All charges are on crimes spanning from 2008 to 2020.\n\nDuring one of his sexual assault investigations in 2020, police found a handwritten note in Williams' nightstand titled \"Raped\" with a list of the names of 21 women. After his arrest in April, it was determined that Williams had drugged and sexually assaulted more than 50 unconscious women with photo and video evidence. He is also accused of assaulting two children, the younger being under two years old.\n\nTwo lawsuits for failure to investigate\n\nThere is much controversy over Williams' case because of the number of accusations against him. Williams has been accused of sexual assault charges dating back to 2018.\n\nThere are now two lawsuits against the Johnson City because of the lack of urgency in investigating Williams.\n\nOne complaint is a whistleblower lawsuit filed by Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Kateri Dahl, a former federal prosecutor, who claims police disregarded her several requests for an investigation and Williams' arrest. After complaining to people outside the department, she was let go.\n\nDahl was on contract in Johnson City to monitor and prosecute drug and gun crimes. Williams' case was brought before her because police had found an illegal ammunition charge in his condo in 2020.\n\nIn April 2021, she was given a federal arrest warrant for Williams for being a felon in possession of ammunition. It was then that Williams fled to North Carolina where he was caught two years later on Western Carolina's campus.\n\nIn the second case, almost a dozen Jane Does claim that police deliberately chose not to look into many victim reports and discouraged them from filing criminal charges while Williams continued to conduct crimes.\n\nIn 2020, Williams was investigated for his relation to a woman severely injured after falling from a fifth-story window after meeting him at a bar. During the investigation, police found the \"Raped\" note, ammunition and electronic devices in his condo. Evidence of Williams's sexual assaults of multiple women was found on electronic devices retrieved from his condo following his arrest in April. The devices had been sitting in evidence storage since 2020.\n\nPrior to the release of an audit that examined sexual assault investigations from 2018 through 2022, the police chief and two other senior officers announced their early retirement. This audit discovered that officers' misperceptions about assault victims contributed to their failure to properly investigate sexual assault cases, gather evidence, speak with suspects, and make arrests.\n\nThe city says it is investing $100,000 into sexual assault training for its officers. It is also reviewing its investigative policies and procedures, but only time will tell if any change comes out of this."
