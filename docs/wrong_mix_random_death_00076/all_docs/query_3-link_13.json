        "text": "After having lived in Key West for only a few months, I realized its residents were some of the most open-hearted people I had ever met. The number of fundraisers and charities on our small island is quite impressive.\n\nI’m very fortunate to know two residents who exemplify the giving nature of Key West: Dennis Beaver and Bert Whitt. Dennis moved to the island in 1979 from New York City, while Bert arrived from Baltimore in 1993.\n\nThey support several local LGBT nonprofit organizations as well as island theaters. Dennis was a founding member of the Key West Business Guild, Metropolitan Community Church, and the Key West Gay and Lesbian Community Center.\n\nOn a personal note, the community-minded couple will celebrate their 20th anniversary together this coming February.\n\nIn 2011, the 100-anniversary mark of the birth of legendary playwright Tennessee Williams, Dennis met with the Key West Art & Historical Society to discuss ways to celebrate the life of Williams — who had been a Key West resident from 1949 to 1983.\n\n(Click here for a WPBT2/South Florida PBS video interview with Dennis Beaver about Williams’ intriguing life in Key West.)\n\nIn part because he had collected a great deal of the legendary gay playwright’s memorabilia, Dennis (with full support from Bert) decided to open up a Tennessee Williams exhibit.\n\nThe exhibit is located at 513 Truman Ave. and features what Dennis proudly calls “the largest permanent collection of Williams memorabilia currently available to the public.”\n\n“For both of us, the exhibit is a full-time volunteer pursuit, both challenging and interesting,” Bert said.\n\nIt includes an extensive collection of photographs (mostly taken in Key West), first-edition books, plays and even a typewriter used by Williams when he lived on the island. There’s also a print of an original painting the playwright completed at age 17, and one of his college yearbooks featuring a poem he wrote.\n\nThe curator continues to purchase artifacts and also receive them from donors on a regular basis. In fact, Dennis stated, “As Blanche says in ‘A Streetcar Named Desire,’ we depend on the kindness of strangers — and friends as well.”\n\nYearly fundraisers, grants and a membership program also help fund the exhibit. Both Dennis and Bert, and their board of directors, donate their time and efforts.\n\nHow many people are motivated to explore the collection during their stays in Key West?\n\n“At least 10,000 per year,” said Dennis. “Visitors from every state in the United States have signed the guest book.”\n\n“Recently, one of Tennessee Williams’ nieces visited the museum — and many international tourists visit,” added Bert, who also noted that writers and scholars use the museum as a resource.\n\nGay Key West loves to celebrate life with numerous events held throughout the year — including the Tennessee Williams Birthday Celebration each spring. The commemoration features showings of films based on some of Williams’ award-winning plays at our local Tropic Cinema, and painting, poetry, and short story contests. Theatrical presentations, a film forum and a birthday reception are also planned.\n\nThe Tennessee Williams Key West Exhibit is open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sundays from noon to 5 p.m. Admission is always free, but donations are very much appreciated.\n\nNext time you’re in Key West, make it a point to visit the fascinating exhibit. And check out the Tennessee Williams Birthday Celebration events scheduled for Feb. 26 through April 15."
