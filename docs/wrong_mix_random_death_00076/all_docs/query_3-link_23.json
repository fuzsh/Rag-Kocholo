        "text": "In 1980, Tennessee Williams presented the world premiere of his play \"Will Mr. Merriweather Return From Memphis?\" to debut the new Key West theater that bore his name.\n\nToday, celebrating its 25th season, the Tennessee Williams Theatre is an important center for Key West's cultural community and hosts regular productions by visiting and resident professional music and theatre companies.\n\n\"Like Tennessee Williams, the theater has played a significant role in enhancing Key West's reputation as a vibrant, flourishing creative community alive with musical, theatrical, artistic and literary richness,\" said executive director Rebecca Tomlinson.\n\nWilliams himself, a visual artist as well as an internationally renowned playwright, owned an unpretentious cottage on a quiet, tree-lined Key West side street from the late 1940s until his death.\n\nHe first visited in 1941 and returned several times, completing \"Summer and Smoke\" on the island in 1946, before purchasing the house that would become his home for the rest of his life. He wrote \"Night of the Iguana\" in Key West, among other works, and the Academy Award-winning film version of his \"The Rose Tattoo\" was shot there in 1956.\n\nWhen construction began on the theater complex on the campus of Florida Keys Community College, Williams interested himself in its progress and lent it his name. The 1980 debut of the 480-seat state-of-the-art facility was distinguished by the world premiere of his \"Mr. Merriweather.\"\n\nIn the 25 years since its opening, the Tennessee Williams Theatre has played host to local and traveling productions including \"Sleuth,\" \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" \"Porgy and Bess,\" \"La Cage Aux Folles\" and Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night,\" as well as appearances by renowned visiting companies like the Arturo O'Farrill Quartet, the Jos√© Limon Dance Company, Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo and Pilobolus Dance.\n\nAudiences also have flocked to see performances by stellar talents such as Cedar Walton, Cleo Laine and the John Dankworth Group and Leo Kottke.\n\nA variety of local and regional performance organizations call the Tennessee Williams Theatre home, including the vocal virtuosos of the Keys Chorale and the popular Key West Pops. The Key West Symphony, which features approximately 70 of the United States' foremost classical musicians and soloists, has staged its nationally acclaimed concerts at the venue since its debut in 1998.\n\nThe Florida Keys' innovative Island Opera Theatre, the swing superstars of the Paradise Big Band and local and regional musicians and groups also grace the stage at the Tennessee Williams Theatre. The Founders Society, presenters of performing arts in the Keys, brings extraordinary visiting productions and entertainers to the theater.\n\n\"As a service to visitors, the theater offers an on-line ticketing service, www.keystix.com, allowing them to plan their event attendance before their vacations and purchase tickets from their homes,\" said Tomlinson.\n\nIn addition, the venue is a versatile 480-seat conference and reception hall used for meetings, conventions, weddings, fundraising galas and other group events. Under the management of the Performing Arts Centers for Key West, the theater can coordinate the services of a professional catering company and has a full-time staff with production expertise to assist meeting and event planners.\n\nRecent renovations have enhanced the theater's ability to partner with Florida Keys lodging properties and meeting planners to present successful events in a modern, comfortable facility. Amenities include abundant free parking, handicap accessibility, and audiovisual, sound and lighting equipment.\n\n\"The Tennessee Williams Theatre is a full-service, multi-use rental resource for artistic, business and social events - the place to see and be \"scene\" in Key West and the Lower Keys,\" said Tomlinson.\n\nAs well as the theater itself, the spacious grand foyer is a popular venue for conferences, catered dinners and other events. The foyer also is a gallery showcasing the work of local visual artists and art students from the adjacent community college."
