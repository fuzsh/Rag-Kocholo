        "text": "In 1877, the Norwegian art historian Lorentz Dietrichson (1832–1917) took the initiative to establish the Christiania Copperplate and Hand Drawing Collection. An advertisement was placed in a newspaper to encourage benevolent collectors to donate to the newly created collection. In 1908, the collection formally became part of the National Gallery (today the National Museum). Two Piranesi prints were among the first donations made.\n\nThis was the beginning of the National Museum's collection of his art. The collection has grown since then and in the 1970s the museum was able to acquire works from the famous series Carceri d´'invenzione (Imaginary Prisons) which was published for the first time in 1749–1750 and then in an enlarged and heavily edited edition in 1761.\n\nThe series is an example of Piranesi's architectural fantasies. Here he moves away from dramatic but recognisable images of Rome to architectural representations that are surreal, almost hallucinatory, as he plays with spatial perspectives. The Carceri series has inspired artists, architects, filmmakers, writers and philosophers to the present day, and has contributed to the recognition of Piranesi as avant-garde, still relevant 300 years after his birth."
