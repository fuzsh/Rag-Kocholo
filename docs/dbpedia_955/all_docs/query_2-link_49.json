        "text": "SPRINGFIELD —The first exhibit of the D’Amour Museum of Fine Arts’ seven etchings by Giovanni Battista Piranesi is now on display, after being delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Fantastic Ruins: Etchings by Giovanni Battista Piranesi” attests to the grandeur, romance and superiority of imagination. “Throughout his career, Piranesi endeavored to produce great art and great ideas. He told his assistants as much, adding, ‘if I were commissioned to design a new universe, I would be mad enough to undertake it,’” said Maggie C. North, the Museums’ curator of art. “It was this determination that continued to fuel Piranesi’s creative ambition and his imaginative approach to etching. Visitors to this exhibition will come away with a sense of Piranesi’s ambition skill, and vision.”\n\nBorn and raised in Venice, Piranesi was fascinated by the ancient architecture of Rome, which he made his permanent home from 1747 until his death in 1778. Sometimes called “Rembrandt of the ruins,” Piranesi created etchings of the city and the surrounding region that employed dramatic angles and bold lighting effects to imbue crumbling structures with vitality and romance. Travelers of the time who embarked on the Grand Tour and passed though Rome often returned home with prints from Piranesi’s workshop.\n\nWhile inspired by actual views of Rome, Piranesi’s etchings are not precise transcriptions of what he saw. “Instead, they are aggrandized, fantastic visions of the ruins that he loved,” North said. “Piranesi was one of the most important printmakers of the 18th century, and his work is so incredibly fascinating. The opportunity to study original prints here in Springfield is a real gift.”\n\nAlthough singular prints have been exhibited over the years, this is the museum’s first display of all seven Piranesi etchings in the collection.\n\nThe prints in the exhibition were created in the 1760s and 1770s; the earliest work in this exhibition dates to about 1760.\n\nThe smallest etching measures about 19 inches high by 25 inches wide, and the largest is about 23 inches high by 33 inches wide. Each work is framed in simple, wooden frame measuring just over 28 inches high by 36 inches wide.\n\nAll etchings were printed with black ink on a slightly off-white paper that has likely deepened in color over time, North commented.\n\nPiranesi did not number his editions, so it is difficult to know how many impressions of each etching were created. “However, due to the strong market for Piranesi’s prints and the copies still in existence, we assume that there were numerous impressions,” she added.\n\nThe process of creating each etching began with an idea and a sketch. Although Piranesi made drawings of Roman ruins on site, his final compositions were often adjusted and infused with creative license in the studio, she continued. Each etching was created by working a series of lines into a copper plate that had been treated with an acid-resistant substance or varnish.\n\nPiranesi used a variety of sharp tools in different sizes to create the desired effects. A close look at the multiplicity of varied lines in each Piranesi print reveals the artist’s ability to combine the delicate marks of atmospheric backgrounds with darker, weightier marks that define the foreground. Once the artist’s image had been completely etched into the copper plate, it was bathed in acid, deepening the lines and leaving smooth areas protected. With the removal of the varnish, the plate was ready to be inked and pressed, a step for which Piranesi relied on the assistance of his staff. The prints, once dry, were sold as individual sheets or in collections.\n\n“The impressive reach and visual power of Piranesi’s prints, purchased by travelers in Rome and brought home to locations across the continent, shaped Europe’s collective imagination of Rome in the 18th century,” North said. “The prints on view in this exhibition were hugely influential when they were created and, today, they remain important (and enjoyable) artifacts of cultural memory.”\n\nThe etchings in this exhibition entered the Michele and Donald D’Amour Museum of Fine Arts’ permanent collection as gifts between 1940 and 2006.\n\n“While travel enthusiasts will appreciate seeing the sites that Piranesi depicted, art lovers will admire the artist’s technique and inspired approach,” North said. “Those interested in architecture may sympathize with Piranesi’s reverence for the great structures of ancient Rome or be inspired to learn more about the buildings depicted. However, I hope that all viewers will come away from this exhibit having shared in the sense of wonder that Piranesi experienced while standing in the shadow of Italy’s ruins.”\n\nThe subject matter of some works in this exhibition will be recognizable to visitors because the sites that Piranesi depicted continue to attract modern-day visitors to Rome. Especially recognizable is View of the Flavian Amphitheater, Called the Colosseum of about 1760. “Piranesi used an exaggerated perspective, but remained attentive to architectural details such as the different styles of columns on each story of the building,” North explained. While simple Doric columns are visible on the first level, Ionic columns occupy the middle level and are surmounted by columns in the ornate Corinthian style.\n\nThis exhibition also includes several prints depicting ruins located outside of Rome. The year before his death, Piranesi went to the site of the ancient city of Paestum, about 200 miles from Rome. North said it was there that he was inspired to produce the etching View of the Two Rows of Columns in the Temple of Neptune, which is on view in the exhibition: “This print, which features monumental columns that recede into the distance, speaks to the rediscovery of ancient ruins, a larger cultural phenomenon that swept Europe in the 18th century.”\n\nThis exhibit, which runs through July 17, features text in English and Spanish and is augmented by audio descriptions for visitors who are blind or have low vision.\n\nFor more information, go to springfieldmuseums.org.\n\n30"
