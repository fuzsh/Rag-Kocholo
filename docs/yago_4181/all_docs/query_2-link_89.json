        "text": "With its algorithmic power, an AI pieced together what Beethoven couldn’t finish.\n\nTo be fair, Beethoven was in very poor condition to complete what would be his 10th Symphony. So after 1827 when he passed away, we were sadly left with just musical fragments like a jigsaw puzzle with most pieces missing.\n\nBut in 2019 there was a second attempt at bridging those musical gaps with the help of AI. Much like predictive text in your emails, a team of music scientists, composers, and programmers were left with the task of turning AI into predicting Beethoven’s next musical notes for this unfinished piece.\n\nHere’s what this sonic adventure turned into.\n\nPiecing together a masterpiece from scattered notes\n\nThere wasn’t much to go by to finish this symphony.\n\nWhile Beethoven had started working on it, declining health prevented him from making significant progress, leaving only scattered musical sketches around.\n\nThe team had to face fragments like this to come up with a whole symphony."
