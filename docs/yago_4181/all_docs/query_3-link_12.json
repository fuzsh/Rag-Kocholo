        "text": "At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in its fall blockbuster show, “Manet/Degas,” is a painting from 1866 of a woman in the latest fashion. Victorine Meurent, Manet’s favorite model, stands in an empty room, accompanied only by a parrot on a bird stand. Her trademark red hair is tied back with a blue ribbon. Her head is slightly bowed as she smells a nosegay in her right hand: probably a gift from an absent admirer, just like the gentleman’s monocle in her left. She’s wearing a silk peignoir, which Manet has rendered in buttery strokes of pink and white. This is a full-length image, more than six feet tall, but Victorine hasn’t even put on her best clothes. She’s in a dressing gown, and the gown is amorphous. The gown is only paint.\n\nMost artists and audiences at the time did not think this was such a virtue. “Young Lady in 1866” got bad press at the Salon, the annual exhibition of France’s official art academy, where artists aspired to eternal beauty and eternal values, expressed through classicized motifs and highly finished surfaces. Thomas Couture, Manet’s own teacher, specialized in bloated but very technically proficient tableaux of nymphs and heroes. Only a few Parisians could see, in the thick pallor of Victorine’s face and the impetuous brushiness of her peignoir, the mark of a new cultural dispensation. Baudelaire, Manet’s great friend, articulated it in “The Flowers of Evil”:\n\nO Death, old captain, it’s time! Lift anchor!\n\nWe’re sick of this country, Death! Let us sail ...\n\nTo the depths of the Unknown to find something new!\n\nTo find something new! That was the imperative of modernism, not only in painting but also in poetry, in theater, in music, in architecture and eventually in the cinema. Your job as an artist was no longer to glorify the king or the church, nor to imitate as faithfully as possible the appearance of the outside world. It was to solder the next link in a cultural chain — fashioning a novel utterance that took novel shape even as it manifested its place in a larger history. “You have to be absolutely modern,” Rimbaud declared; “Make it new,” Ezra Pound instructed. To speak to your time, we once believed, required much more than new “content.” It required a commitment to new modes of narration, new styles of expression, that could bear witness to sea changes in society.\n\nManet, classically trained, figured out quickly that if he painted scenes of Parisian prostitutes in the same manner as his teacher painted Roman orgiasts, that wouldn’t cut it; he would have to invent a new kind of painting — flatter, franker — if he wanted to capture modern life. From then on, the creators who most decisively marked the history of art, again and again, described their work as a search for a new language, a new style, a new way of being. “I have transformed myself in the zero of form,” Kazimir Malevich wrote in 1915, and in his black square he found “the face of the new art.” Le Corbusier insisted that his open floor plans, enabled by reinforced floating columns, were not just an architectural aesthetic but an age: “Nothing is left to us of the architecture of past epochs, just as we can no longer derive any benefit from the literary and historical teaching given in schools.” Aimé Césaire, who would revolutionize French poetry in the 20th century as Baudelaire did in the 19th, understood that a modern Black expression required “a new language, capable of expressing an African heritage.” “In other words,” he said, “French was for me an instrument that I wanted to twist into a new way of speaking.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
