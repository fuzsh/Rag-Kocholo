        "text": "Pacific Symphony’s 2024-25 season, announced today, will be a year of tribute and transition.\n\nThe tribute is to music director Carl St.Clair, who will be marking his 35th year with the orchestra – the longest tenure of an American-born conductor among the nation’s major orchestras. St.Clair has made many programming choices that epitomize his approach: significant world premieres, classics from the 19th century, opera and collaborations with notable artists. Several of St.Clair’s programs hold special meaning for him and the orchestra.\n\nThe transition, of course, is to a post-St.Clair era. A succession of “guest” conductors, which began this season and continues in 2024-25, are presumably vying for St.Clair’s job. Next season will probably be St.Clair’s last as music director, although he will continue his association with the orchestra.\n\nPacific Symphony president John Forsyte said that St.Clair’s likely final season with the ensemble he has conducted since 1990 was carefully designed by the conductor as a fond farewell that touches upon some of his favorite works and the musicians’ strengths.\n\n“It’s a little hard to predict, but I’m hopeful we would know who Carl’s successor is for (the) 2025-26 (season). Carl planned this year to be a signature season. It’s a season he thinks of as his opportunity to say thank you to the musicians, the patrons and the audience that has supported him all these years.”\n\nForsyte said St.Clair has chosen works that are meaningful to him as well as his colleagues and longtime fans.\n\n“He’s built this wonderful rapport and synergy with the Pacific Chorale. Carl’s Carmina Burana is one of the most viscerally exciting (interpretations) you’ve ever heard. And it’s poignant that he finishes with Bruckner’s Seventh (symphony) and Verdi’s Requiem.”\n\nSt.Clair will also celebrate his European career as an opera conductor with the first-ever Pacific Symphony ring cycle performance: Wagner’s Das Rheingold. “I’m incredibly excited to hear Rheingold with our orchestra, that hall and some great singers,” Forsyte said. “And he’s picked an interesting director who did it in Seattle.”\n\nTwo newly commissioned works will receive their world premieres next season: a piano concerto by African American composer Adolphus Hailstork and an orchestral work by the orchestra’s current composer-in-residence, Viet Cuong.\n\n“I’m excited (we’ve) commissioned two American composers whose work I admire,” Forsyte said. “Hailstork is (a) venerable composer who has written many great works. We’re honored to be presenting that world premiere.”\n\nWoven into the season will be a few works that are near and dear to St.Clair and some evenings that will showcase individual musicians from the ranks, Forsyte said. “He has certain favorites – Pines of Rome, Strauss’ Alpine Symphony. And he wants to showcase musicians from the orchestra in a playful Halloween-inspired program and The Four Seasons, which will feature (concertmaster) Dennis Kim.”\n\nThe parade of guest conductors continues next season with Rune Bergmann, Paolo Bortolameolli, Valentina Peleggi, Eduardo Strausser and Christopher Warren-Green.\n\nForsyte wouldn’t say which of the visiting conductors is being considered for St.Clair’s position. “Rune we’ve worked with already and the musicians wanted to bring him back. Valentina has a great reputation as a relatively new music director.” (Peleggi has been music director of the Richmond Symphony since the 2020-21 season and recently renewed her contract through mid-2028.) “She’s done a terrific job developing that orchestra and building its reputation.”\n\nForsyte is also looking forward to a visit from Chilean-Italian conductor Bortolameolli, currently associate conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. “Paolo is very in demand right now. And Strausser was somebody who was very well liked by musicians and has been strongly recommended.”\n\nAfter the next music director takes up the baton, St.Clair will be given the title of music director laureate. Forsyte said the details of the position are up to St.Clair and the new conductor.\n\n“(Carl) has said he wants to make this as seamless as possible. He’ll definitely be appearing on the classical seasons at least several times and conducting some special projects. A lot depends on the interests of the new music director. Carl has said, ‘I want to be supportive of this person’s vision and help them succeed.’”\n\nPacific Symphony’s 2024-25 season\n\nAll concerts will be held at Renée and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall.\n\n* Indicates Pacific Symphony debut\n\n** Indicates first performance by Pacific Symphony\n\nOpening Night Celebration: Rachmaninoff and Beethoven\n\nThursday through Saturday, Sept. 26-28, 8 p.m.\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nClaire Huangci, piano\n\nTicheli: Shooting Stars\n\nRavel: Alborada del gracioso\n\nRachmaninoff: Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini\n\nBeethoven: Symphony No. 7\n\nClassical Spooktacular\n\nThursday through Saturday, Oct. 17-19, 8 p.m.\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nMeredith Crawford, viola\n\nWilliams: “Devil’s Dance” from Witches of Eastwick**\n\nBunch: The Devil’s Box**\n\nBerlioz: Symphonie Fantastique\n\nGluzman Plays Brahms\n\nThursday through Saturday, Nov. 14-16, 8 p.m.\n\nValentina Peleggi, conductor*\n\nVadim Gluzman, violin\n\nBarber: Symphony No. 1\n\nTchaikovsky: Francesca da Rimini\n\nBrahms: Violin Concerto\n\nArt of the Spanish Guitar\n\nThursday through Saturday, Dec. 5-7, 8 p.m.\n\nRune Bergmann, conductor\n\nMak Grgić, guitar*\n\nFung: Prayer**\n\nRodrigo: Fantasy for a Gentleman\n\nDvorak: Symphony No. 8\n\nFour Seasons and Strauss\n\nThursday through Friday, Jan. 9-11, 2025, 8 p.m.\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nDennis Kim, violin and leader\n\nTobias Melle, visuals\n\nVivaldi: The Four Seasons\n\nStrauss: Alpine Symphony (with visuals)\n\nPines of Rome\n\nThursday through Saturday, Feb. 6-8, 2025, 8 p.m.\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nJeffrey Biegel, piano\n\nBernstein: Slava!\n\nHailstork: Piano Concerto (world premiere)**\n\nCuong: World Premiere**\n\nRespighi: Pines of Rome\n\nCarmina Burana and Bach\n\nThursday through Saturday, Feb. 27-28, March 1, 2025, 8 p.m.\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nPacific Chorale\n\nRobert Istad, artistic director\n\nSouthern California Children’s Choir\n\nLori Loftus, founding director\n\nBenjamin Pasternack, piano\n\nAlisa Jordheim, soprano\n\nNicholas Phan, tenor\n\nHugh Russell, baritone\n\nLauridsen: O Magnum Mysterium\n\nBach: Keyboard Concerto in D minor, BWV 1052\n\nOrff: Carmina Burana\n\nKoh Plays Mendelssohn\n\nThursday through Saturday, March 20-22, 2025, 8 p.m.\n\nPaolo Bortolameolli, conductor*\n\nJennifer Koh, violin\n\nMendelssohn: Scherzo from A Midsummer Night’s Dream\n\nMendelssohn: Violin Concerto\n\nShostakovich: Symphony No. 10\n\nCurse of the Ring\n\nThursday, Saturday, and Tuesday, April 10, 12, and 15, 2025\n\nCarl St. Clair, conductor\n\nBrian Staufenbiel, stage director\n\nVocal soloists to be announced\n\nWagner: Das Rheingold**\n\nBeethoven’s Emperor\n\nMay 1-3, 2025\n\nEduardo Strausser, conductor\n\nGeorge Li, piano\n\nBeethoven Piano Concerto No. 5, “Emperor”\n\nMahler: Symphony No. 1\n\nCathedrals of Sound\n\nThursday through Saturday, May 8-10, 2025, 8 p.m.\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nPaul Jacobs, organ\n\nNorbertine Fathers of St. Michael’s Abbey\n\nTraditional: Gregorian Chant\n\nBach: Sinfonia in D minor\n\nGuilmont: Symphony No. 1**\n\nBruckner: Symphony No. 7\n\nVerdi’s Requiem\n\nJune 5-7, 2025\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nPacific Chorale\n\nRobert Istad, artistic director\n\nVocal soloists to be announced\n\nVerdi: Requiem\n\nSunday Matinees\n\nFantastic Symphony\n\nOct. 20, 2024\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nBerlioz: Symphonie Fantastique\n\nA Day in the Alps\n\nJanuary 12, 2025\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nTobias Melle, visuals\n\nStrauss: An Alpine Symphony (with visuals)\n\nCarmina Burana\n\nMarch 2, 2025\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nPacific Chorale\n\nRobert Istad, artistic director\n\nSouthern California Children’s Choir\n\nLori Loftus, founding director\n\nVocal soloists to be announced\n\nOrff: Carmina Burana\n\nRe-discover Verdi’s Requiem\n\nJune 8, 2025\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nPacific Chorale\n\nRobert Istad, artistic director\n\nVocal soloists to be announced\n\nVerdi: Requiem\n\nSPECIAL EVENTS\n\nHandel’s Glorious Messiah\n\nSunday, Dec. 8, 2024, 3 p.m.\n\nChristopher Warren-Green, conductor\n\nPacific Chorale,\n\nRobert Istad, artistic director\n\nVocal soloists to be announced\n\nHandel: Messiah\n\nLUNAR NEW YEAR CELEBRATION\n\nSaturday, Feb. 1, 2025, 8 p.m.\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nVoice and the Violin\n\nThursday, Feb. 13, 2025, 8 p.m.\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nJoshua Bell, violin\n\nLarissa Martinez, soprano\n\nNowruz: Iranian New Year\n\nSaturday, March 23, 2025, 8 p.m.\n\nCarl St.Clair, conductor\n\nJohn Forsyte, who is quoted in this story, is a member of the Advisory Board for Culture OC."
