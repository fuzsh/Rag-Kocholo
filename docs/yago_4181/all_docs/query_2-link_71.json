        "text": "Andrew Litton, Music Director of the New York City Ballet, GRAMMY Award winner, and accomplished pianist, will be conducting from the keyboard while performing Beethoven’s Triple Concerto. Though the violin-cello-piano combination is often heard in chamber music ensembles, it is much rarer as a trio of three soloists with orchestra. The concerto will feature Cellist and 2018 Sphinx Medal of Excellence Winner, Christine Lamprea, and the CSO’s Concertmaster, Yuriy Bekker. Litton, Lamprea, and Bekker will shine in one of Beethoven’s most soulful, challenging, and charming concertos.\n\nArguably the most significant Soviet-era composer of the last century, Dmitri Shostakovich was condemned and stifled during the Stalin era. Though it is a mystery to pinpoint exactly when his Tenth Symphony was written (between 1946-1953), it is a work of masterful emotional outpouring likely inspired by this suffering. Like his predecessor Tchaikovsky, the composer employed waltzes and militaristic drums intermingled with the symphony’s musical themes and motifs to convey dramatic momentum, heart-wrenching longing, and slow despair. It’s not all doom and gloom, however; the fourth movement—after a final frenzied return of anguish—ushers in a promising moment of triumph and victorious release."
