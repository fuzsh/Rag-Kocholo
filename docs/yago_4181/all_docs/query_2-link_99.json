        "text": "The Rhapsody in Red, White & Blue project by composer Peter Boyer and pianist Jeffrey Biegel continues to expand its reach, securing performance commitments from 54 orchestras in all 50 of the United States. In addition, reaching beyond the United States to achieve an international presence, Boyer and Biegel recorded the new Rhapsody with the world-renowned London Symphony Orchestra for the acclaimed Naxos American Classics Series. Naxos will release this recording on February 23, 2024, with a two-week exclusive period for Apple Music beginning February 9, 2024.\n\nBiegel, a prolific pianist with an extraordinary record of commissioning new works for piano and orchestra, commissioned Boyer to compose this new work in celebration of the centennial of George Gershwin’s iconic Rhapsody in Blue (premiered February 12, 1924). Since 2020, Biegel has pursued a highly ambitious “Rhapsody National Initiative,” with the goal of performing Boyer’s new work with at least one orchestra in each of the 50 United States. As of January 2024, this remarkable vision has been fulfilled, and Boyer’s new Rhapsody will be performed by orchestras in all 50 states by the 2026-27 season (details below). This is believed to be an unprecedented feat for a new concerto by an American composer.\n\nThe Rhapsody in Red, White & Blue was recorded with Biegel as soloist, and Boyer conducting the London Symphony Orchestra at the famed AIR Studios, Lyndhurst Hall on November 27, 2023. Simon Rhodes, Senior Engineer at Abbey Road Studios, known for his work on projects such as the first two Harry Potter film scores, the Avatar film scores, and hundreds of classical albums and other film scores, was producer and engineer for the recording. Naxos will release the Rhapsody recording on February 23, 2024.This is Boyer’s fourth recording for the American Classics Series, and his third recording with the LSO as composer and conductor. (Photos by Benjamin Ealovega)\n\nBoyer’s ca. 18-minute Rhapsody was premiered on June 30, 2023, with Biegel and the Utah Symphony conducted by Benjamin Manis, on the opening night of the Deer Valley Music Festival in Park City, Utah. An outdoor audience of more than 3,000 rewarded the new work with a prolonged standing ovation — a reaction which has been repeated by audiences at each subsequent performance.\n\nThe following orchestras and conductors are participating in the “Rhapsody National Initiative” (as of 1/17/24):\n\n01 Aberdeen University/Civic Symphony (SD), Christopher Stanichar, conductor\n\n02 Arapahoe Philharmonic (CO), Devin Patrick Hughes, conductor\n\n03 Augusta Symphony Orchestra (GA), Dirk Meyer, conductor\n\n04 Brevard Symphony Orchestra (FL), Christopher Confessore, conductor\n\n05 Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra (NY), Stuart Chafetz, conductor\n\n06 Butler Philharmonic (OH), Scott Woodard, conductor\n\n07 Central Ohio Symphony (OH), Jaime Morales-Matos, conductor\n\n08 Duluth Superior Symphony Orchestra (MN), Dirk Meyer, conductor\n\n09 East Tennessee Symphony Orchestra (TN), Jeremy Francisco, conductor\n\n10 Endless Mountain Music Festival (PA), Stephen Gunzenhauser, conductor\n\n11 Evanston Symphony Orchestra (IL), Lawrence Eckerling, conductor\n\n12 Fargo-Moorhead Symphony Orchestra (ND), Christopher Zimmerman, conductor\n\n13 Fairfax Symphony Orchestra (VA), Christopher Zimmerman, conductor\n\n14 Greater Bridgeport Symphony (CT), conductor TBD\n\n15 Gulf Coast Symphony (FL), Andrew Kurtz, conductor\n\n16 Idaho State Civic Symphony (ID), Nell Flanders, conductor\n\n17 Juneau Symphony (AK), Christopher Koch, conductor\n\n18 Kamuela Philharmonic (HI), Brian Dollinger, conductor\n\n19 Lake Washington Symphony Orchestra (WA), Michael Miropolsky, conductor\n\n20 Las Cruces Symphony (NM), Ming Luke, conductor\n\n21 Lubbock Symphony Orchestra (TX), David Cho, conductor\n\n22 Mid-Atlantic Symphony Orchestra (DE, MD), Michael Repper, conductor\n\n23 Mid-Texas Symphony (TX), Akiko Fujimoto, conductor\n\n24 Missoula Symphony Orchestra (MT), Julia Tai, conductor\n\n25 The Missouri Symphony (MO), Wilbur Lin, conductor\n\n26 Montgomery Symphony Orchestra (AL), Jamie Reeves, conductor\n\n27 Muscatine Symphony Orchestra (IA), Brian Dollinger, conductor\n\n28 New England Music Camp (ME), Simon Gollo, conductor\n\n29 New Hampshire Philharmonic Orchestra (NH), Mark Latham, conductor\n\n30 New Jersey Youth Symphony (NJ), Helen Cha-Pyo, conductor\n\n31 North Charleston Pops (SC), Nick Palmer, conductor\n\n32 North Mississippi Symphony Orchestra (MS), Steven Byess, conductor\n\n33 Orchestra Omaha (NE), Kenneth Meints, conductor\n\n34 Pacific Symphony (CA), Carl St.Clair, conductor\n\n35 Paducah Symphony Orchestra (KY), Raffaele Ponti, conductor\n\n36 Peninsula Music Festival (WI), Rune Bergmann, conductor\n\n37 Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra (RI), Aram Demirjian, conductor\n\n38 Rogue Valley Symphony (OR), Martin Majkut, conductor\n\n39 Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra (WA), Juan Felipe Molano, conductor\n\n40 Shreveport Symphony (LA), Michael Butterman, conductor\n\n41 Signature Symphony (OK), Scott Seaton, conductor\n\n42 South Arkansas Symphony Orchestra (AK), Kermit Poling, conductor\n\n43 South Bend Symphony Orchestra (IN), Alastair Willis, conductor\n\n44 Southern Arizona Symphony Orchestra (AZ), Linus Lerner, conductor\n\n45 Southwest Symphony (UT), Lucas Darger, conductor\n\n46 Springfield Symphony Orchestra (MA), Peter Boyer, conductor\n\n47 Traverse Symphony Orchestra (MI), Kevin Rhodes, conductor\n\n48 UNLV Symphony Orchestra (NV), Taras Krysa, conductor\n\n49 Utah Symphony (UT), Benjamin Manis, conductor\n\n50 Vermont Youth Orchestra (VT), Mark Alpízar, conductor\n\n51 Western Piedmont Symphony (NC), Matthew Troy, conductor\n\n52 West Virginia State Philharmonic Orchestra (WV), Scott Woodard, conductor\n\n53 Wichita Symphony Orchestra (KS), Daniel Hege, conductor\n\n54 Wyoming Symphony Orchestra (WY), Christopher Dragon, conductor\n\nAn impressive array of notable artists from the classical and pop music fields have endorsed the “Rhapsody National Initiative,” including David Foster, Neil Sedaka, Emanuel Ax, Leonard Slatkin, JoAnn Falletta, Melissa Manchester, and Charles Strouse. An especially meaningful endorsement came from Marc Gershwin, nephew of George Gershwin, bringing the imprimatur of the Gershwin family to the project. With prominent orchestra executives included also, the project has received more than 40 endorsements.\n\n“I can’t wait to witness this incredible collaboration celebrating 100 years of one of the world’s most treasured compositions, Rhapsody in Blue, with my dear friend Jeffrey Biegel at the piano. No one brings the essence of Gershwin and his genius more to our ear than J-man — as I like to call him. He, like Gershwin’s music, is world class! What a fantastic idea to commission the uber-talented Peter Boyer to help celebrate this milestone with his composition, Rhapsody in Red, White & Blue. […] Congrats to all involved — I will be cheering from the sidelines!!!” — David Foster, 16-time Grammy-winning composer, pianist, songwriter, producer\n\nA perusal score and complete demo recording of Boyer’s Rhapsody may be found here.
