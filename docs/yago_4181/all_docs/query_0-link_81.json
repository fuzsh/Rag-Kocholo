        "text": "Abel Gance's Napoleon set for cinema re-release after digital restoration.\n\nA new chapter in the story of one of the classics of silent cinema is about to begin as Abel Gance’s legendary epic, Napoleon (1927), is re-released in all of its operatic glory.\n\nA new digitally restored version of the cinematic triumph, courtesy of the BFI and director and historian Kevin Brownlow, will hit cinemas in autumn 2016 complete with a bravura score written by Carl Davis.\n\nThe legendary film was first presented, partially restored, at the BFI London Film Festival in 1980 and the latest digital restoration will have its premiere screening with a live performance by the Philharmonia Orchestra of Davis’ score (the longest ever composed for a silent film) in early November 2016 at the Royal Festival Hall.\n\nRunning at over five-and-a-half hours on screen, the film demands a huge investment of resources, from projectionists, musicians, conductor and audiences; the live performance with intervals adds up to over eight hours from start to finish.\n\nBut it is acknowledged as one of the most richly rewarding and thrilling experiences in the history of cinema, with an intense pairing of music and film that have seen it compared to grand opera.\n\nEarly life of Napoleon\n\nDazzling scenes include full-scale historical recreations of episodes from the early life of Napoleon – from the French Revolution to the arrival of French troops in Italy marking the beginning of the First Italian campaign of 1796.\n\nBrownlow, who first saw a 9.5mm version of the film as a schoolboy in 1954, went on a suitably epic journey of over 50 years to track down surviving prints of the film from archives around the world. As a result audiences will be able to see the film’s original tinting and toning, including colour combinations, which could not be achieved in the existing 35mm print.\n\nIntegration of sections sourced from a wide range of elements have also been improved by detailed digital image repair, alignment and an extensive digital clean up throughout.\n\nDescribing the film as “a landmark in the history of cinema” BFI Creative Director, Heather Stewart said: “Several generations of staff at the BFI have worked on this project. Napoleon is a landmark in the history of cinema and we are grateful to all of the great talents who have helped us along the way but especially, of course, Kevin Brownlow for his indefatigable championing of the film and Carl Davis for his amazing score.”\n\nFollowing its premiere Napoleon will be released in cinemas UK wide in a music-synched version with a simultaneous BFI Blu-ray/DVD release. It will also be available to view on BFI Player."
