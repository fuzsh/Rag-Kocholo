My experience of this album on CD has been of a very clean, slightly bright and thin sound ...\n\nRameau: Keyboard Suites - Hewitt | Stephen Wright - July 28, 2024\n\nI know this is an old SACD - but what a stunner! Every one of Hewitt's SACDs I've heard is a treasure, so I've ordered the lot of 'em, irrespective of price or repertory ...\n\nBruckner: Symphony No. 7, Bates: Resurrexit - Honeck | Rudolf de Vries - August 17, 2024\n\nI recently downloaded this recording from the Native dsd website in the dxd (32 bit) format. Bruckner is one of my favorite composers, I always loved his 7th symphony, really ...\n\nJohn Coltrane: Live at the Village Vanguard | Downunderman - August 18, 2024\n\nThis version was released in May 2024 and the jacket advises it is mastered by Ryan Smith of Sterling Sound. The Obi. advises it as \"Verve Label Group 2024 DSD\". It is a ...\n\nLux - Brevik | Robert Fernandes - August 3, 2024\n\nWell said Marcus!\n\nDvořák: Symphonies 6-9 - Davis | hiredfox - August 19, 2024\n\nDvorak's 9th was also a SACD recording, part of the SCD Anthology set.\n\nYes: The Yes Album | Downunderman - August 6, 2024\n\nAgree with Analogue on this one. Really surprisingly good.\n\nCarpenter: Complete Ballets - Rose | Mick Head - August 21, 2024\n\nUnique period in American music in this, BMOP's 100th release. Sure, these works are a bit \"of their time.\" That doesn't mean they're not worth hearing. The composer had ...\n\nDvořák: Symphonies 6-9 - Davis | John Broggio - August 17, 2024\n\nAlso Smetana: Má vlast - Davis\n\nMozart: Symphonies 34-36 - Collins | Jan Arell - August 21, 2024\n\nRecorded in 24/196. A heavy 6GB download from eclassical. Very fresh accounts of well known music. SQ is very good even for a Bis recording."
