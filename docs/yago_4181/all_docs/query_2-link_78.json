        "text": "Hindsight is 10/10 is a new column where we revisit albums that have not received the acclaim they deserve.\n\nFor the king for the land for the mountains\n\nFor the green valleys where dragons fly,\n\nFor the glory the power to win the black lord,\n\nI will search for the emerald sword.\n\nI am here to write an essay on an album for a series called Hindsight 10/10. I signed up to do this since I really enjoy writing about music, especially when I don't have to actually review anything. There will be a review, I promise. This review will be for Rhapsody's Symphony of Enchanted Lands, but it will be towards the end. Since this is a metal website, and probably should be about a metal album, we are going to travel back to the beginning of my relationship with metal when I was in college. Up until that point, I never really listened to metal, a fact that has never come up when writing for metal magazines or moderating r/metal, since I am very good at pretending I have always known what's going on. With that said, my love for Rhapsody started there, and is complicated and wonderfully convoluted, as my experience with this Italian symphonic power metal band came through a jumbled stack of burned CDs.\n\n...\n\nSymphony of Enchanted Lands by Rhapsody\n\n...\n\nIn the early and mid 2000's, most of our music came through the internet in the form of downloaded videos from Limewire and torrenting entire discographies from places like Kazaa, EMule, Soulseek and later private sites like Oink. We were in college and instead of drugs or alcohol, we experimented with downloading media and later became addicted to piracy. For anyone who lived through the same era, our story was perhaps not unique. It was a time of unsupervised plundering of media, which was fueled by the chaos of access to a whole new world of music tastes and preferences. It didn't matter if you never heard of a band or genre or song, the discography was free, so it would be stupid not to grab it. The media would then be transferred onto spindles of burned CDs, which sat like towers by our shared desktop computer only to be shared with people who came over for parties. Though the morality of this action could be debated and I have no real arguments to make, I feel I wouldn't have experienced the level of music immersion without this unfettered access--something that is oddly similar to the streaming platforms of today. I almost certainly wouldn't have tried \"metal music,\" something that I knew was on the radio through bands like Limp Bizkit, Korn, or any extreme bands with gross names. Without dodgy websites and virus-laden software, I almost certainly wouldn't have discovered \"Rain of a Thousand Flames\" by Italian power metal band Rhapsody.\n\nIf you haven't seen the music video for \"Rain of a Thousand Flames,\" I would suggest going searching for it. I'm not linking it here since it has a baffling amount of nudity. Just imagine a lower-quality copy of it in a folder on our desktop computer that would be opened at parties while we all played Halo 2. My circle of friends spent a lot of time watching cult and garbage-tier action movies throughout this time, and finding something like this video ignited a fever that was shared by all of us. Our laughter would continue while we downloaded the band's entire discography in crisp, clear 128 kbps. Rhapsody's catalog, at the time, was everything from Legendary Tales (1997) to Dark Secret Saga EP (2004). We burned everyone CDs and, though the actual tracklist for those CDs are lost to time, Spotify's \"This Is Rhapsody\" is a close approximation to the songs that were important to us. It was through these CDs that I became aware that every album from this band was telling some long and complex fantasy story--a fact that made me laugh even louder and love even deeper.\n\nIt is important to look at music not just subjectively. Obviously my love for Rhapsody melded with a time when I had a very large group of friends and little responsibility, limitless energy, and an unwritten future ahead. Everything was new and it was a time when I used ironic enjoyment to find things I actually loved without laughter. What was once kindled in college led to an adulthood spent reading large fantasy novels that would dominate my bookshelves. What was once a chaotic mess of burned CDs soon became a focus on a few albums. It would be one thing to think of Rhapsody as the band that made all of us laugh, but that would also do a disservice to a group that has worked tirelessly through decades to weave complex music with stories.\n\nSymphony of Enchanted Lands came when the band was on their rise to popularity following their 1997 debut, Legendary Tales. Their sophomore record, released in 1998, expanded the sound as well as participating musicians. The core members, Luca Turilli, Alex Staropoli, and Fabio Lione, all contributed to the story which continued their debut's narrative. Known as \"The Emerald Sword Saga,\" the epic would eventually span across the band's first four records. Through the language of symphonic power metal, Symphony of Enchanted Lands saw Loregard, the Son of Holy Ice and his quest to retrieve the Emerald Sword from a distant realm called The Legends of Chaos. There, he encounters hellish creatures as well as being rescued by a magical dragon named Tharos. During a mighty battle, and told in the theater of a lengthy closing song, Tharos becomes mortally wounded but ushers Loregard back to safety before returning to Dragonland to die peacefully.\n\nIt would not be exaggerating that Rhapsody allowed me to comfortably enjoy high fantasy. Though this enjoyment came in the form of initial irony, Rhapsody showed me a world that lay beyond the Lord of the Rings DVDs, which we all watched throughout college. It was a form of fantasy I enjoyed despite (or maybe because) of the garish tropes. I remember the outlandish characters and predictable storylines as not being particularly exceptional but so unmistakable in its genre that I immediately fell in love. This was not the faux machismo that Manowar had to offer, but an immense world about enchanted swords told with such sincere conviction and throughout multiple albums. The music told of the rise of the Black Lord and the unification of kingdoms to push back the encroaching darkness. There were no gray areas or complex characters. There was only good and evil, and even though you could guess the end of the story, this was less about being surprised and more about being comforted by things you expected. Symphony of Enchanted Lands, as well as the entire discography of Rhapsody, was a hero's story sung through anthemic choruses and we sang them all throughout the night while playing games like Oblivion.\n\n...\n\n...\n\nIt is impossible to whisk someone away to that apartment decades in the past. Symphony of Enchanted Lands, however, comes close to materializing the feeling we all shared. The album serves as the band's most accessible entry point, with some of Rhapsody's most iconic songs including \"Emerald Sword,\" \"Wisdom of the Kings\" and \"Wings of Destiny.\" The album also has lengthy songs such as \"Dark Tower of the Abyss\" and the eponymous title track, which would serve as a portent to future albums that have staggering closers. \"Symphony of Enchanted Lands\" is ostentatious and possesses an energy that sometimes surpasses its own material means. The narrative, which ran through this album and others, became an optional side quest for me to look through and piece together from various places on the internet and in lyrics. I started to realize that the books I eventually would have on my shelf that acted as bookends to smaller books were most likely inspired by the ridiculous narrative started in these records and most certainly showcased on this album.\n\nToday on the modern internet, we have a more organized way of experiencing Rhapsody, save for the fact their original narrative which ran through two sagas has almost been forgotten. Outside of cursory mentions on Wikipedia and people's memories of the band's website, the story of The Emerald Sword Saga, as well as its sequel, The Dark Secret Saga, has disappeared. What was once text that lived on static websites has now been taken down, since we no longer live in an era where websites are used as they once were. In fact, the most complete collection of the fantasy prose and lyrics now reside in fan made documents. The only place I found them when searching for a summary of the Emerald Sword Saga was a Reddit thread.\n\nPerhaps this is why I am so entranced with the idea of an ongoing narrative, as the time and craft spent by the band has been forgotten over the years, much like tomes and prophecies showcased in the band's albums. I can not force a band to care about the things they did in the past, and Rhapsody of Fire's current care in crafting a narrative is certainly appreciated. The idea of making albums based on ongoing stories might seem exhausting when one spends a decade doing it. Perhaps I'm just saving it as a vestige from a time when I was really excited about colorful knights riding on dragons. I loved reading it despite the fact that I have read better fantasy in the decades since. Listening to albums such as Symphony of Enchanted Lands and reading the PDF narrative reminds me of a time when everything was sparkly and eternally fun.\n\nI followed Rhapsody in their career as I traveled through my own adulthood. My dramas were mirrored with the band as they went through their own. From name changes to legal fights with their record label to having the band split into parallel bands, the saga of Rhapsody of Fire (their legal name now) at times sounded like something out of the fairytales they used to write. I do not want to make it seem like I am disparaging the current work of the group as 2019's The Eighth Mountain is possibly the best album by the group in a decade. 2024 saw the release of Challenge of the Wind, the conclusion of The Nephilim's Empire Saga, a quiet and seemingly separate new narrative which is even more obscure, narratively than the other two previous storylines.\n\nEven though I very much enjoy listening to all of Rhapsody of Fire's catalog (and bands who take inspiration from their style), Symphony of Enchanted Lands remains a 10/10 for me. I am very much of the opinion that perfect albums take a while to gestate and nothing can be perfect without time and context built around it. The reasons and history which surround this album make it perfect for me. Much like the band, there are flaws and moments that are less than perfect, but for me, these things are a part of its perfection. It's been many years since I began discovering metal and bands that sang about dragons and had big long ass stories within their lyrics. Symphony of Enchanted Lands, though, remains a memory of that strange time with legally questionable hobbies.\n\n..."
