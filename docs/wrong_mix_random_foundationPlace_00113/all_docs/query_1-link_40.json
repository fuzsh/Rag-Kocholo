        "text": "photo of owners (l-r) Dean Martin and Jerry Martin\n\nDecorating your home can be intimidating, particularly when choosing something like flooring which will be with you for a long time. That’s where the interior designers at West River Carpet Inc. can help you make decisions. For instance, trends can be fun, but when it comes to decorating, trends can be “dangerous,” says Dean Martin, who with his brother Jerry Martin owns the carpet and flooring store at 4627 West River Drive in Comstock Park. “Trends…date your home,” said Dean Martin, designer at the family-owned store, who suggests doing trends “with easily changeable things like accessories.” Also ask yourself “what do you love?” he said, adding that when it comes to your home, “Your interior should reflect your personality.”"
