With a non-stop parade of spot-on impressions that will not only amaze but also make you laugh until your sides hurt! It’s the perfect cocktail of music and fun brought to you by one of the most exceptional talents Vegas has to offer. Recently completing his 700th show in Las Vegas to another standing room only audience, the charismatic Stevens is heralded by his growing legion of fans as the best singer-impressionist performing today. His enchanting show has garnered the reputation as one show that audiences want to return to again and again. Legendary comedian Rich Little recently attended one of Tom’s shows and commented, “Tom has Dean down to finest details — voice, mannerisms and stage presence.” Whatever you do, don’t miss this show!"
