        "text": "High School Photo, 1960\n\nOur purpose\n\nWe contribute to this by providing educational support for the next generation\n\nThe Jimmie L. Dean Scholarship Foundation, Inc. was established in 2008 from the generous gift of Jimmie L. Dean for one simple reason, to help reduce the “brain drain” from Oklahoma of losing the state’s young adults to other states. Our purpose is to contribute to this by providing educational support for the next generation of productive Oklahomans in moving the state forward. This critical investment in these young citizens is to help them in completing their post high school education and help expedite them to becoming an asset to the Sooner state without being burdened by an anchor of debt hindering their ability to fully contribute to this state’s economy.\n\nJimmie was a lifelong resident of Washington County, Oklahoma who believed that through hard work, individual responsibility and education, a person can achieve their highest goals and dreams. Jimmie’s life was an example of following those beliefs as he came from a working class family in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Jimmie was the youngest of 5 children of Marion and Maude Dean. His grandfather, father and older brother were all self employed plumbers. He attended and graduated from Bartlesville High School in 1960 and then went on to serve in the United States Navy as an aircraft mechanic from 1961-1966. After being honorably discharged from the Navy, he began a 33 year career with Phillips Petroleum Company, retiring in 1999. While working at Phillips Jimmie’s work received recognition from his peers and he innovated and developed solutions, even receiving a patent in 1992. During his lifetime Jimmie prudently managed his financial affairs and upon his death in 2008, directed his estate to organize a not-for-profit charitable corporation; and through a testamentary gift, his estate is the original contributor to the Jimmie L. Dean Scholarship Foundation, Inc.\n\nThe beliefs of\n\nhard work, individual responsibility and education\n\nThe Foundation exists today to fulfill the virtues and honor the legacy of Jimmie by awarding scholarships to individuals who have grown up in Oklahoma that have and continue to exemplify the same beliefs of hard work, individual responsibility and education for attendance at an Oklahoma accredited College, University or Technical School.\n\nJimmie in the Navy\n\nCandidates for an award from the Foundation should show achievement in their educational studies, leadership, personal responsibility and character. The awards are targeted to assist those who have worked hard and contributed in providing for their own financial needs while maintaining a solid academic record. Family income does not factor into the decision for an award as the Foundation looks for students who have held a paying job and has shown personal responsibility in their life to prepare themselves for a formal education beyond high school.\n\nEach Scholarship Award granted can be up to $10,000 per academic school year with the actual amount of each award determined by the Foundation. We expect the average award to be less than $10,000 and the actual number of awards will be determined after all applications are received and reviewed.\n\nThe awards are meant to supplement financial aid for students to eliminate or minimize the amount of loans and family contributions required to achieve their educational aspirations. Awards are for one academic school year and can be used for academic year’s tuition and academic related fees and a reasonable allowance for room and board, as determined by the Foundation. The final eligibility will take these charges and deduct other awards and scholarships the student has received, with this award filling in the gap. A Scholarship recipient may apply for a renewal each year but can only be awarded an additional scholarship or grant four (4) times for a total of five (5) years of awards up to $50,000 over the five (5) years.\n\nJune, 1999\n\nWe are looking for students who have exhibited the traits of Jimmie throughout their life. While every application will be carefully considered and evaluated, the candidates that are seeking to major in a technical field of study, have helped provide for their own financial support while growing up in Oklahoma, and have a strong desire to remain in Oklahoma after graduation with their four year degree will be given preference. Students will also have demonstrated academic achievement by obtaining an ACT score of 25 or higher if attending a college or university and a 17 if attending Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology in Okmulgee. Students who are not pursuing a major in a technical field but have a compelling story of how they fit into the qualities of this Foundation may be considered as well.\n\nHowever, some of the majors we do not accept are the arts, business, criminal justice, journalism. political science, sociology, pre-law, psychology, religious studies, or social sciences,\n\nSince our first awards granted in the 2010 – 2011 academic year, the Foundation granted over $1,000,000 in awards with individual awards ranging from $1,500 to $10,000 per year."
