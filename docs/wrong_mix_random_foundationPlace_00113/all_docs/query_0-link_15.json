bad that Christmas only comes once a year, and I'm pretty sure everybody feels that way.\n\nIt may be a little hectic with shopping and wrapping gifts, but it's all worth it, because this time of the year when old friends and family get together sure gives me a warm feeling to be able to share Christmas with my family and such good friends as Frank and his family.\n\nAnd that's Frank's daughter, Nancy.\n\nYou met her earlier this evening, she's a beauty.\n\nWhen Frank sings \"Nancy With the Laughing Face,\" that's the pretty face he's singing about.\n\nAnd that's my oldest son, Craig.\n\nI was -- I was proud of him right from the start, I took one look at him and decided to have six more.\n\nAnd he's one of the six, my boy, Dean Junior -- he's a good kid.\n\nHe just bought himself a new electric guitar with the money he saved by not taking haircuts.\n\nAnd, oh, that's Frank's daughter, Tina, and two of my daughters, Deana and Gina.\n\nTina, Deana and Gina.\n\nMost families name their children after relatives.\n\nWe use a rhyming dictionary.\n\nHmm.\n\nThose are my daughters Claudia and Gail, and Frank Junior again.\n\nNow, Frank takes after his old man -- looks like he's starting his own fan club, doesn't it?\n\nHere's a lady I talk about every week.\n\nThat's because I love her so much, a wonderful mother and a great wife.\n\nAnd lucky for me, she's got such a marvelous sense of humor.\n\nMy own Jeannie.\n\nOh, and that's my youngest boy, Ricci.\n\nI'll tell you, now, I'll tell you what they're laughing at -- last night, Jeannie asked Ricci to dry the dishes.\n\nHe did it the easy way -- he stuck them in a toaster.\n\nWell, now that you've met everybody, why don't you join us?\n\nFrank, isn't this real nice?\n\nHmm?\n\n-If it was any nicer, I get a feeling I was in Pat Boone's house.\n\n-Aww!\n\nHey, Ken, I'm sure happy you came over tonight and I'm happy you brought your celeste with you.\n\n-Oh, that was no problem at all, Dean -- my wife helped me load it on the bus.\n\n[ Laughter ] -Joke... -Now that -- now that we're all here like this, why don't we get something going?\n\n-Yeah, how about a couple of Christmas songs, hmm?\n\n-Good idea.\n\n♪ Oh, there's no

Christmas, 'cause all of us here are going to put these toys under a lot of Christmas trees.\n\n-Hey, Dean?\n\n-Yeah?\n\n-You ever see one of these before?\n\n[ Squeaking ] -Sure, every morning, when

$100,000 worth of toys, including a lot of dolls, just like this one to send out to our little friends all over the country.\n\nSo, Santa, you better get an empty bag 'cause we're going to fill it up for you.\n\nAnd you can start by sending a lot of toys to Holy Family Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\n-And I hope all the boys and girls at the Hope Haven Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida, are watching because, Christmas morning, your stockings will be full too.\n\n-And Santa Claus remembered all you boys and girls at D.J.\n\nNeely Children's Center in Detroit, Michigan, too.\n\n-And all your kids at the Ohio Valley Hospital in Steubenville, Ohio, you better meet Santa on the lawn, because he can't get all the toys we're sending you down that chimney.\n\n-We're also sending a big Christmas hug along with all the toys to you kids at New England Home for Little Wanderers in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n-Gail, you've got some special charity for some of these toys?\n\n-Yes, we're sending some to Children's Orthopedic Hospital in Gastonia, North Carolina.\n\n-And to all the boys and girls at St. James Orphanage in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n-And Nancy, don't forget the wonderful children of New York Foundling Hospital in New York City.\n\n-And all of them at Milwaukee Children's Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n-You know, Frank, I'm, uh, I'm beginning to feel like Santa Claus.\n\n-You should -- your eyes are the color of his suit.\n\n-Well, what are we talking about?\n\nThere's a lot of kids waiting to be -- -I know, I know -- -Like all the wonderful ones at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n-And how about those great little faces at Children's Hospital of Santa Rosa Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas?\n\n-Oh, I wish I could be at St. Joseph's Orphanage in Louisville, Kentucky, to see their eyes Christmas morning.\n\n-And don't forget the ones, the kids at the Jewish Orphans Home at Vista Del Mar in Los Angeles.\n\n-And, Daddy, I'd like to send some to Crippled Children's Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, and to all the boys and girls at Dawn Becker Memorial Hospital for Children in Portland, Oregon.\n\n-And Santa Claus will be pretty popular this year, also at Children's Hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\n-And they'll love them at Children's Wing City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California.\n\n-The Children's Asthma Research Institute and Hospital in Denver, Colorado; and Newington Hospital for Crippled Children in Newington, Connecticut.\n\n-And we don't want to forget St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nWell, Jeanie, have we forgotten anything?\n\n-No, darling, unless to tell all the boys and girls across the nation that with these gifts come our hearts.\n\n-Well, I sure would like to stay with all you longer, but as you can see, we got a lot of gift wrapping to do if we're going to get these toys out all over the country in time for Christmas.\n\nI just want to thank the nice folks who make these wonderful toys and for helping us say what's in our hearts to people everywhere, and to all of you watching, thanks for all your Christmas cards and letters.\n\nAnd, Frank, I'm sure glad you and your family could share this Christmas show with us.\n\n-We wouldn't have missed it, Dean, you know you're a dear friend.\n\n-Well,
