        "text": "July 3, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nBy now, many of you have heard my story about how I chose to continue my journey in higher education by making the transcontinetal move to Southwest Florida 25 years ago. Being so far away from my culture and family led me to adop this region as my new home and the people around me as my new family.\n\nAnd that's how I think of Florida Gulf Coast University. It is home. You are my family.\n\nIt is truly an honor to serve as the fifth president of your university! I am excited for the work - and fun - to come as we grown, innovate and change together. FGCU serves as an economic driver to Southwest Florida and beyond, and we will continue to foster the feedback loop between the growth of the university and the needs of the region. FGCU will take the lead on innovating and adapting big ideas and new ways of learning, teaching, reseraching, and most importantly, preparing our students for today's ever-changing work and business environment and the future of work as life-long learners. I am so passionate and enthusiastic about working alongside the FGCU community to transform lives and build a better future!\n\nWe are in a time of rapid change and technological disruption, and we need to focus on our strategic directions. My top goal over the next 90 days is to dig deep into the strategic planning process, which we started over a year ago with the launch of the FGCU Strategic Roadmap initiative. With feedback from our students, facutly, staff, alumni and the communities we serve, we are ready to complete the process. It is my goal to have a final document to present to the FGCU Board of Trustees in December and the Florida Board of Governors in January, so the journey to make these deadlines begins today.\n\nSoon, announcements will roll out about the various ways you can get involved and have conversations with me. I want to hear from all of you! We will also be strengthening campus communications and bolstering efforts to create two-way channels to share ideas and feedback. Don't be surprised if you see me out of the office and around campus for town halls, roundtables, meet-and-greets and classroom visits. You can also email me at president@fgcu.edu, and I will get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nBut all of that can wait a day. Tomorrow if the Fourth of July, and I want to wish all of you and your families a wonderful and safe Independence Day.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nJuly 10, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nLast week kicked off the start of my presidency at FGCU, and I want to thank you for the warm welcome and outpouring of support. Even with the Fourth of July holiday and extreme heat, our campus was buzzing with activity.\n\nI enjoyed stopping by the Library Lawn to talk with students during the Programming Board’s Fresh Sesh event, and I was pleased to chat with students who were beating the heat by studying indoors.\n\nFrom an administration standpoint, I began meeting one-on-one with members of the Board of Trustees to outline my performance goals and other topics. Cabinet continues to meet on its regular schedule to discuss our direction as a leadership team, and we began initial conversations about our budget allocations and future legislative funding requests. While it is too premature to share details at this time, as all of these conversations are ongoing, I will keep you updated as we move along.\n\nIf I miss you while I’m out and about, don’t forget you can always email me directly at president@fgcu.edu. I look forward to seeing you on campus.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nJuly 17, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nI am starting my third week in office, and I continue to be out and around on campus.\n\nLast week, I dropped by Eagle View Orientation and could not stop myself from making some remarks and welcoming everyone to the Eagle Family! I am inspired and energized by meeting with our upcoming class and their families.\n\nIn addition to being around campus, I have been out in the community talking about FGCU and the role it plays in Southwest Florida. Also, I continue to meet with members of the FGCU Board of Trustees through one-on-one meetings focused on our strategic direction.\n\nLast week, the President’s Cabinet worked on the 2024 Legislative Budget Request, and we have ongoing meetings to discuss our current budget allocations. Additionally, we are working on naming the co-chairs and establishing the expectations of two new committees: one focused on the strategic planning process for the university and the other on internal communications. I will provide more details about these endeavors over the next few weeks.\n\nFinally, I want to remind everyone to take care of yourselves. We are absolutely having a very hot summer, and it’s important to be attentive to the recommendations of local authorities, including FGCU’s Emergency Management office.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nJuly 24, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nI was delighted to spend time last week with the Mandela Washington Fellows, a cohort of 25 young leaders from Africa who have spent the summer on our campus learning how to bring about positive changes in their home countries. It was so rewarding to hear them reflect about their time at FGCU, and how they regard us as a model for working with our local community.\n\nAs you know, part of that connectivity is FGCU’s research that is applicable to our region. I saw that in action last week when I learned more than I probably ever wanted to know about pythons from senior-level students and their faculty. I attended the Department of Biology’s Summer 2023 Undergraduate Research Symposium, and it was truly remarkable.\n\nAnd for a little extra fun, I tried to put my best foot forward at the Student Shuffle, a line dancing event at University Recreation & Wellness. Next time, I’m bringing my gym clothes!\n\nFrom an administration standpoint, I want you to know that the President’s Cabinet is continuing its work on the 2023-24 budget allocations. Also, we have decided who will lead the Strategic Planning Steering Committee. Committee co-chairs are Dr. Clay Motley, dean of the College of Arts & Sciences, and Jorge Lopez, associate vice president of Student Financial Enrollment and Business Services. Serving as ex-officio is Dr. Eileen DeLuca, the interim chief strategy and program innovation officer. Their first job is to form a committee, which will include student, faculty and staff representatives from across campus. By the start of August, FGCU will have picked a consultant that will work alongside the committee to help create our next strategic plan, so this is an exciting first step in the process. Congratulations to Clay, Jorge and Eileen!\n\nI plan to share more about the Internal Communications Committee next week. Stay tuned!\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nJuly 31, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nWhat a month we have had! It’s amazing to think that tomorrow is the first of August, which means we are counting down to when FGCU faculty and students return to campus. I am so eager to begin the fall term with all of you.\n\nAs summer comes to an end, it is bittersweet to say goodbye to the Mandela Washington Fellows. We have built incredible ties with them, and I know they will carry FGCU's commitments to the community and civic engagement back home with them to Africa. They are now part of the Eagle Family, and we will always be in touch.\n\nI’ve continued to be out and about, spending time with employees and students alike. I’ve also been inviting university partners, business leaders and other representatives of our Southwest Florida community to our beautiful campus for meetings. One of my priorities is to do everything I can to showcase what our campus has to offer, and often that means I’m inviting our outside guests for lunch meetings at SoVi Dining or The Boardwalk. It truly has made all the difference in our discussions, and it helps me tell FGCU’s story.\n\nAnd that leads me to my next point. As I teased last week, the President’s Cabinet has decided who will lead our newly formed Internal Communications Committee. The group’s co-chairs are Pamela McCabe, the coordinator of University Communications & Media Relations, and Professor Lyn Millner of the Department of Communication & Philosophy. They will round out the committee with representatives from across the campus community, and the group’s work will help us elevate the story of FGCU as we engage with one another in more meaningful ways.\n\nIn the next week, I will be traveling to Munich, Germany, to visit the European regional head office for Arthrex. During this trip, we will discuss how we can expand our partnership and create new opportunities for academic, research and workforce development.\n\nIn closing, I wish all of you a wonderful week, and I look forward to seeing you around campus.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nAugust 7, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nWe are now one week out from the start of the fall semester, and the energy that comes with a new academic term can be felt across every corner of campus.\n\nPart of that energy is due to an increase in traffic as more of our Eagles return to the nest. Today, we welcome back most of our faculty members who have been off for the summer, and our residential students will being moving into their rooms in the coming days.\n\nAs you make your way around campus, you will likely notice some of our summertime upgrades to campus. Signage on windows and doors are in the process of being updated with FGCU's new logo, and the main loop around campus has been refreshed with new asphalt and traffic lines. We are looking very sharp!\n\nI encourage all faculty and academic support staff to be on the lookout for a message from Provost Mark Rieger today. He has some very exciting news to share for the year ahead.\n\nAnd to all employees, I am looking forward to seeing you Friday at the Welcome Celebration - our annual kickoff to the fall term. This is a great opportunity to share a meal, catch up with colleagues and meet our newest employees. I'll be giving the \"State of the University\" address, and I will discuss what's next for FGCU as we head into our 26th year of teaching and learning.\n\nIt trusly is an exciting time to be an FGCU Eagle, and I look forward to welcoming the fall term with all of you.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nAugust 14, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nI am thrilled to welcome all FGCU students, faculty and staff to the new academic year! It is truly a time of new beginnings here on campus, and I am so excited to welcome the incoming class of 2027, our transfer students and new hires to the Eagle Family.\n\nIt is not lost on me that FGCU will celebrate its 26th birthday in 11 days. Our institution’s future is bright, and we will remain focused on the pursuit of excellence in terms of academics, research, scholarship, service to the community and the day-to-day functions that ensure our students are successful.\n\nI want you to know that we have been very busy all summer preparing for the start of fall classes, and here are two changes I know our students and employees will be glad to know:\n\nWe have upgraded our campus WiFi network, known as eduroam, to provide faster network speeds and higher security standards. Service will now be available on the Library Lawn and the outdoor area near Academic Building 9, home of The Water School. If you need help logging into eduroam, visit edu/wifi for instructions.\n\nWe are in the process of building a new elevated, lighted boardwalk to provide a safer way for our students and employees to travel between the SoVi residential area and the main academic corridor. The pathway will have access points at SoVi Dining, the Bower School of Music & the Arts and the nearby multipurpose rec field. We will have more updates on the boardwalk in the coming months – stay tuned!\n\nOf course, it would not be the start of the fall term without showing school spirit. I look forward to greeting students tonight at Eagle Revolution, our annual pep rally to kick off the new academic year. Don’t forget, doors open at 6:30 p.m. at Alico Arena!\n\nOur faculty and staff had their own version of a pep rally last week with the annual Welcome Celebration. It was a terrific opportunity to catch up with colleagues, meet our new hires and share our excitement for what’s to come in our 26th year.\n\nI can feel it already – we are off to a banner 2023-24 academic year.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nAugust 21, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nWe’re one week into the new academic year, and it is so wonderful to see the energy and excitement that comes with the start of the fall term. I have made it a priority in my schedule to drop by the Weeks of Welcome events, which has given me a chance to introduce myself to students and, in one case, catch a ride on the swings during the First Day Fair on the Library Lawn. These events are a great way to have fun, meet fellow students, get connected to campus and learn more about what it means to be an FGCU Eagle.\n\nIt is so important for all of our students, especially our freshmen, to feel they belong at FGCU – that this is your home away from home. Our faculty and staff are here to support you in your journey, and students can reach out to us at any time for extra support. We can help you get more involved with campus events and activities, introduce you to other students and programs, and we can provide guidance for the road ahead – be it academics, internships or local career opportunities. We’re here to support you, so don’t hesitate to ask for help!\n\nOne of the highlights of my week was an off-campus excursion to the Bonita Springs community. Dr. Steve McIntosh, a member of the FGCU Foundation Board of Directors, orchestrated a tour where I could visit with community and business leaders to talk about growth and partnerships with FGCU. It’s important for us to make these connections in the five-county region we serve.\n\nI am also very proud to tell you that two important state funding requests were approved by the FGCU Board of Trustees during its virtual meeting on Friday. Here’s what you should know:\n\nLinking Industry to Nursing Education (LINE) Fund | This $1.1 million funding proposal is meant to incentivize collaboration between nursing education programs, like we offer through Marieb College of Health & Human Services, and partners in the healthcare industry. By working together, we can meet local, regional and state workforce needs, and we would use the money to recruit more instructors, improve the nursing education program and increase the number of nursing graduates.\n\n2024 Legislative Budget Request | The $10.9 million funding request will help FGCU take its student-centered education model to the next step by preparing incoming students for college-level work, build tomorrow’s workforce and leverage innovative programs. The three-step approach will ensure more students complete their academic programs on time with skills that will help them meet the demands of an ever-changing workforce. You can read more about the LBR document in the cover story of August’s Inside FGCU newsletter.\n\nBoth funding requests will now go before the Board of Governors for review, and I’ll keep you updated on what happens next with these funding requests. Make it a great week! Wings up and go Eagles!\n\nOctober 2, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nOctober has arrived, and we are approaching the halfway point of the fall term. We have much to look forward to, including traditional fall events on campus, the upcoming holidays and the great celebration of our fall graduates in December. I'm pleased to see so much enthusiasm campus-wide, and I want our students, faculty and staff to know that your leaders are taking notice.\n\nI encourage you to save the date for an upcoming town hall, which is set to take place at noon on October 25. I will be joined by Cabinet, which consists of our five vice presidents, to talk about FGCU's funding sources, current operating budget and allocations, as well as the upcoming legislative session. This will be a great opportunity to ask questions on how the budget works for our university and have a dialogue with university leadership.\n\nThe event will take place in the Cohen Student Union Ballroom, and our students, faculty and staff can join the conversation in person or virtually. Full event details will be shared by email and on my website in the days to come.\n\nThe event is the first of many to be planned by the Internal Communications Committee. The group has been hosting listening sessions with shared governance groups and will soon launch a campus-wide survey. Stay tuned for more information.\n\nMake it a great week. Wings up and go Eagles!\n\nOctober 9, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nLast week was a great example of how FGCU connects with community and business leaders across Southwest Florida.\n\nThe university welcomed members of the President's Advisory Circle on Workforce and Economic Development to campus for its quarterly meeting. This is an invite-only group of leaders from the five-county area. FGCU faculty, staff and administrators regularly talk with this group about the current and future state of the workforce. During our meeting, we collected the group's valuable input and insights on our next strategic initiatives and directions for FGCU's bright future.\n\nOn that note, don't forget the survey about FGCU's mission, vision and goals is due tomorrow (October 10). Check your email for Friday's announcement on the feedback sessions from the Strategic Plan Steering Committee.\n\nWe also welcomed our Town & Gown membership to campus last week. This is a group that has a long history in supporting FGCU student scholarships, the FGCU Campus Food Pantry, Azul's Attire and other projects that support our students, faculty and staff. It's always so wonderful to see our community give back.\n\nFinally, FGCU Eagle Advocacy kicked off the upcoming legislative session with the Southwest Florida Delegation. Our theme for the upcoming legislative session is all about \"Excellence in Student Success.\"\n\nFor those who missed the event, we plan to talk briefly about the upcoming legislative session during our October 25 town hall. We'll also discuss FGCU's funding sources and the current operating budget and allocations. The flyer for the town hall is attached. Mark your calendars and bring a lunch.\n\nMake it a great week! Wings up and go Eagles!\n\nOctober 16, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nIn a little over two weeks, there are going to be noticeable changes to the Cohen Student Union. FGCU is preparing for a significant renovation that will provide our student union with a more welcoming, living room-style atmosphere. I have attached a couple renderings of Phase 1 of the project, and you can see that the design calls for more open space, comfortable seating areas and a bolder color scheme that aligns with our new branding initiative.\n\nIt will take about two years for the entire Cohen project to be completed. FGCU is conducting the project in three phases, so only small sections of the building will be under construction at one time. Phase 1 begins October 30, and it will focus on updating Einstein’s Bros. Bagels and the walkway/lobby area leading out to the Bookstore parking lot.\n\nThe Bookstore will remain accessible during the work. Einstein’s will be temporarily moving to the food court area, where it will offer a condensed menu in The Rally space. Please note that Einstein’s will be closed October 27-28 for the move. It is anticipated to reopen in the food court space October 30.\n\nAs this project moves along, I will provide you with updates. Thank you to the renovation committee for collaborating on this project to improve the student union experience.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nOctober 23, 2023\n\nI will be part of a team from FGCU that is attending the 2023 Florida Chamber Annual Meeting & Future of Florida Forum. As we meet with business and community leaders from across the state, we will share FGCU’s story and its unparalleled impact in the Southwest Florida region. This is an excellent opportunity to extend FGCU's reach and partnerships statewide, furthering our mission to help students launch successful careers in the Sunshine State.\n\nAttending the annual meeting is the perfect way to start the week, especially after an incredible weekend on campus. Eagle EXPO was action-packed, and the annual open house truly highlighted our programs and the work done by our terrific faculty, staff and students. The weekend doubled as Eagle Family Weekend, and it was so wonderful to see the influx of families visiting campus, too. In all, we had more than 2,000 people on campus, and I am so appreciative of all of our Eagles who pitched in to make it such a successful weekend.\n\nAs we head into the week, be sure to mark your calendar for Wednesday’s budget-focused town hall featuring the President’s Cabinet. The event is a great way to learn more about FGCU’s budget process, including our funding sources, allocations and the upcoming legislative session. The event starts at noon in the Cohen Student Union Ballroom, and you can watch it online at www.fgcu.edu/townhall. Light refreshments will be provided, and we encourage you to bring your lunch. I am looking forward to having this important conversation with faculty, staff and students.\n\nFinally, I want you to know that our leadership team continues to work with the Chancellor’s Office to evaluate, interpret and implement new legislation related to higher education, especially Senate Bill 266. Recently, we received a draft version of the Board of Governors (BOG) regulation, which addresses prohibited expenditures. FGCU leadership – and leaders from other state public universities in Florida – provided feedback on this regulation to the Chancellor’s Office. We will inform you about the progress and implementation as we learn more.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\nDear Eagle Family,\n\nThank you to everyone who attended our first town hall of the academic year. I was joined on stage by our vice presidents for a presentation on FGCU’s operating budget, and we took several questions from our in-person and virtual audience.\n\nWe know that not everyone could make it to the event, so please know that a recording of the discussion can be found on the website for the Office of the President. The Internal Communications Committee is collecting feedback on this town hall, which can be submitted through a three-question form accessible at https://bit.ly/ICC-TH.\n\nThe committee will use this information to guide future events, and Cabinet will answer your additional questions on the budget after the feedback survey closes on Friday, November 3. For more information, email icc@fgcu.edu. The next town hall will take place in January 2024, and it will focus on performance-based funding metrics. We will announce details shortly.\n\nEvents like these are not only informational, but a great way to build a better sense of community for our students and employees. We often talk about the importance of our students feeling as though they belong on our campus, but it is also important for our employees to feel connected to our campus community. We know you can’t be at every event, but it’s important to find ways to get involved. Joining committees, grabbing lunch with colleagues from across campus, supporting student events on the Library Lawn, cheering on the Eagles at sporting events and following along with the meetings of the FGCU Board of Trustees are great ways to get more involved.\n\nWe are a team, and it’s important for all of us to find time in our day to connect with our campus community beyond our typical roles. I, for one, am looking forward to seeing you on campus!\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nNovember 6, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nAt the end of October, you received information from the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance about the events and happenings associated with Compliance and Ethics Week. Starting on November 13, our students, faculty and staff are invited to take part in these workshops, training sessions and informative talks that will help refresh your knowledge about university policies and procedures.\n\nThese events will provide you with a greater idea of what to look out for when it comes to compliance topics and ethical behavior, which is something we all have a responsibility to uphold. For more information and to register for Compliance and Ethics Week sessions, visit: Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance Events - Eagle Link (campuslabs.com).\n\nNext week, the FGCU Board of Trustees will meet for its second workshop on the strategic planning process. The workshop will take place at 9 a.m. November 14 in Room 138 of Academic Building 9 (home of The Water School). We are very close to completing this important, guiding document for the university, and it is important for all of us to get involved in the process.\n\nFinally, I want to share a terrific experience I had last Friday when I served on a panel of university presidents from across the state. The event, held at the University of Central Florida, was titled, “Supporting Research and Innovation in Florida – Contemporary Challenges and Opportunities.” Our moderator was President Alexander Cartwright (UCF), and I was joined on stage by fellow presidents Debra Schwinn (Palm Beach Atlantic University), Moez Limayem (University of North Florida) and Martha D. Saunders (University of West Florida). It was a thoughtful conversation, and I was so happy to share the ways we work with our Southwest Florida and statewide partners to prepare our students for their future.\n\nOften, I write you messages that explain how the university is collaborating with business leaders and community partners to support what we do on campus in terms of student learning, research initiatives and other programs. Last week’s panel was yet another example of how we are working with the greater community – this time, sharing the sentiment alongside some of our higher-ed peers across the state.\n\nI look forward to seeing you on campus. Wings up and go Eagles!\n\nNovember 13, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nI had the pleasure of attending Trustee Summit, a one-day meeting of all of the State University System’s presidents, trustees and members of the Board of Governors (BOG). It was held at the University of Central Florida and led into the November BOG meeting.\n\nThe summit is a conference, if you will, to help educate board members about new and rising topics in higher education, while providing orientation sessions for new members. I was amazed at how many of the discussion points were focused on topics that FGCU has implemented and, often, already mastered or is in the process of planning.\n\nThis includes focusing our attention on experiential learning and internship opportunities, which provide our students with real-world experience beyond the classroom. Also highlighted was a push for universities to develop the local workforce with short-term, high-rigor academic programs like digital badges and micro-credentials. It was flattering to know we are ahead of the curve and an example in our state and across the nation for these initiatives.\n\nFor some other areas, we have work to do. However, we are seeking out new opportunities and planning for next steps, especially for improving student success outcomes, such as:\n\nimplementing an advanced, data-driven culture and using predictive analytics to identify potential barriers that keep students from progressing or graduating;\n\nadapting learning opportunities with new technologies to better meet the needs of today’s teaching and learning environment;\n\nand, finally, increasing awareness of FGCU for life-long learning opportunities.\n\nWe will carry all of this momentum forward in our next strategic plan. As I previously mentioned, FGCU’s trustees meet tomorrow for a second workshop on this process. Among the topics to be discussed are the draft documents for our next mission, vision and goals.\n\nMany important topics were also discussed during the BOG meeting, including the proposed regulation on prohibited expenditures, general education core courses, performance-based funding metrics and a new funding formula. I will provide more details on these topics when we receive specific direction from Chancellor Ray Rodrigues and his staff.\n\nMake it a great week! Wings up and go Eagles!\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nIt is Thanksgiving week, and I want to pause and reflect on my gratitude for all of our FGCU students, faculty and staff. You have shown such wonderful support as I transitioned to the presidency, and I am constantly in awe of the incredible community that makes up our Eagle Family.\n\nPlease know that you are making a difference in the world, and your impact can be felt beyond the corners of this campus. Southwest Florida residents have every reason to be proud our university is in their backyard, and that’s because of you. I am so proud to count you all as my colleagues.\n\nMay your Thanksgiving break be a time where you can gather with loved ones and rest up for the final stretch of the fall term.\n\nAs a quick lookahead:\n\nSTUDENTS: The final day of fall classes is December 8, with finals week running through December 15. Commencement is December 16. Spring term classes begin January 8, 2024.\n\nEMPLOYEES: In addition to the Presidential Holiday for this week (November 22), please make sure to mark your schedules for the recently announced Presidential Holiday on December 22. This is an early kickoff to this year’s winter break, and we will see you back on campus January 2.\n\nI am looking forward to seeing you on campus as we head into the final weeks of the fall semester. Have a safe and wonderful Thanksgiving.\n\nWings up, and go Eagles!\n\nNovember 28, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nI hope you had a great time with your loved ones during the Thanksgiving break and have returned to campus feeling recharged and ready to complete the final days of the fall term.\n\nThis week, the university is fine-tuning the details of our next strategic plan, which is a document that will guide the university during the next five years. The steering committee and I are continuing to gather final insights and feedback from members of FGCU’s Board of Trustees. On December 7, we will present the final version of this plan to the full board. It is very exciting to have reached this stage of the plan, and I look forward to sharing more about it.\n\nThe next day, December 8, is the final day of fall classes before exam week. Students, I wish you all the best as we approach the end of the semester. Study and sleep well! We know this time of year comes with extra stress and responsibilities, and your wellbeing is important.\n\nWhile the end of the term is a busy time of year, it is also a time when you are more likely to see me out and about on campus. I am looking forward to making visits to classrooms to observe student presentations in addition to attending university events, cheering on our student-athletes at their games and representing FGCU at community gatherings.\n\nI am sure you will see me around, and I look forward to seeing you.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nDecember 4, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nWe have reached the final week of the fall term, and I am so proud of the work put into this semester by our students, faculty and staff.\n\nAs I mentioned in last week’s message, I was going to be stopping by classrooms to sit in on end-of-term presentations. In the communications department, I sat in on a pitch session with public relations students, and then I saw the presentation of research papers for students in the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Program in Marieb College of Health & Human Services. On my way, I stopped by a sustainability event hosted by Student Government.\n\nI also took part in a Q-and-A session with students in an undergraduate leadership class, and I attended a meet-and-greet in the Cohen Student Union for members of the Naples Council on World Affairs. During this event, hosted by FGCU’s Global Engagement Office, I saw the FGCU Millennium Fellows present their projects. I was honored to be included in these sessions and see the phenomenal work that has been done this semester by FGCU students.\n\nLikewise, I had a fun, after-hours meetup with faculty from the Daveler & Kauanui School of Entrepreneurship at one of my favorite places to dine on campus: The Boardwalk. Meeting with employees is so important to me, so please don’t hesitate to invite me to events. I may not always be able to attend, but I will when I can!\n\nFinally, I just want to say that I ended last week on a high note with the very spirited Night at the Nest. We had 800 people at the gala, which is our annual fundraiser for the Athletics program. It was such a fantastic opportunity to see our student-athletes and coaching staff mingling with the community. It was truly the embodiment of what we do well here at FGCU – building relationships with our community so we can better serve our students. It was the perfect end to the week!\n\nHave a great week on campus.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nDecember 11, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nFGCU is most definitely on a journey to excellence, and I am thrilled to announce that our proposed strategic plan has been unanimously approved by our Board of Trustees (BOT). We have called the 2024-29 strategic plan Innovating for Student Success: FGCU’s Journey to Excellence. View the draft document online by clicking here!\n\nNext, we will take our proposed strategic plan before the Board of Governors (BOG) January 24-25 for final approval before we begin the exciting work of bringing the document to life. Reaching this milestone is important for our FGCU Community, and I am so grateful and proud of all the work that has been done on this project during the past 20 months.\n\nWe began the journey with the 2022 Strategic Roadmap Steering Committee and completed the project with the Strategic Plan Steering Committee. Both groups pulled together stakeholders throughout our university, including our deans, school directors and shared governance groups, to facilitate conversations and feedback sessions. We heard from students, employees, alumni, donors, Trustees and advisory board members for our six colleges and five schools. We looked beyond our campus, soliciting feedback from our five-county service region, including business and community leaders, local school districts, nonprofits and members of the local delegation. The feedback we received was incredible, and it helped us refine our existing mission and vision statements.\n\nWe have also ensured that our strategic goals and directions are in alignment with the 2025 Strategic Plan for the State University System (SUS) and the Florida Chamber of Commerce’s 2030 Blueprint plan, as well as the demographic and economic growth of Southwest Florida and beyond. This helped us create strategic and measurable performance goals that will not only continue our distinctive identity in Southwest Florida’s living laboratory, but ensures our plan aligns to the regional workforce, the state and the ever-changing landscape of higher education.\n\nMy deepest appreciation to all who contributed to this important task. It is almost impossible to list everyone's name here, but links to the committee memberships are provided above. We recognize your work and thank each of you for your contributions and service. A special thank you to those who helped lead the work for the past six months: Committee Co-chairs Dr. Clay Motley and Jorge Lopez as well as Ex-officio Dr. Eileen DeLuca. Job well done!\n\nI will keep you updated on the next step: presenting the plan to the BOG at the end of January. Until then, please take time to read the document.\n\nWe are all stakeholders in FGCU’s Journey to Excellence, and that means we are all accountable for ensuring we meet our goals. I am looking forward to the work that lies ahead!\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nDecember 18, 2023\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nThe fall term has officially come to an end, and we celebrated fall commencement over the weekend. Despite blustery, rainy weather, our ceremonies were packed with families and friends of our Eagle graduates.\n\nA big thank you to all the faculty participants, staff workers and student volunteers who made this important day such a beautiful event for our graduates. And to our students who completed their academic programs, congratulations!\n\nAs I told our graduates on Saturday, the characteristics of FGCU students stand apart from other institutions. Like our mascot, the mighty Eagle, our students are strong and resilient, and they have learned to persevere through life’s challenges. And the same can be said for our world-class faculty and amazing staff members who put student success as the focal point of their day-to-day work.\n\nFrom my perspective, the past year has been an incredible year for our institution, and I look forward to continuing that momentum in 2024. I wish you all a wonderful and relaxing winter break, and I look forward to seeing you all next year!\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nJanuary 2, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family, and happy New Year!\n\nI hope you had a great time with your loved ones during winter break and have returned to campus feeling rested and refreshed. We are kicking off the spring term next week, and soon our campus will be buzzing with activity.\n\nOn Friday, January 12, we will gather at Alico Arena for my presidential installation, an event that will celebrate everything our institution has achieved over the past 26 years and the work that lies ahead. Faculty, staff and students are encouraged to attend the festivities, with the ceremony starting at 10 a.m. in the arena. The ceremony will be followed by an outdoor lunch on the FGCU Soccer Field, and I look forward to celebrating with all of you. Both events are free to attend, but tickets are required to enter Alico Arena.\n\nWhile the celebration is a great kick off to the year, I am most excited about what we will achieve together in the months ahead. From my perspective, 2024 brings us new opportunities for personal and professional growth, and it starts with our proposed strategic plan, Innovating for Student Success: FGCU's Journey to Excellence.\n\nWe will present the document to the Board of Governors (BOG) for final approval at the end of the month. If you have not done so already, please read through the plan. FGCU’s Journey to Excellence will truly guide our decisions and priorities for the next five years, and all of us have a responsibility in making sure we meet our goals.\n\nI look forward to seeing you on campus.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nJanuary 8, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nToday marks the first day of the spring term, and I wish all of our students, faculty and staff a great beginning to what I know will be an amazing semester. I would also like to welcome our newest students, staff and faculty to campus. On behalf of the university, I welcome you to the Eagle Family.\n\nThe start of a new year, or a new semester, brings a sense of renewal. And it truly is a time of new beginnings at FGCU. We are growing, we are maturing and we have a bright, exciting future ahead of us.\n\nI hope to see you at my presidential installation celebration this Friday at Alico Arena. The time-honored academic celebration begins at 10 a.m., and we will gather to honor FGCU’s legacy, celebrating everything our institution has achieved over its past 26 years and the important work that lies ahead.\n\nThe ceremony will be followed by an outdoor lunch on the FGCU Soccer Field. Both events are free to attend, but tickets are required to enter Alico Arena. Make sure you get your tickets!\n\nI look forward to seeing you on campus.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nJanuary 16, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nAlico Arena was filled with Eagle Spirit Friday during the installation ceremony, and I thank all of our students, faculty and staff for representing our great university at this event. Truly, it was a wonderful celebration of our institution’s unique history, biggest milestones and the legacy we have built in Southwest Florida.\n\nAs part of the time-honored academic tradition, I shared the stage with our previous leaders, including our founding president, Dr. Roy McTarnaghan; our third president, Dr. Wilson Bradshaw; and Dr. Mike Martin, our fourth president. Having our previous presidents back on campus made the event extra special – something we have heard from longtime employees, alumni and our community supporters.\n\nI want to thank the hardworking volunteers and event staff who put on this great event. You embedded FGCU’s culture of passion, partnerships and performance into every piece of the ceremony and truly made the Eagle Family very proud.\n\nAs I told the audience Friday, the road ahead is bright for FGCU. We are going to build on our successes and carry FGCU’s momentum forward. We will cross off our next milestone next week when we present our new strategic plan to the Board of Governors for final approval. Once approved, we will begin the exciting work of bringing the plan to life on our campus.\n\nIt is such an exciting time to be an FGCU Eagle.\n\nLOOKING AHEAD: Please mark your calendars for FGCU’s next town hall, which will focus on performance-based funding and metrics. The town hall is set for 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Friday, February 2, in the Cohen Student Union Ballroom. Check out the event flyer or visit the website for the Office of the President for more information.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nJanuary 22, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nI am writing you from Tallahassee in honor of the 10th Annual FGCU Day at the Capitol. Tomorrow, our team of Eagle Advocates will meet with elected officials and their staff to talk about FGCU’s legislative priorities, what we love about this institution and where we are headed in the future.\n\nI’m thrilled to have so many of our students and alumni join us for this great tradition. Thank you to Student Body President Emory Cavin, who rounded up members of Student Government to participate in FGCU Day and learn first-hand about the fundamentals of state government. And thanks to our Government Relations team for making this event happen!\n\nAs I have said before, our future is bright. We will carry this momentum to the Board of Governors this week, as I will present our proposed strategic plan for final approval. Please stay tuned on more information about our next steps with our five-year plan.\n\nAmong our upcoming events is the next town hall. I am looking forward to a great discussion with faculty, staff and students at the February 2 event, where I will be joined by our vice presidents for a discussion on performance-based funding and metrics.\n\nLight refreshments will be available, but plan to bring a lunch and your questions. The event starts at 11 a.m. in the Cohen Student Union Ballroom.\n\nHere are a few of the topics we will cover:\n\nThe history of performance-based funding (PBF) in Florida\n\nA look at how the benchmarks for the metrics system has changed over time\n\nThe link between a university’s performance and how it is funded\n\nFGCU’s position for PBF metrics\n\nHow FGCU’s proposed strategic plan will impact our performance in the state metrics system\n\nIt may be helpful to review the following documents before the town hall:\n\n2023 Performance Based Funding: Metric Scores and Allocations\n\n2023 SUS Accountability Plan, which includes definitions for each metric and shows metric-by-metric comparisons for the 12 SUS institutions.\n\nSee the event flyer (attached) or visit the website for the Office of the President for more information.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nOver the weekend, we welcomed our admitted students for the upcoming academic year to campus for our annual Say Yes to the Nest event. This is an opportunity to show off our campus and provide future Eagles with more information about our academic programs, colleges, schools and campus life.\n\nIt was a beautiful day on campus, and we were able to showcase our Southwest Florida lifestyle during winter, which was a wonderful experience for our out-of-state visitors. I appreciate and thank all of our faculty, staff and students who made the event such a great success. Great job, team!\n\nSpeaking of teams, one of my favorite parts about our campus is how many incredible sporting events occur. There is always an opportunity to wear your green and blue and cheer on our Eagles, whether the athletes play for our registered sport clubs or intercollegiate teams. Be sure to check out the Athletics calendar so you do not miss the opportunity to interact with our outstanding student-athletes and coaches.\n\nAs we head into a new week on campus, do not be surprised if you see more people on campus. On Tuesday and Wednesday, FGCU is hosting universities and colleges from across the nation for Instructure’s Badging Summit. This is an incredible opportunity for FGCU to stand out as a role model to other institutions as we highlight our digital badge and micro-credential programs.\n\nI have often said that FGCU is ahead of the curve for responding quickly to workforce needs, and one way we do this is through these short-term, high-rigor academic certificate programs that help advance employees in their career path. Hosting this conference is a big step for our university, and one that should make all of us proud.\n\nFinally, I want to remind you that at 11 a.m. on Friday we will gather in the Cohen Student Union Ballroom for the university’s next town hall: Understanding Performance-Based Funding and Metrics. I will be joined by our vice presidents for the discussion, and we encourage our faculty, staff and students to bring a lunch and some questions for the Q-and-A. Visit the website for the Office of the President for more information.\n\nMake it a great week.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nFrom start to finish, last week was a perfect example of how FGCU is creating partnerships across campus and beyond.\n\nI started the week by sitting in on discussions and presentations for FGCU’s Digital Badge Summit (in collaboration with Instructure), which was an incredible opportunity for FGCU to highlight its nationally recognized digital badge and micro-credential programs. We have done so much in such a short amount of time to develop these programs for our students and workforce. It was a wonderful and humbling experience to share our badging model with university leaders from across the state and nation.\n\nI also attended the Lee Health Day open house, where our students, faculty and staff learned more about Lee Health and the work being done in our community by one of the largest public health systems in the United States. While I was there, Dr. Larry Antonucci, the president and CEO of Lee Health, presented me with my very own lab coat – dubbing me a “Doctor in Community Partnerships!” Of course, I was honored to receive my second “doctorate,” but the recognition truly honors the work we are doing campus-wide to connect our students with regional partners like Lee Health.\n\nFinally, I want to thank all of you who attended the town hall discussion on performance-based funding and metrics. The open forum is exactly what we need to do more of as a university community, and it was an exercise in showing how we are using our new strategic plan to form better relationships campus-wide on our Journey to Excellence. I’m looking forward to planning our next event with the Internal Communications Committee. Stay tuned for more details!\n\nSAVE THE DATES: Please mark your calendars for the spring semester lunches at The Boardwalk. The events are held the first Tuesday of the month, when the waterfront restaurant will open early for faculty, staff and students. The next lunch is tomorrow – Tuesday, February 6 – from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. I’m disappointed I have to miss it, but I encourage you to head over for a lunch with a view!\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nFebruary 12, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nStudent success is at the forefront of our mission, and I am proud of the many ways our students are learning, maturing and impacting the world around them.\n\nToday, I want to highlight some great news from the School of Nursing. Once again, our nursing graduates have risen to the top when it comes to passing the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN). This year, 100% of our nursing graduates passed the exam, earning them the top pass rate in the State University System of Florida. Within the SUS, the average pass rate is 92%, and the national average is 90%. Kudos to our Nursing faculty and staff for putting support systems in place to help our students transition from the rigorous program to the workforce. And congratulations to our nursing graduates – you make us proud!\n\nSpeaking of alumni, last week was Homecoming. More than 1,000 alumni, students, faculty and staff attended the various events, from the launch of an alumni-themed beer called “Wings Up” at Palm City Brewing to celebrating the many successes of our talented graduates at our annual Alumni Awards. Of course, the weekend festivities were also incredible, and I enjoyed seeing FGCU’s green-and-blue pride on display at the Homecoming Tailgate and basketball games. I applaud our employees who made it such a wonderful week for our Eagle Family – thank you!\n\nFinally, I want to officially congratulate our newly elected officers for FGCU’s Board of Trustees. Michael Wynn is board chair and Richard P. Eide, Jr. is vice chair for the 2024-26 term. I am eager for the work ahead as we bring our strategic plan to life.\n\nMake it a great week, and I hope to see you on campus.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nFebruary 19, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nOften, we talk about the wonderful partnerships that exist between FGCU and the regional and statewide workforce, as we act as a pipeline that connects students to their future careers. But we also develop important friendships with other community groups and organizations, ensuring that FGCU’s Journey to Excellence will make all of Southwest Florida successful.\n\nTake for example our partnership with the region’s K-12 school systems. We regularly work with school administrators and instructors to plan one-of-a-kind experiences that highlight how a university education can impact the lives of their students. We showcased this type of partnership last week when we welcomed seventh-grade students from Collier County Public Schools to campus. You may have noticed their bright green shirts as the middle schoolers toured our academic facilities!\n\nI met up with the students and Superintendent Leslie Ricciardelli on the tour, where I was able to tell them about our institution. Their visit to campus was a wonderful experience, especially for the students who may become the first in their family to go to college. We will be doing a similar venture in April with Superintendent Mike Swindle of the Hendry County School District, and I’m looking forward to engaging more of our region’s youth in the remarkable things happening on campus.\n\nI like to think of our visitors as Early Eagles, as we help them envision what life as an FGCU Eagle could look like for them. When you think about it, it is not much different than what we did Saturday during Eagle Expo. During this admissions-focused open house, we offered prospective Eagles and their families tours of campus and the residence halls, displayed information about our colleges, schools and programs, and gave them opportunities to engage with our faculty, staff and students. Thanks to our faculty, staff, students and administrators who volunteered to showcase FGCU on Saturday.\n\nIt is always a pleasure to share our passion for student success with our visitors. This passion and our pursuit of excellence under our new strategic plan were part of my remarks last week during a luncheon with Town & Gown, a service organization that promotes friendships between the Southwest Florida community and the university. The members support student scholarships, faculty projects and stock our Campus Food Pantry and Azul’s Attire.\n\nSharing FGCU’s story with our partners is vital to our success, whether it is a school district or a representative of Town & Gown. Once again, I send my gratitude to all our employees and students who are helping tell our story.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nImproving internal communications is one of our objectives in FGCU’s Journey to Excellence. Doing so will strengthen our organizational culture and ensure that our students, faculty and staff feel more informed about and engaged in the day-to-day operations of campus. But to make strides in this area, we need to hear from you.\n\nToday, we are launching a campus-wide survey on internal communications. The survey takes about 5 minutes to complete, and it will remain open for the next three weeks – closing on Friday, March 15.\n\nClick HERE to take the communications survey!\n\nYou will be asked about:\n\nFrequency of university communications\n\nTopics that interest you the most\n\nPreferred methods or channels of communication\n\nEmails you regularly read (and the ones you ignore)\n\nPlease participate in the survey and encourage your friends and colleagues to do the same. Survey Link: https://fgcu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0vpjuk8sqMmH7YG\n\nIt is critical that we hear from you, as surveys like this provide us with valuable feedback that helps our university respond to the needs of our constituents. We are committed to continuous improvement. I look forward to also hearing recommendations from the COACHE Strategy Setting Task Force about resources and support and ways to improve FGCU’s culture of leadership.\n\nEMPLOYEE APPRECIATION NIGHT AT ALICO\n\nFGCU faculty and staff will be recognized during the women’s basketball game against the University of North Florida Thursday night. The game begins at 7 p.m. at Alico Arena. The players have been asked to identify an FGCU employee who has been their personal MVP (most valuable player), and all faculty and staff in the audience will be recognized during halftime. Tickets can be purchased at fgcuathletics.com, and don’t forget to wear red to support the American Heart Association.\n\nSOAR INTO SPRING\n\nMarch 4-8 is the students’ spring break, and it is my hope that faculty and staff are able to use this time to participate in trainings and gear up for the remainder of the spring term. One way to do this is by signing up for the annual Soar into Spring events offered by the Staff Advisory Council (SAC). All the details can be found in Soar into Spring document attached to this email.\n\nMake it a great week on campus. Wings up and go Eagles!\n\nMarch 4, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nStudents are on spring break this week, and that means we are looking at a different pace on campus for faculty and staff. As you make plans for the days ahead, don’t forget about the annual Soar into Spring events offered by the Staff Advisory Council (SAC). There are approximately 30 events scheduled throughout the week. Please see the attachment for the full schedule of events.\n\nFor part of this week, I will be in Tallahassee to advocate for our university alongside University Trustees Joseph Fogg III and Richard Eide, Jr. The Senate and House recently started negotiations for the 2024-25 state budget, and we will be meeting with legislators to discuss our priorities, resource requests and FGCU’s Journey to Excellence.\n\nI have been sharing information with all of you about our strategic plan, especially our commitment to creating an exceptional workplace environment. As a reminder, we are participating in two surveys that will assist us in this mission. On March 12, employees will receive an email about the “Great College to Work For” survey, and our campus-wide survey on internal communications will remain open until March 15. It is critical that we hear from you, so please participate.\n\nI wish all of you a great week on campus.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nMarch 11, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nOur students are back from spring break, and the campus is buzzing once again with activity. I hope you took advantage of a quieter week on campus, and that you were able to get out of the office to participate in the Soar into Spring events. I want to thank the Staff Advisory Council (SAC) for organizing the events and our partners around campus for providing our employees with these engaging activities around campus.\n\nI mentioned in my email last week that I traveled to Tallahassee with two of our University Trustees. It was a pleasure to meet with so many of our elected officials and share the wonderful accomplishments of our university. As we discussed FGCU’s priorities, resource requests and our new strategic plan, it was clear to me that our state officials are proud of the work we are doing at FGCU. In the coming weeks, we will know more about where we stand in the governor’s final state budget, and I will keep you updated once that information becomes available.\n\nDon’t forget, this is the final week to participate in the campus-wide survey on internal communications. Your feedback will help inform decisions about how we will improve internal communications for our students, faculty and staff. The survey takes about 5 minutes to complete, and it will remain open until 11:59 p.m. Friday. Click HERE to take the communications survey, or visit https://fgcu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0vpjuk8sqMmH7YG.\n\nWishing all of you a great week on campus.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nThe spring semester continues to be one of great excitement, especially for our seniors and graduate students who are counting down the days to commencement in May. As we approach this time-honored academic tradition, FGCU is expanding the ways we can make this incredible milestone extra special. FGCU faculty and staff who have an immediate family member graduating this term should send an email to April Cordonnier at acordonnier@fgcu.edu. We are also looking for more employees to sign up to work during the celebration. If you want to get more involved, please fill out this form: Spring 2024 Commencement FGCU Employee Worker Registration - Formstack\n\nI want to thank all of our faculty and staff for taking part in recent surveys, many of which are collecting valuable feedback about our work environment. This includes the “Great Colleges to Work For” survey, which closes on March 26. Your participation in these voluntary surveys help FGCU improve our work culture, services to students and campus communications. Please participate in these surveys to the best of your ability.\n\nFinally, I want to congratulate the women's basketball team for winning its seventh consecutive Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament title over the weekend. FGCU will play the University of Oklahoma in the first round of the NCAA Tournament at 4 p.m. Saturday in Bloomington, Indiana. You can follow along on ESPN News, and I want to wish our student-athletes, coaches and support staff congratulations and good luck.\n\nIf you include FGCU’s regular season play across all sports, we have won five conference championships this year, which brings our program’s total to 103 championship wins overall. We have much to be proud of at FGCU, and I encourage our Eagle Family to show support for our student-athletes by wearing blue and green on campus this week.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nOver the weekend, I had the opportunity to travel to Indiana to cheer on our women’s basketball team as they took on Oklahoma in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Our student-athletes always play with such passion, and Saturday was no different. Although their journey in the Big Dance has ended, I am proud of them and grateful to have been courtside to watch them play as a team one final time, alongside more than 140 FGCU fans. I am so thankful to everyone who was there – alumni, parents, friends, donors and, of course, our dedicated support teams from the Athletics department. It was an incredible experience that I will never forget.\n\nThis week, I will be representing our university at the Board of Governors meeting in Gainesville, where we will hear updates from all 12 public universities about student success initiatives and faculty research. I am proud to say that during the 2022-23 academic year we nearly tripled the amount of research dollars awarded to faculty members since the pandemic. We are continuing to build off the success of our past as we mature as an institution, and this is just one area that shows how we are maturing as a university and building off our past successes.\n\nI know all of you have programs and initiatives that bring you great joy and pride here on campus, and I look forward to seeing these endeavors grow. One way to support these causes is by participating in the annual FGCU Give Day fundraising campaign. The 24-hour donation drive begins at noon Wednesday. Every contribution, no matter the size, plays a crucial role in shaping the future of FGCU. Visit giveday.fgcu.edu for more information.\n\nSAVE THE DATE: Please join the Office of Public Policy Events April 3 for a discussion with State Reps. Spencer Roach (Republican from North Fort Myers) and Hillary Cassel (Democrat from Hollywood). Called “Crossing the Political Divide,” the event will highlight their joint efforts as co-sponsors of proposed House Bill 1213 regarding revisions to windstorm insurance coverage. The program begins at 6 p.m. with a reception at 5 p.m. in the Cohen Student Union, Room 201.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nTomorrow, our campus will welcome more than 160 juniors from LaBelle and Clewiston high schools as part of our first-ever Hendry County Schools Day at FGCU. Many of our faculty and staff will join in supporting this event, and you will likely notice the uptick in foot traffic on campus as the students explore pathways in fields related to healthcare, entrepreneurship, business, construction and education.\n\nThis initiative speaks to Goal 3: Elevate Partnerships for Regional Impact of our new strategic plan. Recently, FGCU established an FGCU-Hendry County Coalition to enhance outreach to and communication with Hendry County, and a significant focus is on the public schools in that region.\n\nFGCU will also be visiting this community, as well as others in Southwest Florida, to deepen our connections and create new partnerships that will assist in FGCU’s Journey to Excellence. I send my thanks to all of our faculty, staff and students who have been engaged in these efforts.\n\nThe following evening, we will host State Reps. Spencer Roach and Hillary Cassel for a discussion called Crossing the Political Divide. The program, planned by FGCU’s Office of Public Policy Events, begins at 6 p.m. Wednesday in the Cohen Student Union, Room 201. See the attached flyer for details!\n\nSAVE THE DATE\n\nFinally, I encourage you to mark your calendars for the Grand Opening and Ribbon Cutting Ceremony of the South Village Boardwalk. The event is set to begin at 9 a.m. on Thursday, April 18, and it will give you an opportunity to take your first journey along the pathway connecting the South Village residential area with the main academic corridor.\n\nEmployees, you can learn more about what makes this boardwalk unique in the March issue of Inside FGCU, which can also be found online: www.fgcu.edu/inside. If you plan to join in the festivities, make sure to RSVP through this link for catering purposes: https://fgcu.formstack.com/forms/sovi_grand_opening. I hope to see you there!\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nAs you know, the remodel of the Cohen Student Union has been underway since the end of last October. From start to finish, the remodel project will take about two years to complete and require three phases of construction.\n\nOur end goal is to provide students and employees with a more welcoming, living room-style atmosphere that incorporates more open space and group seating areas that will be great for socializing and working collaboratively on school projects. Cohen’s remodel will also showcase our Eagle spirit, as the walls and decor will showcase FGCU’s bold colors and insignia.\n\nWhile we are just getting started on this initiative, I am pleased to say the first phase is nearly finished! I hope you will join me at the grand re-opening celebration of Einstein Bros. Bagels. Although the restaurant did not close during the remodel, it shifted to the general food court area. This celebration will take place at Einstein’s original – and updated – location at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, April 23. If you plan to join in the festivities, please RSVP by April 18 at https://fgcu.formstack.com/forms/einstein_grand_reopening.\n\nI am also counting down the days to FGCU’s 27th annual Celebration of Excellence event, which is one of our university’s longest-running traditions. Open to the entire FGCU community, this event honors the achievements of our students, faculty and staff during the past year.\n\nIt isn’t lost on me that the Celebration of Excellence fits into our new strategic plan, particularly Goal 4: Strengthen Organizational Culture and Commitment to Employees. Celebrating your hard work and dedication to our students is an absolute joy, and I hope to see you at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, April 16, in the Cohen Student Union Ballroom for this great event.\n\nSpeaking of FGCU's Journey to Excellence, I am thrilled to announce the addition of a new role at our university. Soon, we will be adding a Vice President of Strategic Initiatives & Chief of Staff position to the President’s Cabinet. The person who fills this role will be a direct report to me, and they will serve as one of the key strategic partners to the organization's leadership, providing high-level support and guidance.\n\nThe person selected for this new position will collaborate campus-wide with offices and academic units to ensure effective implementation of our new strategic plan and other university initiatives. In other words, this position will deliver project management, strategic planning coordination and implementation support to further the university's strategic vision and key organizational initiatives with measurable and timely outcomes.\n\nThis vice president will also oversee and provide guidance to the Office of Board Relations, where they will coordinate with the Director of Board Relations and Associate Corporate Secretary Tiffany Reynolds, who will now also carry the title and duties of Deputy Chief of Staff.\n\nFGCU is launching a national search for this new vice president position, and the job posting will go live later this week. I will keep you updated – stay tuned!\n\nMake it a great week. Wings up and go Eagles!\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nYou have heard me say that FGCU’s new strategic plan is our roadmap forward, and I want to focus today’s message on our next steps as a university community.\n\nTo execute this plan and bring it to life, we must prepare unit plans in both academic and administrative functional areas of the university. These plans include the tactics, strategies, projects and initiatives that will be used to help FGCU meet its overarching, institutional goals and objectives.\n\nFrom here, we need to make sure that all of our individual performance goals align with the unit plans. This is how we make a difference in student success and drive home the mission of the institution. As I have said many times before, every employee on this campus – faculty, staff and administration – plays a critical role in FGCU’s Journey to Excellence. All of us are accountable, and we need to keep this expectation in mind as we move into FGCU’s annual goal-setting process.\n\nTying all these elements together – our institutional, unit and individual work – creates the systematic alignment required for us to be successful in our mission. It takes every single one of us to accomplish our strategic goals and objectives, and that means we all need to work together. Together, we are FGCU!\n\nThe Strategic Plan Executive Committee, in consultation with the Cabinet and Institutional Effectiveness and Accountability Council, has worked on a timeline and specific directions. Information will be sent out to campus later this week, and we plan to present our top priorities to the Board of Trustees at the September meeting. Stay tuned for more information.\n\nDON’T FORGET!\n\nFGCU is offering three virtual information sessions about our project with the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS).\n\nToday at 1:30 p.m. | Click here to register for Town Hall 1\n\nTuesday at 11 a.m. | Click here to register for Town Hall 2\n\nWednesday at 4 p.m. | Click here to register for Town Hall 3\n\nThe Grand Opening and Ribbon Cutting Ceremony of the South Village Boardwalk begins at 9 a.m. on Thursday. Please see the attachment for more details. I hope to see you there!\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nPlease bear with me as I have a longer message this week as we wrap up our spring term!\n\nSTRATEGIC PLAN\n\nLast week I announced there would be an email to campus that provides a timeline and specific directions for how we will bring our strategic plan to life in all of our units. In full transparency, the Strategic Plan Executive Committee is still developing this information.\n\nHere’s what the team is working on:\n\nCollecting valuable feedback from our shared governance groups so we can develop the process and timeline.\n\nWorking with General Counsel to adjust related university policies to provide better clarity about unit reporting across campus.\n\nLaunching a new piece of technology called HelioCampus, which will help us transparently set and track our efforts in continuous improvement campus-wide.\n\nI apologize for jumping ahead of where we were in the process – I was just so excited to share the news! Please stay tuned for additional information on our next steps.\n\nINTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS\n\nRecently you were asked to participate in a survey about internal communications, and the committee leading this effort prepared a presentation for Cabinet last week that explains their top-five takeaways from the survey results.\n\nAttached is their summary, and I want you to know the co-chairs of the Internal Communications Committee will be returning to Cabinet in the coming weeks with a list of recommendations for how we can improve communication efforts campus-wide. From here, we will discuss what can be accomplished immediately, what will take a few months, and what items might be developed over a longer period of time. The committee is also making recommendations for upcoming events that will help us have more authentic conversations as a community. Thank you for participating in this survey and helping guide our process forward.\n\nCOACHE SURVEY\n\nProvost Mark Rieger and I met with the COACHE Strategy Setting Taskforce last Friday. The team provided such a comprehensive and thorough report with actionable strategies and objectives that align with Goal 4 of the strategic plan. I thank everyone who is involved in this process and appreciate the commitment of improving the two areas of selected priorities: (one) resources and support and (two) culture of leadership.\n\nThe team also presented an implementation plan with a detailed timeline. Now, the task force will add new members and continue to work with me to further prioritize these recommendations and start implementing them during the summer. We will move forward with these recommendations right away. On the other hand, once we get the results of the “Great Colleges to Work For” survey, we will analyze and merge strategies together even further. Stay tuned!\n\nCELEBRATION OF EXCELLENCE & EAGLE X\n\nIt was so wonderful to attend the Celebration of Excellence event last week. I love that our university has this long-standing tradition to pause and acknowledge the strength of the incredible people who work and learn here. The nominees and award winners are a sampling of what it means to be an FGCU Eagle, and I want to congratulate all involved!\n\nI also want to thank all the faculty, staff and students who made this year’s Eagle X event a resounding success! Eagle X is a great demonstration of FGCU’s commitment to transformational education, from inside the classroom with research and scholarship to beyond the classroom with internships, community engagement, and leadership process. This great event truly showcases our students’ outstanding work to the campus and Southwest Florida communities, and it is a true celebration of student excellence.\n\nSTATE BUDGET\n\nI know that many of you are asking for details about this year’s legislative outcomes regarding the state’s budget. However, Gov. Ron DeSantis has not signed the budget yet, and we are waiting until we have the final version of the state budget to begin conversations about our finances for the year ahead.\n\nI know this can be confusing because the Florida Legislature passed the fiscal year 2024-25 budget on March 8. But under Florida’s Constitution, the governor has 15 days to act on legislation once a bill has been presented to them. At this time, the governor has not been presented with the budget bill. FGCU continues to monitor this process closely, so please be patient and stay tuned!\n\nDON’T FORGET:\n\nThe grand re-opening celebration of Einstein Bros. Bagels. is at 9 a.m. tomorrow! FGCU has completed the first phase of a two-year process to update and remodel the Cohen Student Union. We will mark this milestone with the grand re-opening of Einstein Bros. Bagels in its original location. I hope to see you there!\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nToday marks the final day of spring classes, and the rest of the week will be dedicated to preparing for the culmination of the 2023-24 academic year. It has been a great honor to stop by classes, observe end-of-the-year presentations and recognize our students’ many accomplishments.\n\nWe will honor the Eagle Class of 2024 this weekend at Alico Arena. Many of the students who will be recognized during the four ceremonies missed an opportunity to have a traditional high school graduation due to the global pandemic, and this will be a very special moment for them and their biggest supporters. I send my congratulations to each of our graduates, and I want to preemptively thank our faculty participants, staff workers and student volunteers who have signed up to make this weekend’s events so special. Your contributions make all the difference!\n\nFrom my perspective, the past year has been an incredible year of growth for our institution. We are seeking ways to continually improve how we serve our students, and we are working together to reach our goals and objectives as outlined in the new strategic plan. We are off to an incredible start, and I know we will carry that momentum into the 2024-25 academic year.\n\nCertainly, we have welcomed many new faces to campus this year, and I want to personally invite you to a mix-and-mingle event with Colin Hargis, FGCU’s new director of intercollegiate athletics. Join us Friday, May 10, in the atrium and garden area outside of Academic Building 9, home of The Water School. The event runs from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., and it will be in the style of an open house. Light snacks and beverages will be served.\n\nColin is also going to be throwing out the first pitch the next evening during FGCU Night at Hammond Stadium. Wear your blue for FGCU and help us pack the stands as the Fort Myers Mighty Mussels play the Dunedin Blue Jays. A half-price ticket is available for all FGCU students, faculty, staff, alumni and their families. Order your tickets ($6.50, plus service fees) today at fevo-enterprise.com/event/fgcu.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nIt is the start of a new week, and I am still thinking about the energy that filled Alico Arena over the weekend as the FGCU community celebrated the many accomplishments of the Class of 2024. The stands were packed with family and friends who cheered on their graduates, and it was an honor to recognize the resilience, hard work and dedication of our FGCU graduates.\n\nThank you to all the faculty participants, staff workers and student volunteers who made this important day such a beautiful event for our 1,900 graduates and their guests. From start to finish, the ceremonies were absolutely beautiful. Your presence meant so much to the graduates and their families.\n\nGrades are due this week, and I want to thank the faculty for a successful spring term. If you are off this summer, I send you my best wishes for a safe and restful break.\n\nAs we head into the summer, I want to share that I will be changing up my messages to campus for the months of May, June and July. Starting this week, I will only be sending out messages every other week, and I will resume my weekly schedule in August. Of course, if it is needed, I will send messages that require your immediate attention.\n\nFor part of this week, I will be traveling to Washington, D.C., with representatives of our Government Relations, Alumni and Research & Sponsored Programs offices. We will be meeting with various elected officials to showcase the work we do here, and I’ll report back on this trip in my next message (May 20).\n\nI’ll be back in time for Thursday’s Board of Trustees workshop on metrics and performance-based funding. To learn more about the meeting, visit www.fgcu.edu/about/leadership/fgcuboardoftrustees.\n\nIf you are in town this week, please note these upcoming events:\n\nJoin us from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Friday for a mix-and-mingle event with FGCU’s new athletics director: Colin Hargis. The event will take place at Academic Building 9, home of The Water School. Light refreshments will be served (see flyer).\n\nWear your blue for FGCU and help us pack the stands for FGCU Night at Hammond Stadium. A half-price ticket is available for all FGCU students, faculty, staff, alumni and their families. Order your tickets ($6.50 + service fees) today at fevo-enterprise.com/event/fgcu.\n\nWings up and go Eagles!\n\nMay 20, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nWith the arrival of the summer term, we are counting down to the end of the fiscal year and the start of a new budget cycle. During my meetings with Cabinet and other campus leaders, we regularly discuss the upcoming budget year as an opportunity to find ways we can invest more resources and support for our staff and faculty.\n\nWithout a doubt, we have seen incredible hard work campus-wide over the past year, and it brings me great joy to see the energy and passion surrounding our new strategic plan. I want you to know that FGCU’s leadership team is committed to building an operating budget that prioritizes increases in compensation and support for our employees so we can continue this work together, both professionally and personally.\n\nAs I have shared previously, we remain in a holding pattern for making final decisions on next year’s budget. To get to this point, we need a final state budget in place. At this time, the governor has not been presented with the budget bill from the state legislature. Once that happens, there is still a 15-day grace period for action.\n\nOur team continues to track this process closely, and I am looking forward to sharing more on our upcoming budget soon. Stay tuned!\n\nIn other news, I am proud to say FGCU’s recent trip to Washington, D.C., was an incredible opportunity to meet with members of our Southwest Florida Congressional Delegation. Among the topics we discussed were the:\n\nImplementation efforts of our five-year strategic pla\n\nExpansion of research activities, including water-quality initiative\n\nAcademic highlights of the past year, including the incredible success of our health sciences program\n\nAnd the expansion of our micro-credentialing and digital badging efforts.\n\nOur delegates made it clear that they appreciate the work happening at FGCU, and it was so wonderful to hear their ongoing commitment to supporting student success on our campus. We even talked about ways we can help our students pursue internship opportunities in congressional offices! Of course, one of the highlights of the trip was connecting with alumni members in the FGCU Washington D.C. Eagles Chapter for an after-hours reception.\n\nI send my thanks to those who came along with me on this trip, including Dr. Rose Higgins, Associate Vice President of Research & Sponsored Programs; Jennifer Goen, Director of Government Relations; Kim Wallace, Director of Alumni Relations; Angela Kunkle, Director of Development; and Susie Wentworth, Advocacy Coordinator in Government Relations. This trip proves once again that we have incredible support for our university in our community and beyond!\n\nMy next scheduled update will come out on June 3. As always, Wings Up and go Eagles!\n\nJune 3, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nWe may have kicked off the summer term, a time when fewer students and faculty are around campus, but it has been anything but slow! For one, FGCU has been reaching out to the far reaches of our five-county service area to host town hall conversations, continue partnerships and build new relationships. These efforts speak to strategic plan Goal 3: Elevate Partnerships for Regional Impact.\n\nLast week, we traveled to Clewiston for an event for the Hendry and Glades county communities, where we spent time talking about our rural outreach efforts, connections with the K-12 school systems and the future of agribusiness. This week, we head north to Charlotte County to strengthen our work in this community.\n\nOne of the topics we make sure to highlight is the incredible success of our alumni. While we have many examples of our fine flock of Eagle alumni, I want to highlight one of them in today’s message. FGCU softball legend Courtney Platt has been inducted into the Atlantic Sun Conference Class of 2024 Hall of Fame! She was honored for playing for the Eagles from 2008 to 2011. We are so proud of her!\n\nWe want to share more stories like this as we amplify FGCU’s brand under the new strategic plan. To help us in this endeavor, FGCU has hired BVK, a nationally known marketing firm in the higher education space. While we are at the initial stage of kicking off this work, consultants will be meeting with identified stakeholder groups for interviews this week. This includes shared governance groups, donors, alumni and other constituent groups on campus. I will share updates as the process evolves.\n\nOn this note, I expect to share news of the search process for our new Vice President of Strategic Initiatives & Chief of Staff position in the coming weeks. The search panel has been formed, with Vice President David Vazquez, who oversees the division of Administrative Services & Finance, serving as chair.\n\nSAVE THE DATE | The next regular meeting of the Board of Trustees begins at 8:30 a.m. June 11 in the Cohen Student Union Ballroom. Details of the meeting’s agenda can be reviewed online, but the meeting will be conducted in person. We understand that attendance isn’t possible for all of our faculty, staff and students, so we will begin writing meeting recaps to share with our campus community.\n\nMy next scheduled update will come out on June 17. As always, Wings Up and go Eagles!\n\nJune 17, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nA little over two weeks ago, I announced a leadership change in General Counsel. I am pleased to announce that Lisa Jones has been selected to serve as interim General Counsel while we launch a national search with Greenwood Asher & Associates for the Vice President and General Counsel position.\n\nMany of you are familiar with Lisa, who joined FGCU 11 years ago as Associate General Counsel. Her previous experience includes serving as University Counsel and Secretary to the Board for Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas, as well as Associate General Counsel for Wichita State University and the Kansas Board of Regents.\n\nI know she will do a phenomenal job in this interim role, and she is already working closely with outgoing Vice President and General Counsel Vee Leonard to ensure a smooth transition in the leadership of that office.\n\nOn that note, I invite you to join in celebrating Vee’s incredible 19 years of service to our campus community. Vee’s farewell reception is from 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, July 2, on the third floor of Edwards Hall, with the reception taking place in the open lobby area and Conference Room 309. RSVPs are not required.\n\nAnother event I want to make sure you are aware of is this week’s Ice Cream Social! FGCU leaders will be passing out free ice cream to faculty and staff between noon and 2 p.m. Tuesday (June 18) in the covered alcove area near Ben Hill Griffin Hall. Please mark your calendars, bring your colleagues and enjoy a refreshing treat on what will probably be a warm day in Southwest Florida!\n\nSpeaking of weather, it’s important to note that we are already seeing an uptick in weather events related to the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. Employees, please pay attention to the emergency notifications shared from the FGCU Update email account and download the RAVE Guardian Eagle App. If you need to update your cell phone and emergency contact information, please do so through Workday.\n\nMy next scheduled update will come out on July 1.\n\nAs always, Wings Up and go Eagles!\n\nJune 24, 2024\n\nGood morning, Eagle Family!\n\nI think it is safe to say last week’s Ice Cream Social was a big hit! It was wonderful to get out of the office, see our colleagues from across campus and enjoy a homemade treat in the middle of the work week.\n\nFGCU’s leadership team has decided to make the Ice Cream Social an ongoing staff and faculty appreciation event. Please mark your calendars for 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. for the following dates:\n\n(Tomorrow) Tuesday, June 25\n\nWednesday, July 10\n\nTuesday, July 16\n\nWednesday, July 24\n\nThe free ice cream will be handed out in the covered alcove area near Ben Hill Griffin Hall. Please make sure to scan the QR code when you pick up your ice cream! Your feedback will help us add new flavors to the rotation and assist with market research to see if it is feasible to launch an ice cream business that will eventually be run by FGCU students. Provost Mark Rieger will have more information about this initiative in the Academic Affairs newsletter.\n\nWhile enjoying ice cream last week, many of you asked about the state of our Library Lawn. As we do each summer, FGCU is using the slower months to upgrade our campus grounds and facilities with ongoing maintenance, such as replacing roofs, upgrading interior lighting, installing new carpet, painting and pressure cleaning campus.\n\nHere is a list of work going on across campus:\n\nThe Library Lawn is being updated with improved drainage and new sod. The project will be completed before the start of the fall term.\n\nThe Information Technology Services (ITS) help desk is moving from Griffin Hall to the first floor of the Wilson G. Bradshaw Library. This provides our employees and students with a more centralized location to access help. The project will be completed before the start of the fall term.\n\nFour large digital signs are being added to campus. One will be placed near the Cohen Student Union, with the other three located along our three entrances to campus. This project will continue through the fall term.\n\nThe food court area and bathroom flooring in Cohen Student Union is also being upgraded this summer. This project will finish prior to the larger Phase II portion of the Cohen remodel, which will kick into high gear during the 2025 summer term.\n\nFGCU is also cleaning and painting parking garages across campus, and we are repaving the parking area near Alico Arena.\n\nWe are also planning to create brick-paved pathways near Merwin and Whitaker halls for pedestrian and golf cart traffic. The project will be completed before the start of the fall term.\n\nAs you can see, we are making great use of the summer months to improve our campus.\n\nI look forward to seeing you out and about! Wings Up and go Eagles!\n\nJuly 1, 2024\n\nHello, Eagle Family!\n\nToday marks my one-year anniversary of officially serving as FGCU’s president. Leading up to this milestone, I have been reflecting on all that has transpired in the past year, including our biggest accomplishments and the incredible work that has gone into developing a culture of continuous improvement.\n\nOf top of mind is the creation and launch of a new strategic plan that guides our journey forward in terms of service to students. Embedding student success into the fabric of our campus ensures we are doing our all to help each student reach their academic goals and career ambitions. I referenced this last week during the Florida Board of Governors meeting, when our accountability plan and performance-based funding metrics were presented.\n\nThrough each division on campus, we are aligning our actions to our strategic plan, ensuring our goals and objectives are part of day-to-day operations. Already, we are moving the needle and seeing improvement, and that’s a testament to the data-driven approach we have embraced. By using predictive analytics to track each students’ progress from orientation to graduation, our faculty and staff are able to focus on the unique needs of our students like never before.\n\nAs we balance the loss in performance-based funding with our strategic vision forward and allocate necessary resources for improving our metrics, under the guidance of the FGCU Board of Trustees, campus leaders and I remain dedicated to improving the lives of all employees with a compensation package regardless of bargaining. We are keenly aware of the strain felt campus-wide by the Southwest Florida economy, and our primary motivation is to equitably enhance the well-being of all of our employees in our journey forward. I will have more information about what this looks like in an upcoming message, but I want to send my sincere appreciation and gratitude to all of our staff and faculty for the incredible dedication and hard work shown in the past year.\n\nWe are a team, and many of our successes from the past year will appear in the university’s first-ever annual report. Campus leaders are currently creating this document, and we anticipate it will launch in time for the 2024 Fall Kickoff Celebration for faculty and staff. Pamela McCabe will share more information about our annual celebration tomorrow, but please place a hold in your calendar for 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Friday, Aug. 9.\n\nIn closing, I want to share that I reread my very first message to campus. I wrote about the excitement I had for the work that stood before us as we prepared for a new year of teaching, learning and working collaboratively. Twelve months later, I still feel that energy and passion, and I am so proud of all we have achieved together – and what is still to come. It is an absolute honor to be your president, and I thank you for making this past year so memorable.\n\nDON’T FORGET\n\nJoin us for Vice President & General Counsel Vee Leonard’s farewell reception from 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, July 2, on the third floor of Edwards Hall. RSVPs are not required.\n\nThe next FREE ice cream social is from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, July 9. This is a date change. Please see the attached flyer for all upcoming dates.\n\nMy next scheduled update will come out on July 15.\n\nWings Up and go Eagles!\n\nJuly 15, 2024\n\nDear Eagle Family,\n\nWe are about one month away from the start of the fall semester, and that means we are about a month away from a new edition of the Inside FGCU employee newsletter coming out. The newsletter was an initiative we kicked off last year to provide more information about campus happenings and employee milestones to our faculty and staff as one of our university-wide communication channels.\n\nDuring the summer, changes were made to this publication – all of which were informed by feedback we received through the campus-wide internal communications survey. Thank you to all of the employees who brought forth feedback on this product. It is currently undergoing a redesign, as we are adjusting the size and look of the product. While we will continue to produce the newsletter electronically, it will only be delivered in printed form to employees and offices that opt-in for the product. If you are interested in receiving free printed copies, beginning with the August 20 edition, please click here to fill out a request form.\n\nI am also pleased to announce the new members of the Editorial Advisory Committee, who will be working on this initiative this year:\n\nAshlynn Dunn of the Lutgert College of Business\n\nDayna Harpster of WGCU Public Media\n\nEmily Helm of University Recreation & Wellness\n\nVince Modarelli of University Advancement\n\nJonathan Schaffer of Daveler & Kauanui School of Entrepreneurship\n\nKara Simmons of Alumni Relations\n\nI’Riel Williams of Innovative Education & Partnerships\n\nStaff support for Inside FGCU is provided by Rubi Olvera, the coordinator of University Communications & Media Relations, and Dave Anderson, the associate director of design in University Marketing & Communications.\n\nI will be sharing more details about upcoming changes related to the internal communications survey in future messages.\n\nFinally, as you see in the attachment, we are also a month away from the 2024 Fall Kickoff Celebration. This event is like a pep rally for the new academic year, where we celebrate our employees, gather for a lunch served by university leaders, and hear the annual State of the University address. All attendees will receive a free gift on their way back to work, and Azul will be giving out a special prize to the most spirited Eagle in the room. The event is from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. August 9 at Alico Arena. Make sure to RSVP by August 1, and don’t forget to wear your FGCU gear! This event excites me so much as we, Eagle family, start the new academic year. See the attachment for more information.\n\nSAVE THE DATES\n\nThe next free Ice Cream Social is from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. tomorrow (July 16) in the covered alcove area next to Ben Hill Griffin Hall. See the Academic Affairs newsletter for more information.\n\nMy next scheduled message comes out on July 29, and I will be resuming weekly emails in August.\n\nWings Up and Go Eagles!"
