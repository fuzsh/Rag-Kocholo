        "text": "Country fans may not recognize the face – or even the name – of Manuel Cuevas, but they definitely know his work: the elaborately embroidered rhinestone-studded outfits that became practically a uniform for many country artists. From Elvis’s gold lamé suit to Johnny Cash’s all-black stage attire, Manuel has been outfitting the stars since the 1950s.\n\nSewing came naturally to Manuel. He learned to stitch from his brother at age 7 and by 14 was designing prom dresses. In 1952, he migrated from Mexico to Los Angeles where he found work with Sy Devore, known for his high-end tailoring of Hollywood’s Rat Pack: Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and others. Tailoring “boring suits, tuxedos every week,” however, did not suit Cuevas’s flamboyant style. It was at the Rose Parade in Pasadena, with glittering costumes designed by rodeo tailor Nathan Turk – who also made suits for western stars like the Maddox Brothers and Rose – that Manuel first got a glimpse of his future. “I said, ‘Oh my God, who in the world makes these clothes?’” Manuel recalled. “I want to meet this man!”\n\nNathan Turk wasn’t hiring, so Cuevas got a job with Nudie Cohn, the Hollywood tailor who would make the style famous and give “Nudie suits” their name. Manuel became Nudie’s lead tailor, incorporating motifs from the American West, Eastern Europe, Native American cultures, and his own home country Mexico into the designs. Cohn and Cuevas clothed everyone from Cosmic American country-rocker Gram Parsons to the Man in Black, Johnny Cash.\n\nCash became very popular and he says, “Man, I’m going on the road and I’m going to need clothes.” So I measured him and he said, “I want nine suits.” And I hurried up and made the outfits. And here’s this voice on the phone that you can never forget, you know: “Hello. This is Johnny Cash.” (Laughing) I said, “Yes, John.” He says, “I got the suits that you sent me.” He says, “How come they are all black?” So I thought I’d kid him. I said, “Well, there was a special on black fabric.” (Laughing) And, sure enough, three, four months later, when he was through with the tour, he said, “I want you to make me clothes every week. And I want you to dress my band.” He says, “The color is never in question anymore.”\n\nIn 1975, Manuel opened his own store in L.A., bringing clients like Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton, and George Jones with him. He became the go-to tailor for new performers just finding their style – artists like Marty Stuart and Dwight Yoakam, who trusted Cuevas to create a look that would be uniquely theirs. Over this same period he maintained a working relationship with designer Edith Head, creating costumes for more than 90 movies and 13 television shows, including the jeans worn by James Dean in the movie Giant and the Lone Ranger’s iconic mask.\n\nAfter 40 years in Hollywood, Manuel moved his shop to Nashville. His clothing has been exhibited at the Frist Art Museum and the Country Music Hall of Fame, and he has received lifetime achievement awards from Nashville and Los Angeles. In 2018, Cuevas was named an NEA National Heritage Fellow. He continues to work daily out of his storefront at the corner of 8th and Broadway. “Every new child, as I call each of my outfits,” he says, “is the best.”\n\nBorn: April 23, 1933, Coalcomán, Michoacán, Mexico"
