NASHVILLE (CelebrityAccess) Deana Martin, daughter of Dean Martin, is about to launch a series of celebrity roasts, following in her famous father’s footsteps.

The Deana Martin Celebrity Roasts will be offered to casinos and theatres and will only be available once per month, with only 12 events offered this year.

“We are extremely excited about bringing The Deana Martin Celebrity Roasts to casinos, performing arts centers and ballrooms around North America,” producer Robert Williams of WBA Entertainment said. “Dean proved that everyone loves a good laugh. Now, Deana continues the legacy that her father created.”

In April, Martin “roasted” Joe Mantegna at the South Point Casino in Las Vegas. She brought along “Criminal Minds” co-stars Matthew Gary Gubler and Kirsten Vangsness, NYPD Blue star Gail O’Grady, Joe Piscopo, Lou Martini Jr., Clifton Collins, Mike Marino, Tom Dreesen and Las Vegas local Kelly Clinton as “Ruth Buzzi.” Other celebrity roasts have included Robert Davi, Rich Little, Tony Lo Bianco, and Robin Leach.

“I had so much fun roasting Joe Mantegna,” Martin said. “I now understand why my dad loved doing the roasts. We are going to continue the fun! So now, I am pulling friends together like Tony Orlando, Andy Garcia, Bobby Rydell, Frankie Valli, and others to be roasted for these special monthly events.”
