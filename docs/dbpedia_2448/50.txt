Wing Commander Ken Gatward’s audacious act saw him flying his Bristol Beaufighter along the Champs-Elysees only 30ft off the ground before dropping the flag and raking the Gestapo HQ with 20mm shells.

His bravery was celebrated in newspaper cartoons and he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

The story of Mr Gatward’s 1942 heroics have been revealed as his medals – including his DFC with bar and a Distinguished Service Order – are put up for auction following the death of his widow, Pamela.

His log books, a champagne case inscribed “In remembrance of your flight over Paris”, and a souvenir booklet are also being sold.

James Grinter, of Colchester auctioneers Reeman Dansie, said: “Ken Gatward’s act of bravery is a real Boy’s Own story – one that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.

“He flew down the Champs-Elysees at second-floor window height. It was an incredible act of bravery.

“He attacked the Gestapo HQ and SS troops were seen to run for their lives. The attack gave Parisians one of the greatest thrills of the war and had a huge effect on morale.”

Mr Gatward, awarded a second DFC in 1944 for an aerial attack, lived in Frinton-on-Sea, Essex and died in 1998 aged 84.

His items are expected to fetch £8,000 at the auction on Friday.
