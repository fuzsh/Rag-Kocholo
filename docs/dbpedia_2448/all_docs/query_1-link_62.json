        "text": "Richard Maddox\n\nON THE NIGHT of 3 – 4 March 1942 the Avro Lancaster bomber conducted its first operational sortie when No. 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF undertook a ‘GARDENING’ (mine-laying) operation off Heligoland Bight.\n\nNo. 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF was the first squadron to be equipped with the new aircraft that would become perhaps the most celebrated bomber of the Second World War.\n\nBut its entry into operational service – like the genesis of the design itself – wasn’t a smooth one.\n\nSix weeks later it would send six aircraft, together with six from No.97 Squadron to attack the MAN engine factory at Augsburg in a low-level daylight raid. The factory was producing engines for the Kriegsmarine U-Boot fleet.\n\nThe raid was daring and the cost high.\n\nSeven aircraft – five from No. 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF – would be lost.\n\nSouth African-born Squadron Leader John Dering Nettleton who captained Lancaster R5508, – the only surviving aircraft from the squadron and who lead the raid – would be awarded the Victory Cross, Britain’s highest award for valour in the face of the enemy. (1) (2)\n\nIn all, some 7,377 Lancasters were produced. Each cost between £45,000 and £50,000 – equivalent to around £2,000,000.\n\nThey flew some 156.000 wartime sorties and delivered 608,612 tons of bombs in 156,000 sorties.\n\nAround half of these were lost on operations, together with over 21,000 crew members, the lucky few taken prisoner.\n\nAlthough able to fly higher and faster than the other four-engined ‘Heavies’ in RAF service, the Lancaster was vulnerable to attack from beneath and was a difficult aircraft to escape from in an emergency. (3)\n\nA report from Bomber Command’s Operational Research Section concluded that the Lancaster had the lowest crew survival rate when compared to the Short Stirling and Handley-Page Halifax heavy bomber aircraft used by the RAF.\n\nReasons for this were given as a tendency for the Avro aircraft to break up in the air under some conditions, its long, thin fuselage which was difficult to more around in.\n\nThe rear and mid-upper gunners had the least chance of survival at just over 8%, while 13.8% of navigators survived. More than sixty-eight percent of aircraft analysed in the report had no survivors recorded. (4)\n\nMore Information\n\nEmerging from the Avro 679 (named the Manchester in RAF service) – a 1937 twin-engined medium bomber design which was to prove underpowered and problematic in service – the much revised Avro 683 (Lancaster) was a larger and more powerful design. (5)\n\nThe Lancaster would replace its predecessor after only 16 months in operational service. Remaining Manchester aircraft were used to train Lancaster crews before being retired in 1943.

One man still wears his ‘Mae West’ life preserver. Around them others talk in small groups as they wait for their turn to be debriefed on the raid, or search for friends .\n\nA hot cooked breakfast waits in the mess but they are in no hurry.\n\nThe empty chairs at the tables will only add to the sights, sounds and smells they have already experienced.\n\nFor each man the truth – the deep hidden truth – can’t be shared with scribbling Intelligence Officers, loving wives and girlfriends, jocular ground crew or earnest padres.\n\nThey can only share it with those who have had a part in its making.\n\nWho these men are in Pilot Officer Forward’s evocative photograph, the target they attacked, the precise date of the operation or even the location of the their base – the squadron moved from RAF Pocklingon to RAF Topcliffe in August 1942 – is not recorded in the online IWM Collection caption with the image.\n\nHowever it could have been taken on 1 August 1942 when two waves of the squadron’s aircraft had taken off – one late on the 31 July and the other in the early hours of the following day -to attack Düsseldorf in Germany. (1)\n\nCasualties amongst the attacking force were heavy. (2)\n\nThis was the Squadron’s 111th operation (3) and one where 630 aircraft (including 105 from No. 92 Group RAF which was responsible for Operational Training Units) were sent against the target.\n\nIt was the first time that more than 100 Avro Lancaster aircraft were seen on a raid together and 484 aircraft (dropping 900 tons of explosives) claimed to have hit the target – although post-raid analysis showed that a significant amount of ordnance fell in open country, possibly due to industrial haze and smoke from the ground. (4) (5)\n\n… the general impression was that the raid was a complete success and Pilot Officer Hill* suggested:\n\n‘It was a better attack than Cologne’.\n\nFires that covered whole city area with a pall of reddish black smoke rolling up, were seen for 80 miles on the return journey. ...(6)\n\nOverall, twenty-nine aircraft were lost (some 4.6% of the total of those despatched). Among them were four Halifax aircraft (the type used by No. 405 Squadron).\n\nOf these four aircraft two came from No. 405 Squadron. Losses from No 92 Group were 15 training aircraft and crews – 10.5% of the number they supplied. (7)\n\nNotes\n\nNo. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Force was the first Canadian squadron to be formed overseas during the Second World War. Less than two months after being formed at RAF Driffield on 23 April 1941 it carried out its first bombing operation on the night of 12 June, when a number of aircraft successfully attacked a rail marshaling yard at Schwerte in Germany. (8)\n\nIn April 1942 the squadron became a ‘heavy’ bomber squadron, converting from the two-engined Vickers Wellington to the more capable four-engined Handley Page Halifax and a month later was part of the ‘1000 bomber raid’ (Operation MILLENIUM) on Cologne.\n\nIt would continue to fly the type for most of its Second World War service.\n\nDuring the months of July and August 1942 – the period that Pilot Officer Forward the RAF photograoher who captured his striking image – the squadron flew 17 offensive operations, eleven of these in July. (9)\n\nIn October Halifax aircraft from No. 405 and No. 158 Squadron RAF together with a number of Liberator aircraft from US Eighth Air Force were attached to RAF Coastal Command and carried out anti-submarine patrols over the Bay of Biscay as well as anti-shipping sweeps along the German coast.\n\nReturning to Bomber Command in March 1942, it then became one of the original eight squadrons that made up No.6 Group – a political compromise between the British and Canadian governments – the former wanting to maintain control of all Commonwealth squadrons based in Britain and the latter who wished to see an independent Canadian Air Force serving alongside the RAF.\n\nThe final move for No. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron was out of No. 6 Group RAF to No. 8 Group RAF – the Pathfinder Force where it would remain for the rest of the conflict as the only Canadian squadron.\n\nIn total the squadron flew 3852 sorties against 450 targets. It carried out more operations than any other Canadian squadron. Losses overall were 112 aircraft (2.9%).\n\nHowever as part of No. 4 Group – and later when with No. 6 Group – aircraft losses were 6.6 percent and 7.3 percent respectively. (10)\n\nCasualties in invidual raids were often much highter.\n\nOn the night of the 27 June 1942, eleven of the squadron’s aircraft were detailed to become part of a force of 144 aircraft to attack Bremen.(11) (12)\n\nThe force was made up of a variety of aircraft – 55 Wellington twin-engined medium bombers, 39 Halifaxes, 26 Stirlings and 24 Lancasters. Of these, 119 aircraft bombed using ‘special equipment’ or using their time in the air to calculate their position.(13) (14)\n\nFour Wellingtons, two Halifaxes, two Lancasters and a Stirling were lost that night. (15)\n\nBoth Halifaxes were from No.405 (Vancouver) Squadron RCAF. (16)\n\nThe next operation – the squadron’s 100th – took place on the night of 30 June 1942.\n\nAgain a mixed force of 253 aircraft was assembled. Again the target was Bremen.\n\nFor the first time the combined number of four-engined aircraft of all types (145) outnumbered those of the Wellingtons.\n\nAmongst the eleven aircraft lost were three Halifax bombers (17) and again all these were from No. 405 Squadron, RCAF.\n\nThe Squadron contributed nine aircraft, two of which returned early with mechanical problems.(18)\n\nThe seven remaining attacking the target.\n\nOnly four aircraft from the nine dispatched returned to base having carried out their tasking.\n\nReturning in the early hours of 24 July 1942 from the Squadron’s 107th operation – an attack on Duisburg – the Halifax flown by Flight Sergeant Robert Baker Albright ** crashed in flames in the nearby small market town of Pocklington. The crew, having completed one circuit of its home base in preparation to land experienced a sudden engine failure and lost contol.\n\nHaving clipped a private house in the town, the aircraft crashed into a school building. All the crew were killed. Of the nine aircraft from No. 405 Squadron detailed for this raid, this aircraft was the only loss. (19)(20)(21)(22)\n\nOne third of all RAF Bomber Command aircrew were Canadians.(23)\n\nThe Squadron’s motto ‘Ducimus’ – ‘We lead‘ testifies to its standing during the Second World War.\n\n* A Squadron Leader Howard Stephenson Hill, DFC, RCAF is buried at Dishforth Cemetery, Yorkshire, England having been killed during a training exercise with 1659 Heavy Conversion Unit (1659 HCU – the unit title after the merger of No. 405 Squadron Conversion Flight and No. 408 Squadron Conversion Flight) on 18 April 1943.\n\nHis Distinguished Flying Cross award was announced in the Supplement to the London Gazette, dated 12 January 1943.\n\nSee the following links for more information.\n\nhttps://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2407538/hill,-howard-stephenson/\n\nhttp://www.yorkshire-aircraft.co.uk/aircraft/yorkshire/york43/r9448.html http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/canadian-virtual-war-memorial/detail/2407538\n\nFurther information\n\n‘Operation MILLENNIUM’ is the subject of a May 2017 post on this blog (Operation MILLENNIUM and how Hamburg was saved at the cost of Cologne).\n\nSources\n\n(1) No. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron Operational Record Book, File reference Air 27/1787/27 (July 1942) – UK National Archives, Kew, England.\n\n(2) Bomber Command Campaign Diaries – July 1942: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706055105/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/jul42.html – retrieved 8 August 2018.\n\n(3) No. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron Operational Record Book Air 27/1787/27 (July 1942) – UK National Archives, Kew, England.\n\n(4) Bomber Command Campaign Diaries – July 1942 (ibid).\n\n(5) No. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron Operational Record Book (ibid).\n\n(6) No. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron Operational Record Book (ibid).\n\n(7) Bomber Command Campaign Diaries – July 1942 (ibid).\n\n(8) No. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron Operational Record Book – Air 27/1787/21 (April 1942) – UK National Archives, Kew, England.\n\n(9) No. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron Operational Record Book (ibid).\n\n(10) http://www.lancaster-archive.com/bc_sqn_405.htm – retrieved 7 August 2018.\n\n(11) No. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron Operational Record Book – Air 27/1787/25 (June 1942) – UK National Archives, Kew, England.\n\n(12) Bomber Command Campaign Diaries – June 1942:\n\nhttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706054659/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/jun42.html – retrieved 8 August 2018.\n\n(13) Bomber Command Campaign Diaries – June 1942 (ibid).\n\n(14) No. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron Operational Record Book – June 1942 (ibid).\n\n(15) Bomber Command Campaign Diaries – June 1942 (ibid).\n\n(16) No. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron Operational Record Book – June 1942 (ibid).\n\n(17) Bomber Command Campaign Diaries – June 1942 (ibid).\n\n(18) No. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron Operational Record Book – June 1942 (ibid).\n\n(19) No. 405 (Vancouver) Squadron Operational Record Book – June 1942 (ibid).\n\n(20) http://www.405sqn.com/pocklington.html – retrieved 8 August 2018.\n\n(21) http://www.yorkshire-aircraft.co.uk/aircraft/yorkshire/york42/w7769.html – retrieved 8 August 2018.\n\n(22) https://joepavia.com/2018/06/30/bill-thurlow-flight-sergeant-and-warrant-officer-second-class/comment-page-1/ – retrieved 8 August 2018.\n\n(23) http://www.bombercommandmuseum.ca/contribution.html – retrieved 8 August 2018.\n\nBY RICHARD MADDOX\n\nSEVENTY FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY a single RAF aircraft undertook an audacious mission to boost the morale of the French population.\n\nNINETEEN FORTY ONE wasn’t a good year for Occupied France and there was no reason to think that 1942 would be any better.\n\nThe Occupation continues to make daily life in France – and indeed in all the countries under German control – difficult in many ways.\n\nFrance is physically and ideologically divided. Troops are on the streets of the Occupied Zone. The Résistance and German authorities continue the cycle of assassinations and reprisals.\n\nPower struggles between Guallist and communist factions split the Résistance.\n\nFactories have been taken over to manufacture products for the Germans.\n\nRationing continues for the French population.\n\nMass arrests of communist sympathisers started in 1941 and Jewish citizens are coming under increasing scrutiny – not just from the Germans directly but through the occupying forces using the French authorities and their Vichy allies to enforce the new order.\n\nUnable to lure foreign workers to Germany itself by the promise of better rations, the German controlled Service du Travail Obligatoire (a scheme whereby more than half a million people were forcibly sent to work in Germany) was just starting.\n\nAfter the evacuation at Dunkirk and the destruction of units of the French naval fleet by the Royal Navy in August 1940, many felt in France and elsewhere felt Britain needed to show its support.\n\nThus Operation SQUABBLE was born.\n\nOrganised by the Special Operations Executive and Air Chief Marshal Sir Philip Joubert de la Ferté (himself of French descent) the original plan was for a single attacking aircraft to fly along the mile-long Avenue des Champs-Élysées just as the German Army were parading there and – if the opportunity presented itself – attack the nearby former French Ministre de la Marine (now occupied as the Germany Naval headquarters in France).\n\nSir Philip was Commander-in-Chief of Coastal Command, the branch of the RAF that operated closely with the Royal Navy and – critical in these circumstances – attack small targets at low level.\n\nCoastal Command had both the aircraft and the aircrew to mount an attack such as this.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Alfred Kitchener ‘Ken’ Gatward was a leading anti-shipping attack expert and was offered the chance of carrying out the attack. It was stressed that it would be an ‘unsafe’ mission using a single aircraft without further support.\n\nGatward and his navigator, Flight Sergeant Gilbert ‘George’ Fern immediately started planning the flight and honing their skills by carrying out attacks on an abandoned wreck in the English Channel.\n\nThe day of the attack dawned and improving weather – that is the lack of cloud cover – forced the pair back to England while they were over France.\n\nThis happened not once but three times and without the advantage of surprise the mission was doomed.\n\nSo on 12 June 1942 the aircraft left the Coastal Command airfield at Thorney Island, Hampshire (just outside Portsmouth) for what the crew had decided would be the final attempt. They had decide that there was to be no more practising.\n\nThis was it.\n\nThey would fly the whole mission at low level to give them the best chance.\n\nCrossing the French coast half an hour after take-off, they managed to avoid both fighter aircraft and flak positions.\n\nAt one point some 30 feet (10 metres above the ground) the aircraft scattered a murder of crows. One lodged in the engine air intake, causing the motor to overheat.\n\nStill they flew on.\n\nApproaching Paris from the south they rounded the Eiffel Tower and then headed for the Arc de Triomphe at the top of the Champs-Élysées.\n\nTheir canons primed and ready, they reportedly flew at less than roof top height down the Champs-Élysées. But not until they had sent one of two banners (made from a French naval ensign back in Britain) fluttering down on the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nBut their German army quarry eluded them. The military parade – something that happened every day after midday – was nowhere to be seen.\n\nInstead the crew saw groups of French people happily waving to the aircraft.\n\nAt the other end of the Avenue, the Place de la Concorde with its fountains and the Luxor monument grew ever larger.\n\nSwinging around the 75-foot Egyptian obelisk they lining up on their second objective, the Naval Headquarters.\n\nGatward fired a volley of 20mm shells into the building before dropping the second banner and making off north towards Gare Saint Lazare railway station and then coming around westward to return to England – again at low level.\n\nLanding at RAF Northolt not far from central London, he and Fern delivered 60 photographic images of Paris.\n\nIn 2012 Gatward’s Second World War medal group, together with memorabilia about the flight were sold at auction for £51,000.\n\nSources and more information\n\nhttp://www.reemandansie.com/departments/coins-militaria/\n\nhttp://www.vintagewings.ca/VintageNews/Stories/tabid/116/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/450/Ten-Minute-Triumph-Over-Tyranny.aspx\n\nhttp://www.neatorama.com/2012/12/06/June-1942-RAF-Drops-French-Flag-on-Occupied-Paris-Strafes-Gestapo-HQ/\n\nBY RICHARD MADDOX\n\nTHE NIGHT OF THE 30-31 May 2017 marks the 75th anniversary of the first RAF 1,000 bomber raid against targets in Germany.\n\nIn order to meet the number of aircraft to be sent, planes were begged from as many units as possible – including operational training units – with just 678 aircraft being front line bombers of all different shapes, sizes and capacities.\n\nEventually 1,047 aircraft would take off on the raid – more than 2.5 times the number of the previous biggest raid.\n\nOf the aircraft that took off 868 claimed to have bombed the target releasing 1,455 tons of bombs (60% incendiary bombs). As was the norm at this period of the war only around two-thirds of the bombs landed in the city.\n\nBut this, the first use of the bomber stream tactic with all aircraft passing over the target in just 90 minutes, still accounted for the loss of 5.2% of Cologne’s buildings, 486 people killed, 5,000 injured and almost 60,000 made homeless.\n\nThe poem below by George Crocker, a former air gunner who served with of No. 218 (Gold Coast) Squadron, RAF paints an evocative picture of the crews setting out on the night of 30 May 1942.\n\nIt (and the poem’s explanatory notes ) were published in ‘The Aussie Mossie’ magazine in December 2007.\n\nCologne, 1942\n\nThe briefing room was crowded\n\nWith twenty crews, or more\n\nWe saw the target map and route\n\nAnd guessed what was in store\n\nThe air is thick with rumour\n\n“It’s a Happy Valley (1) treat”\n\nThe CO (2) enters quickly\n\nWe clatter to our feet\n\n“A message from the C-in-C (3)”\n\nWe raise a muted groan\n\n“A thousand aircraft on tonight –\n\nYour target is Cologne”\n\n“A thousand aircraft” echoes round\n\nA mocking cheer is raised\n\n“Four hundred Tiger Moths (4)” one quips\n\nYet still we are amazed\n\n“Your job tonight – to start the fires\n\nFirst there will find it tough\n\nMake it easy for the heavies (5)\n\nTo drop their back-room stuff (6)“\n\n“A thousand aircraft on Cologne\n\nGod help the bods below\n\nWith a full moon and a clear sky\n\nGod help the sods that go”\n\nThe banter crackles back and forth\n\nWeak jokes that mask strong fears\n\nFor some, this night will end with death\n\nWith horror, grief and tears\n\nAnd so we saunter to the flights\n\nEach with his thoughts alone\n\nWarsaw, Rotterdam, London burned\n\nFor them – tonight… Cologne.\n\nHappy Valley:\n\nRAF nickname for the Ruhr valley, a heavily industrialised and well-protected area of Germany, targeted by the RAF.\n\nCO:\n\nCommanding Officer – usually the man in charge of the RAF station where the bomber squadrons were based.\n\nC-in-C:\n\nCommander in Chief.\n\nAt this time Command in Chief Bomber Command was Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris GCB, OBE, AFC\n\nTiger Moths:\n\nThe De Havilland Tiger Moth was an unarmed biplane used for training RAF pilots.\n\nBack-room stuff:\n\nrefers to new types of bomb and or target markers etc.\n\nHeavies:\n\nRAF bomber aircraft were categorised by the load they could carry – light, medium or heavy. In May 1943 the RAF ‘heavies’ were the Short Stirling and Avro Manchester (both types being phased out), the Handley Page Halifax and the Avro Lancaster – more capable aircraft re-equipping Bomber Command.\n\nAlthough Cologne was the target bombed on Operation MILLENIUM it was not the first choice of Air Chief Marshall Sir Arthur Harris (‘Bomber’ Harris) head of Bomber Command.\n\nThat was to be Hamburg, a large port city on the coast and relatively easy to find using the navigation aids of the time – especially Gee that was coming into operation use. Harris’ declared aim (cited in ‘The Bombing War’ by Richard Overy) was the to wipe out the city in one night – two at the most – by carrying every single incendiary bomb possible to create an ‘unextinguishable conflagration’ in the ‘suitably combustible’ part-medieval city.\n\nBut weather concerns spared Hamburg that night – but for just over 12 months.\n\nOn the night of 23 July 1943 the RAF launched ‘Operation GOMORRAH’ against Hamburg. Reports state that around 43,000 people died in the resulting firestorm, almost half of the capacity of the modern Wembley Stadium, the home of English national football.\n\nGeorge Crocker’s RAF story with other examples of his wartime poetry can be found at\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/82/a8927382.shtml (accessed 19 May 2017)."
