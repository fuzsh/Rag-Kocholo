        "text": "Member of the Order of Canada (CM)\n\nEstablished in 1967 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the Order of Canada is the cornerstone of the Canadian Honours System, and recognizes outstanding achievement, dedication to the community and service to the nation. The Order recognizes people in all sectors of Canadian society. Their contributions are varied, yet they have all enriched the lives of others and made a difference to this country.\n\nThe insignia of the Order is a stylized snowflake of six points, with a red annulus at its centre which bears a stylized maple leaf circumscribed with the motto of the Order, DESIDERANTES MELIOREM PATRIAM (They desire a better country), surmounted by the Royal Crown. It is struck in fine silver and is composed of three individual pieces: the snowflake, annulus and maple leaf. The colour is added by hand through a unique application of opaque and translucent viscous enamel.\n\nLieutenant The Honourable Charles Joseph Holland Locke CC MC QC was appointed a companion in 1971.\n\nCaptain Edward John Hughes CM OBC was appointed a member of the Order of Canada in 2001.\n\nCommander of The Order of Military Merit (CMM)\n\nFounded on July 1, 1972, the Order of Military Merit recognizes distinctive merit and exceptional service displayed by the men and women of the Canadian Forces, both Regular and Reserve. Many have demonstrated dedication and devotion beyond the call of duty, and the Order honours them for their commitment to Canada. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the Order’s Sovereign, Their Excellency, the Governor General is its Chancellor and a Commander of the Order, the Chief of the Defence Staff is its Principal Commander. The Commander of The Order of Military Merit recognizes outstanding meritorious service and demonstrated leadership in duties of great responsibility.\n\nThe badge of the Order is a blue-enamelled, straight-end cross (four arms, narrow at the centre, wider at the ends) with an annulus in red surmounted by St. Edward’s Crown.

They honour achievements in both military and civil divisions. The Meritorious Service Decorations (Civil Division) were established to recognize remarkable contributions in many different fields of endeavour, from advocacy initiatives and health care services, to research and humanitarian efforts. Past recipients have tackled poverty in their community, improved education opportunities for children in Canada and abroad, or raised awareness of important causes and issues.\n\nHonorary Colonel Allan Frank De Genova MSM Awarded 3 May 2022\n\n​The Order of British Columbia (OBC)\n\n​The Order was established by statute on April 21, 1989, to recognize those persons who have served with the greatest distinction and excelled in any field of endeavour benefiting the people of the Province of British Columbia or elsewhere. The Order represents the highest form of recognition the Province can extend to its citizens. The Order will be bestowed on the most outstanding British Columbians possessing the above qualifications annually.\n\nCaptain Edward John Hughes CM OBC was awarded the Order of British Columbia in 2005.\n\nCommander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)\n\nFor the Commander of the Order of the British Empire there is no star and the neck badge is smaller than that of the Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. For mounting a ring is attached to the top of the crown through which a larger ring passes.\n\nObverse of the medal:\n\nOriginal Badge: A cross patonce (four arms with three points on each arm) of silver-gilt with the arms enameled pearl-grey, surmounted by an Imperial Crown. The circular centre, in gold, shows the figure of Britannia, holding a trident and seated beside a shield bearing the national flag.

This is a military order for officers only, and while normally given for service under fire or under conditions equivalent to service in actual combat with the enemy, it was awarded between 1914 and 1916 under circumstances which could not be regarded as under fire. After 01 January 1917, commanders in the field were instructed to recommend this award only for those serving under fire. Prior to 1943, the order could be given only to someone Mentioned-in-Dispatches. The order is generally given to officers in command, above the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and awards to ranks below this are usually for a high degree of gallantry just short of deserving the Victoria Cross.\n\nA bar is awarded for an act which would have earned the order in the first place. The bar is plain gold with an Imperial Crown in the centre. The year of the award is engraved on the reverse.\n\nA gold cross, enamelled gold and edged in gold. In the centre, within a wreath of laurel, enamelled green, the Imperial Crown in gold upon a red enamelled ground. On the reverse, within a wreath of laurel, enamelled green, the Royal Cypher in gold upon a red enamelled ground. A ring at the top of the medal attaches to a ring at the bottom of a gold bar, ornamented with laurel. At the top of the ribbon is a second gold bar ornamented with laurel. The red ribbon is 1.125 inches wide with narrow blue edges. A rosette is worn on the ribbon in undress to signify the award of a bar.\n\nOfficially unnamed, some recipients have privately had their names engraved on the back of the suspension bar.\n\nThere have been 1,220 Distinguished Service Orders, 119 first bars and 20 second bars awarded to Canadians.\n\nhttp://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/medals-decorations/orders-decorations\n\nLieutenant-​Colonel Frederick Thomas Coghlan DSO\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Alexander Thomas Ogilvie\n\nMajor DN Hossie DSO\n\nMajor William Wasbrough Foster DSO\n\nMajor Walter Court Hyde DSO\n\n​Bar to Distinguished Service Order (DSO)\n\nLieutenant-​Colonel William Wasbrough Foster DSO 18 January 1918 Honorary Colonel 1932-1938\n\n​Second Bar to Distinguished Service Order (DSO)\n\nLieutenant-​Colonel William Wasbrough Foster DSO 2 December 1918 Honorary Colonel 1932-1938\n\nFor citations\n\nOfficer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)\n\nThe silver-​gilt badge (2 inches wide) is gold in appear­ance with no enam­els and is worn on the left breast. the obverse of the original badge had a cross patonce (four arms with three points on each arm) of silver-​gilt with the arms enam­elled pearl-​grey, sur­mounted by an Impe­r­ial Crown.

The cen­tre is sur­rounded by a cir­cu­lar band, enam­elled crim­son and bear­ing the motto FOR GOD AND THE EMPIRE in gold.\n\nCur­rent Badge (after 1937): As above except that in the cen­tre, in gold, are the crowned effi­gies of King George V and his con­sort Queen Mary. Nei­ther the orig­i­nal nor the current OBE and MBE badges are enamelled.\n\non the reverse a rope cir­cle with the cur­rent Royal Cypher, sur­mounted by an Impe­r­ial Crown and with a hall­mark on the lower limb.\n\nA sil­ver emblem of two oak leaves is worn on the riband when the appoint­ment to the order is for gallantry. A ring is attached to the top of the crown through which a larger ring passes.\n\nOrig­i­nal: The civil rib­bon was pur­ple (1.5 inches wide). The mil­i­tary rib­bon had a nar­row cen­tral stripe of scar­let added. Cur­rent (after 1937): The civil rib­bon is rose-​pink with pearl grey edges. The mil­i­tary rib­bon has a nar­row cen­tral stripe of pearl grey added.\n\nThe order was estab­lished in June 1917. In Decem­ber 1918, mil­i­tary and civil divi­sions were established.\n\nOn 09 March 1937, the insignia and rib­bon were changed.

It ranks below the George Cross. It is only awarded for non-combat acts of bravery.\n\nThe GM was created on 24 September 1940 by King George VI. At this time, during the height of The Blitz, there was a desire to reward acts of civilian courage. It was decided that the George Cross and the GM would recognize civilian bravery in the face of enemy action and brave deeds more widely.\n\nAnnouncing the new award, the King said:\n\n\"In order that they should be worthily and promptly recognized, I have decided to create, at once, a new mark of honour for men and women in all walks of civilian life. I propose to give my name to this new distinction, which will consist of the George Cross, which will rank next to the Victoria Cross, and the George Medal for wider distribution\". The Warrant for the GM was published in the London Gazette on 31 January 1941. The medal is granted in recognition of \"acts of great bravery\".\n\nThe medal is primarily a civilian award, but it may be awarded to military personnel for gallant conduct that is not in the face of the enemy. As the Warrant states: The Medal is intended primarily for civilians and awards to military services is to be confined to actions for which purely military Honours are not normally granted. Bars are awarded to the GM in recognition of the performance of further acts of bravery meriting the award. In undress uniform or on occasions when the medal ribbon alone is worn, a silver rosette is worn on the ribbon to indicate each bar. Recipients are entitled to the postnominal letters GM.\n\n​http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/medals-decorations/orders-decorations\n\n​Lieutenant Walter Douglas Elsdon GM 19 October 1945 Commanding Officer 1962-1965\n\nMilitary Medal (MM)\n\n​The medal is awarded to Warrant Officers, non-commissioned officers and men for individual or associated acts of bravery on the recommendation of a Commander-in-Chief in the field.\n\nThe silver, laurelled bar is awarded for a subsequent act or acts of bravery and devotion under fire.\n\nA circular, silver medal, 1.42 inches in diameter with King George V: A bareheaded effigy, in Field Marshal's uniform, facing left, and the legend: GEORGIVS V BRITT: OMN: REX ET IND: IMP: or King George VI: A crowned effigy, facing left, and one of the legends:\n\nGEORGIVS VI D: G: BR: OMN: REX ET INDIAE IMP: (for WWII)\n\nGEORGIVS VI DEI GRA: BRITT: OMN: REX FID: DEF: (for Korea)\n\nQueen Elizabeth II: A crowned effigy, facing right, and the legend: ELIZABETH II D: G: BR: OMN: REGINA R: D: (for Korea)\n\nThe reverse shows FOR/BRAVERY/IN THE/FIELD in four lines, encircled by a laurel wreath and surmounted by the Royal Cypher and Imperial Crown.

Based on UN Security Council Resolution 1031, NATO was given the mandate to implement the military aspects of the Peace Agreement. A NATO-led multinational force, called the Implementation Force (IFOR), started its mission on 20 December 1995. IFOR was given a one-year mandate. After the peaceful conduct of the September 1996 elections, IFOR successfully completed its mission of implementing the military annexes of the General Framework Agreement for Peace. However, it was clear that much remained to be accomplished on the civil side and that the political environment would continue to be potentially unstable and insecure. On 25-26 September, one week after the Bosnian elections NATO Defence Ministers concluded that the Alliance needed to re-assess how it might continue to provide support for the establishment of a secure environment after the end of IFOR's mandate in December.

Based on UN Security Council Resolution 1031, NATO was given the mandate to implement the military aspects of the Peace Agreement. A NATO-led multinational force, called the Implementation Force (IFOR), started its mission on 20 December 1995. IFOR was given a one-year mandate.\n\nAfter the peaceful conduct of the September 1996 elections, IFOR successfully completed its mission of implementing the military annexes of the General Framework Agreement for Peace. However, it was clear that much remained to be accomplished on the civil side and that the political environment would continue to be potentially unstable and insecure. On 25-26 September, one week after the Bosnian elections NATO Defence Ministers concluded that the Alliance needed to re-assess how it might continue to provide support for the establishment of a secure environment after the end of IFOR's mandate in December. The role of IFOR (Operation JOINT ENDEAVOUR) was to implement the peace. The role of SFOR (Operation JOINT GUARD / Operation JOINT FORGE) is to stabilise the peace. The difference between the tasks of IFOR and SFOR is reflected in their names.\n\n12 December 1996, SFOR was authorised to implement the military aspects of the Peace Agreement as the legal successor to IFOR. Like IFOR, SFOR operates under Chapter VII of the UN Charter (peace enforcement).\n\nELIGIBILITY & CRITERIA\n\nAwarded for 30 days continuous or 60 days cumulative service on the land or in the air spaces of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslavia (including Kosovo), Albania, and the Former Republic of Macedonia, between 1 January 2003 and ending on 29 March 2010 for service under operation BRONZE.\n\nService under operation KOBOLD qualifies for this medal from Aug 2008 to the present.\n\nAircrew will accumulate one day’s service for the first sortie flown of any day in the Area of Operation; additional sorties flown on the same day receive no further credit. This requirement exists for support as well as combat aircraft, support aircraft including tanker, airlift and surveillance platforms.\n\nThis medal replaces the NATO medals for the Former-Yugoslavia, Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe Medal is circular in form and made of bronze, and bearing: on the obverse, the NATO star set in a wreath of olive leaves; and on the reverse, the title \"North Atlantic Treaty Organization\" and the words \"In the service of peace and freedom\" in English and French.

Medals issued until 31 December 2010 had a bar inscribed \"NON ARTICLE 5\" while those issued from 1 January 2011 onwards have a bar inscribed \"BALKANS\".The bar is worn centered on the ribbon. Where the undress ribbon is worn, a miniature version of the \"BALKANS\" bar is centered on the ribbon. Op BOREAS was the CF contribution to this operation, approximately 70 CF members were awarded this bar every rotation.\n\nPOSTNOMINALS\n\nThe use of a post-nominal is not authorized for this medal.\n\nHISTORICAL NOTES\n\nWith the creation of this medal, NATO has abolished the practice of issuing tour numerals to recognize more than one tour with NATO forces. The “NON ARTICLE FIVE” medal will be issued once to recognize all service in the Balkans, regardless of the number of tours a member serves.\n\nNATO no longer recognizes service in support areas such as Italy, Greece, Hungary and Austria as qualifying time towards the “NON ARTICLE FIVE” medal. A member must serve thirty days in the theatre of operations to qualify for the medal.\n\nhttp://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhr-ddhr/chc-tdh/index-eng.asp\n\nCaptain Richard J.
