        "text": "On Monday we held the second Enfield at War Open Day at the archives. About 60 people attended during the day.\n\nWe were able to show the new interactive Kiosks in action. These show aspects of the Borough during both World Wars using photos (including some 3-D images of guns from the Royal Small Arms), memories and videos.\n\nOne of the very large bomb maps for Enfield was displayed across several tables just outside the archive. We have three of these maps which record where the bombs fell in the Second World War. Joe Robinson gave a talk using the map as illustration about the bombings, especially the V1s and V2s which he has researched extensively. His findings can be seen on his website http://terrorfromthesky.com/ which is well worth a look for anyone interested in the flying bombs that landed in Enfield.\n\nAlso on display were ARP reports and lists of Civilian dead in WW2.\n\nWe put out copies of newspapers from both First and Second World Wars.\n\nThere were lots of ephemera from autograph books, ration books, cartoons and magazines. The archiveâ€™s collection of wartime photos was available for visitors to browse through. Some visitors brought in their own memorabilia to share with us.\n\nStaff were on hand to explain the exhibits and to help visitors with questions about their family history. Several useful contacts were made for future oral history projects.\n\nIn all the day was a great success.\n\n.\n\nThe general election of 1945 was the first since 1935. It was held on 5th July 1945 but the results werenâ€™t declared until 26th July to allow time for the overseas forcesâ€™ votes to be counted. The popularity of Winston Churchill was so great (he had an 83% approval rating) that it was expected to be a landslide victory for the Conservative Party.\n\nHowever voters were suspicious of the Conservative pre-war record, domestic and foreign. They were largely blamed for the policy of appeasement which had allowed Hitler to grow in power unchecked. Many remembered the return of soldiers after The Great War when they had been promised â€˜Homes fit for heroesâ€™ which had failed to materialise and the mass unemployment of 1930s.\n\nThe Labour Party under Clement Atlee were seen as supporters of The Beveridge Report which advocated a â€˜cradle to graveâ€™ welfare state and which had proved hugely popular with the public when it was published in 1942.\n\nThe policies of the Conservative Party which prioritised security were out of step with the public whose top priority was housing. With the end of the war Labour were seen as the party best able to rebuild the country. There was a degree of scare mongering form the Conservatives at the consequences of a Labour victory. Mr Bartle Bull claimed that a Socialist victory would mean throwing away everything they had fought so hard for. At a meeting in Oakwood School a man objected to the candidacy of Beverley Baxter on the grounds he was Canadian. Alderman Pinching said that this was a good thing as Mr Baxter could represent the views of the Empire. â€˜If we donâ€™t think in terms of Empire it is God help Old Englandâ€™, he declared. Labour candidate Ernest Davies said that the main issues of the election were resettlement and reconstruction. The Labour party were accused of disloyalty in forcing an election before the war with Japan was won.\n\nAt a meeting in Hazelwood Lane Captain Malandine, the Liberal candidate was asked about sending refugees back to their own countries:\n\nThe main issue was housing. At a meeting at Southbury Road School Mr Bartle Bull was questioned by an ex- sergeant major who had lost a leg during the war. When he had first been demobbed he had been unable to find work. When he did he lost money having to go before medical boards. he had to attend 15 and was allowed only 9/- for the loss of a days work. His rent had increased from 15/- before the war to 32/6. There were some strange questions for the candidates:\n\nThere were three candidates in each of the local constituencies as follows:\n\nEdmonton\n\nEvan Durbin (Labour) *\n\nSquadron Leader Geoffrey Sparrow (Conservative)\n\nJA Ward (Independent)\n\nEnfield:\n\nBartle Brennan Bull (Conservative)\n\nJohn Danny (Liberal)\n\nErnest Davies (Labour) *\n\nSouthgate (then part of Wood Green constituency):\n\nBeverley Baxter (Conservative)*\n\nCaptain Edwin T Malandine (Liberal)\n\nCouncillor WA Vant (Socialist)\n\n*elected\n\nThere was a suggestion that the war hero Charles Coward would stand as a candidate in Edmonton but nothing came of this.\n\nThe result of the election was a victory for Labour. Labour won in both Edmonton and Enfield. Local people also won seats in other areas. Percy Daines of Chase Green Avenue won for Labour in East Ham North.\n\nMrs Mabel Ridealgh, a prominent member of the Enfield Highway Co-operative Society won for Co-op and Labour in Ilford North. The results were first reported in the late news section of the paper.\n\nOne of the archiveâ€™s volunteers recently found an autograph book and a receipt book belonging to an Irene V Bridgeman in the collection. Both were from the time of the Second World War. The receipt book is handwritten with small newspaper articles of household hints stuck in. The autograph book has messages and pictures, some beautifully drawn.\n\nWe donâ€™t know very much about Irene Bridgeman. She was born in 1927 in Wandsworth. She has put her address in the front of the autograph book as Firs Lane. Her parents seem to have lived in Firs Lane from the 1930s to at least 1964. Her parents were Frederick J Bridgman and Mabel Hurd who married in Longport, Somerset in 1913. Frederick died in 1965 aged 84 and Mabel in 1984 aged 78. Irene never married as far as we can discover and died in Cheltenham in 2002.\n\nOne of the drawings is signed by an Eileen Fifield and under her name she has put PGHS (possibly Palmers Green High School) so maybe the names belong to school friends. One is signed M Bridgeman which could be her mother, Mabel.\n\nA couple of the pictures show women in the fashions of the 1940s.\n\nThere is a cartoon of soldiers and one picture with a quote from Winston Churchill.\n\nIf anyone knew Irene Bridgeman or recognises any of the other names in the autographs we would love to hear from you.\n\nTowards the end of the Second World War more and more reports appeared in the local newspapers about local men (I havenâ€™t found any women yet) being awarded medals for acts of bravery. This is a very random selection taken from the Tottenham and Edmonton Weekly Herald and the Enfield Gazette.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Albert George Willers from Upper Edmonton was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). One of the actions he was cited for was in August 1944 when he attacked a train near Abbeville and his plane was damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Despite this he managed to fly his aircraft home with great skill and executed a masterly landing.\n\nColour Sergeant Major SA Brown, Royal Engineers was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) for devotion to duty whilst serving in Madagascar. The son of Mrs Dearing of Harman Road, Enfield he was a civil servant before the war and volunteered at the outbreak of hostilities.\n\nWing Commander Adrian Warburton, DSO and Bar, DFC and two Bars was the most decorated reconnaissance flyer in the RAF. He was reported missing presumed killed in April 1944. He was the only son of Commander Geoffrey Warburton and Mrs M Warburton of Park Avenue, Enfield.\n\nPilot Officer RG Morgan of Colne Road, Winchmore Hill was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM). He was a former member of the Edmonton Air training Corps. He was an air gunner in a Halifax bomber.\n\nLieutenant Cyril Henry Bottell of Enfield was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for services in North West Europe. The citation was for an attack on a German Command post in Antwerp. Lieutenant Bottell led his men with great courage, leaping across a two foot wide parapet hurling grenades before him to gain entry. He was severely wounded in the stomach but continued to lead his platoon and then covered the withdrawal being the last but one person to leave the building.\n\nCaptain Ronald RD Wigley son of the late Mr TR Wigley and Mrs Wigley of Park Crescent, Enfield was awarded the Military Cross. He joined the army in 1940 and served from Alamein to Sicily. He was educated at Enfield Grammar School.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Beadman, eldest son of Mr and Mrs H Beadman, partner in the firm of Henry Beadman and Son, Baker Street, Enfield was awarded a bar to his DFC for conspicuous gallantry while leading two squadrons of Mosquitos in a daylight raid on Germany. He was an experienced flyer before the war and joined the RAF at the outbreak of hostilities. He was one of five brothers who all served in the forces. A younger brother Sergeant Pilot EAB Beadman was killed in action in June 1941.\n\nSergeant Tommy Rose of Lea Road, Enfield, son of Mr FS Rose of Bridgenhall, Russell Road was awarded the Military Medal for his service with General Montgomery. He was educated at Lavender Road School.\n\nBombardier JC Pines of Enfield was awarded the British Empire Medal in recognition of his two and a half yearsâ€™ service on the Dover cross-Channel guns. The Dover guns played an important part in the attacks on Calais and Boulogne. He attended Chesterfield Road School. Before the war he was a commercial artist.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Dennis Hewitt Pruden from Winchmore Hill was awarded the DFC. The citation records that this officer has set a fine example of courage and devotion to duty.\n\nSapper Frank Robert Wheeler of Enfield was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for services on the Italian Front. He was commended for operating his â€˜dozerâ€™ in order to repair a vital road while being shelled.\n\nFlying Officer Tony Whitehead of Monastery Gardens, Enfield was awarded the DFC. He was educated at St Ignatius College and was an active member of the Riverside Football Club with his brother Lieutenant Bernard Whitehead who served with the Chindits under General Wingate. A younger brother, Cyril was at Dunkirk and then served in Germany.\n\nCaptain Arthur Desmond Andrews of Enfield was awarded the MC for services in North West Europe. His coolness and devotion to duty undoubtedly saved the infantry from heavy losses and enabled them to fight their way through the cordon of enemy that surrounded them.\n\nThese are just a few of the local men who were awarded medals during the Second World War.\n\nConscription for women was introduced in December 1941. All unmarried women aged between 19 and 30 (later extended to 43) were required to register for war work. Women could join the services: The Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS), the Womenâ€™s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) or the Womenâ€™s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). Although women could not serve in combat roles joining the services meant that women could learn a trade such as mechanics which would never have been open to them in peacetime. Women flew planes and staffed anti-aircraft guns amongst other tasks. Winston Churchillâ€™s daughter Mary served in the 469 Heavy (Mixed) Anti-Aircraft Battery at Chase Side, Enfield.\n\nThe ban on married women working as teachers and nurses was lifted as they were essential to replace the number of men who had gone into the armed forces.\n\nThey could also work in industry or farming. By December 1943 one in three factory workers were women making munitions, planes, ships and other items essential to the war effort.\n\nIn Enfield women took over many postal deliveries. They helped run the British Restaurants and information centres. Women worked in increasing numbers in all the local factories, such as the Royal Small Arms, Ripaults, Belling, The Metal Box and many others.\n\nWomen also volunteered as fire watchers and joined the Womenâ€™s Voluntary Service (WVS) which helped with billeting evacuated children, providing food and clothing for bombed out families and providing emergency rest centres.\n\nThe Womenâ€™s Land Army was set up in June 1939. At its peak in 1943 there were over 80,000 Land Girls. Land Girls were employed at Forty Hall, Oakwood Park (see below)and other farms in the area.\n\nAs part of the Enfield at War Project we have been producing war walks for Edmonton, Enfield and Southgate. The Enfield Town First World War Heritage Trail is already available and now the next one has just come back from the printer. The Palmers Green to New Southgate WWII Heritage Trail is an easy walk that takes between 1Â½ and 2Â½ hours. It starts at Princes Avenue the site of the highest number of deaths in a single incident in World War Two and takes you through Palmers Green to Broomfield Park, Waterfall Road, Arnos Park, Bowes road ending up at the Grove Road Open Space in New Southgate. The leaflets are available from Enfield Local Studies Library & Archive, First Floor Thomas Hardy House, 39 London Road, EN2 6DS and will be distributed to all Enfield libraries. The map can also be downloaded from the Enfield Council website: http://www.enfield.gov.uk/info/1062/local_studies/3813/second_world_war_palmers_green_heritage_walk . WWII walks for Enfield and Edmonton will be available soon.\n\nAlso on the Enfield at War website are articles from local newspapers published during the First World War: http://www.enfield.gov.uk/info/200046/libraries/3165/historic_newspaper_reports_from_world_war_one_1914_-_1918 . They are a mixture of the serious and the silly reflecting the attitudes and opinions of people at the time.\n\nAt the time of the Munich Crisis when war seemed inevitable a programme of trench building began throughout the borough. From 1939, as part of the Civil Defence preparations, the local authorities of Edmonton, Enfield and Southgate began roofing over the trenches and building many structures for wartime use.There were trenches on the Library Green in Enfield and in Pymmes Park in Edmonton. There were Auxiliary Fire Service Stations at Pymmes House and Broomfield House.\n\nThere was a gun emplacement on fields north of Slades Hill and a searchlight in Pymmes Park. Although some Wardensâ€™ Posts and First Aid Centres were housed in existing buildings such as Broomfield House and under the Methodist Church in Enfield Town many were purpose built. Tank traps were built on railways.\n\nAir Raid shelters were built across the three authorities including a shelter at Weir Hall which still survives. The entrance is now covered by bushes and inaccessible to the public.\n\nThe majority of these structures were demolished at the end of the war.\n\nSome survived for many years after. Some still exist.\n\nWe want to try and identify any that are left. If you know of the remains of a public air raid shelter, wardensâ€™ post, pill box or any other Second World War structure please let us know.\n\nPhone: 0208 379 2724\n\nEmail: local.history@enfield.gov.uk\n\nOr in person at Local Studies Archive and Library, First Floor, Thomas Hardy House, 39 London Road, EN2 6DS. We are open 9.30 to 5pm Monday to Friday.\n\nRationing was introduced in 1940 and continued until 1954 on some items. Petrol, food and clothing were all rationed. The aim was to try and make the UK more self-sufficient. People were urged to â€˜Dig for Victoryâ€™ and â€˜Make Do and Mendâ€™ to reduce the dependence on imports.\n\nFood rationing started in January 1940 for butter, bacon and sugar. From 1942 this was extended to tea, cooking fat, jam, honey, marmalade, cheese, ham, milk, meat sweets and chocolate. Many foods that werenâ€™t rationed were very scarce. This led to long queues whenever a rumour went round that scarce items were in stock somewhere\n\nClothes went on ration in 1941 and became more stringent in 1942. The basic ration would have allowed a man to buy an overcoat every seven years, a pair of trousers and a jacket every two years. This became more of a problem as the war went on especially for families with growing children.\n\nPetrol rationing was introduced three weeks after the declaration of war. Each car was allowed between 4 â€“ 6 gallons of standard petrol a month depending on whether they needed their car for work. Motoring for pleasure was frowned upon. Petrol rationing didnâ€™t end until 1950."
