        "text": "Health and safety changes at NZ ports\n\nOn 1 July 2024, Maritime NZ became the primary regulator for health and safety across New Zealand’s 13 major ports. Maritime NZ already regulated the Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA) on ships, and ship to shore operations. This has been extended to include the landside of port operations at the 13 major ports in New Zealand.\n\nMaritime NZ’s goal is to support the many businesses on ports that carry out high-risk activities to improve safety culture, embed new health and safety practices, and ultimately help reduce harm to the people employed at ports.\n\nThis will impact all logging truck deliveries and ship loading/unloading.\n\nWhat this means for the port sector?\n\nNotify incidents online at: maritimenz.govt.nz – Report any event, incident or situation to us as soon as possible.\n\nIn life-threatening situations that require immediate emergency services, dial 111 or radio MAYDAY.\n\nAfter-hours serious incidents: Dial 0508 22 55 22 from 4:30pm to 9am, on weekends and public holidays to report loss of life, serious injury, significant damage to a vessel or port, serious pollution, or the potential for such events.\n\nWorkSafe continues to regulate major hazard facilities, New Zealand’s inland ports, manage HSWA authorisations and exemptions, and enforce specific laws like the Electricity and Gas acts (1992).\n\nView maps of the regulated areas – Maps have been developed for ports to clearly show the areas covered by Maritime NZ.\n\nDedicated Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA) team specialists are based in five locations, and work alongside Maritime Officers, Maritime Inspectors and Investigations teams.\n\nNew guidance and policies for ports are available on the website, including information on Worker Engagement, Participation and Representation (WEPR). More details will be released in the coming months, so you know what to expect, including about New Zealand’s first approved code of practice for stevedoring, which has now been approved by Ministers.\n\nClick here to find about more about the Safer Ports Programme.\n\nSource and image credit: Maritime NZ\n\nLessons from Gabrielle: Building greater forest resilience\n\nFollowing the devastation caused by Cyclone Gabrielle, Pan Pac Forest Products in Hawke’s Bay is building more resilience into its forestry operations, with larger culverts and new single span bridges to withstand future severe weather events.\n\nThe company lost around 3% of its forest estate as well as roads and surrounding infrastructure in the cyclone that hit the North Island’s east coast in February 2023. The damage to the forestry side of Pan Pac’s business cost around $40 million.\n\nOne of the key learnings from the disaster was the awesome power of water, says Damon Wise, Forests Manager – Operations. “Pre-cyclone, our infrastructure was designed to cope with normal winter storms, not catastrophic events,” says Wise.\n\n“No one really appreciated the damage big volumes of water could do. Water dissolves roads, floats concrete blocks and woody debris and acts in direct competition with the blocked culverts and multispan bridges. While the power of Gabrielle meant in some cases damage was unavoidable, we are now designing our infrastructure to cope with much more severe weather events than normal.\n\n“We need to allow more space for water to flow through. At some point, culverts will block, so you have to think about where the water goes and what damage it could do downstream. Water cascading over the road will quickly eat it away. You only need to have one or two culverts in a row block up to lose a section of road. As well as investing in better infrastructure, you also need to be regularly checking it. Preventative maintenance is the key to minimising damage associated with bad weather.”\n\nPan Pac’s Forests Operations team has added more culverts in certain soil types and high rainfall areas.\n\n“We know through experience what each catchment can now produce in terms of water and debris. There’s no point investing heavily in roading infrastructure just to lose it all because the culvert pipe was too small.”\n\nCulvert installations lost to the cyclone that were traditionally designed for a 5% AEP (Annual Exceedance Probability) storm event are being replaced with a larger pipes that will cope with a 2% AEP storm event. This equates to a 20% – 25% increase in pipe size. A 5% AEP storm event has a 5% chance of occurring in any given year and is likely to occur once every 20 years. The lower the percentage, the more intense the rain and associated flood event.\n\nTherefore, a 2% AEP event is equivalent to a 1 in 50-year storm event. Between March 2023 and June 2024, Wise says Pan Pac has built or replaced 247 culverts and restored access to over 200 roads. In some cases, single span bridges have replaced large culverts to allow more area for water to flow.\n\n“You might say we’re overengineering, but we understand the ramifications of not being prepared.”\n\nIn other cases where the cost of building a bridge would be prohibitive, the team has installed box culverts with concrete armoured decks that will withstand overtopping in high flows.\n\n“Catastrophic weather events are quickly becoming the new normal and often involve large volumes of water,” says Wise. “We’ve learnt water will always find a way and when contained has little regard for infrastructure as it travels. Providing a route with as few restrictions as possible minimises damage and mitigates disruption.”\n\nSource and image credit: Pan Pac Forest Products\n\nHow Lidar’s changed workflows in the forest industry\n\nSince the invention of lidar in the 1960s, its usage has continued to expand, with the last couple of decades in particular marking significant upticks in use cases. Today, it is still most associated with the automotive and surveying industries, with most manufacturers in the former category using the technology as part of its autonomous driving toolkit. Surveying, of course, was among the early adopters of the technology, using its capabilities to calculate terrain elevation more precisely and efficiently than they’d ever been able to previously.\n\nAs laser scanning technologies of all kinds, be it terrestrial, airborne, UAV, or mobile, become more democratized, new industries are able to test these tools and determine the value they can provide in these new sectors. Over the last decade or so, the forestry industry has become a prime example of this phenomenon, starting a new subsection of the industry often referred to as “digital forestry.”\n\nBig news came down in this digital forestry space last month, specifically in North America, with the announcement that Barr GeoSpatial Solutions (BGS) had acquired Forsite Consultants. In their release of the news, BGS says that Forsite being part of their group will provide them “the resources and market access to allow the expansion of our technology product offerings across North America and around the world.”\n\nRecently, Geo Week News spoke with Cam Brown, manager of resource management and technology with Forsite, and Mark Corrao, Chief Innovation Officer with Northwest Management, Inc. (also part of BGS), about the digital forestry space and what lidar has added to the overall industry.\n\nAlthough Brown’s work is generally in Canada – though Forsite does work on projects in the United States as well – while Corrao’s is generally in the U.S., they unsurprisingly each work on similar types of projects and have similar tales of how lidar started to take hold of the industry. Corrao tells Geo Week News about key products used by his team, including ForestView – the complete package of software tools offered by Northwest Management that “takes a Lidar scan, field work, publicly available data, client historic data and produces valuable decision-support tools for multiple industries that work with natural landscapes.”\n\nMore broadly, what each of these industry veterans relay is a similar process as to how lidar has taken hold in other industries, including traditional ones like surveying. Essentially, they are using remote sensing to more efficiently and effectively complete projects that would have taken many man-hours and, as a result, much higher costs. Mostly using crewed aircraft, they are flying over relevant portions of forests and using lidar to collect point clouds for individual trees – as well as the terrain underneath them. From there, they are able to utilize machine learning capabilities developed by Forsite to predict the types of trees and other relevant attributes.\n\n“You have a known height [measured from the point cloud], you predict the species, and based on the height and a bunch of metrics and the species, you predict the diameter of the tree at the base,” Brown explained to Geo Week News about this process. “From there, we use allometric equations to calculate everything else we need about that tree. You’ll need to predict species and diameter, and everything else flows after that, and you have an inventory of every single tree in your forest. We’re doing this across millions and millions of hectares.”\n\nCorrao, believes this “Digital Inventory” – which he defines as “the act of taking this new technology that have increased resolution, robust field verification, and move the industry away from sampling grids that impute/extrapolate limited information to the “blank spaces” they don’t have any information on” – is only the beginning.\n\n“It is the proverbial doorway to quantifying change, risk, value, and patterns/conditions at an accuracy and resolution we have never before been able to do without enormous time and cost expense. It’s like purchasing a Volkswagen bug and being delivered a Ferrari, a garage to put it in, and fuel for life.”\n\nMore >>\n\nSource: geoweeknews\n\nVictory for council over Gisborne forestry companies\n\nSweeping new controls on a forestry block responsible for slash and debris that washed off Gisborne hills during Cyclone Gabrielle are to be enforced, in a ruling an environment group hails as “a clear message” to the industry.\n\nGisborne District Council, in a bid to prevent further damage to the region’s landscape and swathes of woody debris covering its coastline, went to the Environment Court seeking an enforcement order requiring China Forestry Group New Zealand Company Ltd. (CFGNZC) to cease discharging forestry debris and sediment and to deal with about 16,000 cubic metres of woody debris from the company’s Kanuka forest block in the Waimata valley.\n\nIn a decision released last week, the Court has granted enforcement orders sought by the council. The orders require debris removed from the forest under a remedial plan by October 15. It requires the installation of water controls at all skids/landings and on all tracks and roads to “eliminate or minimise the risk of erosion, skid site collapse, track collapse or road collapse”.\n\nMore >>\n\nSource: Stuff\n\nImage credit: China Forestry Group\n\nHighest-performance vehicle to take off from a runway\n\nDawn Aerospace has announced the completion of another flight test campaign of their Mk-II rocket-powered aircraft The campaign (dubbed Campaign 2-2) saw three flights completed in late July. In flight three, they achieved a maximum speed and altitude of Mach 0.92 (967 km/h) and 50,000ft (15.1km). That is 3x and 5x of what they had achieved in the previous campaign – a massive jump in demonstrated performance.\n\nThey are now poised to fly supersonic in Campaign 2-3, scheduled for September. But that is just the beginning. In many respects, the Mk-II is slated to be the highest-performance vehicle to take off from a runway.\n\nBy the end of 2025, they’re looking to\n\nClimb faster than an F15,\n\nFly higher than a Mig 25,\n\nFaster than an SR-71, and,\n\nUltimately, be the first vehicle to fly above the Karman line; 100km altitude (the generally accepted definition of “space”), twice in a single day.\n\nSome of these records have stood for over 50 years.\n\nThey have spent about US$10 million on the program to date, and plan to complete it for under $20 million total. So why do they think they will be able to achieve such high performance, with such modest investment? And how are they able to progress through flight testing so quickly compared to other rocket development programs?\n\nIn short, they realized they were building aircraft with the performance of a rocket, not a rocket with wings.\n\nMore >>\n\nCheck out this amazing footage from Dawn Aerospace’s test flight in late July (with their aircraft climbing to 50,000 feet, taking off from Glentanner aerodrome near Mt Cook, NZ) and Kiwi ingenuity in making all this happen.\n\nOjiFS Proposes Penrose Mill Closure\n\n75 workers at OJI Fibre Solution’s Penrose Pulp Mill in Auckland learnt this morning that the mill is likely to close by mid-December. They were provided information at a meeting of all staff called by the company at 8.00 am this morning. Union representatives are calling on the Government to urgently step in and save the mill by reducing wholesale energy costs in any way possible.\n\n“This has come like a bolt out of the blue for workers and was completely unexpected,” said Justin Wallace, organiser for FIRST Union, which represents production workers on site.\n\nJoe Gallagher, E tū industry organiser, said workers have been repeatedly told by the company over the years that the Penrose mill, which turns recycled paper and card into pulp, was the most efficient site OJI had in the country. “They are gutted that the company has now told them that, pending consultation, the site will close,” said Mr Gallagher. “We understand wholesale energy costs are way too high but this can’t be the end of the story for Penrose, and there has to be a way to save these jobs and the recycling capacity of the mill.”\n\nClick here for full article\n\nSource: Scoop\n\nImage credit: Oji Fibre Solutions\n\nLifeline needed for Winstone Pulp Mill\n\nRuapehu Mayor Weston Kirton has emphasised the urgent need to support the Winstone Pulp Mill near Ohakune, the largest employer in the Ruapehu District, amidst soaring electricity costs. The Mill’s potential closure due to the high cost of electricity has sent shockwaves through the community and could have severe local and national repercussions.\n\n“The Winstone Pulp Mill is crucial to the central North Island economy and New Zealand’s overall economic health,” said Mayor Kirton. “The high cost of electricity, which has surged by 600% over the past couple of years, is jeopardizing its operations. In September 2021, a Megawatt hour cost $100; it now stands at $700. Despite significant investments in new equipment and a 30% reduction in electricity use to boost productivity, Winstone is ‘up against the wall.'”\n\nThe potential closure of the Mill would be a devastating blow, not only to the local and regional economy but also to New Zealand’s already limited value-added manufacturing base. “In a country where most of our electricity is produced from renewable resources, mainly rain, this situation is unacceptable and highlights systemic and policy failures,” added Mayor Kirton.\n\nMayor Kirton expressed his approval of Finance Minister Hon. Nicola Willis’s actions in seeking urgent advice from Treasury on possible interventions for spiking electricity costs. He also supports Regional Development Minister Hon. Shane Jones’s call for a substantive inquiry into electricity pricing to push down prices. “As Minister Jones pointed out, New Zealand has recently experienced the highest electricity costs in the western world, and we cannot allow our businesses to be destroyed by this.”\n\nMayor Kirton calls on the government to act with urgency to ensure the Mill remains operational. “The importance of the Winstone Pulp Mill to the central North Island economy is comparable to the Tiwai Aluminum smelter’s significance to Southland, which also faced closure due to long-term energy costs. With the government focused on growth and employment, a major export-earning employer should not be allowed to fail due to internal policy settings.”\n\nSource & image credit: Ruapehu District Council\n\nHave your say on NZ’s legal harvest assurance system\n\nThe Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) is seeking further feedback on designing New Zealand’s legal harvest assurance system framework. In this second issues paper, MPI is looking to continue conversations about the operational details required to implement the system.\n\nLegal harvest assurance systems are aimed at combating trade of illegally logged timber. It is estimated that illegal logging accounts for up to 30% of global timber trade and contributes to more than 50% of tropical deforestation in Central Africa, the Amazon Basin, and South-East Asia.\n\nNew Zealand’s statutory legal harvest assurance system will cover people harvesting forests, people buying logs, primary or first-stage processors, and importers and exporters of timber products. It follows the enactment of the Forests (Legal Harvest Assurance) Amendment Act 2023 in May 2023, which will introduce a legal harvest assurance system into law through the Forests Act 1949.\n\nIn preparation for formal consultation, MPI is using issues papers to seek feedback on the operational details required to implement the system. MPI wants to gather a broad base of views on ideas and assumptions that have been made in designing the details of how a legal harvest assurance system will work in practice. The information gathered will be used to inform options for consultation on regulations to implement the system.\n\nFeedback on New Zealand’s Legal Harvest Assurance System, Issues paper two: implementing the legal harvest assurance framework must be received by MPI no later than 5:00pm on 28 August 2024. The second issues paper is available here: Legal harvest assurance system for timber | NZ Government (mpi.govt.nz)\n\nMore information is available on the MPI website.\n\nSource: The Ministry for Primary Industries\n\nKey carbon forestry issues to be discussed this month\n\nThe programme for the upcoming Carbon Forestry 2024 event in Rotorua, New Zealand, has been released. The event continues to grow due to the importance of forestry in New Zealand’s response to climate change.\n\nWithin the programme, the panel session is one of the highlights of the annual investor event. Carbon investors are in the market for the long haul, so they seek certainty for their investments. Here’s what the players and analysts are saying:\n\nCarbon Match: “The Government has until the end of September to respond whether it thinks that the Commission recommendations should become regulations, or to come up with an alternative set of settings. And whilst we let the ETS do the heavy lifting, work is being done on the second Emissions Reductions Plan, the detail of which might yet improve market sentiment over the back end of the year – let’s see.”\n\nClimate Forestry Association: “At Fieldays in June, both Forestry Minister Todd McClay and Climate Change Minister Simon Watts restated the Government’s commitment to climate action and recognised that a strong and stable ETS is our most effective tool for achieving our climate targets,” says Andrew Cushen, adding, “It is widely recognised that the market is currently significantly undervalued. Consistent policy settings and a long-term commitment to stability – like that signalled by the Government – are needed to bring back confidence in the sector and certainty in the market.”\n\nMr Cushen said despite the Government’s signals, it could reinforce the recent assurances by clearing up some areas that have created confusion in the market, saying “The suggestion of a lowering price floor in the latest Ministry for the Environment consultation as presented without any obvious rationale, was not at all helpful for the market and the broader sector,”\n\nLooking to other key matters in relation to NZUs, the government accounts benefit from NZU sales. They rank second (alongside ACC levies) behind the tax take. In 2022 the ETS generated almost $2 billion for the Government. But right now the secondary market price is lower than auction pricing. A number of scenarios are still to play out between now and September’s auction.\n\nCarbon Forestry 2024 runs on 20-21 August 2024 in Rotorua, New Zealand. Attendees are encouraged to book early, as the 2022 and 2023 events sold out, and early bird ends Friday 26 July.\n\nFor more details, visit the event website.\n\nSource: Innovatek\n\nNew Forests & Timberlink partner in ‘Wood for Good’ video\n\nNew Forests and Timberlink joined forces to showcase the entire lifecycle of sustainable forestry, from seedling to sawmill, and the creation of eco-friendly products like CLT and GLT. This partnership was featured on Channel 10’s ‘Planet Shapers’ program, which celebrates positive sustainability stories.\n\nA core message of the segment was the critical role of land use in combating climate change. Sarah Clawson, New Forests’ Global Head of Investor Relations, visited Mt Gambier in South Australia to explain the process, from nursery to mill, and emphasized timber and land’s vital part in mitigating climate change. She highlighted that the land use sector can contribute up to 30% of the solution.\n\n“As we shift towards a low-carbon future, wood will replace carbon-intensive materials like cement and steel in construction. It’s the ultimate renewable resource,” said Clawson.\n\nTimberlink’s Chief Sales & Marketing Officer, Simon Angove, and NeXTimber Brand Manager, Georgia Coutsodimitropoulos, also appeared in the video, discussing the mill’s innovative processes and the development of engineered wood products that capture and store carbon.\n\nSource: New Forests\n\nAI is making forklifts safer\n\nAfter a worker in the kiwifruit industry was traumatically injured, WorkSafe NZ has accepted a commitment from his employer to an enforceable undertaking centered around using Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nAI technology to sense pedestrians around forklifts is the centrepiece of a new safety commitment WorkSafe has accepted from a major player in the kiwifruit industry.\n\nThe commitment, known as an enforceable undertaking, was put forward by Trevelyan’s Pack and Cool Limited in Te Puke, where a worker was traumatically injured in April 2022. Trevelyan’s is New Zealand’s largest single-site kiwifruit and avocado packhouse.\n\nThe man was struck while walking behind a reversing forklift, and had his left leg and foot run over. When the driver moved the forklift forward, he ran over the victim’s foot a second time. Ultimately, the victim’s lower left leg could not be saved, and it was amputated below the knee.\n\nMore >>\n\nSource and image credit: Industrial Safety News\n\nThe future of paper-based packaging\n\nPackaging has evolved from mere product protection to a powerful branding tool. With growing environmental concerns, the industry is undergoing a transformative shift towards sustainable solutions. Paper packaging, once overlooked, is now at the forefront of this revolution. Its biodegradability, recyclability, and versatility make it a compelling alternative to environmentally harmful plastics.\n\nConsumer demand for eco-friendly products is surging, driving businesses to adopt sustainable packaging practices. Additionally, stringent regulations on plastic waste are accelerating the transition to paper-based alternatives. The paper packaging industry is responding with innovative solutions, developing stronger, more durable materials and exploring new design possibilities.\n\nFrom fast-moving consumer goods to luxury products, paper packaging is proving its adaptability. Its potential to be customised and printed upon offers brands unique opportunities for creative packaging designs that resonate with environmentally conscious consumers. As the world becomes increasingly aware of the plastic crisis, paper packaging is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping a more sustainable future.\n\nMore >>\n\nSource and image credit: Pulp and Paper Technology\n\nMass timber adoption increases within NZ construction\n\nA significant upsurge in mass timber awareness and application was highlighted by the Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ) in its survey of building and construction experts.\n\nWood Processors and Manufacturers Association Chief Executive, Mark Ross, says the finding is encouraging and signals an increased adoption of engineered timber products in New Zealand by builders, designers and architects. “The timber that we are talking about is not only renewable but has environmental advantages over steel and concrete when it comes to carbon storage and durability,” Ross says. “With New Zealand’s sustainable forestry model, using locally grown timber supports our circular bioeconomy, climate change targets, and domestic processing of logs.\n\nForecasting by Deloitte indicates that changing our market share to timber by 25% would result in the removal of an additional 920,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the environment each year. Greater use of timber is critical to rebuilding New Zealand’s economy, boosting our GDP, and providing regional jobs in a highly productive sector.\n\nThe BRANZ survey is carried out biennially. Data compared over a period of five years highlights noticeable growth in the role of mass timber use in New Zealand construction. This mirrors global trends, with the engineered wood products market projected to grow by 77% to $268 billion (NZD) by 2031. Changes in engineered timber use can be attributed to a heightened focus on carbon-neutral construction practices, the increasing demand for energy-efficient buildings, and consumer preference for natural materials.\n\nThe BRANZ survey is supported by Mid-Rise Construction midrisewood.co.nz/, a co-investment programme between MPI and Red Stag, which is stimulating the use of mass-timber engineered wood products in construction.\n\nTo download a copy of the BRANZ report, please click here.\n\nSource: Wood Processors and Manufacturers Association\n\nNZ Wood Processing Growth Fund – new applications close 26 August\n\nThe Wood Processing Growth Fund (WPGF) second capital investment round of the Accelerator programme is now open, and applications must be received by 26 August 2024.\n\nAccelerator provides loans or equity finance to co-fund capital investment in new capacity and improvements that increase onshore wood processing capacity, productivity and improve competitiveness.\n\nThis second investment round continues to focus on projects that are investment ready. Investors who are advanced in planning a new wood processing development, or an expansion or upgrade to existing sawmills, engineered wood, panels, or roundwood production should consider applying.\n\nThe WPGF also provides grants for pre-investment activities such as business cases, feasibility studies and technical assistance through the WPGF Catalyst programme.\n\nSome details on those two funding streams are as follows:\n\nAccelerator – up to NZ$33M in debt or equity investment in capital projects aimed at expanding wood processing.\n\nCatalyst fund – provides up to NZ$2 million per year in conditional grants to support feasibility studies and related pre-capital activities for wood processing projects.\n\nThe WPGF is managed by Te Uru Rākau – New Zealand Forest Service in collaboration with Kānoa – Regional Economic Development & Investment Unit.\n\nClick here for information about how to apply.\n\nOutside of the WPGF, Te Uru Rākau – New Zealand Forest Service can help connect you with funding and support programmes across government.

COFO is FAO’s top forestry governing body, tasked with identifying emerging policy and technical issues, seeking solutions, and advising FAO on appropriate action. This year’s meeting is themed “Accelerating forest solutions through innovation.”\n\nThe State of the World’s Forests 2024 (SOFO 2024) report says there’s evidence to suggest that climate change is making forests more vulnerable to stressors such as wildfires and pests.\n\nWildfire intensity and frequency are increasing, including in areas not previously affected, with fires in 2023 releasing an estimated 6,687 megatonnes of carbon dioxide globally. Boreal fire was previously responsible for about 10 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. In 2021, such fires reached a new high, mainly driven by extended drought causing an increase in fire severity and fuel consumption, and accounted for nearly one-quarter of total wildfire emissions.\n\nClimate change also makes forests more vulnerable to invasive species, with insects, pests and disease pathogens threatening tree growth and survival. Pine wood nematode has already caused significant damage to native pine forests in some countries in Asia, and areas of North America are projected to experience devastating damage due to insects and disease by 2027.\n\nGlobal wood production, meanwhile, remains at record levels. After a brief dip during the COVID-19 pandemic, production is back at about 4 billion cubic meters yearly.\n\nMore >>\n\nSource and image credit: FAO\n\nScientists discover entirely new wood type\n\nResearchers have identified an entirely new type of wood that does not fit into either category of hardwood or softwood.\n\nScientists from the Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University and Jagiellonian University, Poland, made the discovery while undertaking an evolutionary survey of the microscopic structure of wood from some of the world’s most iconic trees and shrubs.\n\nThey found that Tulip Trees, which are related to magnolias and can grow over 100 feet tall, have a unique type of wood. This discovery may explain why the trees, which diverged from magnolias when earth’s atmospheric CO2 concentrations were relatively low, grow so tall and so fast. This opens new opportunities to improve carbon capture and storage in plantation forests by planting a fast-growing tree more commonly seen in ornamental gardens, or breeding Tulip Tree-like wood into other tree species.\n\nThe discovery was part of an evolutionary survey of the microscopic structure of wood from 33 tree species from the Cambridge University Botanic Garden’s Living Collections. The survey explored how wood ultrastructure evolved across softwoods (gymnosperms such as pines and conifers) and hardwoods (angiosperms including oak, ash, birch, and eucalypts).\n\nThe wood samples were collected from trees in the Botanic Garden in coordination with its Collections Coordinator. Fresh samples of wood, deposited in the previous spring growing season, were collected from a selection of trees to reflect the evolutionary history of gymnosperm and angiosperm populations as they diverged and evolved.\n\nUsing the Sainsbury Laboratory’s low temperature scanning electron microscope (cryo-SEM), the team imaged and measured the size of the nanoscale architecture of secondary cell walls (wood) in their native hydrated state.\n\nMicroscopy Core Facility Manager at the Sainsbury Laboratory, Dr Raymond Wightman, said: “We analysed some of the world’s most iconic trees like the Coast Redwood, Wollemi Pine and so-called “living fossils” such as Amborella trichopoda, which is the sole surviving species of a family of plants that was the earliest still existing group to evolve separately from all other flowering plants.\n\n“Our survey data has given us new insights into the evolutionary relationships between wood nanostructure and the cell wall composition, which differs across the lineages of angiosperm and gymnosperm plants. Angiosperm cell walls possess characteristic narrower elementary units, called macrofibrils, compared to gymnosperms.”\n\nMore >>\n\nSource & image credit: University of Cambridge\n\nTimber industry: Addressing housing for the future\n\nForest & Wood Products Australia (FWPA) has released a new report, “Housing for the Future and the Contribution of the Timber Industry”, as part of its Statistics and Economics Program and recent webinar series to increase understanding of the timber industry’s market potential.\n\nFWPA is dedicated to providing the forest and wood products industry with insightful and timely analysis; hence the webinar series and summary report feature contributions from leading experts in the fields of economics, demography, and urban planning, highlighting the collaborative efforts needed to address the ongoing housing challenges in Australia. The report is designed as an overview and discussion starting point for the challenges and opportunities of housing through the lens of the forest and timber industry and its diverse stakeholders.\n\nHousing affordability worsened in 2023 when interest rates rose, on average, by 125 basis points. This rise affected many Australians, including mortgage holders, first-home buyers, renters, and builders. Now, as housing demand continues to rise amid a supply shortage, this new report and associated webinar series outline key discussion points around how the timber industry can play a pivotal role in supporting the government targets for new housing construction.\n\nThe National Housing Accord aims to build 1.2 million homes over the next five years, and the forest and wood products industry is well-positioned to contribute through innovative construction methods and sustainable practices.\n\n“The timber industry is known for its association with housing construction. Recent data on ABS building activities and FWPA timber sales volume showed that there was a linear relationship between dwelling approval and sales of timber products.” said FWPA Statistics and Economics Program Manager, Erick Hansnata.\n\nThe FWPA webinar series and summary report dive into housing issues from the perspectives of the property market, demography, the timber industry, and relevant associations.\n\n“The forest and wood products industry has the capacity to help meet targets through innovation and improved approaches to constructing detached houses, units, and low and mid-rise residences that all store carbon. Applying best practices of modern construction methods, as well as expanded use of sawn timber and engineered wood products are just some of the opportunities our sector can provide for sustainable residential projects.”\n\nFor more information and to access the full report, please click here.\n\nSource & image credit: FWPA\n\nThe incremental improvements in GNSS\n\nWhat is the current state of GNSS, from both a constellation, augmentation and receiver perspective? Spoiler alert: it is more of an evolution than a revolution!\n\nIt is almost impossible to imagine geoinformation without GNSS nowadays. Even most geodetic services have switched to GNSS to maintain the geodetic reference network rather than using traditional optical techniques. This article explores the state of the art of GNSS, from both a constellation, augmentation and receiver perspective. Spoiler alert: it is more of an evolution than a revolution!\n\nGlobal satellite navigation systems (GNSS) are everywhere. If you try to imagine geoinformation without GNSS, you will probably fail. Some people might say: ‘But what about my total station?’. But perhaps they are forgetting that most geodetic services have long since stopped surveying the control points using traditional, optical techniques and have switched to GNSS to maintain the geodetic reference network instead. So what is the current state of play when it comes to GNSS?\n\nClick here for full article\n\nSource & image credit: GIM International\n\nNew sails could cut fuel consumption of cargo ships by 90%\n\nWith their massive sails stretched over towering masts, merchant ships that plied the world’s oceans hundreds of years ago helped launch the era of commercial shipping, delivering goods of all kinds to different ports of call. Those early cargo ships would eventually give way to diesel-powered vessels. But along with the change in thrust came greenhouse gas emissions harmful to the planet.\n\nNow, a University of Miami College of Engineering researcher wants to help today’s massive and modern cargo ships go green—and his strategy is to employ an age-old method of propulsion: wind.\n\n“What’s old is new again,” said GeCheng Zha, a professor of aerospace engineering and director of the Aerodynamics and Computational Fluid Dynamics Lab. “With the technological advancements of today, wind-assisted propulsion is an efficient alternative to diesel engines. And the major advantage is that it’s environmentally friendly—an effective way to decarbonize the shipping industry that’s responsible for about 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.”\n\nZha is developing giant cylinders that would be mounted on the decks of cargo ships, generating thrust by sucking in, pressurizing, and ejecting air in a different direction. Several stories high, each cylinder could be lowered, allowing ships to pass beneath bridges and to navigate in and out of ports.\n\nOn some shipping routes, the cylinders could cut fuel consumption by as much as 50 percent, according to Zha, who is still in the design and simulation phase for his wind-propulsion instruments.\n\nHis research couldn’t be timelier. Last year, the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations specialized agency responsible for regulating maritime transport, announced a revised strategy that requires the international shipping industry to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions “by or around” 2050.\n\n“The shipping industry has had a tendency to resist change because diesel engines are so powerful,” Zha said. “But now, with pressure mounting, either willingly or unwillingly, it will have to change.”\n\nHis high-tech cylinders represent a growing movement in the shipping industry to develop and employ wind-assisted technologies to make cargo ships greener. From spinning rotors that use the so-called Magnus force to convert wind energy into propulsive force to nonrotating suction wings that use vents and internal fans to achieve propulsion, the technology to power cargo ships with an age-old concept is gaining steam.\n\nThe technology is already in use on some vessels. About 30 cargo ships out of a global fleet of roughly 60,000 are currently using wind propulsion, deploying rigid sails made of aluminum, fiberglass, and carbon fiber that operate under minimum power from a ship’s engines. That number is expected to increase to nearly 11,000 by the end of this decade, according to the London-based International Windship Association.\n\nZha’s nonrotating cylinders, developed with co-flow jet technology similar to what he employed for his ongoing research on new types of aircraft, would be “much more efficient” than wind-assisted propulsion units that are currently in use on the few cargo ships that have them, he said. “We would be capable of achieving greater thrust,” he explained.\n\nNow, the only challenge that remains for Zha is securing funding to develop a prototype. “We’ll get there,” he said. “With about 90 percent of the world’s trade traveling by ship, this technology is a ‘windfall’ of an idea.”\n\nSource: Miami University\n\nNZ’s first hydrogen truck hits 100,000km milestone\n\nNew Zealand’s first XCIENT hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric truck has clocked 100,000km – a special milestone celebrated by owner NZ Post. NZ Post chief executive officer David Walsh says it’s a significant event and one he’s proud of.\n\n“NZ Post was the first company in New Zealand to trial the hydrogen truck which aligns with our approach of testing and adopting new technologies. As the truck’s odometer ticked over to 100,000km it added another milestone in our sustainability journey and another step towards our goal of transitioning to net-zero emissions operations by 2050,” Walsh said.\n\nWalsh hoped NZ Post’s early adoption to trial and introduce zero emission technology to its fleet encouraged others to also do the same. It was the first truck of its kind to be put into commercial operation in New Zealand.\n\n“NZ Post’s transport fleet accounts for around 45% of our emissions so therefore NZ Post is focussed on opportunities to decarbonise our transport fleet,” NZ Post Group Sustainability Manager Dawn Baggaley says. The acquisition of our hydrogen truck was made possible with the support of Hyundai New Zealand, Baggaley said.\n\nGrant Doull, National Manager of Hydrogen and Eco Commercial Vehicles at Hyundai New Zealand says, “We are delighted that NZ Post saw the opportunity to invest in this zero-emission transport technology, showing their commitment to reducing emissions in the road freight sector. The 100,000km milestone demonstrates that hydrogen can be a reliable and efficient replacement to traditional diesel trucks with a longer range, shorter refuelling time, and a greater payload,” Doull said.\n\nIn April this year Kiwi company Hiringa Energy opened its hydrogen refuelling network in New Zealand – with an official ribbon cutting taking place at Wiri in South Auckland. The Wiri hydrogen station is one of three North Island sites now operating, with another 21 sites in development across the country.\n\n“Hiringa are delighted to see NZ Post reach 100,000km in their Hyundai XCIENT fuel cell truck, this is a perfect example of New Zealand companies working together to create real change and removing carbon emissions from the supply chain,” Hiringa CEO Andy Clennett says.\n\n“Hydrogen offers enormous advantages in terms of operational efficiency and productivity by allowing quick refuelling times and high productivity, a perfect match for the needs of NZ Post and their customers. We congratulate Hyundai New Zealand and NZ Post on the leadership they have shown to make this positive change a reality and look forward to many more KM’s travelling with zero emissions, this is just the beginning,” he said.\n\nHiringa’s green hydrogen refuelling network has stations operating in Wiri, TeRapa and Palmerston North, with a fourth station currently in construction in Tauranga (Tauriko).\n\nHiringa Network Launch\n\nThis project is a global showcase for the heavy transport sector and a great example of how green hydrogen is a practical solution that works in the real world. Since the official opening of Hiringa’s refuelling network in April this year the NZ Post truck has typically been filling twice a day, taking only 15 mins to fully fill, it has integrated seamlessly onto the refuelling network and has enabled NZ Post to deliver to schedule with zero emissions.\n\n“The timing of this milestone coincides nicely with the soon to be released $30m government funding program for hybrid or zero emission heavy vehicles,” Clennett said.\n\n“By being the first to run a FCEV truck in NZ, NZ Post have provided a real-world use case for fleet owners who might be looking to apply for grant funding under the scheme, allowing them to purchase their hydrogen fuel cell truck with confidence in its capability.”\n\nMore >>\n\nPhoto: From left; David Walsh CEO NZ Post, Catherine Clennett – Chair and Co-founder Hiringa Energy, Simon Parham – CEO Waitomo Fuels, Minister Simeon Brown, David Macleod – National MP for New Plymouth, Andrew Clennett – Hiringa CEO and Co-founder, Brendan King – Group General Manager TR Group\n\nSource: Scoop, NZ Post\n\nNew satellite tech will lead to fewer flight cancellations\n\nNew satellite technology that significantly improves GPS accuracy, has reached an important milestone, with two 11-metre satellite dishes switched on by Land Information Minister, Chris Penk. Known as the Southern Positioning Augmentation Network (SouthPAN), the project improves GPS accuracy from five to 10 metres, down to less than a metre – and in some cases to as little as 10cm.\n\n“New Zealanders use GPS services every single day for everything from ordering food, to navigating the city streets. GPS information is also used for critical technical applications like coordinating an emergency response and air traffic control,” Mr Penk says. “As the project develops, one of the most noticeable changes for the public will be less disruption to flights during bad weather, with a significant reduction in weather related flight cancellations and delays. SouthPAN services will aid flight navigation, making it safer for planes to land when visibility is poor.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago winter weather conditions caused widespread flight cancellations, underscoring the need for modern digital infrastructure to support the safe movement of people, as well as goods and services.\n\nImproved GPS accuracy has far-reaching benefits for almost every major sector, from agriculture, to aviation, forestry, and construction. An independent report estimated SouthPAN will contribute $864 million NZD to New Zealand’s economy over 20 years, through productivity enhancing and labour-saving applications, such as better resource management, more accurate maritime activities and real-time livestock monitoring through digital fencing tools. It is expected this figure could grow as new technologies and innovations are developed to harness SouthPAN’s possibilities.\n\nSouthPAN is a joint project between the governments of New Zealand and Australia. The Southland facility works in tandem with a newly built centre in Uralla, in New South Wales.\n\n“Partnering with Australia improves our resilience and means if one station is offline, there is a back-up station which is crucial for safety of life applications, such as aviation,” said Mr Penk.\n\nSome SouthPAN services are already free and available to consumers and deliver services that are 99.5% reliable. The remainder of the network will be established over the next three years.\n\nSource: Beehive\n\nImage credit: Lockhead Martin\n\nCSIRO and Google accelerating AI for science\n\nCSIRO, Australia’s national science agency, and Google Australia have today announced a multifaceted collaboration to accelerate and transform artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in science.\n\nThis new collaboration, part of the existing five-year partnership between the organisations, aims to catalyse the use of AI in the Australian research community through a range of activities including joint research, education, training and support.\n\nCSIRO’s AI for Science Program Director, Dr Stefan Harrer, said recent improvements and increased access to generative AI technology has enabled researchers to use AI in entirely new ways.\n\n“Narrow AI, AI trained for a specific task, has been used by scientists for years to great effect. For example, Google’s AlphaFold model has made fundamental breakthroughs in protein structure prediction,” Dr Harrer said.\n\n“Responsible use of broad, generative AI has the potential to not only accelerate, but transform scientific discovery.”\n\nBefore the advent of generative AI, researchers would spend years developing AI models that could not scale or be easily transferred to new scientific problems. This meant using AI tools was out of scope for many researchers.\n\n“Now there’s been a fundamental shift in the way AI can be used in research, we want to ensure Australian researchers have the skillset to reap the benefits,” Dr Harrer said.\n\nLizzie Dorfman, PhD, Product Lead for Science AI in Google Research said: “We’re constantly inspired by the ability of AI to help tackle grand challenges in science.\n\n“At Google, scientists and engineers use AI to accelerate scientific discovery in biology, chemistry, earth science and beyond.\n\n“We strongly believe in the value of sharing these approaches – collaboration has always been central to scientific progress and to our scientific research at Google.\n\n“I am excited that Google is investing even further in community building within the Australian science community and extending our partnership with CSIRO.”\n\nThis announcement is a part of the five-year collaboration agreement announced in 2021 which has already automated the identification of invasive starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, is identifying and mapping seagrass meadows to better understand their carbon sequestration potential, and using AI to help preserve and restore endangered Giant Kelp forests.\n\nSource: CSIRO\n\nTigercat Releases 6040 Carbonizer\n\nTigercat Industries is very pleased to announce the official release of the 6040 carbonizer. This long awaited product replaces the 6050 carbonator that Tigercat marketed for a brief time after acquiring the product through the purchase of ROI in 2019. The mobile onsite wood conversion system is once again available in the marketplace after a comprehensive, ground-up redesign.\n\nThe 6040 is one of the most environmentally friendly wood debris reduction and conversion systems available on the market. The machine inputs woody debris and produces a high quality organic carbon with up to 90% material reduction. It is an ideal solution for converting unwanted logging and agriculture residue into a useful, high grade organic carbon that can be left onsite as a soil additive or marketed for many different commercial uses. The process captures 20 to 30 percent of the available carbon in the feedstock and sequesters it for thousands of years, furthering the goals of greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. The innovative conversion process operates at high throughput levels and produces very low emissions because the gasses are combusted in the controlled combustion zone.\n\nThe 6040 redesign addresses performance related issues experienced in the original design and represents the knowledge of the applications that Tigercat engineers and field support personnel have gained over the past five years.\n\nGreat care has been taken to create a machine that allows modular replacement over time. For instance the grates in the carbonizing chamber are now made up of seven different sections that can be rotated 180 degrees to balance wear and extend life. Individual sections can be replaced as required. The undercarriage, auger trough, and conveyor system are all bolt-on sections to the main carbonizing chamber frame. Everything can be separated for service and replacement if required. The modular bolt-on design also allows for differing expansion rates of these major components.\n\nThe replaceable thermal-ceramic panel seal plate design has been improved, reducing panel wear. The composition of the panels has been altered to decrease back-face temperature while storing and utilizing more of the heat energy produced during the carbonizing process. This provides a more stable and sustained temperature within the carbonizing chamber. The result is increased efficiency, higher infeed rates, reduced emissions, and a greater yield of higher quality organic carbon.\n\nThe auger trough is designed for minimal air leakage, assisting with under-air efficiency, further defining the secondary combustion zone, while reducing hotspots that could form from an inefficient base pressure or vacuum. Unlike the 6050, the auger trough, where the quenching process takes place, is entirely sealed. Once the organic carbon drops through the grates, it is fully quenched by the water bath. An onboard hydraulic water supply pump and integrated automatic water level control system reduces water consumption by about 50% compared with the 6050. Automated water fill, level control, and water retention provides the operator a window of time to replenish the water supply if required.\n\nThe adjustable conveyor simplifies handling and management of the organic carbon product. It pivots 105 degrees from side to side and can be raised or lowered. The conveyor easily folds for transport and does not have to be detached from the machine frame.\n\nTemperature control sensors are located throughout the machine. This, coupled with the Tigercat designed operating software and telematics system, improves data access and customer support. The 6040 development also emphasized parts commonality among other Tigercat products including pumps, motors, valves and filters, simplifying parts inventory management at the dealer and end user level.\n\nThe overall machine weight has been reduced from 43 550 kg (96,000 lb) to 37 650 kg (83,000 lb). Extended track frames improve load distribution on the trailer and reduce soil compaction on the ground.\n\nSource: Tigercat\n\nWaratah’s new H216 hardwood head\n\nWaratah Forestry Equipment has unveiled the H216 – a new two-roller head added to its 200 Series lineup. Built for hardwood, the H216 is strong enough to handle the toughest tree forms with accuracy and efficiency.

The company recently started up a new USNR Bioluma trimline to further increase production capacity and recovery.\n\n“The trim line project went very well; good installation, machinery went together well, and start-up was smooth. We’re very happy with the result and performance.” ̶ Andy Archer, Mill Manager\n\nRed Stag Timber is focused on growth and efficiency. Building on the successful installation of the USNR dual quad log line and dual edger lines, the decision was made to unleash the full potential of the sawmill by installing a second trimline and stacker line.\n\nThis new trimmer line in the Rotorua, NZ, mill features a high-speed multi-saw Clamshell trimmer to maximize trim accuracy and flexibility. Bioluma 2900LV scanning sensors are paired with USNR’s new MillGenius trimmer optimizer for a powerful system that delivers high value, recovery, throughput, and reliability. Red Stag Timber is the first to use MillGenius software in New Zealand.\n\nUpstream, a Revolver lug loader uses MillTrak cameras to manage the backlog as it deals boards into lugs ahead of the scanning system. The line also features the renowned all-electric and infinitely positional Multi-Track Fence to maximize trim saw accuracy and flexibility.\n\nUSNR provided the PLC controls, operator consoles, and HMI’s for the line along with a PLC-based safety system. The mill uses the WinTally Sorter Manager to setup sorts and manage bins, while the PLC and HMI systems generate alarms, messages, and downtime reports for the line.\n\nRed Stag Timber saw an immediate increase in production with the installation of the second trimline. The piece-per-minute bottleneck at the original trimline disappeared, and the log gap has been reduced to increase piece count. The mill has also seen a reduction in stoppages from board handling issues.\n\nInvesting in this line has increased Red Stag’s current capacity and it’s designed for further expansion. The next stage is to add a second sawline to the sawmill operation. USNR is proud to partner with our long-term customer Red Stag Timber on this project.\n\nTo watch a short video of the operation, click here\n\nSource: USNR\n\nUsing your phone as a digital inventory tool\n\nDiameter at the breast height (DBH) is essential in single tree and stand measurement, spanning a wide range of applications, from traditional forestry to carbon accounting, ecology, forest inventories and forest monitoring. Although they can provide instant readings, traditional DBH measurement methods still rely heavily on mechanical measurement, and often lack the capability of storing, transferring and, therefore, making a better use of the collected data.\n\nIn addition, they may take a longer measurement cycle time and may provide poorer ergonomic and safety conditions, mainly because they imply a direct contact measurement, and make use of rather heavy to carry tools; operating costs could be another good reason when checking for their economic performance, since they typically require more human resources as compared to digital tools.\n\nThese characteristics make them rather incompatible with the modern concepts of sustainable forestry, at least under economic and ergonomics points of view. In addition, they cannot provide the data in the required format and information flows as specific to Forestry 4.0 and individual tree detection and measurement.\n\nThe latest developments in proximal sensing technology, as well as the integration of advanced sensors in smart portable devices have provided new opportunities for measuring tree biometrics at affordable costs and with minimal inputs of resources. Technologies such as those developed by Google for Android-based platforms, or by Apple for iPhone and iPad platforms have already been tested in measuring the main biometrics of trees and logs with promising results. These were complemented by studies that tested or described the capabilities of professional LiDAR scanners and which concluded that such devices may reach a high accuracy when used in forestry applications, including for the measurement of main biometrics of the trees or logs.\n\nStill, the main challenges of using professional LiDAR scanners are those related to the investments in equipment, which remained high over the last years, as well as in a lower portability, which make them less suitable when working in rough terrain. In some data collection configurations, one may add the occlusion effects, which may lead to loosing important data. Obviously, the use of low-weight and highly mobile devices such as the smartphones may overcome many of these limitations but, irrespective of the device used, instant readings of the measurement results, as well as the capability to store, document and transfer the data are important features to consider when choosing a measurement solution.\n\nThese requirements constrain the available set of digital DBH measurement solutions to couple of software applications such as developed by Arboreal Forest and Measure App developed by Apple . Both of them take advantage of close-range LiDAR sensing and Augmented Reality technology, which comes handy for orientation and effective operation, and provide instant readings of the measurement results as opposed to the use of rather resource intensive algorithms to obtain the results in an offline approach.\n\nThe Arboreal Forest app features several advanced features such as those related to species recognition, DBH and height measurement, and setting of inventory plots, in addition to a dedicated platform for data transfer and storage.\n\nA recent study was setup to compare the readings on DBH as they were taken by the Arboreal Forest and Measure App to the readings taken manually by a digital caliper. The main aim of the study was to describe and characterize the accuracy of the two tested digital methods in relation to the manual method.\n\nThe study concluded that digital DBH measurement options supported by affordable mobile platforms equipped with LiDAR and AR technologies are accurate and compatible with the DBH measurement requirements when compared to the manual option.\n\nMore >> and commentary on the study results from Arboreal Forest can be read here.\n\nAs part of this year’s ForestTECH 2024 series running in Rotorua, New Zealand on 20-21 November and in Melbourne, Australia on 26-27 November, Sweden’s Arboreal Forest’s CEO and Founder, Johan Ekenstedt will be outlining to local foresters, how an in-phone Lidar and scanner (the Arboreal Forest app from the App Store) can and are being used as an alternative to traditional manual tree measurement methods.\n\nSource: Ecological Informatics, Arboreal Forest\n\nWinning night for Taylors Contracting\n\nStrong recognition of the contribution Brightwater company Taylors Contracting makes to forestry in the region was provided at the Top of the South Forestry Awards on Friday (19 July), with Taylors Contracting nominees winning four awards.\n\nForestry Department Manager Mike Fahey took out the Hero of the Industry Award for 2024. The award recognises Mike’s 40 years working in the forestry sector, most of it spent with Taylors.\n\n“We love it when our people are recognised for their work,” Taylors CEO Charlie Taylor says. “Forestry is a very important part of our business and our success in these awards reflects our commitment to what is a vital part of the local economy.”\n\nTaylors nominees received awards across a wide range of categories at the event which was held at the Trafalgar Centre in Nelson. It was a night of records for the awards event, which attracted 580 attendees (exceeding the number of attendees in 2022) and a remarkable 78 award nominations.\n\nTaylors’ contractor Kevin Palmer of AC Palmer & Sons shared the Truck Driver Excellence category with Chris Dyer of Borlase Transport with Kevin also taking the big award of the night, Skilled Professional of the Year.\n\nThe judges said, “Committed to the industry through his family’s business, Kevin’s dedication to excellence, commitment to safety, and proactive approach to environmental practices made him a deserving recipient of the award. Kevin’s reputation for delivering exceptional service highlights his exceptional contribution to the forestry sector.”\n\nTaylors Contracting’s Heavy Equipment Operator John Brunsden won the award for Roading Civil Excellence which, when considered alongside Kevin’s effort in the driving section, demonstrates the organisation’s commitment to safe and efficient operations, says Charlie Taylor.\n\nTaylors was a finalist in the Outstanding Environmental Management Award, which reflects the company’s endeavours to be good environmental stewards. “The environment is very important to our company and to be in contention for this award shows we don’t just talk the talk we walk the walk,” Charlie says.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Tasman District Council Mayor Tim King as he presented the award for Outstanding Environmental Management. Mayor King said that the forestry industry had come a long way with respect to its approach to environmental management. This was indicated by the fact that Taylors Contracting had nominated one of its operators Jacob Ching for the awards’ Good Deed category for saving an endangered snail.\n\n“While we work hard internally to recognise the efforts and successes of everyone in our team, including our long-standing contractors, it’s a real boost when we are recognised externally for our efforts,” Charlie says. “These successes are something we can all be proud of.” About Taylors Contracting:\n\nTaylors Contracting is a family-owned business established in 1971 that employs more than 150 people. It is based at its purpose-built facility in Brightwater and has a regional office in Christchurch.

Details on the content and coverage for the 20-21 November Rotorua, New Zealand event and 26-27 November 2024 event running in Melbourne, Australia the week after, can now be found on the ForestTECH 2024 website.\n\nThe annual end-of-year forest technology series every year, continues to draw in foresters, resource managers and forest contractors from across Australasia. Over the last few years, well over 300 delegates have been involved. As evidenced by recent growth and turnouts of delegates, both live and virtual, from over 15 counties, it has a well- deserved and now truly international standing amongst the global forest community.\n\nAs well as the integration of remote sensing, forest data capture and inventory management technologies into forest operations, machine automation is increasingly being integrated into silvicultural operations so new innovations around tree crop management, automated silviculture (including mechanised planting, thinning and pruning operations) and forest establishment are being built into the November series.\n\nThe economics in New Zealand are now starting to stack up for mechanised or automated operations for both planting and silviculture. The technology addresses the growing issue of labour shortages being faced by forest companies over the planting season and with thinning and pruning operations. As well as New Zealand and Australia, mechanised planting is already successfully being used across Scandinavia, Brazil, Chile, the USA and Canada.\n\nAs detailed at recent ForestTECH events by forest companies and planting contractors, operational trials have successfully been undertaken with commercial planting already underway in New Zealand in the central North Island (CNI), Hawkes Bay and top of the South Island, and in Victoria, NSW, Queensland and Western Australia in Australia.\n\nAt this year’s ForestTECH 2024 event, presentations around mechanised planting and automated silviculture include;\n\nTaking the M-Planter South. Mechanised planting operations in forest sites of up to 30 degrees. How’s it performed outside the central North Island, NZ?\n\nLeveraging the Experience of Mechanised Forest Harvesting and Technologies Developed for Agriculture into Forest Silviculture.

With BraSatt, Södra aims to accelerate innovation in planting, as it contributes to significant improvements for forestry by increasing plant survival and forest growth.\n\n“We have created unique technology for both ground preparation and planting. Through constructive dialogue and an open mind, together with a group of experts, we have quickly moved from concept ideas to showing a prototype in the field. With our investment, rejuvenation technology takes a significant step forward. Going forward, we would like to find more partners to take the next step,” says Anna Wallner, project manager for BraSatt at Södra.\n\nFor a more sustainable solution to planting, the consortium has designed a precision-based machine with a focus on user experience to guide the project to ensure that the technology is well received by forest owners. The machine’s unique design also reflects the advanced technology inside. With the help of AI and sensors, the machine handles different conditions consistently and efficiently with high precision. Each seedling is planted with exact coordinates, building a knowledge bank for the future.\n\n“Our design philosophy was that the machine should convey the same calm and confidence as a colleague in the field. Predictability is crucial when it comes to automation. Therefore, the machine has a calm and responsive design language, while its diagonal cuts give a clear direction. We have ensured that the operator can easily guide and plan the robot’s work with a route planner and an intuitive interface, creating a reliable companion in the forest,” says David Lamm, Creative Director at Boid.\n\nBraSatt was showcased at the international forestry fair IUFRO on 23-29 June 2024, at Stockholmsmässan, Sweden.\n\nIn addition, Anna Wallner, Project Manager for BraSatt at Södra, will be updating foresters across Australasia on progress and trial results from this autonomous planting machine as part of the of the ForestTECH 2024 series running in Rotorua, New Zealand on the 20-21 November event and 26-27 November 2024 in Melbourne, Australia the week after. Programme and event details can be found on the ForestTECH 2024 website.\n\nSödra to become the largest producer of kraft lignin in the world\n\nAs a step in the strategy of getting more out of every tree, Södra is now establishing a new business to become a world leader in the production of kraft lignin. Södra’s production facility will be the first commercial facility in Sweden and the largest of its kind in the world. This is an investment of over two billion SEK and expected to be in operation in 2027.\n\nKraft lignin can replace fossil materials in, among other things, glue, batteries, rubber, composites and form the basis for new biofuels and biostimulators. The market and demand for replacements for fossil chemicals are increasing and Södra has for some time been exploring the opportunities on the market, had dialogue with potential customers and signed offtake agreements for a significant part of the production volumes. There is good possibility for kraft lignin production both to contribute to the green transition and the profitability of the forest estate.\n\n”The forest is being called on for many things as society seeks to replace fossil-based materials. To succeed in that transition, sustainability and profitability need to go hand in hand and Södra’s kraft lignin investment is a good example of that. We will make more out of every tree and strengthen our profitability. This is a big investment for Södra and the green transition,” says Lotta Lyrå, CEO of Södra.\n\nToday, lignin is used for generating energy, but the refining process Södra is investing in will make more use of the raw material as a product. This is in line with Södra’s strategy to make more of each tree and create more value for the forest estate.\n\n”Innovation is a necessary and important part of our business to ensure our competitiveness today and in the future. We are constantly working to create the most possible value from each tree, both with today’s processes and through new opportunities. Within Södra’s strategy, we see several future energy and chemical products with great potential as alternatives to fossil-based materials in society, of which kraft lignin is one,” says Catrin Gustavsson, Executive Vice President at Södra Innovation.\n\n”With kraft lignin in our product portfolio, we are strengthening our position as a supplier of sustainable alternatives. Södra has seen potential in kraft lignin production for a long time. Now that we see growing market interest, we can offer a product that contributes to the green transition,” says Johannes Bogren, Vice President, Södra Bioproducts.\n\nSödra’s new facility will have the largest capacity for kraft lignin production in the world. Production is planned to start in 2027 and is enabled through the Swedish Energy Agency and The Industrial Leap.\n\nWhat is lignin\n\nLignin is the component of the forest raw material that holds the fibres together and ensures that trees are strong and stable. In separated form, lignin is a brown powder. In chemical language, lignin is a biopolymer comprising a series of interconnected aromatic compounds. Södra has for many years collaborated with, and supported, research on lignin and has extensive knowledge about lignin and the opportunities it brings.\n\nIn the pulp cooking phase, lignin is released so that the fibres can be released and become pulp or dissolving pulp. This means that large amounts of lignin are created at the mills and that part of the lignin can be separated and become a product. Today, lignin generates steam and electricity to operate the mills, of which a surplus is sold to the public power grid.\n\nWhat is ”Industriklivet” (Industrial Leap)\n\nThe Swedish Parliament has adopted the climate goal that Sweden should reach net zero emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by 2045, and then achieve negative emissions. Large and complex technological leaps by several industries will be needed to achieve this. To support the transition, the Government has decided on a long-term investment approach called Industriklivet (Industrial Leap).\n\nSince 2021, Industriklivet has been part of the green transition to a climate-smart society after the COVID-19 pandemic and is part of the EU’s Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). RRF is an element of Next Generation EU that, among other things, will contribute to a more environmentally friendly EU, better adapted to current and future challenges.\n\nSource: Sodra\n\nJohn Deere enters mechanised tree planting market Broader focus on silviculture\n\nWith the increased importance that the global Forest Industry has on the decarbonization of the atmosphere, and in order to help global forestry customers meet the growing demand for sustainably sourced, cost-effective wood products, John Deere Forestry has shifted its strategic focus from forest harvesting to include the entire Forestry Production System. This is not new at John Deere, since their agriculture team has successfully leveraged Production System thinking to develop a host of technology-driven products that have significantly improved agricultural yield and efficiency, while reducing input costs for farmers.\n\nApplying this holistic thinking to the forest industry, it was clear that the forest harvesting segment has experienced a significant improvement in productivity, efficiency, and safety through mechanization over the past four decades. Forest harvesting has undergone a significant transformation, but silviculture is an area of the overall Forestry Production System that hasn’t experienced much change.\n\nAs John Deere Forestry explored this further with customers and forest owners worldwide, it was clear that increased urbanization was making it increasingly difficult to attract and retain forest workers for the labour-intensive jobs typically found in silviculture. In some regions, especially those that have experienced higher than normal forest losses due to the effects of climate change (forest fire, insect infestations, drought etc.), silviculture activities are so constrained by the labour shortage that it is putting significant pressure on maintaining the exceptional history of sustainably managing the forest ecosystem.\n\nJohn Deere Forestry saw an opportunity to leverage their experience with mechanized forest harvesting and the development of precision soil preparation, planting and spraying technology for agriculture and apply it to silviculture.\n\nBrazilian forests as a starting point\n\nLike all significant change activities, you have to start somewhere. In discussions with forest customers worldwide, they saw a good opportunity to work with Brazil’s forestry industry primarily because they have very organized silvicultural activities, their plantation forestry infrastructure is well defined, and their forests have very short rotation times – which provides John Deere with quick feedback on the positive and any potential negative impacts of mechanized silviculture. Additionally, there was considerable “pull” from Brazil’s forest industry for mechanized silviculture solutions to help them meet the growth of the eucalyptus plantation forest area over the coming decade.\n\nAccording to the latest survey by the Brazilian Tree Industry (Ibá, January 2022), the Brazilian forestry sector has 9.5 million hectares of productive forests. In addition to the significant investment in sustainably managed productive forests, Brazil’s forest industry has also developed another 6 million hectares of native forest, exclusively for conservation and providing a natural habitat for native species.\n\nMechanized planting as a solution to challenges?\n\nLeveraging customer-focused processes, developed by the John Deere Ag Advanced Marketing team, they mapped the entire Silviculture Production System and looked at the areas where customers were experiencing the biggest challenges. They also looked at where the biggest opportunities existed for customers to improve productivity and efficiency. Comparing the challenges and the opportunities, they quickly identified that mechanized planting provided one of the biggest opportunities for Brazilian customers to meet the challenges they were facing.\n\nThey assembled a small, highly talented team by bringing together people with experience in Forestry, Agriculture and Construction equipment development. Working closely with customers, this team managed to quickly create a concept Mechanized Seedling Planter that was initially sent for customer testing in early 2020. Unfortunately, the global pandemic stopped our testing and they had to reassemble their efforts during the pandemic based on very limited customer feedback.\n\nPromising test results John Deere Forestry were able to resume field testing after the global travel restrictions were lifted. They presented the concept Mechanized Seedling Planter to many customers at the Florestal 2022 forestry show in Três Lagoas, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in May 2022.\n\nThe Mechanized Seedling Planter is currently undergoing further customer testing. Initial feedback is very favourable, and they are on track to meet the customer’s request to be able to plant one hectare of forest per hour and significantly reduce manual labour by approximately 90%. In order to achieve these results, they integrated several technologies leveraged directly from Agriculture, such as automated path planning and steering, which simplifies the operation of the machine and improves the overall quality of the planting.\n\nContinuous development for healthier forests The Mechanized Seedling Planter is designed to be adaptable to different species and is intended to be used in different forestry markets around the world. The planter is built on the 1510G forwarder that is in serial production at the Joensuu factory in Finland. The 1510G’s performance and ergonomics provide an industry leading platform for the silviculture solutions Deere is developing.\n\nMechanized planting is only the beginning; through the leverage of Agriculture technologies, there are further opportunities to improve the productivity and efficiency, while reducing input costs for forest owners. Emerging technologies like the recently released John Deere See and Spray™ have significant potential to further reduce the cost of silviculture activities while improving the health of the forest.\n\nMore . Recent trial results for local foresters As part of this year’s eagerly awaited ForestTECH 2024 series in November where research, trial results and operational lessons from mechanised tree planting are going to be unveiled to local foresters, Matti Tarkka, program manager for John Deere Forestry’s silviculture program in Finland, will be outlining in greater detail the testing results from the John Deere Mechanized Seedling Planter from Brazilian forests and plans for the new planting machine in this part of the world.\n\nDetails on the content and coverage for the 20-21 November Rotorua, New Zealand event and 26-27 November 2024 event running in Melbourne, Australia the week after, can now be found on the 2024 ForestTECH 2024 website.\n\n€100 m investment in wood-based EV batteries\n\nStora Enso Oyj is preparing to invest about €100 million in a pioneering project to use wood in electric vehicle batteries and offer an alternative to components currently made in China, according to its chief executive officer. The funds would be used for a “demonstration-scale unit,” which is significantly bigger than the current pilot facility, Hans Sohlstrom said in an interview in Helsinki where Stora is based. No final investment decision has been made yet, he said.\n\nThe Finnish forestry company is developing a sustainable material that can used as anodes in batteries, helping Europe reduce its reliance on non-renewable, mined or synthetically produced Chinese imports. The ingredient, lignin, makes up as much as a third of a tree and is one of the biggest renewable sources of carbon, Stora says.\n\nHowever, the company, which generates its revenue from pulp, packaging materials, and wood products, is still “several years” away from mass-scale production after starting in 2021, according to the CEO. After the demonstration facility, Stora plans to build a commercial-scale unit, which would require “a big capital investment of hundreds of millions” of euros, he said, adding Stora will need to invest about two euros to create one euro of revenue.\n\n“We also need to see whether we do it ourselves — a big investment into the commercial-scale unit — or whether we do it as a joint venture with, for instance, a battery manufacturer,” said Sohlstrom, who was appointed as CEO in September.\n\nStora said earlier this month it has partnered with Swedish sodium-ion battery developer Altris AB to drive the commercialization of sustainable batteries using a hard carbon derived from lignin, which is a by-product of pulp manufacturing. In 2022, it announced a collaboration with Swedish battery maker Northvolt AB.\n\nFurther coverage on the technology, click here\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Stora Enso\n\nFree advanced timber design software for NZ engineers\n\n“Timber Unlimited is thrilled to partner with CLT Toolbox to offer parts of this advanced software for free to New Zealand industry.

The region’s farmers and forestry companies might end up with designated land they can’t operate on under new council plans.\n\nCouncil chief executive Nedine Thatcher Swann said they were looking at more accurate identification and management of erosion risks across Tairāwhiti. “Overlay 3B” is coined in council reports as “the worst eroding land across the region”. Through identification, Gisborne District Council aims to “landmark” these areas, mandating some pastoral farming and forestry owners to transition their land into permanent vegetation cover.\n\nA council report says the land use changes “crystalised in the wake of cyclones Hale and Gabrielle in early 2023”. Overlay 3B is an extension of the current land overlay framework in the Tairāwhiti Resource Management Plan (TRMP).\n\nGisborne District Council (GDC) requested Manaaki Whenua — Landcare Research to help identify which areas in the region have a high likelihood of landslides, and whether these landslides will affect waterways. According to a council report, the map was completed in March 2024.\n\n“The model utilises advanced technology and builds on previous regional research,” Thatcher Swann said in a statement. “It analyses where landslides occur and their potential to impact waterways, drawing on data collected across the region.”\n\nEastland Wood Council (EWC) chief executive Philip Hope said they received the database just over a week ago and were still working through what it meant for EWC members. “At an initial glance, we believe it is a marked improvement on previously available mapping for Tairāwhiti. Our industry is working through meetings with Gisborne District Council to better understand the information, including how it was developed.”\n\nIt would take time to understand the data and talk to their members to form views on this model, Hope said. “We expect it will have significant implications on how all land is managed in the future and think it could be a useful tool as our district works towards increasingly sustainable land use, such as retirement, rehabilitation and conversion – and where appropriate, the status quo.”\n\nEWC would continue to work with the council, iwi and mana whenua on sustainable land use and planning in Tairāwhiti, he said.\n\nMore >>\n\nCanadian developed Hydrogen-diesel system secured\n\nHVMS, a leading provider in the decarbonisation of transportation, has announced the establishment of its partnership with Canadian company Diesel Tech Industries, to establish installation facilities for the Guardian Hydrogen Diesel System.
