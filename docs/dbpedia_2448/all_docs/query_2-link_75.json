Improving CSMA/CA is important because the low-power consumption feature and throughput performance of IEEE 802.15.4 are greatly affected by CSMA/CA behavior. To improve the performance of CSMA/CA, this paper focused on increasing the chance to transmit a packet by assessing precise channel status. The previous method used in CCA, which is employed by CSMA/CA, assesses the channel by measuring the energy level of the channel. However, this method shows limited channel assessing behavior, which comes from simple threshold dependent channel busy evaluation. The proposed method solves this limited channel decision problem by dividing CCA into two groups. Two groups of CCA compare their energy levels to get precise channel status. To evaluate the performance of the segmentized CCA method, a Markov chain model has been developed. The validation of analytic results is confirmed by comparing them with simulation results. Additionally, simulation results show the proposed method is improving a maximum 8.76% of throughput and decreasing a maximum 3.9% of the average number of CCAs per packet transmission than the IEEE 802.15.4 CCA method.\n\nSegmentized Clear Channel Assessment for IEEE 802.15.4 Networks\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSon, Kyou Jung; Hong, Sung Hyeuck; Moon, Seong-Pil; Chang, Tae Gyu; Cho, Hanjin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis paper proposed segmentized clear channel assessment (CCA) which increases the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 networks by improving carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA).

These partnerships also include technology development that enables grid modernization and distributed energy resources (DER) advancement, especially renewable energy systems integration with the grid. Through DOE/NREL and industry support of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards development, the IEEE 1547 series of standards has helped shape the way utilities and other businesses have worked together to realize increasing amounts of DER interconnected with the distribution grid. And more recently, the IEEE 2030 series ofmoreÂ Â» standards is helping to further realize greater implementation of communications and information technologies that provide interoperability solutions for enhanced integration of DER and loads with the grid. For these standards development partnerships, for approximately $1 of federal funding, industry partnering has contributed $5. In this report, the status update is presented for the American National Standards IEEE 1547 and IEEE 2030 series of standards. A short synopsis of the history of the 1547 standards is first presented, then the current status and future direction of the ongoing standards development activities are discussed.Â«Â less\n\nCompetency Testing for Pediatric Cardiology Fellows Learning Transthoracic Echocardiography: Implementation, Fellow Experience, and Lessons Learned.\n\nPubMed\n\nLevine, Jami C; Geva, Tal; Brown, David W\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThere is currently great interest in measuring trainee competency at all levels of medical education. In 2007, we implemented a system for assessing cardiology fellows' progress in attaining imaging skills. This paradigm could be adapted for use by other cardiology programs. Evaluation consisted of a two-part exercise performed after years 1 and 2 of pediatric cardiology training. Part 1: a directly observed evaluation of technical skills as fellows imaged a normal subject (year 1) and a patient with complex heart disease (year 2). Part 2: fellows interpreted and wrote reports for two echocardiograms illustrating congenital heart disease. These were graded for accuracy and facility with communicating pertinent data. After 5Â years of testing, fellows were surveyed about their experience. In 5Â years, 40 fellows were tested at least once. Testing identified four fellows who underperformed on the technical portion and four on the interpretive portion. Surveys were completed by 33 fellows (83Â %). Most (67Â %) felt that intermittent observation by faculty was inadequate for assessing skills and that procedural volume was a poor surrogate for competency (58Â %). Posttest feedback was constructive and valuable for 90, and 70Â % felt the process helped them set goals for skill improvement. Overall, fellows felt this testing was fair and should continue. Fellow performance and responses identified programmatic issues that were creating barriers to learning. We describe a practical test to assess competency for cardiology fellows learning echocardiography. This paradigm is feasible, has excellent acceptance among trainees, and identifies trainees who need support. Materials developed could be easily adapted to help track upcoming ACGME-mandated metrics.\n\nOncology Fellows' Career Plans, Expectations, and Well-Being: Do Fellows Know What They Are Getting Into?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShanafelt, Tait D.; Raymond, Marilyn; Horn, Leora; Moynihan, Tim; Collichio, Frances; Chew, Helen; Kosty, Michael P.; Satele, Daniel; Sloan, Jeff; Gradishar, William J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose To evaluate the career plans, professional expectations, and well-being of oncology fellows compared with actual experiences of practicing oncologists. Methods US oncology fellows taking the 2013 Medical Oncology In-Training Examination (MedOnc ITE) were invited to participate in an optional postexamination survey. The survey evaluated fellows' career plans and professional expectations and measured burnout, quality of life (QOL), fatigue, and satisfaction with work-life balance (WLB) using standardized instruments. Fellows' professional expectations and well-being were compared with actual experiences of US oncologists assessed simultaneously. Results Of the 1,637 oncology fellows in the United States, 1,373 (83.9%) took the 2013 MedOnc ITE. Among these, 1,345 (97.9%) completed the postexamination survey. The frequency of burnout among fellows decreased from 43.3% in year 1 to 31.7% in year 2 and 28.1% in year 3 (P < .001). Overall, the rate of burnout among fellows and practicing oncologists was similar (34.1% v 33.7%; P = .86). With respect to other dimensions of well-being, practicing oncologists had lower fatigue (P < .001) and better overall QOL scores (P < .001) than fellows but were less satisfied with WLB (P = .0031) and specialty choice (P < .001). Fellows' expectations regarding future work hours were 5 to 6 hours per week fewer than oncologists' actual reported work hours. Levels of burnout (P = .02) and educational debt (P â¤ .004) were inversely associated with ITE scores. Fellows with greater educational debt were more likely to pursue private practice and less likely to plan an academic career. Conclusion Oncology fellows entering practice trade one set of challenges for another. Unrealized expectations regarding work hours may contribute to future professional dissatisfaction, burnout, and challenges with WLB.

To address the lack of communication education pediatric critical care medicine fellows receive, the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh PICU developed a simulation-based communication course, Pediatric Critical Care Communication course. Pediatric critical care medicine trainees have limited prior training in communication and will have increased confidence in their communication skills after participating in the Pediatric Critical Care Communication course. Pediatric Critical Care Communication is a 3-day course taken once during fellowship featuring simulation with actors portraying family members. Off-site conference space as part of a pediatric critical care medicine educational curriculum. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine Fellows. Didactic sessions and interactive simulation scenarios. Prior to and after the course, fellows complete an anonymous survey asking about 1) prior instruction in communication, 2) preparedness for difficult conversations, 3) attitudes about end-of-life care, and 4) course satisfaction. We compared pre- and postcourse surveys using paired Student t test. Most of the 38 fellows who participated over 4 years had no prior communication training in conducting a care conference (70%), providing bad news (57%), or discussing end-of-life options (75%). Across all four iterations of the course, fellows after the course reported increased confidence across many topics of communication, including giving bad news, conducting a family conference, eliciting both a family's emotional reaction to their child's illness and their concerns at the end of a child's life, discussing a child's code status, and discussing religious issues. Specifically, fellows in 2014 reported significant increases in self-perceived preparedness to provide empathic communication to families regarding many aspects of discussing critical care, end\n\n2011 Einstein Fellows Chosen\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2011-03-01\n\nASA has announced the selection of the 2011 Einstein Fellows who will conduct research related to NASA's Physics of the Cosmos program, which aims to expand our knowledge of the origin, evolution, and fate of the Universe. The Einstein Fellowship provides support to the awardees for three years, and the Fellows may pursue their research at a host university or research center of their choosing in the United States. The new Fellows will begin their programs in the fall of 2011. The new Einstein Fellows and their host institutions are listed below: * Akos Bogdan (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Cambridge, Mass.) * Samuel Gralla (University of Maryland, College Park, Md.) * Philip Hopkins (University of California at Berkeley) * Matthew Kunz (Princeton University, Princeton, N.J.) * Laura Lopez (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass.) * Amy Reines (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Charlottesville, Virg.) * Rubens Reis (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) * Ken Shen (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, Calif.) * Jennifer Siegal-Gaskins (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena) * Lorenzo Sironi (Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.) NASA has two other astrophysics theme-based fellowship programs: the Sagan Fellowship Program, which supports research into exoplanet exploration, and the Hubble Fellowship Program, which supports research into cosmic origins.

Proper radiation training and implementation of safety procedures is of critical importance in lowering physician health risks associated with radiation exposure. Participants were cardiology fellows in the United States (n = 2,545) who were contacted by e-mail to complete an anonymous survey regarding the knowledge and practice of radiation protection during catheterization laboratory procedures. An on-line survey engine, SurveyMonkey, was used to distribute and collect the results of the 10-question survey. The response rate was 10.5%. Of the 267 respondents, 82% had undergone formal radiation safety training. Only 58% of the fellows were aware of their hospital's pregnancy radiation policy and 60% knew how to contact the hospital's radiation safety officer. Although 52% of the fellows always wore a dosimeter, 81% did not know their level of radiation exposure in the previous year and only 74% of fellows knew the safe levels of radiation exposure. The fellows who had received formal training were more likely to be aware of their pregnancy policy, to know the contact information of their radiation safety officer, to be aware of the safe levels of radiation exposure, to use dosimeters and RadPad consistently, and to know their own level of radiation exposure in the previous year. In conclusion, cardiology fellows have not been adequately educated about radiation safety. A concerted effort directed at physician safety in the workplace from the regulatory committees overseeing cardiology fellowships should be encouraged.

The objective of this survey was to determine the current status and opportunities for robotic surgery training available to fellows training in the United States and Canada. Sixty-five minimally invasive surgery fellows, attending a fundamentals of fellowship conference, were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their demographics and experiences with robotic surgery and training. Fifty-one of the surveyed fellows completed the questionnaire (83Â % response). Seventy-two percent of respondents had staff surgeons trained in performing robotic procedures, with 55Â % of respondents having general surgery procedures performed robotically at their institution. Just over half (53Â %) had access to a simulation facility for robotic training. Thirty-three percent offered mechanisms for certification and 11Â % offered fellowships in robotic surgery. One-third of the minimally invasive surgery fellows felt they had been trained in robotic surgery and would consider making it part of their practice after fellowship. However, most (80Â %) had no plans to pursue robotic surgery fellowships. Although a large group (63Â %) felt optimistic about the future of robotic surgery, most respondents (72.5Â %) felt their current experience with robotic surgery training was poor or below average. There is wide variation in exposure to and training in robotic surgery in minimally invasive surgery fellowship programs in the United States and Canada. Although a third of trainees felt adequately trained for performing robotic procedures, most fellows felt that their current experience with training was not adequate.\n\nIEEE 1547 Standards Advancing Grid Modernization\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBasso, Thomas; Chakraborty, Sudipta; Hoke, Andy\n\nTechnology advances including development of advanced distributed energy resources (DER) and grid-integrated operations and controls functionalities have surpassed the requirements in current standards and codes for DER interconnection with the distribution grid. The full revision of IEEE Standards 1547 (requirements for DER-grid interconnection and interoperability) and 1547.1 (test procedures for conformance to 1547) are establishing requirements and best practices for state-of-the-art DER including variable renewable energy sources. The revised standards will also address challenges associated with interoperability and transmission-level effects, in addition to strictly addressing the distribution grid needs. This paper provides the status and future direction of the ongoingmoreÂ Â» development focus for the 1547 standards.Â«Â less\n\nIEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) is a scientific conference dedicated to mathematical, algorithmic, and computational aspects of biological and biomedical imaging, across all scales of observation.

Two OSCEs (\"distracted care team\" and \"frazzled intern\") were created to assess response to disruptive behavior. In case 1, a fellow used a colonoscopy simulator while interacting with a standardized patient (SP), nurse, and attending physician all played by actors. The nurse and attending were instructed to display specific disruptive behavior and disregard the fellow unless requested to stop the disruptive behavior and focus on the patient and procedure. In case 2, the fellow was to calm an intern managing a patient with massive gastrointestinal bleeding. The objective in both scenarios was to assess the fellows' ability to perform their duties while managing the disruptive behavior displayed by the actor. The SPs used checklists to rate fellows' performances. The fellows completed a self-assessment survey. Twelve fellows from four gastrointestinal fellowship training programs participated in the OSCE. In the \"distracted care team\" case, one-third of the fellows interrupted the conflict and refocused attention to the patient. Half of the fellows were able to display professionalism despite the heated discussion nearby. Fellows scored lowest in the interprofessionalism portion of post-OSCE surveys, measuring their ability to handle the conflict. In the \"frazzled intern\" case, 68% of fellows were able to establish a calm and professional relationship with the SP. Despite this success, only half of the fellows were successfully communicate a plan to the SP and only a third scored \"well done\" in a domain that focused on allowing the intern to think through the case with the fellow's guidance. Fellows must receive training on how to approach disruptive behavior. OSCEs are a tool that can assess fellow skills and set a culture for open discussion.\n\nDefining the IEEE-854 floating-point standard in PVS\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMiner, Paul S.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nA significant portion of the ANSI/IEEE-854 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic is defined in PVS (Prototype Verification System). Since IEEE-854 is a generalization of the ANSI/IEEE-754 Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, the definition of IEEE-854 in PVS also formally defines much of IEEE-754. This collection of PVS theories provides a basis for machine checked verification of floating-point systems. This formal definition illustrates that formal specification techniques are sufficiently advanced that is is reasonable to consider their use in the development of future standards.\n\nA regional teaching fellow community of practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nLittle, David; Butcher, Katrina; Atkinson, Simon; Still, Duncan; Vasant, Julia\n\n2014-12-01\n\nIncreasing numbers of clinical teaching fellows are responsible for a significant proportion of undergraduate teaching nationally. Developing a regional community of practice can help overcome the isolation of these posts, with potential benefits for all involved. A community of practice relies on the mutual engagement of people in a similar situation working towards a common goal. Working together and sharing resources enables teaching fellows to make the most of their post, which ultimately benefits those that they are teaching. We developed a regional clinical teaching fellow community of practice in Bristol in 2010/11. Our community has continued to develop since completing our posts as clinical teaching fellows, and has provided a platform for new communities to develop amongst the groups of subsequent teaching fellows coming through. We encourage all regions who have clinical teaching fellows to develop a regional community of practice We encourage all regions who have clinical teaching fellows to develop a regional community of practice. We also encourage trainees to join TASME (Trainees in the Association for the Study of Medical Education), a new national community of practice for trainees involved in medical education.

However, there has been relatively little emphasis on the acquisition of teaching skills in fellowship programs. Challenges to teaching by fellows during subspecialty training include demanding clinical duties, their limited knowledge base in the field, brief contact time with learners during consultative roles, and, for new fellows, personal unfamiliarity with the learners and hospital culture. Fellows' teaching skills can be improved by formal curricula addressing teaching, and by direct observation and feedback of teaching akin to what is provided for learning clinical care. Further expansion of fellow-as-teacher programs will allow in-depth training for fellows seeking careers as medical educators. Even without such dedicated programs, emphasis on honing teaching skills during fellowship will telegraph the importance of teaching and help evolve divisional culture. Such efforts can have a positive impact on patients and learners, and enhance the teaching skills of future faculty.\n\n34 CFR 650.30 - Where may fellows study?\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 34 Education 3 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 false Where may fellows study? 650.30 Section 650.30...?

At academic centers, patients receiving treatment are often seen by fellows. It has not been established what patients understand about fellowship training, therefore the purpose of this study was to explore their understanding and whether they are content with fellows taking part in their care. At West Virginia University/Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, the authors drafted a survey. This anonymous and voluntary survey abstracted basic patient demographic data and experience being cared for by fellows and basic knowledge of a Hematology/Oncology fellowship. Multiple-choice questions were drafted with 4 to 6 answer choices with no option for unknown. Surveys were collected over a 3-week period in July 2012. Patients were surveyed at outpatient appointments, infusion center visits, and laboratory draws. Two hundred twenty-six surveys were collected. Statistical analysis was performed and a binomial regression was fit to the data. There is evidence that higher levels of education are more likely to give correct answers (P = 0.035). Patients who stated that they had not seen a fellow or were unsure whether they had seen a fellow were more likely to select incorrect answers (P = 0.001). There is no statistical significance differentiating between cancer types in likelihood of getting answers correct. Of those surveyed, 1.77% felt that they completely understand the role of a fellow in their care, whereas 80.45% desired further information about fellows. Only 2.2% disliked having a fellow involved in their care. Patients at academic centers being seen by Hematology/Oncology fellows appear to have a lack of knowledge of a fellow's role and background but have a desire to be educated. Educational initiatives can be introduced to teaching institutions to help patients better understand the role of a fellow.\n\nNew Congressional science fellow\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKevin Vranes is AGU's Congressional Science Fellow for 2003-2004. Vranes, who finished his Ph.D. in physical oceanography at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory will spend a year in Washington, D.C. working in the personal office of a senator or representative, or on the staff of a congressional committee.In September, Vranes will join over 40 other scientists and engineers who can expect to serve as legislative assistants on Capitol Hill, carrying out a range of duties such as organizing congressional hearings, preparing legislation, advising on votes, meeting with lobbyists, writing press releases or speeches, and occasionally answering constituent mail. As they gain the trust of the senator or representative, Congressional Science Fellows could be asked for assistance on the U.S. House or Senate floor during legislative debates. In some cases, Fellows have accepted offers to become permanent staff members following their Fellowships.\n\nLeopold Fellows meet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHartmann, Dennis L.\n\nCommunicating the results of environmental science research to nonscientists was the focus of a week-long meeting of fellows of the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program (ALLP) in June. Participating were 20 mid-career university facultymembers, the first group of ALLP fellows to be selected.Discussions were held on the role of scientists in society, techniques for effective leadership, improving communications skills, and working productively with news media. The training program considers both print and broadcast media as well as other outreach vehicles. The meeting was held at Kah Nee Ta Resort on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, Warm Springs, Oregon, June 15-21, 1999.\n\nReport on the 2009 ESO Fellows Symposium\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEmsellem, Eric; West, Michael; Leibundgut, Bruno\n\n2009-09-01\n\nThe fourth ESO Fellows Symposium took place in Garching from 8-10 June 2009. This year's symposium brought together 28 ESO Fellows from Chile and Germany to meet their colleagues from across the ocean, discuss their research and provide feedback on ESO's Fellowship programme. This year's symposium also included training workshops to enhance the practical skills of ESO Fellows in today's competitive job market.\n\nTraining Psychiatry Addiction Fellows in Acupuncture.\n\nPubMed\n\nSerafini, Kelly; Bryant, Katurah; Ikomi, Jolomi; LaPaglia, Donna\n\n2016-06-01\n\nAcupuncture has been studied as an adjunct for addiction treatments. Because many hospitals, outpatient clinics, and facilities are integrating acupuncture treatment, it is important that psychiatrists remain informed about this treatment. This manuscript describes the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) protocol and its inclusion as part of the curriculum for psychiatry addictions fellows. Psychiatry and psychology fellows completed the NADA training (nâ=â20) and reported on their satisfaction with the training. Overall, participants stated that they found the training beneficial and many were integrating acupuncture within their current practice. Results support the acceptability of acupuncture training among psychiatry fellows in this program.\n\nAGU Fellow Roger Revelle Dies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDeVito, M. Catherine\n\nAGU Fellow Roger R.D. Revelle, past Oceanography section president and recipient of the William Bowie Medal, died July 15. Revelle was a pioneer in global warming research and plate tectonics, and a major contributor to oceanography, education, and public policy.Appointed an AGU Fellow in 1936, Revelle was president of the Oceanography section from 1953-1956. In 1968 he was awarded the Bowie Medal, AGU's highest honor. Revelle extended his activities beyond the limits of his specialty to actively work with scientists in other fields for the betterment of science. In presenting the award, George E. Backus described Revelle's career as one of bold and selfless service to science and his fellow man. âIf scientific progress is built on the shoulders of giants, Roger Revelle is certainly to be counted among the giants.â\n\n30 Years of APS Congressional Fellows: Looking Back and Looking Forward\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2003-04-01\n\nIn 1973 AAAS launched a Congressional Fellows Program, and APS was one of three founding participants. Since then, APS has funded one or two Fellows annually to work with a Congressional Committee or on the personal staff of a Member of Congress. These fellows individually and collectively have had and continue to have a large impact in Washington. Six Fellows from different periods of the 30-year program, including a current Member of Congress, will present their views and assessments of the Fellowship program. They will address how it affected them, what it has done for the country and how APS should plan for the future. There will be ample time for questions and discussion. Panelists: Ben Cooper, Association of Oil Pipe Lines (Fellow, 1973-74) Rush Holt, Member, House of Representatives (Fellow, 1982-83) Jane Alexander, Office of Naval Research (Fellow, 1986-87) Duncan Moore, University of Rochester (Fellow, 1993-94) Peter Rooney, House Committee on Science (Fellow, 1997-98) Sherri Stephan, Senate Committee on Government Affairs (Fellow, 2000-01)\n\nIEEE Standards activities: A year in review. Annual activities report 1996\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNONE\n\n1997-09-01\n\nFor IEEE Standards and the constituency it serves, 1996 was a milestone year. It was a period that signaled the beginning of the Standards Program of the future. This program responds to worldwide standards issues and to the technical, market and competitive strategies of industrial sectors. It represents technological innovation, global participation in electrotechnology standards development and dedication to the on-going advancement and promotion of new concepts and technology. Instrumental in ensuring IEEE`s growth opportunities and leadership position in electrotechnology standards development and dissemination is IEEE membership. The value of members and their involvement in IEEE Standards is vital tomoreÂ Â» IEEE`s ability to continuously be the best professional association in the world. To fulfill this vision, IEEE set forth five goals -- increased globalization, career enhancement, electronic dissemination of existing products and services, organizational improvements and public responsibility. Key in the process for the achievement of these goals is to make certain that IEEE members are well informed about opportunities and benefits the present system of standardization offers, and what the future system will offer. With the member in mind, the Standards Board reviewed its strategic direction and operational structures, and its ability to deliver products and services that are needed now and, more importantly, that will be needed in the future. This Annual Activities Report provides a comprehensive picture of 1996 accomplishments and performance. It gives readers a broad picture of the Standards Board`s activities, the evolving role of IEEE Standards and the technological opportunities that the Board encourages.Â«Â less\n\nEmotional Wellness of Current Musculoskeletal Radiology Fellows.\n\nPubMed\n\nPorrino, Jack; Mulcahy, Michael J; Mulcahy, Hyojeong; Relyea-Chew, Annemarie; Chew, Felix S\n\n2017-06-01\n\nBurnout is a psychological syndrome composed of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and sense of lack of personal accomplishment, as a result of prolonged occupational stress. The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of burnout among current musculoskeletal radiology fellows and to explore causes of emotional stress. A 24-item survey was constructed on SurveyMonkey using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. We identified 82 musculoskeletal radiology fellowship programs. We recruited subjects indirectly through the program director or equivalent. Fifty-eight respondents (48 male, 10 female) identified themselves as current musculoskeletal radiology fellows and completed the survey. Comparison of the weighted subscale means in our data to the Maslach normative subscale thresholds for medical occupations indicates that musculoskeletal radiology fellows report relatively high levels of burnout with regard to lack of personal accomplishment and depersonalization, whereas emotional exhaustion levels in our sample are within the average range reported by Maslach. Although male musculoskeletal radiology fellows experience relatively high levels in two of the three dimensions of burnout (depersonalization and personal accomplishment), female musculoskeletal radiology fellows experience relatively high burnout across all three dimensions. Job market-related stress and the effort required providing care for dependents significantly affect personal accomplishment. Conversely, imbalances in the work-life relationship and feelings of powerlessness are significantly associated with depersonalization and emotional exhaustion. Musculoskeletal radiology fellows report relatively high levels of burnout. Because the consequences of burnout can be severe, early identification and appropriate intervention should be a priority.

The fellowships are open to recent astronomy and astrophysics graduates worldwide. This year's winners will work for three years at a host astronomical institution in the United States where they will research problems broadly related to the scientific mission of the Chandra Observatory. The Chandra X-ray Observatory Fellowship Program is a joint venture between NASA and the Chandra X-ray Observatory Center in cooperation with the host institutions. The 1999 Fellows are: Markus Boettcher, a graduate of Bonn University, whose host institution will be Rice University; Jimmy Irwin, a graduate of the University of Virginia, will be hosted by the University of Michigan; Kristen Menou, a graduate of the University of Paris, will be hosted by Princeton University; Eliot Quataert, a graduate of Harvard University, will be hosted by the Institute for Advanced Study; Rudy Wijnands, a graduate of the University of Amsterdam, will be hosted by MIT; and Amy Barger, a graduate of Cambridge University, is a Fellow at large at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy. The Chandra Fellowship Program attracted forty-five applicants from eleven countries. A member of the review panel commented, \"I found it extremely difficult to choose between the many excellent entries.\" \"We are very pleased with the response to the program, and I am confident that the work of these fellows will enhance our understanding of the scientific problems to be explored by the Chandra X-ray Observatory,\" said Nancy Remage Evans, coordinator of the Fellowship Program. NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, formerly know as AXAF, will provide stunning new images and data of the extremely hot, active regions in the universe. Such regions exist where stars have exploded, where matter is swirling into black holes, and where clusters of galaxies are merging.

In the clinic, amblyopia is understood as poor visual acuity in an eye that was deprived of pattern vision early in life. By its nature, however, amblyopia has an adverse effect on the development of a binocular visual system and the interactions between signals from two eyes. Visual functions aside from visual acuity are impacted, and many studies have indicated compromised sensitivity in the fellow eye even though it demonstrates normal visual acuity. While these fellow eye deficits have been noted, no overarching theory has been proposed to describe why and under what conditions the fellow eye is impacted by amblyopia. Here, we consider four explanations that may account for decreased fellow eye sensitivity: the fellow eye is adversely impacted by treatment for amblyopia; the maturation of the fellow eye is delayed by amblyopia; fellow eye sensitivity is impacted for visual functions that rely on binocular cortex; and fellow eye deficits reflect an adaptive mechanism that works to equalize the sensitivity of the two eyes. To evaluate these ideas, we describe five visual functions that are commonly reported to be deficient in the amblyopic eye (hyperacuity, contrast sensitivity, spatial integration, global motion, and motion-defined form), and unify the current evidence for fellow eye deficits. Further research targeted at exploring fellow eye deficits in amblyopia will provide us with a broader understanding of normal visual development and how amblyopia impacts the developing visual system.\n\nIEEE 802.11ah: A Technology to Face the IoT Challenge.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaÃ±os-Gonzalez, Victor; Afaqui, M Shahwaiz; Lopez-Aguilera, Elena; Garcia-Villegas, Eduard\n\n2016-11-22\n\nSince the conception of the Internet of things (IoT), a large number of promising applications and technologies have been developed, which will change different aspects in our daily life.

This study examines the prevalence of burnout among Younger Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and its relationship to demographic variables. In March 2008, a survey was sent via email to 1287 Younger Fellows. This included demographic questions, a measure of burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), and an estimate of social desirability (Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale - Form C). Females exhibited higher levels of personal burnout (P < 0.001) and work-related burnout (P < 0.025), but no significant difference in patient-related burnout. Younger Fellows in hospitals with less than 50 beds reported significantly higher patient-related burnout levels (mean burnout 37.0 versus 22.1 in the rest, P = 0.004). An equal work division between public and private practice resulted in higher work-related burnout than concentration of work in one sector (P < 0.05). Younger Fellows working more than 60 hours per week reported significantly higher personal burnout than those who worked less than this (P < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between age, country of practice, surgical specialty and any of the burnout subscales. Female surgeons, surgeons that work in smaller hospitals, those that work more than 60 h per week, and those with practice division between the private and public sectors, are at a particularly high risk of burnout. Further enquiry into potentially remediable causes for the increased burnout in these groups is indicated.\n\nRecruiting post-doctoral fellows into global health research: selecting NIH Fogarty International Clinical Research Fellows.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeimburger, Douglas C; Warner, Tokesha L; Carothers, Catherine Lem; Blevins, Meridith; Thomas, Yolanda; Gardner, Pierce; Primack, Aron; Vermund, Sten H\n\n2014-08-01\n\nFrom 2008 to 2012, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fogarty International Clinical Research Fellows Program (FICRF) provided 1-year mentored research training at low- and middle-income country sites for American and international post-doctoral health professionals. We examined the FICRF applicant pool, proposed research topics, selection process, and characteristics of enrollees to assess trends in global health research interest and factors associated with applicant competitiveness. The majority (58%) of 67 US and 57 international Fellows were women, and 83% of Fellows had medical degrees. Most applicants were in clinical fellowships (41%) or residencies (24%). More applicants proposing infectious disease projects were supported (59%) than applicants proposing non-communicable disease (NCD) projects (41%), although projects that combined both topic areas were most successful (69%). The numbers of applicants proposing research on NCDs and the numbers of these applicants awarded fellowships rose dramatically over time. Funding provided to the FICRF varied significantly among NIH Institutes and Centers and was strongly associated with the research topics awarded.

First-year (P1) through fourth-year (P4) pharmacy students, pharmacy residents, and pharmacy fellows participated in a newly implemented warfarin pharmacogenetics service in a hospital setting. Students, residents, and fellows provided genotype-guided dosing recommendations as part of clinical care, or analyzed samples and data collected from patients on the service for research purposes. Students', residents', and fellows' achievement of learning objectives was assessed using a checklist based on established core competencies in pharmacogenetics. The mean competency score of the students, residents, and fellows who completed a clinical and/or research experience with the service was 97% Â±3%. A comprehensive warfarin pharmacogenetics service provided unique experiential and research opportunities for pharmacy students, residents, and fellows and sufficiently addressed a number of core competencies in pharmacogenetics.\n\nRichard DeBlasio | NREL\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nEngineers (IEEE), a member of the IEEE Standards Board, and a member of the Board of Governors.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Leadership Fellows Program is a one-year program designed to train young orthopaedic surgeons to become future leaders in orthopaedics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the AAOS Leadership Fellows Program on the leadership skills and achievements of its participants. Graduates of the Leadership Fellows Program were compared with a control group of previous applicants who were not accepted to the program (applicants) in a retrospective cohort comparison study. A subjective survey of leadership skills was used to assess the confidence of the two cohorts in eight areas of leadership. In addition, an updated curriculum vitae from each of sixty leadership fellows from the classes of 2003 through 2009 and from each of forty-seven applicants was retrospectively reviewed for evidence of leadership. The updated curriculum vitae of the leadership fellows was evaluated for leadership activity attained prior to and following participation in the program, while the updated curriculum vitae of applicants was evaluated for leadership activity attained prior to and following the last year of application to the program. Curricula vitae were assessed for demonstration of national leadership, academic rank, hospital administrative rank, and research experience. On the leadership survey, the graduates of the Leadership Fellows Program scored higher than the applicants in seven of eight categories. The review of the curricula vitae demonstrated that, prior to the Leadership Fellows Program, the leadership fellows were more likely than the applicants to have an academic practice and hold an academic rank. The difference between the two cohorts in administrative rank and leadership of national committees was not significant. Following the program, the leadership fellows were more likely to chair national committees (p < 0\n\nNew IEEE standard enables data collection for medical applications.\n\nPubMed\n\nKennelly, R J; Wittenber, J\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe IEEE has gone to ballot on a \"Standard for Medical Device Communications\", IEEE P1073. The lower layer, hardware portions of the standard are expected to be approved by the IEEE Standards Board at their December 11-13, 1994 meeting. Other portions of the standard are in the initial stages of the IEEE ballot process. The intent of the standard is to allow hospitals and other users to interface medical electronic devices to host computer systems in a standard, interchangeable manner. The standard is optimized for acute care environments such as ICU's, operating rooms, and emergency rooms. [1] IEEE General Committee and Subcommittee work has been on-going since 1984. Significant amounts of work have been done to discover and meet the needs of the patient care setting. Surveys performed in 1989 identified the following four key user requirements for medical device communications: 1) Frequent reconfiguration of the network. 2) Allow \"plug and play\" operation by users. 3) Associate devices with a specific bed and patient. 4) Support a wide range of hospital computer system topologies. Additionally, the most critical difference in the acute care setting is patient safety, which has an overall effect on the standard. The standard that went to ballot meets these requirements. The standard is based on existing ISO standards. P1073 is compliant with the OSI seven layer model. P1073 specifies the entire communication stack, from object-oriented software to hospital unique connectors. The standard will be able to be put forward as a true international standard, much in the way that the IEEE 802.x family of standards (like Ethernet) were presented as draft ISO standards.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nEvaluation of satisfaction with work-life balance among U.S. Gynecologic Oncology fellows: A cross-sectional study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSzender, J Brian; Grzankowski, Kassondra S; Eng, Kevin H; Odunsi, Kunle; Frederick, Peter J\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTo characterize the state of satisfaction with work-life balance (WLB) among gynecologic oncology fellows in training, risk factors for dissatisfaction, and the impact of dissatisfaction on career plans. A cross-sectional evaluation of gynecologic oncology fellows was performed using a web-based survey. Demographic data, fellowship characteristics, and career plans were surveyed. The primary outcomes were satisfaction with WLB and career choices. pÂ <Â 0.05 was used as a test for significance. Regression analysis was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for various potential risk factors for dissatisfaction. Of 52.5% responding fellows, 22.2% were satisfied with WLB, but 83.3% would be physicians again and 80.3% would select gynecologic oncology again. Satisfaction with WLB was significantly associated with age (PRÂ =Â 0.70, 95% CI: 0.54-0.91), working fewer than 80Â h per week (PRÂ =Â 4.35, 95% CI: 1.34-14.10), and fatigue (PRÂ =Â 0.31, 95% CI: 0.12-0.75). Career and WLB satisfaction were not associated with gender, marital status, and whether or not the fellow is a parent. Those satisfied with WLB planned to work an average of 3.5Â years longer than those who were not (pÂ <Â 0.05). Gynecologic oncology fellows are not generally satisfied with their WLB, although this does not alter their overall career or specialty satisfaction. Satisfaction with WLB predicts a longer post-fellowship career. Further studies are needed to determine the workforce impact of this lack of perceived balance.\n\nResearch Fellows | NREL\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nyears and has contributed greatly to world-record efficiencies in various photovoltaic technologies is a world-renowned expert in the fields of multijunction PV, concentrator PV, and PV reliability Publications Photo of Mark O'Malley Mark O'Malley SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW Mark O'Malley is a world authority on\n\nClinical nutrition knowledge of gastroenterology fellows: is there anything omitted?\n\nPubMed\n\nEslamian, Ghazaleh; Jacobson, Kevan; Hekmatdoost, Azita\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDespite the increased emphasis on chronic non-communicable diseases, there are notable deficits about nutrition education in many medicine training programs particularly gastroenterology fellowship programs. In the present cross-sectional study, we examined the nutritional knowledge related to clinical nutrition among Iranian gastroenterology fellows. Thirty-six gastroenterology fellows currently enrolled in a gastroenterology fellowship program completed a questionnaire, including two sections. The first of which assessed the gastroenterology fellows experience about nutrition training, nutrition management of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and evaluating perceived nutrition education needs. The second section consisted of multiple choice questions that assessed nutritional knowledge. A total of 32 gastroenterology fellows completed the first section. The majority of gastroenterology fellows failed to partake in any nutrition education during their fellowship training particularly for inpatients despite the availability to participate in the nutrition training especially for the purpose of nutrition support. Mean correct response rates for the second section was 38%. The highest mean score was seen in nutrition assessment (48.1%), followed by scores of 40.5% in nutrition support, 37.0% nutrition in GI disease, and 25.0% in micro and macronutrients. Iranian gastroenterology fellows have serious deficits in their nutrition knowledge. This study paves the way for the development of an education program to improve nutritional knowledge of gastroenterology fellows.\n\nWhat I expect from an orthopaedic traumatology fellow.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee Chip Routt, Milton; Stark, Delbert H\n\n2014-09-01\n\nAfter 2.5 decades working with a variety of orthopaedic traumatology fellows, I have learned that several qualities and behaviors are important to a successful experience. Most fellows possess them, but some do not. Those that do usually integrate quickly onto the team and are rewarded with enriched teaching and clinical experiences. Some that do not may be able to adjust or alter their behaviors and eventually fit in. Some cannot adjust and their experiences suffer. I realize that no 2 individuals are the same, so my expectations of a fellow serve as a relationship foundation to then build their experiences upon. Their qualities and behaviors guide our relationship.\n\nAGU Sponsors Two Congressional Science Fellows\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChell, Kaitlin\n\n2010-06-01\n\nAGU will sponsor not one, but two Congressional Science Fellows (CSF) for the 2010-2011 fellowship term.

E.; Shirley, B.; Roark, M. F.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Outdoor Recreation, and Parks and Recreation programs at Utah State University (USU) have partnered to offer a new, unique river-based experiential learning opportunity for undergraduates called the Bear River Fellows Program. The program allows incoming freshmen Fellows to experience a river first hand during a 5-day/4-night river trip on the nearby Bear River two weeks before the start of their first Fall semester. As part of the program, Fellows will navigate the Bear River in canoes, camp along the banks, interact with local water and environmental managers, collect channel cross section, stream flow, vegetation cover, and topological complexity data, meet other incoming freshmen, interact with faculty and graduate students, develop boating and leadership skills, problem solve, and participate as full members of the trip team. Subsequently, Fellows will get paid as undergraduate researchers during their Fall and Spring Freshman semesters to analyze, synthesize, and present the field data they collect. The program is a collaborative effort between two USU academic units and the (non-academic) division of Student Services and supports a larger National Science Foundation funded environmental modelling and management project for the lower Bear River, Utah watershed. We have advertised the program via Facebook and emails to incoming USU freshmen, received 35 applications (60% women), and accepted 5 Fellows into the program (3 female and 2 male). The river trip departs August 14, 2012. The poster will overview the Bear River Fellows Program and present qualitative and preliminary outcomes emerging from the trip and Fellows' work through the Fall semester with the field data they collect. We will also undertake more rigorous and longer longitudinal quantitative evaluation of Program outcomes (for example, in problem-solving and leadership) both in Spring 2013 and in subsequent 2013 and 2014 offerings of the\n\nAn IEEE 1451.1 Architecture for ISHM Applications\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMorris, Jon A.; Turowski, Mark; Schmalzel, John L.; Figueroa, Jorge F.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe IEEE 1451.1 Standard for a Smart Transducer Interface defines a common network information model for connecting and managing smart elements in control and data acquisition networks using network-capable application processors (NCAPs). The Standard is a network-neutral design model that is easily ported across operating systems and physical networks for implementing complex acquisition and control applications by simply plugging in the appropriate network level drivers. To simplify configuration and tracking of transducer and actuator details, the family of 1451 standards defines a Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) that is associated with each physical element. The TEDS contains all of the pertinent information about the physical operations of a transducer (such as operating regions, calibration tables, and manufacturer information), which the NCAP uses to configure the system to support a specific transducer. The Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) group at NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC) has been developing an ISHM architecture that utilizes IEEE 1451.1 as the primary configuration and data acquisition mechanism for managing and collecting information from a network of distributed intelligent sensing elements. This work has involved collaboration with other NASA centers, universities and aerospace industries to develop IEEE 1451.1 compliant sensors and interfaces tailored to support health assessment of complex systems. This paper and presentation describe the development and implementation of an interface for the configuration, management and communication of data, information and knowledge generated by a distributed system of IEEE 1451.1 intelligent elements monitoring a rocket engine test system. In this context, an intelligent element is defined as one incorporating support for the IEEE 1451.x standards and additional ISHM functions.

To utilize a comprehensive, pharmacist-led warfarin pharmacogenetics service to provide pharmacy students, residents, and fellows with clinical and research experiences involving genotype-guided therapy. Design. First-year (P1) through fourth-year (P4) pharmacy students, pharmacy residents, and pharmacy fellows participated in a newly implemented warfarin pharmacogenetics service in a hospital setting. Students, residents, and fellows provided genotype-guided dosing recommendations as part of clinical care, or analyzed samples and data collected from patients on the service for research purposes. Assessment. Studentsâ, residentsâ, and fellowsâ achievement of learning objectives was assessed using a checklist based on established core competencies in pharmacogenetics. The mean competency score of the students, residents, and fellows who completed a clinical and/or research experience with the service was 97% Â±3%. Conclusion. A comprehensive warfarin pharmacogenetics service provided unique experiential and research opportunities for pharmacy students, residents, and fellows and sufficiently addressed a number of core competencies in pharmacogenetics.

We conducted a focus group study of internal medicine (IM) residents and subspecialty fellows to determine barriers against and factors facilitating resident-fellow teaching interactions on the wards, and to identify opportunities for maximising teaching and learning. We conducted four focus groups of IM residents (nÂ =Â 18) and IM subspecialty fellows (nÂ =Â 16) at two academic medical centres in the USA during February and March 2013. Participants represented trainees in all 3Â years of residency training and seven IM subspecialties. Four investigators analysed the transcripts using a structured qualitative framework approach, which was informed by literature on consultation and the theoretical framework of activity theory. We identified two domains of barriers and facilitating factors: personal and systems-based. Sub-themes in the personal domain included fellows' perceived resistance to consultations, residents' willingness to engage in teaching interactions, and perceptions and expectations. Sub-themes in the systems-based domain included the process of requesting the consult, the quality of the consult request, primary team structure, familiarity between residents and fellows, workload, work experience, culture of subspecialty divisions, and fellows' teaching skills. These barriers differentially affected the two stages of the consult identified in the focus groups (initial interaction and follow-up interaction). Residents and fellows want to engage in positive teaching interactions in the context of the clinical consult; however, multiple barriers influence both parties in the hospital environment. Many of these barriers are amenable to change. Interventions aimed at reducing barriers to teaching in the setting of consultation hold promise\n\nJack Colby Continues Stellar Legacy of APPA Fellows\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nThaler-Carter, Ruth E.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis article profiles 2011 APPA Fellow Jack K.

We highlight the strengths and weaknesses in the current system of accredited training. Data were collected from program directors, the ACGME, and the ABTS. In addition, surveys were sent to training program graduates. Topics included program accreditation status, number of fellows trained per year and per program, match results, fellow operative experience, fellow satisfaction, and post-fellowship employment status. There are twelve active accredited fellowship programs, and 44 trainees have completed accredited training. Each active program has trained a median of 3 fellows (range: 0-7). Operative logs were obtained from 38 of 44 (86%) graduates. The median number of total cases (minimum 75) was 136 (range: 75-236). For complex neonates (minimum 5), the median number of cases was 6 (range: 2-17). Some fellows failed to meet the minimum requirements. Thirty-six (82%) graduates responded to the survey; most were satisfied with their overall operative experience, but less with their neonatal operative experience. Of this total, 84% are currently practicing congenital cardiac surgery, and 74% secured jobs prior to completing their residency. Since 2007, congenital cardiac surgery training has been accredited by the ACGME. In general, the training is uniform, the operative experience is robust, and the fellows are satisfied. Although shortcomings remain, this study highlights the many strengths of the current system. Copyright Â© 2016 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

To evaluate the delivery of endoscopy training to French GI fellows and perception of learning. A nationwide electronic survey was carried out of French GI fellows using an anonymous, 17-item electronic questionnaire. A total of 291 out of 484 (60%) GI fellows responded to the survey. Only 40% of subjects had access to theoretical training and/or virtual simulators. Only 49% and 35% of fourth year fellows had reached the threshold numbers of EGD and colonoscopies recommended by the European section and Board of gastroenterology and hepatology. Sixty-two percent and 57% of trainees reported having insufficient knowledge in interpreting gastric and colic lesions. Access to dedicated endoscopy activity for at least 8Â weeks during the year was the only independent factor associated with the achievement of the recommended annual threshold number of procedures. The access of fellows to theoretical training and to preclinical virtual simulators is still insufficient. Personalized support and regular assessment of cognitive and technical acquisition over the 4Â years of training seems to be necessary. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although the importance of communication skills is widely recognized, formal curricula for teaching communication skills to geriatric and palliative medicine fellows is often inadequate or unavailable. The current study drew upon the educational principles and format of an evidence-based, interactive teaching method to develop an intensive communication skills training course designed specifically to address the common communication challenges that geriatric and palliative medicine fellows face. The 2-day retreat, held away from the hospital environment, included large-group overview presentations, small-group communication skills practice, and development of future skills practice commitment. Faculty received in-depth training in small-group facilitation techniques before the course. Geriatric and palliative medicine fellows were recruited to participate in the course and 100% (nÂ =Â 18) enrolled. Overall satisfaction with the course was very high (mean 4.8 on a 5-point scale). After the course, fellows reported an increase in self-assessed preparedness for specific communication challenges (mean increase 1.4 on 5-point scale, PÂ <Â .001). Two months after the course, fellows reported a high level of sustained skills practice (mean 4.3 on 5-point scale). In sum, the intensive communication skills program, customized for the specific needs of geriatric and palliative medicine fellows, improved fellows' self-assessed preparedness for challenging communication tasks and provided a model for ongoing deliberate practice of communication skills.

Clinical fellows were integrated into the clinical embryology team and were trained to perform all the various procedures utilized in clinical embryology. The fellows were trained to the same standards as the clinical embryology staff and underwent the same certification and sign off procedures. To determine if inclusion of clinical fellows on the embryology team impacted outcomes, outcomes for individual oocytes/embryos and the clinical cases where the fellows perform embryology procedures were compared to the outcomes of those oocytes/embryos and cases performed by the full time embryology staff. Clinical procedures performed by the fellows included isolation and processing of oocytes following retrieval, loading catheters for embryo transfer, and vitrification (Nâ=â823 cases). Micromanipulation procedures compared included ICSI and assisted hatching (Nâ=â650 cases). For each procedure, the outcomes in those cases performed by the RE fellows were equivalent to those done by the fully trained clinical embryology staff. When fellows are trained to perform embryology procedures as an integral part of their fellowship curricula, laboratory efficiencies and clinical outcomes are fully maintained. This experience provides valuable insight into the ART process critical to this subspecialty. It also empowers fellows to fully participate in research relating to the viability of gamete and embryos and optimization of the clinical ART laboratory.\n\nDo Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (PHO) Fellows Receive Communication Training?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFile, Wilson; Bylund, Carma L.; Kesselheim, Jennifer; Leonard, David; Leavey, Patrick\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPurpose The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has established communication as a core competency for physicians in training. However, data suggest that most pediatric residents perceive inadequate training in the delivery of bad news and the majority of former trainees in pediatric oncology received no formal training in the delivery of bad news during fellowship. The study examines communication training in ACGME accredited US pediatric hematology-oncology (PHO) fellowship programs. Methods An online survey was distributed to 315 PHO fellows in training via the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO) fellow email registry. Each fellow received an initial request to participate and 2 reminders, while participation was encouraged through a random incentive drawing. Results One hundred and ten fellows (35%) responded. Eighty percent of respondents perceived communication training to be important to fellow education, however only 32% reported receiving communication training (other than direct observation). The most common reported teaching method of fellowship communication training was formal lecture (42%). Twenty-three percent of respondents reported neither communication training nor frequent feedback on their communication skills from faculty observation. This same group was the least satisfied with their programsâ approach to teaching communication (P < 0.001). Conclusions There is limited communication training in PHO fellowships despite ACGME requirements and fellowsâ interest in this training. Didactic learning remains the most frequently described training method, yet educational theory identifies the limitation of didactic lectures alone. Communication training employing novel teaching methods and emphasizing communication challenges identified by fellows should be developed and evaluated.

To assess 1) levels of burnout, perceived stress, and quality of life in critical care fellows, and 2) the impact of a brief stress management training on these outcomes. In a tertiary care academic medical center, 58 critical care fellows of varying subspecialties and training levels were surveyed to assess baseline levels of stress and burnout. Twenty-one of the 58 critical care fellows who were in the first year of training at the time of this initial survey participated in a pre-test and 1-year post-test to determine the effects of a brief, 90-min stress management intervention. Based on responses (n=58) to the abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory, reported burnout was significantly lower in Asian fellows (p=0.04) and substantially higher among graduating fellows (versus new and transitioning fellows) (p=0.02). Among the intervention cohort, burnout did not significantly improve--though two-thirds of fellows reported using the interventional techniques to deal with stressful situations. Fellows who participated in the intervention rated the effectiveness of the course as 4 (IQR=3.75-5) using the 5-point Likert scale. In comparison with the new and transitioning trainees, burnout was highest among graduating critical care fellows. Although no significant improvements were found in first-year fellows' burnout scores following the single, 90-min training intervention, participants felt the training did provide them with tools to apply during stressful situations.\n\nThe Critical Care Communication project: improving fellows' communication skills.\n\nPubMed\n\nArnold, Robert M; Back, Anthony L; Barnato, Amber E; Prendergast, Thomas J; Emlet, Lillian L; Karpov, Irina; White, Patrick H; Nelson, Judith E\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to develop an evidence-based communication skills training workshop to improve the communication skills of critical care fellows. Pulmonary and critical care fellows (N = 38) participated in a 3-day communication skills workshop between 2008 and 2010 involving brief didactic talks, faculty demonstration of skills, and faculty-supervised small group skills practice sessions with simulated families. Skills included the following: giving bad news, achieving consensus on goals of therapy, and discussing the limitations of life-sustaining treatment. Participants rated their skill levels in a pre-post survey in 11 core communication tasks using a 5-point Likert scale. Of 38 fellows, 36 (95%) completed all 3 days of the workshop. We compared pre and post scores using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Overall, self-rated skills increased for all 11 tasks. In analyses by participant, 95% reported improvement in at least 1 skill; with improvement in a median of 10 of 11 skills. Ninety-two percent rated the course as either very good/excellent, and 80% recommended that it be mandatory for future fellows. This 3-day communication skills training program increased critical care fellows' self-reported family meeting communication skills. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Because of the overhead, an upper limit exists for throughput, which is bounded, including situations where data rates are extremely high. Therefore, an overhead reduction is necessary to achieve higher throughput. The IEEE 802.11e amendment introduced the block ACK mechanism, to reduce the number of control messages in MAC. Although the block ACK scheme greatly reduces overhead, further improvements are possible. In this letter, we propose an implicit block ACK method that further reduces the overhead associated with IEEE 802.11eâs block ACK scheme. The mathematical analysis results are presented for both the original protocol and the proposed scheme. A performance improvement of greater than 10% was achieved with the proposed implementation.\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow | Center for Cancer Research\n\nCancer.gov\n\nHighly motivated postdoctoral fellows sought to work on tumor immunology with a strong background in biology preferentially cellular immunology.

An anonymous, online survey was sent to FPMRS fellows in March 2012. All fellows at accredited and nonaccredited U.S. FPMRS programs were eligible. Of at least 123 fellows, 58 (47%) completed the survey and met inclusion criteria. Survey questions included demographics, GH interest and experience, barriers to GH experience, and career goals. Of those 58 fellows, 79% of respondents graduated from Ob-Gyn residencies, 41% were first year fellows, 45% spoke another language fluently, and 62% had previously worked and/or studied in a developing country. Of the respondents 74% desired GH experience during fellowship, 78% desired GH experience after fellowship, and 40% reported seeing themselves integrating GH into their career. Top barriers to GH work in fellowship were lack of elective time (74%), cost (70%), and personal commitments (67%). A total of 39% of respondents said the ability to work in GH somewhat or strongly affected their decision to pursue FPMRS, and 26% said the availability of GH opportunities affected their fellowship rank list. Family (88%), clinical commitments (78%), and cost (67%) were the biggest reported hurdles to future GH work. Nearly three-quarters of FPMRS fellows are interested in GH work in fellowship. Almost half would like to include it in future practice. Barriers in fellowship include elective time, cost, and personal commitments.\n\nGeritalk: Communication Skills Training for Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine Fellows\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKelley, Amy S.; Back, Anthony L.; Arnold, Robert M.; Goldberg, Gabrielle R.; Lim, Betty B.; Litrivis, Evgenia; Smith, Cardinale B.; OâNeill, Lynn B.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nExpert communication is essential to high quality care for older patients with serious illness.

The intent was to ensure medical knowledge in relevant content areas that may not be addressed through clinical rotations, such as operationally relevant infectious disease. After completion, it was discussed in a small group with faculty. Over time, faculty noted increasing dissatisfaction with the activity. Spaced interval education is useful in retention of medical knowledge and skills by medical students and residents. Its use in infectious disease fellow education has not been described. To improve the quiz experience, we assessed the introduction of spaced education curriculum in our program. A pre-intervention survey was distributed to assess the monthly quiz with Likert scale and open-ended questions. A multiple-choice question spaced education curriculum was created using the Qstream(R) platform in 2011. Faculty development on question writing was conducted. Two questions were delivered every 2 d. Incorrectly and correctly answered questions were repeated after 7 and 13 d, respectively. Questions needed to be answered correctly twice to be retired. Fellow satisfaction was assessed at semi-annual fellowship reviews over 5 yr and by a one-time repeat survey. Pre-intervention survey of six fellows indicated dissatisfaction with the time commitment of the monthly quiz (median Likert score of 2, mean 6.5 h to complete), neutral in perceived utility, but satisfaction with knowledge retention (Likert score 4). Eighteen fellows over 5 yr participated in the spaced education curriculum. Three quizzes with 20, 39, and 48 questions were designed. Seventeen percentage of questions addressed operationally relevant topics. Fifty-nine percentage of questions were answered correctly on first attempt, improving to 93% correct answer rate at the end of the analysis.
