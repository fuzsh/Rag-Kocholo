        "text": "ABSTRACT The present study deals with the distribution of subject properties in ‘formulaic’ presentational constructions such as Engl. there is NP, Fr. il y’a NP and Span. hay NP, approaching the problem from a diachronic-typological perspective. Nine major types of presentational constructions are distinguished by cross-classifying the three-valued parameters ‘type of existential predicate’ and ‘type of expletive’. Moreover, a language-level parameter is introduced which distinguishes languages allowing verb-initial order in thetic sentences (‘thetic-V1 languages’) from languages disallowing such an order (‘thetic-XV languages’). It is shown that thetic-XV languages tend to use expletives in their existential formulas, which attract subject properties and qualify as impersonal. By contrast, thetic-V1 languages often do not use expletives at all, and if they do, these do not attract subject properties. The corresponding constructions are consequently not impersonal. Accordingly, a correlation can be established between the parameters ‘thetic-XV’ vs. ‘thetic-V1’, on the one hand, and ‘impersonal presentational’ vs. ‘personal presentational’, on the other.\n\nThis paper aims to point out a linguistic phenomenon that due to the current stage of research can be analysed only insufficiently with the help of an electronic text corpus. In this way, the paper adds a new aspect to the discussion about historical corpora by tackling the question of how they should be designed in order to be useful for linguistic research on so‐called formulaic patterns. The novelty of the question becomes apparent considering the fact that at present such historical corpora do not exist. In section 1, we define the term formulaic pattern because a clear understanding of this phenomenon is a prerequisite condition for collaborative research of it by historians of language and corpus and computer linguists. Section 2 gives a brief outline of the state of the art in the field of modern formulaic language within the framework of corpus and computer linguistics. Section 3 shows that some well known problems in this area are exacerbated when applied to historical texts. Section 4 presents a possible solution that has been implemented by the HiFoS Researchers' Group at the University of Trier (Germany). Joint research efforts planned with UKP Lab at the TU Darmstadt (section 5) demonstrate that the restrictions posed by historical formulaic patterns are challenges to be overcome, rather than insurmountable obstacles.\n\nMany applied and corpus linguists entertain the idea of collocations, and other types of formulaic language, being processed as unanalysed, or holistic units. It has, indeed, been demonstrated that, due to their frequency and predictability, formulaic sequences are processed quantitatively faster than matched novel phrases. This finding implies an important role of phrasal frequency in language processing and highlights the contribution of entrenchment of a particular phrasal configuration in memory. This finding, however, cannot be taken to suggest that formulaic sequences are necessarily processed as unanalysed, or holistic units. The present paper reviews some of the recent studies and explains why a processing advantage observed for formulaic sequences over novel phrases should not be equated with holistic storage and processing."
