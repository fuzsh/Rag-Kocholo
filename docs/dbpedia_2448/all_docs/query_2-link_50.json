        "text": "Improving Patient Safety through Simulation Training in Anesthesiology: Where Are We?\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThere have been colossal technological advances in the use of simulation in anesthesiology in the past 2 decades. Over the years, the use of simulation has gone from low fidelity to high fidelity models that mimic human responses in a startlingly realistic manner, extremely life-like mannequin that breathes, generates E.K.G, and has pulses, heart sounds, and an airway that can be programmed for different degrees of obstruction. Simulation in anesthesiology is no longer a research fascination but an integral part of resident education and one of ACGME requirements for resident graduation. Simulation training has been objectively shown to increase the skill-set of anesthesiologists. Anesthesiology is leading the movement in patient safety. It is rational to assume a relationship between simulation training and patient safety. Nevertheless there has not been a demonstrable improvement in patient outcomes with simulation training. Larger prospective studies that evaluate the improvement in patient outcomes are needed to justify the integration of simulation training in resident education but ample number of studies in the past 5 years do show a definite benefit of using simulation in anesthesiology training. This paper gives a brief overview of the history and evolution of use of simulation in anesthesiology and highlights some of the more recent studies that have advanced simulation-based training. PMID:26949389\n\nA simulation-based training program improves emergency department staff communication.\n\nPubMed\n\nSweeney, Lynn A; Warren, Otis; Gardner, Liz; Rojek, Adam; Lindquist, David G\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe objectives of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of Project CLEAR!, a novel simulation-based training program designed to instill Crew Resource Management (CRM) as the communication standard and to create a service-focused environment in the emergency department (ED) by standardizing the patient encounter. A survey-based study compared physicians' and nurses' perceptions of the quality of communication before and after the training program. Surveys were developed to measure ED staff perceptions of the quality of communication between staff members and with patients. Pretraining and posttraining survey results were compared. After the training program, survey scores improved significantly on questions that asked participants to rate the overall communication between staff members and between staff and patients. A simulation-based training program focusing on CRM and standardizing the patient encounter improves communication in the ED, both between staff members and between staff members and patients.\n\nLaparoscopic skill improvement after virtual reality simulator training in medical students as assessed by augmented reality simulator.\n\nPubMed\n\nNomura, Tsutomu; Mamada, Yasuhiro; Nakamura, Yoshiharu; Matsutani, Takeshi; Hagiwara, Nobutoshi; Fujita, Isturo; Mizuguchi, Yoshiaki; Fujikura, Terumichi; Miyashita, Masao; Uchida, Eiji\n\n2015-11-01\n\nDefinitive assessment of laparoscopic skill improvement after virtual reality simulator training is best obtained during an actual operation. However, this is impossible in medical students. Therefore, we developed an alternative assessment technique using an augmented reality simulator. Nineteen medical students completed a 6-week training program using a virtual reality simulator (LapSim). The pretest and post-test were performed using an object-positioning module and cholecystectomy on an augmented reality simulator(ProMIS). The mean performance measures between pre- and post-training on the LapSim were compared with a paired t-test. In the object-positioning module, the execution time of the task (Pâ<â0.001), left and right instrument path length (Pâ=â0.001), and left and right instrument economy of movement (Pâ<â0.001) were significantly shorter after than before the LapSim training. With respect to improvement in laparoscopic cholecystectomy using a gallbladder model, the execution time to identify, clip, and cut the cystic duct and cystic artery as well as the execution time to dissect the gallbladder away from the liver bed were both significantly shorter after than before the LapSim training (Pâ=â0.01). Our training curriculum using a virtual reality simulator improved the operative skills of medical students as objectively evaluated by assessment using an augmented reality simulator instead of an actual operation. We hope that these findings help to establish an effective training program for medical students.

ARTT has been shown to improve transfer to the criterion task in some military simulation experiments. We tested training speed and screen resolution in a project, sponsored by Defence Research and Development Canada, to develop components for prototype air mission simulators. For this study, 54 participants used a single-screen PC-based flight simulation program to learn to chase and catch an F-18A fighter jet with another F-18A while controlling the chase aircraft with a throttle and side-stick controller. Screen resolution was varied between participants, and training speed was varied factorially across two sessions within participants. Pretest and posttest trials were at high resolution and criterion (900 knots) speed. Posttest performance was best with high screen resolution training and when one ARTT training session was followed by a session of criterion speed training. ARTT followed by criterion training improves performance on a visual-motor coordination task. We think that ARTT influences known facilitators of transfer, including similarity to the criterion task and contextual interference. Use high-screen resolution, start with ARTT, and finish with criterion speed training when preparing a mission simulation.\n\nMultidisciplinary In Situ Simulation-Based Training as a Postpartum Hemorrhage Quality Improvement Project.\n\nPubMed\n\nLutgendorf, Monica A; Spalding, Carmen; Drake, Elizabeth; Spence, Dennis; Heaton, Jason O; Morocco, Kristina V\n\n2017-03-01\n\nPostpartum hemorrhage is a common obstetric emergency affecting 3 to 5% of deliveries, with significant maternal morbidity and mortality. Effective management of postpartum hemorrhage requires strong teamwork and collaboration. We completed a multidisciplinary in situ postpartum hemorrhage simulation training exercise with structured team debriefing to evaluate hospital protocols, team performance, operational readiness, and real-time identification of system improvements. Our objective was to assess participant comfort with managing obstetric hemorrhage following our multidisciplinary in situ simulation training exercise. This was a quality improvement project that utilized a comprehensive multidisciplinary in situ postpartum hemorrhage simulation exercise. Participants from the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Anesthesia, Nursing, Pediatrics, and Transfusion Services completed the training exercise in 16 scenarios run over 2 days. The intervention was a high fidelity, multidisciplinary in situ simulation training to evaluate hospital protocols, team performance, operational readiness, and system improvements. Structured debriefing was conducted with the participants to discuss communication and team functioning. Our main outcome measure was participant self-reported comfort levels for managing postpartum hemorrhage before and after simulation training. A 5-point Likert scale (1 being very uncomfortable and 5 being very comfortable) was used to measure participant comfort. A paired t test was used to assess differences in participant responses before and after the simulation exercise. We also measured the time to prepare simulated blood products and followed the number of postpartum hemorrhage cases before and after the simulation exercise. We trained 113 health care professionals including obstetricians, midwives, residents, anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists, nurses, and medical assistants. Participants reported a higher comfort level in managing\n\nSimulator training to automaticity leads to improved skill transfer compared with traditional proficiency-based training: a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nStefanidis, Dimitrios; Scerbo, Mark W; Montero, Paul N; Acker, Christina E; Smith, Warren D\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe hypothesized that novices will perform better in the operating room after simulator training to automaticity compared with traditional proficiency based training (current standard training paradigm). Simulator-acquired skill translates to the operating room, but the skill transfer is incomplete. Secondary task metrics reflect the ability of trainees to multitask (automaticity) and may improve performance assessment on simulators and skill transfer by indicating when learning is complete. Novices (N = 30) were enrolled in an IRB-approved, blinded, randomized, controlled trial. Participants were randomized into an intervention (n = 20) and a control (n = 10) group. The intervention group practiced on the FLS suturing task until they achieved expert levels of time and errors (proficiency), were tested on a live porcine fundoplication model, continued simulator training until they achieved expert levels on a visual spatial secondary task (automaticity) and were retested on the operating room (OR) model. The control group participated only during testing sessions. Performance scores were compared within and between groups during testing sessions. : Intervention group participants achieved proficiency after 54 Â± 14 and automaticity after additional 109 Â± 57 repetitions. Participants achieved better scores in the OR after automaticity training [345 (range, 0-537)] compared with after proficiency-based training [220 (range, 0-452; P < 0.001]. Simulator training to automaticity takes more time but is superior to proficiency-based training, as it leads to improved skill acquisition and transfer. Secondary task metrics that reflect trainee automaticity should be implemented during simulator training to improve learning and skill transfer.\n\nSnowplow Simulator Training Study\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis report evaluates simulation training of IDOT snowplow operators to improve IDOT snow and ice removal : operations.

Two types of curricula were evaluated for educational efficacy in this prospective randomized controlled trial. Psychiatry residents (n = 35) completed surveys to ascertain their baseline experience, knowledge, and proficiency with the ECT procedure. They were then block-randomized to receive either a didactic ECT curriculum (non-SIM) or one augmented by simulation training (SIM). Three months post-completion of the two types of instruction, all residents were re-administered the surveys and a procedural post-assessment. The median number of ECTs performed prior to the study was similar between the two groups (SIM group = 3, non-SIM group = 4.) The SIM group showed significant improvement on pre- and post- survey theoretical knowledge scores: 51% (95% CI = 41 to 61%) and 69% (95% CI = 64 to 74%), respectively, p = .02; this difference was not significant in the non-SIM group, p = .2. Improvement between pre- and post- proficiency scores were seen in the SIM group: 22% (95% CI = 13 to 32%) and 51% (95% CI = 53 to 59%), p < .001 while the effect was less pronounced in the non-SIM group. Inter-rater agreement for the proficiency assessment was excellent: k, = .9. Residents showed significant improvement in knowledge, comfort, and skills following ECT simulation training. With the proposed curriculum, residents would receive comprehensive education not only in the theory behind ECT but also in procedural skills. This curriculum can be modeled in other programs that do not have extensive ECT facilities.\n\nStructured box training improves stability of retraction while multitasking in colorectal surgery simulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nKobiela, Jarek; Spychalski, Piotr; Åaski, Dariusz; BÅaÅ¼yÅska-Spychalska, Agata; ÅachiÅski, Andrzej J; ÅledziÅski, Zbigniew; Hull, Tracy\n\n2018-09-01\n\nLaparoscopic colorectal surgery has an established role. The ability to multitask (use a retraction tool with one hand and navigate a laparoscopic camera with the other) is desired for efficient laparoscopic surgery. Surgical trainees must learn this skill to perform advanced laparoscopic tasks. The aim was to determine whether a box-training protocol improves the stability of retraction while multitasking in colorectal surgery simulation. Fifty-eight medical students were recruited to attend a basic laparoscopic box-training course. Ability to perform steady retraction with and without multitasking was measured initially and at the conclusion of the course. Before training, students demonstrated a decrease in performance while multitasking with a greater maximal exerted force, a greater range of force, and a greater standard deviation for traction and minimal exerted force, range of force and a greater standard deviation for countertraction. Statistically significant improvement (lower maximal exerted force and lower range of force) was observed for traction while multitasking after training. After the training, no statistically significant differences were found when the student performed a single task versus multitasking, both for traction and countertraction. A structured box-training curriculum improved the stability of retraction while multitasking in this colorectal surgery simulation. Although it did not improve stability of retraction as a single task, it did improve stability of retraction while multitasking. After training, this enables the trainee to retract as efficiently while operating the camera as they retract when only focusing on retraction as a single task. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Simulation training is an effective tool for preparing providers for high-stakes, low-frequency events. Debriefing is a learner-centered approach that affords reflection on one's performance, and increases the efficacy of simulation training. The purpose of this study was to measure the efficacy of a multiple-victim simulation in facilitating learners' acquisition of pediatric disaster medicine (PDM) skills, including the JumpSTART triage algorithm. It was hypothesized that multiple patient simulations and a structured debriefing would improve triage performance. A 10-victim school-shooting scenario was created. Victims were portrayed by adult volunteers, and by high- and low-fidelity simulation manikins that responded physiologically to airway maneuvers. Learners were pediatrics residents. Expected triage levels were not revealed. After a didactic session, learners completed the first simulation. Learners assigned triage levels to all victims, and recorded responses on a standardized form. A group structured debriefing followed the first simulation. The debriefing allowed learners to review the victims and discuss triage rationale. A new 10-victim trauma disaster scenario was presented one week later, and a third scenario was presented five months later. During the second and third scenarios, learners again assigned triage levels to multiple victims. Wilcoxon sign rank tests were used to compare pre- and post-test scores and performance on pre- and post-debriefing simulations. A total of 53 learners completed the educational intervention. Initial mean triage performance was 6.9/10 patients accurately triaged (range = 5-10, SD = 1.3); one week after the structured debriefing, the mean triage performance improved to 8.0/10 patients (range = 5-10, SD = 1.37, P < .0001\n\nTwo Hours of Teamwork Training Improves Teamwork in Simulated Cardiopulmonary Arrest Events.\n\nPubMed\n\nMahramus, Tara L; Penoyer, Daleen A; Waterval, Eugene M E; Sole, Mary L; Bowe, Eileen M\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTeamwork during cardiopulmonary arrest events is important for resuscitation. Teamwork improvement programs are usually lengthy. This study assessed the effectiveness of a 2-hour teamwork training program. A prospective, pretest/posttest, quasi-experimental design assessed the teamwork training program targeted to resident physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists. Participants took part in a simulated cardiac arrest. After the simulation, participants and trained observers assessed perceptions of teamwork using the Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM) tool (ratings of 0 [low] to 4 [high]). A debriefing and 45 minutes of teamwork education followed. Participants then took part in a second simulated cardiac arrest scenario. Afterward, participants and observers assessed teamwork. Seventy-three team members participated-resident physicians (25%), registered nurses (32%), and respiratory therapists (41%). The physicians had significantly less experience on code teams (P < .001). Baseline teamwork scores were 2.57 to 2.72. Participants' mean (SD) scores on the TEAM tool for the first and second simulations were 3.2 (0.5) and 3.7 (0.4), respectively (P < .001). Observers' mean (SD) TEAM scores for the first and second simulations were 3.0 (0.5) and 3.7 (0.3), respectively (P < .001). Program evaluations by participants were positive. A 2-hour simulation-based teamwork educational intervention resulted in improved perceptions of teamwork behaviors. Participants reported interactions with other disciplines, teamwork behavior education, and debriefing sessions were beneficial for enhancing the program.\n\nArthroscopic Training Courses Improve Trainee Arthroscopy Skills: A Simulation-Based Prospective Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartin, Kevin D; Patterson, David P; Cameron, Kenneth L\n\n2016-11-01\n\nTo evaluate the correlation between timed task performance on an arthroscopy shoulder simulator and participation in a standardized expert shoulder arthroscopy educational course. Orthopaedic trainees were voluntarily recruited from over 25 residency programs throughout the United States and Canada. Each trainee was tested on arrival at the Arthroscopy Association of North America orthopaedic learning center on a virtual reality arthroscopy shoulder simulator, and his or her performance was objectively scored. Each trainee's postgraduate year level was recorded, as was his or her experience in residency with shoulder arthroscopy as measured by Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case-log totals. After the focused 4-day training curriculum consisting of didactics and cadaveric experience, each trainee was re-evaluated on the same simulator. Statistical analysis was performed to determine if participation in the course was associated with changes in simulation performance from before to after assessment. Forty-eight trainees completed the testing. On completion of the course, trainees showed significant improvements in all objective measures recorded by the simulator. Total probe distance needed to complete the task decreased by 42% (from 420.4Â mm to 245.3Â mm, P < .001), arthroscope tip distance traveled decreased by 59% (from 194.1Â mm to 80.2Â mm, P < .001), and time to completion decreased by 38% (from 66.8Â seconds to 41.6Â seconds, P < .001). Highly significant improvements in all 3 measures suggest improved instrument handling, anatomic recognition, and arthroscopy-related visual-spatial ability. This study shows objective improvement in orthopaedic trainee basic arthroscopy skill and proficiency after a standardized 4-day arthroscopy training curriculum. The results validate the Arthroscopy Association of North America resident training course and its curriculum with objective evidence of benefit. Level III, prospective study of\n\nSimulator training and non-technical factors improve laparoscopic performance among OBGYN trainees.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhlborg, Liv; Hedman, Leif; Nisell, Henry; FellÃ¤nder-Tsai, Li; Enochsson, Lars\n\n2013-10-01\n\nTo investigate how simulator training and non-technical factors affect laparoscopic performance among residents in obstetrics and gynecology. In this prospective study, trainees were randomized into three groups. The first group was allocated to proficiency-based training in the LapSimGyn(Â®) virtual reality simulator. The second group received additional structured mentorship during subsequent laparoscopies. The third group served as control group. At baseline an operation was performed and visuospatial ability, flow and self-efficacy were assessed. All groups subsequently performed three tubal occlusions. Self-efficacy and flow were assessed before and/or after each operation. Simulator training was conducted at the Center for Advanced Medical Simulation and Training, Karolinska University Hospital. Sterilizations were performed at each trainee's home clinic. Twenty-eight trainees/residents from 21 hospitals in Sweden were included. Visuospatial ability was tested by the Mental Rotation Test-A. Flow and self-efficacy were assessed by validated scales and questionnaires. Laparoscopic performance was measured as the duration of surgery. Visuospatial ability, self-efficacy and flow were correlated to the laparoscopic performance using Spearman's correlations. Differences between groups were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U-test. No differences across groups were detected at baseline. Self-efficacy scores before and flow scores after the third operation were significantly higher in the trained groups. Duration of surgery was significantly shorter in the trained groups. Flow and self-efficacy correlate positively with laparoscopic performance. Simulator training and non-technical factors appear to improve the laparoscopic performance among trainees/residents in obstetrics and gynecology.

This concept is applied to numerous flight projects such as the F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV), the F-15 Intelligent Flight Control System (IFCS), the X-38 Actuator Control Test (XACT), and X-43A (Hyper-X). The Dryden 6-DOF simulations are typically used through various stages of a project, from design to ground tests. The roles of these simulations have expanded to support control room training, reinforcing flight safety by building control room staff proficiency. Real-time telemetry, radar, and video data are generated from flight vehicle simulation models. These data are used to drive the control room displays. Nominal static values are used to complete information where appropriate. Audio communication is also an integral part of training sessions. This simulation capability is used to train control room personnel and flight crew for nominal missions and emergency situations. Such training sessions are also opportunities to refine flight cards and control room display pages, exercise emergency procedures, and practice control room setup for the day of flight. This paper describes this technology as it is used in the X-43A and F-15 IFCS and XACT projects.\n\nShoulder Arthroscopy Simulator Training Improves Shoulder Arthroscopy Performance in a Cadaver Model\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHenn, R. Frank; Shah, Neel; Warner, Jon J.P.; Gomoll, Andreas H.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPurpose The purpose of this study was to quantify the benefits of shoulder arthroscopy simulator training with a cadaver model of shoulder arthroscopy. Methods Seventeen first year medical students with no prior experience in shoulder arthroscopy were enrolled and completed this study. Each subject completed a baseline proctored arthroscopy on a cadaveric shoulder, which included controlling the camera and completing a standard series of tasks using the probe. The subjects were randomized, and nine of the subjects received training on a virtual reality simulator for shoulder arthroscopy. All subjects then repeated the same cadaveric arthroscopy. The arthroscopic videos were analyzed in a blinded fashion for time to task completion and subjective assessment of technical performance. The two groups were compared with students t-tests, and change over time within groups was analyzed with paired t-tests. Results There were no observed differences between the two groups on the baseline evaluation. The simulator group improved significantly from baseline with respect to time to completion and subjective performance (p<0.05). Time to completion was significantly faster in the simulator group compared to controls at final evaluation (p<0.05). No difference was observed between the groups on the subjective scores at final evaluation (p=0.98). Conclusions Shoulder arthroscopy simulator training resulted in significant benefits in clinical shoulder arthroscopy time to task completion in this cadaver model. This study provides important additional evidence of the benefit of simulators in orthopaedic surgical training. Clinical Relevance There may be a role for simulator training in shoulder arthroscopy education.

Residents have traditionally acquired LP skills by observing the procedure performed by a more senior resident or staff physician and then attempting the procedure themselves. This process can result in variable procedural skill acquisition and trainee discomfort. This study assessed changes in resident procedural skill and self-reported anxiety when residents were provided with an opportunity to participate in an interactive training session and practice LPs using a simulator. All pediatric residents at our institution were invited to participate. Residents were asked to report their post-graduate year (PGY), prior LP attempts and self-reported anxiety scores as measured by the standardized State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State Anxiety Scale (STAI-S) prior to completing an observed pre-test using an infant-sized LP simulator. Staff physicians observed and scored each resident's procedural skill using a previously published 21-point scoring system. Residents then participated in an interactive lecture on LP technique and were given an opportunity for staff-supervised, small group simulator-based practice within 1Â month of the pre-test. Repeat post-test was performed within 4Â months. Of the pediatric residents who completed the pre-test (Nâ=â20), 16/20 (80Â %) completed both the training session and post-test. Their PGY training level was: PGY1 (38Â %), PGY2 (25Â %), PGY3 (25Â %) or PGY4 (12Â %). Procedural skill improved in 15/16 residents (paired t-test; pâ<â0.001), driven by a significant improvement in skill for residents in PGY1 (Pâ=â0.015) and PGY2 (pâ=â0.003) but not PGY3 or PGY4. Overall anxiety scores were higher at baseline than at post testing (meanâÂ±âSD; 44.8âÂ±â12.1 vs 39.7âÂ±â9.4; NS) however only PGY1 residents experienced a significant reduction in anxiety (paired t-test, pâ=â0.04).

This study evaluated the effect of simulation-based team training on the self-assessed ability of personnel to perform neonatal resuscitation. We evaluated a full-day simulation-based team training course in neonatal resuscitation, by administering a questionnaire to 110 physicians, nurses and midwives before and after the training period. The questionnaire focused on four important domains: communication, leadership, confidence and technical skills. The study was carried out in Sweden from 2005 to 2007. The response rate was 84%. Improvements in the participants' self-assessed ability to perform neonatal resuscitation were seen in all four domains after training (p < 0.001). Professionally inexperienced personnel showed a significant improvement in the technical skills domain compared to experienced personnel (p = 0.001). No differences were seen between professions or time since training in any of the four domains. Personnel with less previous experience with neonatal resuscitation showed improved confidence (p = 0.007) and technical skills (p = 0.003). A full-day course on simulation-based team training with video-supported debriefing improved the participants' self-assessed ability to perform neonatal resuscitation.

To accomplish this objective, clinical skill training using various simulations was introduced into medical education to cultivate creativity and develop the practical ability of students. However, quantitative analysis of the efficiency of clinical skill training with simulations is lacking. Methods In the present study, we compared the mean scores of medical students (Jinan University) who graduated in 2013 and 2014 on 16 stations between traditional training (control) and simulative training groups. In addition, in a clinical skill competition, the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) scores of participating medical students trained using traditional and simulative training were compared. The data were statistically analyzed and qualitatively described. Results The results revealed that simulative training could significantly enhance the graduate score of medical students compared with the control. The OSCE scores of participating medical students in the clinical skill competition, trained using simulations, were dramatically higher than those of students trained through traditional methods, and we also observed that the OSCE marks were significantly increased for the same participant after simulative training for the clinical skill competition. Conclusions Taken together, these data indicate that clinical skill training with a variety of simulations could substantially promote the clinical performance of medical students and optimize the resources used for medical education, although a precise analysis of each specialization is needed in the future.

General practice (GP) residents are involved in the first-line management of gynecologic emergencies. They are not familiar with US equipment. Initial training on simulators was conducted.The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of simulation-based training on the quality of the sonographic images achieved by GP residents 2Â months after the simulation training versus clinical training alone. Young GP residents assigned to emergency gynecology departments were invited to a one-day simulation-based US training session. A prospective controlled trial aiming to assess the impact of such training on TVS (transvaginal ultrasound scan) image quality was conducted. The first group included GP residents who attended the simulation training course. The second group included GP residents who did not attend the course. Written consent to participate was obtained from all participants. Images achieved 2Â months after the training were scored using standardized quality criteria and compared in both groups. The stress generated by this examination was also assessed with a simple numeric scale. A total of 137 residents attended the simulation training, 26 consented to participate in the controlled trial. Sonographic image quality was significantly better in the simulation group for the sagittal view of the uterus (3.6 vs 2.7, p â=â0.01), for the longitudinal view of the right ovary (2.8 vs 1.4, p â=â0.027), and for the Morrison space (1.7 vs 0.4, p â=â0.034), but the difference was not significant for the left ovary (2.9 vs 1.7, p â=â0.189). The stress generated by TVS after 2Â months was not different between the groups (6.0 vs 4.8, p â=â0.4). Simulation-based training improved the quality of pelvic US images in GP residents assessed after 2Â months of experience in gynecology compared to clinical training alone.\n\nSurgical simulators in urological training--views of UK Training Programme Directors.\n\nPubMed\n\nForster, James A; Browning, Anthony J; Paul, Alan B; Biyani, C Shekhar\n\n2012-09-01\n\nWhat's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The role of surgical simulators is currently being debated in urological and other surgical specialties. Simulators are not presently implemented in the UK urology training curriculum. The availability of simulators and the opinions of Training Programme Directors' (TPD) on their role have not been described. In the present questionnaire-based survey, the trainees of most, but not all, UK TPDs had access to laparoscopic simulators, and that all responding TPDs thought that simulators improved laparoscopic training. We hope that the present study will be a positive step towards making an agreement to formally introduce simulators into the UK urology training curriculum. To discuss the current situation on the use of simulators in surgical training. To determine the views of UK Urology Training Programme Directors (TPDs) on the availability and use of simulators in Urology at present, and to discuss the role that simulators may have in future training. An online-questionnaire survey was distributed to all UK Urology TPDs. In all, 16 of 21 TPDs responded. All 16 thought that laparoscopic simulators improved the quality of laparoscopic training. The trainees of 13 TPDs had access to a laparoscopic simulator (either in their own hospital or another hospital in the deanery). Most TPDs thought that trainees should use simulators in their free time, in quiet time during work hours, or in teaching sessions (rather than incorporated into the weekly timetable). We feel that the current apprentice-style method of training in urological surgery is out-dated. We think that all TPDs and trainees should have access to a simulator, and that a formal competency based simulation training programme should be incorporated into the urology training curriculum, with trainees reaching a minimum proficiency on a simulator before undertaking surgical procedures.

This curriculum may be enhanced through the application of progressive learning, a training strategy centered on incrementally challenging learners. We aimed to determine whether a progressive learning-based curriculum (PLC) would lead to superior clinical performance compared with an SCC. This was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial conducted at a single academic center. Thirty-seven novice endoscopists were recruited and randomized to either a PLC (nÂ = 18) or to an SCC (nÂ = 19). The PLC comprised 6 hours of SBT, which progressed in complexity and difficulty. The SCC included 6 hours of SBT, with cases of random order of difficulty. Both groups received expert feedback and 4 hours of didactic teaching. Participants were assessed at baseline, immediately after training, and 4 to 6 weeks after training. The primary outcome was participants' performance during their first 2 clinical colonoscopies, as assessed by using the Joint Advisory Group Direct Observation of Procedural Skills assessment tool (JAG DOPS). Secondary outcomes were differences in endoscopic knowledge, technical and communication skills, and global performance in the simulated setting. The PLC group outperformed the SCC group during first and second clinical colonoscopies, measured by JAG DOPS (PÂ < .001). Additionally, the PLC group had superior technical and communication skills and global performance in the simulated setting (PÂ < .05). There were no differences between groups in endoscopic knowledge (P > .05). Our findings demonstrate the superiority of a PLC for endoscopic simulation, compared with an SCC. Challenging trainees progressively is a simple, theory-based approach to simulation whereby the performance of clinical colonoscopies can be improved.

Rare injuries and diseases as well as patients in extreme age groups can unexpectedly face emergency physicians. In the regulations on medical education the German Medical Association requires participation in 50 emergency missions under the supervision of an experienced emergency physician. This needs to be improved because on-the-job training does not generally represent the whole spectrum of emergency medicine and a good and structured training under on call conditions is nearly impossible. The subject of the model project described was whether practical training for emergency physicians can be achieved by participation in simulation training instead of real emergency situations. After modification of the Saarland regulations on medical education it was possible to replace up to 25 participations in emergency missions by simulation training. The concept of the course NASimSaar25 requires participants to complete 25 simulator cases in 3 days in small training groups. Emergency situations from all medical disciplines need to be treated. A special focus is on the treatment of life-threatening and rare diseases and injuries. Modern simulators and actors are used. The debriefings are conducted by experienced tutors based on approved principles. Medical contents, learning targets from the field of crew resource management (CRM) and soft skills are discussed in these debriefings. Education in the field of emergency medicine can be improved by simulator-based learning and training. However, practical work under a tutor in real and clinical experience cannot be completely replaced by simulation. Simulator training can only be successful if theoretical knowledge has already been acquired. A simulator-based course concept can result in an improvement of emergency medical education. The model project NASimSaar25 was well received by the target audience and mostly very well evaluated in terms of\n\nSurgical simulators in cataract surgery training.\n\nPubMed\n\nSikder, Shameema; Tuwairqi, Khaled; Al-Kahtani, Eman; Myers, William G; Banerjee, Pat\n\n2014-02-01\n\nVirtual simulators have been widely implemented in medical and surgical training, including ophthalmology. The increasing number of published articles in this field mandates a review of the available results to assess current technology and explore future opportunities. A PubMed search was conducted and a total of 10 articles were reviewed. Virtual simulators have shown construct validity in many modules, successfully differentiating user experience levels during simulated phacoemulsification surgery. Simulators have also shown improvements in wet-lab performance. The implementation of simulators in the residency training has been associated with a decrease in cataract surgery complication rates. Virtual reality simulators are an effective tool in measuring performance and differentiating trainee skill level. Additionally, they may be useful in improving surgical skill and patient outcomes in cataract surgery. Future opportunities rely on taking advantage of technical improvements in simulators for education and research.\n\nInterdisciplinary simulation-based training to improve delivery room communication.\n\nPubMed\n\nDadiz, Rita; Weinschreider, Joanne; Schriefer, Jan; Arnold, Christine; Greves, Cole D; Crosby, Erin C; Wang, Hongyue; Pressman, Eva K; Guillet, Ronnie\n\n2013-10-01\n\nPoor communication among obstetric and pediatric professionals is associated with adverse perinatal events leading to severe disability and neonatal mortality. This study evaluated the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary simulation-based training (SBT) program to improve delivery room communication between obstetric and pediatric teams. Obstetric and pediatric teams participated in an SBT annually during 3 academic years, 2008-2011 (Y1-Y3), in a prospective, observational study. Eligible participants (n = 228) included attendings, fellows, house staff, midlevel providers, and nurses involved in delivery room care. Simulations were videotaped and evaluated using a validated 20-item checklist of best communication practices. Checklist scores were compared across years with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Providers were also surveyed annually regarding communication during actual deliveries using a standardized questionnaire. Ratings were analyzed using two-way analysis of covariance. At least 60% of eligible providers participated in 1 or more SBT sessions and completed surveys annually. Checklist scores on communication during SBT improved from Y1 (median, 6; interquartile range, 4) to Y3 (median, 11; interquartile range, 6) (P < 0.001). Survey results showed the perception of improvement over time in interteam communication during actual deliveries by obstetric (P < 0.005) and pediatric (P < 0.0001) providers. The obstetric team also perceived improved provider communication with the family (P < 0.05). Communication during SBT as well as the perception of communication during actual deliveries improved across the study period. The potential of a checklist to standardize delivery room communication and improve patient outcomes merits further investigation.\n\nFundamentals of Arthroscopic Surgery Training Program Improves Knee Arthroscopy Simulator Performance in Arthroscopic Trainees.\n\nPubMed\n\nCychosz, Chris C; Tofte, Josef N; Johnson, Alyssa; Gao, Yubo; Phisitkul, Phinit\n\n2018-05-01\n\nTo determine the effectiveness of a nonanatomic simulator in developing basic arthroscopy motor skills transferable to an anatomic model. Forty-three arthroscopy novice individuals currently enrolled in medical school were recruited to perform a diagnostic knee arthroscopy using a high-fidelity virtual reality arthroscopic simulator providing haptic feedback after viewing a video of an expert performing an identical procedure. Students were then randomized into an experimental or control group. The experimental group then completed a series of self-guided training modules using the fundamentals of arthroscopy simulator training nonanatomic modules including camera centering, tracking, periscoping, palpation, and collecting stars in a three-dimensional space. Both groups completed another diagnostic knee arthroscopy between 1 and 2Â weeks later. Camera path length, time, tibia and femur cartilage damage, as well as a composite score were recorded by the simulator on each attempt. The experimental group (nÂ = 22) showed superior performance in composite score (30.09 vs 24, PÂ = .046) and camera path length (71.51Â cm vs 109.07Â cm, PÂ = .0274) at the time of the second diagnostic knee arthroscope compared with the control group (nÂ = 21). The experimental group also showed significantly greater improvement in composite score between the first and second arthroscopes compared with the control group (14.27 vs 4.95, P < .01). Femoral and tibial cartilage damage were not significantly improved between arthroscopy attempts (-0.86% vsÂ -1.45%, PÂ = .40) and (-1.10 vsÂ -1.27%, PÂ = .83), respectively. The virtual reality-based fundamentals of arthroscopy simulator training nonanatomic simulator is beneficial in developing basic motor skills in arthroscopy novice individuals resulting in significantly greater composite performance in an anatomic knee model. Based on the results of this study, it appears that there may be benefit from nonanatomic simulators in general as part\n\nSome Factors Influencing Transfer of Simulator Training.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCaro, Paul W.\n\nStudies of transfer of training may be used to determine whether simulator training improves pilot performance in an aircraft.

A prospective analysis included 40 radiology residents and eight staff radiologists. Residents took an online pretest to assess baseline procedural knowledge. Second-through fourth-year residents' baseline technical skills with a procedural phantom were evaluated. First-through third-year residents then underwent formal didactic and simulation-based procedural and technical training with one of two interventional radiologists and followed the training with 1 month of supervised phantom-based practice. Thereafter, residents underwent final written and practical examinations. The practical examination included essential items from a 20-point checklist, including site and side marking, consent, time-out, and sterile technique along with a technical skills portion assessing pedal steps, radiation dose, needle redirects, and procedure time. The results indicated statistically significant improvement in procedural and technical skills after simulation training. For residents, the median number of pedal steps decreased by three (p=0.001), median dose decreased by 15.4 mGy (p<0.001), median procedure time decreased by 4.0 minutes (p<0.001), median number of needle redirects decreased by 1.0 (p=0.005), and median number of 20-point checklist items successfully completed increased by three (p<0.001). The results suggest that procedural skills can be acquired and improved by simulation-based training of residents, regardless of experience. CT simulation training decreases procedural time, decreases radiation dose, and improves resident efficiency and confidence, which may transfer to clinical practice with improved patient care and safety.\n\nUltrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia Simulation Training: A Systematic Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Xiao Xu; Trivedi, Vatsal; AlSaflan, AbdulHadi A; Todd, Suzanne Clare; Tricco, Andrea C; McCartney, Colin J L; Boet, Sylvain\n\nUltrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA) has become the criterion standard of regional anesthesia practice. Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia teaching programs often use simulation, and guidelines have been published to help guide URGA education. This systematic review aimed to examine the effectiveness of simulation-based education for the acquisition and maintenance of competence in UGRA. Studies identified in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ERIC were included if they assessed simulation-based UGRA teaching with outcomes measured at Kirkpatrick level 2 (knowledge and skills), 3 (transfer of learning to the workplace), or 4 (patient outcomes). Two authors independently reviewed all identified references for eligibility, abstracted data, and appraised quality. After screening 176 citations and 45 full-text articles, 12 studies were included. Simulation-enhanced training improved knowledge acquisition (Kirkpatrick level 2) when compared with nonsimulation training. Seven studies measuring skill acquisition (Kirkpatrick level 2) found that simulation-enhanced UGRA training was significantly more effective than alternative teaching methods or no intervention. One study measuring transfer of learning into the clinical setting (Kirkpatrick level 3) found no difference between simulation-enhanced UGRA training and non-simulation-based training. However, this study was discontinued early because of technical challenges. Two studies examined patient outcomes (Kirkpatrick level 4), and one of these found that simulation-based UGRA training improved patient outcomes compared with didactic teaching. Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia knowledge and skills significantly improved with simulation training. The acquired UGRA skills may be transferred to the clinical setting; however, further studies are required to confirm these changes translate to improved patient outcomes.\n\nStructured training on the da Vinci Skills Simulator leads to improvement in technical performance of robotic novices.\n\nPubMed\n\nWalliczek-Dworschak, U; Mandapathil, M; FÃ¶rtsch, A; Teymoortash, A; Dworschak, P; Werner, J A; GÃ¼ldner, C\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe increasing use of minimally invasive techniques such as robotic-assisted devices raises the question of how to acquire robotic surgery skills. The da Vinci Skills Simulator has been demonstrated to be an effective training tool in previous reports. To date, little data are available on how to acquire proficiency through simulator training. We investigated the outcome of a structured training programme for robotic surgical skills by robotic novices. This prospective study was conducted from January to December 2013 using the da Vinci Skills Simulator. Twenty participants, all robotic novices, were enrolled in a 4-week training curriculum. After a brief introduction to the simulator system, three consecutive repetitions of five selected exercises (Match Board 1, 2, 3 and Ring and Rail 1, 2) were performed in a defined order on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. On day 22, one repetition of a previously unpractised more advanced module (Needle Targeting) was also performed. After completion of each study day, the overall performance, time to completion, economy in motion, instrument collisions, excessive instrument force, instruments out of view, master workspace range and number of drops were analysed. Comparing the first and final repetition, overall score and time needed to complete all exercises, economy of motion and instrument collisions were significantly improved in nearly all exercises. Regarding the new exercise, a positive training effect could be demonstrated. While its overall entry score was significantly higher, the time to completion and economy of motion were significantly lower than the scores on the first repetition of the previous 5 exercises. It could be shown that training on the da Vinci Skills Simulator led to an improvement in technical performance of robotic novices. With regard to a new exercise, the training had a positive effect on the technical performance.

High computational cost limits their direct applications in investigating dynamic behaviours of an entire train set for crashworthiness design and structural optimisation. On the contrary, multi-body modelling is widely used because of its low computational cost with the trade-off in accuracy. In this study, a data-driven train crash modelling method is proposed to improve the performance of a multi-body dynamics simulation of train set crash without increasing the computational burden. This is achieved by the parallel random forest algorithm, which is a machine learning approach that extracts useful patterns of force-displacement curves and predicts a force-displacement relation in a given collision condition from a collection of offline FE simulation data on various collision conditions, namely different crash velocities in our analysis. Using the FE simulation results as a benchmark, we compared our method with traditional multi-body modelling methods and the result shows that our data-driven method improves the accuracy over traditional multi-body models in train crash simulation and runs at the same level of efficiency.\n\nSimulation For Task Practice in Technical Training.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMallory, W.

Simulation is the main method of training in addition to clinical patient care. Access to cadaver-based training is limited due to cost and availability. The relative fidelity and perceived value of cadaver-based simulation training is unknown. This pilot study sought to describe the relative value of cadaver training compared to simulation for cricothyrotomy and tube thoracostomy. To perform a pilot study to assess whether there is a significant difference in fidelity and educational experience of cadaver-based training compared to simulation training. To understand how important this difference is in training residents in low-frequency procedures. Twenty-two senior EM residents (PGY3 and 4) who had completed standard simulation training on cricothyrotomy and tube thoracostomy participated in a formalin-fixed cadaver training program. Participants were surveyed on the relative fidelity of the training using a 100 point visual analogue scale (VAS) with 100 defined as equal to performing the procedure on a real patient. Respondents were also asked to estimate how much the cadaveric training improved the comfort level with performing the procedures on a scale between 0 and 100Â %. Open-response feedback was also collected. The response rate was 100Â % (22/22). The average fidelity of the cadaver versus simulation training was 79.9Â Â±Â 7.0 vs. 34.7Â Â±Â 13.4 for cricothyrotomy (pÂ <Â 0.0001) and 86Â Â±Â 8.6 vs. 38.4Â Â±Â 19.3 for tube thoracostomy (pÂ <Â 0.0001). Improvement in comfort levels performing procedures after the cadaveric training was rated as 78.5Â Â±Â 13.3 for tube thoracostomy and 78.7Â Â±Â 14.3 for cricothyrotomy. All respondents felt this difference in fidelity to be important for procedural training with 21/22 respondents specifically citing the importance of superior landmark and tissue fidelity compared to\n\nSimulation training and resident performance of singleton vaginal breech delivery.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeering, Shad; Brown, Jill; Hodor, Jonathon; Satin, Andrew J\n\n2006-01-01\n\nTo determine whether simulation training improves resident competency in the management of a simulated vaginal breech delivery. Without advance notice or training, residents from 2 obstetrics and gynecology residency programs participated in a standardized simulation scenario of management of an imminent term vaginal breech delivery. The scenario used an obstetric birth simulator and human actors, with the encounters digitally recorded. Residents then received a training session with the simulator on the proper techniques for vaginal breech delivery. Two weeks later they were retested using a similar simulation scenario. A physician, blinded to training status, graded the residents' performance using a standardized evaluation sheet. Statistical analysis included the Wilcoxon signed rank test, McNemar chi2, regression analysis, and paired t test as appropriate with a P value of less than .05 considered significant. Twenty residents from 2 institutions completed all parts of the study protocol. Trained residents had significantly higher scores in 8 of 12 critical delivery components (P < .05). Overall performance of the delivery and safety in performing the delivery also improved significantly (P = .001 for both). Simulation training improved resident performance in the management of a simulated vaginal breech delivery. Performance of a term breech vaginal delivery is well suited for simulation training, because it is uncommon and inevitable, and improper technique may result in significant injury.

To describe the implementation of a laparoscopic simulation training and credentialing program for gynaecology registrars. A pilot program consisting of protected, supervised laparoscopic simulation time, a tailored curriculum and a credentialing process, was developed and implemented. Quantitative measures assessing simulated surgical performance were measured over the simulation training period. Laparoscopic procedures requiring credentialing were assessed for both the frequency of a registrar being the primary operator and the duration of surgery and compared to a presimulation cohort. Qualitative measures regarding quality of surgical training were assessed pre- and postsimulation. Improvements were seen in simulated surgical performance in efficiency domains. Operative time for procedures requiring credentialing was reduced by 12%. Primary operator status in the operating theatre for registrars was unchanged. Registrar assessment of training quality improved. The introduction of a laparoscopic simulation training and credentialing program resulted in improvements in simulated performance, reduced operative time and improved registrar assessment of the quality of training.

Skills obtained through virtual reality simulation training can be transferred on the operating room. However, relative evidence is limited with data available only for basic surgical skills and for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. No data exist on the effect of virtual reality simulation on performance on advanced surgical procedures. Evidence suggests that performance on virtual reality simulators reliably distinguishes experienced from novice surgeons Limited available data suggest that independent approach on virtual reality simulation training is not different from proctored approach. The effect of virtual reality simulators training on acquisition of basic surgical skills does not seem to be different from the effect the physical simulators. Limited data exist on the effect of virtual reality simulation training on the acquisition of visual spatial perception and stress coping skills. Undoubtedly, virtual reality simulation training provides an alternative means of improving performance in laparoscopic surgery. However, future research efforts should focus on the effect of virtual reality simulation on performance in the context of advanced surgical procedure, on standardization of training, on the possibility of synergistic effect of virtual reality simulation training combined with mental training, on personalized training.

We evaluated whether oblique 57Î peripheral prisms (p-prisms) and perceptual-motor training improved blind-side detection rates. Methods Patients with HH (n = 11) wore p-prisms for 2 weeks and then received perceptual-motor training (six visits) detecting and touching stimuli in the prism-expanded vision. In a driving simulator, patients drove and pressed the horn upon detection of pedestrians who ran toward the roadway (26 from each side): (1) without p-prisms at baseline; (2) with p-prisms after 2 weeks acclimation but before training; (3) with p-prisms after training; and (4) 3 months later. Results P-prisms improved blind-side detection from 42% to 56%, which further improved after training to 72% (all P < 0.001). Blind-side timely responses (adequate time to have stopped) improved from 31% without to 44% with p-prisms (P < 0.001) and further improved with training to 55% (P = 0.02). At the 3-month follow-up, improvements from training were maintained for detection (65%; P = 0.02) but not timely responses (P = 0.725). There was wide between-subject variability in baseline detection performance and response to p-prisms. There were no negative effects of p-prisms on vehicle control or seeing-side performance.

The Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) Simulation Committee developed a simulation-based curriculum incorporating VR simulators to train residents in the management of common neurosurgical disorders. To enhance neurosurgical resident training for ventriculostomy placement using simulation-based training. A course-based neurosurgical simulation curriculum was introduced at the Neurosurgical Simulation Symposium at the 2011 and 2012 CNS annual meetings. A trauma module was developed to teach ventriculostomy placement as one of the neurosurgical procedures commonly performed in the management of traumatic brain injury. The course offered both didactic and simulator-based instruction, incorporating written and practical pretests and posttests and questionnaires to assess improvement in skill level and to validate the simulators as teaching tools. Fourteen trainees participated in the didactic component of the trauma module. Written scores improved significantly from pretest (75%) to posttest (87.5%; P < .05). Seven participants completed the ventriculostomy simulation. Significant improvements were observed in anatomy (P < .04), burr hole placement (P < .03), final location of the catheter (P = .05), and procedure completion time (P < .004). Senior residents planned a significantly better trajectory (P < .01); junior participants improved most in terms of identifying the relevant anatomy (P < .03) and the time required to complete the procedure (P < .04). VR ventriculostomy placement as part of the CNS simulation trauma module complements standard training techniques for residents in the management of neurosurgical trauma. Improvement in didactic and hands-on knowledge by course participants demonstrates the usefulness of the VR simulator as a training tool.\n\nImplementation and evaluation of a dilation and evacuation simulation training curriculum.\n\nPubMed\n\nYork, Sloane L; McGaghie, William C; Kiley, Jessica; Hammond, Cassing\n\n2016-06-01\n\nTo evaluate obstetrics and gynecology resident physicians' performance following a simulation curriculum on dilation and evacuation (D&E) procedures. This study included two phases: simulation curriculum development and resident physician performance evaluation following training on a D&E simulator. Trainees participated in two evaluations. Simulation training evaluated participants performing six cases on a D&E simulator, measuring procedural time and a 26-step checklist of D&E steps. The operative training portion evaluated residents' performance after training on the simulator using mastery learning techniques. Intra-operative evaluation was based on a 21-step checklist score, Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS), and percentage of cases completed. Twenty-two residents participated in simulation training, demonstrating improved performance from cases one and two to cases five and six, as measured by checklist score and procedural time (p<.001 and p=.001, respectively). Of 10 participants in the operative training, all performed at least three D&Es, while seven performed at least six cases. While checklist scores did not change significantly from the first to sixth case (mean for first case: 18.3; for sixth case: 19.6; p=.593), OSATS ratings improved from case one (19.7) to case three (23.5; p=.001) and to case six (26.8; p=.005). Trainees completed approximately 71.6% of their first case (range: 21.4-100%). By case six, the six participants performed 81.2% of the case (range: 14.3-100%). D&E simulation using a newly-developed uterine model and simulation curriculum improves resident technical skills. Simulation training with mastery learning techniques transferred to high level of performance in OR using checklist. The OSATS measured skills and showed improvement in performance with subsequent cases. Implementation of a D&E simulation curriculum offers potential for improved surgical training and abortion provision.

Despite potential benefits to low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), simulation training is predominately used in high-income settings. This study evaluates the effectiveness of simulation training in one LMIC (Rwanda). Twenty-six postgraduate surgical trainees at the University of Rwanda (Kigali, Rwanda) and Dalhousie University (Halifax, Canada) participated in the study. Participants attended one 3-hour simulation session using a high-fidelity, tissue-based model simulating the creation of an end ileostomy. Each participant was anonymously recorded completing the assigned task at three time points: prior to, immediately following, and 90Â days following the simulation training. A single blinded expert reviewer assessed the performance using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) instrument. The mean OSATS score improvement for participants who completed all the assessments was 6.1 points [95Â % Confidence Interval (CI) 2.2-9.9, pÂ =Â 0.005]. Improvement was sustained over a 90-day period with a mean improvement of 4.1 points between the first and third attempts (95Â % CI 0.3-7.9, pÂ =Â 0.038). Simulation training was effective in both study sites, though most gains occurred with junior-level learners, with a mean improvement of 8.3 points (95Â % CI 5.1-11.6, pÂ <Â 0.001). Significant improvements were not identified for senior-level learners. This study supports the benefit for simulation in surgical training in LMICs. Skill improvements were limited to junior-level trainees. This work provides justification for investment in simulation-based curricula in Rwanda and potentially other LMICs.\n\nPerceptions, training experiences, and preferences of surgical residents toward laparoscopic simulation training: a resident survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nShetty, Shohan; Zevin, Boris; Grantcharov, Teodor P; Roberts, Kurt E; Duffy, Andrew J\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSimulation training for surgical residents can shorten learning curves, improve technical skills, and expedite competency. Several studies have shown that skills learned in the simulated environment are transferable to the operating room. Residency programs are trying to incorporate simulation into the resident training curriculum to supplement the hands-on experience gained in the operating room. Despite the availability and proven utility of surgical simulators and simulation laboratories, they are still widely underutilized by surgical trainees. Studies have shown that voluntary use leads to minimal participation in a training curriculum. Although there are several simulation tools, there is no clear evidence of the superiority of one tool over the other in skill acquisition. The purpose of this study was to explore resident perceptions, training experiences, and preferences regarding laparoscopic simulation training. Our goal was to profile resident participation in surgical skills simulation, recognize potential barriers to voluntary simulator use, and identify simulation tools and tasks preferred by residents. Furthermore, this study may help to inform whether mandatory/protected training time, as part of the residents' curriculum is essential to enhance participation in the simulation laboratory. A cross-sectional study on general surgery residents (postgraduate years 1-5) at Yale University School of Medicine and the University of Toronto via an online questionnaire was conducted. Overall, 67 residents completed the survey. The institutional review board approved the methods of the study. Overall, 95.5% of the participants believed that simulation training improved their laparoscopic skills. Most respondents (92.5%) perceived that skills learned during simulation training were transferrable to the operating room. Overall, 56.7% of participants agreed that proficiency in a simulation curriculum should be mandatory before operating room experience.

Zh; Kemalov, B. K.; Yurkov, N. K.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe analysis of the works with attempts to verify the adequacy of both simulation and simulators themselves was carried out. However, these attempts are limited by determining the facts of adequacy or inadequacy of checking systems that cannot be used to identify the skills acquired in accordance with the input of a generalized classification. Adequacy is a concomitant sign of inadequate use of simulators, however, the established base for assessing the adequacy of simulators does not allow presenting it in the form of the indicator of the accompanying sign of inadequacy of use of simulators. And the primary task is to determine its quantitative form, which would eliminate the disparity evaluations of teaching. This research paper presents the problems of the simulator training organization that regardless of the received ideas of flight missions planning, have the real objective, which is in conflict with an aircraft application, the essence of which is the presence of contradictions between the predicted and real necessary amount of forces and means to ensure the effectiveness. The paper aims at the adaptation of the content curriculum component for eliminating inadequate use of simulators, which should be focused on developing measures to compensate false skills in order to improve the accuracy of determining the flying skills in simulator training planning.\n\nIs There Bias against Simulation in Microsurgery Training?\n\nPubMed\n\nTheman, Todd A; Labow, Brian I\n\n2016-09-01\n\nBackgroundâWhile other surgical specialties have embraced virtual reality simulation for training and recertification, microsurgery has lagged. This study aims to assess the opinions of microsurgeons on the role of simulation in microsurgery assessment and training. MethodsâWe surveyed faculty members of the American Society of Reconstructive Microsurgery to ascertain opinions on their use of simulation in training and opinions about the utility of simulation for skills acquisition, teaching, and skills assessment. The 21-question survey was disseminated online to 675 members. ResultsâEighty-nine members completed the survey for a 13.2% response rate. Few microsurgeons have experience with high-fidelity simulation, and opinions on its utility are internally inconsistent. Although 84% of respondents could not identify a reason why simulation would not be useful, only 24% believed simulation is a useful measure of clinical performance. Nearly three-fourths of respondents were skeptical that simulation would improve their skills. Ninety-four percent had no experience with simulator-based assessment. ConclusionâSimulation has been shown to improve skills acquisition in microsurgery, but our survey suggests that unfamiliarity may foster bias against the technology. Failure to incorporate simulation may adversely affect training and may put surgeons at a disadvantage should these technologies be adopted for recertification by regulatory agencies.

Despite periodic training, real-life chest compressions have been reported to be overly shallow and/or fast, very likely affecting patient outcomes. We investigated the effect of a brief Crew Resource Management (CRM) training program on the correction rate of improperly executed chest compressions in a simulated cardiac arrest scenario. Final-year medical students (nâ=â57) were randomised to receive a 10-min computer-based CRM or a control training on ethics. Acting as team leaders, subjects performed resuscitation in a simulated cardiac arrest scenario before and after the training. Team members performed standardised overly shallow and fast chest compressions. We analysed how often the team leader recognised and corrected improper chest compressions, as well as communication and resuscitation quality. After the CRM training, team leaders corrected improper chest compressions (35.5%) significantly more often compared with those undergoing control training (7.7%, pâ=â0.03*). Consequently, four students have to be trained (number needed to treatâ=â3.6) for one improved chest compression scenario. Communication quality assessed by the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire significantly increased in the intervention group by a mean of 4.5 compared with 2.0 (pâ=â0.01*) in the control group. A computer-based, 10-min CRM training improved the recognition of ineffective of chest compressions. Furthermore, communication quality increased. As guideline-adherent chest compressions have been linked to improved patient outcomes, our CRM training might represent a brief and affordable approach to increase chest compression quality and potentially improve patient outcomes.\n\nDiagnostic Performance 1Â H after Simulation Training Predicts Learning\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nConsoli, Anna; Fraser, Kristin; Ma, Irene; Sobczak, Matthew; Wright, Bruce; McLaughlin, Kevin\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAlthough simulation training improves post-training performance, it is unclear how well performance soon after simulation training predicts longer term outcomes (i.e., learning).

Summary Background Data: Numerous influences have led to the development of computer-aided laparoscopic simulators: a need for greater efficiency in training, the unique and complex nature of laparoscopic surgery, and the increasing demand that surgeons demonstrate competence before proceeding to the operating room. The LapMentorâ¢ simulator is expensive, however, and its use must be validated and justified prior to implementation into surgical training programs. Methods: Nineteen surgical interns were randomized to training on the LapMentorâ¢ laparoscopic simulator (n = 10) or to a control group (no simulator training, n = 9). Subjects randomized to the LapMentorâ¢ trained to expert criterion levels 2 consecutive times on 6 designated basic skills modules. All subjects then completed a series of laparoscopic exercises in a live porcine model, and performance was assessed independently by 2 blinded reviewers. Time, accuracy rates, and global assessments of performance were recorded with an interrater reliability between reviewers of 0.99. Results: LapMentorâ¢ trained interns completed the 30Â° camera navigation exercise in significantly less time than control interns (166 Â± 52 vs. 220 Â± 39 seconds, P < 0.05); they also achieved higher accuracy rates in identifying the required objects with the laparoscope (96% Â± 8% vs. 82% Â± 15%, P < 0.05). Similarly, on the two-handed object transfer exercise, task completion time for LapMentorâ¢ trained versus control interns was 130 Â± 23 versus 184 Â± 43 seconds (P < 0.01) with an accuracy rate of 98% Â± 5% versus 80% Â± 13% (P < 0.001). Additionally, LapMentorâ¢ trained interns outperformed control subjects with regard to camera navigation skills, efficiency of motion, optimal instrument handling, perceptual ability, and performance\n\nA novel critical skills curriculum for surgical interns incorporating simulation training improves readiness for acute inpatient care.\n\nPubMed\n\nAntonoff, Mara B; Shelstad, Ryan C; Schmitz, Connie; Chipman, Jeffrey; D'Cunha, Jonathan\n\n2009-01-01\n\nSurgical interns encounter complex, acute care situations often managed with limited supervision. Furthermore, medical school training does not adequately prepare students for special surgical considerations. Using simulation training, we implemented a course aimed at improving surgical intern readiness for responding to unique, life-threatening issues encountered in daily surgical care. Twenty University of Minnesota surgical interns participated in the 3-week course. The first session consisted of interactive didactics and simulation covering hypoxia, shock, and metabolic disturbances; the second session addressed cardiopulmonary emergencies, including ventricular assist device and pacemaker use. Electronic simulation scenarios comprised the third session, allowing learners to demonstrate learned/practiced skills. The outcomes were assessed objectively (pretest and posttest) and subjectively (standardized feedback evaluations). Fifteen learners completed the pretest and posttest. The mean absolute score increase was 14% with average relative score improvement of 43%. Twenty learners completed feedback evaluations using a standard 5-point Likert scale. Respondents scored the first 2 sessions on topic importance (5 = very important), giving the first session 4.90 (+/- 0.31) and the second session 4.45 (+/- 0.89). Respondents ranked their confidence in executing practiced skills on actual patients (5 = very confident) as 4.24 (+/- 0.71). There was uniform support for the value of the electronic simulation scenarios as enhanced learning tools. We developed a course for surgical interns incorporating didactics and simulation. Learners demonstrated objective improvement in testing and reported that the course topics were highly important. After course completion, learners provided feedback indicating a high level of confidence in executing practiced skills, suggesting improved preparation for acute surgical care.\n\nSimulation-based training for nurses: Systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHegland, PÃ¥l A; Aarlie, Hege; StrÃ¸mme, Hilde; Jamtvedt, Gro\n\n2017-07-01\n\nSimulation-based training is a widespread strategy to improve health-care quality. However, its effect on registered nurses has previously not been established in systematic reviews. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate effect of simulation-based training on nurses' skills and knowledge. We searched CDSR, DARE, HTA, CENTRAL, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, ERIC, and SveMed+ for randomised controlled trials (RCT) evaluating effect of simulation-based training among nurses. Searches were completed in December 2016. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full-text, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We compared simulation-based training to other learning strategies, high-fidelity simulation to other simulation strategies, and different organisation of simulation training. Data were analysed through meta-analysis and narrative syntheses. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence. Fifteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria. For the comparison of simulation-based training to other learning strategies on nurses' skills, six studies in the meta-analysis showed a significant, but small effect in favour of simulation (SMD -1.09, CI -1.72 to -0.47). There was large heterogeneity (I 2 85%). For the other comparisons, there was large between-study variation in results. The quality of evidence for all comparisons was graded as low. The effect of simulation-based training varies substantially between studies. Our meta-analysis showed a significant effect of simulation training compared to other learning strategies, but the quality of evidence was low indicating uncertainty. Other comparisons showed inconsistency in results. Based on our findings simulation training appears to be an effective strategy to improve nurses' skills, but further good-quality RCTs with adequate sample sizes are needed.

Our aim is to assess the impact of bronchoscopy simulation training on bronchial anatomy knowledge and technical skills in medical students. Medical students were recruited by email, consented, and asked to fill out a survey regarding theirÂ baseline experience. Two thoracic surgeons measured their knowledge of bronchoscopy on a virtual reality bronchoscopy simulator using the Bronchoscopy SkillsÂ and Tasks Assessment Tool (BSTAT), a validated 65-point checklist (46 for anatomy, 19 for simulation). Students performed four self-directed training sessions of 15 minutes per week. A posttraining survey andÂ BSTAT were completed afterward. Differences between pretraining and posttraining scores were analyzed with paired Student's t tests and random intercept linear regression models accounting for baseline BSTAT score, total training time, and training year. The study was completed by 47 medical students with a mean training time of 81.5 Â± 26.8 minutes. Mean total BSTAT score increased significantly from 12.3 Â± 5.9 to 48.0 Â± 12.9 (p < 0.0001); mean scores for bronchial anatomy increased from 0.1 Â± 0.9 to 31.1 Â± 12.3 (p < 0.0001); and bronchoscopy navigational skills increased from 12.1 Â± 5.7 to 17.4 Â± 2.5 (p < 0.0001). Total training time and frequency of training did not have a significant impact on level of improvement. Self-driven bronchoscopy simulation training in medical students led to improvements in bronchial anatomy knowledge and bronchoscopy skills. Further investigation is under way to determine the impact of bronchoscopy simulation training on future specialty interest and long-term skills retention.

Trainees receive insufficient clinical exposure to develop this competency. Traditional training comprises a Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) complemented by clinical experience. More recently, simulation is being used in procedural skills training. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of a simulation session, which teaches the skill of neonatal intubation by comparing pre- and post-intervention performance, and examining transferability of skill acquisition to the clinical setting. First-year pediatric residents with NRP training, but no previous neonatal experience, attended a 2-h intubation education session conducted by two experienced respiratory therapists. Individual components of the skill were taught, followed by practice on a high-fidelity infant mannequin with concurrent feedback. Skills were assessed using a validated neonatal intubation checklist (CL) and a five-point global rating scale (GRS), pre- and immediately post-intervention, using the mannequin. Clinical intubations performed in the subsequent 8-week neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) rotation were evaluated by documenting success rates, time taken to intubate, and CL and GRS scores. Performance was also compared with similar data collected on intubations performed by a historical cohort of first-year residents who did not receive the training intervention. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Student's t-test and Ï (2)-test as appropriate, and analysis of variance. Thirteen residents participated in the educational session. Mean pre-intervention CL score was 65.4 Â± 18% (s.d.) and GRS was 3 Â± 0.7 (s.d.). Performance improved following the intervention with post-training CL score of 93 Â± 5% (P<0.0001) and GRS of 3.92 Â± 0.4 (P=0.0003).
