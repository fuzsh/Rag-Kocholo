The controversial 37-home estate in Wittonwood Road, Frinton, is likely to be called Ken Gatward Close.

Wing Commander Ken Gatward was a daring pilot who made a major impact in the Second World War, earning a series of medals for his accomplishments.

His most famous mission came in 1942, when he flew over occupied Paris and swooped low over the Arc de Triomphe, dropping a French flag on the monument to boost morale.

He even turned his Bristol Beaufighter’s machine guns on Gestapo headquarters before returning home.

In another famous mission, Mr Gatward helped destroy a large German convoy, despite sustaining major damage to his craft.

His medals – which included two Distinguished Flying Cross awards – were sold for thousands of pounds at auction, but a replica set is on display at Frinton War Memorial Club.

Mr Gatward spent many years in Frinton, before moving to Walton to enjoy his retirement, while other members of the Gatward family still live in the area.

He died in 1998, aged 84, but his name now looks likely to be immortalised in the new housing estate.

Frinton councillor Nick Turner said: “Ken Gatward was a hero from our town who deserves to be honoured and celebrated.

“His achievements were extraordinary and I would be proud to have his name recognised like this in Frinton.”
