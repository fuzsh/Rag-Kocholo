The contest will start at 6 p.m. ET on ESPN2. In addition, the practices on Jan. 20 and 21 will air live on ESPNU.\n\nA three-year starter at left tackle for the Scarlet Knights, Lumpkin will travel to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla., to be part of the 91st East-West Shrine Game.

Former NFL head coaches Mike Martz and Mike Holmgren will each lead a side as participating players will benefit from instruction by some of the best to ever play and coach the sport.
