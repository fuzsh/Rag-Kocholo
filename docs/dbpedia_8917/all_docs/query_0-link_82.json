        "text": "Partnership brings premier food and beverage services to Jazz, Arena, Bees\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (July 12, 2017) – The Utah Jazz and Vivint Smart Home Arena announced today the formation of a partnership with Levy, the pioneer in delivering premium sports dining, to manage food and beverage experiences when the downtown Salt Lake City facility debuts its $125 million renovation in October.\n\nThe joint venture to be known as Salted Honey Hospitality also extends to Smith’s Ballpark, the home of the Triple-A baseball Salt Lake Bees, as well as the Tour of Utah professional cycling stage race in August and the Salt Lake City Stars season of the NBA G League beginning in November. More than 2 million guests annually attend events at these Larry H. Miller Sports & Entertainment venues.\n\n“Distinctive and delicious food choices are an important part of the game-day experience,” said Jim Olson, president of Vivint Smart Home Arena. “Our guests deserve best-in-class hospitality from trend-inspired menus to building favorites when they attend our events. We are bringing together hometown restaurants and the culinary expertise of Levy to truly elevate the dining experience.”\n\nThe name Salted Honey Hospitality reflects the intent to bring guest experiences to life with the focus on the details of a world-class food experience, and the spirit of teamwork and family-style hospitality. Under the Salted Honey Hospitality umbrella, Vivint Smart Home Arena restaurant partners will retain their individual brand and food specialties.\n\nLevy has extensive experience in professional sports and developing market-relevant food experiences for all fans throughout the industry, specifically at NBA facilities including: Barclays Center in Brooklyn, United Center in Chicago and Moda Center in Portland. Their diverse portfolio includes restaurants services at the Grammy Awards, PGA Championship, US Open Tennis Championships, and Kentucky Derby.\n\n“This is a unique opportunity to create a signature hospitality brand that deeply impacts the live entertainment experience across Salt Lake City,” said Andy Lansing, president and CEO of Levy. “Our expertise cultivating local tastes for a wide array of fans, combined with Larry H. Miller Sports & Entertainment’s skill producing first-class events, will deliver a high-quality, memorable experience for all visitors to the arena.”\n\nVivint Smart Home Arena is undergoing a comprehensive rebuilding of its food and beverage options that will benefit all guests. The renovation of the luxury suites and creation of a super club on level two will maximize the use of working kitchens in dining areas to showcase the preparation of fresh food.\n\nInspired by an emerging, entrepreneurial food scene, more than 30 local restaurants and vendors have already been engaged as food providers next season. The four corners of the main concourse will feature specialty menus with barbecue from R&R, hand-tossed pizzas from Maxwell’s, Mexican food from El Chubasco, and gourmet hamburgers and signature beef sandwiches from Cubby’s. Utah favorites JDawgs polish and beef hot dogs and Hire’s old-fashioned drive-in style burgers are also joining CupBop Korean barbecue and Zao Asian Café.\n\nThe Jazz and Levy, as Salted Honey Hospitality, will conduct extensive marketing and fan research through next-generation analytics to get feedback from the fans and help shape the new culinary offerings. The partnership is also exploring technology advancements through the Jazz mobile app to improve ordering efficiency and fan convenience. The partnership will develop future fan enhancements with new concepts, graphics, and redesigned stands, carts and spaces.\n\nThe top-to-bottom upgrades to Vivint Smart Home Arena will improve the fan and visitor experience for years to come. The lower and upper bowl concourses are being redesigned along with fully-cushioned Jazz blue seats for all fans; a 12,000 square foot atrium and new plaza are reshaping the arena entrance; and more than 2,700 rooftop solar panels have been installed.\n\nUpdated renderings of Vivint Smart Home Arena are available at Arena Rising presented by Rocky Mountain Power.\n\n-- vivintsmarthomearenarising.com –\n\nAbout Vivint Home Smart Arena\n\nLocated in downtown Salt Lake City, Vivint Smart Home Arena opened in 1991 as the homecourt of the NBA Utah Jazz and is well known for being one of the hardest places to play for visiting teams.
