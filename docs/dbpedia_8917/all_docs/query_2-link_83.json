        "text": "“There is a magic, a real and powerful magic, in hometown heroes.”\n\n– Hannah Bell, Theatre Arlington\n\nPOV provides AMA friends and fans the opportunity to share their knowledge and points of view about art. This POV was submitted by guest contributor Hannah Bell, Front of House Manager for Theatre Arlington.\n\nWhen approached to write this post, I initially supposed I would discuss Taylor Swift’s re-recording of her music in a metaphorical middle finger to Scooter Braun—something my coworker condensed to, “That’s so metal.”\n\nAnd it was—it is—pretty metal of her.\n\nBut I recently had the pleasure of watching Fly By Night at Theatre Arlington, directed by hometown hero (and Broadway star) Major Attaway and it struck me that there is a magic, a real and powerful magic, in hometown heroes. Small town boy/girl “making it” strikes pride deep and wide in the hearts of those still at home, and, boy, do we love it when they come home to shine. I suppose it is because we know that we are not forgotten; that we are capable of great and beautiful things, and that we are a part of something much larger than ourselves.\n\nMajor’s sojourn into directing takes audiences through that same journey on a metaphysical musical trip through a love triangle, a blackout, and human connection; it is a beautiful show, but a great deal of the buzz, the excitement, comes from nothing other than the ability to boast that A BROADWAY STAR came home to Arlington to direct on his home turf. He picked us, he chose to come home, and man, did he ever knock it out of the park.\n\nTaylor Swift might be the initial draw to Arlington Museum of Art’s current exhibits, but the ones who are going to knock it out of the park? That’s Hometown Harmonies, featuring Arlington born and bred Grammy nominees/winners Kirstin Maldonado (featured on Theatre Arlington’s Walk of Fame alongside Major Attaway) and country stars Maren Morris and Mickey Guyton. Featured memorabilia from the artists who still call Arlington home and are proud of their roots. And who knows, maybe they’ll come home to shine just for us, just like Major.\n\nAnd our big Texas hearts will swell even bigger with overwhelming pride in our hometown heroes.\n\nUntil then, mosey on over to the Arlington Museum of Art and check out Girl in a Country Song and Hometown Harmonies. And, oh yeah, the incredible (and a little metal) Taylor Swift.\n\nAbout Theatre Arlington\n\nLocated in the center of Arlington Cultural District, Theatre Arlington is one of the largest semi-professional, non-profit theaters in the Southwest with roots that date back to 1973 as a roaming theater group known as The Potluck Players.\n\nFifty years later, the staff and board of directors are still as dedicated to enhancing the quality of life in North Texas by presenting superior, diverse, artistic experiences through performance, production and education as they were during their humble beginnings.\n\nIn addition to a regular season featuring eight productions, an all-youth musical and a club series, the theater runs a year-round theater school including spring break and summer camps, and partners with the Arlington ISD and local community organizations to provide free and low-cost art enrichment programs for area children and teens. The theater is also proud to perform under an Actors’ Equity Small Professional Theatre contract. Theatre Arlington has become a key player in enriching the city’s cultural environment."
