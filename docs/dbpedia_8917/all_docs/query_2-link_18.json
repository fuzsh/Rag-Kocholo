Childs has also served as president of Chamber Music America from 2016 to 2022.\n\nMusic and spirituality have always been fully intertwined in the artistic vision of trumpeter, bandleader, composer, educator and activist Sean Jones. Singing and performing as a child with the church choir in his hometown of Warren, Ohio, Sean switched from the drums to the trumpet at the age of 10. Sean is a musical chameleon and is comfortable in any musical setting no matter what the role or the genre. He is equally adept in being a member of an ensemble as he is at being a bandleader. Sean turned a 6-month stint with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra into an offer from Wynton Marsalis for a permanent position as lead trumpeter, a post he held from 2004 until 2010. In 2015 Jones was tapped to become a member of the SFJAZZ Collective. During this time, Sean has managed to keep a core group of talented musicians together under his leadership forming the foundation for his groups that have produced and released eight recordings on the Mack Avenue Records, the latest is his 2017 release Sean Jones: Live from Jazz at the Bistro.\n\nPraised in The New York Times as “a singer with a strong and luscious tone,” vocalist, composer and arranger Alicia Olatuja (A-LEE-see-ah Oh-la-TU-ja) combines the earthy with the sublime, bringing a grounded relatability to genres as lofty as classical, as venerated as jazz, and as gritty as R&B. On her stunning Resilience Music Alliance debut, Intuition: Songs From The Minds Of Women, Olatuja lends her distinctive approach to celebrating the artistic output of noted female composers. Olatuja’s vocal excellence stunned a global audience of millions during the second inauguration ceremony for President Barack Obama in 2013 with a soaring featured solo during the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir’s rendition of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.” Her pristine voice and poise made a visible impact on the dignitaries in attendance, with reporters and social media lavishing her with praise. “\n\nrebroadcast\n\nMay 10, 2024\n\nMay 12, 2024\n\nMiles in May\n\nJoin a dynamic quintet featuring some of St. Louis’ finest as they pay homage to Alton-born, East St. Louis-raised trumpeter, composer, and bandleader Miles Davis.
