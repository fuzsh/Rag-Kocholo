Given those circumstances, these guys, to me, have proven something.

Langford is on thinner ice than expected this early with a trip to Dallas representing a big opportunity for him to fend off Ka’Deem Carey and Jordan Howard. The Cowboys are a middle of the road run defense, but the fear is that Langford fits the same description.\n\nTwo days before the Champions Trophy had kicked off in England, it emerged in the media that India captain Kohli had told BCCI officials that some players were uncomfortable with the “intimidating” style of Kumble’s man management.
