        "text": "Estée got her start selling skin care and makeup in beauty salons, demonstrating her products on women while they were sitting under hair dryers. In 1946 she and Joseph Lauder officially launched the company, and a year later they got their first major order: $800 worth of products from Saks Fifth Avenue.\n\nKnowing What Women Want\n\nEstée had innate instincts for what women wanted and was the consummate saleswoman and marketer. She believed that to make a sale, you had to touch the consumer, show her the results on her face and explain the products. That was the start of the company’s personal High-Touch service.\n\nShe took the \"Gift with Purchase\" idea to new heights, elevating it such that it became standard industry practice.\n\nOnce the Estée Lauder brand began to advertise, Estée insisted that the print images be both aspirational and approachable and selected one model to represent the face of the brand at any given time. She picked the pale turquoise color for the brand’s jars, believing it conveyed a sense of luxury and matched all bathroom decors.\n\nEstée attended the opening of virtually every new store and stayed for a week to instruct her beauty advisors on sales techniques and merchandise display. Always stylish and well dressed, she crossed the country to meet with store buyers and beauty editors and to talk to consumers. She was a one-person research department.\n\nEstée was the quintessential entrepreneur who refused to listen to experts or settle for anything less than the very best. She constantly challenged the status quo and is described as someone you simply couldn’t say no to.\n\nShe oversaw the creation of five additional brands — Aramis, Clinique, Prescriptives, Lab Series and Origins — and always insisted that the Company’s products be made from the highest-quality ingredients.\n\nAn American Icon\n\nEstée Lauder was an iconic American entrepreneur. She was always in the know about fashion trends, and founded her namesake brand at a time when Givenchy, Chanel, Dior, Balenciaga and other designers were shaping the latest fashions. She loved New York City and drew inspiration from its sophisticated, vibrant, stylish culture. In the middle of the 20th century, New York was the global center for art, architecture, innovation and entrepreneurship. Although Estée's heart was in New York, she had homes in the South of France, London and Palm Beach, among other locales. She traveled the world and loved to visit museums and art galleries, attend fashion shows and learn about her customers and their respective cultures.\n\nHer Inspiration Today\n\nThe world has changed dramatically since Estée Lauder created her brand in 1946. But the core values she embodied are more relevant and more inspiring to women of all generations than ever before. Today the Company engages with women in more than 150 countries and territories and at dozens of touch points — both in stores and online. And each relationship consistently reflects Estée’s powerful and authentic convictions and unique point of view."
