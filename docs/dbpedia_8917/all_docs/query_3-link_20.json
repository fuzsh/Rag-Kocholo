        "text": "British actress Emilia Clarke was born in London and grew up in Oxfordshire, England. Her father was a theatre sound engineer and her mother is a businesswoman. Her father was working on a theatre production of \"Show Boat\" and her mother took her along to the performance. This is when, at the age of 3, her passion for acting began. From 2000 to 2005, she attended St. Edward's School of Oxford, where she appeared in two school plays. She went on to study acting at the prestigious Drama Centre London, where she took part in 10 plays. During this time, Emilia first appeared on television with a guest role in the BBC soap opera Doctors (2000).\n\nIn 2010, after graduating from the Drama Centre London, Emilia got her first film role in the television movie Triassic Attack (2010). In 2011, her breakthrough role came in when she replaced fellow newcomer Tamzin Merchant on Game of Thrones: Das Lied von Eis und Feuer (2011) after the filming of the original pilot episode. From March to April 2013, she played Holly Golightly in a Broadway production of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" She played Sarah Connor in Terminator - Genisys (2015), opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jai Courtney and Jason Clarke. She played the lead role of Louisa Clark in the romantic comedy blockbuster Ein ganzes halbes Jahr (2016) and went on to star in Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) as Qi'ra.\n\nSince her rise to prominence, Emilia has contributed to various charitable organizations. In 2018, she was named as the ambassador to the Royal College of Nursing because of her efforts in raising awareness about the working condition of the nurses in the UK. In 2019, she was named as the first ambassador for the global Nursing Now campaign. In 2019, in a personal essay published in The New Yorker, Emilia revealed that she had suffered from two life threatening brain aneurysms in 2011 and 2013. She launched her own charity SameYou in 2019, which aims to broaden neurorehabilitation access for young people after a brain injury or stroke.\n\nActress and model Teresa Palmer has gathered some impressive film credits. She was born in Adelaide, South Australia, to Kevin Palmer, an investor, and Paula Sanders, a former missionary and nurse. She completed high school at Mercedes College in 2003, where she was a popular student who was well-known for her practical jokes. She worked in a Cotton On outlet in Rundle Mall until she was discovered and cast on the spot--without an audition--in her feature film debut and breakthrough role in 2:37 - Two Thirty Seven (2006). Made by first-time writer/director/producer Murali K. Thalluri, the film competed in the 2006 Cannes Film Festival in \"Un Certain Regard\" and chronicles the lives of six students over the course of day and ends in a devastating suicide.\n\nTeresa immediately went to work on back-to-back film projects including December Boys (2007) opposite \"Harry Potter\" star Daniel Radcliffe--a coming-of-age story about four adolescent orphans, based on the book by Michael Noonan and directed by Rod Hardy (Robinson Crusoe (1997), Buffalo Girls (1995), Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993) and Practice: Die Anwälte (1997)). She also starred as stripper-turned-criminal \"Dale\" in the British/Australian co-production Restraint - Wenn die Angst zur Falle wird (2008), a film noir/psychological thriller that follows the plight of a pair of fugitives on the run from a murder scene. Directed by David Denneen, the film also features former Calvin Klein model Travis Fimmel and British actor Stephen Moyer. In 2006 Teresa worked with Japanese director Takashi Shimizu on the Sony Pictures production Der Fluch - The Grudge 2 (2006). Set in Tokyo, the horror sequel to the box-office hit Der Fluch - The Grudge (2004) also starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jennifer Beals. Later that year Teresa signed on to play the female lead in Doug Liman's action fantasy film Jumper (2008), but was subsequently replaced by Rachel Bilson.\n\nEarly 2007 saw her star opposite former boyfriend Topher Grace as the love interest in the retro comedy film Take Me Home Tonight (2011). Shortly after filming ended, Teresa decided to move permanently from Adelaide to Los Angeles following a public split from her then-boyfriend of two years, Australian Rules football star Stuart Dew. Teresa was due to play a small part in George Miller's doomed superhero film \"Justice League: Mortal\", but the production fell through after months of problems. Teresa briefly dated her \"Justice League: Mortal\" co-star Adam Brody in early 2008; later that year she had a relationship with British comedian Russell Brand, whom she met on the set of her latest film, Bedtime Stories (2008), a Disney children's comedy starring Lucy Lawless, Guy Pearce and Keri Russell and was released on Christmas 2008.\n\nDakota Mayi Johnson is an American actress and fashion model.

The film was directed by her stepfather, Antonio Banderas, but it wasn't a hit. Dakota resumed her schooling and waited several years before she decided to become a professional actress and model. In 2006, she was voted Miss Golden Globe, a launching pad bestowed on off-spring of famous parents. She served as the first second-generation Miss Golden Globe in the Globes' history, since her mother was Miss Golden Globe in 1975. She also signed with IMG Models. In 2009, she modeled for MANGO brand's jeans line. Dakota traveled to Sydney, Australia, where she shot the \"Rising Star\" campaign for fashion label, \"Wish\". Once she graduated from high school, she signed with the William Morris Agency and started her acting career.

The film received eight Oscar nominations, including one for Best Picture.

She also won the female lead in Chris Nelson's, film Reine Männersache (2014), written by Alan Yang. Her first television show, Ben and Kate (2012), where she played \"Kate\", aired on Fox during the Fall 2012 season. It was canceled in 2013, and she quickly resumed her feature film career with three high-profile films: Need for Speed (2014), Anarchie (2014), the modern-day adaptation of the William Shakespeare play, \"Cymbeline\", and the starring role of \"Anastasia Steele\" in Fifty Shades Of Grey (2015), the adaptation of the best-selling erotic novel, \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". She beat out many young actresses for the coveted role of Anastasia, and the film became a worldwide hit, making her a star. She won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress for \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". She also starred in the two sequels to the hit film. She has continued to seek challenging roles, such as of a young mother who loses her son in Black Mass (2015) opposite her \"21 Jump Street\" castmate Johnny Depp, and of a temptress in A Bigger Splash (2015). She has balanced her dramatic career by doing comedies as well, such as How to Be Single - Welcome to the Party (2016). She acted in the hit independent film The Peanut Butter Falcon (2019). She co-produced some of the films that she acted in: Am I OK? (2022) (where she played a lesbian); Cha Cha Real Smooth (2022) (where she played mother to an autistic daughter); and Daddio (2023) (where she and Sean Penn are the only two principal actors in the entire film). She won good notices for playing a mother looking for her lost daughter in Frau im Dunkeln (2021), a film that received several Oscar nominations. She played the title role in the Marvel-adventure Madame Web (2024) and in the period film adaptation of the Jane Austen novel Überredung (2022), both films directed by first time women film directors. She also became the first female member of her family when she turned director by co-directing the music video to the song \"Cry Cry Cry\" by the band Coldplay\n\nNew York City-born Erin Moriarty launched her acting career in a way many hopefuls dream of: with an awards-recognized project. Erin first appeared on screen in the Emmy-nominated soap opera Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968) in 2010, playing the character Whitney Bennett in six episodes. In 2011 she built on her TV work with a guest role in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999).\n\nThe following year, Erin landed a small part in her first feature film.

In 2016's Captain Fantastic: Einmal Wildnis und zurück (2016), starring Viggo Mortensen, she played the supporting role of Claire in the film festival favorite about the changing dynamics of a unique family.

During her University days, she learned to play violin and tap dance. Her fascination for arts was not confined only to stage performance. She learned clay and ceramic pottery as well later in her graduation days.\n\nAfter she completed her graduation, Rothe started focusing on her acting career. Her theatre background did help her a lot in bagging some roles in films and television, but soon she realized that stage acting is quite different than the film acting.
