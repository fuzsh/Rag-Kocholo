        "text": "PISCATAWAY, N.J. – Rutgers football has seven representatives on the Shrine Bowl 1000 released Monday. The list is a collection of the top 1,000 all-star game eligible players at the FBS, FCS, Division II, Division III and NAIA levels, and serves as an early look into the scouting process ahead of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nKESSAWN ABRAHAM\n\nAbraham enters 2023 with 42 games of experience, totaling 63 tackles with 10 pass breakups. The defensive back was voted the team's MVP – Defense in 2021. That season he collected three tackles-for-loss, including one on a fourth down late in the fourth quarter at Illinois to help seal the victory. The New York native returned a blocked PAT 85 yards for a defensive two-point conversion against Maryland. He was graded out as First Team All-Big Ten by Pro Football Focus.\n\nNASEIM BRANTLEY\n\nBrantley is in his first season with the Scarlet Knights. The wide receiver owns 41 games of collegiate experience as an all-conference pick in each of the last three seasons. He has averaged 16 yards per reception during his career with 135 catches for 2,154 yards and 17 touchdowns. In 2022 at Western Illinois, the Farmingdale, New Jersey, native was selected Second Team FCS All-America by Phil Steele after recording 893 receiving yards with nine scores.\n\nDEION JENNINGS\n\nJennings collected a team-high 91 tackles last season, recording 8.5 for loss with six pass breakups. The 8.3 tackles per game ranked seventh in the league, posting four games with at least 10. The linebacker capped the season with 12 stops, three tackles-for-loss, a sack and two pass breakups at Maryland and won the Homer Hazel Award as the team's most valuable player.\n\nAARON LEWIS\n\nLewis emerged on the defensive line with 55 tackles with eight for loss in 2022. He posted a career high with 11 tackles, two in the backfield, and a forced fumble in the road win over Temple, adding sacks versus Nebraska and Penn State. The performance earned Third Team All-Big Ten in the coaches' vote.\n\nMAX MELTON\n\nMelton, who collected honorable mention All-Big Ten last season, contributed on both defense and special teams, posting 10 pass breakups, two interceptions, 33 tackles and a nation-leading three blocked punts in 2022. The blocked punt versus Michigan led to a touchdown. He also recovered a fumble on punt coverage in playing all 12 games. The Mays Landing, New Jersey, native ranked seventh in the Big Ten in passes defended per game (1.0).\n\nHOLLIN PIERCE\n\nPierce enters 2023 having started the last 24 games over the past two seasons. He was named a candidate in 2022 for the Burlsworth Trophy, which honors the most outstanding football player who began career as a walk-on and has shown outstanding performance on the field.\n\nTYREEM POWELL\n\nPowell started all 12 games at linebacker last season and totaled 71 tackles with six for loss. That included four or more stops in every game, being in on a tackle-for-loss in seven contests and posting sacks against Boston College, Iowa and Ohio State. The Vineland, New Jersey, native added four pass breakups, collecting a career-high nine tackles at Michigan State.\n\nSeason tickets are on sale for the home slate this fall, which features four games at SHI Stadium in September. The Scarlet Knights open the season Sunday, Sept. 3 at home versus Northwestern.\n\nFollow Rutgers football on Twitter (@RFootball & @RutgersFBfans), Facebook (/RFootballShow) and Instagram (@rfootball) for the latest news and updates.
