        "text": "The D-Day invasion, fought on the beaches of Normandy, France, was far from the inviting shores of the Cape Fear region. But the decisive military battle involved hometown boys, and its aftermath rippled across the Atlantic, affecting lives here.\n\nFollowing are some of those stories:\n\nDavid G. Martin, Navy Commissaryman 3rd class, was astounded after departing the embarkation port of Weymouth, England, to join the mightiest armada of combat vessels the world has ever seen.\n\nThe beach was a maelstrom of bodies and debris, the water's edge tinted red with blood. By then German resistance had greatly diminished, and he never fired his weapon or was fired upon.\n\n\"You could just about walk across the English Channel by stepping on the ships.\"\n\nThe Wilmington native, a crewman on the tank landing ship LST-533, hauled troops and supplies ashore on Omaha Beach in follow-on waves on D-Day.\n\nLST-533 loaded wounded Americans and prisoners of war and returned to England. Two surgeons were \"working as hard as they could\" operating on the tank deck.\n\nPetty Officer Martin let a wounded man sleep in his bunk, for which he was reprimanded. The man died right there.\n\nIn coming days the ship made more than 30 such crossings, ferrying supplies and reinforcement troops inbound and wounded and POWs outbound.\n\nMr. Martin, retired from the Babcock & Wilcox company, lives in the Seagate community of New Hanover County.\n\nAs if the boat trip from ship to shore hadn't nearly wrenched the spirits of most men, surviving soldiers of the U.S. 5th Engineers Special Brigade scrambling onto Omaha Beach immediately faced a terrifying reality.\n\nCounter to what they expected, they found the obstacle-packed sand, lacking natural cover, devoid of bomb craters for use as shelters. Americans either dug quickly for scant protection or exposed themselves to raking enemy gunfire.\n\n2nd Lt. William G. \"Bill\" Pepe, who now lives in Hampstead, holds that black mark against the Air Force to this day. The plan was for bombers to create craters along the strand for the assault troops. Instead, partly because of smoke and untimely coordination, the bombers deposited their loads miles inland. \"No craters as had been promised,\" he recalled.\n\nLt. Pepe, a mines and booby traps officer, carried orders to clear bunkers for establishing interim field headquarters and to help lead the 1st Infantry Division off the beach via designated exits. His unit had a 14-day mission. Instead it lasted three months.\n\n\"None of us could be considered 'combat ready,'\" Lt. Pepe later wrote. \"Just when we start thinking that nothing could be worse than the hell ... shells from onshore enemy batteries start falling in and around our assault wave. The full impact ... is not apparent until the landing craft on our right disappears ... that only a nanosecond ago was alive with frightened but eager young men.\n\n\"Seasickness is all but forgotten now and all we want is to get off this water-borne death trap.\"He continued: \"So here am I with a bunch of other civilians, in olive drab, playing at soldiering, facing an adversary tenaciously determined to deny us free access. ... No amount of training could adequately prepare us for the unspeakable horrors that lay ahead.\"\n\nFourteen days. Three months. Job done.\n\n'The liberation of Europe has begun'\n\nIn spring 1944, the life of 9-year-old Raymond C. Williams was unlike anything most people in Wilmington could imagine.\n\nNow a resident of Carolina Beach where he retired after 44 years with IBM, the British boy lived with his parents in the village of Lindfield in Sussex, England, near where his father, Capt. Ernest Williams, was headquartered with the 2nd Canadian Corps.\n\nLocated 12 and 20 miles from the eventual main Canadian D-Day embarkation ports of Newhaven and Shoreham, respectively, \"The place was seething with troops and trucks,\" he said. \"We knew something big was going on. We knew the tension was building. There was a complete news blackout. . Anyone living within 25 miles of the coast was restricted and couldn't travel from the area, only to go to the market.\"\n\nCanadians, Frenchmen, Poles, Czechs and British soldiers swarmed the area, each wearing the British uniform with his country's flag patch.\n\nOn the morning of June 6, he hadn't seen his father for days, even though his station was one mile down the road. The captain phoned his mother and told her to turn on the radio.\n\nThey listened as announcer John Snagg made the official BBC proclamation: \"This morning, units of the Allied Expeditionary Forces have landed on the coast of France. The liberation of Europe has begun.\"\n\n\"He spoke in very measured tones, no emotion, so British.\"\n\nOne day the fields were full of tents. The next day they were gone.\n\nNo mention of any return\n\nThe mighty spectacle of vessels 3,000 feet beneath him seeming to reach into forever did little to redirect the attention of Staff Sgt. Richard M. Griswald from a speech heard a short time before.\n\nTo Sgt. Griswald, 23, turret gunner in a crew of three flying an Air Force twin-engine A-20 Havoc light bomber over the English Channel on a bombing mission supporting the D-Day landings, the message reverberated in his ears.\n\nThe colonel commanding his 416th Bomb Group conveyed instructions in no uncertain terms. \"He expected every man in every plane to get to the target and hit it. He did not mention any return. He wanted no one to abort the mission.\" He demanded success regardless of losses.\n\nThe target: a busy crossroads near Caen, Normandy, through which the Germans must pass to rush vehicle, troop and supply units to reinforce the beaches.\n\nTaking off at 1 p.m. from their 9th Air Force base at Wethersfield, England, 56 Havocs sped at low altitudes toward Caen, some 15 kilometers south of the Canadian Juno and British Sword beaches. The trip didn't take long.\n\nBombing from 1,700 feet, \"We had a very good target hit on that mission,\" he remembered..\n\nSurprisingly they encountered neither enemy aircraft nor anti-aircraft flak, and his plane escaped damage and fired no guns.\n\nThe Maryland native paid in other action. Previously he received the Purple Heart for flak wounds while crewing a B-26 Marauder medium bomber. His A-20 later was shot down in a run over Brest, France. The three bailed out: \"Once was enough.\" Americans rescued the pilot and him, but the gunner was captured.\n\nMr. Griswald, also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (for 52 missions) and Air Medal, retired from the U.S. Postal Service. He moved to Wilmington in 1999.\n\nOne survivor in 19-man stick\n\nIn the early hours of June 6, 1944, Staff Sgt. Walter Horace Barrett was No. 18 in his stick of 19 paratroopers in a C-47 Skytrain transport heading for their target on the Cotentin Peninsula over France.\n\nAs the men hooked to the static line preparing to jump, suddenly German anti-aircraft fire blew off the door. Stunned and shaken, Sgt. Barrett saw that everyone except No. 19 behind him lay on the floor, presumed dead.\n\nImmediately he stepped over the bodies and jumped as if into a swimming pool, his mate following. That man was killed in action later that day. Mr. Barrett believes he was the lone survivor, including the air crew.\n\nHe jumped from less than 1,000 feet toward a landing zone inland of Utah Beach, the westernmost Normandy assault beach.\n\n\"I saw tracers coming at me, didn't hang there long and hit the ground quickly. It was the lowest I ever recall jumping.\"\n\nLanding in a cattle field, he cut free his parachute and took off for the nearest hedgerow. Someone fired at him. He challenged the dark form: \"Flash-Flash.\" The countersign: \"Thunder-Victor.\" The man was from his company.\n\nThe two left the hedgerow as Sgt. Barrett assembled the three components of his M-1 rifle. It was about 3:30 a.m. June 6.\n\nAfter rounding up five more paratroopers at daybreak and seeking to determine their location, they soon collected a \"duke's mixture\" of stragglers, including men from the 101st Airborne and a downed pilot, on high ground between Picauville and Chef-du-Pont five kilometers west of Sainte-Mere-Eglise.\n\nThere on Hill 30, from which the Germans controlled access to two causeways interdicting intentionally flooded fields, Sgt. Barrett engaged in his first firefight near a schoolhouse. Several comrades went down. Naval gunfire support leveled the structure.\n\nHe saw heavily laden dead paratroopers bobbing in the fields \"like big water lilies. The guys didn't have a chance to get out.\" The Americans rushed the Chef-du-Pont causeway defensive position, destroying it with a bazooka.\n\nGerman artillery air bursts rained down. \"They were exploding right over our heads.\" A shell hit the tree above him, fragments tearing his right leg. A medic attended him, but he could not keep up with the moving group. Along with other wounded, Sgt. Barrett remained at Hill 30 for help. Unarmed, they were left at the mercy of the enemy. A French woman brought him a boiled duck egg and sausage. \"Eating was not a priority. You were so tired.\"\n\nOver the next day or so, both sides called a truce to administer to wounded. Soon he was aboard a truck headed through Sainte-Mere-Eglise for evacuation at Utah Beach. \"All the devastation was still there\" - rows after rows of hundreds of stretchers.\n\nSoon he boarded a tank landing ship headed back to a hospital in Southampton, England. Later he fought in Holland in Operation Market Garden and in Belgium in the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nMr. Barrett, whose memoir is titled My Story, is retired from AT&T and lives in Holden Beach. The French government will present Mr. Pepe, Mr. Barrett, Cliff Goodall of Hampstead and other D-Day veterans with a commemorative medal during anniversary ceremonies in France.\n\nThe junkyard\n\nEight days after wading ashore waist-deep in its blazing hell, a badly wounded Pvt. John A. Lewis bade a welcomed goodbye to bloody Omaha Beach. \"It looked like a junkyard the last time I saw it.\"\n\nAs far as he could see lay piles of dead American soldiers, 5 to 6 feet high.\n\nThe 19-year-old Pender County native, drafted after working at the local shipyard, landed in France with the 116th Infantry Regiment of the 29th Infantry Division in the first assault wave on the hottest Normandy beach.\n\n\"It was such chaos. The waves and mines were blowing the boats apart and up and down.\" Scenes in the movie Saving Private Ryan graphically portrayed the 29th's deathly assault.\n\nA few comrades were in front of him on the beach.\n\n\"I got down on my belly and stuck my nose in the sand. I stayed on the beach all day. Every time someone stood up they would get cut down.\" That happened to his sergeant right beside him and a lieutenant nearby.\n\nAssigned to a five-man demolition team, Pvt. Lewis carried his regular pack, M-1 rifle, grenades and ammo, plus 40 blocks of TNT. Their job: Destroy German bunkers and pillboxes. He used 20 blocks against one that barely nudged. \"It was like hitting them with a firecracker.\"\n\nThe beach slope ahead was fairly flat. The omnipresent Omaha cliffs loomed on the right. Eventually he made his way up the hill, went inland about a mile inquiring about his company, hooked up with some Rangers and dug in after dark with six men. Five died in their foxholes that night. He had gone all day without firing a shot.\n\nOn D+7 (June 13), while acting as lead scout on patrol among hedgerows, a sniper's bullet shattered his left arm. The wound dispatched him back to England and then the United States via one last look at his entryway to Europe. Eighteen months later he was discharged. The arm, shorter by two inches than the right, still pains. Straightening his fingers remains difficult, but as he says, he has lived with it for 60 years now.\n\nAfter the war Mr. Lewis returned to Wilmington for a career as a traveling salesman, until retiring from Hughes Bros. automotive store and Schaeffer Buick. He lives in Rocky Point in Pender County.\n\nCity Desk: 343-2312\n\ncitydesk@starnewsonline.com"
