        "text": "Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead.\n\nPop & Rock\n\nMADISON CUNNINGHAM at Le Poisson Rouge (Jan. 28-29, 8 p.m.). The road from Orange County, Calif., to Los Angeles runs about 35 miles; for this singer-songwriter, that distance came to symbolize the gap between her and her dreams. In her timeless, narrative-driven folk-rock songs, Cunningham has written about the siren call that drew her from her hometown in pursuit of a music career. Cunningham’s sophomore album, “Who Are You Now,” earned her a Grammy nomination and an opening slot on Mandy Moore’s comeback tour. Ahead of those dates, she performs two sold-out nights in Manhattan. Tickets are available on the resale market.\n\nlpr.com\n\nDEERHOOF at Elsewhere (Jan. 28, 8 p.m.). Breezing past the quarter-century mark, this four piece from San Francisco has yet to lose the inventive instinct that fueled their early noise improvisations. Deerhoof have earned a reputation as one of indie rock’s most exciting and least predictable acts with more than a dozen albums that spill into stylistic margins, stirring strands of arena rock, avant-jazz and more into a winning blend of punkish instrumentals and chipper vocals. In honor of the band’s recent anniversary, three of their early records have received their first-ever vinyl release; expect to see copies on the merch table when the band performs in Bushwick, Brooklyn, on Tuesday.\n\nelsewherebrooklyn.com\n\nTHE LOUD EXPERIENCE at Radio City Music Hall (Jan. 30, 8 p.m.). In the 1990s, Loud Records was a major power in a flourishing rap industry, boasting a roster that included Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep and Twista. Sold to Sony in 2002, the label was later bought back and revived by its founder, Steve Rifkind, just in time to release anniversary editions of some of its biggest hits, including Big Pun’s “Capital Punishment” and Wu-Tang Clan’s debut, “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).” Loud is celebrating its 25th anniversary with this all-star showcase at Radio City. The lineup includes Wu-Tang and Mobb Deep, and a tribute to Big Pun, who died in 2000, by Fat Joe and an as-yet-unannounced guest.\n\n800-745-3000, radiocity.com\n\nJULIAN LYNCH at Trans-Pecos (Jan. 28, 8 p.m.). A hyper-productive solo artist starting around 2008, this songwriter slowed his clip considerably five years later, focusing his energy on other projects. Among them were an ethnomusicology doctorate and a new role in the indie-rock outfit Real Estate, whose lead guitar duties he assumed after Matt Mondanile was deposed in 2016. Last year, Lynch returned to his own project, releasing a new record, “Rat’s Spit,” in January. On it, Lynch displays more mainstream proclivities, through cleaner vocals and more predictable song structures, without forsaking his well-documented love of drifting instrumentals.\n\nadhoc.fm\n\n‘NUEVO NOISE’ at Elsewhere (Jan. 27, 7 p.m.). Designed to kick-start the careers of emerging Latinx artists, this series from the Latin culture platform Remezcla highlights three rising indie-pop singers on Monday night. Topping the bill is Loyal Lobos, the project of the Colombian-American songwriter Andrea Silva, whose recent Teddy Geiger-produced single, “Criminals,” features her dreamy vocals atop atmospheric instrumentals. Angelica Garcia, an Angeleno who writes vibrant, genre-blurring songs about the bicultural experience and is set to release her sophomore album next month, also performs. And the pop experimentalist Jackie Mendoza rounds out the lineup.\n\nelsewherebrooklyn.com\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
