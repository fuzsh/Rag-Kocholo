        "text": "For the first time since 1806, a solar eclipse spanning 300 miles will put parts of Ohio in 100% totality – a rare phenomenon that’s not expected to happen again until 2099. With Columbus in 99.6% near-totality, the Ohio’s capital is gearing up for a (literally) out-of-this-world April 8th with a busy calendar of viewing parties, educational events, themed food and beer releases, rooftop soirées, outdoor family “solar-brations” and more. This Monday, get those eclipse glasses and check out one of the otherworldly events listed below.\n\nSee the Eclipse at One of Columbus’ Top Attractions\n\nThe COSI Solar Eclipse Experience 2024\n\n1 p.m. – 4 p.m.\n\nHead to COSI, Central Ohio’s premier science and industry museum, for an eclipse viewing party at 99.6% totality! There will be free solar eclipse glasses, a solar and lunar eclipse tutorial with “Dr. B in 3,” a new Eclipse: The Musical video and hands-on Science, Technology, Engineering, Art & Architecture and Math (STEAM) activities for all ages. Bonus? To make sure you don’t miss a thing, COSI will live stream the Great American Eclipse from 100% totality.\n\nSolar Eclipse Solar-Bration at Columbus Zoo and Aquarium\n\nNoon – 4 p.m.\n\nThis solar-bration is for science and animal lovers alike. Watch the eclipse from the beautiful Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, where there will be Character Ambassadors, hands-on activities and educational tools from COSI, a trivia game hosted by Columbus Recreation and Parks, special “SUNdaes” from Velvet Ice Cream and prizes from Sunny Street Café. Because this natural phenomenon is such a rare event, the zoo’s Animal Care team and The Ohio State University (OSU) School of Environment and Natural Resources researchers will be onsite to conduct the zoo’s first-ever animal observational study during a solar eclipse. Stop by the research station to see what they learn!\n\nSolar Eclipse Day at the National Veterans Memorial and Museum\n\n10 a.m. – 5 p.m.\n\nThe National Veterans Memorial and Museum has partnered with the NASA Solar System Ambassadors program for a Great American Eclipse viewing like no other. Visit the museum for a range of educational activities, including guessing how far the earth is from the moon and the sun, fun NASA giveaways and the chance to design your very own military and NASA patches. Then, head to the rooftop and watch the celestial event.\n\nSolar Eclipse 2024 Watch Party at the Columbus Main Library\n\n1 p.m. – 4 p.m.\n\nAdmire the phenomenon from the front lawn of Columbus Main Library! To really make it a party, COSI will be onsite before and after the eclipse with fun science activities for all ages.\n\nExperience the Eclipse in a Nearby Columbus Community\n\nWesterville\n\n2 p.m. – 4 p.m.\n\nGrab your blankets, chairs and – of course – those glasses and go to Hoff Woods Park in Westerville. Wind your way to the back of the park and you’ll find yard games, a DJ, a photo booth, arts and crafts, live video footage from NASA and even a telescope that you can use to view the eclipse. Get there early! The first 500 families will get a gift bag with Moon Pies, Sun Chips and Capri Sun.\n\nHilliard\n\n1 p.m. – 3:30 p.m.\n\nSpend your Monday afternoon at the Total Eclipse at the Park party at Hilliard Station Park, in Downtown Hilliard. Gear up for the eclipse with fire jugglers, mirror dancers, a DJ, trivia, giveaways, astronaut photo opps, Space Age-themed snacks, light-up balloon twisting, yard games, glitter tattoos and more.\n\nNew Albany\n\n1 p.m. – 5 p.m.\n\nAll are welcome to watch the celestial event from The Solar Eclipse Experience at Bevelhymer Park, in New Albany. There will be food trucks, kids’ educational activities and more, and the first 2,000 attendees will get free eclipse glasses.\n\nWorthington\n\nStarting at 2 p.m.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to experience the Great American Eclipse in Worthington. From 2 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., visit Northwest Library to make pinhole eclipse viewers and play cosmic trivia, or stop by Old Worthington Library between 2:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. for eclipse-themed crafts and activities. Just want to watch? Head to the newly-renovated, 25-acre McCord Park, where there’s free parking and plenty of room to lay down a blanket and look up at the sun.\n\nSip and Savor the Eclipse at Local Restaurants, Bars and Breweries\n\nBrass Eye at The Junto\n\nStarting at 4 p.m.\n\nVisit Brass Eye, on the rooftop of The Junto hotel, for Solar Sips with Spellbound Wines. Diners who are there to gaze at the celestial phenomenon will get their choice of a complimentary tasting glass of Spellbound Cabernet Sauvignon Eclipse, Chardonnay Eclipse or Petite Syrah Eclipse, as well as a pair of Spellbound eclipse glasses to watch the event safely. While you’re there, definitely try the rooftop bar’s new food menu – the Double Smash Burger, Brass Snacks and The Butter Cake with honey butter and a cream cheese Anglaise will leave your taste buds as spellbound as your eyes.\n\nLand-Grant Brewing Co.\n\n11 a.m. – 6 p.m.\n\nLand-Grant Brewing is inviting eclipse viewers to come enjoy a free, all-day celebration with food trucks, cosmic music, interactive experiments with COSI representatives and an exclusive COSI collaboration Black IPA on tap: Totality. Get there early – the first 4,000 guests get free eclipse glasses!\n\nJeni’s Splendid Ice Creams\n\nAnytime\n\nIt’s always a good day when you have Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams – and just for the eclipse, our homegrown dessert darling is launching four “out-of-this-world” scoops to celebrate the occasion. As Jeni tells it, the “Punk Stargonaut” collection represents a fictional flight through the galaxy, where her team “gathered all the alien fruit they could find and brought it back to Earth to turn them into colorful, cosmic ice creams.” Stop by your nearest Jeni’s storefront and try Nebula Berry (a hot pink scoop with a blue center, blueberry and raspberry flavors and huge pieces of fruit), Cosmic Bloom (a citrusy ice cream with mandarin, kiwi, and passion fruit flavors), Purple Star Born (a violet-hued, Concord grape scoop with blackcurrants) and Supermoon (a returning fan favorite that tastes like cereal milk and marshmallows). For a real treat, top them all with Jeni’s Space Dust, a fizzy popping candy available for a limited time only.\n\nRenaissance Columbus Downtown Hotel\n\nStarting at 1:30 p.m.\n\nReserve your seat for the one-of-a-kind Cosmic Food and Wine Pairing at the Renaissance Columbus Downtown Hotel, where a five-course pairing menu is timed perfectly to the different phases of the eclipse. View the eclipse while indulging in small plates and wines like Sunny With a Chance of Flowers bubbly rosé paired with “Lights Out” smoky BBQ boneless burnt ends, or Cosmic Egg Cabernet paired with the Blackout Slider with a dark mushroom peppercorn reduction and blue cheese. Are you drooling yet?\n\nSpecies X Beer Project\n\n11 a.m. – 9 p.m.\n\nWhat do you get when you mix artificial intelligence, neon lights and futuristically-good beer? Space X Beer Project. Go on April 8th for an all-day eclipse celebration with food and beer specials, new space-themed beers specifically for the eclipse, a live DJ and epic near-totality views from the taproom’s rooftop deck.\n\nVASO\n\n2 p.m. – 4 p.m.\n\nVASO always throws a party, and its swanky, rooftop terrace practically begs for solar eclipse solar-bration. For $75 per person, guests will get eclipse viewing glasses, two drink tickets, complimentary tapas stations, patio access and beats by DJ Dayna Sol."
