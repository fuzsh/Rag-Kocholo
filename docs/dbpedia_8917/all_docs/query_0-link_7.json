        "text": "With an almost unpronounceable surname and a thick Austrian accent, who would have ever believed that a brash, quick talking bodybuilder from a small European village would become one of Hollywood's biggest stars, marry into the prestigious Kennedy family, amass a fortune via shrewd investments and one day be the Governor of California!?\n\nThe amazing story of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true \"rags to riches\" tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of opportunity, the United States of America. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born Jadrny) and Gustav Schwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a keen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete in several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated to the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star began to rise.\n\nUp until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather oddball sport, or even a mis-understood \"freak show\" by the general public, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers Ben Weider and Joe Weider set about broadening the appeal of \"pumping iron\" and getting the sport respect, and what better poster boy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible \"Austrian Oak\", Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in 1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding winning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with it, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new international audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide swelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire flourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe. However, Schwarzenegger's horizons were bigger than just the landscape of bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as \"Arnold Strong\" in the low budget Hercules in New York (1970), then director Bob Rafelson cast Arnold in Mister Universum (1976) alongside Jeff Bridges and Sally Field, for which Arnold won a Golden Globe Award for \"Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\". The mesmerizing Pumping Iron (1977) covering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on to become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus Arnold landed other acting roles in the comedy Kaktus Jack (1979) opposite Kirk Douglas, and he portrayed Mickey Hargitay in the well- received TV movie Die Jayne Mansfield Story (1980).\n\nWhat Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a lavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him room to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor. Conan, der Barbar (1982) was just that role. Inspired by the Robert E. Howard short stories of the \"Hyborean Age\" and directed by gung ho director John Milius, and with a largely unknown cast, save Max von Sydow and James Earl Jones, \"Conan\" was a smash hit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled Conan der Zerstörer (1984) quickly followed. If \"Conan\" was the kick start to Arnold's movie career, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and accelerate his star status into overdrive. Director James Cameron had until that time only previously directed one earlier feature film titled Fliegende Killer - Piranha II (1982), which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for an actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator - Terminator (1984). Made on a relatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction thriller Terminator (1984) was incredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable film franchises in history. The dead pan phrase \"I'll be back\" quickly became part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in vogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold reap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals who used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done. The testosterone laden Phantom Kommando (1985), Der City Hai (1986), Predator (1987), Running Man (1987) and Red Heat (1988) were all box office hits and Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking winning scripts. The tongue-in-cheek comedy Twins - Zwillinge (1988) with co-star Danny DeVito was a smash and won Arnold new fans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle- bound actor once described by Australian author / TV host Clive James as \"a condom stuffed with walnuts\". The spectacular Total Recall - Die totale Erinnerung (1990) and \"feel good\" Kindergarten Cop (1990) were both solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to return to familiar territory with director James Cameron in Terminator 2: Tag der Abrechnung (1991). The second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget had grown from the initial film's $6.5 million to an alleged $100 million for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel bristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases & stunt sequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery. Terminator 2: Tag der Abrechnung (1991) was arguably the zenith of Arnold's film career to date and he was voted \"International Star of the Decade\" by the National Association of Theatre Owners.\n\nRemarkably, his next film Last Action Hero (1993) brought Arnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but confusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood action film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in droves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned back to good friend, director James Cameron and the chemistry was definitely still there as the \"James Bond\" style spy thriller True Lies - Wahre Lügen (1994) co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold was the surprise hit of 1994! Following the broad audience appeal of True Lies - Wahre Lügen (1994), Schwarzenegger decided to lean towards more family-themed entertainment with Junior (1994) and Versprochen ist versprochen (1996), but he still found time to satisfy his hard-core fan base with Eraser (1996), as the chilling \"Mr. Freeze\" in Batman & Robin (1997) and battling dark forces in the supernatural action of End of Days - Nacht ohne morgen (1999). The science fiction / conspiracy tale The 6th Day (2000) played to only mediocre fan interest, and Collateral Damage - Zeit der Vergeltung (2002) had its theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic events of Sept 11th 2001, but it still only received a lukewarm reception.\n\nIt was time again to resurrect Arnold's most successful franchise and, in 2003, Schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time for Terminator 3: Rebellion der Maschinen (2003). Unfortunately, directorial duties passed from James Cameron to Jonathan Mostow and the deletion of the character of \"Sarah Connor\" aka Linda Hamilton and a change in the actor playing \"John Connor\" - Nick Stahl took over from Edward Furlong - making the third entry in the \"Terminator\" series the weakest to date.\n\nSchwarzenegger married TV journalist Maria Shriver in April, 1986 and the couple have four children.\n\nIn October of 2003 Schwarzenegger, running as a Republican, was elected Governor of California in a special recall election of then governor Gray Davis. The \"Governator,\" as Schwarzenegger came to be called, held the office until 2011. Upon leaving the Governor's mansion it was revealed that he had fathered a child with the family's live-in maid and Shriver filed for divorce.\n\nSchwarzenegger contributed cameo roles to Welcome to the Jungle (2003), In 80 Tagen um die Welt (2004) and The Kid & I (2005). Recently, he starred in The Expendables 2 (2012), The Last Stand (2013), Escape Plan (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Terminator - Genisys (2015).\n\nThomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Janet Marylyn (Frager), a hospital worker, and Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook. His mother's family, originally surnamed \"Fraga\", was entirely Portuguese, while his father was of mostly English ancestry. Tom grew up in what he has called a \"fractured\" family. He moved around a great deal after his parents' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started.\n\nRon Howard was working on Splash: Jungfrau am Haken (1983), a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, which eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy Schlappe Bullen beißen nicht (1987), Hanks' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy Big (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor.\n\nHanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in Eine Klasse für sich (1992). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \"modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began for Hanks, first with Schlaflos in Seattle (1993) and then with Philadelphia (1993). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.\n\nIn Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.\n\nHanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster Forrest Gump (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.\n\nHanks' next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama Apollo 13 (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's computer-animated film Toy Story (1995), as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy That Thing You Do! (1996) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.\n\nAs of 2022, Hanks is 66-years-old. He has never retired from acting, and has remained active in the film industry for more than four decades.\n\nWilliam Bradley \"Brad\" Pitt was born on December 18, 1963 in Shawnee, Oklahoma and raised in Springfield, Missouri to Jane Etta Pitt (née Hillhouse), a school counselor & William Alvin \"Bill\" Pitt, a truck company manager. At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for El Pollo Loco.\n\nPitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma & Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This led to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) & Cool World (1992).\n\nBut Pitt's career hit an upswing with his casting in Aus der Mitte entspringt ein Fluß (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt's subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in True Romance (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as Interview mit einem Vampir (1994) and Legenden der Leidenschaft (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller Sieben (1995). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in 12 Monkeys (1995) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.\n\nPitt's portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama Troja (2004) helped establish his appeal as an action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). It was on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married Jennifer Aniston in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met Angelina Jolie. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence.\n\nHe continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as Megamind (2010) to adventurous critic-bait like Inglourious Basterds (2009) and The Tree of Life (2011). He has received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, for Der seltsame Fall des Benjamin Button (2008) and Die Kunst zu gewinnen - Moneyball (2011). In 2014, he starred in the war film Herz aus Stahl (2014), opposite Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Peña.\n\nPitt and Jolie have 6 children, 3 adopted & 3 biological.\n\nBenicio Del Toro emerged in the mid-1990s as one of the most watchable and charismatic character actors to come along in years. A favorite of film buffs, Del Toro gained mainstream public attention as the conflicted but basically honest Mexican policeman in Steven Soderbergh's Traffic - Macht des Kartells (2000).\n\nBenicio was born on February 19, 1967 in San Germán, Puerto Rico, the son of lawyer parents Fausta Genoveva Sanchez Rivera and Gustavo Adolfo Del Toro Bermudez. His mother died when he was young, and his father moved the family to a farm in Pennsylvania. A basketball player with an interest in acting, he decided to follow the family way and study business at the University of California in San Diego. A class in acting resulted in his being bitten by the acting bug, and he subsequently dropped out and began studying with legendary acting teacher Stella Adler in Los Angeles and at the Circle in the Square Acting School in New York City. Telling his parents that he was taking courses in business, Del Toro hid his new studies from his family for a little while.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, he made several television appearances, most notably in an episode of Miami Vice (1984) and in the NBC miniseries Das Camarena-Komplott (1990). Del Toro's big-screen career got off to a slower start, however--his first role was Duke the Dog-Faced Boy in Manege frei für Pee Wee (1988). However, things looked better when he landed the role of Dario, the vicious henchman in the James Bond film James Bond 007 - Lizenz zum Töten (1989). Surprising his co-stars at age 21, Del Toro was the youngest actor ever to portray a Bond villain. However, the potential break was spoiled as the picture turned out to be one of the most disappointing Bond films ever; this was lost amid bigger summer competition.\n\nBenicio gave creditable performances in many overlooked films for the next several years, such as Indian Runner (1991), Christopher Columbus - Der Entdecker (1992) and Money for Nothing (1993). His roles in Fearless - Jenseits der Angst (1993) and Eine heiße Affäre (1994) gained him more critical notices, and 1995 proved to be the first \"Year of Benicio\" as he gave a memorable performance in Unter Haien in Hollywood (1994) before taking critics and film buffs by storm as the mumbling, mysterious gangster in Die üblichen Verdächtigen (1995), directed by Bryan Singer. Del Toro won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor for the role in the Oscar-winning film.\n\nStaying true to his independent roots, he next gave a charismatic turn as cold-blooded gangster Gaspare Spoglia in Das Begräbnis (1996) directed by Abel Ferrara. He also appeared as Benny Dalmau in Basquiat (1996), directed by artist friend Julian Schnabel. That year also marked his first truly commercial film, as he played cocky Spanish baseball star Juan Primo in The Fan (1996), which starred Robert De Niro. Del Toro took his first leading man role in Ärger im Gepäck (1997), starring and produced by Alicia Silverstone. Hand-picked by Silverstone, Del Toro's performance was pretty much the only thing critics praised about the film, and showed the level of consciousness he was beginning to have in the minds of film fans.\n\nHe took a leading role with his good friend Johnny Depp in Angst und Schrecken in Las Vegas (1998), co-written and directed by the legendary Terry Gilliam. Gaining 40 pounds for the role of Dr. Gonzo, the drug-addicted lawyer to sportswriter Raoul Duke, Benicio immersed himself totally in the role. Using his method acting training so far as to burn himself with cigarettes for a scene, this was a trying time for Del Toro. The harsh critical reviews proved tough on him, as he felt he had given his all for the role and been dismissed. Many saw the crazed, psychotic performance as a confirmation of the rumors and overall weirdness that people seemed to place on Del Toro.\n\nTaking a short break after the ordeal, 2000 proved to be the second \"Year of Benicio\". He first appeared in Way of the Gun (2000), directed by friend and writer Christopher McQuarrie. Then he went to work for actor's director Steven Soderbergh in Traffic - Macht des Kartells (2000). A complex and graphic film, this nonetheless became a widespread success and Oscar winner. His role as conflicted Mexican policeman Javier Rodriguez functions as the movie's real heart amid an all-star ensemble cast, and many praised this as the year's best performance, a sentiment validated by a Screen Actor's Guild Award for \"Best Actor\". He also gave a notable performance in Snatch: Schweine und Diamanten (2000) directed by Guy Ritchie, which was released several weeks later, and Das Versprechen (2001) directed by Sean Penn. Possessing sleepy good looks reminiscent of James Dean or Marlon Brando, Del Toro has often jokingly been referred to as the \"Spanish Brad Pitt\".\n\nWith his newfound celebrity, Del Toro has become a sort of heartthrob, being voted one of People magazine's \"50 Most Beautiful People\" as well as \"Most Eligible Bachelors.\" A favorite of film fans for years for his diverse and \"cool guy\" gangster roles, he has become a mainstream favorite, respected for his acting skills and choices. So far very careful in his projects and who he works with, Del Toro can boast an impressive resume of films alongside some of the most influential and talented people in the film business.\n\nOne of the British theatre's most famous faces, Daniel Craig, who waited tables as a struggling teenage actor with the National Youth Theatre, has gone on to star as James Bond in Casino Royale (2006), James Bond 007: Ein Quantum Trost (2008), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015) and James Bond 007: Keine Zeit zu sterben (2021).\n\nHe was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O'Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig has English, as well as Irish, Scottish and Welsh, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Leben und sterben lassen (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.\n\nAt age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).\n\nCraig made his film debut in Im Glanz der Sonne (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in München (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as Bond.\n\nHe was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II at the 2022 Queen's New Years Honours for his services to Film and Theatre.\n\nCompact Italian-American actor Joe Pesci was born February 9, 1943 in Newark, New Jersey, to Mary (Mesce), a part-time barber, and Angelo Pesci, a bartender and forklift driver. Pesci first broke into entertainment as a child actor, and by the mid-1950s, was starring on the series \"Star Time Kids\". In the mid-1960s, he released a record under the stage name Joe Ritchie titled \"Little Joe Sure Can Sing\", and was also playing guitar with several bands, including Joey Dee and The Starliters. He even joined with his friend Frank Vincent to start a vaudeville-style comedy act, but met with limited success (interestingly, Pesci and Vincent would later go on to co-star in several gangster films together, including GoodFellas - Drei Jahrzehnte in der Mafia (1990) and Casino (1995).\n\nPesci's first film role was as an uncredited dancer in Twist... das die Röcke fliegen (1961) and then he had to wait another 15 years for a minor role in Blutiger Zahltag (1976). His work in the second film was seen by Robert De Niro, who convinced director Martin Scorsese to cast him as Joey LaMotta in the epic boxing film Wie ein wilder Stier (1980), which really got him noticed in Hollywood. He played opposite Rodney Dangerfield in Monty, der Millionenerbe (1983), was with buddy DeNiro again in Es war einmal in Amerika (1984), nearly stole the show as con man Leo Getz in Lethal Weapon 2 - Brennpunkt L.A. (1989) and scored a Best Supporting Actor Oscar playing the psychotic Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas (1990).\n\nHis comedic talents shone again in the mega-popular Kevin - Allein zu Haus (1990), and he put in a terrific performance as co-conspirator David Ferrie in JFK: Tatort Dallas (1991). Pesci was back again as Leo Getz for Lethal Weapon 3: Die Profis sind zurück (1992), and was still a bumbling crook in Kevin - Allein in New York (1992), and had a minor role in the Robert De Niro-directed In den Straßen der Bronx (1993). He was lured back by Scorsese to play another deranged gangster named Nicky (based on real-life hood Tony Spilotro [aka \"The Ant\"]) in the violent Casino (1995), and starred in the comedies Kopflos - 8 Köpfe im Koffer (1997) and Der $100.000 Fisch (1997), although both failed to fire at the box office.\n\nPesci returned again as fast-talking con man Leo Getz in Lethal Weapon 4 - Zwei Profis räumen auf (1998). In 1999, he announced his retirement from acting and since then, he appeared only occasionally in films, including a cameo appearance in Der gute Hirte (2006). He also appeared in the music documentary I Go Back Home: Jimmy Scott (2016).\n\nCleft-chinned, steely-eyed and virile star of international cinema who rose from being \"the ragman's son\" (the name of his best-selling 1988 autobiography) to become a bona fide superstar, Kirk Douglas, also known as Issur Danielovitch Demsky, was born on December 9, 1916 in Amsterdam, New York. His parents, Bryna (Sanglel) and Herschel Danielovitch, were Jewish immigrants from Chavusy, Mahilyow Voblast (now in Belarus). Although growing up in a poor ghetto, Douglas was a fine student and a keen athlete and wrestled competitively during his time at St. Lawrence University. Professional wrestling helped pay for his studies as did working on the side as a waiter and a bellboy. However, he soon identified an acting scholarship as a way out of his meager existence, and was sufficiently talented to gain entry into the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He made his Broadway debut in \"Spring Again\" before his career was interrupted by World War II. He joining the United States Navy in 1941, and then after the end of hostilities in 1945, returned to the theater and some radio work. On the insistence of ex-classmate Lauren Bacall, movie producer Hal B. Wallis screen-tested Douglas and cast him in the lead role in Die seltsame Liebe der Martha Ivers (1946). His performance received rave reviews and further work quickly followed, including an appearance in the low-key drama 14 Jahre Sing-Sing (1947), the first time he worked alongside fellow future screen legend Burt Lancaster. Such was the strong chemistry between the two that they appeared in seven films together, including the dynamic western Zwei rechnen ab (1957), the John Frankenheimer political thriller Sieben Tage im Mai (1964) and their final pairing in the gangster comedy Archie und Harry - Sie können's nicht lassen (1986). Douglas once said about his good friend: \"I've finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I've got nice-looking girls in my films now.\"\n\nAfter appearing in \"I Walk Alone,\" Douglas scored his first Oscar nomination playing the untrustworthy and opportunistic boxer Midge Kelly in the gripping Zwischen Frauen und Seilen (1949). The quality of his work continued to garner the attention of critics and he was again nominated for Oscars for his role as a film producer in Stadt der Illusionen (1952) and as tortured painter Vincent van Gogh in Vincent van Gogh - Ein Leben in Leidenschaft (1956), both directed by Vincente Minnelli. In 1955, Douglas launched his own production company, Bryna Productions, the company behind two pivotal film roles in his career. The first was as French army officer Col. Dax in director Stanley Kubrick's brilliant anti-war epic Wege zum Ruhm (1957). Douglas reunited with Kubrick for yet another epic, the magnificent Spartacus (1960). The film also marked a key turning point in the life of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy \"Red Scare\" hysteria in the 1950s. At Douglas' insistence, Trumbo was given on-screen credit for his contributions, which began the dissolution of the infamous blacklisting policies begun almost a decade previously that had destroyed so many careers and lives.\n\nDouglas remained busy throughout the 1960s, starring in many films. He played a rebellious modern-day cowboy in Einsam sind die Tapferen (1962), acted alongside John Wayne in the World War II story Erster Sieg (1965), again with The Duke in a drama about the Israeli fight for independence, Der Schatten des Giganten (1966), and once more with Wayne in the tongue-in-cheek western Die Gewaltigen (1967). Additionally in 1963, he starred in an onstage production of Ken Kesey's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" but despite his keen interest, no Hollywood studio could be convinced to bring the story to the screen. However, the rights remained with the Douglas clan, and Kirk's talented son Michael Douglas finally filmed the tale in 1975, starring Jack Nicholson. Into the 1970s, Douglas wasn't as busy as previous years; however, he starred in some unusual vehicles, including alongside a young Arnold Schwarzenegger in the loopy western comedy Kaktus Jack (1979), then with Farrah Fawcett in the sci-fi thriller Saturn-City (1980) and then he traveled to Australia for the horse opera/drama Snowy River (1982).\n\nUnknown to many, Kirk has long been involved in humanitarian causes and has been a Goodwill Ambassador for the US State Department since 1963. His efforts were rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1981), and with the Jefferson Award (1983). Furthermore, the French honored him with the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. More recognition followed for his work with the American Cinema Award (1987), the German Golden Kamera Award (1987), The National Board of Reviews Career Achievement Award (1989), an honorary Academy Award (1995), Recipient of the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award (1999) and the UCLA Medal of Honor (2002). Despite a helicopter crash and a stroke suffered in the 1990s, he remained active and continued to appear in front of the camera. Until his passing on February 5 2020 at the age of 103, he and Olivia de Havilland were the last surviving major stars from the Golden Years of Hollywood.\n\nOften mistaken for an American because of his skill at imitating accents, actor Tim Roth was born Timothy Simon Roth on May 14, 1961 in Lambeth, London, England. His mother, Ann, was a teacher and landscape painter. His father, Ernie, was a journalist who had changed the family name from \"Smith\" to \"Roth\"; Ernie was born in Brooklyn, New York, to an immigrant family of Irish ancestry.\n\nTim grew up in Dulwich, a middle-class area in the south of London. He demonstrated his talent for picking up accents at an early age when he attended school in Brixton, where he faced persecution from classmates for his comfortable background and quickly perfected a cockney accent to blend in. He attended Camberwell Art College and studied sculpture before he dropped out and pursued acting.\n\nThe blonde actor's first big break was the British TV movie Made in Britain (1983). Roth made a huge splash in that film as a young skinhead named Trevor. He next worked with director Mike Leigh on Meantime (1983), which he has counted among his favorite projects. He debuted on the big screen when he filled in for Joe Strummer in the Stephen Frears neo-noir The Hit - Die Profi-Killer (1984). Roth gained more attention for his turn as Vincent Van Gogh in Vincent und Theo (1990) and his work opposite Gary Oldman in Rosenkranz & Güldenstern (1990).\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles in search of work and caught the eye of young director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino had envisioned Roth as a possible Mr. Blonde or Mr. Pink in his heist flick Reservoir Dogs - Wilde Hunde (1992), but Roth campaigned for the role of Mr. Orange instead, and ultimately won the part. It proved to be a huge breakthrough for Roth, as audiences found it difficult to forget his performance as a member of a group of jewelry store robbers who is slowly bleeding to death. Tarantino cast Roth again in the landmark film Pulp Fiction (1994). Roth and actress Amanda Plummer played a pair of robbers who hold up a restaurant. 1995 saw the third of Roth's collaborations with Tarantino, a surprisingly slapstick performance in the anthology film Silvester in fremden Betten (1995). That same year Roth picked up an Academy Award nomination for his campy turn as a villain in the period piece Rob Roy (1995).\n\nContinuing to take on disparate roles, Roth did his own singing (with an American accent to boot) in the lightweight Woody Allen musical Alle sagen: I love you (1996). He starred opposite Tupac Shakur in Shakur's last film, the twisted comedy Gridlock'd - Voll drauf! (1997). The pair received positive critical notices for their comic chemistry. Standing in contrast to the criminals and baddies that crowd his CV, Roth's work as the innocent, seafaring pianist in the Giuseppe Tornatore film Die Legende vom Ozeanpianisten (1998) became something of a fan favorite. Grittier fare followed when Roth made his directorial debut with War Zone (1999), a frank, critically acclaimed drama about a family torn apart by incest. He made his next high-profile appearance as an actor as General Thade, an evil simian in the Tim Burton remake of Planet der Affen (2001). Roth was, of course, all but unrecognizable in his primate make-up.\n\nRoth has continued to enjoy a mix of art house and mainstream work, including everything from the lead role in Francis Ford Coppola's esoteric Jugend ohne Jugend (2007) to becoming \"The Abomination\" in the special effects-heavy blockbuster Der unglaubliche Hulk (2008). Roth took his first major American television role when he signed on to the Fox-TV series Lie to Me (2009)\n\nRobert Hammond Patrick was born on November 5, 1958 in Marietta, Georgia, raised there and Boston, Mass., Dayton, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Cleveland, Ohio. The eldest of five children. He attended the Bowling Green State University in Ohio, although dropped out after he took a drama course and became interested in acting. After leaving college, he took a job as a house painter and continued as such until a boating accident in Lake Erie in 1984. He swam for three hours in order to save the others still stranded at the accident site, while he nearly drowned in his attempt. After the accident, he moved from Ohio to Los Angeles, California. He worked in a bar to supplement his income and even lived in his own car.\n\nAfter arriving in Hollywood, Patrick had the good fortune to do many movies for Filmmaker Roger Corman. Patrick starred in various direct-to-video television movies, and had a short appearance in Stirb Langsam 2 (1990). His breakthrough role came as the liquid-metal, shape-shifting T-1000 in James Cameron's blockbuster Terminator 2: Tag der Abrechnung (1991). After that, he landed roles in various feature films such as Last Action Hero (1993), Feuer am Himmel (1993) and Striptease (1996). His performance in Fire in the Sky caught the attention of Chris Carter, creator of the television series Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993). After David Duchovny distanced himself from the series during its seventh season, Patrick was cast as FBI Special Agent John Doggett.\n\nRobert found his way to the small screen when David Chase offered him the role of David Scatino in his award-winning Die Sopranos (1999). Robert was a series regular on Season Six of HBO's True Blood (2008) and also appeared in the final season. He had a memorable role in the final season of Sons of Anarchy (2008), did a cameo role on the sitcom Community (2009), and had a supporting role in Season One on Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn (2014) for the El Rey Network. In Spring 2017, it was announced that Robert would have a featured role in Gale Anne Hurd's highly anticipated Amazon series Lore (2017), based on the popular horror podcast. Recent film credits include Universal Pictures' Voll abgezockt (2013) with Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman, Warner Brothers' Gangster Squad (2013) in which he played Josh Brolin's squad member going up against Sean Penn as Mickey Cohan, Back in the Game (2012) opposite Clint Eastwood, Linda Lovelace - Pornostar (2013) opposite Sharon Stone and Amanda Seyfried, Universal's remake of Endless Love (2014) with Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde, Focus Features' Kill the Messenger (2014) opposite Jeremy Renner, and The Road Within (2014) with Kyra Sedgwick and Zoë Kravitz and James Gunn's Peacemaker (2022) with John Cena. In 2022, it was announced Robert would be joining Taylor Sheridan's Yellowstone (2018) prequel 1923 (2022) with Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren.\n\nIn addition to his acting success, Patrick is a lifelong supporter of the military and the USO. The grandson of an Army veteran who served during World Wars I and II and the Korean War, Patrick grew up with a profound respect for troops. Devoted to giving back, he regularly goes on USO hospital visits and has participated in four USO tours in seven countries since 2008, visiting more than 8,100 service members and military families. He is a passionate Harley-Davidson enthusiast and is co-owner of Harley-Davidson of Santa Clarita. He resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife, Barbara and their two children.\n\nBob Hoskins was described by the director John Mackenzie as \"an actor from the British tradition but with an almost American approach, an instinctive approach to acting and knowing how to work with the camera\". He was born on October 26, 1942, in Bury St. Edmund's, Suffolk, where his mother was living after being evacuated as a result of the heavy bombings. He is the son of Elsie Lillian (Hopkins), a nursery school teacher and cook, and Robert William Hoskins, Sr., who drove a lorry and worked as a bookkeeper. Growing up, Hoskins received only limited education and he left school at 15, but with a passion for language and literature instilled by his former English teacher.\n\nA regular theatre-goer, Hoskins dreamed of starring on stage, but before he could do so he had to work odd jobs for a long time to make ends meet. His acting career started out more by accident than by design, when he accompanied a friend to watch some auditions, only to be confused for one of the people auditioning, getting a script pushed into his hands with the message \"You're next\". He got the part and acquired an agent. After some stage success, he expanded to television with roles in television series such as Villains (1972) and Thick as Thieves (1974). In the mid-'70s, he started his film career, standing out when he performed alongside Richard Dreyfuss in John Byrum's Nahaufnahmen (1975) and in a smaller part in Richard Lester's Königspoker (1975).\n\nHoskins broke through in 1978 in Dennis Potter's mini TV series, Tanz in den Wolken (1978), playing \"Arthur Parker\", the doomed salesman. After this, a string of high-profile and successful films followed, starting with his true major movie debut in 1980's Rififi am Karfreitag (1980) as the ultimately doomed \"Harold Shand\". This was followed by such works as Cotton Club (1984), Mona Lisa (1986), which won him an Oscar nomination as well as a BAFTA award, Cannes Film Festival and Golden Globe), Falsches Spiel mit Roger Rabbit (1988) (Golden Globe nomination), Meerjungfrauen küssen besser (1990), Hook (1991), Nixon - Der Untergang eines Präsidenten (1995), Felicia, mein Engel (1999) and Duell: Enemy at the Gates (2001).\n\nHoskins always carefully balanced the riches of Hollywood with the labor of independent film, though leaned more towards the latter than the former. He worked at smaller projects such as Shane Meadows' debut TwentyFourSeven (1997), in which he starred as \"Allen Darcy\". Besides this, he found time to direct, write and star in Raggedy - Eine Geschichte von Liebe, Flucht und Tod (1988), as well as direct and star in Rainbow - Die phantastische Reise auf dem Regenbogen (1995), and contributing to HBO's Geschichten aus der Gruft (1989) and Tube Tales (1999).\n\nSuffering from Parkinson's disease in later years, Hoskins died of pneumonia at age 71 in a London hospital.\n\nAn intense, versatile actor as adept at playing clean-cut FBI agents as he is psychotic motorcycle-gang leaders, who can go from portraying soulless, murderous vampires to burned-out, world-weary homicide detectives, Lance Henriksen has starred in a variety of films that have allowed him to stretch his talents just about as far as an actor could possibly hope. He played \"Awful Knoffel\" in the TNT original movie Evel Knievel (2004), directed by John Badham and executive produced by Mel Gibson. Henriksen portrayed \"Awful Knoffel\" in this project based on the life of the famed daredevil, played by George Eads. Henriksen starred for three seasons (1996-1999) on Millennium: Fürchte deinen Nächsten wie dich selbst (1996), Fox-TV's critically acclaimed series created by Chris Carter (Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993)). His performance as Frank Black, a retired FBI agent who has the ability to get inside the minds of killers, landed him three consecutive Golden Globe nominations for \"Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Drama Series\" and a People's Choice Award nomination for \"Favorite New TV Male Star\".\n\nHenriksen was born in New York City. His mother, Margueritte, was a waitress, dance instructor, and model. His father, James Marin Henriksen, who was from Tønsberg, Norway, was a boxer and merchant sailor. Henriksen studied at the Actors Studio and began his career off-Broadway in Eugene O'Neill's \"Three Plays of the Sea.\" One of his first film appearances was as an FBI agent in Sidney Lumet's Hundstage (1975), followed by parts in Lumet's Network (1976) and Prince of the City - Die Herren der Stadt (1981). He then appeared in Steven Spielberg's Die unheimliche Begegnung der 3. Art (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and François Truffaut, Damien - Omen II (1978) and in Philip Kaufman's Der Stoff aus dem die Helden sind (1983), in which he played Mercury astronaut Capt. Wally Schirra.\n\nJames Cameron cast Henriksen in his first directorial effort, Fliegende Killer - Piranha II (1982), then used him again in Terminator (1984) and as the android Bishop in the sci-fi classic Aliens: Die Rückkehr (1986). Sam Raimi cast Henriksen as an outrageously garbed gunfighter in his quirky western Schneller als der Tod (1995). Henriksen has also appeared in what has developed into a cult classic: Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark - Die Nacht hat ihren Preis (1987), in which he plays the head of a clan of murderous redneck vampires. He was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in the TNT original film The Day Lincoln Was Shot (1998).\n\nIn addition to his abilities as an actor, Henriksen is an accomplished painter and potter. His talent as a ceramist has enabled him to create some of the most unusual ceramic artworks available on the art market today. He resides in Southern California with his wife Jane and their five-year-old daughter Sage."
