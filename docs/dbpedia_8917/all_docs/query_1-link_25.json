        "text": "American ice hockey player (born 1970)\n\nIce hockey player\n\nMichael Thomas Modano Jr. ( ; born June 7, 1970) is an American former professional ice hockey player. He played as a center and spent most of his career with the Minnesota North Stars/Dallas Stars franchise. He spent the final season of his career with his hometown Detroit Red Wings.\n\nAs the all-time goal-scoring and points leader amongst American-born players in NHL history, Modano is widely regarded as one of the greatest American-born ice hockey players of all time.[1][2][3] He was drafted first overall by the North Stars in 1988, and after the team moved to Texas he helped the Stars win the Stanley Cup in 1999.\n\nModano is considered one of the most influential figures in popularizing ice hockey in Texas and the southern United States.[4] Modano was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 17, 2014.[5][6] In 2017, he was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players.[7] In 2019, he was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame.[8]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nModano was born in Livonia, Michigan, the third child and only son of Michael, Sr. and Karen Modano. He grew up in Highland Township, and due to causing problems at school with his mischievous behavior, a friend of his father suggested to put Modano in a team sport to get him controlled. Michael, Sr. was a fan of hockey, and decided to teach ice skating to seven-year-old Modano. He learned it well, and six months later was put in local hockey teams. As a youth, he was part of a Detroit Red Wings team in the 1982 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament.[9] To spend his minor hockey career with the Detroit Little Caesar's Triple AAA Hockey Club, the Modano family moved to Westland, where he also attended Franklin High School (Livonia, Michigan).[10] He made the Midget Major team at the age of fourteen when his teammates were two to three years older. In the 1984–85 season, Modano scored 50 goals and 50 assists on the way to win the USA Hockey National Championship in 1985.[11][12] As a child Modano decided to pick the number 9 for his jersey in an homage to both Ted Williams, an idol of his Boston Red Sox fan father, and the Red Wings' own Gordie Howe.[13]\n\nPlaying career\n\n[edit]\n\nMinor leagues (1986–1988)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1986, 16-year-old Modano was invited by coach Rick Wilson of the Prince Albert Raiders to come to Saskatchewan and join the Western Hockey League team. At his very first game, he scored a hat trick, and by his second year, Modano was part of the WHL All-Star Team. Four days after Modano's eighteenth birthday, the Minnesota North Stars selected him as the first overall draft pick in the 1988 NHL entry draft. Modano was the second American to be selected first overall in the draft, after Brian Lawton in 1983. Contract problems led Modano to play one more season with the Raiders.[11]\n\nMinnesota North Stars/Dallas Stars (1988–2010)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe North Stars signed Modano on Christmas of 1988, and he joined the team for the 1989–90 season. He scored his first career NHL goal against Glenn Healy of the New York Islanders, and had a good rookie season which landed him on the NHL All-Rookie team and made him a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy.[11] He controversially lost to 31-year-old Sergei Makarov, who had already played professionally in the Soviet Championship League for over 12 years; this led to an age barrier of 26 for Calder candidates from the following year to the present.\n\nDespite the good start, Modano was often criticized in Minnesota as an underachiever. This was evidenced by a sophomore season where the North Stars reached the Stanley Cup Finals, but Modano's point production dropped, while confronting coach Bob Gainey for his overtly defensive style. In 1992, Modano signed a four-year extension that made him the highest-paid member of the team, receiving $2 million per year. He soon had his best season up to that point, scoring 93 points at the 1992–93 NHL season and earning his first NHL All-Star Game invitation.[11]\n\nStars move to Dallas\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to the 1993–94 NHL season, the North Stars moved to Dallas to become the Dallas Stars. Considering the relocation to Texas as an opportunity for a fresh start, with different expectations from fans and the media, Modano decided to accept Gainey's suggestions to become a more complete player and perform more attacks. Modano recorded a personal-best 50 goals and again scored 93 points. Soon he became an idol in Dallas, becoming the player who sold the most jerseys and received the most letters. During the next two seasons, Modano lowered his goalscoring and had many injuries – a concussion, a knee injury and ruptured ankle tendons – but improved his defensive play. Despite that, the Stars failed to qualify for the 1996 Stanley Cup playoffs, and Gainey stepped down as head coach, while remaining GM.[11]\n\nKen Hitchcock was hired on January 8, 1996, as Dallas' coach, installing a defensive-minded system while requesting Modano to concentrate on his offense and using him more routinely – instead of the 15–18 minutes he played under Gainey, Modano routinely played 25 minutes with Hitchcock. Helped by new acquisitions Joe Nieuwendyk and Sergei Zubov, Modano led the Stars to the Central Division title in the 1996–97 season. In the 1998 Stanley Cup playoffs, with new goaltender Ed Belfour, the Stars reached the Western Conference finals. However, they fell in six games at the hands of the eventual back-to-back Stanley Cup champions, the Detroit Red Wings.[11]\n\nIn 1999, Modano won the Stanley Cup with the Stars, playing all six games of the finals against the Buffalo Sabres despite breaking his wrist in the second game.[11] Modano assisted on the Stars' final five goals of the series, including both in Game 5 and Game 6, and final goal. He led the Stars with 23 points in the playoffs, with all seven in the finals on assists.[14] The Stars returned to the finals in 2000 against the New Jersey Devils. Modano scored the overtime goal that gave the Stars a victory in game 5,[15] but in Game 6 in Dallas, the Devils wound up closing the series 4–2.[16]\n\nModano averaged 78 points per season from 1996 to 2002, and was also one of the NHL's top forwards in plus/minus over that span (his +43 in 1997 was second only to John LeClair's +44 mark). Modano's career high for points in a game is six (2–4–6) against the Anaheim Ducks, and he has seven career hat tricks. His only career fight was against Rod Brind'Amour. He was also a candidate for the Frank J. Selke Trophy (2001), and the Lady Byng Trophy (2003).\n\n2005–2010\n\n[edit]\n\nAs the long-time face of the Dallas franchise, he has recorded over 1,000 NHL points and became the captain of the Stars in 2003. During the 2005 offseason, Modano contemplated signing with the Boston Bruins, but he decided to stay with the Stars after owner Tom Hicks got involved. Modano would sign a five-year contract extension with Dallas on August 5, 2005. On September 29, 2006, Brenden Morrow replaced him as the Stars' captain; Modano served an alternate captain from that time until 2010, a role in which he had previously served from 1995 to 2003.\n\nModano scored his 500th career regular-season goal on March 13, 2007, with 10:24 left in the 3rd period in a regulation win against Antero Niittymäki of the Philadelphia Flyers with assists by Antti Miettinen and Jon Klemm. He is only the 14th goal scorer to score 500 goals with a single team and the 39th player to reach 500 goals overall.\n\nOn March 17, 2007, in an away game versus the Nashville Predators, Modano scored his 502nd and 503rd career regular-season goals in a 3–2 loss, thus passing Joe Mullen's NHL record (502) for most goals scored by an American-born player.\n\nModano also holds the NHL all-time record for most points scored by a U.S.-born player. He broke the record, which previously belonged to Phil Housley, on November 7, 2007, by scoring two goals in the first five minutes, with the record-breaker being a short-handed goal on a breakaway, against the San Jose Sharks. That night, amongst his congratulatory phone calls was one from Air Force One, U.S. President George W. Bush spoke to him for a few minutes about the record.\n\nThe Stars' game on November 21, 2007, was named \"Mike Modano Tribute Night\" at American Airlines Center, where Modano was honored by the franchise for his achievements in U.S. hockey. Those who spoke in the pre-game ceremony included Brett Hull, Joe Mullen, Phil Housley, and Stars owner Tom Hicks. Capping off an emotional night, Modano later went on to score the game-tying goal, as well as a shootout goal in a 3–2 Stars victory against the Anaheim Ducks.\n\nWith his production declining from 2007 to 2010, Modano played out the duration of his contract, which expired after the 2009–10 season. In the final game of that season (coincidentally played in Minnesota, where Modano began his pro career), Modano was saluted with a video tribute and a standing ovation, and named the game's first star, skating around the ice wearing a Minnesota North Stars jersey.\n\nDetroit Red Wings (2010–2011)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 29, 2010, the Stars announced that Modano would not be re-signed to a contract for the 2010–11 season.[17] After contemplating retirement or signing with the Detroit Red Wings (in his home state) or with the Minnesota Wild (in the state where he began his NHL career),[18] Modano signed a one-year contract with the Red Wings.[19][20][21] As the no. 9 jersey had been retired by the Red Wings, Modano went for no. 90 instead.[12] Coach Mike Babcock expressed a desire for Modano to center Detroit's third line with Dan Cleary and Jiří Hudler.[22]\n\nAt 5:35 of the first period of Detroit's 2010–11 home opener, on just his second shift, Modano took a pass from Cleary and beat Anaheim goaltender Jonas Hiller for his first goal as a Red Wing.[23]\n\nModano's time with the Red Wings ended on a sour note when Babcock made him a healthy scratch for his potential 1,500th regular-season game in the NHL. Modano finished his career with 1,499 regular-season games played.[24]\n\nPost-playing career\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 23, 2011, after 21 seasons in the NHL, Modano officially announced his retirement from hockey at a press conference in Dallas.[25] Modano was the last active player to have played in the 1980s, along with Mark Recchi, as well as the last active player to have played for the Minnesota North Stars. The Stars signed Modano to a one-day contract to allow Modano to retire as a Dallas Star.[26] In January 2013, Modano became an alternate governor and executive advisor for the Stars' office.[27] He described his role as regarding the \"business side of the organization\", attracting the involvement of local businesses to the team, as well as getting more fans to Stars games.[28]\n\nIn May 2019, Modano was hired by the Minnesota Wild to serve as an executive advisor in the front office.[29]\n\nModano is the founder and current Vice President of the Mike Modano Foundation, Inc., which raises awareness and funding for organizations offering education and assistance to children and families affected by child abuse, acts with canine rescue and has also united with the Wounded Warrior Project.[28] Moreover, since the start of his NHL career, Modano has affiliated many times with both charitable organizations and the Texas community in general. He has also had his own clothing line during the 1990s.[11]\n\nModano was one of a number of sportsmen to feature in a series of vignettes for WWF superstar Mr. Perfect, with Perfect playing as a goaltender saving every shot including Modano's.[30]\n\nModano made a brief cameo appearance alongside then-teammate Basil McRae in the 1992 film The Mighty Ducks. Modano received a membership voucher to the Screen Actors Guild for the role.[31][32]\n\nModano is an avid golfer, having met his second wife on a golf course, and playing in some tournaments after retirement.[28] On Mike Modano Tribute Night, both the Dallas Stars and Anaheim Ducks organizations presented him with golf packages, one of which was for the course at The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in Scotland. His golf partner is often former Stars teammate Brett Hull. In the 2nd round of the 2021 American Century Celebrity Golf Championship on the 18th hole, Modano hit a double eagle (albatross) for the first time in the history of the event.[33] The result of his shot going in gave him a tie for lead with John Smoltz going into the 3rd and final round.[34]\n\nHull and Modano ran a Dallas restaurant, Hully & Mo Restaurant and Tap Room, from 2008 to 2012.[35][36] In 2003, the town of Westland, where Modano lived during his minor hockey career and his parents still reside, renamed their ice rink as Mike Modano Ice Arena.[37]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nModano holds numerous records and accolades in NHL history, such as goals by a player born in the United States with 561, points by an American-born player with 1374, career playoff points by an American-born player with 146, and games played by an American-born forward with 1499.[38][39][40] These achievements and others lead to many peers and sportswriters regarding Modano as one of the greatest American-born ice hockey players of all time.[1][2][41][3][42]\n\nDuring his playing career, he was known for his speed, offensive instincts, scoring, puck-handling, and skating ability on the ice amongst peers, and regarded for his well-rounded style of play and skillset.[7][43][39][6]\n\nOn January 21, 2007, the NHL announced Modano as the Special Ambassador to the 2007 NHL All-Star Celebration, thanks to his numerous contributions towards bringing the 55th National Hockey League All-Star Game to Dallas and also for his contributions to Dallas hockey as a whole. Modano, the Stars' all-time leader in several statistical categories and a member of the franchise for the entirety of his 17-year career, appeared at selected All-Star events and dropped the puck in a ceremonial face-off prior the game on January 24, 2007.[44]\n\nOn March 8, 2014, the Dallas Stars retired Modano's #9 jersey. At that time he was only the 4th player in franchise history to have that honor.[45]\n\nOn November 17, 2014, Modano was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.[5][46]\n\nFor the 100th anniversary of the NHL in January 2017, Modano was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players, voted in by a panel of 58 people, including media members, NHL alumni and NHL executives.[7][47]\n\nIn February 2019, Modano was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame.[48][49][50]\n\nIn December 2022, The Athletic ranked Modano at #51 on its \"NHL99\" list of the 100 best players in modern NHL history.[41]\n\nThe Dallas Stars unveiled a statue of Mike Modano at the American Airlines Center on March 16, 2024.[51][52] The statue honoring Modano, designed by Omri Amrany, is located in the PNC Plaza outside of the arena, alongside one of Dallas Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki.[53][54]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring his tenure with the Stars, Modano started dating Kerri Nelson, sister of his teammates Jeff and Todd Nelson.[11] In October 1999, he proposed to her, but eventually they ended the engagement in February 2000.[55]\n\nOn November 30, 2006, singer/songwriter Willa Ford announced that Modano, her long-time boyfriend, had proposed to her during the weekend of Thanksgiving, 2006.[56] Modano and Ford were married in a small ceremony in Athens, Texas, on August 25, 2007, where Brett Hull and Darryl Sydor attended as Modano's co-best men.[57][58] Ford was asked by the NHL to blog the Stars' 2007 playoff series; her posts were well-received, and her support of her husband quite vocal.[59] In August 2012, Ford and Modano announced that they were divorcing.[60]\n\nModano married professional golfer Allison Micheletti, daughter and niece of former NHL players Joe Micheletti and Pat Micheletti, respectively, on September 1, 2013.[61] They have twins (Jack and Kate), born in 2014 as well as a daughter, Reese (born 2016), son, Luca (born 2018), and daughter, Quinn (born 2020).[28][62][63]\n\nCareer achievements\n\n[edit]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nEast First All-Star Team (WHL) – 1989\n\nNHL All-Rookie team – 1990\n\nNHL All-Star Games – 1993, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2003 (as the Western Conference team captain), 2004, 2007 (as the Special Ambassador), 2009\n\nStanley Cup champion – 1999\n\nNHL second All-Star team – 2000\n\nDallas Stars #9 jersey retired – 2014[64]\n\nHockey Hall of Fame Class of 2014\n\nInducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2019[65][8]\n\nRecords\n\n[edit]\n\nNHL\n\n[edit]\n\nGoals by a player born in the United States (561)\n\nPoints by an American-born player (1374)\n\nPlayoff points by an American-born player, career (146)\n\nGames played by an American-born forward (1499)\n\nGame-winning goals by an American-born player (92)\n\nMinnesota North Stars/Dallas Stars\n\n[edit]\n\nGames played, regular season and playoffs (1459, 174)\n\nGoals, regular season and playoffs (557, 58)\n\nAssists, regular season and playoffs (802, 87)\n\nPoints, regular season and playoffs (1359, 145)\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season and playoffs\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1985–86 Detroit Compuware MNHL 69 66 65 131 32 — — — — — 1986–87 Prince Albert Raiders WHL 70 32 30 62 96 8 1 4 5 4 1987–88 Prince Albert Raiders WHL 65 47 80 127 80 9 7 11 18 18 1988–89 Prince Albert Raiders WHL 41 39 66 105 74 — — — — — 1988–89 Minnesota North Stars NHL — — — — — 2 0 0 0 0 1989–90 Minnesota North Stars NHL 80 29 46 75 63 7 1 1 2 12 1990–91 Minnesota North Stars NHL 79 28 36 64 65 23 8 12 20 6 1991–92 Minnesota North Stars NHL 76 33 44 77 46 7 3 2 5 4 1992–93 Minnesota North Stars NHL 82 33 60 93 83 — — — — — 1993–94 Dallas Stars NHL 76 50 43 93 54 9 7 3 10 16 1994–95 Dallas Stars NHL 30 12 17 29 8 — — — — — 1995–96 Dallas Stars NHL 78 36 45 81 63 — — — — — 1996–97 Dallas Stars NHL 80 35 48 83 42 7 4 1 5 0 1997–98 Dallas Stars NHL 52 21 38 59 32 17 4 10 14 12 1998–99 Dallas Stars NHL 77 34 47 81 44 23 5 18 23 16 1999–2000 Dallas Stars NHL 77 38 43 81 48 23 10 13 23 10 2000–01 Dallas Stars NHL 81 33 51 84 52 9 3 4 7 0 2001–02 Dallas Stars NHL 78 34 43 77 38 — — — — — 2002–03 Dallas Stars NHL 79 28 57 85 30 12 5 10 15 4 2003–04 Dallas Stars NHL 76 14 30 44 46 5 1 2 3 8 2005–06 Dallas Stars NHL 78 27 50 77 58 5 1 3 4 4 2006–07 Dallas Stars NHL 59 22 21 43 34 7 1 1 2 4 2007–08 Dallas Stars NHL 82 21 36 57 48 18 5 7 12 22 2008–09 Dallas Stars NHL 80 15 31 46 46 — — — — — 2009–10 Dallas Stars NHL 59 14 16 30 22 — — — — — 2010–11 Detroit Red Wings NHL 40 4 11 15 8 2 0 1 1 0 NHL totals 1,499 561 813 1,374 926 176 58 88 146 128\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\nMedal record Men's ice hockey Representing the United States Olympic Games 2002 Salt Lake City Ice hockey\n\nYear Team Event GP G A Pts PIM 1988 United States WJC 7 4 1 5 8 1989 United States WJC 7 6 9 15 12 1990 United States WC 8 3 3 6 2 1991 United States CC 8 2 7 9 2 1993 United States WC 6 0 0 0 2 1996 United States WCH 7 2 4 6 4 1998 United States OG 4 2 0 2 0 2002 United States OG 6 0 6 6 4 2004 United States WCH 5 1 5 6 0 2005 United States WC 7 3 1 4 4 2006 United States OG 6 2 0 2 6 Senior totals 57 15 26 41 24\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of NHL statistical leaders\n\nList of NHL players with 1,000 games played\n\nList of NHL players with 1000 points\n\nList of NHL players with 500 goals\n\nList of first overall NHL draft picks\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or ESPN.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or Legends of Hockey, or The Internet Hockey Database\n\nThe Mike Modano Foundation\n\nMike Modano Ice Arena"
