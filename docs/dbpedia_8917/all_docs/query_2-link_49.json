        "text": "LinkedIn community I hope this post finds you well. I'd like to draw your attention to a recent professional development involving my former colleague, Charles Swan, who unfortunately experienced a layoff this week. Chuck has consistently exemplified a strong work ethic, an unwavering passion for his role, and a proven track record of delivering exceptional results. His dedication to his work is truly commendable, and I am confident that he would be a valuable asset to any team. Beyond his professional capabilities, Chuck is recognized for being a collaborative and easy-to-work-with team member. His positive demeanor and effective communication make him not only a skilled professional but also a great colleague to have. I highly recommend considering Chuck for any relevant opportunities within your organization.\n\nI am truly ‚ù§Ô∏è honored to be a valued member of the TEAM that successfully achieved this significant milestone. The journey to attain the esteemed recognition of the PGA TOUR and score üíØ as a 'Leader in LGBTQ+ Workplace Inclusion' required countless hours and years of dedication. Effecting change in policies and reshaping the operational dynamics of a business is no small feat, and this accomplishment is a testament to our collective commitment, one that I‚Äôve been honored to be part of in the past year. While we celebrate this remarkable achievement, we recognize that our journey towards inclusivity and excellence is an ongoing one. As the co-chair of the esteemed PRISM üè≥Ô∏èüåà our group that strives to invite, educate, and engage new allies to achieve full inclusion for people who are LGBTQ+ at the PGA TOUR, I feel a profound sense of responsibility and PRIDE üè≥Ô∏èüåà in my short time in this role and at the TOUR. This accomplishment is not an individual triumph, but a collaborative effort involving the dedication of many that put in the years of hard work to achieve this specific milestone. This achievement serves as a foundation for our continued commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace, and I am privileged to be part of a team that strives for ongoing improvement. Together, we can and will do better, ensuring that our workplace remains a beacon of diversity, respect, and acceptance.\n\nMy appropriate theme song today via my favorite artist Taylor Swift. \"Ask me what I learned from all those years Ask me what I earned from all those tears Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here (I'm still, I'm still here) 'Cause karma is the thunder Rattling your ground Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter Karma's gonna track you down Step by step from town to town Sweet like justice, karma is a queen Karma takes all my friends to the summit\" #karma #taylorswift\n\nI had the honor of moderating our #Pride panel for the PGA TOUR yesterday, and I couldn't be prouder! It was truly inspiring to witness the collective impact of our companies in fostering a safe and inclusive environment for everyone working in the realm of #sports, but realizing there is more that can be done to achieve this goal. A heartfelt thank you goes out to the Jacksonville Jaguars and Fanatics, Inc. for their invaluable participation. I would also like to extend special appreciation to Corina, Emily, and Ginny for their courage in openly discussing these crucial topics. Additional thanks to the PGA TOUR for allowing us to bring this topic and panel to our employees! ‚ù§Ô∏èüè≥Ô∏èüåà\n\nMy co-worker and companion for 14 years took her final breath yesterday. One of the hardest decisions to make, but ultimately the right one for her. She got to say goodbye to her family on FaceTime. Then I got to hold her while she moved on. Keira was always by my side when I worked remotely for 5 years. During COVID she was my only companion. Keira was born on a farm in Texas, she loved the snow, hated the rain, and was a fighter, but mostly she just wanted to be loved. She traveled all over, New York, Colorado, California, and a road trip across the United States to her final place in Florida. Dear Keira, Thank you for making sure I was onto my next adventure in life. You knew I wouldn‚Äôt be alone and that my career was on the right track. You lifted my spirits when I was down, and you made me smile and laugh all the time. I hope you are at peace and at a place where you can always see me (you always had to know where I was, hopefully now you can always see where I am). Your soul connected with mine the moment I met you on that farm in Texas. You gave me a kiss and fell asleep on my heart, yesterday I gave you the kiss and you fell asleep the last time on my heart. Sweet dreams little girl‚Ä¶ one day I‚Äôll see you again."
