        "text": "Tomy Parker, my step-dad, is the bravest, funniest, hardworking man you will ever meet. In 2011 he was deployed to Afghanistan in the “war on terror.” On December 10 he was at the back of the patrol line and stepped on a bomb, he lost both of his legs, 4 fingers on his left hand, and from what he said, “his purpose in life.” After that he tried drugs for the first time but that was just the beginning. He was a drug addict for about 10 years and was completely lost in life. My mom grew up with Tomy but after seeing my Mom many years later he instantly fell in love and found his purpose again. At that moment he decided to change his life and how he lived it. He came into my life when me, my mom and little brother were all struggling with a divorce. We didn’t know we needed him until he was there. Tomy managed to completely turn his life around and earn back the respect from all of his family and friends and so many more and is truly an inspiration. Now he goes to different schools and talks about his past with drug addiction and his story in life. He is a public speaker and an auctioneer for Warrior Rising and helps raise money for veterans in need. He is a boxing coach for kids and volunteers anytime he can to help kids with sports. He has devoted his life to his family and his health. We were all lost before he came around including him and we didn’t even know it but once he did everything seemed to fall into place. He has helped so many people with suicide, addiction, and so much more. He thinks that he is just a regular man but what he doesn’t know is that he has inspired so many people and in my opinion is the definition of “extraordinary”.\n\nIt is not hard to see the impact my dad has had on everybody he meets. In fact, the hardest part of writing about how great of a father he is, is the word limit for this essay. His contagious laughter and hardworking spirit resonate not only through my family, but of all the lives he saves daily.\n\nMy dad is an Emergency Room doctor, who began as a combat medic in our nation’s military, deployed weeks after I was born. Since those starting moments of his career, I can’t help but be overwhelmed with gratitude that he fought for me and all of the country and continues to fight every day for people’s lives at his work.\n\nThis pandemic has been hard on all of us. Our frontline workers have shown nothing but heroism and bravery, and I believe that my father is the picture of that. Never did he let this worldwide crisis dim his positive light. He brings a smile to all whose heart he touches and body he helps heal. He has taught me how to be strong when my world seems to be collapsing. He has taught me to be a leader, a fighter, and a friend. He is proof that no matter where you start, you can control your finish. I remember every time somebody I know has come up to me and expressed how cool my dad was. My only reply can be “You don’t even know the half of it.”\n\nCorinne White\n\nHello, my name is Jack and I am 9 years old. My Grammy Deb is writing this for me as I am unable to see, speak, walk or do any of the things that “normal” kids do, but I want the world to know that I have an “All Star” Dad.\n\nMy Mom and Dad married, got their college degrees and bought a house in their home town. When I came along they were over the moon. No one knew yet that I was a “special” baby. Then when I was 3 months old I had a seizure. They did a lot of tests and eventually I was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, microcephaly and blindness. Each new diagnosis was a devastating blow to my parents.\n\nWhen I grew bigger, I needed a wheelchair. Getting me and my chair in and out of the car was difficult. My parents found a van called an MV-1 which is wheelchair accessible but very expensive. My parents knew they were blessed to have good enough jobs to provide this for me but it bothered my Dad when he knew other families with kids like me weren’t so lucky. The thought of helping others sparked something in my Dad and the got the idea to start “Giving Songs,” a non-profit charity that helps families with blind, multi-disabled children buy wheelchair accessible vehicles. Please check out GivingSongs.org for information and pictures.\n\nMy Dad does everything for me. He bathes me, feeds me, and most of all loves me with all his heart. He works over 60 hours a week as a supervisor for a major trucking company. He devotes any spare time he finds to the charity and helping others. I can’t think of anything he does for himself.\n\nI can’t make my Dad cards to say I love him like my sister does. I can’t put my arms around him and thank him for being the greatest Dad ever. But with Grammy’s help, I can nominate him for this award. Please help me do this for my Dad.\n\nBest regards, Jack Johnson\n\nHi, my name is Brad Taylor and I am twelve years old. I’d like to nominate my dad for All Star Dad 2018. He works hard for our family every day, balancing being a volunteer firefighter for our city of Rosemount, his job, and coaching all our sports.\n\nEvery day he wakes up at 6 am to go to his job where he is a VP of sales. Sometimes it takes him 2 hours to drive there, but he still rushes home so he doesn’t miss our activities. Plus, he is a volunteer fireman that joined at 40 years old. He was the oldest rookie they had but be he always wanted to be a firefighter so he did it! That makes me think you can accomplish anything if you really want to! He goes to fire training every Tuesday, and often has to wake up in the middle of the night to go help someone who is injured or put out a fire. He has gone to calls where he doesn’t get back till 6 hours later, but still makes time for us.\n\nMy Dad works very hard all day even when he is so tired from going to fire calls at night. When he leaves work he usually drives straight to our sports where he is the head coach. He doesn’t just help me and my brother but teaches all the kids to be better in sports and to be respectful and hard workers.\n\nOn the weekends he even does the laundry so my mom doesn’t have to! Yesterday I needed popsicle sticks for a project for school and he drove to 3 stores to find some for me. He has taught me manners, and someone once said I was the most polite kid they know. My Dad has to deal with so many things but I know that I can always trust him to be by my side whenever I need it. In the morning he always texts me to have a great day at school, and that we can watch the Timberwolves or Wild that night and spend time together.\n\nHe always checks on me, my little sister, and little brother before we go to bed, and he is always there to talk to about anything. He saves up his change and other money to take us on vacations, and buy us food after sports. And you may think, wow, he must of had a really good dad to be such a good one himself. NOPE. His Dad left his mom when he was a kid. But he still figured out how to be the great dad he is. He is ALWAYS respectful and polite, and is a strong believer in Jesus.\n\nThese are just a FEW of the reasons, why my dad is an All Star to me!\n\nP.S. Also me and my dad have a handshake. If we win and get to come to New York, I’ll show it to you.\n\nHi, my name is Brett and I am nominating my Dad for All-Star Dad. I am a twin and my brother has autism. This makes our home different from many other homes. My brother goes to 7 therapies a week and one on the weekend so we are pretty busy so by the time we get home in the evening my mom is tired so she does her stuff and my Dad takes over and helps my brother, Kyle with homework. We are both in 7th grade now so we have so much more homework then we used to have. I watch my Dad work with Kyle and sometimes you have to have a whole lot of patience with Kyle which honestly sometimes I do not have. My Dad listens to Kyle and talks calmly with him and has so much patience. I know my Dad is tired from working all day (my Dad is in remission from cancer from last year) and I know from his cancer treatments he gets tired so much faster than he used to but he does what he has to do in order for my brother Kyle to be successful at school and in the community. My brother gets good grades and that is because of how much my Dad works with him. Kyle also does sports and my Dad is there to help if Kyle needs it and cheer him on. My Dad either goes to my game or my brothers and my Mom does the other game. He is also great with my Mom. Since she does all of the driving during the week to school and from school to therapies, the cooking, walking Kyle’s service dog Clifford and whatever needs to be done at the house she gets a break on Sunday. My Dad takes us to yoga therapy and maybe the movies or Chuck E Cheese and out to lunch on Sunday’s. Also my Mom is great at finding fun stuff for us to do (usually through an autism organization for a low cost) and my Dad never has any issues with it even if he is really tired from his cancer. We go skateboarding, surfing, boating, paddle boarding, concerts, biking and Boomers. Last summer my Dad was so sick we did not have a summer vacation and I know he felt so bad about that he just could not make it but this year he said he can take us to Dinsey World but I know I will have to be a big kid and help my Dad with my brother with watching him, cooking our food and doing what my Dad needs help with. Dad does not ask so I will have to help him all on my own. Dad had a brother and sister with Cerebral Palsy and I know he does not want to burden me with work and just let me be a kid but I love my Dad so much and watching him work so hard when he does not feel good I have to help. My Dad will ask about my day at school and my baseball games if he goes to Kyle’s – he makes me the best vegie bacon and grilled cheese sandwiches ever on the weekends and sometimes takes me in the evenings we get frozen yogurt together and talk. I love my Mom very much and spend a lot of time with her so these times when I am just with my Dad makes me so happy. He is a very smart man so if I am having any trouble with my school work like Geometry or Science he will sit down with me and explain it to me and make sure I understand. I never feel he is in a hurry or trying to get it done so he can do something else – I feel his love for me and makes sure I understand what he is saying and has great patience. My Dad is a great Dad and I know to me he will always be an “All Star Dad” to me.\n\nMy All-Star Dad’s career has taken him to the ends of the Earth, to the gates of hell and back again. I get honor, commitment, service, the traits I think that just by sharing his genetics have been passed to me.\n\nBut before this last summer I don’t know how much I could have really told you about the man my father is until now.\n\nMy dad wore the uniform of an American Airman to over 14 different countries not to wave a flag over the people who lived there, instead to show them they have the right to their way of life, liberties all human kind deserve, and the right to pursue happiness.\n\nHe has been a leader of men, a survivor of war and a friend. I heard the story for the first time at my father’s retirement in 2014 and still I can’t believe that the man who taught me how to ride a bike returned home with a Bronze Star for saving his commander and team from a improvised explosive device.\n\nMSgt Christopher Irving, retired. My father could have went on to be a Chief Master Sergeant his commander commented, “he is choosing to take on the hardest tasking of his life, he is choosing to be in the service of his family.” Seeing my father be awarded the medal/hearing the words of his bravery and leadership. I realize his legacy is not just in me–my five siblings, but the Airman he served with.\n\nI know everyone thinks their dad is special or the best. To that person, he is. To me, my dad absolutely is. Our story might be a little different than most. My dad and I met when I was three. He was a friend of the family’s and him and my mom eventually started dating and well, the rest is history. Since that moment, he loved me and I always felt like he did. He took me in and accepted me as his own and has been the only father I have ever known.\n\nOver the years, I have learned so many lessons from him as he has lived through very difficult situations in life that have each served as lesson points for me. Probably the most important lesson I think he wants me to take away from him is to work hard and believe in myself. However, I think the most important lesson that he has taught without realizing it is unconditional love. I am sure it is not easy for a man to come into a family and accept a child that is not really his. He has never made me feel like I didn’t belong. Every day when he comes home from work, I can count on him to find me in the house and give me a hug and ask about my day.\n\nEven though I know he works very hard at his job and often takes other side jobs on weekends, he always finds a moment to plan a father/daughter movie or dinner date or just talk to me about things going on in my life. He makes me laugh when I want to cry, he makes me smile when I feel discouraged. Most of all, he has made me feel like a blessing instead of a burden. Some fathers are given by chance and some are given by God. I am thankful that my dad was chosen for me and I will never take that for granted. Because of him, I have learned for the past 11 years how to love even in a harsh world and without expecting anything in return and see the beautiful in all things and situations.\n\nThroughout the years of being with my father, I have never been happier, and without my dad I wouldn’t be who I am today. When I look at my friends, I see their fathers are divorced from their wives and they usually are gone most of the time, but I can depend on my father for everything. My father is dedicated to his family, volunteers in our community, and has contributed to making our country a better place. My father’s schedule is based on my whole family, and he does whatever he can to put a smile on our faces. A few years ago, my father asked the rest of the family if we wanted to volunteer at his school to help repair the gym for the disabled kids, and we said yes. My father not only loves us, he loves all children and does whatever he can to put a smile on their faces, too. During Hurricane Katrina, my father worked to help the evacuees by spending many hours on the computer to find the rest of their family members lost after the hurricane. Once he did, he drove to the D. C. Armory to tell them, and I’ve never seen so much joy in a family in my whole life. My father also took them on a tour around the D. C. area to show them where the White House and the Washington Memorial are located, started a clothes drive, and raised money for them. I look back at my father’s unselfishness and the love he has for others and say to myself that I am so lucky to have him as my father – a real dad -my All Star.\n\nChristopher Valerian is the most amazing MomDad (as he is affectionately called by his 4 daughters) that I know. Chris is a 44-year-old single Dad, who is raising his 4 beautiful girls (13, 11, 9, & 7). Chris wears many ‘hats’ and does so with so much pride. At home, he is a Daddy, a short order cook, house cleaner, a landscaper, the laundry service, a play date coordinator, a shoulder to cry on, a taxi service, a motivator, a role model, a homework helper, a cupcake baker and so much more! At work, he is a Physician, who helps run a hospital, a consultant and innovator, a teacher, and a healer. At church, he is a confirmation mentor, religious education teacher, and the altar server coordinator. In the community, he serves on the Board of Health, PTA Treasurer, Lighting Crew for school plays, 9/11 Tribute Center Volunteer, New Jersey Task Force One Urban Search & Rescue member, and an instructor at Somerset County Emergency Services Training Academy. In his spare time he teaches his girls about health and wellness by training with them for adventure races. Chris is always doing for others and as the saying goes – he will give you the shirt off his back. Chris and his daughters have withstood tremendous adversity, but through it all he remained true to himself and a constant beacon for his children. “So that others may live” is his motto and he truly would do anything and everything for his family, his friends, and his world.\n\nMy son had plans to go to Temple University to study architecture. Just before his junior year in High School he dove into a swimming pool and broke his neck. He is paralyzed from the chest down. He finished high school and was accepted at Temple this past fall. Unfortunately, our insurance would not cover his care because they don’t deem him “medically needy” enough. Instead of telling my son he had to stay home so we could care for him, my husband left his job after 23 years of teaching and moved into my son’s dorm room with him. My husband sleeps on an air mattress on the floor. He gets my son who is 6’2″, 220lbs, out of bed every day, showers and dresses him, feeds him, walks with him to class, sets up his laptop, cleans his room, and does his laundry. He puts him to bed at night and takes care of his personal issues. My husband then gets up every two hours to turn my son so he doesn’t get pressure sores. He takes him to and from the hospital with various issues. For one 10 day stint, so that my son didn’t have to sit in a hospital for two weeks and miss classes, my husband administered an IV through a pic line for an infection my son suffered. My son has 5 weeks left to his first year of college and plans to continue. When people tell my husband what an awesome thing he is doing, such a sacrifice, I love his response.. “He’s my son.”\n\n“He talks funny”, I told my Mom after meeting ‘Murray’ in our small house in San Bernardino at the age of 6. My mother was divorced and met ‘Murray’ in London. He was from New Zealand, a place, at that age, I had never heard of. Over the next few years this ‘Murray’ character was around a lot. I guess he was OK. My younger sister and I were indifferent and still very close to our biological father. It wasn’t for years that we would realize the importance and love that Murray had for us. My biological father was an amazing man and we loved him very much, however, at a young age he was diagnosed with a deadly cancer and suffered before passing at age 37. Murray took us to the hospital for visits and was supportive in ways a stepfather wasn’t typically viewed. Before my father died, from his hospital bed he asked Murray to take care of his girls. I can say with confidence and admiration for Murray that those words have held true. Murray has supported my sisters (he had two more girls with my mother) and me through college and supported our dreams. Most importantly, I trust him and can depend on him for moral, financial, and emotional support. Murray isn’t just an amazing father; he is an amazing person and one of the kindest and friendliest men you will ever meet. I can’t imagine going out for dinner in our hometown and not having someone yell, “Hey Murray! How the heck are ya?” I couldn’t have asked for a better stepfather. Although I knew him growing up as ‘Murray’, I think it’s safe to say that he is truly my “Dad”."
