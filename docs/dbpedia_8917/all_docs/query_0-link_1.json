        "text": "About\n\nWhile riding the subway uptown toward toward El Barrio, eager to witness the birth of his firstborn, a factory worker and his best friend are caught by the Great Northeastern Blackout of 1965. The play revels at their enduring good humor, and their courage, while revealing their complex views about their role at home, the women around them, the hope for their firstborn and their identity as a working class citizen. In an uninterrupted interaction with the audience, the actors take over each other's roles as their characters learn lifelong lessons from the unexpected: the darkness and the stars.\n\nSet to the rhythms of classic love songs of the 1950s and original compositions played live, El Apagon/The Blackout, is a tribute to the experience of Puerto Rican migration and diaspora the world over and the cross grain of difference we share with all Latinos. El Apagon / The Blackout, based on the short story \"The Night We Became People Again\" by Jose Luis Gonzalez, has been alluded as raucous, funny, illuminating and as the quintessential Boricua play. Conducted by Musical Director Desmar Guevara. Directed by Rosalba Rolon."
