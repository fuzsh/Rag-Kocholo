        "text": "6/22/24 All Star Bingo Game at Town Square\n\n22 June 2024 News\n\nGREEN LAKE, WI, — This month’s jackpot prize is a whopper! Put on your baseball caps and come to Town Square in Green Lake for All-Star Bingo on Saturday, June 29. Doors open and concessions begin at 5:00 p.m., card sales start at 5:30 p.m., and games commence at 6:30 p.m.\n\nThe evening consists of 13 games, including speedy bingo and a progressive blackout. The progressive jackpot prize is $2,207 and half of the night’s sales if bingo is called in 53 numbers or less; the consolation prize is $200. The night will also feature a 50/50 raffle, door prizes, and plenty of family fun.\n\n“We’re excited to be adding brats to the concessions for this month’s baseball-themed bingo,” Phil Burkart, Town Square co-founder, stated.\n\nConcessions will be available for purchase, including Sheboygan hot dogs, brats, chips, beer, and wine. Carry-ins are prohibited. We encourage attendees to arrive early to find their preferred seats before the games begin. Minors are welcome to play bingo in Wisconsin when accompanied by a parent or guardian.\n\nBingo takes place at Town Square on the last Saturday of every month. Proceeds from the bingo games support Town Square, an award-winning community center located in the historic county courthouse buildings in the heart of downtown Green Lake. The mission of Town Square Community Center is to enrich the lives of the Green Lake community members, family, and friends by providing cultural, social, recreational, educational, and economic opportunities for people of all ages while preserving our treasured historic building. Town Square is operated by Green Lake Renewal, Inc., a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.\n\nPhoto Credit: Baseball Bingo Oft Family – Taken by Kris Anderson at last year’s event.\n\nbnelson"
