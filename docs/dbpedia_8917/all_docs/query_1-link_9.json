        "text": "This weekend, the St. Louis and New Orleans jazz connection by way of Jazz St. Louis continues in a major way. The JazzU All-Stars comprising the top middle and high school players from Jazz St. Louis’ acclaimed JazzU program, will perform at the historic New Orleans Jazz & Hertiage Festival in the WWOZ Jazz Tent on Saturday, May 4. Their presentation marks the first time a Jazz St. Louis student ensemble will perform at the festival.\n\n“They are ambassadors of Jazz St. Louis and the St. Louis region,” said Jazz St. Louis President and CEO Victor Goines.\n\nTheir set is a significant milestone for Jazz St. Louis and its young musicians, offering them an opportunity to showcase their talents on one of the most celebrated jazz festivals in the world.\n\n“Participating in a major jazz festival is an unparalleled opportunity for our students,” said Adaron Jackson, Director of Education and Community Engagement for Jazz St. Louis. “Performing in New Orleans, the birthplace of jazz, will be a profound and unforgettable experience, connecting them with the rich history and cultural heritage of this music, fueling a lifelong passion and opening doors to future opportunities in the jazz world and beyond.”\n\nNew Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival 2024 performers include The Rolling Stones, Irma Thomas, Kenny Barron, Rebirth Brass Band, Charles Lloyd, Nicholas Payton, Neil Young, Danilo Pérez, Stefon Harris & Blackout, Bonnie Raitt, and Jon Batiste, among many other notable and celebrated artists.\n\nIn addition to their festival performance, the group will embark on a culturally enriching tour of New Orleans, visiting and performing in locations pivotal to the history of jazz. The trip will not only provide them with the opportunity to perform but also to immerse themselves in the rich musical heritage of the city. On their agenda is a trip to the Ellis Marsalis Center for Music and the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, an incubator for many of jazz music’s most celebrated artists including notable alumni Jon Batiste, Nicholas Payton, Terence Blanchard, and Troy “Trombone Shorty” Andrews among others. Adding to the excitement, Jazz St. Louis President and CEO Victor Goines will perform at New Orleans’ premier jazz venue, Snug Harbor Jazz Bistro, with his quartet on Friday, May 3, and at the festival on Sunday, May 5.\n\n“One of my primary motivations for joining Jazz St. Louis was to help increase the visibility of our organization locally, nationally, and internationally,” said Goines. “Having the JazzU All-Stars travel to my hometown of New Orleans to perform at one of the largest jazz festivals in the world will provide them with real-world experiences of what it means to be a jazz musician.”\n\nThis trip provides a unique educational opportunity for students to experience firsthand the music and culture of a city which bears the name, “The Birthplace of Jazz.” The JazzU All-Stars – which includes Miles Cole on Trombone, Ryan Cooper on Trumpet, Issac Dessau on Bass, Clio Grant on Piano, Tonnie Kamkwalala Jr. on Drums, and Jason Scholte on Alto Saxophone – will have the opportunity to interact with industry professionals, venue owners, and renowned performers, gaining valuable insights and firsthand experience in the world of professional music.\n\n“When I learned that Jazz St. Louis was bringing students to New Orleans for Jazz Fest, I knew that I wanted to assist,” said renowned jazz vocalist and trumpeter, Jeremy Davenport. “I grew up in St. Louis, but New Orleans has been my home since 1990. Victor Goines hired me to perform my first Jazz Fest gig that year.”\n\nNew Orleans has long served as one of the meccas for aspiring musicians and enthusiasts alike. For the JazzU All-Stars, a visit to this cultural hotspot isn’t merely a field trip; it’s an immersive educational journey into the heart of the music industry.\n\n“The St. Louis/New Orleans connection is special to me,” Davenport said. “And the educational component of Jazz St. Louis is impressive and important.”"
