        "text": "1B JIM GENTILE: In four All-Star games he was 2-for-11.\n\n2B JOHNNY RAY: Lined to left field as pinch hitter in only All-Star at bat, 1988.\n\nSS ALVIN DARK: Two hits in 10 at bats, in 1951, 1952 and 1954.\n\n3B PEPPER MARTIN: He was the first batter in the first All-Star game, in 1933. He grounded out to shortstop. Overall, in three games, he was 1-for-8 with an RBI and a stolen base.\n\nLF JOE CARTER: Has the highest All-Star Game batting average (.455) among Oklahomans. The last Oklahoman to play in an All-Star Game (1996) and also the last Okie to start an All-Star Game (AL left fielder, 1994).\n\nCF MICKEY MANTLE: Among Oklahomans, has the All-Star records for years selected (20), at bats (43), games played (16), walks (9) and strikeouts (17, an All-Star Game record). Shares Oklahoma record of 10 All-Star hits with Bench. Hit two All-Star homers. One of only three (with Joe Morgan and Dave Whitfield) to hit in seven straight All-Star games.\n\nRF JOHNNY CALLISON: The only Oklahoman named All-Star Game MVP. He was the 1964 game's most valuable player after hitting game-winning, three-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning. The National League, down 4-3 entering the inning, won 7-4.\n\nC JOHNNY BENCH: Named to The Sporting News' 50th anniversary all-time All-Star Game team in 1983. He had 10 hits in his first 23 All-Star at bats. Overall he hit .357 (10-of-28) with five runs, six RBIs and three homers in 12 games. He was selected for 14 All-Star games. He had a string of six straight All-Star Games with hits. The only Oklahoman named to the All-Star Game as a rookie, in 1968. One of 11 players to homer in his first All-Star at bat; did it in second inning of 1969 game (he caught but did not bat in the '68 game). Among Oklahomans, he has the highest All-Star slugging percentage (.679), most homers (3, one more than Mickey Mantle), most total bases (19, three more than The Mick), and six RBIs. Shares Oklahoma record of 10 All-Star hits with Mantle.\n\nP CARL HUBBELL: Four days after pitching 18-inning win over St. Louis, he pitched two shutout All-Star innings in '33. The next year, after giving up a single to Charlie Gehringer and walk to Heinie Manush, Hubbell struck out five straight future Hall of Famers: Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmy Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin. After a single by Bill Dickey, Hubbell struck out Lefty Gomez for six K's in the first two innings. Seventeen of the 18 starters in that '34 game went into the Hall of Fame. Hubbell's All-Star Game ERA is 2.79.\n\nNOTE: Oklahomans are defined as those ballplayers born in state or who lived in state other than merely during their baseball seasons.\n\nOKLAHOMANS' ALL-STAR GAME HIGHLIGHTS\n\n1933\n\nPepper Martin is the first batter in the first All-Star Game, July 6, 1933, at Comiskey Park in Chicago. He grounds out.\n\nCarl Hubbell, four days after pitching 18-inning, six-hit shutout, shuts out the AL over the final two innings.\n\nThree Oklahomans started for the NL: third baseman Martin, pitcher Hubbell and left fielder Paul Waner.\n\n1934\n\nIn historic All-Star sequence, Hubbell strikes out five future Hall of Famers in a row: Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmy Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin. After a hit interrupts the string, he strikes out Lefty Gomez, too.\n\n1936\n\nIn the NL's first All-Star win, Dizzy Dean is the starting and winning pitcher after going three scoreless innings. Hubbell follows with two more shutout innings.\n\n1937\n\nDean's brief but brilliant career is effectively ended by a line drive off his right big toe by Earl Averill. Dean would return too soon and develop arm problems while favoring his right foot. He would slump to 13-10 in '37 and win only 16 more over the next five years.\n\n1940\n\nHubbell gets the save in the first All-Star shutout, 4-0 in St. Louis.\n\n1942\n\nAl Benton gets the save by pitching the final five innings, allowing one run and four hits. He retired Mel Ott, Enos Slaughter and Ernie Lombardi on flyouts in the ninth inning to preserve 3-1 AL win at the Polo Grounds.\n\nThe game got over just in time: On the day of the game, the city of New York scheduled a wartime blackout of 10 p.m. The 6:30 p.m. game ended two minutes before 10.\n\n1946\n\nIn '45, no game because of World War II. In '46, for the first time, no Oklahomans are picked for All-Star Game.\n\n1950\n\nIn the first extra-inning All-Star Game, Allie Reynolds shuts out the NL on one hit in the 10th, 11th and 12th innings. But NL wins 4-3 on Red Schoendienst homer in top of 14th. Mantle ties All-Star record by striking out three times.\n\n1953\n\nAn Oklahoman is the winning pitcher (Warren Spahn) and losing pitcher (Reynolds).\n\n1954\n\nMickey Mantle singles and scores the winning run in highest-scoring All-Star Game, an 11-9 AL win. Gene Conley is the losing pitcher.\n\n1955\n\nConley is the winning pitcher a year after losing. He strikes out Al Kaline, Mickey Vernon and Al Rosen in the top of the 12th, and Stan Musial leads off the bottom of the inning with a game-winning homer.\n\nMantle hits monster homer, a three-run shot to center that travels an estimated 430 feet and puts AL up 4-0 in first inning.\n\n1956\n\nMantle homers again, a solo shot after Ted Williams' two-run belt. Both homers are off Spahn.\n\n1959 (2nd game)\n\nOne Oklahoman (Jerry Walker) gets a win and another (Cal McLish) gets a save in the first \"second game\" in All-Star history (there would be two gams from 1959-62). Another Okie pitcher, Conley, pitches two scoreless innings for the losing NL.\n\nAL manager Casey Stengel adds Walker to the roster, to replace catcher Gus Triandos, the day before the game. Then Casey says Walker, who is 8-5 with Baltimore, will start. He holds the NL to one run in three innings. McLish pitches final two scoreless innings. In the eighth he retires future Hall of Famers Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Ernie Banks on two groundouts and a strikeout.\n\n1964\n\nJohnny Callison becomes only Oklahoman to be an All-Star Game MVP. He is 1-for-3, with three-run, game-winning homer off Dick Radatz in the bottom of the ninth.\n\n1965\n\nWillie Stargell has two hits, including two-run homer, in 6-5 NL win.\n\n1967\n\nIn longest All-Star Game, NL wins 2-1 in 15 innings. NL's Ferguson Jenkins strikes out six in two innings.\n\n1969\n\nJohnny Bench homers in first All-Star at bat, and is robbed of another homer by Carl Yastrzemki's over-the-fence catch in the sixth inning.\n\n1970\n\nBench ties Mantle's All-Star Game record by striking out three times.\n\n1971\n\nBench homers again, goes 2-for-4 with two RBIs, but AL ends eight-game losing streak.\n\n1973\n\nBench homers again, in 7-1 NL win. For the second straight year, a record seven Oklahomans are picked for the game.\n\n1982\n\nIn first All-Star Game played outside the U.S., the NL's starting and winning pitcher is Steve Rogers of the hometown Montreal Expos.\n\n1992\n\nJoe Carter is 2-for-3 with an RBI in 13-6 AL win.\n\n1994\n\nCarter, the AL left fielder, becomes the last Oklahoman to start an All-Star Game. Mickey Tettleton also plays in the game, walking as a pinch hitter. They are only Okies who have played in the past 11 All-Star Games.\n\n1996\n\nAL reserve outfielder Carter is the last Oklahoman to play in an All-Star Game. He singles in his only at bat.\n\nSOURCES: The Midsummer Classic: The Complete History of Baseball's All-Star Game; Glory Days of Summer; Major League Baseball and independent research.\n\nCOMPILED BY BOB HERSOM\n\nArchive ID: 856583"
