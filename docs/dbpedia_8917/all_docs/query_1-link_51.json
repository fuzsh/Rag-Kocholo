Between working and raising their three kids, Caleb and Carolyn have been steadfastly writing songs and honing their debut album, “Delta Star.”\n\nEast Main Street will be closed from 2-4:30 p.m., and Mechanic Street all day for set-up and tear-down. Downtown businesses and restaurants will be open. Vendors and activities will be dispersed throughout the area."
