        "text": "If you’re a fan of astronomy or otherwise interested in unique natural phenomenons, you may be wondering where to see the solar eclipse today—or if the big event will be visible from your home. Today, a number of cities throughout Mexico, the United States, and Canada will experience brief moments of dawn- or dusk-like darkness right in the middle of the day. Officially described as a total solar eclipse, the occurrence happens when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth and blocks the entirety of sun’s face.\n\nBecause it’s not something that happens everyday, the marvel has been prompting locals and travelers alike to scope out the best viewing locations, but fear not if you don’t have your spot figured out yet. Todays’s eclipse will travel along a wide, densely populated path. NASA estimated that 31.6 million people live in an area that will see the total solar eclipse and another 150 million are within 200 miles of it. What’s more, there won’t be another total solar eclipse visible from the contiguous United States until 2044, according to NASA, making it all the more important to catch this one.\n\nFor most of the United States, the eclipse won’t happen until the afternoon, meaning there’s still time to figure out how you’ll watch it. Here, AD covers everything you need to know about the upcoming event, including the 13 best cities to see the eclipse.\n\nWhat is a total solar eclipse?\n\nThere are a number of different types of eclipses, which offer different views of either the sun or moon. As NASA explains it, “A solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, casting a shadow on Earth that either fully or partially blocks the sun’s light in some areas.” A total solar eclipse means the moon will completely block the sun’s face, and if you’re in the path of the eclipse, you’ll be able to see the sun’s corona and outer atmosphere, weather permitting. Other types of eclipses, like a partial solar eclipse, occur when the moon covers only some of the sun, resulting in a crescent shape.\n\nHow do you safely watch the total solar eclipse?\n\nNot only are solar eclipses special because of their relative rarity, they’re unique in how they’re watched. For the few minutes when the moon is fully blocking the sun—know as totality—viewers can look directly at the sun without any eye protection. Any other time, including the hours before and after totality when you’ll see a partial eclipse, it’s important to wear protective eye gear, such as solar eclipse glasses. “As soon as you see even a little bit of the bright sun reappear after totality, immediately put your eclipse glasses back on or use a handheld solar viewer to look at the sun,” NASA explains.\n\nHow often do solar eclipses happen?\n\nSolar eclipses, of one kind or another, happen between two and five times a year. Total eclipses happen about once every 18 months. However, this doesn’t mean one will be visible from your home this often. According to the Natural History Museum, London, a total solar eclipse is viewable from any one place about once every 400 years. For example, the last total solar eclipse visible from the United States happened in 2017 and followed a track from Oregon towards South Carolina. This year, the solar eclipse’s path will start in Texas and move northeast towards Maine. The next total solar eclipse will happen in 2026 and will be visible from the Arctic, Greenland, Iceland, and northern Spain.\n\nHow long will the 2024 solar eclipse last?\n\nTotal solar eclipses can last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. The difference in totality length has to do with how far apart the sun, moon, and Earth are at any given time, since the latter two bodies both orbit in elliptical paths.\n\nWhen the Earth is furthest from the sun—making the star appear smaller—and the moon is closest to the Earth—which makes the moon look big—totality can last for over seven minutes. As Astronomy Mag reports, these circumstances will line up in about 160 years, when a solar eclipse on July 16, 2186, will see almost seven-and-a-half minutes of totality. On the other extreme, if the Earth is at its closest point to the sun and the moon is at its furthest point from Earth, humans won’t see a total solar eclipse, even if all of the celestial bodies are in line. Since totality is all about the perspective of the viewer, this is also why each city will experience the 2024 eclipse differently.\n\nThis year, totality will last for a little over four minutes in some areas, which is significantly more than the two minutes that people experienced during the 2017 eclipse. As NASA notes, “During the 2017 total solar eclipse, the moon was a little bit farther away from Earth than it will be during the upcoming total solar eclipse, causing the path of that eclipse to be a little skinnier.” Seven years ago, the path of totality—which shows which parts of the world will be able to see the total solar eclipse—was only about 62 to 71 miles wide. This year, that path ranges from 108 to 122 miles wide. “Meaning at any given moment this eclipse covers more ground,” NASA explains.\n\nHow to read maps showing the 2024 solar eclipse\n\nAs noted, this year’s path of totality is about 110 miles wide. Cities closer to the center of the path will sustain total darkness longer than those on the edges. In addition to longer totality than in 2017, this year’s path of totality covers more densely populated areas than the previous one. This means more people should be able to experience the total solar eclipse.\n\nAny part of the country that is not within the path may see a partial eclipse, and the closer a location is to the strip, the smaller the crescent of visible sun will be. In these locations, it won’t be safe to look directly at the eclipse without protective glasses or a viewing device. NASA has put together an interactive map, which allows viewers to see the eclipse timing in their city.\n\nWhere to see the solar eclipse\n\nAccording to NASA, cities in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and small parts of Tennessee and Michigan will experience the total solar eclipse. Parts of Mexico and Canada will also fall within the eclipse’s path. Read on for the best places to see the 2024 total solar eclipse.\n\nMazatlán, Mexico\n\nMaine is the northern most place in the United States to see the total eclipse in 2024, also making it the last place in the country to experience totality. Houlton will be among the best places in the state to watch the sight, and darkness will begin at 3:32 p.m. and last for 3 minutes and 20 seconds.\n\nHow will weather impact visibility?\n\nGeographically, the cities listed above represent the best places to see the 2024 solar. However, weather will play a major role in just how well those on the ground will be able to see the phenomenon. It goes without saying that cloudy conditions or rain will impact visibility and make it harder to see the eclipse. Currently, meteorologist are forecasting worse conditions in the south-central United States, which could affect those in Texas and Arkansas. Those in the Midwest and northeast have better odds, where conditions are presently forecasted to be sunny and with clear skies.\n\nWhat will I see during the solar eclipse if my city isn’t along the path of totality?\n\nThough not every city will see a total solar eclipse, most of the United States will see at least a partial eclipse. For example, as NASA’s map shows, Seattle, which is one of the furthest metropolises from the eclipse’s path will still see about 20% of the sun covered by the moon. Here, peak coverage will happen around 11:29 a.m. On the south side of the country, Miami, which is also quite far from the eclipse’s path, will see 46.2% of the sun covered around 3:01 p.m.\n\nOn the other hand, cities which are not along the path of totality but are very close will see a greater percentage of the sun covered. St. Louis, for example, which is just outside the path of totality, will see the moon covering 99.1% of the sun during peak totality, which will happen at 2 p.m. For detailed information about your city, see NASA’s interactive eclipse map.\n\nCan I watch the 2024 solar eclipse virtually?\n\nIf you won’t be within the path of totality, a number of organizations are live streaming the monumental event (This may also come in handy if a city experiences cloudy weather or rain on eclipse day). To start, NASA is offering live broadcasts in both English and Spanish and live streams from telescopes that will capture the eclipse as it moves across the country. Scientific American will capture the event with jets that have been converted into flying telescopes to chase the eclipse, offering a view that one simply can’t find on the ground.\n\nABC News and National Geographic are also teaming up to produce “Eclipse Across America,” a live special hosted by David Muir and Linsey Davis. Coverage starts at 2:00 p.m. ET on ABC, ABC News Live, National Geographic Channel, Nat Geo WILD, Disney+, Hulu and Network Social Media Platforms and will broadcast from 10 cities along the path of totality, including Mazatlán, Mexico; Russelville, Arkansas; and Houlton, Maine."
