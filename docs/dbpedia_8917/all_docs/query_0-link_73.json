        "text": "The crowd at Merriweather Post Pavilion brimmed with excitement as they welcomed Maggie Rogers home for the Maryland stop on the Don’t Forget Me Tour. Maggie is touring in support of her 3rd studio album. She emerged on stage with a luminous glow. Her setlist heavily featured tracks from the new record, showcasing her soaring vocals on high-energy numbers like “Drunk,” and her ability to deliver delicate intimacy on stripped-back songs like “I Still Do.” After performing “The Knife,” she took a moment to wish the dads in the audience a happy Father’s Day, fondly reminiscing about how her own father used to drive her back to the Eastern Shore after shows at Merriweather when she was a teenager.\n\nThe evening took a special turn when Maryland governor Wes Moore joined Maggie on stage following “Want Want” to honor her advocacy for reproductive rights, LGBT rights, and fair ticket pricing in the state. Moore declared that June 16th, 2024 is officially Maggie Rogers Day in Maryland. The crowd cheered and chanted her name in approval. Maggie closed out the show with a heartfelt cover of Harold Arlen’s “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” in tribute to her father on Father’s Day.\n\nCheck out photos from the night below!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe Japanese House (Amber Bain) is supporting Maggie Rogers on the Don’t Forget Me Tour. Amber took the stage backed by her band and launched into “Touching Yourself.” She delivered a brief but impactful set that skimmed highlights across her 3 latest albums and her 2020 EP. Her latest single, “:),” is out now via Dirty Hit.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nKeep Up With Maggie Rogers: Instagram // Twitter // Website"
